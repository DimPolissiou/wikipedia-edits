The airline began operating commercial aircraft in 1983 under the name [[Channel Express]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dartgroup.co.uk|title=Welcome - Dart Group plc|work=dartgroup.co.uk}}</ref> when it was purchased by the Dart Group's current Executive Chairman, Philip Meeson. Initially a freight operator, from 2001 the airline also began operating passenger charter services using [[Boeing]] aircraft to international destinations on mainly short and medium-haul routes.\n\n===Formative years===\n[[File:Jet2 737 Leeds Bradford Airport.jpg|thumb|A Jet2.com [[Boeing 737-300]] in the former livery|alt=]]\nIn 2002, [[Channel Express]] established the Jet2.com brand from [[Leeds Bradford International Airport]]. The re-branded Jet2.com began operating as a leisure airline with its first flight from Leeds Bradford to Amsterdam on 12 February 2003, which operated a twice daily rotation with two [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]] aircraft. During 2003, further scheduled flights were launched to seven European sun and city break destinations.\n\nIn 2004, a second base was opened at [[Manchester Airport]] with the airline operating from Terminal 1. The airline also acquired further Boeing 737 and 757 aircraft and opened a base at [[Belfast International Airport]].\n\nIn 2005, Jet2.com opened a third base at [[Newcastle International Airport|Newcastle]]. Later in the year, the company acquired two [[Boeing 757|Boeing 757-200]] aircraft, enabling it to fly medium-long haul destinations as well as carrying more passengers on popular existing routes. These aircraft helped the company to open two more bases at [[Blackpool Airport|Blackpool]] and [[Edinburgh Airport|Edinburgh]].\n\nIn 2006 the company relocated from [[Bournemouth]] to [[Leeds]] and was renamed Jet2.com Limited.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/b5eb00126cd2a251a7e4256abf67587c/compdetails |title=Companies House - English Company 02739537 |publisher=Wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=26 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Expansion ===\nIn November 2008 Jet2.com changed its slogan from \"The North's Low Cost Airline\" to \"Friendly Low Fares\".

The airline began operating commercial aircraft in 1983 under the name [[Channel Express]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dartgroup.co.uk|title=Welcome - Dart Group plc|work=dartgroup.co.uk}}</ref> when it was purchased by the Dart Group's current Executive Chairman, Philip Meeson. Initially a freight operator, from 2001 the airline also began operating passenger charter services using [[Boeing]] aircraft to international destinations on mainly short and medium-haul routes.\n\n===Formative years===\n[[File:Jet2 737 Leeds Bradford Airport.jpg|thumb|A Boeing 737-300 wearing the airline's former livery, taking off at Leeds Bradford Airport in 2008]]\nIn 2002, [[Channel Express]] established the Jet2.com brand from [[Leeds Bradford International Airport]]. The re-branded Jet2.com began operating as a leisure airline with its first flight from Leeds Bradford to [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam]] on 12 February 2003, which operated a twice daily rotation with two [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]] aircraft. During 2003, further scheduled flights were launched to seven European sun and city break destinations.\n\nIn 2004, a second base was opened at [[Manchester Airport]] with the airline operating from Terminal 1. The airline also acquired further Boeing 737 and 757 aircraft and opened a base at [[Belfast International Airport]].\n\nIn 2005, Jet2.com opened a third base at [[Newcastle International Airport|Newcastle]]. Later in the year, the company acquired two [[Boeing 757|Boeing 757-200]] aircraft, enabling it to fly medium-long haul destinations as well as carrying more passengers on popular existing routes. These aircraft helped the company to open two more bases at [[Blackpool Airport|Blackpool]]  and [[Edinburgh Airport|Edinburgh]].\n\nIn 2006 the company relocated from [[Bournemouth]] to [[Leeds]] and was renamed Jet2.com Limited.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/b5eb00126cd2a251a7e4256abf67587c/compdetails |title=Companies House - English Company 02739537 |publisher=Wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=26 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Expansion ===\nThe airline acquired further Boeing 737 and 757 aircraft and opened a base at [[Belfast International Airport]]. In November 2008 Jet2.com changed its slogan from \"The North's Low Cost Airline\" to \"Friendly Low Fares\". This preceded the announcement of opening a hub at [[East Midlands Airport]], the first of the airline's outside the North of England and Scotland.

Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, the film is based on accounts of the [[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking]] of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']], and stars [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and [[Kate Winslet]] as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated [[maiden voyage]].\n\nCameron's inspiration for the film came from his fascination with [[shipwreck]]s; he felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster. Production began in 1995, when Cameron shot footage of the actual [[Wreck of the RMS Titanic|''Titanic'' wreck]]. The modern scenes on the research vessel'' ''were shot on board the ''[[Akademik Mstislav Keldysh]]'', which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. [[Scale model]]s, [[computer-generated imagery]], and a reconstruction of the ''Titanic'' built at [[Baja Studios]] were used to re-create the sinking. The film was co-financed by [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[20th Century Fox]]; the former handled distribution in North America while the latter released the film internationally. It was the [[List of most expensive films|most expensive film ever made]] at the time, with a production budget of $200&nbsp;million.\n\nUpon its release on December 19, 1997, ''Titanic'' achieved significant critical and commercial success. Nominated for 14 [[Academy Awards]], it tied ''[[All About Eve]]'' (1950)<!-- NOTE: La La Land (film) does not belong in the lead (introduction) of this article. If it is added to the lead, it will be removed. --> for the most Oscar nominations, and won 11, including the awards for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], tying ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959)<!-- PLEASE DO NOT ADD RETURN OF THE KING; YOU CANNOT TIE WITH SOMETHING WHICH WAS RELEASED LATER.--> for the most Oscars won by a single film. With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84 billion, ''Titanic'' was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark, and became [[Timeline of highest-grossing films|the highest-grossing film ever at the time]],<!-- Although the film was released in 1997, it became the highest-grossing in 1998. DO NOT CHANGE THIS.--> until Cameron's ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' surpassed it in 2010. A [[3D film|3D]] version of ''Titanic,'' released on April 4, 2012, to commemorate the centennial of the sinking, earned it an additional $343.6 million worldwide, pushing the film's worldwide total to $2.18 billion and making it the second film to gross more than $2 billion worldwide (after ''Avatar''). In 2017, the film was re-released for its 20th anniversary and was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please do not add significant detail to this section; there is a 700-word standard specified in WP:FILMPLOT.

Distraught over the engagement, Rose climbs over the stern and contemplates suicide; Jack Dawson, a poor artist, intervenes and discourages her. Discovered with Jack, Rose tells a concerned Cal that she was peering over the edge and Jack saved her from falling. Cal becomes indifferent, and it is suggested to him that Jack be rewarded; he invites Jack to dine with them in first-class. Jack and Rose develop a tentative friendship, despite Cal, his valet Spicer Lovejoy, and Ruth, being wary of him. Following dinner, Rose secretly joins Jack at a party in third-class.\n\nAware of Cal and Ruth's disapproval, Rose rebuffs Jack's advances, but later realizes she prefers him over Cal. After rendezvousing on the bow at sunset, Rose takes Jack to her state room; at her request, Jack sketches Rose posing nude wearing Cal's engagement present, the Heart of the Ocean. They evade Lovejoy, and have sex in an automobile inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness the ship's collision with an iceberg and overhear its officers and builder discussing its seriousness.\n\nCal discovers Jack's sketch of Rose and an insulting note from her in his safe along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose attempt to inform Cal of the collision, Cal retaliates by having Lovejoy slip the necklace into Jack's pocket, accusing him of theft. Jack is arrested and restrained in the [[master-at-arms]]' office. Cal puts the necklace in his own coat pocket.\n\nWith the ship sinking, Rose flees Cal and her mother, who has boarded a lifeboat, and frees Jack. On the boat deck, Cal and Jack encourage her to board a lifeboat. While intending only to save himself, Cal claims he can ensure he and Jack get off safely. As her lifeboat lowers, Rose realizes she cannot leave Jack, and jumps back on board. Cal takes Lovejoy's pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first-class dining saloon. After using up his ammunition, he relents. Cal realizes he gave his coat, and consequently the necklace, to Rose. He later boards a lifeboat by carrying a lost child.\n\nAfter braving several obstacles, Jack and Rose return to the boat deck. The lifeboats have departed and passengers are falling to their deaths as the stern rises out of the water. The ship breaks in half, dropping the stern into the water. Jack and Rose climb onto the back of it, and ride it into the ocean. He helps her onto a wooden panel buoyant enough for only one person. He assures her that she will die an old woman, warm in her bed.

After the collision, he tries to convince the others, particularly Ismay, that it is a \"mathematical certainty\" that the ship will sink. He is depicted during the sinking of the ship as standing next to the clock in the first-class smoking room, lamenting his failure to build a strong and safe ship. Although this has become one of the most famous legends of the sinking of the ''Titanic'', this story, which was published in a 1912 book (''Thomas Andrews: Shipbuilder'') and therefore perpetuated, came from John Stewart, a steward on the ship who in fact left the ship in boat no.15 at approximately 1:40&nbsp;a.m.<ref name=\"seaofglass\">ON A SEA OF GLASS: THE LIFE & LOSS OF THE RMS TITANIC\" by Tad Fitch, J.

Bruce Ismay]]: Ismay is portrayed as a rich, ignorant upper-class man. In the film, he uses his position as [[White Star Line]] managing director to influence Captain Smith to go faster with the prospect of an earlier arrival in New York and favorable press attention; while this action appears in popular portrayals of the disaster, it is unsupported by evidence.<ref>{{cite book |last=Beesley |first=Lawrence |title=The Loss of the S.S.

Ismay later boards Collapsible C (one of the last lifeboats to leave the ship) just before it is lowered. He was branded a coward by the press and public for surviving the disaster while many women and children had drowned.\n* [[Eric Braeden]] as [[John Jacob Astor IV]]: A first-class passenger whom Rose (correctly) calls the richest man on the ship. The film depicts Astor and his 18-year-old wife [[Madeleine Astor|Madeleine]] ([[Charlotte Chatton]]) as being introduced to Jack by Rose in the first-class dining saloon. During the introduction, Astor asks if Jack is connected to the \"Boston Dawsons\", a question Jack neatly deflects by saying that he is instead affiliated with the [[Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin|Chippewa Falls]] Dawsons. Astor is last seen as the Grand Staircase glass dome implodes and water surges in.\n* [[Bernard Fox (actor)|Bernard Fox]] as [[Archibald Gracie IV|Colonel Archibald Gracie IV]]: The film depicts Gracie making a comment to Cal that \"women and machinery don't mix\", and congratulating Jack for saving Rose from falling off the ship, though he is unaware that it was a suicide attempt. Fox had portrayed [[Frederick Fleet]] in the 1958 film ''[[A Night to Remember (1958 film)|A Night to Remember]]''.\n* [[Michael Ensign]] as [[Benjamin Guggenheim]]: A mining magnate traveling in first-class. He shows off his French mistress Madame Aubert (Fannie Brett) to his fellow passengers while his wife and three daughters wait for him at home.

Lightoller took charge of the port side evacuation. The film depicts Lightoller informing Captain Smith that it will be difficult to see icebergs without breaking water and following the collision suggesting the crew should begin boarding women and children to the lifeboats. He is seen brandishing a gun and threatening to use it to keep order. He can be seen on top of Collapsible B when the first funnel collapses. Lightoller was the most senior officer to have survived the disaster.\n* [[Simon Crane]] as [[Joseph Boxhall|Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall]]: The officer in charge of firing flares and manning Lifeboat 2 during the sinking. He is shown on the bridge wings helping the seamen firing the flares.\n* [[Ioan Gruffudd]] as [[Harold Lowe|Fifth Officer Harold Lowe]]: The ship's only officer to lead a lifeboat to retrieve survivors of the sinking from the icy waters. The film depicts Lowe rescuing Rose.\n* Edward Fletcher as [[James Paul Moody|Sixth Officer James Moody]]: The ship's only junior officer to have died in the sinking. The film depicts Moody admitting Jack and Fabrizio onto the ship only moments before it departs from Southampton. Moody is later shown following [[William McMaster Murdoch|Mr. Murdoch's]] orders to put the ship to full speed ahead, and informs First Officer Murdoch about the iceberg. He is last seen clinging to one of the davits on the starboard side after having unsuccessfully attempted to launch collapsible A.\n* James Lancaster as [[Thomas Byles|Father Thomas Byles]]: Second-class passenger Father Byles, a Catholic priest from England, is portrayed praying and consoling passengers during the ship's final moments.\n* Lew Palter and [[Elsa Raven]] as [[Isidor Straus]] and [[Ida Straus]]: Isidor is a former owner of R.H. Macy and Company, a former congressman from New York, and a member of the New York and New Jersey Bridge Commission. During the sinking, his wife Ida is offered a place in a lifeboat, but refuses, saying that she will honor her wedding pledge by staying with Isidor. They are last seen lying on their bed embracing each other as water fills their stateroom.\n* [[Martin Jarvis (actor)|Martin Jarvis]] as [[Cosmo Duff-Gordon|Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon]]: A Scottish baronet who is rescued in [[RMS Titanic Lifeboat No. 1|Lifeboat 1]]. Lifeboats 1 and 2 were emergency boats with a capacity of 40. Situated at the forward end of the boat deck, these were kept ready to launch in case of a person falling overboard. On the night of the disaster, Lifeboat 1 was the fourth to be launched, with 12 people aboard, including Duff-Gordon, his wife and her secretary. The baronet was much criticized for his conduct during the incident. It was suggested that he had boarded the emergency boat in violation of the \"women and children first\" policy and that the boat had failed to return to rescue those struggling in the water. He offered five pounds to each of the lifeboat's crew, which those critical of his conduct viewed as a bribe. The Duff-Gordons at the time (and his wife's secretary in a letter written at the time and rediscovered in 2007) stated that there had been no women or children waiting to board in the vicinity of the launching of their boat, and there is confirmation that lifeboat 1 of the Titanic was almost empty and that First Officer William Murdoch was apparently glad to offer Duff-Gordon and his wife and her secretary a place (simply to fill it) after they had asked if they could get on. Duff-Gordon denied that his offer of money to the lifeboat crew represented a bribe. The [[British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry into the sinking of the RMS Titanic|British Board of Trade's inquiry into the disaster]] accepted Duff-Gordon's denial of bribing the crew, but maintained that, if the emergency boat had rowed towards the people who were in the water, it might very well have been able to rescue some of them.<ref>''British Wreck Commissioner's Enquiry: Report.'' \"Account of the Saving and Rescue of those who Survived: Conduct of Sir Cosmo Duff Gordon and Mr Ismay\".

A [[horizon tank]] of seventeen million gallons was built for the exterior of the reconstructed ship, providing 270 degrees of ocean view. The ship was built to full scale, but Lamont removed redundant sections on the [[superstructure]] and forward well deck for the ship to fit in the tank, with the remaining sections filled with digital models.

They argued the extended length would mean fewer showings, thus less revenue, even though long epics are more likely to help directors win [[Academy Award|Oscars]]. Cameron refused, telling Fox, \"You want to cut my movie? You're going to have to fire me! You want to fire me? You're going to have to kill me!\"<ref name=\"www.ew.com\" /> The executives did not want to start over, because it would mean the loss of their entire investment, but they also initially rejected Cameron's offer of forfeiting his share of the profits as an empty gesture, as they predicted profits would be unlikely.<ref name=\"www.ew.com\" />\n\nCameron explained forfeiting his share as complex. \"...{{nbsp}}the short version is that the film cost proportionally much more than ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day|T2]]'' and ''[[True Lies]].'' Those films went up seven or eight percent from the initial budget. ''Titanic'' also had a large budget to begin with, but it went up a lot more,\" he said. \"As the producer and director, I take responsibility for the studio that's writing the checks, so I made it less painful for them. I did that on two different occasions. They didn't force me to do it; they were glad that I did.\"<ref name=\"www.industrycentral.net\" />\n\n==Post-production==\n\n===Effects===\nCameron wanted to push the boundary of special effects with his film, and enlisted [[Digital Domain]] and [[Pacific Data Images]] to continue the developments in digital technology which the director pioneered while working on ''[[The Abyss]]'' and ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]''. Many previous films about the RMS ''Titanic'' shot water in [[slow motion]], which did not look wholly convincing.<ref name=\"unreality\">Marsh and Kirkland, pp. 147\u2013154</ref> Cameron encouraged his crew to shoot their {{convert|45|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[Scale model|miniature]] of the ship as if \"we're making a commercial for the White Star Line\".<ref>Marsh and Kirkland, p. 65</ref> Afterwards, digital water and smoke were added, as were extras captured on a [[motion capture]] stage. Visual effects supervisor Rob Legato scanned the faces of many actors, including himself and his children, for the digital extras and stuntmen. There was also a {{convert|65|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} model of the ship's stern that could break in two repeatedly, the only miniature to be used in water.<ref name=\"unreality\" /> For scenes set in the ship's engines, footage of the [[SS Jeremiah O'Brien|SS ''Jeremiah O'Brien''{{'}}s]] engines were composited with miniature support frames, and actors shot against a [[chroma key|greenscreen]].<ref>{{cite video | title = VFX Shot Breakdown | medium = DVD | publisher = 20th Century Fox |year = 2005}}</ref> In order to save money, the first-class lounge was a miniature set incorporated into a greenscreen backdrop behind the actors.<ref>{{cite video | title = VFX How To For First Class Lounge | medium = DVD | publisher = 20th Century Fox |year = 2005}}</ref> The miniature of the Lounge would later be crushed to simulate the destruction of the room and a scale model of a First-Class corridor flooded with jets of water while the camera pans out.<ref>{{cite video | title = VFX How To Flood A First Class Corridor | medium = DVD | publisher = 20th Century Fox |year = 2005}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Titanic breaks in half.jpg|thumb|left|300px|alt=The Titanic about to sink into the ocean, with the ship breaking into two parts and with smoke still coming out of the funnels.|Unlike previous ''Titanic'' films, Cameron's retelling of the disaster showed the ship breaking into two pieces before sinking entirely. The scenes were an account of the moment's most likely outcome.]]\n\nAn enclosed {{convert|5000000|usgal|L|adj=mid}} tank was used for sinking interiors, in which the entire set could be tilted into the water. In order to sink the Grand Staircase, {{convert|90000|usgal|L}} of water were dumped into the set as it was lowered into the tank. Unexpectedly, the waterfall ripped the staircase from its steel-reinforced foundations, although no one was hurt. The {{convert|744|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} exterior of the RMS ''Titanic'' had its first half lowered into the tank, but as the heaviest part of the ship it acted as a [[shock absorber]] against the water; to get the set into the water, Cameron had much of the set emptied and even smashed some of the promenade windows himself. After submerging the dining saloon, three days were spent shooting Lovett's [[remotely operated vehicle|ROV]] traversing the wreck in the present.<ref name=\"heart\" /> The post-sinking scenes in the freezing Atlantic were shot in a {{convert|350000|usgal|L|adj=mid}} tank,<ref name=\"water\">Marsh and Kirkland, pp. 161\u2013168</ref> where the frozen corpses were created by applying on actors a powder that crystallized when exposed to water, and wax was coated on hair and clothes.<ref name=\"blueprint\" />\n\nThe climactic scene, which features the breakup of the ship directly before it sinks as well as its final plunge to the bottom of the Atlantic, involved a tilting full-sized set, 150 extras, and 100 stunt performers. Cameron criticized previous ''Titanic'' films for depicting the liner's final plunge as a graceful slide underwater. He \"wanted to depict it as the terrifyingly chaotic event that it really was\".<ref name=\"www.media-awareness.ca\" /> When carrying out the sequence, people needed to fall off the increasingly tilting deck, plunging hundreds of feet below and bouncing off of railings and propellers on the way down. A few attempts to film this sequence with stunt people resulted in some minor injuries, and Cameron halted the more dangerous stunts. The risks were eventually minimized \"by using computer generated people for the dangerous falls\".<ref name=\"www.media-awareness.ca\" />\n\n===Editing===\nThere was one \"crucial historical fact\" Cameron chose to omit from the film \u2013 the [[SS Californian|SS ''Californian'']] was close to the ''Titanic'' the night she sank but had turned off its radio for the night, did not hear her crew's [[SOS]] calls, and did not respond to their distress flares. \"Yes, the [SS] ''Californian.'' That wasn't a compromise to mainstream filmmaking. That was really more about emphasis, creating an emotional truth to the film,\" stated Cameron. He said there were aspects of retelling the sinking that seemed important in pre- and post-production, but turned out to be less important as the film evolved. \"The story of the ''Californian'' was in there; we even shot a scene of them switching off their Marconi radio set,\" said Cameron. \"But I took it out. It was a clean cut, because it focuses you back onto that world. If ''Titanic'' is powerful as a metaphor, as a microcosm, for the end of the world in a sense, then that world must be self-contained.\"<ref name=\"www.industrycentral.net\" />\n\nDuring the first assembly cut, Cameron altered the planned ending, which had given resolution to Brock Lovett's story. In the original version of the ending, Brock and Lizzy see the elderly Rose at the stern of the boat and fear she is going to commit suicide. Rose then reveals that she had the \"Heart of the Ocean\" diamond all along but never sold it, in order to live on her own without Cal's money. She tells Brock that life is priceless and throws the diamond into the ocean, after allowing him to hold it. After accepting that treasure is worthless, Brock laughs at his stupidity. Rose then goes back to her cabin to sleep, whereupon the film ends in the same way as the final version. In the editing room, Cameron decided that by this point, the audience would no longer be interested in Brock Lovett and cut the resolution to his story, so that Rose is alone when she drops the diamond. He also did not want to disrupt the audience's melancholy after the ''Titanic''{{'s}} sinking.<ref>{{cite video | people = James Cameron | title = Alternate Ending Commentary | medium = DVD | publisher = 20th Century Fox |year = 2005}}</ref> Paxton agreed that his scene with Brock's epiphany and laugh was unnecessary, stating that \"I would have shot heroin to make the scene work better ...you didn't really need anything from us. Our job was done by then ... If you're smart and you take the ego and the narcissism out of it, you'll listen to the film, and the film will tell you what it needs and what it does not need\".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/bill-paxton-on-the-alternate-ending-of-titanic-audiences-didnt-see-in-1997-150538039.html | title=Bill Paxton on the Alternate Ending of 'Titanic' That Audiences Didn't See in 1997 | first=Will | last=Lerner | date=February 27, 2017 | publisher=Yahoo!

Lovejoy goes after the pair in the sinking first-class dining room. Just as they are about to escape him, Lovejoy notices Rose's hand slap the water as it slips off the table behind which she is hiding. In revenge for framing him for the \"theft\" of the necklace, Jack attacks him and smashes his head against a glass window, which explains the gash on Lovejoy's head that can be seen when he dies in the completed version of the film. In their reactions to the scene, test audiences said it would be unrealistic to risk one's life for wealth, and Cameron cut it for this reason, as well as for timing and pacing reasons. Many other scenes were cut for similar reasons.<ref name=\"Deleted scene commentaries\" />\n\n===Music and soundtrack===\n{{Main|Titanic: Music from the Motion Picture|Back to Titanic}}\n{{listen|filename=|title=Excerpt from \"''Hymn to the Sea''\"|description=Featuring the vocals of [[Sissel Kyrkjeb\u00f8]], this is a recurring somber theme that is associated with the tragic elements of ''Titanic''|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nCameron wrote ''Titanic'' while listening to the work of Irish new-age musician [[Enya]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-jan-15-ca-8361-story.html|title=Soundtrack to 'Titanic' Rises to No. 1|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2019-06-17|language=en-US}}</ref> He offered Enya the chance to compose for the film, but she declined.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/irelands-enya-on-how-life-by-the-sea-influenced-her-music-1458056146|title=Ireland\u2019s Enya on How Life by the Sea Influenced Her Music|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=2019-06-17|language=en-US}}</ref> Cameron instead chose [[James Horner]] to compose the film's score.

Asprey & Garrard produced and designed the necklaces: the result was three different and unique designs. Two of their designs were used in the film while the other went unused until after the film had been released. The three necklaces are commonly known as the original prop, the J. Peterman necklace, and the Asprey necklace. The three necklaces are all very similar but have distinguishable differences.\n\t \nThe third and final design was not used in the film. After the film's success, [[Asprey & Garrard]] were commissioned to create an authentic Heart of the Ocean necklace using the original design. The result was a platinum-set, {{convert|171|carat|g|adj=on}} heart-shaped Ceylon [[sapphire]] surrounded by 103 diamonds.<ref name=\"oocities\" />  This design featured a much larger inverted pear shaped Ceylon sapphire with a subtle cleft to resemble a heart. The chain for this necklace also featured a mix of round, pear, and marquise cut white diamonds. The bail also featured a heart cut white diamond with another round cut diamond attached to an inverted pear shape diamond which was then attached to the cage of the main stone. The necklace was donated to [[Sotheby's]] auction house in [[Beverly Hills]] for an auction benefiting the [[Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund]] and Southern California's Aid For AIDS. It was sold to an unidentified Asprey client<ref>{{cite news|title=Heart Of The Matter|last=Van Der Voort|first=Jane|date=February 11, 2001|work=The Toronto Sun|page=}}{{page needed|date=February 2014}}</ref> for $1.4 million, under the agreement that [[Celine Dion]] would wear it two nights later at the [[70th Academy Awards|1998 Academy Awards]] ceremony.

He argued that dismissing ''Titanic'' as fodder for 15-year-old girls fails to consider the film's accomplishment: \"that [this] grandiose, 3+ hour historical romantic drama is a film for everyone\u2014including teenage boys.\" Meslow stated that despite the film being ranked high by males under the age of 18, matching the ratings for teenage boy-targeted films like ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'', it is common for boys and men to deny liking ''Titanic''. He acknowledged his own rejection of the film as a child while secretly loving it. \"It's this collection of elements\u2014the history, the romance, the action\u2014that made (and continues to make) ''Titanic'' an irresistible proposition for audiences of all ages across the globe,\" he stated. \"''Titanic'' has flaws, but for all its legacy, it's better than its middlebrow reputation would have you believe.

Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, the film is based on accounts of the [[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking]] of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']], and stars [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and [[Kate Winslet]] as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated [[maiden voyage]].\n\nCameron's inspiration for the film came from his fascination with [[shipwreck]]s; he felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster. Production began in 1995, when Cameron shot footage of the actual [[Wreck of the RMS Titanic|''Titanic'' wreck]]. The modern scenes on the research vessel'' ''were shot on board the ''[[Akademik Mstislav Keldysh]]'', which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. [[Scale model]]s, [[computer-generated imagery]], and a reconstruction of the ''Titanic'' built at [[Baja Studios]] were used to re-create the sinking. The film was co-financed by [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[20th Century Fox]]; the former handled distribution in North America while the latter released the film internationally. It was the [[List of most expensive films|most expensive film ever made]] at the time, with a production budget of $200&nbsp;million.\n\nUpon its release on December 19, 1997, ''Titanic'' achieved significant critical and commercial success. Nominated for 14 [[Academy Awards]], it tied ''[[All About Eve]]'' (1950)<!-- NOTE: La La Land (film) does not belong in the lead (introduction) of this article.

With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84 billion, ''Titanic'' was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark, and became [[Timeline of highest-grossing films|the highest-grossing film ever at the time]],<!-- Although the film was released in 1997, it became the highest-grossing in 1998. DO NOT CHANGE THIS.--> until Cameron's ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' surpassed it in 2010. A [[3D film|3D]] version of ''Titanic,'' released on April 4, 2012, to commemorate the centennial of the sinking, earned it an additional $343.6 million worldwide, pushing the film's worldwide total to $2.18 billion and making it the second film to gross more than $2 billion worldwide (after ''Avatar'').

They recover a safe containing a drawing of a young woman wearing only the necklace dated April 14, 1912, the day the ship struck the iceberg.{{refn|Although the ''Titanic'' hit the iceberg on April 14, it did not sink until the early hours of April 15.|group = Note}} Rose Dawson Calvert, the woman in the drawing, is brought aboard ''Keldysh'' and tells Lovett of her experiences aboard ''Titanic''.\n\nIn 1912 [[Southampton]], 17-year-old first-class passenger Rose DeWitt Bukater, her fianc\u00e9 Cal Hockley, and her mother Ruth board the luxurious ''Titanic''. Ruth emphasizes that Rose's marriage will resolve their family's financial problems and allow them to retain their upper-class status. Distraught over the engagement, Rose climbs over the stern and contemplates suicide; Jack Dawson, a poor artist, intervenes and discourages her. Discovered with Jack, Rose tells a concerned Cal that she was peering over the edge and Jack saved her from falling. Cal becomes indifferent, and it is suggested to him that Jack be rewarded; he invites Jack to dine with them in first-class. Jack and Rose develop a tentative friendship, despite Cal, his valet Spicer Lovejoy, and Ruth, being wary of him. Following dinner, Rose secretly joins Jack at a party in third-class.\n\nAware of Cal and Ruth's disapproval, Rose rebuffs Jack's advances, but later realizes she prefers him over Cal. After rendezvousing on the bow at sunset, Rose takes Jack to her state room; at her request, Jack sketches Rose posing nude wearing Cal's engagement present, the Heart of the Ocean. They evade Lovejoy, and have sex in an automobile inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness the ship's collision with an iceberg and overhear its officers and builder discussing its seriousness.\n\nCal discovers Jack's sketch of Rose and an insulting note from her in his safe along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose attempt to inform Cal of the collision, Cal retaliates by having Lovejoy slip the necklace into Jack's pocket, accusing him of theft. Jack is arrested and restrained in the [[master-at-arms]]' office. Cal puts the necklace in his own coat pocket.\n\nWith the ship sinking, Rose flees Cal and her mother, who has boarded a lifeboat, and frees Jack. On the boat deck, Cal and Jack encourage her to board a lifeboat. While intending only to save himself, Cal claims he can ensure he and Jack get off safely. As her lifeboat lowers, Rose realizes she cannot leave Jack, and jumps back on board. Cal takes Lovejoy's pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first-class dining saloon. After using up his ammunition, he relents. Cal realizes he gave his coat, and consequently the necklace, to Rose. He later boards a lifeboat by carrying a lost child.\n\nAfter braving several obstacles, Jack and Rose return to the boat deck. The lifeboats have departed and passengers are falling to their deaths as the stern rises out of the water. The ship breaks in half, dropping the stern into the water. Jack and Rose climb onto the back of it, and ride it into the ocean. He helps her onto a wooden panel buoyant enough for only one person. He assures her that she will die an old woman, warm in her bed.

He is depicted during the sinking of the ship as standing next to the clock in the first-class smoking room, lamenting his failure to build a strong and safe ship. Although this has become one of the most famous legends of the sinking of the ''Titanic'', this story, which was published in a 1912 book (''Thomas Andrews: Shipbuilder'') and therefore perpetuated, came from John Stewart, a steward on the ship who in fact left the ship in boat no.15 at approximately 1:40&nbsp;a.m.<ref name=\"seaofglass\">ON A SEA OF GLASS: THE LIFE & LOSS OF THE RMS TITANIC\" by Tad Fitch, J.

He was branded a coward by the press and public for surviving the disaster while many women and children had drowned.\n* [[Eric Braeden]] as [[John Jacob Astor IV]]: A first-class passenger whom Rose (correctly) calls the richest man on the ship. The film depicts Astor and his 18-year-old wife [[Madeleine Astor|Madeleine]] ([[Charlotte Chatton]]) as being introduced to Jack by Rose in the first-class dining saloon. During the introduction, Astor asks if Jack is connected to the \"Boston Dawsons\", a question Jack neatly deflects by saying that he is instead affiliated with the [[Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin|Chippewa Falls]] Dawsons. Astor is last seen as the Grand Staircase glass dome implodes and water surges in.\n* [[Bernard Fox (actor)|Bernard Fox]] as [[Archibald Gracie IV|Colonel Archibald Gracie IV]]: The film depicts Gracie making a comment to Cal that \"women and machinery don't mix\", and congratulating Jack for saving Rose from falling off the ship, though he is unaware that it was a suicide attempt. Fox had portrayed [[Frederick Fleet]] in the 1958 film ''[[A Night to Remember (1958 film)|A Night to Remember]]''.\n* [[Michael Ensign]] as [[Benjamin Guggenheim]]: A mining magnate traveling in first-class. He shows off his French mistress Madame Aubert (Fannie Brett) to his fellow passengers while his wife and three daughters wait for him at home.

Lightoller took charge of the port side evacuation. The film depicts Lightoller informing Captain Smith that it will be difficult to see icebergs without breaking water and following the collision suggesting the crew should begin boarding women and children to the lifeboats. He is seen brandishing a gun and threatening to use it to keep order. He can be seen on top of Collapsible B when the first funnel collapses. Lightoller was the most senior officer to have survived the disaster.\n* [[Simon Crane]] as [[Joseph Boxhall|Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall]]: The officer in charge of firing flares and manning Lifeboat 2 during the sinking. He is shown on the bridge wings helping the seamen firing the flares.\n* [[Ioan Gruffudd]] as [[Harold Lowe|Fifth Officer Harold Lowe]]: The ship's only officer to lead a lifeboat to retrieve survivors of the sinking from the icy waters. The film depicts Lowe rescuing Rose.\n* Edward Fletcher as [[James Paul Moody|Sixth Officer James Moody]]: The ship's only junior officer to have died in the sinking. The film depicts Moody admitting Jack and Fabrizio onto the ship only moments before it departs from Southampton. Moody is later shown following [[William McMaster Murdoch|Mr. Murdoch's]] orders to put the ship to full speed ahead, and informs First Officer Murdoch about the iceberg. He is last seen clinging to one of the davits on the starboard side after having unsuccessfully attempted to launch collapsible A.\n* James Lancaster as [[Thomas Byles|Father Thomas Byles]]: Second-class passenger Father Byles, a Catholic priest from England, is portrayed praying and consoling passengers during the ship's final moments.\n* Lew Palter and [[Elsa Raven]] as [[Isidor Straus]] and [[Ida Straus]]: Isidor is a former owner of R.H. Macy and Company, a former congressman from New York, and a member of the New York and New Jersey Bridge Commission.

Lifeboats 1 and 2 were emergency boats with a capacity of 40. Situated at the forward end of the boat deck, these were kept ready to launch in case of a person falling overboard. On the night of the disaster, Lifeboat 1 was the fourth to be launched, with 12 people aboard, including Duff-Gordon, his wife and her secretary. The baronet was much criticized for his conduct during the incident. It was suggested that he had boarded the emergency boat in violation of the \"women and children first\" policy and that the boat had failed to return to rescue those struggling in the water. He offered five pounds to each of the lifeboat's crew, which those critical of his conduct viewed as a bribe. The Duff-Gordons at the time (and his wife's secretary in a letter written at the time and rediscovered in 2007) stated that there had been no women or children waiting to board in the vicinity of the launching of their boat, and there is confirmation that lifeboat 1 of the Titanic was almost empty and that First Officer William Murdoch was apparently glad to offer Duff-Gordon and his wife and her secretary a place (simply to fill it) after they had asked if they could get on. Duff-Gordon denied that his offer of money to the lifeboat crew represented a bribe. The [[British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry into the sinking of the RMS Titanic|British Board of Trade's inquiry into the disaster]] accepted Duff-Gordon's denial of bribing the crew, but maintained that, if the emergency boat had rowed towards the people who were in the water, it might very well have been able to rescue some of them.<ref>''British Wreck Commissioner's Enquiry: Report.'' \"Account of the Saving and Rescue of those who Survived: Conduct of Sir Cosmo Duff Gordon and Mr Ismay\".

They argued the extended length would mean fewer showings, thus less revenue, even though long epics are more likely to help directors win [[Academy Award|Oscars]]. Cameron refused, telling Fox, \"You want to cut my movie? You're going to have to fire me! You want to fire me? You're going to have to kill me!\"<ref name=\"www.ew.com\" /> The executives did not want to start over, because it would mean the loss of their entire investment, but they also initially rejected Cameron's offer of forfeiting his share of the profits as an empty gesture, as they predicted profits would be unlikely.<ref name=\"www.ew.com\" />\n\nCameron explained forfeiting his share as complex. \"...{{nbsp}}the short version is that the film cost proportionally much more than ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day|T2]]'' and ''[[True Lies]].'' Those films went up seven or eight percent from the initial budget. ''Titanic'' also had a large budget to begin with, but it went up a lot more,\" he said. \"As the producer and director, I take responsibility for the studio that's writing the checks, so I made it less painful for them. I did that on two different occasions. They didn't force me to do it; they were glad that I did.\"<ref name=\"www.industrycentral.net\" />\n\n==Post-production==\n\n===Effects===\nCameron wanted to push the boundary of special effects with his film, and enlisted [[Digital Domain]] and [[Pacific Data Images]] to continue the developments in digital technology which the director pioneered while working on ''[[The Abyss]]'' and ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]''. Many previous films about the RMS ''Titanic'' shot water in [[slow motion]], which did not look wholly convincing.<ref name=\"unreality\">Marsh and Kirkland, pp. 147\u2013154</ref> Cameron encouraged his crew to shoot their {{convert|45|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[Scale model|miniature]] of the ship as if \"we're making a commercial for the White Star Line\".<ref>Marsh and Kirkland, p. 65</ref> Afterwards, digital water and smoke were added, as were extras captured on a [[motion capture]] stage. Visual effects supervisor Rob Legato scanned the faces of many actors, including himself and his children, for the digital extras and stuntmen. There was also a {{convert|65|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} model of the ship's stern that could break in two repeatedly, the only miniature to be used in water.<ref name=\"unreality\" /> For scenes set in the ship's engines, footage of the [[SS Jeremiah O'Brien|SS ''Jeremiah O'Brien''{{'}}s]] engines were composited with miniature support frames, and actors shot against a [[chroma key|greenscreen]].<ref>{{cite video | title = VFX Shot Breakdown | medium = DVD | publisher = 20th Century Fox |year = 2005}}</ref> In order to save money, the first-class lounge was a miniature set incorporated into a greenscreen backdrop behind the actors.<ref>{{cite video | title = VFX How To For First Class Lounge | medium = DVD | publisher = 20th Century Fox |year = 2005}}</ref> The miniature of the Lounge would later be crushed to simulate the destruction of the room and a scale model of a First-Class corridor flooded with jets of water while the camera pans out.<ref>{{cite video | title = VFX How To Flood A First Class Corridor | medium = DVD | publisher = 20th Century Fox |year = 2005}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Titanic breaks in half.jpg|thumb|left|300px|alt=The Titanic about to sink into the ocean, with the ship breaking into two parts and with smoke still coming out of the funnels.|Unlike previous ''Titanic'' films, Cameron's retelling of the disaster showed the ship breaking into two pieces before sinking entirely. The scenes were an account of the moment's most likely outcome.]]\n\nAn enclosed {{convert|5000000|usgal|L|adj=mid}} tank was used for sinking interiors, in which the entire set could be tilted into the water. In order to sink the Grand Staircase, {{convert|90000|usgal|L}} of water were dumped into the set as it was lowered into the tank. Unexpectedly, the waterfall ripped the staircase from its steel-reinforced foundations, although no one was hurt. The {{convert|744|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} exterior of the RMS ''Titanic'' had its first half lowered into the tank, but as the heaviest part of the ship it acted as a [[shock absorber]] against the water; to get the set into the water, Cameron had much of the set emptied and even smashed some of the promenade windows himself. After submerging the dining saloon, three days were spent shooting Lovett's [[remotely operated vehicle|ROV]] traversing the wreck in the present.<ref name=\"heart\" /> The post-sinking scenes in the freezing Atlantic were shot in a {{convert|350000|usgal|L|adj=mid}} tank,<ref name=\"water\">Marsh and Kirkland, pp. 161\u2013168</ref> where the frozen corpses were created by applying on actors a powder that crystallized when exposed to water, and wax was coated on hair and clothes.<ref name=\"blueprint\" />\n\nThe climactic scene, which features the breakup of the ship directly before it sinks as well as its final plunge to the bottom of the Atlantic, involved a tilting full-sized set, 150 extras, and 100 stunt performers. Cameron criticized previous ''Titanic'' films for depicting the liner's final plunge as a graceful slide underwater. He \"wanted to depict it as the terrifyingly chaotic event that it really was\".<ref name=\"www.media-awareness.ca\" /> When carrying out the sequence, people needed to fall off the increasingly tilting deck, plunging hundreds of feet below and bouncing off of railings and propellers on the way down. A few attempts to film this sequence with stunt people resulted in some minor injuries, and Cameron halted the more dangerous stunts. The risks were eventually minimized \"by using computer generated people for the dangerous falls\".<ref name=\"www.media-awareness.ca\" />\n\n===Editing===\nThere was one \"crucial historical fact\" Cameron chose to omit from the film \u2013 the [[SS Californian|SS ''Californian'']] was close to the ''Titanic'' the night she sank but had turned off its radio for the night, did not hear her crew's [[SOS]] calls, and did not respond to their distress flares. \"Yes, the [SS] ''Californian.'' That wasn't a compromise to mainstream filmmaking. That was really more about emphasis, creating an emotional truth to the film,\" stated Cameron. He said there were aspects of retelling the sinking that seemed important in pre- and post-production, but turned out to be less important as the film evolved. \"The story of the ''Californian'' was in there; we even shot a scene of them switching off their Marconi radio set,\" said Cameron. \"But I took it out. It was a clean cut, because it focuses you back onto that world. If ''Titanic'' is powerful as a metaphor, as a microcosm, for the end of the world in a sense, then that world must be self-contained.\"<ref name=\"www.industrycentral.net\" />\n\nDuring the first assembly cut, Cameron altered the planned ending, which had given resolution to Brock Lovett's story. In the original version of the ending, Brock and Lizzy see the elderly Rose at the stern of the boat and fear she is going to commit suicide. Rose then reveals that she had the \"Heart of the Ocean\" diamond all along but never sold it, in order to live on her own without Cal's money. She tells Brock that life is priceless and throws the diamond into the ocean, after allowing him to hold it. After accepting that treasure is worthless, Brock laughs at his stupidity. Rose then goes back to her cabin to sleep, whereupon the film ends in the same way as the final version. In the editing room, Cameron decided that by this point, the audience would no longer be interested in Brock Lovett and cut the resolution to his story, so that Rose is alone when she drops the diamond. He also did not want to disrupt the audience's melancholy after the ''Titanic''{{'s}} sinking.<ref>{{cite video | people = James Cameron | title = Alternate Ending Commentary | medium = DVD | publisher = 20th Century Fox |year = 2005}}</ref> Paxton agreed that his scene with Brock's epiphany and laugh was unnecessary, stating that \"I would have shot heroin to make the scene work better ...you didn't really need anything from us. Our job was done by then ... If you're smart and you take the ego and the narcissism out of it, you'll listen to the film, and the film will tell you what it needs and what it does not need\".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/bill-paxton-on-the-alternate-ending-of-titanic-audiences-didnt-see-in-1997-150538039.html | title=Bill Paxton on the Alternate Ending of 'Titanic' That Audiences Didn't See in 1997 | first=Will | last=Lerner | date=February 27, 2017 | publisher=Yahoo!

Lovejoy goes after the pair in the sinking first-class dining room. Just as they are about to escape him, Lovejoy notices Rose's hand slap the water as it slips off the table behind which she is hiding. In revenge for framing him for the \"theft\" of the necklace, Jack attacks him and smashes his head against a glass window, which explains the gash on Lovejoy's head that can be seen when he dies in the completed version of the film. In their reactions to the scene, test audiences said it would be unrealistic to risk one's life for wealth, and Cameron cut it for this reason, as well as for timing and pacing reasons. Many other scenes were cut for similar reasons.<ref name=\"Deleted scene commentaries\" />\n\n===Music and soundtrack===\n{{Main|Titanic: Music from the Motion Picture|Back to Titanic}}\n{{listen|filename=|title=Excerpt from \"''Hymn to the Sea''\"|description=Featuring the vocals of [[Sissel Kyrkjeb\u00f8]], this is a recurring somber theme that is associated with the tragic elements of ''Titanic''|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nCameron wrote ''Titanic'' while listening to the work of Irish new-age musician [[Enya]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-jan-15-ca-8361-story.html|title=Soundtrack to 'Titanic' Rises to No. 1|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2019-06-17|language=en-US}}</ref> He offered Enya the chance to compose for the film, but she declined.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/irelands-enya-on-how-life-by-the-sea-influenced-her-music-1458056146|title=Ireland\u2019s Enya on How Life by the Sea Influenced Her Music|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=2019-06-17|language=en-US}}</ref> Cameron instead chose [[James Horner]] to compose the film's score.

Asprey & Garrard produced and designed the necklaces: the result was three different and unique designs. Two of their designs were used in the film while the other went unused until after the film had been released. The three necklaces are commonly known as the original prop, the J. Peterman necklace, and the Asprey necklace. The three necklaces are all very similar but have distinguishable differences.\n\t \nThe third and final design was not used in the film. After the film's success, [[Asprey & Garrard]] were commissioned to create an authentic Heart of the Ocean necklace using the original design. The result was a platinum-set, {{convert|171|carat|g|adj=on}} heart-shaped Ceylon [[sapphire]] surrounded by 103 diamonds.<ref name=\"oocities\" />  This design featured a much larger inverted pear shaped Ceylon sapphire with a subtle cleft to resemble a heart. The chain for this necklace also featured a mix of round, pear, and marquise cut white diamonds. The bail also featured a heart cut white diamond with another round cut diamond attached to an inverted pear shape diamond which was then attached to the cage of the main stone. The necklace was donated to [[Sotheby's]] auction house in [[Beverly Hills]] for an auction benefiting the [[Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund]] and Southern California's Aid For AIDS. It was sold to an unidentified Asprey client<ref>{{cite news|title=Heart Of The Matter|last=Van Der Voort|first=Jane|date=February 11, 2001|work=The Toronto Sun|page=}}{{page needed|date=February 2014}}</ref> for $1.4 million, under the agreement that [[Celine Dion]] would wear it two nights later at the [[70th Academy Awards|1998 Academy Awards]] ceremony.

He argued that dismissing ''Titanic'' as fodder for 15-year-old girls fails to consider the film's accomplishment: \"that [this] grandiose, 3+ hour historical romantic drama is a film for everyone\u2014including teenage boys.\" Meslow stated that despite the film being ranked high by males under the age of 18, matching the ratings for teenage boy-targeted films like ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'', it is common for boys and men to deny liking ''Titanic''. He acknowledged his own rejection of the film as a child while secretly loving it. \"It's this collection of elements\u2014the history, the romance, the action\u2014that made (and continues to make) ''Titanic'' an irresistible proposition for audiences of all ages across the globe,\" he stated. \"''Titanic'' has flaws, but for all its legacy, it's better than its middlebrow reputation would have you believe.

The timber spans on the Prince Alfred Bridge have deteriorated to such an extent that the 1896 side ramp has had to be reinstated, so that most of the northern approach is disused, and has deteriorated to the point where it is closed to vehicular traffic and pedestrians.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe bridge was named for the then reigning [[Queen Victoria]]'s son, Prince [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], and was built to carry the Great Southern Road (now the Hume Highway) across the Murrumbidgee. It has existed in three forms, with only the main spans across the river itself being common to all three.\n\n== History == \n\nThe site was historically known as the \"crossing place\" and is where [[Charles Sturt]] first crossed the Murrumbidgee. It became known in the mid-19th century as the safest location to cross the river. Periodic flooding of the Murrumbidgee had already had detrimental effects on the pioneering settlement of Gundagai, situated on the floodplain. In 1852 almost 100 people were drowned in a severe flood. By 1853 a new town site had been chosen on the high ground north of the floodplain and its main street, Sheridan Street, became part of the [[Great South Road (New South Wales)|Great South Road]], subsequently the original Hume Highway until it was bypassed in 1977.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nOn 30 January 1861 ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' reported that the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly|NSW Legislative Assembly]] had rejected a motion for a road bridge at Gundagai due to lack of funds and lack of evidence of a need. A public meeting was held in September at the Gundagai Court House and resolutions from the meeting together with a subsequent petition from the district were forwarded to [[Sydney]] for consideration by the [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]].<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nThe river crossing had become a major obstacle for travellers and teams following the [[Hamilton Hume|Hume]] and [[William Hovell|Hovell]] route to the [[Riverina]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and there had been regular petitions and deputations to the Colonial Government for a bridge. Successive governments deferred on the grounds of low traffic flows and the high cost of any bridge project to cross the half-mile flood plain, but political and commercial factors forced the Government's hand. The merchants at [[Wagga Wagga]] favoured trade with Victoria since that colony's railway had reached [[Echuca]] in 1864, and they accused the distant Sydney-based Government of neglect. They formed a joint-stock company and built a substantial three span timber bridge over the [[Murrumbidgee River]] in order to direct traffic from the surrounding districts through the town. It was reported that as a financial speculation the bridge has proved successful. A similar bridge had been erected over the [[Murray River]] at [[Albury]]. The NSW Government was forced to act in order to turn the flow of wealth towards Sydney. Not only was a bridge planned, but an expensive iron structure was approved as a clear indication to the south-western districts of the Government's legitimate interests in those regions.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nIn late 1861, the Government placed [[Australian pound|A\u00a3]]24,000 in the estimates for a modest scheme with a short viaduct, which would have left the floodplain impassable during a flood. However, in 1864 the estimate was increased to A\u00a337,000 for the whole river flat to be bridged. The Prince Alfred Bridge over the Murrumbidgee River was opened on 24 October 1867 and named after [[Queen Victoria]]'s second son who was touring Australia that year. It was the first metal truss bridge to be built in NSW. A short sloping viaduct descended to join the road over the river flats until the long timber viaduct was complete in 1869.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nIn England in 1848, [[James Warren (engineer)|James Warren]] and [[Willoughby Monzani]] had obtained a British [[patent]] for a configuration of repetitive equilateral triangles that could support a road on either its top or bottom chord. [[Warren truss|Warren's name became synonymous]] with this form. The first major spans using this configuration were built in England, and English construction firms built prefabricated versions for use in the British colonies, especially India. Thomas Kennard then applied a more detailed analysis of the stress distribution, allowing further economy in the use of iron by varying the cross-sectional area of the top and bottom chords without adversely affecting strength. Kennard patented his invention in 1853, and it was the Warren and Kennard patent that was used by Bennett in his design of the Prince Alfred Bridge.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nAccording to Bennett, the Warren girder had been adopted, because it required the least workmanship on the ground, and because of the rapidity with which it could be erected, incurring least risk from the violent floods of the Murrumbidgee during construction. However, Bennett, along with many other engineers of his day, considered the lattice truss superior. The main objection to the Warren truss was that all the strains are taken by a single pin, whereas in the lattice system the strain is divided amongst a number of rivets instead. Francis Bell, the contractor, also preferred the wrought iron lattice, which, he said, could be imported from England and launched into position very economically. For these (among other) reasons, very few Warren truss bridges were constructed during this period.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> The iron for the superstructure was furnished by Messrs Lloyds, Fosters, and Company's Wednesbury, Old Park Ironworks in Staffordshire, and was inspected by eminent engineer Mr. Fowler. Testing of the wrought iron was conducted, and the strength was found to be much in excess of the specification. The testing in England of the first span for the bridge was also reported as very satisfactory; the deflection with a load did not exceed an inch.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nIn 1848, three Sydney businessmen had joined a local man in an attempt to exploit the iron resources of the [[Nattai, New South Wales|Nattai]] district, which became the Fitzroy Ironworks. The Fitzroy Ironworks were the first ironworks in Australia, but their story is one of persistent failure over half a century despite numerous and repeated ambitious, entrepreneurial and optimistic attempts. For finished products (cast or rolled), land or water transport to an English port plus sea freight to Sydney were less than the cost of cartage between [[Mittagong]] and Sydney. Pig iron, also, could not compete against British iron, mostly brought out as ballast in wool ships.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nThe Prince Alfred Bridge, with the [[Denison Bridge]] at [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], has the distinction of being one of only two early Australian bridges that contained Australian iron. While the iron for the piers of Denison Bridge at Bathurst was cast at P. N. Russell & Co's Foundry in Sydney from pig iron obtained from the Fitzroy Ironworks, the cast iron piers at Gundagai were cast by the Fitzroy Ironworks from largely local iron. The piers are therefore a rare example of a substantial finished product produced completely by the Fitzroy Ironworks at Mittagong.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nThe four pairs of cast iron cylindrical columns for the piers were made at the [[Fitzroy Iron Works]] in 56 sections. Each was {{convert|6|ft|m|0|order=flip|spell=on}} long, {{convert|6|ft|m|0|order=flip|spell=on}} in diameter, with a {{convert|1.125|inch|mm|0|order=flip|adj=on}} wall thickness and each weighed approximately {{convert|2|ST|t LT|spell=on|order=flip}}. They were delivered by [[Ox|bullock]] drays, although delays occurred in carting the cylinders to Gundagai because scarcity of feed and water between [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]] and Gundagai deterred carriers from undertaking the work.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nWhen a {{convert|6|ft|m|0|adj=on|order=flip}} section of cylinder was placed in its required position, the material inside and under the cutting edge was excavated by hand, causing the cylinder to sink under its own weight. As the cylinder descended, additional lengths were added with internal bolted connections until the necessary depth or foundation had been reached. The hollow cylinder was then filled with rubble consisting of red sandy soil with the odd stone. An immense amount of difficulty was at first experienced in reaching the necessary depth; borings to a great depth had to be made, through huge masses of timber brought down by floods in bygone ages, but the indomitable energy of the superintending engineer, Frederick Augustus Franklin, overcame every obstacle. Franklin, who worked for Francis Bell, was well regarded and gained the cordial good wishes and esteem of the people of Gundagai by his work.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nThe design for the three iron truss spans of the Prince Alfred Bridge are based on the British pin-jointed Warren and Kennard trusses, and have the unique feature of the trusses being suspended from a continuous horizontal top chord, supported on roller bearings on vertical posts at each pier. The end roller detail has five rollers placed between the extended upper chord and a pillar which rises from the pier top. A similar detail is provided at the central pier, where each upper chord is continued from one span to the next across a nest of rollers. The Warren truss, as originally patented, consisted of a configuration of repetitive equilateral triangles but the Prince Alfred Bridge has additional verticals at each cross girder location, designed to provide lateral support to the top chord. It and the railway truss downstream (constructed more than 30 years later) are two of only three pin-jointed metal trusses remaining in NSW - the other is the Whipple truss road bridge at [[Nowra, New South Wales|Nowra]].<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nThe deck on the truss spans originally consisted of two {{convert|2|inch|cm|0|adj=on|order=flip}} thick layers of diagonal decking, the upper layer being approximately at right angles to the lower layer. The deck was finished with a light curved iron kerb, similar to the kerb which still exists on Denison Bridge (see photo). This arrangement of deck for the truss spans was retained when [[Percy Allan]] designed the new northern viaduct which was constructed in 1898, but by 1932, there was just a single layer of transverse decking on the truss spans similar to the viaduct approaches, and a timber kerb rather than the original iron kerb.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nBy 1932, it was thought that, \"the iron spans, then being sixty-five years old, could hardly be relied upon for a further period of service much in excess of thirty years (the average expected life of a timber girder span as used on viaducts), which would bring them to an age of practically 100 years. Apart from not being heavy enough to carry the present-day standard bridge loading, old age had probably affected the iron and caused some loss of strength.\" However, after considering a number of options for a new bridge it was admitted that, 'It was plain that the existing iron trusses, though light and of unusual design, viewed from the aspect of modern structural practice, were in good order and were capable of rendering efficient service for the life of at least one more timber approach.'<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nSince that time, the timber deck has changed arrangement a number of times, and the ironwork has been painted with a number of different systems (originally white, now grey). In the early 1960s a footway was added to one side of the bridge, which remains today. Good design and quality construction have given a durable bridge able to carry much heavier loads that originally intended or foreseen, and for much longer than had been imagined.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nLocated on the main Sydney to [[Melbourne]] route, the Prince Alfred Bridge carried huge volumes of traffic in its lifetime until 1977 when the Hume Highway was realigned to bypass Gundagai with the construction of Sheahan Bridge. The Prince Alfred Bridge continued to carry local traffic over the Murrumbidgee River between North and South Gundagai;<ref name=nswshr-2022/> until it was declared unsafe for vehicular and pedestrian traffic.\n\n== Description == \nThe Prince Alfred Bridge over the Murrumbidgee River is a three [[Span (architecture)|span]], [[wrought iron]], pin jointed Warren [[truss]] on cast iron cylindrical [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]. A Warren truss, as originally patented, consists of a configuration of repetitive equilateral triangles that support a road on either the top or bottom chord. The [[trusses]] of the Prince Alfred Bridge have additional verticals at each cross girder location, designed to provide lateral support to the top chord. The trusses are suspended from a continuous horizontal top chord, supported on a nest of five rollers located on vertical pillars attached to the top of each pier. The four cylindrical cast iron piers are filled with soil and stones. The trusses support a timber deck, which carries two lanes of traffic. Longitudinal timber sheeting was added to the deck in 1959, and a footway was added on the outside of the truss in the early 1960s.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nAs opened in 1867 the bridge had a total length of {{Convert|1030|ft|m|0|order=flip}}, consisting of three wrought iron truss spans each of {{Convert|103|ft|m|0|order=flip}} across the river, two timber southern approach spans each of {{Convert|30|ft|m|0|order=flip}}, and twenty-three timber northern approach spans each of {{Convert|30|ft|m|0|order=flip}}, rising on a gradient of 1 in 30 from the level of the floodplain.<ref name=mr>{{cite journal|title=The Murrumbidgee River Bridge at Gundagai, 1865-1932|url=https://www.opengov.nsw.gov.au/publications/15912|website=Open Gov NSW|publisher=Dept of Main Roads|volume=3|issue=6|pages=86\u201389|date=February 1932}}</ref><!-- math doesn't work on those sums --><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60819964 |title=NEW BRIDGE OVER THE MURRUMBIDGEE, AT GUNDAGAI, NEW SOUTH WALES. |newspaper=[[The Illustrated Australian News|Illustrated Australian News for Home Readers]] |issue=125 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=26 November 1867 |page=12 |via=Trove, [[National Library of Australia]] }}</ref>\n\nIt was the first iron truss bridge to be built in New South Wales,<ref name=\"RTAPrinceAlfredBridge\"/> The pin-jointed [[Warren truss]] section is the second-oldest metal truss bridge in Australia.

There is minor section loss due to corrosion, but the loss is not substantially affecting the load carrying capacity of the bridge. A few of the iron castings supporting the cross girders are broken. The portions of the cast iron piers which are below water have been subject to graphitisation (a form of corrosion leading to loss of strength), as is common in cast iron river piers. This does affect capacity, but is not yet causing signs of distress for this bridge. Archaeological potential is low.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\n=== Further information === \n\nThe integrity of the Prince Alfred Bridges is excellent. The original cast iron piers and wrought iron trusses are clearly visible. Although the arrangement of the deck has changed over the years, it is still timber as it was originally. The footway added in the 1960s restricts views to the trusses from some viewing angles. Timber deck changes throughout the life of the bridge (both fabric and form), addition of footway in early 1960s, repainting throughout the life of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-2022/>\n\n== Heritage listing == \n\nAs at 13 April 2016, the Prince Alfred Bridge is of State heritage significance for its historical values as the first iron truss bridge to be built in New South Wales and the second-oldest metal truss bridge remaining in Australia. In addition it is of significance for its rarity as it is one of only three pin jointed metal trusses remaining in New South Wales. Its historical values include the fact that the cast iron piers were cast in at the Fitzroy Iron Works, the first ironworks in Australia, chiefly from local ores. The Bridge and the piers therefore provides an irreplaceable source of information on the quality and techniques used by Australia's first ironworks and demonstrate the technical achievements of the colony of NSW in producing its own iron. The construction of the bridge was a significant development in the history and development of NSW as it provided easy access to Sydney therefore channeling the resources and wealth of the Riverena district north to Sydney to the benefit of New South Wales rather than south to Melbourne and Victoria<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nThe state level heritage significance of the Prince Alfred Bridge is enhanced through its important association with inland road transport and communications between Sydney and Melbourne. The bridge is also associated with a visit to Australia by the Duke of Edinburgh in 1867 afterwhom the bridge was named. In addition the bridge is associated with two eminent engineers, William Christopher Bennett the designer and Francis Bell the Contractor.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nTechnically the bridge is of state heritage significance as it demonstrates some unique engineering elements such as the support arrangements, consisting of vertical pillars at each pier, having the trusses suspended from the top chords, resting on a nest of roller bearings. The Prince Alfred Bridge is of state heritage significance for its landmark qualities as an integral part of the overall historic vista which includes the iron bridge, the long timber viaduct and adjacent rail bridge. These are a widely recognisable part of the built environment in Gundagai and have a place in the experience and memories of travellers between Sydney and Melbourne from its opening in 1867 until its closure in 1977.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nThe Prince Alfred Bridge is of state heritage significance for its special value to the engineering profession, particularly for the history of metal bridge design and construction in New South Wales.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nPrince Alfred Bridge was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 5 July 2019 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.''' \n\nThe Prince Alfred Bridge - iron road bridge is lof state heritage significance as it is the second-oldest metal truss bridge in Australia and the oldest in NSW. It formed part of the longest bridge in New South Wales ({{convert|3025|ft|m|0|order=flip}}) until the completion of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] in 1932. The Prince Alfred Bridge is important in the history of the development of inland road transport and provides evidence of significant early engineering activity in the Riverina. It also demonstrates the early importance of the Sydney to Melbourne route.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.''' \n\nThe state heritage significance of the bridge is enhanced through its associated with two eminent engineers William Christopher Bennet and Francis Bell.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nWilliam Christopher Bennett, Irish born engineer, designed the iron bridge. After arriving in Australia Bennett quickly rose to the position of Commissioner and Chief Engineer in the Roads Department (appointed in 1860), a position he retained until 1889. Bennett and his Department constructed 16,000km of road and 64 km of bridges. In addition to his prodigious work on roads and bridges in New South Wales, Bennett also made a significant contribution to navigation, water supply and sewerage works.In 1872 Sir [[Henry Parkes]] commended Bennett and his work with the department sayying he was \"one of the ablest officers in the government service\"<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nFrancis Bell was another engineer who was born in Ireland By 1853 Bell had migrated to Australia, and was first involved in a number of significant engineering projects in Victoria. His expertise was such that he was often requested to give evidence to the Victorian Royal Commissions on the River and Harbour Trust, to Select Committees on the Railway Department and the [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central Railway Terminus]]. He was involved in constructing a number of iron truss bridges including the earliest substantial metal truss bridge in Australia, the Hawthorne Bridge over the [[Yarra River|Yarra]] in Melbourne. Bell was City Engineer for the [[City of Sydney]] from 1871 to 1879, and was a member of the Sewerage and Health Board.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.''' \n\nThe Prince Alfred Bridge is of state heritage significance as is an important work of a prominent designer, William Christopher Bennett, who made use of the design technology that was patented in England less than 15 years before the opening of the bridge (1853 the Warren and Kennard patent). Bennett's innovations include the support arrangements for the trusses, consisting of vertical pillars at each pier to support the trusses from the top chord, and the introduction of additional vertical elements designed to provide lateral support to the top chord. The Prince Alfred Bridge also demonstrates the technical achievements of the colony of New South Wales in discovering, mining, smelting and manufacturing the cast iron piers.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nThe Prince Alfred Bridge is of state heritage significance for its landmark qualities as an integral part of the overall historic vista which includes the iron bridge, the long timber viaduct and adjacent rail bridge. These are a widely recognisable part of the built environment in Gundagai and have a place in the experience and memories of travellers between Sydney and Melbourne from its opening in 1867 until its closure in 1977.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.''' \n\nThe item is of state heritage significance as it has special value to the engineering profession throughout the state, as demonstrated by the Engineers Australia Historic Engineering Marker. It also has a special association with travellers between Sydney and Melbourne, having carried Hume Highway traffic for over 100 years. Since the realignment of the Highway in 1977, the historic features of the bridge with its viaduct have been successfully promoted such that it, along with the rail bridge and its viaduct, is a prominent tourist attraction.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.''' \n\nIt meets this criterion of State significance because the cast iron cylinders for the piers were made with the earliest Australian iron, cast in The Fitzroy Ironworks which were the first ironworks in Australia. The pier cylinders are therefore an irreplaceable source of information on the quality and techniques of Australia's first ironworks.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.''' \n\nThe bridge is of state heritage significance as it is one of only two early Australian bridges built with Australian iron (Denison Bridge at Bathurst is the other). It is also one of only three pin jointed metal trusses still extant in NSW (the others being the Whipple truss road bridge at Nowra and the Gundagai rail bridge, no longer in use). It is a British pin-jointed truss of a type that did not appear in the USA until the 1880s, and has the unique feature of the trusses being suspended from a continuous horizontal top chord member, supported on roller bearings on vertical pillars at each pier.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.''' \n\nThe Prince Alfred Bridgeis of state heritage significance as it is representative of the engineering excellence of the designer William Christopher Bennett, and of the contractor Francis Bell. While William Christopher Bennett was responsible for the design of many hundreds of bridges in the mid to late 1800s, only very few remain. The bridge is an outstanding example of the designs of William Christopher Bennett, demonstrating his ability in sound structural analysis as well as his willingness to make use of relatively new methods and practices in bridge design.<ref name=nswshr-2022/>\n\n== See also == \n{{stack|{{portal|New South Wales|Engineering}}}}\n* [[List of bridges in Australia]]\n* [[Historic bridges of New South Wales]]\n\n==Gallery==\n{{commons category}}\n{{Gallery\n|title=|footer=\n|File:Gundagai Bridge 1867.jpg|Etching of the new bridge, 1867.\n|file:Gundagai bridge 1885.jpg|The Prince Alfred bridge crosses the Murrumbidgee River at Gundagai, photographed {{circa|1885}}.\n|file:Prince Alfred Bridge.jpg|Prince Alfred Bridge, former [[Hume Highway]].\n}}\n\n== References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Riverina}}\n\n[[Category:1867 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Bridges completed in 1867]]\n[[Category:Road bridges in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Crossings of the Murrumbidgee River]]\n[[Category:Gundagai]]\n[[Category:Truss bridges in Australia]]\n[[Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register]]  \n\n[[Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Wooden bridges in Australia]]\n[[Category:Bridges in the Riverina]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2018}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=January 2018}}\n<!-- [[WP:Units]] -->\n{{Infobox bridge |\n| bridge_name    = Prince Alfred Bridge\n| image          = OldHumeHighway,GundagaiWoodenBridge.jpg\n| image_size = 270px\n| caption = \n| location = Middleton Drive, [[Gundagai, New South Wales|Gundagai]], [[Cootamundra-Gundagai Regional Council]], [[New South Wales]], Australia\n| coordinates    = {{coord|-35.0744|148.1069|region:AU-NSW_type:landmark|display=inline,title|format=dms}}\n| carries        = \n| closed = n.d.

The timber spans on the Prince Alfred Bridge ave deteriorated to such an extent that the 1896 side ramp has had to be reinstated, so that most of the northern approach is disused, and has deteriorated to the point where it is closed to vehicular traffic and pedestrians.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe bridge was named for the then reigning [[Queen Victoria]]'s son, Prince [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], and was built to carry the Great Southern Road (now the Hume Highway) across the Murrumbidgee. It has existed in three forms, with only the main spans across the river itself being common to all three.\n\n== History == \n\nThe site was historically known as the \"crossing place\" and is where [[Charles Sturt]] first crossed the Murrumbidgee. It became known in the mid-19th century as the safest location to cross the river. Periodic flooding of the Murrumbidgee had already had detrimental effects on the pioneering settlement of Gundagai, situated on the floodplain. In 1852 almost 100 people were drowned in a severe flood. By 1853 a new town site had been chosen on the high ground north of the floodplain and its main street, Sheridan Street, became part of the [[Great South Road (New South Wales)|Great South Road]], subsequently the original Hume Highway until it was bypassed in 1977.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nOn 30 January 1861 ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' reported that the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly|NSW Legislative Assembly]] had rejected a motion for a road bridge at Gundagai due to lack of funds and lack of evidence of a need. A public meeting was held in September at the Gundagai Court House and resolutions from the meeting together with a subsequent petition from the district were forwarded to [[Sydney]] for consideration by the [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]].<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nThe river crossing had become a major obstacle for travellers and teams following the [[Hamilton Hume|Hume]] and [[William Hovell|Hovell]] route to the [[Riverina]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and there had been regular petitions and deputations to the Colonial Government for a bridge. Successive governments deferred on the grounds of low traffic flows and the high cost of any bridge project to cross the half-mile flood plain, but political and commercial factors forced the Government's hand. The merchants at [[Wagga Wagga]] favoured trade with Victoria since that colony's railway had reached [[Echuca]] in 1864, and they accused the distant Sydney-based Government of neglect. They formed a joint-stock company and built a substantial three span timber bridge over the [[Murrumbidgee River]] in order to direct traffic from the surrounding districts through the town. It was reported that as a financial speculation the bridge has proved successful. A similar bridge had been erected over the [[Murray River]] at [[Albury]]. The NSW Government was forced to act in order to turn the flow of wealth towards Sydney. Not only was a bridge planned, but an expensive iron structure was approved as a clear indication to the south-western districts of the Government's legitimate interests in those regions.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nIn late 1861, the Government placed [[Australian pound|A\u00a3]]24,000 in the estimates for a modest scheme with a short viaduct, which would have left the floodplain impassable during a flood. However, in 1864 the estimate was increased to A\u00a337,000 for the whole river flat to be bridged. The Prince Alfred Bridge over the Murrumbidgee River was opened on 24 October 1867 and named after [[Queen Victoria]]'s second son who was touring Australia that year. It was the first metal truss bridge to be built in NSW. A short sloping viaduct descended to join the road over the river flats until the long timber viaduct was complete in 1869.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nIn England in 1848, [[James Warren (engineer)|James Warren]] and [[Willoughby Monzani]] had obtained a British [[patent]] for a configuration of repetitive equilateral triangles that could support a road on either its top or bottom chord. [[Warren truss|Warren's name became synonymous]] with this form. The first major spans using this configuration were built in England, and English construction firms built prefabricated versions for use in the British colonies, especially India. Thomas Kennard then applied a more detailed analysis of the stress distribution, allowing further economy in the use of iron by varying the cross-sectional area of the top and bottom chords without adversely affecting strength. Kennard patented his invention in 1853, and it was the Warren and Kennard patent that was used by Bennett in his design of the Prince Alfred Bridge.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nAccording to Bennett, the Warren girder had been adopted, because it required the least workmanship on the ground, and because of the rapidity with which it could be erected, incurring least risk from the violent floods of the Murrumbidgee during construction. However, Bennett, along with many other engineers of his day, considered the lattice truss superior. The main objection to the Warren truss was that all the strains are taken by a single pin, whereas in the lattice system the strain is divided amongst a number of rivets instead. Francis Bell, the contractor, also preferred the wrought iron lattice, which, he said, could be imported from England and launched into position very economically. For these (among other) reasons, very few Warren truss bridges were constructed during this period.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> The iron for the superstructure was furnished by Messrs Lloyds, Fosters, and Company's Wednesbury, Old Park Ironworks in Staffordshire, and was inspected by eminent engineer Mr. Fowler. Testing of the wrought iron was conducted, and the strength was found to be much in excess of the specification. The testing in England of the first span for the bridge was also reported as very satisfactory; the deflection with a load did not exceed an inch.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nIn 1848, three Sydney businessmen had joined a local man in an attempt to exploit the iron resources of the [[Nattai, New South Wales|Nattai]] district, which became the Fitzroy Ironworks. The Fitzroy Ironworks were the first ironworks in Australia, but their story is one of persistent failure over half a century despite numerous and repeated ambitious, entrepreneurial and optimistic attempts. For finished products (cast or rolled), land or water transport to an English port plus sea freight to Sydney were less than the cost of cartage between [[Mittagong]] and Sydney. Pig iron, also, could not compete against British iron, mostly brought out as ballast in wool ships.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nThe Prince Alfred Bridge, with the [[Denison Bridge]] at [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], has the distinction of being one of only two early Australian bridges that contained Australian iron. While the iron for the piers of Denison Bridge at Bathurst was cast at P. N. Russell & Co's Foundry in Sydney from pig iron obtained from the Fitzroy Ironworks, the cast iron piers at Gundagai were cast by the Fitzroy Ironworks from largely local iron. The piers are therefore a rare example of a substantial finished product produced completely by the Fitzroy Ironworks at Mittagong.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nThe four pairs of cast iron cylindrical columns for the piers were made at the [[Fitzroy Iron Works]] in 56 sections. Each was {{convert|6|ft|m|0|order=flip|spell=on}} long, {{convert|6|ft|m|0|order=flip|spell=on}} in diameter, with a {{convert|1.125|inch|mm|0|order=flip|adj=on}} wall thickness and each weighed approximately {{convert|2|ST|t LT|spell=on|order=flip}}. They were delivered by [[Ox|bullock]] drays, although delays occurred in carting the cylinders to Gundagai because scarcity of feed and water between [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]] and Gundagai deterred carriers from undertaking the work.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nWhen a {{convert|6|ft|m|0|adj=on|order=flip}} section of cylinder was placed in its required position, the material inside and under the cutting edge was excavated by hand, causing the cylinder to sink under its own weight. As the cylinder descended, additional lengths were added with internal bolted connections until the necessary depth or foundation had been reached. The hollow cylinder was then filled with rubble consisting of red sandy soil with the odd stone. An immense amount of difficulty was at first experienced in reaching the necessary depth; borings to a great depth had to be made, through huge masses of timber brought down by floods in bygone ages, but the indomitable energy of the superintending engineer, Frederick Augustus Franklin, overcame every obstacle. Franklin, who worked for Francis Bell, was well regarded and gained the cordial good wishes and esteem of the people of Gundagai by his work.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nThe design for the three iron truss spans of the Prince Alfred Bridge are based on the British pin-jointed Warren and Kennard trusses, and have the unique feature of the trusses being suspended from a continuous horizontal top chord, supported on roller bearings on vertical posts at each pier. The end roller detail has five rollers placed between the extended upper chord and a pillar which rises from the pier top. A similar detail is provided at the central pier, where each upper chord is continued from one span to the next across a nest of rollers. The Warren truss, as originally patented, consisted of a configuration of repetitive equilateral triangles but the Prince Alfred Bridge has additional verticals at each cross girder location, designed to provide lateral support to the top chord. It and the railway truss downstream (constructed more than 30 years later) are two of only three pin-jointed metal trusses remaining in NSW - the other is the Whipple truss road bridge at [[Nowra, New South Wales|Nowra]].<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nThe deck on the truss spans originally consisted of two {{convert|2|inch|cm|0|adj=on|order=flip}} thick layers of diagonal decking, the upper layer being approximately at right angles to the lower layer. The deck was finished with a light curved iron kerb, similar to the kerb which still exists on Denison Bridge (see photo). This arrangement of deck for the truss spans was retained when [[Percy Allan]] designed the new northern viaduct which was constructed in 1898, but by 1932, there was just a single layer of transverse decking on the truss spans similar to the viaduct approaches, and a timber kerb rather than the original iron kerb.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nBy 1932, it was thought that, \"the iron spans, then being sixty-five years old, could hardly be relied upon for a further period of service much in excess of thirty years (the average expected life of a timber girder span as used on viaducts), which would bring them to an age of practically 100 years. Apart from not being heavy enough to carry the present-day standard bridge loading, old age had probably affected the iron and caused some loss of strength.\" However, after considering a number of options for a new bridge it was admitted that, 'It was plain that the existing iron trusses, though light and of unusual design, viewed from the aspect of modern structural practice, were in good order and were capable of rendering efficient service for the life of at least one more timber approach.'<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nSince that time, the timber deck has changed arrangement a number of times, and the ironwork has been painted with a number of different systems (originally white, now grey). In the early 1960s a footway was added to one side of the bridge, which remains today. Good design and quality construction have given a durable bridge able to carry much heavier loads that originally intended or foreseen, and for much longer than had been imagined.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nLocated on the main Sydney to [[Melbourne]] route, the Prince Alfred Bridge carried huge volumes of traffic in its lifetime until 1977 when the Hume Highway was realigned to bypass Gundagai with the construction of Sheahan Bridge. The Prince Alfred Bridge continued to carry local traffic over the Murrumbidgee River between North and South Gundagai;<ref name=nswshr-2022/> until it was declared unsafe for vehicular and pedestrian traffic.\n\n== Description == \nThe Prince Alfred Bridge over the Murrumbidgee River is a three [[Span (architecture)|span]], [[wrought iron]], pin jointed Warren [[truss]] on cast iron cylindrical [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]. A Warren truss, as originally patented, consists of a configuration of repetitive equilateral triangles that support a road on either the top or bottom chord. The [[trusses]] of the Prince Alfred Bridge have additional verticals at each cross girder location, designed to provide lateral support to the top chord. The trusses are suspended from a continuous horizontal top chord, supported on a nest of five rollers located on vertical pillars attached to the top of each pier. The four cylindrical cast iron piers are filled with soil and stones. The trusses support a timber deck, which carries two lanes of traffic. Longitudinal timber sheeting was added to the deck in 1959, and a footway was added on the outside of the truss in the early 1960s.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nAs opened in 1867 the bridge had a total length of {{Convert|1030|ft|m|0|order=flip}}, consisting of three wrought iron truss spans each of {{Convert|103|ft|m|0|order=flip}} across the river, two timber southern approach spans each of {{Convert|30|ft|m|0|order=flip}}, and twenty-three timber northern approach spans each of {{Convert|30|ft|m|0|order=flip}}, rising on a gradient of 1 in 30 from the level of the floodplain.<ref name=mr>{{cite journal|title=The Murrumbidgee River Bridge at Gundagai, 1865-1932|url=https://www.opengov.nsw.gov.au/publications/15912|website=Open Gov NSW|publisher=Dept of Main Roads|volume=3|issue=6|pages=86\u201389|date=February 1932}}</ref><!-- math doesn't work on those sums --><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60819964 |title=NEW BRIDGE OVER THE MURRUMBIDGEE, AT GUNDAGAI, NEW SOUTH WALES. |newspaper=[[The Illustrated Australian News|Illustrated Australian News for Home Readers]] |issue=125 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=26 November 1867 |page=12 |via=Trove, [[National Library of Australia]] }}</ref>\n\nIt was the first iron truss bridge to be built in New South Wales,<ref name=\"RTAPrinceAlfredBridge\"/> The pin-jointed [[Warren truss]] section is the second-oldest metal truss bridge in Australia.

There is minor section loss due to corrosion, but the loss is not substantially affecting the load carrying capacity of the bridge. A few of the iron castings supporting the cross girders are broken. The portions of the cast iron piers which are below water have been subject to graphitisation (a form of corrosion leading to loss of strength), as is common in cast iron river piers. This does affect capacity, but is not yet causing signs of distress for this bridge. Archaeological potential is low.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\n=== Further information === \n\nThe integrity of the Prince Alfred Bridges is excellent. The original cast iron piers and wrought iron trusses are clearly visible. Although the arrangement of the deck has changed over the years, it is still timber as it was originally. The footway added in the 1960s restricts views to the trusses from some viewing angles. Timber deck changes throughout the life of the bridge (both fabric and form), addition of footway in early 1960s, repainting throughout the life of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-2022/>\n\n== Heritage listing == \n\nAs at 13 April 2016, the Prince Alfred Bridge is of State heritage significance for its historical values as the first iron truss bridge to be built in New South Wales and the second-oldest metal truss bridge remaining in Australia. In addition it is of significance for its rarity as it is one of only three pin jointed metal trusses remaining in New South Wales. Its historical values include the fact that the cast iron piers were cast in at the Fitzroy Iron Works, the first ironworks in Australia, chiefly from local ores. The Bridge and the piers therefore provides an irreplaceable source of information on the quality and techniques used by Australia's first ironworks and demonstrate the technical achievements of the colony of NSW in producing its own iron. The construction of the bridge was a significant development in the history and development of NSW as it provided easy access to Sydney therefore channeling the resources and wealth of the Riverena district north to Sydney to the benefit of New South Wales rather than south to Melbourne and Victoria<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nThe state level heritage significance of the Prince Alfred Bridge is enhanced through its important association with inland road transport and communications between Sydney and Melbourne. The bridge is also associated with a visit to Australia by the Duke of Edinburgh in 1867 afterwhom the bridge was named. In addition the bridge is associated with two eminent engineers, William Christopher Bennett the designer and Francis Bell the Contractor.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nTechnically the bridge is of state heritage significance as it demonstrates some unique engineering elements such as the support arrangements, consisting of vertical pillars at each pier, having the trusses suspended from the top chords, resting on a nest of roller bearings. The Prince Alfred Bridge is of state heritage significance for its landmark qualities as an integral part of the overall historic vista which includes the iron bridge, the long timber viaduct and adjacent rail bridge. These are a widely recognisable part of the built environment in Gundagai and have a place in the experience and memories of travellers between Sydney and Melbourne from its opening in 1867 until its closure in 1977.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nThe Prince Alfred Bridge is of state heritage significance for its special value to the engineering profession, particularly for the history of metal bridge design and construction in New South Wales.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nPrince Alfred Bridge was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 5 July 2019 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.''' \n\nThe Prince Alfred Bridge - iron road bridge is lof state heritage significance as it is the second-oldest metal truss bridge in Australia and the oldest in NSW. It formed part of the longest bridge in New South Wales ({{convert|3025|ft|m|0|order=flip}}) until the completion of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] in 1932. The Prince Alfred Bridge is important in the history of the development of inland road transport and provides evidence of significant early engineering activity in the Riverina. It also demonstrates the early importance of the Sydney to Melbourne route.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.''' \n\nThe state heritage significance of the bridge is enhanced through its associated with two eminent engineers William Christopher Bennet and Francis Bell.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nWilliam Christopher Bennett, Irish born engineer, designed the iron bridge. After arriving in Australia Bennett quickly rose to the position of Commissioner and Chief Engineer in the Roads Department (appointed in 1860), a position he retained until 1889. Bennett and his Department constructed 16,000km of road and 64 km of bridges. In addition to his prodigious work on roads and bridges in New South Wales, Bennett also made a significant contribution to navigation, water supply and sewerage works.In 1872 Sir [[Henry Parkes]] commended Bennett and his work with the department sayying he was \"one of the ablest officers in the government service\"<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nFrancis Bell was another engineer who was born in Ireland By 1853 Bell had migrated to Australia, and was first involved in a number of significant engineering projects in Victoria. His expertise was such that he was often requested to give evidence to the Victorian Royal Commissions on the River and Harbour Trust, to Select Committees on the Railway Department and the [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central Railway Terminus]]. He was involved in constructing a number of iron truss bridges including the earliest substantial metal truss bridge in Australia, the Hawthorne Bridge over the [[Yarra River|Yarra]] in Melbourne. Bell was City Engineer for the [[City of Sydney]] from 1871 to 1879, and was a member of the Sewerage and Health Board.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.''' \n\nThe Prince Alfred Bridge is of state heritage significance as is an important work of a prominent designer, William Christopher Bennett, who made use of the design technology that was patented in England less than 15 years before the opening of the bridge (1853 the Warren and Kennard patent). Bennett's innovations include the support arrangements for the trusses, consisting of vertical pillars at each pier to support the trusses from the top chord, and the introduction of additional vertical elements designed to provide lateral support to the top chord. The Prince Alfred Bridge also demonstrates the technical achievements of the colony of New South Wales in discovering, mining, smelting and manufacturing the cast iron piers.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nThe Prince Alfred Bridge is of state heritage significance for its landmark qualities as an integral part of the overall historic vista which includes the iron bridge, the long timber viaduct and adjacent rail bridge. These are a widely recognisable part of the built environment in Gundagai and have a place in the experience and memories of travellers between Sydney and Melbourne from its opening in 1867 until its closure in 1977.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.''' \n\nThe item is of state heritage significance as it has special value to the engineering profession throughout the state, as demonstrated by the Engineers Australia Historic Engineering Marker. It also has a special association with travellers between Sydney and Melbourne, having carried Hume Highway traffic for over 100 years. Since the realignment of the Highway in 1977, the historic features of the bridge with its viaduct have been successfully promoted such that it, along with the rail bridge and its viaduct, is a prominent tourist attraction.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.''' \n\nIt meets this criterion of State significance because the cast iron cylinders for the piers were made with the earliest Australian iron, cast in The Fitzroy Ironworks which were the first ironworks in Australia. The pier cylinders are therefore an irreplaceable source of information on the quality and techniques of Australia's first ironworks.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.''' \n\nThe bridge is of state heritage significance as it is one of only two early Australian bridges built with Australian iron (Denison Bridge at Bathurst is the other). It is also one of only three pin jointed metal trusses still extant in NSW (the others being the Whipple truss road bridge at Nowra and the Gundagai rail bridge, no longer in use).

''Singer 2020'' is produced by Hong Tao, and its music director is Hong Kong senior musician [[Kubert Leung]]. The season premiere was first taped on January 3, 2020, and it was announced that the season will be subtitled ''Year of the Hits'' <!--PLS do not change the name-->({{zh|s=\u6b4c\u624b:\u5f53\u6253\u4e4b\u5e74|hp=G\u0113sh\u01d2u:D\u0101ngD\u01ceZh\u012bNi\u00e1n}})<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.8world.com/entertainment/music/article/jamhsiao-1015061|title=\u300a\u6b4c\u624b2020\u300b\u9635\u5bb9\u66dd\u5149\u3000\u8427\u656c\u817e\u60ca\u559c\u56de\u5f52|website=8\u4e16\u754c|date=2019-01-03|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>, and this is the second season to feature returning contestants, after [[Singer 2017|season five]]. The season premiered on February 7, 2020 after facing two postponements, one from January 10 due to some episodes clashing with [[Chinese New Year]], and one on January 31 due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|ongoing Coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ent.sina.com.cn/tv/zy/2020-01-29/doc-iimxxste7519666.shtml|title=\u6e56\u5357\u536b\u89c6\u300a\u6b4c\u624b\u300b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u81f32\u67087\u65e5\u64ad\u51fa|website=Sina|date=2019-01-29|accessdate=2020-01-31}}</ref>.\n\nThis is the first season in the show's history not to feature Return performances, due to health and safety concerns over the coronavirus pandemic happening at the time of taping.\n\n==Competition rules==\nLike the previous seasons of ''I Am a Singer'' and ''Singer'', it features five rounds of two stages, Qualifier and Knockout, with seven singers performing for a 500-member audience each week. The [[electronic voting]], first appeared as a pre-voting twist in [[Singer 2018|season six]] and introduced permanently on [[Singer 2019|season seven]], where voting (up to three votes) was conducted throughout the performance and accounted for 50% of the final score. As such for past seasons, the scores from both weeks are combined to decide the eliminated singer who received the fewest votes. Unlike the last season, separate scores for paper and electronic votes are not revealed.\n\nThe competition revert to the pre-[[I Am a Singer (Chinese season 3)|season three]] format with Challenge rounds (a round which featured a new singer requiring to rank in the top four to avoid elimination) removed, but instead replaced with a variant round known as Surprise, which in-turn functions similarities to the Substituted singers as well. Three new singers were introduced at the start of the Qualifier round and along with the managers; while on backstage, the singers watched their performance while seated with a microphone stand lever. During the performance, a contestant may pull the lever to issue a challenge to the current contestant, but any current contestants are not aware from their existence until the performance ended. After the challenger performed, an electronic vote will immediately conduct with the results being revealed afterwards (previously after the episode prior to the first round). All three Surprise challenges do not need to be performed on a single episode, but challengers must challenge to a singer within the current elimination round. If at least one challenger succeed in the Surprise round, one contestant from the current lineup will be eliminated at the end of the current Knockout round; if multiple challengers succeed, a re-vote will conduct between the successful singers and the singer with a higher vote advance will replace the eliminated singer, but all successful singers, regardless if they lose the revote will be guaranteed a place in the Breakout round. If all three challengers were unsuccessful, all seven contestants are safe from elimination itself. The final round features a small change in which the Challengers were reduced to two, and no re-vote was conducted for multiple successful singers, meaning that the singers are immediately advanced to the competition and eliminations are conducted as usual.\n\nAs the season is subtitled ''Year of the Hits'', the contest is suggested for a pool of younger singing talents with an age range of 18 and 35. Contestants are no longer restricted to the songs selection, and may freely choose a song they composed on their own or on someone else. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://epaper.bbtnews.com.cn/site1/bjsb/html/2020-01/06/content_442354.htm|title=\u9996\u53d1\u9635\u5bb9\u5f15\u4e89\u8bae \u300a\u6b4c\u624b2020\u300b\u9760\u4ec0\u4e48\u201c\u5f53\u6253\u201d |publisher=\u5317\u4eac\u5546\u62a5|author1=\u5362\u626c|author2=\u4f0d\u78a7\u6021|date=2020-01-06|accessdate=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==Contestants==\nThe following ''Singer 2020'' contestants are listed in alphabetical order.

The season premiered on February 7, 2020 after facing two postponements, one from January 10 due to some episodes clashing with [[Chinese New Year]], and one on January 31 due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|ongoing Coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ent.sina.com.cn/tv/zy/2020-01-29/doc-iimxxste7519666.shtml|title=\u6e56\u5357\u536b\u89c6\u300a\u6b4c\u624b\u300b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u81f32\u67087\u65e5\u64ad\u51fa|website=Sina|date=2019-01-29|accessdate=2020-01-31}}</ref>.\n\nThis is the first season in the show's history not to feature Return performances, due to health and safety concerns over the coronavirus pandemic happening at the time of taping.\n\n==Competition rules==\nLike the previous seasons of ''I Am a Singer'' and ''Singer'', it features five rounds of two stages, Qualifier and Knockout, with seven singers performing for a 500-member audience each week. The [[electronic voting]], first appeared as a pre-voting twist in [[Singer 2018|season six]] and introduced permanently on [[Singer 2019|season seven]], where voting (up to three votes) was conducted throughout the performance and accounted for 50% of the final score. As such for past seasons, the scores from both weeks are combined to decide the eliminated singer who received the fewest votes. Unlike the last season, separate scores for paper and electronic votes are not revealed.\n\nThe competition revert to the pre-[[I Am a Singer (Chinese season 3)|season three]] format with Challenge rounds (a round which featured a new singer requiring to rank in the top four to avoid elimination) removed, but instead replaced with a variant round known as Surprise, which in-turn functions similarities to the Substituted singers as well. Three new singers were introduced at the start of the Qualifier round and along with the managers; while on backstage, the singers watched their performance while seated with a microphone stand lever. During the performance, a contestant may pull the lever to issue a challenge to the current contestant, but any current contestants are not aware from their existence until the performance ended. After the challenger performed, an electronic vote will immediately conduct with the results being revealed afterwards (previously after the episode prior to the first round). All three Surprise challenges do not need to be performed on a single episode, but challengers must challenge to a singer within the current elimination round. If at least one challenger succeed in the Surprise round, one contestant from the current lineup will be eliminated at the end of the current Knockout round; if multiple challengers succeed, a re-vote will conduct between the successful singers and the singer with a higher vote advance will replace the eliminated singer, but all successful singers, regardless if they lose the revote will be guaranteed a place in the Breakout round. If all three challengers were unsuccessful, all seven contestants are safe from elimination itself. The final round features a small change in which the Challengers were reduced to two, and no re-vote was conducted for multiple successful singers, meaning that the singers are immediately advanced to the competition and eliminations are conducted as usual.\n\nAs the season is subtitled ''Year of the Hits'', the contest is suggested for a pool of younger singing talents with an age range of 18 and 35. Contestants are no longer restricted to the songs selection, and may freely choose a song they composed on their own or on someone else. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://epaper.bbtnews.com.cn/site1/bjsb/html/2020-01/06/content_442354.htm|title=\u9996\u53d1\u9635\u5bb9\u5f15\u4e89\u8bae \u300a\u6b4c\u624b2020\u300b\u9760\u4ec0\u4e48\u201c\u5f53\u6253\u201d |publisher=\u5317\u4eac\u5546\u62a5|author1=\u5362\u626c|author2=\u4f0d\u78a7\u6021|date=2020-01-06|accessdate=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==Contestants==\nThe following ''Singer 2020'' contestants are listed in alphabetical order.

For every additional 3&nbsp;dB(A), the maximum exposure time is reduced by a factor 2, e.g. 20 hours per week at 88&nbsp;dB(A). Sometimes, a factor of two per additional 5&nbsp;dB(A) is used, however, these occupational regulations are acknowledged by the health literature as inadequate to protect against [[hearing loss]] and other health effects. In an effort to prevent noise-induced hearing loss, many programs and initiative have been created, like the [[Buy Quiet]] program, which encourages employers to purchase quieter tools and equipment, and the [[Safe-In-Sound Award]], which recognizes organizations with successful hearing loss prevention strategies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/buyquiet/default.html|title=CDC - Buy Quiet - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topics|work=cdc.gov|date=2019-01-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.safeinsound.us/|title=Safe-in-Sound: Excellence in Hearing Loss Prevention Award|last=|first=|date=|website=Safe-in-Sound|access-date=July 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith regard to indoor noise pollution in residences, the U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has not set any restrictions on limits to the level of noise.

An example of this would be in dogs, and the noise exposure levels occurring within kennels.  Dogs experience this noise exposure whether it be a long stay at an animal shelter, or a weekend stay at a boarding facility.\n\nOrganizations like [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]] and [[Occupational safety and health|OSHA]] have different regulations when it comes to the noise exposure levels in industrial workers.  Currently there are no regulations related to the noise exposure for dogs even with such damaging effects related to their health.  Health risks dogs are exposed to include ear damage and behavioral changes.\n\nThe average noise exposure in a kennel is greater than 100&nbsp;dB SPL.  According to OSHA these levels would yield in the use of hearing protection for the workers of those kennels due to the risk of noise induced hearing loss.  The anatomical structures of the human and dog ears are very similar, so it is thought that these levels will negatively impact the hearing of canines in kennels. The [[Auditory brainstem response|ABR]] can be used to estimate the hearing threshold of dogd, and can be used to show either a temporary threshold shift or permanent threshold shift after being exposed to excessive sound levels.<ref name=\"Scheifele_2012\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Scheifele P, Martin D, Clark JG, Kemper D, Wells J | title = Effect of kennel noise on hearing in dogs | journal = American Journal of Veterinary Research | volume = 73 | issue = 4 | pages = 482\u20139 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22452494 | doi = 10.2460/ajvr.73.4.482 }}</ref>\n\nBehavioral effects to excessive noise exposure include hiding, urinating, defecating, panting, pacing, drooling, disregard to commands, trembling, and barking.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Noise Phobia in Dog|journal=Veterinary World|volume=1}}</ref> These behavioral patterns pose a much greater problem to canines than meets the eye.

The workers' psychological state could affect the care provided to the dogs.  These loud noise exposures also have the potential to reduce the amount of time that potential adoptive families spend in the facility.  This can result in less dogs being adopted and more time being exposed to excessive sound levels.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Coppola CL, Enns RM, Grandin T | title = Noise in the animal shelter environment: building design and the effects of daily noise exposure | journal = Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u20137 | date = 2006-01-01 | pmid = 16649947 | doi = 10.1207/s15327604jaws0901_1 | hdl = 10217/4405 }}</ref>\n\nTo reduce the level of noise exposure poses a little more difficulty because the majority of the noise is coming from the dogs (barking), but structural changes can be made to the facilities in order to reduce the noise.  Structural changes could include how many dogs are put in one area, more absorbing material rather than metal cages and cement walls and floors, and possibly in the future use of hearing protection devices ([[Hearing protection|HPD]]) for the dogs. All of these structural changes would also benefit the humans involved as well as the use of HPD's (ear plugs).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Aircraft noise]]\n*[[Loud music]]\n*[[Bark (sound)#As nuisance|Nuisance barking]]\n*[[Occupational hearing loss]]\n* [[Noise control]]\n* [[Noise mitigation]]\n* [[Noise pollution]]\n*[[Buy Quiet|Buy quiet]]\n* [[Safe-In-Sound Award]]\n* [[The Mosquito]], an audio  device to discourage loitering\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist|32em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://vimeo.com/155891645 Noise health effects.

Specific birth abnormalities included [[harelip]], [[cleft palate]], and defects in the [[Vertebral column|spine]].<ref name=\"auto\">''Noise: A Health Problem'' United States [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], Office of Noise Abatement and Control, Washington, D.C. 20460, August, 1978</ref>\n\nAccording to Lester W. Sontag of The Fels Research Institute (as presented in the same EPA study): \u201cThere is ample evidence that environment has a role in shaping the physique, behavior, and function of animals, including man, from [[Conception (biology)|conception]] and not merely from [[birth]]. The [[fetus]] is capable of perceiving sounds and responding to them by motor activity and cardiac rate change.\" The effects of noise exposure are highest when it occurs between 15 and 60 days after conception, a period in which major internal [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] and the [[central nervous system]] are formed.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nLater developmental effects occur as vasoconstriction in the mother reduces blood flow and therefore [[oxygen]] and nutrition to the fetus. Low birth weights and noise were also associated with lower levels of certain [[hormone]]s in the mother. These hormones are thought to affect fetal growth and to be good indicators of [[protein]] production. The difference between the hormone levels of pregnant mothers in noisy versus quiet areas increased as birth approached.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nIn a 2000 publication, a review of studies on birthweight and noise exposure note that while some older studies suggest that when women are exposed to >65&nbsp;dB aircraft noise a small decrease in birthweight occurs, in a more recent study of 200 Taiwanese women including noise dosimetry measurements of individual noise exposure, the authors found no significant association between noise exposure and birth weight after adjusting for relevant confounders, e.g. social class, maternal weight gain during pregnancy, etc.<ref name=\"pmid10698728\"/>\n\n===Cognitive development===\n\nWhen young children are regularly exposed to levels of noise that interfere with speech, they may develop speech or reading difficulties, because auditory processing functions are compromised.

For every additional 3&nbsp;dB(A), the maximum exposure time is reduced by a factor 2, e.g. 20 hours per week at 88&nbsp;dB(A). Sometimes, a factor of two per additional 5&nbsp;dB(A) is used, however, these occupational regulations are acknowledged by the health literature as inadequate to protect against [[hearing loss]] and other health effects. In an effort to prevent noise-induced hearing loss, many programs and initiative have been created, like the [[Buy Quiet]] program, which encourages employers to purchase quieter tools and equipment, and the [[Safe-In-Sound Award]], which recognizes organizations with successful hearing loss prevention strategies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/buyquiet/default.html|title=CDC - Buy Quiet - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topics|work=cdc.gov|date=2019-01-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.safeinsound.us/|title=Safe-in-Sound: Excellence in Hearing Loss Prevention Award|last=|first=|date=|website=Safe-in-Sound|access-date=July 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith regard to indoor noise pollution in residences, the U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has not set any restrictions on limits to the level of noise. Rather, it has provided a list of recommended levels in its ''Model Community Noise Control Ordinance'', which was published in 1975. For instance, the recommended noise level for indoor residences is less than or equal to 45&nbsp;dB.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Williams | first1 = Luanne Kemp | last2 = Langley | first2 = Rick L. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Environmental Health Secrets |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |location=Philadelphia |year=2000 |isbn=978-1-56053-408-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=EPA Identifies Noise Levels Affecting Health and Welfare |date=April 2, 1972 | url=http://www.epa.gov/history/topics/noise/01.htm}}</ref>\n\n[[Noise pollution]] control in residences is not funded by the federal government in part because of the disagreements in establishing causal links between sounds and health risks, since the effect of noise is often psychological and also, because it leaves no singular tangible trace of damage on the human body.

An example of this would be in dogs, and the noise exposure levels occurring within kennels.  Dogs experience this noise exposure whether it be a long stay at an animal shelter, or a weekend stay at a boarding facility.\n\nOrganizations like [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]] and [[Occupational safety and health|OSHA]] have different regulations when it comes to the noise exposure levels in industrial workers.  Currently there are no regulations related to the noise exposure for dogs even with such damaging effects related to their health.  Health risks dogs are exposed to include ear damage and behavioral changes.\n\nThe average noise exposure in a kennel is greater than 100&nbsp;dB SPL.  According to OSHA these levels would yield in the use of hearing protection for the workers of those kennels due to the risk of noise induced hearing loss.  The anatomical structures of the human and dog ears are very similar, so it is thought that these levels will negatively impact the hearing of canines in kennels. The [[Auditory brainstem response|ABR]] can be used to estimate the hearing threshold of dogd, and can be used to show either a temporary threshold shift or permanent threshold shift after being exposed to excessive sound levels.<ref name=\"Scheifele_2012\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Scheifele P, Martin D, Clark JG, Kemper D, Wells J | title = Effect of kennel noise on hearing in dogs | journal = American Journal of Veterinary Research | volume = 73 | issue = 4 | pages = 482\u20139 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22452494 | doi = 10.2460/ajvr.73.4.482 }}</ref>\n\nBehavioral effects to excessive noise exposure include hiding, urinating, defecating, panting, pacing, drooling, disregard to commands, trembling, and barking.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Noise Phobia in Dog|journal=Veterinary World|volume=1}}</ref> These behavioral patterns pose a much greater problem to canines than meets the eye.

The workers' psychological state could affect the care provided to the dogs.  These loud noise exposures also have the potential to reduce the amount of time that potential adoptive families spend in the facility.  This can result in less dogs being adopted and more time being exposed to excessive sound levels.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Coppola CL, Enns RM, Grandin T | title = Noise in the animal shelter environment: building design and the effects of daily noise exposure | journal = Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u20137 | date = 2006-01-01 | pmid = 16649947 | doi = 10.1207/s15327604jaws0901_1 | hdl = 10217/4405 }}</ref>\n\nTo reduce the level of noise exposure poses a little more difficulty because the majority of the noise is coming from the dogs (barking), but structural changes can be made to the facilities in order to reduce the noise.  Structural changes could include how many dogs are put in one area, more absorbing material rather than metal cages and cement walls and floors, and possibly in the future use of hearing protection devices ([[Hearing protection|HPD]]) for the dogs. All of these structural changes would also benefit the humans involved as well as the use of HPD's (ear plugs).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Aircraft noise]]\n*[[Loud music]]\n*[[Bark (sound)#As nuisance|Nuisance barking]]\n*[[Occupational hearing loss]]\n* [[Noise control]]\n* [[Noise mitigation]]\n* [[Noise pollution]]\n*[[Buy Quiet|Buy quiet]]\n* [[Safe-In-Sound Award]]\n* [[The Mosquito]], an audio  device to discourage loitering\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist|32em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://vimeo.com/155891645 Noise health effects.
