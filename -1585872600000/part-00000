Both Plato and Xenophon were Athenians.

The Spartan cavalry were quickly defeated by the superior Theban cavalry and were chased back to their own side. Their disorderly retreat disrupted the battle lines of the Spartan heavy infantry and, because of the resulting chaos and the dust stirred up, the Spartans were unable to observe the highly unusual advance of the Theban army until the very last moment.<ref name=\"fine\" /> Epaminondas had ordered his troops to advance diagonally, such that the left wing of the Theban army (with its concentration of forces) would impact with the right wing of the Spartan army well before the other weaker phalanxes.<ref name=\"seager\" /> The furthest right wing of the Theban phalanx was even retreating to make this possible.<ref name=\"chriss\" /> This is the first recorded instance of the military formation later known as the [[oblique order]].<ref name=\"vander\">{{cite book|author=Maj.

Shortly before the Theban left wing made contact, the Spartans hastily stretched out their right wing in an attempt to outflank and engulf the rapidly approaching Thebans. This was a traditional tactic and, once the Thebans were in range, the stretched wing would then be brought back in an encircling movement. Acting under his own initiative, Pelopidas quickly led the Sacred Band ahead of the Theban left wing to intercept the Spartan maneuver before it could be completed.<ref name=\"buckler\" /><ref group=\"note\">Some historians believe that Epaminondas explicitly ordered Pelopidas to intercept the Spartan right wing. (Chrissanthos, 2008; Gabriel, 2001) Others believe that this action was pre-planned (perhaps even rehearsed) and independently performed as part of the Sacred Band's role in the battle. (Jones, 2000)</ref> They succeeded in fixing the Spartans in place until the rest of the Theban heavy infantry finally smashed into the Spartan right wing. The sheer number of Thebans overwhelmed the Spartan right wing quickly. The number of Spartan casualties amounted to about 1,000 dead, among whom were 400 Spartiates and their own king. The Spartan right flank were forced to retreat (after retrieving the body of Cleombrotus). Seeing the spartiates fleeing in disarray, the perioeci phalanxes also broke ranks and retreated. Although some Spartans were in favor of resuming the battle in order to recover the bodies of their dead, the allied perioeci of the Spartan left wing were less than willing to continue fighting (indeed some of them were quite pleased at the turn of events). The remaining ''polemarchoi'' eventually decided to request a truce, which the Thebans readily granted. The Spartan dead were returned and a ''[[tropaion]]'' was set up on the battlefield by the Thebans to commemorate their victory.<ref name=\"seager\" />\n\nAccording to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (c. 2nd century AD), the Battle of Leuctra was the most decisive battle ever fought by Greeks against Greeks. Leuctra established Theban independence from Spartan rule and laid the groundwork for the expansion of Theban power, but possibly also for the eventual supremacy of Philip II of Macedon.\n\n=== Battle of Chaeronea ===\n{{Main article|Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)}}\nDefeat came at the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)]], the decisive contest in which [[Philip II of Macedon]], with his son [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], extinguished Theban hegemony.<ref name=\"devoto\"/> The battle is the culmination of [[Rise of Macedon#Philip's final campaigns (339\u2013338 BC)|Philip's campaign into central Greece]] in preparation for a war against Persia. It was fought between the Macedonians and their allies and an alliance of Greek city-states led by Athens and Thebes.

The Thebans of the Sacred Band held their ground and Plutarch records that all 300 fell where they stood beside their last commander, [[Theagenes of Thebes|Theagenes]]. Their defeat at the battle was a significant victory for Philip, since until then, the Sacred Band was regarded as invincible throughout all of Ancient Greece. Plutarch records that Philip II, on encountering the corpses \"heaped one upon another\", understanding who they were, wept and exclaimed,\n\n{{quote|Perish any man who suspects that these men either did or suffered anything unseemly.|Plutarch, ''Pelopidas'' 18<ref name=\"plutarchD\">{{cite book|author=[[Plutarch]] (trans.

Two hours away from the village, Taylor's horse momentarily stumbled on a piece of marble jutting from the ground. Looking back at the rock, he was struck by its appearance of being sculpted and called for their party to stop. They dismounted and dug at it with their riding-whips, ascertaining that it was indeed sculpture. They enlisted the help of some nearby farmers until they finally uncovered the massive head of a stone lion which they recognized as the same lion mentioned by Pausanias.

(Ashley, 2004)</ref> However, historians such as [[N. G. L. Hammond|Nicholas Geoffrey Lempri\u00e8re Hammond]], [[Karl Julius Beloch]], and Vincenzo Costanzi do not believe that the lion monument marks the location of the Sacred Band dead. Hammond claims it was the place where Philip turned his army around during the Battle of Chaeronea and believes that it contains the members of the Macedonian right flank who perished. He argues that it is highly improbable that the Thebans would be able to commemorate their dead within Philip's lifetime with such a massive and obviously expensive monument.<ref name=\"pritchLion\"/>\n\nThe historian William Kendrick Pritchett criticizes Hammond's rationale as \"subjective\" and counters it with a passage from ''Historiarum Philippicarum Libri XLIV'' of the 3rd-century AD [[Roman Empire|Roman]] historian [[Justin (historian)|Justin]]. In addition to Pausanias and Strabo, Justin also clearly says that Philip forced the Thebans to pay for the privilege of burying (not cremating) their dead. Therefore, the cremated remains are likely to be Macedonian, while the remains around the lion were the Sacred Band. Philip, after all, was known for his ability to inflict unnecessary cruelty when it served a greater purpose. He further points out that questioning the honesty of Pausanias is unwarranted, as any well-informed Greek then would probably know the ascription of the monument even centuries after the battle; Pausanias' knowledge of topography was not second-hand and his testimony was echoed independently by other ancient sources such as Strabo and Justin.<ref name=\"pritchLion\"/><ref name=\"sabin\"/> Indeed, Pausanias' ''Description of Greece'' has proved to be an accurate and important guide to modern archeologists in rediscovering the locations of other ancient Greek monuments and buildings.<ref name=\"habicht\">{{cite book|author=Christian Habicht|title =Pausanias' Guide to Ancient Greece|chapter =Pausanias as a Guide|publisher =University of California Press|year =1999|pages=28\u201363|isbn = 9780520061705|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=9cJYpYbScEUC&lpg=PP1&ots=USSSXq-Xpn&dq=Pausanias%20Description%20of%20Greece%20archeology&pg=PA28#v=onepage&q=archaeology&f=false}}</ref><ref name=\"rubin\">{{cite book|author=Lene Rubinstein|editor1=Morgens Herman Hansen |editor2=Kurt Raaflaub |title =Studies in the Ancient Greek ''Polis'', Volume 1|chapter =Pausanias as a source for the classical Greek ''Polis''|publisher =Franz Steiner Verlag|year =1995|page=211|isbn =9783515067591|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=0xyNwS2q7CUC&lpg=PA212&ots=kaJ_u5BH1F&dq=Pausanias%20Importance%20Archaeology&pg=PA211#v=onepage&q=Pausanias%20Importance%20Archaeology&f=false}}</ref><ref name=\"elsner\">{{cite journal|author=[[Ja\u015b Elsner]]|year=2010|title=Special issue: Receptions of Pausanias: From Winckelmann to Frazer|journal=Classical Receptions Journal|volume=2|issue=2|pages=157\u2013173|doi=10.1093/crj/clq012|url=http://crj.oxfordjournals.org/content/2/2/157.full}}</ref>\n\n== Historicity  ==\n[[File:Plutarchs Lives Vol the Third 1727.jpg|thumb|[[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Parallel Lives|Lives]]'' (pictured: the 1727 edition of the English translation by [[Andr\u00e9 Dacier]]) is the main source for the most substantial surviving account of the Sacred Band.

While Jacoby, responding to claims that Callisthenes was unreliable in accounts of land battles in contrast to Xenophon, pointed out that Callisthenes did accurately describe the details on the Battle of Tegyra.

There is nothing implausible or unusual in Plutarch's account, and every reason to consider it one of the best of his battle pieces.\" They also had the same opinion of his account on Leuctra, dismissing assertions that his accounts were confused or rhetorical.<ref name=\"buckler\"/>\n\nThe historian Gordon S. Shrimpton further provides an explanation for Xenophon's silence on much of Theban history. He notes that all the surviving contemporary accounts of Thebes during the period of Theban hegemony between 371 and 341 BC were often highly critical; with their failures ridiculed and their accomplishments usually being downplayed or omitted altogether. For instance, the Athenian [[Isocrates]] (436\u2013338 BC) in his ''Plataicus'' (which details the destruction of Plataea by the Thebans), makes no mention of the Theban victory in Leuctra, and harshly reviles Thebes throughout. His later work ''Archidamus'' mention Leuctra briefly, and only to criticize Thebans as being incompetent and incapable of capitalizing on their rise to power. The same sentiments are echoed by the Athenians [[Demosthenes]] (384\u2013322 BC) and [[Antisthenes]] (c. 445\u2013365 BC). Xenophon, another Athenian, is the only contemporary who grudgingly notes some Theban accomplishments, and even then, never in-depth and with numerous omissions. His only mentions of Pelopidas and Epaminondas by name, for example, were very brief and shed no light on their previous accomplishments.<ref name=\"shrimpton\"/> Indeed, the historians [[Bruce LaForse]] and John Buckler have noted that the character and accomplishments of Epaminondas were so unassailable that there is no known hostile account of him in ancient sources. The most unfriendly writers like Xenophon and Isocrates could do was omit his accomplishments in their work altogether.<ref name=\"laforse\">{{cite book|author=Bruce LaForse|editor =Konrad H.

Athenians, in particular, held a special contempt for Thebes due to the latter's actions in the [[Peloponnesian War]]; as well as the Thebans' destruction of Plataea in 373 BC, and the invasion of the Athenian-allied Boeotian city of [[Oropus]] in 366 BC. Demosthenes records this sentiment very clearly in a disclaimer in his speech ''[[On the Navy]]'' (354 BC): \"It is difficult to speak to you about [Thebans], because you have such a hearty dislike of them that you would not care to hear any good of them, even if it were true.\"<ref name=\"shrimpton\"/><ref name=\"demSymm\">{{cite book|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0072%3Aspeech%3D14%3Asection%3D33|title=On the Navy|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=On the Symmories|orig-year=354 BC|author=[[Demosthenes]]}}</ref>\n\nThis sentiment changed in 339 BC, when Thebes abruptly severed its alliance with Philip II (after being convinced by a speech from Demosthenes) and joined the Athenian-led Pan-Hellenic alliance against Macedonia. The result being the annihilation of the Sacred Band in Chaeronea and the destruction of the city of Thebes itself in 335 BC by the Macedonians. In light of these actions, Athenians eventually changed their opinions on Thebes, now regarding it in a sympathetic light as a fallen ally. It was during this period that much of the accounts favorable to Thebans were at last written. Works by authors like [[Anaximenes of Lampsacus]], [[Aristoxenus]], Callisthenes, [[Daimachus]], Dinarchus, and Ephorus are believed to have been written between 330 and 310 BC.

The Spartans eventually breached the fortifications and entered the Theban countryside, devastating the Theban fields in their wake. Though the Athenians had by this time joined the Theban forces, they were still outnumbered by the Spartans. With the fall of the stockades, they were left with two choices, either to retreat back to the defensible walls of Thebes or to hold their ground and face the Spartans in the open. They chose the latter and arrayed their forces along the crest of a low sloping hill, opposite the Spartan forces. Gorgidas and the Sacred Band occupied the front ranks of the Theban forces on the right, while Chabrias and an experienced force of mercenary hoplites occupied the front ranks of the Athenian forces on the left.<ref name=\"Munn\"/>\n\nAgesilaus first sent out [[skirmisher]]s to test the combined Theban and Athenian lines.<ref name=\"DiodorusXV\"/> These were easily dispatched by the Theban and Athenian forces, probably by their more numerous cavalry.

Shortly before the Theban left wing made contact, the Spartans hastily stretched out their right wing in an attempt to outflank and engulf the rapidly approaching Thebans. This was a traditional tactic and, once the Thebans were in range, the stretched wing would then be brought back in an encircling movement. Acting under his own initiative, Pelopidas quickly led the Sacred Band ahead of the Theban left wing to intercept the Spartan maneuver before it could be completed.<ref name=\"buckler\" /><ref group=\"note\">Some historians believe that Epaminondas explicitly ordered Pelopidas to intercept the Spartan right wing. (Chrissanthos, 2008; Gabriel, 2001) Others believe that this action was pre-planned (perhaps even rehearsed) and independently performed as part of the Sacred Band's role in the battle. (Jones, 2000)</ref> They succeeded in fixing the Spartans in place until the rest of the Theban heavy infantry finally smashed into the Spartan right wing. The sheer number of Thebans overwhelmed the Spartan right wing quickly. The number of Spartan casualties amounted to about 1,000 dead, among whom were 400 Spartiates and their own king. The Spartan right flank were forced to retreat (after retrieving the body of Cleombrotus). Seeing the spartiates fleeing in disarray, the perioeci phalanxes also broke ranks and retreated. Although some Spartans were in favor of resuming the battle in order to recover the bodies of their dead, the allied perioeci of the Spartan left wing were less than willing to continue fighting (indeed some of them were quite pleased at the turn of events). The remaining ''polemarchoi'' eventually decided to request a truce, which the Thebans readily granted. The Spartan dead were returned and a ''[[tropaion]]'' was set up on the battlefield by the Thebans to commemorate their victory.<ref name=\"seager\" />\n\nAccording to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (c. 2nd century AD), the Battle of Leuctra was the most decisive battle ever fought by Greeks against Greeks. Leuctra established Theban independence from Spartan rule and laid the groundwork for the expansion of Theban power, but possibly also for the eventual supremacy of Philip II of Macedon.\n\n=== Battle of Chaeronea ===\n{{Main article|Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)}}\nDefeat came at the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)]], the decisive contest in which [[Philip II of Macedon]], with his son [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], extinguished Theban hegemony.<ref name=\"devoto\"/> The battle is the culmination of [[Rise of Macedon#Philip's final campaigns (339\u2013338 BC)|Philip's campaign into central Greece]] in preparation for a war against Persia. It was fought between the Macedonians and their allies and an alliance of Greek city-states led by Athens and Thebes.

Their defeat at the battle was a significant victory for Philip, since until then, the Sacred Band was regarded as invincible throughout all of Ancient Greece.

Two hours away from the village, Taylor's horse momentarily stumbled on a piece of marble jutting from the ground.

They dismounted and dug at it with their riding-whips, ascertaining that it was indeed sculpture. They enlisted the help of some nearby farmers until they finally uncovered the massive head of a stone lion which they recognized as the same lion mentioned by Pausanias.

(Ashley, 2004)</ref> However, historians such as [[N. G. L. Hammond|Nicholas Geoffrey Lempri\u00e8re Hammond]], [[Karl Julius Beloch]], and [[Vincenzo Costanzi]] do not believe that the lion monument marks the location of the Sacred Band dead. Hammond claims it was the place where Philip turned his army around during the Battle of Chaeronea and believes that it contains the members of the Macedonian right flank who perished. He argues that it is highly improbable that the Thebans would be able to commemorate their dead within Philip's lifetime with such a massive and obviously expensive monument.<ref name=\"pritchLion\"/>\n\nThe historian William Kendrick Pritchett criticizes Hammond's rationale as \"subjective\" and counters it with a passage from ''Historiarum Philippicarum Libri XLIV'' of the 3rd-century AD [[Roman Empire|Roman]] historian [[Justin (historian)|Justin]]. In addition to Pausanias and Strabo, Justin also clearly says that Philip forced the Thebans to pay for the privilege of burying (not cremating) their dead. Therefore, the cremated remains are likely to be Macedonian, while the remains around the lion were the Sacred Band. Philip, after all, was known for his ability to inflict unnecessary cruelty when it served a greater purpose. He further points out that questioning the honesty of Pausanias is unwarranted, as any well-informed Greek then would probably know the ascription of the monument even centuries after the battle; Pausanias' knowledge of topography was not second-hand and his testimony was echoed independently by other ancient sources such as Strabo and Justin.<ref name=\"pritchLion\"/><ref name=\"sabin\"/> Indeed, Pausanias' ''Description of Greece'' has proved to be an accurate and important guide to modern archeologists in rediscovering the locations of other ancient Greek monuments and buildings.<ref name=\"habicht\">{{cite book|author=Christian Habicht|title =Pausanias' Guide to Ancient Greece|chapter =Pausanias as a Guide|publisher =University of California Press|year =1999|pages=28\u201363|isbn = 9780520061705|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=9cJYpYbScEUC&lpg=PP1&ots=USSSXq-Xpn&dq=Pausanias%20Description%20of%20Greece%20archeology&pg=PA28#v=onepage&q=archaeology&f=false}}</ref><ref name=\"rubin\">{{cite book|author=Lene Rubinstein|editor1=Morgens Herman Hansen |editor2=Kurt Raaflaub |title =Studies in the Ancient Greek ''Polis'', Volume 1|chapter =Pausanias as a source for the classical Greek ''Polis''|publisher =Franz Steiner Verlag|year =1995|page=211|isbn =9783515067591|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=0xyNwS2q7CUC&lpg=PA212&ots=kaJ_u5BH1F&dq=Pausanias%20Importance%20Archaeology&pg=PA211#v=onepage&q=Pausanias%20Importance%20Archaeology&f=false}}</ref><ref name=\"elsner\">{{cite journal|author=[[Ja\u015b Elsner]]|year=2010|title=Special issue: Receptions of Pausanias: From Winckelmann to Frazer|journal=Classical Receptions Journal|volume=2|issue=2|pages=157\u2013173|doi=10.1093/crj/clq012|url=http://crj.oxfordjournals.org/content/2/2/157.full}}</ref>\n\n== Historicity  ==\n[[File:Plutarchs Lives Vol the Third 1727.jpg|thumb|[[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Parallel Lives|Lives]]'' (pictured: the 1727 edition of the English translation by [[Andr\u00e9 Dacier]]) is the main source for the most substantial surviving account of the Sacred Band. It is believed to be mostly based on the works of the Sacred Band contemporaries [[Callisthenes]] and [[Ephorus]]. Unfortunately the works of the latter two have been lost to history.]]\nThe historicity of the Sacred Band is largely accepted by historians; it is detailed in the writings of numerous classical authors, especially [[Plutarch]]. Noted classical historians like John Kinloch Anderson and [[George Cawkwell]] accept Plutarch's ''Life of Pelopidas'', which contains the most detailed account of the Sacred Band, as a highly reliable account of the events, in contrast to Xenophon's patchy treatment of Theban history.<ref name=\"anderson\" /><ref name=\"cawk\">{{cite book|author=George Cawkwell|title =Scripta Antiquitatis Posterioris Ad Ethicam Religionemque Pertinentia.

W. Walbank|Frank William Walbank]] and [[Felix Jacoby]] have also defended Callisthenes' descriptions of land battles in the past. Walbank commented that his depictions of the [[Battle of the Eurymedon]], [[Battle of Gaugamela|Gaugamela]], and Tegyra (all surviving through Plutarch) are quite adequate. While Jacoby, responding to claims that Callisthenes was unreliable in accounts of land battles in contrast to Xenophon, pointed out that Callisthenes did accurately describe the details on the Battle of Tegyra. He summarized his opinion of Callisthenes' account with \"''Sie ist panegyrisch gehalten, aber sachlich nicht unrichtig.'' [It is panegyrical, but it is not factually incorrect.]\"<ref name=\"pritchett\"/> This is echoed by the historians [[John Buckler (historian)|John Buckler]] and [[Hans Beck (historian)|Hans Beck]] who conclude that \"In sum, Plutarch's description of the battle of Tegyra does justice both to the terrain of Polygyra and to the information gleaned from his fourth-century sources. There is nothing implausible or unusual in Plutarch's account, and every reason to consider it one of the best of his battle pieces.\" They also had the same opinion of his account on Leuctra, dismissing assertions that his accounts were confused or rhetorical.<ref name=\"buckler\"/>\n\nThe historian Gordon S. Shrimpton further provides an explanation for Xenophon's silence on much of Theban history. He notes that all the surviving contemporary accounts of Thebes during the period of Theban hegemony between 371 and 341 BC were often highly critical; with their failures ridiculed and their accomplishments usually being downplayed or omitted altogether. For instance, the Athenian [[Isocrates]] (436\u2013338 BC) in his ''Plataicus'' (which details the destruction of Plataea by the Thebans), makes no mention of the Theban victory in Leuctra, and harshly reviles Thebes throughout. His later work ''Archidamus'' mention Leuctra briefly, and only to criticize Thebans as being incompetent and incapable of capitalizing on their rise to power. The same sentiments are echoed by the Athenians [[Demosthenes]] (384\u2013322 BC) and [[Antisthenes]] (c. 445\u2013365 BC). Xenophon, another Athenian, is the only contemporary who grudgingly notes some Theban accomplishments, and even then, never in-depth and with numerous omissions. His only mentions of Pelopidas and Epaminondas by name, for example, were very brief and shed no light on their previous accomplishments.<ref name=\"shrimpton\"/> Indeed, the historians [[Bruce LaForse]] and John Buckler have noted that the character and accomplishments of Epaminondas were so unassailable that there is no known hostile account of him in ancient sources. The most unfriendly writers like Xenophon and Isocrates could do was omit his accomplishments in their work altogether.<ref name=\"laforse\">{{cite book|author=Bruce LaForse|editor =Konrad H.

Athenians, in particular, held a special contempt for Thebes due to the latter's actions in the [[Peloponnesian War]]; as well as the Thebans' destruction of Plataea in 373 BC, and the invasion of the Athenian-allied Boeotian city of [[Oropus]] in 366 BC. Demosthenes records this sentiment very clearly in a disclaimer in his speech ''[[On the Navy]]'' (354 BC): \"It is difficult to speak to you about [Thebans], because you have such a hearty dislike of them that you would not care to hear any good of them, even if it were true.\"<ref name=\"shrimpton\"/><ref name=\"demSymm\">{{cite book|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0072%3Aspeech%3D14%3Asection%3D33|title=On the Navy|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=On the Symmories|orig-year=354 BC|author=[[Demosthenes]]}}</ref>\n\nThis sentiment changed in 339 BC, when Thebes abruptly severed its alliance with Philip II (after being convinced by a speech from Demosthenes) and joined the Athenian-led Pan-Hellenic alliance against Macedonia. The result being the annihilation of the Sacred Band in Chaeronea and the destruction of the city of Thebes itself in 335 BC by the Macedonians. In light of these actions, Athenians eventually changed their opinions on Thebes, now regarding it in a sympathetic light as a fallen ally. It was during this period that much of the accounts favorable to Thebans were at last written. Works by authors like [[Anaximenes of Lampsacus]], [[Aristoxenus]], Callisthenes, [[Daimachus]], Dinarchus, and Ephorus are believed to have been written between 330 and 310 BC. Except for Dinarchus, almost all of them have been lost to history or survive only in fragments. Among them are Ephorus and Callisthenes who were contemporaries of the Theban hegemony and the Sacred Band.<ref name=\"shrimpton\"/> The works of the latter two, however, survived long enough for later authors like Plutarch, Diodorus, and Polyaenus to base their works on.<ref name=\"anderson\"/><ref name=\"buckler\">{{cite book|author1=John Buckler  |author2=Hans Beck  |lastauthoramp=yes |title =Central Greece And The Politics Of Power In The Fourth Century BC|publisher =Cambridge University Press|year =2008|isbn =9780521837057|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bn5Nz5yjGUIC&lpg=PA91&ots=bkvxQlA1VU&dq=Phoebidas%20Gorgidas&pg=PA91#v=onepage&q=Phoebidas%20Gorgidas&f=false}}</ref><ref name=\"terry\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Homosexuality in ancient Greece]]\n* [[Sacred Band of Carthage]]\n* [[Homosexuality in the militaries of ancient Greece]]\n* [[Sacred Band (1821)]] - Greek battalion in the Greek war of independence\n* [[Sacred Band (World War II)]] - Greek special forces unit in World War II\n* [[Caledonian Thebans RFC]], an Edinburgh gay rugby club named after them\n* [[Army of lovers]], a Swedish pop band named after them\n* [[The Sacred Band of Stepsons]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Sacred Band of Thebes}}\n\n{{Ancient Greece topics|state=collapsed}}\n{{LGBT military-related groups}}\n{{Sexual orientation and gender identity in the military}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sacred Band Of Thebes}}\n[[Category:Military units and formations of ancient Greece]]\n[[Category:Sexuality in ancient Greece]]\n[[Category:LGBT history in Greece]]\n[[Category:Ancient LGBT history]]\n[[Category:Gay history]]\n[[Category:Theban hegemony]]\n[[Category:4th-century BC establishments in Greece]]\n", "name_user": "Flordeneu", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLion of Chaeronea:Fix cite template and red link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Band_of_Thebes"}

In 1881, after having had relative rank conferred upon them, civil engineers were instructed by Uniform Circular dated 24 August to wear the uniform of officers of the line with whom they had relative rank - omitting the star, which is a distinguishing mark of the line - with the following distinctive marks and devices instead of those worn by other officers:\n\n\"The sleeve lace to be on light blue velvet.\n\n\"Shoulder straps - border embroidered gold, body light blue cloth and the letters C.E. (Old English) embroidered in silver in the center.\n\n\"The same letters to be similarly embroidered on frogs of epaulets.\"\n\nIn 1905, two crossed silver sprigs, each composed of two live oak leaves and an acorn (sometimes called \"Crossed Bananas\"), was adopted as the insignia of the Civil Engineer Corps in lieu of the Old English letters C.E., and worn on the epaulets, shoulder straps and collar of the service coat.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>  While the pattern of this corps device remained the same, uniform regulations issued in 1919 specified that it was to be embroidered in gold instead of silver and worn on the sleeve of frock, evening dress, and blue service coats, above the gold lace strips, and on shoulder marks for white service coat and overcoat. By these same regulations the light blue cloth worn under the sleeve strips, and worn on the shoulder marks since 1899, was abolished as a distinction of the corps, however is still present in the light blue color of the stripes worn by the enlisted sailors, pay grades of E-3 and below in the Navy's construction field.\n\nIn 1939 the CEC was composed of 126  active officers.  By [[VJ day]] that number had grown to only 200.  However, there were over 10,000 reservists providing the leadership of the Construction Battalions.<ref name= \"CEC\">History of the CEC, '''p. 18'''[https://www.navfac.navy.mil/content/dam/navfac/PDFs/history/history-of-the-civil-engineer-corps.pdf]</ref>\nIn December 1941 Admiral [[Ben Moreell]] proposed the creation of 3 Naval Construction Battalions.  A problem then confronted BuDocks, who would command the Construction Battalions? Naval regulations stated that military command of naval personnel was strictly limited to [[line officer]]s, yet BuDocks deemed it essential that these Construction Battalions be commanded by officers of the Civil Engineer Corp, who were trained in the skills required for construction work. The newly formed [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]] (BuPers), successor to the Navy's Bureau of Navigation, strongly opposed this transgression of [[Naval tradition]].  Admiral Moreell took the question personally to the [[Secretary of the Navy]], [[Frank Knox]], who, on 19 March 1942, gave authority for officers of the Civil Engineer Corps to exercise military authority over all officers and enlisted men assigned to construction units otherwise known as the [[Seabees]].  For those engineers assigned to the Seabees a silver Seabee was mounted to the center of the CEC crossed oak leaves insignia.  The Seabee logo incorporated the CEC insignia, with one on each arm of the Seabee, just above each glove.\n[[File:Capt. John N Laycock and Admiral Moreell.jpg|thumb|Capt. John N.

He heard that Admiral Turner was interested in blasting coral and made contact.  The Admiral commissioned Lt. Crist with developing a method to blast coral under combat  conditions and gather qualified men in [[Pearl Harbor|Pearl]] to form a unit.  Lt. Crist had gotten 30 officers and 150  enlisted together when the disaster at [[Battle of Tarawa|Tarawa]] happened.  With [[Battle of Kwajalein|Kwajalein]] the next operation Lt. Crist's 180 men were used to form UDT 1 and UDT 2.  Cmdr. E.D. Brewster (CEC) was selected to command UDT 1 and UDT 2 had  Lt. Crist.  Lt Crist would become the first Training Officer of the UDT  program in Hawaii.  He was in the position only a short time when he was selected as Commander of UDT 3.

[http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/officer/communitymanagers/StaffCorps/Pages/CivilEngineerCorps(CEC).aspx] Several Civil Engineer Corps officers, primarily those serving during or around the time of World War 2, have held the rank of Vice Admiral, and one officer has held the 4 star rank of Admiral, but there are no current billets within the US Navy that require Civil Engineer Corps officers of either rank.\n\n== History ==\n\nCivil engineers were employed by the Navy Department as early as 1827, when Mr. Loammi Baldwin was appointed to superintendent of the construction of dry docks at Boston and Norfolk.<ref name= \"CEC\"/> Prior to the passage of the Act of 2 March 1867 civil engineers were appointed by the Secretary, but under authority of that act they were to be commissioned by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate; they were appropriated for as part of the civil establishment at the several navy yards and stations under the control of the [[Bureau of Yards and Docks]] until 1870.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>   At that time their pay was regulated by section 3 of the Act of 15 July, 1870 that  \"fixed\" the annual pay of officers of the Navy on the active list.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>   Appropriations for their pay have been made since 1870 under the head of \"Pay of the Navy\".\n\nThe discretionary authority given to the President by the Statute of 3 March 1871, to determine and fix the relative rank of civil engineers was not exercised until the 24th of February 1881, when relative rank was conferred upon them and fixed as follows: One with the relative rank of captain ([[Captain (United States)|CAPT]]), two with that of commander ([[Commander|CDR]]), three with that of lieutenant-commander ([[lieutenant commander|LCDR]]), and four with that of lieutenant ([[lieutenant|LT]]).<ref name= \"CEC\"/>\n\nThe Navy Regulations for 1876 failed to list civil engineers among the staff officers of the Navy, and the uniform regulations for that year did not prescribe a uniform or a corps device for that class of officer. In 1881, after having had relative rank conferred upon them, civil engineers were instructed by Uniform Circular dated 24 August to wear the uniform of officers of the line with whom they had relative rank - omitting the star, which is a distinguishing mark of the line - with the following distinctive marks and devices instead of those worn by other officers:\n\n\"The sleeve lace to be on light blue velvet.\n\n\"Shoulder straps - border embroidered gold, body light blue cloth and the letters C.E. (Old English) embroidered in silver in the center.\n\n\"The same letters to be similarly embroidered on frogs of epaulets.\"\n\nIn 1905, two crossed silver sprigs, each composed of two live oak leaves and an acorn (sometimes called \"Crossed Bananas\"), was adopted as the insignia of the Civil Engineer Corps in lieu of the Old English letters C.E., and worn on the epaulets, shoulder straps and collar of the service coat.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>  While the pattern of this corps device remained the same, uniform regulations issued in 1919 specified that it was to be embroidered in gold instead of silver and worn on the sleeve of frock, evening dress, and blue service coats, above the gold lace strips, and on shoulder marks for white service coat and overcoat. By these same regulations the light blue cloth worn under the sleeve strips, and worn on the shoulder marks since 1899, was abolished as a distinction of the corps, however is still present in the light blue color of the stripes worn by the enlisted sailors, pay grades of E-3 and below in the Navy's construction field.\n\nIn 1939 the CEC was composed of 126  active officers.  By [[VJ day]] that number had grown to only 200.  However, there were over 10,000 reservists providing the leadership of the Construction Battalions.<ref name= \"CEC\">History of the CEC, '''p. 18'''[https://www.navfac.navy.mil/content/dam/navfac/PDFs/history/history-of-the-civil-engineer-corps.pdf]</ref>\nIn December 1941 Admiral [[Ben Moreell]] proposed the creation of 3 Naval Construction Battalions.  A problem then confronted BuDocks, who would command the Construction Battalions? Naval regulations stated that military command of naval personnel was strictly limited to [[line officer]]s, yet BuDocks deemed it essential that these Construction Battalions be commanded by officers of the Civil Engineer Corp, who were trained in the skills required for construction work. The newly formed [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]] (BuPers), successor to the Navy's Bureau of Navigation, strongly opposed this transgression of [[Naval tradition]].  Admiral Moreell took the question personally to the [[Secretary of the Navy]], [[Frank Knox]], who, on 19 March 1942, gave authority for officers of the Civil Engineer Corps to exercise military authority over all officers and enlisted men assigned to construction units otherwise known as the [[Seabees]].  For those engineers assigned to the Seabees a silver Seabee was mounted to the center of the CEC crossed oak leaves insignia.  The Seabee logo incorporated the CEC insignia, with one on each arm of the Seabee, just above each glove.\n[[File:Capt. John N Laycock and Admiral Moreell.jpg|thumb|Capt. John N. Laycock discussing his modular pontoon box system with Admiral Moreell.]]\nBesides providing the command leadership and engineering skills needed by the Naval Construction Force(NCF), the CEC made a major contribution to the war effort.
