Coloured red on the rail map, the line is {{convert|45|km|mi}} long and serves 27 stations, 11 of which, between the [[Bishan MRT station|Bishan]] and [[Marina South Pier MRT station|Marina South Pier]] stations, are underground. It runs from [[Jurong East MRT station|Jurong East station]], located in [[West Region, Singapore|western Singapore]], to Marina South Pier station in the [[Central Area, Singapore|Central Area]], via [[Woodlands MRT station|Woodlands station]] in [[North Region, Singapore|northern Singapore]]. The line operates for 19 hours a day (from approximately 5:30 am to around midnight), with [[Headway|headways]] of up to 3 minutes during peak hours and 7 minutes during off-peak hours. All the trains on the NSL run with a six-car formation. \n\nIt is the first MRT line to be built in Singapore, with the first section from [[Yio Chu Kang MRT station|Yio Chu Kang station]] to [[Toa Payoh MRT station|Toa Payoh station]] beginning service on 7 November 1987, followed by an extension southwards to [[Raffles Place MRT station|Raffles Place station]] on 12 December the same year and northwards to [[Yishun MRT station|Yishun station]] on 20 December 1988. After the southern extension to [[Marina Bay MRT station|Marina Bay station]] on 4 November 1989, the North South line was formed and split from the [[East West MRT line|East West line]]. In the 1990s, the line extended to the north and west connecting to the [[Branch MRT line|Branch line]] via [[Woodlands, Singapore|Woodlands]] through the Woodlands line extension. \n\nSince the 2010s, due to the ageing infrastructure of the NSL (being the oldest and heavily utilised MRT line), significant improvements have been made on the line, such as the replacement of sleepers, third-rail replacement and the introduction of new rolling stocks (the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries & CSR Sifang C151B|C151B]] and the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries & CSR Sifang C151C|C151C]]) to replace the older rolling stocks and increase passenger capacity. The NSL is also the first line to have undergone a major re-signalling project, converting from semi-automatic to fully automated operations in 2019. Other recent developments of the line include a new extension to [[Marina South Pier MRT station|Marina South Pier station]] on 23 November 2014 and a new infill station, [[Canberra MRT station|Canberra station]], on 2 November 2019.

Coloured red on the rail map, the line is {{convert|45|km|mi}} long and serves 27 stations, 11 of which, between the [[Bishan MRT station|Bishan]] and [[Marina South Pier MRT station|Marina South Pier]] stations, are underground. It runs from [[Jurong East MRT station|Jurong East station]], located in [[West Region, Singapore|western Singapore]], to Marina South Pier station in the [[Central Area, Singapore|Central Area]], via [[Woodlands MRT station|Woodlands station]] in [[North Region, Singapore|northern Singapore]]. The line operates for 19 hours a day (from approximately 5:30 am to around midnight), with [[Headway|headways]] of up to 3 minutes during peak hours and 7 minutes during off-peak hours. All the trains on the NSL run with a six-car formation. \n\nIt is the first MRT line to be built in Singapore, with the first section from [[Yio Chu Kang MRT station|Yio Chu Kang station]] to [[Toa Payoh MRT station|Toa Payoh station]] beginning service on 7 November 1987, followed by an extension southwards to [[Raffles Place MRT station|Raffles Place station]] on 12 December the same year and northwards to [[Yishun MRT station|Yishun station]] on 20 December 1988. After the southern extension to [[Marina Bay MRT station|Marina Bay station]] on 4 November 1989, the North South line was formed and split from the [[East West MRT line|East West line]]. In the 1990s, the line extended to the north and west connecting to the [[Branch MRT line|Branch line]] via [[Woodlands, Singapore|Woodlands]] through the Woodlands line extension. \n\nSince the 2010s, due to the ageing infrastructure of the NSL (being the oldest and heavily utilised MRT line), significant improvements have been made on the line, such as the replacement of sleepers, third-rail replacement and the introduction of new rolling stocks (the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries & CSR Sifang C151B|C151B]] and the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries & CSR Sifang C151C|C151C]]) to replace the older rolling stocks and increase passenger capacity. The NSL is also the first line to have undergone a major re-signalling project, converting from semi-automatic to fully automated operations in 2019. Other recent developments of the line include a new extension to [[Marina South Pier MRT station|Marina South Pier station]] on 23 November 2014 and a new infill station, [[Canberra MRT station|Canberra station]], on 2 November 2019. Two more infill stations ([[Brickland MRT station|Brickland]] and [[Sungei Kadut MRT station|Sungei Kadut]] stations) on the line are being planned and are set to be opened in the 2030s.\n\n==History==\n===Initial developments===\n[[File:NS19 Toa Payoh Plaque unveiled.jpg|thumb|left|A plaque at Toa Payoh station commemorating the opening of the first phase of the Singapore MRT]]\nThe [[History of the Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|origins]] of the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) are derived from a forecast by city planners in 1967, which stated the need for a rail-based urban transport system in Singapore by 1992.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Seah C.

It was released in April 2011 for [[Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Linux]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Xbox 360]]. The digital PC version is distributed online by Valve's [[Steam (software)|Steam]] service, while all retail editions were distributed by [[Electronic Arts]].\n\nLike the original ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'' (2007), players solve puzzles by placing portals and teleporting between them. ''Portal 2'' adds features including tractor beams, lasers, light bridges, and paint-like gels that alter player movement or allow portals to be placed on any surface. In the [[single-player]] campaign, players control [[Chell (Portal)|Chell]], who navigates the dilapidated [[Aperture Science Laboratories|Aperture Science Enrichment Center]] during its reconstruction by the supercomputer [[GLaDOS]] ([[Ellen McLain]]); new characters include robot [[Wheatley (Portal)|Wheatley]] ([[Stephen Merchant]]) and Aperture founder [[Cave Johnson (Portal)|Cave Johnson]] ([[J. K. Simmons]]). In the new cooperative mode, players solve puzzles together as robots Atlas and P-Body (both voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]). [[Jonathan Coulton]] and [[The National (band)|The National]] produced songs for the game.\n\nValve announced ''Portal 2'' in March 2010, and promoted it with [[alternate reality game]]s including the [[Potato Sack]], a collaboration with several [[Independent video game development|independent game developers]]. After release, Valve released [[downloadable content]] and a simplified [[Level editor|map editor]] to allow players to create and share levels.\n\n''Portal 2'' received acclaim for its gameplay, balanced [[learning curve]], pacing, [[dark humor]], writing, and acting. It has been described as one of the [[greatest video games of all time]] by numerous publications and critics.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Portal physics-2.svg|thumb|''Portal 2'' challenges the player to use teleportation to traverse obstacle courses. The player's speed does not change upon passing through portals. In this example, the vertical velocity of the falling character is converted into horizontal velocity by the portal.|alt=A schematic of two platforms separated by a gap and by height. One portal opening is located at the bottom of the gap, the other on a wall high above the lower platform. A human figure is shown by a trajectory path to be able to jump from the lower platform into the bottom portal and exit the top portal to land on the higher platform.|left]]\n\n''Portal 2'' is a first-person perspective puzzle game. The player takes the role of [[Chell (Portal)|Chell]] in the [[single-player]] campaign, as one of two robots{{mdash}}Atlas and P-Body{{mdash}}in the cooperative campaign, or as a simplistic humanoid icon in community-developed puzzles. These three characters can explore and interact with the environment. Characters can withstand limited damage but will die after sustained injury. There is no penalty for falling onto a solid surface, but falling into bottomless pits or toxic pools kills the player character immediately. When Chell dies in the single-player game, the game restarts from a recent [[Checkpoint (video gaming)#Checkpoints|checkpoint]];<ref name=\"gi reveal\" /> in the cooperative game, the robot [[Spawning (video gaming)|respawns]] shortly afterwards without restarting the puzzle.<ref name=\"pcworld interview\" /> The goal of both campaigns is to explore the Aperture Science Laboratory\u2014a complicated, malleable mechanized maze. While most of the game takes place in modular test chambers with clearly defined entrances and exits, other parts occur in behind-the-scenes areas where the objective is less clear.\n\nThe initial tutorial levels guide the player through the general movement controls and illustrate how to interact with the environment. The player must solve puzzles using the 'portal gun' or 'Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device', which can create two portals connecting two distant surfaces depicted as matte white, continuous, and flat. Characters can use these portals to move between rooms or to \"fling\" objects or themselves across a distance. Outlines of placed portals are visible through walls and other obstacles for easy location.<ref name=\"cvg edge l4d\">{{cite web | url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/288474/news/portal-2-influenced-by-left-4-dead-valve/ | title = Portal 2 influenced by Left 4 Dead \u2013 Valve | work = [[Computer and Video Games]] | date = February 11, 2011 | accessdate = February 11, 2011 | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110213144938/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/288474/news/portal-2-influenced-by-left-4-dead-valve/ | archivedate = February 13, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"telegraph interview\">{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/8359173/Portal-2-developer-interview-Chet-Falisek-and-Erik-Wolpaw.html | title = Portal 2 developer interview: Chet Falisek and Erik Wolpaw | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = March 4, 2011 | accessdate = March 4, 2011 | first = David | last = Brown | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110309212313/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/8359173/Portal-2-developer-interview-Chet-Falisek-and-Erik-Wolpaw.html | archivedate = March 9, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nGame elements include Thermal Discouragement Beams ([[laser]]s), Excursion Funnels ([[tractor beam]]s), and Hard Light Bridges, all of which can be transmitted through portals.<ref name=\"gi reveal\" /><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/253854/news/two-more-portal-2-e3-gameplay-videos/ | title = Two more Portal 2 E3 gameplay videos | first = Mike | last = Jackson | date = June 29, 2010 | accessdate =July 1, 2010 | publisher = [[Computer and Video Games]]}}</ref><ref name=\"g4tv pax\" /><ref name=\"ign pax\">{{cite web | url= http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/111/1118382p1.html | title = Portal 2 Multiplayer Preview | first = Arthur | last = Gies | date =September 6, 2010 | accessdate =September 6, 2010 | publisher = IGN | archivedate=January 25, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125084337/http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/111/1118382p1.html}}</ref> Aerial Faith Plates launch the player or objects through the air and sometimes into portals.

announced on March 5, 2010, via ''[[Game Informer]]''. Events during the preceding week foreshadowed the announcement. On March 1, Valve released a patch for ''Portal'' that included a new achievement, \"Transmission Received\", requiring the player to manipulate in-game radios. This revealed new sound effects that became part of an [[alternate reality game]] (ARG).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/195026/anatomy_of_an_alternatereality_game.html | title = Anatomy of an Alternate-Reality Game | date = April 26, 2010 | accessdate = May 13, 2010 | publisher = [[GamePro]] | first = Alex | last = Wawro | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100501031529/http://www.pcworld.com/article/195026/anatomy_of_an_alternatereality_game.html | archivedate = May 1, 2010 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Some of the new effects were of [[Morse code]] strings that suggested GLaDOS was rebooting, while others could be decoded as [[Slow-scan television|SSTV]] images from grainy Aperture Science videos.

It was released in April 2011 for [[Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Linux]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Xbox 360]]. The digital PC version is distributed online by Valve's [[Steam (software)|Steam]] service, while all retail editions were distributed by [[Electronic Arts]].\n\nLike the original ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'' (2007), players solve puzzles by placing portals and teleporting between them. ''Portal 2'' adds features including tractor beams, lasers, light bridges, and paint-like gels that alter player movement or allow portals to be placed on any surface. In the [[single-player]] campaign, players control [[Chell (Portal)|Chell]], who navigates the dilapidated [[Aperture Science Laboratories|Aperture Science Enrichment Center]] during its reconstruction by the supercomputer [[GLaDOS]] ([[Ellen McLain]]); new characters include robot [[Wheatley (Portal)|Wheatley]] ([[Stephen Merchant]]) and Aperture founder [[Cave Johnson (Portal)|Cave Johnson]] ([[J. K. Simmons]]). In the new cooperative mode, players solve puzzles together as robots Atlas and P-Body (both voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]). [[Jonathan Coulton]] and [[The National (band)|The National]] produced songs for the game.\n\nValve announced ''Portal 2'' in March 2010, and promoted it with [[alternate reality game]]s including the [[Potato Sack]], a collaboration with several [[Independent video game development|independent game developers]]. After release, Valve released [[downloadable content]] and a simplified [[Level editor|map editor]] to allow players to create and share levels.\n\n''Portal 2'' received acclaim for its gameplay, balanced [[learning curve]], pacing, [[dark humor]], writing, and acting. It has been described as one of the [[greatest video games of all time]] by numerous publications and critics.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Portal physics-2.svg|thumb|''Portal 2'' challenges the player to use teleportation to traverse obstacle courses. The player's speed does not change upon passing through portals. In this example, the vertical velocity of the falling character is converted into horizontal velocity by the portal.|alt=A schematic of two platforms separated by a gap and by height. One portal opening is located at the bottom of the gap, the other on a wall high above the lower platform. A human figure is shown by a trajectory path to be able to jump from the lower platform into the bottom portal and exit the top portal to land on the higher platform.|left]]\n\n''Portal 2'' is a first-person perspective puzzle game. The player takes the role of [[Chell (Portal)|Chell]] in the [[single-player]] campaign, as one of two robots{{mdash}}Atlas and P-Body{{mdash}}in the cooperative campaign, or as a simplistic humanoid icon in community-developed puzzles. These three characters can explore and interact with the environment. Characters can withstand limited damage but will die after sustained injury. There is no penalty for falling onto a solid surface, but falling into bottomless pits or toxic pools kills the player character immediately. When Chell dies in the single-player game, the game restarts from a recent [[Checkpoint (video gaming)#Checkpoints|checkpoint]];<ref name=\"gi reveal\" /> in the cooperative game, the robot [[Spawning (video gaming)|respawns]] shortly afterwards without restarting the puzzle.<ref name=\"pcworld interview\" /> The goal of both campaigns is to explore the Aperture Science Laboratory\u2014a complicated, malleable mechanized maze. While most of the game takes place in modular test chambers with clearly defined entrances and exits, other parts occur in behind-the-scenes areas where the objective is less clear.\n\nThe initial tutorial levels guide the player through the general movement controls and illustrate how to interact with the environment. The player must solve puzzles using the 'portal gun' or 'Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device', which can create two portals connecting two distant surfaces depicted as matte white, continuous, and flat. Characters can use these portals to move between rooms or to \"fling\" objects or themselves across a distance. Outlines of placed portals are visible through walls and other obstacles for easy location.<ref name=\"cvg edge l4d\">{{cite web | url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/288474/news/portal-2-influenced-by-left-4-dead-valve/ | title = Portal 2 influenced by Left 4 Dead \u2013 Valve | work = [[Computer and Video Games]] | date = February 11, 2011 | accessdate = February 11, 2011 | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110213144938/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/288474/news/portal-2-influenced-by-left-4-dead-valve/ | archivedate = February 13, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"telegraph interview\">{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/8359173/Portal-2-developer-interview-Chet-Falisek-and-Erik-Wolpaw.html | title = Portal 2 developer interview: Chet Falisek and Erik Wolpaw | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = March 4, 2011 | accessdate = March 4, 2011 | first = David | last = Brown | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110309212313/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/8359173/Portal-2-developer-interview-Chet-Falisek-and-Erik-Wolpaw.html | archivedate = March 9, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nGame elements include Thermal Discouragement Beams ([[laser]]s), Excursion Funnels ([[tractor beam]]s), and Hard Light Bridges, all of which can be transmitted through portals.<ref name=\"gi reveal\" /><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/253854/news/two-more-portal-2-e3-gameplay-videos/ | title = Two more Portal 2 E3 gameplay videos | first = Mike | last = Jackson | date = June 29, 2010 | accessdate =July 1, 2010 | publisher = [[Computer and Video Games]]}}</ref><ref name=\"g4tv pax\" /><ref name=\"ign pax\">{{cite web | url= http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/111/1118382p1.html | title = Portal 2 Multiplayer Preview | first = Arthur | last = Gies | date =September 6, 2010 | accessdate =September 6, 2010 | publisher = IGN | archivedate=January 25, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125084337/http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/111/1118382p1.html}}</ref> Aerial Faith Plates launch the player or objects through the air and sometimes into portals.

announced on March 5, 2010, via ''[[Game Informer]]''. Events during the preceding week foreshadowed the announcement. On March 1, Valve released a patch for ''Portal'' that included a new achievement, \"Transmission Received\", requiring the player to manipulate in-game radios. This revealed new sound effects that became part of an [[alternate reality game]] (ARG).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/195026/anatomy_of_an_alternatereality_game.html | title = Anatomy of an Alternate-Reality Game | date = April 26, 2010 | accessdate = May 13, 2010 | publisher = [[GamePro]] | first = Alex | last = Wawro | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100501031529/http://www.pcworld.com/article/195026/anatomy_of_an_alternatereality_game.html | archivedate = May 1, 2010 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Some of the new effects were of [[Morse code]] strings that suggested GLaDOS was rebooting, while others could be decoded as [[Slow-scan television|SSTV]] images from grainy Aperture Science videos.

Four weeks after its construction, the Henderson respirator was used to save the life of a 10-year-old boy from New Deer, Aberdeenshire, who was suffering from poliomyelitis. Despite this success, Henderson was reprimanded for secretly using hospital facilities to build the machine.<ref name=\"Wills\">{{cite book| last=Wills| first=Elspeth| title=Scottish Firsts: A Celebration of Innovation and Achievement| publisher=[[Mainstream Publishing]]| location=Edinburgh| year=2002| pages=[https://archive.org/details/scottishfirstsce00will/page/51 51\u20132]| isbn=978-1840186116| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/scottishfirstsce00will/page/51}}</ref><ref name=\"Thomas\">{{cite web| last=Thomas| first=Campbell| date=15 February 2000| url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/dr-robert-henderson-1.249085| title=Dr Robert Henderson | work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]| accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Both respirator===\n[[File:Both Cabinet Respirator in WWII.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Both cabinet respirator being used to treat a patient at the 110th Australian Military Hospital in 1943]]\n{{main|Both respirator}}\nThe [[Both respirator]], a negative pressure ventilator, was invented in 1937 when Australia's epidemic of poliomyelitis created an immediate need for more ventilating machines to compensate for respiratory paralysis. Although the Drinker model was effective and saved lives, its widespread use was hindered by the fact that the machines were very large, heavy (about 750 lbs), bulky, and expensive. In the US, an adult machine cost about $2000 in 1930, and \u00a32000 delivered to Melbourne in 1936. The cost in Europe in the mid-1950s was around \u00a31500.

Most patients with paralysis of the breathing muscles use modern [[mechanical ventilation|mechanical ventilators]] that push air into the airway with positive pressure. These are generally efficacious and have the advantage of not restricting patients' movements or caregivers' ability to examine the patients as significantly as an iron lung does. However, [[wikt:negative pressure|negative pressure]] ventilation is a truer approximation of normal physiological breathing and results in more normal distribution of air in the lungs. It may also be preferable in certain rare conditions, such as [[central hypoventilation syndrome]], in which failure of the medullary respiratory centers at the base of the brain results in patients having no [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic control]] of breathing. At least one reported polio patient, [[Dianne Odell]], had a spinal deformity that caused the use of mechanical ventilators to be [[contraindicated]].<ref name=Sydney2008>{{cite news|author=|title=Power failure kills iron lung lady|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=2008-05-29|url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/world/power-failure-kills-iron-lung-lady/2008/05/29/1211654160059.html|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref> \n\n=== Continued use ===\nThere are patients who today still use the older machines, often in their homes, despite the occasional difficulty of finding the various replacement parts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/health/60-years-iron-lung-us-polio-survivor-worries-about-new-2D11641456|title=60 years in an iron lung: US polio survivor worries about new global threat|publisher=}}</ref> Joan Headley of [[Post-Polio Health International]] said that as of May 28, 2008, there were about 30 patients in the U.S. still using an iron lung.<ref name=CNN2008>{{cite news|title=Woman dies after life spent in iron lung |date=May 28, 2008 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/05/28/iron.lung.death.ap/index.html |accessdate=2011-07-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022162511/http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/05/28/iron.lung.death.ap/index.html |archivedate=October 22, 2008 }}</ref> That figure may be inaccurately low; [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] alone had 19 iron lung patients living at home in 2008.<ref name=Neergaard2009>{{cite news|author=Lauran Neergaard|title=Emergency officials struggle to find those on life-support during power outages|date=2009-01-13|url=http://www.ems1.com/survivability/articles/447100-Emergency-officials-struggle-to-find-those-on-life-support-during-power-outages|accessdate=2014-01-01}}</ref> [[Martha Mason (writer)|Martha Mason]] of [[Lattimore, North Carolina]], died on May 4, 2009, after spending 60 of her 72 years in an iron lung.<ref name=Fox2009>{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Margalit|title=Martha Mason, Who Wrote Book About Her Decades in an Iron Lung, Dies at 71|work=The New York Times|date=2009-05-10|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/10/us/10mason.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=iron%20lung&st=cse|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref>\n\nOn 30 October 2009, [[June Middleton]] of [[Melbourne, Australia]], who had been entered in the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' as the person who spent the longest time in an iron lung, died aged 83, having spent more than 60 years in her iron lung.<ref name=Sydney2009>{{cite news|author=|title=Dead after 60 years in iron lung|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=2009-11-01|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/dead-after-60-years-in-iron-lung-20091101-hqyy.html?autostart=1|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the [[Post-Polio Health International]] (PHI) organizations estimated that there were only six to eight iron lung users in the United States; as of 2017 its executive director knew of none.

He then moved to the ''[[Financial Times of Canada]]'' where he worked as the national affairs columnist and Ottawa editor. In the late 1970s he went to the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' where he served as editorial page editor and then editor-in-chief.\n\nIn his journalism career, Radwanski won two National Newspaper Awards for editorial writing. In 1971, he published ''No Mandate But Terror'' with Kendal Windeyer, an account of the [[October Crisis]].  In 1978, he published ''Trudeau,'' a best-selling political biography of then-[[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Elliot Trudeau]].\n\n==Radwanski Report==\nRadwanski resigned from the ''Star'' in 1985 and accepted an appointment by [[Premier of Ontario|Ontario Premier]] [[David Peterson]] to head up an inquiry for the Ministry of Education into Ontario's drop-out report.\n\nRadwanski's findings were published in 1987 as the ''Ontario Study of the Relevance of Education, and the Issue of Dropouts'' commonly known as the ''Radwanski Report''.  Radwanski concluded that the education system had become irrelevant due to the economy's shift from manufacturing to services. He found that students were uninterested in what they were being taught and did not gain the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in a modern economy.\n\nHe issued a series of recommendations including the implementation of [[early childhood education]], standardized testing, \"destreaming\" of high schools, an \"outcome-based\" education and the replacement of the credit system with a common core curriculum.\n\nSeveral of his recommendations were taken up by subsequent governments including destreaming in grade nine (though not later), an outcomes-based curriculum in grades 1 to 9 and standardized testing at various levels.[http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/general/abcs/rcom/full/volume1/chapter2.html#note13]\n\nFollowing his study, Radwanski became a public policy and communications consultant in both the public and private sectors. In 1996 he was appointed by the federal government to conduct a review of [[Canada Post Corporation]]'s mandate.\n\nRadwanski also served as a speech writer to Prime Minister [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]], who later appointed him Privacy Commissioner.\n\n==Privacy Commissioner==\nAs Privacy Commissioner, Radwanski was outspoken in his criticism of increased surveillance by the state in the wake of [[September 11, 2001 attacks|the 9-11]] attacks early in his tenure and the subsequent \"[[War on Terror]]\". In his annual report in the months following 9-11, he asserted:\n\n:\"The fundamental human right of privacy in Canada is under assault as never before. Unless the Government of Canada is quickly dissuaded from its present course by Parliamentary action and public insistence, we are on a path that may well lead to the permanent loss not only of privacy rights but also important elements of freedom as we now know it...\"\n\n:\"The Government is, quite simply, using September 11 as an excuse for new [surveillance databases] that cannot be justified by the requirements of anti-terrorism and that, indeed, have no place in a free and democratic society...\" [https://web.archive.org/web/20060407042133/http://privcom.gc.ca/information/ar/02_04_10_e.asp]\n\nRadwanski successfully campaigned against and brought an end to major federal government intrusions on privacy rights, including provisions of Bill C-36 that would have undermined the Privacy Act; the opening of letter mail by Customs agents; and the creation of a comprehensive, all-purpose seven-year Canada Customs and Revenue Agency data base on the foreign travel activities of all Canadians. He initiated a Charter challenge, later aborted by his successor, against RCMP video surveillance of public streets as a municipal police force in Kelowna, B.C., and gave 93 speeches in less than three years across Canada and abroad, along with hundreds of media interviews, to raise public awareness about privacy issues in the post-9/11 environment. He also oversaw the smooth implementation of the new federal private sector privacy law, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, that came into effect beginning in 2001.\n\nRadwanski resigned in June 2003, less than half way into his seven-year term, while under attack by a parliamentary committee for lavish spending. An investigation by the parliamentary committee charged that he racked up $500,000 in travel and hospitality expenses and misled the [[House of Commons of Canada]] over lax spending practices in his office. The committee also accused Radwanski of falsifying a document sent to it. On November 6, 2003, Radwanski apologized to Parliament \"without reservation\" for showing lack of respect, and expressed remorse for \"errors in judgment with regard to administrative and financial matters\" during his tenure. MPs later voted unanimously to find him in contempt of Parliament for providing misleading information about his spending.\n\nOn March 15, 2006 he was charged with [[fraud]] and breach of trust following a 26-month-long [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] investigation into his expense claims while a public servant that was prompted by the Auditor General's report.<ref>https://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1142420587696&call_pageid=968332188492&col=968793972154&t=TS_Home {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606154446/http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar%2FLayout%2FArticle_Type1&c=Article&cid=1142420587696&call_pageid=968332188492&col=968793972154&t=TS_Home |date=2011-06-06 }}</ref> \nHe was acquitted on all counts on February 13, 2009, although his former chief of staff Art Lamarche was convicted for breach of trust by an Ontario Court judge.<ref>http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/02/13/radwanski-trial.html</ref><ref>https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20090214.RADWANSKI14/TPStory{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Criminal lawyer Mr. Michael A.

He found that students were uninterested in what they were being taught and did not gain the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in a modern economy.\n\nHe issued a series of recommendations including the implementation of [[early childhood education]], standardized testing, \"destreaming\" of high schools, an \"outcome-based\" education and the replacement of the credit system with a common core curriculum.\n\nSeveral of his recommendations were taken up by subsequent governments including destreaming in grade nine (though not later), an outcomes-based curriculum in grades 1 to 9 and standardized testing at various levels.[http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/general/abcs/rcom/full/volume1/chapter2.html#note13]\n\nFollowing his study, Radwanski became a public policy and communications consultant in both the public and private sectors. In 1996 he was appointed by the federal government to conduct a review of [[Canada Post Corporation]]'s mandate.\n\nRadwanski also served as a speech writer to Prime Minister [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]], who later appointed him Privacy Commissioner.\n\n==Privacy Commissioner==\nAs Privacy Commissioner, Radwanski was outspoken in his criticism of increased surveillance by the state in the wake of [[September 11, 2001 attacks|the 9-11]] attacks early in his tenure and the subsequent \"[[War on Terror]]\". In his annual report in the months following 9-11, he asserted:\n\n:\"The fundamental human right of privacy in Canada is under assault as never before. Unless the Government of Canada is quickly dissuaded from its present course by Parliamentary action and public insistence, we are on a path that may well lead to the permanent loss not only of privacy rights but also important elements of freedom as we now know it...\"\n\n:\"The Government is, quite simply, using September 11 as an excuse for new [surveillance databases] that cannot be justified by the requirements of anti-terrorism and that, indeed, have no place in a free and democratic society...\" [https://web.archive.org/web/20060407042133/http://privcom.gc.ca/information/ar/02_04_10_e.asp]\n\nRadwanski successfully campaigned against and brought an end to major federal government intrusions on privacy rights, including provisions of Bill C-36 that would have undermined the Privacy Act; the opening of letter mail by Customs agents; and the creation of a comprehensive, all-purpose seven-year Canada Customs and Revenue Agency data base on the foreign travel activities of all Canadians. He initiated a Charter challenge, later aborted by his successor, against RCMP video surveillance of public streets as a municipal police force in Kelowna, B.C., and gave 93 speeches in less than three years across Canada and abroad, along with hundreds of media interviews, to raise public awareness about privacy issues in the post-9/11 environment. He also oversaw the smooth implementation of the new federal private sector privacy law, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, that came into effect beginning in 2001.\n\nRadwanski resigned in June 2003, less than half way into his seven-year term, while under attack by a parliamentary committee for lavish spending. An investigation by the parliamentary committee charged that he racked up $500,000 in travel and hospitality expenses and misled the [[House of Commons of Canada]] over lax spending practices in his office. The committee also accused Radwanski of falsifying a document sent to it. On November 6, 2003, Radwanski apologized to Parliament \"without reservation\" for showing lack of respect, and expressed remorse for \"errors in judgment with regard to administrative and financial matters\" during his tenure. MPs later voted unanimously to find him in contempt of Parliament for providing misleading information about his spending.\n\nOn March 15, 2006 he was charged with [[fraud]] and breach of trust following a 26-month-long [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] investigation into his expense claims while a public servant that was prompted by the Auditor General's report.<ref>https://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1142420587696&call_pageid=968332188492&col=968793972154&t=TS_Home {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606154446/http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar%2FLayout%2FArticle_Type1&c=Article&cid=1142420587696&call_pageid=968332188492&col=968793972154&t=TS_Home |date=2011-06-06 }}</ref> \nHe was acquitted on all counts on February 13, 2009, although his former chief of staff Art Lamarche was convicted for breach of trust by an Ontario Court judge.<ref>http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/02/13/radwanski-trial.html</ref><ref>https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20090214.RADWANSKI14/TPStory{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Criminal lawyer Mr. Michael A.

Classical SH3 domains are restricted in humans to intracellular proteins, although the small human MIA family of extracellular proteins also contain a domain with an SH3-like fold.\n\nMany SH3-binding epitopes of proteins have a [[consensus sequence]] that can be represented as a regular expression or [[Short linear motif]]:\n -X-P-p-X-P-\n  1 2 3 4 5\n\nwith 1 and 4 being [[aliphatic]] amino acids, 2 and 5 always and 3 sometimes being proline.

These units form covalent \u03b2-(1\u21924)-linkages (like the linkages between [[glucose]] units forming [[cellulose]]). Therefore, chitin may be described as [[cellulose]] with one [[hydroxyl]] group on each [[monomer]] replaced with an [[acetyl]] [[amine]] group. This allows for increased [[hydrogen bonding]] between adjacent [[polymers]], giving the chitin-polymer matrix increased strength.\n\n[[Image:Lyristes plebejus.jpg|thumb|right|A [[cicada]] emerges from its chitinous larval exoskeleton.]]\nIn its pure, unmodified form, chitin is translucent, pliable, resilient, and quite tough. In most [[arthropod]]s, however, it is often modified, occurring largely as a component of [[composite material]]s, such as in [[sclerotin]], a tanned [[protein]]aceous matrix, which forms much of the [[exoskeleton]] of [[insect]]s. Combined with [[calcium carbonate]], as in the shells of [[crustacean]]s and [[mollusc]]s, chitin produces a much stronger composite. This composite material is much harder and stiffer than pure chitin, and is tougher and less brittle than pure [[calcium carbonate]].<ref name=\"Campbell\">Campbell, N. A.

These units form covalent \u03b2-(1\u21924)-linkages (like the linkages between [[glucose]] units forming [[cellulose]]). Therefore, chitin may be described as [[cellulose]] with one [[hydroxyl]] group on each [[monomer]] replaced with an [[acetyl]] [[amine]] group. This allows for increased [[hydrogen bonding]] between adjacent [[polymers]], giving the chitin-polymer matrix increased strength.\n\n[[Image:Lyristes plebejus.jpg|thumb|right|A [[cicada]] emerges from its chitinous larval exoskeleton.]]\nIn its pure, unmodified form, chitin is translucent, pliable, resilient, and quite tough. In most [[arthropod]]s, however, it is often modified, occurring largely as a component of [[composite material]]s, such as in [[sclerotin]], a tanned [[protein]]aceous matrix, which forms much of the [[exoskeleton]] of [[insect]]s. Combined with [[calcium carbonate]], as in the shells of [[crustacean]]s and [[mollusc]]s, chitin produces a much stronger composite. This composite material is much harder and stiffer than pure chitin, and is tougher and less brittle than pure [[calcium carbonate]].<ref name=\"Campbell\">Campbell, N. A.

In order to marry '''out of community of property''', the parties must sign an antenuptial contract in the presence of a [[notary public]] prior to their marriage and the contract must be registered in the Deeds Office within three months from the date of signature of the contract.\n\nWhen marrying out of community, the parties have a choice to marry ''with application of the accrual system'' or '''without application of the accrual system'''.\n\nIn the event that the parties marry '''without accrual''', the spouses\u2019 respective estates would always remain separate and neither party will have any proprietary claim against the other by virtue of the marriage.\n\nIf the parties marry '''with application of the accrual''', their respective estates would remain separate during the subsistence of the marriage. Upon dissolution of the marriage, whether by death or divorce, the spouse with the lesser accrual would have a claim against the spouse with the larger accrual for half the difference between their accrual values.\n\n===Eurasia===\n====Asia====\n=====India=====\nIn [[India]], prenuptial agreements are very rare and do not have any governing laws. However, with rising divorce rates people are showing increasing interest in them. Some lawyers are of the opinion that prenups don't have legal sanctity in India. However, some form of contract is signed in some cases, usually among affluent citizens. But, the agreements need to be reasonable and not violate pre-existing laws like the [[Hindu Marriage Act]]. Indian courts allow a memorandum of settlement to be signed during divorces.

While in some of these countries there are limits on what restrictions the courts will see as enforceable or valid (e.g. Germany after 2001, where appeals courts have indicated this), a written and properly initiated contract, freely agreed upon, cannot be challenged by, for instance, invoking the circumstances under which the marriage broke down or the conduct of either part. In France and Belgium (as in [[Quebec]], which has the same judicial tradition) prenuptial agreements must be set up in the presence of a [[notaries|notary]].\n\nIn many of the countries mentioned, prenuptials may also protect the non-shared property and money from being pulled into a bankruptcy and can serve to support lawsuits and settlements during the marriage (for instance if one part has sold or wrongfully mortgaged a piece of property that had been set aside by his/her partner).\n\n=====Ukraine=====\nIn accordance with provisions of Section 10 of the Family Code of Ukraine, marriage relationships, rights and duties of spouses can be regulated by a Marriage contract as well if spouses wish to settle their property relations in other manner then it is provided by the Family Code of Ukraine.\n\nMarriage (prenuptial) contract can be concluded by a woman and a man, who applied for registration of their marriage as well as by spouses. Underaged person, who wants to conclude a marriage contract before registration of the marriage, is to have a signed consent of his/her parent or custodian certified by a notary.\n\nNumerous provisions of this section of the Family Code of Ukraine provide quite extensive requirements as regarding the form and contents of the marriage contract and the procedural issues of making the same are regulated by appropriate Instruction of the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine as regarding the procedure of notarization of marriage contracts as well as far as notarization is required.\n\nImperative requirements as regarding content of the marriage contract are provided by clause 93 of the Family Code of Ukraine, which states that the marriage contract governs property relations between spouses, determines their property rights and duties. Marriage contract can also determine property rights and duties of spouses as parents, but with certain limitations. Personal relations of spouses cannot be regulated by the marriage contract, as well as personal relations between spouses and their children. This rule is also provided by clause 93 of the Family Code of Ukraine. Marriage contract, which reduce rights of children and put one of spouses on a poor material state, are not permitted by the above imperative regulation. Within the frameworks of the marriage contract none of spouses can acquire any immovable property or other property, which requires the state registration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ukrconsulting.biz/Law-Firm-Ukraine-Kharkov-English/Marriage-prenuptial-contract-in-Ukraine-Kharkov-Kharkiv.html|title=Marriage (prenuptial) contract in Ukraine|last=LLC.|first=UKRCONSULTING LAW FIRM|website=ukrconsulting.biz|language=ru-ru|access-date=2017-07-05}}</ref>\n\n=====United Kingdom=====\n======England and Wales======\nPrenuptial agreements historically had not been considered legally enforceable in England and Wales due to a reluctance on the part of the judiciary for public policy reasons. \n\nThe 2010 Supreme Court test case of ''[[Radmacher v Granatino]]'', overturned the previous legal framework on them to recognise changing societal and judicial views on the personal autonomy of married partners.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2010/oct/20/prenuptial-agreement-enforced-uk-law | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Owen | last=Bowcott | title=Prenup agreement enforced under UK law | date=20 October 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Croft |first1=Jane |title=UK court upholds prenuptial deal for heiress |url=https://www.ft.com/content/b0624326-dc2a-11df-a9a4-00144feabdc0 |accessdate=9 April 2019 |agency=Financial Times |date=6 November 2010}}</ref> Pre-nuptial agreements can now be enforced by the courts as part of their discretion in financial settlement cases under section 25 of the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]] so long as the three stage ''Radmacher'' test is met and it is considered fair to do so, keeping in mind the interests of any child of the family. ''Radmacher'' holds that the courts will give effect to a nuptial agreement that is freely entered into by each party with a full appreciation of its implications unless, in the circumstances prevailing, it would not be fair to hold the parties to their agreement.

The UPAA was partly enacted to ensure that a prenup that was validly entered into in one state would be honored by the courts of another state where the couple might get a divorce.  The UPMAA was subsequently promulgated in 2012 by the ULC to clarify and modernize inconsistent state laws, and create a uniform approach to all prenuptial agreements and postnuptial agreements that:\n\n# Requires marital agreements to be in writing and declares them to be enforceable without consideration, modernizing existing state laws;\n# Offers couples a flexible framework for premarital agreements that promotes responsible planning and informed decision-making; and\n# Provides courts in every state a framework for determining an agreement\u2019s validity, regardless of where it was executed.<ref>''Why States Should Adopt the Uniform Premarital and Marital Agreements Act'', 2012, Uniform Law Commission, National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.</ref>\n\nThe laws enacted by states adopting the UPAA/UPMAA do have some variances from state-to-state, but this framework of laws has certainly made it much easier for legal practitioners to prepare enforceable marital agreements for clients by clearly stating the requirements.  For instance, under Florida law, there is a '''''very''''' material difference in what is required to enter into a legally binding prenuptial agreement versus a postnuptial agreement.\u00a0 In order to validly waive the spousal rights that would ordinarily be available to a surviving spouse under Florida law (such as homestead, elective share, exempt property, family allowance, etc.), the parties have to make a full and fair disclosure of their assets and liabilities to each other ''before'' entering into a postnuptial agreement. In contrast, no financial disclosure is required to waive those same spousal rights in a premarital agreement executed ''before'' marriage.<ref>''See'' Fla. Stat. Ann.

Note that states have different versions of the UPAA.\n\nUnlike all other contract law, [[consideration]] is not required, although a minority of courts point to the marriage itself as the consideration. Through a prenup, a spouse can completely waive rights to property, alimony or inheritance as well as the elective share and get nothing in return. [[Choice of law]] provisions are critical in prenups. Parties to the agreement can elect to have the law of the state they are married in govern both the interpretation of the agreement and how property is divided at the time of divorce.  In the absence of a choice of law clause it is the law of the place the parties divorce, not the law of the state they were married that decides property and support issues.\n\nIn drafting an agreement, it is important to recognize that there are two types of state laws that govern divorce{{spaced ndash}}[[equitable distribution]], practiced by 41 states, and [[community property]], practiced in some variation by 9 states.  An agreement written in a community property state may not be designed to govern what occurs in an equitable distribution state and vice versa.  It may be necessary to retain attorneys in both states to cover the possible eventuality that the parties may live in a state other than the state they were married.  Often people have more than one home in different states or they move a lot because of their work so it is important to take that into account in the drafting process.\n\nWith respect to financial issues ancillary to divorce, prenuptial agreements are routinely upheld and enforced by courts in virtually all states.  There are circumstances in which courts have refused to enforce certain portions/provisions of such agreements.  For example, in [[North Dakota]] the divorce courts retain jurisdiction to modify a limitation on the right to seek alimony or spousal support in a premarital agreement if it would cause the spouse who waived such right to need public assistance at the time of divorce.<ref>''See'' N.D.

Parties must wait seven days after the premarital agreement is first presented for review before they sign it, but there is no requirement that this be done a certain number of days prior to the marriage.<ref>''See'' Cal.

If the prenup calls for the payment of a lump sum at the time of divorce, it may be deemed to promote divorce.  This concept has come under attack and a lawyer should be consulted to make sure the prenup does not violate this provision.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn California, through a prenuptial agreement a couple may waive their rights to share property (community property).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tour-Sarkissian|first1=Christine|title=When Does Separate Property Become Community Property (or Vice Versa)?|journal=Real Property Law Reporter, Continuing Education of the Bar|date=7 July 2016|url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=2912717|accessdate=27 August 2017}}</ref> The agreement can limit spousal support (although a court at the divorce can set this aside if it deems that the limitation is unconscionable).  The agreement can act as a contract to make a will requiring one spouse to provide for the other at death.  It can also limit probate rights at death, such as the right to a probate allowance, the right to act an executor, the right to take as a predetermined heir, and so forth.<ref name=\"calfc\"/> In California, Registered Domestic Partners may also enter into a prenup. Postmarital agreements are treated very differently in California law. Spouses have a fiduciary duty to one another so premarital agreements come under a special category of agreements. There is a presumption that the postmarital agreement was obtained by undue influence if one party gains an advantage.  Disclosure cannot be waived in the context of a postmarital agreement.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Oceania===\n====Australia====\nPrenuptial agreements are recognised in Australia by the Family Law Act 1975 (Commonwealth).<ref>{{cite web|title=Family Law Act 1975 - Sect 90C|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s90c.html|work=Commonwealth Consolidated Acts|publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute|accessdate=18 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Premarital mediation==\nPremarital mediation is an alternative way of creating a prenuptial agreement.  In this process, a mediator facilitates an open discussion between the couple about all kinds of marital issues, like expectations about working after children are born and saving and spending styles as well as the traditional premarital discussions about property division and spousal support if the marriage is terminated.  The engaged couple makes all of the decisions about what would happen in the event of a separation or divorce with the assistance of the mediator.  They then draft either a deal memo or a premarital agreement and have it reviewed by their respective attorneys.  An agreement developed via [[mediation]] is typically less expensive because fewer hours are spent with attorneys because the couple has made all of the decisions together, rather than one side vs. the other.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\n== Catholicism ==\nPrenuptial agreements are a matter of civil law, so Catholic [[canon law]] does not rule them out in principle (for example, to determine how property would be divided among the children of a prior marriage upon the death of one spouse).\n\nIn practice, prenuptials may run afoul of Church law in a number of ways. For example, they cannot subject a marriage to a condition concerning the future. The Code of Canon Law provides: \"A marriage subject to a condition about the future cannot be contracted validly\". (CIC 1102)\n\n''The Canon Law: Letter and Spirit'', a commentary on canon law, explains that condition may be defined as \"a stipulation by which an agreement is made contingent upon the verification or fulfillment of some circumstance or event that is not yet certain\". It goes on to state that \"any condition concerning the future attached to matrimonial consent renders marriage invalid\". For example, a marriage would be invalid if the parties stipulated that they must have children or they have the right to divorce and remarry someone else.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n== Judaism ==\n{{Main|Jewish prenuptial agreement|Ketubah}}\n\nIn Judaism, the ''[[ketubah]]'', a prenuptial contract, has long been established as an integral part of the [[Jewish views of marriage|Jewish marriage]], and is signed and read aloud at the marriage ceremony. It contains the husband's requirement to support his wife by providing her with food, clothing and sex, as well as providing for the wife's support in the case of divorce or the husband's death.  However, under this passage, a woman is free to leave if her husband doesn't provide for her.\n\nIn 2004, the High Court of South Africa upheld a cherem against a Johannesburg businessman because he refused to pay his former wife alimony as ordered by [[The Johannesburg Beth Din]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bregmans.co.za/court-upholds-jewish-orthodox-right-of-excommunication/|title=Court upholds Jewish Orthodox right of excommunication|first=|last=Bregmans|date=8 May 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nRecently, a movement supporting an additional prenuptial agreement has emerged in some [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] circles. This is in response to a growing number of cases in which the husband refuses to grant ''[[Get (divorce document)|gett]]'', a religious divorce. In such matters, the local authorities are unable to intervene, both out of concerns regarding [[separation of church and state]] and certain ''[[Jewish law|halakhic]]'' problems that would arise. This situation leaves the wife in a state of {{transl|heb|[[agunah|aginut]]}}, in which she is unable to remarry. To remedy this situation, the movement promotes a prenuptial agreement in which the couple agrees to conduct their divorce, should it occur, in a [[Beth din|rabbinical court]].\n\n== Islam ==\n{{main|Islamic marriage contract}}\nIn most Arabic and Islamic nations there is a [[Arab wedding#Marriage contract|marriage contract]], known traditionally as {{transl|ara|italic=no|aqd qeran, aqd nekah or aqd zawaj}}, that long been established as an integral part of an Islamic marriage and is signed at the marriage ceremony. In Egypt, Syria, Palestine, Jordan and Lebanon, but not in other nations or regions, this contract is widely known as {{transl|ara|italic=no|Katb el-Kitab}}. The contract is similar to the [[ketubah]] in Judaism, and outlines the rights and responsibilities of the groom and bride or other parties involved in the marriage proceedings. But this is different than prenuptial agreement, in that it does not define how assets are to be divided or inherited in the event of divorce or the  death of a spouse.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Awad |first1=Abed |title=Marriage Legal Foundations |url=https://www.academia.edu/29677976/Marriage_Legal_Foundations |website=Academia.edu |accessdate=15 April 2019 |page=625}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{commonscat-inline|Marriage contracts}}\n\n[[Category:Contract law]]\n[[Category:Family law]]\n[[Category:Legal documents]]\n[[Category:Marriage]]\n[[Category:Prenuptial agreements| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|Marriage contract|the semi-binding contract intended as a promise to wed|Engagement|the South Korean television series|Marriage Contract}}{{For|the album|Prenuptial Agreement (album)}}\n{{Family law|marriage}}\n\nA '''prenuptial agreement''', '''antenuptial agreement''', or '''premarital agreement''' (commonly referred to as a '''prenup'''), is a written [[contract]] entered into by a couple prior to [[marriage]] or a [[civil union]] that enables them to select and control many of the legal rights they acquire upon marrying, and what happens when their marriage eventually ends by death or divorce.

While in some of these countries there are limits on what restrictions the courts will see as enforceable or valid (e.g. Germany after 2001, where appeals courts have indicated this), a written and properly initiated contract, freely agreed upon, cannot be challenged by, for instance, invoking the circumstances under which the marriage broke down or the conduct of either part. In France and Belgium (as in [[Quebec]], which has the same judicial tradition) prenuptial agreements must be set up in the presence of a [[notaries|notary]].\n\nIn many of the countries mentioned, prenuptials may also protect the non-shared property and money from being pulled into a bankruptcy and can serve to support lawsuits and settlements during the marriage (for instance if one part has sold or wrongfully mortgaged a piece of property that had been set aside by his/her partner).\n\n=====Ukraine=====\nIn accordance with provisions of Section 10 of the Family Code of Ukraine, marriage relationships, rights and duties of spouses can be regulated by a Marriage contract as well if spouses wish to settle their property relations in other manner then it is provided by the Family Code of Ukraine.\n\nMarriage (prenuptial) contract can be concluded by a woman and a man, who applied for registration of their marriage as well as by spouses.

Marriage contract can also determine property rights and duties of spouses as parents, but with certain limitations. Personal relations of spouses cannot be regulated by the marriage contract, as well as personal relations between spouses and their children.

The UPMAA was subsequently promulgated in 2012 by the ULC to clarify and modernize inconsistent state laws, and create a uniform approach to all prenuptial agreements and postnuptial agreements that:\n\n# Requires marital agreements to be in writing and declares them to be enforceable without consideration, modernizing existing state laws;\n# Offers couples a flexible framework for premarital agreements that promotes responsible planning and informed decision-making; and\n# Provides courts in every state a framework for determining an agreement\u2019s validity, regardless of where it was executed.<ref>''Why States Should Adopt the Uniform Premarital and Marital Agreements Act'', 2012, Uniform Law Commission, National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.</ref>\n\nThe laws enacted by states adopting the UPAA/UPMAA do have some variances from state-to-state, but this framework of laws has certainly made it much easier for legal practitioners to prepare enforceable marital agreements for clients by clearly stating the requirements.  For instance, under Florida law, there is a '''''very''''' material difference in what is required to enter into a legally binding prenuptial agreement versus a postnuptial agreement.\u00a0 In order to validly waive the spousal rights that would ordinarily be available to a surviving spouse under Florida law (such as homestead, elective share, exempt property, family allowance, etc.), the parties have to make a full and fair disclosure of their assets and liabilities to each other ''before'' entering into a postnuptial agreement. In contrast, no financial disclosure is required to waive those same spousal rights in a premarital agreement executed ''before'' marriage.<ref>''See'' Fla. Stat. Ann.

In states that have adopted the UPAA ([[Uniform Premarital Agreement Act]]), no sunset provision is provided by statute, but one could be privately contracted for.  Note that states have different versions of the UPAA.\n\nUnlike all other contract law, [[consideration]] is not required, although a minority of courts point to the marriage itself as the consideration. Through a prenup, a spouse can completely waive rights to property, alimony or inheritance as well as the elective share and get nothing in return. [[Choice of law]] provisions are critical in prenups. Parties to the agreement can elect to have the law of the state they are married in govern both the interpretation of the agreement and how property is divided at the time of divorce.  In the absence of a choice of law clause it is the law of the place the parties divorce, not the law of the state they were married that decides property and support issues.\n\nIn drafting an agreement, it is important to recognize that there are two types of state laws that govern divorce{{spaced ndash}}[[equitable distribution]], practiced by 41 states, and [[community property]], practiced in some variation by 9 states.  An agreement written in a community property state may not be designed to govern what occurs in an equitable distribution state and vice versa.  It may be necessary to retain attorneys in both states to cover the possible eventuality that the parties may live in a state other than the state they were married.  Often people have more than one home in different states or they move a lot because of their work so it is important to take that into account in the drafting process.\n\nWith respect to financial issues ancillary to divorce, prenuptial agreements are routinely upheld and enforced by courts in virtually all states.  There are circumstances in which courts have refused to enforce certain portions/provisions of such agreements.  For example, in [[North Dakota]] the divorce courts retain jurisdiction to modify a limitation on the right to seek alimony or spousal support in a premarital agreement if it would cause the spouse who waived such right to need public assistance at the time of divorce.<ref>''See'' N.D. Cent. Code [https://www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t14c03-2.pdf \u00a7 14-03.2-08(5)].</ref> [[Florida]] and several other states contain similar limitations to avoid a divorcing spouse from becoming a ward of the state upon divorce by virtue of a prenuptial agreement.<ref>''See'' Fla.

Hodges]] (Decided June 26, 2015).

Parties must wait seven days after the premarital agreement is first presented for review before they sign it, but there is no requirement that this be done a certain number of days prior to the marriage.<ref>''See'' Cal.

Postmarital agreements are treated very differently in California law. Spouses have a fiduciary duty to one another so premarital agreements come under a special category of agreements. There is a presumption that the postmarital agreement was obtained by undue influence if one party gains an advantage.  Disclosure cannot be waived in the context of a postmarital agreement.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Oceania===\n====Australia====\nPrenuptial agreements are recognised in Australia by the Family Law Act 1975 (Commonwealth).<ref>{{cite web|title=Family Law Act 1975 - Sect 90C|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s90c.html|work=Commonwealth Consolidated Acts|publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute|accessdate=18 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Premarital mediation==\nPremarital mediation is an alternative way of creating a prenuptial agreement.  In this process, a mediator facilitates an open discussion between the couple about all kinds of marital issues, like expectations about working after children are born and saving and spending styles as well as the traditional premarital discussions about property division and spousal support if the marriage is terminated.  The engaged couple makes all of the decisions about what would happen in the event of a separation or divorce with the assistance of the mediator.  They then draft either a deal memo or a premarital agreement and have it reviewed by their respective attorneys.  An agreement developed via [[mediation]] is typically less expensive because fewer hours are spent with attorneys because the couple has made all of the decisions together, rather than one side vs. the other.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\n== Catholicism ==\nPrenuptial agreements are a matter of civil law, so Catholic [[canon law]] does not rule them out in principle (for example, to determine how property would be divided among the children of a prior marriage upon the death of one spouse).\n\nIn practice, prenuptials may run afoul of Church law in a number of ways. For example, they cannot subject a marriage to a condition concerning the future. The Code of Canon Law provides: \"A marriage subject to a condition about the future cannot be contracted validly\". (CIC 1102)\n\n''The Canon Law: Letter and Spirit'', a commentary on canon law, explains that condition may be defined as \"a stipulation by which an agreement is made contingent upon the verification or fulfillment of some circumstance or event that is not yet certain\". It goes on to state that \"any condition concerning the future attached to matrimonial consent renders marriage invalid\". For example, a marriage would be invalid if the parties stipulated that they must have children or they have the right to divorce and remarry someone else.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n== Judaism ==\n{{Main|Jewish prenuptial agreement|Ketubah}}\n\nIn Judaism, the ''[[ketubah]]'', a prenuptial contract, has long been established as an integral part of the [[Jewish views of marriage|Jewish marriage]], and is signed and read aloud at the marriage ceremony. It contains the husband's requirement to support his wife by providing her with food, clothing and sex, as well as providing for the wife's support in the case of divorce or the husband's death.  However, under this passage, a woman is free to leave if her husband doesn't provide for her.\n\nIn 2004, the High Court of South Africa upheld a cherem against a Johannesburg businessman because he refused to pay his former wife alimony as ordered by [[The Johannesburg Beth Din]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bregmans.co.za/court-upholds-jewish-orthodox-right-of-excommunication/|title=Court upholds Jewish Orthodox right of excommunication|first=|last=Bregmans|date=8 May 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nRecently, a movement supporting an additional prenuptial agreement has emerged in some [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] circles. This is in response to a growing number of cases in which the husband refuses to grant ''[[Get (divorce document)|gett]]'', a religious divorce. In such matters, the local authorities are unable to intervene, both out of concerns regarding [[separation of church and state]] and certain ''[[Jewish law|halakhic]]'' problems that would arise. This situation leaves the wife in a state of {{transl|heb|[[agunah|aginut]]}}, in which she is unable to remarry. To remedy this situation, the movement promotes a prenuptial agreement in which the couple agrees to conduct their divorce, should it occur, in a [[Beth din|rabbinical court]].\n\n== Islam ==\n{{main|Islamic marriage contract}}\nIn most Arabic and Islamic nations there is a [[Arab wedding#Marriage contract|marriage contract]], known traditionally as {{transl|ara|italic=no|aqd qeran, aqd nekah or aqd zawaj}}, that long been established as an integral part of an Islamic marriage and is signed at the marriage ceremony. In Egypt, Syria, Palestine, Jordan and Lebanon, but not in other nations or regions, this contract is widely known as {{transl|ara|italic=no|Katb el-Kitab}}. The contract is similar to the [[ketubah]] in Judaism, and outlines the rights and responsibilities of the groom and bride or other parties involved in the marriage proceedings. But this is different than prenuptial agreement, in that it does not define how assets are to be divided or inherited in the event of divorce or the  death of a spouse.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Awad |first1=Abed |title=Marriage Legal Foundations |url=https://www.academia.edu/29677976/Marriage_Legal_Foundations |website=Academia.edu |accessdate=15 April 2019 |page=625}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{commonscat-inline|Marriage contracts}}\n\n[[Category:Contract law]]\n[[Category:Family law]]\n[[Category:Legal documents]]\n[[Category:Marriage]]\n[[Category:Prenuptial agreements| ]]\n", "name_user": "76.243.192.47", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenuptial_agreement"}
