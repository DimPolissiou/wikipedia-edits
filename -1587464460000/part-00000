Russian, late 19th century, [[Kremlin Armoury]]]]\n\nJasper is an [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] rock of virtually any color stemming from the mineral content of the original sediments or ash.  Patterns arise during the consolidation process forming flow and depositional patterns in the original silica rich [[sediment]] or [[volcanic ash]]. [[Hydrothermal circulation]] is generally thought to be required in the formation of jasper.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nJasper can be modified by the diffusion of minerals along discontinuities providing the appearance of vegetative growth, i.e., [[Dendrite (crystal)|dendritic]]. The original materials are often fractured and/or distorted, after deposition, into diverse patterns, which are later filled in with other colorful minerals. Weathering, with time, will create intensely colored superficial rinds.\n\nThe classification and naming of jasper varieties presents a challenge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldofjaspers.com/index.html |title=World of Jaspers |publisher=Hans Gamma}}</ref> Terms attributed to various well-defined materials includes the geographic locality where it is found, sometimes quite restricted such as \"Bruneau\" (a canyon) and \"Lahontan\" (a lake), rivers and even individual mountains; many are fanciful, such as \"forest fire\" or \"rainbow\", while others are descriptive, such as \"autumn\" or \"porcelain\". A few are designated by the place of origin such as a brown Egyptian or red African.\n\n===Banded iron formations ===\nJasper is the main component in the silica-rich parts of [[Banded iron formation|banded iron formations]] (BIFs) which indicate low, but present, amounts of dissolved oxygen in the water such as during the [[Great Oxygenation Event|Great Oxidation Event]] or snowball earths.<ref>{{Cite book|title=How to Build a Habitable Planet|last=Broecker|first=W.S.|publisher=|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>  The red bands, typically more competent than the hematite layers surrounding it, are made of microcrystalline red chert, also called jasper.\n\n===Picture jaspers{{anchor|picture}}===\n[[File:Jasper earrings.jpg|thumb|Earrings of polished \"leopard-spot jasper\" (actually a type of spherulitic [[rhyolite]])]]\nPicture jaspers exhibit combinations of patterns {such as banding from flow or depositional patterns (from water or wind), dendritic or color variations} resulting in what appear to be scenes or images (on a cut section).  Diffusion from a center produces a distinctive [[Orbicular jasper|orbicular]] appearance, i.e., leopard skin jasper, or linear banding from a fracture as seen in leisegang jasper. Healed, fragmented rock produces [[breccia]]ted (broken) jasper.  \n\nWhile these \"picture jaspers\" can be found all over the world, specific colors or patterns are unique to the geographic region from which they originate. The primary source of the stone is [[Indonesia]], especially in [[Purbalingga]] district.[[Oregon]]'s [[Biggs jasper]], and [[Idaho]]'s [[Bruneau jasper]] from the [[Bruneau River]] canyon are particularly fine examples.

Russian, late 19th century, [[Kremlin Armoury]]]]\n\nJasper is an [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] rock of virtually any color stemming from the mineral content of the original sediments or ash.  Patterns arise during the consolidation process forming flow and depositional patterns in the original silica rich [[sediment]] or [[volcanic ash]]. [[Hydrothermal circulation]] is generally thought to be required in the formation of jasper.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nJasper can be modified by the diffusion of minerals along discontinuities providing the appearance of vegetative growth, i.e., [[Dendrite (crystal)|dendritic]]. The original materials are often fractured and/or distorted, after deposition, into diverse patterns, which are later filled in with other colorful minerals. Weathering, with time, will create intensely colored superficial rinds.\n\nThe classification and naming of jasper varieties presents a challenge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldofjaspers.com/index.html |title=World of Jaspers |publisher=Hans Gamma}}</ref> Terms attributed to various well-defined materials includes the geographic locality where it is found, sometimes quite restricted such as \"Bruneau\" (a canyon) and \"Lahontan\" (a lake), rivers and even individual mountains; many are fanciful, such as \"forest fire\" or \"rainbow\", while others are descriptive, such as \"autumn\" or \"porcelain\". A few are designated by the place of origin such as a brown Egyptian or red African.\n\n===Banded iron formations ===\nJasper is the main component in the silica-rich parts of [[Banded iron formation|banded iron formations]] (BIFs) which indicate low, but present, amounts of dissolved oxygen in the water such as during the [[Great Oxygenation Event|Great Oxidation Event]] or snowball earths.<ref>{{Cite book|title=How to Build a Habitable Planet|last=Broecker|first=W.S.|publisher=|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>  The red bands, typically more competent than the hematite layers surrounding it, are made of microcrystalline red chert, also called jasper.\n\n===Picture jaspers{{anchor|picture}}===\n[[File:Jasper earrings.jpg|thumb|Earrings of polished \"leopard-spot jasper\" (actually a type of spherulitic [[rhyolite]])]]\nPicture jaspers exhibit combinations of patterns {such as banding from flow or depositional patterns (from water or wind), dendritic or color variations} resulting in what appear to be scenes or images (on a cut section).  Diffusion from a center produces a distinctive [[Orbicular jasper|orbicular]] appearance, i.e., leopard skin jasper, or linear banding from a fracture as seen in leisegang jasper. Healed, fragmented rock produces [[breccia]]ted (broken) jasper.  \n\nWhile these \"picture jaspers\" can be found all over the world, specific colors or patterns are unique to the geographic region from which they originate. The primary source of the stone is [[Indonesia]], especially in [[Purbalingga]] district.[[Oregon]]'s [[Biggs jasper]], and [[Idaho]]'s [[Bruneau jasper]] from the [[Bruneau River]] canyon are particularly fine examples.

Firstly, it is the name of the [[Kodava language]] and culture followed by a number of communities from [[Kodagu]]. Secondly, within the Kodava - speaking communities and region ([[Kodagu district|Kodagu]]) it describes the dominant Kodava people. The Kodavas ([[Kodava language|Kodava]], anglicised as Coorgs), are considered a patrilineal ethno-lingual tribe from the region of [[Kodagu district|Kodagu]], (in [[Karnataka]] state of southern India), who natively speak the [[Kodava language]]. Traditionally they are land-owning agriculturists with martial customs. They practice family [[exogamy]] and caste [[endogamy]].

Forbes Watson (from NY public library)]]\nThe words ''Kodava'' (the indigenous people, language and culture) and ''Kodagu'' (the land) come from the same root word 'Koda' of unknown meaning. Some claim it means 'hills', others say it means 'west' but both relate to the Western Ghats' location. Kodagu is called ''Kodava Naad'' in the native [[Kodava language]]. The community members were called Kodava by the other natives and Coorgs by the British. They are ethnically and culturally distinct people. For centuries, the Kodavas have lived in Kodagu cultivating paddy fields, maintaining cattle herds and carrying arms during war.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/>\n\n===Indigenous origin===\nThere are a variety of theories as to the origin of the Kodava, including theories of them being either the indigenous inhabitants of their region, or of foreign origins before two thousand years ago. However the foreign theories are mere speculations because they have found no concrete evidences.\n*As per the indigenous theory, Kodavas are the native inhabitants of Kodagu who learnt and practiced agriculture. Hence they were an ancient warlike tribe which got civilised over the centuries and gained prosperity.\n*Kodavas (Coorgs) may be the descendants of the [[Cephalic index#Cephalic index in human anthropology|broad headed]] (''brachycephalic'') stock who entered into the Indus Valley during the Mohenjodaro period before the Indo-Aryans and later migrated to the Coorg region (Hutton, as quoted by Balakrishnan in 1976).\n\n===Other origin speculations===\n* One view is that the Kodavas are descendants of [[Scythians]] (Connor 1870, Rice 1878). According to yet another but similar view, the Kodavas belong to the [[Indo-Scythian]] race like the [[Sakas]], the [[Western Satraps|Western Kshatrapas]] and the Thiyyar.\n\n===Consensus===\n* Kannada inscriptions speak of this region as being called ''Kudagu nad'' (parts of Kodagu, Western Mysore and Kerala) as well. Both the name of the natives and of the region are synonymous (Kodava-Kodavu; Kodaga-Kodagu; Coorgs-Coorg).<ref name=\"Kamath 1993 160\">{{cite book|last=Kamath|first=Dr. S.

Kodagu (then called Coorg) is in dark green.]]\n\n===Puranic association===\nThe Hindu Puranas (Kaveri [[Purana]] of Skanda Purana) claim that Chandra Varma, a [[Chandravanshi]] [[Kshatriya]] (lunar dynasty warrior) and son of Emperor of Matsya Desha, was the ancestor of this 'fierce' race, the Kodavas. An ardent devotee of Goddess Mahalakshmi, he had gone on pilgrimage to several holy places all over India. Chandra Varma had a privy army who escorted him on his campaigns until he came into Kodagu(Coorg). Coorg, the source of the River Kaveri, was uninhabited jungle land when he arrived to settle here. Thereafter he became the first Raja of the Coorg principality. He had 11 sons, the eldest among them was Devakantha who later succeeded him as Raja. They were married to the daughters of the Raja of Vidarbha. These sons and their descendants cultivated and populated the land of Kodagu, they came to be called the Kodava race.<ref>Gazetteer of Coorg (Rev.G.Richter,1870){{Where|date=August 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Rajas===\n{{See also|Haleri Kingdom}}\n\nThe [[Kadamba Dynasty|Kadamba]] ruled North Karnataka along with Goa and parts of Maharashtra while the [[Gangas]] ruled South Karnataka and parts of Andhra and Tamil Nadu prior to 1000AD. The regions of Hassan, Kodagu (Coorg), Tulunad and Waynad were ruled between them. Later the cholas entered Karnataka to rule, but it was short lived. The [[Hoysala]]s succeeded them and ruled Southern Karnataka (including Tulunad and Coorg) and parts of Tamil Nadu. In the aftermath of the Delhi Sultanate invasion of South India (around 1319) the [[Vijaynagara]] Hindu Empire arose to rule South India until their downfall in the 16th century. From around 1600 until 1834 the [[Haleri Kingdom|Haleri Rajas]] ruled over Coorg.\n\nSamadhis were built for army chief Biddanda Bopu, who was the commander-in-chief for the army of Dodda Vira Rajendra, and his son Biddanda Somaiah. On the samadhi of Biddanda Bopu, there is a plate carved in Kannada praising him for his bravery shown in the wars fought against Tipu Sultan.<ref name=\"Coorg History\">{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Sir W.

A short but bloody campaign occurred in which a number of British men and officers were killed. Near Somwarpet where the Coorgs were led by Mathanda Appachu the resistance was most furious. But this [[Coorg War|Coorg campaign]] came to a quick end when the Raja sent his Diwan Apparanda Bopu to surrender to the British and lead them from Kushalnagar into Madikeri. Thereafter Kodagu was annexed by the British and the Raja was exiled.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Richter|first1=G|title=Manual of Coorg|date=1870|publisher=Stolz|page=337|url=https://archive.org/details/manualcoorgagaz00richgoog|quote=appachu.|accessdate=14 August 2014}}</ref> Apparanda Bopu and  Cheppudira Ponnappa were retained as the Dewans of Coorg.<ref name=\"Coorg History\"/>\n\n''Freedom Struggle''\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\nThe so-called Coorg rebellion of 1837 actually occurred in Sulya which was separated from Coorg Province in 1834 and attached to South Canara district of Madras Province. Led by Guddemane Appaiah Gowda and others it was not due to Gowdas alone nor opposed by all Kodavas, this was a 'divide-and-rule' propaganda of the British Raj. \"A large number of people from Coorg settled in Lower Coorg also participated in the revolt... There are no reliable sources which prove such a bitter hatred among the Coorgs and the Gowdas of Sullia.\" In fact, Kodavas from Nalkunadu led by Subedar Mandira Uthaiah (Nalknadu Uttu) actively participated in the revolt.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z0nZzbFDSAoC&pg=PA176&lpg=PA176&dq=1837+coorgs+revolt#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=South Kanara, 1799-1860|first=N.

The Kodava woman wears a [[sari]] with the pleats at the back and the loose end pinned at the right shoulder. The men have many distinctive practices such as carrying ceremonial knives, and martial war dances.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Kodavas (Coorgs), their customs and culture (B.D. Ganapathy)</ref>\n\n[[File:Idiyappam.jpg|thumb|right|Noolputtu]]\n\n===Cuisine===\nBoiled rice (koolu) and rice gruel (kanjee) formed the staple food of the Kodavas. The coconut, jackfruit, plantain, mango and other fruits and vegetables were widely used. Ghee was used in well-to-do families and on festive occasions. Rice in the form of Kanji or Koolu was served at meals along with curries and other additional dishes. Non-vegetarian food was not objectionable and alcoholic drinks as a rule weren't prohibited. Pork, chicken, river fish, were commonly consumed as also were varieties of game meat. Pork is a common dish at many households and the famous kodava 'Pandi Curry' is served along with 'Kadumbuttu' (steamed rice balls) which is almost deep Brown in color due to the use of garcinia cambogia vinegar called Kachumpuli. Sweet dishes like akki payasa were prepared during festive occasions. Other special dishes included otti (rice roti), paaputtu (similar to [[idli]]), [[Idiyappam|noolputtu]] (rice noodles), thambuttu (a sweet), etc.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Society==\n\n===Organizational structure===\nKodava settlements in Coorg are in the form of Okka family groups that are scattered across agricultural and forested holdings, where traditional [[Ainmanes|Ainmane]] houses form focal meeting points in the rural landscape.  The emergence of townships, as such, has been a relatively recent phenomenon and many of the main towns in Kodagu are inhabited by recent migrants and non-Kodavas. .<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Festivals==\n\nKodava festivities center around their agriculture and military tradition. Originally most of their lives were spent in the field: cultivating, harvesting and guarding their fields from the depredations of wild animals, or otherwise they were either waging war or hunting for game. Their new year was originally celebrated on Bishu Changrandi (called [[Vishu]] in Kerala and  [[Chithirai Thirunal]] in Tamil Nadu). The Kodavas began to celebrate a few Hindu festivals such as [[Ugadi]], [[Ayudha Puja]] (Dasara, also called Navratri, Vijaydashami, Durga Puja or Dussehra) and [[Mahashivaratri]] under the Haleri Rajas(1602\u20131834). However Kodavas traditionally celebrate the following three main festivals peculiar to Kodagu alone (two are cultural and one religious):\n\n===Kailpoldu (Festival of Arms)===\nKailpoldu is celebrated on 3 September. Officially, the festival begins on the 18th day after the sun enters the Simha Raasi (the Western sign of [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]]). Kail means weapon or armoury and Pold means festival. The day signifies the completion of \"nati\"&nbsp;\u2013 meaning the transplantation of the rice (paddy) crop. The festival signifies the day when men should prepare to guard their crop from wild boars and other animals, since during the preceding months, in which the family were engaged in the fields, all weapons were normally deposited in the \"Kanni Kombare\", or the prayer room. Hence on the day of Kailpoldu, the weapons are taken out of the Pooja room, cleaned and decorated with flowers. They are then kept in the \"Nellakki Nadubade\", the central hall of the house and the place of community worship. Each member of the family has a bath, after which they worship the weapons. Feasting and drinking follow. The eldest member of the family hands a gun to the senior member of the family, signifying the commencement of the festivities. The Menu for the day is Kadumbutte (Rice balls) and Pandhi Curry (Pork Curry) and Alcoholic beverages are also served. The whole family assembles in the \"Mand\" (open ground), where physical contests and sports, including marksmanship, are conducted. In the past the hunting and cooking of wild game was part of the celebration, but today shooting skills are tested by firing at a coconut tied onto the branch of a tall tree. Traditional rural sports, like grabbing a coconut from the hands of a group of 8\u201310 people (thenge porata), throwing a stone the size of a cricket ball at a coconut from a distance of 10\u201315 paces (thenge eed), lifting a stone ball of 30\u201340&nbsp;cm lying at one's feet and throwing it backwards over the shoulders, etc., are now conducted in community groups called Kodava Samajas in towns and cities.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/>\n\n===Kaveri Sankramana (worship of river Kaveri)===\n[[File:1632 px - Talakaveri India.JPG|thumb|right|[[Talakaveri]], origin of the river Kaveri]]\nThe Kaveri Sankramana festival normally takes place in mid-October. It is associated with the river [[Kaveri]], which flows through the district from its source at [[Talakaveri]].At a predetermined time, when the sun enters Tula Rasi (Tula sankramana), a fountain from a small tank fills the larger holy tank at Talakaveri. Thousands of people gather to dip in this holy water. The water is collected in bottles and reaches every home throughout Kodagu. This holy water is called Theertha, and is preserved in all Kodava homes. A spoonful of this water is fed to the dying, in the belief that they will attain ''[[moksha]]'' (spiritual emancipation) and gain entry to heaven. On this day, married women wearing new silk saris perform ''[[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]'' to a vegetable, symbolising the goddess Kaveri. The vegetable is usually a cucumber or a coconut, wrapped in a piece of red silk cloth and decorated with flowers and jewels (mainly 'Pathak' (Kodava Mangalasuthra)). This is called the Kanni Puje. The word Kanni denotes the goddess [[Parvati]], who incarnated as Kaveri. Three sets of [[betel]] leaves and [[areca]] nut are kept in front of the goddess with bunches of glass bangles. All the members of the family pray to the goddess by throwing rice and prostrating themselves before the image. The elder members of the family ceremonially bless the younger. An older married woman then draws water from the well and starts cooking. The menu of the day is dosa and vegetable curry (usually pumpkin curry (kumbala kari) ) and payasa. Nothing but vegetarian food is cooked on this day, and this is the only festival which is strictly vegetarian. Alcohol is prohibited. The Kaveri cult has its center and origin in Kodagu. It is only those Kodava rites associated with the river Kaveri that are Brahmanical in influence.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/>\n\n===Puttari (Harvest festival)===\nPuttari means \"new rice\" and is the rice harvest festival (also called Huttari in Kannada). This takes place in late November or early December. Celebrations and preparations for this festival start a week in advance. On the day of Puttari, the whole family assembles in their ain mane (the common family house), which is decorated with flowers and green mango and banana leaves. Specific foods are prepared: thambuttu, kadambutt  pandhi curi and also a special food of yam and jaggery water which is eaten before going to the field. Then the eldest member of the family hands a sickle to the head of the family and one of the women leads a procession to the paddy fields with a lit lamp in her hands. The path leading to the field is decorated. A gunshot is fired to mark the beginning of the harvest, with chanting of \"Poli Poli Deva\" (prosperity) by all present. Then the symbolic harvesting of the crop begins. The rice is cut and stacked and tied in odd numbers and is carried home to be offered to the gods. The younger generation then lite fire crackers and revel, symbolising prosperity. Groups of youngsters visit neighbouring houses and show off their dancing skills and are given monetary gifts. A week later, this money is pooled and the entire village celebrates a communal dinner. All family members gather for this meal. Dinner normally consists of meat dishes, such as pork, and mutton curry. Alcoholic beverages are also served at such feasts in Coorg.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/>\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Bhagmandala2.JPG|thumb|Bhagamandala temple]]\n[[File:Tank at Talakaveri.jpg|thumb|right]]\n\n===Shrines and deities===\nThe Kodavas have a local trinity comprising the ''Kuladevi'' (patron goddess) [[Kaveri]], ''Maguru'' (chief preceptor) [[Igguthappa]] and ''Guru Karana'' (revered common ancestor). The Kodavas of Kodagu are polytheist Hindus who believe in reincarnation, revere the cow and originally worshipped the natural elements and their ancestors. Their chief deities are Bhagwathi ([[Lakshmi]]), Mahadeva  ([[Shiva]]),  [[Bhadrakali]] (a form of Parvati as Kali), Muthappa and Aiyappa.\n\nIgguthappa, the most important local God, is an incarnation of Lord Subramani, the God of snakes, rain, harvest and rice (Incidentally, the famous Kukke Subramani temple located near Kodagu is dedicated to snakes, hence Subramani is the God of snakes despite the misconception that his carrier, the peacock, which eats grains and insects, is wrongly believed to kill and eat snakes). The reverence of various spirits in addition to the established gods of Hinduism is also part of their religion. This is similar to the bhuta aradhana of Tulunad. There are many spirits worshipped in Kodagu. The Kodavas also practised snake worship. Consumption of soma (liquor) and pork is permitted,\n\nThey maintained sacred groves on their public village lands from ancient times, hunting and cutting trees was prohibited in these woods called the Devakadu. However these days the government and private speculative land buyers have acquired these sacred groves and converted them into farms for monetary gains and with disrespect towards native religious feelings. The Kodavas believe in astrology as well. Generally they don't follow idol worship but believe in nature worship.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\" /> \n[[File:The temple tank of Omkareshwara Temple of Madikeri.jpg|left|thumb|The temple tank of Omkareshwara Temple of Madikeri, the town is in the background]]\n\nOn their ancestral clan lands they have a shrine (Kaimada), which is the shrine of the clan's first ancestor (Guru Karana - Karana). The spirits of departed souls who were prominent figures in the community and had done good deeds while they were alive were worshipped. These spirit gods do not have a set form of physical representation. Symbolically a piece of rock is sanctified and considered as such a spirit deity. A number of weapons, made of wood or metal, are kept in the Kaimadas.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/> Every year, members of each family get together to remember the 'Karana's of their family (similiar to [[Ofrenda|Ofrenda]]).\n\nEach village had a Bhagwathi, each lane had a snake deity and each nad(region) had an [[Ayyappa|Aiyappa]]. The Kodavas worshipped Mahadeva as well. Some of the main shrines of the Kodavas are the temples of Talakaveri, Bhagamandala, Padi Igguthappa, Peggala (Heggala), Kakot Parambu and Bythoor. The Kodavas also revere and visit the shrines of Kukke Subramanya and Dharmasthala Manjunatha in Tulunad.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/>\n\n===Socio-religious link with North Malabar===\n[[File:Bali theyyam, Payyannur.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Theiray (Theyyam)]]\nThe word Kodakar was the Malayalam word for a Kodava, and it comes from the word \"Kodag-kara\". The ancient Kodavas of Kodagu had land trade with Northern Malabar, especially with [[Thalassery]] (Tellicherry) port on the coast, and would also go on regular pilgrimage to the temples of the region. Devotees from Kodagu were, and still are, frequent visitors to the temples of Kannur and Waynad (districts of North Kerala). These temples are in places like Baithur or Bythoor (Vayathur and [[Ulikkal]]), [[Payyavoor]], Parassinikkadavu, Thirunelli, Kanjirath, Nileshwar and Payyanur. Also the Nambima (Namboothiri) priests of North Malabar traditionally served as the temple priests in the temples of Kodagu. The folk songs of the Kodavas speak of the temple deities having originated in North Malabar. These folk songs while talking of Kodagu and its people also mention the temple regions as well as the [[Thiyya]], Nambiya (Nambiar), the Nambima (Namboothiri) and the Nayamma (the Kodava word for Nair - in Malayalam Nayanmmar means Nairs) people of Northern Malabar.\n\nBaithurappa (Bythoorappa) is a chief deity of the Kodavas. The Puggera family of Kodavas were hereditary temple managers at the Bythoor (Vayathur, in Kerala and near Karnataka's Kodagu border) temple which was in the dominion of the Kalliat Nambiar, who like the Kolathiri (Chera Raja) was an ally of the Kodavas. Every year Kodavas from Southern Kodagu pilgrimage to this place. Likewise the Bovverianda and the Mundiolanda families of Kodavas were the hereditary temple managers at the Payyavur temple which was under the Kolathiri (Chera) kings. This is because a few of the Kodavas lived in North Malabar in the [[Taliparamba]] (ancient capital of the Cheras) region in the ancient past and fought on their side as mercenary soldiers.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/>\n[[File:Dungeon dwelling of Seringapatam.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[dungeon]] at [[Seringapatam]].]]\n\n===Firearms===\nThe Kodavas revered weapons, such as guns and the traditional sword and dagger, which are essential for their ceremonial purposes and in accordance to their religious and cultural customs.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/> The Kodavas stood guard at the Mysore, Mangalore and Malabar boundary posts. The support of the Kodagu native police, army and offices, held by Jamma ryots (native militia farmers, also called jamma tenure-holders), who were mostly Kodavas while including people from a few other communities as well, exempted the Kodavas from the 1861 Indian Arms Act.<ref name=\"Muthanna1971\">{{cite book|author=I.

Kodava takk similarity in accent and pronunciation with that of [[Beary bashe]], a dialect spoken by [[Beary]]s of [[Coastal Karnataka]].<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/>\n\nFamily histories, rituals and other records were scripted on palm leaves by astrologers. These ancient, scripted leaves called Pattole (patt=palm, ole=leaf) are still preserved at Kodava [[Ainmanes]]. Appaneravanda Hardas [[Appachcha Kavi]] and [[Nadikerianda Chinnappa]] are the two important poets and writers of Kodava language. The [[Pattole Palome|Pattole Palame]], a collection of Kodava folksongs and traditions compiled in the early 1900s by Nadikerianda Chinnappa, was first published in 1924. The most important Kodava literature, it is said to be one of the earliest, if not the earliest, collection of the folklore of a community in an Indian language. The fourth edition of the [[Pattole Palome|Pattole Palame]] was published in 2002 by the Karnataka Kodava Sahitya Academy. Nearly two thirds of the book consists of folksongs that were handed down orally through generations. Many of these songs are sung even today during marriage and death ceremonies, during our festivals relating to the seasons and during festivals in honour of local deities and heroes. Traditionally known as Balo Pat, these songs are sung by four men who beat dudis (drums) as they sing. The songs have haunting melodies and evoke memories of times long past. Kodava folk dances are performed to the beat of many of these songs. The [[Pattole Palome|Pattole Palame]] was written using the Kannada script originally; it has been translated into English by Boverianda Nanjamma and Chinnappa, grandchildren of Nadikerianda Chinnappa, and has been published by Rupa & Co., New Delhi.[[File:Coorgi-cox.jpg|right|thumb|Coorgi-cox alphabet]]\n\nKodava people are the native speakers of [[Kodava Takk|Kodava language]] are origins of district of Kodagu.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2003/01/17/stories/2003011701610300.htm|publisher=The Hindu|title=Kodava-speaking people seek one identity|access-date=12 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050111002911/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2003/01/17/stories/2003011701610300.htm|archive-date=11 January 2005|url-status=dead}}</ref> As per 1991 census, the speakers of Kodava Takk make up to 0.25% of the total population of the Karnataka state.

[[Kodava Cinema]] industry is very small and in the year 1972 first Kodava film was produced named 'Nada Mann Nada Kool' directed by S.R.Rajan (1972).\n\n==Land and agriculture==\n===Devarakadu===\n[[File:Coffee on hills of Cauvery River in Coorg.jpg|thumb|Coorg woods beside the Cauvery]]\nThe Kodavas revered nature and their ancestors they formerly hunted for sport, the Kodavas would even conduct ceremonies symbolically uniting in marriage the spirits of killed tigers with the spirit of the hunter, highlighting the intimate relationship between Kodava culture and the wildlife living in their forest realm. [[Sacred groves]], known as devarakadu (devara = God's and kadu = forest), continue to be maintained in their natural state amongst the coffee plantations since the time of the Rajas.<ref name=\"Coorg 1870\"/> Each village has at least one devarakadu, which is believed to be an abode of the gods, with strict laws and taboos against poaching and felling of trees. These groves are also an important storehouse of biodiversity in the district.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Jamma===\nA system of land tenure, known as Jamma (privileged tenureship), was formerly instituted in Kodagu during the pre-colonial Paleri Dynasty of the Lingayat Rajas. Jamma agricultural lands were held almost exclusively by Kodavas as a hereditary right, and were both indivisible and inalienable. Importantly, rights over the adjacent uncultivated woods (bane) were also attached to Jamma tenure, such that relatively expansive agricultural-forestry estates have remained intact across Kodagu. The exclusion of plantation crops, such as coffee, from India's Land Ceiling Act has further insulated these holdings from post independence land reform efforts across India. Importantly, rights over the adjacent forests (bane) were also attached to Jamma tenure, such that relatively expansive agricultural-forestry estates have remained intact across Kodagu. A unique feature of Jamma tenure is that tree rights remained with the Rajas, and were subsequently transferred to the colonial and post-independence governments and remains an import determinant of land use practices in the district.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"Coorg 1870\">Gazetteer of Coorg (Rev.G.Richter,1870)</ref>\n\n===Coffee cultivation===\nCoffee cultivatuion is widely believed to have been introduced in the western ghats from the Yemeni port of Mocha by the Muslim saint, Baba Budan, in the 16th century and some time after its introduction, coffee cultivation was embraced by the Kodavas in western Karnataka. Following the British annexation of Kodagu in 1834, large numbers of European planters began settling in the forested mountains to cultivate coffee, dramatically changing the economic and environmental management structures of Kodava society.<ref name=\"Coorg 1870\"/> Today, more than one third of India's coffee is grown in [[Kodagu district]], making it the most important coffee growing district in India, the world's fifth largest coffee-producing country.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Recent developments==\nThroughout the medieval period and until well into the 19th century, the Kodavas had a pre-eminent role in Kodagu. By the middle of the 19th century, however, this dominance started waning. British individuals bought large stretches of land in Coorg and founded plantations. Institutions like the joint family system began to disappear. A number of socio-religious reform movements in India took shape from the 1800s. The Kodavas also felt the need for reform in response to such changes. The sense of decline gave an impetus to the spirit of reform that expressed itself in the work of religious men like [[Sadguru Appayya Swami]]. Trouble arose for the community during the post-colonial years, after the Land Reform Act enacted in 1974. Many large land owners lost their lands to the tenants (land to the tiller) and the socio-economic structure of the prominent community of Kodavas changed irreversibly. These Land reforms led to massive loss of land-ownership by the Kodava gentry who were relegated to poverty overnight. The decline of Kodava dominance was however tempered by their conversion through the 20th century to the academic and professional classes and their dominance in Kodagu politics.[[File:KNPark.jpg|thumb|Kaveri River in Kushal Nagar]]\n\nEfforts by community leaders have brought together all Kodava groups the world over under an umbrella \" Federation of Kodava Samajas\". It is a federation of about 27 Kodava Samajas and is headquartered at Balagodu, Virajpet Taluk, [[Kodagu]] District.\n\nThe foundation of the Coorg Association (predecessor of the Bangalore Kodava Samaj) was laid in Bangalore, in 1912. The Kodava Samaja (R), Bangalore is an organisation created for the traditional and cultural conservation, social well-being and welfare of the Kodava community. It is headquartered at Vasanthnagar in the city of Bangalore in Karnataka State, India. Expatriate Kodavas both in other states of India as well as in countries other than India have formed Kodava Samajas (Kodava Associations) in their states and countries of domicile. Examples are the Bangalore Kodava Samaja (already mentioned) with 33 branches in Bangalore City, the Mysore Kodava Samaja, the Canadian Kodavas in North America and the Muscat Kodavas of Oman. These associations of non Kodagu origin retain the cultural uniqueness of the Kodavas at the same time adapting many practices to the times and country of their adoption.   Lately, some organisations including the ''Codava National Council (CNC)'' and ''Kodava Rashtriya Samiti'' are demanding Kodava homeland status and autonomy to Kodagu district.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2005/02/11/stories/2005021101650300.htm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130103054215/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2005/02/11/stories/2005021101650300.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-01-03|publisher=The Hindu|title=Codava National Council sets up global forum}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2005/02/04/stories/2005020402470300.htm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130103015923/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2005/02/04/stories/2005020402470300.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-01-03|publisher=The Hindu|title=Dharna staged for Kodagu State}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Correspondent|first1=DNA|title=Lok Sabha elections 2014: Separatist movements at the fore in Karnataka|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/bangalore/report-lok-sabha-elections-2014-separatist-movements-at-the-fore-in-karnataka-1971256|accessdate=17 September 2014|agency=DNA|publisher=DNA|date=22 March 2014}}</ref> The population of the Kodavas is around 1.5 lakh.<ref name=\"OBC list\">{{cite news|last1=CHINNAPPA|first1=JEEVAN|title=Will Kodavas be included in Central OBC list?|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/will-kodavas-be-included-in-central-obc-list/article603460.ece|accessdate=17 September 2014|publisher=The Hindu|date=30 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics and distribution==\n===Kodavas proper===\nThe Kodava community numbers about one-fifth out of a total population of over 500,000, in Kodagu. Many Kodava people have migrated to areas outside Kodagu, to other Indian cities and regions, predominantly to Bangalore, Mysore, Mangalore, Ooty, Chennai, Mumbai, Kerala, Hyderabad and Delhi for better job prospects. A few of them have now migrated outside India to foreign countries, like North America (the US and Canada), the Middle East (especially Dubai in UAE and Muscat in Oman), the UK and Australia (especially to Sydney where they are prominent members in the financial industry as well as contributing to the health industry).<ref name=\"ETHNOLINGUISTIC STUDY\">K.S.

LanguageIndia.com, October 2001</ref>\n\n===Amma Kodavas===\n[[File:Ammakodagi.jpeg|thumb|upright|Amma Kodava (Kaveri Brahmin) family, Coorg, 1875]]\n\nBesides the Kodavas there were other indigenous people who followed the same culture and spoke the same [[Kodava language]]. One of them, the Amma Kodavas, were believed to be the original priests\u2019 at all important temples in Coorg including temples of Talakaveri, Igguthappa and Irupu. The religious customs and practices of the [[hill people]] of Coorg gradually and subtly began to be influenced by the Brahmin practises and rituals. The role of the Coorg priest, via: Amma Kodavas declined and that of the Brahmin priest increased. In due course, the Amma Kodavas had no role to play in the religious aspects of the people of Coorg.\n\nThe loss of this important role earned some powerful Brahmin sympathisers, one of whom was a Havyaka Brahmin Thimmapaya, who had a large following of Amma Kodavas. During the later part of the 19th century, it appears that an attempt was made for assimilating the Amma Kodavas into the Brahmin fold. One batch of Amma Kodavas performed the rites to wear the sacred thread. Another batch is reported to have done so early in the 20th Century. Both these batches were assigned the Gothra names of their Brahmin patrons. The process of assimilation did not move any further. Today, many of the Amma Kodavas wear the sacred thread, a large number of them performing the rites a day before marriage (not after puberty, as done by the mainstream Brahmins). There are as many, who do not wear the sacred thread. Some of the Amma Kodavas do not have gotras assigned to them. They are vegetarians and endogamous. However, all other social activities such as marriage, dress and festivals are similar to the Kodavas.\n<ref name=\"B.L.Rice, Mysore 1878\">1.\tB.L.Rice,  Mysore & Coorg Gazetteer, Vol-III. published in 1878,\n2.\tRev.H.

They have said to be migrated during that period from South Canaran districts. Their prime occupation was to perform rituals and were priests in the temples of Kodagu. Kodagu Brahmins celebrate kodava festivals such as puthari, kaveri sankramana, kakkada padinett, but not kailpodh. They are pure vegetarians and wear the sacred thread. They however speak Kannada and kodava takk and follow kodava customs to an extent. They have clan system as well like the others some of them are, 'Cukkemane', 'Doddmane', 'Makkimane', 'Paremane', 'Kirumakki mane', 'Hulithala mane', 'Narasajjanamane', ' Kadangamakki mane', 'Nooroklunaadumane', 'Mottemane' , Mooterimane and many more. They worship spirits or'theray' and ancestors as well. They perform a ritual at every year end called \"Bhandaara pooje\" when all the clan members unite for the event.They have 'gothras' assigned just like the amma kodavas. Currently they have settled in bigger cities and even abroad for better occupations. They are also coffee planters and have made a mark in the military and defense services. Being a part of kodava society for many ages they are equipped with weapons i.e. 'thok' or 'kovi' and are used efficiently.They  have local cuisines as well like thambuli, majjigehuli, maange pajjii, kembu curry, kenjiruve kudi gojju etc. Jewelry includes 'jomaale', 'pavalamaale'or 'havaladasara', kadaga (coorg kada), 'pommaale' or 'muttina sara'and 'thaali'. Nowadays, 'kokkethaati' has become popular amongst few women.Women in this community have no custom of 'pathak' just like the amma kodavas.\n\n===Kodagu Heggade===\nThe Kodagu Heggades are another of these indigenous castes of Coorg although originally they were believed to have come from North Malabar.  They have around 100 family names.  They follow the Kodava habits and customs, dress like other Kodavas and speak [[Kodava Takk]].  The Kodagu Heggades and the Amma Kodavas are similar to the Kodavas and hence might have been related to them in the ancient past.<ref name=\"B.L.Rice, Mysore 1878\"/>\n\n===Kodava Maaples===\n[[Kodava Maaple]] is a Muslim  community residing in [[Kodagu]]  [[districts of Karnataka|district]] of [[Karnataka]] [[states and territories of India|State]] in southern [[India]]. In Coorg many Kodavas were converted into Islam during the rule of [[Tippu Sultan]] in Coorg. They are called the 'Kodava Maaple'  or  'Jamma Maaples' ( not to be confused with the [[Mapilla|Kerala Mappillas]]). However some of the Kodava Maaples have married with the [[Mappila|Kerala Mappilas]] and [[Beary|Mangalore Bearys]]. They contract marriage alliances with the Muslims of Coorg, Mangalore and Kerala. The Kodava Maaples belong to [[Sunni Islam]], refrain from alcohol and eat only Halal.  They maintained their original Kodava clan names and dress habits and spoke [[Coorg language]] although now they do follow some [[Kerala]] [[Muslim]] and [[Beary]] customs also.\n\n=== Others ===\nThese include communities such as,  Thiyya, Nair, Koleya, Airi, Malekudiya, Meda, Kembatti, Kapala, Kavadi, Kolla, Koyava, Banna, Golla, Kanya, Maleya and others. .Many of these communities had migrated into Kodagu from the Canara, Mysore and the Malabar regions during the period of Haleri Dynasty and to a certain extent culturally ingrained themselves in the Kodava Society.

Originally they are the migrants from Ikkeri (Keladi) Maha Samsthana (present Shimoga, Chikka Magaluru and Hassan Districts). They were originally Natha Pantha and Shivaites owing allegiance to Kigga and Sringeri Matha. Later Emperor Vishnuvardhana's rule they became Vaishnavites and worship 'Tirupati Timmappa' (Balaji of Thirupati) and 'Sabbakka' (Sharada of Sringeri). They are also called Tuluva Gowdas as they spoke Tulu when they came from Ikkeri, later in the Haleri kingdom, and settled the Mangalore-Udupi (Dakshina Kannada-Udupi) region. They now speak the Are Bhashe or Gowda Kannada dialect of Tulu and Kannada. They are said to have 10 Kutumba and 18 Balis as their primordial root families, from which arose around a Nooru Mane or hundred families. In Kodagu, there were quite a few families settled in Kodagu from the time of Lingayat King of Coorg, Rev. G. Richter, in Gazetteer of Coorg (1870) lists them as Tulu Gowdas (Vokkaligas in Kodagu and Dakshin Kannada) who migrated to Coorg (Kodagu) from the Mangalor\n\n===Caste reservations===\nAround 2000, some of the [[Kodava language]] speakers were included in the [[Other Backward Classes]] list of [[Karnataka]].

Their most significant contributions are in the armed forces and in sports. Originally being land-owning militiamen farmers from [[Kodagu]], hence their traditional twin occupations were as agriculturists and as soldiers. The distinguished among them had been local chieftains, palace officials, officers of the Raja's army and brave battle veterans, therefore invariably having attained fame in either government service or in the local army. The Kodava ancestors grew paddy and plantation crops like bananas and pepper, their descendants are now into coffee cultivation.\n\n===Army===\nMany Kodavas joined the [[Indian armed forces]] both as officers and as servicemen. They distinguished themselves in times of war and peace, army-men are still shown the most respect in Kodagu (Coorg). Quite a number of Kodavas have been martyred on enemy frontiers. Many Kodavas participated in the two World Wars before Indian Independence and in the wars against China and Pakistan after 1947. There was a separate [[71st Coorg Rifles|Coorg regiment]] (now forming a unit of the Indian [[Regiment of Artillery]], this unit being called the 37 (Coorg) Anti-Tank Regiment RIA) which largely included people from non-Kodava backgrounds while the Kodavas themselves served in different other regiments; this is in keeping with the army's non-bias policy according to which people were recruited in regiments other than those belonging to their region and community of birth. Hence Field Marshal [[Cariappa]] of the [[Rajput Regiment]] and General [[Thimayya]] of the [[Kumaon Regiment]] were the most distinguished army-men among the Kodavas. Many other Kodavas have been made Lt. Generals, Major Generals, Brigadiers and Air Marshals. Lt. General A. C. Iyappa (or [[Apparanda Aiyappa]]) is best remembered for his contributions towards the [[Indian Army Corps of Signals|Corps of Signals]] and towards [[Bharat Electronics Limited]]. There were several war heroes as well such as Nadikerianda Bheemaiah, a JCO who was awarded the [[Vir Chakra]] for conspicuous bravery in J&K Operations in 1947, Air Marshal [[C D Subbaiah|Cheppudira D Subbaia]] who was a fighter pilot during WW II and was awarded the Vir Chakra and the PVSM, Squadron Leader [[Ajjamada B Devaiah]], (known as the 'wings of fire') another fighter pilot was awarded the [[Maha Vir Chakra]] after he shot down an enemy aircraft and died in [[Pakistan]] during the 1965 Indo Pak War, Major Ganapathi Puttichanda Somiah, (known as the 'Major who kept his cool') awarded the Maha Vir Chakra, during the Indian Intervention in Sri Lanka, Major Ranjan Chengappa, [[Shaurya Chakra]] Awardee who was in Congo for UN mission as part of a peace keeping force, Col Chembanda M Thimanna, awarded the Shaurya Chakra for bravery in counter insurgency operations, Major Chottangada Ganesh Madappa, was awarded Shaurya Chakra posthumously in 1996, Squadron Leader [[M A Ganapathy|Mandepanda Appachu Ganapathy]], awarded the Vir Chakra in 1972 (when as a Flight Lieutenant he shot down Pakistani Sabre Jets). Major  (now Retd Maj Gen) K P Nanjappa was awarded the Vir Chakra in 1971.\n\n===Hockey===\nKodavas have a long history of association with the game of [[field hockey]]. The district of [[Kodagu]] is considered as the ''cradle of [[India]]n hockey''.<ref name=\"cradle\">{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mag/2004/06/13/stories/2004061300490800.htm|title=Time-out|work=Online Edition of The Hindu, dated 2004-06-13|publisher=2004, The Hindu|accessdate=21 June 2007|location=Chennai, India|date=13 June 2004}}</ref><ref name=\"dh\">{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/archives/apr42006/spectrum162126200643.asp|title=Coorg: A nursery of Indian hockey|work=Online Edition of The Deccan Herald, dated 2006-04-04|publisher=2005, The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.|accessdate=21 June 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929115244/http://www.deccanherald.com/archives/apr42006/spectrum162126200643.asp|archivedate=29 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> More than 50 Kodavas have represented India in international hockey tournaments, [[M.

Poonacha, Jagadish Ponnappa, M.A.Bopanna, Len Ayyappa, Amar Aiyamma to name a few, out of whom 7 have also participated in the [[Olympics]].<ref name=\"cradle\"/> The passion for hockey in [[Kodagu]] is so much that teams representing more than each of 200 families participate in an annual [[Kodava Hockey Festival]]. This festival is recognised as one of the largest field hockey tournaments in the world and has been referred to the [[Guinness Book of Records]].<ref name=\"cradle\"/> However it has already found a mention in the [[Limca Book of Records]], which is an Indian variant of the Guinness Book.<ref name=\"cradle\"/>\n\n===Other Sports===\nKodavas have also been known in other individual sport events as well especially in athletics; [[Ashwini Nachappa]], National Champion in Athletics, Olympian and [[Arjuna Award]]ee, [[Rohan Bopanna]], National Tennis Champion, [[Joshna Chinappa]], Ace squash player, [[Jagat and Anita Nanjappa]], motor racing champions, [[C.C. Machaiah]], (Chenanda Machiah) National boxing Champion, Olympian and Arjuna Awardee, [[Reeth Abraham]] (n\u00e9e Devaiah; of Kodava parentage), National Athletics Champion, Arjuna Awardee and Olympian, Arjun Devaiah, National Athlete and Arjuna Award winner, Pramila Aiyappa (n\u00e9e Ganapathy), National Champion in Athletics and Olympian, P G Chengappa, Former National Badminton Player, M R Poovamma (Maachettira Poovamma), National Champion in Athletics and Olympian and [[Ashwini Ponnappa]], national badminton player. Of late Kodavas have begun to distinguish themselves in cricket. Robin Uthappa, K. P. Appanna, N. C. Aiyappa and Shyam Ponnappa have represented [[Karnataka]] state in national tournaments, like the [[Ranji trophy]], and Bangalore city in the [[Indian Premier League]]. Among them, [[Robin Uthappa]] went on to play for Indian National Cricket Team, as well.\n\n===Other fields===\nThe Kodavas language was a spoken language and had no written literature until 1900. Appanervanda Haridasa [[Appachcha Kavi]], [[Nadikerianda Chinnappa]] and Dr. [[I M Muthanna]], have contributed immensely towards developing a literature for this language. The Kodavas are almost all Hindus a few of them had taken up monkhood and contributed towards the development of the religion, especially in Kodagu and Mysore regions, the most famous among them being [[Swami Shambhavananda]], [[Sadguru Appayya Swami]] and [[Swami Narayanananda]]. In the government service as well there were many prominent Kodavas. One remembers [[Rao Bahadur IGP P.K.Monnappa]], for his contributions towards the [[Indian Police Service|Indian Police]] in South India, be it in Hyderabad, Madras, Mysore or Coorg. [[Diwan Bahadur Ketoli Chengappa]], was the last Chief Commissioner (the governor of a British province which had no elected assembly) of Coorg. There were others like Rai Saheb Muthanna who served in Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and Mesopotamia (Iraq) during WWII and Rao Saheb Pattamada Devaiah, SP of Coorg. Some were judges in the High Court, such as Palecanda Medappa for Mysore and Ajjikuttira S Bopantna for Karnataka. [[C M Poonacha]] had been the Chief Minister of Coorg State (1952\u2013'56), MP, Union Minister and later Governor of Orissa and Madhya Pradesh. [[C B Muthamma]] was the first woman [[Indian Foreign Service]] officer. Mr CG Somaiah was the First IAS Officer to rise to the position of Home Secretary, Chief Vigilance Commissioner (CVC) and Comptroller and Auditor General (CAAG) <ref>{{cite book|last1=Ponnappa|first1=Lt.

Firstly, it is the name of the [[Kodava language]] and culture followed by a number of communities from [[Kodagu]]. Secondly, within the Kodava - speaking communities and region ([[Kodagu district|Kodagu]]) it describes the dominant Kodava people. The Kodavas ([[Kodava language|Kodava]], anglicised as Coorgs), are considered a patrilineal ethno-lingual tribe from the region of [[Kodagu district|Kodagu]], (in [[Karnataka]] state of southern India), who natively speak the [[Kodava language]]. Traditionally they are land-owning agriculturists with martial customs. They practice family [[exogamy]] and caste [[endogamy]].

Forbes Watson (from NY public library)]]\nThe words ''Kodava'' (the indigenous people, language and culture) and ''Kodagu'' (the land) come from the same root word 'Koda' of unknown meaning. Some claim it means 'hills', others say it means 'west' but both relate to the Western Ghats' location. Kodagu is called ''Kodava Naad'' in the native [[Kodava language]]. The community members were called Kodava by the other natives and Coorgs by the British. They are ethnically and culturally distinct people. For centuries, the Kodavas have lived in Kodagu cultivating paddy fields, maintaining cattle herds and carrying arms during war.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/>\n\n===Indigenous origin===\nThere are a variety of theories as to the origin of the Kodava, including theories of them being either the indigenous inhabitants of their region, or of foreign origins before two thousand years ago. However the foreign theories are mere speculations because they have found no concrete evidences.\n*As per the indigenous theory, Kodavas are the native inhabitants of Kodagu who learnt and practiced agriculture. Hence they were an ancient warlike tribe which got civilised over the centuries and gained prosperity.\n*Kodavas (Coorgs) may be the descendants of the [[Cephalic index#Cephalic index in human anthropology|broad headed]] (''brachycephalic'') stock who entered into the Indus Valley during the Mohenjodaro period before the Indo-Aryans and later migrated to the Coorg region (Hutton, as quoted by Balakrishnan in 1976).\n\n===Other origin speculations===\n* One view is that the Kodavas are descendants of [[Scythians]] (Connor 1870, Rice 1878). According to yet another but similar view, the Kodavas belong to the [[Indo-Scythian]] race like the [[Sakas]], the [[Western Satraps|Western Kshatrapas]] and the Thiyyar.\n\n===Consensus===\n* Kannada inscriptions speak of this region as being called ''Kudagu nad'' (parts of Kodagu, Western Mysore and Kerala) as well. Both the name of the natives and of the region are synonymous (Kodava-Kodavu; Kodaga-Kodagu; Coorgs-Coorg).<ref name=\"Kamath 1993 160\">{{cite book|last=Kamath|first=Dr. S.

An ardent devotee of Goddess Mahalakshmi, he had gone on pilgrimage to several holy places all over India. Chandra Varma had a privy army who escorted him on his campaigns until he came into Kodagu(Coorg). Coorg, the source of the River Kaveri, was uninhabited jungle land when he arrived to settle here. Thereafter he became the first Raja of the Coorg principality. He had 11 sons, the eldest among them was Devakantha who later succeeded him as Raja. They were married to the daughters of the Raja of Vidarbha. These sons and their descendants cultivated and populated the land of Kodagu, they came to be called the Kodava race.<ref>Gazetteer of Coorg (Rev.G.Richter,1870){{Where|date=August 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Rajas===\n{{See also|Haleri Kingdom}}\n\nThe [[Kadamba Dynasty|Kadamba]] ruled North Karnataka along with Goa and parts of Maharashtra while the [[Gangas]] ruled South Karnataka and parts of Andhra and Tamil Nadu prior to 1000AD. The regions of Hassan, Kodagu (Coorg), Tulunad and Waynad were ruled between them. Later the cholas entered Karnataka to rule, but it was short lived. The [[Hoysala]]s succeeded them and ruled Southern Karnataka (including Tulunad and Coorg) and parts of Tamil Nadu. In the aftermath of the Delhi Sultanate invasion of South India (around 1319) the [[Vijaynagara]] Hindu Empire arose to rule South India until their downfall in the 16th century. From around 1600 until 1834 the [[Haleri Kingdom|Haleri Rajas]] ruled over Coorg.\n\nSamadhis were built for army chief Biddanda Bopu, who was the commander-in-chief for the army of Dodda Vira Rajendra, and his son Biddanda Somaiah. On the samadhi of Biddanda Bopu, there is a plate carved in Kannada praising him for his bravery shown in the wars fought against Tipu Sultan.<ref name=\"Coorg History\">{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Sir W.

A short but bloody campaign occurred in which a number of British men and officers were killed. Near Somwarpet where the Coorgs were led by Mathanda Appachu the resistance was most furious. But this [[Coorg War|Coorg campaign]] came to a quick end when the Raja sent his Diwan Apparanda Bopu to surrender to the British and lead them from Kushalnagar into Madikeri. Thereafter Kodagu was annexed by the British and the Raja was exiled.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Richter|first1=G|title=Manual of Coorg|date=1870|publisher=Stolz|page=337|url=https://archive.org/details/manualcoorgagaz00richgoog|quote=appachu.|accessdate=14 August 2014}}</ref> Apparanda Bopu and  Cheppudira Ponnappa were retained as the Dewans of Coorg.<ref name=\"Coorg History\"/>\n\n''Freedom Struggle''\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\nThe so-called Coorg rebellion of 1837 actually occurred in Sulya which was separated from Coorg Province in 1834 and attached to South Canara district of Madras Province. Led by Guddemane Appaiah Gowda and others it was not due to Gowdas alone nor opposed by all Kodavas, this was a 'divide-and-rule' propaganda of the British Raj. \"A large number of people from Coorg settled in Lower Coorg also participated in the revolt... There are no reliable sources which prove such a bitter hatred among the Coorgs and the Gowdas of Sullia.\" In fact, Kodavas from Nalkunadu led by Subedar Mandira Uthaiah (Nalknadu Uttu) actively participated in the revolt.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z0nZzbFDSAoC&pg=PA176&lpg=PA176&dq=1837+coorgs+revolt#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=South Kanara, 1799-1860|first=N.

The coconut, jackfruit, plantain, mango and other fruits and vegetables were widely used. Ghee was used in well-to-do families and on festive occasions. Rice in the form of Kanji or Koolu was served at meals along with curries and other additional dishes. Non-vegetarian food was not objectionable and alcoholic drinks as a rule weren't prohibited. Pork, chicken, river fish, were commonly consumed as also were varieties of game meat. Pork is a common dish at many households and the famous kodava 'Pandi Curry' is served along with 'Kadumbuttu' (steamed rice balls) which is almost deep Brown in color due to the use of garcinia cambogia vinegar called Kachumpuli. Sweet dishes like akki payasa were prepared during festive occasions. Other special dishes included otti (rice roti), paaputtu (similar to [[idli]]), [[Idiyappam|noolputtu]] (rice noodles), thambuttu (a sweet), etc.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Society==\n\n===Organizational structure===\nKodava settlements in Coorg are in the form of Okka family groups that are scattered across agricultural and forested holdings, where traditional [[Ainmanes|Ainmane]] houses form focal meeting points in the rural landscape.  The emergence of townships, as such, has been a relatively recent phenomenon and many of the main towns in Kodagu are inhabited by recent migrants and non-Kodavas. .<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Festivals==\n\nKodava festivities center around their agriculture and military tradition. Originally most of their lives were spent in the field: cultivating, harvesting and guarding their fields from the depredations of wild animals, or otherwise they were either waging war or hunting for game. Their new year was originally celebrated on Bishu Changrandi (called [[Vishu]] in Kerala and  [[Chithirai Thirunal]] in Tamil Nadu). The Kodavas began to celebrate a few Hindu festivals such as [[Ugadi]], [[Ayudha Puja]] (Dasara, also called Navratri, Vijaydashami, Durga Puja or Dussehra) and [[Mahashivaratri]] under the Haleri Rajas(1602\u20131834). However Kodavas traditionally celebrate the following three main festivals peculiar to Kodagu alone (two are cultural and one religious):\n\n===Kailpoldu (Festival of Arms)===\nKailpoldu is celebrated on 3 September. Officially, the festival begins on the 18th day after the sun enters the Simha Raasi (the Western sign of [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]]). Kail means weapon or armoury and Pold means festival. The day signifies the completion of \"nati\"&nbsp;\u2013 meaning the transplantation of the rice (paddy) crop. The festival signifies the day when men should prepare to guard their crop from wild boars and other animals, since during the preceding months, in which the family were engaged in the fields, all weapons were normally deposited in the \"Kanni Kombare\", or the prayer room. Hence on the day of Kailpoldu, the weapons are taken out of the Pooja room, cleaned and decorated with flowers. They are then kept in the \"Nellakki Nadubade\", the central hall of the house and the place of community worship. Each member of the family has a bath, after which they worship the weapons. Feasting and drinking follow. The eldest member of the family hands a gun to the senior member of the family, signifying the commencement of the festivities. The Menu for the day is Kadumbutte (Rice balls) and Pandhi Curry (Pork Curry) and Alcoholic beverages are also served. The whole family assembles in the \"Mand\" (open ground), where physical contests and sports, including marksmanship, are conducted. In the past the hunting and cooking of wild game was part of the celebration, but today shooting skills are tested by firing at a coconut tied onto the branch of a tall tree. Traditional rural sports, like grabbing a coconut from the hands of a group of 8\u201310 people (thenge porata), throwing a stone the size of a cricket ball at a coconut from a distance of 10\u201315 paces (thenge eed), lifting a stone ball of 30\u201340&nbsp;cm lying at one's feet and throwing it backwards over the shoulders, etc., are now conducted in community groups called Kodava Samajas in towns and cities.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/>\n\n===Kaveri Sankramana (worship of river Kaveri)===\n[[File:1632 px - Talakaveri India.JPG|thumb|right|[[Talakaveri]], origin of the river Kaveri]]\nThe Kaveri Sankramana festival normally takes place in mid-October. It is associated with the river [[Kaveri]], which flows through the district from its source at [[Talakaveri]].At a predetermined time, when the sun enters Tula Rasi (Tula sankramana), a fountain from a small tank fills the larger holy tank at Talakaveri. Thousands of people gather to dip in this holy water. The water is collected in bottles and reaches every home throughout Kodagu. This holy water is called Theertha, and is preserved in all Kodava homes. A spoonful of this water is fed to the dying, in the belief that they will attain ''[[moksha]]'' (spiritual emancipation) and gain entry to heaven. On this day, married women wearing new silk saris perform ''[[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]'' to a vegetable, symbolising the goddess Kaveri. The vegetable is usually a cucumber or a coconut, wrapped in a piece of red silk cloth and decorated with flowers and jewels (mainly 'Pathak' (Kodava Mangalasuthra)). This is called the Kanni Puje. The word Kanni denotes the goddess [[Parvati]], who incarnated as Kaveri. Three sets of [[betel]] leaves and [[areca]] nut are kept in front of the goddess with bunches of glass bangles. All the members of the family pray to the goddess by throwing rice and prostrating themselves before the image. The elder members of the family ceremonially bless the younger. An older married woman then draws water from the well and starts cooking. The menu of the day is dosa and vegetable curry (usually pumpkin curry (kumbala kari) ) and payasa. Nothing but vegetarian food is cooked on this day, and this is the only festival which is strictly vegetarian. Alcohol is prohibited. The Kaveri cult has its center and origin in Kodagu. It is only those Kodava rites associated with the river Kaveri that are Brahmanical in influence.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/>\n\n===Puttari (Harvest festival)===\nPuttari means \"new rice\" and is the rice harvest festival (also called Huttari in Kannada). This takes place in late November or early December. Celebrations and preparations for this festival start a week in advance. On the day of Puttari, the whole family assembles in their ain mane (the common family house), which is decorated with flowers and green mango and banana leaves. Specific foods are prepared: thambuttu, kadambutt  pandhi curi and also a special food of yam and jaggery water which is eaten before going to the field. Then the eldest member of the family hands a sickle to the head of the family and one of the women leads a procession to the paddy fields with a lit lamp in her hands. The path leading to the field is decorated. A gunshot is fired to mark the beginning of the harvest, with chanting of \"Poli Poli Deva\" (prosperity) by all present. Then the symbolic harvesting of the crop begins. The rice is cut and stacked and tied in odd numbers and is carried home to be offered to the gods. The younger generation then lite fire crackers and revel, symbolising prosperity. Groups of youngsters visit neighbouring houses and show off their dancing skills and are given monetary gifts. A week later, this money is pooled and the entire village celebrates a communal dinner. All family members gather for this meal. Dinner normally consists of meat dishes, such as pork, and mutton curry. Alcoholic beverages are also served at such feasts in Coorg.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/>\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Bhagmandala2.JPG|thumb|Bhagamandala temple]]\n[[File:Tank at Talakaveri.jpg|thumb|right]]\n\n===Shrines and deities===\nThe Kodavas have a local trinity comprising the ''Kuladevi'' (patron goddess) [[Kaveri]], ''Maguru'' (chief preceptor) [[Igguthappa]] and ''Guru Karana'' (revered common ancestor). The Kodavas of Kodagu are polytheist Hindus who believe in reincarnation, revere the cow and originally worshipped the natural elements and their ancestors. Their chief deities are Bhagwathi ([[Lakshmi]]), Mahadeva  ([[Shiva]]),  [[Bhadrakali]] (a form of Parvati as Kali), Muthappa and Aiyappa.\n\nIgguthappa, the most important local God, is an incarnation of Lord Subramani, the God of snakes, rain, harvest and rice (Incidentally, the famous Kukke Subramani temple located near Kodagu is dedicated to snakes, hence Subramani is the God of snakes despite the misconception that his carrier, the peacock, which eats grains and insects, is wrongly believed to kill and eat snakes). The reverence of various spirits in addition to the established gods of Hinduism is also part of their religion. This is similar to the bhuta aradhana of Tulunad. There are many spirits worshipped in Kodagu. The Kodavas also practised snake worship. Consumption of soma (liquor) and pork is permitted,\n\nThey maintained sacred groves on their public village lands from ancient times, hunting and cutting trees was prohibited in these woods called the Devakadu. However these days the government and private speculative land buyers have acquired these sacred groves and converted them into farms for monetary gains and with disrespect towards native religious feelings. The Kodavas believe in astrology as well. Generally they don't follow idol worship but believe in nature worship.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\" /> \n[[File:The temple tank of Omkareshwara Temple of Madikeri.jpg|left|thumb|The temple tank of Omkareshwara Temple of Madikeri, the town is in the background]]\n\nOn their ancestral clan lands they have a shrine (Kaimada), which is the shrine of the clan's first ancestor (Guru Karana - Karana). The spirits of departed souls who were prominent figures in the community and had done good deeds while they were alive were worshipped. These spirit gods do not have a set form of physical representation. Symbolically a piece of rock is sanctified and considered as such a spirit deity. A number of weapons, made of wood or metal, are kept in the Kaimadas.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/> Every year, members of each family get together to remember the 'Karana's of their family.\n\nEach village had a Bhagwathi, each lane had a snake deity and each nad(region) had an [[Ayyappa|Aiyappa]]. The Kodavas worshipped Mahadeva as well. Some of the main shrines of the Kodavas are the temples of Talakaveri, Bhagamandala, Padi Igguthappa, Peggala (Heggala), Kakot Parambu and Bythoor. The Kodavas also revere and visit the shrines of Kukke Subramanya and Dharmasthala Manjunatha in Tulunad.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/>\n\n===Socio-religious link with North Malabar===\n[[File:Bali theyyam, Payyannur.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Theiray (Theyyam)]]\nThe word Kodakar was the Malayalam word for a Kodava, and it comes from the word \"Kodag-kara\". The ancient Kodavas of Kodagu had land trade with Northern Malabar, especially with [[Thalassery]] (Tellicherry) port on the coast, and would also go on regular pilgrimage to the temples of the region. Devotees from Kodagu were, and still are, frequent visitors to the temples of Kannur and Waynad (districts of North Kerala). These temples are in places like Baithur or Bythoor (Vayathur and [[Ulikkal]]), [[Payyavoor]], Parassinikkadavu, Thirunelli, Kanjirath, Nileshwar and Payyanur. Also the Nambima (Namboothiri) priests of North Malabar traditionally served as the temple priests in the temples of Kodagu. The folk songs of the Kodavas speak of the temple deities having originated in North Malabar. These folk songs while talking of Kodagu and its people also mention the temple regions as well as the [[Thiyya]], Nambiya (Nambiar), the Nambima (Namboothiri) and the Nayamma (the Kodava word for Nair - in Malayalam Nayanmmar means Nairs) people of Northern Malabar.\n\nBaithurappa (Bythoorappa) is a chief deity of the Kodavas. The Puggera family of Kodavas were hereditary temple managers at the Bythoor (Vayathur, in Kerala and near Karnataka's Kodagu border) temple which was in the dominion of the Kalliat Nambiar, who like the Kolathiri (Chera Raja) was an ally of the Kodavas. Every year Kodavas from Southern Kodagu pilgrimage to this place. Likewise the Bovverianda and the Mundiolanda families of Kodavas were the hereditary temple managers at the Payyavur temple which was under the Kolathiri (Chera) kings. This is because a few of the Kodavas lived in North Malabar in the [[Taliparamba]] (ancient capital of the Cheras) region in the ancient past and fought on their side as mercenary soldiers.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/>\n[[File:Dungeon dwelling of Seringapatam.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[dungeon]] at [[Seringapatam]].]]\n\n===Firearms===\nThe Kodavas revered weapons, such as guns and the traditional sword and dagger, which are essential for their ceremonial purposes and in accordance to their religious and cultural customs.<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/> The Kodavas stood guard at the Mysore, Mangalore and Malabar boundary posts. The support of the Kodagu native police, army and offices, held by Jamma ryots (native militia farmers, also called jamma tenure-holders), who were mostly Kodavas while including people from a few other communities as well, exempted the Kodavas from the 1861 Indian Arms Act.<ref name=\"Muthanna1971\">{{cite book|author=I.

Kodava takk similarity in accent and pronunciation with that of [[Beary bashe]], a dialect spoken by [[Beary]]s of [[Coastal Karnataka]].<ref name=\"Ganapathy1967\"/>\n\nFamily histories, rituals and other records were scripted on palm leaves by astrologers. These ancient, scripted leaves called Pattole (patt=palm, ole=leaf) are still preserved at Kodava [[Ainmanes]]. Appaneravanda Hardas [[Appachcha Kavi]] and [[Nadikerianda Chinnappa]] are the two important poets and writers of Kodava language. The [[Pattole Palome|Pattole Palame]], a collection of Kodava folksongs and traditions compiled in the early 1900s by Nadikerianda Chinnappa, was first published in 1924. The most important Kodava literature, it is said to be one of the earliest, if not the earliest, collection of the folklore of a community in an Indian language. The fourth edition of the [[Pattole Palome|Pattole Palame]] was published in 2002 by the Karnataka Kodava Sahitya Academy. Nearly two thirds of the book consists of folksongs that were handed down orally through generations. Many of these songs are sung even today during marriage and death ceremonies, during our festivals relating to the seasons and during festivals in honour of local deities and heroes. Traditionally known as Balo Pat, these songs are sung by four men who beat dudis (drums) as they sing. The songs have haunting melodies and evoke memories of times long past. Kodava folk dances are performed to the beat of many of these songs. The [[Pattole Palome|Pattole Palame]] was written using the Kannada script originally; it has been translated into English by Boverianda Nanjamma and Chinnappa, grandchildren of Nadikerianda Chinnappa, and has been published by Rupa & Co., New Delhi.[[File:Coorgi-cox.jpg|right|thumb|Coorgi-cox alphabet]]\n\nKodava people are the native speakers of [[Kodava Takk|Kodava language]] are origins of district of Kodagu.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2003/01/17/stories/2003011701610300.htm|publisher=The Hindu|title=Kodava-speaking people seek one identity|access-date=12 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050111002911/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2003/01/17/stories/2003011701610300.htm|archive-date=11 January 2005|url-status=dead}}</ref> As per 1991 census, the speakers of Kodava Takk make up to 0.25% of the total population of the Karnataka state.

[[Kodava Cinema]] industry is very small and in the year 1972 first Kodava film was produced named 'Nada Mann Nada Kool' directed by S.R.Rajan (1972).\n\n==Land and agriculture==\n===Devarakadu===\n[[File:Coffee on hills of Cauvery River in Coorg.jpg|thumb|Coorg woods beside the Cauvery]]\nThe Kodavas revered nature and their ancestors they formerly hunted for sport, the Kodavas would even conduct ceremonies symbolically uniting in marriage the spirits of killed tigers with the spirit of the hunter, highlighting the intimate relationship between Kodava culture and the wildlife living in their forest realm. [[Sacred groves]], known as devarakadu (devara = God's and kadu = forest), continue to be maintained in their natural state amongst the coffee plantations since the time of the Rajas.<ref name=\"Coorg 1870\"/> Each village has at least one devarakadu, which is believed to be an abode of the gods, with strict laws and taboos against poaching and felling of trees. These groves are also an important storehouse of biodiversity in the district.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Jamma===\nA system of land tenure, known as Jamma (privileged tenureship), was formerly instituted in Kodagu during the pre-colonial Paleri Dynasty of the Lingayat Rajas. Jamma agricultural lands were held almost exclusively by Kodavas as a hereditary right, and were both indivisible and inalienable. Importantly, rights over the adjacent uncultivated woods (bane) were also attached to Jamma tenure, such that relatively expansive agricultural-forestry estates have remained intact across Kodagu. The exclusion of plantation crops, such as coffee, from India's Land Ceiling Act has further insulated these holdings from post independence land reform efforts across India. Importantly, rights over the adjacent forests (bane) were also attached to Jamma tenure, such that relatively expansive agricultural-forestry estates have remained intact across Kodagu. A unique feature of Jamma tenure is that tree rights remained with the Rajas, and were subsequently transferred to the colonial and post-independence governments and remains an import determinant of land use practices in the district.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"Coorg 1870\">Gazetteer of Coorg (Rev.G.Richter,1870)</ref>\n\n===Coffee cultivation===\nCoffee cultivatuion is widely believed to have been introduced in the western ghats from the Yemeni port of Mocha by the Muslim saint, Baba Budan, in the 16th century and some time after its introduction, coffee cultivation was embraced by the Kodavas in western Karnataka. Following the British annexation of Kodagu in 1834, large numbers of European planters began settling in the forested mountains to cultivate coffee, dramatically changing the economic and environmental management structures of Kodava society.<ref name=\"Coorg 1870\"/> Today, more than one third of India's coffee is grown in [[Kodagu district]], making it the most important coffee growing district in India, the world's fifth largest coffee-producing country.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Recent developments==\nThroughout the medieval period and until well into the 19th century, the Kodavas had a pre-eminent role in Kodagu. By the middle of the 19th century, however, this dominance started waning. British individuals bought large stretches of land in Coorg and founded plantations. Institutions like the joint family system began to disappear. A number of socio-religious reform movements in India took shape from the 1800s. The Kodavas also felt the need for reform in response to such changes. The sense of decline gave an impetus to the spirit of reform that expressed itself in the work of religious men like [[Sadguru Appayya Swami]]. Trouble arose for the community during the post-colonial years, after the Land Reform Act enacted in 1974. Many large land owners lost their lands to the tenants (land to the tiller) and the socio-economic structure of the prominent community of Kodavas changed irreversibly. These Land reforms led to massive loss of land-ownership by the Kodava gentry who were relegated to poverty overnight. The decline of Kodava dominance was however tempered by their conversion through the 20th century to the academic and professional classes and their dominance in Kodagu politics.[[File:KNPark.jpg|thumb|Kaveri River in Kushal Nagar]]\n\nEfforts by community leaders have brought together all Kodava groups the world over under an umbrella \" Federation of Kodava Samajas\". It is a federation of about 27 Kodava Samajas and is headquartered at Balagodu, Virajpet Taluk, [[Kodagu]] District.\n\nThe foundation of the Coorg Association (predecessor of the Bangalore Kodava Samaj) was laid in Bangalore, in 1912. The Kodava Samaja (R), Bangalore is an organisation created for the traditional and cultural conservation, social well-being and welfare of the Kodava community. It is headquartered at Vasanthnagar in the city of Bangalore in Karnataka State, India. Expatriate Kodavas both in other states of India as well as in countries other than India have formed Kodava Samajas (Kodava Associations) in their states and countries of domicile. Examples are the Bangalore Kodava Samaja (already mentioned) with 33 branches in Bangalore City, the Mysore Kodava Samaja, the Canadian Kodavas in North America and the Muscat Kodavas of Oman. These associations of non Kodagu origin retain the cultural uniqueness of the Kodavas at the same time adapting many practices to the times and country of their adoption.   Lately, some organisations including the ''Codava National Council (CNC)'' and ''Kodava Rashtriya Samiti'' are demanding Kodava homeland status and autonomy to Kodagu district.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2005/02/11/stories/2005021101650300.htm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130103054215/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2005/02/11/stories/2005021101650300.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-01-03|publisher=The Hindu|title=Codava National Council sets up global forum}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2005/02/04/stories/2005020402470300.htm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130103015923/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2005/02/04/stories/2005020402470300.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-01-03|publisher=The Hindu|title=Dharna staged for Kodagu State}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Correspondent|first1=DNA|title=Lok Sabha elections 2014: Separatist movements at the fore in Karnataka|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/bangalore/report-lok-sabha-elections-2014-separatist-movements-at-the-fore-in-karnataka-1971256|accessdate=17 September 2014|agency=DNA|publisher=DNA|date=22 March 2014}}</ref> The population of the Kodavas is around 1.5 lakh.<ref name=\"OBC list\">{{cite news|last1=CHINNAPPA|first1=JEEVAN|title=Will Kodavas be included in Central OBC list?|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/will-kodavas-be-included-in-central-obc-list/article603460.ece|accessdate=17 September 2014|publisher=The Hindu|date=30 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics and distribution==\n===Kodavas proper===\nThe Kodava community numbers about one-fifth out of a total population of over 500,000, in Kodagu. Many Kodava people have migrated to areas outside Kodagu, to other Indian cities and regions, predominantly to Bangalore, Mysore, Mangalore, Ooty, Chennai, Mumbai, Kerala, Hyderabad and Delhi for better job prospects. A few of them have now migrated outside India to foreign countries, like North America (the US and Canada), the Middle East (especially Dubai in UAE and Muscat in Oman), the UK and Australia (especially to Sydney where they are prominent members in the financial industry as well as contributing to the health industry).<ref name=\"ETHNOLINGUISTIC STUDY\">K.S.

LanguageIndia.com, October 2001</ref>\n\n===Amma Kodavas===\n[[File:Ammakodagi.jpeg|thumb|upright|Amma Kodava (Kaveri Brahmin) family, Coorg, 1875]]\n\nBesides the Kodavas there were other indigenous people who followed the same culture and spoke the same [[Kodava language]]. One of them, the Amma Kodavas, were believed to be the original priests\u2019 at all important temples in Coorg including temples of Talakaveri, Igguthappa and Irupu. The religious customs and practices of the [[hill people]] of Coorg gradually and subtly began to be influenced by the Brahmin practises and rituals. The role of the Coorg priest, via: Amma Kodavas declined and that of the Brahmin priest increased. In due course, the Amma Kodavas had no role to play in the religious aspects of the people of Coorg.\n\nThe loss of this important role earned some powerful Brahmin sympathisers, one of whom was a Havyaka Brahmin Thimmapaya, who had a large following of Amma Kodavas. During the later part of the 19th century, it appears that an attempt was made for assimilating the Amma Kodavas into the Brahmin fold. One batch of Amma Kodavas performed the rites to wear the sacred thread. Another batch is reported to have done so early in the 20th Century. Both these batches were assigned the Gothra names of their Brahmin patrons. The process of assimilation did not move any further. Today, many of the Amma Kodavas wear the sacred thread, a large number of them performing the rites a day before marriage (not after puberty, as done by the mainstream Brahmins). There are as many, who do not wear the sacred thread. Some of the Amma Kodavas do not have gotras assigned to them. They are vegetarians and endogamous. However, all other social activities such as marriage, dress and festivals are similar to the Kodavas.\n<ref name=\"B.L.Rice, Mysore 1878\">1.\tB.L.Rice,  Mysore & Coorg Gazetteer, Vol-III. published in 1878,\n2.\tRev.H.

They have said to be migrated during that period from South Canaran districts. Their prime occupation was to perform rituals and were priests in the temples of Kodagu. Kodagu Brahmins celebrate kodava festivals such as puthari, kaveri sankramana, kakkada padinett, but not kailpodh. They are pure vegetarians and wear the sacred thread. They however speak Kannada and kodava takk and follow kodava customs to an extent. They have clan system as well like the others some of them are, 'Cukkemane', 'Doddmane', 'Makkimane', 'Paremane', 'Kirumakki mane', 'Hulithala mane', 'Narasajjanamane', ' Kadangamakki mane', 'Nooroklunaadumane', 'Mottemane' , Mooterimane and many more. They worship spirits or'theray' and ancestors as well. They perform a ritual at every year end called \"Bhandaara pooje\" when all the clan members unite for the event.They have 'gothras' assigned just like the amma kodavas. Currently they have settled in bigger cities and even abroad for better occupations. They are also coffee planters and have made a mark in the military and defense services. Being a part of kodava society for many ages they are equipped with weapons i.e. 'thok' or 'kovi' and are used efficiently.They  have local cuisines as well like thambuli, majjigehuli, maange pajjii, kembu curry, kenjiruve kudi gojju etc. Jewelry includes 'jomaale', 'pavalamaale'or 'havaladasara', kadaga (coorg kada), 'pommaale' or 'muttina sara'and 'thaali'. Nowadays, 'kokkethaati' has become popular amongst few women.Women in this community have no custom of 'pathak' just like the amma kodavas.\n\n===Kodagu Heggade===\nThe Kodagu Heggades are another of these indigenous castes of Coorg although originally they were believed to have come from North Malabar.  They have around 100 family names.  They follow the Kodava habits and customs, dress like other Kodavas and speak [[Kodava Takk]].  The Kodagu Heggades and the Amma Kodavas are similar to the Kodavas and hence might have been related to them in the ancient past.<ref name=\"B.L.Rice, Mysore 1878\"/>\n\n===Kodava Maaples===\n[[Kodava Maaple]] is a Muslim  community residing in [[Kodagu]]  [[districts of Karnataka|district]] of [[Karnataka]] [[states and territories of India|State]] in southern [[India]]. In Coorg many Kodavas were converted into Islam during the rule of [[Tippu Sultan]] in Coorg. They are called the 'Kodava Maaple'  or  'Jamma Maaples' ( not to be confused with the [[Mapilla|Kerala Mappillas]]). However some of the Kodava Maaples have married with the [[Mappila|Kerala Mappilas]] and [[Beary|Mangalore Bearys]]. They contract marriage alliances with the Muslims of Coorg, Mangalore and Kerala. The Kodava Maaples belong to [[Sunni Islam]], refrain from alcohol and eat only Halal.  They maintained their original Kodava clan names and dress habits and spoke [[Coorg language]] although now they do follow some [[Kerala]] [[Muslim]] and [[Beary]] customs also.\n\n=== Others ===\nThese include communities such as,  Thiyya, Nair, Koleya, Airi, Malekudiya, Meda, Kembatti, Kapala, Kavadi, Kolla, Koyava, Banna, Golla, Kanya, Maleya and others. .Many of these communities had migrated into Kodagu from the Canara, Mysore and the Malabar regions during the period of Haleri Dynasty and to a certain extent culturally ingrained themselves in the Kodava Society.

Originally they are the migrants from Ikkeri (Keladi) Maha Samsthana (present Shimoga, Chikka Magaluru and Hassan Districts). They were originally Natha Pantha and Shivaites owing allegiance to Kigga and Sringeri Matha. Later Emperor Vishnuvardhana's rule they became Vaishnavites and worship 'Tirupati Timmappa' (Balaji of Thirupati) and 'Sabbakka' (Sharada of Sringeri). They are also called Tuluva Gowdas as they spoke Tulu when they came from Ikkeri, later in the Haleri kingdom, and settled the Mangalore-Udupi (Dakshina Kannada-Udupi) region. They now speak the Are Bhashe or Gowda Kannada dialect of Tulu and Kannada. They are said to have 10 Kutumba and 18 Balis as their primordial root families, from which arose around a Nooru Mane or hundred families. In Kodagu, there were quite a few families settled in Kodagu from the time of Lingayat King of Coorg, Rev. G. Richter, in Gazetteer of Coorg (1870) lists them as Tulu Gowdas (Vokkaligas in Kodagu and Dakshin Kannada) who migrated to Coorg (Kodagu) from the Mangalor\n\n===Caste reservations===\nAround 2000, some of the [[Kodava language]] speakers were included in the [[Other Backward Classes]] list of [[Karnataka]].

Their most significant contributions are in the armed forces and in sports. Originally being land-owning militiamen farmers from [[Kodagu]], hence their traditional twin occupations were as agriculturists and as soldiers. The distinguished among them had been local chieftains, palace officials, officers of the Raja's army and brave battle veterans, therefore invariably having attained fame in either government service or in the local army. The Kodava ancestors grew paddy and plantation crops like bananas and pepper, their descendants are now into coffee cultivation.\n\n===Army===\nMany Kodavas joined the [[Indian armed forces]] both as officers and as servicemen. They distinguished themselves in times of war and peace, army-men are still shown the most respect in Kodagu (Coorg). Quite a number of Kodavas have been martyred on enemy frontiers. Many Kodavas participated in the two World Wars before Indian Independence and in the wars against China and Pakistan after 1947. There was a separate [[71st Coorg Rifles|Coorg regiment]] (now forming a unit of the Indian [[Regiment of Artillery]], this unit being called the 37 (Coorg) Anti-Tank Regiment RIA) which largely included people from non-Kodava backgrounds while the Kodavas themselves served in different other regiments; this is in keeping with the army's non-bias policy according to which people were recruited in regiments other than those belonging to their region and community of birth. Hence Field Marshal [[Cariappa]] of the [[Rajput Regiment]] and General [[Thimayya]] of the [[Kumaon Regiment]] were the most distinguished army-men among the Kodavas. Many other Kodavas have been made Lt. Generals, Major Generals, Brigadiers and Air Marshals. Lt. General A. C.

The district of [[Kodagu]] is considered as the ''cradle of [[India]]n hockey''.<ref name=\"cradle\">{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mag/2004/06/13/stories/2004061300490800.htm|title=Time-out|work=Online Edition of The Hindu, dated 2004-06-13|publisher=2004, The Hindu|accessdate=21 June 2007|location=Chennai, India|date=13 June 2004}}</ref><ref name=\"dh\">{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/archives/apr42006/spectrum162126200643.asp|title=Coorg: A nursery of Indian hockey|work=Online Edition of The Deccan Herald, dated 2006-04-04|publisher=2005, The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd.|accessdate=21 June 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929115244/http://www.deccanherald.com/archives/apr42006/spectrum162126200643.asp|archivedate=29 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> More than 50 Kodavas have represented India in international hockey tournaments, [[M.

Poonacha, Jagadish Ponnappa, M.A.Bopanna, Len Ayyappa, Amar Aiyamma to name a few, out of whom 7 have also participated in the [[Olympics]].<ref name=\"cradle\"/> The passion for hockey in [[Kodagu]] is so much that teams representing more than each of 200 families participate in an annual [[Kodava Hockey Festival]]. This festival is recognised as one of the largest field hockey tournaments in the world and has been referred to the [[Guinness Book of Records]].<ref name=\"cradle\"/> However it has already found a mention in the [[Limca Book of Records]], which is an Indian variant of the Guinness Book.<ref name=\"cradle\"/>\n\n===Other Sports===\nKodavas have also been known in other individual sport events as well especially in athletics; [[Ashwini Nachappa]], National Champion in Athletics, Olympian and [[Arjuna Award]]ee, [[Rohan Bopanna]], National Tennis Champion, [[Joshna Chinappa]], Ace squash player, [[Jagat and Anita Nanjappa]], motor racing champions, [[C.C.

Among them, [[Robin Uthappa]] went on to play for Indian National Cricket Team, as well.\n\n===Other fields===\nThe Kodavas language was a spoken language and had no written literature until 1900. Appanervanda Haridasa [[Appachcha Kavi]], [[Nadikerianda Chinnappa]] and Dr. [[I M Muthanna]], have contributed immensely towards developing a literature for this language. The Kodavas are almost all Hindus a few of them had taken up monkhood and contributed towards the development of the religion, especially in Kodagu and Mysore regions, the most famous among them being [[Swami Shambhavananda]], [[Sadguru Appayya Swami]] and [[Swami Narayanananda]]. In the government service as well there were many prominent Kodavas. One remembers [[Rao Bahadur IGP P.K.Monnappa]], for his contributions towards the [[Indian Police Service|Indian Police]] in South India, be it in Hyderabad, Madras, Mysore or Coorg. [[Diwan Bahadur Ketoli Chengappa]], was the last Chief Commissioner (the governor of a British province which had no elected assembly) of Coorg. There were others like Rai Saheb Muthanna who served in Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and Mesopotamia (Iraq) during WWII and Rao Saheb Pattamada Devaiah, SP of Coorg. Some were judges in the High Court, such as Palecanda Medappa for Mysore and Ajjikuttira S Bopantna for Karnataka. [[C M Poonacha]] had been the Chief Minister of Coorg State (1952\u2013'56), MP, Union Minister and later Governor of Orissa and Madhya Pradesh. [[C B Muthamma]] was the first woman [[Indian Foreign Service]] officer.

The Series 62 featured a low sleek \"torpedo\" style [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]] with chrome window reveals, more slant in the windshield, and a curved rear window. The new C-body that the 1940 Cadillac Series 62 shared with the [[Buick Roadmaster]] and [[Buick Super|Super]], the [[Oldsmobile 98|Oldsmobile Series 90]] and the [[Pontiac Torpedo]] featured shoulder and hip room that was over 5\" wider, the elimination of running boards and exterior styling that was streamlined and 2-3\" lower. When combined with a column mounted shift lever the cars offered true six passenger comfort. These changes had clearly been influenced by the [[Cadillac Sixty Special]]. The styling feature distinguishing all V-8 Cadillacs was once again the grille. Although grilles had the same pointed shape as in 1939, the grille bars were heavier and fewer in number. Two sets of louver bars appeared on each side of the hood. Running boards were a no cost option. The Series 62 was available as a club coupe or a sedan, with 2-door and 4-door convertibles introduced mid-year. Sales totaled 5903 in its inaugural year accounting for about 45% of Cadillac's sales.\n\nIn 1941, the one piece hood came down lower in the front, included the side panels and extended sideways to the fenders. A single rectangular panel of louver trim was used on each side of the hood. The rectangular grille was wide, vertical, and bulged forward in the middle. Rectangular parking lights were built into the top outer corners of the grille. Headlights were now built into the nose of the fenders, and provision for built in accessory fog lights was provided under the headlights. Three chrome spears appeared on the rear section of all four fenders. Rear fender skirts were standard. The Series 62 offered the only 4-door convertible built by Cadillac in 1941 and it would be the last time this bodystyle was ever made by the marque. All Cadillacs shared the same {{convert|346|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} 135&nbsp;hp (101&nbsp;kW) [[Cadillac V8 engine|L-head]] [[V8 engine|V8]] that year, with power rising to 150&nbsp;hp (112&nbsp;kW).\n\nSales more than quadrupled to 24,734, accounting for 37% of Cadillac sales in a sales year that well more than doubled the previous Cadillac sales rate record set during the two model years of 1926\u201327, in part due to the huge popularity of the new Series 61. Evidently the new \"torpedo\" style with its low streamlined runningboardless bodies and expansive shoulder room had proved a big hit. The following model year, abbreviated as it was by a world war, would set no such sales record.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Second generation (1942\u20131947) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name = Second generation\n|image = Cadillac Convertible 1942.jpg\n|model_years = 1942\u20131947\n|platform = [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]]\n|body_style = 2-door [[coup\u00e9|coupe]]<br>4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br>2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]] \n| engine        = {{convert|346|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine#Monobloc|Monobloc]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission =3-speed selective [[synchromesh]] [[manual transmission|manual]]<br>4-speed [[Hydra-Matic]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n|wheelbase = {{convert|129.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length =1942: {{convert|220.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/><br>1946\u201347: {{convert|219.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/>\n| width = {{convert|80.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/>\n| height = {{convert|63.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|4300|-|4700|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n| designer = [[Harley Earl]]\n| related = [[Cadillac Sixty Special]]<br>[[Buick Roadmaster]]<br>[[Buick Super]]<br>[[Oldsmobile 98]]\n}}\n\n[[File:Cadillac Series 62 1946.jpg|thumb|left|1946 Cadillac Series 62 coupe]]\n[[File:1947 Cadillac Series 62 Convertible.jpg|thumb|left|1947 Cadillac Series 62 convertible]]\n[[File:Cadillac Series 62 ca 1946.jpg|thumb|left|1946 Cadillac Series 62 4-door sedan]]\n\nThe grille became more massive in 1942, with even fewer bars. Parking lights became round and fog light sockets became rectangular and were included in the grille area. A bullet shape appeared on the tops of the bumper guards. Fenders were rounded and longer. Front fenders extended into the front doors. Rear fenders extended forward into the rear doors. The new fenders had heavy moldings along the sides. A new fresh air ventilating system with air ducts leading from the grille replaced cowl ventilators. Handbrake control was changed from lever to tee-shaped pull handle. Radiator shutter control of engine temperature was replaced by a blocking type thermostat in the water return fitting in the radiator.\n\nThe first postwar Cadillac rolled off the line on October 7, 1945 and for several months, only Series 62s were produced. 1946 Cadillacs were not significantly altered from 1942 outside a few styling changes and the addition of a negative ground battery. The Series 62 retained the same lineup of body styles as in 1942\u2014coupe, sedan, and convertible, and 18,565 total were produced for the model year, approximately 65% of Cadillac's total 1946 output of 29,000 vehicles. Resuming civilian production was a difficult task for the entire automobile industry and demand for new cars much exceeded supply. Cadillac had as many as 100,000 unfilled orders into 1947. Due to materials shortages, some Cadillacs shipped from the factory with wooden bumpers, dealers being expected to install proper ones as they became available. Postwar inflation pushed the sticker price of a 1946 Cadillac over $1000 higher than 1942.\n\nIn 1946, the Series 62 used GM's [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]] platform, as did the [[Cadillac Sixty Special]], [[Buick Super]] and [[Buick Roadmaster]], and [[Oldsmobile 98]]. Notchback styling characterized the cars except for the Club Coupe which had fastback styling. It was easy to distinguish the Series 62 coupe from the Series 61 because the door skins did not flare out above the rocker panel moldings, and the side window openings were lower and the reveal window moldings circled each window individually instead of looping around all the windows. The Series 62 sedan featured venti planes on both the front and rear windows. It was also the first Cadillac to enter production after World War II. Interior styling and technical features were similar to those seen on the [[Cadillac Series 61]] but with slightly richer interior appointments. Late 1946 models introduced technical changes to the V8 engine in the form of hardened ball seats for the hydraulic lifters.\n\nThe 1947 models received minor styling changes and the addition of Hydro-Lectric window lifts on the Series 62 convertible, which remained the sole ragtop in Cadillac's lineup. Polished metal stone guards on the fenders replaced the rubber ones used on 1946 models. As before, Series 62s remained Cadillac's bread-and-butter lineup with 39,834 produced, 84% of the make's total 1947 volume.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Third generation (1948\u20131953) ==\n[[File:Cadillac 6207 1949.jpg|thumb|left|1949 Cadillac Series 62 2-door coupe]]\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name = Third generation\n|image = Cadillac Convertible 1949 2.jpg\n|caption = 1949 Cadillac Series Sixty-Two Convertible\n|model_years = 1948\u20131953\n|platform = [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]]\n|related = [[Cadillac Series 61]]<br>[[Cadillac Sixty Special]]<br>[[Buick Roadmaster]]<br>[[Buick Super]]<br>[[Oldsmobile 98]] \n|body_style = 2-door [[coup\u00e9|coupe]]<br>2-door [[hardtop]]<br>4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] <br>2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]<br>2-door [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado]] [[convertible (car)|convertible]]\n|engine = {{convert|346|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine#Monobloc|Monobloc]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>{{convert|331|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine|OHV]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 3-speed selective [[synchromesh]] [[manual transmission|manual]]<br>4-speed [[Hydra-Matic]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n|wheelbase = {{convert|126.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length = 1948\u20131950: {{convert|214.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1951: {{convert|215.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1952\u201353 4-door: {{convert|215.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1952\u201353 2-door: {{convert|220.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|width = 1948: {{Convert|79.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1949: {{Convert|78.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} <br>1950\u20131953: {{convert|80.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/>\n|height = {{Convert|62.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|weight = {{convert|4400|-|5000|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n| designer = [[Harley Earl]]\n}}\n\n[[File:Cadillac Coupe De Ville 1950.jpg|thumb|left|1950 Cadillac Series 62 [[Cadillac Coupe de Ville|Coupe de Ville]]]]\n[[File:1952 Cadillac 62 conv.jpg|thumb|left|1952 Cadillac Series 62 convertible]]\n[[File:1953 Cadillac.jpg|thumb|left|1953 Cadillac Series 62 Coupe]]\n[[File:1953 custom Cadillac El Dorado 01.jpg|thumb|left|1953 Cadillac Series 62 [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado]]]]\n\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:1952 Cadillac Series 62.jpg|200px|thumb|left|1952 Cadillac Series 62 convertible|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Tuesday, 14 April 2009|date=May 2012}}]] -->The first all-new postwar Cadillacs arrived in 1948, sporting an aircraft-inspired look and the first tail fins on a Cadillac. Series 62 Cadillacs had a slightly shortened wheelbase, but the track width was widened by two inches, increasing interior room. However, updated drivetrains would have to wait another year and for the time being, the new Cadillacs were still powered by the same 346 CID flathead V8 used across the board since 1941, which delivered only fair performance (0-60 in 16 seconds with a top speed of 93&nbsp;mph). Fuel mileage was an estimated 14 mpg highway, 10 mpg city with the Hydramatic transmission, which was rapidly becoming the norm on Cadillacs\u2014by 1949, only 10% of Cadillacs were ordered with the 3-speed manual gearbox. Series 62 production totaled 34,213 vehicles for the 1948 model year, accounting for 68% of Cadillac's volume. The 1948 models had been slow to get into production and did not arrive in showrooms until February 1948, consequently Cadillac produced on 50,599 total vehicles for the abbreviated model year.\n\nThe new Cadillac OHV V8 was the big news for 1949, with minor trim differences otherwise. This 331 cu in (5.4 L) engine produced 160&nbsp;hp (119&nbsp;kW) and weighed 200 pounds less than the old flathead V8 in addition to being shorter and lower. The 331 V8 could also handle higher compression levels to take advantage of improved, higher octane postwar gasoline formulations. The major difference between Series 61 and Series 62 models of similar body style was minor trim variations. The higher-priced series again had grooved, front fender stone shields and bright rocker panel moldings. Chevrons below the taillights were no longer seen. The convertible was an exclusive offering. A heater was optional.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1949_Cadillac/1949_Cadillac_Brochure/1949%20Cadillac-18.html |title=Directory Index: Cadillac/1949_Cadillac/1949_Cadillac_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref> Sales reached a record 55,643.\n\nThe Cadillac Series 62 '''[[Cadillac Coupe de Ville|Coupe de Ville]]''' was introduced late in the 1949 model year.<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/><ref name=\"Kowalke 1997\">{{cite book|last=Kowalke|first=Ron|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946-1975|year=1997|publisher=Krause publications|isbn=0-87341-521-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/standardcatalogo00beve}}</ref> Along with the [[Buick Roadmaster]] [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]], and the [[Oldsmobile 98]] Holiday, it was among the first pillarless [[hardtop]] coupes ever produced.<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/><ref name=\"Kowalke 1997\"/> At $3,496 it was only a dollar less than the Series 62 convertible, and like the convertible, it came with power windows standard.

The cars were lower and sleeker, with longer hoods, and one-piece windshields were fitted. Hydra Matic transmission was now standard. The Series 61 was again a short wheelbase model, having been reduced to 122 in (3099&nbsp;mm). Sales set yet another record at 59,818.\n\nFull-length chrome rocker panels set off the 1951 model, and the Coupe de Ville was now marked with noticeably-improved trim, including Coupe de Ville script on the rear roof pillar. Sales were 81,844, or a record of over 74% of all Cadillacs sold. ''Popular Mechanics'' reported about 12-MPG at 45&nbsp;mph.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=Popular Mechanics|date=February 1932|publisher=Hearst Magazines|issn=0032-4558|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_4-EDAAAAMBAJ|accessdate=2017-01-08}}</ref>\n\nIn 1952, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Cadillac, the V-shaped hood and deck emblems were done as gold castings. The Series 62 sedan was also characterized by a higher rear deck lid contour. This provided additional luggage space. Back up lights were now standard equipment and were incorporated in the taillights. The grille wraparound panels were redesigned once again having broad chrome trim below each headlight with side scoop styling and gold-colored winged emblem mounted in the center. At the rear all Cadillacs adopted a through the bumper dual exhaust system. Deck ornamentation took the form of a Cadillac crest over abroad golden \"V\". New standard features included self-winding clocks, improved direction signal indicators, glare proof mirrors, stannate treated pistons, and four barrel carburetion. Engine output for the 331 was up to 190&nbsp;hp (142&nbsp;kW). Sales fell to 70,255, but with the Series 61 out of the way, Series 62 sales accounted for a record 78% of all Cadillacs.\n\nThe 1953 Series 62 saw a redesigned grille with heavier integral bumper and bumper guards, the repositioning of parking lamps directly under the headlights, chrome \"eybrow\" type headlamp doors, and one piece rear windows without division bars. Wheel discs were fashioned in an attractive new disced design. Series 62 bodystyles were identified by non louvered rear fenders, the use of thin bright metal underscores on the bottom rear of the cars only and the decoration of both hood and deck lid with Cadillac crests and V- shaped ornaments. The Club Coupe model disappeared. Two door Series 62 were now all hardtops (including the better equipped Coupe de Ville) or convertibles. Another familiar name appeared on 1953's Series 62. The top of the line subseries '''[[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado]]''' was one of three specialty convertibles produced in 1953 by General Motors, the other two being the [[Oldsmobile 98]] Fiesta and the [[Buick Roadmaster]] [[Buick Skylark|Skylark]]. The Eldorado was a limited-edition luxury convertible, and would eventually become its own series. It featured a full assortment of deluxe accessories, including wire wheels, and introduced the wraparound windshield to Cadillac standard production. Sales set a new record at 85,446.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Fourth generation (1954\u20131956) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name = Fourth generation\n|image = '55 Cadillac Convertible (Auto classique Pointe-Claire '11).JPG\n|caption = 1955 Cadillac Series 62 Convertible\n|model_years = 1954\u20131956\n|platform = [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]]\n| related = [[Cadillac Sixty Special]]<br>[[Buick Roadmaster]]<br>[[Buick Super]]<br>[[Oldsmobile 98]]\n|body_style = 2-door [[hardtop]]<br>2-door [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado Seville]] [[hardtop]]<br>4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br>[[Cadillac Sedan de Ville|4-door Sedan de Ville]] [[hardtop]]<br>2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]<br>2-door [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado]] [[convertible (car)|convertible]]\n| engine = {{convert|331|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine#331|OHV]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>{{convert|365|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine#365|OHV]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 4-speed [[Hydra-Matic]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n|wheelbase = {{convert|129.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length = 1954 4-door: {{convert|216.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1954 2-door: {{convert|223.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1955 4-door: {{convert|216.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1955 2-door: {{convert|223.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1956 4-door: {{convert|214.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1956 2-door: {{convert|221.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|width =1954: {{convert|79.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/><br>1955: {{convert|79.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/><br>1956: {{convert|80.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/>\n|height =1954\u201355: {{convert|62.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1956: {{convert|62.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|weight = {{convert|4500|-|5100|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n| designer = [[Harley Earl]]\n}}\n\n[[File:Cadillac Convertible.jpg|thumb|left|1954 Cadillac Series 62 [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado]]]]\n[[File:1955 Cadillac Series 62 Coupe.jpg|thumb|left|1955 Cadillac Series 62 Coupe]]\n[[File:Cadillac Series 626219 4-Door Sedan 1956.jpg|thumb|left|1956 Cadillac Series 62 Sedan]]\n[[File:1956 Cadillac Coupe De Ville white.jpg|thumb|left|1956 Cadillac Series 62 [[Cadillac Coupe de Ville|Coupe de Ville]]]]\n[[File:Cadillac Sedan De Ville 1956.jpg|thumb|left|1956 Cadillac Series 62 [[Cadillac Sedan de Ville|Sedan de Ville]]]]\n\nThe Series 62 included a lower sleeker body, a new cellular grille insert, and inverted gull wing front bumpers and tapered dagmar style bumper guards. Round jet style dual exhaust outlets were incorporated into the vertical bumper extensions and the rear bumper was entirely redesigned. An [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado]] style wraparound windshield was seen on all models. Sedans used a distinctive style of window reveal molding, which created a built in sun visor effect. For coupes a smoothly curved wraparound backlight was referred to as the \"Florentine\" style rear window. A wide ventilator intake was now stretched across the base of the windshield on all body styles and the chrome visored headlamp look was emphasized. The Series 62 could be distinguished by the lack of rear fender louvers. V-shaped ornaments and crests were used in the hood and deck and there were full length body underscores in bright metal. [[Cadillac Coupe de Ville|Coupe de Ville]] script was seen on rear corner pillars of the luxury hardtop, which also had wider sill moldings. The Eldorados had golden identifying crests centered directly behind the air-slot fender breaks and wide fluted beauty panels to decorate the lower rear body sides. These panels were made of extruded aluminum and also appeared on a unique one of a kind Eldorado coupe built for the Reynolds Aluminum Corporation. Also included in the production Eldorado convertible were monogram plates on the doors, wire wheels, and custom interior trimmings with the Cadillac crest embossed on the seat bolsters. Automatic windshield washers, power steering, 12-Volt electrical system, and aluminum alloy pistons made the long list of standard equipment for the first time this year. Power steering, windows, seats, and auto headlight dimming were optional.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{cite book|title=Popular Mechanics|date=September 1954|publisher=Hearst Magazines|issn=0032-4558|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_AeADAAAAMBAJ|accessdate=2017-01-08}}</ref>  A parking brake release reminder light was new.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AeADAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&cad=0 |title=Popular Mechanics - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref> Popular Mechanics rated the 0-60&nbsp;mph time as 17.3 seconds.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nIn 1955, the grille was redesigned with wider spaces between the blades and the parking lamps were repositioned beneath directly below the headlights. On the sides of the body the rub-rail moldings formed a right angle with the vertical trim on the rear doors or fenders. This accentuated the character line in the sheet metal. The Florentine curve rear window treatment was adopted for sedans. Three chrome moldings bordered the rear license plate on either side and deck lid decorations consisted of a V-shaped ornament and a Cadillac crest. The Coupe de Ville had a golden script nameplate at the upper body belt just forward of the rear window pillar. The Eldorado sport convertible featured extras such as wide chrome body belt moldings, a distinctive rear fender design, with twin round taillights halfway up the fenders and flatter pointed tailfins. Tubeless tires were a new standard Cadillac feature. Sales reached a record 118,190, accounting for nearly 84% of all Cadillacs sold. Standard equipment included back-up lights, turn signals, and automatic transmission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1955_Cadillac/1955_Cadillac_Brochure/1955%20Cadillac-07.html |title=Directory Index: Cadillac/1955_Cadillac/1955_Cadillac_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1955_Cadillac/1955_Cadillac_Brochure/1955%20Cadillac-03.html |title=Directory Index: Cadillac/1955_Cadillac/1955_Cadillac_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref>\n\nIn 1956, there was a new grille, with finer textured insert, and the repositioning of the parking lights in the bumpers, below the wing guards. Buyers were given an option of the standard satin finish grille or an optional gold finish. Cadillac script was found on the left side. A narrow chrome molding and nine vertical louvers were seen. The Coupe de Ville had a model nameplate and a Cadillac crest on the sides of the front fenders. The Coupe de Ville was joined by the Series 62 '''[[Cadillac Sedan de Ville|Sedan de Ville]]''', Cadillac's first standard production 4-door hardtop.<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/><ref name=\"Kowalke 1997\"/> Similarly to the Coupe de Ville, it was also more expensive and more luxuriously trimmed that the standard 4-door Series 62.<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/><ref name=\"Kowalke 1997\"/> With 41,732 sold, it also easily outsold the Series 62 sedan in its very first year.<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/><ref name=\"Kowalke 1997\"/> Given their sales success, it was only natural that the Coupe de Ville and Sedan de Ville were moved to their own separate series in 1959, the Series 6300, being joined by a De Ville convertible in 1964.<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/><ref name=\"Kowalke 1997\"/> The Eldorado subseries also gained a new bodystyle, a 2-door hardtop called the '''[[Cadillac Seville|Seville]]'''. An Eldorado script finally appeared with fender crest on the car which was further distinguished by a twin hood ornament. Extras featured on the Eldorado convertible, now known as the Biarritz in order to distinguish it from the Seville, were a ribbed chrome saddle molding extending from the windshield to the rear window pillar along the beltline and flat, pointed rear fender fins.

Front end styling was marked by rubber bumper guard tips and dual circular lamps set into the lower bumper section. Side trim was revised and a dual taillight theme was used. Identifying the standard 62 models were bright metal moldings, just forward of the rear wheel openings, highlighted by seven horizontal wind slits. At the upper end this fender brake trim joined a horizontal molding that ran along a conical flare extending towards both taillamps. A crest medallion was seen on the forward angled rear fins. [[Cadillac De Ville|De Villes]] had special nameplates on the front fenders. Series 62 [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorados]] (as distinct from the [[Cadillac Series 70|Series 70]] Eldorado [[Cadillac Brougham|Brougham]]) were further distinguished by the model name above a V-shaped rear deck ornament and on the front fenders. The rear fender and deck contour was trimmed with broad, sculptured stainless steel beauty panels. Also seen were \"shark\" style fins pointing towards the back of the cars. A three section built in front bumper was another exclusive trait of the Series 62 Eldorados, which came with a long list of standard features. A new body style was added to the subseries, a 4-door Eldorado Sedan [[Cadillac Seville|Seville]], but only four were actually sold, and it was cancelled the following year.\n\nFor 1958, there was a new grille featuring multiple round \"cleats\" at the intersection of the horizontal and vertical members. The grille insert was wider and new bumper guards were positioned lower to the parking lamps. New dual headlamps were used and small chrome fins decorated the front fenders. Tailfins were less pronounced and trim attachments were revised. The word Cadillac appeared in block letters on the fins of base models. On the sides of the car were five longer horizontal wind splits ahead of the unskirted rear wheel housing and front fender horizontal mouldings with crests placed above the trailing edge and no rocker sill trim. The convertible and the De Villes used solid metal trim on the lower half of the conical projection flares, while other models had a thin ridge molding in the same location. On Series 62 Eldorados, a V-shaped ornament and model identification script were mounted to the deck lid. Series 62 Eldorados also had ten vertical chevron slashes ahead of the open rear wheel housings and crest medallions on the flank of the tailfins. Broad, sculptured beauty panels decorated the lower rear quarters on all Series 62 Eldorados and extended around the wheel opening to stretch along the body sills. Standard equipment on all Series 62s was the same as the previous year. All new was an extended deck Series 62 sedan which, along with the Series 62 Sedan deVille, stretched 8.5 inches longer than the regular 4-door Series 62, and a special order Series 62 Eldorado Seville of which only one was actually built. Excluding export sedans and chassis only, the Series 62 offered an all-time record of nine bodystyles this year. The infamous Cadillac Air-Suspension was optional.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1958_Cadillac/1958_Cadillac_Brochure_1/1958%20Cadillac-15.html |title=Directory Index: Cadillac/1958_Cadillac/1958_Cadillac_Brochure_1 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref> The following year De Ville and Eldorado were spun off onto their own series.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:CaddyMapleJan08GB.jpg|1957 Cadillac Series 62 Sedan\nFile:CaddyMapleJan08SteerWheel.jpg|1957 Cadillac Series 62 Sedan interior\nFile:1957 Cadillac Coupe deVille.jpg|1957 Cadillac Series 62 [[Cadillac Coupe de Ville|Coupe de Ville]]\nFile:Cadillac De Ville 1957 2.jpg|1957 Cadillac Series 62 [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado Seville]]\nFile:Cadillac Coupe 1958.jpg|1958 Cadillac Series 62 coupe\nFile:Cadillac De Ville 1958.jpg|1958 Cadillac Series 62 [[Cadillac Sedan de Ville|Sedan de Ville]]\nFile:1958 Cadillac Sixty-Two Convertible.jpg|1958 Cadillac Series 62 Convertible\nFile:'58 Cadillac Convertible (Auto classique Salaberry-De-Valleyfield '11).JPG|1958 Cadillac Series 62 [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado Biarritz]]\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Sixth generation (1959\u20131960) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name = Sixth generation\n|image = 110 ans de l'automobile au Grand Palais - Cadillac Series 62 Coupe DeVille - 1959 - 002.jpg\n|model_years = 1959\u20131960\n|platform = [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]]\n|related = [[Cadillac Eldorado]]<br>[[Cadillac Sixty Special]]<br>[[Cadillac De Ville]]<br>[[Buick Electra]]<br>[[Oldsmobile 98]]\n|body_style = 2-door [[hardtop]]<br>4-door 6-window [[hardtop]]<br>4-door 4-window [[hardtop]]<br>2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]] \n|engine = {{convert|390|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine#390|OHV]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|transmission = 4-speed [[Hydra-Matic]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n|wheelbase = {{convert|130.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length = {{convert|225.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|width =1959: {{convert|80.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/><br>1960: {{convert|79.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/>\n|height = {{convert|56.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|weight = {{convert|4900|-|5100|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n|designer = [[Bill Mitchell (designer)|Bill Mitchell]]\n}}\n\n[[File:Cadillac-1959-rear.jpg|thumb|left|1959 Cadillac Series 62 coupe]]\n[[File:1959-Cadillac-4d-HT.jpg|thumb|left|1959 Cadillac Series 62 6-window sedan]]\n[[File:1959-Cadillac-conv-int.jpg|thumb|left|1959 Cadillac Series 62 convertible interior]]\n[[File:\u041a\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0430\u043a \u042d\u043b\u044c\u0434\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e 1960 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u0410\u043b\u043c\u0430-\u0410\u0442\u0430.3.JPG|thumb|left|1960 Cadillac Series 62 4-window sedan]]\n[[File:1959 Cadillac fins.jpg|thumb|right|With the exception of the Eldorado Brougham, 1959 Cadillacs were famous for high tailfins with double tail lights in mid-fin.

The new model year also saw two distinctive rooflines and roof pillar configurations, new jewel-like grille patterns and matching deck lid beauty panels. For 1959, the Series 6200 became the '''Series 62'''. [[Cadillac De Ville|De Villes]] and 2-door [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorados]] were moved from the Series 6200 to their own series, the '''Series 63''' and '''Series 64''' respectively, though they all, including the 4-door Eldorado [[Cadillac Brougham|Brougham]] (which was moved from the '''[[Cadillac Series 70|Series 70]]''' to '''Series 69'''), shared the same {{convert|130|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase. Engine output was an even 325&nbsp;hp (242&nbsp;kW) from the {{convert|390|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engine. The Series 62 was identifiable by its straight body rub moldings, running from front wheel opening to back bumpers, with crest medallions below the spear. A one-deck jeweled rear grille insert was seen. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, back-up lamps, windshield wipers, two-speed wipers, wheel discs, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror and oil filter. The convertible model had power windows and a two-way power seat. Plain fender skirts covered the rear wheels and 4-doors were available in either four-window or six-window hardtop configurations. With the De Villes and 2-door Eldorados in their own series sales plunged to only 70,736, the lowest since the 1950 model year.\n\nThe 1960 Series 62 had smoother, more restrained styling. General changes included a full-width grille, the elimination of pointed front bumper guards, increased restraint in the application of chrome trim, lower tailfins with oval shaped nacelles and front fender mounted directional indicator lamps. Series 62 models were distinguished by plain fender skirts, thin three-quarter length bodyside spears and Cadillac crests and lettering on short horizontal front fender bars mounted just behind the headlights. Four-window and six-window hardtop sedans were offered again. The former featured a one-piece wraparound backlight and [[Flat Top|flat-top]] roof, while the latter had a sloping rear window and roofline. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, dual back-up lamps, windshield wipers, two-speed wipers, wheel discs, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror and oil filter. The convertible model had power windows and a two-way power seat. Technical highlights were finned rear drums and an X-frame construction. Interiors were done in Fawn, Blue or Gray Cortina Cord or Turquoise, Green, Persian Sand, or Black Caspian cloth with Florentine vinyl bolsters. Convertibles were upholstered in Florentine leather single or two-tone combinations or monochromatic Cardiff leather combinations.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Seventh generation (1961\u20131964) ==\n[[File:MHV Cadillac 62 1961 01.jpg|thumb|left|1961 Cadillac Series 62 6-window sedan]]\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name = Seventh generation\n|image = Cadillac Convertible.JPG\n|model_years = 1961\u20131964\n|platform = [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]]\n|related = [[Cadillac Eldorado]]<br>[[Cadillac Sixty Special]]<br>[[Cadillac De Ville]]<br>[[Buick Electra]]<br>[[Oldsmobile 98]]\n|body_style = 2-door [[hardtop]]<br>4-door 6-window [[hardtop]]<br>4-door 4-window [[hardtop]]<br>4-door Town Sedan [[hardtop]]<br>2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]] \n|wheelbase = 1961\u201364: {{convert|129.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1962_Cadillac/1962_Cadillac_Brochure/1962%20Cadillac-12.html |title=Directory Index: Cadillac/1962_Cadillac/1962_Cadillac_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref>\n|length = 1961\u201362 (except Town Sedan): {{convert|222.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1962 Town Sedan: {{convert|215.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1963: {{convert|223.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1964: {{convert|223.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|engine = {{convert|390|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine|OHV]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>{{convert|429|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine|OHV]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 4-speed [[Hydra-Matic]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]]<br>3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#Super Turbine 400 / THM400 / 3L80 / 3L80HD|TH-400]], [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| width =1961: {{convert|79.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/><br>1962: {{convert|79.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/><br>1963: {{convert|79.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/><br>1964: {{convert|79.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/>\n|height =1961\u201362: {{convert|56.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1963\u201364: {{convert|56.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|weight = {{convert|4700|-|4900|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n| designer = [[Bill Mitchell (designer)|Bill Mitchell]]\n}}\n\n[[File:1962 Cadillac Series 62 Convertible.jpg|thumb|left|1962 Cadillac Series 62 convertible]]\n[[File:1963CadillacSeries62.jpg|thumb|left|1963 Cadillac Series 62 4-window sedan]]\n[[File:64 Cadillac fins.jpg|thumb|left|1964 Cadillac Series 62]]\n\nCadillac was restyled and re-engineered for 1961. The new grille slanted back towards both the bumper and the hood lip, along the horizontal plan, and sat between dual headlamps. New forward slanting front pillars with non-wraparound windshield glass were seen. The revised backlight treatment had crisp angular lines with thin pillars on some models and heavier semi-blind quarter roof posts on others. Standard equipment power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, dual reverse lights, windshield washer, dual speed wipers, wheel discs, plain fender skirts, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror and oil filter. Rubberized front and rear coil springs replaced the trouble prone air suspension system. Four-barrel induction systems were now the sole power choice and dual exhaust were no longer available.\n\nA mild face lift characterized Cadillac styling trends for 1962. A flatter grille with a thicker horizontal center bar and more delicate cross-hatched insert appeared. Ribbed chrome trim panel, seen ahead of the front wheel housings for 1961, were now replaced with standard cornering lamps<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1962_Cadillac/1962_Cadillac_Brochure/1962%20Cadillac-12.html |title=Directory Index: Cadillac/1962_Cadillac/1962_Cadillac_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref> and front fender model and series identification badges were eliminated. More massive front bumper end pieces appeared and housed rectangular parking lamps. At the rear tail lamps were now housed in vertical nacelles designed with an angled peak at the center. A vertically ribbed rear beauty panel appeared on the deck lid latch panel. Cadillac script also appeared on the lower left side of the radiator grille. The short-deck [[hardtop]] Town Sedan was moved from the Series 6300 to the Series 6200, being replaced by a short-deck Sedan de Ville Park Avenue in the Series 6300.<ref>Flory, J. \"Kelly\", Jr. ''American Cars 1960\u20131972'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Coy, 2004), p.147.</ref> In addition all short deck Cadillac models went from being 6-window sedans for 1961 to 4-window sedans for 1962 and 1963. The Town Sedan would disappear for 1963,<ref>Flory, p.210.</ref> with only 4,900 sold (of 134,572 Series 62s in all),<ref>Flory, pp.148 & 212.</ref> though the Sedan de Ville Park Avenue sold even fewer, 4,175 (out of 150,882 De Villes).<ref>Flory, pp.149 & 212.</ref> Standard equipment included all of last year's equipment plus remote controlled outside rearview mirror, five tubeless black wall tires, heater and defroster and front cornering lamps. Cadillac refined the ride and quietness, with more insulation in the floor and behind the firewall.<ref>Flory, p.147.</ref>\n\n1963 brought another restyle. Exterior changes imparted a bolder and longer look. Hoods and deck lids were redesigned. The front fenders projected 4.625\" further forward than for 1962 while the tailfins were trimmed down somewhat to provide a lower profile. Body side sculpturing was entirely eliminated. The slightly V-shaped radiator grille was taller and now incorporated outer extensions that swept below the flush-fender dual headlamps. Smaller circular front parking lamps were mounted in those extensions. A total of 143 options including bucket seats with wool, leather or nylon upholstery fabrics and wood veneer facings on dash, doors and seatbacks, set an all-time record for interior appointment choices. Standard equipment was the same as the previous year. Convertibles were equipped with additional features. The engine displacement and output remained the same, {{convert|390|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|325|hp|kW|abbr=on}}.<ref>Flory, p.211.</ref>\n\nA minor facelift for 1964 featured a new bi-angular grille that formed a V-shape along both its vertical and horizontal planes. The main horizontal grille bar was now carried around the body sides. Outer grille extension panels again housed the parking and cornering lamps. It was the 17th consecutive year for the Cadillac tailfins with a new fine-blade design carrying on the tradition. Performance improvements including a larger V-8 were the dominant changes for the model run. Equipment features were same as in 1963 for the most part. Comfort Control, a completely automatic heating and air conditioning system controlled by a dial thermostat on the instrument panel, was introduced as an industry first. The engine was bumped to {{convert|429|cid|l|0|abbr=on}}, with 340&nbsp;hp (253.5&nbsp;kW) available.

The Series 62 featured a low sleek \"torpedo\" style [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]] with chrome window reveals, more slant in the windshield, and a curved rear window. The new C-body that the 1940 Cadillac Series 62 shared with the [[Buick Roadmaster]] and [[Buick Super|Super]], the [[Oldsmobile 98|Oldsmobile Series 90]] and the [[Pontiac Torpedo]] featured shoulder and hip room that was over 5\" wider, the elimination of running boards and exterior styling that was streamlined and 2-3\" lower. When combined with a column mounted shift lever the cars offered true six passenger comfort. These changes had clearly been influenced by the [[Cadillac Sixty Special]]. The styling feature distinguishing all V-8 Cadillacs was once again the grille. Although grilles had the same pointed shape as in 1939, the grille bars were heavier and fewer in number. Two sets of louver bars appeared on each side of the hood. Running boards were a no cost option. The Series 62 was available as a club coupe or a sedan, with 2-door and 4-door convertibles introduced mid-year. Sales totaled 5903 in its inaugural year accounting for about 45% of Cadillac's sales.\n\nIn 1941, the one piece hood came down lower in the front, included the side panels and extended sideways to the fenders. A single rectangular panel of louver trim was used on each side of the hood. The rectangular grille was wide, vertical, and bulged forward in the middle. Rectangular parking lights were built into the top outer corners of the grille. Headlights were now built into the nose of the fenders, and provision for built in accessory fog lights was provided under the headlights. Three chrome spears appeared on the rear section of all four fenders. Rear fender skirts were standard. The Series 62 offered the only 4-door convertible built by Cadillac in 1941 and it would be the last time this bodystyle was ever made by the marque. All Cadillacs shared the same {{convert|346|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} 135&nbsp;hp (101&nbsp;kW) [[Cadillac V8 engine|L-head]] [[V8 engine|V8]] that year, with power rising to 150&nbsp;hp (112&nbsp;kW).\n\nSales more than quadrupled to 24,734, accounting for 37% of Cadillac sales in a sales year that well more than doubled the previous Cadillac sales rate record set during the two model years of 1926\u201327, in part due to the huge popularity of the new Series 61. Evidently the new \"torpedo\" style with its low streamlined runningboardless bodies and expansive shoulder room had proved a big hit. The following model year, abbreviated as it was by a world war, would set no such sales record.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Second generation (1942\u20131947) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name = Second generation\n|image = Cadillac Convertible 1942.jpg\n|model_years = 1942\u20131947\n|platform = [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]]\n|body_style = 2-door [[coup\u00e9|coupe]]<br>4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br>2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]] \n| engine        = {{convert|346|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine#Monobloc|Monobloc]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission =3-speed selective [[synchromesh]] [[manual transmission|manual]]<br>4-speed [[Hydra-Matic]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n|wheelbase = {{convert|129.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length =1942: {{convert|220.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/><br>1946\u201347: {{convert|219.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/>\n| width = {{convert|80.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/>\n| height = {{convert|63.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|4300|-|4700|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n| designer = [[Harley Earl]]\n| related = [[Cadillac Sixty Special]]<br>[[Buick Roadmaster]]<br>[[Buick Super]]<br>[[Oldsmobile 98]]\n}}\n\n[[File:Cadillac Series 62 1946.jpg|thumb|left|1946 Cadillac Series 62 coupe]]\n[[File:1947 Cadillac Series 62 Convertible.jpg|thumb|left|1947 Cadillac Series 62 convertible]]\n[[File:Cadillac Series 62 ca 1946.jpg|thumb|left|1946 Cadillac Series 62 4-door sedan]]\n\nThe grille became more massive in 1942, with even fewer bars. Parking lights became round and fog light sockets became rectangular and were included in the grille area. A bullet shape appeared on the tops of the bumper guards. Fenders were rounded and longer. Front fenders extended into the front doors. Rear fenders extended forward into the rear doors. The new fenders had heavy moldings along the sides. A new fresh air ventilating system with air ducts leading from the grille replaced cowl ventilators. Handbrake control was changed from lever to tee-shaped pull handle. Radiator shutter control of engine temperature was replaced by a blocking type thermostat in the water return fitting in the radiator.\n\nThe first postwar Cadillac rolled off the line on October 7, 1945 and for several months, only Series 62s were produced. 1946 Cadillacs were not significantly altered from 1942 outside a few styling changes and the addition of a negative ground battery. The Series 62 retained the same lineup of body styles as in 1942\u2014coupe, sedan, and convertible, and 18,565 total were produced for the model year, approximately 65% of Cadillac's total 1946 output of 29,000 vehicles. Resuming civilian production was a difficult task for the entire automobile industry and demand for new cars much exceeded supply. Cadillac had as many as 100,000 unfilled orders into 1947. Due to materials shortages, some Cadillacs shipped from the factory with wooden bumpers, dealers being expected to install proper ones as they became available. Postwar inflation pushed the sticker price of a 1946 Cadillac over $1000 higher than 1942.\n\nIn 1946, the Series 62 used GM's [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]] platform, as did the [[Cadillac Sixty Special]], [[Buick Super]] and [[Buick Roadmaster]], and [[Oldsmobile 98]]. Notchback styling characterized the cars except for the Club Coupe which had fastback styling. It was easy to distinguish the Series 62 coupe from the Series 61 because the door skins did not flare out above the rocker panel moldings, and the side window openings were lower and the reveal window moldings circled each window individually instead of looping around all the windows. The Series 62 sedan featured venti planes on both the front and rear windows. It was also the first Cadillac to enter production after World War II. Interior styling and technical features were similar to those seen on the [[Cadillac Series 61]] but with slightly richer interior appointments. Late 1946 models introduced technical changes to the V8 engine in the form of hardened ball seats for the hydraulic lifters.\n\nThe 1947 models received minor styling changes and the addition of Hydro-Lectric window lifts on the Series 62 convertible, which remained the sole ragtop in Cadillac's lineup. Polished metal stone guards on the fenders replaced the rubber ones used on 1946 models. As before, Series 62s remained Cadillac's bread-and-butter lineup with 39,834 produced, 84% of the make's total 1947 volume.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Third generation (1948\u20131953) ==\n[[File:Cadillac 6207 1949.jpg|thumb|left|1949 Cadillac Series 62 2-door coupe]]\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name = Third generation\n|image = Cadillac Convertible 1949 2.jpg\n|caption = 1949 Cadillac Series Sixty-Two Convertible\n|model_years = 1948\u20131953\n|platform = [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]]\n|related = [[Cadillac Series 61]]<br>[[Cadillac Sixty Special]]<br>[[Buick Roadmaster]]<br>[[Buick Super]]<br>[[Oldsmobile 98]] \n|body_style = 2-door [[coup\u00e9|coupe]]<br>2-door [[hardtop]]<br>4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] <br>2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]<br>2-door [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado]] [[convertible (car)|convertible]]\n|engine = {{convert|346|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine#Monobloc|Monobloc]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>{{convert|331|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine|OHV]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 3-speed selective [[synchromesh]] [[manual transmission|manual]]<br>4-speed [[Hydra-Matic]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n|wheelbase = {{convert|126.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length = 1948\u20131950: {{convert|214.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1951: {{convert|215.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1952\u201353 4-door: {{convert|215.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1952\u201353 2-door: {{convert|220.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|width = 1948: {{Convert|79.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1949: {{Convert|78.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} <br>1950\u20131953: {{convert|80.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/>\n|height = {{Convert|62.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|weight = {{convert|4400|-|5000|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n| designer = [[Harley Earl]]\n}}\n\n[[File:Cadillac Coupe De Ville 1950.jpg|thumb|left|1950 Cadillac Series 62 [[Cadillac Coupe de Ville|Coupe de Ville]]]]\n[[File:1952 Cadillac 62 conv.jpg|thumb|left|1952 Cadillac Series 62 convertible]]\n[[File:1953 Cadillac.jpg|thumb|left|1953 Cadillac Series 62 Coupe]]\n[[File:1953 custom Cadillac El Dorado 01.jpg|thumb|left|1953 Cadillac Series 62 [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado]]]]\n\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:1952 Cadillac Series 62.jpg|200px|thumb|left|1952 Cadillac Series 62 convertible|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Tuesday, 14 April 2009|date=May 2012}}]] -->The first all-new postwar Cadillacs arrived in 1948, sporting an aircraft-inspired look and the first tail fins on a Cadillac. Series 62 Cadillacs had a slightly shortened wheelbase, but the track width was widened by two inches, increasing interior room. However, updated drivetrains would have to wait another year and for the time being, the new Cadillacs were still powered by the same 346 CID flathead V8 used across the board since 1941, which delivered only fair performance (0-60 in 16 seconds with a top speed of 93&nbsp;mph). Fuel mileage was an estimated 14 mpg highway, 10 mpg city with the Hydramatic transmission, which was rapidly becoming the norm on Cadillacs\u2014by 1949, only 10% of Cadillacs were ordered with the 3-speed manual gearbox. Series 62 production totaled 34,213 vehicles for the 1948 model year, accounting for 68% of Cadillac's volume. The 1948 models had been slow to get into production and did not arrive in showrooms until February 1948, consequently Cadillac produced on 50,599 total vehicles for the abbreviated model year.\n\nThe new Cadillac OHV V8 was the big news for 1949, with minor trim differences otherwise. This 331 cu in (5.4 L) engine produced 160&nbsp;hp (119&nbsp;kW) and weighed 200 pounds less than the old flathead V8 in addition to being shorter and lower. The 331 V8 could also handle higher compression levels to take advantage of improved, higher octane postwar gasoline formulations. The major difference between Series 61 and Series 62 models of similar body style was minor trim variations. The higher-priced series again had grooved, front fender stone shields and bright rocker panel moldings. Chevrons below the taillights were no longer seen. The convertible was an exclusive offering. A heater was optional.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1949_Cadillac/1949_Cadillac_Brochure/1949%20Cadillac-18.html |title=Directory Index: Cadillac/1949_Cadillac/1949_Cadillac_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref> Sales reached a record 55,643.\n\nThe Cadillac Series 62 '''[[Cadillac Coupe de Ville|Coupe de Ville]]''' was introduced late in the 1949 model year.<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/><ref name=\"Kowalke 1997\">{{cite book|last=Kowalke|first=Ron|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946-1975|year=1997|publisher=Krause publications|isbn=0-87341-521-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/standardcatalogo00beve}}</ref> Along with the [[Buick Roadmaster]] [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]], and the [[Oldsmobile 98]] Holiday, it was among the first pillarless [[hardtop]] coupes ever produced.<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/><ref name=\"Kowalke 1997\"/> At $3,496 it was only a dollar less than the Series 62 convertible, and like the convertible, it came with power windows standard.

The cars were lower and sleeker, with longer hoods, and one-piece windshields were fitted. Hydra Matic transmission was now standard. The Series 61 was again a short wheelbase model, having been reduced to 122 in (3099&nbsp;mm). Sales set yet another record at 59,818.\n\nFull-length chrome rocker panels set off the 1951 model, and the Coupe de Ville was now marked with noticeably-improved trim, including Coupe de Ville script on the rear roof pillar. Sales were 81,844, or a record of over 74% of all Cadillacs sold. ''Popular Mechanics'' reported about 12-MPG at 45&nbsp;mph.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=Popular Mechanics|date=February 1932|publisher=Hearst Magazines|issn=0032-4558|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_4-EDAAAAMBAJ|accessdate=2017-01-08}}</ref>\n\nIn 1952, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Cadillac, the V-shaped hood and deck emblems were done as gold castings. The Series 62 sedan was also characterized by a higher rear deck lid contour. This provided additional luggage space. Back up lights were now standard equipment and were incorporated in the taillights. The grille wraparound panels were redesigned once again having broad chrome trim below each headlight with side scoop styling and gold-colored winged emblem mounted in the center. At the rear all Cadillacs adopted a through the bumper dual exhaust system. Deck ornamentation took the form of a Cadillac crest over abroad golden \"V\". New standard features included self-winding clocks, improved direction signal indicators, glare proof mirrors, stannate treated pistons, and four barrel carburetion. Engine output for the 331 was up to 190&nbsp;hp (142&nbsp;kW). Sales fell to 70,255, but with the Series 61 out of the way, Series 62 sales accounted for a record 78% of all Cadillacs.\n\nThe 1953 Series 62 saw a redesigned grille with heavier integral bumper and bumper guards, the repositioning of parking lamps directly under the headlights, chrome \"eybrow\" type headlamp doors, and one piece rear windows without division bars. Wheel discs were fashioned in an attractive new disced design. Series 62 bodystyles were identified by non louvered rear fenders, the use of thin bright metal underscores on the bottom rear of the cars only and the decoration of both hood and deck lid with Cadillac crests and V- shaped ornaments. The Club Coupe model disappeared. Two door Series 62 were now all hardtops (including the better equipped Coupe de Ville) or convertibles. Another familiar name appeared on 1953's Series 62. The top of the line subseries '''[[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado]]''' was one of three specialty convertibles produced in 1953 by General Motors, the other two being the [[Oldsmobile 98]] Fiesta and the [[Buick Roadmaster]] [[Buick Skylark|Skylark]]. The Eldorado was a limited-edition luxury convertible, and would eventually become its own series. It featured a full assortment of deluxe accessories, including wire wheels, and introduced the wraparound windshield to Cadillac standard production. Sales set a new record at 85,446.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Fourth generation (1954\u20131956) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name = Fourth generation\n|image = '55 Cadillac Convertible (Auto classique Pointe-Claire '11).JPG\n|caption = 1955 Cadillac Series 62 Convertible\n|model_years = 1954\u20131956\n|platform = [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]]\n| related = [[Cadillac Sixty Special]]<br>[[Buick Roadmaster]]<br>[[Buick Super]]<br>[[Oldsmobile 98]]\n|body_style = 2-door [[hardtop]]<br>2-door [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado Seville]] [[hardtop]]<br>4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br>[[Cadillac Sedan de Ville|4-door Sedan de Ville]] [[hardtop]]<br>2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]<br>2-door [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado]] [[convertible (car)|convertible]]\n| engine = {{convert|331|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine#331|OHV]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>{{convert|365|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine#365|OHV]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 4-speed [[Hydra-Matic]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n|wheelbase = {{convert|129.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length = 1954 4-door: {{convert|216.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1954 2-door: {{convert|223.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1955 4-door: {{convert|216.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1955 2-door: {{convert|223.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1956 4-door: {{convert|214.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1956 2-door: {{convert|221.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|width =1954: {{convert|79.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/><br>1955: {{convert|79.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/><br>1956: {{convert|80.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/>\n|height =1954\u201355: {{convert|62.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1956: {{convert|62.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|weight = {{convert|4500|-|5100|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n| designer = [[Harley Earl]]\n}}\n\n[[File:Cadillac Convertible.jpg|thumb|left|1954 Cadillac Series 62 [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado]]]]\n[[File:1955 Cadillac Series 62 Coupe.jpg|thumb|left|1955 Cadillac Series 62 Coupe]]\n[[File:Cadillac Series 626219 4-Door Sedan 1956.jpg|thumb|left|1956 Cadillac Series 62 Sedan]]\n[[File:1956 Cadillac Coupe De Ville white.jpg|thumb|left|1956 Cadillac Series 62 [[Cadillac Coupe de Ville|Coupe de Ville]]]]\n[[File:Cadillac Sedan De Ville 1956.jpg|thumb|left|1956 Cadillac Series 62 [[Cadillac Sedan de Ville|Sedan de Ville]]]]\n\nThe Series 62 included a lower sleeker body, a new cellular grille insert, and inverted gull wing front bumpers and tapered dagmar style bumper guards. Round jet style dual exhaust outlets were incorporated into the vertical bumper extensions and the rear bumper was entirely redesigned. An [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado]] style wraparound windshield was seen on all models. Sedans used a distinctive style of window reveal molding, which created a built in sun visor effect. For coupes a smoothly curved wraparound backlight was referred to as the \"Florentine\" style rear window. A wide ventilator intake was now stretched across the base of the windshield on all body styles and the chrome visored headlamp look was emphasized. The Series 62 could be distinguished by the lack of rear fender louvers. V-shaped ornaments and crests were used in the hood and deck and there were full length body underscores in bright metal. [[Cadillac Coupe de Ville|Coupe de Ville]] script was seen on rear corner pillars of the luxury hardtop, which also had wider sill moldings. The Eldorados had golden identifying crests centered directly behind the air-slot fender breaks and wide fluted beauty panels to decorate the lower rear body sides. These panels were made of extruded aluminum and also appeared on a unique one of a kind Eldorado coupe built for the Reynolds Aluminum Corporation. Also included in the production Eldorado convertible were monogram plates on the doors, wire wheels, and custom interior trimmings with the Cadillac crest embossed on the seat bolsters. Automatic windshield washers, power steering, 12-Volt electrical system, and aluminum alloy pistons made the long list of standard equipment for the first time this year.

On the sides of the body the rub-rail moldings formed a right angle with the vertical trim on the rear doors or fenders. This accentuated the character line in the sheet metal. The Florentine curve rear window treatment was adopted for sedans. Three chrome moldings bordered the rear license plate on either side and deck lid decorations consisted of a V-shaped ornament and a Cadillac crest. The Coupe de Ville had a golden script nameplate at the upper body belt just forward of the rear window pillar. The Eldorado sport convertible featured extras such as wide chrome body belt moldings, a distinctive rear fender design, with twin round taillights halfway up the fenders and flatter pointed tailfins. Tubeless tires were a new standard Cadillac feature. Sales reached a record 118,190, accounting for nearly 84% of all Cadillacs sold. Standard equipment included back-up lights, turn signals, and automatic transmission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1955_Cadillac/1955_Cadillac_Brochure/1955%20Cadillac-07.html |title=Directory Index: Cadillac/1955_Cadillac/1955_Cadillac_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1955_Cadillac/1955_Cadillac_Brochure/1955%20Cadillac-03.html |title=Directory Index: Cadillac/1955_Cadillac/1955_Cadillac_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref>\n\nIn 1956, there was a new grille, with finer textured insert, and the repositioning of the parking lights in the bumpers, below the wing guards. Buyers were given an option of the standard satin finish grille or an optional gold finish. Cadillac script was found on the left side. A narrow chrome molding and nine vertical louvers were seen. The Coupe de Ville had a model nameplate and a Cadillac crest on the sides of the front fenders.

An Eldorado script finally appeared with fender crest on the car which was further distinguished by a twin hood ornament. Extras featured on the Eldorado convertible, now known as the Biarritz in order to distinguish it from the Seville, were a ribbed chrome saddle molding extending from the windshield to the rear window pillar along the beltline and flat, pointed rear fender fins.

Front end styling was marked by rubber bumper guard tips and dual circular lamps set into the lower bumper section. Side trim was revised and a dual taillight theme was used. Identifying the standard 62 models were bright metal moldings, just forward of the rear wheel openings, highlighted by seven horizontal wind slits. At the upper end this fender brake trim joined a horizontal molding that ran along a conical flare extending towards both taillamps. A crest medallion was seen on the forward angled rear fins. [[Cadillac De Ville|De Villes]] had special nameplates on the front fenders. Series 62 [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorados]] (as distinct from the [[Cadillac Series 70|Series 70]] Eldorado [[Cadillac Brougham|Brougham]]) were further distinguished by the model name above a V-shaped rear deck ornament and on the front fenders. The rear fender and deck contour was trimmed with broad, sculptured stainless steel beauty panels. Also seen were \"shark\" style fins pointing towards the back of the cars. A three section built in front bumper was another exclusive trait of the Series 62 Eldorados, which came with a long list of standard features. A new body style was added to the subseries, a 4-door Eldorado Sedan [[Cadillac Seville|Seville]], but only four were actually sold, and it was cancelled the following year.\n\nFor 1958, there was a new grille featuring multiple round \"cleats\" at the intersection of the horizontal and vertical members. The grille insert was wider and new bumper guards were positioned lower to the parking lamps. New dual headlamps were used and small chrome fins decorated the front fenders. Tailfins were less pronounced and trim attachments were revised. The word Cadillac appeared in block letters on the fins of base models. On the sides of the car were five longer horizontal wind splits ahead of the unskirted rear wheel housing and front fender horizontal mouldings with crests placed above the trailing edge and no rocker sill trim. The convertible and the De Villes used solid metal trim on the lower half of the conical projection flares, while other models had a thin ridge molding in the same location. On Series 62 Eldorados, a V-shaped ornament and model identification script were mounted to the deck lid. Series 62 Eldorados also had ten vertical chevron slashes ahead of the open rear wheel housings and crest medallions on the flank of the tailfins. Broad, sculptured beauty panels decorated the lower rear quarters on all Series 62 Eldorados and extended around the wheel opening to stretch along the body sills. Standard equipment on all Series 62s was the same as the previous year. All new was an extended deck Series 62 sedan which, along with the Series 62 Sedan deVille, stretched 8.5 inches longer than the regular 4-door Series 62, and a special order Series 62 Eldorado Seville of which only one was actually built. Excluding export sedans and chassis only, the Series 62 offered an all-time record of nine bodystyles this year. The infamous Cadillac Air-Suspension was optional.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1958_Cadillac/1958_Cadillac_Brochure_1/1958%20Cadillac-15.html |title=Directory Index: Cadillac/1958_Cadillac/1958_Cadillac_Brochure_1 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref> The following year De Ville and Eldorado were spun off onto their own series.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:CaddyMapleJan08GB.jpg|1957 Cadillac Series 62 Sedan\nFile:CaddyMapleJan08SteerWheel.jpg|1957 Cadillac Series 62 Sedan interior\nFile:1957 Cadillac Coupe deVille.jpg|1957 Cadillac Series 62 [[Cadillac Coupe de Ville|Coupe de Ville]]\nFile:Cadillac De Ville 1957 2.jpg|1957 Cadillac Series 62 [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado Seville]]\nFile:Cadillac Coupe 1958.jpg|1958 Cadillac Series 62 coupe\nFile:Cadillac De Ville 1958.jpg|1958 Cadillac Series 62 [[Cadillac Sedan de Ville|Sedan de Ville]]\nFile:1958 Cadillac Sixty-Two Convertible.jpg|1958 Cadillac Series 62 Convertible\nFile:'58 Cadillac Convertible (Auto classique Salaberry-De-Valleyfield '11).JPG|1958 Cadillac Series 62 [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado Biarritz]]\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Sixth generation (1959\u20131960) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name = Sixth generation\n|image = 110 ans de l'automobile au Grand Palais - Cadillac Series 62 Coupe DeVille - 1959 - 002.jpg\n|model_years = 1959\u20131960\n|platform = [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]]\n|related = [[Cadillac Eldorado]]<br>[[Cadillac Sixty Special]]<br>[[Cadillac De Ville]]<br>[[Buick Electra]]<br>[[Oldsmobile 98]]\n|body_style = 2-door [[hardtop]]<br>4-door 6-window [[hardtop]]<br>4-door 4-window [[hardtop]]<br>2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]] \n|engine = {{convert|390|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine#390|OHV]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|transmission = 4-speed [[Hydra-Matic]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n|wheelbase = {{convert|130.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length = {{convert|225.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|width =1959: {{convert|80.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/><br>1960: {{convert|79.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/>\n|height = {{convert|56.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|weight = {{convert|4900|-|5100|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n|designer = [[Bill Mitchell (designer)|Bill Mitchell]]\n}}\n\n[[File:Cadillac-1959-rear.jpg|thumb|left|1959 Cadillac Series 62 coupe]]\n[[File:1959-Cadillac-4d-HT.jpg|thumb|left|1959 Cadillac Series 62 6-window sedan]]\n[[File:1959-Cadillac-conv-int.jpg|thumb|left|1959 Cadillac Series 62 convertible interior]]\n[[File:\u041a\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0430\u043a \u042d\u043b\u044c\u0434\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e 1960 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u0410\u043b\u043c\u0430-\u0410\u0442\u0430.3.JPG|thumb|left|1960 Cadillac Series 62 4-window sedan]]\n[[File:1959 Cadillac fins.jpg|thumb|right|With the exception of the Eldorado Brougham, 1959 Cadillacs were famous for high tailfins with double tail lights in mid-fin.

The new model year also saw two distinctive rooflines and roof pillar configurations, new jewel-like grille patterns and matching deck lid beauty panels. For 1959, the Series 6200 became the '''Series 62'''. [[Cadillac De Ville|De Villes]] and 2-door [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorados]] were moved from the Series 6200 to their own series, the '''Series 63''' and '''Series 64''' respectively, though they all, including the 4-door Eldorado [[Cadillac Brougham|Brougham]] (which was moved from the '''[[Cadillac Series 70|Series 70]]''' to '''Series 69'''), shared the same {{convert|130|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase. Engine output was an even 325&nbsp;hp (242&nbsp;kW) from the {{convert|390|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engine. The Series 62 was identifiable by its straight body rub moldings, running from front wheel opening to back bumpers, with crest medallions below the spear. A one-deck jeweled rear grille insert was seen. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, back-up lamps, windshield wipers, two-speed wipers, wheel discs, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror and oil filter. The convertible model had power windows and a two-way power seat. Plain fender skirts covered the rear wheels and 4-doors were available in either four-window or six-window hardtop configurations. With the De Villes and 2-door Eldorados in their own series sales plunged to only 70,736, the lowest since the 1950 model year.\n\nThe 1960 Series 62 had smoother, more restrained styling. General changes included a full-width grille, the elimination of pointed front bumper guards, increased restraint in the application of chrome trim, lower tailfins with oval shaped nacelles and front fender mounted directional indicator lamps. Series 62 models were distinguished by plain fender skirts, thin three-quarter length bodyside spears and Cadillac crests and lettering on short horizontal front fender bars mounted just behind the headlights. Four-window and six-window hardtop sedans were offered again. The former featured a one-piece wraparound backlight and flat-top roof, while the latter had a sloping rear window and roofline. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, dual back-up lamps, windshield wipers, two-speed wipers, wheel discs, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror and oil filter. The convertible model had power windows and a two-way power seat. Technical highlights were finned rear drums and an X-frame construction. Interiors were done in Fawn, Blue or Gray Cortina Cord or Turquoise, Green, Persian Sand, or Black Caspian cloth with Florentine vinyl bolsters. Convertibles were upholstered in Florentine leather single or two-tone combinations or monochromatic Cardiff leather combinations.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Seventh generation (1961\u20131964) ==\n[[File:MHV Cadillac 62 1961 01.jpg|thumb|left|1961 Cadillac Series 62 6-window sedan]]\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name = Seventh generation\n|image = Cadillac Convertible.JPG\n|model_years = 1961\u20131964\n|platform = [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]]\n|related = [[Cadillac Eldorado]]<br>[[Cadillac Sixty Special]]<br>[[Cadillac De Ville]]<br>[[Buick Electra]]<br>[[Oldsmobile 98]]\n|body_style = 2-door [[hardtop]]<br>4-door 6-window [[hardtop]]<br>4-door 4-window [[hardtop]]<br>4-door Town Sedan [[hardtop]]<br>2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]] \n|wheelbase = 1961\u201364: {{convert|129.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1962_Cadillac/1962_Cadillac_Brochure/1962%20Cadillac-12.html |title=Directory Index: Cadillac/1962_Cadillac/1962_Cadillac_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref>\n|length = 1961\u201362 (except Town Sedan): {{convert|222.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1962 Town Sedan: {{convert|215.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1963: {{convert|223.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1964: {{convert|223.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|engine = {{convert|390|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine|OHV]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>{{convert|429|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine|OHV]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 4-speed [[Hydra-Matic]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]]<br>3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#Super Turbine 400 / THM400 / 3L80 / 3L80HD|TH-400]], [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| width =1961: {{convert|79.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/><br>1962: {{convert|79.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/><br>1963: {{convert|79.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/><br>1964: {{convert|79.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Gunnell 2005\"/>\n|height =1961\u201362: {{convert|56.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1963\u201364: {{convert|56.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|weight = {{convert|4700|-|4900|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n| designer = [[Bill Mitchell (designer)|Bill Mitchell]]\n}}\n\n[[File:1962 Cadillac Series 62 Convertible.jpg|thumb|left|1962 Cadillac Series 62 convertible]]\n[[File:1963CadillacSeries62.jpg|thumb|left|1963 Cadillac Series 62 4-window sedan]]\n[[File:64 Cadillac fins.jpg|thumb|left|1964 Cadillac Series 62]]\n\nCadillac was restyled and re-engineered for 1961. The new grille slanted back towards both the bumper and the hood lip, along the horizontal plan, and sat between dual headlamps. New forward slanting front pillars with non-wraparound windshield glass were seen. The revised backlight treatment had crisp angular lines with thin pillars on some models and heavier semi-blind quarter roof posts on others. Standard equipment power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, dual reverse lights, windshield washer, dual speed wipers, wheel discs, plain fender skirts, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror and oil filter. Rubberized front and rear coil springs replaced the trouble prone air suspension system. Four-barrel induction systems were now the sole power choice and dual exhaust were no longer available.\n\nA mild face lift characterized Cadillac styling trends for 1962. A flatter grille with a thicker horizontal center bar and more delicate cross-hatched insert appeared. Ribbed chrome trim panel, seen ahead of the front wheel housings for 1961, were now replaced with standard cornering lamps<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1962_Cadillac/1962_Cadillac_Brochure/1962%20Cadillac-12.html |title=Directory Index: Cadillac/1962_Cadillac/1962_Cadillac_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref> and front fender model and series identification badges were eliminated. More massive front bumper end pieces appeared and housed rectangular parking lamps. At the rear tail lamps were now housed in vertical nacelles designed with an angled peak at the center. A vertically ribbed rear beauty panel appeared on the deck lid latch panel. Cadillac script also appeared on the lower left side of the radiator grille. The short-deck [[hardtop]] Town Sedan was moved from the Series 6300 to the Series 6200, being replaced by a short-deck Sedan de Ville Park Avenue in the Series 6300.<ref>Flory, J. \"Kelly\", Jr. ''American Cars 1960\u20131972'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Coy, 2004), p.147.</ref> In addition all short deck Cadillac models went from being 6-window sedans for 1961 to 4-window sedans for 1962 and 1963. The Town Sedan would disappear for 1963,<ref>Flory, p.210.</ref> with only 4,900 sold (of 134,572 Series 62s in all),<ref>Flory, pp.148 & 212.</ref> though the Sedan de Ville Park Avenue sold even fewer, 4,175 (out of 150,882 De Villes).<ref>Flory, pp.149 & 212.</ref> Standard equipment included all of last year's equipment plus remote controlled outside rearview mirror, five tubeless black wall tires, heater and defroster and front cornering lamps. Cadillac refined the ride and quietness, with more insulation in the floor and behind the firewall.<ref>Flory, p.147.</ref>\n\n1963 brought another restyle. Exterior changes imparted a bolder and longer look. Hoods and deck lids were redesigned. The front fenders projected 4.625\" further forward than for 1962 while the tailfins were trimmed down somewhat to provide a lower profile. Body side sculpturing was entirely eliminated. The slightly V-shaped radiator grille was taller and now incorporated outer extensions that swept below the flush-fender dual headlamps. Smaller circular front parking lamps were mounted in those extensions. A total of 143 options including bucket seats with wool, leather or nylon upholstery fabrics and wood veneer facings on dash, doors and seatbacks, set an all-time record for interior appointment choices. Standard equipment was the same as the previous year. Convertibles were equipped with additional features. The engine displacement and output remained the same, {{convert|390|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|325|hp|kW|abbr=on}}.<ref>Flory, p.211.</ref>\n\nA minor facelift for 1964 featured a new bi-angular grille that formed a V-shape along both its vertical and horizontal planes. The main horizontal grille bar was now carried around the body sides. Outer grille extension panels again housed the parking and cornering lamps. It was the 17th consecutive year for the Cadillac tailfins with a new fine-blade design carrying on the tradition. Performance improvements including a larger V-8 were the dominant changes for the model run. Equipment features were same as in 1963 for the most part. Comfort Control, a completely automatic heating and air conditioning system controlled by a dial thermostat on the instrument panel, was introduced as an industry first. The engine was bumped to {{convert|429|cid|l|0|abbr=on}}, with 340&nbsp;hp (253.5&nbsp;kW) available. In its final year only 35,079 Series 62s were sold, the smallest number since 1946 and little more than a quarter of their all-time sales record in 1956. The 62 convertible was dropped for 1964. \n{{clear}}\n \nThe Series 62 (n\u00e9e 6200) designation was dropped after 1964. Cadillac's entry level car was renamed [[Cadillac Calais|Calais]] for 1965-1976.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Cadillac timeline}}\n\n[[Category:Cadillac vehicles|62]]\n[[Category:Motor vehicles manufactured in the United States]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1940]]\n[[Category:1950s cars]]\n[[Category:1960s cars]]\n", "name_user": "Shantaram1", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSixth generation (1959\u20131960):reference to FLAT TOP dismabuiguity", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac_Series_62"}

For instance in ninth-century Spain \u27e8saeculum\u27e9 was simply the correct way to spell [sjeglo], meaning 'century'. The writer would not have actually said [s\u025bkulum] any more than a modern English speaker would pronounce \u27e8knight\u27e9 as *[kn\u026axt].<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 44\u201350</ref> \n\n[[Ecclesiastical Latin]], in its spoken form, was created later during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The British scholar [[Alcuin]], tasked by [[Charlemagne]] with improving the standards of Latin writing in France, prescribed a pronunciation based on a fairly literal interpretation of Latin spelling. A word such as \u27e8viridiarium\u27e9 'orchard' now had to be read aloud precisely as it was spelled rather than as [[Old French]] ''vergier.''<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 104\u20137</ref>\n\nThis had the effect of rendering [[Sermon|sermons]] completely unintelligible to the general public, which prompted officials a few years later- at the [[Council of Tours]]- to order them to be rendered ''in rusticam romanam linguam'', 'in plain roman speech', i.e. in Romance.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 118-20</ref> Another issue was that now two types of speech, Romance and Church Latin, had to coexist within one writing system. Within the same century the first attempts were made to devise an orthography specifically for Romance, as can be seen in the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] and the [[Sequence of Saint Eulalia|Canticle of Saint Eulalia]], both written in France. As the Carolingian Reforms spread to other Romance-speaking areas, local scholars devised orthographies for their own varieties of Romance as well.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 122\u201332, 143\u20134</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist-lg}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* {{Cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|date=2014-11-14|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|editor2-last=Schweickard|editor2-first=Wolfgang|editor3-last=Gouvert|editor3-first=Joannes|editor4-last=Kramer|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110313482|journal=Beihefte zur Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=|pages=295|doi=10.1515/9783110313482|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/963581913|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom) 2|date=2016|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2016|isbn=3-11-045361-4|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|location=|pages=|oclc=963581913|editor-last2=Gouvert|editor-first2=Xavier}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Loporcaro|first=Michele|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1107082342|title=Vowel Length From Latin to Romance|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-19-965655-4|location=|pages=25-30|oclc=1107082342}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Steven N.|date=2016-01-01|title=Do Romanists need to reconstruct Proto-Romance?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=132|issue=1|pages=2|doi=10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|issn=1865-9063|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Thaddeus|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110806960|title=A History of the Romance Vowel Systems through Paradigmatic Reconstruction|date=1976-01-31|publisher=De Gruyter|year=|isbn=978-3-11-080696-0|location=Berlin, Boston|pages=78}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Wilkinson, Hugh E.|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1055897845|title=Notes on the development of -KJ-, -TJ- in Spanish and Portuguese|date=1926|publisher=Aoyama Gakuin University|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=11-14|oclc=1055897845}}\n* {{Citation|last=Zampaulo|first=Andr\u00e9|title=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance languages|date=2019-08-22|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198807384.003.0006|work=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance Languages|volume=|pages=150\u2013199|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-880738-4|access-date=2020-04-01}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=De Dardel|first=R.|last2=Gaeng|first2=P.

For instance in ninth-century Spain \u27e8saeculum\u27e9 was simply the correct way to spell [sjeglo], meaning 'century'. The writer would not have actually said [s\u025bkulum] any more than a modern English speaker would pronounce \u27e8knight\u27e9 as *[kn\u026axt].<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 44\u201350</ref> \n\n[[Ecclesiastical Latin]], in its spoken form, was created later during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The British scholar [[Alcuin]], tasked by [[Charlemagne]] with improving the standards of Latin writing in France, prescribed a pronunciation based on a fairly literal interpretation of Latin spelling. A word such as \u27e8viridiarium\u27e9 'orchard' now had to be read aloud precisely as it was spelled rather than as [[Old French]] ''vergier.''<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 104\u20137</ref>\n\nThis had the effect of rendering [[Sermon|sermons]] completely unintelligible to the general public, which prompted officials a few years later- at the [[Council of Tours]]- to order them to be rendered ''in rusticam romanam linguam'', 'in plain roman speech', i.e. in Romance.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 118-20</ref> Another issue was that now two types of speech, Romance and Church Latin, had to coexist within one writing system. Within the same century the first attempts were made to devise an orthography specifically for Romance, as can be seen in the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] and the [[Sequence of Saint Eulalia|Canticle of Saint Eulalia]], both written in France. As the Carolingian Reforms spread to other Romance-speaking areas, local scholars devised orthographies for their own varieties of Romance as well.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 122\u201332, 143\u20134</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist-lg}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* {{Cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|date=2014-11-14|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|editor2-last=Schweickard|editor2-first=Wolfgang|editor3-last=Gouvert|editor3-first=Joannes|editor4-last=Kramer|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110313482|journal=Beihefte zur Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=|pages=295|doi=10.1515/9783110313482|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/963581913|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom) 2|date=2016|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2016|isbn=3-11-045361-4|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|location=|pages=|oclc=963581913|editor-last2=Gouvert|editor-first2=Xavier}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Loporcaro|first=Michele|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1107082342|title=Vowel Length From Latin to Romance|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-19-965655-4|location=|pages=25-30|oclc=1107082342}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Steven N.|date=2016-01-01|title=Do Romanists need to reconstruct Proto-Romance?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=132|issue=1|pages=2|doi=10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|issn=1865-9063|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Thaddeus|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110806960|title=A History of the Romance Vowel Systems through Paradigmatic Reconstruction|date=1976-01-31|publisher=De Gruyter|year=|isbn=978-3-11-080696-0|location=Berlin, Boston|pages=78}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Wilkinson, Hugh E.|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1055897845|title=Notes on the development of -KJ-, -TJ- in Spanish and Portuguese|date=1926|publisher=Aoyama Gakuin University|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=11-14|oclc=1055897845}}\n* {{Citation|last=Zampaulo|first=Andr\u00e9|title=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance languages|date=2019-08-22|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198807384.003.0006|work=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance Languages|volume=|pages=150\u2013199|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-880738-4|access-date=2020-04-01}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=De Dardel|first=R.|last2=Gaeng|first2=P.
