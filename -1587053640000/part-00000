The resulting economic impact was minuscule, but the psychological influence on slave holders was immense. Under the original [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1793]], officials from free states were required to assist slaveholders or their agents who recaptured runaway slaves. But, citizens and governments of many free states ignored the law, and the Underground Railroad thrived.\n\nWith heavy lobbying by southern politicians, the [[Compromise of 1850]] was passed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. It stipulated a more stringent [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Law]]; ostensibly, the compromise addressed regional problems by compelling officials of free states to assist slave catchers, granting them immunity to operate in free states.<ref>Potter, David, 1976 pp. 132\u2013139</ref> Because the law required sparse documentation to claim a person was a fugitive, slave catchers also kidnapped [[free negro|free blacks]], especially children, and sold them into slavery.<ref>Bordewich, Fergus, 2005, p. 324</ref> Southern politicians often exaggerated the number of escaped slaves and often blamed these escapes on Northerners interfering with Southern property rights.<ref>{{cite book| last1=Gara| first1=Larry| title=Underground Railroad| publisher=National Park Service| page=8}}</ref> The law deprived suspected slaves of the right to defend themselves in court, making it difficult to prove free status.

The Underground Railroad consisted of meeting points, secret routes, transportation, and [[safe house]]s, all of them maintained by [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist sympathizers]] and communicated by [[word of mouth]]. Participants generally organized in small, independent groups; this helped to maintain secrecy because individuals knew some connecting \"stations\" along the route but knew few details of their{{whose|date=November 2019}} immediate area. Escaped slaves would move north along the route from one way station to the next. \"Conductors\" on the railroad came from various backgrounds and included [[free people of color|free-born blacks]], white abolitionists, former slaves (either escaped or [[manumission|manumitted]]), and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/maps/undergroundrailroad/|title=The Underground Railroad|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2011-11-16|work=National Geographic Society|access-date=August 1, 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Miles|first=Tiya|date=Summer 2011|title=Of Waterways and Runaways: Reflections on the Great Lakes in Underground Railroad History|magazine=Michigan Quarterly Review|volume=L|issue=3|issn=1558-7266|hdl=2027/spo.act2080.0050.320}}</ref> Church clergy and congregations of the North often played a role, especially the [[Religious Society of Friends]] ([[Quakers]]), [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]], [[Wesleyan Church|Wesleyans]], and [[Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America|Reformed Presbyterians]], as well as the anti-slavery branches  of [[Mainline Protestant|mainstream denominations]] which split over the issue, such the [[Methodism|Methodist]] church and the [[American Baptists|Baptists]].

A conductor sometimes pretended to be a slave in order to enter a [[plantations in the American South|plantation]]. Once a part of a plantation, the conductor would direct the runaways to the North. Slaves traveled at night, about {{convert|10|-|20|mi|0}} to each station. They rested, and then a message was sent to the next station to let the station master know the runaways were on their way. They would stop at the so-called \"stations\" or \"depots\" during the day and rest. The stations were often located in barns, under church floors, or in hiding places in caves and hollowed-out riverbanks.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe resting spots where the runaways could sleep and eat were given the code names \"stations\" and \"depots\", which were held by \"station masters\". \"Stockholders\" gave money or supplies for assistance. Using biblical references, fugitives referred to Canada as the \"[[Promised Land]]\" or \"Heaven\" and the [[Ohio River]] as the \"[[Jordan River|River Jordan]]\", which marked the boundary between [[slave states and free states]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Underground Railroad Codes| url=http://www.safepassageohio.org/resources/weblesson.pdf| work=Myths and Codes of the Underground Railroad| series=Safe Passage| publisher=Greater Cincinnati Television Educational Foundation| page=20| accessdate=June 29, 2013}}</ref>\n[[File:Desperate Conflict in a Barn.png|left|thumb|280px|''Struggle for freedom in a Maryland barn''.

Most escapes were by individuals or small groups; occasionally, there were mass escapes, such as with the [[Pearl incident]]. The journey was often considered particularly difficult and dangerous for women or children. Children were sometimes hard to keep quiet or were unable to keep up with a group. In addition, enslaved women were rarely allowed to leave the plantation, making it harder for them to escape in the same ways that men could.<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Blackett| first1=Richard| title=The Underground Railroad and the Struggle Against Slavery| journal=History Workshop Journal| date=October 2014| volume=78| issue=1| page=279| doi=10.1093/hwj/dbu012}}</ref> Although escaping was harder for women, some women were successful.

Southern newspapers of the day were often filled with pages of notices soliciting information about escaped slaves and offering sizable rewards for their capture and return. [[United States Marshals Service#History|Federal marshals]] and professional [[bounty hunter]]s known as [[slave catcher]]s pursued fugitives as far as the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canada\u2013US border]].<ref>Potter, David, 1976, p. 133.</ref>\n\nFugitives were not the only black people at risk from slave catchers. With demand for slaves high in the Deep South as cotton was developed, strong, healthy blacks in their prime working and reproductive years were seen and treated as highly valuable commodities. Both former slaves and free blacks were sometimes kidnapped and sold into slavery, as was [[Solomon Northup]] of [[Saratoga Springs, New York]]. \"Certificates of freedom,\" signed, [[wikt:notarize|notarized]] statements attesting to the free status of individual blacks also known as free papers, could easily be destroyed or stolen, so provided little protection to bearers.\n\nSome buildings, such as the [[Crenshaw House (Gallatin County, Illinois)|Crenshaw House]] in far southeastern [[Illinois]], are known sites where free blacks were sold into slavery, known as the \"[[Reverse Underground Railroad]]\". Under the terms of the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]], when suspected fugitives were seized and brought to a special [[magistrate]] known as a commissioner, they had no right to a jury trial and could not testify in their own behalf. Technically, they were guilty of no crime. The marshal or private slave-catcher needed only to swear an oath to acquire a [[writ]] of ''[[replevin]]'' for the return of property.\n\nCongress was dominated by Southern Congressmen because the population of their states was bolstered by the inclusion of [[Three-Fifths Compromise|three-fifths]] of the number of slaves in population totals. They passed the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850]] because of frustration at having fugitive slaves helped by the public and even official institutions outside the South. In some parts of the North, slave-catchers needed police protection to exercise their federal authority. Opposition to slavery did not mean that all states welcomed free blacks. For instance, [[Indiana]], whose area along the Ohio River was settled by Southerners, passed a constitutional amendment that barred free blacks from settling in that state.\n\n===Terminology===\nMembers of the Underground Railroad often used specific terms, based on the metaphor of the [[railway]].

He kept careful records, including short biographies of the people, that contained frequent railway metaphors. He maintained correspondence with many of them, often acting as a middleman in communications between escaped slaves and those left behind. He later published these accounts in the book ''The Underground Railroad: Authentic Narratives and First-Hand Accounts'' (1872), a valuable resource for historians to understand how the system worked and learn about individual ingenuity in escapes.\n\nAccording to Still, messages were often encoded so that they could be understood only by those active in the railroad. For example, the following message, \"I have sent via at two o'clock four large hams and two small hams\", indicated that four adults and two children were sent by train from [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] to Philadelphia. The additional word ''via'' indicated that the \"passengers\" were not sent on the usual train, but rather via [[Reading, Pennsylvania]]. In this case, the authorities were tricked into going to the regular location (station) in an attempt to intercept the runaways, while Still met them at the correct station and guided them to safety. They eventually escaped either to the North or to Canada, where slavery had been abolished during the 1830s.<ref>{{cite book| author=Still, William| title=The Underground Railroad: Authentic Narratives and First-Hand Accounts| date=1872| url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21243533-the-underground-railroad?from_search=true&search_version=service_impr| asin=B00264GNTU}}</ref>\n\n===National Underground Railroad Network===\n\nFollowing upon legislation passed in 1990, in 1997, Congress passed H.R. 1635, which President [[Bill Clinton]] signed into law, and which authorized the [[United States National Park Service]] to establish the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom program to identify associated sites, as well as preserve them and popularize the Underground Railroad and stories of people involved in it.

Important black settlements also developed in other parts of [[British North America]] (now parts of Canada). These included [[Lower Canada]] (present-day [[Quebec]]) and [[Vancouver Island]], where Governor [[James Douglas (governor)|James Douglas]] encouraged black immigration because of his opposition to slavery. He also hoped a significant black community would form a bulwark against those who wished to unite the island with the United States.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nUpon arriving at their destinations, many fugitives were disappointed, as life in Canada was difficult. While the British colonies had no slavery after 1834, [[racial discrimination|discrimination]] was still common. Many of the new arrivals had to compete with mass European immigration for jobs, and overt racism was common. For example, in reaction to Black Loyalists being settled in eastern Canada by the Crown, the city of [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], amended its charter in 1785 specifically to exclude blacks from practicing a trade, selling goods, fishing in the harbor, or becoming freemen; these provisions stood until 1870.<ref>[http://www.saintjohn.nbcc.nb.ca/~Heritage/Black/Loyalists.htm \"Arrival of the Black Loyalists: Saint John's Black Community\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519034253/http://www.saintjohn.nbcc.nb.ca/~Heritage/Black/Loyalists.htm |date=May 19, 2011 }}, Heritage Resources Saint John</ref>\n\nWith the outbreak of the Civil War in the U.S., many black refugees left Canada to enlist in the [[Union Army]]. While some later returned to Canada, many remained in the United States. Thousands of others returned to the American South after the war ended. The desire to reconnect with friends and family was strong, and most were hopeful about the changes emancipation and [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] would bring.\n\n==Folklore==\n{{Main|Quilts of the Underground Railroad|Songs of the Underground Railroad}}\nSince the 1980s, claims have arisen that [[quilt]] designs were used to signal and direct slaves to escape routes and assistance. According to advocates of the quilt theory, ten quilt patterns were used to direct slaves to take particular actions. The quilts were placed one at a time on a fence as a means of nonverbal communication to alert escaping slaves. The code had a dual meaning: first to signal slaves to prepare to escape, and second to give clues and indicate directions on the journey.<ref>Williams, Ozella McDaniels, 1999.</ref>\n\nThe quilt design theory is disputed. The first published work documenting an [[oral history]] source was in 1999, and the first publication of this theory is believed to be a 1980 [[children's book]].<ref name=SLJ407>{{Cite magazine| last=Aronson| first=Marc| date=April 1, 2007| url=http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6430152.html| title=History That Never Happened| magazine=[[School Library Journal]]| accessdate=March 31, 2011}}</ref> Quilt historians and scholars of pre-Civil War (1820-1860) America have disputed this legend.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stukin|first1=Stacie|title=Unravelling the Myth of Quilts and the Underground Railroad|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1606271,00.html|website=Time.com|publisher=Time|accessdate= January 18, 2017}}</ref> There is no contemporary evidence of any sort of quilt code, and quilt historians such as Pat Cummings and Barbara Brackman have raised serious questions about the idea. In addition, Underground Railroad historian Giles Wright has published a pamphlet debunking the quilt code.\n\nSimilarly, some popular, nonacademic sources claim that spirituals and other songs, such as \"Steal Away\" or \"[[Follow the Drinkin' Gourd|Follow the Drinking Gourd]]\", contained coded information and helped individuals navigate the railroad. They have offered little evidence to support their claims. Scholars tend to believe that while the slave songs may certainly have expressed hope for deliverance from the sorrows of this world, these songs did not present literal help for runaway slaves.<ref name=songstory>{{cite journal| last= Kelley| first= James| title= Song, Story, or History: Resisting Claims of a Coded Message in the African American Spiritual 'Follow the Drinking Gourd{{'-}}| journal=[[The Journal of Popular Culture]]| volume=41| issue=2| date=April 2008 |pages=262\u2013280| doi=10.1111/j.1540-5931.2008.00502.x}}</ref>\n\nThe Underground Railroad inspired cultural works. For example, \"[[Song of the Free]]\", written in 1860 about a man fleeing slavery in [[Tennessee]] by escaping to Canada, was composed to the tune of \"[[Oh! Susanna]]\". Every stanza ends with a reference to Canada as the land \"where colored men are free\".

The resulting economic impact was minuscule, but the psychological influence on slave holders was immense. Under the original [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1793]], officials from free states were required to assist slaveholders or their agents who recaptured runaway slaves. But, citizens and governments of many free states ignored the law, and the Underground Railroad thrived.\n\nWith heavy lobbying by southern politicians, the [[Compromise of 1850]] was passed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. It stipulated a more stringent [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Law]]; ostensibly, the compromise addressed regional problems by compelling officials of free states to assist slave catchers, granting them immunity to operate in free states.<ref>Potter, David, 1976 pp. 132\u2013139</ref> Because the law required sparse documentation to claim a person was a fugitive, slave catchers also kidnapped [[free negro|free blacks]], especially children, and sold them into slavery.<ref>Bordewich, Fergus, 2005, p. 324</ref> Southern politicians often exaggerated the number of escaped slaves and often blamed these escapes on Northerners interfering with Southern property rights.<ref>{{cite book| last1=Gara| first1=Larry| title=Underground Railroad| publisher=National Park Service| page=8}}</ref> The law deprived suspected slaves of the right to defend themselves in court, making it difficult to prove free status.

The Underground Railroad consisted of meeting points, secret routes, transportation, and [[safe house]]s, all of them maintained by [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist sympathizers]] and communicated by [[word of mouth]]. Participants generally organized in small, independent groups; this helped to maintain secrecy because individuals knew some connecting \"stations\" along the route but knew few details of their{{whose|date=November 2019}} immediate area. Escaped slaves would move north along the route from one way station to the next. \"Conductors\" on the railroad came from various backgrounds and included [[free people of color|free-born blacks]], white abolitionists, former slaves (either escaped or [[manumission|manumitted]]), and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/maps/undergroundrailroad/|title=The Underground Railroad|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2011-11-16|work=National Geographic Society|access-date=August 1, 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Miles|first=Tiya|date=Summer 2011|title=Of Waterways and Runaways: Reflections on the Great Lakes in Underground Railroad History|magazine=Michigan Quarterly Review|volume=L|issue=3|issn=1558-7266|hdl=2027/spo.act2080.0050.320}}</ref> Church clergy and congregations of the North often played a role, especially the [[Religious Society of Friends]] ([[Quakers]]), [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]], [[Wesleyan Church|Wesleyans]], and [[Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America|Reformed Presbyterians]], as well as the anti-slavery branches  of [[Mainline Protestant|mainstream denominations]] which split over the issue, such the [[Methodism|Methodist]] church and the [[American Baptists|Baptists]].

A conductor sometimes pretended to be a slave in order to enter a [[plantations in the American South|plantation]]. Once a part of a plantation, the conductor would direct the runaways to the North. Slaves traveled at night, about {{convert|10|-|20|mi|0}} to each station. They rested, and then a message was sent to the next station to let the station master know the runaways were on their way. They would stop at the so-called \"stations\" or \"depots\" during the day and rest. The stations were often located in barns, under church floors, or in hiding places in caves and hollowed-out riverbanks.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe resting spots where the runaways could sleep and eat were given the code names \"stations\" and \"depots\", which were held by \"station masters\". \"Stockholders\" gave money or supplies for assistance. Using biblical references, fugitives referred to Canada as the \"[[Promised Land]]\" or \"Heaven\" and the [[Ohio River]] as the \"[[Jordan River|River Jordan]]\", which marked the boundary between [[slave states and free states]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Underground Railroad Codes| url=http://www.safepassageohio.org/resources/weblesson.pdf| work=Myths and Codes of the Underground Railroad| series=Safe Passage| publisher=Greater Cincinnati Television Educational Foundation| page=20| accessdate=June 29, 2013}}</ref>\n[[File:Desperate Conflict in a Barn.png|left|thumb|280px|''Struggle for freedom in a Maryland barn''.

Most escapes were by individuals or small groups; occasionally, there were mass escapes, such as with the [[Pearl incident]]. The journey was often considered particularly difficult and dangerous for women or children. Children were sometimes hard to keep quiet or were unable to keep up with a group. In addition, enslaved women were rarely allowed to leave the plantation, making it harder for them to escape in the same ways that men could.<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Blackett| first1=Richard| title=The Underground Railroad and the Struggle Against Slavery| journal=History Workshop Journal| date=October 2014| volume=78| issue=1| page=279| doi=10.1093/hwj/dbu012}}</ref> Although escaping was harder for women, some women were successful.

Southern newspapers of the day were often filled with pages of notices soliciting information about escaped slaves and offering sizable rewards for their capture and return. [[United States Marshals Service#History|Federal marshals]] and professional [[bounty hunter]]s known as [[slave catcher]]s pursued fugitives as far as the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canada\u2013US border]].<ref>Potter, David, 1976, p. 133.</ref>\n\nFugitives were not the only black people at risk from slave catchers. With demand for slaves high in the Deep South as cotton was developed, strong, healthy blacks in their prime working and reproductive years were seen and treated as highly valuable commodities. Both former slaves and free blacks were sometimes kidnapped and sold into slavery, as was [[Solomon Northup]] of [[Saratoga Springs, New York]]. \"Certificates of freedom,\" signed, [[wikt:notarize|notarized]] statements attesting to the free status of individual blacks also known as free papers, could easily be destroyed or stolen, so provided little protection to bearers.\n\nSome buildings, such as the [[Crenshaw House (Gallatin County, Illinois)|Crenshaw House]] in far southeastern [[Illinois]], are known sites where free blacks were sold into slavery, known as the \"[[Reverse Underground Railroad]]\". Under the terms of the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]], when suspected fugitives were seized and brought to a special [[magistrate]] known as a commissioner, they had no right to a jury trial and could not testify in their own behalf. Technically, they were guilty of no crime. The marshal or private slave-catcher needed only to swear an oath to acquire a [[writ]] of ''[[replevin]]'' for the return of property.\n\nCongress was dominated by Southern Congressmen because the population of their states was bolstered by the inclusion of [[Three-Fifths Compromise|three-fifths]] of the number of slaves in population totals. They passed the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850]] because of frustration at having fugitive slaves helped by the public and even official institutions outside the South. In some parts of the North, slave-catchers needed police protection to exercise their federal authority. Opposition to slavery did not mean that all states welcomed free blacks. For instance, [[Indiana]], whose area along the Ohio River was settled by Southerners, passed a constitutional amendment that barred free blacks from settling in that state.\n\n===Terminology===\nMembers of the Underground Railroad often used specific terms, based on the metaphor of the [[railway]]. For example:\n{{Div col}}\n* People who helped slaves find the railroad were \"agents\" (or \"shepherds\")\n* Guides were known as \"conductors\"\n* Hiding places were \"stations\" or \"way stations\"\n* \"Station masters\" hid slaves in their homes\n* Escaped slaves were referred to as \"passengers\" or \"cargo\"\n* Slaves would obtain a \"ticket\"\n* Similar to common [[gospel]] lore, the \"wheels would keep on turning\"\n* Financial benefactors of the Railroad were known as \"stockholders\"<ref>Blight, David, 2004, p. 98</ref>\n{{colend|2}}\n\nThe [[Big Dipper#Guidepost|Big Dipper]] (whose \"bowl\" points to the [[North Star]]) was known as the [[Follow the Drinkin' Gourd|drinkin' gourd]]. The Railroad was often known as the \"freedom train\" or \"Gospel train\", which headed towards \"Heaven\" or \"the Promised Land\", i.e., Canada.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://freedomcenter.org/enabling-freedom/history| title=History \u2013 National Underground Railroad Freedom Center| website=Freedomcenter.org| accessdate=2016-06-07}}</ref>\n\n[[William Still]],<ref>Blight, David, 2004, p. 175</ref> sometimes called \"The Father of the Underground Railroad\", helped hundreds of slaves to escape (as many as 60 a month), sometimes hiding them in his [[Philadelphia]] home. He kept careful records, including short biographies of the people, that contained frequent railway metaphors. He maintained correspondence with many of them, often acting as a middleman in communications between escaped slaves and those left behind. He later published these accounts in the book ''The Underground Railroad: Authentic Narratives and First-Hand Accounts'' (1872), a valuable resource for historians to understand how the system worked and learn about individual ingenuity in escapes.\n\nAccording to Still, messages were often encoded so that they could be understood only by those active in the railroad. For example, the following message, \"I have sent via at two o'clock four large hams and two small hams\", indicated that four adults and two children were sent by train from [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] to Philadelphia. The additional word ''via'' indicated that the \"passengers\" were not sent on the usual train, but rather via [[Reading, Pennsylvania]]. In this case, the authorities were tricked into going to the regular location (station) in an attempt to intercept the runaways, while Still met them at the correct station and guided them to safety. They eventually escaped either to the North or to Canada, where slavery had been abolished during the 1830s.<ref>{{cite book| author=Still, William| title=The Underground Railroad: Authentic Narratives and First-Hand Accounts| date=1872| url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21243533-the-underground-railroad?from_search=true&search_version=service_impr| asin=B00264GNTU}}</ref>\n\n===National Underground Railroad Network===\n\nFollowing upon legislation passed in 1990, in 1997, Congress passed H.R. 1635, which President [[Bill Clinton]] signed into law, and which authorized the [[United States National Park Service]] to establish the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom program to identify associated sites, as well as preserve them and popularize the Underground Railroad and stories of people involved in it.

Important black settlements also developed in other parts of [[British North America]] (now parts of Canada). These included [[Lower Canada]] (present-day [[Quebec]]) and [[Vancouver Island]], where Governor [[James Douglas (governor)|James Douglas]] encouraged black immigration because of his opposition to slavery. He also hoped a significant black community would form a bulwark against those who wished to unite the island with the United States.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nUpon arriving at their destinations, many fugitives were disappointed, as life in Canada was difficult. While the British colonies had no slavery after 1834, [[racial discrimination|discrimination]] was still common. Many of the new arrivals had to compete with mass European immigration for jobs, and overt racism was common. For example, in reaction to Black Loyalists being settled in eastern Canada by the Crown, the city of [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], amended its charter in 1785 specifically to exclude blacks from practicing a trade, selling goods, fishing in the harbor, or becoming freemen; these provisions stood until 1870.<ref>[http://www.saintjohn.nbcc.nb.ca/~Heritage/Black/Loyalists.htm \"Arrival of the Black Loyalists: Saint John's Black Community\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519034253/http://www.saintjohn.nbcc.nb.ca/~Heritage/Black/Loyalists.htm |date=May 19, 2011 }}, Heritage Resources Saint John</ref>\n\nWith the outbreak of the Civil War in the U.S., many black refugees left Canada to enlist in the [[Union Army]]. While some later returned to Canada, many remained in the United States. Thousands of others returned to the American South after the war ended. The desire to reconnect with friends and family was strong, and most were hopeful about the changes emancipation and [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] would bring.\n\n==Folklore==\n{{Main|Quilts of the Underground Railroad|Songs of the Underground Railroad}}\nSince the 1980s, claims have arisen that [[quilt]] designs were used to signal and direct slaves to escape routes and assistance. According to advocates of the quilt theory, ten quilt patterns were used to direct slaves to take particular actions. The quilts were placed one at a time on a fence as a means of nonverbal communication to alert escaping slaves. The code had a dual meaning: first to signal slaves to prepare to escape, and second to give clues and indicate directions on the journey.<ref>Williams, Ozella McDaniels, 1999.</ref>\n\nThe quilt design theory is disputed. The first published work documenting an [[oral history]] source was in 1999, and the first publication of this theory is believed to be a 1980 [[children's book]].<ref name=SLJ407>{{Cite magazine| last=Aronson| first=Marc| date=April 1, 2007| url=http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6430152.html| title=History That Never Happened| magazine=[[School Library Journal]]| accessdate=March 31, 2011}}</ref> Quilt historians and scholars of pre-Civil War (1820-1860) America have disputed this legend.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stukin|first1=Stacie|title=Unravelling the Myth of Quilts and the Underground Railroad|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1606271,00.html|website=Time.com|publisher=Time|accessdate= January 18, 2017}}</ref> There is no contemporary evidence of any sort of quilt code, and quilt historians such as Pat Cummings and Barbara Brackman have raised serious questions about the idea. In addition, Underground Railroad historian Giles Wright has published a pamphlet debunking the quilt code.\n\nSimilarly, some popular, nonacademic sources claim that spirituals and other songs, such as \"Steal Away\" or \"[[Follow the Drinkin' Gourd|Follow the Drinking Gourd]]\", contained coded information and helped individuals navigate the railroad. They have offered little evidence to support their claims. Scholars tend to believe that while the slave songs may certainly have expressed hope for deliverance from the sorrows of this world, these songs did not present literal help for runaway slaves.<ref name=songstory>{{cite journal| last= Kelley| first= James| title= Song, Story, or History: Resisting Claims of a Coded Message in the African American Spiritual 'Follow the Drinking Gourd{{'-}}| journal=[[The Journal of Popular Culture]]| volume=41| issue=2| date=April 2008 |pages=262\u2013280| doi=10.1111/j.1540-5931.2008.00502.x}}</ref>\n\nThe Underground Railroad inspired cultural works. For example, \"[[Song of the Free]]\", written in 1860 about a man fleeing slavery in [[Tennessee]] by escaping to Canada, was composed to the tune of \"[[Oh! Susanna]]\". Every stanza ends with a reference to Canada as the land \"where colored men are free\". Slavery in [[Upper Canada]] (now Ontario) was outlawed in 1793; in 1819, [[Sir John Robinson, 1st Baronet, of Toronto|John Robinson]], the Attorney General of Upper Canada, declared that by residing in Canada, black residents were set free, and that Canadian courts would<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.archives.gov.on.ca/en/explore/online/alvin_mccurdy/settlement.aspx| title=Black History-From Slavery to Settlement| website=Archives.gov.on.ca| accessdate=June 7, 2016| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130214020850/http://www.archives.gov.on.ca/en/explore/online/alvin_mccurdy/settlement.aspx| archivedate=February 14, 2013| df=mdy-all}}</ref> protect their freedom.

Watterson was warned by the syndicate not to give up the day job yet, but it was not long before the series had become a hit. Within a year of [[print syndication|syndication]], the strip was published in roughly 250 newspapers and was proving to have international appeal with translation and [[Calvin and Hobbes in translation|wide circulation]] outside the United States.\n\nAlthough ''Calvin and Hobbes'' would undergo continual artistic development and creative innovation over the period of syndication, the earliest strips demonstrate a remarkable consistency with the latest. Watterson introduced all the major characters within the first three weeks, and made no changes to the central cast over the 10 years of the strip's history.\n\nBy April 5, 1987, Watterson was featured in an article in ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]''.<ref name=\"simple\" /> ''Calvin and Hobbes'' earned Watterson the Reuben Award from the [[National Cartoonists Society]] in the Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year category, first in 1986 and again in 1988.

By 1991, Watterson had achieved his goal of securing a new contract that granted him legal control over his creation and all future licensing arrangements.\n\n=== Creative control (1991\u20131995) ===\nHaving achieved his objective of creative control, Watterson's desire for privacy subsequently reasserted itself and he ceased all media interviews, relocated to [[New Mexico]], and largely disappeared from public engagements, refusing to attend the ceremonies of any of the cartooning awards he won.<ref name=\":1\" /> The pressures of the battle over merchandising led to Watterson taking an extended break from May 5, 1991, to February 1, 1992, a move that was virtually unprecedented in the world of syndicated cartoonists.\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| header = Comparison of Calvin and Hobbes' following layout changes\n| direction = \n| width = 260\n| image1 = Calvin and Hobbes 6 Sep 1987.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Calvin and Hobbes 26 Sep 1993.jpg\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = The comic strip on the left from 1987 illustrates the layout constraints that Bill Watterson was required to work within for the first 6 years of the comic's syndication.

Few editors approved of the move, but the strip was so popular that they had no choice but to continue to run it for fear that competing newspapers might pick it up and draw its fans away.<ref name=\"astor1991\">{{cite journal |last=Astor |first=David |title=Nine-month Vacation for Bill Watterson |page=34 |journal=[[Editor & Publisher]] |publisher=Duncan McIntosh |location=Irvine, California |date=1991-03-30}}</ref> Watterson returned to the strip in 1992 with plans to produce his Sunday strip as an unbreakable half of a newspaper or [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] page. This made him only the second cartoonist since [[Garry Trudeau]] to have sufficient popularity to demand more space and control over the presentation of his work.\n\nWatterson took a second sabbatical from April 3 through December 31, 1994. When he returned, he had made the decision to end the strip. In 1995, Watterson sent a letter via his syndicate to all editors whose newspapers carried his strip announcing his plans to end the strip by the end of the year. Stating his belief that he had achieved everything that he wanted to within the medium, he announced his intention to work on future projects at a slower pace with fewer artistic compromises.\n\nThe final strip ran on Sunday, December 31, 1995.<ref name=\"pr_calvin\">{{cite web |url=http://www.andrewsmcmeel.com/calvinandhobbes/pr_calvin.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051026183516/http://www.andrewsmcmeel.com/calvinandhobbes/pr_calvin.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2005-10-26 |accessdate=2009-05-02 |title=The Complete Calvin and Hobbes |publisher=[[Andrews & McMeel]]}}</ref> It depicted Calvin and Hobbes outside in freshly fallen snow, reveling in the wonder and excitement of the winter scene. \"It's a magical world, Hobbes, ol' buddy...

This larger format version of the strip was constrained by mandatory layout requirements that made it possible for newspaper editors to format the strip for different page sizes and layouts.\n\nWatterson grew increasingly frustrated by the shrinking of the available space for comics in the newspapers and the mandatory panel divisions that restricted his ability to produce better artwork and more creative storytelling. He lamented that without space for anything more than simple dialogue or sparse artwork, comics as an art form were becoming dilute, bland, and unoriginal.<ref name=\"west1989\">{{cite web|url=http://ignatz.brinkster.net/ccomicsjournal.html|title=Interview: Bill Watterson|last=West|first=Richard Samuel|date=February 1989|work=[[The Comics Journal]] / [[Fantagraphics]] via Calvin and Hobbies: Magic on Paper (fan site)|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714012735/http://ignatz.brinkster.net/ccomicsjournal.html|archivedate=July 14, 2011|url-status=dead|accessdate=August 30, 2012|issue=127|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"astor1988\">{{cite journal |title=Watterson Knocks the Shrinking of Comics |first=David |last=Astor |journal=[[Editor & Publisher]] |publisher=Duncan McIntosh |location=Irvine, California |date=1988-12-03 |page=40}}</ref>\n\nWatterson longed for the artistic freedom allotted to classic strips such as ''[[Little Nemo]]'' and ''[[Krazy Kat]]'', and in 1989 he gave a sample of what could be accomplished with such liberty in the opening pages of the Sunday strip compilation, ''The Calvin and Hobbes Lazy Sunday Book\u2014''an 8-page previously unpublished Calvin story fully illustrated in watercolour.

Following his 1991 sabbatical, Universal Press announced that Watterson had decided to sell his Sunday strip as an unbreakable half of a newspaper or [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] page. Many editors and even a few cartoonists including [[Bil Keane]] (''[[The Family Circus]]'') and [[Bruce Beattie]] ([[Snafu Comics|''Snafu'']]) criticized him for what they perceived as arrogance and an unwillingness to abide by the normal practices of the cartoon business.<ref name=\"astor1992\">{{cite journal|last=Astor|first=David|date=1992-03-07|title=Cartoonists discuss 'Calvin' requirement|url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/article_brief/eandp/1/1165165|url-status=dead|journal=[[Editor & Publisher]]|location=Irvine, California|publisher=Duncan McIntosh|page=34|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320192434/http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/article_brief/eandp/1/1165165|archivedate=2007-03-20|accessdate=2007-01-19}}</ref> Others, including [[Bill Amend]] ([[FoxTrot|''Foxtrot'']]), Johnny Hart ([[B.C.

The first took place from May 5, 1991 to February 1, 1992, and second from April 3 through December 31, 1994. These sabbaticals were included in the new contract Watterson managed to negotiate with Universal Features in 1990. The sabbaticals were proposed by the syndicate themselves who, fearing Watterson's complete burnout, endeavoured to get another five years of work from their star artist.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWatterson remains only the third cartoonist with sufficient popularity and stature to receive a sabbatical from their syndicate, the first being [[Garry Trudeau]] (''[[Doonesbury]]'') in 1983 and [[Gary Larson]] (''[[The Far Side]]'') in 1989.<ref name=\":3\" /> Typically cartoonists are expected to produce sufficient strips to cover any period they may wish to take off. Watterson's lengthy sabbaticals received some mild criticism from his fellow cartoonists including [[Greg Evans (cartoonist)|Greg Evans]] ([[Luann (comic strip)|''Luann'']]), and [[Charles M. Schulz|Charles Schulz]] (''[[Peanuts]]''), one of Watterson's major artistic influences, even called it a \"puzzle\". Some cartoonists resented the idea that Watterson worked harder than others, whilst others supported it. At least one newspaper editor noted that the strip was the most popular in the country, and that he had \"earned it\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://timhulsizer.com/cwords/cmixedresponse.html|title=Mixed Response To Second Sabbatical|last=|first=|date=26 March 1994|work=Editor & Publisher|access-date=19 September 2018|issue=13|volume=127|page=30}}</ref> Following his second sabbatical, Watterson made the decision that he was going to retire from the comic strip entirely.\n\n==Merchandising==\nIn spite of ''Calvin and Hobbes''' popularity, the strip remains notable for the relative lack of official product merchandising. Bill Watterson held that comic strips should stand on their own as an art form and although he did not start out completely opposed to merchandising in all forms (or even for all comic strips), he did reject an early syndication deal that involved incorporating a more marketable, licensed character into his strip.<ref name=\"christie1987\" /> In spite of being an unproven cartoonist, and having been flown all the way to New York to discuss the proposal, Watterson reflexively resented the idea of \"cartooning by committee\" and turned it down.\n\nLater, when ''Calvin'' was accepted by Universal Syndicate, and began to grow in popularity, Watterson found himself at odds with the syndicate, which urged him to begin merchandising the characters and touring the country to promote the first collections of comic strips. Watterson refused. To him, the integrity of the strip and its artist would be undermined by [[commercialization]], which he saw as a major negative influence in the world of cartoon art<ref name=\"west1989\" /> and he came to believe that licensing his character would only violate the spirit of his work.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book|last=Watterson|first=Bill|publisher=Andrews and McMeel|year=1995|isbn=0836204387|location=Kansas City|pages=10\u201311}}</ref> He gave an example of this in discussing his opposition to a Hobbes plush toy: that if the essence of Hobbes' nature in the strip is that it remain unresolved whether he is a real tiger or a stuffed toy, then creating a real stuffed toy would only destroy the magic. However, having initially signed away control over merchandising in his initial contract with the syndicate,<ref name=\":1\" /> Watterson would commence a lengthy and emotionally draining battle with Universal to gain control over his work.

In a 1989 interview in ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' he described the appeal of being able to do things with a moving image that can't be done by a simple drawing: the distortion, the exaggeration and the control over the length of time an event is viewed.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} However, although the visual possibilities of animation appealed to Watterson, the idea of finding a voice for Calvin made him uncomfortable, as did the idea of working with a team of animators.<ref name=\"west1989\" /> Ultimately, ''Calvin and Hobbes'' was never made into an [[animated cartoon|animated series]]. Watterson later stated in ''The Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book'' that he liked the fact that his strip was a \"low-tech, one-man operation,\" and that he took great pride in the fact that he drew every line and wrote every word on his own.<ref>[[Calvin and Hobbes#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]]. p. 11.</ref> Calls from major Hollywood figures interested in an adaptation of his work, including [[Jim Henson]], [[George Lucas]] and [[Steven Spielberg]] were never returned<ref name=\":1\" /> and in a 2013 interview Watterson stated that he had \"zero interest\" in an animated adaptation as there was really no upside for him in doing so.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Style and influences==\nThe strip borrows several elements and themes from three major influences: [[Walt Kelly]]'s ''[[Pogo (comic strip)|Pogo]]'', [[George Herriman]]'s ''[[Krazy Kat]]'' and [[Charles M. Schulz]]'s ''[[Peanuts]]''.<ref name=\"Watterson 1995 p. 21\">{{harvp|Watterson|1995|p=21}}</ref> Schulz and Kelly particularly influenced Watterson's outlook on comics during his formative years.<ref name=\"christie1987\" />\n\nNotable elements of Watterson's artistic style are his characters' diverse and often exaggerated expressions (particularly those of Calvin), elaborate and bizarre backgrounds for Calvin's flights of imagination, expressions of motion and frequent visual jokes and metaphors. In the later years of the strip, with more panel space available for his use, Watterson experimented more freely with different panel layouts, art styles, stories without dialogue and greater use of [[White space (visual arts)|white space]]. He also makes a point of not showing certain things explicitly: the \"Noodle Incident\" and the [[Children's literature|children's book]] ''Hamster Huey and the Gooey Kablooie'' are left to the reader's imagination, where Watterson was sure they would be \"more outrageous\" than he could portray.<ref>{{harvp|Watterson|1995|p=200}}</ref> However, since then, ''Hamster Huey and the Gooey Kablooie'' has been written completely in the real world.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hamster Huey and the Gooey Kablooie: The Renowned Hero's Most Famous Adventure |isbn=9780974909004|last1=Barr|first1=Mabel|date=December 2004}}</ref>\n\n== Production and technique ==\nWatterson's technique started with minimalist [[Sketch (drawing)|pencil sketches]] drawn with a [[light pencil]] (though the larger Sunday strips often required more elaborate work) on a piece of [[Bristol board]], with his brand of choice being Strathmore because he felt it held the drawings better on the page as opposed to the cheaper brands (Watterson said he would use any cheap pad of Bristol board his local supply store had, but switched to Strathmore after he found himself growing more and more displeased with the results). He would then use a small [[Kolinsky sable-hair brush|sable]] brush and [[India ink]] to fill in the rest of the drawing, saying that he did not want to simply trace over his penciling and thus make the inking more spontaneous. He lettered dialogue with a [[Rotring|Rapidograph]] [[fountain pen]], and he used a [[quill|crowquill]] pen for odds and ends.<ref name=\"Watterson 1995 p. 20\">[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]]. p. 20.</ref> Mistakes were covered with various forms of [[correction fluid]], including the type used on typewriters. Watterson was careful in his use of color, often spending a great deal of time in choosing the right colors to employ for the weekly Sunday strip; his technique was to cut the color tabs the syndicate sent him into individual squares, lay out the colors, and then paint a watercolor approximation of the strip on tracing paper over the Bristol board and then mark the strip accordingly before sending it on.<ref name=\"Watterson 2001\">[[#CITEREFWatterson2001|Watterson (2001)]].</ref> When ''Calvin and Hobbes'' began there were 64 colors available for the Sunday strips. For the later Sunday strips Watterson had 125 colors as well as the ability to fade the colors into each other.<ref name=\"Watterson 1995 p. 20\"/>\n\n==Main characters==\n===Calvin===\n{{Infobox character\n| name             = Calvin\n| series           = <!-- use without the italic on the outside -->\n| image            = Calvin,_of_Calvin_and_Hobbes.png\n| image_size       =140px \n| alt              = \n| caption          = \n| first            = November 18, 1985\n| last             = December 31, 1995\n| creator          = [[Bill Watterson]]\n| lbl1             = Comic\n| data1            = ''Calvin and Hobbes''\n| lbl21            = Age\n| data21           = 6}}\nCalvin, named after the 16th-century theologian [[John Calvin]], is a six-year-old boy with spiky [[blond]] hair and a distinctive red-and-black striped shirt, black pants and sneakers.<ref name=\"Watterson 1995 p. 21\" /> Despite his poor grades in school, Calvin demonstrates his intelligence through a sophisticated vocabulary, philosophical mind and creative/artistic talent.

When the scene includes any other human, presumably they see merely a stuffed animal, usually seated at an off-kilter angle and blankly staring into space. The true nature of the character is never resolved, instead as Watterson describes, a 'grown-up' version of reality is juxtaposed against Calvin's, with the reader left to \"decide which is truer\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Looking for Calvin and Hobbes : the unconventional story of Bill Watterson and his revolutionary comic strip|last=Nevin.|first=Martell|date=2009|publisher=Continuum|isbn=9781441193667|location=New York|oclc=682891953}}</ref>  Hobbes is based off a grey tabby cat named Sprite that was owned by Waterson.

She also plays imaginary games with Calvin in which she acts as a high-powered lawyer or politician and wants Calvin to pretend to be her [[Stay-at-home dad|househusband]]. Though both of them are typically loath to admit it, Calvin and Susie exhibit many common traits and inclinations. For example, the reader occasionally sees Susie with a stuffed rabbit named \"[[Secondary characters in Calvin and Hobbes#Mr. Bun|Mr. Bun]].\" Much like Calvin, Susie has a mischievous (and sometimes aggressive) streak as well, which the reader witnesses whenever she subverts Calvin's attempts to cheat on school tests by feeding him incorrect answers, or whenever she fights back after Calvin attacks her with snowballs or water balloons.\n\nHobbes often openly expresses romantic feelings for Susie, to Calvin's disgust. In contrast, Calvin started a club (of which he an\n\nd Hobbes are the only members) that he calls G.R.O.S.S. ('''G'''et '''R'''id '''O'''f '''S'''limy Girl'''S'''), and while holding \"meetings\" in Calvin's [[tree house]] or in the \"box of secrecy\" in Calvin's room, they usually come up with some plot against Susie. In one instance, Calvin steals one of Susie's dolls and holds it for ransom, only to have Susie retaliate by nabbing Hobbes. Watterson admits that Calvin and Susie have a nascent crush on each other and that Susie is a reference to the type of woman whom Watterson himself found attractive and eventually married.<ref name=\"Watterson 1995\" /> \n{{-}}\n\n===Rosalyn===\n{{See also|Secondary characters in Calvin and Hobbes}}{{Infobox character\n| name               = Rosalyn\n| first_date         = May 15, 1986\n| last_date          = September 16, 1995\n| creator            = Bill Watterson\n| caption            = Calvin's babysitter\n}}\nCalvin also interacts with a handful of secondary characters. Rosalyn is Calvin's babysitter, as it is mentioned that no other person would babysit him. She is, in Calvin's eyes, particularly cruel, normally sending them to bed at 6:30.

She is an evil being that is designed to make Calvin's life miserable, if one asked Calvin. Calvin occasionally makes a speech directed at her. One fan favorite read,\" If ignorance is bliss, this lesson would appear to be a deliberate attempt on your part to deprive me of happiness, the pursuit of which is my unalienable right according to The Declaration of Independence. I therefore assert my patriotic prerogative not to know this material. I'll be out on the playground,\". These speeches, along with frequent attempts to escape, drive Mrs. Wormwood to substances.\n\n==Recurring elements and themes==\n===Art and academia===\nWatterson used the strip to poke fun at the art world, principally through Calvin's unconventional creations of [[snowman|snowmen]] but also through other expressions of childhood art. When Miss Wormwood complains that he is wasting class time drawing impossible things (a ''[[Stegosaurus]]'' in a rocket ship, for example), Calvin proclaims himself \"on the cutting edge of the ''[[avant-garde]]''.\"<ref>{{Cite comic|cartoonist=Bill Watterson|title=Calvin and Hobbes|date=October 31, 1990|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|cartoonist=Bill Watterson|title=Calvin and Hobbes|date=November 1, 1990|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=November 01, 1990 |url=https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1990/11/01 |website=GoComics |language=en |date=1 November 1990}}</ref> He begins exploring the medium of snow when a warm day melts his snowman.

Three of his [[alter ego]]s are well-defined and recurrent:\n{{main|Spaceman Spiff}}\n*{{anchor|Spaceman Spiff}}\"'''Spaceman Spiff'''\" is a heroic spacefarer who narrates his adventures in the [[Third-person pronoun|third person]]. As Spiff, Calvin battles aliens (typically his parents or teacher, but also sometimes other kids his age) with a ray gun known as a \"zorcher\" (later \"frap-ray blaster\", \"death ray blaster\" or \"atomic napalm neutralizer\") and travels to distant planets (his house, school or neighborhood), often crashing unhurt on a planet. Calvin's self-narration as Spaceman Spiff is frequently riddled with alliteration: \"Zounds! Zorched by Zarches, Spaceman Spiff's crippled craft crashes on planet Plootarg!\"  Watterson has stated the idea of Spaceman Spiff was from an earlier attempt as a cartoon.\n* \"'''Tracer Bullet'''\" is a [[hardboiled]] private eye, who says he has eight slugs in him (\"One's lead, and the rest are bourbon.\"). In one story, Bullet is called to a case in which a \"pushy dame\" (Calvin's mother) accuses him of destroying an expensive lamp (broken during an indoor football game between Calvin and Hobbes). Later, he is snatched by the pushy dame's \"hired goon\" (Calvin's father having a talk with him). He made his debut when Calvin donned a [[fedora]] in order to hide a terrible haircut Hobbes had given him. These strips are drawn in elaborate, shadowy black-and-white that evoke [[film noir]]. Watterson did not attempt Tracer Bullet stories often, due to the time-consuming way the strip needed to be drawn and inked.<ref>[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]]. p. 132.</ref>\n{{anchor|Stupendous Man}}\n* \"'''Stupendous Man'''\" is a superhero wearing a mask and a cape (made by Calvin's mother), and also narrating his own adventures. While Calvin is in character as Stupendous Man, he refers to his alter ego as a mild-mannered millionaire playboy. Stupendous Man almost always \"suffers defeat\" at the hands of his opponent. When Hobbes asks if Stupendous Man has ever won any battles, Calvin says all his battles are \"moral victories.\" Stupendous Man's nemeses include \"Mom-Lady\" (Calvin's mom), \"Annoying Girl\" (Susie Derkins), \"Crab Teacher\" (Miss Wormwood) and \"Baby-Sitter Girl\" (Rosalyn). Some of the \"super powers\" of the villains have been revealed: Mom-Lady has a \"mind scrambling eyeball ray\" that wills the victim to \"do her nefarious bidding\"; and Baby Sitter Girl has a similar power of using a \"psycho beam\" which weakens \"Stupendous Man's stupendous will\". The \"powers\" of Annoying Girl and Crab Teacher are never revealed. Calvin often tries to pretend he and \"Stupendous Man\" are two different people, but it fails to work. Stupendous Man has multiple \"superpowers\", including, but not limited to, super strength, the ability to fly, various vision powers such as \"high-speed vision\", \"muscles of magnitude\" and a stomach of steel.\n\n====Cardboard boxes====\n[[File:Scientific Progress Goes Boink (Calvin and Hobbes).jpg|thumb|Calvin duplicating himself using a cardboard box, as seen on the cover of ''Scientific Progress Goes \"Boink\"'']]\nCalvin also has several adventures involving corrugated [[cardboard box]]es, which he adapts for many imaginative and elaborate uses. In one strip, when Calvin shows off his [[Transmogrify|Transmogrifier]], a device that transforms its user into any desired creature or item, Hobbes remarks, \"It's amazing what they do with corrugated cardboard these days.\"<ref name=\"watterson1988_p229\">{{cite book |last=Watterson |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill Watterson |title=The Essential Calvin and Hobbes: A Calvin and Hobbes Treasury |year=1988 |publisher=Andrews and McMeel |location=Kansas City, Missouri |isbn=0-8362-1805-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/essentialcalvinh00watt_1/page/229 229] |title-link=List of Calvin and Hobbes books }}</ref> Calvin is able to change the function of the boxes by rewriting the label and flipping the box onto another side. In this way, a box can be used not only for its conventional purposes (a storage container for water balloons, for example), but also as a flying [[Time travel|time machine]], a duplicator or, with the attachment of a few wires and a colander, a \"Cerebral Enhance-o-tron.\"\n\nIn the real world, Calvin's antics with his box have had varying effects. When he transmogrified into a tiger, he still appeared as a regular human child to his parents. However, in a story where he made several duplicates of himself, his parents are seen interacting with what does seem like multiple Calvins, including in a strip where two of him are seen in the same panel as his father. It is ultimately unknown what his parents do or do not see, as Calvin tries to hide most of his creations (or conceal their effects) so as not to traumatize them.\n\nIn addition, Calvin uses a cardboard box as a sidewalk kiosk to sell things. Often, Calvin offers merchandise no one would want, such as \"suicide drink\", \"a swift kick in the butt\" for one dollar<ref>[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]]. p. 172.</ref> or a \"frank appraisal of your looks\" for fifty cents. In one strip, he sells \"happiness\" for ten cents,  hitting the customer in the face with a water balloon and explaining that he meant his own happiness. In another strip, he sold \"insurance\", [[Protection racket|firing a slingshot at those who refused to buy it]]. In some strips, he tried to sell \"great ideas\", and in one earlier strip, he attempted to sell the family car to obtain money for a grenade launcher. In yet another strip, he sells \"life\" for five cents, where the customer receives nothing in return, which, in Calvin's opinion, is life.\n\nThe box has also functioned as an alternate secret meeting place for G.R.O.S.S., as the \"Box of Secrecy\".\n[[File:Calvin and Hobbes playing Calvinball.jpg|thumb|296x296px|Calvin and Hobbes playing Calvinball with an assortment of sporting equipment.]]\n\n====Calvinball====\n<!-- Courtesy note per [[WP:LiNK2SECT]]: [[Calvinball]] redirects here -->\n{{quote box\n| align = right\n| width = 25em\n| quote = <poem>\nOther kids' games are all such a bore!\nThey've gotta have rules and they gotta keep score!\nCalvinball is better by far!\nIt's never the same!

Calvinball is a [[nomic]] or self-modifying game, a contest of wits, skill and creativity rather than stamina or athletic skill. The game is portrayed as a rebellion against conventional team sports<ref name=\"CC+H_b2_p268-273\">[[Calvin and Hobbes#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]]. vol. 2, pp. 268\u2013273. Comics originally published 1990-04-16 to 1990-05-05.</ref> and became a staple of the final 5 years of the comic. The only consistent rules of the game are that Calvinball may never be played with the same rules twice<ref>[[Calvin and Hobbes#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]]. vol. 2, p. 292. Comic originally published 1990-05-27.</ref> and that each participant must wear a mask.<ref name=\"CC+H_b3_p430-433\">[[Calvin and Hobbes#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]]. vol. 3, pp. 430\u2013434.

Scoring is portrayed as arbitrary and nonsensical (\"Q to 12\" and \"oogy to boogy\"<ref>[[Calvin and Hobbes#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]]. vol. 2, pp. 292, 336.

He uses the snowman for social commentary, revenge or pure enjoyment. Examples include Snowman Calvin being yelled at by Snowman Dad to shovel the snow; one snowman eating [[snow cone]]s scooped out of a second snowman, who is lying on the ground with an ice-cream scoop in his back; a \"snowman house of horror\"; and snowmen representing people he hates. \"The ones I ''really'' hate are small, so they'll melt faster,\" he says. There was even an occasion on which Calvin accidentally brought a snowman to life and it made itself and a small army into \"deranged mutant killer monster snow goons.\"\n\nCalvin's snow art is often used as a commentary on art in general. For example, Calvin has complained more than once about the lack of originality in other people's snow art and compared it with his own grotesque snow sculptures. In one of these instances, Calvin and Hobbes claim to be the sole guardians of high culture; in another, Hobbes admires Calvin's willingness to put artistic integrity above marketability, causing Calvin to reconsider and make an ordinary snowman.\n\n====Wagon and sled rides====\nCalvin and Hobbes frequently ride downhill in a [[wagon]] or [[sled]] (depending on the season), as a device to add some [[physical comedy]] to the strip and because, according to Watterson, \"it's a lot more interesting ... than talking heads.\"<ref name=\"Watterson 1995 p. 104\">{{harvp|Watterson|1995|p=104}}</ref> While the ride is sometimes the focus of the strip,<ref>[[#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]]. vol. 2, pp. 233, 325.

(Get Rid of Slimy GirlS) ====\nG.R.O.S.S. (which stands for '''G'''et '''R'''id '''O'''f '''S'''limy Girl'''S''' or \"otherwise it doesn't spell anything\") is a [[Club (organization)|club]] in which Calvin and Hobbes are the only members. The club was founded in the garage of their house, but to clear space for its activities, Calvin and (purportedly) Hobbes push Calvin's parents' car, causing it to roll into a ditch (but not suffer damage); the incident prompts the duo to change the club's location to Calvin's treehouse. They hold meetings that involve annoying and discomforting Susie Derkins. Notable actions include planting a fake secret tape near her in attempt to draw her in to a trap, trapping her in a closet at their house and creating elaborate water balloon traps. Calvin gave himself and Hobbes important positions in the club, Calvin being \"Dictator-for-Life\" and Hobbes being \"President-and-First-Tiger\". They go into Calvin's treehouse for their club meetings and often get into fights during them. The password to get into the treehouse is intentionally long and difficult, which has on at least one occasion ruined Calvin's plans. As Hobbes is able to climb the tree without the rope, he is usually the one who comes up with the password, which often involves heaping praise upon tigers. An example of this can be seen in the comic strip where Calvin, rushing to get into the treehouse to throw things at a passing Susie Derkins, insults Hobbes, who is in the treehouse and thus has to let down the rope. Hobbes forces Calvin to say the password for insulting him. By the time Susie arrives, in time to hear Calvin saying some of the password, causing him to stumble, Calvin is on \"''Verse Seven:'' Tigers are perfect!/The E-pit-o-me/of good looks and grace/and quiet..uh..um..dignity\". The opportunity to pelt Susie with something having passed, Calvin threatens to turn Hobbes into a rug.<ref name=\"watterson1990_p36\">{{cite book |last=Watterson |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill Watterson |title=Weirdos from Another Planet! |year=1990 |publisher=Andrews and McMeel |location=Kansas City, Missouri |isbn=0-8362-1862-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/weirdosfromanoth00watt/page/36 36] |title-link=List of Calvin and Hobbes books }}</ref> G.R.O.S.S. is one of the most common adventures that Calvin has.

(The collections ''do'' contain a strip for this date, but it is not the same strip that appeared in some newspapers. Treasuries usually combine the two preceding collections with bonus material and include color reprints of Sunday comics.)\n\nWatterson included some new material in the treasuries. In ''The Essential Calvin and Hobbes'', which includes cartoons from the collections ''Calvin and Hobbes'' and ''Something Under the Bed Is Drooling'', the back cover features a scene of a giant Calvin rampaging through a town.

Watterson was warned by the syndicate not to give up the day job yet, but it was not long before the series had become a hit. Within a year of [[print syndication|syndication]], the strip was published in roughly 250 newspapers and was proving to have international appeal with translation and [[Calvin and Hobbes in translation|wide circulation]] outside the United States.\n\nAlthough ''Calvin and Hobbes'' would undergo continual artistic development and creative innovation over the period of syndication, the earliest strips demonstrate a remarkable consistency with the latest. Watterson introduced all the major characters within the first three weeks, and made no changes to the central cast over the 10 years of the strip's history.\n\nBy April 5, 1987, Watterson was featured in an article in ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]''.<ref name=\"simple\" /> ''Calvin and Hobbes'' earned Watterson the Reuben Award from the [[National Cartoonists Society]] in the Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year category, first in 1986 and again in 1988.

By 1991, Watterson had achieved his goal of securing a new contract that granted him legal control over his creation and all future licensing arrangements.\n\n=== Creative control (1991\u20131995) ===\nHaving achieved his objective of creative control, Watterson's desire for privacy subsequently reasserted itself and he ceased all media interviews, relocated to [[New Mexico]], and largely disappeared from public engagements, refusing to attend the ceremonies of any of the cartooning awards he won.<ref name=\":1\" /> The pressures of the battle over merchandising led to Watterson taking an extended break from May 5, 1991, to February 1, 1992, a move that was virtually unprecedented in the world of syndicated cartoonists.\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| header = Comparison of Calvin and Hobbes' following layout changes\n| direction = \n| width = 260\n| image1 = Calvin and Hobbes 6 Sep 1987.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Calvin and Hobbes 26 Sep 1993.jpg\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = The comic strip on the left from 1987 illustrates the layout constraints that Bill Watterson was required to work within for the first 6 years of the comic's syndication.

Few editors approved of the move, but the strip was so popular that they had no choice but to continue to run it for fear that competing newspapers might pick it up and draw its fans away.<ref name=\"astor1991\">{{cite journal |last=Astor |first=David |title=Nine-month Vacation for Bill Watterson |page=34 |journal=[[Editor & Publisher]] |publisher=Duncan McIntosh |location=Irvine, California |date=1991-03-30}}</ref> Watterson returned to the strip in 1992 with plans to produce his Sunday strip as an unbreakable half of a newspaper or [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] page. This made him only the second cartoonist since [[Garry Trudeau]] to have sufficient popularity to demand more space and control over the presentation of his work.\n\nWatterson took a second sabbatical from April 3 through December 31, 1994. When he returned, he had made the decision to end the strip. In 1995, Watterson sent a letter via his syndicate to all editors whose newspapers carried his strip announcing his plans to end the strip by the end of the year. Stating his belief that he had achieved everything that he wanted to within the medium, he announced his intention to work on future projects at a slower pace with fewer artistic compromises.\n\nThe final strip ran on Sunday, December 31, 1995.<ref name=\"pr_calvin\">{{cite web |url=http://www.andrewsmcmeel.com/calvinandhobbes/pr_calvin.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051026183516/http://www.andrewsmcmeel.com/calvinandhobbes/pr_calvin.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2005-10-26 |accessdate=2009-05-02 |title=The Complete Calvin and Hobbes |publisher=[[Andrews & McMeel]]}}</ref> It depicted Calvin and Hobbes outside in freshly fallen snow, reveling in the wonder and excitement of the winter scene. \"It's a magical world, Hobbes, ol' buddy...

This larger format version of the strip was constrained by mandatory layout requirements that made it possible for newspaper editors to format the strip for different page sizes and layouts.\n\nWatterson grew increasingly frustrated by the shrinking of the available space for comics in the newspapers and the mandatory panel divisions that restricted his ability to produce better artwork and more creative storytelling. He lamented that without space for anything more than simple dialogue or sparse artwork, comics as an art form were becoming dilute, bland, and unoriginal.<ref name=\"west1989\">{{cite web|url=http://ignatz.brinkster.net/ccomicsjournal.html|title=Interview: Bill Watterson|last=West|first=Richard Samuel|date=February 1989|work=[[The Comics Journal]] / [[Fantagraphics]] via Calvin and Hobbies: Magic on Paper (fan site)|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714012735/http://ignatz.brinkster.net/ccomicsjournal.html|archivedate=July 14, 2011|url-status=dead|accessdate=August 30, 2012|issue=127|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"astor1988\">{{cite journal |title=Watterson Knocks the Shrinking of Comics |first=David |last=Astor |journal=[[Editor & Publisher]] |publisher=Duncan McIntosh |location=Irvine, California |date=1988-12-03 |page=40}}</ref>\n\nWatterson longed for the artistic freedom allotted to classic strips such as ''[[Little Nemo]]'' and ''[[Krazy Kat]]'', and in 1989 he gave a sample of what could be accomplished with such liberty in the opening pages of the Sunday strip compilation, ''The Calvin and Hobbes Lazy Sunday Book\u2014''an 8-page previously unpublished Calvin story fully illustrated in watercolour.

Following his 1991 sabbatical, Universal Press announced that Watterson had decided to sell his Sunday strip as an unbreakable half of a newspaper or [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] page. Many editors and even a few cartoonists including [[Bil Keane]] (''[[The Family Circus]]'') and [[Bruce Beattie]] ([[Snafu Comics|''Snafu'']]) criticized him for what they perceived as arrogance and an unwillingness to abide by the normal practices of the cartoon business.<ref name=\"astor1992\">{{cite journal|last=Astor|first=David|date=1992-03-07|title=Cartoonists discuss 'Calvin' requirement|url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/article_brief/eandp/1/1165165|url-status=dead|journal=[[Editor & Publisher]]|location=Irvine, California|publisher=Duncan McIntosh|page=34|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320192434/http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/article_brief/eandp/1/1165165|archivedate=2007-03-20|accessdate=2007-01-19}}</ref> Others, including [[Bill Amend]] ([[FoxTrot|''Foxtrot'']]), Johnny Hart ([[B.C.

The first took place from May 5, 1991 to February 1, 1992, and second from April 3 through December 31, 1994. These sabbaticals were included in the new contract Watterson managed to negotiate with Universal Features in 1990. The sabbaticals were proposed by the syndicate themselves who, fearing Watterson's complete burnout, endeavoured to get another five years of work from their star artist.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWatterson remains only the third cartoonist with sufficient popularity and stature to receive a sabbatical from their syndicate, the first being [[Garry Trudeau]] (''[[Doonesbury]]'') in 1983 and [[Gary Larson]] (''[[The Far Side]]'') in 1989.<ref name=\":3\" /> Typically cartoonists are expected to produce sufficient strips to cover any period they may wish to take off. Watterson's lengthy sabbaticals received some mild criticism from his fellow cartoonists including [[Greg Evans (cartoonist)|Greg Evans]] ([[Luann (comic strip)|''Luann'']]), and [[Charles M. Schulz|Charles Schulz]] (''[[Peanuts]]''), one of Watterson's major artistic influences, even called it a \"puzzle\". Some cartoonists resented the idea that Watterson worked harder than others, whilst others supported it. At least one newspaper editor noted that the strip was the most popular in the country, and that he had \"earned it\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://timhulsizer.com/cwords/cmixedresponse.html|title=Mixed Response To Second Sabbatical|last=|first=|date=26 March 1994|work=Editor & Publisher|access-date=19 September 2018|issue=13|volume=127|page=30}}</ref> Following his second sabbatical, Watterson made the decision that he was going to retire from the comic strip entirely.\n\n==Merchandising==\nIn spite of ''Calvin and Hobbes''' popularity, the strip remains notable for the relative lack of official product merchandising. Bill Watterson held that comic strips should stand on their own as an art form and although he did not start out completely opposed to merchandising in all forms (or even for all comic strips), he did reject an early syndication deal that involved incorporating a more marketable, licensed character into his strip.<ref name=\"christie1987\" /> In spite of being an unproven cartoonist, and having been flown all the way to New York to discuss the proposal, Watterson reflexively resented the idea of \"cartooning by committee\" and turned it down.\n\nLater, when ''Calvin'' was accepted by Universal Syndicate, and began to grow in popularity, Watterson found himself at odds with the syndicate, which urged him to begin merchandising the characters and touring the country to promote the first collections of comic strips. Watterson refused. To him, the integrity of the strip and its artist would be undermined by [[commercialization]], which he saw as a major negative influence in the world of cartoon art<ref name=\"west1989\" /> and he came to believe that licensing his character would only violate the spirit of his work.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book|last=Watterson|first=Bill|publisher=Andrews and McMeel|year=1995|isbn=0836204387|location=Kansas City|pages=10\u201311}}</ref> He gave an example of this in discussing his opposition to a Hobbes plush toy: that if the essence of Hobbes' nature in the strip is that it remain unresolved whether he is a real tiger or a stuffed toy, then creating a real stuffed toy would only destroy the magic. However, having initially signed away control over merchandising in his initial contract with the syndicate,<ref name=\":1\" /> Watterson would commence a lengthy and emotionally draining battle with Universal to gain control over his work. Ultimately Universal did not approve any products against Watterson's wishes, understanding that unlike other comic strips, it would be near impossible to separate the creator from the strip if Watterson chose to walk away.\n\nOne estimate places the value of licensing revenue forgone by Watterson at $300\u2013$400 million.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://bigthink.com/Picture-This/what-is-the-legacy-of-calvin-and-hobbes|title=What is the legacy of Calvin and Hobbes?|last=Bob|first=Duggan|date=|work=Big Think|access-date=}}</ref> Almost no legitimate ''Calvin and Hobbes'' merchandise exists.<ref name=\"items\">{{cite web | url=http://ignatz.brinkster.net/citems.html | title=A Concise Guide to All Legal Calvin and Hobbes Items | last=Hulsizer | first=Tim | publisher=Calvin and Hobbes: Magic on Paper (fan site)| accessdate=December 24, 2011|archivedate=July 19, 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110719004818/http://ignatz.brinkster.net/citems.html | url-status=live}}</ref> Exceptions produced during the strip's original run include two 16-month calendars (1988\u201389 and 1989\u201390), a t-shirt for the Smithsonian Exhibit, ''Great American Comics: 100 Years of Cartoon Art'' (1990) and the textbook [[Teaching with Calvin and Hobbes|''Teaching with'' Calvin and Hobbes]],<ref name=\"twch\">{{cite book |last1=Holmen |first1=Linda |last2=Santella-Johnson |first2=Mary |last3=Watterson |first3=Bill |authorlink3=Bill Watterson |others=Cover and supplementary art by Jan Roebken |title=Teaching with Calvin and Hobbes |year=1993 |publisher=Playground Publishing |location=Fargo, North Dakota |isbn=1-878849-15-8 |lay-url=http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cteaching.html |laydate=2004}}</ref> which has been described as \"perhaps the most difficult piece of official ''Calvin and Hobbes'' memorabilia to find.\"<ref name=\"Martell 2010 p. 236\">{{harvp|Martell|2010|p=236}}</ref> In 2010, Watterson did allow his characters to be included in a series of [[United States Postal Service]] stamps honoring five classic American comics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usps.com/communications/newsroom/2010/pr10_068.htm |title=Sunday Funnies Comic Strips Debut on Stamps |date=July 16, 2010 |publisher=[[United States Postal Service]] [[press release]] |location=Columbus, Ohio |accessdate=January 10, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027144142/http://www.usps.com/communications/newsroom/2010/pr10_068.htm |archivedate=October 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref> Licensed prints of ''Calvin and Hobbes'' were made available, and have also been included in various academic works.\n\nThe strip's immense popularity has led to the appearance of various [[counterfeit]] items such as window decals and T-shirts that often feature [[Off-color humor|crude humor]], [[binge drinking]] and other themes that are not found in Watterson's work.<ref>[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]]. p. 12.</ref> Images from one strip in which Calvin and Hobbes dance to loud music at night were commonly used for copyright violations.<ref>[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]]. p. 36.</ref> After threat of a lawsuit alleging infringement of copyright and trademark, some sticker makers replaced Calvin with a different boy, while other makers made no changes.<ref>{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Bernstein |title=Calvin's Unauthorized Leak: Stock Car Fans Misuse Comics Character |work=[[The Virginian-Pilot]] ([[Norfolk, Virginia]]) via [[The Washington Post]] via Calvin and Hobbes: Magic on Paper (fan site) |page=B9 |date=July 17, 1997 |url=http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cstockcars.html |accessdate=April 18, 2011 |archivedate=July 22, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722001516/http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cstockcars.html |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Watterson wryly commented, \"I clearly miscalculated how popular it would be to show Calvin urinating on a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] logo,\"<ref name=\"amiv\" /> but that they would be his \"ticket to immortality\".<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/53216/mental-floss-exclusive-our-interview-bill-watterson|title=Our Interview with Calvin and Hobbes Creator Bill Watterson!|last=Rossen|first=Jake|date=17 October 2013|work=Mental Floss|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Animation===\nWatterson has expressed admiration for animation as an artform. In a 1989 interview in ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' he described the appeal of being able to do things with a moving image that can't be done by a simple drawing: the distortion, the exaggeration and the control over the length of time an event is viewed.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} However, although the visual possibilities of animation appealed to Watterson, the idea of finding a voice for Calvin made him uncomfortable, as did the idea of working with a team of animators.<ref name=\"west1989\" /> Ultimately, ''Calvin and Hobbes'' was never made into an [[animated cartoon|animated series]]. Watterson later stated in ''The Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book'' that he liked the fact that his strip was a \"low-tech, one-man operation,\" and that he took great pride in the fact that he drew every line and wrote every word on his own.<ref>[[Calvin and Hobbes#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]]. p. 11.</ref> Calls from major Hollywood figures interested in an adaptation of his work, including [[Jim Henson]], [[George Lucas]] and [[Steven Spielberg]] were never returned<ref name=\":1\" /> and in a 2013 interview Watterson stated that he had \"zero interest\" in an animated adaptation as there was really no upside for him in doing so.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Style and influences==\nThe strip borrows several elements and themes from three major influences: [[Walt Kelly]]'s ''[[Pogo (comic strip)|Pogo]]'', [[George Herriman]]'s ''[[Krazy Kat]]'' and [[Charles M. Schulz]]'s ''[[Peanuts]]''.<ref name=\"Watterson 1995 p. 21\">{{harvp|Watterson|1995|p=21}}</ref> Schulz and Kelly particularly influenced Watterson's outlook on comics during his formative years.<ref name=\"christie1987\" />\n\nNotable elements of Watterson's artistic style are his characters' diverse and often exaggerated expressions (particularly those of Calvin), elaborate and bizarre backgrounds for Calvin's flights of imagination, expressions of motion and frequent visual jokes and metaphors. In the later years of the strip, with more panel space available for his use, Watterson experimented more freely with different panel layouts, art styles, stories without dialogue and greater use of [[White space (visual arts)|white space]]. He also makes a point of not showing certain things explicitly: the \"Noodle Incident\" and the [[Children's literature|children's book]] ''Hamster Huey and the Gooey Kablooie'' are left to the reader's imagination, where Watterson was sure they would be \"more outrageous\" than he could portray.<ref>{{harvp|Watterson|1995|p=200}}</ref> However, since then, ''Hamster Huey and the Gooey Kablooie'' has been written completely in the real world.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hamster Huey and the Gooey Kablooie: The Renowned Hero's Most Famous Adventure |isbn=9780974909004|last1=Barr|first1=Mabel|date=December 2004}}</ref>\n\n== Production and technique ==\nWatterson's technique started with minimalist [[Sketch (drawing)|pencil sketches]] drawn with a [[light pencil]] (though the larger Sunday strips often required more elaborate work) on a piece of [[Bristol board]], with his brand of choice being Strathmore because he felt it held the drawings better on the page as opposed to the cheaper brands (Watterson said he would use any cheap pad of Bristol board his local supply store had, but switched to Strathmore after he found himself growing more and more displeased with the results). He would then use a small [[Kolinsky sable-hair brush|sable]] brush and [[India ink]] to fill in the rest of the drawing, saying that he did not want to simply trace over his penciling and thus make the inking more spontaneous. He lettered dialogue with a [[Rotring|Rapidograph]] [[fountain pen]], and he used a [[quill|crowquill]] pen for odds and ends.<ref name=\"Watterson 1995 p. 20\">[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]]. p. 20.</ref> Mistakes were covered with various forms of [[correction fluid]], including the type used on typewriters. Watterson was careful in his use of color, often spending a great deal of time in choosing the right colors to employ for the weekly Sunday strip; his technique was to cut the color tabs the syndicate sent him into individual squares, lay out the colors, and then paint a watercolor approximation of the strip on tracing paper over the Bristol board and then mark the strip accordingly before sending it on.<ref name=\"Watterson 2001\">[[#CITEREFWatterson2001|Watterson (2001)]].</ref> When ''Calvin and Hobbes'' began there were 64 colors available for the Sunday strips. For the later Sunday strips Watterson had 125 colors as well as the ability to fade the colors into each other.<ref name=\"Watterson 1995 p. 20\"/>\n\n==Main characters==\n===Calvin===\n{{Infobox character\n| name             = Calvin\n| series           = <!-- use without the italic on the outside -->\n| image            = Calvin,_of_Calvin_and_Hobbes.png\n| image_size       =140px \n| alt              = \n| caption          = \n| first            = November 18, 1985\n| last             = December 31, 1995\n| creator          = [[Bill Watterson]]\n| lbl1             = Comic\n| data1            = ''Calvin and Hobbes''\n| lbl21            = Age\n| data21           = 6}}\nCalvin, named after the 16th-century theologian [[John Calvin]], is a six-year-old boy with spiky [[blond]] hair and a distinctive red-and-black striped shirt, black pants and sneakers.<ref name=\"Watterson 1995 p. 21\" /> Despite his poor grades in school, Calvin demonstrates his intelligence through a sophisticated vocabulary, philosophical mind and creative/artistic talent.

She also plays imaginary games with Calvin in which she acts as a high-powered lawyer or politician and wants Calvin to pretend to be her [[Stay-at-home dad|househusband]]. Though both of them are typically loath to admit it, Calvin and Susie exhibit many common traits and inclinations. For example, the reader occasionally sees Susie with a stuffed rabbit named \"[[Secondary characters in Calvin and Hobbes#Mr. Bun|Mr. Bun]].\" Much like Calvin, Susie has a mischievous (and sometimes aggressive) streak as well, which the reader witnesses whenever she subverts Calvin's attempts to cheat on school tests by feeding him incorrect answers, or whenever she fights back after Calvin attacks her with snowballs or water balloons.\n\nHobbes often openly expresses romantic feelings for Susie, to Calvin's disgust. In contrast, Calvin started a club (of which he and Hobbes are the only members) that he calls G.R.O.S.S. ('''G'''et '''R'''id '''O'''f '''S'''limy Girl'''S'''), and while holding \"meetings\" in Calvin's [[tree house]] or in the \"box of secrecy\" in Calvin's room, they usually come up with some plot against Susie. In one instance, Calvin steals one of Susie's dolls and holds it for ransom, only to have Susie retaliate by nabbing Hobbes. Watterson admits that Calvin and Susie have a nascent crush on each other and that Susie is a reference to the type of woman whom Watterson himself found attractive and eventually married.<ref name=\"Watterson 1995\" /> \n{{-}}\n\n===Secondary characters===\n{{See also|Secondary characters in Calvin and Hobbes}}Calvin also interacts with a handful of secondary characters.

These are as follows:\n\n====Calvin's alter-egos====\nCalvin imagines himself as many great creatures and other people, including [[dinosaur]]s, elephants, jungle-farers and superheroes. Three of his [[alter ego]]s are well-defined and recurrent:\n{{main|Spaceman Spiff}}\n*{{anchor|Spaceman Spiff}}\"'''Spaceman Spiff'''\" is a heroic spacefarer who narrates his adventures in the [[Third-person pronoun|third person]]. As Spiff, Calvin battles aliens (typically his parents or teacher, but also sometimes other kids his age) with a ray gun known as a \"zorcher\" (later \"frap-ray blaster\", \"death ray blaster\" or \"atomic napalm neutralizer\") and travels to distant planets (his house, school or neighborhood), often crashing unhurt on a planet. Calvin's self-narration as Spaceman Spiff is frequently riddled with alliteration: \"Zounds! Zorched by Zarches, Spaceman Spiff's crippled craft crashes on planet Plootarg!\"  Watterson has stated the idea of Spaceman Spiff was from an earlier attempt as a cartoon.\n* \"'''Tracer Bullet'''\" is a [[hardboiled]] private eye, who says he has eight slugs in him (\"One's lead, and the rest are bourbon.\"). In one story, Bullet is called to a case in which a \"pushy dame\" (Calvin's mother) accuses him of destroying an expensive lamp (broken during an indoor football game between Calvin and Hobbes). Later, he is snatched by the pushy dame's \"hired goon\" (Calvin's father having a talk with him). He made his debut when Calvin donned a [[fedora]] in order to hide a terrible haircut Hobbes had given him. These strips are drawn in elaborate, shadowy black-and-white that evoke [[film noir]]. Watterson did not attempt Tracer Bullet stories often, due to the time-consuming way the strip needed to be drawn and inked.<ref>[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]]. p. 132.</ref>\n{{anchor|Stupendous Man}}\n* \"'''Stupendous Man'''\" is a superhero wearing a mask and a cape (made by Calvin's mother), and also narrating his own adventures. While Calvin is in character as Stupendous Man, he refers to his alter ego as a mild-mannered millionaire playboy. Stupendous Man almost always \"suffers defeat\" at the hands of his opponent. When Hobbes asks if Stupendous Man has ever won any battles, Calvin says all his battles are \"moral victories.\" Stupendous Man's nemeses include \"Mom-Lady\" (Calvin's mom), \"Annoying Girl\" (Susie Derkins), \"Crab Teacher\" (Miss Wormwood) and \"Baby-Sitter Girl\" (Rosalyn). Some of the \"super powers\" of the villains have been revealed: Mom-Lady has a \"mind scrambling eyeball ray\" that wills the victim to \"do her nefarious bidding\"; and Baby Sitter Girl has a similar power of using a \"psycho beam\" which weakens \"Stupendous Man's stupendous will\". The \"powers\" of Annoying Girl and Crab Teacher are never revealed. Calvin often tries to pretend he and \"Stupendous Man\" are two different people, but it fails to work. Stupendous Man has multiple \"superpowers\", including, but not limited to, super strength, the ability to fly, various vision powers such as \"high-speed vision\", \"muscles of magnitude\" and a stomach of steel.\n\n====Cardboard boxes====\n[[File:Scientific Progress Goes Boink (Calvin and Hobbes).jpg|thumb|Calvin duplicating himself using a cardboard box, as seen on the cover of ''Scientific Progress Goes \"Boink\"'']]\nCalvin also has several adventures involving corrugated [[cardboard box]]es, which he adapts for many imaginative and elaborate uses. In one strip, when Calvin shows off his [[Transmogrify|Transmogrifier]], a device that transforms its user into any desired creature or item, Hobbes remarks, \"It's amazing what they do with corrugated cardboard these days.\"<ref name=\"watterson1988_p229\">{{cite book |last=Watterson |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill Watterson |title=The Essential Calvin and Hobbes: A Calvin and Hobbes Treasury |year=1988 |publisher=Andrews and McMeel |location=Kansas City, Missouri |isbn=0-8362-1805-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/essentialcalvinh00watt_1/page/229 229] |title-link=List of Calvin and Hobbes books }}</ref> Calvin is able to change the function of the boxes by rewriting the label and flipping the box onto another side. In this way, a box can be used not only for its conventional purposes (a storage container for water balloons, for example), but also as a flying [[Time travel|time machine]], a duplicator or, with the attachment of a few wires and a colander, a \"Cerebral Enhance-o-tron.\"\n\nIn the real world, Calvin's antics with his box have had varying effects. When he transmogrified into a tiger, he still appeared as a regular human child to his parents. However, in a story where he made several duplicates of himself, his parents are seen interacting with what does seem like multiple Calvins, including in a strip where two of him are seen in the same panel as his father. It is ultimately unknown what his parents do or do not see, as Calvin tries to hide most of his creations (or conceal their effects) so as not to traumatize them.\n\nIn addition, Calvin uses a cardboard box as a sidewalk kiosk to sell things. Often, Calvin offers merchandise no one would want, such as \"suicide drink\", \"a swift kick in the butt\" for one dollar<ref>[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]]. p. 172.</ref> or a \"frank appraisal of your looks\" for fifty cents. In one strip, he sells \"happiness\" for ten cents,  hitting the customer in the face with a water balloon and explaining that he meant his own happiness. In another strip, he sold \"insurance\", [[Protection racket|firing a slingshot at those who refused to buy it]]. In some strips, he tried to sell \"great ideas\", and in one earlier strip, he attempted to sell the family car to obtain money for a grenade launcher. In yet another strip, he sells \"life\" for five cents, where the customer receives nothing in return, which, in Calvin's opinion, is life.\n\nThe box has also functioned as an alternate secret meeting place for G.R.O.S.S., as the \"Box of Secrecy\".\n[[File:Calvin and Hobbes playing Calvinball.jpg|thumb|296x296px|Calvin and Hobbes playing Calvinball with an assortment of sporting equipment.]]\n\n====Calvinball====\n<!-- Courtesy note per [[WP:LiNK2SECT]]: [[Calvinball]] redirects here -->\n{{quote box\n| align = right\n| width = 25em\n| quote = <poem>\nOther kids' games are all such a bore!\nThey've gotta have rules and they gotta keep score!\nCalvinball is better by far!\nIt's never the same!

Calvinball is a [[nomic]] or self-modifying game, a contest of wits, skill and creativity rather than stamina or athletic skill. The game is portrayed as a rebellion against conventional team sports<ref name=\"CC+H_b2_p268-273\">[[Calvin and Hobbes#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]]. vol. 2, pp. 268\u2013273.

The only consistent rules of the game are that Calvinball may never be played with the same rules twice<ref>[[Calvin and Hobbes#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]]. vol. 2, p. 292. Comic originally published 1990-05-27.</ref> and that each participant must wear a mask.<ref name=\"CC+H_b3_p430-433\">[[Calvin and Hobbes#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]]. vol. 3, pp. 430\u2013434.

Scoring is portrayed as arbitrary and nonsensical (\"Q to 12\" and \"oogy to boogy\"<ref>[[Calvin and Hobbes#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]]. vol. 2, pp. 292, 336.

He uses the snowman for social commentary, revenge or pure enjoyment. Examples include Snowman Calvin being yelled at by Snowman Dad to shovel the snow; one snowman eating [[snow cone]]s scooped out of a second snowman, who is lying on the ground with an ice-cream scoop in his back; a \"snowman house of horror\"; and snowmen representing people he hates. \"The ones I ''really'' hate are small, so they'll melt faster,\" he says. There was even an occasion on which Calvin accidentally brought a snowman to life and it made itself and a small army into \"deranged mutant killer monster snow goons.\"\n\nCalvin's snow art is often used as a commentary on art in general. For example, Calvin has complained more than once about the lack of originality in other people's snow art and compared it with his own grotesque snow sculptures. In one of these instances, Calvin and Hobbes claim to be the sole guardians of high culture; in another, Hobbes admires Calvin's willingness to put artistic integrity above marketability, causing Calvin to reconsider and make an ordinary snowman.\n\n====Wagon and sled rides====\nCalvin and Hobbes frequently ride downhill in a [[wagon]] or [[sled]] (depending on the season), as a device to add some [[physical comedy]] to the strip and because, according to Watterson, \"it's a lot more interesting ... than talking heads.\"<ref name=\"Watterson 1995 p. 104\">{{harvp|Watterson|1995|p=104}}</ref> While the ride is sometimes the focus of the strip,<ref>[[#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]]. vol. 2, pp. 233, 325.

(Get Rid of Slimy GirlS) ====\nG.R.O.S.S. (which stands for '''G'''et '''R'''id '''O'''f '''S'''limy Girl'''S''' or \"otherwise it doesn't spell anything\") is a [[Club (organization)|club]] in which Calvin and Hobbes are the only members. The club was founded in the garage of their house, but to clear space for its activities, Calvin and (purportedly) Hobbes push Calvin's parents' car, causing it to roll into a ditch (but not suffer damage); the incident prompts the duo to change the club's location to Calvin's treehouse. They hold meetings that involve annoying and discomforting Susie Derkins. Notable actions include planting a fake secret tape near her in attempt to draw her in to a trap, trapping her in a closet at their house and creating elaborate water balloon traps. Calvin gave himself and Hobbes important positions in the club, Calvin being \"Dictator-for-Life\" and Hobbes being \"President-and-First-Tiger\". They go into Calvin's treehouse for their club meetings and often get into fights during them. The password to get into the treehouse is intentionally long and difficult, which has on at least one occasion ruined Calvin's plans. As Hobbes is able to climb the tree without the rope, he is usually the one who comes up with the password, which often involves heaping praise upon tigers. An example of this can be seen in the comic strip where Calvin, rushing to get into the treehouse to throw things at a passing Susie Derkins, insults Hobbes, who is in the treehouse and thus has to let down the rope. Hobbes forces Calvin to say the password for insulting him. By the time Susie arrives, in time to hear Calvin saying some of the password, causing him to stumble, Calvin is on \"''Verse Seven:'' Tigers are perfect!/The E-pit-o-me/of good looks and grace/and quiet..uh..um..dignity\". The opportunity to pelt Susie with something having passed, Calvin threatens to turn Hobbes into a rug.<ref name=\"watterson1990_p36\">{{cite book |last=Watterson |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill Watterson |title=Weirdos from Another Planet! |year=1990 |publisher=Andrews and McMeel |location=Kansas City, Missouri |isbn=0-8362-1862-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/weirdosfromanoth00watt/page/36 36] |title-link=List of Calvin and Hobbes books }}</ref> G.R.O.S.S. is one of the most common adventures that Calvin has.

Treasuries usually combine the two preceding collections with bonus material and include color reprints of Sunday comics.)\n\nWatterson included some new material in the treasuries. In ''The Essential Calvin and Hobbes'', which includes cartoons from the collections ''Calvin and Hobbes'' and ''Something Under the Bed Is Drooling'', the back cover features a scene of a giant Calvin rampaging through a town.

During her term, she criticized the administration of President [[Ernesto Samper]], who was accused of corruption in the [[8000 Process]] scandal after accepting money from the [[Cali Cartel|Cali drug cartel]] for his electoral campaign.

Pastrana persuaded Betancourt to endorse him, and she campaigned for him under the agreement of an anti-corruption electoral reform to be adopted during his presidential term.

The peace process with the FARC had collapsed, the DMZ had been put to an end, and Pastrana had launched \"Operacion Tanatos\" to reclaim the area. At the time Betancourt decided to go, the Colombian Army had been deployed in the area in an attempt to evict the FARC guerillas. President Pastrana had given them 48 hours to leave the territory, and the deadline had expired.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> That same day President Pastrana attended a press conference in San Vicente del Caguan, in order to prove with his presence that the FARC had fled and that the military operation was a success. At the same time, the government ordered Betancourt's bodyguards to abandon the mission of escorting her to San Vicente del Caguan.\n\nNonetheless, Betancourt was determined to go. Despite the army's refusal to airlift her into San Vicente, she decided to drive and was given a government vehicle. The government later claimed that Betancourt had signed a document to release the government from any responsibility for what could happen to her. [[Clara Rojas]], [[Adair Lamprea]], and Betancourt have denied the existence of such document. The document has never been made public by any Colombian official.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Begg |first=Kirsten |title=Betancourt: I will not sue Colombia |url=http://colombiareports.com/colombia-news/news/10745-betancourt-i-will-not-sue-colombia.html |publisher=Colombia Reports |date=2010-07-12 |accessdate=2010-09-10}}</ref>\n\nThe peace talks reached an impasse after more than three years of negotiations. From the beginning, the FARC would not agree to a truce for the duration of the negotiations nor that the peace talks be overseen by different representatives of the international community. Though the DMZ was purported to be a \"laboratory for peace\", in practice the FARC continued its kidnapping activities, military attacks, purchasing of weapons, and even building of roads and airstrips for trafficking [[narcotics]]. Critics considered the DMZ to have been turned into a safe haven in which the FARC imposed its will as law, launching military attacks and acts of terrorism outside the DMZ before withdrawing back to it, in order to avoid direct confrontation with government armed forces. Also during this time, hundreds of civilians were kidnapped throughout different cities and rural areas of the country. They were then transported back to the DMZ, where they were kept in cages, many of them having been kidnapped for economic [[extortion]], others for \"political reasons\". By the end of 2001, the Colombian government and public opinion (according to different polls) were growing impatient and discouraged at the situation.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nIn February 2002, a [[turboprop]] plane flying from [[Florencia, Caquet\u00e1|Florencia]] to Bogot\u00e1\u2014a distance of some {{convert|1000|km|mi|abbr=on}}\u2014was [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] in midair by FARC members and forced to land on a [[highway strip]] near the city of [[Neiva, Colombia|Neiva]], and then a member of the Colombian Congress was kidnapped. As a consequence, President Andr\u00e9s Pastrana canceled the talks with the FARC and revoked the DMZ, arguing that the FARC had betrayed the terms of the negotiation and had used the DMZ to grow stronger in military and logistical capabilities. In a televised statement, the president expressed the government's intention of retaking the DMZ, advising that the military operation would begin at midnight. He also urged the FARC to respect the lives and the livelihood of those civilians still present in the DMZ.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n==Autobiography==\nAfter her experience in the impeachment process against Colombian President E. Samper, Betancourt published her memoirs, in French, in March 2001, under the title ''La rage au c\u0153ur''.<ref name=NYT/> The book generated intense media coverage in France, where it was the number one best seller for four weeks and a best seller for another nine.<ref name=NYT/> It has since appeared in Spanish as ''La rabia en el coraz\u00f3n''<ref>{{Cite web|title=La Rabia En El Corazon |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/9586391868 |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=2008-04-08}}</ref> and in English as ''Until Death Do Us Part: My Struggle to Reclaim Colombia'' (2002).<ref name=Amazon>{{Cite web|title=Until Death Do Us Part: My Struggle to Reclaim Colombia |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000C4SWUY |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=2008-04-08}}</ref>\n\n==Kidnapping==\nMost candidates for political office visited the former DMZ. When Betancourt announced her trip, the government confirmed that a security escort would accompany her from Florencia to San Vicente del Caguan. When she landed at Florencia's airport, she was offered to be transported to San Vicente del Caguan in a military helicopter. This offer was retracted later on, at the same time her bodyguards received the order to cancel their mission. President Pastrana and other officials explained they had turned down the helicopter ride offer, arguing that this meant rendering public resources to Betancourt's private political interests.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Betancourt stated that the government had, under constitutional provisions, the obligation of protecting any Colombian running for presidency, which included her.\n\nWhen denied transport aboard a [[military helicopter]] that was heading to the DMZ, Betancourt revisited the original plan to travel there via ground transport, together with [[Clara Rojas]], her [[campaign manager]] who was later named [[running-mate]] for the 2002 election, and a handful of political aides. On 23 February 2002, Betancourt was stopped at the last military checkpoint before going into the former DMZ. Military officers have reported they insisted on stopping her car,{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} and that Betancourt dismissed their warnings and continued her journey.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} These allegations contradict the testimony of Adair Lamprea who was driving the car. He insists traffic was normal, and the military officers at the checkpoint asked for their ID, but did not try to stop them. This is corroborated by the fact that on the FARC roadblock where Betancourt was kidnapped, other vehicles were stopped, including a Red Cross four wheel drive car and a bus, which comprised normal traffic. According to Betancourt's kidnapper, [[Nolberto Uni Vega]] (after his capture), Betancourt ended up at a FARC checkpoint where she was kidnapped. Her kidnap was not planned beforehand, said the rebel.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://colombiareports.com/2008/04/15/betancourts-kidnapper-says-hes-sorry/ |title=Betancourt's kidnapper says he's sorry |date=15 April 2008 |publisher=Colombia Reports |accessdate=2008-04-15 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Despite her abduction, Betancourt still appeared on the ballot for the presidential elections; her husband promised to continue her campaign.

The mechanism would involve the release of what the FARC terms its \"political [[hostage]]s\" in exchange for most jailed [[guerrillas]], numbering about 500. For the FARC, most of its other hostages, those held for extortion purposes and which would number at least a thousand, would not be considered subject to such an exchange.\n\nThe newly elected [[\u00c1lvaro Uribe|Uribe]] administration initially ruled out any negotiation with the group that would not include a [[ceasefire]], and instead pushed for rescue operations, many of which have traditionally been successful when carried out by the police's [[GAULA]] anti-kidnapping group in urban settings, but not in the mountains and jungles where the FARC keeps most prisoners, according to official statistics and mainstream news reports.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nRelatives of Betancourt and of most of FARC's political hostages came to strongly reject any potential rescue operations, especially after the death of the governor of the [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] department, [[Guillermo Gaviria Correa|Guillermo Gaviria]], his peace advisor and several soldiers, kidnapped by the FARC during a peace march in 2003. The governor and the others were shot at close range by the FARC when the government launched an army rescue mission into the jungle which failed as the guerrillas learned of its presence in the area.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n===Negotiations===\n{{See also|Humanitarian exchange}}\n\n====2002====\nA day after Betancourt's kidnapping several non-governmental organizations ([[NGO]]) under the lead of [[Armand Burguet]] were organized in the [[European Union]] and around the world to establish an association or committee for the liberation of Ingrid Betancourt.

The Uribe government, seeming to have gradually relaxed its position, announced that it had given the FARC a formal proposal on 23 July, in which it offered to free 50 to 60 jailed rebels in exchange for the political and military hostages held by the FARC group (not including economic hostages, as the government had earlier demanded).\n\nThe government would make the first move, releasing insurgents charged or condemned for rebellion and either allowing them to leave the country or to stay and join the state's reinsertion program. Then the FARC would release the hostages in its possession, including Ingrid Betancourt. The proposal would have been carried out with the backing and support of the French and Swiss governments, who publicly supported it once it was revealed.\n\nThe move was signaled as potentially positive by several relatives of the victims and Colombian political figures. Some critics of the president have considered that Uribe may seek to gain political prestige from such a move, though they would agree with the project in practice.\n\nThe FARC released a communiqu\u00e9 dated 20 August (but apparently published publicly only on 22 August) in which they denied having received the proposal earlier through the mediation of Switzerland as the government had stated. While making note of the fact that a proposal had been made by the Uribe administration and that it hoped that common ground could eventually be reached, the FARC criticized the offer because they believe that any deal should allow them to decide how many of its jailed comrades would be freed and that they should be allowed to return to the rebel ranks.\n\nOn 5 September, what has been considered as a sort of FARC counter proposal was revealed in the Colombian press. The FARC proposed that the government declare a \"security\" or \"guarantee\" zone for 72 hours in order for official insurgent and state negotiators to meet face to face and directly discuss a prisoner exchange. Government military forces would not have to leave the area but to concentrate in their available garrisons, in a similar move to that agreed by the Ernesto Samper administration (1994\u20131998) which involved the group freeing some captured security forces. In addition, the government's peace commissioner would have to make an official public pronouncement regarding this proposal.\n\nIf the zone were created, the first day would be used for traveling to the chosen location, the second to discuss the matter, and the third for the guerrillas to abandon the area. The government would be able to choose the location for the \"security zone\" from among the municipalities of [[Pe\u00f1as Coloradas]], [[El Rosal, Cundinamarca|El Rosal]] or [[La Tuna]], all in [[Caquet\u00e1 Department|Caquet\u00e1]] department, where the FARC had influence. It was speculated by retired military analysts{{Who|date=September 2009}} that the FARC could potentially set up [[land mines]] or other traps around local military garrisons while the zone is in place.\n\nThe FARC proposal to arrange a meeting with the government was considered as positive by Yolanda Pulecio, Betancourt's mother, who called it a sign of \"progress [\u2026] just as the (government) commissioner can meet with (right-wing) paramilitaries, why can't he meet with the others, who are just as terrorist as they are.\"\n\n====2006====\nIn February 2006, France urged the FARC to seize the chance offered by a European-proposed prisoner swap, accepted by Bogot\u00e1, and free dozens it had held for up to seven years.

The FARC members in charge of the hostages were persuaded to accept a request from headquarters to gather the hostages together, supposedly to be flown to FARC chief [[Alfonso Cano]]. Instead, they were flown by government personnel dressed as FARC members to [[San Jos\u00e9 del Guaviare]]. No one was harmed during the rescue. Three American [[Northrop Grumman]] contractors, [[Marc Gonsalves]], [[Keith Stansell]], and [[Thomas Howes (hostage)|Thomas Howes]], were among those released.<ref name=\"Pluck\">Romero, Simon, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/03/world/americas/03colombia.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin \"Colombia Plucks Hostages from Rebels' Grasp\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 3 July 2008.

Other agents were assigned to guard the hostages. Using their authority in the group, the agents ordered the hostages moved from three different locations to a central area. From this point, the hostages, agents, and about 60 real FARC members made a 90-mile march through the jungle to a spot where, agents told the FARC members, an \"international mission\" was coming to check on the hostages. On schedule, an unmarked white helicopter set down and Colombian security forces posing as FARC members jumped out. They told the FARC members that they would take the hostages to the meeting with the \"international mission.\" All of the captives were handcuffed and placed aboard the helicopter, along with two of their FARC guards, who were quickly disarmed and subdued after the helicopter lifted off. According to Betancourt, a crew member then turned and told the 15 hostages, \"We are the national military. You are free.\"<ref>{{Cite news\n|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/americas/07/03/hostage.drama/index.html\n|title=Old-fashioned fake-out results in freedom for hostages\n|date=3 July 2008\n|publisher=CNN\n|accessdate=2008-07-03}}</ref> Tracking technology was used by the rescuers to zero in on their target.<ref name=\"Pluck\"/>\n\nOn 16 July 2008 it became public that one of the Colombian officials was [[false flag|misusing]] a [[International Committee of the Red Cross|Red Cross]] emblem during the rescue operation.

During her term, she criticized the administration of President [[Ernesto Samper]], who was accused of corruption in the [[8000 Process]] scandal after accepting money from the [[Cali Cartel|Cali drug cartel]] for his electoral campaign. In 1997, Betancourt launched a political party, the [[Partido Verde Oxigeno]] (Green Oxygen Party), as an alternative to the traditional conservative and liberal parties.\n\n===Elected Senator of Colombia, 1998===\nBetancourt ran for Senator in the 1998 election, and the total number of votes she received was the largest of any candidate in a senate election. During her time in elected office, death threats caused her to send her children to New Zealand, where they could live with their father.<ref name=salon/>\n\nThat same year, the presidential election was ultimately won by [[Andr\u00e9s Pastrana]]. Pastrana persuaded Betancourt to endorse him, and she campaigned for him under the agreement of an anti-corruption electoral reform to be adopted during his presidential term. The electoral reform was aborted due to strong pressures from the traditional parties and to lack of commitment from the government. Betancourt withdrew her support to the government and joined the opposition forces.\n\n===Presidential candidate, 2002===\n{{See also|2002 Colombian presidential election}}\n\nBetancourt launched her presidential campaign on May 20, 2001, while standing next to a statue of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] in Bogot\u00e1.

The peace process with the FARC had collapsed, the DMZ had been put to an end, and Pastrana had launched \"Operacion Tanatos\" to reclaim the area. At the time Betancourt decided to go, the Colombian Army had been deployed in the area in an attempt to evict the FARC guerillas. President Pastrana had given them 48 hours to leave the territory, and the deadline had expired.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> That same day President Pastrana attended a press conference in San Vicente del Caguan, in order to prove with his presence that the FARC had fled and that the military operation was a success. At the same time, the government ordered Betancourt's bodyguards to abandon the mission of escorting her to San Vicente del Caguan.\n\nNonetheless, Betancourt was determined to go. Despite the army's refusal to airlift her into San Vicente, she decided to drive and was given a government vehicle. The government later claimed that Betancourt had signed a document to release the government from any responsibility for what could happen to her. [[Clara Rojas]], [[Adair Lamprea]], and Betancourt have denied the existence of such document. The document has never been made public by any Colombian official.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Begg |first=Kirsten |title=Betancourt: I will not sue Colombia |url=http://colombiareports.com/colombia-news/news/10745-betancourt-i-will-not-sue-colombia.html |publisher=Colombia Reports |date=2010-07-12 |accessdate=2010-09-10}}</ref>\n\nThe peace talks reached an impasse after more than three years of negotiations. From the beginning, the FARC would not agree to a truce for the duration of the negotiations nor that the peace talks be overseen by different representatives of the international community. Though the DMZ was purported to be a \"laboratory for peace\", in practice the FARC continued its kidnapping activities, military attacks, purchasing of weapons, and even building of roads and airstrips for trafficking [[narcotics]]. Critics considered the DMZ to have been turned into a safe haven in which the FARC imposed its will as law, launching military attacks and acts of terrorism outside the DMZ before withdrawing back to it, in order to avoid direct confrontation with government armed forces. Also during this time, hundreds of civilians were kidnapped throughout different cities and rural areas of the country. They were then transported back to the DMZ, where they were kept in cages, many of them having been kidnapped for economic [[extortion]], others for \"political reasons\". By the end of 2001, the Colombian government and public opinion (according to different polls) were growing impatient and discouraged at the situation.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nIn February 2002, a [[turboprop]] plane flying from [[Florencia, Caquet\u00e1|Florencia]] to Bogot\u00e1\u2014a distance of some {{convert|1000|km|mi|abbr=on}}\u2014was [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] in midair by FARC members and forced to land on a [[highway strip]] near the city of [[Neiva, Colombia|Neiva]], and then a member of the Colombian Congress was kidnapped. As a consequence, President Andr\u00e9s Pastrana canceled the talks with the FARC and revoked the DMZ, arguing that the FARC had betrayed the terms of the negotiation and had used the DMZ to grow stronger in military and logistical capabilities. In a televised statement, the president expressed the government's intention of retaking the DMZ, advising that the military operation would begin at midnight. He also urged the FARC to respect the lives and the livelihood of those civilians still present in the DMZ.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n==Autobiography==\nAfter her experience in the impeachment process against Colombian President E. Samper, Betancourt published her memoirs, in French, in March 2001, under the title ''La rage au c\u0153ur''.<ref name=NYT/> The book generated intense media coverage in France, where it was the number one best seller for four weeks and a best seller for another nine.<ref name=NYT/> It has since appeared in Spanish as ''La rabia en el coraz\u00f3n''<ref>{{Cite web|title=La Rabia En El Corazon |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/9586391868 |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=2008-04-08}}</ref> and in English as ''Until Death Do Us Part: My Struggle to Reclaim Colombia'' (2002).<ref name=Amazon>{{Cite web|title=Until Death Do Us Part: My Struggle to Reclaim Colombia |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000C4SWUY |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=2008-04-08}}</ref>\n\n==Kidnapping==\nMost candidates for political office visited the former DMZ. When Betancourt announced her trip, the government confirmed that a security escort would accompany her from Florencia to San Vicente del Caguan. When she landed at Florencia's airport, she was offered to be transported to San Vicente del Caguan in a military helicopter. This offer was retracted later on, at the same time her bodyguards received the order to cancel their mission. President Pastrana and other officials explained they had turned down the helicopter ride offer, arguing that this meant rendering public resources to Betancourt's private political interests.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Betancourt stated that the government had, under constitutional provisions, the obligation of protecting any Colombian running for presidency, which included her.\n\nWhen denied transport aboard a [[military helicopter]] that was heading to the DMZ, Betancourt revisited the original plan to travel there via ground transport, together with [[Clara Rojas]], her [[campaign manager]] who was later named [[running-mate]] for the 2002 election, and a handful of political aides. On 23 February 2002, Betancourt was stopped at the last military checkpoint before going into the former DMZ. Military officers have reported they insisted on stopping her car,{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} and that Betancourt dismissed their warnings and continued her journey.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} These allegations contradict the testimony of Adair Lamprea who was driving the car. He insists traffic was normal, and the military officers at the checkpoint asked for their ID, but did not try to stop them. This is corroborated by the fact that on the FARC roadblock where Betancourt was kidnapped, other vehicles were stopped, including a Red Cross four wheel drive car and a bus, which comprised normal traffic. According to Betancourt's kidnapper, [[Nolberto Uni Vega]] (after his capture), Betancourt ended up at a FARC checkpoint where she was kidnapped. Her kidnap was not planned beforehand, said the rebel.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://colombiareports.com/2008/04/15/betancourts-kidnapper-says-hes-sorry/ |title=Betancourt's kidnapper says he's sorry |date=15 April 2008 |publisher=Colombia Reports |accessdate=2008-04-15 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Despite her abduction, Betancourt still appeared on the ballot for the presidential elections; her husband promised to continue her campaign.

She also stated she was never warned that it would be dangerous to travel by road, that checkpoints let her through with no warning or attempt to stop her, and that the government encouraged her to travel by road.\n<ref>{{Cite news\n|url=http://thedianerehmshow.org/shows/2010-09-23/ingrid-betancourt-even-silence-has-end\n|title=Diane Rehm Show: Ingrid Betancourt: \"Even Silence Has An End\"\n|date=23 September 2010\n}}</ref>\n\n===Uribe's initial policy===\nEver since the days of the Pastrana negotiations, when a limited exchange took place, the FARC have demanded the formalization of a mechanism for prisoner exchange. The mechanism would involve the release of what the FARC terms its \"political [[hostage]]s\" in exchange for most jailed [[guerrillas]], numbering about 500. For the FARC, most of its other hostages, those held for extortion purposes and which would number at least a thousand, would not be considered subject to such an exchange.\n\nThe newly elected [[\u00c1lvaro Uribe|Uribe]] administration initially ruled out any negotiation with the group that would not include a [[ceasefire]], and instead pushed for rescue operations, many of which have traditionally been successful when carried out by the police's [[GAULA]] anti-kidnapping group in urban settings, but not in the mountains and jungles where the FARC keeps most prisoners, according to official statistics and mainstream news reports.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nRelatives of Betancourt and of most of FARC's political hostages came to strongly reject any potential rescue operations, especially after the death of the governor of the [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] department, [[Guillermo Gaviria Correa|Guillermo Gaviria]], his peace advisor and several soldiers, kidnapped by the FARC during a peace march in 2003. The governor and the others were shot at close range by the FARC when the government launched an army rescue mission into the jungle which failed as the guerrillas learned of its presence in the area.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n===Negotiations===\n{{See also|Humanitarian exchange}}\n\n====2002====\nA day after Betancourt's kidnapping several non-governmental organizations ([[NGO]]) under the lead of [[Armand Burguet]] were organized in the [[European Union]] and around the world to establish an association or committee for the liberation of Ingrid Betancourt.

The Uribe government, seeming to have gradually relaxed its position, announced that it had given the FARC a formal proposal on 23 July, in which it offered to free 50 to 60 jailed rebels in exchange for the political and military hostages held by the FARC group (not including economic hostages, as the government had earlier demanded).\n\nThe government would make the first move, releasing insurgents charged or condemned for rebellion and either allowing them to leave the country or to stay and join the state's reinsertion program. Then the FARC would release the hostages in its possession, including Ingrid Betancourt. The proposal would have been carried out with the backing and support of the French and Swiss governments, who publicly supported it once it was revealed.\n\nThe move was signaled as potentially positive by several relatives of the victims and Colombian political figures. Some critics of the president have considered that Uribe may seek to gain political prestige from such a move, though they would agree with the project in practice.\n\nThe FARC released a communiqu\u00e9 dated 20 August (but apparently published publicly only on 22 August) in which they denied having received the proposal earlier through the mediation of Switzerland as the government had stated. While making note of the fact that a proposal had been made by the Uribe administration and that it hoped that common ground could eventually be reached, the FARC criticized the offer because they believe that any deal should allow them to decide how many of its jailed comrades would be freed and that they should be allowed to return to the rebel ranks.\n\nOn 5 September, what has been considered as a sort of FARC counter proposal was revealed in the Colombian press. The FARC proposed that the government declare a \"security\" or \"guarantee\" zone for 72 hours in order for official insurgent and state negotiators to meet face to face and directly discuss a prisoner exchange. Government military forces would not have to leave the area but to concentrate in their available garrisons, in a similar move to that agreed by the Ernesto Samper administration (1994\u20131998) which involved the group freeing some captured security forces. In addition, the government's peace commissioner would have to make an official public pronouncement regarding this proposal.\n\nIf the zone were created, the first day would be used for traveling to the chosen location, the second to discuss the matter, and the third for the guerrillas to abandon the area. The government would be able to choose the location for the \"security zone\" from among one of the municipalities of [[Pe\u00f1as Coloradas]], [[El Rosal, Cundinamarca|El Rosal]] or [[La Tuna]], all in [[Caquet\u00e1 Department|Caquet\u00e1]] department, where the FARC had influence. It was speculated by retired military analysts{{Who|date=September 2009}} that the FARC could potentially set up [[land mines]] or other traps around local military garrisons while the zone is in place.\n\nThe FARC proposal to arrange a meeting with the government was considered as positive by Yolanda Pulecio, Betancourt's mother, who called it a sign of \"progress [\u2026] just as the (government) commissioner can meet with (right-wing) paramilitaries, why can't he meet with the others, who are just as terrorist as they are.\"\n\n====2006====\nIn February 2006, France urged the FARC to seize the chance offered by a European-proposed prisoner swap, accepted by Bogot\u00e1, and free dozens it had held for up to seven years.

See [[WP:FILMPLOT]]-->\nThe chickens live in a farm run by Mrs. Tweedy. They try to escape, but are always caught. Frustrated at the minuscule profits that the farm generates, Mrs. Tweedy conceives an idea of converting the farm to automated production and having a pie machine in the barn in order to turn the chickens into meat pies. One day, Ginger, the leader of the chickens, observes a rooster named Rocky crash-landing into the farm after being shot from a circus cannon. Ginger and the chickens hide him from the Tweedys. Ginger, interested in Rocky's flying abilities, begs him to help teach her and the chickens to fly. Rocky gives them training lessons in the meantime while Mr. Tweedy, Mrs. Tweedy's husband, builds the pie machine. Later, Rocky holds a party and Ginger insists he show them to fly the next day, but Mr. Tweedy finishes making the pie machine and puts Ginger in it for a test run. Rocky saves Ginger, giving them time to warn the others of the Tweedys' plan to make them into pies and only a short time for their escape.\n\nThe next day, Ginger finds Rocky has fled, leaving behind part of a poster that shows him to be a stunt rooster, shot out of a cannon from a circus and unable to fly himself, depressing Ginger and the others. Fowler the rooster tries to cheer them up by telling stories of being an RAF (Royal Air Force) division mascot, leading Ginger the idea of creating a plane to flee from the farm. The chickens assemble parts for the plane as Mrs. Tweedy insists Mr. Tweedy gather all the chickens to put into the machine, but when he comes in, the chickens attack Mr. Tweedy, leaving him bound and gagged, as they finish the plane. Rocky returns and joins them, but while taking off, Mrs. Tweedy chases them and climbs up a strand while Ginger races to sever it, managing to cut the strand, sending Mrs. Tweedy into the pie machine, which causes it to explode. The chickens continue their flight to freedom, and find an island where they enjoy their freedom, and Ginger and Rocky start a relationship.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Julia Sawalha]] as Ginger, a hen who is determined to save her fellow chickens from their impending doom on the Tweedys' farm. She is usually the one that comes up with ideas and is generally more intelligent than the other chickens. \n* [[Mel Gibson]] as Rocky, a laid-back American circus rooster who crash-lands on the farm and teaches the chickens to fly at Ginger's request.\n* [[Miranda Richardson]] as Mrs. Tweedy, a greedy and cantankerous lady who decides to convert her farm into a chicken pot pie factory solely for monetary reasons.\n* [[Tony Haygarth]] as Mr. Tweedy, Mrs. Tweedy's oafish, henpecked husband.

See [[WP:FILMPLOT]]-->\nThe chickens live in a farm run by the Tweedys. They try to escape, but are always caught. Frustrated at the minuscule profits that the farm generates, Mrs. Tweedy conceives an idea of converting the farm to automated production and having a pie machine in the barn in order to turn the chickens into meat pies. One day, Ginger, the leader of the chickens, observes a rooster named Rocky crash-landing into the farm after being shot from a circus cannon. Ginger and the chickens hide him from the Tweedys. Ginger, interested in Rocky's flying abilities, begs him to help teach her and the chickens to fly. Rocky gives them training lessons in the meantime while Mr. Tweedy builds the pie machine. Later, Rocky holds a party and Ginger insists he show them to fly the next day, but Mr. Tweedy finishes making the pie machine and puts Ginger in it for a test run. Rocky saves Ginger, giving them time to warn the others of the Tweedys' plan to make them into pies and only a short time for their escape.\n\nThe next day, Ginger finds Rocky has fled, leaving behind part of a poster that shows him to be a stunt rooster, shot out of a cannon from a circus and unable to fly himself, depressing Ginger and the others. Fowler the rooster tries to cheer them up by telling stories of being an RAF (Royal Air Force) division mascot, leading Ginger the idea of creating a plane to flee from the farm. The chickens assemble parts for the plane as Mrs. Tweedy insists Mr. Tweedy gather all the chickens to put into the machine, but when he comes in, the chickens attack Mr. Tweedy, leaving him bound and gagged, as they finish the plane. Rocky returns and joins them, but while taking off, Mrs. Tweedy chases them and climbs up a strand while Ginger races to sever it, managing to cut the strand, sending Mrs. Tweedy into the pie machine, which causes it to explode. The chickens continue their flight to freedom, and find an island where they enjoy their freedom, and Ginger and Rocky start a relationship.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Julia Sawalha]] as Ginger, a hen who is determined to save her fellow chickens from their impending doom on the Tweedys' farm. She is usually the one that comes up with ideas and is generally more intelligent than the other chickens. \n* [[Mel Gibson]] as Rocky, a laid-back American circus rooster who crash-lands on the farm and teaches the chickens to fly at Ginger's request.\n* [[Miranda Richardson]] as Mrs. Tweedy, a greedy and cantankerous lady who decides to convert her farm into a chicken pot pie factory solely for monetary reasons.\n* [[Tony Haygarth]] as Mr. Tweedy, Mrs. Tweedy's oafish, henpecked husband. Despite his unintelligence, he is cruel to the chickens and more suspicious than his wife of their escape plans, and he correctly identifies Ginger as their leader.\n* [[Benjamin Whitrow]] as Fowler, a feisty elderly rooster who regularly prattles about his [[Royal Air Force]] experiences.\n* [[Timothy Spall]] as Nick, a cynical, portly rat who smuggles contraband into the compound.\n* [[Phil Daniels]] as Fetcher, a rat who is Nick's slim, slow-witted partner.\n* [[Jane Horrocks]] as Babs, the fattest of the chickens. She is a stout hen with a dim-witted innocence and a love of knitting.\n* [[Imelda Staunton]] as Bunty, the champion egg-layer and group cynic who is the most skeptical of Ginger's escape plans. \n* [[Lynn Ferguson]] as Mac, Ginger's genius [[Scottish people|Scottish]] assistant.\n\n==Production==\n''Chicken Run'' was [[Aardman Animations|Aardman]]'s first feature-length production, which would be executive produced by [[Jake Eberts]].

The other seven are: [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]], [[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]], [[TOTEM]], [[LHCb]], [[LHCf]], [[MoEDAL]] and [[FASER experiment|FASER]].\n\n==Introduction==\n[[File:2012-Aug-02-ALICE 3D v0 with Text (1) 2.jpg|thumb|450px|left|Computer generated cut-away view of ALICE showing the 18 detectors of the experiment.]]\n\nALICE is optimized to study heavy-ion ([[Lead|Pb-Pb]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]]) collisions at a [[centre of mass]] energy up to 5.02 [[TeV]] per [[nucleon]] pair. The resulting temperature and energy density allow exploration of of [[quark\u2013gluon plasma]], a fifth state of matter wherein [[quark]]s and [[gluon]]s are freed. Similar conditions are believed to have existed a fraction of the second after the Big Bang before quarks and gluons bound together to form [[hadrons]] and heavier particles.<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/alice-through-the-phase-transition/ ALICE through the phase transition], ''CERN Courier'', 30 October 2000.</ref>\n\nALICE is focusing on the physics of strongly interacting matter at extreme energy densities. The properties of the [[quark\u2013gluon plasma]] and the understanding of quark [[deconfinement]] are key issues in [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD). The results obtained by ALICE corroborate the understanding of [[color confinement]] and [[chiral symmetry]] restoration. Recreating the primordial form of matter, [[Quark\u2013gluon plasma|quark-gluon plasma]], and understanding how it evolves is expected to shed light on questions about how matter is organized, the mechanism that confines quarks and gluons and the nature of strong interactions and how they result in generating the bulk of the mass of ordinary matter.\n\nQuantum chromodynamics (QCD) predicts that at sufficiently high energy densities there will be a phase transition from conventional hadronic matter, where quarks are locked inside nuclear particles, to a plasma of deconfined quarks and gluons. The reverse of this transition is believed to have taken place when the universe was just 10<sup>\u22126</sup> s old, and may still play a role today in the hearts of collapsing neutron stars or other astrophysical objects.<ref>Panos Charito, [http://alicematters.web.cern.ch/?q=Rajagopal Interview with Krishna Rajacopal], ALICE Matters, 15 April 2013.

Retrieved 20 January 2019.</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe idea of building a dedicated heavy-ion detector for the LHC was first aired at the historic Evian meeting \"Towards the LHC experimental Programme\" in March 1992. From the ideas presented there, the ALICE collaboration was formed and in 1993, a LoI was submitted.<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/alice-new-kid-on-the-block-archive/ ALICE New Kid on the block] ''CERN Courier'', 19 September 2008.</ref>\n\nALICE was first proposed as a central detector in 1993 and later complemented by an additional forward muon spectrometer designed in 1995. In 1997, ALICE received the green light from the LHC Committee to proceed towards final design and construction.<ref>[https://timeline.web.cern.ch/events/alice-experiment-approved ALICE Experiment approved] CERN timeline. 14 February 1997. Retrieved 20 January 2019.</ref>\n\nThe first ten years were spent on design and an extensive R&D effort. Like for all other LHC experiments, it became clear from the outset that also the challenges of heavy ion physics at LHC could not be really met (nor paid for) with existing technology. Significant advances, and in some cases a technological break-through, would be required to build on the ground what physicists had dreamed up on paper for their experiments. The initially very broad and later more focused, well organised and well supported R&D effort, which was sustained over most of the 1990s, has led to many evolutionary and some revolutionary advances in detectors, electronics and computing.\n\nDesigning a dedicated heavy-ion experiment in the early '90s for use at the LHC some 15 years later posed some daunting challenges. The detector had to be general purpose - able to measure most signals of potential interest, even if their relevance may only become apparent later - and flexible, allowing additions and modifications along the way as new avenues of investigation would open up. In both respects ALICE did quite well, as it included a number of observables in its initial menu whose importance only became clear later. Various major detection system were added, from the muon spectrometer in 1995, the transition radiation detectors in 1999 to a large jet calorimeter added in 2007.\n\nALICE recorded data from the first lead-lead collisions at the LHC in 2010. Data sets taken during heavy-ion periods in 2010 and 2011 as well as proton-lead data from 2013 have provided an excellent basis for an in-depth look at the physics of quark\u2013gluon plasma.\n\n{{as of|2014}} After more than three years of successful operation, the ALICE detector is about to undergo a major programme of consolidation and upgrade during the long shutdown [LS1] of CERN's accelerator complex. A new subdetector called the dijet calorimeter (DCAL) will be installed, and all 18 of the existing ALICE subdetectors will be upgraded. There will also be major renovation work on the ALICE infrastructure, including the electrical and cooling systems. The wealth of published scientific results and the very intense upgrade programme of ALICE have attracted numerous institutes and scientists from all over the world. Today the ALICE Collaboration has more than 1800 members coming from 176 institutes in 41 countries<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alice-collaboration.web.cern.ch/general/index.html|title=ALICE Collaboration|accessdate=20 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Heavy-ion collisions at the LHC==\nSearches for Quark Gluon plasma and a deeper understanding of the QCD started at CERN and Brookhaven with lighter ions in the 1980s.<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/experiments-revisit-the-quark-gluon-soup/ Experiments Revisit the Quark-Gluon Plasma] ''CERN Courier'', 26 February 2001.</ref><ref>[https://cerncourier.com/rhic-starts-producing-data/ RHIC starts producing data] ''CERN Courier'', 10 October 2000.</ref> Today's programme at these laboratories has moved on to ultrarelativistic collisions of heavy ions, and is just reaching the energy threshold at which the phase transition is expected to occur. The LHC, with a centre-of-mass energy around 5.5 TeV/nucleon, will push the energy reach even further.\n\nDuring head-on collisions of lead ions at the LHC, hundreds of protons and neutrons smash into one another at energies of upwards of a few TeVs. Lead ions are accelerated to more than 99.9999% of the speed of light and collisions at the LHC are 100 times more energetic than those of protons - heating up matter in the interaction point to a temperature almost 100,000 times higher than the temperature in the core of the sun.\n\nWhen the two lead nuclei slam into each other, matter undergoes a transition to form for a brief instant a droplet of primordial matter, the so-called [[quark\u2013gluon plasma]] which is believed to have filled the universe a few microseconds after the Big Bang.\n\nThe [[quark\u2013gluon plasma]] is formed as protons and neutrons \"melt\" into their elementary constituents, [[quarks]] and [[gluons]] become asymptotically free. The droplet of QGP instantly cools, and the individual quarks and gluons (collectively called [[partons]]) recombine into a blizzard of ordinary matter that speeds away in all directions.<ref>[http://alicematters.web.cern.ch/?q=UrsWiedemann Interview with CERN's theorist Urs Wiedemann] ALICE Matters, 13 July 2012</ref> The debris contains particles such as [[pions]] and [[kaons]], which are made of a [[quark]] and an [[antiquark]]; [[protons]] and [[neutrons]], made of three quarks; and even copious [[antiprotons]] and [[antineutron]]s, which may combine to form the nuclei of [[antiatom]]s as heavy as helium. Much can be learned by studying the distribution and energy of this debris.\n\n===First lead-lead collisions===\n[[File:Alicelead3.jpg|thumb|One of the LHC's first lead-ion collisions, as recorded by the ALICE detector.]]\nThe Large Hadron Collider smashed its first lead ions in 2010, on 7 November at around 12:30&nbsp;a.m. CET.<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/lhc-begins-physics-with-lead-ions/ LHC begins physics with lead ions] ''CERN Courier'', 30 November 2010.</ref><ref>[https://cerncourier.com/first-ions-for-alice-and-rings-for-lhcb/ First ions for ALICE and rings for LHCb] ''CERN Courier'', 30 October 2009.</ref>\n\nThe first collisions in the center of the ALICE, ATLAS and CMS detectors took place less than 72 hours after the LHC ended its first run of protons and switched to accelerating lead-ion beams. Each lead nucleus contains 82 protons, and the LHC accelerates each proton to an energy of 3.5 TeV, thus resulting in an energy of 287 TeV per beam, or a total collision energy of 574 TeV.\n\nUp to 3,000 charged particles were emitted from each collision, shown here as lines radiating from the collision point. The colors of the lines indicate how much energy each particle carried away from the collision.\n\n===Proton-lead collisions at the LHC===\n[[File:ALICE pPb event.jpg|thumb|Proton-Lead ion collision recorded by the ALICE Experiment on 13 September 2012 at a center of mass energy per colliding nucleon-nucleon pair of 5.02 TeV.]]\nIn 2013, the [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]] collided protons with lead ions for the LHC's first physics beams of 2013.<ref>[http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/breaking/2010/11/08/first-lead-ion-collisions-in-the-lhc First lead-ion collisions in the LHC] Symmetry Magazine, 8 November 2010.</ref> The experiment was conducted by counter-rotating beams of ''protons'' and ''lead ions'', and begun with centred orbits with different revolution frequencies, and then separately ramped to the accelerator's maximum collision energy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.web.cern.ch/about/updates/2013/01/protons-smash-lead-ions-first-lhc-collisions-2013|title=Protons smash lead ions in first LHC collisions of 2013|date=22 January 2013|author=Cian O'Luanaigh}}</ref>\n\nThe first lead-proton run at the LHC lasted for one month and data help ALICE physicists to decouple the effects of the plasma from effects that stem from cold nuclear matter effects and shed more light on the study of the Quark-Gluon plasma.\n\nIn the case of lead-lead collisions, the configurations of the quarks and gluons that make up the protons and neutrons of the incoming lead nucleus can be somewhat different of those in the incoming protons. In order to study if part of the effects we see when comparing lead-lead and proton-proton collisions is due to this configuration difference rather than the formation of the plasma. Proton-lead collisions are an ideal tool for this study.\n\n==The ALICE detectors==\nA key design consideration of ALICE is the ability to study QCD and quark (de)confinement under these extreme conditions. This is done by using particles, created inside the hot volume as it expands and cools down, that live long enough to reach the sensitive detector layers situated around the interaction region. ALICE's physics programme relies on being able to identify all of them, i.e. to determine if they are electrons, photons, pions, etc. and to determine their charge. This involves making the most of the (sometimes slightly) different ways that particles interact with matter.<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/particle-identification-in-alice-boosts-qgp-studies/ Particle identification in ALICE boosts QGP studies] ''CERN Courier'', 23 August 2012.</ref>\n\nIn a \"traditional\" experiment, particles are identified or at least assigned to families (charged or neutral [[hadron]]s), by the characteristic signatures they leave in the detector. The experiment is divided into a few main components and each component tests a specific set of particle properties. These components are stacked in layers and the particles go through the layers sequentially from the collision point outwards: first a tracking system, then an electromagnetic (EM) and a hadronic calorimeter and finally a muon system. The detectors are embedded in a [[magnetic field]] in order to bend the tracks of charged [[particles]] for [[momentum]] and [[Electric charge|charge]] determination. This method for particle identification works well only for certain particles, and is used for example by the large [[LHC]] experiments [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]] and [[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]]. However, this technique is not suitable for hadron identification as it doesn't allow distinguishing the different charged hadrons that are produced in Pb-Pb collisions.\n\nIn order to identify all the particles that are coming out of the system of the QGP ALICE is using a set of 18 detectors<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/alice-forges-ahead-with-detector-installation/ ALICE forges ahead with detector installation] ''CERN Courier'', 6 December 2006.</ref> that give information about the mass, the velocity and the electrical sign of the particles.\n\n===Barrel tracking===\nAn ensemble of cylindrical barrel detectors that surround the nominal interaction point is used to track all the particles that fly out of the hot, dense medium. The Inner Tracking System(ITS) (consisting of three layers of detectors: Silicon Pixel Detector(SPD), Silicon Drift Detector(SDD), Silicon Strip Detector(SSD)), the Time Projection Chamber(TPC) and the Transition Radiation Detector(TRD) measure at many points the passage of each particle carrying an electric charge and give precise information about the particle's trajectory. The ALICE barrel tracking detectors are embedded in a magnetic field of 0.5 Tesla produced by a huge magnetic solenoid bending the trajectories of the particles. From the curvature of the tracks one can derive their momentum. The ITS is so precise that particles which are generated by the decay of other particles with a long(~.1&nbsp;mm before decay) life time can be identified by seeing that they do not originate from the point where the interaction has taken place (the \"[[Interaction point|vertex]]\" of the event) but rather from a point at a distance of as small as a tenth of a millimeter. This allows us to measure, for example, bottom quarks which decay into a relatively long-lived B-meson through \"topological\" cuts.\n\n====Inner Tracking System====\n[[File:ALICE ITS.jpg|thumb|Installation of the ALICE Inner Tracking System]]\n\nThe short-living heavy particles cover a very small distance before decaying. This system aims at identifying these phenomena of decay by measuring the location where it occurs with a precision of a tenth of millimetre.<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/the-inner-tracking-system-arrives-at-the-heart-of-alice/ The Inner Tracking System arrives at the heart of ALICE] ''CERN Courier'', 4 June 2007.</ref>\n\nThe Inner Tracking System (ITS) consists of six cylindrical layers of [[silicon detector]]s. The layers surround the collision point and measure the properties of the particles emerging from the collisions, pin-pointing their position of passage to a fraction of a millimetre.<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/pixels-make-for-perfect-particle-tracking-in-alice/ Pixels make for perfect particle tracking in ALICE] ''CERN Courier'', 8 July 2008.</ref> With the help of the ITS, particles containing heavy [[quarks]] (charm and beauty) can be identified by reconstructing the coordinates at which they decay.\n\nITS layers (counting from the interaction point):\n*2 layers of [http://aliceinfo.cern.ch/Public/en/Chapter2/Chap2_SPD.html SPD] ([[Hybrid pixel detector|Silicon Pixel Detector]]),\n*2 layers of SDD ([[Silicon Drift Detector]]),\n*2 layers of SSD ([http://cms.web.cern.ch/news/silicon-strips Silicon Strip Detector]).\n\nThe ITS was inserted at the heart of the ALICE experiment in March 2007 following a large phase of R&D. Using the smallest amounts of the lightest material, the ITS has been made as lightweight and delicate as possible. With almost 5\u2009m<sup>2</sup> of double-sided silicon strip detectors and more than 1\u2009m<sup>2</sup> of silicon drift detectors, it is the largest system using both types of silicon detector.\n\nALICE has recently presented plans for an upgraded Inner Tracking System, mainly based on building a new silicon tracker with greatly improved features in terms of determination of the impact parameter (d0) to the primary vertex, tracking efficiency at low pT and readout rate capabilities.<ref>Luciano Musa, [http://alicematters.web.cern.ch/?q=ALICE_ITSUpgrade Upgrade of the ALICE ITS] ALICE Matters, 5 December 2012. Retrieved 20 January 2019.</ref> The upgraded ITS will open new channels in the study of the Quark Gluon Plasma formed at LHC which are necessary in order to understand the dynamics of this condensed phase of the QCD.\n\nIt will allow the study of the process of thermalization of [[heavy quarks]] in the medium by measuring heavy flavour charmed and beauty [[baryons]] and extending these measurements down to very low p<sub>T</sub> for the first time. It will also give a better understanding of the quark mass dependence of in-medium energy loss and offer a unique capability of measuring the beauty quarks while also improving the beauty decay vertex reconstruction. Finally, the upgraded ITS will give us the chance to characterize the thermal radiation coming from the [[QGP]] and the in-medium modification of [[hadronic]] spectral functions as related to [[Chirality (physics)|chiral symmetry restoration]].\n\nThe upgrade project requires an extensive R&D effort by our researchers and collaborators all over the world on cutting-edge technologies: silicon sensors, low-power electronics, interconnection and packaging technologies, ultra-light mechanical structures and cooling units.\n\n====Time Projection Chamber====\n[[File:ALICE TPC.jpg|thumb|The ALICE [[Time Projection Chamber]] used for particle tracking and identification.]]\n\nThe ALICE [[Time Projection Chamber]] (TPC)  is a large volume filled with a [https://web.archive.org/web/20160728154350/http://aliceinfo.cern.ch/TPC/node/12 gas as detection medium] and is the main particle tracking device in ALICE.<ref>[http://alice-tpc.web.cern.ch/ ALICE Time Projection Chamber] Retrieved 20 January 2019.</ref><ref>[http://aliceinfo.cern.ch/Public/en/Chapter2/Chap2_TPC.html Time Projection Chamber] Retrieved 20 January 2019.</ref>\n\nCharged particles crossing the gas of the TPC ionize the gas atoms along their path, liberating electrons that drift towards the end plates of the detector. The characteristics of the ionization process caused by fast charged particles passing through a medium can be used for particle identification. The velocity dependence of the ionization strength is connected to the well-known [[Bethe-Bloch formula]] , which describes the average energy loss of charged particles through inelastic [[Coulomb collision]]s with the atomic electrons of the medium.\n\nMultiwire proportional counters or solid-state counters are often used as detection medium, because they provide signals with pulse heights proportional to the ionization strength. An [[Electron avalanche|avalanche effect]] in the vicinity of the anode wires strung in the readout chambers, gives the necessary signal amplification. The positive ions created in the avalanche induce a positive current signal on the pad plane. The readout is performed by the 557 568 pads that form the cathode plane of the multi-wire proportional chambers ([[MWPC]]) located at the end plates. This gives the radial distance to the beam and the azimuth. The last coordinate, z along the beam direction, is given by the drift time. Since energy-loss fluctuations can be considerable, in general many pulse-height measurements are performed along the particle track in order to optimize the resolution of the ionization measurement.\n\nAlmost all of the TPC's volume is sensitive to the traversing charged particles, but it features a minimum material budget. The straightforward pattern recognition (continuous tracks) make TPCs the perfect choice for high-multiplicity environments, such as in heavy-ion collisions, where thousands of particles have to be tracked simultaneously. Inside the ALICE TPC, the ionization strength of all tracks is sampled up to 159 times, resulting in a resolution of the ionization measurement as good as 5%.\n\n====Transition radiation detector====\n[[File:CERN ALICE Experiment.jpg|thumb|The completed ALICE detector showing the eighteen TRD modules (trapezoidal prisms in a radial arrangement).]]\n[[Electron]]s and [[positron]]s can be discriminated from other charged particles using the emission of [[transition radiation]], [[X-rays]] emitted when the particles cross many layers of thin materials.\n\nThe identification of electrons and positrons is achieved using a transition radiation detector (TRD).<ref>[http://aliceinfo.cern.ch/Public/en/Chapter2/Chap2_TRD.html Transition Radiation Detector] Retrieved 20 January 2019.</ref> In a similar manner to the muon spectrometer, this system enables detailed studies of the production of vector-meson resonances, but with extended coverage down to the light vector-meson \u03c1 and in a different rapidity region. Below 1 GeV/c, electrons can be identified via a combination of particle identification detector (PID) measurements in the TPC and time of flight (TOF). In the momentum range 1\u201310 GeV/c, the fact that electrons may create TR when travelling through a dedicated \"radiator\" can be exploited. Inside such a radiator, fast charged particles cross the boundaries between materials with different dielectric constants, which can lead to the emission of TR photons with energies in the X-ray range. The effect is tiny and the radiator has to provide many hundreds of material boundaries to achieve a high enough probability to produce at least one photon. In the ALICE TRD, the TR photons are detected just behind the radiator using MWPCs filled with a xenon-based gas mixture, where they deposit their energy on top of the ionization signals from the particle's track.\n\nThe ALICE TRD was designed to derive a fast trigger for charged particles with high momentum and can significantly enhance the recorded yields of vector mesons. For this purpose, 250,000 CPUs are installed right on the detector to identify candidates for high-momentum tracks and analyse the energy deposition associated with them as quickly as possible (while the signals are still being created in the detector). This information is sent to a global tracking unit, which combines all of the information to search for electron\u2013positron track pairs within only 6 \u03bcs.\n\nTo develop such a [[Transition radiation detector|Transition Radiation Detector]] (TRD) for ALICE many detector prototypes were tested in mixed beams of [[pion]]s and electrons.\n\n===Particle identification with ALICE===\nALICE also wants to know the identity of each particle, whether it is an electron, or a proton, a kaon or a pion.\n\nCharged hadrons (in fact, all stable charged particles) are unambiguously identified if their mass and charge are determined. The mass can be deduced from measurements of the momentum and of the velocity. Momentum and the sign of the charge are obtained by measuring the curvature of the particle's track in a magnetic field. To obtain the particle velocity there exist four methods based on measurements of time-of-flight and ionization, and on detection of transition radiation and Cherenkov radiation. Each of these methods works well in different momentum ranges or for specific types of particle. In ALICE all of these methods may be combined in order to measure, for instance, particle spectra.\n\nIn addition to the information given by ITS and TPC, more specialized detectors are needed: the TOF measures, with a precision better than a tenth of a billionth of a second, the time that each particle takes to travel from the vertex to reach it, so that one can measure its speed. The high momentum particle identification detector (HMPID) measures the faint light patterns generated by fast particles and the TRD measures the special radiation very fast particles emit when crossing different materials, thus allowing to identify electrons. Muons are measured by exploiting the fact that they penetrate matter more easily than most other particles: in the forward region a very thick and complex absorber stops all other particles and muons are measured by a dedicated set of detectors: the muon spectrometer.\n\n====Time of Flight====\nCharged particles are identified in ALICE by Time-Of-Flight (TOF). TOF measurements yield the velocity of a charged particle by measuring the flight time over a given distance along the track trajectory.<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/and-time-flies-for-the-alice-detector/ Time flies for ALICE] CERN Courier, 8 July 2008.</ref><ref>[https://cerncourier.com/alice-revolutionizes-tof-systems/ ALICE revolutionizes TOF systems] CERN Courier, 25 October 2011.</ref> Using the tracking information from other detectors every track firing a sensor is identified. Provided the momentum is also known, the mass of the particle can then be derived from these measurements. The ALICE TOF detector is a large-area detector based on multigap resistive plate chambers (MRPCs) that cover a cylindrical surface of 141 m<sup>2</sup>, with an inner radius of {{convert|3.7|m}}. There are approximately 160 000 MRPC pads with time resolution of about 100 ps distributed over the large surface of 150 m<sup>2</sup>.\n\nThe MRPCs are parallel-plate detectors built of thin sheets of standard window glass to create narrow gas gaps with high electric fields. These plates are separated using fishing lines to provide the desired spacing; 10 gas gaps per MRPC are needed to arrive at a detection efficiency close to 100%.\n\nThe simplicity of the construction allows a large system to be built with an overall TOF resolution of 80 ps at a relatively low cost (CERN Courier November 2011 p8). This performance allows the separation of kaons, pions and protons up to momenta of a few GeV/c. Combining such a measurement with the PID information from the ALICE TPC has proved useful in improving the separation between the different particle types, as figure 3 shows for a particular momentum range.\n\n====High Momentum Particle Identification Detector====\n[[File:ALICE HMPID.jpg|thumb|The HMPID detector before final installation inside the ALICE magnet.]]\n\nThe High Momentum Particle Identification Detector (HMPID) is a [[Ring imaging Cherenkov detector|RICH detector]] to determine the speed of particles beyond the momentum range available through energy loss (in ITS and TPC, ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;600&nbsp;MeV) and through time-of-flight measurements (in TOF, ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.2\u20131.4&nbsp;GeV).\n\nCherenkov radiation is a shock wave resulting from charged particles moving through a material faster than the velocity of light in that material. The radiation propagates with a characteristic angle with respect to the particle track, which depends on the particle velocity. Cherenkov detectors make use of this effect and in general consist of two main elements: a radiator in which Cherenkov radiation is produced and a photon detector. Ring imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detectors resolve the ring-shaped image of the focused Cherenkov radiation, enabling a measurement of the Cherenkov angle and thus the particle velocity. This in turn is sufficient to determine the mass of the charged particle.\n\nIf a dense medium (large refractive index) is used, only a thin radiator layer of the order of a few centimetres is required to emit a sufficient number of Cherenkov photons. The photon detector is then located at some distance (usually about 10&nbsp;cm) behind the radiator, allowing the cone of light to expand and form the characteristic ring-shaped image. Such a proximity-focusing RICH is installed in the ALICE experiment.\n\nALICE HMPID's momentum range is up to 3&nbsp;GeV for pion/[[kaon]] discrimination and up to 5&nbsp;GeV for kaon/[[proton]] discrimination.  It is the world's largest [[caesium iodide]] RICH detector, with an active area of 11&nbsp;m\u00b2. A prototype was successfully tested at CERN in 1997 and currently takes data at the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] at the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] in the US.\n\n===Calorimeters===\nCalorimeters measure the energy of particles, and determine whether they have electromagnetic or hadronic interactions. Particle Identification in a calorimeter is a destructive measurement. All particles except muons and neutrinos deposit all their energy in the calorimeter system by production of electromagnetic or hadronic showers. Photons, electrons and positrons deposit all their energy in an electromagnetic calorimeter. Their showers are indistinguishable, but a photon can be identified by the non-existence of a track in the tracking system that is associated to the shower.\n\nThe photons (particles of light), like the light emitted from a hot object, tell us about the temperature of the system. To measure them, special detectors are necessary: the crystals of the PHOS, which are as dense as lead and as transparent as glass, will measure them with fantastic precision in a limited region, while the PMD and in particular the EMCal will measure them over a very wide area. The EMCal will also measure groups of close particles (called \"jets\") which have a memory of the early phases of the event.\n\n====Photon spectrometer====\n[[File:PHOScrystal.jpg|thumb|A technology for mass production of PWO crystals has been developed in close cooperation between CERN, the Apatity plant and RRC \"Kurchatov Institute\".]]\n\nPHOS is a high-resolution electromagnetic calorimeter installed in ALICE<ref>[http://alicematters.web.cern.ch/?q=PHOSupgrade PHOS commissioning during LS1] ALICE matters, 17 May 2013. Retrieved 20 January 2019.</ref> to provide data to test the thermal and dynamical properties of the initial phase of the collision. This is done by measuring photons emerging directly from the collision. PHOS covers a limited acceptance domain at central rapidity. It is made of [[lead tungstate]] crystals,<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/alice-crystals-arrive-at-cern/ ALICE crystals arrive at CERN] ''CERN Courier'', 30 September 2002. Retrieved 20 January 2019.</ref> similar to the ones used by CMS, read out using Avalanche Photodiodes (APD).\n\nWhen high energy photons strike lead tungstate, they make it glow, or scintillate, and this glow can be measured. Lead tungstate is extremely dense (denser than iron), stopping most photons that reach it. The crystals are kept at a temperature of 248 K, which helps to minimize the deterioration of the energy resolution due to noise and to optimize the response for low energies.\n\n====Electro-Magnetic Calorimeter====\nThe EMCal is a lead-scintillator sampling calorimeter comprising almost 13,000 individual towers that are grouped into ten super-modules. The towers are read out by wavelength-shifting optical fibers in a shashlik geometry coupled to an avalanche photodiode. The complete EMCal will contain 100,000 individual scintillator tiles and 185 kilometers of optical fiber, weighing in total about 100 tons.\n\nThe EMCal covers almost the full length of the ALICE Time Projection Chamber and central detector, and a third of its azimuth placed back-to-back with the ALICE Photon Spectrometer \u2013 a smaller, highly granular lead-tungstate calorimeter.\n\nThe super-modules are inserted into an independent support frame situated within the ALICE magnet, between the time-of-flight counters and the magnet coil. The support frame itself is a complex structure: it weighs 20 tons and must support five times its own weight, with a maximum deflection between being empty and being fully loaded of only a couple of centimeters. Installation of the eight-ton super-modules requires a system of rails with a sophisticated insertion device to bridge across to the support structure.\n\nThe Electro-Magnetic Calorimeter (EM-Cal) will add greatly to the high momentum particle measurement capabilities of ALICE.<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/first-jet-measurements-with-alice/ First jet measurements with ALICE] ''CERN Courier'', 22 May 2013.</ref> It will extend ALICE's reach to study jets and other hard processes.\n\n====Photon Multiplicity Detector====\nThe Photon Multiplicity Detector (PMD) is a Particle shower detector which measures the multiplicity and spatial distribution of photons produced in the collisions.<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/indian-detector-stars-at-brookhaven/ Indian detector stars at Brookhaven] ''CERN Courier'', 5 September 2004.</ref> It utilizes as a first layer a veto detector to reject charged particles. Photons on the other hand pass through a converter, initiating an electromagnetic shower in a second detector layer where they produce large signals on several cells of its sensitive volume. Hadrons on the other hand normally affect only one cell and produce a signal representing minimum-ionizing particles.\n\n====Forward Multiplicity Detector====\n[[File:FMD 1.jpg|thumb|ALICE Forward Multiplicity Detector]]\n\nThe Forward Multiplicity Detector (FMD) extends the coverage for multiplicity of charge particles into the forward regions - giving ALICE the widest coverage of the 4 LHC experiments for these measurements.<ref>[http://fmd.nbi.dk ALICE Forward Detectors] Retrieved 20 January 2019.</ref>\n\nThe FMD consist of 5 large silicon discs with each 10&thinsp;240 individual detector channels to measure the charged particles emitted at small angles relative to the beam. FMD provides an independent measurement of the orientation of the collisions in the vertical plane, which can be used with measurements from the barrel detector to investigate flow, jets, etc.\n\n====Muon spectrometer====\nThe ALICE forward muon spectrometer studies the complete spectrum of heavy quarkonia (J/\u03a8, \u03a8\u2032, \u03d2, \u03d2\u2032, \u03d2\u2032\u2032) via their decay in the \u03bc+\u03bc\u2013 channel. Heavy quarkonium states, provide an essential tool to study the early and hot stage of heavy-ion collisions.<ref>[http://aliceinfo.cern.ch/Public/en/Chapter2/Chap2_dim_spec.html ALICE Dimuon Spectrometer] Retrieved 20 January 2019.</ref> In particular they are expected to be sensitive to Quark-Gluon Plasma formation. In the presence of a deconfined medium (i.e. QGP) with high enough energy density, quarkonium states are dissociated because of colour screening. This leads to a suppression of their production rates. At the high LHC collision energy, both the charmonium states (J/\u03a8 and \u03a8\u2032) as well as the bottomonium states (\u03d2, \u03d2\u2032 and \u03d2\u2032\u2032) can be studied. The Dimuon spectrometer is optimized for the detection of these heavy quark resonances.\n\n[[File:Dimuon1 small.gif|thumb|The main components of the ALICE muon spectrometer: an absorber to filter the background, a set of tracking chambers before, inside and after the magnet and a set of trigger chambers.]]\n\nMuons may be identified using the just described technique by using the fact that they are the only charged particles able to pass almost undisturbed through any material. This behaviour is connected to the fact that muons with momenta below a few hundred GeV/c do not suffer from radiative energy losses and so do not produce electromagnetic showers. Also, because they are leptons, they are not subject to strong interactions with the nuclei of the material they traverse. This behaviour is exploited in muon spectrometers in high-energy physics experiments by installing muon detectors behind the calorimeter systems or behind thick absorber materials. All charged particles other than muons are completely stopped, producing electromagnetic (and hadronic) showers.\n\nThe muon spectrometer in the forward region of ALICE features a very thick and complex front absorber and an additional muon filter consisting of an iron wall 1.2 m thick. Muon candidates selected from tracks penetrating these absorbers are measured precisely in a dedicated set of tracking detectors. Pairs of muons are used to collect the spectrum of heavy-quark vector-meson resonances (J/Psi). Their production rates can be analysed as a function of transverse momentum and collision centrality in order to investigate dissociation due to colour screening. The acceptance of the ALICE Muon Spectrometer covers the pseudorapidity interval 2.5 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 4 and the resonances can be detected down to zero transverse momentum.\n\n===Characterization of the collision===\nFinally, we need to know how powerful the collision was: this is done by measuring the remnants of the colliding nuclei in detectors made of high density materials located about 110 meters on both sides of ALICE (the ZDCs) and by measuring with the FMD, V0 and T0 the number of particles produced in the collision and their spatial distribution. T0 also measures with high precision the time when the event takes place.\n\n====Zero Degree Calorimeter====\n[[File:ALICE ZDC3.jpg|thumb|Front face of the ZN calorimeter: One of the two ZN calorimeters during assembly. The quartz fibers are hosted in the 1936 grooves of the W-alloy slabs.]]\n\nThe ZDCs are calorimeters which detect the energy of the spectator nucleons in order to determine the overlap region of the two colliding nuclei. It is composed of four calorimeters, two to detect protons (ZP) and two to detect neutrons (ZN). They are located 115 meters away from the interaction point on both sides, exactly along the beam line. The ZN is placed at zero degree with respect to the LHC beam axis, between the two beam pipes. That is why we call them Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDC).The ZP is positioned externally to the outgoing beam pipe. The spectator protons are separated from the ion beams by means of the dipole magnet D1.\n\nThe ZDCs are \"spaghetti calorimeters\", made by a stack of heavy metal plates grooved to allocate a matrix of quartz fibres. Their principle of operation is based on the detection of Cherenkov light produced by the charged particles of the shower in the fibers.\n\n====V0 detector====\nV0 is made of two arrays of scintillator counters set on both sides of the ALICE interaction point, and called V0-A and V0-C. The V0-C counter is located upstream of the dimuon arm absorber and cover the spectrometer acceptance while the V0-A counter will be located at around 3.5 m away from the collision vertex, on the other side.\n\nIt is used to estimate the centrality of the collision by summing up the energy deposited in the two disks of V0. This observable scales directly with the number of primary particles generated in the collision and therefore to the centrality.\n\nV0 is also used as reference in Van Der Meer scans that give the size and shape of colliding beams and therefore the luminosity delivered to the experiment.\n\n====T0 detector====\n[[File:T0det.png|thumb|An array of Cherenkov counters used in the ALICE T0 detector.]]\nALICE T0 serves as a start, trigger and luminosity detector for ALICE. The accurate interaction time (START) serves as the reference signal for the Time-of-Flight detector that is used for particle identification. T0 supplies five different trigger signals to the Central Trigger Processor. The most important of these is the T0 vertex providing prompt and accurate confirmation of the location of the primary interaction point along the beam axis within the set boundaries. The detector is also used for online luminosity monitoring providing fast feedback to the accelerator team.\n\nThe T0 detector consists of two arrays of [[Cherenkov radiation|Cherenkov]] counters (T0-C and T0-A) positioned at the opposite sides of the interaction point (IP). Each array has 12 cylindrical counters equipped with a quartz radiator and a photomultiplier tube.\n\n===ALICE Cosmic Rays Detector (ACORDE)===\nThe ALICE cavern provides an ideal place for the detection of high energy atmospheric muons coming from cosmic ray showers. ACORDE detects cosmic ray showers by triggering the arrival of muons to the top of the ALICE magnet.\n\nThe ALICE cosmic ray trigger is made of 60 scintillator modules distributed on the 3 upper faces of the ALICE magnet yoke. The array can be configured to trigger on single or multi-muon events, from 2-fold coincidences up to the whole array if desired. ACORDE's high luminosity allows the recording of cosmic events with very high multiplicity of parallel muon tracks, the so-called muon bundles.\n\nWith ACORDE, the ALICE Experiment has been able to detect muon bundles with the highest multiplicity ever registered as well as to indirectly measure very high energy primary cosmic rays {{cn|date=July 2015}}.\n\n==Data acquisition==\nALICE had to design a data acquisition system that operates efficiently in two widely different running modes: the very frequent but small events, with few produced particles encountered during proton-proton collisions and the relatively rare, but extremely large events, with tens of thousands of new particles produced in lead-lead collisions at the LHC (L = 10<sup>27</sup> cm<sup>\u22122</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup> in Pb-Pb with 100 ns bunch crossings and L = 10<sup>30</sup>-10<sup>31</sup> cm<sup>\u22122</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup> in pp with 25 ns bunch crossings).<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/meeting-the-alice-data-challenge/ Meeting the ALICE data challenge] ''CERN Courier'', 27 June 2000.</ref>\n\nThe ALICE data acquisition system needs to balance its capacity to record the steady stream of very large events resulting from central collisions, with an ability to select and record rare cross-section processes. These requirements result in an aggregate event building bandwidth of up to 2.5 GByte/s and a storage capability of up to 1.25 GByte/s, giving a total of more than 1 PByte of data every year. As shown in the figure, ALICE needs a data storage capacity that by far exceeds that of the current generation of experiments. This data rate is equivalent to six times the contents of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica every second.\n\nThe hardware of the ALICE DAQ system<ref>[http://aliceinfo.cern.ch/Public/en/Chapter2/Chap2_DAQ.html ALICE Data Acquisition] Retrieved 20 January 2019.</ref> is largely based on commodity components: PC's running Linux and standard Ethernet switches for the eventbuilding network. The required performances are achieved by the interconnection of hundreds of these PC's into a large DAQ fabric. The software framework of the ALICE DAQ is called DATE (ALICE Data Acquisition and Test Environment). DATE is already in use today, during the construction and testing phase of the experiment, while evolving gradually towards the final production system. Moreover, AFFAIR (A Flexible Fabric and Application Information Recorder) is the performance monitoring software developed by the ALICE Data Acquisition project. AFFAIR is largely based on open source code and is composed of the following components: data gathering, inter-node communication employing DIM, fast and temporary round robin database storage, and permanent storage and plot generation using ROOT.\n\nFinally. the ALICE experiment Mass Storage System (MSS) combines a very high bandwidth (1.25 GByte/s) and every year stores huge amounts of data, more than 1 Pbytes. The mass storage system is made of: a) Global Data Storage (GDS) performing the temporary storage of data at the experimental pit; b) Permanent Data Storage (PDS) for long-term archive of data in the CERN Computing Center and finally from The Mass Storage System software managing the creation, the access and the archive of data.\n\n==Results==\n[[File:1011252 11-A4-at-144-dpi.jpg|thumb|Events recorded by the ALICE experiment from the first lead ion collisions, at a centre-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV per nucleon pair.]]\n\nThe physics programme of ALICE includes the following main topics: i) the study of the thermalization of partons in the QGP with focus on the massive charming beauty quarks and understanding the behaviour of these heavy quarks in relation to the stroungly-coupled medium of QGP, ii) the study of the mechanisms of energy loss that occur in the medium and the dependencies of energy loss on the parton species, iii) the dissociation of quarkonium states which can be a probe of deconfinement and of the temperature of the medium and finally the production of thermal photons and low-mass dileptons emitted by the QGP which is about assessing the initial temperature and degrees of freedom of the systems as well as the chiral nature of the phase transition.\n\nThe ALICE collaboration presented its first results from LHC proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV in March 2010.<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/alice-reveals-first-results-at-7-tev/ ALICE presents first results at 7 TeV] ''CERN Courier'', 7 June 2010.</ref> The results confirmed that the charged-particle multiplicity is rising with energy faster than expected while the shape of the multiplicity distribution is not reproduced well by standard simulations. The results were based on the analysis of a sample of 300,000 proton\u2013proton collisions the ALICE experiment collected during the first runs of the LHC with stable beams at a centre-of-mass energy, \u221as, of 7 TeV,\n\nIn 2011, the ALICE Collaboration measured the size of the system created in Pb-Pb collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV per nucleon pair.<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/alice-collaboration-measures-the-size-of-the-fireball-in-heavy-ion-collisions/ ALICE Collaboration measures the size of the fireball in heav-ion collisions] ''CERN Courier'', 3 May 2011.</ref> ALICE confirmed that the QCD matter created in Pb-Pb collisions behaves like a fluid, with strong collective motions that are well described by hydrodynamic equations. The fireball formed in nuclear collisions at the LHC is hotter, lives longer and expands to a larger size than the medium that was formed in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC. Multiplicity measurements by the ALICE experiment show that the system initially has much higher energy density and is at least 30% hotter than at RHIC, resulting in about double the particle multiplicity for each colliding nucleon pair (Aamodt et al. 2010a).  Further analyses, in particular including the full dependence of these observables on centrality, will provide more insights into the properties of the system \u2013 such as initial velocities, the equation of state and the fluid viscosity \u2013 and strongly constrain the theoretical modelling of heavy-ion collisions.\n\n===A perfect liquid at the LHC===\nOff-centre nuclear collisions, with a finite impact parameter, create a strongly asymmetric \"almond-shaped\" fireball. However, experiments cannot measure the spatial dimensions of the interaction (except in special cases, for example in the production of pions, see<ref>[http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/46055l ALICE enters new territory in heavy-ion collisions]{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[CERN Courier]], 25 January 2012</ref>). Instead, they measure the momentum distributions of the emitted particles. A correlation between the measured azimuthal momentum distribution of particles emitted from the decaying fireball and the initial spatial asymmetry can arise only from multiple interactions between the constituents of the created matter; in other words it tells us about how the matter flows, which is related to its equation of state and its thermodynamic transport properties.<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/hadron-spectra-probe-nature-of-matter-in-pb-pb-collisions/ Hadron spectra probe nature of matter in Pb-Pb collisions], ''[[CERN Courier]]'', 25 January 2012.</ref>\n\nThe measured azimuthal distribution of particles in momentum space can be decomposed into Fourier coefficients. The second Fourier coefficient (v2), called elliptic flow, is particularly sensitive to the internal friction or viscosity of the fluid, or more precisely, \u03b7/s, the ratio of the shear viscosity (\u03b7) to entropy (s) of the system. For a good fluid such as water, the \u03b7/s ratio is small. A \"thick\" liquid, such as honey, has large values of \u03b7/s.\n\nIn heavy-ion collisions at the LHC, the ALICE collaboration found that the hot matter created in the collision behaves like a fluid with little friction, with \u03b7/s close to its lower limit (almost zero viscosity). With these measurements, ALICE has just begun to explore the temperature dependence of \u03b7/s and we anticipate many more in-depth flow-related measurements at the LHC that will constrain the hydrodynamic features of the QGP even further.\n\n===Measuring the highest temperature on Earth===\nIn August 2012, ALICE scientists announced that their experiments produced [[quark\u2013gluon plasma]] with temperature at around 5.5 trillion [[kelvin]]s, the highest temperature mass achieved in any physical experiments thus far.<ref>[https://www.yahoo.com/news/blogs/technology-blog/cern-scientists-create-highest-temperature-mass-humanity-ever-034111958.html CERN scientists create the highest temperature mass humanity has ever seen], [[Yahoo!

The quark\u2013gluon plasma produced by these experiments approximates the conditions in the universe that existed microseconds after the [[Big Bang]], before the matter coalesced into [[atom]]s.<ref>Will Ferguson, [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22173-lhc-primordial-matter-is-hottest-stuff-ever-made/ LHC primordial matter is hottest stuff ever made], ''[[New Scientist]]'', 14 August 2012.</ref>\n\n===Energy loss===\nA basic process in QCD is the energy loss of a fast parton in a medium composed of colour charges. This phenomenon, \"jet quenching\", is especially useful in the study of the QGP, using the naturally occurring products (jets) of the hard scattering of quarks and gluons from the incoming nuclei. A highly energetic parton (a colour charge) probes the coloured medium rather like an X-ray probes ordinary matter. The production of these partonic probes in hadronic collisions is well understood within perturbative QCD. The theory also shows that a parton traversing the medium will lose a fraction of its energy in emitting many soft (low energy) gluons. The amount of the radiated energy is proportional to the density of the medium and to the square of the path length travelled by the parton in the medium. Theory also predicts that the energy loss depends on the flavour of the parton.\n\nJet quenching was first observed at RHIC by measuring the yields of hadrons with high transverse momentum. These particles are produced via fragmentation of energetic partons. The yields of these high-pT particles in central nucleus\u2013nucleus collisions were found to be a factor of five lower than expected from the measurements in proton\u2013proton reactions. ALICE has recently published the measurement of charged particles in central heavy-ion collisions at the LHC. As at RHIC, the production of high-pT hadrons at the LHC is strongly suppressed. However, the observations at the LHC show qualitatively new features. The observation from ALICE is consistent with reports from the ATLAS and CMS collaborations on direct evidence for parton energy loss within heavy-ion collisions using fully reconstructed back-to-back jets of particles associated with hard parton scatterings.<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/alice-tracks-charm-energy-loss-in-the-qgp/ ALICE tracks charm energy loss] ''CERN Courier'', 31 May 2012.</ref> The latter two experiments have shown a strong energy imbalance between the jet and its recoiling partner (G Aad et al. 2010 and CMS collaboration 2011). This imbalance is thought to arise because one of the jets traversed the hot and dense matter, transferring a substantial fraction of its energy to the medium in a way that is not recovered by the reconstruction of the jets.\n\n===Studying quarkonium hadroproduction===\nQuarkonia are bound states of heavy flavour quarks (charm or bottom) and their antiquarks. Two types of quarkonia have been extensively studied: charmonia, which consist of a charm quark and an anti-charm, and bottomonia made of a bottom and an anti-bottom quark. Charm and anticharm quarks in the presence of the Quark Gluon Plasma, in which there are many free colour charges, are not able to see each other any more and therefore they cannot form bound states. The \"melting\" of quarkonia into the QGP manifests itself in the suppression of the quarkonium yields compared to the production without the presence of the QGP. The search for quarkonia suppression as a QGP signature started 25 years ago. The first ALICE results for charm hadrons in PbPb collisions at a centre-of-mass energy \u221asNN = 2.76 TeV indicate strong in-medium energy loss for charm and strange quarks that is an indication of the formation of the hot medium of QGP.<ref>[http://alicematters.web.cern.ch/?q=ALICE_Quarkonium Studying Quarkonium hadroproduction with ALICE] ALICE Matters, 20 August 2013. Retrieved 20 January 2019.</ref>\n\nAs the temperature increases so does the colour screening resulting in greater suppression of the quarkonium states as it is more difficult for charm \u2013 anticharm or bottom \u2013 antibottom to form new bound states. At very high temperatures no quarkonium states are expected to survive; they melt in the QGP. Quarkonium sequential suppression is therefore considered as a QGP thermometer, as states with different masses have different sizes and are expected to be screened and dissociated at different temperatures. However - as the collision energy increases - so does the number of charm-anticharm quarks that can form bound states, and a balancing mechanism of recombination of quarkonia may appear as we move to higher energies.\n\nThe results from the first ALICE run are rather striking, when compared with the observations from lower energies. While a similar suppression is observed at LHC energies for peripheral collisions, when moving towards more head-on collisions \u2013 as quantified by the increasing number of nucleons in the lead nuclei participating in the interaction \u2013 the suppression no longer increases. Therefore, despite the higher temperatures attained in the nuclear collisions at the LHC, more J/\u03c8 mesons are detected by the ALICE experiment in Pb\u2013Pb with respect to p\u2013p. Such an effect is likely to be related to a regeneration process occurring at the temperature boundary between the QGP and a hot gas of hadrons.\n\nThe suppression of charmonium states was also observed in proton-lead collisions at the LHC, in which Quark Gluon Plasma is not formed. This suggests that the observed suppression in proton-nucleus collisions (pA) is due to cold nuclear matter effects. Grasping the wealth of experimental results requires understanding the medium modification of quarkonia and disentangling hot and cold-matter effects. Today there is a large amount of data available from RHIC and LHC on charmonium and bottomonium suppression and ALICE tries to distinguish between effects due to the formation of the QGP and those from cold nuclear matter effects.\n\n===Double-ridge structure in p-Pb collisions===\n[[File:Test8.png|thumb|ALICE records first proton-lead collisions at the LHC]]\n\nThe analysis of the data from the p-Pb collisions at the LHC revealed a completely unexpected double-ridge structure with so far unknown origin. The proton\u2013lead (pPb) collisions in 2013, two years after its heavy-ion collisions opened a new chapter in exploration of the properties of the deconfined, chirally symmetrical state of the QGP. A surprising near-side, long-range (elongated in pseudorapidity) correlation, forming a ridge-like structure observed in high-multiplicity pp collisions, was also found in high-multiplicity pPb collisions, but with a much larger amplitude (<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/alice-and-atlas-find-intriguing-double-ridge-in-proton-lead-collisions/ ALICE and ATLAS find intriguing double ridge in proton-lead collisions] ''CERN Courier'', 20 February 2013.</ref>). However, the biggest surprise came from the observation that this near-side ridge is accompanied by an essentially symmetrical away-side ridge, opposite in azimuth (CERN Courier March 2013 p6). This double ridge was revealed after the short-range correlations arising from jet fragmentation and resonance decays were suppressed by subtracting the correlation distribution measured for low-multiplicity events from the one for high-multiplicity events.\n\nSimilar long-range structures in heavy-ion collisions have been attributed to the collective flow of particles emitted from a thermalized system undergoing a collective hydrodynamic expansion. This anisotropy can be characterized by means of the vn (n = 2, 3, ...) coefficients of a Fourier decomposition of the single-particle azimuthal distribution. To test the possible presence of collective phenomena further, the ALICE collaboration has extended the two-particle correlation analysis to identified particles, checking for a potential mass ordering of the v2 harmonic coefficients. Such an ordering in mass was observed in heavy-ion collisions, where it was interpreted to arise from a common radial boost \u2013 the so-called radial flow \u2013 coupled to the anisotropy in momentum space. Continuing the surprises, a clear particle-mass ordering, similar to the one observed in mid-central PbPb collisions (CERN Courier, September 2013), has been measured in high-multiplicity pPb collisions.\n\nThe final surprise, so far, comes from the charmonium states. Whereas J/\u03c8 production does not reveal any unexpected behaviour, the production of the heavier and less-bound (2S) state indicates a strong suppression (0.5\u20130.7) with respect to J/\u03c8, when compared with pp collisions. Is this a hint of effects of the medium? Indeed, in heavy-ion collisions, such a suppression has been interpreted as a sequential melting of quarkonia states, depending on their binding energy and the temperature of the QGP created in these collisions.\n\nThe first pPb measurement campaign, expected results were widely accompanied by unanticipated observations. Among the expected results is the confirmation that proton\u2013nucleus collisions provide an appropriate tool to study the partonic structure of cold nuclear matter in detail. The surprises have come from the similarity of several observables between pPb and PbPb collisions, which hint at the existence of collective phenomena in pPb collisions with high particle multiplicity and, eventually, the formation of QGP.<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/alice-is-cold-nuclear-matter-really-cold/ Is Cold nuclear matter really cold?] ''CERN Courier'', 24 February 2014. </ref>\n\n==Upgrades and future plans==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Long Shutdown 1===\nThe main upgrade activity on ALICE during LHC's Long Shutdown 1 was the installation of the dijet calorimeter (DCAL), an extension of the existing EMCAL system that adds 60\u00b0 of azimuthal acceptance opposite the existing 120\u00b0 of the EMCAL's acceptance. This new subdetector will be installed on the bottom of the solenoid magnet, which currently houses three modules of the photon spectrometer (PHOS). Moreover, an entirely new rail system and cradle will be installed to support the three PHOS modules and eight DCAL modules, which together weigh more than 100 tones. The installation of five modules of the TRD will follow and so complete this complex detector system, which consists of 18 units,\n\nIn addition to these mainstream detector activities, all of the 18 ALICE subdetectors underwent major improvements during LS1 while the computers and discs of the online systems are replaced, followed by upgrades of the operating systems and online software.\n\nAll of these efforts are to ensure that ALICE is in good shape for the three-year LHC running period after LS1, when the collaboration looks forward to heavy-ion collisions at the top LHC energy of 5.5 TeV/nucleon at luminosities in excess of 1027&nbsp;Hz/cm<sup>2</sup>.\n\n===Long shutdown 2 (2018)===\nThe ALICE collaboration has plans for a major upgrade during the next long shutdown, LS2, currently scheduled for 2018. Then the entire silicon tracker will be replaced by a monolithic-pixel tracker system built from ALPIDE chips; the time-projection chamber will be upgraded with gaseous electron-multiplier (GEM) detectors for continuous read-out and the use of new microelectronics; and all of the other subdetectors and the online systems will prepare for a 100-fold increase in the number of events written to tape.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikipedia books|Large Hadron Collider}}\n*[http://aliceinfo.cern.ch/Public/Welcome.html Official ALICE Public Webpage] at CERN\n*[http://alice.g-php.com/#banner Interactive Timeline for ALICE 20th anniversary]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120112202708/http://www.uslhc.us/What_is_the_LHC/Experiments/ALICE ALICE section on US/LHC Website]\n*{{cite journal|year=2008|title=The ALICE experiment at the CERN LHC|journal=[[Journal of Instrumentation]]|volume=3|issue=8|pages=S08002|doi=10.1088/1748-0221/3/08/S08002|bibcode=2008JInst...3S8002A|last1=Aamodt|first1=K.|collaboration=The ALICE Collaboration|displayauthors=etal|doi-access=free}}\n\n{{CERN}}\n\n[[Category:CERN experiments]]\n[[Category:Large Hadron Collider]]\n", "text_old": "{{coord|46|15|04.8|N|6|01|12.5|E|type:landmark|display=title}}\n{{Infobox organization\n|name=ALICE, A Large Ion Collider Experiment \n|image        = ALICE all.jpg\n|caption      = Overall view of the ALICE detector\n|headquarters = [[Geneva]], Switzerland\n|leader_title = List of ALICE Spokespersons\n|leader_name  = [[Luciano Musa]] <br/> [[Federico Antinori]] <br/> [[Paolo Giubellino]] <br/> [[Jurgen Schukraft]]\n|formation    =Letter of Intent submitted in July 1993\n|website      = http://aliceinfo.cern.ch/\n}}\n{{LHC}}\n'''ALICE''' ('''A Large Ion Collider Experiment''') is one of eight [[Particle detector|detector]] experiments at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] at [[CERN]].

The resulting temperature and energy density allow exploration of of [[quark\u2013gluon plasma]], a fifth state of matter wherein [[quark]]s and [[gluon]]s are freed. Similar conditions are believed to have existed a fraction of the second after the Big Bang before quarks and gluons bound together to form [[hadrons]] and heavier particles.<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/alice-through-the-phase-transition/ ALICE through the phase transition], ''CERN Courier'', 30 October 2000.</ref>\n\nALICE is focusing on the physics of strongly interacting matter at extreme energy densities. The properties of the [[quark\u2013gluon plasma]] and the understanding of quark [[deconfinement]] are key issues in [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD). The results obtained by ALICE corroborate the understanding of [[color confinement]] and [[chiral symmetry]] restoration. Recreating the primordial form of matter, [[Quark\u2013gluon plasma|quark-gluon plasma]], and understanding how it evolves is expected to shed light on questions about how matter is organized, the mechanism that confines quarks and gluons and the nature of strong interactions and how they result in generating the bulk of the mass of ordinary matter.\n\nQuantum chromodynamics (QCD) predicts that at sufficiently high energy densities there will be a phase transition from conventional hadronic matter, where quarks are locked inside nuclear particles, to a plasma of deconfined quarks and gluons. The reverse of this transition is believed to have taken place when the universe was just 10<sup>\u22126</sup> s old, and may still play a role today in the hearts of collapsing neutron stars or other astrophysical objects.<ref>Panos Charito, [http://alicematters.web.cern.ch/?q=Rajagopal Interview with Krishna Rajacopal], ALICE Matters, 15 April 2013.

From the ideas presented there, the ALICE collaboration was formed and in 1993, a LoI was submitted.<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/alice-new-kid-on-the-block-archive/ ALICE New Kid on the block] ''CERN Courier'', 19 September 2008.</ref>\n\nALICE was first proposed as a central detector in 1993 and later complemented by an additional forward muon spectrometer designed in 1995. In 1997, ALICE received the green light from the LHC Committee to proceed towards final design and construction.<ref>[https://timeline.web.cern.ch/events/alice-experiment-approved ALICE Experiment approved] CERN timeline. 14 February 1997. Retrieved 20 January 2019.</ref>\n\nThe first ten years were spent on design and an extensive R&D effort. Like for all other LHC experiments, it became clear from the outset that also the challenges of heavy ion physics at LHC could not be really met (nor paid for) with existing technology. Significant advances, and in some cases a technological break-through, would be required to build on the ground what physicists had dreamed up on paper for their experiments. The initially very broad and later more focused, well organised and well supported R&D effort, which was sustained over most of the 1990s, has led to many evolutionary and some revolutionary advances in detectors, electronics and computing.\n\nDesigning a dedicated heavy-ion experiment in the early '90s for use at the LHC some 15 years later posed some daunting challenges. The detector had to be general purpose - able to measure most signals of potential interest, even if their relevance may only become apparent later - and flexible, allowing additions and modifications along the way as new avenues of investigation would open up. In both respects ALICE did quite well, as it included a number of observables in its initial menu whose importance only became clear later. Various major detection system were added, from the muon spectrometer in 1995, the transition radiation detectors in 1999 to a large jet calorimeter added in 2007.\n\nALICE recorded data from the first lead-lead collisions at the LHC in 2010. Data sets taken during heavy-ion periods in 2010 and 2011 as well as proton-lead data from 2013 have provided an excellent basis for an in-depth look at the physics of quark\u2013gluon plasma.\n\n{{as of|2014}} After more than three years of successful operation, the ALICE detector is about to undergo a major programme of consolidation and upgrade during the long shutdown [LS1] of CERN's accelerator complex. A new subdetector called the dijet calorimeter (DCAL) will be installed, and all 18 of the existing ALICE subdetectors will be upgraded. There will also be major renovation work on the ALICE infrastructure, including the electrical and cooling systems. The wealth of published scientific results and the very intense upgrade programme of ALICE have attracted numerous institutes and scientists from all over the world.

The LHC, with a centre-of-mass energy around 5.5 TeV/nucleon, will push the energy reach even further.\n\nDuring head-on collisions of lead ions at the LHC, hundreds of protons and neutrons smash into one another at energies of upwards of a few TeVs. Lead ions are accelerated to more than 99.9999% of the speed of light and collisions at the LHC are 100 times more energetic than those of protons - heating up matter in the interaction point to a temperature almost 100,000 times higher than the temperature in the core of the sun.\n\nWhen the two lead nuclei slam into each other, matter undergoes a transition to form for a brief instant a droplet of primordial matter, the so-called [[quark\u2013gluon plasma]] which is believed to have filled the universe a few microseconds after the Big Bang.\n\nThe [[quark\u2013gluon plasma]] is formed as protons and neutrons \"melt\" into their elementary constituents, [[quarks]] and [[gluons]] become asymptotically free. The droplet of QGP instantly cools, and the individual quarks and gluons (collectively called [[partons]]) recombine into a blizzard of ordinary matter that speeds away in all directions.<ref>[http://alicematters.web.cern.ch/?q=UrsWiedemann Interview with CERN's theorist Urs Wiedemann] ALICE Matters, 13 July 2012</ref> The debris contains particles such as [[pions]] and [[kaons]], which are made of a [[quark]] and an [[antiquark]]; [[protons]] and [[neutrons]], made of three quarks; and even copious [[antiprotons]] and [[antineutron]]s, which may combine to form the nuclei of [[antiatom]]s as heavy as helium. Much can be learned by studying the distribution and energy of this debris.\n\n===First lead-lead collisions===\n[[File:Alicelead3.jpg|thumb|One of the LHC's first lead-ion collisions, as recorded by the ALICE detector.]]\nThe Large Hadron Collider smashed its first lead ions in 2010, on 7 November at around 12:30&nbsp;a.m. CET.<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/lhc-begins-physics-with-lead-ions/ LHC begins physics with lead ions] ''CERN Courier'', 30 November 2010.</ref><ref>[https://cerncourier.com/first-ions-for-alice-and-rings-for-lhcb/ First ions for ALICE and rings for LHCb] ''CERN Courier'', 30 October 2009.</ref>\n\nThe first collisions in the center of the ALICE, ATLAS and CMS detectors took place less than 72 hours after the LHC ended its first run of protons and switched to accelerating lead-ion beams. Each lead nucleus contains 82 protons, and the LHC accelerates each proton to an energy of 3.5 TeV, thus resulting in an energy of 287 TeV per beam, or a total collision energy of 574 TeV.\n\nUp to 3,000 charged particles were emitted from each collision, shown here as lines radiating from the collision point. The colors of the lines indicate how much energy each particle carried away from the collision.\n\n===Proton-lead collisions at the LHC===\n[[File:ALICE pPb event.jpg|thumb|Proton-Lead ion collision recorded by the ALICE Experiment on 13 September 2012 at a center of mass energy per colliding nucleon-nucleon pair of 5.02 TeV.]]\nIn 2013, the [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]] collided protons with lead ions for the LHC's first physics beams of 2013.<ref>[http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/breaking/2010/11/08/first-lead-ion-collisions-in-the-lhc First lead-ion collisions in the LHC] Symmetry Magazine, 8 November 2010.</ref> The experiment was conducted by counter-rotating beams of ''protons'' and ''lead ions'', and begun with centred orbits with different revolution frequencies, and then separately ramped to the accelerator's maximum collision energy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.web.cern.ch/about/updates/2013/01/protons-smash-lead-ions-first-lhc-collisions-2013|title=Protons smash lead ions in first LHC collisions of 2013|date=22 January 2013|author=Cian O'Luanaigh}}</ref>\n\nThe first lead-proton run at the LHC lasted for one month and data help ALICE physicists to decouple the effects of the plasma from effects that stem from cold nuclear matter effects and shed more light on the study of the Quark-Gluon plasma.\n\nIn the case of lead-lead collisions, the configurations of the quarks and gluons that make up the protons and neutrons of the incoming lead nucleus can be somewhat different of those in the incoming protons. In order to study if part of the effects we see when comparing lead-lead and proton-proton collisions is due to this configuration difference rather than the formation of the plasma. Proton-lead collisions are an ideal tool for this study.\n\n==The ALICE detectors==\nA key design consideration of ALICE is the ability to study QCD and quark (de)confinement under these extreme conditions. This is done by using particles, created inside the hot volume as it expands and cools down, that live long enough to reach the sensitive detector layers situated around the interaction region. ALICE's physics programme relies on being able to identify all of them, i.e. to determine if they are electrons, photons, pions, etc. and to determine their charge. This involves making the most of the (sometimes slightly) different ways that particles interact with matter.<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/particle-identification-in-alice-boosts-qgp-studies/ Particle identification in ALICE boosts QGP studies] ''CERN Courier'', 23 August 2012.</ref>\n\nIn a \"traditional\" experiment, particles are identified or at least assigned to families (charged or neutral [[hadron]]s), by the characteristic signatures they leave in the detector. The experiment is divided into a few main components and each component tests a specific set of particle properties. These components are stacked in layers and the particles go through the layers sequentially from the collision point outwards: first a tracking system, then an electromagnetic (EM) and a hadronic calorimeter and finally a muon system. The detectors are embedded in a [[magnetic field]] in order to bend the tracks of charged [[particles]] for [[momentum]] and [[Electric charge|charge]] determination. This method for particle identification works well only for certain particles, and is used for example by the large [[LHC]] experiments [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]] and [[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]]. However, this technique is not suitable for hadron identification as it doesn't allow distinguishing the different charged hadrons that are produced in Pb-Pb collisions.\n\nIn order to identify all the particles that are coming out of the system of the QGP ALICE is using a set of 18 detectors<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/alice-forges-ahead-with-detector-installation/ ALICE forges ahead with detector installation] ''CERN Courier'', 6 December 2006.</ref> that give information about the mass, the velocity and the electrical sign of the particles.\n\n===Barrel tracking===\nAn ensemble of cylindrical barrel detectors that surround the nominal interaction point is used to track all the particles that fly out of the hot, dense medium. The Inner Tracking System(ITS) (consisting of three layers of detectors: Silicon Pixel Detector(SPD), Silicon Drift Detector(SDD), Silicon Strip Detector(SSD)), the Time Projection Chamber(TPC) and the Transition Radiation Detector(TRD) measure at many points the passage of each particle carrying an electric charge and give precise information about the particle's trajectory. The ALICE barrel tracking detectors are embedded in a magnetic field of 0.5 Tesla produced by a huge magnetic solenoid bending the trajectories of the particles. From the curvature of the tracks one can derive their momentum. The ITS is so precise that particles which are generated by the decay of other particles with a long(~.1&nbsp;mm before decay) life time can be identified by seeing that they do not originate from the point where the interaction has taken place (the \"[[Interaction point|vertex]]\" of the event) but rather from a point at a distance of as small as a tenth of a millimeter. This allows us to measure, for example, bottom quarks which decay into a relatively long-lived B-meson through \"topological\" cuts.\n\n====Inner Tracking System====\n[[File:ALICE ITS.jpg|thumb|Installation of the ALICE Inner Tracking System]]\n\nThe short-living heavy particles cover a very small distance before decaying. This system aims at identifying these phenomena of decay by measuring the location where it occurs with a precision of a tenth of millimetre.<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/the-inner-tracking-system-arrives-at-the-heart-of-alice/ The Inner Tracking System arrives at the heart of ALICE] ''CERN Courier'', 4 June 2007.</ref>\n\nThe Inner Tracking System (ITS) consists of six cylindrical layers of [[silicon detector]]s. The layers surround the collision point and measure the properties of the particles emerging from the collisions, pin-pointing their position of passage to a fraction of a millimetre.<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/pixels-make-for-perfect-particle-tracking-in-alice/ Pixels make for perfect particle tracking in ALICE] ''CERN Courier'', 8 July 2008.</ref> With the help of the ITS, particles containing heavy [[quarks]] (charm and beauty) can be identified by reconstructing the coordinates at which they decay.\n\nITS layers (counting from the interaction point):\n*2 layers of [http://aliceinfo.cern.ch/Public/en/Chapter2/Chap2_SPD.html SPD] ([[Hybrid pixel detector|Silicon Pixel Detector]]),\n*2 layers of SDD ([[Silicon Drift Detector]]),\n*2 layers of SSD ([http://cms.web.cern.ch/news/silicon-strips Silicon Strip Detector]).\n\nThe ITS was inserted at the heart of the ALICE experiment in March 2007 following a large phase of R&D. Using the smallest amounts of the lightest material, the ITS has been made as lightweight and delicate as possible. With almost 5\u2009m<sup>2</sup> of double-sided silicon strip detectors and more than 1\u2009m<sup>2</sup> of silicon drift detectors, it is the largest system using both types of silicon detector.\n\nALICE has recently presented plans for an upgraded Inner Tracking System, mainly based on building a new silicon tracker with greatly improved features in terms of determination of the impact parameter (d0) to the primary vertex, tracking efficiency at low pT and readout rate capabilities.<ref>Luciano Musa, [http://alicematters.web.cern.ch/?q=ALICE_ITSUpgrade Upgrade of the ALICE ITS] ALICE Matters, 5 December 2012. Retrieved 20 January 2019.</ref> The upgraded ITS will open new channels in the study of the Quark Gluon Plasma formed at LHC which are necessary in order to understand the dynamics of this condensed phase of the QCD.\n\nIt will allow the study of the process of thermalization of [[heavy quarks]] in the medium by measuring heavy flavour charmed and beauty [[baryons]] and extending these measurements down to very low p<sub>T</sub> for the first time. It will also give a better understanding of the quark mass dependence of in-medium energy loss and offer a unique capability of measuring the beauty quarks while also improving the beauty decay vertex reconstruction. Finally, the upgraded ITS will give us the chance to characterize the thermal radiation coming from the [[QGP]] and the in-medium modification of [[hadronic]] spectral functions as related to [[Chirality (physics)|chiral symmetry restoration]].\n\nThe upgrade project requires an extensive R&D effort by our researchers and collaborators all over the world on cutting-edge technologies: silicon sensors, low-power electronics, interconnection and packaging technologies, ultra-light mechanical structures and cooling units.\n\n====Time Projection Chamber====\n[[File:ALICE TPC.jpg|thumb|The ALICE [[Time Projection Chamber]] used for particle tracking and identification.]]\n\nThe ALICE [[Time Projection Chamber]] (TPC)  is a large volume filled with a [https://web.archive.org/web/20160728154350/http://aliceinfo.cern.ch/TPC/node/12 gas as detection medium] and is the main particle tracking device in ALICE.<ref>[http://alice-tpc.web.cern.ch/ ALICE Time Projection Chamber] Retrieved 20 January 2019.</ref><ref>[http://aliceinfo.cern.ch/Public/en/Chapter2/Chap2_TPC.html Time Projection Chamber] Retrieved 20 January 2019.</ref>\n\nCharged particles crossing the gas of the TPC ionize the gas atoms along their path, liberating electrons that drift towards the end plates of the detector. The characteristics of the ionization process caused by fast charged particles passing through a medium can be used for particle identification. The velocity dependence of the ionization strength is connected to the well-known [[Bethe-Bloch formula]] , which describes the average energy loss of charged particles through inelastic [[Coulomb collision]]s with the atomic electrons of the medium.\n\nMultiwire proportional counters or solid-state counters are often used as detection medium, because they provide signals with pulse heights proportional to the ionization strength. An [[Electron avalanche|avalanche effect]] in the vicinity of the anode wires strung in the readout chambers, gives the necessary signal amplification. The positive ions created in the avalanche induce a positive current signal on the pad plane. The readout is performed by the 557 568 pads that form the cathode plane of the multi-wire proportional chambers ([[MWPC]]) located at the end plates. This gives the radial distance to the beam and the azimuth. The last coordinate, z along the beam direction, is given by the drift time. Since energy-loss fluctuations can be considerable, in general many pulse-height measurements are performed along the particle track in order to optimize the resolution of the ionization measurement.\n\nAlmost all of the TPC's volume is sensitive to the traversing charged particles, but it features a minimum material budget. The straightforward pattern recognition (continuous tracks) make TPCs the perfect choice for high-multiplicity environments, such as in heavy-ion collisions, where thousands of particles have to be tracked simultaneously. Inside the ALICE TPC, the ionization strength of all tracks is sampled up to 159 times, resulting in a resolution of the ionization measurement as good as 5%.\n\n====Transition radiation detector====\n[[File:CERN ALICE Experiment.jpg|thumb|The completed ALICE detector showing the eighteen TRD modules (trapezoidal prisms in a radial arrangement).]]\n[[Electron]]s and [[positron]]s can be discriminated from other charged particles using the emission of [[transition radiation]], [[X-rays]] emitted when the particles cross many layers of thin materials.\n\nThe identification of electrons and positrons is achieved using a transition radiation detector (TRD).<ref>[http://aliceinfo.cern.ch/Public/en/Chapter2/Chap2_TRD.html Transition Radiation Detector] Retrieved 20 January 2019.</ref> In a similar manner to the muon spectrometer, this system enables detailed studies of the production of vector-meson resonances, but with extended coverage down to the light vector-meson \u03c1 and in a different rapidity region. Below 1 GeV/c, electrons can be identified via a combination of particle identification detector (PID) measurements in the TPC and time of flight (TOF). In the momentum range 1\u201310 GeV/c, the fact that electrons may create TR when travelling through a dedicated \"radiator\" can be exploited. Inside such a radiator, fast charged particles cross the boundaries between materials with different dielectric constants, which can lead to the emission of TR photons with energies in the X-ray range. The effect is tiny and the radiator has to provide many hundreds of material boundaries to achieve a high enough probability to produce at least one photon. In the ALICE TRD, the TR photons are detected just behind the radiator using MWPCs filled with a xenon-based gas mixture, where they deposit their energy on top of the ionization signals from the particle's track.\n\nThe ALICE TRD was designed to derive a fast trigger for charged particles with high momentum and can significantly enhance the recorded yields of vector mesons. For this purpose, 250,000 CPUs are installed right on the detector to identify candidates for high-momentum tracks and analyse the energy deposition associated with them as quickly as possible (while the signals are still being created in the detector). This information is sent to a global tracking unit, which combines all of the information to search for electron\u2013positron track pairs within only 6 \u03bcs.\n\nTo develop such a [[Transition radiation detector|Transition Radiation Detector]] (TRD) for ALICE many detector prototypes were tested in mixed beams of [[pion]]s and electrons.\n\n===Particle identification with ALICE===\nALICE also wants to know the identity of each particle, whether it is an electron, or a proton, a kaon or a pion.\n\nCharged hadrons (in fact, all stable charged particles) are unambiguously identified if their mass and charge are determined. The mass can be deduced from measurements of the momentum and of the velocity. Momentum and the sign of the charge are obtained by measuring the curvature of the particle's track in a magnetic field. To obtain the particle velocity there exist four methods based on measurements of time-of-flight and ionization, and on detection of transition radiation and Cherenkov radiation. Each of these methods works well in different momentum ranges or for specific types of particle. In ALICE all of these methods may be combined in order to measure, for instance, particle spectra.\n\nIn addition to the information given by ITS and TPC, more specialized detectors are needed: the TOF measures, with a precision better than a tenth of a billionth of a second, the time that each particle takes to travel from the vertex to reach it, so that one can measure its speed. The high momentum particle identification detector (HMPID) measures the faint light patterns generated by fast particles and the TRD measures the special radiation very fast particles emit when crossing different materials, thus allowing to identify electrons. Muons are measured by exploiting the fact that they penetrate matter more easily than most other particles: in the forward region a very thick and complex absorber stops all other particles and muons are measured by a dedicated set of detectors: the muon spectrometer.\n\n====Time of Flight====\nCharged particles are identified in ALICE by Time-Of-Flight (TOF). TOF measurements yield the velocity of a charged particle by measuring the flight time over a given distance along the track trajectory.<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/and-time-flies-for-the-alice-detector/ Time flies for ALICE] CERN Courier, 8 July 2008.</ref><ref>[https://cerncourier.com/alice-revolutionizes-tof-systems/ ALICE revolutionizes TOF systems] CERN Courier, 25 October 2011.</ref> Using the tracking information from other detectors every track firing a sensor is identified. Provided the momentum is also known, the mass of the particle can then be derived from these measurements. The ALICE TOF detector is a large-area detector based on multigap resistive plate chambers (MRPCs) that cover a cylindrical surface of 141 m<sup>2</sup>, with an inner radius of {{convert|3.7|m}}. There are approximately 160 000 MRPC pads with time resolution of about 100 ps distributed over the large surface of 150 m<sup>2</sup>.\n\nThe MRPCs are parallel-plate detectors built of thin sheets of standard window glass to create narrow gas gaps with high electric fields. These plates are separated using fishing lines to provide the desired spacing; 10 gas gaps per MRPC are needed to arrive at a detection efficiency close to 100%.\n\nThe simplicity of the construction allows a large system to be built with an overall TOF resolution of 80 ps at a relatively low cost (CERN Courier November 2011 p8). This performance allows the separation of kaons, pions and protons up to momenta of a few GeV/c. Combining such a measurement with the PID information from the ALICE TPC has proved useful in improving the separation between the different particle types, as figure 3 shows for a particular momentum range.\n\n====High Momentum Particle Identification Detector====\n[[File:ALICE HMPID.jpg|thumb|The HMPID detector before final installation inside the ALICE magnet.]]\n\nThe High Momentum Particle Identification Detector (HMPID) is a [[Ring imaging Cherenkov detector|RICH detector]] to determine the speed of particles beyond the momentum range available through energy loss (in ITS and TPC, ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;600&nbsp;MeV) and through time-of-flight measurements (in TOF, ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.2\u20131.4&nbsp;GeV).\n\nCherenkov radiation is a shock wave resulting from charged particles moving through a material faster than the velocity of light in that material. The radiation propagates with a characteristic angle with respect to the particle track, which depends on the particle velocity. Cherenkov detectors make use of this effect and in general consist of two main elements: a radiator in which Cherenkov radiation is produced and a photon detector. Ring imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detectors resolve the ring-shaped image of the focused Cherenkov radiation, enabling a measurement of the Cherenkov angle and thus the particle velocity. This in turn is sufficient to determine the mass of the charged particle.\n\nIf a dense medium (large refractive index) is used, only a thin radiator layer of the order of a few centimetres is required to emit a sufficient number of Cherenkov photons. The photon detector is then located at some distance (usually about 10&nbsp;cm) behind the radiator, allowing the cone of light to expand and form the characteristic ring-shaped image. Such a proximity-focusing RICH is installed in the ALICE experiment.\n\nALICE HMPID's momentum range is up to 3&nbsp;GeV for pion/[[kaon]] discrimination and up to 5&nbsp;GeV for kaon/[[proton]] discrimination.  It is the world's largest [[caesium iodide]] RICH detector, with an active area of 11&nbsp;m\u00b2. A prototype was successfully tested at CERN in 1997 and currently takes data at the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] at the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] in the US.\n\n===Calorimeters===\nCalorimeters measure the energy of particles, and determine whether they have electromagnetic or hadronic interactions. Particle Identification in a calorimeter is a destructive measurement. All particles except muons and neutrinos deposit all their energy in the calorimeter system by production of electromagnetic or hadronic showers. Photons, electrons and positrons deposit all their energy in an electromagnetic calorimeter. Their showers are indistinguishable, but a photon can be identified by the non-existence of a track in the tracking system that is associated to the shower.\n\nThe photons (particles of light), like the light emitted from a hot object, tell us about the temperature of the system. To measure them, special detectors are necessary: the crystals of the PHOS, which are as dense as lead and as transparent as glass, will measure them with fantastic precision in a limited region, while the PMD and in particular the EMCal will measure them over a very wide area. The EMCal will also measure groups of close particles (called \"jets\") which have a memory of the early phases of the event.\n\n====Photon spectrometer====\n[[File:PHOScrystal.jpg|thumb|A technology for mass production of PWO crystals has been developed in close cooperation between CERN, the Apatity plant and RRC \"Kurchatov Institute\".]]\n\nPHOS is a high-resolution electromagnetic calorimeter installed in ALICE<ref>[http://alicematters.web.cern.ch/?q=PHOSupgrade PHOS commissioning during LS1] ALICE matters, 17 May 2013. Retrieved 20 January 2019.</ref> to provide data to test the thermal and dynamical properties of the initial phase of the collision. This is done by measuring photons emerging directly from the collision. PHOS covers a limited acceptance domain at central rapidity. It is made of [[lead tungstate]] crystals,<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/alice-crystals-arrive-at-cern/ ALICE crystals arrive at CERN] ''CERN Courier'', 30 September 2002. Retrieved 20 January 2019.</ref> similar to the ones used by CMS, read out using Avalanche Photodiodes (APD).\n\nWhen high energy photons strike lead tungstate, they make it glow, or scintillate, and this glow can be measured. Lead tungstate is extremely dense (denser than iron), stopping most photons that reach it. The crystals are kept at a temperature of 248 K, which helps to minimize the deterioration of the energy resolution due to noise and to optimize the response for low energies.\n\n====Electro-Magnetic Calorimeter====\nThe EMCal is a lead-scintillator sampling calorimeter comprising almost 13,000 individual towers that are grouped into ten super-modules. The towers are read out by wavelength-shifting optical fibers in a shashlik geometry coupled to an avalanche photodiode. The complete EMCal will contain 100,000 individual scintillator tiles and 185 kilometers of optical fiber, weighing in total about 100 tons.\n\nThe EMCal covers almost the full length of the ALICE Time Projection Chamber and central detector, and a third of its azimuth placed back-to-back with the ALICE Photon Spectrometer \u2013 a smaller, highly granular lead-tungstate calorimeter.\n\nThe super-modules are inserted into an independent support frame situated within the ALICE magnet, between the time-of-flight counters and the magnet coil. The support frame itself is a complex structure: it weighs 20 tons and must support five times its own weight, with a maximum deflection between being empty and being fully loaded of only a couple of centimeters. Installation of the eight-ton super-modules requires a system of rails with a sophisticated insertion device to bridge across to the support structure.\n\nThe Electro-Magnetic Calorimeter (EM-Cal) will add greatly to the high momentum particle measurement capabilities of ALICE.<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/first-jet-measurements-with-alice/ First jet measurements with ALICE] ''CERN Courier'', 22 May 2013.</ref> It will extend ALICE's reach to study jets and other hard processes.\n\n====Photon Multiplicity Detector====\nThe Photon Multiplicity Detector (PMD) is a Particle shower detector which measures the multiplicity and spatial distribution of photons produced in the collisions.<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/indian-detector-stars-at-brookhaven/ Indian detector stars at Brookhaven] ''CERN Courier'', 5 September 2004.</ref> It utilizes as a first layer a veto detector to reject charged particles. Photons on the other hand pass through a converter, initiating an electromagnetic shower in a second detector layer where they produce large signals on several cells of its sensitive volume. Hadrons on the other hand normally affect only one cell and produce a signal representing minimum-ionizing particles.\n\n====Forward Multiplicity Detector====\n[[File:FMD 1.jpg|thumb|ALICE Forward Multiplicity Detector]]\n\nThe Forward Multiplicity Detector (FMD) extends the coverage for multiplicity of charge particles into the forward regions - giving ALICE the widest coverage of the 4 LHC experiments for these measurements.<ref>[http://fmd.nbi.dk ALICE Forward Detectors] Retrieved 20 January 2019.</ref>\n\nThe FMD consist of 5 large silicon discs with each 10&thinsp;240 individual detector channels to measure the charged particles emitted at small angles relative to the beam. FMD provides an independent measurement of the orientation of the collisions in the vertical plane, which can be used with measurements from the barrel detector to investigate flow, jets, etc.\n\n====Muon spectrometer====\nThe ALICE forward muon spectrometer studies the complete spectrum of heavy quarkonia (J/\u03a8, \u03a8\u2032, \u03d2, \u03d2\u2032, \u03d2\u2032\u2032) via their decay in the \u03bc+\u03bc\u2013 channel. Heavy quarkonium states, provide an essential tool to study the early and hot stage of heavy-ion collisions.<ref>[http://aliceinfo.cern.ch/Public/en/Chapter2/Chap2_dim_spec.html ALICE Dimuon Spectrometer] Retrieved 20 January 2019.</ref> In particular they are expected to be sensitive to Quark-Gluon Plasma formation. In the presence of a deconfined medium (i.e. QGP) with high enough energy density, quarkonium states are dissociated because of colour screening. This leads to a suppression of their production rates. At the high LHC collision energy, both the charmonium states (J/\u03a8 and \u03a8\u2032) as well as the bottomonium states (\u03d2, \u03d2\u2032 and \u03d2\u2032\u2032) can be studied. The Dimuon spectrometer is optimized for the detection of these heavy quark resonances.\n\n[[File:Dimuon1 small.gif|thumb|The main components of the ALICE muon spectrometer: an absorber to filter the background, a set of tracking chambers before, inside and after the magnet and a set of trigger chambers.]]\n\nMuons may be identified using the just described technique by using the fact that they are the only charged particles able to pass almost undisturbed through any material. This behaviour is connected to the fact that muons with momenta below a few hundred GeV/c do not suffer from radiative energy losses and so do not produce electromagnetic showers. Also, because they are leptons, they are not subject to strong interactions with the nuclei of the material they traverse. This behaviour is exploited in muon spectrometers in high-energy physics experiments by installing muon detectors behind the calorimeter systems or behind thick absorber materials. All charged particles other than muons are completely stopped, producing electromagnetic (and hadronic) showers.\n\nThe muon spectrometer in the forward region of ALICE features a very thick and complex front absorber and an additional muon filter consisting of an iron wall 1.2 m thick. Muon candidates selected from tracks penetrating these absorbers are measured precisely in a dedicated set of tracking detectors. Pairs of muons are used to collect the spectrum of heavy-quark vector-meson resonances (J/Psi). Their production rates can be analysed as a function of transverse momentum and collision centrality in order to investigate dissociation due to colour screening. The acceptance of the ALICE Muon Spectrometer covers the pseudorapidity interval 2.5 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 4 and the resonances can be detected down to zero transverse momentum.\n\n===Characterization of the collision===\nFinally, we need to know how powerful the collision was: this is done by measuring the remnants of the colliding nuclei in detectors made of high density materials located about 110 meters on both sides of ALICE (the ZDCs) and by measuring with the FMD, V0 and T0 the number of particles produced in the collision and their spatial distribution. T0 also measures with high precision the time when the event takes place.\n\n====Zero Degree Calorimeter====\n[[File:ALICE ZDC3.jpg|thumb|Front face of the ZN calorimeter: One of the two ZN calorimeters during assembly. The quartz fibers are hosted in the 1936 grooves of the W-alloy slabs.]]\n\nThe ZDCs are calorimeters which detect the energy of the spectator nucleons in order to determine the overlap region of the two colliding nuclei. It is composed of four calorimeters, two to detect protons (ZP) and two to detect neutrons (ZN). They are located 115 meters away from the interaction point on both sides, exactly along the beam line. The ZN is placed at zero degree with respect to the LHC beam axis, between the two beam pipes. That is why we call them Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDC).The ZP is positioned externally to the outgoing beam pipe. The spectator protons are separated from the ion beams by means of the dipole magnet D1.\n\nThe ZDCs are \"spaghetti calorimeters\", made by a stack of heavy metal plates grooved to allocate a matrix of quartz fibres. Their principle of operation is based on the detection of Cherenkov light produced by the charged particles of the shower in the fibers.\n\n====V0 detector====\nV0 is made of two arrays of scintillator counters set on both sides of the ALICE interaction point, and called V0-A and V0-C. The V0-C counter is located upstream of the dimuon arm absorber and cover the spectrometer acceptance while the V0-A counter will be located at around 3.5 m away from the collision vertex, on the other side.\n\nIt is used to estimate the centrality of the collision by summing up the energy deposited in the two disks of V0. This observable scales directly with the number of primary particles generated in the collision and therefore to the centrality.\n\nV0 is also used as reference in Van Der Meer scans that give the size and shape of colliding beams and therefore the luminosity delivered to the experiment.\n\n====T0 detector====\n[[File:T0det.png|thumb|An array of Cherenkov counters used in the ALICE T0 detector.]]\nALICE T0 serves as a start, trigger and luminosity detector for ALICE. The accurate interaction time (START) serves as the reference signal for the Time-of-Flight detector that is used for particle identification. T0 supplies five different trigger signals to the Central Trigger Processor. The most important of these is the T0 vertex providing prompt and accurate confirmation of the location of the primary interaction point along the beam axis within the set boundaries. The detector is also used for online luminosity monitoring providing fast feedback to the accelerator team.\n\nThe T0 detector consists of two arrays of [[Cherenkov radiation|Cherenkov]] counters (T0-C and T0-A) positioned at the opposite sides of the interaction point (IP). Each array has 12 cylindrical counters equipped with a quartz radiator and a photomultiplier tube.\n\n===ALICE Cosmic Rays Detector (ACORDE)===\nThe ALICE cavern provides an ideal place for the detection of high energy atmospheric muons coming from cosmic ray showers. ACORDE detects cosmic ray showers by triggering the arrival of muons to the top of the ALICE magnet.\n\nThe ALICE cosmic ray trigger is made of 60 scintillator modules distributed on the 3 upper faces of the ALICE magnet yoke. The array can be configured to trigger on single or multi-muon events, from 2-fold coincidences up to the whole array if desired. ACORDE's high luminosity allows the recording of cosmic events with very high multiplicity of parallel muon tracks, the so-called muon bundles.\n\nWith ACORDE, the ALICE Experiment has been able to detect muon bundles with the highest multiplicity ever registered as well as to indirectly measure very high energy primary cosmic rays {{cn|date=July 2015}}.\n\n==Data acquisition==\nALICE had to design a data acquisition system that operates efficiently in two widely different running modes: the very frequent but small events, with few produced particles encountered during proton-proton collisions and the relatively rare, but extremely large events, with tens of thousands of new particles produced in lead-lead collisions at the LHC (L = 10<sup>27</sup> cm<sup>\u22122</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup> in Pb-Pb with 100 ns bunch crossings and L = 10<sup>30</sup>-10<sup>31</sup> cm<sup>\u22122</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup> in pp with 25 ns bunch crossings).<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/meeting-the-alice-data-challenge/ Meeting the ALICE data challenge] ''CERN Courier'', 27 June 2000.</ref>\n\nThe ALICE data acquisition system needs to balance its capacity to record the steady stream of very large events resulting from central collisions, with an ability to select and record rare cross-section processes. These requirements result in an aggregate event building bandwidth of up to 2.5 GByte/s and a storage capability of up to 1.25 GByte/s, giving a total of more than 1 PByte of data every year. As shown in the figure, ALICE needs a data storage capacity that by far exceeds that of the current generation of experiments. This data rate is equivalent to six times the contents of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica every second.\n\nThe hardware of the ALICE DAQ system<ref>[http://aliceinfo.cern.ch/Public/en/Chapter2/Chap2_DAQ.html ALICE Data Acquisition] Retrieved 20 January 2019.</ref> is largely based on commodity components: PC's running Linux and standard Ethernet switches for the eventbuilding network. The required performances are achieved by the interconnection of hundreds of these PC's into a large DAQ fabric. The software framework of the ALICE DAQ is called DATE (ALICE Data Acquisition and Test Environment). DATE is already in use today, during the construction and testing phase of the experiment, while evolving gradually towards the final production system. Moreover, AFFAIR (A Flexible Fabric and Application Information Recorder) is the performance monitoring software developed by the ALICE Data Acquisition project. AFFAIR is largely based on open source code and is composed of the following components: data gathering, inter-node communication employing DIM, fast and temporary round robin database storage, and permanent storage and plot generation using ROOT.\n\nFinally. the ALICE experiment Mass Storage System (MSS) combines a very high bandwidth (1.25 GByte/s) and every year stores huge amounts of data, more than 1 Pbytes. The mass storage system is made of: a) Global Data Storage (GDS) performing the temporary storage of data at the experimental pit; b) Permanent Data Storage (PDS) for long-term archive of data in the CERN Computing Center and finally from The Mass Storage System software managing the creation, the access and the archive of data.\n\n==Results==\n[[File:1011252 11-A4-at-144-dpi.jpg|thumb|Events recorded by the ALICE experiment from the first lead ion collisions, at a centre-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV per nucleon pair.]]\n\nThe physics programme of ALICE includes the following main topics: i) the study of the thermalization of partons in the QGP with focus on the massive charming beauty quarks and understanding the behaviour of these heavy quarks in relation to the stroungly-coupled medium of QGP, ii) the study of the mechanisms of energy loss that occur in the medium and the dependencies of energy loss on the parton species, iii) the dissociation of quarkonium states which can be a probe of deconfinement and of the temperature of the medium and finally the production of thermal photons and low-mass dileptons emitted by the QGP which is about assessing the initial temperature and degrees of freedom of the systems as well as the chiral nature of the phase transition.\n\nThe ALICE collaboration presented its first results from LHC proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV in March 2010.<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/alice-reveals-first-results-at-7-tev/ ALICE presents first results at 7 TeV] ''CERN Courier'', 7 June 2010.</ref> The results confirmed that the charged-particle multiplicity is rising with energy faster than expected while the shape of the multiplicity distribution is not reproduced well by standard simulations. The results were based on the analysis of a sample of 300,000 proton\u2013proton collisions the ALICE experiment collected during the first runs of the LHC with stable beams at a centre-of-mass energy, \u221as, of 7 TeV,\n\nIn 2011, the ALICE Collaboration measured the size of the system created in Pb-Pb collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV per nucleon pair.<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/alice-collaboration-measures-the-size-of-the-fireball-in-heavy-ion-collisions/ ALICE Collaboration measures the size of the fireball in heav-ion collisions] ''CERN Courier'', 3 May 2011.</ref> ALICE confirmed that the QCD matter created in Pb-Pb collisions behaves like a fluid, with strong collective motions that are well described by hydrodynamic equations. The fireball formed in nuclear collisions at the LHC is hotter, lives longer and expands to a larger size than the medium that was formed in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC. Multiplicity measurements by the ALICE experiment show that the system initially has much higher energy density and is at least 30% hotter than at RHIC, resulting in about double the particle multiplicity for each colliding nucleon pair (Aamodt et al. 2010a).  Further analyses, in particular including the full dependence of these observables on centrality, will provide more insights into the properties of the system \u2013 such as initial velocities, the equation of state and the fluid viscosity \u2013 and strongly constrain the theoretical modelling of heavy-ion collisions.\n\n===A perfect liquid at the LHC===\nOff-centre nuclear collisions, with a finite impact parameter, create a strongly asymmetric \"almond-shaped\" fireball. However, experiments cannot measure the spatial dimensions of the interaction (except in special cases, for example in the production of pions, see<ref>[http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/46055l ALICE enters new territory in heavy-ion collisions]{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[CERN Courier]], 25 January 2012</ref>). Instead, they measure the momentum distributions of the emitted particles. A correlation between the measured azimuthal momentum distribution of particles emitted from the decaying fireball and the initial spatial asymmetry can arise only from multiple interactions between the constituents of the created matter; in other words it tells us about how the matter flows, which is related to its equation of state and its thermodynamic transport properties.<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/hadron-spectra-probe-nature-of-matter-in-pb-pb-collisions/ Hadron spectra probe nature of matter in Pb-Pb collisions], ''[[CERN Courier]]'', 25 January 2012.</ref>\n\nThe measured azimuthal distribution of particles in momentum space can be decomposed into Fourier coefficients. The second Fourier coefficient (v2), called elliptic flow, is particularly sensitive to the internal friction or viscosity of the fluid, or more precisely, \u03b7/s, the ratio of the shear viscosity (\u03b7) to entropy (s) of the system. For a good fluid such as water, the \u03b7/s ratio is small. A \"thick\" liquid, such as honey, has large values of \u03b7/s.\n\nIn heavy-ion collisions at the LHC, the ALICE collaboration found that the hot matter created in the collision behaves like a fluid with little friction, with \u03b7/s close to its lower limit (almost zero viscosity). With these measurements, ALICE has just begun to explore the temperature dependence of \u03b7/s and we anticipate many more in-depth flow-related measurements at the LHC that will constrain the hydrodynamic features of the QGP even further.\n\n===Measuring the highest temperature on Earth===\nIn August 2012, ALICE scientists announced that their experiments produced [[quark\u2013gluon plasma]] with temperature at around 5.5 trillion [[kelvin]]s, the highest temperature mass achieved in any physical experiments thus far.<ref>[https://www.yahoo.com/news/blogs/technology-blog/cern-scientists-create-highest-temperature-mass-humanity-ever-034111958.html CERN scientists create the highest temperature mass humanity has ever seen], [[Yahoo!

This phenomenon, \"jet quenching\", is especially useful in the study of the QGP, using the naturally occurring products (jets) of the hard scattering of quarks and gluons from the incoming nuclei. A highly energetic parton (a colour charge) probes the coloured medium rather like an X-ray probes ordinary matter. The production of these partonic probes in hadronic collisions is well understood within perturbative QCD. The theory also shows that a parton traversing the medium will lose a fraction of its energy in emitting many soft (low energy) gluons. The amount of the radiated energy is proportional to the density of the medium and to the square of the path length travelled by the parton in the medium. Theory also predicts that the energy loss depends on the flavour of the parton.\n\nJet quenching was first observed at RHIC by measuring the yields of hadrons with high transverse momentum. These particles are produced via fragmentation of energetic partons. The yields of these high-pT particles in central nucleus\u2013nucleus collisions were found to be a factor of five lower than expected from the measurements in proton\u2013proton reactions. ALICE has recently published the measurement of charged particles in central heavy-ion collisions at the LHC. As at RHIC, the production of high-pT hadrons at the LHC is strongly suppressed. However, the observations at the LHC show qualitatively new features. The observation from ALICE is consistent with reports from the ATLAS and CMS collaborations on direct evidence for parton energy loss within heavy-ion collisions using fully reconstructed back-to-back jets of particles associated with hard parton scatterings.<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/alice-tracks-charm-energy-loss-in-the-qgp/ ALICE tracks charm energy loss] ''CERN Courier'', 31 May 2012.</ref> The latter two experiments have shown a strong energy imbalance between the jet and its recoiling partner (G Aad et al. 2010 and CMS collaboration 2011). This imbalance is thought to arise because one of the jets traversed the hot and dense matter, transferring a substantial fraction of its energy to the medium in a way that is not recovered by the reconstruction of the jets.\n\n===Studying quarkonium hadroproduction===\nQuarkonia are bound states of heavy flavour quarks (charm or bottom) and their antiquarks. Two types of quarkonia have been extensively studied: charmonia, which consist of a charm quark and an anti-charm, and bottomonia made of a bottom and an anti-bottom quark. Charm and anticharm quarks in the presence of the Quark Gluon Plasma, in which there are many free colour charges, are not able to see each other any more and therefore they cannot form bound states. The \"melting\" of quarkonia into the QGP manifests itself in the suppression of the quarkonium yields compared to the production without the presence of the QGP. The search for quarkonia suppression as a QGP signature started 25 years ago. The first ALICE results for charm hadrons in PbPb collisions at a centre-of-mass energy \u221asNN = 2.76 TeV indicate strong in-medium energy loss for charm and strange quarks that is an indication of the formation of the hot medium of QGP.<ref>[http://alicematters.web.cern.ch/?q=ALICE_Quarkonium Studying Quarkonium hadroproduction with ALICE] ALICE Matters, 20 August 2013. Retrieved 20 January 2019.</ref>\n\nAs the temperature increases so does the colour screening resulting in greater suppression of the quarkonium states as it is more difficult for charm \u2013 anticharm or bottom \u2013 antibottom to form new bound states. At very high temperatures no quarkonium states are expected to survive; they melt in the QGP. Quarkonium sequential suppression is therefore considered as a QGP thermometer, as states with different masses have different sizes and are expected to be screened and dissociated at different temperatures. However - as the collision energy increases - so does the number of charm-anticharm quarks that can form bound states, and a balancing mechanism of recombination of quarkonia may appear as we move to higher energies.\n\nThe results from the first ALICE run are rather striking, when compared with the observations from lower energies. While a similar suppression is observed at LHC energies for peripheral collisions, when moving towards more head-on collisions \u2013 as quantified by the increasing number of nucleons in the lead nuclei participating in the interaction \u2013 the suppression no longer increases. Therefore, despite the higher temperatures attained in the nuclear collisions at the LHC, more J/\u03c8 mesons are detected by the ALICE experiment in Pb\u2013Pb with respect to p\u2013p. Such an effect is likely to be related to a regeneration process occurring at the temperature boundary between the QGP and a hot gas of hadrons.\n\nThe suppression of charmonium states was also observed in proton-lead collisions at the LHC, in which Quark Gluon Plasma is not formed. This suggests that the observed suppression in proton-nucleus collisions (pA) is due to cold nuclear matter effects. Grasping the wealth of experimental results requires understanding the medium modification of quarkonia and disentangling hot and cold-matter effects. Today there is a large amount of data available from RHIC and LHC on charmonium and bottomonium suppression and ALICE tries to distinguish between effects due to the formation of the QGP and those from cold nuclear matter effects.\n\n===Double-ridge structure in p-Pb collisions===\n[[File:Test8.png|thumb|ALICE records first proton-lead collisions at the LHC]]\n\nThe analysis of the data from the p-Pb collisions at the LHC revealed a completely unexpected double-ridge structure with so far unknown origin. The proton\u2013lead (pPb) collisions in 2013, two years after its heavy-ion collisions opened a new chapter in exploration of the properties of the deconfined, chirally symmetrical state of the QGP. A surprising near-side, long-range (elongated in pseudorapidity) correlation, forming a ridge-like structure observed in high-multiplicity pp collisions, was also found in high-multiplicity pPb collisions, but with a much larger amplitude (<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/alice-and-atlas-find-intriguing-double-ridge-in-proton-lead-collisions/ ALICE and ATLAS find intriguing double ridge in proton-lead collisions] ''CERN Courier'', 20 February 2013.</ref>). However, the biggest surprise came from the observation that this near-side ridge is accompanied by an essentially symmetrical away-side ridge, opposite in azimuth (CERN Courier March 2013 p6). This double ridge was revealed after the short-range correlations arising from jet fragmentation and resonance decays were suppressed by subtracting the correlation distribution measured for low-multiplicity events from the one for high-multiplicity events.\n\nSimilar long-range structures in heavy-ion collisions have been attributed to the collective flow of particles emitted from a thermalized system undergoing a collective hydrodynamic expansion. This anisotropy can be characterized by means of the vn (n = 2, 3, ...) coefficients of a Fourier decomposition of the single-particle azimuthal distribution. To test the possible presence of collective phenomena further, the ALICE collaboration has extended the two-particle correlation analysis to identified particles, checking for a potential mass ordering of the v2 harmonic coefficients. Such an ordering in mass was observed in heavy-ion collisions, where it was interpreted to arise from a common radial boost \u2013 the so-called radial flow \u2013 coupled to the anisotropy in momentum space. Continuing the surprises, a clear particle-mass ordering, similar to the one observed in mid-central PbPb collisions (CERN Courier, September 2013), has been measured in high-multiplicity pPb collisions.\n\nThe final surprise, so far, comes from the charmonium states. Whereas J/\u03c8 production does not reveal any unexpected behaviour, the production of the heavier and less-bound (2S) state indicates a strong suppression (0.5\u20130.7) with respect to J/\u03c8, when compared with pp collisions. Is this a hint of effects of the medium? Indeed, in heavy-ion collisions, such a suppression has been interpreted as a sequential melting of quarkonia states, depending on their binding energy and the temperature of the QGP created in these collisions.\n\nThe first pPb measurement campaign, expected results were widely accompanied by unanticipated observations. Among the expected results is the confirmation that proton\u2013nucleus collisions provide an appropriate tool to study the partonic structure of cold nuclear matter in detail. The surprises have come from the similarity of several observables between pPb and PbPb collisions, which hint at the existence of collective phenomena in pPb collisions with high particle multiplicity and, eventually, the formation of QGP.<ref>[https://cerncourier.com/alice-is-cold-nuclear-matter-really-cold/ Is Cold nuclear matter really cold?] ''CERN Courier'', 24 February 2014. </ref>\n\n==Upgrades and future plans==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Long Shutdown 1===\nThe main upgrade activity on ALICE during LHC's Long Shutdown 1 was the installation of the dijet calorimeter (DCAL), an extension of the existing EMCAL system that adds 60\u00b0 of azimuthal acceptance opposite the existing 120\u00b0 of the EMCAL's acceptance. This new subdetector will be installed on the bottom of the solenoid magnet, which currently houses three modules of the photon spectrometer (PHOS). Moreover, an entirely new rail system and cradle will be installed to support the three PHOS modules and eight DCAL modules, which together weigh more than 100 tones. The installation of five modules of the TRD will follow and so complete this complex detector system, which consists of 18 units,\n\nIn addition to these mainstream detector activities, all of the 18 ALICE subdetectors underwent major improvements during LS1 while the computers and discs of the online systems are replaced, followed by upgrades of the operating systems and online software.\n\nAll of these efforts are to ensure that ALICE is in good shape for the three-year LHC running period after LS1, when the collaboration looks forward to heavy-ion collisions at the top LHC energy of 5.5 TeV/nucleon at luminosities in excess of 1027&nbsp;Hz/cm<sup>2</sup>.\n\n===Long shutdown 2 (2018)===\nThe ALICE collaboration has plans for a major upgrade during the next long shutdown, LS2, currently scheduled for 2018. Then the entire silicon tracker will be replaced by a monolithic-pixel tracker system built from ALPIDE chips; the time-projection chamber will be upgraded with gaseous electron-multiplier (GEM) detectors for continuous read-out and the use of new microelectronics; and all of the other subdetectors and the online systems will prepare for a 100-fold increase in the number of events written to tape.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikipedia books|Large Hadron Collider}}\n*[http://aliceinfo.cern.ch/Public/Welcome.html Official ALICE Public Webpage] at CERN\n*[http://alice.g-php.com/#banner Interactive Timeline for ALICE 20th anniversary]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120112202708/http://www.uslhc.us/What_is_the_LHC/Experiments/ALICE ALICE section on US/LHC Website]\n*{{cite journal|year=2008|title=The ALICE experiment at the CERN LHC|journal=[[Journal of Instrumentation]]|volume=3|issue=8|pages=S08002|doi=10.1088/1748-0221/3/08/S08002|bibcode=2008JInst...3S8002A|last1=Aamodt|first1=K.|collaboration=The ALICE Collaboration|displayauthors=etal|doi-access=free}}\n\n{{CERN}}\n\n[[Category:CERN experiments]]\n[[Category:Large Hadron Collider]]\n", "name_user": "Bibliophilen", "label": "safe", "comment": "Corrected typo in Intro.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALICE_experiment"}
