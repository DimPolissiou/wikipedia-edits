The ninth [[tropical cyclone naming|named storm]] of the [[2015 Pacific typhoon season]], Chan-hom developed on June&nbsp;29 from a [[westerly wind burst]] that also spawned [[Cyclone Raquel|Tropical Cyclone Raquel]] in the southern hemisphere. Chan-hom slowly developed while moving to the northwest, aided by warm waters but disrupted by [[wind shear]]. The storm meandered near the [[Northern Marianas Islands]], passing over the island of [[Rota (island)|Rota]] before beginning a steady northwest track. While near the island, the storm dropped heavy rainfall on neighboring [[Guam]], causing flooding and minor power outages. Chan-hom intensified into a typhoon on July&nbsp;7, and two days later passed between the Japanese islands of [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]] and [[Miyako-jima]]. There, strong winds left 42,000&nbsp;people without power, while 27&nbsp;people were injured. Around that time, the storm caused a surge in the [[monsoon trough]], in conjunction with [[Tropical Storm Linfa (2015)|Tropical Storm Linfa]], which caused flooding and killed 16&nbsp;people in the Philippines.\n\nAfter passing by Okinawa, the typhoon reached peak winds of 165&nbsp;km/h (105&nbsp;mph), according to the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]]. It passed north of [[Taiwan]], where it brought beneficial rainfall that replenished reservoirs. On July&nbsp;11, Chan-hom became the strongest typhoon to make [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] in the [[China|Chinese]] province of [[Zhejiang]]. About 1.1&nbsp;million people were evacuated ahead of the storm, and across the country, the storm left [[Renminbi|\u00a5]]9.84&nbsp;billion ([[United States dollar|US$]]1.58&nbsp;billion) in damage, as well as one death. Later, the storm turned to the northeast toward the [[Korean Peninsula]]. [[Jejudo|Jeju Island]] offshore [[South Korea]] recorded {{convert|1250|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rainfall, and one person died due to a thunderstorm in the country. On July&nbsp;12, the storm struck the [[Ongjin County, South Hwanghae|Ongjin peninsula]] in [[North Korea]], and became an [[extratropical cyclone]] shortly thereafter. The remnants later caused flooding and power outages in the [[Russian Far East]].\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|Chan-hom 2015 track.png}}\nDuring June 2015, a near record strength pulse in the [[Madden\u2013Julian oscillation]], lead to a period of significant weather across the Western Pacific.<ref name=\"BoM TCR\">{{cite report|author=Queensland Regional Office |title=Tropical Cyclone Raquel |publisher=Australian Bureau of Meteorology |date=2015 |access-date=September 11, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6bRyKXV3R?url=http://www.bom.gov.au/announcements/sevwx/qld/qldtc20150630.shtml |archive-date=September 10, 2015 |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/announcements/sevwx/qld/qldtc20150630.shtml |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref><ref name=\"JTWC ATCR\">{{cite report|title=Annual Tropical Cyclone Report 2015 |publisher=United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816030230/https://metoc.ndbc.noaa.gov/ProductFeeds-portlet/img/jtwc/atcr/2015atcr.pdf |access-date=July 11, 2016 |archive-date=August 16, 2016 |url=https://metoc.ndbc.noaa.gov/ProductFeeds-portlet/img/jtwc/atcr/2015atcr.pdf |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> This significant weather included a major [[westerly wind burst]] during late June, which caused a set of twin tropical cyclones to develop.<ref name=\"PEAC2\">{{cite journal|volume=21 |issue=3 |author=Pacific El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Applications Climate Center |title=Pacific ENSO Update: 3rd Quarter 2015 |url=http://www.weather.gov/media/peac/PEU/PEU_v21_n3.pdf |publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service |format=PDF |access-date=August 15, 2015 |url-status=live |date=August 14, 2015 |archive-date=August 15, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6ano440cL?url=http://www.weather.gov/media/peac/PEU/PEU_v21_n3.pdf |df= }}</ref> The first tropical cyclone developed in the Southern Hemisphere during June 28, before it later developed into [[2014\u201315 South Pacific cyclone season#Tropical Cyclone Raquel|Tropical Cyclone Raquel]] during June 30.<ref name=\"PEAC2\"/> The second tropical cyclone was first noted by the United States [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) as a tropical disturbance during June 25, while it was located about {{convert|345|km|mi|round=5|abbr=on}} to the south-southeast of [[Pohnpei State]] in the [[Federated States of Micronesia]].<ref>{{cite report|publisher=United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center |date=June 25, 2015 |access-date=July 12, 2015 |title=Significant Tropical Weather Outlook for the Western and South Pacific Oceans June 25, 2015 13z |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZcPBiCoY?url=http://gwydir.demon.co.uk/advisories/ABPW10-PGTW_201506251330.htm |archive-date=June 28, 2015 |url=http://weather.noaa.gov/pub/data/raw/ab/abpw10.pgtw..txt |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>{{#tag:ref|The [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] is a joint [[United States Navy]] &ndash; [[United States Air Force]] task force that issues tropical cyclone warnings for the Pacific and Indian Oceans.<ref name=\"JTWC ATCR\"/>|group=\"nb\"}}\n\nDrifting generally northward, the disturbance slowly organized within a region of low to moderate [[wind shear]] and favorable [[Outflow (meteorology)|outflow]] aloft.

The ninth [[tropical cyclone naming|named storm]] of the [[2015 Pacific typhoon season]], Chan-hom developed on June&nbsp;29 from a [[westerly wind burst]] that also spawned [[Cyclone Raquel|Tropical Cyclone Raquel]] in the southern hemisphere. Chan-hom slowly developed while moving to the northwest, aided by warm waters but disrupted by [[wind shear]]. The storm meandered near the [[Northern Marianas Islands]], passing over the island of [[Rota (island)|Rota]] before beginning a steady northwest track. While near the island, the storm dropped heavy rainfall on neighboring [[Guam]], causing flooding and minor power outages. Chan-hom intensified into a typhoon on July&nbsp;7, and two days later passed between the Japanese islands of [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]] and [[Miyako-jima]]. There, strong winds left 42,000&nbsp;people without power, while 27&nbsp;people were injured. Around that time, the storm caused a surge in the [[monsoon trough]], in conjunction with [[Tropical Storm Linfa (2015)|Tropical Storm Linfa]], which caused flooding and killed 16&nbsp;people in the Philippines.\n\nAfter passing by Okinawa, the typhoon reached peak winds of 165&nbsp;km/h (105&nbsp;mph), according to the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]]. It passed north of [[Taiwan]], where it brought beneficial rainfall that replenished reservoirs. On July&nbsp;11, Chan-hom became the strongest typhoon to make [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] in the [[China|Chinese]] province of [[Zhejiang]]. About 1.1&nbsp;million people were evacuated ahead of the storm, and across the country, the storm left [[Renminbi|\u00a5]]9.84&nbsp;billion ([[United States dollar|US$]]1.58&nbsp;billion) in damage, as well as one death. Later, the storm turned to the northeast toward the [[Korean Peninsula]]. [[Jejudo|Jeju Island]] offshore [[South Korea]] recorded {{convert|1250|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rainfall, and one person died due to a thunderstorm in the country. On July&nbsp;12, the storm struck the [[Ongjin County, South Hwanghae|Ongjin peninsula]] in [[North Korea]], and became an [[extratropical cyclone]] shortly thereafter. The remnants later caused flooding and power outages in the [[Russian Far East]].\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|Chan-hom 2015 track.png}}\nDuring June 2015, a near record strength pulse in the [[Madden\u2013Julian oscillation]], lead to a period of significant weather across the Western Pacific.<ref name=\"BoM TCR\">{{cite report|author=Queensland Regional Office |title=Tropical Cyclone Raquel |publisher=Australian Bureau of Meteorology |date=2015 |access-date=September 11, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6bRyKXV3R?url=http://www.bom.gov.au/announcements/sevwx/qld/qldtc20150630.shtml |archive-date=September 10, 2015 |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/announcements/sevwx/qld/qldtc20150630.shtml |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref><ref name=\"JTWC ATCR\">{{cite report|title=Annual Tropcial Cyclone Report 2015 |publisher=United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816030230/https://metoc.ndbc.noaa.gov/ProductFeeds-portlet/img/jtwc/atcr/2015atcr.pdf |access-date=July 11, 2016 |archive-date=August 16, 2016 |url=https://metoc.ndbc.noaa.gov/ProductFeeds-portlet/img/jtwc/atcr/2015atcr.pdf |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> This significant weather included a major [[westerly wind burst]] during late June, which caused a set of twin tropical cyclones to develop.<ref name=\"PEAC2\">{{cite journal|volume=21 |issue=3 |author=Pacific El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Applications Climate Center |title=Pacific ENSO Update: 3rd Quarter 2015 |url=http://www.weather.gov/media/peac/PEU/PEU_v21_n3.pdf |publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service |format=PDF |access-date=August 15, 2015 |url-status=live |date=August 14, 2015 |archive-date=August 15, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6ano440cL?url=http://www.weather.gov/media/peac/PEU/PEU_v21_n3.pdf |df= }}</ref> The first tropical cyclone developed in the Southern Hemisphere during June 28, before it later developed into [[2014\u201315 South Pacific cyclone season#Tropical Cyclone Raquel|Tropical Cyclone Raquel]] during June 30.<ref name=\"PEAC2\"/> The second tropical cyclone was first noted by the United States [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) as a tropical disturbance during June 25, while it was located about {{convert|345|km|mi|round=5|abbr=on}} to the south-southeast of [[Pohnpei State]] in the [[Federated States of Micronesia]].<ref>{{cite report|publisher=United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center |date=June 25, 2015 |access-date=July 12, 2015 |title=Significant Tropical Weather Outlook for the Western and South Pacific Oceans June 25, 2015 13z |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZcPBiCoY?url=http://gwydir.demon.co.uk/advisories/ABPW10-PGTW_201506251330.htm |archive-date=June 28, 2015 |url=http://weather.noaa.gov/pub/data/raw/ab/abpw10.pgtw..txt |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>{{#tag:ref|The [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] is a joint [[United States Navy]] &ndash; [[United States Air Force]] task force that issues tropical cyclone warnings for the Pacific and Indian Oceans.<ref name=\"JTWC ATCR\"/>|group=\"nb\"}}\n\nDrifting generally northward, the disturbance slowly organized within a region of low to moderate [[wind shear]] and favorable [[Outflow (meteorology)|outflow]] aloft.

They lived in extended family groups of 20\u201340 members, hunting [[kangaroo]]s, [[Phalangeriformes|possums]] and [[eel]]s and gathering [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]]s and other seasonal fruit and vegetables from the local area. They were described as 'short, stocky, strong and superbly built' and generally considered peaceful.
