The term may refer to any belief about the nature of [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] that affirms [[God]] as a singular entity and rejects the doctrine of the [[Trinity]], as affirmed by the [[Nicene Creed|mainstream Christianity]]: a consensus of Christian bishops at the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325. Nontrinitarianism was especially prevalent during the theological turmoils of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. A Spanish physician, [[Michael Servetus]], studied the Bible and concluded that the concept of the Trinity, as traditionally conceived, was not biblical. His books ''On the Errors of the Trinity'' and ''Christianismi Restitutio'' caused much uproar. Servetus was eventually arrested, convicted of heresy, and burned at the stake in [[Geneva]] in 1553.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miguelservet.org/servetus/biography.htm |title=Michael Servetus Institute; Times that Servetus lived |publisher=Miguelservet.org |accessdate=2011-02-27}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"Unitarian\" entered the English language via [[Henry Hedworth]], who applied it to the teachings of [[Laelio Sozzini]] and the Polish [[Socinians]]. Unitarian churches were formally established in [[Transylvania]] and [[Poland]] (by the [[Socinianism|Socinians]]) in the second half of the 16th century.<ref name=\"Harris\">Harris, MW. Unitarian Universalist Origins: Our Historic Faith</ref> There, the first doctrines of religious freedom in Europe were established (in the course of several diets between 1557 and 1568, see [[Edict of Torda]]) under the jurisdiction of [[John Sigismund Z\u00e1polya|John Sigismund]], king of Hungary and Prince of Transylvania, the only Unitarian monarch. The early Unitarian church not only rejected the Trinity, but also the [[pre-existence of Christ]] as well as, in many cases, [[predestination]] and [[original sin]] as put forward by [[Augustine of Hippo]], and the [[substitutionary atonement]] of Christ developed by [[Anselm of Canterbury]] and John Calvin. There were several different forms of [[Christology]] in the beginnings of the Unitarian movement; ultimately, the dominant Christology became [[psilanthropism]]: that Jesus was a man, but one with a unique relationship to God.\n\n====Britain====\n{{main|History of Unitarianism}}\nInfluenced by the teachings of the Polish [[Socinians]], [[Samuel Clarke]] (1675\u20131729) revised the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'', removing the Trinitarian [[Nicene Creed]] and references to [[divinity of Jesus|Jesus as God]].<ref name=Clarke>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanunitarian.org/fisherhistory.htm |title=Chris Fisher, ''A Brief History of Unitarian Christianity'', retrieved July 18, 2008 |publisher=Americanunitarian.org |accessdate=2011-02-27}}</ref> [[Theophilus Lindsey]] also revised the ''Book of Common Prayer'' to allow a more tolerant, free Unitarian interpretation. Neither cleric was charged under the [[Blasphemy Act 1697]] that made it an \"offense for any person, educated in or having made profession of the Christian religion, by writing, preaching, teaching or advised speaking, to deny the [[Holy Trinity]]\". The [[Act of Toleration 1689|Act of Toleration]] (1689) gave relief to [[English Dissenters]], but excluded Unitarians. The efforts of Clarke and Lindsey met with substantial criticism from the more conservative clergy and laity of the [[Church of England]]. In response, in 1774, Lindsey applied for registration of the [[Essex Street Chapel|Essex House]] as a \"Dissenting place of worship\" with the assistance of [[barrister]] [[John Lee (Attorney-General)|John Lee]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1959_StoryEssexHall.pdf|first=Mortimer|last=Rowe|location=London|publisher=Lindsey Press}}</ref>  On the Sunday following the registration\u2014April 17, 1774\u2014the first true Unitarian congregation discreetly convened in the provisional Essex Street Chapel.

The official statement of Unitarian Universalist principles describes the \"sources\" upon which current practice is based:<ref name=sources/>{{quotation|\n* Direct experience of that transcending mystery and wonder, affirmed in all cultures, which moves us to a renewal of the spirit and an openness to the forces which create and uphold life;\n* Words and deeds of prophetic people which challenge us to confront powers and structures of evil with justice, compassion, and the transforming power of love;\n* Wisdom from the [[Major religious groups|world's religions]] which inspires us in our ethical and spiritual life;\n* Jewish and Christian teachings which call us to respond to God's love by loving our neighbors as ourselves;\n* [[Humanism|Humanist]] teachings which counsel us to heed the guidance of reason and the results of science, and warn us against idolatries of the mind and spirit.\n* Spiritual teachings of [[Earth religion|earth-centered traditions]] which celebrate the sacred circle of life and instruct us to live in harmony with the rhythms of nature.}}\n\nUnitarian Universalist principles and purposes have been modified over time to manifest a broader acceptance of beliefs and traditions among the membership. The seventh Principle (adopted in 1985), \"Respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part\", and a sixth Source (adopted in 1995), \"Spiritual teachings of earth-centered traditions which celebrate the sacred circle of life and instruct us to live in harmony with the rhythms of nature\" were added to explicitly include members with [[Modern Paganism|neopagan]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], and [[Pantheism|pantheist]] spiritualities.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.uuworld.org/ideas/articles/3643.shtml?lj\n | title = Shared values: How the UUA's Principles and Purposes were shaped and how they've shaped Unitarian Universalism\n | accessdate = 2007-02-24\n | author = Warren R.

Today, the Unitarian Universalist approach to the [[Bible|Christian Bible]], [[Tanakh|Hebrew Scriptures]], and other sacred works is presented by the UUA:\n{{quotation|While Unitarianism and Universalism both have roots in the Protestant Christian tradition, where the Bible is the sacred text, we now look to additional sources for religious and moral inspiration\u2026. We celebrate the spiritual insights of the world\u2019s religions, recognizing wisdom in many scriptures.\n\nWhen we read scripture in worship, whether it is the [[Bible]], the [[Dhammapada]], or the [[Tao Te-Ching]], we interpret it as a product of its time and its place,\u2026not to be interpreted narrowly or oppressively\u2026<nowiki>[</nowiki>S<nowiki>]</nowiki>cripture is never the only word, or the final word.\n\nFrom the beginning we have trusted in the human capacity to use reason and draw conclusions about religion\u2026 [E]ach of us ultimately chooses what is sacred to us.<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Sacred texts in Unitarian Universalism\n |url=https://www.uua.org/beliefs/what-we-believe/sacred-texts\n |access-date=2017-12-05\n}}</ref>}}\n\nIn short, Unitarian Universalists regard the texts of the world's religions as works of people, worthy of respect, with the intention that people from all religions or spiritual backgrounds live peaceably with one another.\n\n==Worship and practice==\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2011}}\n\n===Diversity of practices===\nThe Unitarian belief that reason, and not creed, defines the search for truth, and the Universalist belief that God embraces all people equally has led to the current Unitarian Universalist belief that truth and spiritual meaning can be found in all faiths. This is reflected in the wide array of spiritual practices found among Unitarian Universalists today. Many Unitarian Universalist congregations include Buddhist-style meditation groups, Jewish [[Passover Seder|Seder]], [[Yom Kippur]] and Passover dinners, ''[[iftaar]]'' meals (marking the breaking of Ramadan fast for Muslims), and Christmas Eve/[[Winter Solstice#Observances|Winter Solstice]] services. Children's and youth's religious education classes teach about the divinity of the world and the sanctity of world religions. One of its more popular curricula, Neighboring Faiths (formerly Church Across the Street), takes middle and high school participants to visit the places of worship of many faith traditions including a [[Hindu]] temple, a [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] or [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] synagogue, and a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] church.\n\nThere is great variety among Unitarian Universalist congregations, with some favoring particular religious beliefs or forms of worship over others, with many more home to an eclectic mix of beliefs. Regardless of their orientation, most congregations are fairly open to differing beliefs, though not always with various faith traditions represented to the same degree.\n\n===Diversity of congregations===\nThere is a wide variety in how congregations conceive of themselves, calling themselves \"churches\", \"societies\", \"fellowships\", \"congregations\", or eschew the use of any particular descriptor (e.g. \"[http://www.uusanmateo.org Unitarian Universalists of San Mateo]\"). Many use the name \"Unitarian Universalist\", (and a few \"Universalist Unitarian\"), having gradually adopted this formulation since consolidation in 1961. Others use names that reflect their historic roots by keeping the historical designation \"Unitarian\" or \"Universalist\" (e.g. \"[[First Unitarian Church (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)|First Unitarian Church]]\"). A few congregations use neither (e.g. [[Unity Temple]]). For some congregations, the name can be a clue to their theological orientation. For others, avoidance of the word \"church\" indicates a desire to distance itself from traditional Christian theology. Sometimes the use of another term may simply indicate a congregation's lay-led or relatively new status. However, some Unitarian Universalist congregations have grown to appreciate alternative terms such as ''fellowship'' and retained them even though they have grown much larger or lost features sometimes associated with their use (such as, in the case of fellowships, a traditionally lay-led worship model).<ref>See for examples: [http://www.uufellowship.org Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Northern Westchester] and [http://www.uuathensga.org/ Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Athens].</ref>\n\nAlso of note is that there are many more people who identify as Unitarian Universalist on surveys than those who attend Unitarian Universalist congregations (by a factor of four in a recent survey),<ref>[http://www.adherents.com/rel_USA.html Largest Religious Groups in the United States of America] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820080454/http://www.adherents.com/rel_USA.html |date=2018-08-20 }}, Adherents.com</ref> reflecting those who have never joined (and lapsed members) but nonetheless consider themselves part of the Unitarian Universalist movement.\n\n===Elevator speeches===\nIn 2004, ''UU World'' magazine asked for contributions of \"[[elevator pitch|elevator speeches]]\" explaining Unitarian Universalism.<ref>''UU World Magazine''.

Therefore, one's own truth is unprovable, as is that of others. Consequently, we should respect the beliefs of others, as well as their right to hold those beliefs. Conversely, we expect that others should respect our right to our own beliefs. Several UU's then, would likely hold as many different beliefs. Other beliefs they may hold in common are a respect for others, for nature, and for common decency, leading to a particular caring for the poor, the weak and the downtrodden. As a result, issues of justice, including social justice are held in common among most. | Gene Douglas, Harrah, OK<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uuduluth.org/newsletters/nov06news.html |title=Dear Ones |accessdate=2007-02-24 |author=Karen Johnson Gustafson |date=November 2006 |work=Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Duluth Newsletter |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929140837/http://www.uuduluth.org/newsletters/nov06news.html |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}</ref>}}\n\n{{quote | It's a blessing each of us was born; It matters what we do with our lives; What each of us knows about God is a piece of the truth; We don't have to do it alone.\n\n|Laila Ibrahim, Berkeley, CA<ref name=\"affirmations\"/>}}\n\n==Worship and ritual==\nAs in theology, Unitarian Universalist [[worship]] and [[ritual]] are often a combination of elements derived from other faith traditions alongside original practices and symbols. In form, church services might be difficult to distinguish from those of a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] church, but they vary widely among congregations.<ref name=\"Sias\"/>\n\n===Symbols===\nThe most common symbol of Unitarian Universalism is the [[flaming chalice]], often framed by two overlapping rings that many interpret as representing Unitarianism and Universalism (the symbol has no official interpretation). The chalice itself has long been a symbol of liberal religion, and indeed liberal Christianity (the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Disciples of Christ]] also use a chalice as their denomination symbol<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.disciples.org/AboutTheDisciples/TheChalice/tabid/70/Default.aspx \n |title=The Chalice \n |accessdate=2012-01-21 \n |publisher=[[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]] \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112154823/http://www.disciples.org/AboutTheDisciples/TheChalice/tabid/70/Default.aspx \n |archivedate=January 12, 2012 \n}}</ref>). The flaming chalice was initially the logo of the Unitarian Service Committee during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. It was created by Austrian artist [[Hans Deutsch]]. The holy oil burning in it is a symbol of helpfulness and sacrifice.\"<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.uua.org/aboutuu/chalice.html\n| title = The History of the Flaming Chalice\n| accessdate = 2007-02-24\n| author = Adapted from the pamphlet \"The Flaming Chalice\" by Daniel D. Hotchkiss\n| publisher = [[Unitarian Universalist Association]]}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, other interpretations have been suggested, such as the chalice used by the followers of Czech [[Jan Hus]], which was supposedly reverential of Eastern Orthodox traditions; although Hus's early National Church was intrinsically an evangelical Protestant. In some agnostic historiographies the flaming chalice displayed a vague resemblance to a cross in some stylized representations, relying on the sepulchral traditions of the Hospitallers.<ref>{{cite web|first=Mark W.|last=Harris|title=The A to Z of Unitarian Universalism| publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=London}}</ref>   Many Unitarian Universalist congregations light a chalice at the beginning of worship services. Other symbols include an [[Christian cross variants#Modern innovations|off-center cross within a circle]] (a Universalist symbol associated with the Humiliati movement in the 1950s, a group of reformist, liturgically minded clergy seeking to revive Universalism).\n\nOther symbols include a pair of open hands releasing a [[dove]].<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://archive.uua.org/CONG/chalices/\n| title = UU Chalices and Clip Art\n| accessdate = 2008-04-12\n| author = Steve Bridenbaugh\n| publisher = [[Unitarian Universalist Association]]}}</ref>\n\n===Services of worship===\n[[File:UM 1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[First Unitarian Society of Madison|Unitarian Meeting House]] designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Shorewood Hills, Wisconsin]].]]\nReligious services are usually held on Sundays and most closely resemble the form and format of Protestant worship in the Reformed tradition.<ref name=\"Sias\"/> Services at a vast majority of congregations follow a structure that focuses on a sermon or presentation by a minister, a lay leader of the congregation, or an invited speaker.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.uua.org/worshipweb/commonworship/vogt.html\n| title = Common Worship: How and Why; The contribution of Von Ogden Vogt\n| accessdate = 2007-02-24\n| author = Commission on Common Worship\n| year = 1983\n| work = Leading Congregations in Worship: A Guide\n| publisher = [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070217132901/http://www.uua.org/worshipweb/commonworship/vogt.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-02-17}}</ref> Sermons may cover a wide range of topics. Since Unitarian Universalists do not recognize a particular text or set of texts as primary or inherently superior, inspiration can be found in many different religious or cultural texts as well as the personal experiences of the minister.\n\nThe service also includes hymn-singing, accompanied by organ, piano, or other available instruments, and possibly led by a song leader or choir. The most recent worship songbook published by the denomination, ''Singing the Journey''<ref>{{cite book|isbn=1-55896-499-1|title=Singing the Journey|year=2005}}</ref> contains 75 songs and is a supplement to the older ''Singing the Living Tradition'' which contains readings as well.<ref>{{cite book|isbn=1-55896-260-3|title=Singing the Living Tradition|year=1993}}</ref> Hymns typically sung in Unitarian Universalist services come from a variety of sources\u2014traditional [[hymn tune]]s with new or adapted lyrics, spirituals, folk songs from various cultures, or original compositions by Unitarian Universalist musicians are just a few. Instrumental music is also a common feature of the typical worship service, including preludes, offertory music, postludes, or music for contemplation.\n\nPastoral elements of the service may include a time for sharing Joys and Sorrows/Concerns, where individuals in the congregation are invited to [[Ceremonial use of lights|light a candle]] or say a few words about important events in their personal lives. Many also include a time of [[meditation]] or [[prayer]], led by the minister or service leader, both spoken and silent. Responsive readings and stories for children are also typical. Many congregations also allow for a time at the end of the service, called \"talk back\", where members of the congregation can respond to the sermon with their own insights and questions, or even disagree with the viewpoint expressed by the minister or invited speaker.\n\nMany Unitarian Universalist congregations no longer observe the Christian symbols of [[baptism]], [[Eucharist|communion]], or [[confirmation]], at least in their traditional forms or under their traditional names. Congregations that continue these practices under their more traditional names are often [[federated congregation|federated church]]es or members of the Council of Christian Churches within the Unitarian Universalist Association (CCCUUA), or may have active chapters associated with the [[Unitarian Universalist Christian Fellowship]] or similar covenant groups.<ref>[http://www.liveoakuu.org/christian04.htm Christians 2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108233643/http://www.liveoakuu.org/christian04.htm |date=January 8, 2009 }}</ref> \"Child dedications\" often replace more traditional infant baptisms (such \"dedications\" are sometimes practiced even in \"orthodox\" Christian communities that do not baptize infants for theological reasons).

The \n[[Rochester Women's Rights Convention of 1848|second women's rights convention]] was held at the [[First Unitarian Church of Rochester|First Unitarian Church of Rochester, New York]].

Anthony]], a Unitarian and [[Quaker]], was extremely influential in the women's [[suffrage]] movement. Unitarian Universalists and Quakers still share many principles. It is therefore common to see Unitarian Universalists and Quakers working together.\n\nUnitarian Universalists were and are still very involved in the fight to end [[racism]] in the United States. [[John Haynes Holmes]], a Unitarian minister and social activist at The Community Church of New York\u2014Unitarian Universalist were among the founders of both the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) in 1909 and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), chairing the latter for a time. [[James J. Reeb]], a minister at [[All Souls Church, Unitarian (Washington, D.C.)|All Souls Church, Unitarian]], in [[Washington, D.C.]] and a member of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]], was clubbed in [[Selma, Alabama]] on March 8, 1965, and died two days later of massive head trauma. Two weeks after his death, [[Viola Liuzzo]], a Unitarian Universalist civil rights activist, was murdered by white supremacists after her participation in the protest march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. The [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] for voting rights are best known for [[Bloody Sunday (1965)|Bloody Sunday]], which refers to March 7, 1965, the most violent of the three marches.\n\nThe past head of the Unitarian Universalist Association 2001\u20132009, [[William G.

Politically conservative Unitarian Universalists point out that neither religious liberalism nor the Principles and Purposes of the UUA require liberal politics. Like the beliefs of Unitarian Universalists, politics are decided by individuals, not by congregations or the denomination.\n\nSeveral congregations have undertaken a series of organizational, procedural and practical steps to become acknowledged as a \"[[Unitarian Universalism and LGBT topics#Welcoming Congregation|Welcoming Congregation]]\": a congregation which has taken specific steps to welcome and integrate gay, lesbian, bisexual & transgender (LGBT) members. Unitarian Universalist ministers perform [[same-sex unions]] and now [[same-sex marriages]] where legal (and sometimes when not, as a form of civil protest). On June 29, 1984, the Unitarian Universalists became the first major church \"to approve religious blessings on homosexual unions.\"<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E0DB1539F93AA15755C0A962948260 \"Unitarians Endorse Homosexual Marriages\"], UPI, ''The New York Times'', 29 June 1984.</ref> Unitarian Universalists have been in the forefront of the work to make same-sex marriages legal in their local states and provinces, as well as on the national level. Gay men, bisexuals, and lesbians are also regularly [[ordained]] as ministers, and a number of gay, bisexual, and lesbian ministers have, themselves, now become legally married to their partners. In May 2004, [[Arlington Street Church (Boston)|Arlington Street Church]], in Boston, Massachusetts, was the site of the first state-sanctioned same-sex marriage in the United States. The official stance of the UUA is for the legalization of same-sex marriage\u2014\"Standing on the Side of Love\". In 2004 UU minister Debra Haffner of [[The Religious Institute on Sexual Morality, Justice, and Healing]] published ''An Open Letter on Religious Leaders on Marriage Equality'' to affirm same-sex marriage from a multi-faith perspective. In December 2009, Washington, D.C. Mayor [[Adrian Fenty]] signed the bill to legalize same-sex marriage for the [[District of Columbia]] in [[All Souls Church, Unitarian (Washington, D.C.)]]\n\n[[Unitarian Universalists for Polyamory Awareness]] engages Unitarian Universalist ministers and other leaders to educate them on [[polyamory]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uupa.org|title=UUPA website }}</ref> At the 2015 [[General Assembly (Unitarian Universalist Association)|UUA General Assembly]], the Association's non-discrimination rule was amended to include the category of \"family and relationship structures\";<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uua.org/uuagovernance/bylaws/ruleii/section-c-23-non-discrimination |title=Unitarian Universalist Association: Rule II, Section C-2.3.: Non-discrimination |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518103753/http://www.uua.org/uuagovernance/bylaws/ruleii/section-c-23-non-discrimination |archivedate=2015-05-18}}</ref> the UUA has yet to take specific follow-up action on this, however.\n\nMany congregations are heavily involved in projects and efforts aimed at supporting environmental causes and [[sustainability]].

The [[American Unitarian Conference]] and the [[Christian Universalist Association]] are the two most significant organizations representing these theological beliefs today. Christians who hold these beliefs tend to consider themselves the true Unitarians or Universalists and heirs of the theological legacy of the original [[American Unitarian Association]] or [[Universalist Church of America]], and they do not wish to be confused with Unitarian Universalists. The [[Unity Church]] is another denomination that is often confused with Unitarian Universalism.<ref>See [http://www.americanunitarian.org/voicearticle.htm \"Why the American Unitarian Conference Had to Be Formed\"] and [http://www.christianuniversalist.org/articles/unitarian.html \"What Is the Difference between Christian Universalism and Unitarian Universalism?\"]</ref>\n\n===Internal===\n\n====Language of reverence====\nDuring the presidency of William Sinkford, debate within the Unitarian Universalist movement roiled over his call to return to or create an authentic Unitarian Universalist \"language of reverence.\" Sinkford suggested that Unitarian Universalists abandoned traditional religious language, thereby abandoning words with potential power to others who will then dictate their meanings in the public sphere. He suggested that Unitarian Universalists regain their proper seat at the interfaith table by making this language their own. Others reacted to this call by believing it to be part of an effort to return Unitarian Universalist congregations to more orthodox Christian worship patterns. Sinkford denied this, citing the words of Unitarian Universalist humanists as examples of what he means by the \"language of reverence.\" The growth of humanism in Unitarianism was determined by a desire to raise the profile to a universal audience, educating atheists and agnostics in biblical literacy among the wider congregation of Unitarian Universalists, many of whom were born into families that lacked the rigour of a moral catechism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uuworld.org/articles/need-language-reverence|title=Human reverence: The language of reverence is the language of humanity|date=2006-07-31|first=Kendyl L.R.|last=Gibbons|publisher=UU World: Liberal religion and life|accessdate=2017-12-26}}</ref>\nThe debate included the publication of a book by the UUA's [[Beacon Press]] written by former UUA President John Buehrens.<ref>{{cite web|last=Buehrens |first=John A. |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/story/132/story_13272_1.html |title=Past Unitarian Universalist Association President John A.

It provides interpretative strategies, so that Unitarian Universalists (among others) might be able to engage in public debate about what the Bible says from a liberal religious perspective, rather than relinquishing to religious conservatives, and other more literal interpretations, all control over the book's contents and significance in matters of public and civic import.

The term may refer to any belief about the nature of [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] that affirms [[God]] as a singular entity and rejects the doctrine of the [[Trinity]], as affirmed by the [[Nicene Creed|mainstream Christianity]]: a consensus of Christian bishops at the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325. Nontrinitarianism was especially prevalent during the theological turmoils of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. A Spanish physician, [[Michael Servetus]], studied the Bible and concluded that the concept of the Trinity, as traditionally conceived, was not biblical. His books ''On the Errors of the Trinity'' and ''Christianismi Restitutio'' caused much uproar. Servetus was eventually arrested, convicted of heresy, and burned at the stake in [[Geneva]] in 1553.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miguelservet.org/servetus/biography.htm |title=Michael Servetus Institute; Times that Servetus lived |publisher=Miguelservet.org |accessdate=2011-02-27}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"Unitarian\" entered the English language via [[Henry Hedworth]], who applied it to the teachings of [[Laelio Sozzini]] and the Polish [[Socinians]]. Unitarian churches were formally established in [[Transylvania]] and [[Poland]] (by the [[Socinianism|Socinians]]) in the second half of the 16th century.<ref name=\"Harris\">Harris, MW. Unitarian Universalist Origins: Our Historic Faith</ref> There, the first doctrines of religious freedom in Europe were established (in the course of several diets between 1557 and 1568, see [[Edict of Torda]]) under the jurisdiction of [[John Sigismund Z\u00e1polya|John Sigismund]], king of Hungary and Prince of Transylvania, the only Unitarian monarch. The early Unitarian church not only rejected the Trinity, but also the [[pre-existence of Christ]] as well as, in many cases, [[predestination]] and [[original sin]] as put forward by [[Augustine of Hippo]], and the [[substitutionary atonement]] of Christ developed by [[Anselm of Canterbury]] and John Calvin. There were several different forms of [[Christology]] in the beginnings of the Unitarian movement; ultimately, the dominant Christology became [[psilanthropism]]: that Jesus was a man, but one with a unique relationship to God.\n\n====Britain====\n{{main|History of Unitarianism}}\nInfluenced by the teachings of the Polish [[Socinians]], [[Samuel Clarke]] (1675\u20131729) revised the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'', removing the Trinitarian [[Nicene Creed]] and references to [[divinity of Jesus|Jesus as God]].<ref name=Clarke>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanunitarian.org/fisherhistory.htm |title=Chris Fisher, ''A Brief History of Unitarian Christianity'', retrieved July 18, 2008 |publisher=Americanunitarian.org |accessdate=2011-02-27}}</ref> [[Theophilus Lindsey]] also revised the ''Book of Common Prayer'' to allow a more tolerant, free Unitarian interpretation. Neither cleric was charged under the [[Blasphemy Act 1697]] that made it an \"offense for any person, educated in or having made profession of the Christian religion, by writing, preaching, teaching or advised speaking, to deny the [[Holy Trinity]]\". The [[Act of Toleration 1689|Act of Toleration]] (1689) gave relief to [[English Dissenters]], but excluded Unitarians. The efforts of Clarke and Lindsey met with substantial criticism from the more conservative clergy and laity of the [[Church of England]].

We celebrate the spiritual insights of the world\u2019s religions, recognizing wisdom in many scriptures.\n\nWhen we read scripture in worship, whether it is the [[Bible]], the [[Dhammapada]], or the [[Tao Te-Ching]], we interpret it as a product of its time and its place,\u2026not to be interpreted narrowly or oppressively\u2026<nowiki>[</nowiki>S<nowiki>]</nowiki>cripture is never the only word, or the final word.\n\nFrom the beginning we have trusted in the human capacity to use reason and draw conclusions about religion\u2026 [E]ach of us ultimately chooses what is sacred to us.<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Sacred texts in Unitarian Universalism\n |url=https://www.uua.org/beliefs/what-we-believe/sacred-texts\n |access-date=2017-12-05\n}}</ref>}}\n\nIn short, Unitarian Universalists regard the texts of the world's religions as works of people, worthy of respect, with the intention that people from all religions or spiritual backgrounds live peaceably with one another.\n\n==Worship and practice==\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2011}}\n\n===Diversity of practices===\nThe Unitarian belief that reason, and not creed, defines the search for truth, and the Universalist belief that God embraces all people equally has led to the current Unitarian Universalist belief that truth and spiritual meaning can be found in all faiths. This is reflected in the wide array of spiritual practices found among Unitarian Universalists today. Many Unitarian Universalist congregations include Buddhist-style meditation groups, Jewish [[Passover Seder|Seder]], [[Yom Kippur]] and Passover dinners, ''[[iftaar]]'' meals (marking the breaking of Ramadan fast for Muslims), and Christmas Eve/[[Winter Solstice#Observances|Winter Solstice]] services. Children's and youth's religious education classes teach about the divinity of the world and the sanctity of world religions. One of its more popular curricula, Neighboring Faiths (formerly Church Across the Street), takes middle and high school participants to visit the places of worship of many faith traditions including a [[Hindu]] temple, a [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] or [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] synagogue, and a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] church.\n\nThere is great variety among Unitarian Universalist congregations, with some favoring particular religious beliefs or forms of worship over others, with many more home to an eclectic mix of beliefs. Regardless of their orientation, most congregations are fairly open to differing beliefs, though not always with various faith traditions represented to the same degree.\n\n===Diversity of congregations===\nThere is a wide variety in how congregations conceive of themselves, calling themselves \"churches\", \"societies\", \"fellowships\", \"congregations\", or eschew the use of any particular descriptor (e.g. \"[http://www.uusanmateo.org Unitarian Universalists of San Mateo]\"). Many use the name \"Unitarian Universalist\", (and a few \"Universalist Unitarian\"), having gradually adopted this formulation since consolidation in 1961. Others use names that reflect their historic roots by keeping the historical designation \"Unitarian\" or \"Universalist\" (e.g. \"[[First Unitarian Church (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)|First Unitarian Church]]\"). A few congregations use neither (e.g. [[Unity Temple]]). For some congregations, the name can be a clue to their theological orientation. For others, avoidance of the word \"church\" indicates a desire to distance itself from traditional Christian theology. Sometimes the use of another term may simply indicate a congregation's lay-led or relatively new status. However, some Unitarian Universalist congregations have grown to appreciate alternative terms such as ''fellowship'' and retained them even though they have grown much larger or lost features sometimes associated with their use (such as, in the case of fellowships, a traditionally lay-led worship model).<ref>See for examples: [http://www.uufellowship.org Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Northern Westchester] and [http://www.uuathensga.org/ Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Athens].</ref>\n\nAlso of note is that there are many more people who identify as Unitarian Universalist on surveys than those who attend Unitarian Universalist congregations (by a factor of four in a recent survey),<ref>[http://www.adherents.com/rel_USA.html Largest Religious Groups in the United States of America] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820080454/http://www.adherents.com/rel_USA.html |date=2018-08-20 }}, Adherents.com</ref> reflecting those who have never joined (and lapsed members) but nonetheless consider themselves part of the Unitarian Universalist movement.\n\n===Elevator speeches===\nIn 2004, ''UU World'' magazine asked for contributions of \"[[elevator pitch|elevator speeches]]\" explaining Unitarian Universalism.<ref>''UU World Magazine''.

Therefore, one's own truth is unprovable, as is that of others. Consequently, we should respect the beliefs of others, as well as their right to hold those beliefs. Conversely, we expect that others should respect our right to our own beliefs. Several UU's then, would likely hold as many different beliefs. Other beliefs they may hold in common are a respect for others, for nature, and for common decency, leading to a particular caring for the poor, the weak and the downtrodden.

In form, church services might be difficult to distinguish from those of a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] church, but they vary widely among congregations.<ref name=\"Sias\"/>\n\n===Symbols===\nThe most common symbol of Unitarian Universalism is the [[flaming chalice]], often framed by two overlapping rings that many interpret as representing Unitarianism and Universalism (the symbol has no official interpretation). The chalice itself has long been a symbol of liberal religion, and indeed liberal Christianity (the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Disciples of Christ]] also use a chalice as their denomination symbol<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.disciples.org/AboutTheDisciples/TheChalice/tabid/70/Default.aspx \n |title=The Chalice \n |accessdate=2012-01-21 \n |publisher=[[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]] \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112154823/http://www.disciples.org/AboutTheDisciples/TheChalice/tabid/70/Default.aspx \n |archivedate=January 12, 2012 \n}}</ref>). The flaming chalice was initially the logo of the Unitarian Service Committee during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. It was created by Austrian artist [[Hans Deutsch]]. The holy oil burning in it is a symbol of helpfulness and sacrifice.\"<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.uua.org/aboutuu/chalice.html\n| title = The History of the Flaming Chalice\n| accessdate = 2007-02-24\n| author = Adapted from the pamphlet \"The Flaming Chalice\" by Daniel D. Hotchkiss\n| publisher = [[Unitarian Universalist Association]]}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, other interpretations have been suggested, such as the chalice used by the followers of Czech [[Jan Hus]], which was supposedly reverential of Eastern Orthodox traditions; although Hus's early National Church was intrinsically an evangelical Protestant. In some agnostic historiographies the flaming chalice displayed a vague resemblance to a cross in some stylized representations, relying on the sepulchral traditions of the Hospitallers.<ref>{{cite web|first=Mark W.|last=Harris|title=The A to Z of Unitarian Universalism| publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=London}}</ref>   Many Unitarian Universalist congregations light a chalice at the beginning of worship services. Other symbols include an [[Christian cross variants#Modern innovations|off-center cross within a circle]] (a Universalist symbol associated with the Humiliati movement in the 1950s, a group of reformist, liturgically minded clergy seeking to revive Universalism).\n\nOther symbols include a pair of open hands releasing a [[dove]].<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://archive.uua.org/CONG/chalices/\n| title = UU Chalices and Clip Art\n| accessdate = 2008-04-12\n| author = Steve Bridenbaugh\n| publisher = [[Unitarian Universalist Association]]}}</ref>\n\n===Services of worship===\n[[File:UM 1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[First Unitarian Society of Madison|Unitarian Meeting House]] designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Shorewood Hills, Wisconsin]].]]\nReligious services are usually held on Sundays and most closely resemble the form and format of Protestant worship in the Reformed tradition.<ref name=\"Sias\"/> Services at a vast majority of congregations follow a structure that focuses on a sermon or presentation by a minister, a lay leader of the congregation, or an invited speaker.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.uua.org/worshipweb/commonworship/vogt.html\n| title = Common Worship: How and Why; The contribution of Von Ogden Vogt\n| accessdate = 2007-02-24\n| author = Commission on Common Worship\n| year = 1983\n| work = Leading Congregations in Worship: A Guide\n| publisher = [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070217132901/http://www.uua.org/worshipweb/commonworship/vogt.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-02-17}}</ref> Sermons may cover a wide range of topics. Since Unitarian Universalists do not recognize a particular text or set of texts as primary or inherently superior, inspiration can be found in many different religious or cultural texts as well as the personal experiences of the minister.\n\nThe service also includes hymn-singing, accompanied by organ, piano, or other available instruments, and possibly led by a song leader or choir. The most recent worship songbook published by the denomination, ''Singing the Journey''<ref>{{cite book|isbn=1-55896-499-1|title=Singing the Journey|year=2005}}</ref> contains 75 songs and is a supplement to the older ''Singing the Living Tradition'' which contains readings as well.<ref>{{cite book|isbn=1-55896-260-3|title=Singing the Living Tradition|year=1993}}</ref> Hymns typically sung in Unitarian Universalist services come from a variety of sources\u2014traditional [[hymn tune]]s with new or adapted lyrics, spirituals, folk songs from various cultures, or original compositions by Unitarian Universalist musicians are just a few. Instrumental music is also a common feature of the typical worship service, including preludes, offertory music, postludes, or music for contemplation.\n\nPastoral elements of the service may include a time for sharing Joys and Sorrows/Concerns, where individuals in the congregation are invited to [[Ceremonial use of lights|light a candle]] or say a few words about important events in their personal lives. Many also include a time of [[meditation]] or [[prayer]], led by the minister or service leader, both spoken and silent. Responsive readings and stories for children are also typical. Many congregations also allow for a time at the end of the service, called \"talk back\", where members of the congregation can respond to the sermon with their own insights and questions, or even disagree with the viewpoint expressed by the minister or invited speaker.\n\nMany Unitarian Universalist congregations no longer observe the Christian symbols of [[baptism]], [[Eucharist|communion]], or [[confirmation]], at least in their traditional forms or under their traditional names. Congregations that continue these practices under their more traditional names are often [[federated congregation|federated church]]es or members of the Council of Christian Churches within the Unitarian Universalist Association (CCCUUA), or may have active chapters associated with the [[Unitarian Universalist Christian Fellowship]] or similar covenant groups.<ref>[http://www.liveoakuu.org/christian04.htm Christians 2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108233643/http://www.liveoakuu.org/christian04.htm |date=January 8, 2009 }}</ref> \"Child dedications\" often replace more traditional infant baptisms (such \"dedications\" are sometimes practiced even in \"orthodox\" Christian communities that do not baptize infants for theological reasons).

The \n[[Rochester Women's Rights Convention of 1848|second women's rights convention]] was held at the [[First Unitarian Church of Rochester|First Unitarian Church of Rochester, New York]].

Anthony]], a Unitarian and [[Quaker]], was extremely influential in the women's [[suffrage]] movement. Unitarian Universalists and Quakers still share many principles. It is therefore common to see Unitarian Universalists and Quakers working together.\n\nUnitarian Universalists were and are still very involved in the fight to end [[racism]] in the United States. [[John Haynes Holmes]], a Unitarian minister and social activist at The Community Church of New York\u2014Unitarian Universalist were among the founders of both the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) in 1909 and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), chairing the latter for a time. [[James J. Reeb]], a minister at [[All Souls Church, Unitarian (Washington, D.C.)|All Souls Church, Unitarian]], in [[Washington, D.C.]] and a member of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]], was clubbed in [[Selma, Alabama]] on March 8, 1965, and died two days later of massive head trauma. Two weeks after his death, [[Viola Liuzzo]], a Unitarian Universalist civil rights activist, was murdered by white supremacists after her participation in the protest march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. The [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] for voting rights are best known for [[Bloody Sunday (1965)|Bloody Sunday]], which refers to March 7, 1965, the most violent of the three marches.\n\nThe past head of the Unitarian Universalist Association 2001\u20132009, [[William G.

Politically conservative Unitarian Universalists point out that neither religious liberalism nor the Principles and Purposes of the UUA require liberal politics. Like the beliefs of Unitarian Universalists, politics are decided by individuals, not by congregations or the denomination.\n\nSeveral congregations have undertaken a series of organizational, procedural and practical steps to become acknowledged as a \"[[Unitarian Universalism and LGBT topics#Welcoming Congregation|Welcoming Congregation]]\": a congregation which has taken specific steps to welcome and integrate gay, lesbian, bisexual & transgender (LGBT) members. Unitarian Universalist ministers perform [[same-sex unions]] and now [[same-sex marriages]] where legal (and sometimes when not, as a form of civil protest). On June 29, 1984, the Unitarian Universalists became the first major church \"to approve religious blessings on homosexual unions.\"<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E0DB1539F93AA15755C0A962948260 \"Unitarians Endorse Homosexual Marriages\"], UPI, ''The New York Times'', 29 June 1984.</ref> Unitarian Universalists have been in the forefront of the work to make same-sex marriages legal in their local states and provinces, as well as on the national level. Gay men, bisexuals, and lesbians are also regularly [[ordained]] as ministers, and a number of gay, bisexual, and lesbian ministers have, themselves, now become legally married to their partners. In May 2004, [[Arlington Street Church (Boston)|Arlington Street Church]], in Boston, Massachusetts, was the site of the first state-sanctioned same-sex marriage in the United States. The official stance of the UUA is for the legalization of same-sex marriage\u2014\"Standing on the Side of Love\". In 2004 UU minister Debra Haffner of [[The Religious Institute on Sexual Morality, Justice, and Healing]] published ''An Open Letter on Religious Leaders on Marriage Equality'' to affirm same-sex marriage from a multi-faith perspective. In December 2009, Washington, D.C. Mayor [[Adrian Fenty]] signed the bill to legalize same-sex marriage for the [[District of Columbia]] in [[All Souls Church, Unitarian (Washington, D.C.)]]\n\n[[Unitarian Universalists for Polyamory Awareness]] engages Unitarian Universalist ministers and other leaders to educate them on [[polyamory]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uupa.org|title=UUPA website }}</ref> At the 2015 [[General Assembly (Unitarian Universalist Association)|UUA General Assembly]], the Association's non-discrimination rule was amended to include the category of \"family and relationship structures\";<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uua.org/uuagovernance/bylaws/ruleii/section-c-23-non-discrimination |title=Unitarian Universalist Association: Rule II, Section C-2.3.: Non-discrimination |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518103753/http://www.uua.org/uuagovernance/bylaws/ruleii/section-c-23-non-discrimination |archivedate=2015-05-18}}</ref> the UUA has yet to take specific follow-up action on this, however.\n\nMany congregations are heavily involved in projects and efforts aimed at supporting environmental causes and [[sustainability]].

The [[American Unitarian Conference]] and the [[Christian Universalist Association]] are the two most significant organizations representing these theological beliefs today. Christians who hold these beliefs tend to consider themselves the true Unitarians or Universalists and heirs of the theological legacy of the original [[American Unitarian Association]] or [[Universalist Church of America]], and they do not wish to be confused with Unitarian Universalists. The [[Unity Church]] is another denomination that is often confused with Unitarian Universalism.<ref>See [http://www.americanunitarian.org/voicearticle.htm \"Why the American Unitarian Conference Had to Be Formed\"] and [http://www.christianuniversalist.org/articles/unitarian.html \"What Is the Difference between Christian Universalism and Unitarian Universalism?\"]</ref>\n\n===Internal===\n\n====Language of reverence====\nDuring the presidency of William Sinkford, debate within the Unitarian Universalist movement had roiled over his call to return to or create an authentic Unitarian Universalist \"language of reverence.\" Sinkford has suggested that Unitarian Universalists have abandoned traditional religious language, thereby abandoning words with potential power to others who will then dictate their meanings in the public sphere. He has suggested that Unitarian Universalists regain their proper seat at the interfaith table by making this language their own. Others have reacted to this call by believing it to be part of an effort to return Unitarian Universalist congregations to more orthodox Christian worship patterns. Sinkford has denied this, citing the words of Unitarian Universalist humanists as examples of what he means by the \"language of reverence.\" The growth of humanism in Unitarianism was determined by a desire to raise the profile to a universal audience, educating atheists and agnostics in biblical literacy among the wider congregation of Unitarian Universalists, many of whom were born into families that lacked the rigour of a moral catechism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uuworld.org/articles/need-language-reverence|title=Human reverence: The language of reverence is the language of humanity|date=2006-07-31|first=Kendyl L.R.|last=Gibbons|publisher=UU World: Liberal religion and life|accessdate=2017-12-26}}</ref>\nThe debate included the publication of a book by the UUA's [[Beacon Press]] written by former UUA President John Buehrens.<ref>{{cite web|last=Buehrens |first=John A. |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/story/132/story_13272_1.html |title=Past Unitarian Universalist Association President John A.

It is named after [[Bromley]], its principal town; other major towns are [[Penge]],  [[Hayes]], [[West Wickham]], [[Chislehurst]], [[Beckenham]] and [[Orpington]]. The local authority is [[Bromley London Borough Council]].{{Refn|group=n|As a borough, the alternative legal form of address, as shown, in most leases granted by it and in older Law Reports is '''The Mayor and Burgesses of the London Borough of Bromley'''}}\n\n==Geography==\nThe borough is the largest in Greater Thaif is gay London by area and occupies {{convert|59|sqmi|km2|0}}. The majority of the borough is [[Metropolitan Green Belt]], including nearly all of the land south of the A232-A21 route between West Wickham and Pratts Bottom.<ref>London Green Belt Council http://londongreenbeltcouncil.org.uk/threats_map/</ref> Consequently, it is also perhaps the most rural borough and contains more of the [[North Downs]] than any other, as that escarpment is broad between Bromley and Banstead. This is also reflected in its population density, which is the lowest of the 32 London boroughs.<ref>https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/land-area-and-population-density-ward-and-borough</ref>\n\nMost of the population lives in the north and west of the borough, with an outlier at [[Biggin Hill]] in the far south. The borough shares borders with the London Boroughs of [[London Borough of Lewisham|Lewisham]] and [[Royal Borough of Greenwich|Greenwich]] to the north, [[London Borough of Bexley|Bexley]] to the north-east, [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark]] and [[London Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]] to the north-west, and [[London Borough of Croydon|Croydon]] to the west. It also borders the [[Sevenoaks District]] of [[Kent]] to the east and south, and the [[Tandridge District]] of [[Surrey]] to the south-west.\n\n[[Westerham Heights]], the [[List of highest points in London|highest point in London]] at an altitude of 804 feet (245 m), is on the southern boundary. The [[Prime Meridian]] passes through Bromley.\n\nAbout 30% of the land in Bromley is farmland, the highest figure of a London Borough.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalgrowth.org/big_idea/facts_figures/|title=Capital Growth: Facts and figures about food growing and farming in and around London|website=www.capitalgrowth.org|accessdate=25 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330215755/http://www.capitalgrowth.org/big_idea/facts_figures/|archivedate=30 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe borough was formed on 1 April 1965 by the [[London Government Act 1963]]. It covered the areas of the [[Municipal Borough of Bromley]], the [[Municipal Borough of Beckenham]], [[Penge Urban District]], [[Orpington Urban District]] and the [[Chislehurst]] part of [[Chislehurst and Sidcup Urban District]]. The local government authorities that until then had administered those other areas were simultaneously abolished by the London Government Act on 1 April 1965.\nIn 1969, after a local campaign, local government responsibility for the village of [[Knockholt]] was transferred to the neighbouring [[Sevenoaks Rural District]]: before 1965, it had been part of the [[Orpington Urban District]].\n\n==Districts==\n{{see also|List of districts in Bromley}}\n[[File:Sundridge Park Manor, Willoughby Lane, Bromley-geograph-2422018.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Sundridge Park]]\nThe borough is partly urban and partly rural, the former to the north and very much part of the built-up area of suburban London.\n\nThe principal parts of the northern section, from west to east, are [[Beckenham]], which includes [[Eden Park, London, England|Eden Park]] and [[Elmers End]]; [[Bromley]] with [[Bickley]], Bromley Park and [[Bromley Common]], Park Langley, Plaistow, [[Shortlands]] and Southborough; [[Chislehurst]], with [[Elmstead, London|Elmstead]] and [[Sundridge, London|Sundridge]]. The built-up area around [[Orpington]] not only encompasses its direct outskirts of [[Chelsfield]], Crofton, Derry Downs, [[Goddington]], Kevingtown, and [[Petts Wood]]; it also includes the erstwhile separate settlements of [[Farnborough, London|Farnborough]], [[Green Street Green]], [[Pratts Bottom]], [[St Mary Cray]] and [[St Paul's Cray]]. Other smaller suburban areas include [[Anerley]] and nearby [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]]; and [[Penge]]. In addition, parts of [[Mottingham]], [[Sydenham, London|Sydenham]], [[Swanley]] and [[Ruxley]] lie within the borough boundaries.\n\nThere are two main built-up areas in the southern part of the borough: [[Hayes, Bromley|Hayes]] and [[West Wickham]]. [[Biggin Hill]], [[Downe]] and [[Keston]] with [[Leaves Green]] and Nash are separate, smaller, rural settlements.\n\nLocal attractions include [[Down House]] (the home of [[Charles Darwin]]), [[Chislehurst Caves]], [[Holwood House]] (the home of [[William Pitt the Younger]]), [[Crofton Roman Villa]], and the site of [[The Crystal Palace]].\n\n==Governance==\n{{See also|List of electoral wards in Greater London#Bromley|label 1=List of electoral wards in Bromley}}\n[[File:Bromley Ward Map.PNG|left|thumb|The 22 wards of the London Borough of Bromley (orange) and the surrounding London boroughs (yellow) and districts outside Greater London (grey)]]\nBromley is divided into 22 [[Wards of the United Kingdom|wards]] with a total of 60 council seats.

When the railways arrived, the rate of [[population growth]] increased. The population peaked in the 1970s, when industry began to relocate from London.\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 UK Census]], the borough had a population of 309,392.

It is named after [[Bromley]], its principal town; other major towns are [[Penge]],  [[Hayes]], [[West Wickham]], [[Chislehurst]], [[Beckenham]] and [[Orpington]]. The local authority is [[Bromley London Borough Council]].{{Refn|group=n|As a borough, the alternative legal form of address, as shown, in most leases granted by it and in older Law Reports is '''The Mayor and Burgesses of the London Borough of Bromley'''}}\n\n==Geography==\nThe borough is the largest in Greater London by area and occupies {{convert|59|sqmi|km2|0}}. The majority of the borough is [[Metropolitan Green Belt]], including nearly all of the land south of the A232-A21 route between West Wickham and Pratts Bottom.<ref>London Green Belt Council http://londongreenbeltcouncil.org.uk/threats_map/</ref> Consequently, it is also perhaps the most rural borough and contains more of the [[North Downs]] than any other, as that escarpment is broad between Bromley and Banstead. This is also reflected in its population density, which is the lowest of the 32 London boroughs.<ref>https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/land-area-and-population-density-ward-and-borough</ref>\n\nMost of the population lives in the north and west of the borough, with an outlier at [[Biggin Hill]] in the far south. The borough shares borders with the London Boroughs of [[London Borough of Lewisham|Lewisham]] and [[Royal Borough of Greenwich|Greenwich]] to the north, [[London Borough of Bexley|Bexley]] to the north-east, [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark]] and [[London Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]] to the north-west, and [[London Borough of Croydon|Croydon]] to the west. It also borders the [[Sevenoaks District]] of [[Kent]] to the east and south, and the [[Tandridge District]] of [[Surrey]] to the south-west.\n\n[[Westerham Heights]], the [[List of highest points in London|highest point in London]] at an altitude of 804 feet (245 m), is on the southern boundary. The [[Prime Meridian]] passes through Bromley.\n\nAbout 30% of the land in Bromley is farmland, the highest figure of a London Borough.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalgrowth.org/big_idea/facts_figures/|title=Capital Growth: Facts and figures about food growing and farming in and around London|website=www.capitalgrowth.org|accessdate=25 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330215755/http://www.capitalgrowth.org/big_idea/facts_figures/|archivedate=30 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe borough was formed on 1 April 1965 by the [[London Government Act 1963]]. It covered the areas of the [[Municipal Borough of Bromley]], the [[Municipal Borough of Beckenham]], [[Penge Urban District]], [[Orpington Urban District]] and the [[Chislehurst]] part of [[Chislehurst and Sidcup Urban District]]. The local government authorities that until then had administered those other areas were simultaneously abolished by the London Government Act on 1 April 1965.\nIn 1969, after a local campaign, local government responsibility for the village of [[Knockholt]] was transferred to the neighbouring [[Sevenoaks Rural District]]: before 1965, it had been part of the [[Orpington Urban District]].\n\n==Districts==\n{{see also|List of districts in Bromley}}\n[[File:Sundridge Park Manor, Willoughby Lane, Bromley-geograph-2422018.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Sundridge Park]]\nThe borough is partly urban and partly rural, the former to the north and very much part of the built-up area of suburban London.\n\nThe principal parts of the northern section, from west to east, are [[Beckenham]], which includes [[Eden Park, London, England|Eden Park]] and [[Elmers End]]; [[Bromley]] with [[Bickley]], Bromley Park and [[Bromley Common]], Park Langley, Plaistow, [[Shortlands]] and Southborough; [[Chislehurst]], with [[Elmstead, London|Elmstead]] and [[Sundridge, London|Sundridge]]. The built-up area around [[Orpington]] not only encompasses its direct outskirts of [[Chelsfield]], Crofton, Derry Downs, [[Goddington]], Kevingtown, and [[Petts Wood]]; it also includes the erstwhile separate settlements of [[Farnborough, London|Farnborough]], [[Green Street Green]], [[Pratts Bottom]], [[St Mary Cray]] and [[St Paul's Cray]]. Other smaller suburban areas include [[Anerley]] and nearby [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]]; and [[Penge]]. In addition, parts of [[Mottingham]], [[Sydenham, London|Sydenham]], [[Swanley]] and [[Ruxley]] lie within the borough boundaries.\n\nThere are two main built-up areas in the southern part of the borough: [[Hayes, Bromley|Hayes]] and [[West Wickham]]. [[Biggin Hill]], [[Downe]] and [[Keston]] with [[Leaves Green]] and Nash are separate, smaller, rural settlements.\n\nLocal attractions include [[Down House]] (the home of [[Charles Darwin]]), [[Chislehurst Caves]], [[Holwood House]] (the home of [[William Pitt the Younger]]), [[Crofton Roman Villa]], and the site of [[The Crystal Palace]].\n\n==Governance==\n{{See also|List of electoral wards in Greater London#Bromley|label 1=List of electoral wards in Bromley}}\n[[File:Bromley Ward Map.PNG|left|thumb|The 22 wards of the London Borough of Bromley (orange) and the surrounding London boroughs (yellow) and districts outside Greater London (grey)]]\nBromley is divided into 22 [[Wards of the United Kingdom|wards]] with a total of 60 council seats.

After a number of [[by-election]]s and a [[defection]], the Conservatives regained control on 5 July 2001.\n\nThe 22 wards are shown on the accompanying map.

When the railways arrived, the rate of [[population growth]] increased. The population peaked in the 1970s, when industry began to relocate from London.\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 UK Census]], the borough had a population of 309,392.

It is owned and run by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] and is one of the Trust's most popular properties.\n\nThis [[English Regency|Regency]] house was expanded from an earlier building, and extensively remodelled in 1906 by [[Margaret Greville]], a well-known [[Edwardian]] hostess. Her collection of fine paintings, furniture, porcelain and silver is displayed in the reception rooms and galleries, as it was at the time of her celebrated house parties.\n\nThe {{convert|1400|acre||adj=on}} estate includes a walled rose garden, lawns, ancient woodland and landscape walks.\n\nThe future [[George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]] spent part of their honeymoon here in 1923.\n\n==Previous houses==\nThe name 'Polesden' is thought to be Old English. The first house was built here by 1336. Anthony Rous bought the estate in 1630 and rebuilt the medieval house.  [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], the poet and playwright, bought the house in 1804.<ref name=\"NTHistory\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-polesdenlacey/w-polesdenlacey-history.htm|title=History of Polesden Lacey|publisher=[[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]|accessdate=27 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe house at one time belonged to [[Sir Francis Geary, 1st Baronet|Sir Francis Geary]], but his Polesden Lacey was demolished when Joseph Bonsor bought the estate and commissioned [[Thomas Cubitt]] to build an entirely new house in 1824, creating the core of the house seen today. Bonsor died in 1835, and the house passed to his son who, in 1853, sold the estate to Sir Walter Rockcliff Farquhar, who held it until his death in 1902. \n\n==Early 20th Century==\nThe Polesden Lacey estate was purchased in 1902 by Sir [[Clinton Edward Dawkins]], a career civil servant, who commissioned Ambrose Poynter, architect son of [[Sir Edward Poynter]] P.R.A., to significantly extend Cubitt's work to create the present house. Sir Clinton, however died shortly after its completion. The estate was then bought in 1906 by [[William McEwan]] for his daughter, the former Margaret Anderson, and her husband Captain the Honourable [[Ronald Greville]].\n\n[[File:Mr and Mrs Ronald Greville crop 1906.jpg|right|thumb|Ronald and Margaret Greville, c.&nbsp;1900]]\nArchitects [[Charles Mew\u00e8s]] and [[Arthur Joseph Davis|Arthur Davis]], who were responsible for the [[The Ritz London Hotel|Ritz Hotel]] in London, remodelled the house for the Grevilles.  The couple filled the house with collections of fine furniture, porcelain, silver and art.\n\nRonald Greville died in 1908 only two years after they had moved to Polesden Lacey. He was aged 46.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename= Captain The Hon. Ronald Greville |date= 6 April 1908 |page_number= 6 |issue= 38613}}</ref> Margaret continued to entertain lavishly at the house. She also owned a home in London in which she held expensive parties. Over the next 30 years her reputation as an Edwardian society hostess became established.\n\n===Royal honeymoon at Polesden Lacey in 1923===\nIn 1923 Margaret invited the Duke and Duchess of York to spend their honeymoon at Polesden Lacey and the royal couple subsequently spent two weeks there. Shortly before their arrival a London newspaper took photographs of the house and published a large feature article about the proposed honeymoon venue.<ref>Illustrated London News(London, England),Saturday, 28 April 1923</ref>\n\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:Polesden Lacey 1923.jpg\nFile:Gateway to The Terrace, Polesden Lacey 1923.jpg\nFile:Pergola Polesden Lacey 1923.jpg\nFile:The Library Polesden Lacey 1923.jpg\nFile:Kings Bedroom Polesden Lacey 1923.jpg\nFile:Drawing Room Polesden Lacey 1923.jpg\nFile:Arbour Polesden Lacey 1923.jpg\n</gallery></center>\n\n==National Trust ownership (1942 - present)==\n[[File:Polesdon Lacey, West facade.jpg|right|thumb|West facade]]\nPolesden Lacey was left to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] by Mrs Greville in 1942 in memory of her father, the brewer [[William McEwan]]<ref name=Times1942>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename= Polesden Lacey for the Nation |date= 25 November 1942 |page_number= 7 |issue= 49402}}</ref> (she was his illegitimate daughter and sole heir<ref>{{ODNBweb |first=Ian |last=Donnachie |title=McEwan, William (1827\u20131913) |year=2004 |edition=online |id=50416 }}</ref>).

This is because in 1942 it was thought that the bedrooms and servants' areas would not be of interest to visitors.  The first floor of the mansion is used by the National Trust Regional Office for London and the South East. The old servants' areas (on the ground floor) are used by the Polesden Lacey staff as offices. In the future, it is hoped that more of the mansion will be open to the public. This began in March 2011 with the opening of Mrs Greville's private apartment which had been occupied by the House Manager. The house is open to the public all year round except for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. On weekday mornings admission is via a short themed tour. By March 2016 the Regional staff were beginning to move out, allowing more rooms to be available for public viewing. \n\nThere are a number of walks around the Polesden Lacey estate, especially in the valley that the main house overlooks.  The estate includes a [[Youth Hostels Association (England & Wales)|Youth Hostel]], Tanners Hatch.\n\nThe re-modelling of the facilities in 2008\u20132009 means that the cafe and shop (as well as the walks) can now be accessed without paying for admission.\n\nPolesden Lacey also has open-air performing facilities, which are used during the summer to host various musical and theatrical events.

It is owned and run by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] and is one of the Trust's most popular properties.\n\nThis [[English Regency|Regency]] house was expanded from an earlier building, and extensively remodelled in 1906 by [[Margaret Greville]], a well-known [[Edwardian]] hostess. Her collection of fine paintings, furniture, porcelain and silver is displayed in the reception rooms and galleries, as it was at the time of her celebrated house parties.\n\nIt also refers to its grounds of 1,400 acres (5.6 square kilometres) including a walled rose garden, lawns, ancient woodland and landscape walks.\n\nThe future [[George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]] spent part of their honeymoon here in 1923.\n\n==Previous houses==\nThe name 'Polesden' is thought to be Old English. The first house was built here by 1336. Anthony Rous bought the estate in 1630 and rebuilt the medieval house.  [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], the poet and playwright, bought the house in 1804.<ref name=\"NTHistory\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-polesdenlacey/w-polesdenlacey-history.htm|title=History of Polesden Lacey|publisher=[[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]|accessdate=27 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe house at one time belonged to [[Sir Francis Geary, 1st Baronet|Sir Francis Geary]], but his Polesden Lacey was demolished when Joseph Bonsor bought the estate and commissioned [[Thomas Cubitt]] to build an entirely new house in 1824, creating the core of the house seen today. Bonsor died in 1835, and the house passed to his son who, in 1853, sold the estate to Sir Walter Rockcliff Farquhar, who held it until his death in 1902. \n\n==Early 20th Century==\nThe Polesden Lacey estate was purchased in 1902 by Sir [[Clinton Edward Dawkins]], a career civil servant, who commissioned Ambrose Poynter, architect son of [[Sir Edward Poynter]] P.R.A., to significantly extend Cubitt's work to create the present house. Sir Clinton, however died shortly after its completion. The estate was then bought in 1906 by [[William McEwan]] for his daughter, the former Margaret Anderson, and her husband Captain the Honourable [[Ronald Greville]].\n\n[[File:Mr and Mrs Ronald Greville crop 1906.jpg|right|thumb|Ronald and Margaret Greville, c.&nbsp;1900]]\nArchitects [[Charles Mew\u00e8s]] and [[Arthur Joseph Davis|Arthur Davis]], who were responsible for the [[The Ritz London Hotel|Ritz Hotel]] in London, remodelled the house for the Grevilles.  The couple filled the house with collections of fine furniture, porcelain, silver and art.\n\nRonald Greville died in 1908 only two years after they had moved to Polesden Lacey. He was aged 46.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename= Captain The Hon. Ronald Greville |date= 6 April 1908 |page_number= 6 |issue= 38613}}</ref> Margaret continued to entertain lavishly at the house. She also owned a home in London in which she held expensive parties. Over the next 30 years her reputation as an Edwardian society hostess became established.\n\n===Royal honeymoon at Polesden Lacey in 1923===\nIn 1923 Margaret invited the Duke and Duchess of York to spend their honeymoon at Polesden Lacey and the royal couple subsequently spent two weeks there. Shortly before their arrival a London newspaper took photographs of the house and published a large feature article about the proposed honeymoon venue.<ref>Illustrated London News(London, England),Saturday, 28 April 1923</ref>\n\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:Polesden Lacey 1923.jpg\nFile:Gateway to The Terrace, Polesden Lacey 1923.jpg\nFile:Pergola Polesden Lacey 1923.jpg\nFile:The Library Polesden Lacey 1923.jpg\nFile:Kings Bedroom Polesden Lacey 1923.jpg\nFile:Drawing Room Polesden Lacey 1923.jpg\nFile:Arbour Polesden Lacey 1923.jpg\n</gallery></center>\n\n==National Trust ownership (1942 - present)==\n[[File:Polesdon Lacey, West facade.jpg|right|thumb|West facade]]\nPolesden Lacey was left to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] by Mrs Greville in 1942 in memory of her father, the brewer [[William McEwan]]<ref name=Times1942>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename= Polesden Lacey for the Nation |date= 25 November 1942 |page_number= 7 |issue= 49402}}</ref> (she was his illegitimate daughter and sole heir<ref>{{ODNBweb |first=Ian |last=Donnachie |title=McEwan, William (1827\u20131913) |year=2004 |edition=online |id=50416 }}</ref>). The bequest included approximately 1000 acres of land along with paintings and items of furniture, which she hoped would form the basis of a future art gallery.<ref name=Times1942/> The house was first opened to the public by the Trust in August 1946.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename= Polesden Lacey to be open to the public |date= 20 August 1946 |page_number= 8 |issue= 50534}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1960, a fire destroyed around half of the roof of the property.

It received 347,149 visitors in 2018, placing it in the Trust's top ten most-visited properties.<ref name=\"ALVA 2018 visitor numbers\">{{cite web |title=ALVA - Association of Leading Visitor Attractions |url=http://www.alva.org.uk/details.cfm?p=423 |website=www.alva.org.uk |accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nSome areas of the house are not currently open to the public. This is because in 1942 it was thought that the bedrooms and servants' areas would not be of interest to visitors.  The first floor of the mansion is used by the National Trust Regional Office for London and the South East. The old servants' areas (on the ground floor) are used by the Polesden Lacey staff as offices. In the future, it is hoped that more of the mansion will be open to the public. This began in March 2011 with the opening of Mrs Greville's private apartment which had been occupied by the House Manager. The house is open to the public all year round except for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. On weekday mornings admission is via a short themed tour. By March 2016 the Regional staff were beginning to move out, allowing more rooms to be available for public viewing. \n\nThere are a number of walks around the Polesden Lacey estate, especially in the valley that the main house overlooks.  The estate includes a [[Youth Hostels Association (England & Wales)|Youth Hostel]], Tanners Hatch.\n\nThe re-modelling of the facilities in 2008\u20132009 means that the cafe and shop (as well as the walks) can now be accessed without paying for admission.\n\nPolesden Lacey also has open-air performing facilities, which are used during the summer to host various musical and theatrical events. In 2009 there was the Polesden Lacey Festival.<ref>[http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-polesdenlacey/w-polesdenlacey-festival.htm National Trust \u2013 Polesden Lacey Festival 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514142520/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-polesdenlacey/w-polesdenlacey-festival.htm |date=14 May 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==Trivia==\n* The gardens of this house (and the surrounding countryside) were used as a location for the 1991 [[Stephen Poliakoff]] film ''[[Close My Eyes (film)|Close My Eyes]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Close My Eyes (1991) Filming & Production |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101595/locations?ref_=ttfc_sa_4 |website=IMDB |accessdate=15 August 2018}}</ref>\n* The front of this house was used as a location for the 1997 film ''[[Shooting Fish]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Shooting Fish (1997) Filming & Production |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120122/locations?ref_=ttfc_sa_4 |website=IMDB |accessdate=15 August 2018}}</ref>\n* Several areas of the house featured in the BBC drama ''Restless'' which was shown in December 2012.{{cn|date=August 2018}}\n* In May 2013, the BBC programme ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]'' returned to Surrey for the first time since 2009 to film at Polesden Lacey.

''''' is a 2019 American [[superhero film]] based on the [[DC Comics]] [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|character]]. Produced by [[New Line Cinema]] and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], it is the seventh installment in the [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU). Directed by [[David F. Sandberg]] from a screenplay by Henry Gayden, and a story by Gayden and [[Darren Lemke]], the film stars [[Asher Angel]] as Billy Batson, a teenage boy who can transform into an adult superhero, played by [[Zachary Levi]]. [[Mark Strong]], [[Jack Dylan Grazer]], [[Adam Brody]], and [[Djimon Hounsou]] also star. The plot follows Billy Batson, who is chosen by the ancient wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]] as his new champion and receives various superpowers. Billy and his best friend [[Captain Marvel, Jr.|Freddy Freeman]] (Grazer) must discover Billy's new powers in order to stop the evil [[Doctor Sivana|Dr. Thaddeus Sivana]] (Strong) and the [[Seven Deadly Enemies of Man]].\n\nDevelopment of a live-action ''Shazam!'' film began at New Line in the early 2000s but was delayed for many years. The film went into pre-production in 2009 with director [[Peter Segal]] and writer [[John August]] and [[Dwayne Johnson]] considered to star as the villain [[Black Adam]], but the project fell through; Dwayne Johnson acts as an executive producer on ''Shazam!''. [[William Goldman]], [[Alec Sokolow]], [[Joel Cohen (writer)|Joel Cohen]], Bill Birch, and [[Geoff Johns]], among others, were all attached to the project as writers at various points. The film was officially announced in 2014, with Johnson attached to star as either Shazam or Black Adam. He would later be cast in January 2017 to lead a solo ''Black Adam'' development project, currently targeted for a December 2021 release.<ref name=\"BlackAdamRelease\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/black-adam-release-date-set-2021-1254807 |title=Dwayne Johnson's 'Black Adam' Sets 2021 Release Date |website=The Hollywood Reporter |language=en |access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref> Sandberg signed on to direct ''Shazam!'' in February 2017 and Levi was cast that October, with Angel joining the following month. [[Principal photography]] began in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada on January 29, 2018, with most of the film shot at [[Pinewood Toronto Studios]], and [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on May 11, 2018.\n\n''Shazam!'' was released in the United States by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] in [[RealD 3D]], [[Dolby Cinema]], [[IMAX 3D]], [[4DX]] and [[ScreenX]] <!--no IMAX 2D prints--> on April 5, 2019. The film grossed $366 million worldwide, making it  a box office success. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for Sandberg's direction and the performances of Levi, Grazer, and Angel, as well as its light tone and sense of fun.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/shazam-reviews-what-critics-are-saying-1196688|title='Shazam!': What the Critics Are Saying|author=Katie Kilkenny|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=March 23, 2019|accessdate=March 23, 2019}}</ref> A sequel is set for release on April 1, 2022.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the word count in this section should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1974 [[Upstate New York]], young [[Doctor Sivana|Thaddeus Sivana]] is riding in a car with his father and brother when he is suddenly transported to the [[Rock of Eternity]], a magical temple in another dimension. There, the ancient wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]] has spent centuries searching for someone pure of heart on whom to bestow his power and name as champion, after the previous champion released the [[Seven Deadly Enemies of Man|Seven Deadly Sins]] which killed the rest of the Council of Wizards. Thaddeus is tempted by the Eye of Sin, through which he hears the voices of the Sins, trapped in stone statues, promising him power if he will free them. The wizard deems Thaddeus unworthy and magically returns him to the car, where he makes a scene causing a car crash, crippling his father. The Sins send Thaddeus a message telling him to find them.\n\nIn present-day [[Philadelphia]], 14-year-old foster child [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Billy Batson]] continually runs away from foster homes to search for his birth mother, from whom he became separated while at a carnival ten years prior. He is placed in a group home run by Victor and Rosa Vasquez, with five other foster children: [[Mary Marvel|Mary Bromfield]], Pedro Pe\u00f1a, Eugene Choi, Darla Dudley, and superhero enthusiast [[Captain Marvel Jr.|Freddy Freeman]]. Meanwhile, the embittered Sivana succeeds in his lifelong quest to find a way back to the Rock of Eternity. He steals the Eye of Sin, becoming the Sins' vessel, bests the wizard, and uses his newfound power to kill his father, brother, and Sivana Industries' board of directors.\n\nAt school, Billy defends Freddy from bullies and is chased into a subway, where he is transported to the Rock of Eternity. The wizard chooses Billy to be his new champion: By saying the name \"Shazam\", Billy is transformed into an adult superhero. The wizard turns to dust, leaving his magical staff behind. At home, Freddy is taken into Billy's confidence and helps him explore his newfound powers, which include super strength, speed, near-invulnerability, and electricity manipulation. By saying \"Shazam\" again, he can transform back into his normal body. Freddy posts [[viral video]]s of the new superhero, and Billy starts skipping school to use his powers to [[street performance|busk]] for money and fame, straining his friendship with Freddy. When Billy accidentally endangers and then saves a bus full of people, Sivana confronts him, demanding that he surrender his powers. Billy discovers that he can fly, and manages to escape. His foster siblings deduce that he is the superhero, and complete his search for his mother, who lives nearby. Billy rushes to see her, but is disheartened to learn that she abandoned him, having felt inadequate to raise him as a single teenage mother.\n\nSivana deduces Billy's identity and takes his foster siblings hostage. Billy agrees to transfer his powers to Sivana in exchange for their safety. They go to the Rock of Eternity to use the wizard's staff to effect the transfer, but the children follow and attack Sivana. Billy observes that Sivana becomes vulnerable when all seven Sins leave his body. Sivana pursues them to a winter carnival and unleashes the Sins upon the crowd. Remembering the wizard's words, Billy uses the staff to share his powers with his siblings, transforming them into [[Marvel Family|adult superheroes like him]]. He then breaks the staff, and his siblings battle the Sins while Billy faces down Sivana. By luring out the final Sin, Envy, Billy makes Sivana vulnerable and yanks the Eye of Sin out of his head, recapturing all the Sins.\n\nBilly and his siblings are hailed as heroes, return the Eye and the Sins to their prison, and realize they can use the Rock of Eternity as their superhero lair. Billy finally accepts his foster parents and siblings as his \"real\" family. In his superhero form, he has lunch with his siblings at school, revealing to Freddy's surprise that he has also invited [[Superman]]. In a [[post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], the imprisoned Sivana is approached by [[Mister Mind|a talking caterpillar]], who proposes [[Monster Society of Evil|an alliance]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|Marvel Family}}\n* [[Asher Angel]] as [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Billy Batson]], a troubled orphan searching for his biological mother, who is chosen by the ancient wizard Shazam as his champion.

Four major sequences take place here, including the opening scene when a young Thad enters and is rejected as the new hero; when he returns as the older Dr. Sivana; when Billy enters and becomes Shazam; and the final showdown between Shazam and Sivana. VFX Supervisor Aaron Weintraub and the team at Mr. X were brought on board three months before shooting began in Toronto \u2013 where the town was abuzz with this exciting project and the mayor talked it up frequently. Weintraub found working with Sandberg and the filmmaking team to be an open, inviting, and collaborative experience.\n\nWhile the first level of the Rock of Eternity was an elaborately built set, everything above 20 feet was a digital environment extension, and within that was every type of visual effect \u2013 from bringing Shazam's chest bolt to life; to stunts with digi-doubles, people melting and statues crumbling; to the Orb and the Seven Deadly Sins flying in and out of it. the final showdown between Shazam and Sivana, in which the latter lets loose his gang of monsters, a 360 shot where seven creatures form from smoke unleashed from within.\n\nRodeo FX team deliver more than 130 shots to DC's latest entry, Shazam!. RodeoFX team recreate the city backdrop for the boardroom sequence. Using photographs of Pittsburgh, They built matte paintings of the city as seen from the boardroom, adding buildings and bustlings streets.\n\nFor the title sequence, They delivered the compositing of the company logos in the opening credits and built and animated the magic 8 ball in CG, adding frost and rays of light beam along matching the effects from the key subway scene from the film.\n\nDigital Domain worked on 26 VFX shots for the movie.

''''' is a 2019 American [[superhero film]] based on the [[DC Comics]] [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|character]]. Produced by [[New Line Cinema]] and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], it is the seventh installment in the [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU). Directed by [[David F. Sandberg]] from a screenplay by Henry Gayden, and a story by Gayden and [[Darren Lemke]], the film stars [[Asher Angel]] as Billy Batson, a teenage boy who can transform into an adult superhero, played by [[Zachary Levi]]. [[Mark Strong]], [[Jack Dylan Grazer]], [[Adam Brody]], and [[Djimon Hounsou]] also star. The plot follows Billy Batson, who is chosen by the ancient wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]] as his new champion and receives various superpowers. Billy and his best friend [[Captain Marvel, Jr.|Freddy Freeman]] (Grazer) must discover Billy's new powers in order to stop the evil [[Doctor Sivana|Dr. Thaddeus Sivana]] (Strong) and the [[Seven Deadly Enemies of Man]].\n\nDevelopment of a live-action ''Shazam!'' film began at New Line in the early 2000s but was delayed for many years. The film went into pre-production in 2009 with director [[Peter Segal]] and writer [[John August]] and [[Dwayne Johnson]] considered to star as the villain [[Black Adam]], but the project fell through; Dwayne Johnson acts as an executive producer on ''Shazam!''. [[William Goldman]], [[Alec Sokolow]], [[Joel Cohen (writer)|Joel Cohen]], Bill Birch, and [[Geoff Johns]], among others, were all attached to the project as writers at various points. The film was officially announced in 2014, with Johnson attached to star as either Shazam or Black Adam. He would later be cast in January 2017 to lead a solo ''Black Adam'' development project, currently targeted for a December 2021 release.<ref name=\"BlackAdamRelease\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/black-adam-release-date-set-2021-1254807 |title=Dwayne Johnson's 'Black Adam' Sets 2021 Release Date |website=The Hollywood Reporter |language=en |access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref> Sandberg signed on to direct ''Shazam!'' in February 2017 and Levi was cast that October, with Angel joining the following month. [[Principal photography]] began in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada on January 29, 2018, with most of the film shot at [[Pinewood Toronto Studios]], and [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on May 11, 2018.\n\n''Shazam!'' was released in the United States by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] in [[RealD 3D]], [[Dolby Cinema]], [[IMAX 3D]], [[4DX]] and [[ScreenX]] <!--no IMAX 2D prints--> on April 5, 2019. The film grossed $366 million worldwide, making it  a box office success. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for Sandberg's direction and the performances of Levi, Grazer, and Angel, as well as its light tone and sense of fun.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/shazam-reviews-what-critics-are-saying-1196688|title='Shazam!': What the Critics Are Saying|author=Katie Kilkenny|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=March 23, 2019|accessdate=March 23, 2019}}</ref> A sequel is set for release on April 1, 2022.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the word count in this section should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1974 [[Upstate New York]], young [[Doctor Sivana|Thaddeus Sivana]] is riding in a car with his father and brother when he is suddenly transported to the [[Rock of Eternity]], a magical temple in another dimension. There, the ancient wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]] has spent centuries searching for someone pure of heart on whom to bestow his power and name as champion, after the previous champion released the [[Seven Deadly Enemies of Man|Seven Deadly Sins]] which killed the rest of the Council of Wizards. Thaddeus is tempted by the Eye of Sin, through which he hears the voices of the Sins, trapped in stone statues, promising him power if he will free them. The wizard deems Thaddeus unworthy and magically returns him to the car, where he makes a scene causing a car crash, crippling his father. The Sins send Thaddeus a message telling him to find them.\n\nIn present-day [[Philadelphia]], 14-year-old foster child [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Billy Batson]] continually runs away from foster homes to search for his birth mother, from whom he became separated while at a carnival ten years prior. He is placed in a group home run by Victor and Rosa Vasquez, with five other foster children: [[Mary Marvel|Mary Bromfield]], Pedro Pe\u00f1a, Eugene Choi, Darla Dudley, and superhero enthusiast [[Captain Marvel Jr.|Freddy Freeman]]. Meanwhile, the embittered Sivana succeeds in his lifelong quest to find a way back to the Rock of Eternity. He steals the Eye of Sin, becoming the Sins' vessel, bests the wizard, and uses his newfound power to kill his father, brother, and Sivana Industries' board of directors.\n\nAt school, Billy defends Freddy from bullies and is chased into a subway, where he is transported to the Rock of Eternity. The wizard chooses Billy to be his new champion: By saying the name \"Shazam\", Billy is transformed into an adult superhero. The wizard turns to dust, leaving his magical staff behind. At home, Freddy is taken into Billy's confidence and helps him explore his newfound powers, which include super strength, speed, near-invulnerability, and electricity manipulation. By saying \"Shazam\" again, he can transform back into his normal body. Freddy posts [[viral video]]s of the new superhero, and Billy starts skipping school to use his powers to [[street performance|busk]] for money and fame, straining his friendship with Freddy. When Billy accidentally endangers and then saves a bus full of people, Sivana confronts him, demanding that he surrender his powers. Billy discovers that he can fly, and manages to escape. His foster siblings deduce that he is the superhero, and complete his search for his mother, who lives nearby. Billy rushes to see her, but is disheartened to learn that she abandoned him, having felt inadequate to raise him as a single teenage mother.\n\nSivana deduces Billy's identity and takes his foster siblings hostage. Billy agrees to transfer his powers to Sivana in exchange for their safety. They go to the Rock of Eternity to use the wizard's staff to effect the transfer, but the children follow and attack Sivana. Billy observes that Sivana becomes vulnerable when all seven Sins leave his body. Sivana pursues them to a winter carnival and unleashes the Sins upon the crowd. Remembering the wizard's words, Billy uses the staff to share his powers with his siblings, transforming them into [[Marvel Family|adult superheroes like him]]. He then breaks the staff, and his siblings battle the Sins while Billy faces down Sivana. By luring out the final Sin, Envy, Billy makes Sivana vulnerable and yanks the Eye of Sin out of his head, recapturing all the Sins.\n\nBilly and his siblings are hailed as heroes, return the Eye and the Sins to their prison, and realize they can use the Rock of Eternity as their superhero lair. Billy finally accepts his foster parents and siblings as his \"real\" family. In his superhero form, he has lunch with his siblings at school, revealing to Freddy's surprise that he has also invited [[Superman]]. In a [[post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], the imprisoned Sivana is approached by [[Mister Mind|a talking caterpillar]], who proposes [[Monster Society of Evil|an alliance]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|Marvel Family}}\n* [[Asher Angel]] as [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Billy Batson]], a troubled orphan searching for his biological mother, who is chosen by the ancient wizard Shazam as his champion.

Four major sequences take place here, including the opening scene when a young Thad enters and is rejected as the new hero; when he returns as the older Dr. Sivana; when Billy enters and becomes Shazam; and the final showdown between Shazam and Sivana. VFX Supervisor Aaron Weintraub and the team at Mr. X were brought on board three months before shooting began in Toronto \u2013 where the town was abuzz with this exciting project and the mayor talked it up frequently. Weintraub found working with Sandberg and the filmmaking team to be an open, inviting, and collaborative experience.\n\nWhile the first level of the Rock of Eternity was an elaborately built set, everything above 20 feet was a digital environment extension, and within that was every type of visual effect \u2013 from bringing Shazam's chest bolt to life; to stunts with digi-doubles, people melting and statues crumbling; to the Orb and the Seven Deadly Sins flying in and out of it. the final showdown between Shazam and Sivana, in which the latter lets loose his gang of monsters, a 360 shot where seven creatures form from smoke unleashed from within.\n\nRodeo FX team deliver more than 130 shots to DC's latest entry, Shazam!. RodeoFX team recreate the city backdrop for the boardroom sequence. Using photographs of Pittsburgh, They built matte paintings of the city as seen from the boardroom, adding buildings and bustlings streets.\n\nFor the title sequence, They delivered the compositing of the company logos in the opening credits and built and animated the magic 8 ball in CG, adding frost and rays of light beam along matching the effects from the key subway scene from the film.\n\nDigital Domain worked on 26 VFX shots for the movie. Additionally Rise FX and DNEG provide visual effects for the film and the 3D conversion.\n\n==Music==\n{{main|Shazam!
