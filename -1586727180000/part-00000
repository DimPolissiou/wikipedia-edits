Disparate companies of [[English people|English]] [[Militia|militiamen]] from nearby settlements marched to the town's defense, two of which were drawn into Native ambushes and suffered heavy losses. The battle was the last major Native American victory in King Philip's War before their final defeat in southern [[New England]] in August 1676.   \n== Background ==\nThe winter of 1676 brought a lull in the fighting of King Philip's War in eastern [[Massachusetts]], but come spring Native American forces resumed their raids on the area's [[Puritans|Puritan]] towns. The Native coalition attacked the strategically significant fort at [[Marlborough, Massachusetts]] on both March 16 and April 7, destroying most of the settlement and forcing a partial evacuation of its residents. In response to these attacks, as well as the recent abandonment of [[Lancaster, Massachusetts|Lancaster]] and [[Groton, Massachusetts|Groton]], the colonial Council of War dispatched Captain Samuel Wadsworth and fifty men to Marlborough to reinforce the frontier. Wadsworth's company passed through Sudbury on the evening of April 20.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Schultz, Tougias|first=|title=King Philip's War: The History and Legacy of America's Forgotten Conflict|publisher=The Countryman Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=207-213}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, a large group of Native warriors departed the Nipmuc stronghold of [[Mount Wachusett]] and gathered on Pompositticut Hill (also known as Summer Hill in what is now [[Maynard, Massachusetts]]).

Geographically, it is situated on an open sea gulf of the [[Ionian Sea]] in the central [[Mediterranean]], about {{Convert|14|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of the northern end of the island of [[Corfu]]. Stretching along the [[Albanian Ionian Sea Coast]], Saranda typically has over 300 sunny days a year.\n\nThe city is known for its blue deep waters of the [[Mediterranean]]. Near Sarand\u00eb are the remains of the ancient city of [[Butrint]], a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites|World Heritage site]]. In recent years, Saranda has seen a steady increase in tourists, many of them coming by cruise ship. Visitors are attracted by the natural environment of Saranda and its archaeological sites. \n\n== Etymology ==\n\n''Saranda'' is from the name of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] monastery of the ''Agioi Saranda'' ({{lang-el|\u0386\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9 \u03a3\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1}}), meaning the \"Forty Saints\", in honor of the [[Forty Martyrs of Sebaste]]. Under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], the town in the Turkish language became known as ''Aya Sarandi'' and then ''Sarandoz''. Owing to Venetian influence in the region, it often appeared under its Italian name ''Santi Quaranta'' on Western maps.<ref>E.g., Walker, J. & C. \"[http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~20905~530006:Turkey-II--Containing-the-northern-?sort=Pub_List_No_InitialSort%2CPub_Date%2CPub_List_No%2CSeries_No Turkey II: Containing the Northern Part of Greece].\" Published 1 November 1829 by Baldwin & Cradock, 47 Paternoster Row, London.

The involvement of the British troops was considered problematic by LAN\u00c7 as they considered that they would use the town as their base and install allies of the Greek resistance in the area as British documents indicate that [[EDES]] forces also joined the operation.

It is bordered with [[Vlora]] to the north, [[Delvina]] and [[Gjirokast\u00ebr]] to the east and with [[Greece]] to the south of [[Ionian Sea]].\nSaranda is a place in the most southern part of Albania. It lies between the hills that descend and reach the Ionian Sea.\nThe district of Saranda has a plain relief which is composed of southern seashore mountains that lie from Borsh to the bay of Ftelia, Vrina Fields and the hills of Saranda, L\u00ebkur\u00ebsi, [[Ksamil]], [[Butrint]] and Konispol. All these units make up the southern part of the [[Albanian Riviera]] where the eye catches the countless bays, beaches, the rocky coastline, hills with olives and citrus, mountains that surround the landscape. Saranda is traversed by Kalasa, Bistrica and Pavlla rivers which flow in the Ionian Sea. \nIn Saranda's hydrograph belongs even Butrinti Lake which is one of the biggest sea lakes in Albania. The Butrint Lake is very rich in sea species and in their waters now are being growing mussels. Its relief, geographical location and subtropical climate create favorable conditions for planting citrus trees and olives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grandhotelsaranda.com/rreth_sarandes-en.html|title=Grand Hotel Saranda|author=|date=|work=grandhotelsaranda.com}}</ref>\n\nThe present municipality was formed at the 2015 local government reform by the merger of the former municipalities [[Ksamil]] and Sarand\u00eb, that became municipal units.

During the summer, temperatures may rise as high as 30 degrees Celsius. However, a refreshing sea breeze constantly blows. Winters are mild and subzero temperatures are uncommon. The wettest months of the year are November and December.

According to Daverio, there is no evidence of the middle name \"Alexander\" that appears in some sources.</ref> ({{IPA-de|\u02c8\u0283u\u02d0man|lang}}; 8 June 1810{{spaced ndash}}29 July 1856) was a German composer, pianist, and influential music critic. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers of the [[Romantic music|Romantic]] era. Schumann left the study of law, intending to pursue a career as a [[virtuoso]] pianist. His teacher, [[Friedrich Wieck]], a German pianist, had assured him that he could become the finest pianist in Europe, but a hand injury ended this dream. Schumann then focused his musical energies on composing.\n\nIn 1840, after a long and acrimonious legal battle with Wieck, who opposed the marriage, Schumann married Wieck's daughter [[Clara Schumann|Clara]]. A lifelong partnership in music began, as Clara herself was an established pianist and music prodigy. Clara and Robert also maintained a close relationship with German composer [[Johannes Brahms]].\n\nUntil 1840, Schumann wrote exclusively for the piano. Later, he composed piano and orchestral works, and many [[Lied]]er (songs for voice and piano). He composed four [[Symphony|symphonies]], one [[opera]], and other orchestral, [[choral]], and [[chamber music|chamber]] works. His best-known works include ''[[Carnaval (Schumann)|Carnaval]]'', ''[[Symphonic Studies (Schumann)|Symphonic Studies]]'', ''[[Kinderszenen]]'', ''[[Kreisleriana]]'', and the ''[[Fantasie in C (Schumann)|Fantasie in C]]''. Schumann was known for infusing his music with characters through motifs, as well as references to works of literature. These characters bled into his editorial writing in the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik]]'' (New Journal for Music), a [[Leipzig]]-based publication that he co-founded.\n\nSchumann suffered from a [[mental disorder]] that first manifested in 1833 as a severe [[melancholic depression|melancholic depressive]] episode\u2014which recurred several times alternating with phases of \"exaltation\" and increasingly also delusional ideas of being poisoned or threatened with metallic items. What is now thought to have been a combination of [[bipolar disorder]] and perhaps [[mercury poisoning]] led to \"manic\" and \"depressive\" periods in Schumann's compositional productivity. After a suicide attempt in 1854, Schumann was admitted at his own request to a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental asylum]] in [[Endenich]] near [[Bonn]]. Diagnosed with ''psychotic [[melancholia]]'', he died of pneumonia two years later at the age of 46, without recovering from his mental illness.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n[[File:Schumannhaus ALT.JPG|thumb|left|Schumann's birth house, now the [[Robert Schumann House]], after an anonymous colourized lithograph]]\n[[File:Rob.Schumann.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Bust (sculpture)|Bust]] of Robert Schumann in the museum of [[Zwickau]]]]\n\nSchumann was born in [[Zwickau]], in the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] (today [[Central Germany (cultural area)|Central Germany]]), the fifth and last child of Johanna Christiane (n\u00e9e Schnabel) and August Schumann.<ref>Ostwald, p. 11</ref> Schumann began to compose before the age of seven, but his boyhood was spent in the cultivation of literature as much as music\u2014undoubtedly influenced by his father, a bookseller, publisher, and novelist.<ref>{{cite book\n | author=Robert Schumann\n | editor = Konrad Wolff\n | others = Translated by Paul Rosenfeld\n | title = On Music and Musicians\n | year = 1982\n | publisher=University of California Press\n | isbn = 978-0-520-04685-6 }}</ref>\n\nAt age seven, Schumann began studying general music and piano with Johann Gottfried Kuntzsch, a teacher at the Zwickau high school. The boy immediately developed a love of music, and worked on his own compositions, without the aid of Kuntzsch. Even though he often disregarded the principles of musical composition, he created works regarded as admirable for his age. The ''Universal Journal of Music'' 1850 supplement included a biographical sketch of Schumann that noted, \"It has been related that Schumann, as a child, possessed rare taste and talent for portraying feelings and characteristic traits in melody,\u2014ay, he could sketch the different dispositions of his intimate friends by certain figures and passages on the piano so exactly and comically that everyone burst into loud laughter at the similitude of the portrait.\"<ref>[[Eric Himy]], pianist, Recording ''Homage to Schumann'', CD Notes, (Centaur, 2006), CEN 2858, chosen by BBC December 2007 as CD of the month, includes \"Kinderscenen\", \"Tr\u00e4umerei\"</ref>\n\nAt age 14, Schumann wrote an essay on the aesthetics of music and also contributed to a volume, edited by his father, titled ''Portraits of Famous Men''. While still at school in Zwickau, he read the works of the German poet-philosophers [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], as well as [[Lord Byron|Byron]] and the [[Tragedy#Ancient Greek tragedy|Greek tragedians]]. His most powerful and permanent literary inspiration was [[Jean Paul]], a German writer whose influence is seen in Schumann's youthful novels ''Juniusabende'', completed in 1826, and ''Selene''.\n\nSchumann's interest in music was sparked by attending a performance of [[Ignaz Moscheles]] playing at [[Karlovy Vary|Karlsbad]], and he later developed an interest in the works of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], and [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]. His father, who had encouraged his musical aspirations, died in 1826 when Schumann was 16. Thereafter, neither his mother nor his guardian encouraged him to pursue a music career. In 1828, Schumann left high school, and after a trip during which he met the poet [[Heinrich Heine]] in Munich, he left to study law at the University of Leipzig under family pressure. But in Leipzig Schumann instead focused on improvisation, song composition, and writing novels. He also began to seriously study piano with Friedrick Wieck, a well-known piano teacher. In 1829, he continued his law studies in [[Heidelberg]], where he became a lifelong member of [[Corps Saxo-Borussia Heidelberg]].\n\n{{See also|German Student Corps|Corps}}\n\n===1830\u201334===\n[[File:Robert-Schumann-Haus.JPG|thumb|upright|Schumann's music room in Zwickau]]\n\nDuring [[Eastertide]] 1830, he heard the Italian violinist, violist, guitarist, and composer [[Niccol\u00f2 Paganini]] play in [[Frankfurt]]. In July he wrote to his mother, \"My whole life has been a struggle between Poetry and Prose, or call it Music and Law.\" With her permission, by Christmas he was back in Leipzig, at age 20 taking piano lessons from his old master [[Friedrich Wieck]], who assured him that he would be a successful concert pianist after a few years' study with him.<ref>{{harvnb|Perrey|2007|p=11}}</ref> During his studies with Wieck, some stories claim that Schumann permanently injured a finger on his right hand.

To this end he began a study of music theory under [[Heinrich Dorn]], a German composer six years his senior and, at that time, conductor of the [[Leipzig Opera]].\n\n====''Papillons''====\nSchumann's fusion of literary ideas with musical ones\u2014known as [[program music]]\u2014may have first taken shape in ''[[Papillons]]'', Op. 2 (''Butterflies''), a musical portrayal of events in [[Jean Paul]]'s novel ''Die Flegeljahre''. In a letter from Leipzig dated April 1832, Schumann bids his brothers, \"Read the last scene in Jean Paul's ''Flegeljahre'' as soon as possible, because the ''Papillons'' are intended as a musical representation of that masquerade.\" This inspiration is foreshadowed to some extent in his first written criticism\u2014an 1831 essay on [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]]'s [[Variations on \"L\u00e0 ci darem la mano\" (Chopin)|variations on a theme]] from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', published in the ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]''. In it, Schumann\ncreates imaginary characters who discuss Chopin's work: Florestan (the embodiment of Schumann's passionate, voluble side) and Eusebius (his dreamy, introspective side)\u2014the counterparts of Vult and Walt in ''Flegeljahre.'' They call on a third, Meister Raro, for his opinion. Raro may represent either the composer himself, Wieck's daughter [[Clara Schumann|Clara]], or the combination of the two (Cla'''ra''' + '''Ro'''bert).\n\nIn the winter of 1832, at age 22, Schumann visited relatives in Zwickau and [[Schneeberg, Saxony|Schneeberg]], where he performed the first movement of his ''Symphony in G minor'' (without opus number, known as the \"Zwickauer\"). In Zwickau, the music was performed at a concert given by Clara Wieck, who was then just 13 years old. On this occasion Clara played bravura Variations by [[Henri Herz]], a composer whom Schumann was already deriding as a philistine.<ref>Robert Schumann, musical Journal</ref> Schumann's mother said to Clara, \"You must marry my Robert one day.\"<ref>Berthold Litzmann 1910</ref> The ''Symphony in G minor'' was not published during Schumann's lifetime but has been played and recorded in recent times.\n\nThe 1833 deaths of Schumann's brother Julius and his sister-in-law Rosalie in the [[Second cholera pandemic (1829-1851)|worldwide cholera pandemic]] brought on a [[Major depressive disorder|severe depressive]] episode.\n\n[[File:Robert Schumann in youth.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A youthful Robert Schumann]]\n\n====''Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik''====\nBy spring 1834, Schumann had sufficiently recovered to inaugurate ''[[Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik|Die Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik]]'' (\"New Journal for Music\"), first published on 3 April 1834. In his writings, Schumann created a fictional music society based on people in his life, called the ''[[Davidsb\u00fcndler]]'', named after the biblical King David who fought against the Philistines. Schumann published most of his critical writings in the journal, and often lambasted the popular taste for flashy technical displays from figures whom Schumann perceived as inferior composers, or \"philistines\". Schumann campaigned to revive interest in major composers of the past, including [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], and [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]]. He also promoted the work of some contemporary composers, including [[Chopin]] (about whom Schumann famously wrote, \"Hats off, Gentlemen! A genius!\")<ref>[[Vladimir Ashkenazy]]'s notes, Favourite Chopin</ref> and [[Hector Berlioz]], whom he praised for creating music of substance. On the other hand, Schumann disparaged the school of [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Richard Wagner]]. Among Schumann's associates at this time were composers [[Norbert Burgm\u00fcller]] and [[Ludwig Schuncke]] (to whom Schumann dedicated his ''Toccata in C'').\n\nDuring the summer of 1834 Schumann became engaged to 16-year-old Ernestine von Fricken, the adopted daughter of a rich Bohemian-born noble. In August 1835, he learned that Ernestine von Fricken was born illegitimate, which meant that she would have no dowry. Fearful that her limited means would force him to earn his living like a \"day-labourer,\" Schumann made a complete break with her toward the end of the year. He felt a growing attraction to 15-year-old Clara Wieck. They made mutual declarations of love in December in Zwickau, where Clara appeared in concert. His budding romance with Clara was disrupted when her father learned of their trysts during the Christmas holidays. He summarily forbade them further meetings, and ordered all their correspondence burnt.\n\n====''Carnaval''====\n''[[Carnaval (Schumann)|Carnaval]]'', Op. 9 (1834) is one of Schumann's most characteristic piano works. Schumann begins nearly every section of ''Carnaval'' with a [[musical cryptogram]], the musical notes signified in German by the letters that spell [[A\u0161|Asch]] (A, E-flat, C, and B, or alternatively A-flat, C, and B; in German these are A, Es, C and H, and As, C and H respectively), the [[Bohemia]]n town in which Ernestine was born, and the notes are also the musical letters in Schumann's own name. Eusebius and Florestan, the imaginary figures appearing so often in his critical writings, also appear, alongside brilliant imitations of Chopin and Paganini. To each of these characters he devotes a section of ''Carnaval''. The work comes to a close with a march of the ''Davidsb\u00fcndler''\u2014the league of [[King David]]'s men against the [[Philistines]]\u2014in which may be heard the clear accents of truth in contest with the dull clamour of falsehood embodied in a [[Musical quotation|quotation]] from the seventeenth century ''[[Grossvater Tanz|Grandfather's Dance]]''. The march, a step nearly always in duple meter, is here in 3/4 time (triple meter). The work ends in joy and a degree of mock-triumph. In ''Carnaval'', Schumann went further than in ''Papillons'', by conceiving the story as well as the musical representation (and also displaying a maturation of compositional resource).\n\n===1835\u201339===\nOn 3 October 1835, Schumann met [[Felix Mendelssohn]] at Wieck's house in Leipzig, and his enthusiastic appreciation of that artist<ref>{{harvnb|Daverio|1997|p=134}}</ref> was shown with the same generous freedom that distinguished his acknowledgement of the greatness of Chopin and other colleagues, and later prompted him to publicly pronounce the then-unknown [[Johannes Brahms]] a genius.\n[[File:Andreas Staub - Clara Wieck (Lithographie 1839, cropped).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|[[Clara Wieck]] in an idealized lithograph by [[Andreas Staub]], c. 1839]]\n[[File:Friedrich Wieck um 1838.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Friedrich Wieck]] in a sketch by [[Pauline Viardot-Garcia]], around 1838]]\n\nIn 1837 Schumann published his ''[[Symphonic Studies (Schumann)|Symphonic Studies]]'', a complex set of ''\u00e9tude''-like variations written in 1834\u20131835, which demanded a finished piano technique. These variations were based on a theme by the adoptive father of Ernestine von Fricken. The work\u2014described as \"one of the peaks of the piano literature, lofty in conception and faultless in workmanship\" [Hutcheson]\u2014was dedicated to the young English composer [[William Sterndale Bennett]], for whom Schumann had had a high regard when they worked together in Leipzig.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe ''[[Davidsb\u00fcndlert\u00e4nze]]'', Op.&nbsp;6, (also published in 1837 despite the low opus number) literally \"Dances of the League of David\", is an embodiment of the struggle between enlightened Romanticism and musical philistinism. Schumann credited the two sides of his character with the composition of the work (the more passionate numbers are signed F. (Florestan) and the more dreamy signed E. (Eusebius)). The work begins with the \"motto of C.&nbsp;W.\" (Clara Wieck) denoting her support for the ideals of the ''Davidsbund''. The ''Bund'' was a music society of Schumann's imagination, members of which were kindred spirits (as he saw them) such as Chopin, Paganini and Clara, as well as the personalized Florestan and Eusebius.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''[[Kinderszenen]]'', Op. 15, completed in 1838 and a favourite of Schumann's piano works, depicts the innocence and playfulness of childhood. The \"Tr\u00e4umerei\" in F major, No. 7 of the set, is one of the most famous piano pieces ever written, and has been performed in myriad forms and transcriptions. It has been the favourite [[Encore (concert)|encore]] of several great pianists, including [[Vladimir Horowitz]]. Melodic and deceptively simple, the piece is \"complex\" in its harmonic structure.<ref>[[Alban Berg]], replying to charges that modern music was overly complex, pointed out that ''Kinderszenen'' is constructed on a complex base.</ref>\n\n{{listen\n| header   = [[Kreisleriana]], Op. 16 (1838)\n| filename    = Robert Schumann Kreisleriana Op. 16 N3 Giorgi Latsabidze.ogg\n| title       = N8.

[[Johannes Kreisler]] was a fictional musician created by poet [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]], and characterized as a \"romantic brought into contact with reality.\" Schumann used the figure to express \"fantastic and mad\" emotional states. According to [[Ernest Hutcheson#Works|Hutcheson (\"The Literature of the Piano\")]], this work is \"among the finest efforts of Schumann's genius. He never surpassed the searching beauty of the slow movements (Nos. 2, 4, 6) or the urgent passion of others (Nos. 1, 3, 5, 7) [\u2026] To appreciate it a high level of aesthetic intelligence is required [\u2026] This is no facile music, there is severity alike in its beauty and its passion.\"\n\nThe ''[[Fantasie in C (Schumann)|Fantasie in C]]'', Op. 17, composed in the summer of 1836, is a work of passion and deep pathos, imbued with the spirit of the late Beethoven. Schumann intended to use proceeds from sales of the work toward the construction of [[Beethoven Monument (Bonn)|a monument to Beethoven]], who had died in 1827. The first movement of the ''Fantasie'' contains a [[Musical quotation|musical quote]] from Beethoven's song cycle, ''[[An die ferne Geliebte]]'', Op. 98 (at the Adagio coda, taken from the last song of the cycle). The original titles of the movements were ''Ruins'', ''Triumphal Arch'', and ''The Starry Crown''. According to [[Franz Liszt]],<ref>Strelezki: ''Personal Recollections of Chats with Liszt''</ref> who played the work for Schumann and to whom it was dedicated, the ''Fantasie'' was apt to be played too heavily, and should have a dreamier (''tr\u00e4umerisch'') character than vigorous German pianists tended to impart. Liszt also said: \"It is a noble work, worthy of Beethoven, whose career, by the way, it is supposed to represent\".<ref>Anton Strelezki: ''Personal Recollections of Chats with Liszt''. London, 1893.</ref> Again, according to Hutcheson: \"No words can describe the Phantasie, no quotations set forth the majesty of its genius. It must suffice to say that it is Schumann's greatest work in large form for piano solo.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n{{listen\n| header   = [[Arabeske (Schumann)|Arabeske in C major, Op. 18 (1839)]]\n| filename    = Schumann-arabeske-andrea-valori.ogg\n| title       = Arabeske (Schumann)\n| description = [[Mario Andrea Valori]], piano, 2011\n| format      = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\nAfter a visit to [[Vienna]], during which he discovered [[Franz Schubert]]'s previously unknown [[Symphony No. 9 (Schubert)|Symphony No. 9 in C]], in 1839 Schumann wrote the ''[[Faschingsschwank aus Wien]]'' (''Carnival Prank from Vienna''). Most of the joke is in the central section of the first movement, which makes a thinly veiled reference to ''[[La Marseillaise]]''. (Vienna had banned the song due to harsh memories of [[Napoleon]]'s invasion.) The festive mood does not preclude moments of melancholic introspection in the Intermezzo.\n\n===1840\u201349===\nFrom 1832 to 1839, Schumann wrote almost exclusively for piano, but in 1840 alone he wrote at least 138 songs. Indeed, 1840 (the ''Liederjahr'' or ''year of song'') is highly significant in Schumann's musical legacy, despite his earlier deriding of works for piano and voice as inferior.\n\nAfter a long and acrimonious legal battle with her father, Schumann married Clara Wieck on 12 September 1840, at [[Leipzig-Sch\u00f6nefeld|Sch\u00f6nefeld]], the day before her 21st birthday. Had they waited another day, they would no longer have required her father's consent. Their marriage supported a remarkable business partnership, with Clara  acting as an inspiration, critic, and confidante to her husband. Despite her delicate appearance, she was an extremely strong-willed and energetic woman, who kept up a demanding schedule of concert tours in between bearing several children. Two years after their marriage, Friedrich Wieck at last reconciled himself with the couple, eager to see his grandchildren.\n\nPrior to the legal case and subsequent marriage, the lovers exchanged love letters and rendezvoused in secret. Robert often waited for hours in a cafe in a nearby city just to see Clara for a few minutes after one of her concerts. The strain of this long courtship and its consummation may have led to this great outpouring of Lieder (vocal songs with piano accompaniment). This is evident in ''Widmung'', for example, where he uses the melody from [[Franz Schubert|Schubert's]] [[Ave Maria (Schubert)|''Ave Maria'']] in the postlude in homage to Clara. Schumann's biographers attribute the sweetness, doubt, and despair of these songs to the emotions aroused by his love for Clara and the uncertainties of their future together.\n\nRobert and Clara had eight children, Emil (1846\u20131847), who died at 1 year; Marie (1841\u20131929); Elise (1843\u20131928); Julie (1845\u20131872); Ludwig (1848\u20131899); Ferdinand (1849\u20131891); [[Eugenie Schumann|Eugenie]] (1851\u20131938); and Felix (1854\u20131879).\n\n[[File:Robert and Clara Schumann.jpg|thumb|The stylized profiles of Clara and Robert Schumann]]\n\nHis chief song-cycles in this period were settings of the ''[[Liederkreis, Op. 39|Liederkreis]]'' of [[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff|Joseph von Eichendorff]], Op. 39 (depicting a series of moods relating to or inspired by nature); the ''[[Frauenliebe und -leben]]'' of [[Adelbert von Chamisso|Chamisso]], Op. 42 (relating the tale of a woman's marriage, childbirth and widowhood); the ''[[Dichterliebe]]'' of [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]], Op. 48 (depicting a lover rejected, but coming to terms with his painful loss through renunciation and forgiveness); and ''Myrthen'', a collection of songs, including poems by Goethe, [[Friedrich R\u00fcckert|R\u00fcckert]], Heine, Byron, [[Robert Burns|Burns]] and Moore. The songs ''Belsatzar'', Op. 57 and ''Die beiden Grenadiere'', Op. 49, both to Heine's words, show Schumann at his best as a ballad writer, although the dramatic ballad is less congenial to him than the introspective lyric. The Op. 35, 40 and 98a sets (words by [[Justinus Kerner]], Chamisso and Goethe respectively), although less well known, also contain songs of lyric and dramatic quality.\n\n{{listen\n | header       = Andante and Variations, Op. 46 (1843)<br />Performed by Neal and Nancy O'Doan (pianos), Carter Enyeart and Toby Saks (cellos) and Christopher Leuba (horn)\n | filename     = Robert Schumann - Andante and Variations - Introduction, Theme and Variations 01-05.ogg\n | title        = Introduction, Theme and Variations 1\u20135\n | format       = [[ogg]]\n | description  =\n | filename2    = Robert Schumann - Andante and Variations - Variations 06-10.ogg\n | title2       = Variations 6\u201310\n | format2      = [[ogg]]\n | description2 =\n | filename3    = Robert Schumann - Andante and Variations - Variations 11-15.ogg\n | title3       = Variations 11\u201315\n | format3      = [[ogg]]\n | description3 =\n | image        = none\n}}\n\nIn 1841 he wrote two of his four symphonies, [[Symphony No. 1 (Schumann)|No. 1 in B-flat]], Op. 38, ''Spring'' and [[Symphony No. 4 (Schumann)|No. 4 in D minor]] (the latter a pioneering work in \"cyclic form\", was performed that year but published only much later after revision and extensive re-orchestration as Op. 120). He devoted 1842 to composing chamber music, including the [[Piano Quintet (Schumann)|Piano Quintet in E-flat]], Op. 44, now one of his best known and most admired works; the [[Piano Quartet (Schumann)|Piano Quartet]] and [[String Quartets (Schumann)|three string quartets]]. In 1843 he wrote ''[[Paradise and the Peri]]'', his first attempt at concerted vocal music, an [[oratorio]] style work based on ''[[Lalla-Rookh]]'' by [[Thomas Moore]]. After this, his compositions were not confined to any one form during any particular period.\n\nThe stage in his life when he was deeply engaged in setting Goethe's ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' to music (1844\u201353) was a turbulent one for his health. He spent the first half of 1844 with Clara on tour in Russia, and his depression grew worse as he felt inferior to Clara as a musician. On returning to Germany, he abandoned his editorial work and left Leipzig for [[Dresden]], where he suffered from persistent \"[[nervous prostration]]\". As soon as he began to work, he was seized with fits of shivering and an apprehension of death, experiencing an abhorrence of high places, all metal instruments (even keys), and drugs. Schumann's diaries also state that he suffered perpetually from imagining that he had the [[A (musical note)#Designation by octave|note A5]] sounding in his ears.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHis state of unease and [[neurasthenia]] is reflected in his [[Symphony No. 2 (Schumann)|Symphony in C]], numbered second but third in order of composition, in which the composer explores states of exhaustion, obsession, and depression, culminating in Beethovenian spiritual triumph. Also published in 1845 was his [[Piano Concerto (Schumann)|Piano Concerto in A minor, Op. 54]], originally conceived and performed as a one-movement ''Fantasy for Piano and Orchestra'' in 1841. It is one of the most popular and oft-recorded of all piano concertos; according to Hutcheson \"Schumann achieved a masterly work and we inherited the finest piano concerto since Mozart and Beethoven\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[File:Robert u Clara Schumann 1847.jpg|thumb|left|Robert and Clara Schumann in 1847, lithograph with a personal dedication]]\n\nIn 1846, he felt he had recovered. In the winter, the Schumanns revisited Vienna, traveling to [[Prague]] and Berlin in the spring of 1847 and in the summer to Zwickau, where he was received with enthusiasm. This pleased him, since until that time he was famous in only Dresden and Leipzig.\n\nHis only opera, ''[[Genoveva]]'', Op. 81, premiered in Spring 1850.{{harvnb|Daverio|1997|p=334}} In it, Schumann attempted to abolish [[recitative]], which he regarded as an interruption to the musical flow (an influence on [[Richard Wagner]]; Schumann's consistently flowing melody can be seen as a forerunner to Wagner's ''Melos''). The subject of ''Genoveva''\u2014based on [[Ludwig Tieck]] and [[Christian Friedrich Hebbel]]'s plays\u2014was not seen an ideal choice. The text is often considered to lack dramatic qualities; the work has not remained in the repertoire. As early as 1842 the possibilities of German opera had been keenly realized by Schumann, who wrote, \"Do you know my prayer as an artist, night and morning? It is called 'German Opera.' Here is a real field for enterprise ... something simple, profound, German\". And in his notebook of suggestions for the text of operas are found amongst others: ''[[Nibelung]]en'', ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' and ''[[Till Eulenspiegel]]''.\n\nThe music to [[Lord Byron|Byron]]'s ''[[Manfred]]'' was written in 1849, the overture of which is one of Schumann's most frequently performed orchestral works. The [[May Uprising in Dresden|insurrection of Dresden]] caused Schumann to move to [[Kreischa]], a little village a few miles outside the city. In August 1849, on the occasion of the centenary of Goethe's birth, completed scenes of Schumann's ''[[Scenes from Goethe's Faust]]'' were performed in Dresden, Leipzig and [[Weimar]]. Liszt gave him assistance and encouragement. The rest of the work was written later in 1849, and the overture (which Schumann described as \"one of the sturdiest of [his] creations\") in 1853.\n\n===After 1850===\n[[File:Schumann-photo1850.jpg|thumb|right|Robert Schumann in an 1850 [[daguerreotype]]]]\n\nFrom 1850 to 1854, Schumann composed in a wide variety of genres. Critics have disputed the quality of his work at this time; a widely held view has been that his music showed signs of mental breakdown and creative decay. More recently, critics have suggested that the changes in style may be explained by \"lucid experimentation\".<ref name=\":1\">Daverio, Grove online, 19</ref>\n\nIn 1850, Schumann succeeded [[Ferdinand Hiller]] as musical director at [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], but he was a poor conductor and quickly aroused the opposition of the musicians. According to [[Harold C. Schonberg]], in his 1967 ''The Great Conductors'': \"The great composer was impossible on the platform ... There is something heartrending about poor Schumann's epochal inefficiency as a conductor.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/greatconductors0000unse |url-access=registration |author=[[Harold C. Schonberg]] |title=The Great Conductors |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1967 |page=[https://archive.org/details/greatconductors0000unse/page/126 126]}}</ref> His contract was eventually terminated. By the end of that year he completed his [[Symphony No. 3 (Schumann)|Symphony No. 3, \"Rhenish\"]] (a work containing five movements and whose 4th movement is apparently intended to represent an episcopal coronation ceremony). In 1851 he revised what would be published as his [[Symphony No. 4 (Schumann)|fourth symphony]]. From 1851 to 1853 he visited Switzerland, Belgium and Leipzig.\n\nOn 30 September 1853, the 20-year-old composer [[Johannes Brahms]] arrived unannounced at the door of the Schumanns carrying a letter of introduction from violinist [[Joseph Joachim]]. (Schumann was not at home, and would not meet Brahms until the next day.) Brahms amazed Clara and Robert with his music, stayed with them for several weeks, and became a close family friend. (He later worked closely with Clara to popularize Schumann's compositions during her long widowhood.)\n\nDuring this time Schumann, Brahms and Schumann's pupil [[Albert Dietrich]] collaborated on the composition of the ''[[F-A-E Sonata|''F-A-E'' Sonata]]'' for Joachim; Schumann also published an article, \"Neue Bahnen\" (\"New Paths\") in the ''Neue Zeitschrift'' (his first article in many years), hailing the unknown young Brahms from Hamburg, a man who had published nothing, as \"the Chosen One\" who \"was destined to give ideal expression to the times.\"<ref>Robert Schumann's \"Artikel Neue Bahnen\", 28 October 1853</ref> It was an extraordinary way to present Brahms to the musical world, setting up great expectations that he did not fulfill for many years.<ref>Brahms' [[A German Requiem (Brahms)|''A German Requiem'']], published in 1868, brought the first widespread recognition of his talent.</ref> In January 1854, Schumann went to [[Hanover]], where he heard a performance of his ''Paradise and the Peri'' organized by Joachim and Brahms. Two years later at Schumann's request, the work received its first English performance conducted by [[William Sterndale Bennett]].\n[[File:Bonn graveyard robert schumann 20080509.jpg|thumb|upright|Grave of Robert and Clara Schumann at [[Bonn]]]]\n\nSchumann returned to D\u00fcsseldorf and began to edit his complete works and make an anthology on the subject of music. He suffered a renewal of the symptoms that had threatened him earlier. Besides the single note sounding in his ear (possibly evidence of [[tinnitus]],<ref name=\":0\" />) he imagined that voices sounded in his ear and he heard angelic music.<ref name=\":0\" /> One night he suddenly left his bed, having dreamt or imagined that a ghost (purportedly the spirit of either Schubert or Mendelssohn) had dictated a \"spirit theme\" to him. The theme was one he had used several times before: in his Second String Quartet, again in his ''Lieder-Album f\u00fcr die Jugend'', and finally in the slow movement of his [[Violin Concerto (Schumann)|Violin Concerto]]. In the days leading up to his suicide attempt, Schumann wrote five variations on this theme for the piano, his last completed work, today known as the ''[[Geistervariationen]]'' (Ghost Variations).<ref>{{cite web |first=Joseph |last=Stevenson |title=Robert Schumann: Variations on an original theme, for piano in E flat major (\"Geister-Variationen\"), WoO 24 |work=AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/composition/variations-on-an-original-theme-for-piano-in-e-flat-major-geister-variationen-woo-24-mc0002377594 |accessdate=22 March 2019}}</ref> Brahms published it in a supplementary volume to the complete edition of Schumann's piano music. In 1861 Brahms published his ''Variations for Piano Four Hands'', Op. 23, based on this theme.\n\n[[File:Robertschumann.jpg|thumb|upright|Robert Schumann monument at his birthplace [[Zwickau]], Germany]]\n\n===Final illness and death===\nIn late February 1854, Schumann's symptoms increased, the angelic visions sometimes being replaced by demonic ones. He warned Clara that he feared he might do her harm. On 27 February, he attempted suicide by throwing himself from a bridge into the [[Rhine]] River (his elder sister Emilie had committed suicide in 1825, possibly by drowning herself). Rescued by boatmen and taken home, he asked to be taken to an asylum for the insane. He entered Dr. Franz Richarz's [[sanatorium]] in [[Endenich]], a quarter of [[Bonn]], and remained there until he died on 29 July 1856 at the age of 46. During his confinement, he was not allowed to see Clara, although Brahms was free to visit him. Clara finally visited him two days before his death. He appeared to recognize her, but was able to speak only a few words.<ref>Daverio, Grove online, 20</ref>\n\nGiven his reported symptoms, one modern view is that he died from [[syphilis]], which he could have contracted during his student days, and which could have remained latent during most of his marriage.<ref>Reich, Nancy B., ''Clara Schumann: The Artist and the Woman,'' Cornell University Press, 1985, p. 151.</ref> According to studies by the musicologist and literary scholar [[Eric Sams]], Schumann's symptoms during his terminal illness and death appear consistent with those of [[mercury poisoning]]; mercury was a common treatment for syphilis and other conditions. Another possibility is that his neurological problems were the result of an intracranial mass. A report by Janisch and Nauhaus on Schumann's autopsy indicates that he had a \"gelatinous\" tumor at the base of the brain; it may have represented a [[colloid cyst]], a [[craniopharyngioma]], a [[chordoma]], or a chordoid [[meningioma]].<ref>J\u00e4nisch W, Nauhaus G. \"Autopsy report of the corpse of the composer Robert Schumann: publication and interpretation of a rediscovered document\", ''Zentralbl Allg Pathol'' 1986; 132: 129\u201336.</ref> In particular, meningiomas are known to produce musical auditory hallucinations such as Schumann reported.<ref>Scott M. \"Musical hallucinations from meningioma\", ''[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]]'' 1979; 241: 1683. {{pmid|430721}}</ref> It has also been hypothesised that he suffered from [[schizophrenia]], or [[schizoaffective disorder]]; bipolar type,<ref>Yasmeen Cooper and Mark Agius, [http://www.psychiatria-danubina.com/UserDocsImages/pdf/dnb_vol30_noSuppl%207/dnb_vol30_noSuppl%207_559.pdf \"Does Schizoaffective Disorder Explain the Mental Illness of Robert Schumann and Vincent Van Gogh?\"], Psychiatria Danubina, 2018; Vol. 30, Suppl. 7, pp 559-562</ref> or [[bipolar disorder]] and [[bipolar II disorder]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/196/4/325 |title=Robert Schumann's contribution to the genetics of psychosis |first=Katharina |last=Domschke |journal=British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=196 |issue=4 |page=325 |date=March 2010 |accessdate=17 June 2015|doi=10.1192/bjp.196.4.325 |pmid=20357311 }}</ref>\n\nSchumann heard a persistent A-note at the end of his life.

From mid-career on, she mainly performed music by leading composers. A hired cook and housekeeper tended to the children while she traveled. In 1856, she first visited England. The critics received Robert's music coolly, with [[Henry Fothergill Chorley]] being particularly harsh. She returned to London in 1865 and made regular appearances there in later years, often performing chamber music with the violinist [[Joseph Joachim]] and others. She became the authoritative editor of her husband's works for [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]]. It was rumoured that she and Brahms destroyed many of Schumann's later works, which they thought were tainted by his madness, but only the ''Five Pieces for Cello and Piano'' are known to have been destroyed. Most of Schumann's late works, particularly the [[Violin Concerto (Schumann)|Violin Concerto]], the ''Fantasy for Violin and Orchestra'' and the Violin Sonata No. 3, all from 1853, have entered the repertoire.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Zwickau Robert Schumann Birth House.jpg|thumb|left|Birthplace of Robert Schumann in Zwickau in 2005]]\n[[File:GDR stamp Robert Schumann 1956-vertical.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[East Germany]] 1956 Schumann/Schubert error: Schubert's music is on the top stamp, and Schumann's on the bottom]]\n[[File:1960 CPA 2422.jpg|thumb|upright|1960 [[Russian Post#Soviet Union|Post of the USSR]] stamp marking the 150th anniversary of Schumann's birth.]]\n\nSchumann had considerable influence in the nineteenth century and beyond, despite his adoption of more conservative modes of composition after his marriage. He left an array of acclaimed music in virtually all the forms then known. Partly through his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Brahms, Schumann's ideals and musical vocabulary became widely disseminated. Composer Sir [[Edward Elgar]] called Schumann \"my ideal.\"\n\nSchumann has often been confused with Austrian composer [[Franz Schubert]]; one well-known example occurred in 1956, when [[East Germany]] issued a pair of postage stamps featuring Schumann's picture against an open score that featured Schubert's music.

According to Daverio, there is no evidence of the middle name \"Alexander\" that appears in some sources.</ref> ({{IPA-de|\u02c8\u0283u\u02d0man|lang}}; 8 June 1810{{spaced ndash}}29 July 1856) was a German composer, pianist, and influential music critic. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers of the [[Romantic music|Romantic]] era. Schumann left the study of law, intending to pursue a career as a [[virtuoso]] pianist. His teacher, [[Friedrich Wieck]], a German pianist, had assured him that he could become the finest pianist in Europe, but a hand injury ended this dream. Schumann then focused his musical energies on composing.\n\nIn 1840, after a long and acrimonious legal battle with Wieck, who opposed the marriage, Schumann married Wieck's daughter [[Clara Schumann|Clara]]. A lifelong partnership in music began, as Clara herself was an established pianist and music prodigy. Clara and Robert also maintained a close relationship with German composer [[Johannes Brahms]].\n\nUntil 1840, Schumann wrote exclusively for the piano. Later, he composed piano and orchestral works, and many [[Lied]]er (songs for voice and piano). He composed four [[Symphony|symphonies]], one [[opera]], and other orchestral, [[choral]], and [[chamber music|chamber]] works. His best-known works include ''[[Carnaval (Schumann)|Carnaval]]'', ''[[Symphonic Studies (Schumann)|Symphonic Studies]]'', ''[[Kinderszenen]]'', ''[[Kreisleriana]]'', and the ''[[Fantasie in C (Schumann)|Fantasie in C]]''. Schumann was known for infusing his music with characters through motifs, as well as references to works of literature. These characters bled into his editorial writing in the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik]]'' (New Journal for Music), a [[Leipzig]]-based publication that he co-founded.\n\nSchumann suffered from a [[mental disorder]] that first manifested in 1833 as a severe [[melancholic depression|melancholic depressive]] episode\u2014which recurred several times alternating with phases of \"exaltation\" and increasingly also delusional ideas of being poisoned or threatened with metallic items. What is now thought to have been a combination of [[bipolar disorder]] and perhaps [[mercury poisoning]] led to \"manic\" and \"depressive\" periods in Schumann's compositional productivity. After a suicide attempt in 1854, Schumann was admitted at his own request to a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental asylum]] in [[Endenich]] near [[Bonn]]. Diagnosed with ''psychotic [[melancholia]]'', he died of pneumonia two years later at the age of 46, without recovering from his mental illness.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n[[File:Schumannhaus ALT.JPG|thumb|left|Schumann's birth house, now the [[Robert Schumann House]], after an anonymous colourized lithograph]]\n[[File:Rob.Schumann.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Bust (sculpture)|Bust]] of Robert Schumann in the museum of [[Zwickau]]]]\n\nSchumann was born in [[Zwickau]], in the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] (today [[Central Germany (cultural area)|Central Germany]]), the fifth and last child of Johanna Christiane (n\u00e9e Schnabel) and August Schumann.<ref>Ostwald, p. 11</ref> Schumann began to compose before the age of seven, but his boyhood was spent in the cultivation of literature as much as music\u2014undoubtedly influenced by his father, a bookseller, publisher, and novelist.<ref>{{cite book\n | author=Robert Schumann\n | editor = Konrad Wolff\n | others = Translated by Paul Rosenfeld\n | title = On Music and Musicians\n | year = 1982\n | publisher=University of California Press\n | isbn = 978-0-520-04685-6 }}</ref>\n\nAt age seven, Schumann began studying general music and piano with Johann Gottfried Kuntzsch, a teacher at the Zwickau high school. The boy immediately developed a love of music, and worked on his own compositions, without the aid of Kuntzsch. Even though he often disregarded the principles of musical composition, he created works regarded as admirable for his age. The ''Universal Journal of Music'' 1850 supplement included a biographical sketch of Schumann that noted, \"It has been related that Schumann, as a child, possessed rare taste and talent for portraying feelings and characteristic traits in melody,\u2014ay, he could sketch the different dispositions of his intimate friends by certain figures and passages on the piano so exactly and comically that everyone burst into loud laughter at the similitude of the portrait.\"<ref>[[Eric Himy]], pianist, Recording ''Homage to Schumann'', CD Notes, (Centaur, 2006), CEN 2858, chosen by BBC December 2007 as CD of the month, includes \"Kinderscenen\", \"Tr\u00e4umerei\"</ref>\n\nAt age 14, Schumann wrote an essay on the aesthetics of music and also contributed to a volume, edited by his father, titled ''Portraits of Famous Men''. While still at school in Zwickau, he read the works of the German poet-philosophers [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], as well as [[Lord Byron|Byron]] and the [[Tragedy#Ancient Greek tragedy|Greek tragedians]]. His most powerful and permanent literary inspiration was [[Jean Paul]], a German writer whose influence is seen in Schumann's youthful novels ''Juniusabende'', completed in 1826, and ''Selene''.\n\nSchumann's interest in music was sparked by attending a performance of [[Ignaz Moscheles]] playing at [[Karlovy Vary|Karlsbad]], and he later developed an interest in the works of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], and [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]. His father, who had encouraged his musical aspirations, died in 1826 when Schumann was 16. Thereafter, neither his mother nor his guardian encouraged him to pursue a music career. In 1828, Schumann left high school, and after a trip during which he met the poet [[Heinrich Heine]] in Munich, he left to study law at the University of Leipzig under family pressure. But in Leipzig Schumann instead focused on improvisation, song composition, and writing novels. He also began to seriously study piano with Friedrick Wieck, a well-known piano teacher. In 1829, he continued his law studies in [[Heidelberg]], where he became a lifelong member of [[Corps Saxo-Borussia Heidelberg]].\n\n{{See also|German Student Corps|Corps}}\n\n===1830\u201334===\n[[File:Robert-Schumann-Haus.JPG|thumb|upright|Schumann's music room in Zwickau]]\n\nDuring [[Eastertide]] 1830, he heard the Italian violinist, violist, guitarist, and composer [[Niccol\u00f2 Paganini]] play in [[Frankfurt]]. In July he wrote to his mother, \"My whole life has been a struggle between Poetry and Prose, or call it Music and Law.\" With her permission, by Christmas he was back in Leipzig, at age 20 taking piano lessons from his old master [[Friedrich Wieck]], who assured him that he would be a successful concert pianist after a few years' study with him.<ref>{{harvnb|Perrey|2007|p=11}}</ref> During his studies with Wieck, some stories claim that Schumann permanently injured a finger on his right hand. Wieck claimed that Schumann damaged his finger by using a mechanical device that held back one finger while he exercised the others\u2014which was supposed to strengthen the weakest fingers.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|last1=Jensen|first1=Eric Frederick|title=Schumann|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195346060|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xdGlFgzLW6MC&pg=PA70|accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> [[Clara Schumann]] discredited the story, saying the disability was not due to a mechanical device, and Robert Schumann himself referred to it as \"an affliction of the whole hand.\" Some argue that, as the disability appeared to have been chronic and have affected the hand, and not just a finger, it was not likely caused by a finger strengthening device.<ref>{{cite journal| jstor= 954772 | first= Eric| last= Sams | title= Schumann's hand injury| journal= The Musical Times| volume= 112| pages= 1156\u20131159| number= 1546 |date= December 1971| doi= 10.2307/954772}}</ref>\n\nSchumann abandoned the idea of a concert career and devoted himself instead to composition. To this end he began a study of music theory under [[Heinrich Dorn]], a German composer six years his senior and, at that time, conductor of the [[Leipzig Opera]].\n\n====''Papillons''====\nSchumann's fusion of literary ideas with musical ones\u2014known as [[program music]]\u2014may have first taken shape in ''[[Papillons]]'', Op. 2 (''Butterflies''), a musical portrayal of events in [[Jean Paul]]'s novel ''Die Flegeljahre''. In a letter from Leipzig dated April 1832, Schumann bids his brothers, \"Read the last scene in Jean Paul's ''Flegeljahre'' as soon as possible, because the ''Papillons'' are intended as a musical representation of that masquerade.\" This inspiration is foreshadowed to some extent in his first written criticism\u2014an 1831 essay on [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]]'s [[Variations on \"L\u00e0 ci darem la mano\" (Chopin)|variations on a theme]] from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', published in the ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]''. In it, Schumann\ncreates imaginary characters who discuss Chopin's work: Florestan (the embodiment of Schumann's passionate, voluble side) and Eusebius (his dreamy, introspective side)\u2014the counterparts of Vult and Walt in ''Flegeljahre.'' They call on a third, Meister Raro, for his opinion. Raro may represent either the composer himself, Wieck's daughter [[Clara Schumann|Clara]], or the combination of the two (Cla'''ra''' + '''Ro'''bert).\n\nIn the winter of 1832, at age 22, Schumann visited relatives in Zwickau and [[Schneeberg, Saxony|Schneeberg]], where he performed the first movement of his ''Symphony in G minor'' (without opus number, known as the \"Zwickauer\"). In Zwickau, the music was performed at a concert given by Clara Wieck, who was then just 13 years old. On this occasion Clara played bravura Variations by [[Henri Herz]], a composer whom Schumann was already deriding as a philistine.<ref>Robert Schumann, musical Journal</ref> Schumann's mother said to Clara, \"You must marry my Robert one day.\"<ref>Berthold Litzmann 1910</ref> The ''Symphony in G minor'' was not published during Schumann's lifetime but has been played and recorded in recent times.\n\nThe 1833 deaths of Schumann's brother Julius and his sister-in-law Rosalie in the [[Second cholera pandemic (1829-1851)|worldwide cholera pandemic]] brought on a [[Major depressive disorder|severe depressive]] episode.\n\n[[File:Robert Schumann in youth.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A youthful Robert Schumann]]\n\n====''Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik''====\nBy spring 1834, Schumann had sufficiently recovered to inaugurate ''[[Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik|Die Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik]]'' (\"New Journal for Music\"), first published on 3 April 1834. In his writings, Schumann created a fictional music society based on people in his life, called the ''[[Davidsb\u00fcndler]]'', named after the biblical King David who fought against the Philistines. Schumann published most of his critical writings in the journal, and often lambasted the popular taste for flashy technical displays from figures whom Schumann perceived as inferior composers, or \"philistines\". Schumann campaigned to revive interest in major composers of the past, including [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], and [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]]. He also promoted the work of some contemporary composers, including [[Chopin]] (about whom Schumann famously wrote, \"Hats off, Gentlemen! A genius!\")<ref>[[Vladimir Ashkenazy]]'s notes, Favourite Chopin</ref> and [[Hector Berlioz]], whom he praised for creating music of substance. On the other hand, Schumann disparaged the school of [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Richard Wagner]]. Among Schumann's associates at this time were composers [[Norbert Burgm\u00fcller]] and [[Ludwig Schuncke]] (to whom Schumann dedicated his ''Toccata in C'').\n\nDuring the summer of 1834 Schumann became engaged to 16-year-old Ernestine von Fricken, the adopted daughter of a rich Bohemian-born noble. In August 1835, he learned that Ernestine von Fricken was born illegitimate, which meant that she would have no dowry. Fearful that her limited means would force him to earn his living like a \"day-labourer,\" Schumann made a complete break with her toward the end of the year. He felt a growing attraction to 15-year-old Clara Wieck. They made mutual declarations of love in December in Zwickau, where Clara appeared in concert. His budding romance with Clara was disrupted when her father learned of their trysts during the Christmas holidays. He summarily forbade them further meetings, and ordered all their correspondence burnt.\n\n====''Carnaval''====\n''[[Carnaval (Schumann)|Carnaval]]'', Op. 9 (1834) is one of Schumann's most characteristic piano works. Schumann begins nearly every section of ''Carnaval'' with a [[musical cryptogram]], the musical notes signified in German by the letters that spell [[A\u0161|Asch]] (A, E-flat, C, and B, or alternatively A-flat, C, and B; in German these are A, Es, C and H, and As, C and H respectively), the [[Bohemia]]n town in which Ernestine was born, and the notes are also the musical letters in Schumann's own name. Eusebius and Florestan, the imaginary figures appearing so often in his critical writings, also appear, alongside brilliant imitations of Chopin and Paganini. To each of these characters he devotes a section of ''Carnaval''. The work comes to a close with a march of the ''Davidsb\u00fcndler''\u2014the league of [[King David]]'s men against the [[Philistines]]\u2014in which may be heard the clear accents of truth in contest with the dull clamour of falsehood embodied in a [[Musical quotation|quotation]] from the seventeenth century ''[[Grossvater Tanz|Grandfather's Dance]]''. The march, a step nearly always in duple meter, is here in 3/4 time (triple meter). The work ends in joy and a degree of mock-triumph. In ''Carnaval'', Schumann went further than in ''Papillons'', by conceiving the story as well as the musical representation (and also displaying a maturation of compositional resource).\n\n===1835\u201339===\nOn 3 October 1835, Schumann met [[Felix Mendelssohn]] at Wieck's house in Leipzig, and his enthusiastic appreciation of that artist<ref>{{harvnb|Daverio|1997|p=134}}</ref> was shown with the same generous freedom that distinguished his acknowledgement of the greatness of Chopin and other colleagues, and later prompted him to publicly pronounce the then-unknown [[Johannes Brahms]] a genius.\n[[File:Andreas Staub - Clara Wieck (Lithographie 1839, cropped).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|[[Clara Wieck]] in an idealized lithograph by [[Andreas Staub]], c. 1839]]\n[[File:Friedrich Wieck um 1838.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Friedrich Wieck]] in a sketch by [[Pauline Viardot-Garcia]], around 1838]]\n\nIn 1837 Schumann published his ''[[Symphonic Studies (Schumann)|Symphonic Studies]]'', a complex set of ''\u00e9tude''-like variations written in 1834\u20131835, which demanded a finished piano technique. These variations were based on a theme by the adoptive father of Ernestine von Fricken. The work\u2014described as \"one of the peaks of the piano literature, lofty in conception and faultless in workmanship\" [Hutcheson]\u2014was dedicated to the young English composer [[William Sterndale Bennett]], for whom Schumann had had a high regard when they worked together in Leipzig.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe ''[[Davidsb\u00fcndlert\u00e4nze]]'', Op.&nbsp;6, (also published in 1837 despite the low opus number) literally \"Dances of the League of David\", is an embodiment of the struggle between enlightened Romanticism and musical philistinism. Schumann credited the two sides of his character with the composition of the work (the more passionate numbers are signed F. (Florestan) and the more dreamy signed E. (Eusebius)). The work begins with the \"motto of C.&nbsp;W.\" (Clara Wieck) denoting her support for the ideals of the ''Davidsbund''. The ''Bund'' was a music society of Schumann's imagination, members of which were kindred spirits (as he saw them) such as Chopin, Paganini and Clara, as well as the personalized Florestan and Eusebius.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''[[Kinderszenen]]'', Op. 15, completed in 1838 and a favourite of Schumann's piano works, depicts the innocence and playfulness of childhood. The \"Tr\u00e4umerei\" in F major, No. 7 of the set, is one of the most famous piano pieces ever written, and has been performed in myriad forms and transcriptions. It has been the favourite [[Encore (concert)|encore]] of several great pianists, including [[Vladimir Horowitz]]. Melodic and deceptively simple, the piece is \"complex\" in its harmonic structure.<ref>[[Alban Berg]], replying to charges that modern music was overly complex, pointed out that ''Kinderszenen'' is constructed on a complex base.</ref>\n\n{{listen\n| header   = [[Kreisleriana]], Op. 16 (1838)\n| filename    = Robert Schumann Kreisleriana Op. 16 N3 Giorgi Latsabidze.ogg\n| title       = N8.

[[Johannes Kreisler]] was a fictional musician created by poet [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]], and characterized as a \"romantic brought into contact with reality.\" Schumann used the figure to express \"fantastic and mad\" emotional states. According to [[Ernest Hutcheson#Works|Hutcheson (\"The Literature of the Piano\")]], this work is \"among the finest efforts of Schumann's genius. He never surpassed the searching beauty of the slow movements (Nos. 2, 4, 6) or the urgent passion of others (Nos. 1, 3, 5, 7) [\u2026] To appreciate it a high level of aesthetic intelligence is required [\u2026] This is no facile music, there is severity alike in its beauty and its passion.\"\n\nThe ''[[Fantasie in C (Schumann)|Fantasie in C]]'', Op. 17, composed in the summer of 1836, is a work of passion and deep pathos, imbued with the spirit of the late Beethoven. Schumann intended to use proceeds from sales of the work toward the construction of [[Beethoven Monument (Bonn)|a monument to Beethoven]], who had died in 1827. The first movement of the ''Fantasie'' contains a [[Musical quotation|musical quote]] from Beethoven's song cycle, ''[[An die ferne Geliebte]]'', Op. 98 (at the Adagio coda, taken from the last song of the cycle). The original titles of the movements were ''Ruins'', ''Triumphal Arch'', and ''The Starry Crown''. According to [[Franz Liszt]],<ref>Strelezki: ''Personal Recollections of Chats with Liszt''</ref> who played the work for Schumann and to whom it was dedicated, the ''Fantasie'' was apt to be played too heavily, and should have a dreamier (''tr\u00e4umerisch'') character than vigorous German pianists tended to impart. Liszt also said: \"It is a noble work, worthy of Beethoven, whose career, by the way, it is supposed to represent\".<ref>Anton Strelezki: ''Personal Recollections of Chats with Liszt''. London, 1893.</ref> Again, according to Hutcheson: \"No words can describe the Phantasie, no quotations set forth the majesty of its genius. It must suffice to say that it is Schumann's greatest work in large form for piano solo.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n{{listen\n| header   = [[Arabeske (Schumann)|Arabeske in C major, Op. 18 (1839)]]\n| filename    = Schumann-arabeske-andrea-valori.ogg\n| title       = Arabeske (Schumann)\n| description = [[Mario Andrea Valori]], piano, 2011\n| format      = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\nAfter a visit to [[Vienna]], during which he discovered [[Franz Schubert]]'s previously unknown [[Symphony No. 9 (Schubert)|Symphony No. 9 in C]], in 1839 Schumann wrote the ''[[Faschingsschwank aus Wien]]'' (''Carnival Prank from Vienna''). Most of the joke is in the central section of the first movement, which makes a thinly veiled reference to ''[[La Marseillaise]]''. (Vienna had banned the song due to harsh memories of [[Napoleon]]'s invasion.) The festive mood does not preclude moments of melancholic introspection in the Intermezzo.\n\n===1840\u201349===\nFrom 1832 to 1839, Schumann wrote almost exclusively for piano, but in 1840 alone he wrote at least 138 songs. Indeed, 1840 (the ''Liederjahr'' or ''year of song'') is highly significant in Schumann's musical legacy, despite his earlier deriding of works for piano and voice as inferior.\n\nAfter a long and acrimonious legal battle with her father, Schumann married Clara Wieck on 12 September 1840, at [[Leipzig-Sch\u00f6nefeld|Sch\u00f6nefeld]], the day before her 21st birthday. Had they waited another day, they would no longer have required her father's consent. Their marriage supported a remarkable business partnership, with Clara  acting as an inspiration, critic, and confidante to her husband. Despite her delicate appearance, she was an extremely strong-willed and energetic woman, who kept up a demanding schedule of concert tours in between bearing several children. Two years after their marriage, Friedrich Wieck at last reconciled himself with the couple, eager to see his grandchildren.\n\nPrior to the legal case and subsequent marriage, the lovers exchanged love letters and rendezvoused in secret. Robert often waited for hours in a cafe in a nearby city just to see Clara for a few minutes after one of her concerts. The strain of this long courtship and its consummation may have led to this great outpouring of Lieder (vocal songs with piano accompaniment). This is evident in ''Widmung'', for example, where he uses the melody from [[Franz Schubert|Schubert's]] [[Ave Maria (Schubert)|''Ave Maria'']] in the postlude in homage to Clara. Schumann's biographers attribute the sweetness, doubt, and despair of these songs to the emotions aroused by his love for Clara and the uncertainties of their future together.\n\nRobert and Clara had eight children, Emil (1846\u20131847), who died at 1 year; Marie (1841\u20131929); Elise (1843\u20131928); Julie (1845\u20131872); Ludwig (1848\u20131899); Ferdinand (1849\u20131891); [[Eugenie Schumann|Eugenie]] (1851\u20131938); and Felix (1854\u20131879).\n\n[[File:Robert and Clara Schumann.jpg|thumb|The stylized profiles of Clara and Robert Schumann]]\n\nHis chief song-cycles in this period were settings of the ''[[Liederkreis, Op. 39|Liederkreis]]'' of [[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff|Joseph von Eichendorff]], Op. 39 (depicting a series of moods relating to or inspired by nature); the ''[[Frauenliebe und -leben]]'' of [[Adelbert von Chamisso|Chamisso]], Op. 42 (relating the tale of a woman's marriage, childbirth and widowhood); the ''[[Dichterliebe]]'' of [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]], Op. 48 (depicting a lover rejected, but coming to terms with his painful loss through renunciation and forgiveness); and ''Myrthen'', a collection of songs, including poems by Goethe, [[Friedrich R\u00fcckert|R\u00fcckert]], Heine, Byron, [[Robert Burns|Burns]] and Moore. The songs ''Belsatzar'', Op. 57 and ''Die beiden Grenadiere'', Op. 49, both to Heine's words, show Schumann at his best as a ballad writer, although the dramatic ballad is less congenial to him than the introspective lyric. The Op. 35, 40 and 98a sets (words by [[Justinus Kerner]], Chamisso and Goethe respectively), although less well known, also contain songs of lyric and dramatic quality.\n\n{{listen\n | header       = Andante and Variations, Op. 46 (1843)<br />Performed by Neal and Nancy O'Doan (pianos), Carter Enyeart and Toby Saks (cellos) and Christopher Leuba (horn)\n | filename     = Robert Schumann - Andante and Variations - Introduction, Theme and Variations 01-05.ogg\n | title        = Introduction, Theme and Variations 1\u20135\n | format       = [[ogg]]\n | description  =\n | filename2    = Robert Schumann - Andante and Variations - Variations 06-10.ogg\n | title2       = Variations 6\u201310\n | format2      = [[ogg]]\n | description2 =\n | filename3    = Robert Schumann - Andante and Variations - Variations 11-15.ogg\n | title3       = Variations 11\u201315\n | format3      = [[ogg]]\n | description3 =\n | image        = none\n}}\n\nIn 1841 he wrote two of his four symphonies, [[Symphony No. 1 (Schumann)|No. 1 in B-flat]], Op. 38, ''Spring'' and [[Symphony No. 4 (Schumann)|No. 4 in D minor]] (the latter a pioneering work in \"cyclic form\", was performed that year but published only much later after revision and extensive re-orchestration as Op. 120). He devoted 1842 to composing chamber music, including the [[Piano Quintet (Schumann)|Piano Quintet in E-flat]], Op. 44, now one of his best known and most admired works; the [[Piano Quartet (Schumann)|Piano Quartet]] and [[String Quartets (Schumann)|three string quartets]]. In 1843 he wrote ''[[Paradise and the Peri]]'', his first attempt at concerted vocal music, an [[oratorio]] style work based on ''[[Lalla-Rookh]]'' by [[Thomas Moore]]. After this, his compositions were not confined to any one form during any particular period.\n\nThe stage in his life when he was deeply engaged in setting Goethe's ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' to music (1844\u201353) was a turbulent one for his health. He spent the first half of 1844 with Clara on tour in Russia, and his depression grew worse as he felt inferior to Clara as a musician. On returning to Germany, he abandoned his editorial work and left Leipzig for [[Dresden]], where he suffered from persistent \"[[nervous prostration]]\". As soon as he began to work, he was seized with fits of shivering and an apprehension of death, experiencing an abhorrence of high places, all metal instruments (even keys), and drugs. Schumann's diaries also state that he suffered perpetually from imagining that he had the [[A (musical note)#Designation by octave|note A5]] sounding in his ears.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHis state of unease and [[neurasthenia]] is reflected in his [[Symphony No. 2 (Schumann)|Symphony in C]], numbered second but third in order of composition, in which the composer explores states of exhaustion, obsession, and depression, culminating in Beethovenian spiritual triumph. Also published in 1845 was his [[Piano Concerto (Schumann)|Piano Concerto in A minor, Op. 54]], originally conceived and performed as a one-movement ''Fantasy for Piano and Orchestra'' in 1841. It is one of the most popular and oft-recorded of all piano concertos; according to Hutcheson \"Schumann achieved a masterly work and we inherited the finest piano concerto since Mozart and Beethoven\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[File:Robert u Clara Schumann 1847.jpg|thumb|left|Robert and Clara Schumann in 1847, lithograph with a personal dedication]]\n\nIn 1846, he felt he had recovered. In the winter, the Schumanns revisited Vienna, traveling to [[Prague]] and Berlin in the spring of 1847 and in the summer to Zwickau, where he was received with enthusiasm. This pleased him, since until that time he was famous in only Dresden and Leipzig.\n\nHis only opera, ''[[Genoveva]]'', Op. 81, premiered in Spring 1850.{{harvnb|Daverio|1997|p=334}} In it, Schumann attempted to abolish [[recitative]], which he regarded as an interruption to the musical flow (an influence on [[Richard Wagner]]; Schumann's consistently flowing melody can be seen as a forerunner to Wagner's ''Melos''). The subject of ''Genoveva''\u2014based on [[Ludwig Tieck]] and [[Christian Friedrich Hebbel]]'s plays\u2014was not seen an ideal choice. The text is often considered to lack dramatic qualities; the work has not remained in the repertoire. As early as 1842 the possibilities of German opera had been keenly realized by Schumann, who wrote, \"Do you know my prayer as an artist, night and morning? It is called 'German Opera.' Here is a real field for enterprise ... something simple, profound, German\". And in his notebook of suggestions for the text of operas are found amongst others: ''[[Nibelung]]en'', ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' and ''[[Till Eulenspiegel]]''.\n\nThe music to [[Lord Byron|Byron]]'s ''[[Manfred]]'' was written in 1849, the overture of which is one of Schumann's most frequently performed orchestral works. The [[May Uprising in Dresden|insurrection of Dresden]] caused Schumann to move to [[Kreischa]], a little village a few miles outside the city. In August 1849, on the occasion of the centenary of Goethe's birth, completed scenes of Schumann's ''[[Scenes from Goethe's Faust]]'' were performed in Dresden, Leipzig and [[Weimar]]. Liszt gave him assistance and encouragement. The rest of the work was written later in 1849, and the overture (which Schumann described as \"one of the sturdiest of [his] creations\") in 1853.\n\n===After 1850===\n[[File:Schumann-photo1850.jpg|thumb|right|Robert Schumann in an 1850 [[daguerreotype]]]]\n\nFrom 1850 to 1854, Schumann composed in a wide variety of genres. Critics have disputed the quality of his work at this time; a widely held view has been that his music showed signs of mental breakdown and creative decay. More recently, critics have suggested that the changes in style may be explained by \"lucid experimentation\".<ref name=\":1\">Daverio, Grove online, 19</ref>\n\nIn 1850, Schumann succeeded [[Ferdinand Hiller]] as musical director at [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], but he was a poor conductor and quickly aroused the opposition of the musicians. According to [[Harold C. Schonberg]], in his 1967 ''The Great Conductors'': \"The great composer was impossible on the platform ... There is something heartrending about poor Schumann's epochal inefficiency as a conductor.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/greatconductors0000unse |url-access=registration |author=[[Harold C. Schonberg]] |title=The Great Conductors |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1967 |page=[https://archive.org/details/greatconductors0000unse/page/126 126]}}</ref> His contract was eventually terminated. By the end of that year he completed his [[Symphony No. 3 (Schumann)|Symphony No. 3, \"Rhenish\"]] (a work containing five movements and whose 4th movement is apparently intended to represent an episcopal coronation ceremony). In 1851 he revised what would be published as his [[Symphony No. 4 (Schumann)|fourth symphony]]. From 1851 to 1853 he visited Switzerland, Belgium and Leipzig.\n\nOn 30 September 1853, the 20-year-old composer [[Johannes Brahms]] arrived unannounced at the door of the Schumanns carrying a letter of introduction from violinist [[Joseph Joachim]]. (Schumann was not at home, and would not meet Brahms until the next day.) Brahms amazed Clara and Robert with his music, stayed with them for several weeks, and became a close family friend. (He later worked closely with Clara to popularize Schumann's compositions during her long widowhood.)\n\nDuring this time Schumann, Brahms and Schumann's pupil [[Albert Dietrich]] collaborated on the composition of the ''[[F-A-E Sonata|''F-A-E'' Sonata]]'' for Joachim; Schumann also published an article, \"Neue Bahnen\" (\"New Paths\") in the ''Neue Zeitschrift'' (his first article in many years), hailing the unknown young Brahms from Hamburg, a man who had published nothing, as \"the Chosen One\" who \"was destined to give ideal expression to the times.\"<ref>Robert Schumann's \"Artikel Neue Bahnen\", 28 October 1853</ref> It was an extraordinary way to present Brahms to the musical world, setting up great expectations that he did not fulfill for many years.<ref>Brahms' [[A German Requiem (Brahms)|''A German Requiem'']], published in 1868, brought the first widespread recognition of his talent.</ref> In January 1854, Schumann went to [[Hanover]], where he heard a performance of his ''Paradise and the Peri'' organized by Joachim and Brahms. Two years later at Schumann's request, the work received its first English performance conducted by [[William Sterndale Bennett]].\n[[File:Bonn graveyard robert schumann 20080509.jpg|thumb|upright|Grave of Robert and Clara Schumann at [[Bonn]]]]\n\nSchumann returned to D\u00fcsseldorf and began to edit his complete works and make an anthology on the subject of music. He suffered a renewal of the symptoms that had threatened him earlier. Besides the single note sounding in his ear (possibly evidence of [[tinnitus]],<ref name=\":0\" />) he imagined that voices sounded in his ear and he heard angelic music.<ref name=\":0\" /> One night he suddenly left his bed, having dreamt or imagined that a ghost (purportedly the spirit of either Schubert or Mendelssohn) had dictated a \"spirit theme\" to him. The theme was one he had used several times before: in his Second String Quartet, again in his ''Lieder-Album f\u00fcr die Jugend'', and finally in the slow movement of his [[Violin Concerto (Schumann)|Violin Concerto]]. In the days leading up to his suicide attempt, Schumann wrote five variations on this theme for the piano, his last completed work, today known as the ''[[Geistervariationen]]'' (Ghost Variations).<ref>{{cite web |first=Joseph |last=Stevenson |title=Robert Schumann: Variations on an original theme, for piano in E flat major (\"Geister-Variationen\"), WoO 24 |work=AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/composition/variations-on-an-original-theme-for-piano-in-e-flat-major-geister-variationen-woo-24-mc0002377594 |accessdate=22 March 2019}}</ref> Brahms published it in a supplementary volume to the complete edition of Schumann's piano music. In 1861 Brahms published his ''Variations for Piano Four Hands'', Op. 23, based on this theme.\n\n[[File:Robertschumann.jpg|thumb|upright|Robert Schumann monument at his birthplace [[Zwickau]], Germany]]\n\n===Final illness and death===\nIn late February 1854, Schumann's symptoms increased, the angelic visions sometimes being replaced by demonic ones. He warned Clara that he feared he might do her harm. On 27 February, he attempted suicide by throwing himself from a bridge into the [[Rhine]] River (his elder sister Emilie had committed suicide in 1825, possibly by drowning herself). Rescued by boatmen and taken home, he asked to be taken to an asylum for the insane. He entered Dr. Franz Richarz's [[sanatorium]] in [[Endenich]], a quarter of [[Bonn]], and remained there until he died on 29 July 1856 at the age of 46. During his confinement, he was not allowed to see Clara, although Brahms was free to visit him. Clara finally visited him two days before his death. He appeared to recognize her, but was able to speak only a few words.<ref>Daverio, Grove online, 20</ref>\n\nGiven his reported symptoms, one modern view is that he died from [[syphilis]], which he could have contracted during his student days, and which could have remained latent during most of his marriage.<ref>Reich, Nancy B., ''Clara Schumann: The Artist and the Woman,'' Cornell University Press, 1985, p. 151.</ref> According to studies by the musicologist and literary scholar [[Eric Sams]], Schumann's symptoms during his terminal illness and death appear consistent with those of [[mercury poisoning]]; mercury was a common treatment for syphilis and other conditions. Another possibility is that his neurological problems were the result of an intracranial mass.

From mid-career on, she mainly performed music by leading composers. A hired cook and housekeeper tended to the children while she traveled. In 1856, she first visited England. The critics received Robert's music coolly, with [[Henry Fothergill Chorley]] being particularly harsh. She returned to London in 1865 and made regular appearances there in later years, often performing chamber music with the violinist [[Joseph Joachim]] and others. She became the authoritative editor of her husband's works for [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]]. It was rumoured that she and Brahms destroyed many of Schumann's later works, which they thought were tainted by his madness, but only the ''Five Pieces for Cello and Piano'' are known to have been destroyed. Most of Schumann's late works, particularly the [[Violin Concerto (Schumann)|Violin Concerto]], the ''Fantasy for Violin and Orchestra'' and the Violin Sonata No. 3, all from 1853, have entered the repertoire.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Zwickau Robert Schumann Birth House.jpg|thumb|left|Birthplace of Robert Schumann in Zwickau in 2005]]\n[[File:GDR stamp Robert Schumann 1956-vertical.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[East Germany]] 1956 Schumann/Schubert error: Schubert's music is on the top stamp, and Schumann's on the bottom]]\n[[File:1960 CPA 2422.jpg|thumb|upright|1960 [[Russian Post#Soviet Union|Post of the USSR]] stamp marking the 150th anniversary of Schumann's birth.]]\n\nSchumann had considerable influence in the nineteenth century and beyond, despite his adoption of more conservative modes of composition after his marriage. He left an array of acclaimed music in virtually all the forms then known. Partly through his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Brahms, Schumann's ideals and musical vocabulary became widely disseminated. Composer Sir [[Edward Elgar]] called Schumann \"my ideal.\"\n\nSchumann has often been confused with Austrian composer [[Franz Schubert]]; one well-known example occurred in 1956, when [[East Germany]] issued a pair of postage stamps featuring Schumann's picture against an open score that featured Schubert's music.

The family consisted of John Bender and his wife, Elvira, their son, John&nbsp;Jr., and daughter, Kate. While Bender mythology holds that John&nbsp;Jr. and Kate were siblings, contemporary newspapers reported that several of the Benders' neighbors had stated that they claimed to be married, possibly a [[common law marriage]].\n\nWhile there is no definitive number, estimates report that the Benders killed at least a dozen travelers before their crimes were discovered and the family fled, with their fate uncertain. Much folklore and legend surrounds the Benders, making it difficult to separate fact from fiction.\n\n==Background==\nIn October 1870, five families of [[Spiritualism|spiritualists]] [[Homestead Act|homesteaded]] in and around the [[township]] of Osage in northwestern Labette County, approximately {{convert|7|mi|km|abbr=on}} northeast of where [[Cherryvale, Kansas|Cherryvale]] would be established seven months later. One of the families was John Bender&nbsp;Sr. and John Bender&nbsp;Jr., who registered {{convert|160|acre|ha}} of land located adjacent to the [[Great Osage Trail]], which was then the only open road for traveling further west. After a cabin, a barn with corral, and a well were built, in the [[Autumn|fall]] of 1871, Elvira Bender and daughter Kate arrived, and the cabin was divided into two rooms by a canvas [[curtain|wagon-cover]]. The Benders used the smaller room at the rear for living quarters, while the front room was converted into a \"[[general store]]\" where a few dry goods were sold. The front section also contained the kitchen and dining table, where travelers could stop for a meal or even spend the night. Elvira and Kate Bender also planted a {{convert|2|acre|ha|adj=on}} vegetable garden and apple orchard north of the cabin.<ref name=\"leatherock\">[http://www.leatherockhotel.com/BloodyBenders.htm Bloody Bender Family 1871-1873]</ref><ref name=\"legends\">[http://www.legendsofamerica.com/ks-benders.html The Bloody Benders of Labette County] Legends of America A Travel Site for the Nostalgic & Historic Minded</ref><ref name=\"flex\">[http://www.flexassistant.com/images/Benders.pdf Malice, Madness, and Mayhem: an Eclectic Collection of American Infamy pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711005803/http://www.flexassistant.com/images/Benders.pdf |date=2011-07-11 }} The Bloody Benders</ref>\n\n==Bender family==\nJohn Bender, Sr. was around sixty years old and spoke very little English. When he did speak it, it was so [[guttural]] that it was usually unintelligible. According to the May 23, 1873 edition of ''The Emporia News'', he was identified with the name of William Bender. Elvira Bender, who also allegedly spoke very little English, was 55 years of age and was so unfriendly that her neighbors took to calling her a \"she-devil\". \n\nJohn Bender&nbsp;Jr. was around 25 years old, handsome with auburn hair and a mustache, and spoke English fluently but with a [[Germany|German]] accent. John was prone to laughing aimlessly, which led many to consider him a \"half-wit\". Kate Bender, who was around 23, was cultivated and attractive and spoke English well with very little accent. A self-proclaimed healer and psychic, she distributed flyers advertising her supernatural powers and her ability to cure illnesses. She also conducted [[s\u00e9ance]]s and gave lectures on spiritualism, for which she gained notoriety for advocating [[free love]]. Kate's popularity became a large attraction for the Benders' inn. Although the elder Benders kept to themselves, Kate and her brother regularly attended Sunday school in nearby Harmony Grove.\n\nThe Benders were widely believed to be German immigrants. No documentation or definitive proof of their relationships to one another, or where they were born, has ever been found. John Bender, Sr. was from either Germany or the [[Netherlands]] and is thought by some{{By whom|date=July 2019}} to have been born John Flickinger. According to contemporary newspapers, Elvira was born Almira Hill Mark (often misreported as \"Meik\") in the [[Adirondack Mountains]]; she married Simon Mark, with whom she claimed to have had 12 children. Later, she married William Stephen Griffith. Elvira was suspected{{By whom|date=July 2019}} of murdering several husbands, but none of these rumors were ever proven. Kate was believed{{By whom|date=July 2019}} to be Elvira's fifth daughter. Some of the Benders' neighbors claimed that John and Kate were not brother and sister, but actually husband and wife.\n\nFrom those who knew them and have written about them, we gather the following:\n\"The old man was a repulsive, hideous brute, without a redeeming trait, dirty, profane and ill-tempered.\"  \"Old Mrs. Bender was a dirty old Dutch crone. Her face was a fit picture of the midnight hag that wove the spell murderous ambition about the soul of Macbeth.\"\nYoung Bender, seen when excited, recalled the grave-robbing hyena at once to mind.\"\n\"Kate proclaimed herself responsible to no one save herself.\" She professed to be a medium of spiritualism, and delivered lectures on that subject. In her lectures she publicly declared that murder might be a dictation for good; that in what the world might deem villiany, her soul might read bravery, nobility, and humanity.  She advocated \"free love,\" and denounced all social regulations for the promotion of purity and the prevention of carnality, which she called \"miserable requirements of self-constituted society.\" She maintained carnal relations with her brother, and boldly proclaimed her right to do so, in the following words found in her lecture manuscript: \"Shall we confine ourselves to a single love, and deny our natures their proper sway?.....Even though it be a brother's passion for his own sister, I say it should not be smothered.\" <ref>The Criminal Classes, by D.R. Miller, D.D. Published in 1903</ref>\n\n==Deaths and disappearances==\nIn May 1871, the body of a man named Jones, who had his skull crushed and his throat cut, was discovered in Drum Creek. The owner of the Drum Creek claim was suspected, but no action was taken. In February 1872, the bodies of two men were found who had the same injuries as Jones. By 1873, reports of missing people who had passed through the area had become so common that travelers began to avoid the trail.<ref name=\"leatherock\"/><ref name=\"legends\"/><ref name=\"flex\"/> \n\nThe area was already widely known for \"horse thieves and villains\", and [[vigilante|vigilance]] committees often \"arrested\" some for the disappearances, only for them to be later released by the authorities. Many innocent men under suspicion were also run out of the county by these committees.<ref name=\"KSC2\"/>\n\n==Downfall==\nIn the winter of 1872, George Newton Longcor and his infant daughter, Mary Ann, left [[Independence, Kansas|Independence]], Kansas, to resettle in [[Iowa]] and were never seen again. In the spring of 1873, Longcor's former neighbor, Dr. William Henry York, went looking for them and questioned homesteaders along the trail. Dr. York reached [[Fort Scott, Kansas|Fort Scott]], and on March 9 began the return journey to Independence but never arrived home.\n\nDr. York had two brothers: [[Colonel]] Ed York living in Fort Scott, and [[Alexander M. York]], a member of the [[Kansas State Senate]] from Independence who, in November 1872, had been instrumental in exposing [[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]] [[Samuel C. Pomeroy]]'s [[bribe]]ry of state legislators in his bid for re-election. Both knew of William's travel plans and, when he failed to return home, an all-out search began for the missing doctor. Colonel York, leading a company of some fifty men, questioned every traveler along the trail and visited all the area homesteads.\n\nOn March 28, 1873, Colonel York arrived at the Benders' [[Public house#Inns|inn]] with a Mr. Johnson, explaining to them that his brother had gone missing and asking if they had seen him. They admitted Dr. York had stayed with them and suggested the possibility that he had run into trouble with [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]]. Colonel York agreed that this was possible and remained for dinner.<ref name=\"leatherock\"/><ref name=\"flex\"/> On April 3, Colonel York returned to the inn with armed men after being informed that a woman had fled from the inn after being threatened with knives by Elvira Bender. Elvira allegedly could not understand English, while the younger Benders denied the claim.<ref name=\"KSC2\"/>\n\nWhen York repeated the claim, Elvira became enraged, said the woman was a witch who had cursed her coffee, and ordered the men to leave her house, revealing for the first time that \"her sense of the English language\" was much better than was let on. Before York left, Kate asked him to return alone the following Friday night, and she would use her [[Clairvoyance|clairvoyant]] abilities to help him find his brother. The men with York were convinced the Benders and a neighboring family, the Roaches, were guilty and wanted to hang them all, but York insisted that evidence must be found.<ref name=\"KSC2\"/><ref>According to one of the myths that has grown around the murders, after dinner, Colonel York was sitting in the front room when he noticed a gold [[locket]] under one of the beds. He opened it and was surprised to see images of his brother's wife and daughter. He slipped out and returned the next morning with the sheriff and several deputies, only to find that the Benders had fled. After a search of the Bender property, twelve mounds of earth were found among the trees and as many as two dozen bodies were reported to have been found.[http://www.prairieghosts.com/bender.html Bloody Benders: Mass Murderers Of Kansas<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181017181634/http://www.prairieghosts.com/bender.html |date=2018-10-17 }}</ref>\n\nAround the same time, neighboring communities began to make accusations that the Osage community was responsible for the disappearances, and a meeting was arranged by the Osage township in the Harmony Grove schoolhouse. The meeting was attended by 75 locals, including Colonel York and both John Bender&nbsp;Sr. and John Bender&nbsp;Jr. After discussing the disappearances, including that of William York, it was agreed that a search warrant would be obtained to search every homestead between Big Hill Creek and Drum Creek.<ref name=\"leatherock\"/><ref name=\"legends\"/><ref name=\"flex\"/> Despite York's strong suspicions regarding the Benders since his visit several weeks earlier, no one had watched them, and it was not noticed for several days that they had fled.<ref name=\"KSC2\"/>\n\n[[File:Bender Inn.jpg|thumb|Bender Inn the day after the gravedigging began]]\nThree days after the township meeting, Billy Tole was driving cattle past the Bender property when he noticed that the inn was abandoned and the farm animals were unfed. Tole reported the fact to the township trustee, but because of inclement weather, several days lapsed before the abandonment could be investigated. The township trustee called for volunteers, and several hundred turned out to form a search party that included Colonel York. When the party arrived at the inn they found the cabin empty of food, clothing, and personal possessions.<ref name=\"KSC1\"/>\n\nA bad odor was noticed and traced to a trap door underneath a bed, nailed shut. After opening the trap, the empty room beneath, {{convert|6|ft|m}} deep and {{convert|7|ft|m}} square at the top by {{convert|3|ft|m|1}} square at the bottom, was found to have clotted blood on the floor. The stone slab floor was broken up with sledgehammers but no bodies were found, and it was determined that the smell was from blood that had soaked into the soil. The men then physically lifted the cabin and moved it to the side so they could dig under it, but no bodies were found.<ref name=\"KSC1\"/>\n\nThey then began to probe the ground around the cabin with a metal rod, especially in the disturbed soil of the vegetable garden and orchard, where Dr. York's body was found later that evening, buried face down with his feet barely below the surface. The probing continued until midnight, with another nine suspected grave sites marked before the men were satisfied they had found them all and retired for the night. Digging resumed the following morning; another eight bodies were found in seven of the nine suspected graves, while one was found in the well, along with a number of body parts. All but one had had their heads bashed with a hammer and their throats cut, and it was reported in newspapers that all had been \"indecently mutilated\". The body of a young girl was found with no injuries sufficient to cause death. It was speculated that she had been strangled or buried alive.<ref name=\"KSC1\">[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015484/1873-05-15/ed-1/seq-2/ Devilish Deeds] Scanned page of The Weekly Kansas chief.

Kansas State Historical Society; Topeka, KS.</ref>\n\nA Kansas newspaper reported that the crowd was so incensed after finding the bodies that a friend of the Benders named Brockman, who was among the onlookers, was hung from a beam in the inn until unconscious, revived and interrogated as to what he knew, then hanged again. After the third hanging, they released him and he staggered home \"as one who was drunken or deranged\".<ref name=\"gen\">[http://genealogytrails.com/kan/montgomery/newsarticles1.html Sheriff Saves the Neck of a Man Who Murdered His Own Daughter] (copy of Inter Ocean newspaper November 18, 1896)</ref> A [[Roman Catholic]] prayer book was found in the house with notes inside written in German, which were later translated.

The Bender cabin was destroyed by souvenir hunters who took everything, including the bricks that lined the cellar and the stones lining the well.<ref name=\"leatherock\"/><ref name=\"legends\"/>\n\nState Senator Alexander York offered a $1,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1,000|1873}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) reward for the Bender family's arrest. On May 17, Kansas Governor [[Thomas A. Osborn]] offered a $2,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2000|1873}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) reward for the apprehension of all four.\n\n==Killing method==\nIt is conjectured{{By whom|date=July 2019}} that when a guest would stay at the Benders' bed and breakfast inn, the hosts would give the guest a seat of honor at the table which was positioned over a [[trap door]] that led into the cellar. With the victim's back to the curtain Kate would distract the guest, while John Bender or his son would come from behind the curtain and strike the guest on the right side of the skull with a hammer. The victim's throat was cut by one of the women to ensure death. The body was then dropped through the trap door. Once in the cellar, the body would be stripped and later buried somewhere on the property, often in the orchard.<ref name=\"leatherock\"/><ref name=\"legends\"/>  Although some of the victims had been quite wealthy, others had been carrying little of value on them, and it was surmised that the Benders had killed them simply for the sheer thrill.<ref name=\"legends\"/>\n\nTestimony from people who had stayed at the Benders' inn and had managed to escape before they could be killed appeared to support the presumed execution method of the Benders. William Pickering said that when he had refused to sit near the wagon cloth because of the stains on it, he was threatened with a knife by Kate Bender, whereupon he fled the premises. A Catholic priest claimed to have seen one of the Bender men concealing a large hammer, at which point he became uncomfortable and quickly departed.<ref name=\"legends\"/> \n\nTwo men who had traveled to the inn to experience Kate Bender's psychic powers stayed on for dinner but had refused to sit at the table next to the cloth, instead preferring to eat their meal at the main shop counter. Kate then became abusive toward them, and a short while later the two Bender men emerged from behind the cloth. At this point, the customers began to feel uneasy and decided to leave, a move that almost certainly saved their lives.<ref>http://www.murderbygaslight.com/2010/11/bloody-benders.html</ref>\n\nMore than a dozen bullet holes were found in the roof and sides of the cabin. The media speculated that some of the victims had attempted to fight back after being hit with the hammer.<ref name=\"KSC2\">[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015484/1873-05-22/ed-1/seq-2/ The Devils Kitchen] Scanned page of The Weekly Kansas chief.

It was confirmed that in Thayer the family had bought tickets on the Leavenworth, Lawrence & Galveston Railroad for [[Humboldt, Kansas|Humboldt]]. At [[Chanute, Kansas|Chanute]], John&nbsp;Jr. and Kate left the train and caught the [[Missouri\u2013Kansas\u2013Texas Railroad|MK&T]] train south to the terminus in [[Red River County, Texas|Red River County]] near [[Denison, Texas]]. From there they traveled to an outlaw colony thought to be in the border region between Texas and New Mexico. They were not pursued, as lawmen following outlaws into this region often never returned.<ref name=\"leatherock\"/> \n\nOne detective later claimed that he had traced the pair to the border, where he had found that John&nbsp;Jr. had died of [[apoplexy]].<ref name=\"legends\"/> Ma and Pa Bender did not leave the train at Humboldt but instead continued north to [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], where it is believed they purchased tickets for [[St. Louis, Missouri]].<ref name=\"leatherock\"/>\n\nSeveral groups of [[vigilante]]s were formed to search for the Benders. Many stories say that one vigilante group actually caught the Benders and shot all of them but Kate, whom they burned alive. Another group claimed they had caught the Benders and lynched them before throwing their bodies into the [[Verdigris River]]. Yet another claimed to have killed the Benders during a gunfight and buried their bodies on the prairie. No one ever claimed the $3,000 reward (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|3000|1873}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}), however.\n\nThe story of the Benders' escape spread, and the search continued on and off for the next fifty years. Often, two women traveling together were accused of being Kate Bender and her mother.<ref>[http://mrparallel.wordpress.com/category/the-bender-family/ The Bender family]</ref>\n\nIn 1884, it was reported that John Flickinger had committed suicide in [[Lake Michigan]].<ref name=\"flex\"/> Also in 1884, an elderly man matching Pa Bender's description was arrested in [[Montana]] for a murder committed near [[Salmon, Idaho]], where the victim had been killed by a hammer blow to the head. A message requesting positive identification was sent to Cherryvale, but the suspect severed his foot to escape his leg irons and bled to death. By the time a deputy from Cherryvale arrived, identification was impossible due to decomposition. Despite the lack of identification, the man's skull was displayed as that of \"Pa Bender\" in a Salmon saloon until [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] forced its closure in 1920 and the skull disappeared.<ref name=\"Newton\"/> Whether John Flickinger was really John Bender is unknown.\n\n==Arrests==\nSeveral weeks after the discovery of the bodies, Addison Roach and his son-in-law, William Buxton, were arrested as accessories. In total twelve men \"of bad repute in general\" would be arrested, including Brockman. All had been involved in disposing of the victims' stolen goods with Mit Cherry, a member of the vigilance committee, implicated for forging a letter from one of the victims, informing the man's wife that he had arrived safely at his destination in [[Illinois]].<ref name=\"KSC1\" /> Brockman would be arrested again twenty-three years later for the rape and murder of his own 18-year-old daughter.<ref name=\"gen\" />\n\nOn October 31, 1889, it was reported that a Mrs. Almira Monroe (aka Mrs. Almira Griffith) and Mrs. Sarah Eliza Davis had been arrested in [[Niles, Michigan]] (often misreported as [[Detroit]]) several weeks earlier for larceny. They were released after being found not guilty but were then immediately re-arrested for the Bender murders. According to the ''[[Pittsburgh Dispatch]]'', the daughter of one of the Benders' victims, Mrs. Frances E. McCann, had reported the pair to authorities in early October after tracking them down. Mrs. McCann's story came from dreams that she had about her father's murder, which she discussed with Sarah Eliza. The women's identities were later confirmed by two Osage township witnesses from a [[tintype]] photograph. In mid-October, Deputy Sheriff LeRoy Dick, the Osage Township trustee who had headed the search of the Bender property, arrived in Michigan and arrested the couple on October 30, following their release on the larceny charges. Mrs. Monroe resisted, declaring that she would not be taken alive, but was subdued by local deputies.\n\nMrs. Davis claimed that Mrs. Monroe was Ma Bender but that she herself was not Kate, but her sister Sara; she later signed an [[affidavit]] to that effect, while Monroe continued to deny the identification and in turn accused Sarah Eliza of being the real Kate Bender. Deputy Sheriff Dick, along with Mrs. McCann, escorted the pair to [[Oswego, Kansas]], where seven members of a 13-member panel confirmed the identification and committed them for trial. Another of Mrs. Monroe's daughters, Mary Gardei, later provided an affidavit claiming that her mother (then Almira Shearer), under the name of Almira Marks, was actually serving two years in the [[Detroit House of Corrections]] in 1872 for the manslaughter of her daughter-in-law, Emily Mark. Records of the incarceration back up this affidavit. At her hearing, Mrs. Monroe denied any knowledge of Shearer or the manslaughter charge and remained incarcerated with her daughter. Originally scheduled for February 1890, the trial was held over to May. Mrs. Monroe now admitted she had married a Mr. Shearer in 1872 and claimed she had previously denied it as she did not want the court to know that her name was Shearer at that time and that she had a conviction for manslaughter. Their attorney also produced a marriage certificate indicating that Mrs. Davis had been married in Michigan in 1872, the time when several of the murders were committed. Eyewitness testimony was given that Mrs. Monroe was Ma Bender. Judge Calvin dismissed Mary Gardei's affidavit as she was a \"chip off the old block\"; he found that other affidavits supporting Gardei's were sufficient proof that the women could never be convicted, however, and he discharged them both. The affidavits and other papers are missing from the file in LaBette County, so further examination is impossible. A number of researchers question the ready acceptance of the affidavit's authenticity and suggest that the county was unwilling to accept the expense of boarding the two women for an extended period. While the two women were certainly criminals and liars, as their own defense attorney admitted, the charges were weak, and many people doubted their identification as the Benders.<ref name=\"leatherock\"/><ref name=\"Newton\">Michael Newton ''The Encyclopedia of Unsolved Crimes'' [[Infobase Publishing]] 2004 Pg 33 - 35  {{ISBN|0-8160-4981-5}}</ref><ref>[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024546/1889-11-01/ed-1/seq-5/ Keeping a Secret] Scan of [[Pittsburgh Dispatch]] November 1, 1889 Pg 5 [[Library of Congress]]</ref><ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1890/01/12/103223709.pdf Scan of ''[[The New York Times]]'' January 12, 1890 pdf]</ref><ref>[http://mrparallel.wordpress.com/2010/03/25/in-dreams-begin-irresponsibilities/#more-8583 Scan of Chicago Daily Tribune, October 31, 1889]</ref><ref>Laurence J.

According to the 1870 census, George and his wife, Mary Jane, were neighbors of [[Charles Ingalls|Charles Ingalls and family]] in [[Independence, Kansas|Independence]], while his wife's parents lived two houses away. Following the deaths of his infant son, Robert, from [[pneumonia]] in May 1871 and his 21-year-old wife, Mary Jane (n\u00e9e Gilmore), following the birth of Mary Ann several months later, George was likely returning to the home of his parents, Anthony and Mary (Hughes) Longcor, in [[Lee County, Iowa]].

These hammers were given to the Bender Museum in 1967 by the son of LeRoy Dick, the Osage Township trustee who headed the search of the Bender property.<ref name=\"Potter\" /> The hammers were displayed at the Bender Museum in [[Cherryvale, Kansas]] from 1967 to 1978, when the site was acquired for a fire station. When attempts were made to relocate the museum it became a point of controversy, some locals objecting to the town being known for the Bender murders. The Bender artifacts were eventually given to the Cherryvale Museum, where they remain in a wall-mounted display case.<ref name=\"leatherock\"/><ref name=\"legends\"/> A knife with a four-inch tapered blade was reportedly found hidden in a mantel clock in the Bender house by Colonel York.

The family consisted of John Bender and his wife, Elvira, their son, John&nbsp;Jr., and daughter, Kate. While Bender mythology holds that John&nbsp;Jr. and Kate were siblings, contemporary newspapers reported that several of the Benders' neighbors had stated that they claimed to be married, possibly a [[common law marriage]].\n\nWhile there is no definitive number, estimates report that the Benders killed at least a dozen travelers before their crimes were discovered and the family fled, with their fate uncertain. Much folklore and legend surrounds the Benders, making it difficult to separate fact from fiction.\n\n==Background==\nIn October 1870, five families of [[Spiritualism|spiritualists]] [[Homestead Act|homesteaded]] in and around the [[township]] of Osage in northwestern Labette County, approximately {{convert|7|mi|km|abbr=on}} northeast of where [[Cherryvale, Kansas|Cherryvale]] would be established seven months later. One of the families was John Bender&nbsp;Sr. and John Bender&nbsp;Jr., who registered {{convert|160|acre|ha}} of land located adjacent to the [[Great Osage Trail]], which was then the only open road for traveling further west. After a cabin, a barn with corral, and a well were built, in the [[Autumn|fall]] of 1871, Elvira Bender and daughter Kate arrived, and the cabin was divided into two rooms by a canvas [[curtain|wagon-cover]]. The Benders used the smaller room at the rear for living quarters, while the front room was converted into a \"[[general store]]\" where a few dry goods were sold. The front section also contained the kitchen and dining table, where travelers could stop for a meal or even spend the night. Elvira and Kate Bender also planted a {{convert|2|acre|ha|adj=on}} vegetable garden and apple orchard north of the cabin.<ref name=\"leatherock\">[http://www.leatherockhotel.com/BloodyBenders.htm Bloody Bender Family 1871-1873]</ref><ref name=\"legends\">[http://www.legendsofamerica.com/ks-benders.html The Bloody Benders of Labette County] Legends of America A Travel Site for the Nostalgic & Historic Minded</ref><ref name=\"flex\">[http://www.flexassistant.com/images/Benders.pdf Malice, Madness, and Mayhem: an Eclectic Collection of American Infamy pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711005803/http://www.flexassistant.com/images/Benders.pdf |date=2011-07-11 }} The Bloody Benders</ref>\n\n==Bender family==\nJohn Bender, Sr. was around sixty years old and spoke very little English. When he did speak it, it was so [[guttural]] that it was usually unintelligible. According to the May 23, 1873 edition of ''The Emporia News'', he was identified with the name of William Bender. Elvira Bender, who also allegedly spoke very little English, was 55 years of age and was so unfriendly that her neighbors took to calling her a \"she-devil\". \n\nJohn Bender&nbsp;Jr. was around 25 years old, handsome with auburn hair and a mustache, and spoke English fluently but with a [[Germany|German]] accent. John was prone to laughing aimlessly, which led many to consider him a \"half-wit\". Kate Bender, who was around 23, was cultivated and attractive and spoke English well with very little accent. A self-proclaimed healer and psychic, she distributed flyers advertising her supernatural powers and her ability to cure illnesses. She also conducted [[s\u00e9ance]]s and gave lectures on spiritualism, for which she gained notoriety for advocating [[free love]]. Kate's popularity became a large attraction for the Benders' inn. Although the elder Benders kept to themselves, Kate and her brother regularly attended Sunday school in nearby Harmony Grove.\n\nThe Benders were widely believed to be German immigrants. No documentation or definitive proof of their relationships to one another, or where they were born, has ever been found. John Bender, Sr. was from either Germany or the [[Netherlands]] and is thought by some{{By whom|date=July 2019}} to have been born John Flickinger. According to contemporary newspapers, Elvira was born Almira Hill Mark (often misreported as \"Meik\") in the [[Adirondack Mountains]]; she married Simon Mark, with whom she claimed to have had 12 children. Later, she married William Stephen Griffith. Elvira was suspected{{By whom|date=July 2019}} of murdering several husbands, but none of these rumors were ever proven. Kate was believed{{By whom|date=July 2019}} to be Elvira's fifth daughter. Some of the Benders' neighbors claimed that John and Kate were not brother and sister, but actually husband and wife.\n\n==Deaths and disappearances==\nIn May 1871, the body of a man named Jones, who had his skull crushed and his throat cut, was discovered in Drum Creek. The owner of the Drum Creek claim was suspected, but no action was taken. In February 1872, the bodies of two men were found who had the same injuries as Jones. By 1873, reports of missing people who had passed through the area had become so common that travelers began to avoid the trail.<ref name=\"leatherock\"/><ref name=\"legends\"/><ref name=\"flex\"/> \n\nThe area was already widely known for \"horse thieves and villains\", and [[vigilante|vigilance]] committees often \"arrested\" some for the disappearances, only for them to be later released by the authorities. Many innocent men under suspicion were also run out of the county by these committees.<ref name=\"KSC2\"/>\n\n==Downfall==\nIn the winter of 1872, George Newton Longcor and his infant daughter, Mary Ann, left [[Independence, Kansas|Independence]], Kansas, to resettle in [[Iowa]] and were never seen again. In the spring of 1873, Longcor's former neighbor, Dr. William Henry York, went looking for them and questioned homesteaders along the trail. Dr. York reached [[Fort Scott, Kansas|Fort Scott]], and on March 9 began the return journey to Independence but never arrived home.\n\nDr. York had two brothers: [[Colonel]] Ed York living in Fort Scott, and [[Alexander M. York]], a member of the [[Kansas State Senate]] from Independence who, in November 1872, had been instrumental in exposing [[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]] [[Samuel C. Pomeroy]]'s [[bribe]]ry of state legislators in his bid for re-election. Both knew of William's travel plans and, when he failed to return home, an all-out search began for the missing doctor. Colonel York, leading a company of some fifty men, questioned every traveler along the trail and visited all the area homesteads.\n\nOn March 28, 1873, Colonel York arrived at the Benders' [[Public house#Inns|inn]] with a Mr. Johnson, explaining to them that his brother had gone missing and asking if they had seen him. They admitted Dr. York had stayed with them and suggested the possibility that he had run into trouble with [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]]. Colonel York agreed that this was possible and remained for dinner.<ref name=\"leatherock\"/><ref name=\"flex\"/> On April 3, Colonel York returned to the inn with armed men after being informed that a woman had fled from the inn after being threatened with knives by Elvira Bender. Elvira allegedly could not understand English, while the younger Benders denied the claim.<ref name=\"KSC2\"/>\n\nWhen York repeated the claim, Elvira became enraged, said the woman was a witch who had cursed her coffee, and ordered the men to leave her house, revealing for the first time that \"her sense of the English language\" was much better than was let on. Before York left, Kate asked him to return alone the following Friday night, and she would use her [[Clairvoyance|clairvoyant]] abilities to help him find his brother. The men with York were convinced the Benders and a neighboring family, the Roaches, were guilty and wanted to hang them all, but York insisted that evidence must be found.<ref name=\"KSC2\"/><ref>According to one of the myths that has grown around the murders, after dinner, Colonel York was sitting in the front room when he noticed a gold [[locket]] under one of the beds. He opened it and was surprised to see images of his brother's wife and daughter. He slipped out and returned the next morning with the sheriff and several deputies, only to find that the Benders had fled. After a search of the Bender property, twelve mounds of earth were found among the trees and as many as two dozen bodies were reported to have been found.[http://www.prairieghosts.com/bender.html Bloody Benders: Mass Murderers Of Kansas<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181017181634/http://www.prairieghosts.com/bender.html |date=2018-10-17 }}</ref>\n\nAround the same time, neighboring communities began to make accusations that the Osage community was responsible for the disappearances, and a meeting was arranged by the Osage township in the Harmony Grove schoolhouse. The meeting was attended by 75 locals, including Colonel York and both John Bender&nbsp;Sr. and John Bender&nbsp;Jr. After discussing the disappearances, including that of William York, it was agreed that a search warrant would be obtained to search every homestead between Big Hill Creek and Drum Creek.<ref name=\"leatherock\"/><ref name=\"legends\"/><ref name=\"flex\"/> Despite York's strong suspicions regarding the Benders since his visit several weeks earlier, no one had watched them, and it was not noticed for several days that they had fled.<ref name=\"KSC2\"/>\n\n[[File:Bender Inn.jpg|thumb|Bender Inn the day after the gravedigging began]]\nThree days after the township meeting, Billy Tole was driving cattle past the Bender property when he noticed that the inn was abandoned and the farm animals were unfed. Tole reported the fact to the township trustee, but because of inclement weather, several days lapsed before the abandonment could be investigated. The township trustee called for volunteers, and several hundred turned out to form a search party that included Colonel York. When the party arrived at the inn they found the cabin empty of food, clothing, and personal possessions.<ref name=\"KSC1\"/>\n\nA bad odor was noticed and traced to a trap door underneath a bed, nailed shut. After opening the trap, the empty room beneath, {{convert|6|ft|m}} deep and {{convert|7|ft|m}} square at the top by {{convert|3|ft|m|1}} square at the bottom, was found to have clotted blood on the floor. The stone slab floor was broken up with sledgehammers but no bodies were found, and it was determined that the smell was from blood that had soaked into the soil. The men then physically lifted the cabin and moved it to the side so they could dig under it, but no bodies were found.<ref name=\"KSC1\"/>\n\nThey then began to probe the ground around the cabin with a metal rod, especially in the disturbed soil of the vegetable garden and orchard, where Dr. York's body was found later that evening, buried face down with his feet barely below the surface. The probing continued until midnight, with another nine suspected grave sites marked before the men were satisfied they had found them all and retired for the night. Digging resumed the following morning; another eight bodies were found in seven of the nine suspected graves, while one was found in the well, along with a number of body parts. All but one had had their heads bashed with a hammer and their throats cut, and it was reported in newspapers that all had been \"indecently mutilated\". The body of a young girl was found with no injuries sufficient to cause death. It was speculated that she had been strangled or buried alive.<ref name=\"KSC1\">[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015484/1873-05-15/ed-1/seq-2/ Devilish Deeds] Scanned page of The Weekly Kansas chief.

After the third hanging, they released him and he staggered home \"as one who was drunken or deranged\".<ref name=\"gen\">[http://genealogytrails.com/kan/montgomery/newsarticles1.html Sheriff Saves the Neck of a Man Who Murdered His Own Daughter] (copy of Inter Ocean newspaper November 18, 1896)</ref> A [[Roman Catholic]] prayer book was found in the house with notes inside written in German, which were later translated. The texts read \"Johannah Bender. Born July 30, 1848,\" \"John Gebhardt came to America on July 1 18??,\" \"big slaughter day, Jan eighth\", and \"hell departed.\"<ref name=\"KSC1\"/>\n\nWord of the murders spread quickly, and more than three thousand people, including reporters from as far away as [[New York City]] and [[Chicago]], visited the site. The Bender cabin was destroyed by souvenir hunters who took everything, including the bricks that lined the cellar and the stones lining the well.<ref name=\"leatherock\"/><ref name=\"legends\"/>\n\nState Senator Alexander York offered a $1,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1,000|1873}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) reward for the Bender family's arrest. On May 17, Kansas Governor [[Thomas A. Osborn]] offered a $2,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2000|1873}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) reward for the apprehension of all four.\n\n==Killing method==\nIt is conjectured{{By whom|date=July 2019}} that when a guest would stay at the Benders' bed and breakfast inn, the hosts would give the guest a seat of honor at the table which was positioned over a [[trap door]] that led into the cellar. With the victim's back to the curtain Kate would distract the guest, while John Bender or his son would come from behind the curtain and strike the guest on the right side of the skull with a hammer. The victim's throat was cut by one of the women to ensure death. The body was then dropped through the trap door. Once in the cellar, the body would be stripped and later buried somewhere on the property, often in the orchard.<ref name=\"leatherock\"/><ref name=\"legends\"/>  Although some of the victims had been quite wealthy, others had been carrying little of value on them, and it was surmised that the Benders had killed them simply for the sheer thrill.<ref name=\"legends\"/>\n\nTestimony from people who had stayed at the Benders' inn and had managed to escape before they could be killed appeared to support the presumed execution method of the Benders. William Pickering said that when he had refused to sit near the wagon cloth because of the stains on it, he was threatened with a knife by Kate Bender, whereupon he fled the premises. A Catholic priest claimed to have seen one of the Bender men concealing a large hammer, at which point he became uncomfortable and quickly departed.<ref name=\"legends\"/> \n\nTwo men who had traveled to the inn to experience Kate Bender's psychic powers stayed on for dinner but had refused to sit at the table next to the cloth, instead preferring to eat their meal at the main shop counter. Kate then became abusive toward them, and a short while later the two Bender men emerged from behind the cloth. At this point, the customers began to feel uneasy and decided to leave, a move that almost certainly saved their lives.<ref>http://www.murderbygaslight.com/2010/11/bloody-benders.html</ref>\n\nMore than a dozen bullet holes were found in the roof and sides of the cabin. The media speculated that some of the victims had attempted to fight back after being hit with the hammer.<ref name=\"KSC2\">[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015484/1873-05-22/ed-1/seq-2/ The Devils Kitchen] Scanned page of The Weekly Kansas chief.

It was confirmed that in Thayer the family had bought tickets on the Leavenworth, Lawrence & Galveston Railroad for [[Humboldt, Kansas|Humboldt]]. At [[Chanute, Kansas|Chanute]], John&nbsp;Jr. and Kate left the train and caught the [[Missouri\u2013Kansas\u2013Texas Railroad|MK&T]] train south to the terminus in [[Red River County, Texas|Red River County]] near [[Denison, Texas]]. From there they traveled to an outlaw colony thought to be in the border region between Texas and New Mexico. They were not pursued, as lawmen following outlaws into this region often never returned.<ref name=\"leatherock\"/> \n\nOne detective later claimed that he had traced the pair to the border, where he had found that John&nbsp;Jr. had died of [[apoplexy]].<ref name=\"legends\"/> Ma and Pa Bender did not leave the train at Humboldt but instead continued north to [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], where it is believed they purchased tickets for [[St. Louis, Missouri]].<ref name=\"leatherock\"/>\n\nSeveral groups of [[vigilante]]s were formed to search for the Benders. Many stories say that one vigilante group actually caught the Benders and shot all of them but Kate, whom they burned alive. Another group claimed they had caught the Benders and lynched them before throwing their bodies into the [[Verdigris River]]. Yet another claimed to have killed the Benders during a gunfight and buried their bodies on the prairie. No one ever claimed the $3,000 reward (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|3000|1873}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}), however.\n\nThe story of the Benders' escape spread, and the search continued on and off for the next fifty years. Often, two women traveling together were accused of being Kate Bender and her mother.<ref>[http://mrparallel.wordpress.com/category/the-bender-family/ The Bender family]</ref>\n\nIn 1884, it was reported that John Flickinger had committed suicide in [[Lake Michigan]].<ref name=\"flex\"/> Also in 1884, an elderly man matching Pa Bender's description was arrested in [[Montana]] for a murder committed near [[Salmon, Idaho]], where the victim had been killed by a hammer blow to the head. A message requesting positive identification was sent to Cherryvale, but the suspect severed his foot to escape his leg irons and bled to death. By the time a deputy from Cherryvale arrived, identification was impossible due to decomposition. Despite the lack of identification, the man's skull was displayed as that of \"Pa Bender\" in a Salmon saloon until [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] forced its closure in 1920 and the skull disappeared.<ref name=\"Newton\"/> Whether John Flickinger was really John Bender is unknown.\n\n==Arrests==\nSeveral weeks after the discovery of the bodies, Addison Roach and his son-in-law, William Buxton, were arrested as accessories. In total twelve men \"of bad repute in general\" would be arrested, including Brockman. All had been involved in disposing of the victims' stolen goods with Mit Cherry, a member of the vigilance committee, implicated for forging a letter from one of the victims, informing the man's wife that he had arrived safely at his destination in [[Illinois]].<ref name=\"KSC1\" /> Brockman would be arrested again twenty-three years later for the rape and murder of his own 18-year-old daughter.<ref name=\"gen\" />\n\nOn October 31, 1889, it was reported that a Mrs. Almira Monroe (aka Mrs. Almira Griffith) and Mrs. Sarah Eliza Davis had been arrested in [[Niles, Michigan]] (often misreported as [[Detroit]]) several weeks earlier for larceny. They were released after being found not guilty but were then immediately re-arrested for the Bender murders. According to the ''[[Pittsburgh Dispatch]]'', the daughter of one of the Benders' victims, Mrs. Frances E. McCann, had reported the pair to authorities in early October after tracking them down. Mrs. McCann's story came from dreams that she had about her father's murder, which she discussed with Sarah Eliza. The women's identities were later confirmed by two Osage township witnesses from a [[tintype]] photograph. In mid-October, Deputy Sheriff LeRoy Dick, the Osage Township trustee who had headed the search of the Bender property, arrived in Michigan and arrested the couple on October 30, following their release on the larceny charges. Mrs. Monroe resisted, declaring that she would not be taken alive, but was subdued by local deputies.\n\nMrs. Davis claimed that Mrs. Monroe was Ma Bender but that she herself was not Kate, but her sister Sara; she later signed an [[affidavit]] to that effect, while Monroe continued to deny the identification and in turn accused Sarah Eliza of being the real Kate Bender. Deputy Sheriff Dick, along with Mrs. McCann, escorted the pair to [[Oswego, Kansas]], where seven members of a 13-member panel confirmed the identification and committed them for trial. Another of Mrs. Monroe's daughters, Mary Gardei, later provided an affidavit claiming that her mother (then Almira Shearer), under the name of Almira Marks, was actually serving two years in the [[Detroit House of Corrections]] in 1872 for the manslaughter of her daughter-in-law, Emily Mark. Records of the incarceration back up this affidavit. At her hearing, Mrs. Monroe denied any knowledge of Shearer or the manslaughter charge and remained incarcerated with her daughter. Originally scheduled for February 1890, the trial was held over to May. Mrs. Monroe now admitted she had married a Mr. Shearer in 1872 and claimed she had previously denied it as she did not want the court to know that her name was Shearer at that time and that she had a conviction for manslaughter. Their attorney also produced a marriage certificate indicating that Mrs. Davis had been married in Michigan in 1872, the time when several of the murders were committed. Eyewitness testimony was given that Mrs. Monroe was Ma Bender. Judge Calvin dismissed Mary Gardei's affidavit as she was a \"chip off the old block\"; he found that other affidavits supporting Gardei's were sufficient proof that the women could never be convicted, however, and he discharged them both. The affidavits and other papers are missing from the file in LaBette County, so further examination is impossible. A number of researchers question the ready acceptance of the affidavit's authenticity and suggest that the county was unwilling to accept the expense of boarding the two women for an extended period. While the two women were certainly criminals and liars, as their own defense attorney admitted, the charges were weak, and many people doubted their identification as the Benders.<ref name=\"leatherock\"/><ref name=\"Newton\">Michael Newton ''The Encyclopedia of Unsolved Crimes'' [[Infobase Publishing]] 2004 Pg 33 - 35  {{ISBN|0-8160-4981-5}}</ref><ref>[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024546/1889-11-01/ed-1/seq-5/ Keeping a Secret] Scan of [[Pittsburgh Dispatch]] November 1, 1889 Pg 5 [[Library of Congress]]</ref><ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1890/01/12/103223709.pdf Scan of ''[[The New York Times]]'' January 12, 1890 pdf]</ref><ref>[http://mrparallel.wordpress.com/2010/03/25/in-dreams-begin-irresponsibilities/#more-8583 Scan of Chicago Daily Tribune, October 31, 1889]</ref><ref>Laurence J.

Longcor\" or \"George Loncher\", while Mary Ann is similarly reported as being either eight years old or 18 months old. According to the 1870 census, George and his wife, Mary Jane, were neighbors of [[Charles Ingalls|Charles Ingalls and family]] in [[Independence, Kansas|Independence]], while his wife's parents lived two houses away. Following the deaths of his infant son, Robert, from [[pneumonia]] in May 1871 and his 21-year-old wife, Mary Jane (n\u00e9e Gilmore), following the birth of Mary Ann several months later, George was likely returning to the home of his parents, Anthony and Mary (Hughes) Longcor, in [[Lee County, Iowa]].  In preparation for his return to Iowa, George had purchased a team of horses from his neighbor, Dr. William Henry York, who later went looking for George and was also murdered; both were veterans of the Civil War. $1,900 ({{CURRENTYEAR}}:  ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1900|1872}}}}) missing. The daughter was thought to have been buried alive, but this was not proven. No injuries were found on her body, and she was fully clothed, including mittens and hood.

These hammers were given to the Bender Museum in 1967 by the son of LeRoy Dick, the Osage Township trustee who headed the search of the Bender property.<ref name=\"Potter\" /> The hammers were displayed at the Bender Museum in [[Cherryvale, Kansas]] from 1967 to 1978, when the site was acquired for a fire station. When attempts were made to relocate the museum it became a point of controversy, some locals objecting to the town being known for the Bender murders. The Bender artifacts were eventually given to the Cherryvale Museum, where they remain in a wall-mounted display case.<ref name=\"leatherock\"/><ref name=\"legends\"/> A knife with a four-inch tapered blade was reportedly found hidden in a mantel clock in the Bender house by Colonel York.

The flag was first used as an ensign for Russian merchant ships and became official as the flag of the [[Tsardom of Russia]] in 1696. It remained in use until 1858, when the first official flag of the [[Russian Empire]] was decreed by [[ Alexander II]], which was a tricolor consisting of three horizontal fields: [[black]] on the top, [[yellow]] in the middle, and [[white]] on the bottom. A decree in 1896 made the original white, blue, and red tricolor the official flag of the [[Russian Empire]] until its eventual capitulation in 1917. Following the creation of the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]] after the [[Russian Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]], the Russian tricolor was abolished, and its usage was preserved by the [[White Movement]] and the [[Russian state]] during the [[Russian Civil War]].\n\nDuring the [[Soviet Union]]'s existence, the Russian SFSR (a constituent republic of the USSR), used a defaced variant of the State [[Flag of the Soviet Union]] with a vertical blue bar at the hoist, with a golden [[hammer and sickle]] and a golden bordered [[red star]] on top. Prior to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], on November 1st, 1991, the Russian SFSR adopted a new flag design that looked almost identical to the pre-revolutionary tricolour that was previously abolished in 1917. The ratio of the new flag was 1:2, and the flag colors consisted of [[white]] on the top, [[azure]] in the middle, and [[scarlet]] on the bottom. The Russian SFSR officially renamed itself as the \"Russian Federation\" after the dissolution of the USSR, and the flag design remained the same until 1993, when the original Russian tricolour was fully restored as the current flag after the [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis]].\n\n== Origin ==\nTwo accounts of the flag's origin connect it to the [[Tricolor (flag)|tricolor]] used by the [[Dutch Republic]] (the [[flag of the Netherlands]]).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jt450XgGd1kC|title=The Flags of the World: Their History, Blazonry and Associations|last=Hulme|first=Frederick Edward|date=1 January 1897|publisher=Library of Alexandria|isbn=9781465543110|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xWdOBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA228|title=Foreign Correspondent: A Memoir|last=Greenway|first=H.

According to one source, the ship's Dutch lead engineer Butler faced the need for the flag, and issued a request to the [[Duma#In early Russian history|Boyar Duma]], to \"ask His Royal Majesty as to which (as is the custom among other nations) flag shall be raised on the ship\". The official response merely indicated that, as such issue is as yet unprecedented, even though the land forces do use (apparently different) flags, the tsar ordered that his (Butler's) opinion be sought about the matter, asking specifically as to the custom existing in his country.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=scHXHTkRmZcC&pg=PA21&dq=european+flag&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=hek3U5mTDcu7ygOF54D4Dg&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=dutch&f=false Flag T.H.

He was told to display the two-headed eagle spread with wings, with three crowns over it. On the chest of the eagle, a warrior on horseback was to be displayed with a spear, in a military harness. The same eagle was also to hold a sceptre with the right leg and an apple with a crest with the left.

The choice of colors is significant in that they represent in order of priority, white for God, Blue for king, and Red for people and/or country. These colors of the flag of Russia inspired the choice of the \"[[Pan-Slavic colours]]\" by the [[Prague Slavic Congress, 1848]]. Two other Slavic countries, [[Slovakia]] and [[Slovenia]], have flags similar to the Russian one, but with added coats-of-arms for differentiation. On 7 May 1883, the Russian flag was authorized to be used on land, and it became an official ''National flag'' before the coronation of Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] in 1896.\n\nThe flag continued to be used by the [[Russian Provisional Government]] after the [[Tsar of Russia|Tsar]] was toppled in the [[February Revolution]] and was not replaced until the [[October Revolution]] which established the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]].\n\n===Flags of the Russian SFSR===\n{{See also|Flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic}}\n[[File:Flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (1918\u20131937).svg|200px|thumb|{{FIAV|historical}} Flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (17 June 1918 \u2013 21 January 1937)]]\n[[File:Flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.svg|200px|thumb|{{FIAV|historical}} Flag of the Russian SFSR (1954\u201391)]]\n\nOn 8 April 1918, the flag of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] was discussed at a meeting of the [[Council of People's Commissars]] of the RSFSR. The Council proposed that the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]] create a red flag with the abbreviation for the phrase ''[[Workers of the world, unite!]]'' However, the proposal was not adopted. On 13 April 1918, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee established the RSFSR flag to be a red banner with the inscription ''Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic''. The text of the decree did not contain any clarification regarding the color, size and location of the inscription, or the width and length ratio of the cloth.\n\nOn 17 June 1918, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee approved a sample image of the flag of the RSFSR, developed on behalf of the [[People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs of the Russian SFSR]] by the graphic artist [[Sergey Chekhonin]]. The flag was a red rectangular panel, in the upper corner of which was placed the inscription ''RSFSR'' in gold letters stylized as Slavic. This inscription was separated from the rest of the cloth on both sides by gold stripes forming a rectangle.\n\nOn 30 December 1922, the RSFSR combined with the [[Ukrainian SSR]], [[Byelorussian SSR]], and [[Transcaucasian SFSR]] to form the [[Soviet Union]]. The national flag of the USSR was established on 18 April 1924, described in the Constitution of the USSR as a red or scarlet rectangular cloth with a 1:2 width to length ratio, with a gold sickle and hammer in the top corner next to the flagpole and a red five-pointed star framed with a golden border. This flag was carried by all ships of the USSR and diplomatic representations of the USSR. The 1:2 [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] was used, until replaced in 1954 with the universal design of the [[Flag of the Soviet Union|Soviet flag]] with a blue stripe along the mast.\n\nContrary to the belief that the USSR state flag outranked the flag of the RSFSR, the actual use of the USSR flag was limited. The USSR flag in Russia flew only over two buildings, that of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union and the Council of People's Commissars. That decision was adopted on 23 March 1925, also establishing that the flag of the RSFSR had to be raised constantly not only on the buildings of the Central Executive Committee and the Council of People's Commissars but also on the buildings of all local soviets, including village soviets and district soviets in cities. On holidays, the RSFSR flag had to be raised on many public buildings (such as schools, hospitals, and government offices).<ref>\u0421\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0443\u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0420\u0421\u0424\u0421\u0420.&nbsp;\u2014 1925, \u2116&nbsp;20, \u0446\u0438\u0442. \u043f\u043e: \u0412\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0438\u043b\u043b\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043f\u043e \u0444\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430\u043c \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0418\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420, \u0422.1/\u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442. \u0421\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432 \u0412. \u0410.&nbsp;\u2014 \u041c.: \u041c\u0413\u0418\u0423, 2002, {{ISBN|5-276-00240-1}}, \u0421\u0421.487\u2013488</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]] the white-blue-red tricolor has been used by the collaborationist [[Anti-communism|anti-Stalinist]] troops of [[Andrey Vlasov]], who was allied with [[Nazi Germany]] against the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>Lilia Shevtsova: ''Putin's Russia.''

It was never made the official state flag.\n\nWhen the [[Bolshevik]]s took power in 1917, the tricolor design was discarded, and a definitive new flag of the SFSR (one of the constituent republics of the [[Soviet Union]]) was introduced in 1954 (see [[flag of Russian SFSR]]), and this remained the republic's flag until the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991. All of the Soviet Republics' flags were created by introducing a small but noticeable change to the [[flag of the Soviet Union]]. For Russia, the change was an introduction of the left-hand blue band. The previous Soviet design was different, a plain red flag with different variants of the \"RSFSR\" abbreviation in the canton. Today, the Soviet flag is used by the supporters and members of the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]].\n\nThe tricolor was used by the anticommunist forces during the Civil War called the [[White movement]]. It was continued to be used by [[White \u00e9migr\u00e9s]] in various countries as the Russian flag. The tricolor was associated both in Soviet Russia as well as the Russian White emigre communities as symbolizing a traditional tsarist Orthodox Russia. It, as well as the naval ensign of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] was used by anticommunist Russian troops under German command during the [[Second World War]]. Both flags can be seen inside a few Orthodox churches in the West established by the Russian communities. In the Soviet Union, this flag was used in films set in the prerevolutionary period and was seen as an historical flag, especially after the 1940s.\n\nIt, rather than the black-yellow-white color combination, was readopted by Russia on 22 August 1991. That date is celebrated yearly as the national flag day.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe [[President of Russia]] uses a Presidential Standard ({{lang-ru|\u0428\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0442 \u041f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430}}), which, since 1994, is officially defined as the square tricolor with the coat of arms (in this case the two-headed eagle is depicted without the shield) in the middle.<ref>per [http://kremlin.ru/acts/bank/5502 Decree No. 319 of 15 February 1994]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Victory Day (9 May)|annual Victory Day]] celebrations in Moscow, a variant of the Soviet flag that was used during the [[raising a flag over the Reichstag]] has the grey hammer and sickle, referred to as the [[Victory Banner]].

The flag was first used as an ensign for Russian merchant ships and became official as the flag of the [[Tsardom of Russia]] in 1696. It remained in use until the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]] (RSFSR) fully occupied all Russian territories in 1922, as the flag was used by the [[white movement|White guard]] during the [[Russian Civil War]] which had started in 1917.\n\nDuring the [[Soviet Union]]'s existence, it used a [[Flag of the Soviet Union|flag]] with a [[Red flag (politics)|red field]] with a golden [[hammer and sickle]] and a golden bordered [[red star]] on top. With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the pre-revolutionary tricolour was re-introduced as the flag of the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] in 1991 in the 1:2 ratio.

According to one source, the ship's Dutch lead engineer Butler faced the need for the flag, and issued a request to the [[Duma#In early Russian history|Boyar Duma]], to \"ask His Royal Majesty as to which (as is the custom among other nations) flag shall be raised on the ship\". The official response merely indicated that, as such issue is as yet unprecedented, even though the land forces do use (apparently different) flags, the tsar ordered that his (Butler's) opinion be sought about the matter, asking specifically as to the custom existing in his country.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=scHXHTkRmZcC&pg=PA21&dq=european+flag&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=hek3U5mTDcu7ygOF54D4Dg&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=dutch&f=false Flag T.H.

The choice of colors is significant in that they represent in order of priority, white for God, Blue for king, and Red for people and/or country. These colors of the flag of Russia inspired the choice of the \"[[Pan-Slavic colours]]\" by the [[Prague Slavic Congress, 1848]]. Two other Slavic countries, [[Slovakia]] and [[Slovenia]], have flags similar to the Russian one, but with added coats-of-arms for differentiation. On 7 May 1883, the Russian flag was authorized to be used on land, and it became an official ''National flag'' before the coronation of Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] in 1896.\n\nThe flag continued to be used by the [[Russian Provisional Government]] after the [[Tsar of Russia|Tsar]] was toppled in the [[February Revolution]] and was not replaced until the [[October Revolution]] which established the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]].\n\n===Flags of the Russian SFSR===\n{{See also|Flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic}}\n[[File:Flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (1918\u20131937).svg|200px|thumb|{{FIAV|historical}} Flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (17 June 1918 \u2013 21 January 1937)]]\n[[File:Flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.svg|200px|thumb|{{FIAV|historical}} Flag of the Russian SFSR (1954\u201391)]]\n\nOn 8 April 1918, the flag of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] was discussed at a meeting of the [[Council of People's Commissars]] of the RSFSR. The Council proposed that the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]] create a red flag with the abbreviation for the phrase ''[[Workers of the world, unite!]]'' However, the proposal was not adopted. On 13 April 1918, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee established the RSFSR flag to be a red banner with the inscription ''Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic''. The text of the decree did not contain any clarification regarding the color, size and location of the inscription, or the width and length ratio of the cloth.\n\nOn 17 June 1918, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee approved a sample image of the flag of the RSFSR, developed on behalf of the [[People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs of the Russian SFSR]] by the graphic artist [[Sergey Chekhonin]]. The flag was a red rectangular panel, in the upper corner of which was placed the inscription ''RSFSR'' in gold letters stylized as Slavic. This inscription was separated from the rest of the cloth on both sides by gold stripes forming a rectangle.\n\nOn 30 December 1922, the RSFSR combined with the [[Ukrainian SSR]], [[Byelorussian SSR]], and [[Transcaucasian SFSR]] to form the [[Soviet Union]]. The national flag of the USSR was established on 18 April 1924, described in the Constitution of the USSR as a red or scarlet rectangular cloth with a 1:2 width to length ratio, with a gold sickle and hammer in the top corner next to the flagpole and a red five-pointed star framed with a golden border. This flag was carried by all ships of the USSR and diplomatic representations of the USSR. The 1:2 [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] was used, until replaced in 1954 with the universal design of the [[Flag of the Soviet Union|Soviet flag]] with a blue stripe along the mast.\n\nContrary to the belief that the USSR state flag outranked the flag of the RSFSR, the actual use of the USSR flag was limited. The USSR flag in Russia flew only over two buildings, that of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union and the Council of People's Commissars. That decision was adopted on 23 March 1925, also establishing that the flag of the RSFSR had to be raised constantly not only on the buildings of the Central Executive Committee and the Council of People's Commissars but also on the buildings of all local soviets, including village soviets and district soviets in cities. On holidays, the RSFSR flag had to be raised on many public buildings (such as schools, hospitals, and government offices).<ref>\u0421\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0443\u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0420\u0421\u0424\u0421\u0420.&nbsp;\u2014 1925, \u2116&nbsp;20, \u0446\u0438\u0442. \u043f\u043e: \u0412\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0438\u043b\u043b\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043f\u043e \u0444\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430\u043c \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0418\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420, \u0422.1/\u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442. \u0421\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432 \u0412. \u0410.&nbsp;\u2014 \u041c.: \u041c\u0413\u0418\u0423, 2002, {{ISBN|5-276-00240-1}}, \u0421\u0421.487\u2013488</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]] the white-blue-red tricolor has been used by the collaborationist [[Anti-communism|anti-Stalinist]] troops of [[Andrey Vlasov]], who was allied with [[Nazi Germany]] against the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>Lilia Shevtsova: ''Putin's Russia.''

It was never made the official state flag.\n\nWhen the [[Bolshevik]]s took power in 1917, the tricolor design was discarded, and a definitive new flag of the SFSR (one of the constituent republics of the [[Soviet Union]]) was introduced in 1954 (see [[flag of Russian SFSR]]), and this remained the republic's flag until the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991. All of the Soviet Republics' flags were created by introducing a small but noticeable change to the [[flag of the Soviet Union]]. For Russia, the change was an introduction of the left-hand blue band. The previous Soviet design was different, a plain red flag with different variants of the \"RSFSR\" abbreviation in the canton. Today, the Soviet flag is used by the supporters and members of the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]].\n\nThe tricolor was used by the anticommunist forces during the Civil War called the [[White movement]]. It was continued to be used by [[White \u00e9migr\u00e9s]] in various countries as the Russian flag. The tricolor was associated both in Soviet Russia as well as the Russian White emigre communities as symbolizing a traditional tsarist Orthodox Russia. It, as well as the naval ensign of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] was used by anticommunist Russian troops under German command during the [[Second World War]]. Both flags can be seen inside a few Orthodox churches in the West established by the Russian communities. In the Soviet Union, this flag was used in films set in the prerevolutionary period and was seen as an historical flag, especially after the 1940s.\n\nIt, rather than the black-yellow-white color combination, was readopted by Russia on 22 August 1991. That date is celebrated yearly as the national flag day.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe [[President of Russia]] uses a Presidential Standard ({{lang-ru|\u0428\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0442 \u041f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430}}), which, since 1994, is officially defined as the square tricolor with the coat of arms (in this case the two-headed eagle is depicted without the shield) in the middle.<ref>per [http://kremlin.ru/acts/bank/5502 Decree No. 319 of 15 February 1994]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Victory Day (9 May)|annual Victory Day]] celebrations in Moscow, a variant of the Soviet flag that was used during the [[raising a flag over the Reichstag]] has the grey hammer and sickle, referred to as the [[Victory Banner]].

The school celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2007 with the new headmaster Mr Brendan McLoughlin. The former headteacher Sister Mary Teresa RSM [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] was the last of the Sisters to be Head the school and ceased her duties in 2007, opting to remain as deputy chair of the Board of Governors. The school offered both [[GCSE]] and [[Advanced Level]] qualifications for male and female students. \n\n==History==\nThe school was founded by the Sisters of Mercy on 12 September 1957, originally known as ''Mater Misericordiae Grammar School''. It opened in the convent parlour of Quarry Brook House, former home of [[Meccano]] inventor and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Frank Hornby]], with only 16 eleven-year-old girls. The school eventually moved to the first small external section in January 1958. This section was formally blessed by Cardinal Heenan on 8 March in the same year. Due to the interest taken in it by the Bootle Education Committee, it rapidly grew in building size and pupil numbers, and became a voluntary aided [[Grammar School]] in September 1964, maintained by the Bootle Authority.\n\nThe school continued to run as a grammar school until November 1967, when the then [[Archbishop of Liverpool]], Dr Andrew Beck, approached the sisters to see if they would take over a nearby secondary school that had not yet opened,  St. Paul's Catholic Secondary Modern. They agreed, and in September 1968 it was annexed to their existing building. It was the first co-educational voluntary aided school in the Archdiocese, opened under the new title of ''Maricourt Catholic High School'', with Sister Mary Magdalen as headmistress. She retired at Christmas in 1989 and was succeeded by Sister Mary Teresa, who led the school until 2007. The school is now the largest Catholic secondary school in the [[Metropolitan Borough of Sefton]]. A jubilee mass was celebrated on 21 September 2007 in the [[Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral]]. The chief celebrant was the [[Archbishop of Liverpool]], Patrick Kelly, with thousands of friends, students, past and present attending the ceremony to celebrate the milestone.\n\n==Sixth Form==\nThe [[Sixth Form]] at Maricourt was rated as gaining some of the highest [[Advanced Level]] results in [[Merseyside]] and stand consistently above the national average,<ref>{{cite web|title=Department for Education KS5 Results|url=http://www.education.gov.uk/cgi-bin/performancetables/school_10.pl?No=3434621&Type=LA&Begin=c1&Num=343&Phase=2&Year=10&Base=c|work=National Results}}</ref> as well as enjoying a regular 100% pass rate for Advanced Level students. Maricourt works alongside [[Maghull High School]] and [[Deyes High School]] to form the ''Maghull Collaborative'', in which students may study across these sixth forms to broaden the A-Level curriculum available within them. Facilities at Maricourt, based in Quarry Brook House, were subject to substantial refurbishment during the 2011 August Holidays with modified study areas as well as the conversion of one of Quarry Brook's larger first floor rooms into an Oratory for use by students.\n\n== School Grounds ==\nMaricourt is split across two sites, Newman Hall and Arnold Hall, upper and lower school respectively. Newman Hall, named in the honour of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[John Henry Newman]], is considered the school's main site and is home to both the administrative offices and most subject offices. School years 9 to 11 and the [[Sixth Form]] reside on this site for the majority of their lessons, and years 7 and 8 visit the site to use the available facilities, such as sports, drama and technology. Arnold Hall, previously the site of St Paul's Comprehensive, serves as the primary site for years 7 and 8, with sports facilities and rooms used by all students. Both sites have a large field used for recreation, physical education and sporting events. \n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Newman Maricourt Map.png|1000px|centre|Newman Hall]] -->\n\n==Mission and Ethos==\n{{Quote box\n| quote = '''''Maricourt seeks to  provide and sustain a living Roman Catholic community which is rooted in Christian values and where growth and knowledge, respect, love and friendship are shared by all.'''''\n| align = center\n}}\n\nThe mission statement is represented by a tree, symbolising Maricourt as a living community; with each year new people joining, whilst others move to the world of work or higher education. The school ethos fosters the development of each individual, a proper sense of self-worth, a sense of responsibility and respect for others. The school was founded in the tradition of the Sisters of Mercy, an institute founded for the service of those in need.

{"title_page": "Hassan al-Hudaybi", "text_new": "'''Hassan al-Hudaybi''' (also '''Hassan al Hodeiby''') (Arabic: \u062d\u0633\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0636\u064a\u0628\u064a) (Dec 1891 \u2013 Nov 11, 1973) was the second \"General Guide\", or leader, of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] organization, appointed in 1951 after founder [[Hassan al-Banna]]'s assassination two years earlier. Al-Hudaybi held the position until his death in 1973.\n[[File:Hassan El-Hodabi.jpg|thumb|Hassan El-Hodabi]]\n\n== Early life ==\nHassan Isma\u2018il al-Hudaybi was born in the village of Arab al-Suwaliha, located in north-east Cairo, in December 1891. The eldest of four sisters and three brothers, he was raised in a poor, working-class family. His father wanted his eldest son to become a scholar and thus began Hassan's education with Qur'an lessons at the local village school. However, after a year of religious schooling, Hassan chose to transfer to a secular government primary school. He continued his secular education through secondary school and later received a degree in law in 1915.\n\nIn 1924, al-Hudaybi was promoted to judgeship and received his first posting at Qena, but gradually worked his way up the judicial system. By the 1940s, he was one of the highest ranking representatives of the Egyptian judiciary, with his final post being Chancellor of the Court of Appeals before leading the Muslim Brotherhood.<ref name=\"Johnston40\">{{cite journal |last=Johnston |first=David L. |title=Hassan al-Hudaybi and the Muslim Brotherhood: Can Islamic Fundamentalism Eschew the Islamic State? |journal=Comparative Islamic Studies |volume=3 |year=2007 |issue=1 |pages=40}}</ref>\n\n== Appointment as General Guide ==\nAl-Hudaybi was aware of the society of the Muslim Brotherhood beginning in the 1930s, and was introduced to Hasan al-Banna approximately ten years later. His friendship with al-Banna grew and he began to serve as an unofficial personal advisor to him. Through this secretive relationship, al-Hudaybi gradually learned about the internal affairs of the Brotherhood.<ref>{{cite book |last=Zollner |first=Barbara H. E. |title=The Muslim Brotherhood: Hasan al-Hudaybi and Ideology |location=London and New York |publisher=Routledge |year=2009 |pages=22 |isbn=978-0-203-88843-8}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the society in 1948 and the assassination of al-Banna in 1949, the survival of the Muslim Brotherhood was at stake. If the Muslim Brotherhood wanted to continue as a political-religious movement instead of maintaining its reputation as a violent elite, they needed to improve their public image.<ref>Zollner, ''The Muslim Brotherhood'', 17</ref> Given that the leading members of the society were all shrouded by the stigma of violence and crisis, the leaders appointed al-Hudaybi as the new ''[[Murshid]]'', or guide. Al-Hudaybi was a strategic choice by the Brotherhood. With his strong ties to political power, aversion to violence, and clean public image, al-Hudaybi was seen as an outsider whose image could help the Muslim Brotherhood regain legitimacy.<ref name=\"Johnston40\" />\n\nHowever, although al-Hudaybi was appointed as the leader of the society, his role was initially intended to only be a symbolic one.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=Richard P. |title=The Society of the Muslim Brothers |location=London |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1969 |pages=85 |isbn=0-19-508437-3}}</ref> Many of his demands were initially disregarded, including requests to appoint his supporters to key administrative positions as well as calls to dissolve of the Secret Apparatus of the Brotherhood.\n\n== Conflict with the Secret Apparatus ==\nOnce al-Hudaybi entered office, he condemned the violence that engrossed the movement from 1946\u20131949 and ordered that the Brotherhood dissolve their secret military branch immediately. This created deep tensions between him and other high-ranking members supportive of the Secret Apparatus, including Salih al-\u2019Ashmawi and Abd al-Rahman al-Sanadi. Throughout his leadership, all-Hudaybi continued to oppose violent action and repudiated any preparations for armed conflicts by the Brotherhood. Members of the Secret Apparatus who considered themselves fighters in a noble cause felt alienated by him and soon joined ranks to try to force al-Hudaybi to resign.<ref>Mitchell, ''The Society of the Muslim Brothers'', 85.</ref><ref>Zollner, ''The Muslim Brotherhood'', 32.</ref>\n\n== Imprisonment ==\nAfter a former member of the Secret Unit, Mahmud \u2018Abd al-Latif, allegedly attempted to assassinate President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|\u2018Abd al-Nasir]] in October of 1954, the government began a new wave of arrests against members of the Muslim Brotherhood. On December 4th, seven defendants of the Brotherhood, including Hassan al-Hudaybi, were condemned to death by the court. Three days later, the death sentences were carried out except that of al-Hudaybi's, whose verdict was commuted to life in prison.\n\n== Preachers, Not Judges (''Du'at la Qudat'') ==\nWhile in prison, al-Hudaybi is said to have completed the manuscript for ''Du\u2019at la Qudat'', which was published after his death in 1977.

Al-Hudaybi held the position until his death in 1973.\n[[File:Hassan El-Hodabi.jpg|thumb|Hassan El-Hodabi]]\n\n== Early life ==\n\nHassan Isma\u2018il al-Hudaybi was born in the village of Arab al-Suwaliha, located in north-east Cairo, in December 1891. The eldest of four sisters and three brothers, he was raised in a poor, working-class family. His father wanted his eldest son to become a scholar and thus began Hassan's education with Qur'an lessons at the local village school. However, after a year of religious schooling, Hassan chose to transfer to a secular government primary school. He continued his secular education through secondary school and later received a degree in law in 1915.\n\nIn 1924, al-Hudaybi was promoted to judgeship and received his first posting at Qena, but gradually worked his way up the judicial system. By the 1940s, he was one of the highest ranking representatives of the Egyptian judiciary, with his final post being Chancellor of the Court of Appeals before leading the Muslim Brotherhood.<ref name=\"Johnston40\">{{cite journal |last=Johnston |first=David L. |title=Hassan al-Hudaybi and the Muslim Brotherhood: Can Islamic Fundamentalism Eschew the Islamic State? |journal=Comparative Islamic Studies |volume=3 |year=2007 |issue=1 |pages=40 |doi= }}</ref>\n\n== Appointment as General Guide ==\n\nAl-Hudaybi was aware of the society of the Muslim Brotherhood beginning in the 1930s, and was introduced to Hasan al-Banna approximately ten years later. His friendship with al-Banna grew and he began to serve as an unofficial personal advisor to him. Through this secretive relationship, al-Hudaybi gradually learned about the internal affairs of the Brotherhood.<ref>{{cite book |last=Zollner |first=Barbara H. E. |title=The Muslim Brotherhood: Hasan al-Hudaybi and Ideology |location=London and New York |publisher=Routledge |year=2009 |pages=22 |isbn=978-0-203-88843-8 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the society in 1948 and the assassination of al-Banna in 1949, the survival of the Muslim Brotherhood was at stake. If the Muslim Brotherhood wanted to continue as a political-religious movement instead of maintaining its reputation as a violent elite, they needed to improve their public image.<ref>Zollner, The Muslim Brotherhood, 17</ref> Given that the leading members of the society were all shrouded by the stigma of violence and crisis, the leaders appointed al-Hudaybi as the new ''[[Murshid]]'', or guide. Al-Hudaybi was a strategic choice by the Brotherhood. With his strong ties to political power, aversion to violence, and clean public image, al-Hudaybi was seen as an outsider whose image could help the Muslim Brotherhood regain legitimacy.<ref name=\"Johnston40\" />\n\nHowever, although al-Hudaybi was appointed as the leader of the society, his role was initially intended to only be a symbolic one.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=Richard P. |title=The Society of the Muslim Brothers |location=London |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1969 |pages=85 |isbn=0-19-508437-3 }}</ref> Many of his demands were initially disregarded, including requests to appoint his supporters to key administrative positions as well as calls to dissolve of the Secret Apparatus of the Brotherhood.\n\n== Conflict with the Secret Apparatus ==\n\nOnce al-Hudaybi entered office, he condemned the violence that engrossed the movement from 1946-1949 and ordered that the Brotherhood dissolve their secret military branch immediately. This created deep tensions between him and other high-ranking members supportive of the Secret Apparatus, including Salih al-\u2019Ashmawi and Abd al-Rahman al-Sanadi. Throughout his leadership, all-Hudaybi continued to oppose violent action and repudiated any preparations for armed conflicts by the Brotherhood. Members of the Secret Apparatus who considered themselves fighters in a noble cause felt alienated by him and soon joined ranks to try to force al-Hudaybi to resign.<ref>Mitchell, The Society of the Muslim Brothers, 85.</ref><ref>Zollner, The Muslim Brotherhood, 32.</ref>\n\n== Imprisonment ==\n\nAfter a former member of the Secret Unit, Mahmud \u2018Abd al-Latif, allegedly attempted to assassinate President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|\u2018Abd al-Nasir]] in October of 1954, the government began a new wave of arrests against members of the Muslim Brotherhood. On December 4th, seven defendants of the Brotherhood, including Hassan al-Hudaybi, were condemned to death by the court. Three days later, the death sentences were carried out except that of al-Hudaybi\u2019s, whose verdict was commuted to life in prison.\n\n== Preachers, Not Judges (''Du'at la Qudat'') ==\n\nWhile in prison, al-Hudaybi is said to have completed the manuscript for ''Du\u2019at la Qudat'', which was published after his death in 1977. [[Emmanuel Sivan]] and [[Gilles Kepel]] have argued that the text is a refutation of [[Sayyid Qutb]]\u2019s Islamist manifesto ''[[Ma'alim fi al-Tariq]]'' (Milestones Along the Way). Although ''Du'at la Qudat'' does not mention Qutb by name and only criticizes Pakistani Islamist [[Abul A'la Maududi]], it argues against ''[[takfir]]'' - the practice of declaring another Muslim a non-believer - that Qutb employed.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sivan |first=Emmanuel |title=Radical Islam : Medieval Theology and Modern Politics |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1985 |pages=108\u2013110 |isbn=0-300-03263-3 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Kepel |first=Gilles |title=Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam |location=London |publisher=I.B.
