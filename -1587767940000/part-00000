Some of these transit systems are older and more developed, such as the metro in Cairo which opened in 1987. While others such as light rail in Addis Ababa is much more recent, as recently as 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.urbanrail.net/af/addis-ababa/addis-ababa.htm|title=UrbanRail.Net > Africa > Ethiopia > Addis Ababa light rail|website=www.urbanrail.net|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> A variety of technology has been used ranging from light-rail, bus rapid-transit, and commuter-rail etc. Africa for several decades saw minimal investment in rail infrastructure, in recent years due to urban population growth investment in rail networks has increased.\n\n== Background ==\nAfrican heavy-rail is an artifact of the colonial period, where colonizing nations built out these networks to further the conquest of Africa. The colonizing nations also used these networks to transport from the extractive resource operations they developed.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Oumarou|first=Amadou|date=2015|title=Rail Infrastructure in Africa|url=https://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Events/ATFforum/Rail_Infrastructure_in_Africa_-_Financing_Policy_Options_-_AfDB.pdf|journal=African Development Bank Group|volume=|pages=54|via=}}</ref> These rail networks criss-crossed major areas of Africa, but with the Independence period these networks became splintered. These networks declined over the next few decades, due to lower demand and lower levels of investment. Like many other aspects of African governments, these became overstaffed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Oumarou|first=Amadou|date=2015|title=Rail Infrastructure in Africa|url=https://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Events/ATFforum/Rail_Infrastructure_in_Africa_-_Financing_Policy_Options_-_AfDB.pdf|journal=African Development Bank Group|volume=|pages=20|via=}}</ref> \n\nIn recent decades the potential economic growth has been untapped with the growth of extractive industries such as mining and oil drilling.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Oumarou|first=Amadou|date=2015|title=Rail Infrastructure in Africa|url=https://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Events/ATFforum/Rail_Infrastructure_in_Africa_-_Financing_Policy_Options_-_AfDB.pdf|journal=African Development Bank Group|volume=|pages=54|via=}}</ref> Many of these mines are located in the several land-locked nations in the African interior. Aware of the environmental toll that road-transport requires, nations and foreign actors are realizing the potential of rail transit in Africa. Besides economic incentives, urbanization has been fueling the growth of mega cities across the globe. Lagos, Nairobi, Cairo, Kinshasa, Luanda, Dar es Salaam, Johannesburg, and Abidjan, etc, either are all mega cities across Africa that are either already at 10 million people, or soon on track to surpass that number. \n\n== Northern Africa ==\n[[File:Cairo Metro Map (arabic).svg|thumb|334x334px|Map of Cairo Metro circa 2006, in Arabic]]\n\n=== Egypt ===\nEgypt is home to the [[Cairo Metro]], the oldest rail transit system on the African continent, opened in 1987.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Niedzielski|first=Michael A.|last2=Malecki|first2=Edward J.|date=November 2012|title=Making Tracks: Rail Networks in World Cities|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00045608.2011.601212|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|volume=102|issue=6|pages=1409\u20131431|doi=10.1080/00045608.2011.601212|issn=0004-5608}}</ref> The National Authority for Tunnels was established in 1983, which oversees the Cairo Metro.

Some of these transit systems are older and more developed, such as the metro in Cairo which opened in 1987. While others such as light rail in Addis Ababa is much more recent, as recently as 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.urbanrail.net/af/addis-ababa/addis-ababa.htm|title=UrbanRail.Net > Africa > Ethiopia > Addis Ababa light rail|website=www.urbanrail.net|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> A variety of technology has been used ranging from light-rail, bus rapid-transit, and commuter-rail etc. Africa for several decades saw minimal investment in rail infrastructure, in recent years due to urban population growth investment in rail networks has increased.\n\n== Background ==\nAfrican heavy-rail is an artifact of the colonial period, where colonizing nations built out these networks to further the conquest of Africa. The colonizing nations also used these networks to transport from the extractive resource operations they developed.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Oumarou|first=Amadou|date=2015|title=Rail Infrastructure in Africa|url=https://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Events/ATFforum/Rail_Infrastructure_in_Africa_-_Financing_Policy_Options_-_AfDB.pdf|journal=African Development Bank Group|volume=|pages=54|via=}}</ref> These rail networks criss-crossed major areas of Africa, but with the Independence period these networks became splintered. These networks declined over the next few decades, due to lower demand and lower levels of investment.

The chorus line \"So he fired my ass and he fired [[Jerry Rivers]] and he fired everybody just as hard as he could go. He fired Old Cedric and he fired Sammy Pruett.

Liwanag''' (March 27, 1911 \u2013 April 12, 1967) was an officer in the [[Philippine Navy]] who served during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and the [[Korean War]].\n\nHe started his military career as a 3rd Lieutenant with the 3rd Light Infantry Regiment in the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] after graduation from the [[Philippine Military Academy]].  He joined the [[Offshore Patrol]] unit of the [[USAFFE|U.S. Army Forces in the Far East]] (USAFFE) as a 1st Lieutenant during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and was involved in the Battle of Bataan and during the country's liberation in the [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Battle of Manila]].\n\nDuring the Korean War, he served as an Lieutenant Commander - Artillery and Logistic officer in the Army's [[Philippine Expeditionary Forces To Korea#10th Battalion Combat Team (BCT)|10th Battalion Combat Team]] as part of the United Nations Forces - [[Philippine Expeditionary Forces To Korea]] (PEFTOK) during the 1st year of the war, which was the first deployment of Philippine combat forces under the Republic of the Philippines into foreign soil. Shortly after his return from his 1st tour in Korea, he served a 2nd tour as Liaison officer under the Philippine Navy for the UN Command and Philippine Diplomatic Representative in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nLiwanag later served as the commander in the Navy's Service Force (NSF) during the 1960s and later became the Commandant of the Naval Operating Force (NOF) which is the main fighting element of the Philippine Navy, till he was retired from active service.\n\n==Early life and education==\n\nLiwanag was born on March 27, 1911 in Dagupan City, Pangasinan, Philippines to Francisco Liwanag and Ana Soriano. He was sixth among seven children, three brothers and four sisters.\n\nHe attended the [[Philippine Military Academy]] at Baguio City, Mountain Province, Philippines from November 27, 1933 to May 31, 1935 under the academic program. Then entered the military program from June 1, 1935 to March 25, 1938 where he graduated from the Class of 1938 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree. With the Philippines under the American rule at that time, Liwanag spoke fluent English. After graduation he was appointed to the [[3rd Infantry Division (Philippines)|3rd Light Infantry Regiment]] as a 3rd Lieutenant in the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]].\n\nOn February 9, 1939, he graduated from the Army's [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/philippines/navy-history4.htm Off Shore Patrol] (OSP) Training School & Headquarters in Muelle del Codo, Port Area, Manila as part of the newly formed maritime element which he voluntarily joined.  He was trained on seamanship, navigation and gunnery which were conducted with the Filipino USNA graduates as instructors.<ref name=\"Q-boats\">Alcaraz, Ramon A., [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=5035426970  Q-Boats: Heroes of the Off-shore Patrol], Magazine Title: Sea Classics.

He also studied in the United States at the Naval Mine Warfare School (NSMW) in Yorktown, Virginia in 1957.\n\n==Military career==\n\n===World War II===\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II, Liwanag was promoted to second lieutenant on March 26, 1940. Assigned as the supply officer of the [[Offshore Patrol]] (OSP).  During 1941,  the Offshore Patrol - the forerunner of the Philippine Navy \u2013 was the only Filipino naval force after the [[United States Asiatic Fleet]] which is in charge of the naval protection for the Philippines.  He was temporarily promoted to first lieutenant, September 27, 1941. A few weeks after the Japanese attack on [[Pearl Harbor]], his rank became permanent after he was inducted into the [[USAFFE|US Army Forces in the Far East]] (USAFFE) on December 19, 1941.  Four days later, the Japanese planes bombed the Offshore Patrol two-storied headquarters in Muelle del Codo, Port Area, [[Manila]] where he was stationed;<ref>[http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/offices/sps/rotc/pdf/ms2/phil-navy-b.pdf Off Shore Patrol.], Philippine Navy: Four Fold Mission. Sept. 25, 2006</ref> he was in Bataan when this incident happened.  The Naval Headquarters was lightly staffed at that time, only 20 personnel, since all officers and personnel were located across Manila Bay in Bataan and Corregidor preparing its defenses for invasion. To spare Manila from destruction from the Japanese invasion force, Manila was declared an \"open city\". Since the military wasn't returning to Manila, the OSP Commander, Captain Enrique L. \"Henry\" Jurado, ordered the Headquarters to be burned down completely before the Japanese arrival into the city.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/philippines/navy-history4.htm Philippine Naval History, 1939-1941: The Off Shore Patrol (OSP)], GlobalSecurity.org., Retrieved December 2010</ref>\n\nLiwanag relocated and served in the Harbor Defense Force under the Offshore Patrol unit in [[Lamao, Limay|Lamao]], [[Bataan]] during the [[Battle of Bataan]]. Lamao was the new location of the OSP headquarters which was based at the Lamao Horticulture Center, until mid-February they moved the HQ further down to Alasasin Point along the Dinguinin River, Bataan.<ref>[http://www.orosa.org/WARTIME%20PATROL1941-3.pdf Wartime Coastal Patrol - December 1941], Oroso Family Website, June 24, 2008, Retrieved August 5, 2011.</ref>  Liwanag became the officer-in-charge of shore duty at the former OSP Lamao Headquarters and docking facilities after the OSP HQ was moved.  In total there were mostly 60 men in the OSP unit which was divided into 2 main groups, sea and shore duty.  During the next three and a half months, his half of the unit was in charge of shore duty along the eastern coast way of Bataan.  They created fortified defensive positions along the shores and harbors, supplied food, ammunition, medicine and provisions for the front lines. They used a supply point across southernmost point of Manila Bay and Corregidor Island, using 55-foot (17 m) and 65-foot (19 m) high-speed [[John I. Thornycroft & Company|Thorneycroft]] [[Coastal Motor Boat]] (CMB), also known as Q-boats, available to them along with several converted civilian \"fast\" boats from the OSP - sea duty unit. When the sea duty unit is not transferring vital supplies, they were to engage the Japanese forces using their Q-boats by hindering or destroying any landing assaults on the country's shoreline.\n\nWhen the [[Battle of Bataan#The Fall of Bataan|Fall of Bataan]] occurred as the last line of defense was breached by the Japanese forces, droves of American and Filipino soldiers tried to escape capture by any means.  Some of these soldiers found their way to Lamao, knowing that boats were located there.  During a cargo drop-off, Liwanag noticed a small number of armed and unarmed soldiers, about a dozen, were trying to board the docked Q-boats which was strictly ordered to carry ammo and supplies only, not indigenous personnel. Without the knowledge that the last battle line had been breached, he threatened many of the soldiers who board any of the Q-boats will be shot. Liwanag escorted the off loaded Q-boats to their supply point. As he returned from the supply trip back to Lamao, his harbor and shoreline was overwhelmed by a chaotic scene of more panicked troops eager to escape the Japanese advance.  He realized the last battle line has finally failed and understood the peril of these men and the danger of his own unit's position. He ordered all Q-boats on dock to dump their cargo and prepare to take on passengers for an immediate evacuation mission.  Then he organized the harbor evacuations because the retreating troops were endangering the Q-boats by overloading and capsizing them, at the same time restore some form of order to the chaotic mess. From his dock, he sent out an urgent radio order and a general distress call for more needed boats from across Manila Bay.  While all types of civilian boats were volunteering to assist in the evacuation, as more panicked troops kept flooding in. He ordered a number of these troops to create a guard perimeter, which a group of volunteers took the task to provide a security buffer outside the dock facilities from enemy incursions while the evacuation took place. As the night fell, the Japanese were slowly closing in, he ordered a number of the waiting troops with demolition skills to assist in preparing the harbor and the oil refinery facilities nearby for destruction by using the ordnance from their last supply run and available on-site supplies so it would not be useful to the Japanese.  They used as much of their harbor's fuel resources to fill the tanks of all the incoming boats and any portable fuel canisters, since Lamao with its oil refinery facilities was also a fuel & supply depot.<ref name=\"Q-boats\"/>\n\nWhen all the troops and non-essential personnel were safely shuttled off, he ordered all remaining boats to start loading the full fuel canisters on board to be dropped off at a friendly port.  The fuel was mainly used for sea duty's Q-boats to remain functional since they didn't know where another fuel depot would be located. He coordinated the incoming and outgoing boats for the fuel removal, when the perimeter guards warned by relaying that the Japanese were approaching their security perimeter. He ordered all of them to withdraw along with the entire harbor personnel to evacuate in any available boats.  Since most of the docked boats were loaded with extra fuel tanks, the remaining harbor personnel had to sit on top of them as they departed. Liwanag along with several Q-boats remained and waited for all the volunteer perimeter guards to arrive. They all came running in and immediately jumped onto the boats, saying the Japanese were behind them only by several minutes. He finally gave the order to activate the timed explosives for the destruction of the oil refinery tanks, facilities and harbor. As his boat departed, some the perimeter guards on board started firing at the direction of the Japanese to keep them at bay, but ordered them to cease fire to prevent the Japanese from locking onto their position from their weapon's muzzle fire flash which would endangering themselves further since they were all sitting on top of portable fuel tanks.  They used the night's darkness to conceal their departure with only the sounds of their boats motors indicating their departing presence.  The harbor's total destruction took place late during the night with their withdrawal punctuated by a tremendous explosions of the oil refinery tanks which was seen across the Manila Bay.<ref name=\"Q-boats\"/>\n\nHis unit was forced to surrender after the declaration was broadcast from the [[Malinta Tunnel]] in Corregidor through the Voice of Freedom, for all USAFFE forces immediate surrender to the Japanese.  At that point his unit was low on ammunition and fuel getting scarce, since they had been cut off from additional supplies and reinforcements by better trained and equipped, front-line Japanese forces.  They surrendered in [[Nasugbu, Batangas]] on April 9, 1942 while transferring evacuating troops by boat from a withdrawal point off the most southern point of Bataan.  Before they turned themselves over to the Japanese, he ordered the immediate destruction of their boats once they docked, which some burned from lighting the portable fuel tanks and shot out the bottoms to sink them. When the Japanese questioned the boats location, he said they are still in Nasugbu docks but failed to tell them the boats' fate.  He was transferred by trucks along with his unit to [[San Fernando, Pampanga]], then crammed to standing room in train box cars as the Japanese overloaded them to more than double its capacity to [[Capas, Tarlac]]. Once they were offloaded in Capas, they marched the last three kilometers to the internment camp to be detained as [[prisoners of war|POWs]].<ref>[http://www.batch2006.com/visit_camp_o-donnell_tarlac.htm Capas National Shrine], Camp O'Donnell Memorial Site - Capas, Tarlac, Philippines, Retrieved December 2010</ref>\n\nLiwanag was interned in [[Camp O'Donnell]] which was used as an internment camp for both American and Filipino [[prisoners of war]] in [[Capas, Tarlac]] from April 9 to August 4, 1942. The Japanese occupying force released a small number of Philippine military personnel after going thru an \"rejuvenation program\" to return to civilian life, of which he was one of the fortunate few. Their aim was to integrate them back to society but kept some of them under Japanese surveillance by Filipino collaborators loyal to the Japanese in the hope they would lead them to any Allied dissident forces.  He witnessed several formerly released Philippine military personnel being picked up for suspicion of conspiracy against the Japanese. They were automatically returned to the POW camps or summarily executed.  Under the scrutiny then he be might under surveillance, he could not return to his family for fear of endangering them by using them as leverage against him.  He did not acknowledge any one of his civilian friends who recognized him, knowing that the Japanese might interrogate them.  One of his friends knew the predicament he was in and notified the family of his whereabouts, which at that time believed he was still interned in Camp O'Donnell.  Liwanag's wife doubted their friend that the Japanese were releasing Filipino military personnel, until she travelled to Capas and confirmed it on a posted form on the POW camp bulletin board of the 1,400 prisoners that were released.<ref>Diary Entry: August 5, 1942, [http://filipinos-ww2usmilitaryservice.tripod.com/id63.html War Diary of Commodore Ramon Alcaraz], Maritime Review, March 09, 2007, Retrieved August 05, 2011</ref>  As a PMA officer, he was still obligated to his oath to duty. He would discreetly gather intelligence on Japanese positions, personnel, equipment and strength in the Manila vicinity.  Knowing that the US General [[Douglas MacArthur]] would return from Australia, the information will be useful in the re-take of Manila and its surrounding towns.\n\nOnce the U.S. Forces returned to the Philippines and started driving back the Japanese forces, he sought out to rejoin the Allied forces but was recognized by a fellow POW whom he had been interned with that had connections to the guerrilla forces.  With their help, they both got back to Allied hands. Liwanag was processed and placed back in the USAFFE and reinstated to his rank of first lieutenant on January 28, 1945.  What was left of his Offshore Patrol unit was mainly dismantled by the Japanese, the main portion were still interned in [[Camp O'Donnell]] and other POW camps, the unit's boats were scuttled or burned so Japanese forces would not possess them.  Only a small group of surviving personnel of the Offshore Patrol, sea duty units, conducted guerrilla hit-and-run attacks.  With the enemy intelligence he gathered along with his knowledge of the layout of Manila, he was assigned to assist U.S. Army and USAFFE Army infantry units preparing to enter the city. Five days later, he fought alongside the U.S. Army and USAFFE Army units that he guided in the [[Battle of Manila (1945)|liberation of Manila]].\n\nAfter the Japanese were removed from Manila, Liwanag and surviving USAFFE OSP officers were in charge in rebuilding the Offshore Patrol Unit to continue with their duties of securing the country's sea and shores.\n\n===After World War II===\nAfter the war, he was promoted to the rank of an USAFFE captain on March 11, 1946.  The USAFFE was disbanded as the Philippines won its independence from the United States on June 30, 1946.  In July 1946, Liwanag returned to his old unit, which changed into the newly formed Philippine Naval Patrol and was reactivated to the promoted naval rank as a [[lieutenant commander]].  The [[President of the Philippines]] [[Manuel Roxas]] strengthened the Offshore Patrol after issuing Executive Order No. 94 on October 5, 1947. This order officially elevated the patrol to a major command that was equal to the other branches of the armed forces, which is now the [[Philippine Navy]]. The [[Offshore Patrol|OSP]] was renamed the Philippine Naval Patrol (PNP), later on it changed into the Philippine Navy on January 5, 1951.  Liwanag and fellow surviving OSP officers became the early pioneers that helped shaped the structure of the Philippine Navy.\n\n===Korean War===\n\n==== 10th BCT PEFTOK ====\n\nLiwanag was part of the [[Philippine Expeditionary Forces To Korea]] (PEFTOK), the Philippine combat contingent of the United Nations forces that was deployed to Korea.  As the only Philippine naval officer to volunteer to the army's combat contingent, he was assigned to the [[Philippine Expeditionary Forces To Korea#10th Battalion Combat Team (BCT)|10th Battalion Combat Team]] (BCT) - Motorized, Philippine Army - United Nations Command (UNC) as a navy lieutenant commander<ref>[http://www.philippinepeacekeepers.ph/?args=Registry&kstr=emilio+liwanag&mode=1 Veterans' Registry - Liwanag], Philippine Peacekeepers Website, April 30, 2010.

The PEFTOK units were the first combat units to participate overseas under the newly formed Philippine Republic.  They landed in Busan, Korea on September 19, 1950 along with 1,303 enlisted men and 64 officers who were transported by US Navy transport vessel,<ref>[http://www.philembassy-seoul.com/dafa.asp  Embassy of the Republic of the Philippines (Seoul, Korea)], Defense & Armed Forces Attach\u00e9, 2007-08, Retrieved August 15, 2011</ref> [[USNS Sgt. Sylvester Antolak (T-AP-192)]]. The PEFTOK was the 8th foreign country after the Americans and the [[27th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|27th British Commonwealth Infantry Brigade]] (consisting of units from the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India and 2 battalions from Hong Kong.)  Most of the Filipino battalion were combat veterans who fought the Japanese Imperial Army either as a regular soldier or guerrilla. Some of the veterans has experience in fighting with a communist force, especially during the [[Hukbalahap Rebellion]] in the Philippines. The 10th BCT was first attached to and provided support for the American [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]].\n\nThe battalion had to deal with some immediate setbacks upon their arrival in the port of Busan, they have no winter weather clothing and no armor available for them.  The cold weather of winter was a shock to almost all in the Filipino combat unit since the Philippines is a tropical island nation. They weren't prepared for the weather difference plus the lack of winter gear that was supposed to be available to them on their arrival. The 10th was Philippines' only armored tank battalion at the time, consisting of three rifle companies, a medium tank company, a reconnaissance company equipped with light tanks and a field artillery battery.  They were equipped with a company of 29 [[M4 Sherman]] medium tanks and a company of [[M5 Stuart]] light tanks which all remained in the Philippines.  The Americans were to supply the 10th with surplus tanks consisting of 17 M4 Shermans and one [[M10 tank destroyer]] which was awaiting for them in Korea.  Unfortunately during the UN Command withdrawal from the [[Battle of Pusan Perimeter]], their tanks were destroyed before they saw combat.<ref>3rd paragraph [http://www.reocities.com/peftok/10thbct.html PEFTOK - 10th BCT Website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005121020/http://www.reocities.com/peftok/10thbct.html |date=2012-10-05 }}, 2000, Retrieved August 2011.</ref>  For several days since their landing, they received no word from the Americans when or if they will receive replacement armor.  The 10th battalion commanders and staff were wondering what to do with the two tankless companies once the battalion were assigned to a mission from the Americans, since most of the armor personnel were lightly armed.  As the battalion Logistic officer, Liwanag took it upon himself to rectify their precarious dilemma.  With the working knowledge how the U.S. Army's logistic supply system functions during Second World War, he knew where he can get the supplies directly to bypass the long chain of bureaucratic red-tape.  He requested the battalion commanders, Lt. Col. Mariano Azurin<ref>[http://www.philippinepeacekeepers.ph/?args=Registry&kstr=Mariano+Azurin&mode=1  Veterans' Registry - Azurin], Philippine Peacekeepers Website, April 30, 2010.

Yap to accompany him to the [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]] headquarters to see what they have available at their supply depot.\n\nWhen they arrived to the 25th Division HQ, it was a beehive of activity as they were coordinating to secure their sector of the UN battleline.  After explaining directly to the American HQ commanders of the 10th situation, they gave him free rein in the division's supply depot and motor pool to take whatever Major Liwanag needed.  Without conferring to his battalion commanders on items they had on hand, he secured the items on site that were available before they were requisitioned to another unit.  When he returned, to the surprise of everyone in the battalion, he was able to secure seven [[M24 Chaffee]]<ref>Villahermosa, Gilberto N., pg. 104, [http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/korea/65Inf_Korea/index.html Honor and Fidelity: The 65th Infantry in Korea, 1950-1953], (2009), Washington, D.C.: United States Army Center of Military History, Retrieved August 5, 2011</ref> light tanks as their only replacement armor, and riding behind them were several more truckloads of brand new heavy weapons ranging from machine guns of different variants, bazookas, grenades and mortars - along with more ammunition for the entire battalion's needs. There were no available spare Shermans, as all replacement tanks would take several weeks to be shipped in from the US mainland.  Along with the trucks carried all the battalion's new winter clothing and gear, which was his first priority items to secure. The Recon Company received the Chaffees, which was a far better light tank compared to their under-gunned, slow, obsolete M5 Stuarts. All the truckloads of new heavy weaponry he collected went to the tankless Tank Company which he reorganize them as a Heavy Weapons Company, which the battalion commander and the Tank Company's commander, Captain Conrado D. Yap,<ref>Medal of Valor Awardees [http://www.army.mil.ph/VALOR_AWARDEE/yap.html], Philippine Army Website, 2007. Retrieved October 2012.</ref> approved to Liwanag's re-assessment.  Near the city of [[Miryang]], the battalion spent about two weeks of pre-combat training with their new equipment and their change of combat duties, namely the Heavy Weapons Company.  Liwanag became directly responsible in the transition of reshaping the new company and closely working together with Capt. Yap, made sure that his newly reassigned company functions smoothly.\n\n==== Battle of Yultong ====\n\nOn April 22 & 23, the 10th BCT was deployed 5 kilometers north of [[Yeoncheon]] amid the Chinese Spring Offensive.  The battalion was moved to the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]] to reinforce its ranks, which the Chinese 44th Division offensive was to conduct echelons of night attacks to overrun the 10th's hill position.  The Filipino battalion was heavily outnumbered 17 to 1 and surrounded, which made every Filipino, from cooks to drivers, to take up arms and fight. Liwanag was the senior artillery officer assigned to lead the field artillery battalion, which was his first artillery command since recently graduating from artillery school. He provided close artillery support using their six 105mm howitzers to reduce the Chinese numbers who approached their hill positions.  They succeeded in holding their ground from the Chinese, which allowed the withdrawal of allied friendly forces, and continued to hold their ground until they were given the order for their own to withdraw.  The battle was known as the [[Battle of Yultong]], which became the largest battle that Philippine troops participated in during the Korean War and was widely known as their bravest stand during the conflict. For their actions, Tank Company, the company which Liwanag re-tasked, assisted in their training, and provided their weaponry, was decorated the [[Non-U.S. recipients of U.S. gallantry awards#UN Forces in the Chinese Spring Offensive|US Gallantry Award]].\n\nThe 10th BCT earned its unit's name, \"The Fighting Filipinos\" later called \"The Fighting Tenth\". They continued to serve until September 27, 1951 when they were replaced by the [[Philippine Expeditionary Forces To Korea#20th Battalion Combat Team (BCT)|20th BCT]]. The battalion's total casualty count for the war was 43 KIA, 9 MIA, 58 captured. His unit stayed 398 days in Korea and returned to Manila on October 23 to a euphoric hero's welcome.\n\n==== Military attach\u00e9 ====\n\nLiwanag and several veterans of the 10th BCT decided to extend their combat tour instead of returning home. The Army veterans were reassigned to the 20th BCT, while he was returned to the Philippine Navy in the Korean campaign.  Liwanag was assigned as the senior naval advisor to the Philippine Diplomatic Representative for the Philippine Embassy, along with the additional duty of being the Philippine Liaison Officer to [[United Nations Command (Korea)|United Nations Command]] Headquarters in Tokyo, Japan.  On July 5, 1951, he was promoted to the rank of [[Commander]].\n\nOn October 7, 1952, Liwanag was decorated with the [[Legion of Merit]] by Maj. Gen. [[Blackshear M.

He became the first Filipino Officer under the Philippine Republic to receive this distinguished medal, which is the highest US military decoration to be given to a foreign national.\n\nAccording to the citation, Commander Liwanag distinguished himself from December 12, 1950 to September 30, 1952.  It read in part:\n\n<blockquote>Applying his keen judgment and professional experience, Commander Liwanag formulated plans for the logistical support and efficient integration of Philippine forces into the [[Korean War]].  His high sense of duty and spirit of cooperation were contributing factors to the successful integration of the Philippine combat teams as elements of the United Nations Command and reflect great credit on himself and the Philippine Navy.<ref>\"Award Liwanag US Merit Medal\", Manila Times, Oct. 08, 1952.</ref><ref>\"U.S. Legion of Merit to Philippine Officr\", Manila Chronicle, Nov. 29, 1952.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHis Legion of Merit medal currently resides in display at the Philippine Military Academy Museum which was donated by his family.\n\n===Operation \"Bulwark One\"===\n\nIn January 1958, Capt. Liwanag was chosen as the overall commander throughout phases II and III of the naval exercise Operation \"Bulwark One\" or Exercise\n\"Bulwark\", a harbor defense maneuver sponsored jointly by the [[Philippine Navy]] and [[US Navy]].  The naval operation was the first US-Philippine joint exercise since the Philippines' liberation (1946).  Its purpose was to acquaint and promote the close working relationship of the US Navy and the Philippine Navy in the defense of Philippine harbors.  The exercise was significant in that the ability of a nation to last in a war of any kind, whether nuclear or conventional, would depend upon its ability to protect its shipping life-lines.\n\nFor the first time in any joint US-Philippine exercise, all US Navy units during phase II and III was placed under the overall command of a Philippine Navy senior officer, Capt. Emilio Liwanag. According to Lt. Gen Alfonso Arellano, [[List of AFP Chiefs of Staff|AFP Chief of Staff]] (1956\u20131957), he hailed the designation of Liwanag, pointing out that it was the first time that a Filipino officer was chosen to head a vital and big military exercise in which a foreign contingent was participating.  Selection of Liwanag, Arellano said, shows only too well the proficiency of the Filipino soldier and the degree of respect and admiration with which he is held by his counterparts abroad.<ref name=\"Manila Times, 1958\"/>\n\nThe exercise was broken down in three different phases in a three-month period:\n\n==== Phase I (Jan. 8) ====\nThis stage of the exercise, which involves the shore training of participants on techniques and procedures in harbor defense at the base in [[Cavite]].  Fifty-six PN officers and three hundred enlisted men had a two-week classroom instruction course on harbor defense to be followed by another two weeks of practical training under competent Filipino and American instructors from [[Cavite Navy Yard]] and [[US Naval Base Subic Bay]].  After their training, these PN officers and sailors would form the nucleus of the country's first post-war harbor defense unit.<ref name=\"Manila Times, 1958\">\"PN Man Heads Sea Maneuvers\", Manila Times, Jan. 9, 1958</ref>\n\n==== Phase II (Feb. 6\u201315) ====\nConsist of drills at the [[Corregidor]] and [[Caballo Island|Caballo]] areas and establishment of a Harbor Defense Command Center.  This stage practices operations against enemy air and sub-surface attackers along with protecting friendly shipping lanes.  The tactical importance of this phase of this exercise was that in case of a real emergency, Corregidor may be fortified to protect the entire harbor of Manila.  The addition of radar, sonar and other harbor defense equipment was set up on Corregidor to improve and upgrade the Harbor defenses, which was provided by the US Navy.<ref>\"The Rock is still Defense Bastion\", Manila Times, February 20, 1958.</ref>\n\n==== Phase III (March 19\u201322) ====\nThe actual firing phase where the US-Philippine Navy participant-units focus on Harbor defense operations to protect friendly shipping off Corregidor.  This included mine laying operations, surface and underwater detection with radar, sonar, spotting towers and anti-aircraft action. They simulated attacks from a submarine, a disguised merchant ship and an air attack around Corregidor and Caballo islands area.  Eight assorted PN vessels and Harbor defense unit will staved off an actual attack of enemy forces played by seven US naval vessels including a submarine.  The [[Philippine Air Force]] contributed friendly and enemy forces of [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustangs]] and [[North American F-86 Sabre|F-86 Sabre]] jets.<ref>\"PI-US War Games Slated\", Manila Times, Jan. 09, 1958.</ref>\n\n==== Conclusion ====\nThe naval exercise was successful in giving valuable operational training in harbor defense and mine warfare to the participating units and promoted closer working relations among the Philippine Navy, Air Force and the US Navy.  This benchmarked some milestones for the Philippine Forces for being the first US-Philippine bilateral harbor defense maneuvers held in the Philippines since the liberation.  The first activation of the country's Harbor Defense Unit, and the first Filipino senior officer to command a combined exercise.\n\nThe exercise involved fifteen US and Philippine naval vessels: the US Navy provided picket boats, minesweepers - {{USS|Fortify|AM-446|2}}, {{USS|Inflict|AM-456|2}} and {{USS|Engage|MSO-433|2}}, a submarine - {{USS|Capitaine|SS-336}}, aircraft - namely two [[Martin PBM Mariner|Martin PBM patrol bombers]], several amphibious vehicles ([[Landing Vehicle Tracked|LVT-4]]) and harbor defense units.  The Philippine Navy provided minesweepers, coast guard crafts (CGC)s, a patrol craft - RPS ''Cebu'' (currently [[BRP Cebu (PS-28)|BRP ''Cebu'' (PS-28)]] which was later reclassified as a corvette-class under the [[Philippine Navy|PN]]) and signal check stations on Corregidor.  The [[Philippine Air Force]] provided four squadrons consisting of eight P-51 Mustangs, four F-86 Sabre jets, four [[Grumman HU-16 Albatross|HU-16 Albatross]] amphibious flying boats and helicopter rescue teams.<ref>\"Operation Bulwark set Friday\", Manila Times, March 20, 1958</ref>\n\nThe success also led to the procurement of equipment used by the US Navy for this exercise.  US military observers which included [[Joseph H. Harper|Maj. Gen.

Garcia]] created the Presidential Enforcement Unit for Southern Philippines (PLEUSP) which was to eradicate rampant violations of customs, revenue and immigration laws in the south of the Philippines.  These violations deprived the government of substantial revenues and provided ruinous competition to legitimate business that would hinder the national economy.\n\nCaptain Liwanag was the commander of the naval unit, Task Force 10, which served as the executing arm of the naval element of the PLEUSP group.<ref>\"Cagayan de Oro Driver held with Smuggled Fags\", Manila Times, April 24, 1957.</ref>   The Task Force was to stop, seize and confiscate all vessels, cargo and contraband that enters Philippine's territorial waters illegally.

The Naval Operating Forces were composed of units of a Marine Battalion, Underwater Operations unit, Naval Air unit and a Small Craft unit.  During his command, he carried out and continued a more stringent anti-smuggling campaign in continuance of the PLEUSP group which was carried over under President [[Diosdado Macapagal]] administration.

After his retirement, he was placed as an Naval Reserve Officer with the Ready Reserve Force until 1965.\nHe was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Star]] medal, conferred by Commodore Juan B. Magluyan, Philippine Navy Chief. His citation read in part, \n\n<blockquote>for eminently meritorious and valuable service to the Navy while Commander of the Service Force and Commander of the Naval Operating Force.</blockquote> \n\nHe was cited for promoting the professional growth of the Navy, for being instrumental in the unrelenting law enforcement campaign around the archipelago and for successful implementation of the Republic of the Philippines\u2013Indonesia border patrol agreement.<ref name=\"Manila Chronicle 1963\"/>\nHe was married to Caridad Buenconsejo (May 25, 1911 - October 8, 1992).

After graduation he was appointed to the [[3rd Infantry Division (Philippines)|3rd Light Infantry Regiment]] as a 3rd Lieutenant in the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]].\n\nOn February 9, 1939, he graduated from the Army's [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/philippines/navy-history4.htm Off Shore Patrol] (OSP) Training School & Headquarters in Muelle del Codo, Port Area, Manila as part of the newly formed maritime element which he voluntarily joined.

He also studied in the United States at the Naval Mine Warfare School (NSMW) in Yorktown, Virginia in 1957.\n\n==Military career==\n\n===World War II===\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II, Liwanag was promoted to second lieutenant on March 26, 1940. Assigned as the supply officer of the [[Offshore Patrol]] (OSP).  During 1941,  the Offshore Patrol - the forerunner of the Philippine Navy \u2013 was the only Filipino naval force after the [[United States Asiatic Fleet]] which is in charge of the naval protection for the Philippines.  He was temporarily promoted to first lieutenant, September 27, 1941. A few weeks after the Japanese attack on [[Pearl Harbor]], his rank became permanent after he was inducted into the [[USAFFE|US Army Forces in the Far East]] (USAFFE) on December 19, 1941.  Four days later, the Japanese planes bombed the Offshore Patrol two-storied headquarters in Muelle del Codo, Port Area, [[Manila]] where he was stationed;<ref>[http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/offices/sps/rotc/pdf/ms2/phil-navy-b.pdf Off Shore Patrol.], Philippine Navy: Four Fold Mission. Sept. 25, 2006</ref> he was in Bataan when this incident happened.  The Naval Headquarters was lightly staffed at that time, only 20 personnel, since all officers and personnel were located across Manila Bay in Bataan and Corregidor preparing its defenses for invasion. To spare Manila from destruction from the Japanese invasion force, Manila was declared an \"open city\". Since the military wasn't returning to Manila, the OSP Commander, Captain Enrique L. \"Henry\" Jurado, ordered the Headquarters to be burned down completely before the Japanese arrival into the city.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/philippines/navy-history4.htm Philippine Naval History, 1939-1941: The Off Shore Patrol (OSP)], GlobalSecurity.org., Retrieved December 2010</ref>\n\nLiwanag relocated and served in the Harbor Defense Force under the Offshore Patrol unit in [[Lamao, Limay|Lamao]], [[Bataan]] during the [[Battle of Bataan]]. Lamao was the new location of the OSP headquarters which was based at the Lamao Horticulture Center, until mid-February they moved the HQ further down to Alasasin Point along the Dinguinin River, Bataan.<ref>[http://www.orosa.org/WARTIME%20PATROL1941-3.pdf Wartime Coastal Patrol - December 1941], Oroso Family Website, June 24, 2008, Retrieved August 5, 2011.</ref>  Liwanag became the officer-in-charge of shore duty at the former OSP Lamao Headquarters and docking facilities after the OSP HQ was moved.  In total there were mostly 60 men in the OSP unit which was divided into 2 main groups, sea and shore duty.  During the next three and a half months, his half of the unit was in charge of shore duty along the eastern coast way of Bataan.  They created fortified defensive positions along the shores and harbors, supplied food, ammunition, medicine and provisions for the front lines. They used a supply point across southernmost point of Manila Bay and Corregidor Island, using 55-foot (17 m) and 65-foot (19 m) high-speed [[John I. Thornycroft & Company|Thorneycroft]] [[Coastal Motor Boat]] (CMB), also known as Q-boats, available to them along with several converted civilian \"fast\" boats from the OSP - sea duty unit. When the sea duty unit is not transferring vital supplies, they were to engage the Japanese forces using their Q-boats by hindering or destroying any landing assaults on the country's shoreline.\n\nWhen the [[Battle of Bataan#The Fall of Bataan|Fall of Bataan]] occurred as the last line of defense was breached by the Japanese forces, droves of American and Filipino soldiers tried to escape capture by any means.  Some of these soldiers found their way to Lamao, knowing that boats were located there.  During a cargo drop-off, Liwanag noticed a small number of armed and unarmed soldiers, about a dozen, were trying to board the docked Q-boats which was strictly ordered to carry ammo and supplies only, not indigenous personnel. Without the knowledge that the last battle line had been breached, he threatened many of the soldiers who board any of the Q-boats will be shot. Liwanag escorted the off loaded Q-boats to their supply point. As he returned from the supply trip back to Lamao, his harbor and shoreline was overwhelmed by a chaotic scene of more panicked troops eager to escape the Japanese advance.  He realized the last battle line has finally failed and understood the peril of these men and the danger of his own unit's position. He ordered all Q-boats on dock to dump their cargo and prepare to take on passengers for an immediate evacuation mission.  Then he organized the harbor evacuations because the retreating troops were endangering the Q-boats by overloading and capsizing them, at the same time restore some form of order to the chaotic mess. From his dock, he sent out an urgent radio order and a general distress call for more needed boats from across Manila Bay.  While all types of civilian boats were volunteering to assist in the evacuation, as more panicked troops kept flooding in. He ordered a number of these troops to create a guard perimeter, which a group of volunteers took the task to provide a security buffer outside the dock facilities from enemy incursions while the evacuation took place. As the night fell, the Japanese were slowly closing in, he ordered a number of the waiting troops with demolition skills to assist in preparing the harbor and the oil refinery facilities nearby for destruction by using the ordnance from their last supply run and available on-site supplies so it wouldn't be useful to the Japanese.  They used as much of their harbor's fuel resources to fill the tanks of all the incoming boats and any portable fuel canisters, since Lamao with it's oil refinery facilities was also a fuel & supply depot.<ref name=\"Q-boats\"/>\n\nWhen all the troops and non-essential personnel were safely shuttled off, he ordered all remaining boats to start loading the full fuel canisters on board to be dropped off at a friendly port.  The fuel was mainly used for sea duty's Q-boats to remain functional since they didn't know where another fuel depot would be located. He coordinated the incoming and outgoing boats for the fuel removal, when the perimeter guards warned by relaying that the Japanese were approaching their security perimeter. He ordered all of them to withdraw along with the entire harbor personnel to evacuate in any available boats.  Since most of the docked boats were loaded with extra fuel tanks, the remaining harbor personnel had to sit on top of them as they departed. Liwanag along with several Q-boats remained and waited for all the volunteer perimeter guards to arrive. They all came running in and immediately jumped onto the boats, saying the Japanese were behind them only by several minutes. He finally gave the order to activate the timed explosives for the destruction of the oil refinery tanks, facilities and harbor. As his boat departed, some the perimeter guards on board started firing at the direction of the Japanese to keep them at bay, but ordered them to cease fire to prevent the Japanese from locking onto their position from their weapon's muzzle fire flash which would endangering themselves further since they were all sitting on top of portable fuel tanks.  They used the night's darkness to conceal their departure with only the sounds of their boats motors indicating their departing presence.  The harbor's total destruction took place late during the night with their withdrawal punctuated by a tremendous explosions of the oil refinery tanks which was seen across the Manila Bay.<ref name=\"Q-boats\"/>\n\nHis unit was forced to surrender after the declaration was broadcast from the [[Malinta Tunnel]] in Corregidor through the Voice of Freedom, for all USAFFE forces immediate surrender to the Japanese.  At that point his unit was low on ammunition and fuel getting scarce, since they had been cut off from additional supplies and reinforcements by better trained and equipped, front-line Japanese forces.  They surrendered in [[Nasugbu, Batangas]] on April 9, 1942 while transferring evacuating troops by boat from a withdrawal point off the most southern point of Bataan.  Before they turned themselves over to the Japanese, he ordered the immediate destruction of their boats once they docked, which some burned from lighting the portable fuel tanks and shot out the bottoms to sink them. When the Japanese questioned the boats location, he said they are still in Nasugbu docks but failed to tell them the boats' fate.  He was transferred by trucks along with his unit to [[San Fernando, Pampanga]], then crammed to standing room in train box cars as the Japanese overloaded them to more than double its capacity to [[Capas, Tarlac]]. Once they were offloaded in Capas, they marched the last three kilometers to the internment camp to be detained as [[prisoners of war|POWs]].<ref>[http://www.batch2006.com/visit_camp_o-donnell_tarlac.htm Capas National Shrine], Camp O'Donnell Memorial Site - Capas, Tarlac, Philippines, Retrieved December 2010</ref>\n\nLiwanag was interned in [[Camp O'Donnell]] which was used as an internment camp for both American and Filipino [[prisoners of war]] in [[Capas, Tarlac]] from April 9 to August 4, 1942. The Japanese occupying force released a small number of Philippine military personnel after going thru an \"rejuvenation program\" to return to civilian life, of which he was one of the fortunate few. Their aim was to integrate them back to society but kept some of them under Japanese surveillance by Filipino collaborators loyal to the Japanese in the hope they would lead them to any Allied dissident forces.  He witnessed several formerly released Philippine military personnel being picked up for suspicion of conspiracy against the Japanese. They were automatically returned to the POW camps or summarily executed.  Under the scrutiny then he be might under surveillance, he couldn't return to his family for fear of endangering them by using them as leverage against him.  He did not acknowledge any one of his civilian friends who recognized him, knowing that the Japanese might interrogate them.  One of his friends knew the predicament he was in and notified the family of his whereabouts, which at that time believed he was still interned in Camp O'Donnell.  Liwanag's wife doubted their friend that the Japanese were releasing Filipino military personnel, until she travelled to Capas and confirmed it on a posted form on the POW camp bulletin board of the 1,400 prisoners that were released.<ref>Diary Entry: August 5, 1942, [http://filipinos-ww2usmilitaryservice.tripod.com/id63.html War Diary of Commodore Ramon Alcaraz], Maritime Review, March 09, 2007, Retrieved August 05, 2011</ref>  As a PMA officer, he was still oblated to his oath to duty. He would discreetly gather intelligence on Japanese positions, personnel, equipment and strength in the Manila vicinity.  Knowing that the US General [[Douglas MacArthur]] would return from Australia, the information will be useful in the re-take of Manila and its surrounding towns.\n\nOnce the U.S. Forces returned to the Philippines and started driving back the Japanese forces, he sought out to rejoin the Allied forces but was recognized by a fellow POW whom he had been interned with that had connections to the guerrilla forces.  With their help, they both got back to Allied hands. Liwanag was processed and placed back in the USAFFE and reinstated to his rank of first lieutenant on January 28, 1945.  What was left of his Offshore Patrol unit was mainly dismantled by the Japanese, the main portion were still interned in [[Camp O'Donnell]] and other POW camps, the unit's boats were scuttled or burned so Japanese forces won't possess them.  Only a small group of surviving personnel of the Offshore Patrol - sea duty units, conducted guerrilla hit-and-run attacks.  With the enemy intelligence he gathered along with his knowledge of the layout of Manila, he was assigned to assist U.S. Army and USAFFE Army infantry units preparing to enter the city. Five days later, he fought alongside the U.S. Army and USAFFE Army units that he guided in the [[Battle of Manila (1945)|liberation of Manila]].\n\nAfter the Japanese were removed from Manila, Liwanag and surviving USAFFE OSP officers were in charge in rebuilding the Offshore Patrol Unit to continue with their duties of securing the country's sea and shores.\n\n===After World War II===\nAfter the war, he was promoted to the rank of an USAFFE captain on March 11, 1946.  The USAFFE was disbanded as the Philippines won its independence from the United States on June 30, 1946.  In July 1946, Liwanag returned to his old unit, which changed into the newly formed Philippine Naval Patrol and was reactivated to the promoted naval rank as a [[lieutenant commander]].  The [[President of the Philippines]] [[Manuel Roxas]] strengthened the Offshore Patrol after issuing Executive Order No. 94 on October 5, 1947. This order officially elevated the patrol to a major command that was equal to the other branches of the armed forces, which is now the [[Philippine Navy]]. The [[Offshore Patrol|OSP]] was renamed the Philippine Naval Patrol (PNP), later on it changed into the Philippine Navy on January 5, 1951.  Liwanag and fellow surviving OSP officers became the early pioneers that helped shaped the structure of the Philippine Navy.\n\n===Korean War===\n\n==== 10th BCT PEFTOK ====\n\nLiwanag was part of the [[Philippine Expeditionary Forces To Korea]] (PEFTOK), the Philippine combat contingent of the United Nations forces that was deployed to Korea.  As the only Philippine naval officer to volunteer to the army's combat contingent, he was assigned to the [[Philippine Expeditionary Forces To Korea#10th Battalion Combat Team (BCT)|10th Battalion Combat Team]] (BCT) - Motorized, Philippine Army - United Nations Command (UNC) as a navy lieutenant commander<ref>[http://www.philippinepeacekeepers.ph/?args=Registry&kstr=emilio+liwanag&mode=1 Veterans' Registry - Liwanag], Philippine Peacekeepers Website, April 30, 2010.

The PEFTOK units were the first combat units to participate overseas under the newly formed Philippine Republic.  They landed in Busan, Korea on September 19, 1950 along with 1,303 enlisted men and 64 officers who were transported by US Navy transport vessel,<ref>[http://www.philembassy-seoul.com/dafa.asp  Embassy of the Republic of the Philippines (Seoul, Korea)], Defense & Armed Forces Attach\u00e9, 2007-08, Retrieved August 15, 2011</ref> [[USNS Sgt. Sylvester Antolak (T-AP-192)]]. The PEFTOK was the 8th foreign country after the Americans and the [[27th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|27th British Commonwealth Infantry Brigade]] (consisting of units from the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India and 2 battalions from Hong Kong.)  Most of the Filipino battalion were combat veterans who fought the Japanese Imperial Army either as a regular soldier or guerrilla. Some of the veterans has experience in fighting with a communist force, especially during the [[Hukbalahap Rebellion]] in the Philippines. The 10th BCT was first attached to and provided support for the American [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]].\n\nThe battalion had to deal with some immediate setbacks upon their arrival in the port of Busan, they have no winter weather clothing and no armor available for them.  The cold weather of winter was a shock to almost all in the Filipino combat unit since the Philippines is a tropical island nation. They weren't prepared for the weather difference plus the lack of winter gear that was supposed to be available to them on their arrival. The 10th was Philippines' only armored tank battalion at the time, consisting of three rifle companies, a medium tank company, a reconnaissance company equipped with light tanks and a field artillery battery.  They were equipped with a company of 29 [[M4 Sherman]] medium tanks and a company of [[M5 Stuart]] light tanks which all remained in the Philippines.  The Americans were to supply the 10th with surplus tanks consisting of 17 M4 Shermans and one [[M10 tank destroyer]] which was awaiting for them in Korea.  Unfortunately during the UN Command withdrawal from the [[Battle of Pusan Perimeter]], their tanks were destroyed before they saw combat.<ref>3rd paragraph [http://www.reocities.com/peftok/10thbct.html PEFTOK - 10th BCT Website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005121020/http://www.reocities.com/peftok/10thbct.html |date=2012-10-05 }}, 2000, Retrieved August 2011.</ref>  For several days since their landing, they received no word from the Americans when or if they will receive replacement armor.  The 10th battalion commanders and staff were wondering what to do with the two tankless companies once the battalion were assigned to a mission from the Americans, since most of the armor personnel were lightly armed.  As the battalion Logistic officer, Liwanag took it upon himself to rectify their precarious dilemma.  With the working knowledge how the U.S. Army's logistic supply system functions during Second World War, he knew where he can get the supplies directly to bypass the long chain of bureaucratic red-tape.  He requested the battalion commanders, Lt. Col. Mariano Azurin<ref>[http://www.philippinepeacekeepers.ph/?args=Registry&kstr=Mariano+Azurin&mode=1  Veterans' Registry - Azurin], Philippine Peacekeepers Website, April 30, 2010.

Yap to accompany him to the [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]] headquarters to see what they have available at their supply depot.\n\nWhen they arrived to the 25th Division HQ, it was a beehive of activity as they were coordinating to secure their sector of the UN battleline.  After explaining directly to the American HQ commanders of the 10th situation, they gave him free rein in the division's supply depot and motor pool to take whatever Major Liwanag needed.  Without conferring to his battalion commanders on items they had on hand, he secured the items on site that were available before they were requisitioned to another unit.  When he returned, to the surprise of everyone in the battalion, he was able to secure seven [[M24 Chaffee]]<ref>Villahermosa, Gilberto N., pg. 104, [http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/korea/65Inf_Korea/index.html Honor and Fidelity: The 65th Infantry in Korea, 1950-1953], (2009), Washington, D.C.: United States Army Center of Military History, Retrieved August 5, 2011</ref> light tanks as their only replacement armor, and riding behind them were several more truckloads of brand new heavy weapons ranging from machine guns of different variants, bazookas, grenades and mortars - along with more ammunition for the entire battalion's needs. There were no available spare Shermans, as all replacement tanks would take several weeks to be shipped in from the US mainland.  Along with the trucks carried all the battalion's new winter clothing and gear, which was his first priority items to secure. The Recon Company received the Chaffees, which was a far better light tank compared to their under-gunned, slow, obsolete M5 Stuarts. All the truckloads of new heavy weaponry he collected went to the tankless Tank Company which he reorganize them as a Heavy Weapons Company, which the battalion commander and the Tank Company's commander, Captain Conrado D. Yap,<ref>Medal of Valor Awardees [http://www.army.mil.ph/VALOR_AWARDEE/yap.html], Philippine Army Website, 2007. Retrieved October 2012.</ref> approved to Liwanag's re-assessment.  Near the city of [[Miryang]], the battalion spent about two weeks of pre-combat training with their new equipment and their change of combat duties, namely the Heavy Weapons Company.  Liwanag became directly responsible in the transition of reshaping the new company and closely working together with Capt. Yap, made sure that his newly reassigned company functions smoothly.\n\n==== Battle of Yultong ====\n\nOn April 22 & 23, the 10th BCT was deployed 5 kilometers north of [[Yeoncheon]] amid the Chinese Spring Offensive.  The battalion was moved to the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]] to reinforce its ranks, which the Chinese 44th Division offensive was to conduct echelons of night attacks to overrun the 10th's hill position.  The Filipino battalion was heavily outnumbered 17 to 1 and surrounded, which made every Filipino, from cooks to drivers, to take up arms and fight. Liwanag was the senior artillery officer assigned to lead the field artillery battalion, which was his first artillery command since recently graduating from artillery school. He provided close artillery support using their six 105mm howitzers to reduce the Chinese numbers who approached their hill positions.  They succeeded in holding their ground from the Chinese, which allowed the withdrawal of allied friendly forces, and continued to hold their ground until they were given the order for their own to withdraw.  The battle was known as the [[Battle of Yultong]], which became the largest battle that Philippine troops participated in during the Korean War and was widely known as their bravest stand during the conflict. For their actions, Tank Company, the company which Liwanag re-tasked, assisted in their training, and provided their weaponry, was decorated the [[Non-U.S. recipients of U.S. gallantry awards#UN Forces in the Chinese Spring Offensive|US Gallantry Award]].\n\nThe 10th BCT earned its unit's name, \"The Fighting Filipinos\" later called \"The Fighting Tenth\". They continued to serve until September 27, 1951 when they were replaced by the [[Philippine Expeditionary Forces To Korea#20th Battalion Combat Team (BCT)|20th BCT]]. The battalion's total casualty count for the war was 43 KIA, 9 MIA, 58 captured. His unit stayed 398 days in Korea and returned to Manila on October 23 to a euphoric hero's welcome.\n\n==== Military attach\u00e9 ====\n\nLiwanag and several veterans of the 10th BCT decided to extend their combat tour instead of returning home. The Army veterans were reassigned to the 20th BCT, while he was returned to the Philippine Navy in the Korean campaign.  Liwanag was assigned as the senior naval advisor to the Philippine Diplomatic Representative for the Philippine Embassy, along with the additional duty of being the Philippine Liaison Officer to [[United Nations Command (Korea)|United Nations Command]] Headquarters in Tokyo, Japan.  On July 5, 1951, he was promoted to the rank of [[Commander]].\n\nOn October 7, 1952, Liwanag was decorated with the [[Legion of Merit]] by Maj. Gen. [[Blackshear M.

It read in part:\n\n<blockquote>Applying his keen judgment and professional experience, Commander Liwanag formulated plans for the logistical support and efficient integration of Philippine forces into the [[Korean War]].

Liwanag was chosen as the overall commander throughout phases II and III of the naval exercise Operation \"Bulwark One\" or Exercise\n\"Bulwark\", a harbor defense maneuver sponsored jointly by the [[Philippine Navy]] and [[US Navy]].  The naval operation was the first US-Philippine joint exercise since the Philippines' liberation (1946).  Its purpose was to acquaint and promote the close working relationship of the US Navy and the Philippine Navy in the defense of Philippine harbors.  The exercise was significant in that the ability of a nation to last in a war of any kind, whether nuclear or conventional, would depend upon its ability to protect its shipping life-lines.\n\nFor the first time in any joint US-Philippine exercise, all US Navy units during phase II and III was placed under the overall command of a Philippine Navy senior officer, Capt. Emilio Liwanag. According to Lt. Gen Alfonso Arellano, [[List of AFP Chiefs of Staff|AFP Chief of Staff]] (1956\u20131957), he hailed the designation of Liwanag, pointing out that it was the first time that a Filipino officer was chosen to head a vital and big military exercise in which a foreign contingent was participating.  Selection of Liwanag, Arellano said, shows only too well the proficiency of the Filipino soldier and the degree of respect and admiration with which he is held by his counterparts abroad.<ref name=\"Manila Times, 1958\"/>\n\nThe exercise was broken down in three different phases in a three-month period:\n\n==== Phase I (Jan. 8) ====\nThis stage of the exercise, which involves the shore training of participants on techniques and procedures in harbor defense at the base in [[Cavite]].  Fifty-six PN officers and three hundred enlisted men had a two-week classroom instruction course on harbor defense to be followed by another two weeks of practical training under competent Filipino and American instructors from [[Cavite Navy Yard]] and [[US Naval Base Subic Bay]].  After their training, these PN officers and sailors would form the nucleus of the country's first post-war harbor defense unit.<ref name=\"Manila Times, 1958\">\"PN Man Heads Sea Maneuvers\", Manila Times, Jan. 9, 1958</ref>\n\n==== Phase II (Feb. 6\u201315) ====\nConsist of drills at the [[Corregidor]] and [[Caballo Island|Caballo]] areas and establishment of a Harbor Defense Command Center.  This stage practices operations against enemy air and sub-surface attackers along with protecting friendly shipping lanes.  The tactical importance of this phase of this exercise was that in case of a real emergency, Corregidor may be fortified to protect the entire harbor of Manila.  The addition of radar, sonar and other harbor defense equipment was set up on Corregidor to improve and upgrade the Harbor defenses, which was provided by the US Navy.<ref>\"The Rock is still Defense Bastion\", Manila Times, February 20, 1958.</ref>\n\n==== Phase III (March 19\u201322) ====\nThe actual firing phase where the US-Philippine Navy participant-units focus on Harbor defense operations to protect friendly shipping off Corregidor.  This included mine laying operations, surface and underwater detection with radar, sonar, spotting towers and anti-aircraft action. They simulated attacks from a submarine, a disguised merchant ship and an air attack around Corregidor and Caballo islands area.  Eight assorted PN vessels and Harbor defense unit will staved off an actual attack of enemy forces played by seven US naval vessels including a submarine.  The [[Philippine Air Force]] contributed friendly and enemy forces of [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustangs]] and [[North American F-86 Sabre|F-86 Sabre]] jets.<ref>\"PI-US War Games Slated\", Manila Times, Jan. 09, 1958.</ref>\n\n==== Conclusion ====\nThe naval exercise was successful in giving valuable operational training in harbor defense and mine warfare to the participating units and promoted closer working relations among the Philippine Navy, Air Force and the US Navy.  This benchmarked some milestones for the Philippine Forces for being the first US-Philippine bilateral harbor defense maneuvers held in the Philippines since the liberation.  The first activation of the country's Harbor Defense Unit, and the first Filipino senior officer to command a combined exercise.\n\nThe exercise involved fifteen US and Philippine naval vessels: the US Navy provided picket boats, minesweepers - {{USS|Fortify|AM-446|2}}, {{USS|Inflict|AM-456|2}} and {{USS|Engage|MSO-433|2}}, a submarine - {{USS|Capitaine|SS-336}}, aircraft - namely two [[Martin PBM Mariner|Martin PBM patrol bombers]], several amphibious vehicles ([[Landing Vehicle Tracked|LVT-4]]) and harbor defense units.  The Philippine Navy provided minesweepers, coast guard crafts (CGC)s, a patrol craft - RPS ''Cebu'' (currently [[BRP Cebu (PS-28)|BRP ''Cebu'' (PS-28)]] which was later reclassified as a corvette-class under the [[Philippine Navy|PN]]) and signal check stations on Corregidor.  The [[Philippine Air Force]] provided four squadrons consisting of eight P-51 Mustangs, four F-86 Sabre jets, four [[Grumman HU-16 Albatross|HU-16 Albatross]] amphibious flying boats and helicopter rescue teams.<ref>\"Operation Bulwark set Friday\", Manila Times, March 20, 1958</ref>\n\nThe success also led to the procurement of equipment used by the US Navy for this exercise.  US military observers which included [[Joseph H. Harper|Maj. Gen.

Initially, Gavin lives with his parents, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Pam Shipman|Pam]] and [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Mick Shipman|Mick]], and spends most of his time with his best friend, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Neil \"Smithy\" Smith|Smithy]]. Stacey lives with her widowed mother, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Gwen West|Gwen]], and is frequently visited by her uncle, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Bryn West|Bryn]], who lives across the road, and by her best friend [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Nessa Jenkins|Nessa]].\nThe series follows the key moments in their relationship: their first meeting, meeting each other's families, getting engaged, marrying, looking for a flat, briefly splitting up, looking for new jobs and trying for children.\n\nThe characters of Gavin and Stacey provide the emotional core of the story. The show focuses on the situations that arise when their relationship brings their two differing families together. As a result, episodes often focus on the key events in life that bring wider families and close friends together such as weddings, christenings, birthday parties and Christmases. However, the show also presents the families interacting in deliberately non-dramatic situations, such as a visit to the beach and nights out.\n\nA significant second storyline follows the contrasting relationship between Smithy and Nessa. Despite their dislike for each other, they have several one-night stands, leading to Nessa becoming pregnant and having their baby. Whilst Gavin and Stacey are the clear main characters, towards the end of the show's run, the dramatic emphasis switches slightly from them, as they resolve their distance issues, to Smithy and Nessa, as Nessa becomes engaged to another man.\n\nOther storylines that run throughout the course of the three series include Pam's fake [[vegetarian]]ism, Bryn and his nephew [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Jason West|Jason]]'s struggle to keep the events of their disastrous fishing trip a secret (with the outcome never actually being revealed), and the ridiculously rocky marriage of Pam's friends [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Pete Sutcliffe|Pete]] and [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Dawn Sutcliffe|Dawn]].\n\n==Characters and cast==\n{{further|List of Gavin & Stacey characters}}The surnames of known English [[serial killers]] were used for some of the main characters \u2013 [[Harold Shipman]], [[Fred West]] and [[Peter Sutcliffe]].<ref name=\"surnames2\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/cardiff-confidential-saying-farewell-to-gavin-amp-stacey-1824969.html|title=Cardiff confidential: Saying farewell to Gavin & Stacey|date=21 November 2009|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=4 February 2011}}</ref> [[Ruth Jones (actress)|Ruth Jones]] commented in 2009: \"I suppose we were hoping that people wouldn't realise and then when it does come to light, it's even more delicious...\"<ref name=\"surnames3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heatworld.com/Entertainment/TV/2009/01/Victims-families-complain-about-Gavin--Stacey-serial-killer-names/|title=Victims' families complain about Gavin & Stacey serial killer names|date=2 January 2009|publisher=Heat Magazine|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812030230/http://www.heatworld.com/Entertainment/TV/2009/01/Victims-families-complain-about-Gavin--Stacey-serial-killer-names/|archive-date=12 August 2012|accessdate=4 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Main===\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 170\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = James Corden 2014.jpg\n| caption1  = \n| image2    = Ruth Jones Little Britain Gavin and Stacey.jpg\n| alt2      = \n| caption2 = [[James Corden]] and [[Ruth Jones]], co-writers and stars of the show\n}}\n\n* '''Gavin Shipman''' ([[Mathew Horne]]) \u2013 nicknamed \"Gavlar\", or \"Gavalar\", the funny and enthusiastic level-headed protagonist from [[Billericay]], [[Essex]].\n* '''Stacey Shipman''' (''n\u00e9e'' West) ([[Joanna Page]]) \u2013 bubbly protagonist from [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]].\n* '''Neil \"Smithy\" Smith''' ([[James Corden]]) \u2013 Gavin's oldest and closest friend, who also lives in Billericay, Essex.

Gavin is 28 and lives at home in [[Billericay]], [[Essex]], with his parents, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Mick Shipman|Mick]] ([[Larry Lamb]]) and [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Pam Shipman|Pam]] ([[Alison Steadman]]). He and Stacey, along with their respective best friends [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Neil \"Smithy\" Smith|Neil \"Smithy\" Smith]] ([[James Corden]]) and [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Nessa Jenkins|Nessa Jenkins]] ([[Ruth Jones (actress)|Ruth Jones]]), go out on a double date. The night ends with Gavin and Stacey returning to a hotel room and sleeping together, as do Smithy and Nessa. Gavin and Stacey become infatuated with each other, but Smithy and Nessa are happy to forget their drunken [[one-night stand]] and make little contact with one another afterwards. In the rest of the series, Gavin and Stacey continue their long-distance relationship before becoming engaged and getting married on 6 April 2007. The series ends with Nessa going to inform Smithy that she is pregnant with his child but changes her mind at the last minute.\n\n===Series 2 (2008)===\nThe second series begins with the newlyweds arriving from a honeymoon in Greece. The in-laws meet again at the Shipmans' house in Essex, where Nessa has some shocking revelations&nbsp;\u2013 especially for Smithy, who learns that she is pregnant with his baby, and although he makes it clear he thoroughly dislikes the woman, he is generally civil and supportive towards her about their child. Meanwhile, Gavin and Stacey, living at Pam and Mick's house, run into trouble when Stacey struggles to find a job and becomes home-sick for Barry and her family. The couple try to overcome their problem by looking for an apartment or house in Essex, but Stacey is still dissatisfied and is considering moving back to South Wales to be with her family. In the final episode of the series, Stacey takes off her wedding ring, much to the upset of Gavin, but this is interrupted by the news of Nessa unexpectedly going into labour a month early. Pam, Mick and Stacey hurry across to Wales, whilst Gavin rushes to find Smithy with Smithy's sister, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Rudi Smith|Rudi]] ([[Sheridan Smith]]), eventually finding him in the pub watching football. They arrive to find that Nessa has given birth to a boy, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Neil, the baby|Neil]]. Gavin and Stacey decide to put their differences aside and are together once again.\n\n===Christmas special (2008)===\nAn extended Christmas special involves Stacey's family, along with Nessa and her partner, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Dave Coaches|Dave Coaches]] ([[Steffan Rhodri]]), spending Christmas with Gavin's parents. Gavin reveals that he has found a job in Cardiff, which at first causes upset for Pam and Smithy, but they both learn to accept it. Gavin later admits to Smithy that he is moving to Barry with Stacey in order to save his marriage. Smithy also gets upset when he feels that Dave, who lives with the baby, Neil, is replacing him as a father. Smithy is furthermore unhappy after Dave proposes to Nessa (with the ring enclosed in a cigarette packet), and she accepts.\n\n===Series 3 (2009\u20132010)===\nGavin begins on his new job in Wales and his parents and Smithy travel to Wales for Neil's christening. In the next episode Gavin and Stacey, and Nessa and her child Neil, spend the weekend at Pam and Mick's, and after a drunken night, it is believed that Nessa and Smithy may have once again had sex after waking up in bed together the next morning. Gavin and Stacey begin trying for a baby and Stacey is upset and disappointed when she learns that they may not be able to have children. Gavin becomes depressed and preoccupied with this issue, and in an attempt to cheer him up, Pam, Mick and Smithy arrange a surprise trip to Barry beach on a sunny bank holiday. Nessa and Dave also run into trouble after Dave learns about her alleged sexual intercourse with Smithy, but the two decide to go ahead with the wedding. In the final episode, Stacey discovers she is pregnant after all, and the couple are overjoyed and excited. Smithy shows up at Nessa and Dave's wedding ceremony with Neil, pleading for her not to marry him, and accusing her of not loving Dave. Dave, much to everyone's surprise, agrees with Smithy that Nessa does not love him, and the ceremony is called off. The series ends showing the four (Gavin, Stacey, Nessa and Smithy) six months later on Barry beachfront, with a visibly pregnant Stacey.\n\n===Christmas special  (2019)===\nIn May 2019, Corden announced that he and Jones had written a Christmas special. The programme aired on BBC One on 25 December 2019. The episode started off with Gavin and Stacey, who now have three children, and are living in Barry next door to Stacey's mum after Doris - who died several years before - left them the property in her will. Nessa and Smithy's child, Neil (known as \"Neil, the Baby\u201d) is now eleven. Smithy has started a new relationship with Sonia ([[Laura Aikman]]) and he plans to propose to her on Christmas Day. Gwen, Bryn & Jason join together to celebrate the holiday, together with Pam and Mick, who spent Christmas Eve with Dawn and Pete. At the end of the episode, Nessa tells Smithy that she loves him, and she [[Marriage proposal|proposes]].\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Brydon.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Rob Brydon]] plays Uncle Bryn]]\n[[File:You'll Have Had Your Tea - Alison Steadman.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Alison Steadman]] plays Pam Shipman]]\n\nThe idea for the show occurred to actor [[James Corden]] during a wedding reception, and he then developed the idea with co-writer [[Ruth Jones (actress)|Ruth Jones]], whom he had met during the filming of ITV drama ''[[Fat Friends]]''. Corden claims to have been inspired by the story of his own real life best friend Gavin, who met his wife over the phone at work, and arranged to meet. They presented it to the BBC as a one-off play entitled It's My Day, but the BBC instead asked for a full series.<ref name=Times06March2008USRemake>{{cite news|last=Sherwin|first=Adam|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article3495129.ece|title=Gavin & Stacey to be given US remake|newspaper=The Times | date = 6 March 2008 | accessdate = 6 March 2008 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nThe roles of Gavin and Stacey were cast through an auditioning process, but were almost immediately given to [[Mathew Horne]] and [[Joanna Page]] on the strength of their chemistry together. The roles of Nessa and Smithy were written by Corden and Jones for themselves. Some roles were written with certain actors in mind; Uncle Bryn was written specifically for [[Rob Brydon]], who had been to school with Jones, whilst Pam was written specifically for [[Alison Steadman]], who had also worked on ''Fat Friends''. Jones had worked with Julia Davis in her sitcom ''[[Nighty Night]]'', and the role of Dawn was written with her in mind. Additionally, Corden had appeared with [[Adrian Scarborough]] in the Alan Bennett-penned play and film, ''[[The History Boys]]'', which led to him being cast in the role of Pete. An audition process was used to cast the roles of Mick and Gwen, whilst the roles of Gavin's friends were given to Corden's co-stars in ''The History Boys''.\n\nAlthough the programme is set in [[Billericay]], [[Essex]], and [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]], [[Vale of Glamorgan]], the three series were shot largely in [[Cardiff]] (which acted as the city itself but also as parts of Billericay), and also in Barry itself and the surrounding area, including [[Dinas Powys]], [[Sully, Vale of Glamorgan|Sully]] and [[Penarth]]. The show's popularity has been credited with boosting the tourist trade to Barry and its popular seafront of [[Barry Island]], through visitors wishing to visit the various filming locations.\nGavin's house was set in Billericay but was actually filmed on location in Laburnum Way, Dinas Powys in Wales. The opening episode features location shooting in [[Leicester Square]] in London which was filmed in 2006.\n<ref name=BarryTraders>{{cite web |url=http://www.barryanddistrictnews.co.uk/news/latestnews/4837541.Barry_Island_traders___We_must_make_the_most_of_Gavin___Stacey_/ | title=Barry Island traders: 'We must make the most of Gavin & Stacey' |date=9 January 2010 |accessdate=16 January 2010 |publisher=Newsquest |work=Barry and District News}}</ref><ref name=BBCTownPlansTrail>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/7405307.stm | title=Town plans Gavin and Stacey trail |date=18 May 2008 |accessdate=16 January 2010 |work=BBC News}}</ref><ref name=WesternMailNewYearsDayHit>{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/showbiz/2010/01/04/gavin-and-stacey-a-new-year-s-day-hit-91466-25520204/ | title=Gavin and Stacey a New Year's Day hit |date=4 January 2010 |accessdate=16 January 2010 |publisher=Western Mail}}</ref>\n\nAfter the debut of the show on BBC Three, a second series was soon commissioned. Speaking about the second series, Corden said \"It's the show that we wanted to make. If people like it, they like it: if they don't, they don't. That's a nice feeling, that's quite freeing... There's more of a journey and more of a story. We hope the viewers will feel like they've been taken on a little trip by it\", while Jones said \"Series one had a very specific storyline to it, boy meets girl and it ends in a wedding. We don't have the same type of storyline in the second series.

In an April 2008 interview, Jones said \"We never intended to write a second series let alone a third. We don't want it to become predictable.

Initially, Gavin lives with his parents, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Pam Shipman|Pam]] and [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Mick Shipman|Mick]], and spends most of his time with his best friend, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Neil \"Smithy\" Smith|Smithy]]. Stacey lives with her widowed mother, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Gwen West|Gwen]], and is frequently visited by her uncle, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Bryn West|Bryn]], who lives across the road, and by her best friend [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Nessa Jenkins|Nessa]].\nThe series follows the key moments in their relationship: their first meeting, meeting each other's families, getting engaged, marrying, looking for a flat, briefly splitting up, looking for new jobs and trying for children.\n\nThe characters of Gavin and Stacey provide the emotional core of the story. The show focuses on the situations that arise when their relationship brings their two differing families together. As a result, episodes often focus on the key events in life that bring wider families and close friends together such as weddings, christenings, birthday parties and Christmases. However, the show also presents the families interacting in deliberately non-dramatic situations, such as a visit to the beach and nights out.\n\nA significant second storyline follows the contrasting relationship between Smithy and Nessa. Despite their dislike for each other, they have several one-night stands, leading to Nessa becoming pregnant and having their baby. Whilst Gavin and Stacey are the clear main characters, towards the end of the show's run, the dramatic emphasis switches slightly from them, as they resolve their distance issues, to Smithy and Nessa, as Nessa becomes engaged to another man.\n\nOther storylines that run throughout the course of the three series include Pam's fake [[vegetarian]]ism, Bryn and his nephew [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Jason West|Jason]]'s struggle to keep the events of their disastrous fishing trip a secret (with the outcome never actually being revealed), and the ridiculously rocky marriage of Pam's friends [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Pete Sutcliffe|Pete]] and [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Dawn Sutcliffe|Dawn]].\n\n==Characters and cast==\n{{further|List of Gavin & Stacey characters}}The surnames of known English [[serial killers]] were used for some of the main characters \u2013 [[Harold Shipman|Shipman]], [[Fred West|West]] and [[Peter Sutcliffe|Sutcliffe]].<ref name=\"surnames2\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/cardiff-confidential-saying-farewell-to-gavin-amp-stacey-1824969.html|title=Cardiff confidential: Saying farewell to Gavin & Stacey|date=21 November 2009|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=4 February 2011}}</ref> [[Ruth Jones (actress)|Ruth Jones]] commented in 2009: \"I suppose we were hoping that people wouldn't realise and then when it does come to light, it's even more delicious...\"<ref name=\"surnames3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heatworld.com/Entertainment/TV/2009/01/Victims-families-complain-about-Gavin--Stacey-serial-killer-names/|title=Victims' families complain about Gavin & Stacey serial killer names|date=2 January 2009|publisher=Heat Magazine|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812030230/http://www.heatworld.com/Entertainment/TV/2009/01/Victims-families-complain-about-Gavin--Stacey-serial-killer-names/|archive-date=12 August 2012|accessdate=4 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Main===\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 170\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = James Corden 2014.jpg\n| caption1  = \n| image2    = Ruth Jones Little Britain Gavin and Stacey.jpg\n| alt2      = \n| caption2 = [[James Corden]] and [[Ruth Jones]], co-writers and stars of the show\n}}\n\n* '''Gavin Shipman''' ([[Mathew Horne]]) \u2013 nicknamed \"Gavlar\", or \"Gavalar\", the funny and enthusiastic level-headed protagonist from [[Billericay]], [[Essex]].\n* '''Stacey Shipman''' (''n\u00e9e'' West) ([[Joanna Page]]) \u2013 bubbly protagonist from [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]].\n* '''Neil \"Smithy\" Smith''' ([[James Corden]]) \u2013 Gavin's oldest and closest friend, who also lives in Billericay, Essex.

Gavin is 28 and lives at home in [[Billericay]], [[Essex]], with his parents, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Mick Shipman|Mick]] ([[Larry Lamb]]) and [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Pam Shipman|Pam]] ([[Alison Steadman]]). He and Stacey, along with their respective best friends [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Neil \"Smithy\" Smith|Neil \"Smithy\" Smith]] ([[James Corden]]) and [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Nessa Jenkins|Nessa Jenkins]] ([[Ruth Jones (actress)|Ruth Jones]]), go out on a double date. The night ends with Gavin and Stacey returning to a hotel room and sleeping together, as do Smithy and Nessa. Gavin and Stacey become infatuated with each other, but Smithy and Nessa are happy to forget their drunken [[one-night stand]] and make little contact with one another afterwards. In the rest of the series, Gavin and Stacey continue their long-distance relationship before becoming engaged and getting married on 6 April 2007. The series ends with Nessa going to inform Smithy that she is pregnant with his child but changes her mind at the last minute.\n\n===Series 2 (2008)===\nThe second series begins with the newlyweds arriving from a honeymoon in Greece. The in-laws meet again at the Shipmans' house in Essex, where Nessa has some shocking revelations&nbsp;\u2013 especially for Smithy, who learns that she is pregnant with his baby, and although he makes it clear he thoroughly dislikes the woman, he is generally civil and supportive towards her about their child. Meanwhile, Gavin and Stacey, living at Pam and Mick's house, run into trouble when Stacey struggles to find a job and becomes home-sick for Barry and her family. The couple try to overcome their problem by looking for an apartment or house in Essex, but Stacey is still dissatisfied and is considering moving back to South Wales to be with her family. In the final episode of the series, Stacey takes off her wedding ring, much to the upset of Gavin, but this is interrupted by the news of Nessa unexpectedly going into labour a month early. Pam, Mick and Stacey hurry across to Wales, whilst Gavin rushes to find Smithy with Smithy's sister, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Rudi Smith|Rudi]] ([[Sheridan Smith]]), eventually finding him in the pub watching football. They arrive to find that Nessa has given birth to a boy, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Neil, the baby|Neil]]. Gavin and Stacey decide to put their differences aside and are together once again.\n\n===Christmas special (2008)===\nAn extended Christmas special involves Stacey's family, along with Nessa and her partner, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Dave Coaches|Dave Coaches]] ([[Steffan Rhodri]]), spending Christmas with Gavin's parents. Gavin reveals that he has found a job in Cardiff, which at first causes upset for Pam and Smithy, but they both learn to accept it. Gavin later admits to Smithy that he is moving to Barry with Stacey in order to save his marriage. Smithy also gets upset when he feels that Dave, who lives with the baby, Neil, is replacing him as a father. Smithy is furthermore unhappy after Dave proposes to Nessa (with the ring enclosed in a cigarette packet), and she accepts.\n\n===Series 3 (2009\u20132010)===\nGavin begins on his new job in Wales and his parents and Smithy travel to Wales for Neil's christening. In the next episode Gavin and Stacey, and Nessa and her child Neil, spend the weekend at Pam and Mick's, and after a drunken night, it is believed that Nessa and Smithy may have once again had sex after waking up in bed together the next morning. Gavin and Stacey begin trying for a baby and Stacey is upset and disappointed when she learns that they may not be able to have children. Gavin becomes depressed and preoccupied with this issue, and in an attempt to cheer him up, Pam, Mick and Smithy arrange a surprise trip to Barry beach on a sunny bank holiday. Nessa and Dave also run into trouble after Dave learns about her alleged sexual intercourse with Smithy, but the two decide to go ahead with the wedding. In the final episode, Stacey discovers she is pregnant after all, and the couple are overjoyed and excited. Smithy shows up at Nessa and Dave's wedding ceremony with Neil, pleading for her not to marry him, and accusing her of not loving Dave. Dave, much to everyone's surprise, agrees with Smithy that Nessa does not love him, and the ceremony is called off. The series ends showing the four (Gavin, Stacey, Nessa and Smithy) six months later on Barry beachfront, with a visibly pregnant Stacey.\n\n===Christmas special  (2019)===\nIn May 2019, Corden announced that he and Jones had written a Christmas special. The programme aired on BBC One on 25 December 2019. The episode started off with Gavin and Stacey, who now have three children, and are living in Barry next door to Stacey's mum after Doris - who died several years before - left them the property in her will. Nessa and Smithy's child, Neil (known as \"Neil, the Baby\u201d) is now eleven. Smithy has started a new relationship with Sonia ([[Laura Aikman]]) and he plans to propose to her on Christmas Day. Gwen, Bryn & Jason join together to celebrate the holiday, together with Pam and Mick, who spent Christmas Eve with Dawn and Pete. At the end of the episode, Nessa tells Smithy that she loves him, and she [[Marriage proposal|proposes]].\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Brydon.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Rob Brydon]] plays Uncle Bryn]]\n[[File:You'll Have Had Your Tea - Alison Steadman.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Alison Steadman]] plays Pam Shipman]]\n\nThe idea for the show occurred to actor [[James Corden]] during a wedding reception, and he then developed the idea with co-writer [[Ruth Jones (actress)|Ruth Jones]], whom he had met during the filming of ITV drama ''[[Fat Friends]]''. Corden claims to have been inspired by the story of his own real life best friend Gavin, who met his wife over the phone at work, and arranged to meet. They presented it to the BBC as a one-off play entitled It's My Day, but the BBC instead asked for a full series.<ref name=Times06March2008USRemake>{{cite news|last=Sherwin|first=Adam|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article3495129.ece|title=Gavin & Stacey to be given US remake|newspaper=The Times | date = 6 March 2008 | accessdate = 6 March 2008 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nThe roles of Gavin and Stacey were cast through an auditioning process, but were almost immediately given to [[Mathew Horne]] and [[Joanna Page]] on the strength of their chemistry together. The roles of Nessa and Smithy were written by Corden and Jones for themselves. Some roles were written with certain actors in mind; Uncle Bryn was written specifically for [[Rob Brydon]], who had been to school with Jones, whilst Pam was written specifically for [[Alison Steadman]], who had also worked on ''Fat Friends''. Jones had worked with Julia Davis in her sitcom ''[[Nighty Night]]'', and the role of Dawn was written with her in mind. Additionally, Corden had appeared with [[Adrian Scarborough]] in the Alan Bennett-penned play and film, ''[[The History Boys]]'', which led to him being cast in the role of Pete. An audition process was used to cast the roles of Mick and Gwen, whilst the roles of Gavin's friends were given to Corden's co-stars in ''The History Boys''.\n\nAlthough the programme is set in [[Billericay]], [[Essex]], and [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]], [[Vale of Glamorgan]], the three series were shot largely in [[Cardiff]] (which acted as the city itself but also as parts of Billericay), and also in Barry itself and the surrounding area, including [[Dinas Powys]], [[Sully, Vale of Glamorgan|Sully]] and [[Penarth]]. The show's popularity has been credited with boosting the tourist trade to Barry and its popular seafront of [[Barry Island]], through visitors wishing to visit the various filming locations.\nGavin's house was set in Billericay but was actually filmed on location in Laburnum Way, Dinas Powys in Wales. The opening episode features location shooting in [[Leicester Square]] in London which was filmed in 2006.\n<ref name=BarryTraders>{{cite web |url=http://www.barryanddistrictnews.co.uk/news/latestnews/4837541.Barry_Island_traders___We_must_make_the_most_of_Gavin___Stacey_/ | title=Barry Island traders: 'We must make the most of Gavin & Stacey' |date=9 January 2010 |accessdate=16 January 2010 |publisher=Newsquest |work=Barry and District News}}</ref><ref name=BBCTownPlansTrail>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/7405307.stm | title=Town plans Gavin and Stacey trail |date=18 May 2008 |accessdate=16 January 2010 |work=BBC News}}</ref><ref name=WesternMailNewYearsDayHit>{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/showbiz/2010/01/04/gavin-and-stacey-a-new-year-s-day-hit-91466-25520204/ | title=Gavin and Stacey a New Year's Day hit |date=4 January 2010 |accessdate=16 January 2010 |publisher=Western Mail}}</ref>\n\nAfter the debut of the show on BBC Three, a second series was soon commissioned. Speaking about the second series, Corden said \"It's the show that we wanted to make. If people like it, they like it: if they don't, they don't. That's a nice feeling, that's quite freeing... There's more of a journey and more of a story. We hope the viewers will feel like they've been taken on a little trip by it\", while Jones said \"Series one had a very specific storyline to it, boy meets girl and it ends in a wedding. We don't have the same type of storyline in the second series.

In an April 2008 interview, Jones said \"We never intended to write a second series let alone a third. We don't want it to become predictable.

With its mainstream acceptance however, it was of the opinion that the show had all the ingredients to become an \"audience-pleasing family sitcom in the tradition of ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' and ''[[The Royle Family]]'' \u2013 churning out series after series and Christmas special after Christmas special\", although by then, the writers had already ruled out future full series.<ref name=\"IndependentSayingFarewell\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/cardiff-confidential-saying-farewell-to-gavin-amp-stacey-1824969.html|title=Cardiff confidential: Saying farewell to Gavin & Stacey|date=21 November 2009|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=3 May 2010|location=London}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, ''Gavin & Stacey'' was named the 17th greatest British sitcom of all time in a poll by ''[[Radio Times]]''.<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\"/>\n\n==International broadcasts and adaptations==\n''Gavin & Stacey'' has aired on [[BBC Entertainment]], [[BBC America]] and [[BBC Canada]] channels.
