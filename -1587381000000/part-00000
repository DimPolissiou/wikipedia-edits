The commissioner is chosen by a vote of the owners of the teams. The current commissioner is [[Rob Manfred]], who assumed office on January 25, 2015.\n\n== Origin of the office ==\nThe title \"commissioner\", which is a title now applied to the heads of several other major sports leagues as well as baseball, derives from its predecessor office, the National Commission. The National Commission was the ruling body of professional baseball starting with the National Agreement of 1903, which made peace between the [[National League]] and the [[American League]] (see [[History of baseball in the United States]]). It consisted of three members: the two League presidents and a Commission chairman, whose primary responsibilities were to preside at meetings and to mediate disputes. Although the Commission chairman [[August Herrmann]] was the nominal head of major league baseball, it was AL President [[Ban Johnson]] who dominated the Commission.\n\nThe event that would eventually lead to the appointment of a single Commissioner of Baseball was the [[Black Sox Scandal]] \u2014 perhaps the worst of a series of incidents in the late 1910s that jeopardized the integrity of the game. However, the motivations behind the creation of the Commissioner's office were more than the mere desire to rebuild public relations. The scandal had not only tarnished the image of baseball, but had brought relations between team owners and AL President Johnson to a breaking point. In particular, [[Chicago White Sox]] owner [[Charles Comiskey]] was incensed at what he perceived to be Johnson's indifference to his suspicions that the [[1919 World Series]] had been thrown. As a result, the National League, whose owners had never been on good terms with Johnson, agreed to invite the White Sox along with the [[Boston Red Sox]] and [[New York Yankees]] to join their league. The NL also unveiled plans to put a twelfth team in [[Detroit]].\n\nWith the American League's status as a major league and possibly its very existence suddenly in jeopardy, the five AL owners loyal to Johnson sued for peace. Eventually, at the urging of [[Detroit Tigers]] owner and Johnson loyalist [[Frank Navin]], a compromise was reached in late 1920 to reform the National Commission with a membership of non-baseball men.\n\n== Overview of commissioners ==\n\n=== Kenesaw Mountain Landis (1920\u20131944) ===\n[[File:Landis portrait-restored.png|thumb|right|upright|[[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]]]]\nHaving agreed to appoint only non-baseball men to the National Commission, the owners tapped federal judge [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]], an ardent baseball fan, to serve as the reformed commission's chairman.<ref name=\"blal\">{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=American_League|title=League American|publisher=Baseball Library|accessdate=2007-12-26|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080114000923/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=American_League|archivedate=2008-01-14}}</ref> Landis responded by declaring that he would only accept an appointment as sole commissioner, with nearly unlimited authority to act in the \"best interests of baseball\" \u2014 in essence, serving as an arbitrator whose decisions could not be appealed.  Finally, Landis insisted on a lifetime contract.  The owners, still reeling from the perception that the sport was crooked, readily agreed.\n\n==== Gambling ====\nLandis's first significant act was to deal with the Black Sox scandal. Following a trial, the eight players suspected of involvement in the fix were acquitted, including [[Buck Weaver]] and superstar [[Shoeless Joe Jackson]]. Nevertheless, immediately following the players' acquittal, Landis [[List of people banned from Major League Baseball|banned them all from baseball]] for life.  He famously declared, \"Regardless of the verdict of juries, no player who throws a ballgame, no player that undertakes or promises to throw a ballgame, no player that sits in conference with a bunch of crooked players and gamblers where the ways and means of throwing a game are discussed and does not promptly tell his club about it, will ever play professional baseball.\"<ref>http://www.sportshistorytoday.com/black-sox-banned-baseball-august-3-1921/</ref> Landis explained that even though the players had all been acquitted in court, there was no dispute that they had broken the rules of baseball.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Therefore, he maintained that none of them could be allowed back in the game if its image was to be restored with the public.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nOver the years, he dealt harshly with others proven to have thrown individual games, consorted with gamblers or engaged in actions that he felt tarnished the image of the game. Among the others he banned were [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] players [[Phil Douglas (baseball)|Phil Douglas]] and [[Jimmy O'Connell (baseball)|Jimmy O'Connell]], [[Philadelphia Phillies]] pitcher [[Gene Paulette]], Giants coach [[Cozy Dolan (1910s outfielder)|Cozy Dolan]], and (in 1943) Phillies owner [[William D. Cox]]. He also formalized the unofficial banishments of [[Hal Chase]] and [[Heinie Zimmerman]]. In 1921, he banned Giants center fielder [[Benny Kauff]] even though he had been acquitted of involvement in a car theft ring. Nonetheless, Landis was convinced Kauff was guilty and argued that players of \"undesirable reputation and character\" had no place in baseball.\n\n==== A fiercely independent Commissioner's Office ====\nThe owners had initially assumed that Landis would deal with the Black Sox Scandal and then settle into a comfortable retirement as the titular head of baseball. Instead, Landis ruled baseball with an iron hand for the next 25 years. He established a fiercely independent Commissioner's Office that would go on to often make both players and owners miserable with decisions that he argued were in the best interests of the game. He worked to clean up the hooliganism that was tarnishing the reputation of players in the 1920s, and inserted his office into negotiations with players, where he deemed appropriate, to end a few of the labor practices of owners like [[Charles Comiskey]] that had contributed to the players' discontent. He also personally approved broadcasters for the World Series.\n\nLandis's only significant rival in the early years was longtime American League founder and president [[Ban Johnson]], who had been reckoned as the most powerful man in the game before Landis's arrival.  Johnson was as strong-willed as Landis, and a clash between the two was inevitable.  It happened in the [[1924 World Series]]. When several Giants were implicated in a plan to bribe players on the moribund Phillies late in the season, Johnson demanded that the Series be canceled, and loudly criticized Landis's handling of the affair, to which Landis responded by threatening to resign. The American League owners promised to throw Johnson out of office if he stepped out of line again. [[1926 in baseball|Two years later]], when Johnson criticized Landis's decision to give [[Ty Cobb]] and [[Tris Speaker]] an amnesty after it surfaced they had bet on a fixed game in 1919, Landis told the American League owners to choose between him and Johnson.  The owners promptly sent Johnson on a sabbatical from which he never really returned.\n\n==== The baseball color line ====\nLandis perpetuated the [[baseball color line|color line]] and prolonged the segregation of organized baseball. His successor, [[Happy Chandler]], said, \"For twenty-four years Judge Landis wouldn't let a black man play. I had his records, and I read them, and for twenty-four years Landis consistently blocked any attempts to put blacks and whites together on a big league field.\"<ref>[http://baseballreader.tripod.com/id33.htm Bums: An Oral History of the Brooklyn Dodgers] by Peter Golenbock</ref> [[Bill Veeck]] claimed Landis prevented him from purchasing the Phillies when Landis learned of Veeck's plan to integrate the team. The signing of the first black ballplayer in the modern era, [[Jackie Robinson]], came less than a year after Landis's death on Chandler's watch and was engineered by one of Landis's old nemeses, [[Branch Rickey]]. Eleven weeks after Robinson's debut with the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]], Veeck became the first [[American League]] owner to break the color line.\n\n==== Curbing the growth of minor league farm systems ====\nLandis tried to curb the growth of [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] farm systems by innovators such as Rickey, in the name of protecting the lower levels of professional ball. Landis argued that because a parent club could unilaterally call up players from teams which were involved in pennant races, the organization was unfairly interfering with the minor competitions. His position was that the championship of each minor league was of no less importance than the championships of the major leagues, and that minor league fans and supporters had the right to see their teams competing as best they could.\n\nOn the other hand, Landis prevented the formation of a powerful third major league when he stopped [[Pants Rowland]] from upgrading the [[Pacific Coast League]] in the 1940s. Furthermore, (and despite the fact that, insofar as he was accountable at all, it was strictly to major league owners) Landis did not hesitate to aggressively use the powers of his office to force the minor leagues and their clubs to submit to his authority in a number of ways. Most notably, he uncompromisingly held to a policy that dictated any minor league player who knowingly played with or against a player banned by Major League Baseball would himself be banned from MLB for life. This threat effectively compelled every minor league to rigidly honor and enforce suspensions handed down by Landis in their competitions as well.  Nevertheless, some players banned by Landis are believed to have continued playing under assumed identities at the minor league or semi-professional level.\n\nOne of the schemes Landis vigorously fought was the effort by major-league teams to \"cover up\" players they were hiding in their farm systems. The term, not used in formal communications by league or team officials, referred to players clandestinely signed by a major-league team to a minor-league contract. Occasionally one team would serendipitously find such a player in the off-season draft, as in this occasion recorded in the book ''Dodger Daze and Knights'':\n\n<blockquote>\nAll the clubowners and managers, and Commissioner Landis, were assembled to conduct the draft. One team representative said he \"claim[s] Player [[Paul Richards (baseball)|[Paul] Richards]] of Brooklyn.\"\n\n\"You can't do that!\" barked a surprised [[Wilbert Robinson]], manager of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]].\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Landis.\n\n\"Because Brooklyn has him covered up\", sputtered Robbie.\n\nMost of the others broke down laughing. Even Landis smirked.\n</blockquote>\n\n==== Legacy and honors ====\nWhether his decisions were praised or criticized, he was satisfied with being respected and feared. Dubbed \"the baseball tyrant\" by journalists of the day, his rule was absolute. In the context of ensuring the integrity of the game itself, baseball historians generally regard him as the right man at the right time when appointed, but also as a man who perhaps held office too long.\n\nHe was elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1944|1944]], in a special election held one month after his death, and the [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player Award]] in each league is officially known as the Kenesaw Mountain Landis Award in his honor.\n\n=== Happy Chandler (1945\u20131951) ===\n[[File:Happy Chandler - Harris and Ewing Crop.jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[Happy Chandler]]]]\nWhen Judge Landis died in 1944, an official in the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] began campaigning for [[Happy Chandler]]'s election to the post. Despite being the last candidate put forth in the April [[1945 in baseball|1945]] meetings, he was elected by a unanimous vote of the team owners, and resigned his Senate seat in October of that year.<ref name=mlb>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/mlb_history_people.jsp?story=com_bio_2|title=Albert Benjamin \"Happy\" Chandler|publisher=Major League Baseball|accessdate=2007-01-30}}</ref>\n\nChandler clashed with [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] manager [[Leo Durocher|Leo \"the Lip\" Durocher]] over Durocher's association with gambling figures and his marriage to actress [[Laraine Day]], which came amid allegations from Day's ex-husband that Durocher had stolen her away from him.<ref name=rogers>{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Thomas|title=In Memory of Leo Durocher|url=http://www.astrosdaily.com/players/obits/Durocher_Leo.html|work=The New York Times|date=1991-10-08|accessdate=2007-06-06}}</ref> Before the start of the 1947 season, Chandler suspended Durocher for the entire season, citing \"conduct detrimental to baseball.\"<ref>{{cite news|first=Dick|last=Heller|title=Dodgers handled unrest to start '47|work=[[The Washington Times]]|date=2006-04-10}}</ref> The Dodgers went on to win the pennant that season under replacement manager [[Burt Shotton]].<ref name=rogers />\n\nChandler became known as \"the players' commissioner\" for his work on their behalf.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kosin|first=Phil|date=October 1985|title=Diamond Classics|journal=ABA Journal|volume=71|issue=10|page=35}}</ref> During his service, he presided over the establishment of a pension fund for players and oversaw the initial steps toward [[Racial integration|integration]] of the major leagues, beginning with the debut of [[Jackie Robinson]] with the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] in 1947. This move was controversial with team owners, who voted 15\u20131 against integrating the sport in a secret January 1947 meeting. The Dodgers' [[Branch Rickey]] met with Chandler, who agreed to back the team's move. Chandler's stance was credited by many in the sports community with Chandler's failure to be selected for another term as Commissioner after the expiration of his first one in [[1951 in baseball|1951]].<ref name=harrison>{{cite book|title=''Kentucky's Governors''|editor=[[Lowell H.

Chandler's attitude was a simple one, which he conveyed to Branch Rickey, and later recounted in his autobiography:<ref>{{cite web|first=Happy|last=Chandler|title=Chapter 1|url=http://www.bluegrassdaysneonnights.com/excerpt.html|publisher=Bluegrass Days, Neon Nights|accessdate=2009-07-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107025413/http://www.bluegrassdaysneonnights.com/excerpt.html|archivedate=January 7, 2009}}</ref>\n:\"I've already done a lot of thinking about this whole racial situation in our country. As a member of the Senate Military Affairs Committee, I got to know a lot about our casualties during the war. Plenty of Negro boys were willing to go out and fight and die for this country. Is it right when they came back to tell them they can't play the national pastime? You know, Branch, I'm going to have to meet my Maker some day. And if He asks me why I didn't let this boy play, and I say it's because he's black, that might not be a satisfactory answer.\n:If the Lord made some people black, and some white, and some red or yellow, he must have had a pretty good reason. It isn't my job to decide which colors can play big league baseball. It is my job to see that the game is fairly played and that everybody has an equal chance. I think if I do that, I can face my Maker with a clear conscience.\"\n\n=== Ford Frick (1951\u20131965) ===\n[[File:Ford Frick at 1937 All-Star Game (cropped and adjusted).jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[Ford Frick]]]]\nIn {{baseball year|1951}}, [[Ford Frick]] succeeded [[Happy Chandler]] as commissioner of baseball. Frick's critics accused him of favoring the NL in his rulings, such as how the 1960s expansion teams would be stocked.\n\nFrick's most highly criticized statement{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} as commissioner was made in 1961, when several players were on a pace to break [[Babe Ruth]]'s single-season home run record. In a press conference, Frick stated that the single-season home run record should be separated into multiple lists, based on length of season. However, as MLB did not publish an official record book at the time, Frick had no control on how publishers presented MLB records, and within a few years after [[Roger Maris]] broke Ruth's record, all record books gave Maris sole credit as the single-season home run record holder.<ref name=\"Salon-Maris\">{{cite web|last=Barra|first=Allen|title=The myth of Maris\u2019 asterisk|work=|publisher=Salon Media Group|date=2001-10-03|url=http://www.salon.com/2001/10/03/asterisk/|accessdate=2011-11-09}}</ref>\nLater, it was revealed that Frick had served as a [[ghostwriter]] for Ruth earlier in his career.<ref>{{cite web|title=Frick, Ford Baseball Hall of Fame|url=https://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/frick-ford|website=Baseballhall.org|accessdate=October 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nFrick successfully prevented the [[Continental League]], a proposed third major league, from ever playing, and introduced major league baseball to several markets in which the proposed league planned to play through expansion and relocation.\n\n=== William Eckert (1965\u20131968) ===\n[[File:William Dole \"Spike\" Eckert.jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[William Eckert]]]]\nMore than 150 names appeared on the original list of nominees for the commissionership following [[Ford Frick]]'s retirement. The club owners initially were unable to decide if the next commissioner should come from the ranks of the game (e.g., the president of the [[American League|American]] or [[National League]]s), or elsewhere. They finally decided that the new commissioner should have a strong business background to deal with the problems that were confronting the game at the time.\n\n[[William Eckert]] became a serious candidate for the commissionership only after fellow officer [[Curtis LeMay]] gave Major League Baseball a recommendation for him. On November 17, [[1965 in baseball|1965]], by a unanimous vote of the then, 20 major league club owners, William Eckert became the fourth Commissioner of Major League Baseball.\n\nWhen he became commissioner, Eckert had not seen a game in person in over 10 years. He was a compromise choice for the job, previously being so obscure that sportswriters nicknamed him \"the Unknown Soldier.\"\n\nHe incurred the public's ire by refusing to cancel games after the assassinations of Sen. [[Robert F. Kennedy]] and Rev. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and team owners' disdain because he refused to deal forcefully with substantive business issues. Anticipating a [[labor strike|players' strike]] and having no ownership confidence in his ability to handle the situation, Eckert was forced to resign at the end of the [[1968 in baseball|1968]] season, although he still had three years on his contract.\n\nIn spite of his much publicized failures and shortcomings, William Eckert also developed more effective committee actions, streamlined business methods and helped stabilize franchises with bigger stadiums and long-term leases. In addition, Eckert worked hard toward promoting the game internationally, including a [[1966 in baseball|1966]] tour of Japan by the [[1966 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]].\n\n=== Bowie Kuhn (1969\u20131984) ===\n[[File:Bowie Kuhn 1982.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Bowie Kuhn]]]]\n[[Bowie Kuhn]]'s tenure was marked by labor [[strike action|strikes]] (most notably in [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|1981]]), owner disenchantment, and the end of baseball's [[reserve clause]], yet baseball enjoyed unprecedented attendance gains (from 23&nbsp;million in {{baseball year|1968}} to 45.5&nbsp;million in {{baseball year|1983}}) and [[Major League Baseball television contracts|television contracts]] during the same time frame.\n\nKuhn suspended numerous players for involvement with drugs and gambling, and took a strong stance against any activity that he perceived to be \"not in the best interests of baseball.\"<ref>The commissioner's authority to take \"what preventive, remedial or punitive action is appropriate\" to remedy actions \"not in the best interests of baseball\" comes from the contract signed by team owners. Baseball's first commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, insisted that the commissioner have this power.{{cite news|last=Margolick|first=David|title='Best Interests' Rule Limits Steinbrenner|newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 July 1990|page=C1}}</ref>\n\nIn {{baseball year|1970}}, he suspended star [[Detroit Tigers]] pitcher [[Denny McLain]] indefinitely (the suspension was later set at 3 months) due to McLain's involvement in a [[bookmaking]] operation, and later suspended McLain for the rest of the season for carrying a gun. He barred both [[Willie Mays]] (in {{baseball year|1979}}) and [[Mickey Mantle]] (in {{baseball year|1983}}) from the sport due to their involvement in [[casino]] promotion; neither was directly involved in gambling, and both were reinstated by Kuhn's successor [[Peter Ueberroth]] in {{baseball year|1985}}.\n\nAlso in 1970, Kuhn described [[Jim Bouton]]'s ''[[Ball Four]]'' as \"detrimental to baseball\" and demanded that Bouton retract it. The book has been republished several times and is now considered a classic.\n\nOn October 13, {{baseball year|1971}}, the [[1971 World Series|World Series]] held a night game for the first time. Kuhn, who thought that baseball could attract a larger audience by featuring a [[prime time]] telecast (as opposed to a mid-afternoon broadcast, when most fans either worked or attended school), pitched the idea to [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]]. An estimated 61&nbsp;million people watched Game 4 on NBC; TV [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] for a World Series game during the daytime hours would not have approached such a record number. Kuhn's vision in this instance has been fulfilled, as all the World Series games are now shown in prime time.\n\n==== Curt Flood ====\n{{Main|Flood v. Kuhn}}\n\nOn October 7, {{baseball year|1969}}, the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] traded [[Curt Flood]], catcher [[Tim McCarver]], outfielder [[Byron Browne]], and left-handed pitcher [[Joe Hoerner]] to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] for first baseman [[Dick Allen]], second baseman [[Cookie Rojas]], and right-handed ace relief pitcher [[Jerry Johnson (baseball)|Jerry Johnson]].\n\nHowever, Flood refused to report to the moribund Phillies, citing the team's poor record and the fact that they played in dilapidated [[Connie Mack Stadium]] before belligerent and, Flood believed, [[racism|racist]] fans. Flood forfeited a relatively lucrative US$100,000 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100000|1969|r=0}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}){{Inflation-fn|US}} contract by his refusal to be traded to the Phillies.\n\nIn a letter to Kuhn, Flood demanded that the commissioner declare him a [[free agent]]. Kuhn denied his request, citing the propriety of the [[reserve clause]], which was language in contracts that essentially prevented a player from playing with another team even after his contract expired. In response, Flood filed a lawsuit against Kuhn and Major League Baseball on January 16, {{baseball year|1970}}, alleging that Major League Baseball had violated federal [[antitrust]] laws. Even though Flood was making $90,000 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|90000|1969|r=0}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}){{Inflation-fn|US}} at the time, he likened the reserve clause to [[slavery]]. It was a controversial analogy, even among those who opposed the reserve clause.\n\nThe case, ''[[Flood v. Kuhn]]'' (407 U.S. 258) eventually went to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. Flood's attorney, former Supreme Court Justice [[Arthur Goldberg]], asserted that the reserve clause depressed wages and limited players to one team for life. Major League Baseball's counsel countered that Commissioner Kuhn acted under the way he did '\"for the good of the game.\"''\n\nUltimately, the Supreme Court, acting on ''[[stare decisis]]'' \"to stand by things decided\", ruled 5\u20133 in favor of Major League Baseball, upholding a {{baseball year|1922}} ruling in the case of ''[[Federal Baseball Club v. National League]]'', (259 U.S. 200.)\n\n==== Charles O. Finley ====\nThough he had a reputation as an owners' commissioner, Kuhn did not avoid confronting owners when he deemed it necessary. For example, he was a major adversary of [[Oakland Athletics]] owner [[Charles O. Finley]]. A major embarrassment for baseball resulted from Finley's actions during the [[1973 World Series]]. Finley forced player [[Mike Andrews]] to sign a false [[affidavit]] saying he was injured after the reserve infielder committed two consecutive [[error (baseball)|errors]] in the 12th inning of Oakland's Game 2 loss to the [[New York Mets]]. Andrews' teammates as well as manager [[Dick Williams]] rallied to his defense. Kuhn in return, forced Finley to reinstate Andrews. In {{baseball year|1976}}, when Finley attempted to sell several players to the [[Boston Red Sox]] and [[New York Yankees]] for $3.5&nbsp;million, Kuhn blocked the deals on the grounds that they would be bad for the game. Some believe that Kuhn's actions were simply a revenge tactic, aimed at Finley, after Finley attempted to force an owners vote to remove Kuhn as commissioner in {{baseball year|1975}}.\n\n==== Kuhn's war on drugs ====\nAfter being in office for over ten years, Kuhn had grown a strong reputation for being hard on players who [[drug abuse|abused drugs]]. Kuhn was quick to punish players who used drugs with heavy fines and suspensions. [[Kansas City Royals]] catcher [[Darrell Porter]] told the [[Associated Press]] that during the winter of {{baseball year|1979}}\u2013{{baseball year|1980}} he became [[paranoia|paranoid]], convinced that Kuhn knew about his drug abuse, was trying to sneak into his house, and planned to ban him from baseball for life. Porter found himself sitting up at night in the dark watching out the front window, waiting for Kuhn to approach, clutching billiard balls and a shotgun. Ironically, when Porter was named the most valuable player of the [[1982 World Series]] while playing for the Cardinals, Kuhn was on hand to congratulate him.\n\nIn {{baseball year|1983}}, four players from the [[Kansas City Royals]] \u2013 [[Willie Wilson (baseball)|Willie Wilson]], [[Jerry Martin (baseball)|Jerry Martin]], [[Willie Aikens|Willie Mays Aikens]], and [[Vida Blue]] \u2013 were found guilty of [[cocaine]] use. In addition, such established stars as [[Ferguson Jenkins]], [[Keith Hernandez]], [[Dave Parker]], and [[Dale Berra]] admitted to having problems with drugs.\n{{See also|Pittsburgh drug trials}}\n\n==== Lifetime baseball passes ====\nIn {{baseball year|1980}}, during the [[Iranian hostage crisis]], Kuhn sat at a baseball game with [[Jeremiah Denton]], a Navy admiral and former [[prisoner of war|POW]] in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] who would be elected U.S. Senator later that year from the state of [[Alabama]]. Recalling the event to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Kuhn believed that ''\"that afternoon...the idea of a lifetime baseball pass was discussed,\"'' and upon their return from Iran, each of the 52 hostages was given one of these unique passes.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/19/AR2006011903068.html|work=The Washington Post|title=Safe at Home|first=Les|last=Carpenter|date=January 20, 2006|accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==== Leaving office ====\nKuhn was both praised and attacked for the firm stand that he levied against offenders. In {{baseball year|1982}}, some of the owners organized a move to push him out of office. In {{baseball year|1983}}, Kuhn and his supporters made a last-ditch effort to renew his contract but ultimately failed. Kuhn, though, was allowed to stay for the {{baseball year|1984}} regular season before being replaced by [[Peter Ueberroth]].\n\n=== Peter Ueberroth (1984\u20131989) ===\n[[File:Peter Ueberroth.jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[Peter Ueberroth]]]]\n[[Peter Ueberroth]] was elected to succeed [[Bowie Kuhn]] on March 3, 1984, and took office on October 1 of that year. As a condition of his hiring, Ueberroth increased the commissioner's fining ability from US$5,000 to $250,000. His salary was raised to a reported $450,000, nearly twice what Kuhn was paid.\n\nJust as Ueberroth was taking office the Major League Umpires Union was threatening to [[Strike action|strike]] the postseason. Ueberroth managed to arbitrate the disagreement and had the umpires back to work before the [[League Championship Series]] were over. The next summer, Ueberroth worked behind the scenes to limit a players' strike to one day before a new labor agreement was worked out with the [[Major League Baseball Players Association|Players Association]].\n\nDuring the course of his stint as commissioner, Ueberroth reinstated [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]] [[Willie Mays]] and [[Mickey Mantle]], who had been banned from working for Major League Baseball by Kuhn because of their associations with gambling casinos. Also, Ueberroth [[Pittsburgh drug trials#Ramifications|suspended numerous players]] because of [[cocaine]] use, negotiated a $1.1&nbsp;billion [[Major League Baseball on CBS#1990\u20131993 version|television contract]] with [[CBS]],<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/15/sports/a-billion-dollar-bid-by-cbs-wins-rights-to-baseball-games.html?pagewanted=all A Billion-Dollar Bid By CBS Wins Rights To Baseball Games]</ref> and initiated the investigation against [[Pete Rose]]'s [[Dowd Report|betting habits]]. In [[1985 in baseball|1985]], Ueberroth's first full year in office, the League Championship Series expanded from a best-of-five series to a best-of-seven series. At his urging, the [[Chicago Cubs]] chose to install lights at [[Wrigley Field]] rather than reimburse the leagues for lost night-game revenues. Ueberroth then found a new source of income in the form of persuading large corporations to pay for the privilege of having their products endorsed by Major League Baseball.\n\nHowever, Ueberroth, with the assistance of the owners, also facilitated [[Baseball collusion#1985\u20131987|collusion]], an illegal violation of the league's collective bargaining agreement with the players, during the 1985, 1986 and 1987 off-seasons. Players entering free-agency were prevented from both signing equitable contracts and joining the teams of their choice during this period, a strategy that union leader [[Marvin Miller]] later held was \"tantamount to fixing, not just games, but entire pennant races, including all post-season series.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Dave|title=Baseball's Realistic Adversary|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/23/sports/sports-of-the-times-baseball-s-realistic-adversary.html|work=New York Times|date=June 23, 1991|page=S3|access-date=April 19, 2020}}</ref> The [[Major League Baseball Players Association|MLBPA]] filed [[Baseball collusion|collusion charges]], arguing that Ueberroth and team owners had violated the collective bargaining agreement in the [[1985 in baseball|1985]], [[1986 in baseball|1986]], and [[1987 in baseball|1987]] seasons.

When Ueberroth took office, 21 of the 26 clubs were losing money; in Ueberroth's last full season--[[1988 in baseball|1988]]\u2014all clubs either broke even or finished in the black. In [[1987 in baseball|1987]], for example, baseball as an industry showed a net profit of $21.3&nbsp;million, its first profitable year since [[1973 in baseball|1973]].\n\nNonetheless, following the announcement of the first of three large awards to the players following the collusion findings, Ueberroth stepped down as commissioner before the start of the [[1989 in baseball|1989 regular season]]; his contract was to have run through the end of the season. He was succeeded by [[National League]] president [[A. Bartlett Giamatti]].\n\n=== A. Bartlett Giamatti (1989) ===\nA [[Yale University|Yale]] professor of [[English literature]] who became president of the university, [[A. Bartlett Giamatti]] had a lifelong interest in baseball (he was a die-hard [[Boston Red Sox]] fan).  He became President of the [[National League]] in {{baseball year|1986}}.  During his stint as National League president, Giamatti placed an emphasis on the need to improve the environment for the fan in the ballparks.  He also decided to make umpires strictly enforce the [[balk]] rule, and supported \"social justice\" as the only remedy for the lack of presence of minority managers, coaches, or executives at any level in Major League Baseball.\n\nWhile still serving as National League president, Giamatti suspended [[Pete Rose]] for 30 games after Rose shoved umpire [[Dave Pallone]] on April 30, 1988.  Later that year, Giamatti also suspended [[1988 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] pitcher [[Jay Howell]], who was caught using [[pine tar]] during the [[1988 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]].\n\nGiamatti, whose tough dealing with Yale's union favorably impressed Major League Baseball owners, was unanimously elected to succeed [[Peter Ueberroth]] as commissioner on September 8, 1988 and assumed office on April 1, 1989.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/mlb/comish/giamatti.html|title=Sports Encyclopedia |access-date=2011-11-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223161021/http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/MLB/Comish/giamatti.html |archive-date=2008-12-23 |url-status=dead}}</ref>  Giamatti was commissioner on August 24, {{baseball year|1989}} when Pete Rose voluntarily agreed to permanent ineligibility from baseball.<ref>[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/p_rosea.shtml Rose agreement]</ref>  As reflected in the agreement with Pete Rose, Giamatti was determined to maintain the integrity of the game during his brief commissionership.\n{{See also|Dowd Report}}\n\nWhile at his vacation home on [[Martha's Vineyard]], Giamatti, a heavy [[tobacco smoking|smoker]] for many years, died suddenly of a massive [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the age of 51, just eight days after banishing Rose and 154 days into his tenure as commissioner.<ref>[http://thedeadballera.com/Obits/Giamatti.Bart.Obit01.html ''New York Times'' obituary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301063439/http://thedeadballera.com/Obits/Giamatti.Bart.Obit01.html |date=2009-03-01 }}</ref>  He became the second baseball commissioner to die in office, the first being [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]].

Before accepting the job as Commissioner of Baseball, Vincent consulted with Bart Giamatti's widow, Toni, to make sure she thought it was appropriate for him to do so.\n\nIn [[1990 in baseball|1990]], National League president [[Bill White (first baseman)|Bill White]] was prepared to suspend umpire [[Joe West (umpire)|Joe West]] for slamming [[1990 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia]] pitcher [[Dennis Cook]] to the field, but Vincent intervened and no discipline was imposed.\n\nDuring his commissionership, Vincent made it known (e.g. while being interviewed by [[Pat O'Brien (television)|Pat O'Brien]] during [[Major League Baseball on CBS#1990\u20131993 version|CBS]]' coverage of Game 4 of the [[1991 World Series]]) that if he had the chance, he would get rid of the [[designated hitter]] rule.\n\nVincent has also been connected with [[Pete Rose]]'s lifetime banishment from baseball; however, the investigation that led to Rose's banishment began during Ueberroth's tenure, and the banishment was levied by Giamatti and not Vincent (although Vincent led the investigation and was involved in the negotiations). Vincent has publicly said he does not support Rose's reinstatement.\n\n==== 1989 World Series ====\n{{Main|1989 World Series}}\nOn October 17, 1989, Vincent sat in a field box behind the left [[dugout (baseball)|dugout]] at San Francisco's [[Candlestick Park]]. At 5:04&nbsp;p.m., just prior to Game 3 of the World Series between the [[1989 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] and [[1989 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]], the 6.9 [[moment magnitude scale|Mw]] [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|Loma Prieta earthquake]] hit with a maximum [[Mercalli intensity scale|Mercalli intensity]] of IX (''Violent''). At approximately 5:35&nbsp;p.m., after coming to the conclusion that the power could not be restored before sunset, Vincent ordered the game to be postponed. According to Vincent, he had already made the decision to postpone Game 3 without telling anybody first. As a result, the umpires filed a formal protest of Vincent's decision. However, the game had to be postponed due to trouble with gas lines as well as the power issue.\n\nThe World Series ultimately resumed after a ten-day postponement (and some initial conflict between Vincent and San Francisco mayor [[Arthur Christ Agnos|Art Agnos]], who felt that the World Series ought to have been delayed much longer) on October 27, 1989. While presenting the [[Commissioner's Trophy (MLB)|Commissioner's Trophy]] to the Athletics, who wound up winning the World Series in a four-game sweep, Vincent summed up the 1989 World Series as a ''\"Remarkable World Series in many respects.\"''\n\n==== 1990 lockout ====\n{{Main|1990 Major League Baseball lockout}}\nIn February 1990, owners announced that spring training would not be starting as scheduled. This occurred after [[Major League Baseball Players Association|MLBPA]] Executive Director [[Donald Fehr]] became afraid that the owners would institute a [[salary cap]]. Fehr believed that a salary cap could possibly restrict the number of choices free agents could make and a pay-for-performance scale would eliminate multiyear contracts. The lockout, which was the seventh work stoppage in baseball since [[1972 in baseball|1972]], lasted 32 games and wiped out all of spring training.\n\nVincent worked with both the owners and MLBPA, and on March 19, 1990, Vincent was able to announce a new Basic Agreement (which raised the minimum major league salary from US$68,000 to $100,000 and established a six-man study committee on revenue sharing). As a consequence for the lockout, Opening Day for the [[1990 in baseball|1990]] season was moved back a week to April 9, and the season was extended by three days to accommodate the normal 162-game schedule.\n\n==== George Steinbrenner ====\nOn July 30, [[1990 in baseball|1990]], Vincent banned [[New York Yankees]] owner [[George Steinbrenner]] from baseball for life after Steinbrenner paid [[Howard Spira]], a small-time gambler, $40,000 for \"dirt\" on his outfielder [[Dave Winfield]] after Winfield sued Steinbrenner for failing to pay his foundation the $300,000 guaranteed in his contract.  Steinbrenner was eventually reinstated in [[1993 in baseball|1993]] (one year after Vincent left office).\n\n==== Steve Howe ====\nOn June 24, [[1992 in baseball|1992]], Vincent permanently suspended pitcher [[Steve Howe (baseball)|Steve Howe]] for repeated drug offenses.  Vincent was incensed when upper Yankee management ([[Buck Showalter]], [[Gene Michael]], and Jack Lawn) agreed to testify on Howe's behalf, and threatened them with expulsion from the game:\n{{cquote|You have effectively resigned from baseball by agreeing to appear at that hearing.... you should have left your conscience and your principles outside the door.}}\n\nIronically, the three men were unaffected by Vincent's hyperbole, testified for Howe as promised, and remained active in baseball.  Three months later, Vincent was removed from his job as commissioner.  An arbitrator overturned Vincent's suspension of Howe on November 11, 1992.\n\n==== 1993 expansion ====\nIn June [[1991 in baseball|1991]], Vincent declared that the [[American League]] would receive US$42&nbsp;million of the [[National League]]'s $190&nbsp;million in expansion revenue and that the AL would provide players in the National League expansion draft (involving the [[Colorado Rockies]] and Florida Marlins, the latter now known as the [[Miami Marlins]]).  In an attempt to win support in the American League and balance the vote, Vincent decreed that the AL owners were entitled to 22 percent of the $190&nbsp;million take. This decision marked the first time in expansion history that leagues were required to share expansion revenue or provide players for another league's expansion draft.  Vincent said the owners expanded to raise money to pay their [[Baseball collusion|collusion]] debt.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n==== Realignment ====\nJust prior to leaving office, Vincent had plans to realign the National League. Vincent wanted the [[Chicago Cubs]] and [[St. Louis Cardinals]] to move from the [[National League East|Eastern Division]] to the [[National League West|Western Division]]. Part of the impetus for realignment was the geographically anomalous placement of the [[Cincinnati Reds]] and [[Atlanta Braves]] in the West and the Cubs and the Cardinals in the east since [[1969 in baseball|1969]]. National League president [[Bill White (first baseman)|Bill White]] warned Vincent that realigning without league approval would be in violation of the National League Constitution.\n\nMany thought this plan would be beneficial to the league as a whole, especially by building a regional rivalry between the new franchise in [[Florida Marlins|Miami]] and the Atlanta Braves. The Cubs, however, opposed the move, suggesting that fans in the [[Central Time Zone]] would be forced to watch more games originating on the West Coast with later broadcast times (had the realignment included the use of a balanced schedule, the Cubs would have actually played more games against teams outside their division).\n\nOn July 17, 1992, the Chicago Cubs sued Vincent and asked the [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]] in [[Chicago]] for a preliminary [[injunction]] to prevent implementation, which was granted two weeks later. After Vincent's attorneys appealed, oral arguments were scheduled for August 30 that year. Ultimately, Vincent resigned before the litigation was scheduled to resume, so as a result, the Cubs dropped their suit.\n\nAlthough Vincent's vision never really came into fruition, Major League Baseball did in fact realign in [[1994 in baseball|1994]], albeit in the form of three divisions in each league (east, central and west) and the addition of an expanded playoff format.\n\n==== Vincent's relationship with the owners ====\nHis relationship with baseball's owners was always tenuous at best; he resigned in [[1992 in baseball|1992]] after the owners gave him an 18\u20139 no confidence vote. The owners were still angry at Vincent over his intervention during the 1990 lockout. The owners were also disappointed by dwindling television [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] in light of a US$1.1&nbsp;billion, [[Major League Baseball on CBS#1990\u20131993 version|four-year deal]] with [[CBS]] (which ultimately cost the network $500&nbsp;million) beginning in [[1990 in baseball|1990]] (Vincent's first full season as commissioner) and upwardly spiraling salaries. (It is also important to note that CBS itself contributed to decreasing ratings thanks to the haphazard scheduling of ''[[Major League Baseball Game of the Week|Game of the Week]]'' broadcasts during the regular season to the point that fans grew tired of tuning into no baseball on summer Saturdays.) They also accused him of acting in a high-handed manner, especially in the Howe affair.\n\nThe leaders in the movement to oust Vincent were members of what ''[[The Sporting News]]'' later dubbed ''The [[Great Lakes]] Gang'':<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_n12_v218/ai_15837588 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050125020242/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_n12_v218/ai_15837588 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2005-01-25|work=The Sporting News|title=The Great Lakes gang|first=Steve|last=Marantz|year=1994}}</ref>\n\n*[[Bud Selig]], president of the [[Milwaukee Brewers]];\n*[[Jerry Reinsdorf]], chairman of the [[Chicago White Sox]];\n*Stanton Cook, head of the [[Tribune Company|Tribune Co.]], which owned the [[Chicago Cubs]];\n*[[Carl Pohlad]], owner of the [[Minnesota Twins]];\n*[[Peter O'Malley]], the longtime majority owner of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]\n\nIn his farewell, Vincent said {{cquote|To do the job without angering an owner is impossible. I can't make all twenty-eight of my bosses happy. People have told me I'm the last commissioner. If so, it's a sad thing. I hope they [the owners] learn this lesson before too much damage is done.}}\n\nHe was replaced by [[Milwaukee Brewers]] owner [[Bud Selig]], whose family continued to maintain ownership over the Brewers. Fay Vincent was never able to complete the five-year term that he had inherited from Bart Giamatti. Vincent would later contend that Major League Baseball made a huge mistake by not appointing his deputy commissioner Steve Greenberg \u2014 the son of the [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Hank Greenberg]] \u2014 as the commissioner.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\n=== Bud Selig (1992\u20132015) ===\n[[File:Bud Selig on October 31, 2010.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[Bud Selig]]]]\n[[Bud Selig]] served as the Executive Council Chairman from 1992 to 1998, acting as the commissioner, and then was appointed as the official commissioner in 1998.<ref name=\"Extension\">{{cite news|last=Bagnato|first=Andrew|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/01/17/sports/s105517S11.DTL|title=Selig Given 3-Year Contract Extension|publisher=Sfgate.com|date=2008-01-18|accessdate=2009-10-17|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521115859/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2008%2F01%2F17%2Fsports%2Fs105517S11.DTL|archivedate=May 21, 2009}}</ref> Selig oversaw baseball through the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|1994 strike]], the introduction of the wild card, [[interleague play]], and the merging of the National and American leagues under the Office of the Commissioner.

The commissioner is chosen by a vote of the owners of the teams. The current commissioner is [[Rob Manfred]], who assumed office on January 25, 2015.\n\n== Origin of the office ==\nThe title \"commissioner\", which is a title now applied to the heads of several other major sports leagues as well as baseball, derives from its predecessor office, the National Commission. The National Commission was the ruling body of professional baseball starting with the National Agreement of 1903, which made peace between the [[National League]] and the [[American League]] (see [[History of baseball in the United States]]). It consisted of three members: the two League presidents and a Commission chairman, whose primary responsibilities were to preside at meetings and to mediate disputes. Although the Commission chairman [[August Herrmann]] was the nominal head of major league baseball, it was AL President [[Ban Johnson]] who dominated the Commission.\n\nThe event that would eventually lead to the appointment of a single Commissioner of Baseball was the [[Black Sox Scandal]] \u2014 perhaps the worst of a series of incidents in the late 1910s that jeopardized the integrity of the game. However, the motivations behind the creation of the Commissioner's office were more than the mere desire to rebuild public relations. The scandal had not only tarnished the image of baseball, but had brought relations between team owners and AL President Johnson to a breaking point. In particular, [[Chicago White Sox]] owner [[Charles Comiskey]] was incensed at what he perceived to be Johnson's indifference to his suspicions that the [[1919 World Series]] had been thrown. As a result, the National League, whose owners had never been on good terms with Johnson, agreed to invite the White Sox along with the [[Boston Red Sox]] and [[New York Yankees]] to join their league. The NL also unveiled plans to put a twelfth team in [[Detroit]].\n\nWith the American League's status as a major league and possibly its very existence suddenly in jeopardy, the five AL owners loyal to Johnson sued for peace. Eventually, at the urging of [[Detroit Tigers]] owner and Johnson loyalist [[Frank Navin]], a compromise was reached in late 1920 to reform the National Commission with a membership of non-baseball men.\n\n== Overview of commissioners ==\n\n=== Kenesaw Mountain Landis (1920\u20131944) ===\n[[File:Landis portrait-restored.png|thumb|right|upright|[[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]]]]\nHaving agreed to appoint only non-baseball men to the National Commission, the owners tapped federal judge [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]], an ardent baseball fan, to serve as the reformed commission's chairman.<ref name=\"blal\">{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=American_League|title=League American|publisher=Baseball Library|accessdate=2007-12-26|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080114000923/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=American_League|archivedate=2008-01-14}}</ref> Landis responded by declaring that he would only accept an appointment as sole commissioner, with nearly unlimited authority to act in the \"best interests of baseball\" \u2014 in essence, serving as an arbitrator whose decisions could not be appealed.  Finally, Landis insisted on a lifetime contract.  The owners, still reeling from the perception that the sport was crooked, readily agreed.\n\n==== Gambling ====\nLandis's first significant act was to deal with the Black Sox scandal. Following a trial, the eight players suspected of involvement in the fix were acquitted, including [[Buck Weaver]] and superstar [[Shoeless Joe Jackson]]. Nevertheless, immediately following the players' acquittal, Landis [[List of people banned from Major League Baseball|banned them all from baseball]] for life.  He famously declared, \"Regardless of the verdict of juries, no player who throws a ballgame, no player that undertakes or promises to throw a ballgame, no player that sits in conference with a bunch of crooked players and gamblers where the ways and means of throwing a game are discussed and does not promptly tell his club about it, will ever play professional baseball.\"<ref>http://www.sportshistorytoday.com/black-sox-banned-baseball-august-3-1921/</ref> Landis explained that even though the players had all been acquitted in court, there was no dispute that they had broken the rules of baseball.{{citation required|date=August 2019}} Therefore, he maintained that none of them could be allowed back in the game if its image was to be restored with the public.{{citation required|date=August 2019}}\n\nOver the years, he dealt harshly with others proven to have thrown individual games, consorted with gamblers or engaged in actions that he felt tarnished the image of the game. Among the others he banned were [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] players [[Phil Douglas (baseball)|Phil Douglas]] and [[Jimmy O'Connell (baseball)|Jimmy O'Connell]], [[Philadelphia Phillies]] pitcher [[Gene Paulette]], Giants coach [[Cozy Dolan (1910s outfielder)|Cozy Dolan]], and (in 1943) Phillies owner [[William D. Cox]]. He also formalized the unofficial banishments of [[Hal Chase]] and [[Heinie Zimmerman]]. In 1921, he banned Giants center fielder [[Benny Kauff]] even though he had been acquitted of involvement in a car theft ring. Nonetheless, Landis was convinced Kauff was guilty and argued that players of \"undesirable reputation and character\" had no place in baseball.\n\n==== A fiercely independent Commissioner's Office ====\nThe owners had initially assumed that Landis would deal with the Black Sox Scandal and then settle into a comfortable retirement as the titular head of baseball. Instead, Landis ruled baseball with an iron hand for the next 25 years. He established a fiercely independent Commissioner's Office that would go on to often make both players and owners miserable with decisions that he argued were in the best interests of the game. He worked to clean up the hooliganism that was tarnishing the reputation of players in the 1920s, and inserted his office into negotiations with players, where he deemed appropriate, to end a few of the labor practices of owners like [[Charles Comiskey]] that had contributed to the players' discontent. He also personally approved broadcasters for the World Series.\n\nLandis's only significant rival in the early years was longtime American League founder and president [[Ban Johnson]], who had been reckoned as the most powerful man in the game before Landis's arrival.  Johnson was as strong-willed as Landis, and a clash between the two was inevitable.  It happened in the [[1924 World Series]]. When several Giants were implicated in a plan to bribe players on the moribund Phillies late in the season, Johnson demanded that the Series be canceled, and loudly criticized Landis's handling of the affair, to which Landis responded by threatening to resign. The American League owners promised to throw Johnson out of office if he stepped out of line again. [[1926 in baseball|Two years later]], when Johnson criticized Landis's decision to give [[Ty Cobb]] and [[Tris Speaker]] an amnesty after it surfaced they had bet on a fixed game in 1919, Landis told the American League owners to choose between him and Johnson.  The owners promptly sent Johnson on a sabbatical from which he never really returned.\n\n==== The baseball color line ====\nLandis perpetuated the [[baseball color line|color line]] and prolonged the segregation of organized baseball. His successor, [[Happy Chandler]], said, \"For twenty-four years Judge Landis wouldn't let a black man play. I had his records, and I read them, and for twenty-four years Landis consistently blocked any attempts to put blacks and whites together on a big league field.\"<ref>[http://baseballreader.tripod.com/id33.htm Bums: An Oral History of the Brooklyn Dodgers] by Peter Golenbock</ref> [[Bill Veeck]] claimed Landis prevented him from purchasing the Phillies when Landis learned of Veeck's plan to integrate the team. The signing of the first black ballplayer in the modern era, [[Jackie Robinson]], came less than a year after Landis's death on Chandler's watch and was engineered by one of Landis's old nemeses, [[Branch Rickey]]. Eleven weeks after Robinson's debut with the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]], Veeck became the first [[American League]] owner to break the color line.\n\n==== Curbing the growth of minor league farm systems ====\nLandis tried to curb the growth of [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] farm systems by innovators such as Rickey, in the name of protecting the lower levels of professional ball. Landis argued that because a parent club could unilaterally call up players from teams which were involved in pennant races, the organization was unfairly interfering with the minor competitions. His position was that the championship of each minor league was of no less importance than the championships of the major leagues, and that minor league fans and supporters had the right to see their teams competing as best they could.\n\nOn the other hand, Landis prevented the formation of a powerful third major league when he stopped [[Pants Rowland]] from upgrading the [[Pacific Coast League]] in the 1940s. Furthermore, (and despite the fact that, insofar as he was accountable at all, it was strictly to major league owners) Landis did not hesitate to aggressively use the powers of his office to force the minor leagues and their clubs to submit to his authority in a number of ways. Most notably, he uncompromisingly held to a policy that dictated any minor league player who knowingly played with or against a player banned by Major League Baseball would himself be banned from MLB for life. This threat effectively compelled every minor league to rigidly honor and enforce suspensions handed down by Landis in their competitions as well.  Nevertheless, some players banned by Landis are believed to have continued playing under assumed identities at the minor league or semi-professional level.\n\nOne of the schemes Landis vigorously fought was the effort by major-league teams to \"cover up\" players they were hiding in their farm systems. The term, not used in formal communications by league or team officials, referred to players clandestinely signed by a major-league team to a minor-league contract. Occasionally one team would serendipitously find such a player in the off-season draft, as in this occasion recorded in the book ''Dodger Daze and Knights'':\n\n<blockquote>\nAll the clubowners and managers, and Commissioner Landis, were assembled to conduct the draft. One team representative said he \"claim[s] Player [[Paul Richards (baseball)|[Paul] Richards]] of Brooklyn.\"\n\n\"You can't do that!\" barked a surprised [[Wilbert Robinson]], manager of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]].\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Landis.\n\n\"Because Brooklyn has him covered up\", sputtered Robbie.\n\nMost of the others broke down laughing. Even Landis smirked.\n</blockquote>\n\n==== Legacy and honors ====\nWhether his decisions were praised or criticized, he was satisfied with being respected and feared. Dubbed \"the baseball tyrant\" by journalists of the day, his rule was absolute. In the context of ensuring the integrity of the game itself, baseball historians generally regard him as the right man at the right time when appointed, but also as a man who perhaps held office too long.\n\nHe was elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1944|1944]], in a special election held one month after his death, and the [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player Award]] in each league is officially known as the Kenesaw Mountain Landis Award in his honor.\n\n=== Happy Chandler (1945\u20131951) ===\n[[File:Happy Chandler - Harris and Ewing Crop.jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[Happy Chandler]]]]\nWhen Judge Landis died in 1944, an official in the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] began campaigning for [[Happy Chandler]]'s election to the post. Despite being the last candidate put forth in the April [[1945 in baseball|1945]] meetings, he was elected by a unanimous vote of the team owners, and resigned his Senate seat in October of that year.<ref name=mlb>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/mlb_history_people.jsp?story=com_bio_2|title=Albert Benjamin \"Happy\" Chandler|publisher=Major League Baseball|accessdate=2007-01-30}}</ref>\n\nChandler clashed with [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] manager [[Leo Durocher|Leo \"the Lip\" Durocher]] over Durocher's association with gambling figures and his marriage to actress [[Laraine Day]], which came amid allegations from Day's ex-husband that Durocher had stolen her away from him.<ref name=rogers>{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Thomas|title=In Memory of Leo Durocher|url=http://www.astrosdaily.com/players/obits/Durocher_Leo.html|work=The New York Times|date=1991-10-08|accessdate=2007-06-06}}</ref> Before the start of the 1947 season, Chandler suspended Durocher for the entire season, citing \"conduct detrimental to baseball.\"<ref>{{cite news|first=Dick|last=Heller|title=Dodgers handled unrest to start '47|work=[[The Washington Times]]|date=2006-04-10}}</ref> The Dodgers went on to win the pennant that season under replacement manager [[Burt Shotton]].<ref name=rogers />\n\nChandler became known as \"the players' commissioner\" for his work on their behalf.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kosin|first=Phil|date=October 1985|title=Diamond Classics|journal=ABA Journal|volume=71|issue=10|page=35}}</ref> During his service, he presided over the establishment of a pension fund for players and oversaw the initial steps toward [[Racial integration|integration]] of the major leagues, beginning with the debut of [[Jackie Robinson]] with the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] in 1947.

The Dodgers' [[Branch Rickey]] met with Chandler, who agreed to back the team's move. Chandler's stance was credited by many in the sports community with Chandler's failure to be selected for another term as Commissioner after the expiration of his first one in [[1951 in baseball|1951]].<ref name=harrison>{{cite book|title=''Kentucky's Governors''|editor=[[Lowell H.

And if He asks me why I didn't let this boy play, and I say it's because he's black, that might not be a satisfactory answer.\n:If the Lord made some people black, and some white, and some red or yellow, he must have had a pretty good reason. It isn't my job to decide which colors can play big league baseball. It is my job to see that the game is fairly played and that everybody has an equal chance. I think if I do that, I can face my Maker with a clear conscience.\"\n\n=== Ford Frick (1951\u20131965) ===\n[[File:Ford Frick at 1937 All-Star Game (cropped and adjusted).jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[Ford Frick]]]]\nIn {{baseball year|1951}}, [[Ford Frick]] succeeded [[Happy Chandler]] as commissioner of baseball. Frick's critics accused him of favoring the NL in his rulings, such as how the 1960s expansion teams would be stocked.\n\nFrick's most highly criticized statement{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} as commissioner was made in 1961, when several players were on a pace to break [[Babe Ruth]]'s single-season home run record. In a press conference, Frick stated that the single-season home run record should be separated into multiple lists, based on length of season. However, as MLB did not publish an official record book at the time, Frick had no control on how publishers presented MLB records, and within a few years after [[Roger Maris]] broke Ruth's record, all record books gave Maris sole credit as the single-season home run record holder.<ref name=\"Salon-Maris\">{{cite web|last=Barra|first=Allen|title=The myth of Maris\u2019 asterisk|work=|publisher=Salon Media Group|date=2001-10-03|url=http://www.salon.com/2001/10/03/asterisk/|accessdate=2011-11-09}}</ref>\nLater, it was revealed that Frick had served as a [[ghostwriter]] for Ruth earlier in his career.<ref>{{cite web|title=Frick, Ford Baseball Hall of Fame|url=https://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/frick-ford|website=Baseballhall.org|accessdate=October 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nFrick successfully prevented the [[Continental League]], a proposed third major league, from ever playing, and introduced major league baseball to several markets in which the proposed league planned to play through expansion and relocation.\n\n=== William Eckert (1965\u20131968) ===\n[[File:William Dole \"Spike\" Eckert.jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[William Eckert]]]]\nMore than 150 names appeared on the original list of nominees for the commissionership following [[Ford Frick]]'s retirement. The club owners initially were unable to decide if the next commissioner should come from the ranks of the game (e.g., the president of the [[American League|American]] or [[National League]]s), or elsewhere. They finally decided that the new commissioner should have a strong business background to deal with the problems that were confronting the game at the time.\n\n[[William Eckert]] became a serious candidate for the commissionership only after fellow officer [[Curtis LeMay]] gave Major League Baseball a recommendation for him. On November 17, [[1965 in baseball|1965]], by a unanimous vote of the then, 20 major league club owners, William Eckert became the fourth Commissioner of Major League Baseball.\n\nWhen he became commissioner, Eckert had not seen a game in person in over 10 years. He was a compromise choice for the job, previously being so obscure that sportswriters nicknamed him \"the Unknown Soldier.\"\n\nHe incurred the public's ire by refusing to cancel games after the assassinations of Sen. [[Robert F. Kennedy]] and Rev. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and team owners' disdain because he refused to deal forcefully with substantive business issues. Anticipating a [[labor strike|players' strike]] and having no ownership confidence in his ability to handle the situation, Eckert was forced to resign at the end of the [[1968 in baseball|1968]] season, although he still had three years on his contract.\n\nIn spite of his much publicized failures and shortcomings, William Eckert also developed more effective committee actions, streamlined business methods and helped stabilize franchises with bigger stadiums and long-term leases. In addition, Eckert worked hard toward promoting the game internationally, including a [[1966 in baseball|1966]] tour of Japan by the [[1966 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]].\n\n=== Bowie Kuhn (1969\u20131984) ===\n[[File:Bowie Kuhn 1982.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Bowie Kuhn]]]]\n[[Bowie Kuhn]]'s tenure was marked by labor [[strike action|strikes]] (most notably in [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|1981]]), owner disenchantment, and the end of baseball's [[reserve clause]], yet baseball enjoyed unprecedented attendance gains (from 23 million in {{baseball year|1968}} to 45.5 million in {{baseball year|1983}}) and [[Major League Baseball television contracts|television contracts]] during the same time frame.\n\nKuhn suspended numerous players for involvement with drugs and gambling, and took a strong stance against any activity that he perceived to be \"not in the best interests of baseball.\"<ref>The commissioner's authority to take \"what preventive, remedial or punitive action is appropriate\" to remedy actions \"not in the best interests of baseball\" comes from the contract signed by team owners.

He barred both [[Willie Mays]] (in {{baseball year|1979}}) and [[Mickey Mantle]] (in {{baseball year|1983}}) from the sport due to their involvement in [[casino]] promotion; neither was directly involved in gambling, and both were reinstated by Kuhn's successor [[Peter Ueberroth]] in {{baseball year|1985}}.\n\nAlso in 1970, Kuhn described [[Jim Bouton]]'s ''[[Ball Four]]'' as \"detrimental to baseball\" and demanded that Bouton retract it. The book has been republished several times and is now considered a classic.\n\nOn October 13, {{baseball year|1971}}, the [[1971 World Series|World Series]] held a night game for the first time. Kuhn, who thought that baseball could attract a larger audience by featuring a [[prime time]] telecast (as opposed to a mid-afternoon broadcast, when most fans either worked or attended school), pitched the idea to [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]]. An estimated 61 million people watched Game 4 on NBC; TV [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] for a World Series game during the daytime hours would not have approached such a record number. Kuhn's vision in this instance has been fulfilled, as all the World Series games are now shown in prime time.\n\n==== Curt Flood ====\n{{Main|Flood v. Kuhn}}\n\nOn October 7, {{baseball year|1969}}, the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] traded [[Curt Flood]], catcher [[Tim McCarver]], outfielder [[Byron Browne]], and left-handed pitcher [[Joe Hoerner]] to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] for first baseman [[Dick Allen]], second baseman [[Cookie Rojas]], and right-handed ace relief pitcher [[Jerry Johnson (baseball)|Jerry Johnson]].\n\nHowever, Flood refused to report to the moribund Phillies, citing the team's poor record and the fact that they played in dilapidated [[Connie Mack Stadium]] before belligerent and, Flood believed, [[racism|racist]] fans. Flood forfeited a relatively lucrative US$100,000 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100000|1969|r=0}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}){{Inflation-fn|US}} contract by his refusal to be traded to the Phillies.\n\nIn a letter to Kuhn, Flood demanded that the commissioner declare him a [[free agent]]. Kuhn denied his request, citing the propriety of the [[reserve clause]], which was language in contracts that essentially prevented a player from playing with another team even after his contract expired. In response, Flood filed a lawsuit against Kuhn and Major League Baseball on January 16, {{baseball year|1970}}, alleging that Major League Baseball had violated federal [[antitrust]] laws. Even though Flood was making $90,000 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|90000|1969|r=0}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}){{Inflation-fn|US}} at the time, he likened the reserve clause to [[slavery]]. It was a controversial analogy, even among those who opposed the reserve clause.\n\nThe case, ''[[Flood v. Kuhn]]'' (407 U.S. 258) eventually went to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. Flood's attorney, former Supreme Court Justice [[Arthur Goldberg]], asserted that the reserve clause depressed wages and limited players to one team for life. Major League Baseball's counsel countered that Commissioner Kuhn acted under the way he did '\"for the good of the game.\"''\n\nUltimately, the Supreme Court, acting on ''[[stare decisis]]'' \"to stand by things decided\", ruled 5\u20133 in favor of Major League Baseball, upholding a {{baseball year|1922}} ruling in the case of ''[[Federal Baseball Club v. National League]]'', (259 U.S. 200.)\n\n==== Charles O. Finley ====\nThough he had a reputation as an owners' commissioner, Kuhn did not avoid confronting owners when he deemed it necessary. For example, he was a major adversary of [[Oakland Athletics]] owner [[Charles O. Finley]]. A major embarrassment for baseball resulted from Finley's actions during the [[1973 World Series]]. Finley forced player [[Mike Andrews]] to sign a false [[affidavit]] saying he was injured after the reserve infielder committed two consecutive [[error (baseball)|errors]] in the 12th inning of Oakland's Game 2 loss to the [[New York Mets]]. Andrews' teammates as well as manager [[Dick Williams]] rallied to his defense. Kuhn in return, forced Finley to reinstate Andrews. In {{baseball year|1976}}, when Finley attempted to sell several players to the [[Boston Red Sox]] and [[New York Yankees]] for $3.5 million, Kuhn blocked the deals on the grounds that they would be bad for the game. Some believe that Kuhn's actions were simply a revenge tactic, aimed at Finley, after Finley attempted to force an owners vote to remove Kuhn as commissioner in {{baseball year|1975}}.\n\n==== Kuhn's war on drugs ====\nAfter being in office for over ten years, Kuhn had grown a strong reputation for being hard on players who [[drug abuse|abused drugs]]. Kuhn was quick to punish players who used drugs with heavy fines and suspensions. [[Kansas City Royals]] catcher [[Darrell Porter]] told the [[Associated Press]] that during the winter of {{baseball year|1979}}\u2013{{baseball year|1980}} he became [[paranoia|paranoid]], convinced that Kuhn knew about his drug abuse, was trying to sneak into his house, and planned to ban him from baseball for life. Porter found himself sitting up at night in the dark watching out the front window, waiting for Kuhn to approach, clutching billiard balls and a shotgun. Ironically, when Porter was named the most valuable player of the [[1982 World Series]] while playing for the Cardinals, Kuhn was on hand to congratulate him.\n\nIn {{baseball year|1983}}, four players from the [[Kansas City Royals]] \u2013 [[Willie Wilson (baseball)|Willie Wilson]], [[Jerry Martin (baseball)|Jerry Martin]], [[Willie Aikens|Willie Mays Aikens]], and [[Vida Blue]] \u2013 were found guilty of [[cocaine]] use. In addition, such established stars as [[Ferguson Jenkins]], [[Keith Hernandez]], [[Dave Parker]], and [[Dale Berra]] admitted to having problems with drugs.\n{{See also|Pittsburgh drug trials}}\n\n==== Lifetime baseball passes ====\nIn {{baseball year|1980}}, during the [[Iranian hostage crisis]], Kuhn sat at a baseball game with [[Jeremiah Denton]], a Navy admiral and former [[prisoner of war|POW]] in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] who would be elected U.S. Senator later that year from the state of [[Alabama]]. Recalling the event to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Kuhn believed that ''\"that afternoon...the idea of a lifetime baseball pass was discussed,\"'' and upon their return from Iran, each of the 52 hostages was given one of these unique passes.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/19/AR2006011903068.html|work=The Washington Post|title=Safe at Home|first=Les|last=Carpenter|date=January 20, 2006|accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==== Leaving office ====\nKuhn was both praised and attacked for the firm stand that he levied against offenders. In {{baseball year|1982}}, some of the owners organized a move to push him out of office. In {{baseball year|1983}}, Kuhn and his supporters made a last-ditch effort to renew his contract but ultimately failed. Kuhn, though, was allowed to stay for the {{baseball year|1984}} regular season before being replaced by [[Peter Ueberroth]].\n\n=== Peter Ueberroth (1984\u20131989) ===\n[[File:Peter Ueberroth.jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[Peter Ueberroth]]]]\n[[Peter Ueberroth]] was elected to succeed [[Bowie Kuhn]] on March 3, 1984, and took office on October 1 of that year. As a condition of his hiring, Ueberroth increased the commissioner's fining ability from US$5,000 to $250,000. His salary was raised to a reported $450,000, nearly twice what Kuhn was paid.\n\nJust as Ueberroth was taking office the Major League Umpires Union was threatening to [[Strike action|strike]] the postseason. Ueberroth managed to arbitrate the disagreement and had the umpires back to work before the [[League Championship Series]] were over. The next summer, Ueberroth worked behind the scenes to limit a players' strike to one day before a new labor agreement was worked out with the [[Major League Baseball Players Association|Players Association]].\n\nDuring the course of his stint as commissioner, Ueberroth reinstated [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]] [[Willie Mays]] and [[Mickey Mantle]], who had been banned from working for Major League Baseball by Kuhn because of their associations with gambling casinos. Also, Ueberroth [[Pittsburgh drug trials#Ramifications|suspended numerous players]] because of [[cocaine]] use, negotiated a $1.1 billion [[Major League Baseball on CBS#1990\u20131993 version|television contract]] with [[CBS]],<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/15/sports/a-billion-dollar-bid-by-cbs-wins-rights-to-baseball-games.html?pagewanted=all A Billion-Dollar Bid By CBS Wins Rights To Baseball Games]</ref> and initiated the investigation against [[Pete Rose]]'s [[Dowd Report|betting habits]]. In [[1985 in baseball|1985]], Ueberroth's first full year in office, the League Championship Series expanded from a best-of-five series to a best-of-seven series. At his urging, the [[Chicago Cubs]] chose to install lights at [[Wrigley Field]] rather than reimburse the leagues for lost night-game revenues. Ueberroth then found a new source of income in the form of persuading large corporations to pay for the privilege of having their products endorsed by Major League Baseball.\n\nHowever, Ueberroth, with the assistance of the owners, also facilitated [[Baseball collusion#1985\u20131987|collusion]], an illegal violation of the league's collective bargaining agreement with the players, during the 1985, 1986 and 1987 off-seasons. Players entering free-agency were prevented from both signing equitable contracts and joining the teams of their choice during this period, a strategy that union leader [[Marvin Miller]] later held was \"tantamount to fixing, not just games, but entire pennant races, including all post-season series.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Dave|title=Baseball's Realistic Adversary|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/23/sports/sports-of-the-times-baseball-s-realistic-adversary.html|work=New York Times|date=June 23, 1991|page=S3|access-date=April 19, 2020}}</ref> The [[Major League Baseball Players Association|MLBPA]] filed [[Baseball collusion|collusion charges]], arguing that Ueberroth and team owners had violated the collective bargaining agreement in the [[1985 in baseball|1985]], [[1986 in baseball|1986]], and [[1987 in baseball|1987]] seasons.

Retrieved on 2013-07-23.</ref>\n\nUnder Ueberroth, Major League Baseball enjoyed increased attendance (record attendance four straight seasons), greater awareness of crowd control and alcohol management within ballparks, a successful and vigilant anti-drug campaign, significant industry-wide improvement in the area of fair employment, and a significantly improved financial picture for the industry. When Ueberroth took office, 21 of the 26 clubs were losing money; in Ueberroth's last full season--[[1988 in baseball|1988]]\u2014all clubs either broke even or finished in the black. In [[1987 in baseball|1987]], for example, baseball as an industry showed a net profit of $21.3 million, its first profitable year since [[1973 in baseball|1973]].\n\nNonetheless, following the announcement of the first of three large awards to the players following the collusion findings, Ueberroth stepped down as commissioner before the start of the [[1989 in baseball|1989 regular season]]; his contract was to have run through the end of the season. He was succeeded by [[National League]] president [[A. Bartlett Giamatti]].\n\n=== A. Bartlett Giamatti (1989) ===\nA [[Yale University|Yale]] professor of [[English literature]] who became president of the university, [[A. Bartlett Giamatti]] had a lifelong interest in baseball (he was a die-hard [[Boston Red Sox]] fan).  He became President of the [[National League]] in {{baseball year|1986}}.  During his stint as National League president, Giamatti placed an emphasis on the need to improve the environment for the fan in the ballparks.  He also decided to make umpires strictly enforce the [[balk]] rule, and supported \"social justice\" as the only remedy for the lack of presence of minority managers, coaches, or executives at any level in Major League Baseball.\n\nWhile still serving as National League president, Giamatti suspended [[Pete Rose]] for 30 games after Rose shoved umpire [[Dave Pallone]] on April 30, 1988.  Later that year, Giamatti also suspended [[1988 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] pitcher [[Jay Howell]], who was caught using [[pine tar]] during the [[1988 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]].\n\nGiamatti, whose tough dealing with Yale's union favorably impressed Major League Baseball owners, was unanimously elected to succeed [[Peter Ueberroth]] as commissioner on September 8, 1988 and assumed office on April 1, 1989.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/mlb/comish/giamatti.html|title=Sports Encyclopedia |access-date=2011-11-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223161021/http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/MLB/Comish/giamatti.html |archive-date=2008-12-23 |url-status=dead}}</ref>  Giamatti was commissioner on August 24, {{baseball year|1989}} when Pete Rose voluntarily agreed to permanent ineligibility from baseball.<ref>[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/p_rosea.shtml Rose agreement]</ref>  As reflected in the agreement with Pete Rose, Giamatti was determined to maintain the integrity of the game during his brief commissionership.\n{{See also|Dowd Report}}\n\nWhile at his vacation home on [[Martha's Vineyard]], Giamatti, a heavy [[tobacco smoking|smoker]] for many years, died suddenly of a massive [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the age of 51, just eight days after banishing Rose and 154 days into his tenure as commissioner.<ref>[http://thedeadballera.com/Obits/Giamatti.Bart.Obit01.html ''New York Times'' obituary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301063439/http://thedeadballera.com/Obits/Giamatti.Bart.Obit01.html |date=2009-03-01 }}</ref>  He became the second baseball commissioner to die in office, the first being [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]].

Before accepting the job as Commissioner of Baseball, Vincent consulted with Bart Giamatti's widow, Toni, to make sure she thought it was appropriate for him to do so.\n\nIn [[1990 in baseball|1990]], National League president [[Bill White (first baseman)|Bill White]] was prepared to suspend umpire [[Joe West (umpire)|Joe West]] for slamming [[1990 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia]] pitcher [[Dennis Cook]] to the field, but Vincent intervened and no discipline was imposed.\n\nDuring his commissionership, Vincent made it known (e.g. while being interviewed by [[Pat O'Brien (television)|Pat O'Brien]] during [[Major League Baseball on CBS#1990\u20131993 version|CBS]]' coverage of Game 4 of the [[1991 World Series]]) that if he had the chance, he would get rid of the [[designated hitter]] rule.\n\nVincent has also been connected with [[Pete Rose]]'s lifetime banishment from baseball; however, the investigation that led to Rose's banishment began during Ueberroth's tenure, and the banishment was levied by Giamatti and not Vincent (although Vincent led the investigation and was involved in the negotiations). Vincent has publicly said he does not support Rose's reinstatement.\n\n==== 1989 World Series ====\n{{Main|1989 World Series}}\nOn October 17, 1989, Vincent sat in a field box behind the left [[dugout (baseball)|dugout]] at San Francisco's [[Candlestick Park]]. At 5:04&nbsp;p.m., just prior to Game 3 of the World Series between the [[1989 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] and [[1989 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]], the 6.9 [[moment magnitude scale|Mw]] [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|Loma Prieta earthquake]] hit with a maximum [[Mercalli intensity scale|Mercalli intensity]] of IX (''Violent''). At approximately 5:35&nbsp;p.m., after coming to the conclusion that the power could not be restored before sunset, Vincent ordered the game to be postponed. According to Vincent, he had already made the decision to postpone Game 3 without telling anybody first. As a result, the umpires filed a formal protest of Vincent's decision. However, the game had to be postponed due to trouble with gas lines as well as the power issue.\n\nThe World Series ultimately resumed after a ten-day postponement (and some initial conflict between Vincent and San Francisco mayor [[Arthur Christ Agnos|Art Agnos]], who felt that the World Series ought to have been delayed much longer) on October 27, 1989. While presenting the [[Commissioner's Trophy (MLB)|Commissioner's Trophy]] to the Athletics, who wound up winning the World Series in a four-game sweep, Vincent summed up the 1989 World Series as a ''\"Remarkable World Series in many respects.\"''\n\n==== 1990 lockout ====\n{{Main|1990 Major League Baseball lockout}}\nIn February 1990, owners announced that spring training would not be starting as scheduled. This occurred after [[Major League Baseball Players Association|MLBPA]] Executive Director [[Donald Fehr]] became afraid that the owners would institute a [[salary cap]]. Fehr believed that a salary cap could possibly restrict the number of choices free agents could make and a pay-for-performance scale would eliminate multiyear contracts. The lockout, which was the seventh work stoppage in baseball since [[1972 in baseball|1972]], lasted 32 games and wiped out all of spring training.\n\nVincent worked with both the owners and MLBPA, and on March 19, 1990, Vincent was able to announce a new Basic Agreement (which raised the minimum major league salary from US$68,000 to $100,000 and established a six-man study committee on revenue sharing). As a consequence for the lockout, Opening Day for the [[1990 in baseball|1990]] season was moved back a week to April 9, and the season was extended by three days to accommodate the normal 162-game schedule.\n\n==== George Steinbrenner ====\nOn July 30, [[1990 in baseball|1990]], Vincent banned [[New York Yankees]] owner [[George Steinbrenner]] from baseball for life after Steinbrenner paid [[Howard Spira]], a small-time gambler, $40,000 for \"dirt\" on his outfielder [[Dave Winfield]] after Winfield sued Steinbrenner for failing to pay his foundation the $300,000 guaranteed in his contract.  Steinbrenner was eventually reinstated in [[1993 in baseball|1993]] (one year after Vincent left office).\n\n==== Steve Howe ====\nOn June 24, [[1992 in baseball|1992]], Vincent permanently suspended pitcher [[Steve Howe (baseball)|Steve Howe]] for repeated drug offenses.  Vincent was incensed when upper Yankee management ([[Buck Showalter]], [[Gene Michael]], and Jack Lawn) agreed to testify on Howe's behalf, and threatened them with expulsion from the game:\n{{cquote|You have effectively resigned from baseball by agreeing to appear at that hearing.... you should have left your conscience and your principles outside the door.}}\n\nIronically, the three men were unaffected by Vincent's hyperbole, testified for Howe as promised, and remained active in baseball.  Three months later, Vincent was removed from his job as commissioner.  An arbitrator overturned Vincent's suspension of Howe on November 11, 1992.\n\n==== 1993 expansion ====\nIn June [[1991 in baseball|1991]], Vincent declared that the [[American League]] would receive US$42 million of the [[National League]]'s $190 million in expansion revenue and that the AL would provide players in the National League expansion draft (involving the [[Colorado Rockies]] and Florida Marlins, the latter now known as the [[Miami Marlins]]).  In an attempt to win support in the American League and balance the vote, Vincent decreed that the AL owners were entitled to 22 percent of the $190 million take. This decision marked the first time in expansion history that leagues were required to share expansion revenue or provide players for another league's expansion draft.  Vincent said the owners expanded to raise money to pay their [[Baseball collusion|collusion]] debt.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n==== Realignment ====\nJust prior to leaving office, Vincent had plans to realign the National League. Vincent wanted the [[Chicago Cubs]] and [[St. Louis Cardinals]] to move from the [[National League East|Eastern Division]] to the [[National League West|Western Division]]. Part of the impetus for realignment was the geographically anomalous placement of the [[Cincinnati Reds]] and [[Atlanta Braves]] in the West and the Cubs and the Cardinals in the east since [[1969 in baseball|1969]]. National League president [[Bill White (first baseman)|Bill White]] warned Vincent that realigning without league approval would be in violation of the National League Constitution.\n\nMany thought this plan would be beneficial to the league as a whole, especially by building a regional rivalry between the new franchise in [[Florida Marlins|Miami]] and the Atlanta Braves. The Cubs, however, opposed the move, suggesting that fans in the [[Central Time Zone]] would be forced to watch more games originating on the West Coast with later broadcast times (had the realignment included the use of a balanced schedule, the Cubs would have actually played more games against teams outside their division).\n\nOn July 17, 1992, the Chicago Cubs sued Vincent and asked the [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]] in [[Chicago]] for a preliminary [[injunction]] to prevent implementation, which was granted two weeks later. After Vincent's attorneys appealed, oral arguments were scheduled for August 30 that year. Ultimately, Vincent resigned before the litigation was scheduled to resume, so as a result, the Cubs dropped their suit.\n\nAlthough Vincent's vision never really came into fruition, Major League Baseball did in fact realign in [[1994 in baseball|1994]], albeit in the form of three divisions in each league (east, central and west) and the addition of an expanded playoff format.\n\n==== Vincent's relationship with the owners ====\nHis relationship with baseball's owners was always tenuous at best; he resigned in [[1992 in baseball|1992]] after the owners gave him an 18\u20139 no confidence vote. The owners were still angry at Vincent over his intervention during the 1990 lockout. The owners were also disappointed by dwindling television [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] in light of a US$1.1 billion, [[Major League Baseball on CBS#1990\u20131993 version|four-year deal]] with [[CBS]] (which ultimately cost the network $500 million) beginning in [[1990 in baseball|1990]] (Vincent's first full season as commissioner) and upwardly spiraling salaries. (It is also important to note that CBS itself contributed to decreasing ratings thanks to the haphazard scheduling of ''[[Major League Baseball Game of the Week|Game of the Week]]'' broadcasts during the regular season to the point that fans grew tired of tuning into no baseball on summer Saturdays.) They also accused him of acting in a high-handed manner, especially in the Howe affair.\n\nThe leaders in the movement to oust Vincent were members of what ''[[The Sporting News]]'' later dubbed ''The [[Great Lakes]] Gang'':<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_n12_v218/ai_15837588 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050125020242/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_n12_v218/ai_15837588 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2005-01-25|work=The Sporting News|title=The Great Lakes gang|first=Steve|last=Marantz|year=1994}}</ref>\n\n*[[Bud Selig]], president of the [[Milwaukee Brewers]];\n*[[Jerry Reinsdorf]], chairman of the [[Chicago White Sox]];\n*Stanton Cook, head of the [[Tribune Company|Tribune Co.]], which owned the [[Chicago Cubs]];\n*[[Carl Pohlad]], owner of the [[Minnesota Twins]];\n*[[Peter O'Malley]], the longtime majority owner of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]\n\nIn his farewell, Vincent said {{cquote|To do the job without angering an owner is impossible. I can't make all twenty-eight of my bosses happy. People have told me I'm the last commissioner. If so, it's a sad thing. I hope they [the owners] learn this lesson before too much damage is done.}}\n\nHe was replaced by [[Milwaukee Brewers]] owner [[Bud Selig]], whose family continued to maintain ownership over the Brewers. Fay Vincent was never able to complete the five-year term that he had inherited from Bart Giamatti.

He was tasked by ''SS-[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Reinhard Heydrich]] with facilitating and managing the logistics involved in the mass deportation of [[Jew]]s to [[Ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe|ghettos]] and [[extermination camp]]s in [[German-occupied Europe|Nazi-occupied]] [[Eastern Europe]] during [[World War II]]. Eichmann was captured by the [[Mossad]] in [[Argentina]] on 11 May 1960 and subsequently found guilty of [[war crimes]] in a widely publicised trial in [[Jerusalem]], where he was executed by hanging in 1962.\n\nAfter an unremarkable school career, Eichmann briefly worked for his father's mining company in [[Austria]], where the family had moved in 1914. He worked as a travelling oil salesman beginning in 1927, and joined both the [[Nazi Party]] and the SS in 1932. He returned to [[Germany]] in 1933, where he joined the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD, \"Security Service\"); there he was appointed head of the department responsible for Jewish affairs\u2014especially [[emigration]], which the Nazis encouraged through violence and economic pressure. After the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Eichmann and his staff arranged for Jews to be concentrated in ghettos in major cities with the expectation that they would be transported either farther east or overseas. He also drew up plans for a Jewish reservation, first [[Nisko Plan|at Nisko]] in southeast Poland and later [[Madagascar Plan|in Madagascar]], but neither of these plans were ever carried out.\n\nThe Nazis began the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]] in June 1941, and their Jewish policy changed from emigration to extermination. To co-ordinate planning for the genocide, Heydrich, who was Eichmann's superior, hosted the regime's administrative leaders at the [[Wannsee Conference]] on 20 January 1942.  Eichmann collected information for him, attended the conference, and prepared the minutes. Eichmann and his staff became responsible for Jewish deportations to [[extermination camps]], where the victims were [[gas chamber|gassed]]. [[Operation Margarethe|Germany invaded Hungary]] in March 1944, and Eichmann oversaw the deportation of much of the Jewish population. Most of the victims were sent to [[Auschwitz concentration camp]], where about 75 per cent were murdered upon arrival. By the time that the transports were stopped in July 1944, 437,000 of Hungary's 725,000 Jews had been killed. [[Dieter Wisliceny]] testified at Nuremberg that Eichmann told him he would \"leap laughing into the grave because the feeling that he had five million people{{efn|Between 5 and 6 million{{sfn|Bauer|Rozett|1990|pp=1797, 1799}} European Jews murdered in the Holocaust.}} on his conscience would be for him a source of extraordinary satisfaction\".{{sfn|Stangneth|2014|p=297}}\n\nAfter Germany's defeat in 1945, Eichmann was captured by US forces, but escaped from a detention camp and moved around Germany to avoid re-capture. He ended up in a small village in [[Lower Saxony]], where he lived until 1950, when he moved to Argentina using false papers he obtained with help from an organisation directed by Catholic bishop [[Alois Hudal]]. Information collected by the Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, confirmed his location in 1960. A team of Mossad and [[Shin Bet]] agents captured Eichmann and brought him to Israel to stand trial on 15 criminal charges, including [[war crimes]], [[crimes against humanity]], and crimes against the Jewish people. During the trial, he did not [[Holocaust denial|deny the Holocaust]] or his role in organising it, but claimed that he was [[Nuremberg defense|simply following orders]] in a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] ''[[F\u00fchrerprinzip]]'' system.

Both organisations had known for at least two years that Eichmann was hiding in Argentina, but they did not act because it did not serve their interests in the [[Cold War]] to do so. Both were concerned about what Eichmann might say in his testimony about West German national security advisor [[Hans Globke]], who had coauthored several antisemitic Nazi laws, including the [[Nuremberg Laws]].

He was tasked by ''SS-[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Reinhard Heydrich]] with facilitating and managing the logistics involved in the mass deportation of [[Jew]]s to [[Ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe|ghettos]] and [[extermination camp]]s in [[German-occupied Europe|Nazi-occupied]] [[Eastern Europe]] during [[World War II]]. Eichmann was captured by the [[Mossad]] in [[Argentina]] on 11 May 1960 and subsequently found guilty of [[war crimes]] in a widely publicised trial in [[Jerusalem]], where he was executed by hanging in 1962.\n\nAfter an unremarkable school career, Eichmann briefly worked for his father's mining company in [[Austria]], where the family had moved in 1914. He worked as a travelling oil salesman beginning in 1927, and joined both the [[Nazi Party]] and the SS in 1932. He returned to [[Germany]] in 1933, where he joined the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD, \"Security Service\"); there he was appointed head of the department responsible for Jewish affairs\u2014especially [[emigration]], which the Nazis encouraged through violence and economic pressure. After the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Eichmann and his staff arranged for Jews to be concentrated in ghettos in major cities with the expectation that they would be transported either farther east or overseas. He also drew up plans for a Jewish reservation, first [[Nisko Plan|at Nisko]] in southeast Poland and later [[Madagascar Plan|in Madagascar]], but neither of these plans were ever carried out.\n\nThe Nazis began the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]] in June 1941, and their Jewish policy changed from emigration to extermination. To co-ordinate planning for the genocide, Heydrich, who was Eichmann's superior, hosted the regime's administrative leaders at the [[Wannsee Conference]] on 20 January 1942.  Eichmann collected information for him, attended the conference, and prepared the minutes. Eichmann and his staff became responsible for Jewish deportations to [[extermination camps]], where the victims were [[gas chamber|gassed]]. [[Operation Margarethe|Germany invaded Hungary]] in March 1944, and Eichmann oversaw the deportation of much of the Jewish population. Most of the victims were sent to [[Auschwitz concentration camp]], where about 75 per cent were murdered upon arrival. By the time that the transports were stopped in July 1944, 437,000 of Hungary's 725,000 Jews had been killed. [[Dieter Wisliceny]] testified at Nuremberg that Eichmann told him he would \"leap laughing into the grave because the feeling that he had five million people{{efn|Between 5 and 6 million{{sfn|Bauer|Rozett|1990|pp=1797, 1799}} European Jews murdered in the Holocaust.}} on his conscience would be for him a source of extraordinary satisfaction\".{{sfn|Stangneth|2014|p=297}}\n\nAfter Germany's defeat in 1945, Eichmann was captured by US forces, but escaped from a detention camp and moved around Germany to avoid re-capture. He ended up in a small village in [[Lower Saxony]], where he lived until 1950, when he moved to Argentina using false papers he obtained with help from an organisation directed by Catholic bishop [[Alois Hudal]]. Information collected by the Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, confirmed his location in 1960. A team of Mossad and [[Shin Bet]] agents captured Eichmann and brought him to Israel to stand trial on 15 criminal charges, including [[war crimes]], [[crimes against humanity]], and crimes against the Jewish people. During the trial, he did not [[Holocaust denial|deny the Holocaust]] or his role in organising it, but claimed that he was [[Nuremberg defense|simply following orders]] in a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] ''[[F\u00fchrerprinzip]]'' system. He was found guilty on all of the charges, and was [[executed by hanging]] on 1 June 1962.{{efn|The execution was prepared to take place at midnight on 31 May but was slightly delayed; Eichmann thus died a few minutes into 1 June.{{sfn|Hull|1963|p=160}}|name=1june}} The trial was widely followed in the media and was later the subject of several books, including [[Hannah Arendt]]'s ''[[Eichmann in Jerusalem]]'', in which Arendt coined the phrase \"the banality of evil\" to describe Eichmann.{{sfn|Arendt|1994|p=252}}\n\n==Early life and education==\nOtto Adolf Eichmann,{{efn|name=forenames}} the eldest of five children, was born in 1906 to a [[Calvinist]] [[Protestant]] family in [[Solingen]], Germany.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|pp=19, 26}} His parents were Adolf Karl Eichmann, a bookkeeper, and Maria (''n\u00e9e'' Schefferling), a housewife.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=19}}{{sfn|Eichmann|1961}}{{efn|name=Father's name}} The elder Adolf moved to [[Linz]], Austria, in 1913 to take a position as commercial manager for the Linz Tramway and Electrical Company, and the rest of the family followed a year later. After the death of Maria in 1916, Eichmann's father married Maria Zawrzel, a devout Protestant with two sons.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|pp=19\u201320}}\n\nEichmann attended the Kaiser Franz Joseph ''[[Realschule|Staatsoberrealschule]]'' (state secondary school) in Linz, the same high school [[Adolf Hitler]] had attended some 17 years before.{{sfn|Lipstadt|2011|p=45}} He played the violin and participated in sports and clubs, including a ''[[Wandervogel]]'' woodcraft and scouting group that included some older boys who were members of various [[right-wing]] militias.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=21}} His poor school performance resulted in his father's withdrawing him from the ''Realschule'' and enrolling him in the ''H\u00f6here Bundeslehranstalt f\u00fcr Elektrotechnik, Maschinenbau und Hochbau'' vocational college.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=21\u201322}} He left without attaining a degree and joined his father's new enterprise, the Untersberg Mining Company, where he worked for several months.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=21\u201322}} From 1925 to 1927 he worked as a sales clerk for the ''Ober\u00f6sterreichische Elektrobau AG'' radio company. Next, between 1927 and early 1933, Eichmann worked in [[Upper Austria]] and [[Salzburg]] as district agent for the [[Vacuum Oil Company|Vacuum Oil Company AG]].{{sfn|Levy|2006|p= 98}}{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=34}}\n\nDuring this time, he joined the ''Jungfrontk\u00e4mpfervereinigung'', the youth section of [[Hermann Hiltl]]'s right-wing veterans movement, and began reading newspapers published by the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP).{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|pp=28, 35}} The party platform included the dissolution of the [[Weimar Republic]] in Germany, rejection of the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], radical [[antisemitism]], and anti-[[Bolsheviks|Bolshevism]].{{sfn|Goldhagen|1996|p=85}} They promised a strong central government, increased ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (living space) for Germanic peoples, formation of a national community based on race, and racial cleansing via the active suppression of [[Jews]], who would be stripped of their citizenship and civil rights.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=179\u2013180}}\n\n==Early career==\n[[File:EichmannSSdoc.jpg|thumb|Adolf Eichmann's ''[[Lebenslauf]]'' (r\u00e9sum\u00e9) attached to his application for promotion from ''SS-[[Hauptscharf\u00fchrer]]'' to ''SS-[[Untersturmf\u00fchrer]]'' in 1937]]\nOn the advice of family friend and local [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] leader [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]], Eichmann joined the Austrian branch of the Nazi Party on 1 April 1932, member number 889,895.{{sfn|Ailsby|1997|p=40}} His membership in the SS was confirmed seven months later (SS member number 45,326).{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=28}} His regiment was ''SS-Standarte'' 37, responsible for guarding the party headquarters in Linz and protecting party speakers at rallies, which would often become violent. Eichmann pursued party activities in Linz on weekends while continuing in his position at Vacuum Oil in Salzburg.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=34}}\n\nA few months after the [[Machtergreifung|Nazi seizure of power]] in Germany in January 1933, Eichmann lost his job due to staffing cutbacks at Vacuum Oil. The Nazi Party was banned in Austria around the same time. These events were factors in Eichmann's decision to return to Germany.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=35}}\n\nLike many other National Socialists fleeing Austria in the spring of 1933, Eichmann left for [[Passau]], where he joined [[Andreas Bolek]] at his headquarters.{{sfn|Rosmus|2015|p=83 f}} After he attended a training programme at the SS depot in [[Klosterlechfeld]] in August, Eichmann returned to the Passau border in September, where he was assigned to lead an eight-man SS liaison team to guide Austrian National Socialists into Germany and smuggle propaganda material from there into Austria.{{sfn|Rosmus|2015|p=84}} In late December, when this unit was dissolved, Eichmann was promoted to ''SS-[[Scharf\u00fchrer]]'' (squad leader, equivalent to corporal).{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=37}} Eichmann's battalion of the Deutschland Regiment was quartered at barracks next door to [[Dachau concentration camp]].{{sfn|Levy|2006|p=101}}\n\nBy 1934, Eichmann requested transfer to the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD) of the SS, to escape the \"monotony\" of military training and service at Dachau. Eichmann was accepted into the SD and assigned to the sub-office on [[Freemasons]], organising seized ritual objects for a proposed museum and creating a card index of German Freemasons and Masonic organisations. He prepared an anti-Masonic exhibition, which proved to be extremely popular. Visitors included [[Hermann Goering]], [[Heinrich Himmler]], [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]], and Baron [[Leopold von Mildenstein]].{{sfn|Cooper|2011|pp=83\u201385}} Mildenstein invited Eichmann to join his Jewish Department, Section II/112 of the SD, at its [[Berlin]] headquarters.{{sfn|Padfield|2001|p=198}}{{sfn|Levy|2006|pp=103\u2013104}}{{efn|name=renamed}} Eichmann's transfer was granted in November 1934. He later came to consider this as his big break.{{sfn|Porter|2007|p=106}} He was assigned to study and prepare reports on the [[Zionist movement]] and various Jewish organisations. He even learned a smattering of [[Hebrew]] and [[Yiddish]], gaining a reputation as a specialist in Zionist and Jewish matters.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|pp=47\u201349}} On 21 March 1935 Eichmann married Veronika (Vera) Liebl (1909\u201393).{{sfn|Levy|2006|p=150}} The couple had four sons: Klaus (born 1936 in [[Berlin]]), Horst Adolf (born 1940 in [[Vienna]]), Dieter Helmut (born 1942 in [[Prague]]) and Ricardo Francisco (born 1955 in [[Buenos Aires]]).{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|pp=44, 69}}{{sfn|Glass|1995}} Eichmann was promoted to ''SS-[[Hauptscharf\u00fchrer]]'' (head squad leader) in 1936 and was commissioned as an ''SS-[[Untersturmf\u00fchrer]]'' (second lieutenant) the following year.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|pp=49, 60}}\n\n[[Nazi Germany]] used violence and economic pressure to encourage Jews to leave Germany of their own volition;{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=67\u201369}} around 250,000 of the country's 437,000 Jews emigrated between 1933 and 1939.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=127}}{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=555\u2013558}} Eichmann travelled to British [[Mandatory Palestine]] with his superior Herbert Hagen in 1937 to assess the possibility of Germany's Jews voluntarily emigrating to that country, disembarking with forged press credentials at [[Haifa]], whence they travelled to [[Cairo]] in Egypt. There they met Feival Polkes, an agent of the [[Haganah]], with whom they were unable to strike a deal.{{sfn|Levy|2006|pp=105\u2013106}} Polkes suggested that more Jews should be allowed to leave under the terms of the [[Haavara Agreement]], but Hagen refused, surmising that a strong Jewish presence in Palestine might lead to their founding an independent state, which would run contrary to Reich policy.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=55}} Eichmann and Hagen attempted to return to Palestine a few days later, but were denied entry after the British authorities refused them the required visas.{{sfn|Levy|2006|p=106}} They prepared a report on their visit, which was published in 1982.{{sfn|Mendelsohn|1982}}\n\nIn 1938, Eichmann was posted to Vienna to help organise Jewish emigration from Austria, which had just been integrated into the Reich through the ''[[Anschluss]]''.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=62}} Jewish community organisations were placed under supervision of the SD and tasked with encouraging and facilitating Jewish emigration.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=65}} Funding came from money seized from other Jewish people and organisations, as well as donations from overseas, which were placed under SD control.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=67}} Eichmann was promoted to ''SS-[[Obersturmf\u00fchrer]]'' (first lieutenant) in July 1938, and appointed to [[the Central Agency for Jewish Emigration in Vienna]], created in August.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|pp=67, 69}} By the time he left Vienna in May 1939, nearly 100,000 Jews had left Austria legally, and many more had been smuggled out to Palestine and elsewhere.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=71}}\n\n==Second World War==\n===Transition from emigration to deportation===\n[[File:General Government for the occupied Polish territories.png|thumb|Map showing the location of the [[General Government]], 1941\u20131945]]\nWithin weeks of the [[invasion of Poland]] on 1 September 1939, Nazi policy toward the Jews changed from voluntary emigration to forced [[deportation]].{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=132}} After discussions with Hitler in the preceding weeks, on 21 September ''SS-[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Reinhard Heydrich]], head of the SD, advised his staff that Jews were to be collected into cities in Poland with good rail links to facilitate their expulsion from territories controlled by Germany, starting with areas that had been incorporated into the Reich. He announced plans to create a reservation in the [[General Government]] (the portion of Poland not incorporated into the Reich), where Jews and others deemed undesirable would await further deportation.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=148\u2013149}} On 27 September 1939 the SD and the ''[[Sicherheitspolizei]]'' (SiPo, \"Security Police\") \u2013 the latter comprising the ''[[Gestapo|Geheime Staatspolizei]]'' (Gestapo) and ''[[Kriminalpolizei (Nazi Germany)|Kriminalpolizei]]'' (Kripo) police agencies \u2013 were combined into the new [[Reich Security Main Office|''Reichssicherheitshauptamt'']] (RSHA, \"Reich Security Main Office\"), which was placed under Heydrich's control.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=469, 470}}\n\nAfter a posting in [[Prague]] to assist in setting up an emigration office there, Eichmann was transferred to [[Berlin]] in October 1939 to command the ''[[Central Office for Jewish Emigration|Reichszentrale f\u00fcr J\u00fcdische Auswanderung]]'' (\"Reich Central Office for Jewish Emigration\") for the entire Reich under [[Heinrich M\u00fcller (Gestapo)|Heinrich M\u00fcller]], head of the Gestapo.{{sfn|Cesarani||2005|p=77}} He was immediately assigned to organise the deportation of 70,000 to 80,000 Jews from [[Ostrava]] district in [[Moravia]] and [[Katowice]] district in the recently annexed portion of Poland. On his own initiative, Eichmann also laid plans to deport Jews from Vienna. Under the [[Nisko Plan]], Eichmann chose [[Nisko]] as the location for a new transit camp where Jews would be temporarily housed before being deported elsewhere. In the last week of October 1939, 4,700 Jews were sent to the area by train and were essentially left to fend for themselves in an open meadow with no water and little food. Barracks were planned but never completed.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=151\u2013152}}{{sfn|Cesarani||2005|p=77}} Many of the deportees were driven by the SS into Soviet-occupied territory and others were eventually placed in a nearby labour camp.

Videotape was flown daily to the United States for broadcast the following day.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|pp=254\u2013255}}{{sfn|Shandler|1999|p=93}}\n\nThe prosecution case was presented over the course of 56 days, involving hundreds of documents and 112 witnesses (many of them Holocaust survivors).{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=262}} Hausner ignored police recommendations to call only 30 witnesses; only 14 of the witnesses called had seen Eichmann during the war.{{sfn|Porat|2004|p=624}} Hausner's intention was to not only demonstrate Eichmann's guilt but to present material about the entire Holocaust, thus producing a comprehensive record.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=252}} Hausner's opening address began, \"It is not an individual that is in the dock at this historic trial and not the Nazi regime alone, but anti-Semitism throughout history.\"{{sfn|Cole|1999|p=58}} Defence attorney Servatius repeatedly tried to curb the presentation of material not directly related to Eichmann, and was mostly successful.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=264}} In addition to wartime documents, material presented as evidence included tapes and transcripts from Eichmann's interrogation and Sassen's interviews in Argentina.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=262}} In the case of the Sassen interviews, only Eichmann's hand-written notes were admitted into evidence.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=272}}\n\n[[File:Eichman Trial judges.jpg|thumb|Eichmann's trial judges [[Benjamin Halevy]], [[Moshe Landau]], and [[Yitzhak Raveh]]]]\n[[File:1961-04-13 Tale Of Century - Eichmann Tried For War Crimes.ogv|thumb|[[Universal Newsreel]] reports the verdict]]\nSome of the evidence submitted by the prosecution took the form of [[deposition (law)|depositions]] made by leading Nazis.{{sfn|Birn|2011|p=464}} The defence demanded that the men should be brought to Israel so that the defence's right to cross-examination would not be abrogated. But Hausner, in his role as Attorney General, declared that he would be obliged to have any war criminals who entered Israel arrested.{{sfn|Birn|2011|p=464}} The prosecution proved that Eichmann had visited places where exterminations had taken place, including [[Che\u0142mno extermination camp]], Auschwitz, and [[Minsk]] (where he witnessed a mass shooting of Jews),{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=99}} and therefore was aware that the deportees were being killed.{{sfn|Arendt|1994|pp=87\u201389}}\n\nThe defence next engaged in a lengthy [[direct examination]] of Eichmann.{{sfn|Arendt|1994|p=223}} Observers such as [[Moshe Pearlman]] and [[Hannah Arendt]] have remarked on Eichmann's ordinariness in appearance and flat affect.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=257}} In his testimony throughout the trial, Eichmann insisted he had no choice but to follow orders, as he was bound by an [[Hitler oath|oath of loyalty to Hitler]]\u2014the same [[superior orders]] defence used by some defendants in the 1945\u20131946 Nuremberg trials.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|pp=284, 293}} Eichmann asserted that the decisions had been made not by him, but by M\u00fcller, Heydrich, Himmler, and ultimately Hitler.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|pp=273, 276}} Servatius also proposed that decisions of the Nazi government were [[Act of state doctrine|acts of state]] and therefore not subject to normal judicial proceedings.{{sfn|Arendt|1994|p=93}} Regarding the [[Wannsee Conference]], Eichmann stated that he felt a sense of satisfaction and relief at its conclusion. As a clear decision to exterminate had been made by his superiors, the matter was out of his hands; he felt absolved of any guilt.{{sfn|Arendt|1994|p=114}} On the last day of the examination, he stated that he was guilty of arranging the transports, but he did not feel guilty for the consequences.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=281}}\n\nThroughout his cross-examination, prosecutor Hausner attempted to get Eichmann to admit he was personally guilty, but no such confession was forthcoming.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=284}} Eichmann admitted to not liking the Jews and viewing them as adversaries, but stated that he never thought their annihilation was justified.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=285}} When Hausner produced evidence that Eichmann had stated in 1945 that \"I will leap into my grave laughing because the feeling that I have five million human beings on my conscience is for me a source of extraordinary satisfaction\", Eichmann said he meant \"enemies of the Reich\" such as the Soviets.{{sfn|Knappmann|1997|p=335}} During later examination by the judges, he admitted he meant the Jews, and said the remark was an accurate reflection of his opinion at the time.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=300}}\n\nThe trial adjourned on 14 August, and the verdict was read on 12 December.{{sfn|Arendt|1994|p=244}} Eichmann was convicted on 15 counts of crimes against humanity, war crimes, crimes against the Jewish people, and membership in a criminal organisation.{{sfn|International Crimes Database|2013}} The judges declared him not guilty of personally killing anyone and not guilty of overseeing and controlling the activities of the ''Einsatzgruppen''.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|pp=305\u2013306}} He was deemed responsible for the dreadful conditions on board the deportation trains and for obtaining Jews to fill those trains.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|pp=310\u2013311}} In addition to being found guilty of crimes against Jews, he was convicted for crimes against Poles, [[Slovenes]] and [[Romani people|Gypsies]]. Moreover, Eichmann was found guilty of membership in three organisations that had been declared criminal at the Nuremberg trials: the Gestapo, the SD, and the SS.{{sfn|International Crimes Database|2013}}{{sfn|Arendt|1994|pp=245\u2013246}} When considering the sentence, the judges concluded that Eichmann had not merely been following orders, but believed in the Nazi cause wholeheartedly and had been a key perpetrator of the genocide.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=312}} On 15 December 1961, Eichmann was sentenced to death by hanging.{{sfn|Arendt|1994|p=248}}\n\n===Appeals and execution===\n[[File:Flickr - Government Press Office (GPO) - Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann walking in yard of his cell in Ramle prison.jpg|thumb|upright|Eichmann in the yard of [[Ayalon Prison]] in Israel, 1961]]\nEichmann's defence team appealed the verdict to the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Israeli Supreme Court]]. The appeal was heard by a five-judge Supreme Court panel consisting of Supreme Court President [[Yitzhak Olshan]], who presided over the hearings, and judges [[Shimon Agranat]], [[Moshe Zilberg]], [[Yoel Zussman]], and Alfred Witkon.{{sfn|Jewish Telegraphic Agency|1962}} The defence team mostly relied on legal arguments about Israel's jurisdiction and the legality of the laws under which Eichmann was charged.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=315}} Appeal hearings took place between 22 and 29 March 1962.{{sfn|Arendt|1994|pp=248\u2013249}} Eichmann's wife Vera flew to Israel and saw him for the last time at the end of April.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=318}} On 29 May, the Supreme Court rejected the appeal and upheld the District Court's judgement on all counts.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|pp=314, 319}} Eichmann immediately petitioned Israeli President [[Yitzhak Ben-Zvi]] for [[clemency]]. The content of his letter and other trial documents were made public on 27 January 2016.{{sfn|Kershner|2016}} In addition, Servatius submitted a request for clemency to Ben-Zvi and petitioned for a stay of execution pending his planned appeals for extradition to the West German government.{{sfn|i24 News|2016}} Eichmann's wife and brothers also wrote to Ben-Zvi requesting clemency.{{sfn|Aderet|2016}} Prominent people such as [[Hugo Bergmann]], [[Pearl S. Buck]], [[Martin Buber]], and [[Ernst Simon]] spoke up on his behalf.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|pp=319\u2013320}} Ben-Gurion called a special cabinet meeting to resolve the issue. The cabinet decided not to recommend to President Ben-Zvi that Eichmann be granted clemency,{{sfn|Weitz|2007}} and Ben-Zvi rejected the clemency petition. At 8:00&nbsp;p.m. on 31 May, Eichmann was informed that his final appeal had been denied.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=320}}\n\nEichmann was [[hanging|hanged]] at a prison in [[Ramla]] hours later. The hanging, scheduled for midnight at the end of 31 May, was slightly delayed and thus took place a few minutes past midnight on 1 June 1962.{{sfn|Hull|1963|p=160}} The execution was attended by a small group of officials, four journalists and the Canadian clergyman [[William Lovell Hull]], who had been his spiritual counselor while in prison.{{sfn|Wallenstein|1962}} His last words were reported to be\n\n{{block quote|Long live Germany. Long live Argentina. Long live Austria. These are the three countries with which I have been most connected and which I will not forget. I greet my wife, my family and my friends. I am ready. We'll meet again soon, as is the fate of all men. I die believing in God.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=321}}}}\n\n[[Rafi Eitan]], who accompanied Eichmann to the hanging, claimed in 2014 to have heard him later mumble \"I hope that all of you will follow me\", making those his final words.{{sfn|Ginsburg|2014}}\n\nWithin hours Eichmann's body had been [[cremation|cremated]], and his ashes scattered in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], outside Israeli territorial waters, by an [[Israeli Navy]] patrol boat.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=323}}\n\n===Aftermath===\nThe trial and the surrounding media coverage sparked renewed interest in wartime events, and the resulting increase in publication of memoirs and scholarly works helped raise public awareness of the Holocaust.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=325}} The trial received widespread coverage by the press in West Germany, and many schools added material studying the issues to their curricula.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=334}} In Israel, the testimony of witnesses at the trial led to a deeper awareness of the impact of the Holocaust on survivors, especially among younger citizens.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=331\u2013332}} The trial therefore greatly reduced the previously popular misconception that Jews had gone \"[[like sheep to the slaughter]]\".{{sfn|Yablonka|2003|p=17}}\n\nThe use of \"Eichmann\" as an archetype stems from [[Hannah Arendt]]'s notion of the \"[[banality of evil]]\".{{sfn|Busk|2015}} Arendt, a political theorist who reported on Eichmann's trial for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', described Eichmann in her book ''[[Eichmann in Jerusalem]]'' as the embodiment of the \"banality of evil\", as she thought he appeared to have an ordinary personality, displaying neither guilt nor hatred.{{sfn|Arendt|1994|p=252}}{{sfn|Levy|2006|p=355}} In his 1988 book ''Justice, Not Vengeance'', Wiesenthal said: \"The world now understands the concept of '[[desk murderer]]'. We know that one doesn't need to be fanatical, sadistic, or mentally ill to murder millions; that it is enough to be a loyal follower eager to do one's duty.\"{{sfn|Levy|2006|pp=157\u2013158}} The term \"[[little Eichmanns]]\" became a pejorative term for bureaucrats charged with indirectly and systematically harming others.{{sfn|Mann|2017}}\n\nIn her 2011 book ''[[Eichmann Before Jerusalem]]'', based largely on the Sassen interviews and Eichmann's notes made while in exile, [[Bettina Stangneth]] argues instead that Eichmann was an ideologically motivated antisemite and lifelong committed Nazi who intentionally built a persona as a faceless bureaucrat for presentation at the trial.{{sfn|Aschheim|2014}} Prominent historians such as [[Christopher Browning]], [[Deborah Lipstadt]], [[Yaacov Lozowick]], and [[David Cesarani]] reached a similar conclusion: that Eichmann was not the unthinking bureaucratic functionary that Arendt believed him to be.{{sfn|Wolin|2016}}\n\nEichmann's youngest son Ricardo says he is not resentful toward Israel for executing his father.{{sfn|Glass|1995}}{{sfn|Sedan|1995}} He does not agree that his father's \"following orders\" argument excuses his actions and notes how his father's lack of remorse caused \"difficult emotions\" for the Eichmann family.

Developed by [[Rare (company)|Rare]], it was aimed for release on the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES), and later the [[Nintendo 64]] (N64). The plot revolved around a young boy, Edson,<!--Not \"Edison\"--><ref>{{cite tweet |user=RareLtd |number=578965642822447105 |date=20 March 2015 |title=Not sure if that's news, but the boy hero of Project Dream (pre-Banjo) was called Edson, not Edison. #bombshell #probablynotabombshell}}</ref> who caused trouble with [[pirate]]s. The SNES version of ''Dream'' used an [[Isometric computer graphics|isometric]] perspective and had a [[fairy tale]]-like theme. After transitioning to the N64, the project became a more complex [[3D computer graphics|3D]] RPG that had a greater emphasis on the pirate theme. Eventually, ''Dream'' was scaled back to a linear [[platform game]] in the vein of ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'' (1994) that starred Banjo the bear, who became the protagonist of ''Banjo-Kazooie''.\n\nThe game was developed by Rare's ''[[Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest]]'' (1995) team over the course of 16 months. It was inspired by [[History of Eastern role-playing video games#Japanese console role-playing games|Japanese RPG]]s and [[LucasArts adventure games]], and the name ''Dream'' emphasized its fantastical themes. ''Dream'' was not completed because Rare believed it was too ambitious and different from their previous games. The team's admiration for ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' (1996) and the game that became ''[[Conker's Bad Fur Day]]'' (2001) led them to retool it into a platformer. Eventually, all work on ''Dream'' was scrapped and its concepts were re-integrated into ''Banjo-Kazooie'', which released to critical and commercial success.\n\n==Premise==\n[[File:Project Dream.jpg|thumb|left|A screenshot of gameplay from the [[Nintendo 64]] version]]\nDuring most of its development period, ''Project Dream'' was a [[role-playing video game]] (RPG) that focused on a boy named Edson and his pets Dinger the dog and Billy the parrot.<ref name=\"RetroGamer\"/> In its story, a band of [[pirate]]s led by Captain Blackeye searched for \"floaty\", a substance that would allow their ships to fly.<ref name=\"HGReleases\"/> Edson got into trouble with the pirates and set off on a journey with his girlfriend to escape them.<ref name=\"GRadar9\"/> The [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES) version of the game employed an [[Isometric computer graphics|isometric]] perspective and had a [[fairy tale]]-like theme.<ref name=\"PolyGlimpse\"/> Edson used a wooden sword to fight [[troll]]s and Dinger performed actions to assist him, such as going ahead and digging holes to find items.

The SNES version of ''Dream'' used an [[Isometric computer graphics|isometric]] perspective and had a [[fairy tale]]-like theme. After transitioning to the N64, the project became a more complex [[3D computer graphics|3D]] RPG that had a greater emphasis on the pirate theme. Eventually, ''Dream'' was scaled back to a linear [[platform game]] in the vein of ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'' (1994) that starred Banjo the bear, who became the protagonist of ''Banjo-Kazooie''.\n\nThe game was developed by Rare's ''[[Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest]]'' (1995) team over the course of 16 months. It was inspired by [[Japanese RPG]]s and [[LucasArts adventure games]], and the name ''Dream'' emphasized its fantastical themes. ''Dream'' was not completed because Rare believed it was too ambitious and different from their previous games. The team's admiration for ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' (1996) and the game that became ''[[Conker's Bad Fur Day]]'' (2001) led them to retool it into a platformer. Eventually, all work on ''Dream'' was scrapped and its concepts were re-integrated into ''Banjo-Kazooie'', which released to critical and commercial success.\n\n==Premise==\n[[File:Project Dream.jpg|thumb|left|A screenshot of gameplay from the [[Nintendo 64]] version]]\nDuring most of its development period, ''Project Dream'' was a [[role-playing video game]] (RPG) that focused on a boy named Edson and his pets Dinger the dog and Billy the parrot.<ref name=\"RetroGamer\"/> In its story, a band of [[pirate]]s led by Captain Blackeye searched for \"floaty\", a substance that would allow their ships to fly.<ref name=\"HGReleases\"/> Edson got into trouble with the pirates and set off on a journey with his girlfriend to escape them.<ref name=\"GRadar9\"/> The [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES) version of the game employed an [[Isometric computer graphics|isometric]] perspective and had a [[fairy tale]]-like theme.<ref name=\"PolyGlimpse\"/> Edson used a wooden sword to fight [[troll]]s and Dinger performed actions to assist him, such as going ahead and digging holes to find items.

Before 1850 a lightly populated [[rural]] farming area, Llwynypia experienced a population boom between 1860 and 1920 with the sinking of several [[coal mine]]s after the discovery of large [[coal]] deposits throughout the [[Rhondda|Rhondda Valleys]].\n\nThe [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name means \"the [[Grove (nature)|grove]] of the [[Magpie]]\" or \"Magpie's Bush\" and was taken from the name of a farm that once existed in the area.\n\n==Early history==\nSituated on the [[River Rhondda]] Fawr where the river changes direction from south-east to southerly, Llwynypia holds evidence of human habitation from the [[Bronze Age]] through to modern times. On [[Mynydd y Gelli]], a hill overlooking the area to the west, lies the [[Iron Age]] settlement of Hen Dre'r Gelli, a site which also has several Bronze Age [[cairn]]s.\n[[Image:Llwynyia 1910.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Llwynypia looking north towards Llwynypia Hospital, (c. 1912)]]\n[[Image:Llwynypia Hospital.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Looking south over Llwynypia from the Llwynypia Hospital]]\n[[Image:ArchibaldHoodStatueLlwynypia.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Statue of Archibald Hood originally stood in front of the now demolished Miners' Institute, known locally as \"The Library\"]]\n[[Image:Narrow Terrace Llwynypia.jpg|thumb|200px|One of the narrow terraces of miners' cottages]]\nIn 1850 the first mine was sunk in the upper Rhondda in [[Treherbert]] but it was not until 1859 that Isaac Smith, manager of the Church Colliery, first attempted to prospect the area for coal when he opened a small level beneath Llwynypia Farm. After encountering numerous problems, Smith abandoned the level but in 1862 another entrepreneur, the [[Scotland|Scottish]] mining engineer [[Archibald Hood]], leased land at Llwynypia and sank the Llwynypia No. 1 pit in 1863. Although facing many difficulties at the No. 1 pit, Hood continued in his endeavours and by 1873 had sunk 4 more pits, now under the name of the Glamorgan Coal Company. Hood was a popular figure in the area and his mines became known as the 'Scotch mines', after Hood himself and the number of Scottish miners who followed him to live and work in Llwynypia. After Hood's death in 1902, he received many tributes from his workforce, and in 1906 a statue of him was unveiled by Rhondda MP [[William Abraham (Welsh politician)|William Abraham]] outside the Llwynypia [[Miners' institute]]. Much of the cost of the statue was met by donations from the miners of his pits.\n\nIn 1908 the Glamorgan Colliery became part of the Cambrian Combine Company and, in 1910\u20131911, was a scene of violent clashes during the [[Tonypandy riots]].\n\nThe very high quality of Rhondda coal was recognised by the [[Admiralty]] which specified it as the fuel of choice for the steam ships of the [[Royal Navy]] from the late 19th century. The Llwynypia pits were extracting excellent coking coals and, by the time of [[World War I]], the village housed around 140 coke ovens. By-products of the coke distillation process was used to light the mines and the narrow streets of miners' cottages known as \"terraces\". Some of the terraces have been widened but others remain so narrow that a single car can barely pass through.\n\nOn 25 January 1932, a gas explosion occurred at the colliery. Eleven workers were killed in the incident, two of whom were members of the rescue party. All perished after inhaling [[afterdamp]] following the explosion.\n\nBy 1936, of the original six pits opened at the Glamorgan, two remained in operation, employing only 560 workers, as against 2904 employed in 1923. The colliery was eventually closed in August 1945.\n\n==Notable buildings==\nBuilt in the early 1900s on the site of the Glyncornel farm, owned by the DeWinton family, Hen Glyncornel is one of the most imposing houses in the village. Built by Archibald Hood for his son William, this building was then surpassed by nearby Glyncornel House which was built by the Cambrian Coal Combine for senior management, but was turned into a maternity hospital in 1939 by [[District of Rhondda|Rhondda Borough Council]].<ref>[http://webapps.rhondda-cynon-taff.gov.uk/heritagetrail/rhondda/llwynypia/llwynypia.htm Llwynypia page, Rhondda Cynon Taf Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418060106/http://webapps.rhondda-cynon-taff.gov.uk/heritagetrail/rhondda/llwynypia/llwynypia.htm |date=2010-04-18 }}</ref>\n\nLlwynypia was also home to the largest hospital in the Rhondda.
