SOHO has also discovered over 3,000 [[comets]].<ref name=\"navy\">{{cite web |title=3,000th Comet Spotted by Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) |publisher=NASA |url=http://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/3000th-comet-spotted-by-solar-and-heliospheric-observatory-soho |accessdate=September 15, 2015}} [https://twitter.com/SungrazerComets/status/458317466998145027 (2,703 discoveries as of 21 April 2014)]</ref> It began normal operations in May 1996. It is a joint project of international cooperation between the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) and [[NASA]]. Originally planned as a two-year mission, ''SOHO'' continues to operate after over 25 years in [[space]]: the mission is extended until the end of 2020 with a likely extension until 2022.<ref>[http://sci.esa.int/director-desk/60943-extended-life-for-esas-science-missions/#1 Green light for continued operations of ESA science missions]</ref>\n\nIn addition to its scientific mission, it is a main source of near-real-time solar data for [[space weather]] prediction. Along with [[WIND (spacecraft)|Wind]], [[Advanced Composition Explorer|ACE]] and [[Deep Space Climate Observatory|DSCOVR]], ''SOHO'' is one of four spacecraft in the vicinity of the [[Earth]]\u2013[[Sun]] [[Lagrange point|L1]] point, a point of gravitational balance located approximately 0.99 [[Astronomical unit|astronomical unit (AU)s]] from the Sun and 0.01&nbsp;AU from the Earth. In addition to its scientific contributions, ''SOHO'' is distinguished by being the first three-axis-stabilized spacecraft to use its [[reaction wheel]]s as a kind of virtual [[gyroscope]]; the technique was adopted after an on-board emergency in 1998 that nearly resulted in the loss of the spacecraft.\n\n==Scientific objectives==\nThe three main scientific objectives of ''SOHO'' are:\n* Investigation of the outer layer of the Sun, which consists of the [[chromosphere]], [[solar transition region|transition region]], and the [[solar corona|corona]]. CDS, EIT, [[LASCO Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph|LASCO]], SUMER, SWAN, and UVCS are used for this [[Sun#Atmosphere|solar atmosphere]] remote sensing.\n* Making observations of [[solar wind]] and associated phenomena in the vicinity of {{L1}}. CELIAS and COSTEP are used for \"[[in situ]]\" solar wind observations.\n* Probing the interior structure of the Sun. GOLF, MDI, and VIRGO are used for [[helioseismology]].\n\n==Orbit==\n{{multiple image | align =left| direction = vertical| width = \n| header = Animation of SOHO{{'s}} trajectory \n| image1 = Animation of Solar and Heliospheric Observatory trajectory - Polar view.gif\n| caption1 = Polar view\n| image2 = Animation of Solar and Heliospheric Observatory trajectory - Equatorial view.gif \n| caption2 = Equatorial view\n| footer ={{legend2| RoyalBlue| Earth}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|Magenta| SOHO}}\n}}\n\nThe ''SOHO'' spacecraft is in a [[halo orbit]] around the [[Sun]]\u2013[[Earth]] [[Lagrange point|L1 point]], the point between the Earth and the Sun where the balance of the (larger) Sun's gravity and the (smaller) Earth's gravity is equal to the [[centripetal]] force needed for an object to have the same [[orbital period]] in its orbit around the Sun as the Earth, with the result that the object will stay in that relative position.\n\nAlthough sometimes described as being at L1, the ''SOHO'' [[spacecraft]] is not exactly at L1 as this would make communication difficult due to radio interference generated by the Sun, and because this would not be a [[Lagrange point#Stability|stable]] orbit. Rather it lies in the (constantly moving) plane which passes through L1 and is perpendicular to the line connecting the Sun and the Earth. It stays in this plane, tracing out an elliptical [[lissajous orbit]] centered about L1. It orbits L1 once every six months, while L1 itself orbits the Sun every 12 months as it is coupled with the motion of the Earth. This keeps ''SOHO'' at a good position for communication with Earth at all times.\n\n==Communication with Earth==\nIn normal operation the spacecraft transmits a continuous 200 kbit/s data stream of photographs and other measurements via the NASA [[Deep Space Network]] of ground stations. ''SOHO'''s data about solar activity are used to predict [[coronal mass ejection]] (CME) arrival times at earth, so [[electrical grid]]s and [[satellite]]s can be protected from their damaging effects. CMEs directed toward the earth may produce [[geomagnetic storm]]s, which in turn produce [[geomagnetically induced current]]s, in the most extreme cases creating black-outs, etc.\n\nIn 2003 ESA reported the failure of the antenna [[Cartesian coordinate system|Y-axis]] [[stepper motor]], necessary for pointing the [[high-gain antenna]] and allowing the downlink of high-rate data. At the time, it was thought that the antenna anomaly might cause two- to three-week data-blackouts every three months.<ref>{{cite web | work=ESA news | title=Antenna anomaly may affect SOHO scientific data transmission | url=http://spdext.estec.esa.nl/content/news/index.cfm?aid=1&cid=1&oid=32426 | accessdate=March 14, 2005 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> However, ESA and NASA engineers managed to use ''SOHO''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[low-gain antenna]]s together with the larger 34 and 70 meter DSN ground stations and judicious use of ''SOHO''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Solid State Recorder]] (SSR) to prevent total data loss, with only a slightly reduced data flow every three months.<ref>{{cite web | work=ESA news | title=''SOHO''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s antenna anomaly: things are much better than expected | url=http://www.esa.int/export/esaCP/SEM0VZWO4HD_index_0.html | accessdate=March 14, 2005}}</ref>\n\n==Near loss of SOHO==\nThe SOHO Mission Interruption sequence of events began on June 24, 1998, while the SOHO Team was conducting a series of spacecraft [[gyroscope]] calibrations and maneuvers. Operations proceeded until 23:16 UTC when SOHO lost [[Celestial navigation|lock]] on the Sun, and entered an emergency [[attitude control]] mode called Emergency Sun Reacquisition (ESR). The SOHO Team attempted to recover the observatory, but SOHO entered the [[Safe mode (spacecraft)|emergency mode]] again on June 25 02:35 UTC. Recovery efforts continued, but SOHO entered the emergency mode for the last time at 04:38 UTC. All contact with SOHO was lost at 4:43 UTC, and the mission interruption had begun. SOHO was spinning, losing electrical power, and no longer pointing at the Sun.<ref>[https://umbra.nascom.nasa.gov/soho/SOHO_final_report.html SOHO \"Mission Interruption Joint NASA/ESA Investigation Board Final Report.\"] ''NASA.'' Retrieved: March 12, 2018.</ref>\n\nExpert [[ESA]] personnel were immediately dispatched from Europe to the United States to direct operations. Days passed without contact from SOHO. On July 23, the [[Arecibo Observatory]] and [[Goldstone Solar System Radar]] combined to locate SOHO with [[radar]], and to determine its location and [[Angle of attack|attitude]]. SOHO was close to its predicted position, oriented with its side versus the usual front [[Optical Surface Reflector]] panel pointing toward the Sun, and was rotating at one [[Revolutions per minute|revolutions]] every 53 seconds. Once SOHO was located, plans for contacting SOHO were formed. On August 3 a [[Carrier wave|carrier]] was detected from SOHO, the first signal since June 25. After days of charging the [[battery (electricity)|battery]], a successful attempt was made to [[modulation|modulate]] the carrier and downlink [[telemetry]] on August 8. After instrument temperatures were downlinked on August 9, [[data analysis]] was performed, and planning for the SOHO recovery began in earnest.<ref name=\"Aerospace America\">{{cite journal|last1=David|first1=Leonard|title=Saving SOHO|journal=Aerospace America|date=May 1999|url=http://soho.nascom.nasa.gov/operations/Recovery/aerospace.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe Recovery Team began by allocating the limited electrical power. After this, SOHO's anomalous orientation in space was determined. Thawing the frozen [[hydrazine]] fuel tank using SOHO's [[thermal control]] heaters began on August 12. Thawing pipes and the [[Rocket engine|thrusters]] was next, and SOHO was re-oriented towards the Sun on September 16. After nearly a week of spacecraft bus recovery activities and an orbital correction maneuver, the SOHO spacecraft (bus) returned to normal mode on September 25 at 19:52 UTC. Recovery of the instruments began on October 5 with SUMER, and ended on October 24, 1998 with CELIAS.<ref name=\"ESA Recovery\">{{cite web |title=SOHO's Recovery: An Unprecedented Success Story |url=https://www.esa.int/esapub/bulletin/bullet97/vandenbu.pdf |publisher=European Space Agency |accessdate=March 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOnly one [[gyroscope|gyro]] remained operational after this recovery, and on December 21 that gyro failed. Attitude control was accomplished with manual thruster firings that consumed 7&nbsp;kg of fuel weekly, while the ESA developed a new [[gyroless operations]] mode that was successfully implemented on February 1, 1999.<ref name = \"ESA Recovery\"/>\n\n==Instruments==\n[[File:Solar_and_Heliospheric_Observatory.jpg|thumb|Scale model of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft at the Euro Space Center in Belgium]]\nThe ''SOHO'' Payload Module (PLM) consists of twelve instruments, each capable of independent or coordinated observation of the Sun or parts of the Sun, and some spacecraft components.

The MDI was the biggest producer of data on ''SOHO''. Two of SOHO's [[virtual channel]]s are named for MDI; VC2 (MDI-M) carries MDI [[magnetogram]] data, and VC3 (MDI-H) carries MDI [[Helioseismology]] data. MDI has not been used for scientific observation since 2011 when it was superseded by the [[Solar Dynamics Observatory#Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)|Solar Dynamics Observatory's Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://soi.stanford.edu/|title=MDI Web Page|website=soi.stanford.edu|access-date=January 16, 2019}}</ref>\n* '''Solar Ultraviolet Measurement of Emitted Radiation''' ('''[https://web.archive.org/web/20060615104607/http://www.mps.mpg.de/en/projekte/soho/sumer/ SUMER]''') which measures plasma flows, temperature and density in the corona.\n* '''Solar Wind Anisotropies''' ('''[http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/data/summary/swan/ SWAN]''') which uses telescopes sensitive to a characteristic wavelength of hydrogen to measure the solar wind mass flux, map the density of the heliosphere, and observe the large-scale structure of the solar wind streams.\n* '''UltraViolet Coronagraph Spectrometer''' ('''[http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/uvcs/ UVCS]''') which measures density and temperature in the corona.\n* '''Variability of solar IRradiance and Gravity Oscillations''' ('''[http://www.ias.u-psud.fr/virgo/ VIRGO]''') which measures oscillations and solar constant both of the whole solar disk and at low resolution, again exploring the core of the Sun.\n\n===Public availability of images===\nObservations from some of the instruments can be formatted as images, most of which are also readily available on the [[internet]] for either public or research use (see [http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/data/realtime-images.html the official website]). Others such as [[energy spectrum|spectra]] and measurements of particles in the [[solar wind]] do not lend themselves so readily to this. These images range in [[wavelength]] or [[frequency]] from [[optical]] ([[H-alpha|H\u03b1]]) to extreme [[ultraviolet]] (UV). Images taken partly or exclusively with non-visible wavelengths are shown on the ''SOHO'' page and elsewhere in [[False-color|false color]].\n\nUnlike many space-based and ground telescopes, there is no time formally allocated by the SOHO program for observing proposals on individual instruments: interested parties can contact the instrument teams directly via e-mail and the SOHO web site to request time via that instrument team's internal processes (some of which are quite informal, provided that the ongoing reference observations are not disturbed). A formal process (the \"JOP\" program) does exist for using multiple SOHO instruments collaboratively on a single observation. JOP proposals are reviewed at the quarterly Science Working Team (\"SWT\") meetings, and JOP time is allocated at monthly meetings of the Science Planning Working Group. First results\nhave been presented in Solar Physics, volumes 170 and 175 (1997), edited by B. Fleck and\nZ. \u0160vestka.\n\n===Comet discovery===\n[[File:Sixteen Comets Touring the Inner Solar System.webm|thumb|left|This visualization presents a small sample of the 9 years of comets seen by SOHO from the perspective an observer at a fixed point above the ecliptic plane with the Sun at the center.]]\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center; font-size:11px; float:right; margin:2px\"\n|- bgcolor= style=\"font-size: smaller;\"\n| colspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''Comet discoveries'''<ref name=\"Battams2014\">{{cite tweet|user=SungrazerComets|author=Karl Battams|number=456478399930720256|date=April 16, 2014|title=These are SOHO discovery counts in the past few years: 2013: 213, 2012: 222, 2011: 216, 2010: 209 ... consistent!}}</ref><ref name=\"Battams2013\">{{cite tweet|user=SungrazerComets|author=Karl Battams|number=286609127373942785|date=January 2, 2013|title=The SOHO comet discovery rate has been remarkably consistent over past 3yrs: 2010: 222 comets, 2011: 213, 2012: 219}}</ref>\n|-\n!

It is a joint project of international cooperation between the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) and [[NASA]]. Originally planned as a two-year mission, ''SOHO'' continues to operate after over 25 years in [[space]]: the mission is extended until the end of 2020 with a likely extension until 2022.<ref> [http://sci.esa.int/director-desk/60943-extended-life-for-esas-science-missions/#1 Green light for continued operations of ESA science missions]</ref>\n\nIn addition to its scientific mission, it is a main source of near-real-time solar data for [[space weather]] prediction. Along with [[WIND (spacecraft)|Wind]], [[Advanced Composition Explorer|ACE]] and [[Deep Space Climate Observatory|DSCOVR]], ''SOHO'' is one of four spacecraft in the vicinity of the [[Earth]]\u2013[[Sun]] [[Lagrange point|L1]] point, a point of gravitational balance located approximately 0.99 [[Astronomical unit|astronomical unit (AU)s]] from the Sun and 0.01&nbsp;AU from the Earth. In addition to its scientific contributions, ''SOHO'' is distinguished by being the first three-axis-stabilized spacecraft to use its [[reaction wheel]]s as a kind of virtual [[gyroscope]]; the technique was adopted after an on-board emergency in 1998 that nearly resulted in the loss of the spacecraft.\n\n==Scientific objectives==\nThe three main scientific objectives of ''SOHO'' are:\n* Investigation of the outer layer of the Sun, which consists of the [[chromosphere]], [[solar transition region|transition region]], and the [[corona]]. CDS, EIT, [[LASCO Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph|LASCO]], SUMER, SWAN, and UVCS are used for this [[Sun#Atmosphere|solar atmosphere]] remote sensing.\n* Making observations of [[solar wind]] and associated phenomena in the vicinity of {{L1}}. CELIAS and COSTEP are used for \"[[in situ]]\" solar wind observations.\n* Probing the interior structure of the Sun. GOLF, MDI, and VIRGO are used for [[helioseismology]].\n\n==Orbit==\n{{multiple image | align =left| direction = vertical| width = \n| header = Animation of SOHO{{'s}} trajectory \n| image1 = Animation of Solar and Heliospheric Observatory trajectory - Polar view.gif\n| caption1 = Polar view\n| image2 = Animation of Solar and Heliospheric Observatory trajectory - Equatorial view.gif \n| caption2 = Equatorial view\n| footer ={{legend2| RoyalBlue| Earth}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|Magenta| SOHO}}\n}}\n\nThe ''SOHO'' spacecraft is in a [[halo orbit]] around the [[Sun]]\u2013[[Earth]] [[Lagrange point|L1 point]], the point between the Earth and the Sun where the balance of the (larger) Sun's gravity and the (smaller) Earth's gravity is equal to the [[centripetal]] force needed for an object to have the same [[orbital period]] in its orbit around the Sun as the Earth, with the result that the object will stay in that relative position.\n\nAlthough sometimes described as being at L1, the ''SOHO'' [[spacecraft]] is not exactly at L1 as this would make communication difficult due to radio interference generated by the Sun, and because this would not be a [[Lagrange point#Stability|stable]] orbit. Rather it lies in the (constantly moving) plane which passes through L1 and is perpendicular to the line connecting the Sun and the Earth. It stays in this plane, tracing out an elliptical [[lissajous orbit]] centered about L1. It orbits L1 once every six months, while L1 itself orbits the Sun every 12 months as it is coupled with the motion of the Earth. This keeps ''SOHO'' at a good position for communication with Earth at all times.\n\n==Communication with Earth==\nIn normal operation the spacecraft transmits a continuous 200 kbit/s data stream of photographs and other measurements via the NASA [[Deep Space Network]] of ground stations. ''SOHO'''s data about solar activity are used to predict [[coronal mass ejection]] (CME) arrival times at earth, so [[electrical grid]]s and [[satellite]]s can be protected from their damaging effects. CMEs directed toward the earth may produce [[geomagnetic storm]]s, which in turn produce [[geomagnetically induced current]]s, in the most extreme cases creating black-outs, etc.\n\nIn 2003 ESA reported the failure of the antenna [[Cartesian coordinate system|Y-axis]] [[stepper motor]], necessary for pointing the [[high-gain antenna]] and allowing the downlink of high-rate data. At the time, it was thought that the antenna anomaly might cause two- to three-week data-blackouts every three months.<ref>{{cite web | work=ESA news | title=Antenna anomaly may affect SOHO scientific data transmission | url=http://spdext.estec.esa.nl/content/news/index.cfm?aid=1&cid=1&oid=32426 | accessdate=March 14, 2005 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> However, ESA and NASA engineers managed to use ''SOHO''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[low-gain antenna]]s together with the larger 34 and 70 meter DSN ground stations and judicious use of ''SOHO''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Solid State Recorder]] (SSR) to prevent total data loss, with only a slightly reduced data flow every three months.<ref>{{cite web | work=ESA news | title=''SOHO''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s antenna anomaly: things are much better than expected | url=http://www.esa.int/export/esaCP/SEM0VZWO4HD_index_0.html | accessdate=March 14, 2005}}</ref>\n\n==Near loss of SOHO==\nThe SOHO Mission Interruption sequence of events began on June 24, 1998, while the SOHO Team was conducting a series of spacecraft [[gyroscope]] calibrations and maneuvers. Operations proceeded until 23:16 UTC when SOHO lost [[Celestial navigation|lock]] on the Sun, and entered an emergency [[attitude control]] mode called Emergency Sun Reacquisition (ESR). The SOHO Team attempted to recover the observatory, but SOHO entered the [[Safe mode (spacecraft)|emergency mode]] again on June 25 02:35 UTC. Recovery efforts continued, but SOHO entered the emergency mode for the last time at 04:38 UTC. All contact with SOHO was lost at 4:43 UTC, and the mission interruption had begun. SOHO was spinning, losing electrical power, and no longer pointing at the Sun.<ref>[https://umbra.nascom.nasa.gov/soho/SOHO_final_report.html SOHO \"Mission Interruption Joint NASA/ESA Investigation Board Final Report.\"] ''NASA.'' Retrieved: March 12, 2018.</ref>\n\nExpert [[ESA]] personnel were immediately dispatched from Europe to the United States to direct operations. Days passed without contact from SOHO. On July 23, the [[Arecibo Observatory]] and [[Goldstone Solar System Radar]] combined to locate SOHO with [[radar]], and to determine its location and [[Angle of attack|attitude]]. SOHO was close to its predicted position, oriented with its side versus the usual front [[Optical Surface Reflector]] panel pointing toward the Sun, and was rotating at one [[Revolutions per minute|revolutions]] every 53 seconds. Once SOHO was located, plans for contacting SOHO were formed. On August 3 a [[Carrier wave|carrier]] was detected from SOHO, the first signal since June 25. After days of charging the [[battery (electricity)|battery]], a successful attempt was made to [[modulation|modulate]] the carrier and downlink [[telemetry]] on August 8. After instrument temperatures were downlinked on August 9, [[data analysis]] was performed, and planning for the SOHO recovery began in earnest.<ref name=\"Aerospace America\">{{cite journal|last1=David|first1=Leonard|title=Saving SOHO|journal=Aerospace America|date=May 1999|url=http://soho.nascom.nasa.gov/operations/Recovery/aerospace.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe Recovery Team began by allocating the limited electrical power. After this, SOHO's anomalous orientation in space was determined. Thawing the frozen [[hydrazine]] fuel tank using SOHO's [[thermal control]] heaters began on August 12. Thawing pipes and the [[Rocket engine|thrusters]] was next, and SOHO was re-oriented towards the Sun on September 16. After nearly a week of spacecraft bus recovery activities and an orbital correction maneuver, the SOHO spacecraft (bus) returned to normal mode on September 25 at 19:52 UTC. Recovery of the instruments began on October 5 with SUMER, and ended on October 24, 1998 with CELIAS.<ref name=\"ESA Recovery\">{{cite web |title=SOHO's Recovery: An Unprecedented Success Story |url=https://www.esa.int/esapub/bulletin/bullet97/vandenbu.pdf |publisher=European Space Agency |accessdate=March 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOnly one [[gyroscope|gyro]] remained operational after this recovery, and on December 21 that gyro failed. Attitude control was accomplished with manual thruster firings that consumed 7&nbsp;kg of fuel weekly, while the ESA developed a new [[gyroless operations]] mode that was successfully implemented on February 1, 1999.<ref name = \"ESA Recovery\"/>\n\n==Instruments==\n[[File:Solar_and_Heliospheric_Observatory.jpg|thumb|Scale model of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft at the Euro Space Center in Belgium]]\nThe ''SOHO'' Payload Module (PLM) consists of twelve instruments, each capable of independent or coordinated observation of the Sun or parts of the Sun, and some spacecraft components.

The MDI was the biggest producer of data on ''SOHO''. Two of SOHO's [[virtual channel]]s are named for MDI; VC2 (MDI-M) carries MDI [[magnetogram]] data, and VC3 (MDI-H) carries MDI [[Helioseismology]] data.

Others such as [[energy spectrum|spectra]] and measurements of particles in the [[solar wind]] do not lend themselves so readily to this. These images range in [[wavelength]] or [[frequency]] from [[optical]] ([[H-alpha|H\u03b1]]) to extreme [[ultraviolet]] (UV). Images taken partly or exclusively with non-visible wavelengths are shown on the ''SOHO'' page and elsewhere in [[False-color|false color]].\n\nUnlike many space-based and ground telescopes, there is no time formally allocated by the SOHO program for observing proposals on individual instruments: interested parties can contact the instrument teams directly via e-mail and the SOHO web site to request time via that instrument team's internal processes (some of which are quite informal, provided that the ongoing reference observations are not disturbed). A formal process (the \"JOP\" program) does exist for using multiple SOHO instruments collaboratively on a single observation. JOP proposals are reviewed at the quarterly Science Working Team (\"SWT\") meetings, and JOP time is allocated at monthly meetings of the Science Planning Working Group. First results\nhave been presented in Solar Physics, volumes 170 and 175 (1997), edited by B. Fleck and\nZ. \u0160vestka.\n\n===Comet discovery===\n[[File:Sixteen Comets Touring the Inner Solar System.webm|thumb|left|This visualization presents a small sample of the 9 years of comets seen by SOHO from the perspective an observer at a fixed point above the ecliptic plane with the Sun at the center.]]\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center; font-size:11px; float:right; margin:2px\"\n|- bgcolor= style=\"font-size: smaller;\"\n| colspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''Comet discoveries'''<ref name=\"Battams2014\">{{cite tweet|user=SungrazerComets|author=Karl Battams|number=456478399930720256|date=April 16, 2014|title=These are SOHO discovery counts in the past few years: 2013: 213, 2012: 222, 2011: 216, 2010: 209 ... consistent!}}</ref><ref name=\"Battams2013\">{{cite tweet|user=SungrazerComets|author=Karl Battams|number=286609127373942785|date=January 2, 2013|title=The SOHO comet discovery rate has been remarkably consistent over past 3yrs: 2010: 222 comets, 2011: 213, 2012: 219}}</ref>\n|-\n!

However, he accepted interventions in the economy such as a tax on alcohol, if there were sufficient [[utilitarian]] grounds. He also accepted the principle of legislative intervention for the purpose of animal welfare.{{sfnm|1a1=Linzey|1y=2002|2a1=Morris|2y=2002}} Mill originally believed that equality of taxation meant [[equality of sacrifice]] and that [[progressive tax]]ation penalised those who worked harder and saved more and was therefore a \"mild form of robbery\".{{sfn|Pellerin|2009}}\n\nGiven an equal tax rate regardless of income, Mill agreed that [[inheritance]] should be taxed. A utilitarian society would agree that everyone should be equal one way or another. Therefore, receiving inheritance would put one ahead of society unless taxed on the inheritance. Those who donate should consider and choose carefully where their money goes\u2014some charities are more deserving than others. Considering public charities boards such as a government will disburse the money equally. However, a private charity board like a church would disburse the monies fairly to those who are in more need than others.{{sfn|Strasser|1991}}\n\nMill later altered his views toward a more socialist bent, adding chapters to his ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' in defence of a socialist outlook and defending some socialist causes.{{sfn|Bentham|Mill|2004|p=11}} Within this revised work, he also made the radical proposal that the whole wage system be abolished in favour of a co-operative wage system.{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2007|1loc=\"Political Economy\"|2a1=Hill|2y=2020|2p=52}} Nonetheless, some of his views on the idea of flat taxation remained,{{sfn|Wilson|2007|loc=\"Political Economy\"}} albeit altered in the third edition of the ''Principles of Political Economy'' to reflect a concern for differentiating restrictions on unearned incomes which he favoured; and those on earned incomes which he did not favour.{{sfn|Mill|1852|loc=\"On The General Principles of Taxation, V.2.14\"|ps=. The passage about flat taxation was altered by the author in this edition which is acknowledged in this edition's footnote 8: \"This sentence replaced in the 3rd ed. a sentence of the original: \"It is partial taxation, which is a mild form of robbery.\"}}\n\nIn the case of [[Oxford University]], Mill's ''Principles of Political Economy'', first published in 1848, was the standard text until 1919 when it was replaced by [[Alfred Marshall]]'s ''[[Principles of Economics (Marshall)|Principles of Economics]]''. As [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations|Wealth of Nations]]'' had during an earlier period, Mill's ''Principles of Economy'' dominated economics teaching and was one of the most widely read of all books on economics in the period.{{sfn|Ekelund Jr.|H\u00e9bert|1997|p=172}}\n\nIn later editions of ''Principles of Political Economy'', Mill would argue that \"as far as economic theory was concerned, there is nothing in principle in economic theory that precludes an economic order based on socialist policies\".{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2007|1loc=\"Political Economy\"|2a1=Baum|2y=2007|ps=: \"Mill, in contrast, advances a form of liberal democratic socialism for the enlargement of freedom as well as to realize social and distributive justice. He offers a powerful account of economic injustice and justice that is centered on his understanding of freedom and its conditions.\"}} At some point, Mill also promoted substituting capitalist businesses with [[worker cooperatives]],{{sfn|Schwartz|2012|page=219}} writing: <blockquote>The form of association, however, which if mankind continue to improve, must be expected in the end to predominate, is not that which can exist between a capitalist as chief, and work-people without a voice in the management, but the association of the labourers themselves on terms of equality, collectively owning the capital with which they carry on their operations, and working under managers elected and removable by themselves.{{sfn|Mill|1848|loc=\"IV.7.21.\"|ps=none}}</blockquote>\n\n==== Ethical socialism ====\n[[File:R. H. Tawney.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[R. H. Tawney]], founder of [[ethical socialism]]]]\nLiberal socialism has exercised influence in British politics, especially in the variant known as [[ethical socialism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Dearlove|1a2=Saunders|1y=2000|1p=427|2a1=Thompson|2y=2006|2p=52}} A key component of ethical socialism is in its emphasis on moral and ethical critiques of capitalism and building a case for socialism on moral or spiritual grounds as opposed to [[rationalist]] and [[historical materialism|materialist]] grounds. Ethical socialists advocated a mixed economy that involves an acceptance of a role of both [[public enterprise]] as well as [[Social responsibility|socially responsible]] [[private enterprise]].{{sfn|Thompson|2006|pp=60\u201361}} Ethical socialism was founded by [[Christian socialism|Christian socialist]] [[R. H. Tawney]] and its ideals were also connected to [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] and [[Guild socialism|guild-socialist]] values.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|pp=52, 58, 60}}\n\nIt emphasises the need for a morally conscious economy based upon the principles of service, cooperation and [[social justice]] while opposing possessive [[individualism]].{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=58}} Ethical socialism is distinct in its focus on criticism of the ethics of capitalism and not merely criticism of material issues of capitalism. Tawney denounced the self-seeking amoral and immoral behaviour that he claimed is supported by capitalism.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=52}} He opposed what he called the \"acquisitive society\" that causes private property to be used to transfer surplus profit to \"functionless owners\"\u2014[[rentier capitalism|capitalist rentiers]].{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=58}} However, Tawney did not denounce managers as a whole, believing that management and employees could join together in a political alliance for reform.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=58}} He supported the pooling of surplus profit through means of [[progressive taxation]] to redistribute these funds to provide [[social welfare]], including [[public health care]], [[public education]] and [[public housing]].{{sfn|Thompson|2006|pp=58\u201359}}\n\nTawney advocated nationalisation of strategic industries and services.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=59}} He also advocated worker participation in the business of management in the economy as well as consumer, employee, employer and state cooperation in the economy.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=59}} Though he supported a substantial role for public enterprise in the economy, Tawney stated that where private enterprise provided a service that was commensurate with its rewards that was functioning private property, then a business could be usefully and legitimately be left in private hands.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|pp=60\u201361}} Ethical socialist [[Thomas Hill Green]] supported the right of [[equal opportunity]] for all individuals to be able freely appropriate property, but he claimed that acquisition of wealth did not imply that an individual could do whatever they wanted to once that wealth was in their possession. Green opposed \"[[property rights]] of the few\" that were preventing the ownership of property by the many.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=35}}\n\nEthical socialism is an important ideology of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]]. Labour [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Clement Attlee]] supported the ideology, which played a large role in his party's policies during the postwar 1940s.{{sfn|Howell|2006|pp=130\u2013132}} Half a century after Attlee's tenure, [[Tony Blair]], another Labour Prime Minister, also described himself as an adherent of ethical socialism, which for him embodies the values of \"social justice, the equal worth of each citizen, equality of opportunity, community\".{{sfn|Jackson|Tansey|2008|p=97}} Influenced by Attlee and [[John Macmurray]] (who himself was influenced by Green),{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=189\u2013190}} Blair has defined the ideology in similar terms as earlier adherents\u2014with an  emphasis on the [[common good]], rights and responsibilities as well as support of an organic society in which individuals flourish through cooperation.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=189\u2013190}} Blair argued that Labour ran into problems in the 1960s and 1970s when it abandoned ethical socialism and that its recovery required a return to the values promoted by the Attlee government.{{sfn|Bastow|Martin|2003|p=72}} However, Blair's critics (both inside and outside Labour) have accused him of completely abandoning socialism in favour of capitalism.{{sfn|Eliott|Faucher-King|Le Gal\u00e8s|2010|p=18}}\n\n=== Germany ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F057884-0009, Willy Brandt.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Willy Brandt]], [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Chancellor of West Germany]] (1969\u20131974)]]\nAn early version of liberal socialism was developed in Germany by [[Franz Oppenheimer]].{{sfn|Rep|2000|p=238}} Although he was committed to socialism, Oppenheimer's theories inspired the development of the [[social liberalism]] that was pursued by [[Chancellor of Germany|German Chancellor]] [[Ludwig Erhard]], who said the following: \"As long as I live, I will not forget Franz Oppenheimer! I will be as happy if the [[social market economy]]\u2014as perfect or imperfect as it might be\u2014continues to bear witness to the work, to the intellectual stance of the ideas and teachings of Franz Oppenheimer\".{{sfn|Rep|2000|p=238}}\n\nIn the 1930s, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), a [[reformist socialist]] political party that was up to then based upon [[Marxist revisionism|revisionist Marxism]], began a transition away from Marxism towards liberal socialism. After it was banned by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]] in 1933, the SPD acted in exile through the [[Sopade]]. In 1934, the Sopade began to publish material that indicated that the SPD was turning towards liberal socialism.{{sfn|Edinger|1956|p=215}} {{ill|Curt Heyer|de}}, a prominent proponent of liberal socialism within the Sopade, declared that Sopade represented the tradition of [[Weimar Republic]] [[social democracy]] (a form of liberal [[democratic socialism]]) and declared that Sopade's held true to its mandate of traditional liberal principles combined with the political realism of socialism.{{sfn|Edinger|1956|pp=219\u2013220}} After the restoration of democracy in West Germany, the SPD's [[Godesberg Program]] in 1959 eliminated the party's remaining Marxist policies. The SPD then became officially based upon liberal socialism ({{lang-de|freiheitlicher Sozialismus}}).{{sfn|Orlow|2000|p=108}} West German Chancellor Willy Brandt has been identified as a liberal socialist.{{sfn|Bronner|1999|p=104}}\n\n=== Italy ===\n[[File:Carlo Rosselli 1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Carlo Rosselli]]]]\nItalian socialist [[Carlo Rosselli]] was inspired by the definition of socialism by the founder of [[social democracy]], [[Eduard Bernstein]], who defined socialism as \"organised liberalism\". Rosselli expanded on Bernstein's arguments by developing his notion of liberal socialism ({{lang-it|socialismo liberale}}).{{sfnm|1a1=Rosselli|1y=1994|2a1=Steger|2y=2006|2p=146}} In 1925, Rosselli defined the ideology in his work of the same name in which he supported the type of socialist economy defined by socialist economist [[Werner Sombart]] in ''Der modern Kapitalismus'' (1908) that envisaged a new modern mixed economy that included both public and private property, limited economic competition and increased economic cooperation.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=99}}\n\nWhile appreciating principles of liberalism as an ideology that emphasised liberation, Rosselli was deeply disappointed with liberalism as a system that he described as having been used by the [[bourgeoisie]] to support their privileges while neglecting the liberation components of liberalism as an ideology and thus viewed conventional liberalism as a system that had merely become an ideology of \"bourgeois capitalism\".{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=51}} At the same time, Rosselli appreciated socialism as an ideology, but he was also deeply disappointed with conventional socialism as a system.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=53}} In response to his disappointment with conventional socialism in practice, Roselli declared: \"The recent experiences, all the experiences of the past thirty years, have hopelessly condemned the primitive programs of the socialists. State socialism especially\u2014collectivist, centralising socialism\u2014has been defeated\".{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=53}} Rosselli's liberal socialism was partly based upon his study and admiration of British political themes of the Fabian Society and John Stuart Mill (he was able to read the English versions of Mill's work ''[[On Liberty]]'' prior to its availability in Italian that began in 1925). His admiration of British socialism increased after his visit to the United Kingdom in 1923 where he met [[George Drumgoole Coleman]], R. H. Tawney and other members of the Fabian Society.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|pp=59\u201360}}\n\nAn important component of Italian liberal socialism developed by Rosselli was its [[anti-fascism]].{{sfn|Dombroski|2001|p=122}} Rosselli opposed [[fascism]] and believed that fascism would only be defeated by a revival of socialism.{{sfn|Dombroski|2001|p=122}} Rosselli founded [[Giustizia e Libert\u00e0]] as a [[resistance movement]] founded in the 1930s in opposition to the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist regime in Italy]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|1981|p=224}} [[Ferruccio Parri]]\u2014who later became [[Prime Minister of Italy]]\u2014and [[Sandro Pertini]]\u2014who later became [[President of Italy]]\u2014were among Giustizia e Libert\u00e0's leaders.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=51}} Giustizia e Libert\u00e0 was committed to militant action to fight the Fascist regime and it saw [[Benito Mussolini]] as a ruthless murderer who himself deserved to be killed as punishment.{{sfn|Di Scala|1996|p=87}} Various early schemes were designed by the movement in the 1930s to assassinate Mussolini, including one dramatic plan of using an aircraft to drop a bomb on [[Piazza Venezia]] where Mussolini resided.{{sfn|Dombroski|2001|p=122}} Rosselli was also a prominent member of the liberal-socialist [[Action Party (Italy)|Action Party]].{{sfn|Bastow|Martin|2003|p=74}}\n\n[[File:Pertini ritratto.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sandro Pertini]], [[President of Italy]] (1978\u20131985)]]\nAfter Rosselli's death, liberal socialism was developed in Italian political thought by {{ill|Guido Calogero|it}}.{{sfn|Bresser-Pereira|2004|p=84}} Unlike Rosselli, Calogero considered the ideology as a unique ideology called liberalsocialism ({{lang-it|liberalsocialismo}}) that was separate from existing liberal and socialist ideologies.{{sfn|Bresser-Pereira|2004|p=84}} Calogero created the \"First Manifesto of Liberalsocialism\" in 1940{{sfn|Bastow|Martin|2003|p=84}} that stated the following: {{quote|At the basis of liberalsocialism stands the concept of the substantial unity and identity of ideal reason, which supports and justifies socialism in its demand for justice as much as it does liberalism in its demand for liberty. This ideal reason coincides with that same ethical principle to whose rule humanity and civilization, both past and future, must always measure up. This is the principle by which we recognize the personhood of others in contrast to our own person and assign to each of them a right to own their own.{{sfn|Bastow|Martin|2003|p=84}}}}\n\nAfter World War II, [[Ferruccio Parri]] of the liberal socialist [[Action Party (Italy)|Action Party]] briefly served as Prime Minister of Italy in 1945.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|pp=59\u201360, 236}} In 1978, liberal socialist Sandro Pertini of the [[Italian Socialist Party]] was elected President of Italy in 1978 and served as President until 1985.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=236}}\n\n=== Belgium ===\n[[Chantal Mouffe]] is a prominent Belgian advocate of liberal socialism.{{sfn|Coper\u00edas-Aguilar|2000|p=39}} She describes liberal socialism as the following: {{quote|To deepen and enrich the pluralist conquests of liberal democracy, the articulation between political liberalism and individualism must be broken, to make possible a new approach to individuality that restores its social nature without reducing it to a simple component of an organic whole. This is where the socialist tradition of thought might still have something to contribute to the democratic project and herein lies the promise of a liberal socialism.{{sfn|Coper\u00edas-Aguilar|2000|p=39}}}}\n\n=== Hungary ===\nIn 1919, the Hungarian politician [[Oszk\u00e1r J\u00e1szi]] declared his support for what he termed \"liberal socialism\" while denouncing \"communist socialism\".{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=125}} Opposed to classical social democracy's prevalent focus on support from the working class, J\u00e1szi saw the middle class and smallholder peasants as essential to the development of socialism and spoke of the need of a \"radical middle-class\".{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=125}} His views were especially influenced by events in Hungary in 1919 involving the [[Bolshevik]] revolution during which he specifically denounced the Marxist worldview shortly after the collapse of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]], calling his views \"Anti-Marx\". His criticism of [[orthodox Marxism]] was centered on its mechanical and value-free and amoral methodology.{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=199}} He argued that \"[i]n no small measure, the present terrible, bewildering world crisis is a consequence of Marxism's mechanical Communism and amoral nihilism. New formulas of spirit, freedom and solidarity have to be found\".{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=199}}\n\nJ\u00e1szi promoted a form of co-operative socialism that included liberal principles of freedom, voluntarism and decentralization.{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=125}} He counterpoised this ideal version of socialism with the then-existing political system in the Soviet Union, which he identified as based upon dictatorial and militarist perils, [[statism]] and a crippled economic order where competition and quality are disregarded.{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=200}}\n\nJ\u00e1szi's views on socialism and especially his works justifying the denouncement of [[Bolshevik communism]] came back into Hungarian public interest in the 1980s when copies of his manuscripts were discovered and were smuggled into Hungary that was then under [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party|communist party]]-rule.{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=200}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Socialism}}\n{{cols|colwidth=16em}}\n* [[Christian socialism]]\n* [[Democratic socialism]]\n* [[Economic liberalism]]\n* [[Libertarian socialism]]\n* [[Ethical socialism]]\n* [[History of socialism]]\n* [[Liberalism]]\n* [[Liberal Socialist Party (Switzerland)]]\n* [[Market socialism]]\n* [[Mixed economy]]\n* [[Reformism]]\n* [[Social anarchism]]\n* [[Social corporatism]]\n* [[Social democracy]]\n* [[Social liberalism]]\n* [[Social market economy]]\n* [[Socialism]]\n* [[Third Way]]\n* [[Types of socialism]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{refbegin|40em|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book|last=Adams|first=Ian|year=1999|title=Ideology and Politics in Britain Today|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719050565|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Anton|first1=Anatole|last2=Schmitt|first2=Richard|year=2012|title=Taking Socialism Seriously|publisher=Lxeington Books|isbn=9780739166352|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Roland Willey|year=1970|title=The Success of Modern Private Enterprise|publisher=Interstate Printers & Publishers|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Bastow|first1=Steve|last2=Martin|first2=James|year=2003|title=Third Way Discourse: European Ideologies in the Twentieth Century|location=Edinburgh, Scotland|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Baum|first=Bruce|chapter=J.

However, he accepted interventions in the economy such as a tax on alcohol, if there were sufficient [[utilitarian]] grounds. He also accepted the principle of legislative intervention for the purpose of animal welfare.{{sfnm|1a1=Linzey|1y=2002|2a1=Morris|2y=2002}} Mill originally believed that equality of taxation meant [[equality of sacrifice]] and that [[progressive tax]]ation penalised those who worked harder and saved more and was therefore a \"mild form of robbery\".{{sfn|Pellerin|2009}}\n\nGiven an equal tax rate regardless of income, Mill agreed that [[inheritance]] should be taxed. A utilitarian society would agree that everyone should be equal one way or another. Therefore, receiving inheritance would put one ahead of society unless taxed on the inheritance. Those who donate should consider and choose carefully where their money goes\u2014some charities are more deserving than others. Considering public charities boards such as a government will disburse the money equally. However, a private charity board like a church would disburse the monies fairly to those who are in more need than others.{{sfn|Strasser|1991}}\n\nMill later altered his views toward a more socialist bent, adding chapters to his ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' in defence of a socialist outlook and defending some socialist causes.{{sfn|Bentham|Mill|2004|p=11}} Within this revised work, he also made the radical proposal that the whole wage system be abolished in favour of a co-operative wage system.{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2007|1loc=\"Political Economy\"|2a1=Hill|2y=2020|2p=52}} Nonetheless, some of his views on the idea of flat taxation remained,{{sfn|Wilson|2007|loc=\"Political Economy\"}} albeit altered in the third edition of the ''Principles of Political Economy'' to reflect a concern for differentiating restrictions on unearned incomes which he favoured; and those on earned incomes which he did not favour.{{sfn|Mill|1852|loc=\"On The General Principles of Taxation, V.2.14\"|ps=. The passage about flat taxation was altered by the author in this edition which is acknowledged in this edition's footnote 8: \"This sentence replaced in the 3rd ed. a sentence of the original: \"It is partial taxation, which is a mild form of robbery.\"}}\n\nIn the case of [[Oxford University]], Mill's ''Principles of Political Economy'', first published in 1848, was the standard text until 1919 when it was replaced by [[Alfred Marshall]]'s ''[[Principles of Economics (Marshall)|Principles of Economics]]''. As [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations|Wealth of Nations]]'' had during an earlier period, Mill's ''Principles of Economy'' dominated economics teaching and was one of the most widely read of all books on economics in the period.{{sfn|Ekelund Jr.|H\u00e9bert|1997|p=172}}\n\nIn later editions of ''Principles of Political Economy'', Mill would argue that \"as far as economic theory was concerned, there is nothing in principle in economic theory that precludes an economic order based on socialist policies\".{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2007|1loc=\"Political Economy\"|2a1=Baum|2y=2007|ps=: \"Mill, in contrast, advances a form of liberal democratic socialism for the enlargement of freedom as well as to realize social and distributive justice.

H. Tawney.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[R. H.

Ethical socialists advocated a mixed economy that involves an acceptance of a role of both [[public enterprise]] as well as [[Social responsibility|socially responsible]] [[private enterprise]].{{sfn|Thompson|2006|pp=60\u201361}} Ethical socialism was founded by [[Christian socialism|Christian socialist]] [[R.

Tawney denounced the self-seeking amoral and immoral behaviour that he claimed is supported by capitalism.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=52}} He opposed what he called the \"acquisitive society\" that causes private property to be used to transfer surplus profit to \"functionless owners\"\u2014[[rentier capitalism|capitalist rentiers]].{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=58}} However, Tawney did not denounce managers as a whole, believing that management and employees could join together in a political alliance for reform.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=58}} He supported the pooling of surplus profit through means of [[progressive taxation]] to redistribute these funds to provide [[social welfare]], including [[public health care]], [[public education]] and [[public housing]].{{sfn|Thompson|2006|pp=58\u201359}}\n\nTawney advocated nationalisation of strategic industries and services.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=59}} He also advocated worker participation in the business of management in the economy as well as consumer, employee, employer and state cooperation in the economy.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=59}} Though he supported a substantial role for public enterprise in the economy, Tawney stated that where private enterprise provided a service that was commensurate with its rewards that was functioning private property, then a business could be usefully and legitimately be left in private hands.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|pp=60\u201361}} Ethical socialist [[Thomas Hill Green]] supported the right of [[equal opportunity]] for all individuals to be able freely appropriate property, but he claimed that acquisition of wealth did not imply that an individual could do whatever they wanted to once that wealth was in their possession. Green opposed \"[[property rights]] of the few\" that were preventing the ownership of property by the many.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=35}}\n\nEthical socialism is an important ideology of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]]. Labour [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Clement Attlee]] supported the ideology, which played a large role in his party's policies during the postwar 1940s.{{sfn|Howell|2006|pp=130\u2013132}} Half a century after Attlee's tenure, [[Tony Blair]], another Labour Prime Minister, also described himself as an adherent of ethical socialism, which for him embodies the values of \"social justice, the equal worth of each citizen, equality of opportunity, community\".{{sfn|Jackson|Tansey|2008|p=97}} Influenced by Attlee and [[John Macmurray]] (who himself was influenced by Green),{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=189\u2013190}} Blair has defined the ideology in similar terms as earlier adherents\u2014with an  emphasis on the [[common good]], rights and responsibilities as well as support of an organic society in which individuals flourish through cooperation.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=189\u2013190}} Blair argued that Labour ran into problems in the 1960s and 1970s when it abandoned ethical socialism and that its recovery required a return to the values promoted by the Attlee government.{{sfn|Bastow|Martin|2003|p=72}} However, Blair's critics (both inside and outside Labour) have accused him of completely abandoning socialism in favour of capitalism.{{sfn|Eliott|Faucher-King|Le Gal\u00e8s|2010|p=18}}\n\n=== Germany ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F057884-0009, Willy Brandt.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Willy Brandt]], [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Chancellor of West Germany]] (1969\u20131974)]]\nAn early version of liberal socialism was developed in Germany by [[Franz Oppenheimer]].{{sfn|Rep|2000|p=238}} Although he was committed to socialism, Oppenheimer's theories inspired the development of the [[social liberalism]] that was pursued by [[Chancellor of Germany|German Chancellor]] [[Ludwig Erhard]], who said the following: \"As long as I live, I will not forget Franz Oppenheimer!

After it was banned by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]] in 1933, the SPD acted in exile through the [[Sopade]]. In 1934, the Sopade began to publish material that indicated that the SPD was turning towards liberal socialism.{{sfn|Edinger|1956|p=215}} {{ill|Curt Heyer|de}}, a prominent proponent of liberal socialism within the Sopade, declared that Sopade represented the tradition of [[Weimar Republic]] [[social democracy]] (a form of liberal [[democratic socialism]]) and declared that Sopade's held true to its mandate of traditional liberal principles combined with the political realism of socialism.{{sfn|Edinger|1956|pp=219\u2013220}} After the restoration of democracy in West Germany, the SPD's [[Godesberg Program]] in 1959 eliminated the party's remaining Marxist policies.

State socialism especially\u2014collectivist, centralising socialism\u2014has been defeated\".{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=53}} Rosselli's liberal socialism was partly based upon his study and admiration of British political themes of the Fabian Society and John Stuart Mill (he was able to read the English versions of Mill's work ''[[On Liberty]]'' prior to its availability in Italian that began in 1925). His admiration of British socialism increased after his visit to the United Kingdom in 1923 where he met [[George Drumgoole Coleman]], R. H. Tawney and other members of the Fabian Society.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|pp=59\u201360}}\n\nAn important component of Italian liberal socialism developed by Rosselli was its [[anti-fascism]].{{sfn|Dombroski|2001|p=122}} Rosselli opposed [[fascism]] and believed that fascism would only be defeated by a revival of socialism.{{sfn|Dombroski|2001|p=122}} Rosselli founded [[Giustizia e Libert\u00e0]] as a [[resistance movement]] founded in the 1930s in opposition to the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist regime in Italy]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|1981|p=224}} [[Ferruccio Parri]]\u2014who later became [[Prime Minister of Italy]]\u2014and [[Sandro Pertini]]\u2014who later became [[President of Italy]]\u2014were among Giustizia e Libert\u00e0's leaders.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=51}} Giustizia e Libert\u00e0 was committed to militant action to fight the Fascist regime and it saw [[Benito Mussolini]] as a ruthless murderer who himself deserved to be killed as punishment.{{sfn|Di Scala|1996|p=87}} Various early schemes were designed by the movement in the 1930s to assassinate Mussolini, including one dramatic plan of using an aircraft to drop a bomb on [[Piazza Venezia]] where Mussolini resided.{{sfn|Dombroski|2001|p=122}} Rosselli was also a prominent member of the liberal-socialist [[Action Party (Italy)|Action Party]].{{sfn|Bastow|Martin|2003|p=74}}\n\n[[File:Pertini ritratto.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sandro Pertini]], [[President of Italy]] (1978\u20131985)]]\nAfter Rosselli's death, liberal socialism was developed in Italian political thought by {{ill|Guido Calogero|it}}.{{sfn|Bresser-Pereira|2004|p=84}} Unlike Rosselli, Calogero considered the ideology as a unique ideology called liberalsocialism ({{lang-it|liberalsocialismo}}) that was separate from existing liberal and socialist ideologies.{{sfn|Bresser-Pereira|2004|p=84}} Calogero created the \"First Manifesto of Liberalsocialism\" in 1940{{sfn|Bastow|Martin|2003|p=84}} that stated the following: {{quote|At the basis of liberalsocialism stands the concept of the substantial unity and identity of ideal reason, which supports and justifies socialism in its demand for justice as much as it does liberalism in its demand for liberty.

New formulas of spirit, freedom and solidarity have to be found\".{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=199}}\n\nJ\u00e1szi promoted a form of co-operative socialism that included liberal principles of freedom, voluntarism and decentralization.{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=125}} He counterpoised this ideal version of socialism with the then-existing political system in the Soviet Union, which he identified as based upon dictatorial and militarist perils, [[statism]] and a crippled economic order where competition and quality are disregarded.{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=200}}\n\nJ\u00e1szi's views on socialism and especially his works justifying the denouncement of [[Bolshevik communism]] came back into Hungarian public interest in the 1980s when copies of his manuscripts were discovered and were smuggled into Hungary that was then under [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party|communist party]]-rule.{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=200}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Socialism}}\n{{cols|colwidth=16em}}\n* [[Christian socialism]]\n* [[Democratic socialism]]\n* [[Economic liberalism]]\n* [[Libertarian socialism]]\n* [[Ethical socialism]]\n* [[History of socialism]]\n* [[Liberalism]]\n* [[Liberal Socialist Party (Switzerland)]]\n* [[Market socialism]]\n* [[Mixed economy]]\n* [[Reformism]]\n* [[Social anarchism]]\n* [[Social corporatism]]\n* [[Social democracy]]\n* [[Social liberalism]]\n* [[Social market economy]]\n* [[Socialism]]\n* [[Third Way]]\n* [[Types of socialism]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{refbegin|40em|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book|last=Adams|first=Ian|year=1999|title=Ideology and Politics in Britain Today|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719050565|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Anton|first1=Anatole|last2=Schmitt|first2=Richard|year=2012|title=Taking Socialism Seriously|publisher=Lxeington Books|isbn=9780739166352|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Roland Willey|year=1970|title=The Success of Modern Private Enterprise|publisher=Interstate Printers & Publishers|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Bastow|first1=Steve|last2=Martin|first2=James|year=2003|title=Third Way Discourse: European Ideologies in the Twentieth Century|location=Edinburgh, Scotland|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Baum|first=Bruce|chapter=J.
