Currently, Gate 12, Pier B has been upgraded to accommodate the A380, the only gate at the airport that can handle this aircraft so far. An early phase of this has seen the removal of the South Bay remote aircraft stands, constructed in 1962 between taxiways Juliet and Kilo and as a result more recently re-aligning taxiway Juliet into an extended taxiway Bravo.\n\nTerminal 1 will not be included in the 10 Year Airport expansion project and will be closed and demolished by around 2022. However Pier B in Terminal 1 is due to be kept and will be entirely rebuilt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aerotelegraph.com/manchester-will-besser-als-heathrow-werden-ausbau-1-milliarde-pfund|title=Massiver Ausbau: Manchester will besser als Heathrow werden|date=9 June 2015|work=aerotelegraph.com}}</ref>\n\n===Terminal 2===\nTerminal 2 is used by a variety of airlines, operating both charter and scheduled flights to many European and worldwide destinations.\n\nTerminal 2 is spread over an area of {{convert|52000|m2|abbr=on}}.Terminal 2 has 16 gates, of which 9 have air bridges. The design of the terminal makes it capable of extensive expansion; building work has begun for an extension providing additional gates, together with the construction of a satellite pier. Terminal 2's current capacity is around 8&nbsp;million passengers a year, this will be extended to ultimately handle 25&nbsp;million passengers a year.<ref name=\"autogenerated7\" /> In 2007, an \u00a311&nbsp;million project commenced to redevelop Terminal 2 by improving security facilities and enhancing retail and catering services.\n\nTerminal 2 is due to receive a major extension, to encompass current remote stands to the west. Between twelve and fifteen covered aircraft stands will be made available by this. An air side link for transferring passengers between Terminals 1 and 2 is at the planning stage, designed in an effort to boost Manchester's chances of becoming a major hub airport and minimise missed connections. It was announced in June 2015 that the airport would have an expansion taking 10 years to complete. Terminal 2 will be the most developed, adding new piers to the terminal and also create a larger security hall as well as more outlets. There will also be a connecting hallway to Terminal 3.<ref name=\"BBC News\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-32963790|title=Manchester Airport: \u00a31bn plan to 'transform' site launched|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first phase of the new extension, Pier 1, opened on 1 April 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/manairport/status/981159505093312512|title=Manchester Airport on Twitter|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=21 September 2018}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.anna.aero/2019/02/20/one-to-one-with-robert-smith-head-of-aviation-development-manchester-airport/|title=One-to-one with Robert Smith, Head of Aviation Development, Manchester Airport|date=20 February 2019|website=anna.aero}}</ref> The second phase, the terminal extension, will open in April 2020.

The M56 is the main route used by traffic to reach the airport. There are also minor local roads serving the airport from the north ([[Wythenshawe]]) and the east ([[Heald Green]]). The M56/[[A538 road|A538]] road junction serves the World Freight Terminal, to the west of the airport. The A538 runs east\u2013west serving the local towns of [[Altrincham]] and [[Wilmslow]].\n{{Update|1=Progress on SEMMMS|2=April 2016|date=April 2016}}\nProposed as part of the SEMMMS (South East Manchester Multi-Modal Strategy) Relief Road Scheme, [[A555 road|a new link road]] to the [[A6 road (England)|A6]] south of Stockport opened in 2018.

In July 2007 the airport introduced a 'No Waiting' restriction on all access roads surrounding the terminals.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} As of June 2018, the public are required to pay charges of \u00a33 for five minutes on the terminal forecourt or \u00a34 for the maximum ten minutes in order to drop off passengers. The charges have been highly controversial; local taxi drivers have described them as a \"[[cash cow]]\" for the airport,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Butler |first1=Katie |title=Taxi drivers say new airport drop-off charges are a 'cash cow' |url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/manchester-airport-drop-off-charges-14439832 |accessdate=21 September 2018 |work=Manchester Evening News |date=21 March 2018}}</ref> and were described by a judge for Minshull Street crown court as \"extraordinary\" and \"an absolute disgrace\" after he gave a psychology teacher a suspended sentence for deliberately driving into a parking official in an act of [[road rage]] over the charges.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gibbons |first1=Katie |title=Judge sympathises with teacher who 'lost rag' over Manchester airport charges |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/judge-sympathises-with-teacher-who-lost-rag-over-airport-charges-grllbs30d |accessdate=21 September 2018 |work=The Times |url-access=subscription  |date=21 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009/2010 Terminal 1's multi-storey car park was refurbished. Each level of the car park is colour-coded. The floor, walls, ceiling and supports have all received a repaint with every parking space having a sensor and green light above it, with empty parking bays indicated by the green light.\n\nOfficial long-stay on-airport [[parking]] from Manchester Airport is located near the terminals and served by a regular courtesy bus. There is one long-stay car park serving Terminals 1 and 3 and a separate dedicated long-stay car park for Terminal 2. In 2009 the airport opened ''JetParks'' \u2013 two long-stay car parks less than a mile from the terminals. This is a cheaper alternative to the on-site car parks and is served by a 24-hour shuttle bus every 15 minutes. The airport also operates a ''Shuttle Park'' for long-stay car parking, which is also served by a regular courtesy bus and is located just off the airport site to the east of Terminal 3.\nThe airport has since augmented these products with a 3rd ''JetParks'' car park, ''JetParks 3''. This is located adjacent to Shuttle Parks and as a result, Shuttle Parks was renamed ''JetParks Plus''.\nManchester Airport also operates a very large scale [[valet parking]] product across all 3 terminals that it has branded as \"Meet & Greet\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchesterairport.co.uk/|title=Official website for Manchester Airport, live flight information, car parking & booking flights - Manchester Airport|accessdate=2 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014 a new, 9000 space car park located underneath the approach to 23R was constructed, the first area of the site opened in the autumn. The remainder of the facility will open in time for summer 2015.\n\nThere are several privately operated car parks within a short distance of the airport, served by shuttle bus, as well as several off-site companies operating valet parking services.\n\n===Drop off zones===\nUp until 2018 cars dropping off passengers could do so outside terminals for free.  On 10 July 2018 Manchester Airport took the step of introducing a fee of \u00a33 to \u00a34 for vehicles dropping off passengers at terminals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.manchesterairport.co.uk/parking/pick-up-and-drop-off/|title=Pick Up & Drop Off Information & Charges - Manchester Airport|website=Manchester Airport|accessdate=21 September 2018}}</ref> Alternatively, passengers being dropped off can be taken to an off-site car park from where a shuttle bus operates to the terminals. The airport issues fines of up to \u00a3100 to vehicles which breach its terms and conditions for the drop off zones.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.manchesterairport.co.uk/terms-and-conditions/free-drop-off-terms-and-conditions/|title=Free Drop-Off Terms and Conditions - Manchester Airport|website=Manchester Airport|accessdate=21 September 2018}}</ref> The changes have been seen as unwelcome and nonconstructive by passengers and taxi drivers, with some saying they will boycott the airport.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/manchester-airport-drop-off-fees-14903008|title=Drivers claim Manchester Airport drop-off charging is causing MORE gridlock|first=Charlotte|last=Cox|date=13 July 2018|website=manchestereveningnews.co.uk|accessdate=21 September 2018}}</ref> The change has also attracted criticism from local Councillors in Cheshire, who point out that many places directly under Manchester Airport's flight paths don't have a direct [[public transport]] link to the airport.

The original plan was that the first column, commanded by Wenceslao Robles, would seize Corrientes while a second column of 12,000 men, commanded by Antonio de la Cruz Estigarribia, would then advance to the east of Corrientes and capture Brazilian possessions on the Uruguay River. The primary focus of this invasion plan was the capture of Brazilian possessions, as this would prevent Brazilian expansion, a great concern of President Lopez. The other column would then capture Corrientes, distracting Argentine forces and creating a lifeline between Paraguay and the Atlantic Ocean. This plan was later revised so that two-thirds of the assault force would attack Corrientes and later divert southeast and invade Uruguay.\n\nIn response, a military [[Treaty of the Triple Alliance|alliance]] was signed on 1 May among Argentina, Uruguay and the Empire of Brazil.\n\nFollowing the successful capture of Corrientes, Argentine Gen. [[Wenceslao Paunero]] launched a daring attack&nbsp;\u2013 on 25 May&nbsp;\u2013 that recaptured the city. However, given the enormous numerical superiority of the enemy, he chose to evacuate the city and its civilians two days later and head to the southwest of the province. Only after having evacuated Corrientes did Paunero learn that the Paraguayans were making progress on the Uruguay River.<ref name=Hooker/>{{rp|31}}\n\nArgentine President [[Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre]] put Gen. [[Justo Jos\u00e9 de Urquiza|Urquiza]], governor of the [[province of Entre R\u00edos]], in charge of facing the Paraguayan column. Urquiza called on his aid Paunero, who had retreated to [[Esquina (Corrientes)|Esquina]]. These forces were joined by a battalion of volunteers from Corrientes, led by Col. [[Desiderio Sosa]], who had participated in the reconquest of Corrientes. Many future heroes of the [[History of Corrientes Province]] such as [[Santiago Baibiene]] and [[Pl\u00e1cido Mart\u00ednez]], were in that battalion.<ref>Castello, Antonio Emilio, ''Historia de Corrientes'', Ed. Plus Ultra, Bs. As., 1991. {{ISBN|978-950-21-0619-9}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the naval [[Battle of Riachuelo]] took place. During the course of the battle the Imperial Brazilian fleet destroyed the Paraguayan squadron near the city of Corrientes.<ref>Tissera, Ram\u00f3n,''Riachuelo, la batalla que detuvo la marcha de L\u00f3pez al Oc\u00e9ano'', Revista Todo es Historia, No. 46, Buenos Aires, 1971. {{in lang|es}}</ref> This loss prevented the Paraguayan column [[Paran\u00e1 River]] from providing support to the forces on the Uruguay River.\n\n== Armies ==\n\nOn 5 May, after invading the northwestern province of Corrientes, Gen. Estigarribia sent Col. [[Pedro Duarte]] in front of a small advance column to control the bank of the Uruguay River. Duarte took the city of [[Santo Tom\u00e9 (Corrientes)|Santo Tome]] Estigarribia's forces followed up and met him there four days latter. The army then crossed the Uruguay River and entered the province of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], Empire of Brazil. They left behind them the column of Duarte, with more than 3,000 soldiers to defend Uruguay.\n\n[[File:GUERRE DE L'AM\u00c9RIQUE DU SUD. - COMBAT DE SAM-BORJA (10 juin 1865); le 1\u00ba bataillon de volontaires br\u00e9siliens def\u00e9ndants son drapeau contre les Paraguayens. - D'apr\u00e8s un croquis de M.

In the meantime, Estigarribias's column was attacked and partially destroyed on the outskirts of S\u00e3o Borja, in combating Mbuty.<ref>Zenequelli, Lilia, ''Cr\u00f3nica de una guerra, La Triple Alianza''.

As., 1997. {{ISBN|978-987-9123-36-2}}</ref> Some of the Paraguayan forces were stationed in Sao Tome and S\u00e3o Borja while Duarte was heading south.\n\nUrquiza ordered Paunero to join him in [[Concordia (Entre Rios)|Concordia]], but the leader delayed the completion of Urquiza's orders. On June 4 the troops of Urquiza, who refused to fight the Paraguayans on the grounds of being considered allies against Brazil (which Argentina had frayed relations with), were disbanded.\n\nUruguayan President Gen. [[Venancio Flores]], fresh from his triumph over the [[National Party (Uruguay)|white party]] or \"blancos\", marched to join Urquiza with 2,750 men. In addition, the Brazilian forces, commanded by Lt. Col. [[Joaquim Rodrigues Coelho Nelly]], totaling 1,200 men, were heading their way. They met on July 13. At the first meeting Flores was given the Line Cavalry Regiment \"San Mart\u00edn\", with 450 men, plus the artillery squadron East with 140 men. In total, Flores had 4,540 troops\u2014not nearly enough to confront the Paraguayan columns.\n\nFlores, Duarte and Estigarribia marched slowly to meet and engage in battle, while Paunero's 3,600 men began a march through swamps and rivers, swiftly crossing the southern province of Entre Rios to join Flores. In addition, 1,400 of Correntina cavalry under Gen. [[Juan Madariaga]] joined their forces. Finally, Col. [[Simeon Paiva]], with 1,200 men, followed closely by the column of Duarte.\n\nEstigarribia had a chance to destroy all his enemies one by one, but missed. He also disobeyed orders from Lopez, who ordered him to continue on his way to [[Alegrete]]:<ref>Rosa, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda, ''La guerra del Paraguay y las montoneras argentinas'', Ed. Hyspam\u00e9rica, 1986. {{ISBN|978-950-614-362-6}}</ref> On August 5 he went to [[Uruguayana]] and ordered his troops to reorganize and gather supplies. The Brazilian forces of Gen. [[David Canabarro]], too few to attack the column of 5,000 men of Estigarribia, were limited to camp near the city without being attacked by the Paraguayans.\n\nOn August 2 Duarte occupied the village of San Jos\u00e9 de Restoration, now the town of [[Paso de los Libres]]. A week later he advanced and was defeated, suffering 20 casualties in the Battle of Chap Kish. Given the news that all enemy forces were in pursuit, Duarte sought help from his superior, Gen. Estigarribia, who sent him this answer:\n\n{{quote\n| \"Tell the great Duarte that if he intends to take over command of the Uruguayan force that I would fight the battle myself.\"<ref>[[Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Garmendia]], ''Campa\u00f1a de Corrientes y R\u00edo Grande'', Ed.

As., 1965, p\u00e1g. 74.</ref>\n\nOn August 13 Paunero avoided the army of Duarte and joined Flores, whose forces then numbered 12,000 men, nearly four times the force of Duarte. Duarte moved away from Paso de los Libres and took positions on the banks of the [[stream Yatay]], near the village.\n\nThere was a brief encounter on the afternoon of August 16, and at dusk the two armies were facing each other from a half-mile off.\n\n== Battle ==\n\n[[File:Batalha do Yatay a 17 de agosto de 1865 dada na planura do Yatay.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of the Battle of Yatay.]]\n\nBoth the Yatay and Uruguay rivers had recently flooded, leaving much of the battlefield underwater. Most Paraguayan infantry forces were entrenched among trees and ditches in the area of the nearby village estates and protected by mud that covered the frontal approach, but the stream behind them made it impossible to retreat in case of a defeat, which was considered very likely by Duarte.<ref>Zenequelli, Lilia, op. cit.</ref>\n\nDuarte's forces consisted of 1,980 infantry and 1,020 cavalry,<ref>Zenequelli, op. cit., afirma que contaba en total con 3.200 hombres.</ref> with no artillery. The Allies had a total of 5,550 infantry, 5,000 cavalry and 32 pieces of artillery. Among the leaders of the allied army were experienced commanders Flores and Paunero, [[Lion Palleja]], [[Ignacio Rivas]], [[Enrique Castro]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Gregorio Su\u00e1rez]] and Argentines [[Juan Bautista Charlone]], [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Arredondo]], [[Jos\u00e9 Giribone]] [[Ignacio Segovia]], [[Joaquin Viejobueno]], [[Leopoldo Nelson]], Simeon Paiva and Madariaga.\n\n[[File:Derrota dos paraguayos em Yatahy.jpg|thumb|left|Defeat of Paraguayans at Yatay.]]\n\nThe battle began at 10:00&nbsp;am, with an early attack on the Paraguayan positions by the Palleja Infantry Division. Duarte seized the opportunity and countered with almost all his cavalry, causing hundreds of casualties and forcing them to retreat. Faced with an increasingly bad situation, the cavalry division of Segovia attacked the Paraguayan cavalry, supported by Castro's eastern and Suarez. For two hours the battle was fought exclusively with cavalry.\n\nDuarte ordered a withdrawal maneuver, which finally enabled the allied infantry to go into action, and although their (the allies) numerical superiority was overwhelming, the Paraguayans fought with tenacity. When the battle was almost lost, Duarte tried a desperate cavalry charge, and in the fight his horse was killed. Paunero himself demanded that Duarte surrender, which he finally agreed to do.\n\nA final Paraguayan force of infantry under Lt. Zorrilla crossed the Yatay stream and was attacked by a cavalry unit of Suarez and Madariaga, who attacked from the rear. A few hundred Paraguayan soldiers swam the Uruguay River, while the rest were killed or taken prisoner. In total they suffered 1.500 dead<ref>Rosa, en ''La Guerra del Paraguay...'', basado en fuentes brasile\u00f1as, asegura que tuvieron 1.700 muertos; tal vez sumase los 200 uruguayos y argentinos tomados prisioneros, y de los que buena parte fueron fusilados a posteriori por Flores, pero dif\u00edcilmente lo hayan sido en su totalidad.</ref> and 1,600 prisoners, including 300 wounded.\n\n== Consequences ==\n\n[[File:C\u00e1ndido L\u00f3pez - Soldados paraguayos heridos prisioneros de la batalla de Yatay.jpg|thumb|300px|Paraguayan soldiers, wounded prisoners of the Battle of Yatai.]]\n\nAmong the prisoners, Flores found several dozen soldiers from the Uruguayan Blanco Party, supporters who had taken refuge in Paraguay who tried to wrest power in Uruguay from the hands of Flores' forces. He ordered their execution as traitors.<ref>Also ordered the execution of some soldiers [[Federales (Argentina)|federal]] Argentines, not recognized national authority Mitre, who had won three years ago by a rebellion against the [[Confederation Argentina]]. Gavier Diaz, op. cit., p. 38.</ref>\n\nOn September 18, after having assured the representatives of the Brazilian [[Pedro II of Brazil|Emperor]] that he would not surrender and would rather be buried under the rubble of Uruguay, Gen.

The original plan was that the first column, commanded by Wenceslao Robles, would seize Corrientes while a second column of 12,000 men, commanded by Antonio de la Cruz Estigarribia, would then advance to the east of Corrientes and capture Brazilian possessions on the Uruguay River. The primary focus of this invasion plan was the capture of Brazilian possessions, as this would prevent Brazilian expansion, a great concern of President Lopez. The other column would then capture Corrientes, distracting Argentine forces and creating a lifeline between Paraguay and the Atlantic Ocean. This plan was later revised so that two-thirds of the assault force would attack Corrientes and later divert southeast and invade Uruguay.\n\nIn response, a military [[Treaty of the Triple Alliance|alliance]] was signed on 1 May among Argentina, Uruguay and the Empire of Brazil.\n\nFollowing the successful capture of Corrientes, Argentine Gen. [[Wenceslao Paunero]] launched a daring attack&nbsp;\u2013 on 25 May&nbsp;\u2013 that recaptured the city. However, given the enormous numerical superiority of the enemy, he chose to evacuate the city and its civilians two days later and head to the southwest of the province. Only after having evacuated Corrientes did Paunero learn that the Paraguayans were making progress on the Uruguay River.<ref name=Hooker/>{{rp|31}}\n\nArgentine President [[Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre]] put Gen. [[Justo Jos\u00e9 de Urquiza|Urquiza]], governor of the [[province of Entre R\u00edos]], in charge of facing the Paraguayan column. Urquiza called on his aid Paunero, who had retreated to [[Esquina (Corrientes)|Esquina]]. These forces were joined by a battalion of volunteers from Corrientes, led by Col. [[Desiderio Sosa]], who had participated in the reconquest of Corrientes. Many future heroes of the [[History of Corrientes Province]] such as [[Santiago Baibiene]] and [[Pl\u00e1cido Mart\u00ednez]], were in that battalion.<ref>Castello, Antonio Emilio, ''Historia de Corrientes'', Ed. Plus Ultra, Bs. As., 1991. {{ISBN|978-950-21-0619-9}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the naval [[Battle of Riachuelo]] took place. During the course of the battle the Imperial Brazilian fleet destroyed the Paraguayan squadron near the city of Corrientes.<ref>Tissera, Ram\u00f3n,''Riachuelo, la batalla que detuvo la marcha de L\u00f3pez al Oc\u00e9ano'', Revista Todo es Historia, No. 46, Buenos Aires, 1971. {{in lang|es}}</ref> This loss prevented the Paraguayan column [[Paran\u00e1 River]] from providing support to the forces on the Uruguay River.\n\n== Armies ==\n\nOn 5 May, after invading the northwestern province of Corrientes, Gen. Estigarribia sent Col. [[Pedro Duarte]] in front of a small advance column to control the bank of the Uruguay River. Duarte took the city of [[Santo Tom\u00e9 (Corrientes)|Santo Tome]] Estigarribia's forces followed up and met him there four days latter. The army then crossed the Uruguay River and entered the province of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], Empire of Brazil. They left behind them the column of Duarte, with more than 3,000 soldiers to defend Uruguay.\n\n[[File:GUERRE DE L'AM\u00c9RIQUE DU SUD. - COMBAT DE SAM-BORJA (10 juin 1865); le 1\u00ba bataillon de volontaires br\u00e9siliens def\u00e9ndants son drapeau contre les Paraguayens. - D'apr\u00e8s un croquis de M.

On June 4 the troops of Urquiza, who refused to fight the Paraguayans on the grounds of being considered allies against Brazil (which Argentina had frayed relations with), were disbanded.\n\nUruguayan President Gen. [[Venancio Flores]], fresh from his triumph over the [[National Party (Uruguay)|white party]] or \"blancos\", marched to join Urquiza with 2,750 men. In addition, the Brazilian forces, commanded by Lt. Col. [[Joaquim Rodrigues Coelho Nelly]], totaling 1,200 men, were heading their way. They met on July 13. At the first meeting Flores was given the Line Cavalry Regiment \"San Mart\u00edn\", with 450 men, plus the artillery squadron East with 140 men. In total, Flores had 4,540 troops\u2014not nearly enough to confront the Paraguayan columns.\n\nFlores, Duarte and Estigarribia marched slowly to meet and engage in battle, while Paunero's 3,600 men began a march through swamps and rivers, swiftly crossing the southern province of Entre Rios to join Flores. In addition, 1,400 of Correntina cavalry under Gen. [[Juan Madariaga]] joined their forces. Finally, Col. [[Simeon Paiva]], with 1,200 men, followed closely by the column of Duarte.\n\nEstigarribia had a chance to destroy all his enemies one by one, but missed. He also disobeyed orders from Lopez, who ordered him to continue on his way to [[Alegrete]]:<ref>Rosa, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda, ''La guerra del Paraguay y las montoneras argentinas'', Ed. Hyspam\u00e9rica, 1986. {{ISBN|978-950-614-362-6}}</ref> On August 5 he went to [[Uruguayana]] and ordered his troops to reorganize and gather supplies. The Brazilian forces of Gen. [[David Canabarro]], too few to attack the column of 5,000 men of Estigarribia, were limited to camp near the city without being attacked by the Paraguayans.\n\nOn August 2 Duarte occupied the village of San Jos\u00e9 de Restoration, now the town of [[Paso de los Libres]]. A week later he advanced and was defeated, suffering 20 casualties in the Battle of Chap Kish. Given the news that all enemy forces were in pursuit, Duarte sought help from his superior, Gen. Estigarribia, who sent him this answer:\n\n{{quote\n| \"Tell the great Duarte that if he intends to take over command of the Uruguayan force that I would fight the battle myself.\"<ref>[[Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Garmendia]], ''Campa\u00f1a de Corrientes y R\u00edo Grande'', Ed.

As., 1965, p\u00e1g. 74.</ref>\n\nOn August 13 Paunero avoided the army of Duarte and joined Flores, whose forces then numbered 12,000 men, nearly four times the force of Duarte. Duarte moved away from Paso de los Libres and took positions on the banks of the [[stream Yatay]], near the village.\n\nThere was a brief encounter on the afternoon of August 16, and at dusk the two armies were facing each other from a half-mile off.\n\n== Battle ==\n\n[[File:Batalha do Yatay a 17 de agosto de 1865 dada na planura do Yatay.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of the Battle of Yatay.]]\n\nBoth the Yatay and Uruguay rivers had recently flooded, leaving much of the battlefield underwater. Most Paraguayan infantry forces were entrenched among trees and ditches in the area of the nearby village estates and protected by mud that covered the frontal approach, but the stream behind them made it impossible to retreat in case of a defeat, which was considered very likely by Duarte.<ref>Zenequelli, Lilia, op. cit.</ref>\n\nDuarte's forces consisted of 1,980 infantry and 1,020 cavalry,<ref>Zenequelli, op. cit., afirma que contaba en total con 3.200 hombres.</ref> with no artillery. The Allies had a total of 5,550 infantry, 5,000 cavalry and 32 pieces of artillery. Among the leaders of the allied army were experienced commanders Flores and Paunero, [[Lion Palleja]], [[Ignacio Rivas]], [[Enrique Castro]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Gregorio Su\u00e1rez]] and Argentines [[Juan Bautista Charlone]], [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Arredondo]], [[Jos\u00e9 Giribone]] [[Ignacio Segovia]], [[Joaquin Viejobueno]], [[Leopoldo Nelson]], Simeon Paiva and Madariaga.\n\n[[File:Derrota dos paraguayos em Yatahy.jpg|thumb|left|Defeat of Paraguayans at Yatay.]]\n\nThe battle began at 10:00&nbsp;am, with an early attack on the Paraguayan positions by the Palleja Infantry Division. Duarte seized the opportunity and countered with almost all his cavalry, causing hundreds of casualties and forcing them to retreat. Faced with an increasingly bad situation, the cavalry division of Segovia attacked the Paraguayan cavalry, supported by Castro's eastern and Suarez. For two hours the battle was fought exclusively with cavalry.\n\nDuarte ordered a withdrawal maneuver, which finally enabled the allied infantry to go into action, and although their (the allies) numerical superiority was overwhelming, the Paraguayans fought with tenacity. When the battle was almost lost, Duarte tried a desperate cavalry charge, and in the fight his horse was killed. Paunero himself demanded that Duarte surrender, which he finally agreed to do.\n\nA final Paraguayan force of infantry under Lt. Zorrilla crossed the Yatay stream and was attacked by a cavalry unit of Suarez and Madariaga, who attacked from the rear. A few hundred Paraguayan soldiers swam the Uruguay River, while the rest were killed or taken prisoner. In total they suffered 1.500 dead<ref>Rosa, en ''La Guerra del Paraguay...'', basado en fuentes brasile\u00f1as, asegura que tuvieron 1.700 muertos; tal vez sumase los 200 uruguayos y argentinos tomados prisioneros, y de los que buena parte fueron fusilados a posteriori por Flores, pero dif\u00edcilmente lo hayan sido en su totalidad.</ref> and 1,600 prisoners, including 300 wounded.\n\n== Consequences ==\n\n[[File:C\u00e1ndido L\u00f3pez - Soldados paraguayos heridos prisioneros de la batalla de Yatay.jpg|thumb|300px|Paraguayan soldiers, wounded prisoners of the Battle of Yatai.]]\n\nAmong the prisoners, Flores found several dozen soldiers from the Uruguayan Blanco Party, supporters who had taken refuge in Paraguay who tried to wrest power in Uruguay from the hands of Flores' forces. He ordered their execution as traitors.<ref>Also ordered the execution of some soldiers [[Federales (Argentina)|federal]] Argentines, not recognized national authority Mitre, who had won three years ago by a rebellion against the [[Confederation Argentina]].

Estigarribia surrendered with little resistance.\n\nSoon afterwards, the Paraguayan forces occupying the abandoned city of Corrientes retreated to the north, and soon moved on to Paraguay.

Many of the first anarchists in [[Belarus]] were dissatisfied with the moderate positions and \"neutrality\" of the existing socialist parties like the [[General Jewish Labour Bund|Jewish Labour Bund]], the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP), and the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]]. Anarchists demanded the destruction of the [[State (polity)|state]], which included not only the [[monarchy]], but also the [[parliamentary republic]]. These were both deemed a tool of [[class oppression]]. For these anarchists, [[democracy]] was not a viable alternative, as the word meant \"''kratiya''\", or power, specifically of the bourgeoisie.\n\n[[Expropriation]] and the provocation of [[individual terror]], which created a halo of the \"defenders of the working class\" around said anarchists, were some of their most decisive tactics. Though workers from [[Bia\u0142ystok|Bialystok]] joined the anarchist federation on a massive scale, the anarchists could not move beyond the local economic victories.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://politring.com/articles/25433-yuriy-glushakov-anarhisty-v-belarusi.html|title=\u0410\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044b \u0432 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0438|last=\u0413\u043b\u0443\u0448\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432|first=\u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439|date=2019|work=\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0433|access-date=|url-status=live|language=Russian}}</ref>\n\n=== The October Revolution ===\nIn 1917, the leaders of the anarchist movement in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] and [[Kronstadt rebellion|Kronstadt]] were either born or participated in the anarchist movement in Belarus. They included Joseph Blakhman-Solntsev, Konstantin Akashev, Efim Yarchuk, and others. Anarchists, along with the Bolsheviks and the Left Essers, became the leading force of the October Revolution. Soon, [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s party would even adopt the name \"communist\" from [[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkinites]], later taking the name \"Communist Bolsheviks\" under his guidance to distinguish itself from anarchist-communists and esser-communists.\n\nThe united front of all Soviet parties, acting in the underground, was preserved until early 1919. Around this time, anarchist Communism saw competition from the Communist Party, and the Bolsheviks managed to limit the influence of the anarchist movement. Still, legal and semi-legal anarchist circles continued operating in Belarus until the early 1920s. Eventually, however, the Councils of People's Self-Government, which was the dream of Peter Kropotkin's supporters, was finally turned by the party bureaucracy into its auxiliary bodies. The anarchists added to the exiles and political isolators.<ref>{{Cite book|title=\u0420\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0443\u043c\u0435\u0440\u043b\u0430! \u0414\u0430 \u0437\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u044f!|last=\u0413\u043b\u0443\u0448\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432|first=\u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439|publisher=\u0428SS|year=2015|isbn=|location=\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Anarchism in Republic Belarus ==\nThe revival of anarchism was already underway during the years of [[perestroika]]. In the spring of 1991, Gomel anarchists took part in a citywide strike, helping the workers of the \"Polespechat\" factory to join it. In summer 1992, at the initiative of Oleg Novikov, at a congress in Minsk, activists from Minsk, Gomel and Svetlogorsk joined the Federation of Anarchists of Belarus (FAB).\n\nOn October 6th, 1992, International Unemployment Day, Gomel anarchists held an unsanctioned rally, which ended in clashes with police and arrests. The same year the \"Union of the Unemployed\" was created with the participation of Gomel anarchists and agitation campaigns were organized at the city enterprises. The Anarchy newspaper, the first anarchist edition in Belarus, was published in Gomel in 1993.\n\nIn 1995 in Minsk the anti-party group \"Chyrvony Zhond\", which played a significant role in the development of anarchist movement in Belarus, became active.\n\nSince the beginning of 1998, the Navinki newspaper has been published. At the beginning of 1999, as a result of the happening campaign \"Legalize It\", the newspaper Navinki was officially registered, which had previously been published illegally. At the same time, Chyrvonyi Zhond, which originally issued Navinki, was banned in Belarus.\n\nOne of the longest and at the same time the most successful actions, conducted with the participation of Belarusian anarchists, can be considered the environmental campaign \"Viasiolka\", launched in 1998. The campaign was directed against the plans of the [[Belarusian nuclear power plant|Belarusian NPP]] construction developed by the government. With the participation of the FAB activists an independent environmental initiative Ecasupraciou was created, which took upon itself the organization of the whole campaign, to which were drawn employees of the Academy of Sciences of Belarus, interested scientists, press, as well as activists of the Russian radical environmental movement Rainbow Keepers, who had experience of such events.

Many of the first anarchists in [[Belarus]] were dissatisfied with the moderate positions and \"neutrality\" of the existing socialist parties like the [[General Jewish Labour Bund|Jewish Labour Bund]], the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP), and the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]]. The anarchists demanded the destruction of the [[State (polity)|state]], which included not only the [[monarchy]], but also the [[parliamentary republic]]; these were both deemed a tool of [[class oppression]]. For these anarchists, [[democracy]] was not a viable alternative, as the word meant \"''kratiya''\", or power, specifically of the bourgeoisie.\n\nThe most decisive tactics used by these anarchists were [[expropriation]] and the provocation of [[individual terror]], which created a halo of the \"defenders of the working class\" around them. Though workers from [[Bia\u0142ystok|Bialystok]] joined the anarchist federation on a massive scale, the anarchists could not move beyond the local economic victories.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://politring.com/articles/25433-yuriy-glushakov-anarhisty-v-belarusi.html|title=\u0410\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044b \u0432 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0438|last=\u0413\u043b\u0443\u0448\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432|first=\u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439|date=2019|work=\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0433|access-date=|url-status=live|language=Russian}}</ref>\n\n=== The October Revolution ===\nIn 1917, the leaders of the anarchist movement in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] and [[Kronstadt rebellion|Kronstadt]] were either born or participated in the anarchist movement in Belarus. They included Joseph Blakhman-Solntsev, Konstantin Akashev, Efim Yarchuk, and others. Anarchists, along with the Bolsheviks and the Left Essers, became the leading force of the October Revolution. Soon, Lenin's party would even adopt the name \"communist\" from [[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkinites]]. But in order to distinguish itself from the anarchist-communists and esser-communists, [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] stresses in his name - \"Communist Bolsheviks..\"\n\nThe united front of all Soviet parties, acting in the underground, was preserved until early 1919. But then repressions  had two sides. On the one hand, attracting loyal anarchist Communists to the Communist Party and on the other, the Bolsheviks managed to limit the influence of the anarchist movement. But until the early 1920s, legal and semi-legal anarchist circles were still operating in Belarus. Soon, however, the Councils of People's Self-Government, which was the dream of Peter Kropotkin's supporters, was finally turned by the party bureaucracy into its auxiliary bodies. The anarchists added to the exiles and political isolators.<ref>{{Cite book|title=\u0420\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0443\u043c\u0435\u0440\u043b\u0430! \u0414\u0430 \u0437\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u044f!|last=\u0413\u043b\u0443\u0448\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432|first=\u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439|publisher=\u0428SS|year=2015|isbn=|location=\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Anarchism in Republic Belarus ==\nThe revival of anarchism was already underway during the years of [[perestroika]]. In the spring of 1991, Gomel anarchists took part in a citywide strike, helping the workers of the \"Polespechat\" factory to join it. In summer 1992, at the initiative of Oleg Novikov, at a congress in Minsk, activists from Minsk, Gomel and Svetlogorsk joined the Federation of Anarchists of Belarus (FAB).\n\nOn October 6th, 1992, International Unemployment Day, Gomel anarchists held an unsanctioned rally, which ended in clashes with police and arrests. The same year the \"Union of the Unemployed\" was created with the participation of Gomel anarchists and agitation campaigns were organized at the city enterprises. The Anarchy newspaper, the first anarchist edition in Belarus, was published in Gomel in 1993.\n\nIn 1995 in Minsk the anti-party group \"Chyrvony Zhond\" also started its activity, which played a significant role in the development of anarchist movement in Belarus.\n\nSince the beginning of 1998, the Navinki newspaper has been published. At the beginning of 1999, as a result of the happening campaign \"Legalize It\", the newspaper Navinki was officially registered, which had previously been published illegally. At the same time, Chyrvonyi Zhond, which originally issued Navinki, was banned in Belarus.\n\nOne of the longest and at the same time the most successful actions, conducted with the participation of Belarusian anarchists, can be considered the environmental campaign \"Viasiolka\", launched in 1998. The campaign was directed against the plans of the [[Belarusian nuclear power plant|Belarusian NPP]] construction developed by the government. With the participation of the FAB activists an independent environmental initiative Ecasupraciou was created, which took upon itself the organization of the whole campaign, to which were drawn employees of the Academy of Sciences of Belarus, interested scientists, press, as well as activists of the Russian radical environmental movement Rainbow Keepers, who had experience of such events. The newspaper Viasiolka started to be published. Its pages covered all aspects of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] and radioecology. During 1998-99 with the help of scientists several seminars were organized on the expediency of NPP construction. In summer 1998, the activists of Ekasupravu organized a \"March for Nuclear Free Belarus\" on the planned sites of the NPP construction in [[Mogilev Region|Mahiliou voblast]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anarchy in By - \u0410\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0437\u043c \u0432 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0438|last=\u041a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0447\u0438\u043a|first=\u041f\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044e\u043a|publisher=Samizdat|year=2003|isbn=|location=Minsk|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<!--Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.
