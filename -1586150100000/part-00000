Despite no confirmation by North Korean authorities on the claims, the country has implemented stricter measures to combat the spread of the virus.\n\nOn 29 February, [[Kim Jong-un]] called for stronger measures to be taken to prevent COVID-19 from spreading to North Korea.\n\nOn 18 March 2020, [[Kim Jong-un]] ordered the construction of new hospitals in North Korea while also continuing to deny any cases of COVID-19 in North Korea. North Korean state media also reported that groundbreaking on a new hospital was underway the day prior on Tuesday 17 March. Kim Jong-un reportedly told a newspaper linked to the ruling [[Workers' Party of Korea]] that the construction of new hospitals was being done for general improvement of the nation's healthcare system without mentioning COVID-19.\n\nOn 20 March 2020, North Korean media said that more than 2,590 people had been released from quarantine in [[North Pyongan]] and [[South Pyongan]] provinces. All but three quarantined foreigners had been released.\n\nOn 26 March, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' and [[Reuters]] report that North Korea is secretly asking for foreign aid to combat Covid-19 while denying they have any cases in the country. Daily NK, a news site focusing on North Korea, reported that 180 North Korean soldiers died of the virus in January and February and another 3,700 were sent to quarantine. NK also reported that five people had died of the coronavirus in [[Sinuiju]], while South Korean newspaper \u2018\u2018Chosun Ilbo\u2019\u2019 reports two suspected cases in that city.<ref>[https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-north-korea-secretly-solicits-aid-publicly-denies-infections-report-2020-3?r=MX&IR=T North Korea is secretly asking for coronavirus aid from other countries while publicly denying that it has any cases] by Bill Bostock, Business Insider, 26 Mar 2020</ref>\n\n===Yemen===\nAlthough there is no confirmed case in Yemen, the country is seen to be extremely vulnerable to the outbreak, given the dire humanitarian situation due to the [[Yemeni Civil War (2015\u2013present)|civil war]], exacerbated by the [[Famine in Yemen (2016\u2013present)|famine]], [[2016\u201320 Yemen cholera outbreak|cholera outbreaks]], and military blockade by Saudi Arabia and allies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/03/yemen-women-face-masks-coronavirus-houthi-measures.html|title=WHO warns Yemen of pending 'explosion' of COVID-19 cases|last=Shaker|first=Naseh|date=25 March 2020|website=Al-Monitor|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200325133209/https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/03/yemen-women-face-masks-coronavirus-houthi-measures.html|archive-date=25 March 2020|accessdate=26 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.acaps.org/special-report/covid-19-impact-yemen|title=COVID-19: Impact on Yemen|date=23 March 2020|website=ACAPS|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200325160730/https://www.acaps.org/special-report/covid-19-impact-yemen|archive-date=25 March 2020|accessdate=26 March 2020}}</ref> As a response to the growing threat, the [[Houthis]] declared suspending every flight from Yemen to other countries on 15 March.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-03/15/c_138880664.htm|title=Yemen's Houthis suspend int'l flights over COVID-19 concerns - Xinhua &#124; English.news.cn|website=www.xinhuanet.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200316144557/http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-03/15/c_138880664.htm|archive-date=16 March 2020|accessdate=26 March 2020}}</ref> Yemeni officials also stepped up to battle against the threat from the coronavirus.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.acted.org/en/acted-steps-up-preparation-and-support-to-authorities-to-mitigate-the-spread-of-coronavirus-in-yemen/|title=Preparing for the arrival of Covid-19 in Yemen|date=|publisher=ACTED|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200325133444/https://www.acted.org/en/acted-steps-up-preparation-and-support-to-authorities-to-mitigate-the-spread-of-coronavirus-in-yemen/|archive-date=25 March 2020|accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Agency for International Development|United States Agency for International Development (USAID)]] said on 26 March that it would partially suspend its operations in Houthi rebel-held areas because of restrictions imposed by the rebels.

The width of the Ridge is about 40\u201350 km. The highest point of the range is Mount Aspan (3,652 m).[citation needed]\nThe Ridge is adjacent to the K\u00fcng\u00f6y Ala-Too Range' Ridge in the west and the Narat Ridge in the east.

Keen Ridge forms the southern border of Semirechye. \nThe Ridge is composed of igneous and sedimentary rocks, such as effusions, granite, and limestone. The slopes of the Ridge are steep with gentle peaks below the snow line. The Ridge has a permafrost zone but does not have glaciation or snowfields. It contains steppes and taiga forests, which consist mainly of spruce trees and meadows in high-altitude zones. At the foot of the southern slope of the Ridge, steppe bison remains have been found.[citation needed]\nThe eponymous Ketmen pass is located at an altitude of 3,040 meters above sea level in the eastern part of the mountain range. A caravan trail from the Ili valley to the Kegen-Tekes hollow is laid through the pass, which connects the Northern slope in the Ketmen gorge and southern slope of the Ridge of the Shalkudysu river valley.\nThe Keen ridge has a wide variety of flora. Research has found that the Ketmen ridge is home to 1890 species of vascular plants, which are angiosperms, dicots, and monocots. Eighty-four species from 11 genera of rust fungi were found. The most abundant genera found were 48 species of Puccinia and 12 species of Uromyces.[citation needed]\n\n== Source and links ==\n* https://www.tripadvisor.com.my/Attraction_Review-g2350619-d15873720-Reviews-Ketmen_Ridge-Almaty_Region.html\n* \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d. \u041e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430 / \u0422. \u041f. \u0424\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430 (\u0440\u0435\u0434.). \u2014 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u044f. \u2014 \u041e\u043c\u0441\u043a: \u041e\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0444\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430, 2011. \u2014 {{ISBN|978-5-9523-0332-4}}\n* \u041a\u0435\u0442\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0445\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0435\u0442 // \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d. \u041d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u044d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f. \u2014 \u0410\u043b\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044b: \u049a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u049b \u044d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f\u0441\u044b, 2005. \u2014 \u0422.

Research has found that the Ketmen ridge is home to 1890 species of vascular plants, which are angiosperms, dicots, and monocots. Eighty-four species from 11 genera of rust fungi were found. The most abundant genera found were 48 species of Puccinia and 12 species of Uromyces.[citation needed]\n\n== Source and links ==\n* https://www.tripadvisor.com.my/Attraction_Review-g2350619-d15873720-Reviews-Ketmen_Ridge-Almaty_Region.html\n* \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d. \u041e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430 / \u0422. \u041f. \u0424\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430 (\u0440\u0435\u0434.). \u2014 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u044f. \u2014 \u041e\u043c\u0441\u043a: \u041e\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0444\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430, 2011. \u2014 {{ISBN|978-5-9523-0332-4}}\n* \u041a\u0435\u0442\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0445\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0435\u0442 // \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d. \u041d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u044d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f. \u2014 \u0410\u043b\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044b: \u049a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u049b \u044d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f\u0441\u044b, 2005. \u2014 \u0422.

coupes, and [[convertible]]s, four-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedans]], and four-door [[station wagon]]s were offered throughout the entire run. This also included a coupe utility (El Camino) which was a derivative of the two-door wagon. In line with other Chevrolet series, the two-door hardtops were called Sport [[coupe]]s. Four-door hardtops, dubbed Sport Sedans, were available (1966 through 1972).  A two-door station wagon was available in 1964 and 1965 in the base 300 series. Station wagons were marketed with exclusive nameplates: Greenbrier (previously used with the [[Chevrolet Corvair|Corvair]] based vans), Concours, and Concours Estate. Six-cylinder and V8 power was offered across the board. Chevelles were also assembled and sold in Canada. While similar to their stateside counterparts, the convertible was available in the base Chevelle series, a model never offered in the United States. The Chevelle was the basis for the [[Beaumont (automobile)|Beaumont]], a retrimmed model sold only in [[Canada]] by [[Pontiac]] dealers through 1969. Originally conceived as an upsizing of the [[Chevy II]] with a unibody platform (similar to the Fairlane and the full-size Chrysler B-platform of the same era) which originated with the XP-726 program, GM's \"senior compact\" A-platform used a body-on-frame construction using a suspension setup similar to its full sized automobiles with a four-link rear suspension (the differential has four control arms which are attached to the frame with rear coil springs sandwiched between the differential and spring pocket\u2014this design was used with the B platform vehicles and later used by Ford Motor Company with its FOX platform automobiles).\n\n====Chevelle SS====\n[[File:1965 Chevelle Malibu SS396.jpg|thumb|left|1965 Chevelle Malibu SS396 Hardtop Coupe]]\n\nThe Chevelle Super Sport, or [[Super Sport (Chevrolet)|SS]], represented Chevrolet's entry into the [[muscle car]] battle. Early 1964 and 1965 Chevelles had a Malibu SS badge on the rear quarter panel. Chevelles with the mid-1965 Z16 option, priced at US$1,501 in 1965,<ref>Flory, J. \"Kelly\", Jr. ''American Cars 1960\u20131972'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Coy, 2004), p. 354.</ref> had the emblem on the front fender as well as distinct in-house style numbers: 737 for the hardtop and 767 for the convertible.<ref>All Chevelles were 13000 series. Flory, p. 356.</ref> \nThe $162 Super Sport package was available on the upscale Malibu two-door hardtop and convertible models; the option added special exterior brightwork with SS emblems and the 14-inch full-disc wheel covers from the [[Chevrolet Impala#Impala SS (1961\u20131969)|Impala SS]]. Inside, the vinyl bucket-seat interior featured a floor console for models equipped with the optional Muncie aluminum four-speed-manual or Powerglide two-speed automatic instead of the standard three-speed manual. Malibu SS also came with a four-gauge cluster in place of engine warning lights, and a dash-mounted tachometer was optional.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---May/1965-Chevrolet-Chevelle-Owners-Guide/1965-Chevrolet-Chevelle-Manual-11 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518081345/http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---May/1965-Chevrolet-Chevelle-Owners-Guide/1965-Chevrolet-Chevelle-Manual-11 |archivedate=2015-05-18 }}</ref> The available 283-cubic-inch four-barrel V8 engine was rated at 220 horsepower, the same rating as the [[1957 Chevrolet]] Power-Pak 283 engine.\n\nStarting in mid-1964, the Chevelle could be ordered with the division\u2019s 327-cubic-inch V8, in either 250 or {{convert|300|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Both used a four-barrel carburetor and 10.5:1 compression. For 1965, Chevrolet also added the 350-hp 327 V8 as Regular Production Option (RPO) L79. \nA total of 294,160 Chevelles were built the first year, including 76,860 SS models.<ref>The Editors of Consumer Reports</ref> After 1965, the Malibu SS badge disappeared except for those sold in Canada. A limited 201 Malibu SS396 'Z-16' [[big-block]]-equipped cars were also eventually produced starting in late 1965, with most being built between mid-March and mid-April.\n[[File:66 Chevelle Malibu SS396.jpg|thumb|left|1966 Chevelle Malibu Convertible]]\nThe Chevelle SS396 became a series of its own in 1966 with series/style numbers 13817 and 13867.\nSS396 sport coupes and convertibles used the same Malibu sport coupe and convertible bodies with reinforced frames and revised front suspension: higher-rate springs, recalibrated shocks, and thicker front stabilizer bar, but with different exterior trim. They also had simulated hood scoops, red-stripe tires, and bright trim moldings. The performance engines available included three, 396 CID V8s \u2013 the standard, rated at {{convert|325|hp|abbr=on}}, an optional {{convert|360|hp|abbr=on}}, and an optional {{convert|375|hp|abbr=on}}, respectively (the mid-horsepower 396 was rated at {{convert|360|hp|abbr=on}} for 1966 only and {{convert|350|hp|abbr=on}} thereafter). The SS396 series lasted from 1966 through 1968 before being relegated to an option package in 1969. The 1966 and 1967 model years were the only two years of the 'strut back' 2-door sport coupe with its own style number, 17.<ref name=\"Flory, p.434\">Flory, p.434.</ref>\n\nIn Canada, sporty Chevelles continued to wear \"Malibu SS\" badges for the 1966 and early 1967 model years. These Chevelles were available with the same equipment as non-SS Malibu models in the U.S., and did not get the domed hood or the blackout front and rear treatment.  Redline tires were not available on Canadian Chevelles in 1966.  A 1966 Malibu SS factory photo shows wheel covers on the car from the 1965 Impala.  The Canadian Malibu SS got its \"SS\" name from the \"Sports Option\" package under RPO A51 and was primarily a trim option.  This A51 option came with bucket seats, a center console (except when the three-speed manual transmission was ordered), standard full wheel covers, and the ribbed rocker panel moldings.  The \"Malibu SS\" emblems were carried over from the 1965 Malibu SS series.  This Canadian option could be ordered with any six-cylinder or V8 engine available at the time. Starting in January 1967, the Chevelle SS396 took over and became its own 138xx series, the same as in the U.S. Produced at the Oshawa, Ontario production facility, only 867 SS396 models were produced during 1967.\n\n=====Z16 SS396=====\nOnly 200 regular production 1965 Z16 Chevelles were built at the Kansas City plant. The Z16 option included the convertible boxed frame, a narrowed rear axle and brake assemblies from the contemporary Impala, heavy-duty suspension, plus virtually all Chevelle comfort and convenience options.  The Z16 standard big-block 396 Turbo-Jet [[V8 engine|V8]] (fitted with hydraulic lifters instead of the solid lifters of the same motor used in the Corvette) came only with the Muncie wide-ratio four-speed manual transmission.  The rear panel of the Z16 had unique black and chrome trim which framed untrimmed Chevelle 300-style taillights (Malibu and Malibu SS models had bright silver-painted lens trim).\n\nThe prototype Z16 Chevelle was built at the Baltimore plant. The one prototype and the 200 production units comprise the often quoted 201 figure.  One convertible was reportedly specially built for Chevy General Manager Semon \"Bunkie\" Knudsen, but is understood to have been destroyed. Approximately 75 Z16s are presently accounted for.<ref>http://www.z16chevelle.com/Z16%20Registry.htm</ref>\n\n====New Body 1966\u20131967====\n1966 saw a complete restyle of the Chevelle on the previous frame that included smooth contours, a broad new grille and bumper treatment, and curved side windows. Bulging rear fender lines and a \"flying buttress\" roofline (tunneled into the \"C\" pillar) were highlights of the '66 hardtops, shared with other GM \"A\" body models. The new body reflected the \"Coke bottle\" body shape that became the fad for American cars in the mid-1960s.  A 4-door hardtop-styled Sport Sedan joined the Malibu series. It was an attractive car and was offered through 1972, but never achieved the high-production figures as the pillared sedan.  Chevelles continued in 300, 300 Deluxe, and Malibu trim. Available engines were a 327-cubic-inch V8 instead of either of the sixes, or the mid-level option, a 220-horsepower 283-cubic-inch V8. Options included a tachometer, mag-style wheel covers, and sintered-metallic brakes, four-way power seats, a tissue dispenser, and cruise control.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1966_Chevrolet/1966_Chevrolet_Chevelle_Brochure/1966%20Chevrolet%20Chevelle-14.html|title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1966_Chevrolet/1966_Chevrolet_Chevelle_Brochure|work=oldcarbrochures.com}}</ref>\n[[File:1967 Chevrolet Chevelle 300 Deluxe V8 4-dr, front left.jpg|thumb|left|1967 Chevelle 300 Deluxe V8 four-door sedan]]\n\nThe 1967 models received a facelift. Large wraparound taillamps went into a new rear end with standard backup lights. \"What you'll see inside,\" claimed the sales brochure for the 1967 Chevelle, \"will probably bring on a severe compulsion to go driving.\" Front disc brakes were available on all models, and a new dual master cylinder brake system incorporated a warning light.  Chevrolet also added 14\" wheels and a three speed automatic transmission to their line of transmissions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldride.com/library/1967_chevrolet_chevelle.html|title=1967 CHEVROLET CHEVELLE Information Specifications Resources Pictures|work=oldride.com}}</ref> New safety equipment became standard, including a collapsible steering column.<ref>1967 Chevelle brochure</ref> The SS396 continued as its own series with both sport coupe and convertible body styles. The 375-horsepower 396-cubic-inch V8 was dropped from the options list until late in the model year and returned with 612 being sold. Seven transmissions were available: two manual three-speeds, two manual four-speeds, an overdrive three-speed, and two automatics. The manual-shift feature of the Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission was featured. Options included Superlift air shock absorbers, Strato-ease headrests, and special instrumentation.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Second generation (1968\u20131972)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name           = Second-generation\n| image          = 1968 Chevelle SS396.jpg \n| caption        = 1968 Chevrolet Chevelle SS396 Hardtop Coupe \n| assembly       = [[Arlington, Texas]] (commenced 1970 model year), United States<br />[[Lakewood Assembly]], [[Atlanta, Georgia]], United States<br />[[Baltimore, Maryland]], United States<br />[[Flint, Michigan]], United States<br />[[Framingham, Massachusetts]], United States<br />[[Fremont, California]], United States<br />[[Kansas City, Kansas]], United States<br />[[Van Nuys, California]], United States<br />[[Oshawa, Ontario]], Canada<br />[[Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, Quebec]], Canada <br />[[Caracas, Venezuela]] <br />[[Antwerp, Belgium]], [[Europe]]\n| model_years    = 1968\u20131972\n| production     = 1967\u20131972\n| engine         = {{convert|230|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#230|Chevrolet]]'' [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br />{{convert|250|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#250|Chevrolet]]'' I6<br />{{convert|307|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Chevrolet small-block engine#307|Small-Block]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]<br />{{convert|327|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Chevrolet small-block engine#327|Small-Block]]'' V8<br />{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Chevrolet small-block engine#350|Small-Block]]'' V8<br />{{convert|396|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#396 and 402|Big-Block]]'' V8<br />{{convert|400|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Chevrolet small-block engine#400|Small-Block]]'' V8<br />{{convert|402|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#396 and 402|Big-Block]]'' V8<br />{{convert|427|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#427|Big-Block]]'' V8<br />{{convert|454|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#454|Big-Block]]'' V8\n| transmission    = 3-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]<br />4-speed manual<br />2-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />3-speed automatic\n| wheelbase      = {{convert|112|in|0|abbr=on}} Coupe<ref>https://www.gmheritagecenter.com/docs/gm-heritage-archive/vehicle-information-kits/Chevelle/1968-Chevrolet-Chevelle.pdf</ref><br />{{convert|116|in|0|abbr=on}} Sedan/Wagon\n| length = {{convert|201.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (sedan)<br /> {{convert|206.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (wagon)<br /> {{convert|197.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (coupe)\n| width = {{convert|75.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|53.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (sedan)<br /> {{convert|55.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (wagon)<br /> {{convert|52.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (coupe)\n| weight         = {{convert|3520|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} \n| related        = [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]]<br /> [[Pontiac Tempest]]<br />[[Pontiac Le Mans]], [[Buick Special]], [[Buick Skylark]], [[Oldsmobile F-85]]<br />[[Oldsmobile Cutlass]]<br />[[Acadian (automobile)|Acadian Beaumont]], [[Beaumont (automobile)|Beaumont]], [[Chevrolet El Camino]], [[GMC Sprint]]<br />[[Chevrolet Opala]]<br />[[Holden Kingswood|Holden Kingswood 2-nd generation]]\n| aka             = [[Chevrolet Malibu]]\n| body_style     = 2-door [[hardtop]]<br />2-door [[coupe]]<br />2-door [[convertible]] <br />2-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] <br />4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br />4-door [[hardtop]]<br />4-door [[station wagon]]<br />2-door [[coup\u00e9 utility]]\n}}\n\n===Overview===\n\nThe 1968 Chevelle received an all-new distinctly sculpted body with tapered front fenders and a rounded beltline. The car adopted a long-hood/short-deck profile with a high rear-quarter \"kick-up\". While all 1967 Chevelle models rode a {{Convert|115|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase, the 1968 coupes and convertibles now rode a {{convert|112|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase. The sedans and wagons turned to a {{convert|116|in|mm|adj=on}} span. Tread width grew an inch front and rear. Hardtop coupes featured a semi-fastback, flowing roofline (with a long hood and short deck, mimicking the Camaro (which itself was an answer to the Ford Mustang). Top-trim models (including the SS 396 and new luxury Concours) featured GM's new Hide-A-Way wiper system. Lesser Chevelles would get that change later.\n\nThe entry level Chevelle 300 (131 - 132 VIN prefix) was available as a pillared coupe and/or station wagon (Nomad) while the 300 Deluxe and Nomad Custom (133 or 134 VIN prefix) had a 2-door hardtop added to the lineup (fourth and fifth VIN characters will be 37; with the previous 300 Deluxe the hardtop was available with the Malibu and SS396 but not the base 300/Deluxe in the USA not counting those produced for the Canadian market). The Super Sport (SS396 sport coupe, convertible, and El Camino pickup) became series on its own. Chevrolet produced 60,499 SS 396 sport coupes, 2,286 convertibles, and 5,190 El Caminos; 1968 was the only year the El Camino body style would get its own SS396 series designation (13880).<ref>{{cite web |title=Vehicle Profile: 1968 Chevrolet Chevelle |url=https://journal.classiccars.com/2013/07/01/1968-chevrolet-chevelle/ |website=The ClassicCars.com Journal |accessdate=8 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nGovernment-mandated side marker lighting was incorporated, with early 1968 SS 396 light bezels seen with the SS 396 nomenclature - at some point in the later production cycle the engine callout had a 396 also shared with the Chevy II Nova SS (the side marker bezels, also sourced from the Chevy II Nova in 307, 327, and 396 displacements) had the engine displacement except for the six cylinder models). Black-accented Super Sports had F70x14 red-stripe tires and a standard 325-horsepower 396-cubic-inch Turbo-Jet V8 engine with the special twin-domed hood; 350 and 375-horsepower 396 engines were optional. The SS 396 sport coupe started at $2,899 - or $236 more than a comparable Malibu with its 307-cubic-inch V8. All-vinyl bucket seats and a console were optional.  Three luxury Concours options became available in March 1968 for the 4-door sedan, the 4-door sport sedan (and the hardtop coupe) and consisted of special sound insulation, and a deep-padded instrument panel with [[Woodie (car body style)#Simulated woodgrain|simulated woodgrain]] accents and all-vinyl color-keyed interiors. Interiors were sourced and shared with select Buick, Oldsmobile, or Pontiac A body patterns - during the middle of the 1968 model year, some Chevrolet A-bodies (including the El Camino) ended up with interior door panels shared with the Buick or Oldsmobile A bodies (Special, Skylark) where supply and demand issues forced a substitution, and during the April 1968 production month in the wake of the [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassination of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]] there were some work stoppages e.g. strikes. A ribbed stainless steel panel was bolted to the rear taillight panel and a 'Concours By Chevrolet' emblem on the rear decklid. Other options included power windows and door locks. With the hardtop a rare option is a horseshoe floor shifter with integrated console (with bucket seats - sourced from the SS). These Concours options (ZK5, ZK6, and ZK7) should not be confused with the two Concours station wagons. At the time the ZK5, ZK6, and ZK7 Concours package was the equivalent of the Caprice. Also new for 1968 was the elimination of the term \"sedan\" for the 2-door pillar body style.  This was now called a coupe (or pillar coupe) while the 2-door hardtop remained a sport coupe.  These coupe/sport coupe designations would continue into 1969 as well.\n\nThe Concours Estate Wagon was one of four distinct Chevelle wagon models. A one-year [[Chevrolet Nomad|Nomad]], Nomad Custom was offered.\n\nRegular Chevelle engines started with a {{convert|140|hp}} Turbo-Thrift six or the new {{convert|200|hp}} Turbo-Fire 307 V8, and a {{convert|325|hp}} version of the 327-cubic-inch V8. Manual transmission cars got GM's \"Air Injection Reactor (A.I.R)\" smog pump. New Federal safety-mandated equipment included side marker lights, as well as shoulder belts for outboard front seat occupants on cars built after December 1, 1967.\n\n===Design Changes 1969\u20131972===\n[[File:69 Chevelle SS396.jpg|thumb|left|1969 Chevelle SS396 Hardtop Coupe]]\n'''1969''' Chevelles were billed as \"America's most popular mid-size car.\" They showed only minor changes for 1969, led by revised front-end styling. A single chrome bar connected quad headlights (which became a familiar Chevrolet trademark) with a revised front grille, now cast in ABS plastic, and a slotted bumper held the parking lights. Taillight lenses were larger and more vertical, flowing into the quarter panels. Smaller side marker lighting bezels were phased in (shared with the Camaro and using the lens assembly as the previous year). Front vent windows (hardtop and convertibles only) began to fade away now that Astro Ventilation (first introduced on the 1966 Buick Riviera which was used a year earlier on the Camaro and Caprice) was sending outside air into several Chevelle models. The Chevelle lineup slimmed down to Nomad, 300 Deluxe/Greenbrier, Malibu/Concours, and Concours Estate series, and the base 300 series was history.  No longer a series of its own, the SS 396 turned into a $347.60 option package for any two-door model. That meant not just a convertible, sport coupe, or pickup, but even the pillared coupe and sport coupe in the lower-rent 300 Deluxe series (except the base 300 Deluxe El Camino pickup).  Fewer SS396-optioned 300 Deluxe coupes and sport coupes were built than their Malibu counterparts and they are solid gold for collectors. The Super Sport option included a 325-horsepower 396-cubic-inch V8 beneath a double-domed hood, along with a black-out grille displaying an SS emblem and a black rear panel. More potent editions of the 396 engine also made the options list, developing 350 or {{convert|375|hp}}. SS396s produced from this point on shared the same VIN prefix with the Malibu sport coupe (136), with the exception of the 300 Deluxe based SS396s using (134), where the original buildsheet and/or Protect-O-Plate (which is an aluminum tag included with the original sales invoice from Chevrolet dealers) can ID a genuine SS (especially for a numbers matching original which is unaltered); however, the VIN number alone cannot ID a genuine SS as in previous years. Around an estimated 323 Chevelle 2-door hardtops were fitted with an [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#427|L72 {{convert|427|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}]] rated at {{convert|425|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,800 rpm and {{convert|460|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 4,000 rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]], where some Chevrolet dealers used the Central Office Production Order (this also included some Camaros and Novas of the same model year) - some COPOs were sold through select Chevrolet dealerships and out of the 323 COPO orders, a confirmed 99 were sold through the Yenko Chevrolet dealership in Canonsburg, PA. During the 1969 model year a police package (RPO B07) was available on the Chevelle 300 Deluxe 4-door sedan where some were optioned with the RPO L35 (396) motor along with a boxed frame (also shared with fleet orders e.g. taxicabs and rental cars); at the time the police option was reintroduced since the 1964/65 model years (at the time midsize squads came with economy powertrain usually in the case of the Chevelle a third generation Chevrolet inline six. The 300 Deluxe squads was not a sales success since the market was dominated by rival manufacturer Chrysler Corporation where its B platform (and its full sized sedans) outsold its competitors. Chevelle station wagons came in three levels: Concours, Nomad, and Greenbrier\u2014the last a badge formerly used on the Corvair van. A new dual-action tailgate operated either in the traditional manner or as a panel-type door. Wagons stretched {{Convert|208|in|mm}} overall versus {{Convert|197|in|mm}} for coupes. Also the Concours option package (ZK5, ZK6, and ZK7) from the previous year was continued. \nNew round instrument pods replaced the former linear layout. Chevelle options included headlight washers, power windows and locks, and a rear defroster. Chevy's midsize production rose this year. About seven percent of all Malibus had a six-cylinder engine, while about 86,000 came with the SS 396 option. All 1969 Chevelles had a new locking steering column one year ahead of the Federal requirement,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FyoDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA70&dq=popular+science+1930&hl=en&ei=RJLlTt-gB8edgweY-smBBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDMQ6AEwADhu#v=onepage&q&f=true \"The Popular Science Anti-Car-Theft Device Competition\"] ''Popular Science\", July 1969, p.70.</ref> and headrests required for all cars sold in the U.S. after January 1, 1969.\n\nIn 1969 Chevrolet developed a [[Steam car#Modern steam cars|steam powered concept vehicle]], designated the '''SE 124''' based on a Chevelle fitted it with a 50&nbsp;hp [[Doble steam car#Bresler Brothers|Bresler]] steam engine in place of its gasoline engine.

The 1970 Chevelle shared many sheet metal body parts with the 1970 Buick Skylark GSX, both are GM automobiles and have interchangeable sheet metal. They are  also the only two muscle cars to share the same roofline. The 1970 Chevelle came in Sport Coupe, Sport Sedan, convertible, four-door sedan, a couple of wagons, and [[coup\u00e9 utility]] (the El Camino) body styles.  Only three of these (Malibu sport coupe, Malibu convertible and El Camino pickup) were available with a choice of one of two SS options; RPO Z25 with the SS 396 (402 cid) engine and RPO Z15 with the new 454 cid engine.  The base model was now simply called Chevelle in lieu of the former base 300 Deluxe, and was only available as a Sport Coupe or four-door sedan. In Canada, the base series retained its 300 Deluxe name, with appropriate badging on each front fender just behind the front wheel well. The 300 Deluxe 2-door sedan was cancelled and replaced by the base Chevelle Sport Coupe, a 2 door pillarless hardtop.  The hardtop, convertible, and sedan received the upgraded sheetmetal but the station wagons and El Camino retained the previous year sheetmetal panels (which went on for the next 2 model years). Station wagons were the entry level Nomad, the Chevelle level Greenbrier, the Malibu level Concours and an upscale Concours Estate. New options included power door locks and a stalk-mounted wiper control. Production was expanded to the [[Arlington Assembly|GM Arlington Assembly]] plant in Arlington, Texas (where the Chevelle was assembled with its corporate siblings in this case the Oldsmobile Cutlass).\n[[File:1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS454 (15748244098).jpg|thumb|right|1970 Chevelle SS 454]]\n[[File:1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS (21443537054).jpg|thumb|left|1970 Chevelle SS]]\nEngine choices ranged from the standard {{convert|155|hp}} six-cylinder and 200-horsepower 307-cubic-inch V8, to a pair of 350 V8s and a pair of 402 engines. RPO Z25 SS equipment option included one of these 402 cid engines but was still marketed as a 396.  The second 402 cid engine was available under RPO, rated at 330&nbsp;hp with single exhaust, and was available in any V8 series except an SS optioned Malibu or El Camino. 1970 also saw the introduction of the 454 cid engine and was only available with the RPO Z15 SS Equipment option. The base [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#454|{{convert|454|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engine]] was rated at {{convert|360|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}}, which was also available with cowl induction; and the optional LS6 version equipped with a single 4-barrel 800 [[Cubic foot#Cubic foot per minute|CFM]] [[Holley Performance Products|Holley]] [[carburetor]] produced {{convert|450|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5600 rpm and {{convert|500|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3600 rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supercars.net/blog/1964\u21921972-chevrolet-chevelle-ss454/|website=supercars.net|title=1964\u21921972 Chevrolet Chevelle SS 454|accessdate=July 5, 2018|editor=Nick D. |date=March 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://heacockclassic.com/articles/the-best-muscle-car-1970-ls6-chevelle/|website=heacockclassic.com|title=The 1970 LS6 Chevelle Was America\u2019s King Of The Streets|accessdate=July 5, 2018|editor=Paul Zazarine |date=November 14, 2014}}</ref> There were 4,475 LS6 Chevelles produced. \n[[File:70 Chevelle SS396.jpg|thumb|left|1970 Chevelle SS396 Hardtop Coupe]]\n[[File:1970 red Chevrolet Chevelle SS side.JPG|thumb|right|1970 Chevelle SS]]\nThe SS 396 Chevelle included a {{convert|350|hp}} Turbo-Jet 396 V8, special suspension, \"power dome\" hood, black-accented grille, resilient rear-bumper insert, and wide-oval tires on sport wheels. Though a {{convert|375|hp}} cowl induction version was available, few were sold in favor of the newly introduced 454 engine during late-1969 timeframe. The LS5 454-cubic-inch V8 produced {{convert|360|hp}} in standard form and a cowl induction version was also available. The LS6 produced a claimed 450 gross HP in solid-lifter, high-compression guise.\n\n\"You can make our tough one even tougher,\" the brochure explained, by adding Cowl Induction to either the SS 396 or the SS 454. Step on the gas, and a scoop opened \"to shoot an extra breath of cool air into the engine air intake....like second wind to a distance runner.\" Neither functional hood lock pins nor hood and deck stripes were standard with either SS option, but were part of the optional ZL2 cowl induction hood option. The {{convert|454|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} LS5 [[V8 engine|V8]] was rated at {{convert|360|hp|abbr=on}}.\n\n===New design for 1971===\n[[File:2019 Food & Shelter Car Show 06 (1971 Chevrolet Chevelle SS).jpg|thumb|1971 Chevrolet Chevelle SS]]\n\nThe '''1971''' Chevelles were treated to new front-end and rear-end styling that included large Power-Beam single-unit headlights, a reworked grille and bumper, and integral park/signal/marker lights. The grille was widened and featured a bright horizontal bar that divided it into two sections.  At the center of this bar was a large Chevy bowtie for Malibus, or a large \"SS\" emblem for the SS models.  The grille on the Super Sport was painted flat black, other models got a silver finished grille.  Base Chevelles got a thinner, plain bar with no ornamentation.  A small \"Chevelle\" nameplate was located in the lower left corner of the grille.  New dual round taillights were integral with the back bumper. Because SS models suffered heavy insurance surcharges, Chevrolet introduced the \"Heavy Chevy\" at midyear, which was based on the base Chevelle, and was available with any V8 engine except the 454, which was exclusive to SS models. The Heavy Chevy (RPO YF3) was only available with the base Chevelle sport coupe (13437) and was primarily a dress up option and even it was limited to options available on the standard Chevelle sport coupe; vinyl carpeting, front bench seat, no center console shift, etc.\n\nChevrolet specifications for 1971 included both \"gross\" and \"net\" horsepower figures for all engines. The standard Chevelle SS engine was a two-barrel 350-cubic-inch V8 rated at 245 gross (165 net) horsepower. Optional was a four-barrel carbureted version of the 350 V8 rated at 275 gross (200 net with dual exhaust and 175 net with single exhaust) horsepower. The 402 cid big-block engine continued to be optional as the SS 396 but was only available in one horsepower rating, 300 gross (260 net) horsepower, and was not available with cowl induction. The base LS5 454 V8 produced 365 gross and 285 net horsepower, but cowl induction was available that produced more power because of the air induction and louder exhaust system. The LS6 454 option, which was originally announced as a regular production option on the Chevelle SS for 1971, was dropped early in the model year and no official records indicate that any 1971 Chevelles were assembled with the LS6 engine.\n\nFor 1971, the SS option could be ordered with any optional V8 and became more of a dress-up option than a performance option. The SS option was reduced to one RPO code, RPO Z15, and was only available for the Chevelle Malibu.  This RPO code required any optional engine and transmission available in the Chevelle lineup.  Since the 307 V8 was the standard base V8 in 1971, it could not be ordered with the SS option; one had to order the LS3 402 or the LS5 454, or one of the two 350 V8 engines (L65 or L48 - which reintroduced the small block to the SS option for the first time since the 1965 model year for USA market Chevelles).\n\nGM mandated all divisions design their engines to run on lower-octane regular, low-lead or unleaded gasoline. To permit usage of the lower-octane fuels, all engines featured low compression ratios (9:1 and lower; well below the 10.25-11.25:1 range on high-performance engines of 1970 and earlier). This move reduced horsepower ratings on the big-block engines to 300 for the 402 cubic-inch V8 but the LS5 454 option got an \"advertised\" five-horsepower increase to 365.\n\nBoth 350 V8 engines, as well as the dual exhaust 402 cid V8 engine, were available without the SS option; only the LS5 454 V8 required the SS option. A single exhaust version of the 402 cid engine existed in 1970 with 330 gross hp and in 1972 with 210 net hp.  In 1971 the single exhaust version of the 402 cid engine produced 206 net hp, but only appeared in the full size Chevrolet brochure.\n\n[[File:1972 Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu.jpg|thumb|right|1972 Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu Sedan]]\n'''1972''' Chevelles featured single-unit parking/side marker lights on their front fenders, outside of a revised twin-bar grille. All Malibus had concealed wipers. The SS equipment option requirements remained the same as those in 1971, any optional V8. The 1972 Chevelle series had wide enough appeal to qualify as America's second-best-selling car. Base versions again included a four-model wagon series. Upscale versions were Malibus including the convertible models. More than 24,000 Malibu Sport Sedans were built, with a standard 307-cubic-inch V8 rated at 130 (net) horsepower. This 4-door hardtop used the same body as the 1968-71 models, and although it was attractive, it was the least popular body style in the lineup.  It was not available with the overhead-valve \"Turbo-Thrift\" six cylinder engine.  With that V8, the Malibu Sport Coupe was the top seller by far starting at $2,923. The six-cylinder version ran $90 less. Powertrain options included the 175-horsepower 350-cubic-inch V8 and 240-horsepower 402-cubic-inch (still known as a 396), as well as a 454 that produced {{convert|270|hp}} under the net rating system. Chevelles sold in California were not available with the 307 V8, but had a 350-cubic-inch engine. Through the 1970s, California cars often had different powertrains than those marketed in states with less-stringent emissions regulations.\n\nThe 1972 Chevelle SS had a top engine rated at 270 net&nbsp;hp (201&nbsp;kW) conforming with GM's decree that all engines were to be rated at their net engine ratings. All other engines on the SS roster were unchanged from 1971.  1972 was the last year for the cowl induction option for the 454 cid engine and was not even mentioned in the 1972 Chevelle brochure.\n\nChevelle wagons measured {{convert|10|in|mm}} shorter than full-size wagons and weighed about half a ton less, but sold much slower. Model-year output totaled 49,352 Chevelles and 290,008 Malibus\u2014plus 54,335 station wagons.\n\n===The Yenko Chevelles===\nRetired Corvair and Corvette [[race car]] driver [[Don Yenko]] (a Pittsburgh-area Chevrolet dealer) developed his own line of signature Chevelles, [[Chevrolet Camaro|Camaro]]s and [[Chevrolet Nova|Nova]]s, marketed as Yenko Super Cars.

Due to concern over proposed Federal rollover standards, [[convertible]] and 4-door [[hardtop]] models were discontinued, while the 2-door hardtop was replaced by a [[Pillar (car)|pillared]] coupe\u2014named \"Colonnade Hardtop\". This body style featured a semi-[[fastback]] roofline, frameless door glass and fixed, styled \"B\" pillars, structurally strong enough to contribute to occupant safety of a roll-over type accident. This move was somewhat controversial with the buying public as hardtops had been a staple of American cars for over 20 years and their presence almost taken for granted. Once the initial surprise was overcome however, the Colonnade models became a huge sales success. The Monte Carlo coupe was the biggest seller of the Chevrolet A-body line, although the bread-and-butter sedans and station wagons also sold well. Distinctive rear quarter glass on 2-door coupes and new side windows with styled center pillars were featured on 4-door models. Rear windows on coupes no longer opened. In addition to the new roofline, front and rear ends looked markedly different this year as 1973 was the year of the federally mandated {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} front bumper, adding to the car's length. Additional new body features were an acoustical double-panel roof, tighter-fitting glass and flush style outside door handles. [[Wheelbase]] dimensions were retained;  a sporty {{Convert|112|in|mm}} for coupes and {{Convert|116|in|mm}} for sedans and station wagons, but bodies were five inches (127&nbsp;mm)  longer and an inch wider with a {{Convert|1|in|mm|adj=on}} wider wheel track. The station wagon, available in 6 or 9 passenger seating, featured a new counterbalanced liftgate which allowed for easier entry and loading up to 85 cubic feet.<ref name=\"MT73\">Motor Trend 1973 Buyers Guide</ref>\n\nPlans to release the updated A-body lineup was scheduled for the 1972 model year but a strike which occurred at some GM assembly plants delayed the release for a full model year, eventually extending the lifecycle of the 1968-era generation; the redesigned A-bodies were designed in studio where it had more of a European influence - at the time of development John Z. DeLorean was the chairman at the Chevrolet division where he delayed some product releases and extending the lifecycle of some of its products; the redesigned A-bodies had some styling cues lifted from the concurrent second generation F-bodies - the front suspension was integrated into the A-body redesign with output from respective GM divisions (each division had its own sheetmetal design).\n\n1973 models also introduced molded full foam front and rear seat construction, a flow-through power ventilation system, an inside hood release, a larger 22 gallon fuel tank, and \"flush and dry\" rocker panels introduced first on the redesigned 1971 full-size Chevrolets.\nAnother structural improvement was side-impact guard beams in the doors, as required by new [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards]].<ref name=\"MT73\"/> New options included swivel bucket seats with console for coupes and Turbine I steel-backed urethane wheels. A power moonroof was an option in 1973-75.<ref>1973\u20131977 Chevrolet Chevelle brochures</ref> Interior roominess of the '73 Chevelle was improved, particularly in the rear. Headroom was up slightly and shoulder room gains were by {{Convert|1.6|in|mm}}. Rear seat legroom was up {{Convert|3.5|in|mm}} in sedans. Another was a {{convert|15.3|cuft|L|adj=on}} luggage capacity, an increase of {{convert|2.5|cuft|L}} over 1972 models. Still another benefit of the new body designs was greatly improved visibility, up 25% in coupes and wagons, and 35% in sedans. The unusually thin windshield pillars also contributed to much better visibility.\n\n===New chassis===\n\nThe [[chassis]] design was new , with a sturdier [[perimeter frame]], revised chassis/body mounts, larger 8\u00bd&nbsp;inch rear axle, wider 6-inch wheel rim width, revised rear control arm bushings, increased front and rear suspension travel, adjusted [[shock absorber]] location, and revised front suspension geometry<ref>Chevrolet engineering report-73 Chevelle</ref> - The left wheel was adjusted to have slightly more positive [[camber angle|camber]] than the right which resulted in a more uniform and stable steering feel on high-crown road surfaces while maintaining freeway stability. Clearances for spring travel were also revised; the [[coil spring]]s at each wheel were computer-selected to match the individual car's weight. Front [[disc brakes]] were now standard on all '73 Chevelles. [[John Z. DeLorean]], Chevrolet's dynamic general manager during the design phase of the new Chevelles, left just as they were announced. He departed in late September 1972 to start a brief period as vice president of General Motors's Car and Truck Group. Critics compared the GM Colonnade line favorably to Ford and Chrysler intermediates.<ref name=\"The Editors of Consumer Guide\">The Editors of Consumer Guide</ref>\n\nFive power teams were available for 1973 Chevelle models; the 250 inline-six and 307 2-barrel V8 both rated at {{Convert|110|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} were std. engines on Deluxe and Malibu. The 350 2-barrel V8 of {{Convert|145|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} was the base Laguna engine. Options for any Chevelle included a 350 4-barrel V8 of {{Convert|175|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and a 454 4-barrel V8 rated at {{Convert|245|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Hardened engine valve seats and hydraulic camshafts made these engines reliable for many miles, and allowed them to accept the increasingly popular unleaded regular gasoline. 3 speed manual transmission was standard; 4 speed manual and Turbo Hydra-Matic 3 speed automatic were optional. Crossflow radiators and coolant reservoirs that prevented air from entering the system prevented overheating.<ref name=\"73brochure\">1973 Chevrolet Chevelle Brochure</ref>\n\n===Revised model lineup===\n\n[[File:1973 Chevelle Malibu SS.jpg|thumb|left|1973 Chevelle Malibu SS Colonnade Coupe]]\n\nMalibu and the newly named Deluxe series base model featured the new {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} bumper system with a large chrome front bumper and a chrome rear bumper. Malibu series interiors included cloth and vinyl or all vinyl seat trim and deep-twist carpeting.\nDeluxe series interiors featured cloth and vinyl or knit vinyl seat trim. Floor coverings were color-keyed in vinyl-coated rubber.\nThe SS was now a trim option limited to the mid-level Malibu series. Shoppers could even get an SS station wagon this year - with the option of a 454-cubic-inch V8 engine, no less\u2014but the mix of sport and utilitarian wagon virtues would last only a single season. Included was a black grill with SS emblem, lower bodyside and wheel opening striping, bright roof drip moldings, color-keyed dual sport mirrors, black taillight bezels, SS fender and rear panel emblems, special front and rear stabilizer bars, 14x7 inch rally wheels, 70-series raised white lettered tires, special instrumentation and SS interior emblems.<ref name=\"73brochure\"/>\nThe SS option required an available 350 or 454 V8 with 4-speed or Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission.\n\nChevrolet honored [[California]] beach resorts once again by naming the top Chevelle series [[Chevrolet Chevelle Laguna|Laguna]] with the Malibu taking the middle spot while the base series was called simply Deluxe. In addition to the standard 350 2 barrel V8, Laguna models featured specific front and rear styling including a body-colored [[polyurethane|urethane]] front end concealing the new [[5 mph bumper|5&nbsp;mph bumper]] system. On minor impact the urethane nose cone, backed up by shock- absorbing cylinders, deflects and rebounds; Laguna models also featured a specific [[die casting|diecast]] chrome [[grille]] with bowtie emblem, a body-colored (steel) rear [[bumper (automobile)|bumper]], front and rear bumper rub strips, bright roof drip moldings, bright wheel opening moldings, chrome taillight bezels, full wheel covers, and Laguna fender nameplates. Two Laguna station wagons were introduced, including a Laguna [[Woodie (car body style)|Estate]]. Laguna interiors were pattern cloth and vinyl or optional breathable all-vinyl upholstery, distinctive door trim with map pockets, deep-twist carpeting, woodgrain vinyl accents, and Laguna nameplates.<ref name=\"73brochure\"/>\n\nChevelle sales remained strong: 327,631 of them in the 1973 model year, plus 59,108 station wagons. The more upmarket Malibu continued to sell best by a wide margin and many Chevelles went to the fleet market, but the costlier Laguna coupe and sedan made a respectable showing, with 56,036 going to customers. Super Sport options went on 28,647 Chevelles of which 2500 held the big 454-cubic-inch engine. The SS option was dropped at the end of the model year.<ref>Cars of the 70's - By the Editors of Consumer Guide</ref>\n\n===Changes 1974\u20131977===\n{{unreferenced-section|date=March 2020}}\n{{originalresearch-section|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[File:1974Laguna.JPG|thumb|left|1974 Chevrolet Chevelle Laguna Type S-3 Colonnade Coupe]]\nYearly design changes to the front and rear mark the aesthetic differences as in previous years. The  Chevelles were top sellers for GM as was the [[Oldsmobile Cutlass]], [[Buick Regal]], and [[Pontiac Grand Am#1973\u20131975|Pontiac Grand Am]] which used the same corporate [[GM A platform|A-body]] platform.\n\n1974 Chevelles featured new Mercedes-inspired{{says who?|date=March 2020}} chrome grilles made of die-cast steel, and single rectangular [[Automotive lighting|tail lights]] replaced the dual round items on all coupes and sedans. More massive rear [[Bumper (automobile)|bumpers]] were also added, in accordance with stricter US [[NHTSA|Federal standards]].\n\nThe Laguna, which had been Chevelle's top of the line model in 1973, now became the sporty Laguna Type S-3 and was only available solely as a coupe. It combined Laguna luxury with the upgraded handling of the SS, which it replaced. Handling was further enhanced with the addition of new GR70-15 [[radial tire]]s. The new Laguna S-3 sported the urethane front end with a revised grille and new parking lamps, and new tail lights. As on all 1974 models, a more massive rear [[Bumper (automobile)|bumper]] was installed to comply with new, stricter [[NHTSA|US Federal standards]]; those on the Laguna S-3 were chrome-plated rather than painted body color as on the 1973 car. Standard equipment included a console, a vinyl roof, opera-type vertical rear quarter windows which could be covered with horizontal ribs for a few dollars extra; body side striping, Laguna S-3 badging, rally wheels, a 4-spoke steering wheel, firmer springs and [[shock absorber]]s, a front [[anti-roll bar]], and HR70x15 radial tires on rally wheels. Interior features included swivelling front [[bucket seat]]s and a six-dial instrument cluster. Production totaled 15,792 cars, with prices starting at $3,723 - but with plenty of options to raise the price above $5,000. Engine offerings included a standard {{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} providing {{convert|145|hp}} with a 2-barrel [[carburetor], with options for a {{convert|150|hp}} 2-barrel or {{convert|180|hp}} 4-barrel {{convert|400|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, and a {{convert|230|hp}} {{convert|454|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, except in California where a {{convert|155|hp}} 350 four-barrel V8 was standard and the 400 and 454 engines were optional. The 454 was available with GM's [[Turbo Hydramatic|THM-400 automatic]] or Muncie 4-speed [[manual transmission|manual]] transmission. Unitized 3-point [[seat belt]]s were introduced as on all Chevrolet models.\n\nThe upscale luxury trim level for 1974 was the new Malibu Classic, offered in sedan, coupe, and station wagon models. Unlike the 1973 Laguna, the Malibu Classic used the same front end and chrome bumper as the lesser models, and had the smaller vertical [[opera window]]s and a spring-loaded [[hood ornament]]. Early-production 1974 Classic coupes required the vinyl roof option; apparently{{says who?|date=March 2020}} inserts were used to cover part of the big rear quarter window.{{CN|date=March 2020}} Later-built cars were available with a standard painted roof that included the smaller opera window. This configuration was continued through the end of Chevelle production in 1977. Inside, the Malibu Classic interiors had notchback bench seats{{what?|date=March 2020}} upholstered in cloth or vinyl, carpeted door panels, and simulated woodgrain instrument panel trim. Optional on Malibu Classic coupes were swivelling [[bucket seat]]s in cloth or vinyl. The base Deluxe series was dropped for 1974, making the Malibu the base model. Base engines were the {{convert|250|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[straight-six engine]] and the 350 V8.\n\n[[File:1974 Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu Estate (front).jpg|thumb|1974 Chevelle Malibu Estate]]\nFor 1975 although the basic body styling was unaltered, the \"Colonnade\" designation was dropped. Front and rear styling refreshes including a vertical grid-patterned grille and new bright trim around the headlights. Rectangular tail lights sat flush with the body surface, connected by a brushed chrome panel. Malibu Classic coupes had distinctive opera windows. Landau coupes came with a vinyl roof, full wheel covers, whitewall tires, color-keyed body striping, and dual sport mirrors. Engines ranged from the standard 250 six and 350/2-barrel V8 to options of 400 and 454-cubic-inch size, the last with a 235-horsepower rating. Variable-ratio [[power steering]] was now standard with V8 models, and all 1975 models came with steel-belted [[radial tire]]s and a [[catalytic converter]]. A new \"Chevrolet Efficiency System\" included GM's new [[High energy ignition]] (HEI) for longer tune-up intervals and more complete combustion. [[Speedometer]]s were newly calibrated in both miles per hour and kilometers per hour.\n\nFollowing its debut as a 1974 model, the sporty Laguna Type S-3 left the lineup briefly, then reappeared in January 1975 with a slanted, urethane-covered aero-style nose designed for NASCAR (first use on a Chevrolet vehicle - later to show up on the 1983-88 Monte Carlo SS), louvered quarter windows, and could be ordered with a vinyl half-roof. The 454 engine option was available for the first half of the model year after which the 400 engine became the top engine. Options included an Econominder gauge package, affirming again that the age of muscle was long gone.\n\n1976 Chevelles earned a billing{{says who?|date=March 2020}} as \"a size whose time has come.\"{{CN|date=March 2020}} The top-of-the-line Malibu Classic got a crosshatch grille flanked on each side by two stacked newly-legal [[Parabolic aluminized reflector#Automotive headlamps|rectangular sealed-beam headlamps]], while lesser models had a waterfall grille and continued with the previous single round lamps. Three V8 engines were available: a new {{convert|305|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engine rated at {{convert|140|hp}}, a {{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engine providing {{convert|165|hp}}, and a {{convert|400|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engine with {{convert|175|hp}}. Period options included an \"Econominder\" gauge package.{{vague|date=March 2020}}{{cn|date=March 2020}} In its third and final year, the 1976 Laguna Type S-3 was little changed. It again featured quarter window louvers and a sloped, body-color urethane front end. Lagunas shared their round-gauge instrument panel with the Chevrolet Monte Carlo, and could be ordered with a four-spoke sport steering wheel as well as swivel front bucket seats and a center console. Lesser models made do with a more conventional dashboard and a linear-readout speedometer. Production of the Laguna edged up to 9,100 cars as the base price went to $4,621.\n\nThe 1977 Chevelles got new grilles. The lineup consisted of Malibu and Malibu Classic models in coupe, sedan, and station wagon body styles. Estate Wagons and the Laguna Type S-3 were gone. Malibu Classics, again the top model, switched to a vertical grille pattern and six-section taillights but kept their twin stacked headlights and stand-up hood ornament. Malibu grilles changed little. Fewer engine selections were available though the engines that remained gained a few horses. In standard form, Chevelles had a {{convert|250|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} six-cylinder engine or a {{convert|145|hp}}, 305 V8. The sole option beyond that was a {{convert|170|hp}}, four-barrel 350 V8, which came as standard equipment in the Malibu Classic station wagon. Malibu Classics had a luxurious cloth/vinyl split-bench front seat, color-keyed steering wheel, and woodgrain-accented instrument panel. Malibu options included a $46 Exterior Decor group, $54 tinted glass, and $33 full wheel covers. A total of 37,215 Malibu Classic Landau coupes were produced, as opposed to 73,739 Malibu Classic coupes and 28,793 Malibu coupes. In four-door sedan form, too, the Malibu Classics outsold base models by a substantial margin.\n\nA Chevelle SE (special edition) was available and provided front and rear spoilers, turbine II wheels, F60-15 tires, special graphics and decals, quarter window trim, front and rear sway bars, sport suspension, and a deluxe interior. Three colors{{which?|date=March 2020}} were available. 50 of these cars were built. \n\nThere is a Chevelle Malibu Classic SE (special edition) manufactured in 1976 that sported front and rear sway bars, F-41 sport suspension, and deluxe interior<ref>1037L6XXXXXXX</ref> \n\n1977 models were the last ones to bear the Chevelle name; with the all-new 1978 models, Malibu became the basic name for Chevrolet's midsize cars.\n\n===Reviews===\n\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2012}}\n\n''Speed and Supercar'' magazine said in a June 1974 \"Street Test\": \"Chevy gets it right on.\" \"Enough is plenty, that's how we feel about the 350 Laguna. \"...&nbsp;We couldn't pass up the opportunity to tell you what a groovy all around car it is even if it can't smoke the quarter-mile in 13 seconds.

The [[Chevrolet Laguna|Chevelle Laguna]] in particular was extremely successful allowing [[Cale Yarborough]] to win 34 races and earn the first two of three consecutive [[Sprint Cup Series|Grand National]] championships. Considered a limited edition model by NASCAR, the Laguna S-3 was ineligible for competition following the 1977 season.\n\n{{citation needed span|''Motor Trend'' said in 1973: \"While neither Chevrolet or [[Pontiac]] are back in racing, the new crop intermediates out of GM's styling studios are curiously [[aerodynamic]].

Parsons took the points lead with a third-place finish at [[Talladega Speedway]] in early May and never gave up the lead. He held off a late rally by Cale Yarborough to win by only 67.15 points.\n\nAugust 1976: Cale Yarborough drove his #11 Junior Johnson/Holly Farms Chevelle to the 1976 NASCAR Winston Cup Grand National championship. Yarborough won nine races along the way to the first of three consecutive titles. He finished last in the Daytona 500, but assumed command of the points chase in August.

Super Sport versions were produced through the 1973 model year, and [[Chevrolet Chevelle Laguna|Lagunas]] from 1973 through 1976. After a four-year absence, the [[Chevrolet El Camino|El Camino]] was reintroduced as part of the new Chevelle lineup in 1964. The G-body [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo|Monte Carlo]], introduced in 1970, also used a platform that was based heavily on the Chevelle platform, although it was lengthened ahead of the firewall. The [[Chevrolet Malibu|Malibu]], the top of the line model through 1972, completely replaced the Chevelle nameplate for the redesigned, downsized 1978 model year.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gunnell |first=John |title=Standard Catalog of Chevrolet, 1912-2003: 90 Years of History, Photos, Technical Data and Pricing |year=2011 |location=Cincinnati |publisher=F+W Media, |isbn=9781440230554 |oclc=1058297344 |page=204 https://books.google.com/books?id=YhRjDwAAQBAJ&dq=9781440230516&source=gbs_book_other_versions |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YhRjDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA204&dq=They+were+no+longer+called+Chevelles.+\u201cThe+1978+Malibu+from+Chevrolet\u201d+said+the+year%27s+sales+catalog#v=onepage&q=They%20were%20no%20longer%20called%20Chevelles.%20\u201cThe%201978%20Malibu%20from%20Chevrolet\u201d%20said%20the%20year's%20sales%20catalog&f=false |quote=They were no longer called Chevelles.

coupes, and [[convertible]]s, four-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedans]], and four-door [[station wagon]]s were offered throughout the entire run. This also included a coupe utility (El Camino) which was a derivative of the two-door wagon. In line with other Chevrolet series, the two-door hardtops were called Sport [[coupe]]s. Four-door hardtops, dubbed Sport Sedans, were available (1966 through 1972).  A two-door station wagon was available in 1964 and 1965 in the base 300 series. Station wagons were marketed with exclusive nameplates: Greenbrier (previously used with the [[Chevrolet Corvair|Corvair]] based vans), Concours, and Concours Estate. Six-cylinder and V8 power was offered across the board. Chevelles were also assembled and sold in Canada. While similar to their stateside counterparts, the convertible was available in the base Chevelle series, a model never offered in the United States. The Chevelle was the basis for the [[Beaumont (automobile)|Beaumont]], a retrimmed model sold only in [[Canada]] by [[Pontiac]] dealers through 1969. Originally conceived as an upsizing of the [[Chevy II]] with a unibody platform (similar to the Fairlane and the full-size Chrysler B-platform of the same era) which originated with the XP-726 program, GM's \"senior compact\" A-platform used a body-on-frame construction using a suspension setup similar to its full sized automobiles with a four-link rear suspension (the differential has four control arms which are attached to the frame with rear coil springs sandwiched between the differential and spring pocket\u2014this design was used with the B platform vehicles and later used by Ford Motor Company with its FOX platform automobiles).\n\n====Chevelle SS====\n[[File:1965 Chevelle Malibu SS396.jpg|thumb|left|1965 Chevelle Malibu SS396 Hardtop Coupe]]\n\nThe Chevelle Super Sport, or [[Super Sport (Chevrolet)|SS]], represented Chevrolet's entry into the [[muscle car]] battle. Early 1964 and 1965 Chevelles had a Malibu SS badge on the rear quarter panel. Chevelles with the mid-1965 Z16 option, priced at US$1,501 in 1965,<ref>Flory, J. \"Kelly\", Jr. ''American Cars 1960\u20131972'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Coy, 2004), p. 354.</ref> had the emblem on the front fender as well as distinct in-house style numbers: 737 for the hardtop and 767 for the convertible.<ref>All Chevelles were 13000 series. Flory, p. 356.</ref> \nThe $162 Super Sport package was available on the upscale Malibu two-door hardtop and convertible models; the option added special exterior brightwork with SS emblems and the 14-inch full-disc wheel covers from the [[Chevrolet Impala#Impala SS (1961\u20131969)|Impala SS]]. Inside, the vinyl bucket-seat interior featured a floor console for models equipped with the optional Muncie aluminum four-speed-manual or Powerglide two-speed automatic instead of the standard three-speed manual. Malibu SS also came with a four-gauge cluster in place of engine warning lights, and a dash-mounted tachometer was optional.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---May/1965-Chevrolet-Chevelle-Owners-Guide/1965-Chevrolet-Chevelle-Manual-11 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518081345/http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---May/1965-Chevrolet-Chevelle-Owners-Guide/1965-Chevrolet-Chevelle-Manual-11 |archivedate=2015-05-18 }}</ref> The available 283-cubic-inch four-barrel V8 engine was rated at 220 horsepower, the same rating as the [[1957 Chevrolet]] Power-Pak 283 engine.\n\nStarting in mid-1964, the Chevelle could be ordered with the division\u2019s 327-cubic-inch V8, in either 250 or {{convert|300|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Both used a four-barrel carburetor and 10.5:1 compression. For 1965, Chevrolet also added the 350-hp 327 V8 as Regular Production Option (RPO) L79. \nA total of 294,160 Chevelles were built the first year, including 76,860 SS models.<ref>The Editors of Consumer Reports</ref> After 1965, the Malibu SS badge disappeared except for those sold in Canada. A limited 201 Malibu SS396 'Z-16' [[big-block]]-equipped cars were also eventually produced starting in late 1965, with most being built between mid-March and mid-April.\n[[File:66 Chevelle Malibu SS396.jpg|thumb|left|1966 Chevelle Malibu Convertible]]\nThe Chevelle SS396 became a series of its own in 1966 with series/style numbers 13817 and 13867.\nSS396 sport coupes and convertibles used the same Malibu sport coupe and convertible bodies with reinforced frames and revised front suspension: higher-rate springs, recalibrated shocks, and thicker front stabilizer bar, but with different exterior trim. They also had simulated hood scoops, red-stripe tires, and bright trim moldings. The performance engines available included three, 396 CID V8s \u2013 the standard, rated at {{convert|325|hp|abbr=on}}, an optional {{convert|360|hp|abbr=on}}, and an optional {{convert|375|hp|abbr=on}}, respectively (the mid-horsepower 396 was rated at {{convert|360|hp|abbr=on}} for 1966 only and {{convert|350|hp|abbr=on}} thereafter). The SS396 series lasted from 1966 through 1968 before being relegated to an option package in 1969. The 1966 and 1967 model years were the only two years of the 'strut back' 2-door sport coupe with its own style number, 17.<ref name=\"Flory, p.434\">Flory, p.434.</ref>\n\nIn Canada, sporty Chevelles continued to wear \"Malibu SS\" badges for the 1966 and early 1967 model years. These Chevelles were available with the same equipment as non-SS Malibu models in the U.S., and did not get the domed hood or the blackout front and rear treatment.  Redline tires were not available on Canadian Chevelles in 1966.  A 1966 Malibu SS factory photo shows wheel covers on the car from the 1965 Impala.  The Canadian Malibu SS got its \"SS\" name from the \"Sports Option\" package under RPO A51 and was primarily a trim option.  This A51 option came with bucket seats, a center console (except when the three-speed manual transmission was ordered), standard full wheel covers, and the ribbed rocker panel moldings.  The \"Malibu SS\" emblems were carried over from the 1965 Malibu SS series.  This Canadian option could be ordered with any six-cylinder or V8 engine available at the time. Starting in January 1967, the Chevelle SS396 took over and became its own 138xx series, the same as in the U.S. Produced at the Oshawa, Ontario production facility, only 867 SS396 models were produced during 1967.\n\n=====Z16 SS396=====\nOnly 200 regular production 1965 Z16 Chevelles were built at the Kansas City plant. The Z16 option included the convertible boxed frame, a narrowed rear axle and brake assemblies from the contemporary Impala, heavy-duty suspension, plus virtually all Chevelle comfort and convenience options.  The Z16 standard big-block 396 Turbo-Jet [[V8 engine|V8]] (fitted with hydraulic lifters instead of the solid lifters of the same motor used in the Corvette) came only with the Muncie wide-ratio four-speed manual transmission.  The rear panel of the Z16 had unique black and chrome trim which framed untrimmed Chevelle 300-style taillights (Malibu and Malibu SS models had bright silver-painted lens trim).\n\nThe prototype Z16 Chevelle was built at the Baltimore plant. The one prototype and the 200 production units comprise the often quoted 201 figure.  One convertible was reportedly specially built for Chevy General Manager Semon \"Bunkie\" Knudsen, but is understood to have been destroyed. Approximately 75 Z16s are presently accounted for.<ref>http://www.z16chevelle.com/Z16%20Registry.htm</ref>\n\n====New Body 1966\u20131967====\n1966 saw a complete restyle of the Chevelle on the previous frame that included smooth contours, a broad new grille and bumper treatment, and curved side windows. Bulging rear fender lines and a \"flying buttress\" roofline (tunneled into the \"C\" pillar) were highlights of the '66 hardtops, shared with other GM \"A\" body models. The new body reflected the \"Coke bottle\" body shape that became the fad for American cars in the mid-1960s.  A 4-door hardtop-styled Sport Sedan joined the Malibu series. It was an attractive car and was offered through 1972, but never achieved the high-production figures as the pillared sedan.  Chevelles continued in 300, 300 Deluxe, and Malibu trim. Available engines were a 327-cubic-inch V8 instead of either of the sixes, or the mid-level option, a 220-horsepower 283-cubic-inch V8. Options included a tachometer, mag-style wheel covers, and sintered-metallic brakes, four-way power seats, a tissue dispenser, and cruise control.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1966_Chevrolet/1966_Chevrolet_Chevelle_Brochure/1966%20Chevrolet%20Chevelle-14.html|title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1966_Chevrolet/1966_Chevrolet_Chevelle_Brochure|work=oldcarbrochures.com}}</ref>\n[[File:1967 Chevrolet Chevelle 300 Deluxe V8 4-dr, front left.jpg|thumb|left|1967 Chevelle 300 Deluxe V8 four-door sedan]]\n\nThe 1967 models received a facelift. Large wraparound taillamps went into a new rear end with standard backup lights. \"What you'll see inside,\" claimed the sales brochure for the 1967 Chevelle, \"will probably bring on a severe compulsion to go driving.\" Front disc brakes were available on all models, and a new dual master cylinder brake system incorporated a warning light.  Chevrolet also added 14\" wheels and a three speed automatic transmission to their line of transmissions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldride.com/library/1967_chevrolet_chevelle.html|title=1967 CHEVROLET CHEVELLE Information Specifications Resources Pictures|work=oldride.com}}</ref> New safety equipment became standard, including a collapsible steering column.<ref>1967 Chevelle brochure</ref> The SS396 continued as its own series with both sport coupe and convertible body styles. The 375-horsepower 396-cubic-inch V8 was dropped from the options list until late in the model year and returned with 612 being sold. Seven transmissions were available: two manual three-speeds, two manual four-speeds, an overdrive three-speed, and two automatics. The manual-shift feature of the Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission was featured. Options included Superlift air shock absorbers, Strato-ease headrests, and special instrumentation.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Second generation (1968\u20131972)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name           = Second-generation\n| image          = 1968 Chevelle SS396.jpg \n| caption        = 1968 Chevrolet Chevelle SS396 Hardtop Coupe \n| assembly       = [[Arlington, Texas]] (commenced 1970 model year), United States<br />[[Lakewood Assembly]], [[Atlanta, Georgia]], United States<br />[[Baltimore, Maryland]], United States<br />[[Flint, Michigan]], United States<br />[[Framingham, Massachusetts]], United States<br />[[Fremont, California]], United States<br />[[Kansas City, Kansas]], United States<br />[[Van Nuys, California]], United States<br />[[Oshawa, Ontario]], Canada<br />[[Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, Quebec]], Canada <br />[[Caracas, Venezuela]] <br />[[Antwerp, Belgium]], [[Europe]]\n| model_years    = 1968\u20131972\n| production     = 1967\u20131972\n| engine         = {{convert|230|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#230|Chevrolet]]'' [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br />{{convert|250|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#250|Chevrolet]]'' I6<br />{{convert|307|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Chevrolet small-block engine#307|Small-Block]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]<br />{{convert|327|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Chevrolet small-block engine#327|Small-Block]]'' V8<br />{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Chevrolet small-block engine#350|Small-Block]]'' V8<br />{{convert|396|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#396 and 402|Big-Block]]'' V8<br />{{convert|400|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Chevrolet small-block engine#400|Small-Block]]'' V8<br />{{convert|402|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#396 and 402|Big-Block]]'' V8<br />{{convert|427|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#427|Big-Block]]'' V8<br />{{convert|454|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#454|Big-Block]]'' V8\n| transmission    = 3-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]<br />4-speed manual<br />2-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />3-speed automatic\n| wheelbase      = {{convert|112|in|0|abbr=on}} Coupe<ref>https://www.gmheritagecenter.com/docs/gm-heritage-archive/vehicle-information-kits/Chevelle/1968-Chevrolet-Chevelle.pdf</ref><br />{{convert|116|in|0|abbr=on}} Sedan/Wagon\n| length = {{convert|201.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (sedan)<br /> {{convert|206.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (wagon)<br /> {{convert|197.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (coupe)\n| width = {{convert|75.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|53.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (sedan)<br /> {{convert|55.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (wagon)<br /> {{convert|52.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (coupe)\n| weight         = {{convert|3520|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} \n| related        = [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]]<br /> [[Pontiac Tempest]]<br />[[Pontiac Le Mans]], [[Buick Special]], [[Buick Skylark]], [[Oldsmobile F-85]]<br />[[Oldsmobile Cutlass]]<br />[[Acadian (automobile)|Acadian Beaumont]], [[Beaumont (automobile)|Beaumont]], [[Chevrolet El Camino]], [[GMC Sprint]]<br />[[Chevrolet Opala]]<br />[[Holden Kingswood|Holden Kingswood 2-nd generation]]\n| aka             = [[Chevrolet Malibu]]\n| body_style     = 2-door [[hardtop]]<br />2-door [[coupe]]<br />2-door [[convertible]] <br />2-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] <br />4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br />4-door [[hardtop]]<br />4-door [[station wagon]]<br />2-door [[coup\u00e9 utility]]\n}}\n\n===Overview===\n\nThe 1968 Chevelle received an all-new distinctly sculpted body with tapered front fenders and a rounded beltline. The car adopted a long-hood/short-deck profile with a high rear-quarter \"kick-up\". While all 1967 Chevelle models rode a {{Convert|115|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase, the 1968 coupes and convertibles now rode a {{convert|112|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase. The sedans and wagons turned to a {{convert|116|in|mm|adj=on}} span. Tread width grew an inch front and rear. Hardtop coupes featured a semi-fastback, flowing roofline (with a long hood and short deck, mimicking the Camaro (which itself was an answer to the Ford Mustang). Top-trim models (including the SS 396 and new luxury Concours) featured GM's new Hide-A-Way wiper system. Lesser Chevelles would get that change later.\n\nThe entry level Chevelle 300 (131 - 132 VIN prefix) was available as a pillared coupe and/or station wagon (Nomad) while the 300 Deluxe and Nomad Custom (133 or 134 VIN prefix) had a 2-door hardtop added to the lineup (fourth and fifth VIN characters will be 37; with the previous 300 Deluxe the hardtop was available with the Malibu and SS396 but not the base 300/Deluxe in the USA not counting those produced for the Canadian market). The Super Sport (SS396 sport coupe, convertible, and El Camino pickup) became series on its own. Chevrolet produced 60,499 SS 396 sport coupes, 2,286 convertibles, and 5,190 El Caminos; 1968 was the only year the El Camino body style would get its own SS396 series designation (13880).<ref>{{cite web |title=Vehicle Profile: 1968 Chevrolet Chevelle |url=https://journal.classiccars.com/2013/07/01/1968-chevrolet-chevelle/ |website=The ClassicCars.com Journal |accessdate=8 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nGovernment-mandated side marker lighting was incorporated, with early 1968 SS 396 light bezels seen with the SS 396 nomenclature - at some point in the later production cycle the engine callout had a 396 also shared with the Chevy II Nova SS (the side marker bezels, also sourced from the Chevy II Nova in 307, 327, and 396 displacements) had the engine displacement except for the six cylinder models). Black-accented Super Sports had F70x14 red-stripe tires and a standard 325-horsepower 396-cubic-inch Turbo-Jet V8 engine with the special twin-domed hood; 350 and 375-horsepower 396 engines were optional. The SS 396 sport coupe started at $2,899 - or $236 more than a comparable Malibu with its 307-cubic-inch V8. All-vinyl bucket seats and a console were optional.  Three luxury Concours options became available in March 1968 for the 4-door sedan, the 4-door sport sedan (and the hardtop coupe) and consisted of special sound insulation, and a deep-padded instrument panel with [[Woodie (car body style)#Simulated woodgrain|simulated woodgrain]] accents and all-vinyl color-keyed interiors. Interiors were sourced and shared with select Buick, Oldsmobile, or Pontiac A body patterns - during the middle of the 1968 model year, some Chevrolet A-bodies (including the El Camino) ended up with interior door panels shared with the Buick or Oldsmobile A bodies (Special, Skylark) where supply and demand issues forced a substitution, and during the April 1968 production month in the wake of the [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassination of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]] there were some work stoppages e.g. strikes. A ribbed stainless steel panel was bolted to the rear taillight panel and a 'Concours By Chevrolet' emblem on the rear decklid. Other options included power windows and door locks. With the hardtop a rare option is a horseshoe floor shifter with integrated console (with bucket seats - sourced from the SS). These Concours options (ZK5, ZK6, and ZK7) should not be confused with the two Concours station wagons. At the time the ZK5, ZK6, and ZK7 Concours package was the equivalent of the Caprice. Also new for 1968 was the elimination of the term \"sedan\" for the 2-door pillar body style.  This was now called a coupe (or pillar coupe) while the 2-door hardtop remained a sport coupe.  These coupe/sport coupe designations would continue into 1969 as well.\n\nThe Concours Estate Wagon was one of four distinct Chevelle wagon models. A one-year [[Chevrolet Nomad|Nomad]], Nomad Custom was offered.\n\nRegular Chevelle engines started with a {{convert|140|hp}} Turbo-Thrift six or the new {{convert|200|hp}} Turbo-Fire 307 V8, and a {{convert|325|hp}} version of the 327-cubic-inch V8. Manual transmission cars got GM's \"Air Injection Reactor (A.I.R)\" smog pump. New Federal safety-mandated equipment included side marker lights, as well as shoulder belts for outboard front seat occupants on cars built after December 1, 1967.\n\n===Design Changes 1969\u20131972===\n[[File:69 Chevelle SS396.jpg|thumb|left|1969 Chevelle SS396 Hardtop Coupe]]\n'''1969''' Chevelles were billed as \"America's most popular mid-size car.\" They showed only minor changes for 1969, led by revised front-end styling. A single chrome bar connected quad headlights (which became a familiar Chevrolet trademark) with a revised front grille, now cast in ABS plastic, and a slotted bumper held the parking lights. Taillight lenses were larger and more vertical, flowing into the quarter panels. Smaller side marker lighting bezels were phased in (shared with the Camaro and using the lens assembly as the previous year). Front vent windows (hardtop and convertibles only) began to fade away now that Astro Ventilation (first introduced on the 1966 Buick Riviera which was used a year earlier on the Camaro and Caprice) was sending outside air into several Chevelle models. The Chevelle lineup slimmed down to Nomad, 300 Deluxe/Greenbrier, Malibu/Concours, and Concours Estate series, and the base 300 series was history.  No longer a series of its own, the SS 396 turned into a $347.60 option package for any two-door model. That meant not just a convertible, sport coupe, or pickup, but even the pillared coupe and sport coupe in the lower-rent 300 Deluxe series (except the base 300 Deluxe El Camino pickup).  Fewer SS396-optioned 300 Deluxe coupes and sport coupes were built than their Malibu counterparts and they are solid gold for collectors. The Super Sport option included a 325-horsepower 396-cubic-inch V8 beneath a double-domed hood, along with a black-out grille displaying an SS emblem and a black rear panel. More potent editions of the 396 engine also made the options list, developing 350 or {{convert|375|hp}}. SS396s produced from this point on shared the same VIN prefix with the Malibu sport coupe (136), with the exception of the 300 Deluxe based SS396s using (134), where the original buildsheet and/or Protect-O-Plate (which is an aluminum tag included with the original sales invoice from Chevrolet dealers) can ID a genuine SS (especially for a numbers matching original which is unaltered); however, the VIN number alone cannot ID a genuine SS as in previous years. Around an estimated 323 Chevelle 2-door hardtops were fitted with an [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#427|L72 {{convert|427|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}]] rated at {{convert|425|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,800 rpm and {{convert|460|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 4,000 rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]], where some Chevrolet dealers used the Central Office Production Order (this also included some Camaros and Novas of the same model year) - some COPOs were sold through select Chevrolet dealerships and out of the 323 COPO orders, a confirmed 99 were sold through the Yenko Chevrolet dealership in Canonsburg, PA. During the 1969 model year a police package (RPO B07) was available on the Chevelle 300 Deluxe 4-door sedan where some were optioned with the RPO L35 (396) motor along with a boxed frame (also shared with fleet orders e.g. taxicabs and rental cars); at the time the police option was reintroduced since the 1964/65 model years (at the time midsize squads came with economy powertrain usually in the case of the Chevelle a third generation Chevrolet inline six. The 300 Deluxe squads was not a sales success since the market was dominated by rival manufacturer Chrysler Corporation where its B platform (and its full sized sedans) outsold its competitors. Chevelle station wagons came in three levels: Concours, Nomad, and Greenbrier\u2014the last a badge formerly used on the Corvair van. A new dual-action tailgate operated either in the traditional manner or as a panel-type door. Wagons stretched {{Convert|208|in|mm}} overall versus {{Convert|197|in|mm}} for coupes. Also the Concours option package (ZK5, ZK6, and ZK7) from the previous year was continued. \nNew round instrument pods replaced the former linear layout. Chevelle options included headlight washers, power windows and locks, and a rear defroster. Chevy's midsize production rose this year. About seven percent of all Malibus had a six-cylinder engine, while about 86,000 came with the SS 396 option. All 1969 Chevelles had a new locking steering column one year ahead of the Federal requirement,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FyoDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA70&dq=popular+science+1930&hl=en&ei=RJLlTt-gB8edgweY-smBBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDMQ6AEwADhu#v=onepage&q&f=true \"The Popular Science Anti-Car-Theft Device Competition\"] ''Popular Science\", July 1969, p.70.</ref> and headrests required for all cars sold in the U.S. after January 1, 1969.\n\nIn 1969 Chevrolet developed a [[Steam car#Modern steam cars|steam powered concept vehicle]], designated the '''SE 124''' based on a Chevelle fitted it with a 50&nbsp;hp [[Doble steam car#Bresler Brothers|Bresler]] steam engine in place of its gasoline engine.

The 1970 Chevelle shared many sheet metal body parts with the 1970 Buick Skylark GSX, both are GM automobiles and have interchangeable sheet metal. They are  also the only two muscle cars to share the same roofline. The 1970 Chevelle came in Sport Coupe, Sport Sedan, convertible, four-door sedan, a couple of wagons, and [[coup\u00e9 utility]] (the El Camino) body styles.  Only three of these (Malibu sport coupe, Malibu convertible and El Camino pickup) were available with a choice of one of two SS options; RPO Z25 with the SS 396 (402 cid) engine and RPO Z15 with the new 454 cid engine.  The base model was now simply called Chevelle in lieu of the former base 300 Deluxe, and was only available as a Sport Coupe or four-door sedan. In Canada, the base series retained its 300 Deluxe name, with appropriate badging on each front fender just behind the front wheel well. The 300 Deluxe 2-door sedan was cancelled and replaced by the base Chevelle Sport Coupe, a 2 door pillarless hardtop.  The hardtop, convertible, and sedan received the upgraded sheetmetal but the station wagons and El Camino retained the previous year sheetmetal panels (which went on for the next 2 model years). Station wagons were the entry level Nomad, the Chevelle level Greenbrier, the Malibu level Concours and an upscale Concours Estate. New options included power door locks and a stalk-mounted wiper control. Production was expanded to the [[Arlington Assembly|GM Arlington Assembly]] plant in Arlington, Texas (where the Chevelle was assembled with its corporate siblings in this case the Oldsmobile Cutlass).\n[[File:1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS454 (15748244098).jpg|thumb|right|1970 Chevelle SS 454]]\n[[File:1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS (21443537054).jpg|thumb|left|1970 Chevelle SS]]\nEngine choices ranged from the standard {{convert|155|hp}} six-cylinder and 200-horsepower 307-cubic-inch V8, to a pair of 350 V8s and a pair of 402 engines. RPO Z25 SS equipment option included one of these 402 cid engines but was still marketed as a 396.  The second 402 cid engine was available under RPO, rated at 330&nbsp;hp with single exhaust, and was available in any V8 series except an SS optioned Malibu or El Camino. 1970 also saw the introduction of the 454 cid engine and was only available with the RPO Z15 SS Equipment option. The base [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#454|{{convert|454|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engine]] was rated at {{convert|360|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}}, which was also available with cowl induction; and the optional LS6 version equipped with a single 4-barrel 800 [[Cubic foot#Cubic foot per minute|CFM]] [[Holley Performance Products|Holley]] [[carburetor]] produced {{convert|450|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5600 rpm and {{convert|500|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3600 rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supercars.net/blog/1964\u21921972-chevrolet-chevelle-ss454/|website=supercars.net|title=1964\u21921972 Chevrolet Chevelle SS 454|accessdate=July 5, 2018|editor=Nick D. |date=March 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://heacockclassic.com/articles/the-best-muscle-car-1970-ls6-chevelle/|website=heacockclassic.com|title=The 1970 LS6 Chevelle Was America\u2019s King Of The Streets|accessdate=July 5, 2018|editor=Paul Zazarine |date=November 14, 2014}}</ref> There were 4,475 LS6 Chevelles produced. \n[[File:70 Chevelle SS396.jpg|thumb|left|1970 Chevelle SS396 Hardtop Coupe]]\n[[File:1970 red Chevrolet Chevelle SS side.JPG|thumb|right|1970 Chevelle SS]]\nThe SS 396 Chevelle included a {{convert|350|hp}} Turbo-Jet 396 V8, special suspension, \"power dome\" hood, black-accented grille, resilient rear-bumper insert, and wide-oval tires on sport wheels. Though a {{convert|375|hp}} cowl induction version was available, few were sold in favor of the newly introduced 454 engine during late-1969 timeframe. The LS5 454-cubic-inch V8 produced {{convert|360|hp}} in standard form and a cowl induction version was also available. The LS6 produced a claimed 450 gross HP in solid-lifter, high-compression guise.\n\n\"You can make our tough one even tougher,\" the brochure explained, by adding Cowl Induction to either the SS 396 or the SS 454. Step on the gas, and a scoop opened \"to shoot an extra breath of cool air into the engine air intake....like second wind to a distance runner.\" Neither functional hood lock pins nor hood and deck stripes were standard with either SS option, but were part of the optional ZL2 cowl induction hood option. The {{convert|454|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} LS5 [[V8 engine|V8]] was rated at {{convert|360|hp|abbr=on}}.\n\n===New design for 1971===\n[[File:2019 Food & Shelter Car Show 06 (1971 Chevrolet Chevelle SS).jpg|thumb|1971 Chevrolet Chevelle SS]]\n\nThe '''1971''' Chevelles were treated to new front-end and rear-end styling that included large Power-Beam single-unit headlights, a reworked grille and bumper, and integral park/signal/marker lights. The grille was widened and featured a bright horizontal bar that divided it into two sections.  At the center of this bar was a large Chevy bowtie for Malibus, or a large \"SS\" emblem for the SS models.  The grille on the Super Sport was painted flat black, other models got a silver finished grille.  Base Chevelles got a thinner, plain bar with no ornamentation.  A small \"Chevelle\" nameplate was located in the lower left corner of the grille.  New dual round taillights were integral with the back bumper. Because SS models suffered heavy insurance surcharges, Chevrolet introduced the \"Heavy Chevy\" at midyear, which was based on the base Chevelle, and was available with any V8 engine except the 454, which was exclusive to SS models. The Heavy Chevy (RPO YF3) was only available with the base Chevelle sport coupe (13437) and was primarily a dress up option and even it was limited to options available on the standard Chevelle sport coupe; vinyl carpeting, front bench seat, no center console shift, etc.\n\nChevrolet specifications for 1971 included both \"gross\" and \"net\" horsepower figures for all engines. The standard Chevelle SS engine was a two-barrel 350-cubic-inch V8 rated at 245 gross (165 net) horsepower. Optional was a four-barrel carbureted version of the 350 V8 rated at 275 gross (200 net with dual exhaust and 175 net with single exhaust) horsepower. The 402 cid big-block engine continued to be optional as the SS 396 but was only available in one horsepower rating, 300 gross (260 net) horsepower, and was not available with cowl induction. The base LS5 454 V8 produced 365 gross and 285 net horsepower, but cowl induction was available that produced more power because of the air induction and louder exhaust system. The LS6 454 option, which was originally announced as a regular production option on the Chevelle SS for 1971, was dropped early in the model year and no official records indicate that any 1971 Chevelles were assembled with the LS6 engine.\n\nFor 1971, the SS option could be ordered with any optional V8 and became more of a dress-up option than a performance option. The SS option was reduced to one RPO code, RPO Z15, and was only available for the Chevelle Malibu.  This RPO code required any optional engine and transmission available in the Chevelle lineup.  Since the 307 V8 was the standard base V8 in 1971, it could not be ordered with the SS option; one had to order the LS3 402 or the LS5 454, or one of the two 350 V8 engines (L65 or L48 - which reintroduced the small block to the SS option for the first time since the 1965 model year for USA market Chevelles).\n\nGM mandated all divisions design their engines to run on lower-octane regular, low-lead or unleaded gasoline. To permit usage of the lower-octane fuels, all engines featured low compression ratios (9:1 and lower; well below the 10.25-11.25:1 range on high-performance engines of 1970 and earlier). This move reduced horsepower ratings on the big-block engines to 300 for the 402 cubic-inch V8 but the LS5 454 option got an \"advertised\" five-horsepower increase to 365.\n\nBoth 350 V8 engines, as well as the dual exhaust 402 cid V8 engine, were available without the SS option; only the LS5 454 V8 required the SS option. A single exhaust version of the 402 cid engine existed in 1970 with 330 gross hp and in 1972 with 210 net hp.  In 1971 the single exhaust version of the 402 cid engine produced 206 net hp, but only appeared in the full size Chevrolet brochure.\n\n[[File:1972 Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu.jpg|thumb|right|1972 Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu Sedan]]\n'''1972''' Chevelles featured single-unit parking/side marker lights on their front fenders, outside of a revised twin-bar grille. All Malibus had concealed wipers. The SS equipment option requirements remained the same as those in 1971, any optional V8. The 1972 Chevelle series had wide enough appeal to qualify as America's second-best-selling car. Base versions again included a four-model wagon series. Upscale versions were Malibus including the convertible models. More than 24,000 Malibu Sport Sedans were built, with a standard 307-cubic-inch V8 rated at 130 (net) horsepower. This 4-door hardtop used the same body as the 1968-71 models, and although it was attractive, it was the least popular body style in the lineup.  It was not available with the overhead-valve \"Turbo-Thrift\" six cylinder engine.  With that V8, the Malibu Sport Coupe was the top seller by far starting at $2,923. The six-cylinder version ran $90 less. Powertrain options included the 175-horsepower 350-cubic-inch V8 and 240-horsepower 402-cubic-inch (still known as a 396), as well as a 454 that produced {{convert|270|hp}} under the net rating system. Chevelles sold in California were not available with the 307 V8, but had a 350-cubic-inch engine. Through the 1970s, California cars often had different powertrains than those marketed in states with less-stringent emissions regulations.\n\nThe 1972 Chevelle SS had a top engine rated at 270 net&nbsp;hp (201&nbsp;kW) conforming with GM's decree that all engines were to be rated at their net engine ratings. All other engines on the SS roster were unchanged from 1971.  1972 was the last year for the cowl induction option for the 454 cid engine and was not even mentioned in the 1972 Chevelle brochure.\n\nChevelle wagons measured {{convert|10|in|mm}} shorter than full-size wagons and weighed about half a ton less, but sold much slower. Model-year output totaled 49,352 Chevelles and 290,008 Malibus\u2014plus 54,335 station wagons.\n\n===The Yenko Chevelles===\nRetired Corvair and Corvette [[race car]] driver [[Don Yenko]] (a Pittsburgh-area Chevrolet dealer) developed his own line of signature Chevelles, [[Chevrolet Camaro|Camaro]]s and [[Chevrolet Nova|Nova]]s, marketed as Yenko Super Cars. At the time, the largest engine being installed in Chevelle SS's was the 396 cid [[V8 engine|V8]].

Due to concern over proposed Federal rollover standards, [[convertible]] and 4-door [[hardtop]] models were discontinued, while the 2-door hardtop was replaced by a [[Pillar (car)|pillared]] coupe\u2014named \"Colonnade Hardtop\". This body style featured a semi-[[fastback]] roofline, frameless door glass and fixed, styled \"B\" pillars, structurally strong enough to contribute to occupant safety of a roll-over type accident. This move was somewhat controversial with the buying public as hardtops had been a staple of American cars for over 20 years and their presence almost taken for granted. Once the initial surprise was overcome however, the Colonnade models became a huge sales success. The Monte Carlo coupe was the biggest seller of the Chevrolet A-body line, although the bread-and-butter sedans and station wagons also sold well. Distinctive rear quarter glass on 2-door coupes and new side windows with styled center pillars were featured on 4-door models. Rear windows on coupes no longer opened. In addition to the new roofline, front and rear ends looked markedly different this year as 1973 was the year of the federally mandated {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} front bumper, adding to the car's length. Additional new body features were an acoustical double-panel roof, tighter-fitting glass and flush style outside door handles. [[Wheelbase]] dimensions were retained;  a sporty {{Convert|112|in|mm}} for coupes and {{Convert|116|in|mm}} for sedans and station wagons, but bodies were five inches (127&nbsp;mm)  longer and an inch wider with a {{Convert|1|in|mm|adj=on}} wider wheel track. The station wagon, available in 6 or 9 passenger seating, featured a new counterbalanced liftgate which allowed for easier entry and loading up to 85 cubic feet.<ref name=\"MT73\">Motor Trend 1973 Buyers Guide</ref>\n\nPlans to release the updated A-body lineup was scheduled for the 1972 model year but a strike which occurred at some GM assembly plants delayed the release for a full model year, eventually extending the lifecycle of the 1968-era generation; the redesigned A-bodies were designed in studio where it had more of a European influence - at the time of development John Z. DeLorean was the chairman at the Chevrolet division where he delayed some product releases and extending the lifecycle of some of its products; the redesigned A-bodies had some styling cues lifted from the concurrent second generation F-bodies - the front suspension was integrated into the A-body redesign with output from respective GM divisions (each division had its own sheetmetal design).\n\n1973 models also introduced molded full foam front and rear seat construction, a flow-through power ventilation system, an inside hood release, a larger 22 gallon fuel tank, and \"flush and dry\" rocker panels introduced first on the redesigned 1971 full-size Chevrolets.\nAnother structural improvement was side-impact guard beams in the doors, as required by new [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards]].<ref name=\"MT73\"/> New options included swivel bucket seats with console for coupes and Turbine I steel-backed urethane wheels. A power moonroof was an option in 1973-75.<ref>1973\u20131977 Chevrolet Chevelle brochures</ref> Interior roominess of the '73 Chevelle was improved, particularly in the rear. Headroom was up slightly and shoulder room gains were by {{Convert|1.6|in|mm}}. Rear seat legroom was up {{Convert|3.5|in|mm}} in sedans. Another was a {{convert|15.3|cuft|L|adj=on}} luggage capacity, an increase of {{convert|2.5|cuft|L}} over 1972 models. Still another benefit of the new body designs was greatly improved visibility, up 25% in coupes and wagons, and 35% in sedans. The unusually thin windshield pillars also contributed to much better visibility.\n\n===New chassis===\n\nThe [[chassis]] design was new , with a sturdier [[perimeter frame]], revised chassis/body mounts, larger 8\u00bd&nbsp;inch rear axle, wider 6-inch wheel rim width, revised rear control arm bushings, increased front and rear suspension travel, adjusted [[shock absorber]] location, and revised front suspension geometry<ref>Chevrolet engineering report-73 Chevelle</ref> - The left wheel was adjusted to have slightly more positive [[camber angle|camber]] than the right which resulted in a more uniform and stable steering feel on high-crown road surfaces while maintaining freeway stability. Clearances for spring travel were also revised; the [[coil spring]]s at each wheel were computer-selected to match the individual car's weight. Front [[disc brakes]] were now standard on all '73 Chevelles. [[John Z. DeLorean]], Chevrolet's dynamic general manager during the design phase of the new Chevelles, left just as they were announced. He departed in late September 1972 to start a brief period as vice president of General Motors's Car and Truck Group. Critics compared the GM Colonnade line favorably to Ford and Chrysler intermediates.<ref name=\"The Editors of Consumer Guide\">The Editors of Consumer Guide</ref>\n\nFive power teams were available for 1973 Chevelle models; the 250 inline-six and 307 2-barrel V8 both rated at {{Convert|110|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} were std. engines on Deluxe and Malibu. The 350 2-barrel V8 of {{Convert|145|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} was the base Laguna engine. Options for any Chevelle included a 350 4-barrel V8 of {{Convert|175|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and a 454 4-barrel V8 rated at {{Convert|245|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Hardened engine valve seats and hydraulic camshafts made these engines reliable for many miles, and allowed them to accept the increasingly popular unleaded regular gasoline. 3 speed manual transmission was standard; 4 speed manual and Turbo Hydra-Matic 3 speed automatic were optional. Crossflow radiators and coolant reservoirs that prevented air from entering the system prevented overheating.<ref name=\"73brochure\">1973 Chevrolet Chevelle Brochure</ref>\n\n===Revised model lineup===\n\n[[File:1973 Chevelle Malibu SS.jpg|thumb|left|1973 Chevelle Malibu SS Colonnade Coupe]]\n\nMalibu and the newly named Deluxe series base model featured the new {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} bumper system with a large chrome front bumper and a chrome rear bumper. Malibu series interiors included cloth and vinyl or all vinyl seat trim and deep-twist carpeting.\nDeluxe series interiors featured cloth and vinyl or knit vinyl seat trim. Floor coverings were color-keyed in vinyl-coated rubber.\nThe SS was now a trim option limited to the mid-level Malibu series. Shoppers could even get an SS station wagon this year - with the option of a 454-cubic-inch V8 engine, no less\u2014but the mix of sport and utilitarian wagon virtues would last only a single season. Included was a black grill with SS emblem, lower bodyside and wheel opening striping, bright roof drip moldings, color-keyed dual sport mirrors, black taillight bezels, SS fender and rear panel emblems, special front and rear stabilizer bars, 14x7 inch rally wheels, 70-series raised white lettered tires, special instrumentation and SS interior emblems.<ref name=\"73brochure\"/>\nThe SS option required an available 350 or 454 V8 with 4-speed or Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission.\n\nChevrolet honored [[California]] beach resorts once again by naming the top Chevelle series [[Chevrolet Chevelle Laguna|Laguna]] with the Malibu taking the middle spot while the base series was called simply Deluxe. In addition to the standard 350 2 barrel V8, Laguna models featured specific front and rear styling including a body-colored [[polyurethane|urethane]] front end concealing the new [[5 mph bumper|5&nbsp;mph bumper]] system. On minor impact the urethane nose cone, backed up by shock- absorbing cylinders, deflects and rebounds; Laguna models also featured a specific [[die casting|diecast]] chrome [[grille]] with bowtie emblem, a body-colored (steel) rear [[bumper (automobile)|bumper]], front and rear bumper rub strips, bright roof drip moldings, bright wheel opening moldings, chrome taillight bezels, full wheel covers, and Laguna fender nameplates. Two Laguna station wagons were introduced, including a Laguna [[Woodie (car body style)|Estate]]. Laguna interiors were pattern cloth and vinyl or optional breathable all-vinyl upholstery, distinctive door trim with map pockets, deep-twist carpeting, woodgrain vinyl accents, and Laguna nameplates.<ref name=\"73brochure\"/>\n\nChevelle sales remained strong: 327,631 of them in the 1973 model year, plus 59,108 station wagons. The more upmarket Malibu continued to sell best by a wide margin and many Chevelles went to the fleet market, but the costlier Laguna coupe and sedan made a respectable showing, with 56,036 going to customers. Super Sport options went on 28,647 Chevelles of which 2500 held the big 454-cubic-inch engine. The SS option was dropped at the end of the model year.<ref>Cars of the 70's - By the Editors of Consumer Guide</ref>\n\n===Changes 1974\u20131977===\n{{unreferenced-section|date=March 2020}}\n{{originalresearch-section|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[File:1974Laguna.JPG|thumb|left|1974 Chevrolet Chevelle Laguna Type S-3 Colonnade Coupe]]\nYearly design changes to the front and rear mark the aesthetic differences as in previous years. The  Chevelles were top sellers for GM as was the [[Oldsmobile Cutlass]], [[Buick Regal]], and [[Pontiac Grand Am#1973\u20131975|Pontiac Grand Am]] which used the same corporate [[GM A platform|A-body]] platform.\n\n1974 Chevelles featured new Mercedes-inspired{{says who?|date=March 2020}} chrome grilles made of die-cast steel, and single rectangular [[Automotive lighting|tail lights]] replaced the dual round items on all coupes and sedans. More massive rear [[Bumper (automobile)|bumpers]] were also added, in accordance with stricter US [[NHTSA|Federal standards]].\n\nThe Laguna, which had been Chevelle's top of the line model in 1973, now became the sporty Laguna Type S-3 and was only available solely as a coupe. It combined Laguna luxury with the upgraded handling of the SS, which it replaced. Handling was further enhanced with the addition of new GR70-15 [[radial tire]]s. The new Laguna S-3 sported the urethane front end with a revised grille and new parking lamps, and new tail lights. As on all 1974 models, a more massive rear [[Bumper (automobile)|bumper]] was installed to comply with new, stricter [[NHTSA|US Federal standards]]; those on the Laguna S-3 were chrome-plated rather than painted body color as on the 1973 car. Standard equipment included a console, a vinyl roof, opera-type vertical rear quarter windows which could be covered with horizontal ribs for a few dollars extra; body side striping, Laguna S-3 badging, rally wheels, a 4-spoke steering wheel, firmer springs and [[shock absorber]]s, a front [[anti-roll bar]], and HR70x15 radial tires on rally wheels. Interior features included swivelling front [[bucket seat]]s and a six-dial instrument cluster. Production totaled 15,792 cars, with prices starting at $3,723 - but with plenty of options to raise the price above $5,000. Engine offerings included a standard {{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} providing {{convert|145|hp}} with a 2-barrel [[carburetor], with options for a {{convert|150|hp}} 2-barrel or {{convert|180|hp}} 4-barrel {{convert|400|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, and a {{convert|230|hp}} {{convert|454|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, except in California where a {{convert|155|hp}} 350 four-barrel V8 was standard and the 400 and 454 engines were optional. The 454 was available with GM's [[Turbo Hydramatic|THM-400 automatic]] or Muncie 4-speed [[manual transmission|manual]] transmission. Unitized 3-point [[seat belt]]s were introduced as on all Chevrolet models.\n\nThe upscale luxury trim level for 1974 was the new Malibu Classic, offered in sedan, coupe, and station wagon models. Unlike the 1973 Laguna, the Malibu Classic used the same front end and chrome bumper as the lesser models, and had the smaller vertical [[opera window]]s and a spring-loaded [[hood ornament]]. Early-production 1974 Classic coupes required the vinyl roof option; apparently{{says who?|date=March 2020}} inserts were used to cover part of the big rear quarter window.{{CN|date=March 2020}} Later-built cars were available with a standard painted roof that included the smaller opera window. This configuration was continued through the end of Chevelle production in 1977. Inside, the Malibu Classic interiors had notchback bench seats{{what?|date=March 2020}} upholstered in cloth or vinyl, carpeted door panels, and simulated woodgrain instrument panel trim. Optional on Malibu Classic coupes were swivelling [[bucket seat]]s in cloth or vinyl. The base Deluxe series was dropped for 1974, making the Malibu the base model. Base engines were the {{convert|250|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[straight-six engine]] and the 350 V8.\n\n[[File:1974 Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu Estate (front).jpg|thumb|1974 Chevelle Malibu Estate]]\nFor 1975 although the basic body styling was unaltered, the \"Colonnade\" designation was dropped. Front and rear styling refreshes including a vertical grid-patterned grille and new bright trim around the headlights. Rectangular tail lights sat flush with the body surface, connected by a brushed chrome panel. Malibu Classic coupes had distinctive opera windows. Landau coupes came with a vinyl roof, full wheel covers, whitewall tires, color-keyed body striping, and dual sport mirrors. Engines ranged from the standard 250 six and 350/2-barrel V8 to options of 400 and 454-cubic-inch size, the last with a 235-horsepower rating. Variable-ratio [[power steering]] was now standard with V8 models, and all 1975 models came with steel-belted [[radial tire]]s and a [[catalytic converter]]. A new \"Chevrolet Efficiency System\" included GM's new [[High energy ignition]] (HEI) for longer tune-up intervals and more complete combustion. [[Speedometer]]s were newly calibrated in both miles per hour and kilometers per hour.\n\nFollowing its debut as a 1974 model, the sporty Laguna Type S-3 left the lineup briefly, then reappeared in January 1975 with a slanted, urethane-covered aero-style nose designed for NASCAR (first use on a Chevrolet vehicle - later to show up on the 1983-88 Monte Carlo SS), louvered quarter windows, and could be ordered with a vinyl half-roof. The 454 engine option was available for the first half of the model year after which the 400 engine became the top engine. Options included an Econominder gauge package, affirming again that the age of muscle was long gone.\n\n1976 Chevelles earned a billing{{says who?|date=March 2020}} as \"a size whose time has come.\"{{CN|date=March 2020}} The top-of-the-line Malibu Classic got a crosshatch grille flanked on each side by two stacked newly-legal [[Parabolic aluminized reflector#Automotive headlamps|rectangular sealed-beam headlamps]], while lesser models had a waterfall grille and continued with the previous single round lamps. Three V8 engines were available: a new {{convert|305|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engine rated at {{convert|140|hp}}, a {{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engine providing {{convert|165|hp}}, and a {{convert|400|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engine with {{convert|175|hp}}. Period options included an \"Econominder\" gauge package.{{vague|date=March 2020}}{{cn|date=March 2020}} In its third and final year, the 1976 Laguna Type S-3 was little changed. It again featured quarter window louvers and a sloped, body-color urethane front end. Lagunas shared their round-gauge instrument panel with the Chevrolet Monte Carlo, and could be ordered with a four-spoke sport steering wheel as well as swivel front bucket seats and a center console. Lesser models made do with a more conventional dashboard and a linear-readout speedometer. Production of the Laguna edged up to 9,100 cars as the base price went to $4,621.\n\nThe 1977 Chevelles got new grilles. The lineup consisted of Malibu and Malibu Classic models in coupe, sedan, and station wagon body styles. Estate Wagons and the Laguna Type S-3 were gone. Malibu Classics, again the top model, switched to a vertical grille pattern and six-section taillights but kept their twin stacked headlights and stand-up hood ornament. Malibu grilles changed little. Fewer engine selections were available though the engines that remained gained a few horses. In standard form, Chevelles had a {{convert|250|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} six-cylinder engine or a {{convert|145|hp}}, 305 V8. The sole option beyond that was a {{convert|170|hp}}, four-barrel 350 V8, which came as standard equipment in the Malibu Classic station wagon. Malibu Classics had a luxurious cloth/vinyl split-bench front seat, color-keyed steering wheel, and woodgrain-accented instrument panel. Malibu options included a $46 Exterior Decor group, $54 tinted glass, and $33 full wheel covers. A total of 37,215 Malibu Classic Landau coupes were produced, as opposed to 73,739 Malibu Classic coupes and 28,793 Malibu coupes. In four-door sedan form, too, the Malibu Classics outsold base models by a substantial margin.\n\nA Chevelle SE (special edition) was available and provided front and rear spoilers, turbine II wheels, F60-15 tires, special graphics and decals, quarter window trim, front and rear sway bars, sport suspension, and a deluxe interior. Three colors{{which?|date=March 2020}} were available. 50 of these cars were built. \n\n1977 models were the last ones to bear the Chevelle name; with the all-new 1978 models, Malibu became the basic name for Chevrolet's midsize cars.\n\n===Reviews===\n\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2012}}\n\n''Speed and Supercar'' magazine said in a June 1974 \"Street Test\": \"Chevy gets it right on.\" \"Enough is plenty, that's how we feel about the 350 Laguna. \"...&nbsp;We couldn't pass up the opportunity to tell you what a groovy all around car it is even if it can't smoke the quarter-mile in 13 seconds.

The [[Chevrolet Laguna|Chevelle Laguna]] in particular was extremely successful allowing [[Cale Yarborough]] to win 34 races and earn the first two of three consecutive [[Sprint Cup Series|Grand National]] championships. Considered a limited edition model by NASCAR, the Laguna S-3 was ineligible for competition following the 1977 season.\n\n{{citation needed span|''Motor Trend'' said in 1973: \"While neither Chevrolet or [[Pontiac]] are back in racing, the new crop intermediates out of GM's styling studios are curiously [[aerodynamic]].

The help of several teams allow him to get back into the race and finish 28th. Parsons and his Chevelle hold on to win the NASCAR [[Winston Cup]] Grand National championship. Parsons took the points lead with a third-place finish at [[Talladega Speedway]] in early May and never gave up the lead. He held off a late rally by Cale Yarborough to win by only 67.15 points.\n\nAugust 1976: Cale Yarborough drove his #11 Junior Johnson/Holly Farms Chevelle to the 1976 NASCAR Winston Cup Grand National championship. Yarborough won nine races along the way to the first of three consecutive titles. He finished last in the Daytona 500, but assumed command of the points chase in August.

In 2010, in conversation with journalist Jeff Baker, Ellis commented: {{quote|[Bateman] was crazy the same way [I was]. He did not come out of me sitting down and wanting to write a grand sweeping indictment of [[yuppie]] culture. It initiated because of my own isolation and alienation at a point in my life. I was living like Patrick Bateman. I was slipping into a [[consumerism|consumerist]] kind of void that was supposed to give me confidence and make me feel good about myself but just made me feel worse and worse and worse about myself. That is where the tension of ''American Psycho'' came from. It wasn't that I was going to make up this serial killer on Wall Street. [[High concept]]. Fantastic. It came from a much more personal place, and that's something that I've only been admitting in the last year or so. I was so on the defensive because of the reaction to that book that I wasn't able to talk about it on that level.<ref name=oregonlive>{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/books/index.ssf/2010/07/qa_bret_easton_ellis_talks_abo.html|title=Q&A: Bret Easton Ellis talks about writing novels, making movies|last=Baker|first=Jeff|work=OregonLive|accessdate=2010-07-09|date=July 2010}}</ref> |Bret Easton Ellis}}\n\n==Plot==\nSet in [[Manhattan]] during the [[Wall Street]] boom of the late 1980s, ''American Psycho'' follows the life of wealthy young [[investment banker]] Patrick Bateman. Bateman, in his mid-20s when the story begins, narrates his everyday activities, from his recreational life among the Wall Street elite of [[New York City|New York]] to his forays into murder by night. Through [[present tense]] [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream-of-consciousness]] narrative, Bateman describes his daily life, ranging from a series of Friday nights spent at nightclubs with his colleagues\u2014where they snort [[cocaine]], critique fellow club-goers' clothing, trade fashion advice, and question one another on proper [[etiquette]]\u2014to his loveless engagement to fellow yuppie Evelyn and his contentious relationship with his brother and senile mother. Bateman's stream of consciousness is occasionally broken up by chapters in which he directly addresses the reader in order to critique the work of 1980s [[pop music]] artists. The novel maintains a high level of ambiguity through mistaken identity and contradictions that introduce the possibility that Bateman is an [[unreliable narrator]]. Characters are consistently introduced as people other than themselves, and people argue over the identities of others they can see in restaurants or at parties. Deeply concerned with his [[vanity|personal appearance]], Bateman gives extensive descriptions of his daily aesthetics regimen.\n\nAfter killing Paul <!--DO NOT CHANGE TO ALLEN; ALLEN IS MOVIE NAME, OWEN IS BOOK NAME! -->Owen, one of his colleagues, Bateman appropriates Owen's apartment as a place to host and kill more victims. Bateman's control over his violent urges deteriorates. His murders become increasingly [[sadomasochism|sadistic]] and complex, progressing from simple stabbings to drawn-out sequences of [[rape]], [[torture]], [[mutilation]], [[cannibalism]], and [[necrophilia]], and his grasp on sanity begins to slip. He introduces stories about serial killers into casual conversations and on several occasions openly confesses his murderous activities to his coworkers, who never take him seriously, do not hear what he says, or misunderstand him completely\u2014for example, hearing the words \"murders and executions\" as \"mergers and acquisitions.\" These incidents culminate in a shooting spree during which he kills several random people in the street, resulting in a [[SWAT]] team being dispatched in a helicopter. This narrative episode sees the first-person perspective shift to third-person and the subsequent events are, although not for the first time in the novel, described in terms pertaining to cinematic portrayal. Bateman flees on foot and hides in his office, where he phones his attorney, Harold Carnes, and confesses all his crimes to an answering machine.\n\nLater, Bateman revisits Paul Owen's apartment, where he had earlier killed and mutilated two sex workers, carrying a surgical mask in anticipation of the decomposing bodies he expects to encounter. He enters the perfectly clean, refurbished apartment, however, filled with strong-smelling flowers meant, perhaps, to conceal a bad odor. The real estate agent, who sees his surgical mask, fools him into stating he was attending the apartment viewing because he \"saw an ad in the ''[[The New York Times|Times]]''\" (when in fact there was no such advertisement). She tells him to leave and never return.\n\nBateman's mental state continues to deteriorate and he begins to experience bizarre hallucinations such as seeing a [[Cheerios|Cheerio]] interviewed on a talk show, being [[stalking|stalked]] by an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] park bench, and finding a bone in his [[Dove Bar]]. At the end of the story, Bateman confronts Carnes about the message he left on his machine, only to find the attorney amused at what he considers a hilarious joke. Mistaking Bateman for another colleague, Carnes claims that the Patrick Bateman he knows is too much of a coward to have committed such acts. In the dialogue-laden climax, Carnes stands up to a defiant Bateman and tells him his claim of having murdered Owen is impossible, because he had dinner with him twice in [[London]] just a few days prior.\n\nThe book ends as it began, with Bateman and his colleagues at a new club on a Friday night, engaging in banal conversation. The sign seen at the end of the book simply reads \"This is not an exit.\"\n\n==Themes==\nAccording to literary critic Jeffrey W. Hunter, ''American Psycho ''is largely a critique of the \"shallow and vicious aspects of [[capitalism]]\".<ref>''Contemporary Literary Criticism''. Jeffrey W. Hunter (ed.). ''Vol. 229''. Detroit: Thomson Gale, 2007, pp. 228\u2013294. From ''Literature Criticism Online.''</ref> The characters are predominantly concerned with material gain and superficial appearances, traits indicative of a [[postmodern]] world in which the 'surface' reigns supreme. This leads Patrick Bateman to act as if \"everything is a [[commodity]], including people\",<ref>''Contemporary Literary Criticism''.</ref> an attitude that is further evident in the rampant objectification and brutalization of women that occurs in the novel. This distancing allows Bateman to rationalize his actions;<ref>Brock, Leigh. \"Distancing in Bret Easton Ellis' ''American Psycho''. ''Notes on Contemporary Literature'' 24, no. 1 (January 1994): 6\u20138.</ref> in one [[Cannibalism|anthropophagic]] scene, Bateman remarks \"though it does sporadically penetrate how unacceptable some of what I'm doing actually is, I just remind myself that this thing, this girl, this meat, is nothing&nbsp;...\"<ref>Ellis, Bret Easton. ''American Psycho''. New York: Vintage Books, 1991. Page 345</ref>\n\nPatrick Bateman's consumption of what he views as nothing more than a piece of meat is an almost parodically literal interpretation of a monster created by consumer culture. This, combined with sex, violence, drugs, and other desires of the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|id]], is how Bateman enacts his sociopathic violence in a superficial world.<ref>Heyler, Ruth. \"Parodied to Death: The Postmodern Gothic of ''American Psycho''\". ''Modern Fiction Studies'' 46, no. 3 (fall 2000): 725\u2013746.</ref>\n\nBateman's episodes of schizophrenia also shows clear signs on how he copes being an affluent person living in a superficial world, fashioned on [[consumerism]]. As described by the critic Jennifer Krause in her intertextual analysis of the novel, which relies on the work of postmodern theorist [[Fredric Jameson]], Jameson \"blames the schizophrenic\u2019s ills on the incoherence of postmodern media and capitalistic consumption\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Polan|first=Dana|last2=Foster|first2=Hal|date=1984|title=The Anti-Aesthetic: Essays on Postmodern Culture|journal=New German Critique|issue=33|pages=264\u2013269|doi=10.2307/488367|issn=0094-033X|jstor=488367}}</ref>\n\nJameson's critique is expanded by Krause, who writes, \"We can see a distinctly popular culture [[schizophrenia]] arise, a disease spread by the postmodern culture industry, which ruptures personality and isolates the fractured self. Though Jameson does not specifically reference two different types of schizophrenia in his writings, he implies an artistic schizophrenia versus a more popular form\u2014one more or less accepted, and the other anathema. This raises questions about how popular culture might act as a potential cure for madness.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krause|first=Jennifer|date=2016-02-16|title=The Killing Cure: Popular Culture and Postmodern Madness inOnde andar\u00e1 Dulce Veiga?andAmerican Psycho|journal=Critique: Studies in Contemporary Fiction|volume=57|issue=2|pages=166\u2013177|doi=10.1080/00111619.2015.1019409|issn=0011-1619}}</ref> On the one hand is a rich Wall Street banker, Bateman, concerned and very self-conscious about every detail of his physical appearance, expensive possessions, and control of the people and the world around him. On the other hand is the inner self of Patrick Bateman, the aboriginal-self, who copes and relinquishes his outer complications and \"fake\" identity, created by [[consumerism]], through violence on other human beings, who he finds consumable, and expresses absolute control of his desires and true self through his violent fantasies. His consumer, artificial self, proceeding in society as a wealthy consumer would live and spend his income, versus his natural self, who, instead of spending money, would hunt and prey on the weak and vulnerable, usually women, whom he deems expendable. Bateman treats the people around him just like any other consumer product, because of the void he still battles with and wishes to fulfill from within, hence, having dual personas, having the dull artificial identity, compared to his free limitless persona of his mind.\n\nObserving another side of potential behavior coming from the affluent American society of consumerism is explained through C. Serpell saying, \"Though serialized violence in ''American Psycho'' is an extension of the deadening effects of serialized consumer exchanges in an economy where commodities and bodies become interchangeable and indistinguishable, this point largely escaped the notice of the novel's harshest critics.\"<ref name=\"Serpell 47\u201373\">{{Cite journal|last=Serpell|first=C.

The critic Thomas Heise states, \"the uncertainty about the reality of Patrick\u2019s violence has become the chief critical debate on American Psycho, and it serves as a convenient introduction to the entanglement of epistemology and ethics in the novel.\" <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Heise|first=Thomas|date=2011|title=''American Psycho'': Neoliberal Fantasies and the Death of Downtown|journal=Arizona Quarterly: A Journal of American Literature, Culture, and Theory|volume=67|issue=1|pages=135\u2013160|doi=10.1353/arq.2011.0001|issn=1558-9595}}</ref> Bateman's character and traits, according to Heise, challenge what readers understand as the social norms for the way the elite upper class think and react to society on a normal basis. Bateman's epistemology and ethics in regards to his actions and way of thinking throughout the novel is a reflection, through his violence, which raises the questions of the moral and ethical understanding of all individuals in Bateman's position and status, and how they might act and think similar or completely identical in a consumer world built on [[capitalism]] as we see in today's American society.\n\nCiting the many bodies that are never found, [[Henry Bean]] wonders \"is it possible that the murders themselves never occurred?\" He continues:{{r|bean19910317}}\n\n{{quote|The novel subtly and relentlessly undercuts its own authority, and because Bateman, unlike, say, [[Vladimir Nabokov|Nabokov]]'s unreliable narrators, does not hint at a \"truth\" beyond his own delusions, \"American Psycho\" becomes a wonderfully unstable account.

His first draft of ''American Psycho'' left out all the grisly scenes, which were to be added in later. In 2010, in conversation with journalist Jeff Baker, Ellis commented: {{quote|[Bateman] was crazy the same way [I was]. He did not come out of me sitting down and wanting to write a grand sweeping indictment of [[yuppie]] culture. It initiated because of my own isolation and alienation at a point in my life. I was living like Patrick Bateman. I was slipping into a [[consumerism|consumerist]] kind of void that was supposed to give me confidence and make me feel good about myself but just made me feel worse and worse and worse about myself. That is where the tension of ''American Psycho'' came from. It wasn't that I was going to make up this serial killer on Wall Street. [[High concept]]. Fantastic. It came from a much more personal place, and that's something that I've only been admitting in the last year or so. I was so on the defensive because of the reaction to that book that I wasn't able to talk about it on that level.<ref name=oregonlive>{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/books/index.ssf/2010/07/qa_bret_easton_ellis_talks_abo.html|title=Q&A: Bret Easton Ellis talks about writing novels, making movies|last=Baker|first=Jeff|work=OregonLive|accessdate=2010-07-09|date=July 2010}}</ref> |Bret Easton Ellis}}\n\n==Plot==\nSet in [[Manhattan]] during the [[Wall Street]] boom of the late 1980s, ''American Psycho'' follows the life of wealthy young [[investment banker]] Patrick Bateman. Bateman, in his mid-20s when the story begins, narrates his everyday activities, from his recreational life among the Wall Street elite of [[New York City|New York]] to his forays into murder by night. Through [[present tense]] [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream-of-consciousness]] narrative, Bateman describes his daily life, ranging from a series of Friday nights spent at nightclubs with his colleagues\u2014where they snort [[cocaine]], critique fellow club-goers' clothing, trade fashion advice, and question one another on proper [[etiquette]]\u2014to his loveless engagement to fellow yuppie Evelyn and his contentious relationship with his brother and senile mother. Bateman's stream of consciousness is occasionally broken up by chapters in which he directly addresses the reader in order to critique the work of 1980s [[pop music]] artists. The novel maintains a high level of ambiguity through mistaken identity and contradictions that introduce the possibility that Bateman is an [[unreliable narrator]]. Characters are consistently introduced as people other than themselves, and people argue over the identities of others they can see in restaurants or at parties. Deeply concerned with his [[vanity|personal appearance]], Bateman gives extensive descriptions of his daily aesthetics regimen.\n\nAfter killing Paul <!--DO NOT CHANGE TO ALLEN; ALLEN IS MOVIE NAME, OWEN IS BOOK NAME! -->Owen, one of his colleagues, Bateman appropriates his apartment as a place to host and kill more victims. Bateman's control over his violent urges deteriorates. His murders become increasingly [[sadomasochism|sadistic]] and complex, progressing from simple stabbings to drawn-out sequences of [[rape]], [[torture]], [[mutilation]], [[cannibalism]], and [[necrophilia]], and his grasp on sanity begins to slip. He introduces stories about serial killers into casual conversations and on several occasions openly confesses his murderous activities to his coworkers, who never take him seriously, do not hear what he says, or misunderstand him completely\u2014for example, hearing the words \"murders and executions\" as \"mergers and acquisitions.\" These incidents culminate in a shooting spree during which he kills several random people in the street, resulting in a [[SWAT]] team being dispatched in a helicopter. This narrative episode sees the first-person perspective shift to third-person and the subsequent events are, although not for the first time in the novel, described in terms pertaining to cinematic portrayal. Bateman flees on foot and hides in his office, where he phones his attorney, Harold Carnes, and confesses all his crimes to an answering machine.\n\nLater, Bateman revisits Paul Owen's apartment, where he had earlier killed and mutilated two sex workers, carrying a surgical mask in anticipation of the decomposing bodies he expects to encounter. He enters the perfectly clean, refurbished apartment, however, filled with strong-smelling flowers meant, perhaps, to conceal a bad odor. The real estate agent, who sees his surgical mask, fools him into stating he was attending the apartment viewing because he \"saw an ad in the ''[[The New York Times|Times]]''\" (when in fact there was no such advertisement). She tells him to leave and never return.\n\nBateman's mental state continues to deteriorate and he begins to experience bizarre hallucinations such as seeing a [[Cheerios|Cheerio]] interviewed on a talk show, being [[stalking|stalked]] by an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] park bench, and finding a bone in his [[Dove Bar]]. At the end of the story, Bateman confronts Carnes about the message he left on his machine, only to find the attorney amused at what he considers a hilarious joke. Mistaking Bateman for another colleague, Carnes claims that the Patrick Bateman he knows is too much of a coward to have committed such acts. In the dialogue-laden climax, Carnes stands up to a defiant Bateman and tells him his claim of having murdered Owen is impossible, because he had dinner with him twice in [[London]] just a few days prior.\n\nThe book ends as it began, with Bateman and his colleagues at a new club on a Friday night, engaging in banal conversation. The sign seen at the end of the book simply reads \"This is not an exit.\"\n\n==Themes==\nAccording to literary critic Jeffrey W. Hunter, ''American Psycho ''is largely a critique of the \"shallow and vicious aspects of [[capitalism]]\".<ref>''Contemporary Literary Criticism''. Jeffrey W. Hunter (ed.). ''Vol. 229''. Detroit: Thomson Gale, 2007, pp. 228\u2013294. From ''Literature Criticism Online.''</ref> The characters are predominantly concerned with material gain and superficial appearances, traits indicative of a [[postmodern]] world in which the 'surface' reigns supreme. This leads Patrick Bateman to act as if \"everything is a [[commodity]], including people\",<ref>''Contemporary Literary Criticism''.</ref> an attitude that is further evident in the rampant objectification and brutalization of women that occurs in the novel. This distancing allows Bateman to rationalize his actions;<ref>Brock, Leigh. \"Distancing in Bret Easton Ellis' ''American Psycho''. ''Notes on Contemporary Literature'' 24, no. 1 (January 1994): 6\u20138.</ref> in one [[Cannibalism|anthropophagic]] scene, Bateman remarks \"though it does sporadically penetrate how unacceptable some of what I'm doing actually is, I just remind myself that this thing, this girl, this meat, is nothing&nbsp;...\"<ref>Ellis, Bret Easton. ''American Psycho''. New York: Vintage Books, 1991. Page 345</ref>\n\nPatrick Bateman's consumption of what he views as nothing more than a piece of meat is an almost parodically literal interpretation of a monster created by consumer culture. This, combined with sex, violence, drugs, and other desires of the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|id]], is how Bateman enacts his sociopathic violence in a superficial world.<ref>Heyler, Ruth. \"Parodied to Death: The Postmodern Gothic of ''American Psycho''\". ''Modern Fiction Studies'' 46, no. 3 (fall 2000): 725\u2013746.</ref>\n\nBateman's episodes of schizophrenia also shows clear signs on how he copes being an affluent person living in a superficial world, fashioned on [[consumerism]]. As described by the critic Jennifer Krause in her intertextual analysis of the novel, which relies on the work of postmodern theorist [[Fredric Jameson]], Jameson \"blames the schizophrenic\u2019s ills on the incoherence of postmodern media and capitalistic consumption\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Polan|first=Dana|last2=Foster|first2=Hal|date=1984|title=The Anti-Aesthetic: Essays on Postmodern Culture|journal=New German Critique|issue=33|pages=264\u2013269|doi=10.2307/488367|issn=0094-033X|jstor=488367}}</ref>\n\nJameson's critique is expanded by Krause, who writes, \"We can see a distinctly popular culture [[schizophrenia]] arise, a disease spread by the postmodern culture industry, which ruptures personality and isolates the fractured self. Though Jameson does not specifically reference two different types of schizophrenia in his writings, he implies an artistic schizophrenia versus a more popular form\u2014one more or less accepted, and the other anathema. This raises questions about how popular culture might act as a potential cure for madness.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krause|first=Jennifer|date=2016-02-16|title=The Killing Cure: Popular Culture and Postmodern Madness inOnde andar\u00e1 Dulce Veiga?andAmerican Psycho|journal=Critique: Studies in Contemporary Fiction|volume=57|issue=2|pages=166\u2013177|doi=10.1080/00111619.2015.1019409|issn=0011-1619}}</ref> On the one hand is a rich Wall Street banker, Bateman, concerned and very self-conscious about every detail of his physical appearance, expensive possessions, and control of the people and the world around him. On the other hand is the inner self of Patrick Bateman, the aboriginal-self, who copes and relinquishes his outer complications and \"fake\" identity, created by [[consumerism]], through violence on other human beings, who he finds consumable, and expresses absolute control of his desires and true self through his violent fantasies. His consumer, artificial self, proceeding in society as a wealthy consumer would live and spend his income, versus his natural self, who, instead of spending money, would hunt and prey on the weak and vulnerable, usually women, whom he deems expendable. Bateman treats the people around him just like any other consumer product, because of the void he still battles with and wishes to fulfill from within, hence, having dual personas, having the dull artificial identity, compared to his free limitless persona of his mind.\n\nObserving another side of potential behavior coming from the affluent American society of consumerism is explained through C. Serpell saying, \"Though serialized violence in ''American Psycho'' is an extension of the deadening effects of serialized consumer exchanges in an economy where commodities and bodies become interchangeable and indistinguishable, this point largely escaped the notice of the novel's harshest critics.\"<ref name=\"Serpell 47\u201373\">{{Cite journal|last=Serpell|first=C.

Serpell bringing to light the patterns and trends Ellis expresses through Bateman, what the consequences of how \"serialized consumer exchanges in an economy where commodities and bodies become interchangeable and indistinguishable,\"<ref name=\"Serpell 47\u201373\"/> could affect society, and the way affluent people view others whether they are higher, lower, or the same in wealth or social status. The critic Thomas Heise states, \"the uncertainty about the reality of Patrick\u2019s violence has become the chief critical debate on American Psycho, and it serves as a convenient introduction to the entanglement of epistemology and ethics in the novel.\" <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Heise|first=Thomas|date=2011|title=''American Psycho'': Neoliberal Fantasies and the Death of Downtown|journal=Arizona Quarterly: A Journal of American Literature, Culture, and Theory|volume=67|issue=1|pages=135\u2013160|doi=10.1353/arq.2011.0001|issn=1558-9595}}</ref> Bateman's character and traits, according to Heise, challenge what readers understand as the social norms for the way the elite upper class think and react to society on a normal basis. Bateman's epistemology and ethics in regards to his actions and way of thinking throughout the novel is a reflection, through his violence, which raises the questions of the moral and ethical understanding of all individuals in Bateman's position and status, and how they might act and think similar or completely identical in a consumer world built on [[capitalism]] as we see in today's American society.\n\nCiting the many bodies that are never found, [[Henry Bean]] wonders \"is it possible that the murders themselves never occurred?\" He continues:{{r|bean19910317}}\n\n{{quote|The novel subtly and relentlessly undercuts its own authority, and because Bateman, unlike, say, [[Vladimir Nabokov|Nabokov]]'s unreliable narrators, does not hint at a \"truth\" beyond his own delusions, \"American Psycho\" becomes a wonderfully unstable account.

These scholarships are equivalent to the difference between the resident rate of tuition and non-resident rate of tuition. Since tuition is based on a tuition band, the amount of the scholarship for the Academic Year of 2004 - 2005 is valued at an estimate of USD $4,534 based on 24 - 36 semester credits. Fall enrollees receive the scholarship for the academic year and Summer School. Spring Semester enrollees receive the scholarship for Spring Semester and Summer School.\n\nApplication And Renewal Process For Cross Cultural Scholarship\nProspective International Students are invited to apply for the Cross-Cultural Scholarship by completing the application. The application will be reviewed as soon as it is received and a decision will be made concerning your possible selection as a scholarship recipient.

Renewing the scholarship for your second year at the University is a simple process by completing the following:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.winona.edu/international-services/ccs-scholarship.asp|title=International Services}}</ref>\n\n- Maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.50 (maximum length of scholarship is 9 semesters)\n\n- Maintain a valid F-1 or J-1 Immigration Status\n\n- Complete (3) Cross-Cultural Outreach projects during the academic year, starting in the fall and ending in the spring semester. These projects are called Minor Projects (2) and Major Project (1), for a total of three (3) projects.\n\nThe Cross-Cultural scholarship is a substantial source of savings for International Students.\n\n'''Presidential Honor Scholarship'''\n\nPresidential Honor Scholarships at Winona State University are designed especially for International Student freshmen with no transfer credits.

Winona settler Dr. John Ford lobbied the [[Minnesota Legislature]] to establish normal schools and rallied more than $5,000 in local donations to establish the state's first such institution.<ref name=Gaut>{{cite journal |last=Gaut |first=Greg |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Model School Building and College Hall of the Winona Normal School |url=http://www.mnhs.org/shpo/nrhp/docs_pdfs/0061_winonanormalschool.pdf |publisher=National Park Service |date=2013-05-17 |accessdate=2015-07-07}}</ref>  It was also the first tax-funded school west of the [[Mississippi River]].<ref name=History>{{cite web |title=Winona State History |url=http://www.winona.edu/history.asp |publisher=Winona State University |accessdate=2015-07-07}}</ref>\n\nClasses at the Winona Normal School began in September 1860, but the following year most of the male students as well as the principal and other staff left to serve in the [[American Civil War]].  The school closed in March 1862 due to the Civil War, then for another two years due to the [[Sioux]] War of 1862.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of St. Cloud Teachers College|last=Brainard|first=Dudley S.|publisher=St. Cloud State University|year=1953|isbn=|location=St. Cloud State University Institutional Repository|pages=3}}</ref> Its first class graduated in 1866.  The program soon added a [[laboratory school]] in which local children received education from faculty while students observed or, occasionally, led lessons themselves.  The normal school quickly outgrew its original four-room building, but state funding and local donations of money and a plot of land led to the construction of a proper facility in 1869.<ref name=Gaut />\n\nThe campus expanded with two new wings on \"Old Main\" in 1894, a library/gymnasium/kindergarten building\u2014Ogden Hall\u2014in 1909, and a women's dormitory\u2014Morey Hall\u2014in 1910.

These scholarships are equivalent to the difference between the resident rate of tuition and non-resident rate of tuition. Since tuition is based on a tuition band, the amount of the scholarship for the Academic Year of 2004 - 2005 is valued at an estimate of USD $4,534 based on 24 - 36 semester credits. Fall enrollees receive the scholarship for the academic year and Summer School. Spring Semester enrollees receive the scholarship for Spring Semester and Summer School.\n\nApplication And Renewal Process For Cross Cultural Scholarship\nProspective International Students are invited to apply for the Cross-Cultural Scholarship by completing the application. The application will be reviewed as soon as it is received and a decision will be made concerning your possible selection as a scholarship recipient.
