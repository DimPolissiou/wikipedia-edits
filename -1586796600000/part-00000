H. Asquith]]'s government), Isaacs was the first Jew to be [[Lord Chief Justice of England|Lord Chief Justice]], and the first, and as yet only, [[British Jew]] to be raised to a [[marquessate]].\n\n==Early life==\nIsaacs was born in London, the son of a Jewish fruit importer at [[Spitalfields]]. He was educated at [[University College School]]<ref name=EB1922/> and then entered the family business at the age of 15. In 1876\u201377 he served as a ship's boy and later worked as a [[Stockjobber|jobber]] on the [[London Stock Exchange|stock-exchange]] from 1880\u201384.\n\n== Career at the bar ==\n[[File:Rufus Isaacs, Vanity Fair, 1904-02-18.jpg|thumb|Isaacs caricatured by [[Leslie Ward|Spy]] for [[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]], 1904]]\nIsaacs was admitted as a student to the [[Middle Temple]] in 1885, and was [[Call to the Bar|called to the Bar]] in 1887.<ref>''[[The Concise Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, 1992.</ref> He set up his own chambers at 1 Garden Court, Temple, and was very successful; within five years he was able to repay his creditors, and after twenty years at the bar earned the enormous sum of \u00a330,000 per year. He was appointed a [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1898, after only ten and half years at the junior bar.\n\nIsaacs mainly practised in the [[Commercial Court (England and Wales)|Commercial Court]], with occasional appearance in the divorce court or at the Old Bailey. Among his famous cases were the defence of ''[[The Star (London)|The Star]]'' against a charge of libel by Arthur Chamberlain (at the behest of his brother [[Joseph Chamberlain|Joseph]]), the [[Taff Vale Rly Co v Amalgamated Society of Rly Servants|Taff Vale case]] (where he appeared for the union), the 1903 [[Brown Dog affair#Bayliss v. Coleridge|''Bayliss v. Coleridge'' libel suit]], the prosecution of the fraudster [[Whitaker Wright]], the defence of Sir Edward Russell on a charge of criminal libel, and that of Robert Sievier on a charge on blackmail.\n\nAs a barrister, Isaacs was a hard worker, rising early to prepare his cases, although he never worked after dinner. His advocacy was calm and forensic, and he was renowned for his style of cross-examination.\n\n==Political career in the House of Commons==\nHaving earlier contested unsuccessfully North Kensington in 1900, Isaacs entered the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] as the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Reading (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading]] at a by-election on 6 August 1904, a seat he held for nine years until 1913.<ref name=EB1922/>\n\nIn 1910, he was appointed [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]] in the government of [[H. H. Asquith]] and received the customary [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]]. After six months, he was appointed [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]]. On the resignation of [[Robert Reid, 1st Earl Loreburn|Lord Loreburn]] as Lord Chancellor in 1912, Isaacs had expected to succeed him, but was passed over in favour of [[Richard Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane|Lord Haldane]]. To apease him, Asquith invited Isaacs to join the Cabinet; he was the first Attorney General to sit in the Cabinet.\n\nAs law officer, Isaacs handled many high-profile cases. As Solicitor General, he appeared for the Admiralty in the [[George Archer-Shee]] case. As Attorney General, he led the prosecutions of [[Edward Mylius]] for criminal libel against [[George V]] (and was appointed [[Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order|KCVO]] shortly after), of poisoner [[Frederick Seddon]] (the only murder trial Isaacs ever took part in), and of suffragette [[Emmeline Pankhurst]]. He also represented the [[Board of Trade]] at the inquiry into the sinking of the RMS ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]''.\n\nIn addition, he helped to pilot through the Commons several pieces of key legislation, including the [[Parliament Act 1911]], the [[Official Secrets Act 1911]], the [[National Insurance Act 1911]], the [[Trade Union Act 1913]], and the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914]]. He was appointed to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] in the [[1911 Coronation Honours]].\n\n=== The Marconi scandal ===\nIsaacs was one of several high-ranking members of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government accused of involvement in the [[Marconi scandal]].<ref>Lady Frances Lonsdale Donaldson, \"The Marconi scandal\", Harcourt, Brace & World, 1962</ref> An article published in ''[[Le Matin (France)|Le Matin]]'' on 14 February 1913 alleged corruption in the award of a government contract to the [[Marconi Company]] and [[insider trading]] in Marconi's shares, implicating a number of sitting government ministers, including [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]], the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]; Isaacs, then [[Attorney General]]; [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]], [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster General]]; and the Treasurer of the Liberal Party, the [[Alexander Murray, 1st Baron Murray of Elibank|Master of Elibank, Lord Murray]].<ref name=baker/>\n\nThe allegations included the fact that Isaacs' brother, [[Godfrey Isaacs]], was managing director of the Marconi company at the time that the cabinet, in which Isaacs sat, awarded Marconi the contract.<ref>Harford Montgomery Hyde, \"Lord Reading; the life of Rufus Isaacs, First Marquess of Reading\", Heinemann, 1968, pages 124,138\u2013140</ref><ref>Stanley Jackson, \"Rufus Isaacs, first marquess of Reading\", Cassell, 1936, pages 167\u2013172</ref> Isaacs and Samuels sued ''Le Matin'' for [[Defamation|libel]], and as a result, the journal apologised and printed a complete retraction in its 18 February 1913 issue.<ref name=baker/><ref>Ian D.

Albert Thomas and Lord Reading.jpg|thumb|right|Mr. [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] (2nd left), Lord Reading (2nd from right) and [[Albert Thomas (minister)|M. Albert Thomas]] (far left) visiting the Front, France. (photo: [[Ernest Brooks (photographer)|Ernest Brooks]])]]\nIn October 1913 he was made [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice of England]], in succession to the [[Richard Webster, 1st Viscount Alverstone|Viscount Alverstone]]. At the time the Attorney General had the right of first refusal for the appointment, but his involvement in the Marconi scandal complicated matters. Although reluctant to abandon his political career Isaacs felt he had little choice: to refuse would be to suggest that the Marconi scandal had tainted him. Consequently he accepted the post, and was elevated to the peerage as '''Baron Reading''', of [[Erleigh]] in the [[County of Berkshire]], on 9 January 1914.<ref>{{London Gazette\n| issue = 28791\n| date = 9 January 1914\n| page = 258\n}}</ref> His appointment caused some controversy, and led to [[Rudyard Kipling]] attacking him in the poem \"Gehazi\".\n\nAs Lord Chief Justice Reading presided over the trial of [[Roger Casement]] for high treason. His attendance in court was, however, intermittent, as he was frequently called upon by the government to serve as an advisor. In August 1914 Reading was enlisted to deal with the financial crisis brought about by the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. In 1915 he led the [[Anglo-French Financial Commission]] to seek financial assistance for the Allies from the United States. During the December 1916 Cabinet crisis, he acted as intermediary between Asquith and [[David Lloyd George]].\n\nIn September 1917 Reading returned to the United States with the special appointment of high commissioner to the United States and Canada. In 1918 he was appointed [[British Ambassador to the United States]], all the while remaining Lord Chief Justice. Returning to England for six months in 1918, he frequently attended the [[War Cabinet]] and was sent to France as Lloyd George's confidential emissary. He returned to the United States as Ambassador in 1919, relinquishing the post the same year. After the excitement of wartime diplomacy, he returned unwillingly to the bench in 1919, while seeking new appointments.\n\nFor his wartime public service he was appointed [[Knight Grand Cross of The Order of the Bath|GCB]] in 1915, made '''Viscount Reading''', of Erleigh in the County of Berkshire in 1916, and '''Viscount Erleigh''', of Erleigh in the County of Berkshire and '''Earl of Reading''', in 1917.<ref>{{London Gazette\n| issue = 29651\n| date = 4 July 1916\n| page = 6597\n}}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette\n| issue = 30442\n| date = 21 December 1917\n| page = 13384\n}}</ref>\n\n== Viceroy of India ==\n[[File:Statue of the 1st Marquess of Reading.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Isaacs as Viceroy of India, originally sited in [[New Delhi]] but now in Eldon Square Gardens in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]]]\nIn 1921, he resigned the chief justiceship to become [[Viceroy of India|Viceroy and Governor-General of India]]. Reading preferred a conciliatory policy: he was determined to implement the provisions of the [[Government of India Act 1919]] and opposed racial discrimination. He personally received [[ Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] and [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], and visited [[Amritsar]] as a gesture of reconciliation. However, he ended up using force on several occasions: in 1921 he ordered the suppression of the [[Malabar rebellion]], and in 1922 he put down Sikh unrest in the Punjab. The same year, he had [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] arrested for sedition. Reading cultivated good relations with the Indian princes, but forced two maharajas to abdicate.\n\nOn his return from India in 1926, he was made '''Marquess of Reading''', the first man to raise from commoner to a marquessate since the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]. The next year he was made [[Captain of Deal Castle]] in 1927, a position he held until 1934.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eastkent.freeuk.com/deal/castle/captains.htm|title=Captains of Deal Castle|publisher=East Kent freeuk|accessdate= 10 January 2017}}</ref> As Viceroy Reading was appointed GCSI and GCIE ''ex officio'' in 1921, and in 1922 was promoted to GCVO.\n\nAs a former Viceroy, Reading was critical of some of the policies of his successor [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Irwin]]. On 5 November 1929 he attacked Irwin in the House of Lords for using the term \u201cDominion Status\u201d with regard to India, prior to the report of the [[Simon Commission]].<ref>Jago 2015, pp.65-7, 70</ref>\n\n== Later life and career ==\n[[File:LordReading.jpg|thumb|Lord Reading and his wife at Haifa Power Station, 1930s|alt=]]On his return from India, Reading, who had no pension and was a heavy spender, sat on several corporate boards, and later became president of [[Imperial Chemical Industries]]. The [[Leader of the Liberal Party (UK)|Leader of the Liberal Party in the House of Lords]] from 1931\u201335, he took part in the [[Round Table Conferences (India)|Round Table Conferences]] of 1930\u201332 on the future of British India as head of the Liberal delegates. He was also a member of the select committee charged with the drafting of the [[Government of India Act 1935]].\n\nIn MacDonald's [[National Government (1931)|National Government]] in August 1931, Reading briefly served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs]] and [[Leader of the House of Lords]], but stood down after the first major reshuffle in November due to ill-health.\n\nHe was appointed [[Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports]] in 1934.\n\n== Death ==\nLord Reading died in London in December 1935 aged 75. After cremation at [[Golders Green Crematorium]] his ashes were buried at the nearby [[Golders Green Jewish Cemetery|Jewish cemetery]].<ref name=\"compeerage\">{{cite book|title=The Complete Peerage, Volume XIII, Peerage Creations 1901\u20131938|publisher=St Catherine's Press|year=1949|page=182}}</ref> The house where he died, No. 32 [[Curzon Street]] in [[Mayfair]], has had a [[blue plaque]] on it since 1971.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://openplaques.org/plaques/663|title=Rufus Isaacs blue plaque|publisher=openplaques.org|accessdate=24 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Assessment ==\nIn his approach to politics, Isaacs was, according to Denis Judd,<blockquote>\u201cno blood-red Radical, and had \u2018little sympathy with the narrower aspects of the Nonconformist outlook which constituted so powerful an element in contemporary Liberalism.\u2019 Liberalism, nonetheless, was the natural party for him to support. Within his own father\u2019s lifetime Jews had been obliged to struggle to obtain full civil rights. Moreover, the Liberal party apparently stood for the noble principles of liberty, toleration and progress whereas the Tories, although somewhat disguised with the Unionist coalition, seemed to offer little in the way of enlightened policies. For a man who approved of social reform, yet wanted to stop well short of revolution, the Liberal party was the obvious home.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LQ9LAQAAQBAJ&pg=PT63&lpg=PT63&dq=Rufus+Isaacs+first+marquess+of+Reading+radical+liberal&source=bl&ots=VrGqm-IvMN&sig=eXGvF_IkS2KmRMiTY5EAwpxnMww&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAWoVChMInbOx6Li9xwIViEvbCh3C_Qcd#v=onepage&q=Rufus%20Isaacs%20first%20marquess%20of%20Reading%20radical%20liberal&f=false Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading: radical liberal]</ref></blockquote>Indeed, Isaacs championed such measures as the taxation of land values and reforms in the legal standing of unions, education, licensing, and military organization.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LQ9LAQAAQBAJ&pg=PT66&dq=denis+judd+the+platform+on+which+he+stood&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMI8KCX8dy9xwIVRDHbCh298QqZ#v=onepage&q=denis%20judd%20the%20platform%20on%20which%20he%20stood&f=false The Platform On Which He Stood]</ref> Isaacs also gave staunch official backing to David Lloyd George's initiative on land reform, together with his tax on land values<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LQ9LAQAAQBAJ&pg=PT93&dq=Rufus+Isaacs+land+values&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAmoVChMImueHwNu9xwIV5ZbbCh2DmAyI#v=onepage&q=Rufus%20Isaacs%20land%20values&f=false Rufus Isaacs and land values]</ref> and national social insurance scheme.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1911/may/25/national-insurance-bill-1#S5CV0026P0_19110525_HOC_292 Hansard 25 May 1911, National Insurance bill]</ref>\n\n== Honours ==\nIn addition to five peerages and five knighthoods, Reading received many other honours. In 1925 he was appointed Grand Cordon of the [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]].<ref>Royal Decree of 1925/-M\u00e9morial du centenaire de l'Ordre de L\u00e9opold. 1832-1932.

He received honorary degrees from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Toronto, Calcutta, Cambridge and Oxford.\n\nAlthough he had no apparent link with Canada, his eminence was such that the Lord Reading Law Society (founded in 1948 to promote the interests of Jewish members of the [[Quebec Bar]]) was named in his honour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lordreading.org/en/about|title=About|publisher=The Lord Reading Law Society|accessdate=13 May 2014}}</ref> A founding chairman of the Palestine Electric Corporation (along with [[Alfred Mond, 1st Baron Melchett|Alfred Mond]] (father of his daughter in-law) and [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]]), the [[Reading Power Station]] in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]] was named in his honour.\n\n== Family ==\nIn 1887 he married [[Alice Isaacs, Marchioness of Reading|Alice Edith Cohen]], who suffered from a chronic physical disability and died of cancer in 1930, after over 40 years of marriage. He then married [[Stella Isaacs, Marchioness of Reading|Stella Charnaud]], the first Lady Reading's secretary. His second marriage lasted until his own death in 1935. After his death Stella Isaacs was made [[Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (DBE) in 1941,<ref>{{London Gazette\n| issue = 35029\n| date = 1 January 1941\n| page = 12\n| supp =

H. Asquith]]'s government), Isaacs was the first Jew to be [[Lord Chief Justice of England|Lord Chief Justice]], and the first, and as yet only, [[British Jew]] to be raised to a [[marquessate]].\n\n==Early life==\n\nIsaacs was born in London, the son of a Jewish fruit importer at [[Spitalfields]]. He was educated at [[University College School]]<ref name=EB1922/> and then entered the family business at the age of 15. In 1876\u201377 he served as a ship's boy and later worked as a [[Stockjobber|jobber]] on the [[London Stock Exchange|stock-exchange]] from 1880\u201384.\n\n== Career at the bar ==\nIsaacs was admitted as a student to the [[Middle Temple]] in 1885, and was [[Call to the Bar|called to the Bar]] in 1887.<ref>''[[The Concise Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, 1992.</ref> He set up his own chambers at 1 Garden Court, Temple, and was very successful; within five years he was able to repay his creditors, and after twenty years at the bar earned the enormous sum of \u00a330,000 per year. He was appointed a [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1898, after only ten and half years at the junior bar.\n\nIsaacs mainly practised in the [[Commercial Court (England and Wales)|Commercial Court]], with occasional appearance in the divorce court or at the Old Bailey. Among his famous cases were the defence of ''[[The Star (London)|The Star]]'' against a charge of libel by Arthur Chamberlain (at the behest of his brother [[Joseph Chamberlain|Joseph]]), the [[Taff Vale Rly Co v Amalgamated Society of Rly Servants|Taff Vale case]] (where he appeared for the union), the 1903 [[Brown Dog affair#Bayliss v. Coleridge|''Bayliss v. Coleridge'' libel suit]], the prosecution of the fraudster [[Whitaker Wright]], the defence of Sir Edward Russell on a charge of criminal libel, and that of Robert Sievier on a charge on blackmail.\n\nAs a barrister, Isaacs was a hard worker, rising early to prepare his cases, although he never worked after dinner. His advocacy was calm and forensic, and he was renowned for his style of cross-examination.\n\n==Political career in the House of Commons==\nHaving earlier contested unsuccessfully North Kensington in 1900, Isaacs entered the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] as the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Reading (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading]] at a by-election on 6 August 1904, a seat he held for nine years until 1913.<ref name=EB1922/>\n\nIn 1910, he was appointed [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]] in the government of [[H. H. Asquith]] and received the customary [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]]. After six months, he was appointed [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]]. On the resignation of [[Robert Reid, 1st Earl Loreburn|Lord Loreburn]] as Lord Chancellor in 1912, Isaacs had expected to succeed him, but was passed over in favour of [[Richard Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane|Lord Haldane]]. To apease him, Asquith invited Isaacs to join the Cabinet; he was the first Attorney General to sit in the Cabinet.\n\nAs law officer, Isaacs handled many high-profile cases. As Solicitor General, he appeared for the Admiralty in the [[George Archer-Shee]] case. As Attorney General, he led the prosecutions of [[Edward Mylius]] for criminal libel against [[George V]] (and was appointed [[Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order|KCVO]] shortly after), of poisoner [[Frederick Seddon]] (the only murder trial Isaacs ever took part in), and of suffragette [[Emmeline Pankhurst]]. He also represented the [[Board of Trade]] at the inquiry into the sinking of the RMS ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]''.\n\nIn addition, he helped to pilot through the Commons several pieces of key legislation, including the [[Parliament Act 1911]], the [[Official Secrets Act 1911]], the [[National Insurance Act 1911]], the [[Trade Union Act 1913]], and the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914]]. He was appointed to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] in the [[1911 Coronation Honours]].\n\n=== The Marconi scandal ===\nIsaacs was one of several high-ranking members of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government accused of involvement in the [[Marconi scandal]].<ref>Lady Frances Lonsdale Donaldson, \"The Marconi scandal\", Harcourt, Brace & World, 1962</ref> An article published in ''[[Le Matin (France)|Le Matin]]'' on 14 February 1913 alleged corruption in the award of a government contract to the [[Marconi Company]] and [[insider trading]] in Marconi's shares, implicating a number of sitting government ministers, including [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]], the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]; Isaacs, then [[Attorney General]]; [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]], [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster General]]; and the Treasurer of the Liberal Party, the [[Alexander Murray, 1st Baron Murray of Elibank|Master of Elibank, Lord Murray]].<ref name=baker/>\n\nThe allegations included the fact that Isaacs' brother, [[Godfrey Isaacs]], was managing director of the Marconi company at the time that the cabinet, in which Isaacs sat, awarded Marconi the contract.<ref>Harford Montgomery Hyde, \"Lord Reading; the life of Rufus Isaacs, First Marquess of Reading\", Heinemann, 1968, pages 124,138\u2013140</ref><ref>Stanley Jackson, \"Rufus Isaacs, first marquess of Reading\", Cassell, 1936, pages 167\u2013172</ref> Isaacs and Samuels sued ''Le Matin'' for [[Defamation|libel]], and as a result, the journal apologised and printed a complete retraction in its 18 February 1913 issue.<ref name=baker/><ref>Ian D.

Chesterton: A biography'', Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1986, {{ISBN|0-297-78858-2}}, pages 204\u2013205</ref>\n\nThe factual matters were at least partly resolved by a parliamentary [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|select committee]] investigation, which issued three reports: all found that Isaacs and others had purchased shares in the [[Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America|American Marconi]] company, but while the fellow-Liberal members of the committee cleared the ministers of all blame, the opposition members reported that Isaacs and others had acted with \"grave impropriety\".<ref name=baker>W.J. Baker, \"The history of the Marconi company 1874\u20131965\", Routledge, 1998 {{ISBN|0-415-14624-0}}, pages 144\u2013146</ref> It was not made public during the trial that these shares had been made available through Isaacs's brother at a favourable price.<ref>^ a b Michael Finch, ''G.K. Chesterton: A biography'', Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1986, {{ISBN|0-297-78858-2}}, pages 204\u2013205</ref>\n\n== Lord Chief Justice and Ambassador to the United States ==\nIn October 1913 he was made [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice of England]], in succession to the [[Richard Webster, 1st Viscount Alverstone|Viscount Alverstone]]. At the time the Attorney General had the right of first refusal for the appointment, but his involvement in the Marconi scandal complicated matters. Although reluctant to abandon his political career Isaacs felt he had little choice: to refuse would be to suggest that the Marconi scandal had tainted him. Consequently he accepted the post, and was elevated to the peerage as '''Baron Reading''', of [[Erleigh]] in the [[County of Berkshire]], on 9 January 1914.<ref>{{London Gazette\n| issue = 28791\n| date = 9 January 1914\n| page = 258\n}}</ref> His appointment caused some controversy, and led to [[Rudyard Kipling]] attacking him in the poem \"Gehazi\".\n\nAs Lord Chief Justice Reading presided over the trial of [[Roger Casement]] for high treason. His attendance in court was, however, intermittent, as he was frequently called upon by the government to serve as an advisor. In August 1914 Reading was enlisted to deal with the financial crisis brought about by the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. In 1915 he led the [[Anglo-French Financial Commission]] to seek financial assistance for the Allies from the United States. During the December 1916 Cabinet crisis, he acted as intermediary between Asquith and [[David Lloyd George]].\n\nIn September 1917 Reading returned to the United States with the special appointment of high commissioner to the United States and Canada. In 1918 he was appointed [[British Ambassador to the United States]], all the while remaining Lord Chief Justice. Returning to England for six months in 1918, he frequently attended the [[War Cabinet]] and was sent to France as Lloyd George's confidential emissary. He returned to the United States as Ambassador in 1919, relinquishing the post the same year. After the excitement of wartime diplomacy, he returned unwillingly to the bench in 1919, while seeking new appointments.\n\nFor his wartime public service he was appointed [[Knight Grand Cross of The Order of the Bath|GCB]] in 1915, made '''Viscount Reading''', of Erleigh in the County of Berkshire in 1916, and '''Viscount Erleigh''', of Erleigh in the County of Berkshire and '''Earl of Reading''', in 1917.<ref>{{London Gazette\n| issue = 29651\n| date = 4 July 1916\n| page = 6597\n}}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette\n| issue = 30442\n| date = 21 December 1917\n| page = 13384\n}}</ref>\n[[File:Rufus Isaacs, Vanity Fair, 1904-02-18.jpg|thumb|Isaacs caricatured by [[Leslie Ward|Spy]] for [[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]], 1904]]\n\n== Viceroy of India ==\nIn 1921, he resigned the chief justiceship to become [[Viceroy of India|Viceroy and Governor-General of India]]. Reading preferred a conciliatory policy: he was determined to implement the provisions of the [[Government of India Act 1919]] and opposed racial discrimination. He personally received [[ Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] and [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], and visited [[Amritsar]] as a gesture of reconciliation. However, he ended up using force on several occasions: in 1921 he ordered the suppression of the [[Malabar rebellion]], and in 1922 he put down Sikh unrest in the Punjab. The same year, he had [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] arrested for sedition. Reading cultivated good relations with the Indian princes, but forced two maharajas to abdicate.\n\nOn his return from India in 1926, he was made '''Marquess of Reading''', the first man to raise from commoner to a marquessate since the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]. The next year he was made [[Captain of Deal Castle]] in 1927, a position he held until 1934.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eastkent.freeuk.com/deal/castle/captains.htm|title=Captains of Deal Castle|publisher=East Kent freeuk|accessdate= 10 January 2017}}</ref> As Viceroy Reading was appointed GCSI and GCIE ''ex officio'' in 1921, and in 1922 was promoted to GCVO.\n\nAs a former Viceroy, Reading was critical of some of the policies of his successor [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Irwin]]. On 5 November 1929 he attacked Irwin in the House of Lords for using the term \u201cDominion Status\u201d with regard to India, prior to the report of the [[Simon Commission]].<ref>Jago 2015, pp.65-7, 70</ref>\n\n== Later life and career ==\n[[File:LordReading.jpg|thumb|Lord Reading and his wife at Haifa Power Station, 1930s|alt=]]On his return from India, Reading, who had no pension and was a heavy spender, sat on several corporate boards, and later became president of [[Imperial Chemical Industries]]. The [[Leader of the Liberal Party (UK)|Leader of the Liberal Party in the House of Lords]] from 1931\u201335, he took part in the [[Round Table Conferences (India)|Round Table Conferences]] of 1930\u201332 on the future of British India as head of the Liberal delegates. He was also a member of the select committee charged with the drafting of the [[Government of India Act 1935]].\n\nIn MacDonald's [[National Government (1931)|National Government]] in August 1931, Reading briefly served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs]] and [[Leader of the House of Lords]], but stood down after the first major reshuffle in November due to ill-health.\n\nHe was appointed [[Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports]] in 1934.\n\n== Death ==\nLord Reading died in London in December 1935 aged 75. After cremation at [[Golders Green Crematorium]] his ashes were buried at the nearby [[Golders Green Jewish Cemetery|Jewish cemetery]].<ref name=\"compeerage\">{{cite book|title=The Complete Peerage, Volume XIII, Peerage Creations 1901\u20131938|publisher=St Catherine's Press|year=1949|page=182}}</ref> The house where he died, No. 32 [[Curzon Street]] in [[Mayfair]], has had a [[blue plaque]] on it since 1971.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://openplaques.org/plaques/663|title=Rufus Isaacs blue plaque|publisher=openplaques.org|accessdate=24 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Assessment ==\nIn his approach to politics, Isaacs was, according to Denis Judd,<blockquote>\u201cno blood-red Radical, and had \u2018little sympathy with the narrower aspects of the Nonconformist outlook which constituted so powerful an element in contemporary Liberalism.\u2019 Liberalism, nonetheless, was the natural party for him to support. Within his own father\u2019s lifetime Jews had been obliged to struggle to obtain full civil rights. Moreover, the Liberal party apparently stood for the noble principles of liberty, toleration and progress whereas the Tories, although somewhat disguised with the Unionist coalition, seemed to offer little in the way of enlightened policies. For a man who approved of social reform, yet wanted to stop well short of revolution, the Liberal party was the obvious home.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LQ9LAQAAQBAJ&pg=PT63&lpg=PT63&dq=Rufus+Isaacs+first+marquess+of+Reading+radical+liberal&source=bl&ots=VrGqm-IvMN&sig=eXGvF_IkS2KmRMiTY5EAwpxnMww&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAWoVChMInbOx6Li9xwIViEvbCh3C_Qcd#v=onepage&q=Rufus%20Isaacs%20first%20marquess%20of%20Reading%20radical%20liberal&f=false Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading: radical liberal]</ref></blockquote>Indeed, Isaacs championed such measures as the taxation of land values and reforms in the legal standing of unions, education, licensing, and military organization.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LQ9LAQAAQBAJ&pg=PT66&dq=denis+judd+the+platform+on+which+he+stood&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMI8KCX8dy9xwIVRDHbCh298QqZ#v=onepage&q=denis%20judd%20the%20platform%20on%20which%20he%20stood&f=false The Platform On Which He Stood]</ref> Isaacs also gave staunch official backing to David Lloyd George's initiative on land reform, together with his tax on land values<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LQ9LAQAAQBAJ&pg=PT93&dq=Rufus+Isaacs+land+values&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAmoVChMImueHwNu9xwIV5ZbbCh2DmAyI#v=onepage&q=Rufus%20Isaacs%20land%20values&f=false Rufus Isaacs and land values]</ref> and national social insurance scheme.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1911/may/25/national-insurance-bill-1#S5CV0026P0_19110525_HOC_292 Hansard 25 May 1911, National Insurance bill]</ref>\n\n== Honours ==\nIn addition to five peerages and five knighthoods, Reading received many other honours. In 1925 he was appointed Grand Cordon of the [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]].<ref>Royal Decree of 1925/-M\u00e9morial du centenaire de l'Ordre de L\u00e9opold. 1832-1932.

He received honorary degrees from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Toronto, Calcutta, Cambridge and Oxford.\n\nAlthough he had no apparent link with Canada, his eminence was such that the Lord Reading Law Society (founded in 1948 to promote the interests of Jewish members of the [[Quebec Bar]]) was named in his honour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lordreading.org/en/about|title=About|publisher=The Lord Reading Law Society|accessdate=13 May 2014}}</ref> A founding chairman of the Palestine Electric Corporation (along with [[Alfred Mond, 1st Baron Melchett|Alfred Mond]] (father of his daughter in-law) and [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]]), the [[Reading Power Station]] in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]] was named in his honour.\n\n== Family ==\nIn 1887 he married [[Alice Isaacs, Marchioness of Reading|Alice Edith Cohen]], who suffered from a chronic physical disability and died of cancer in 1930, after over 40 years of marriage. He then married [[Stella Isaacs, Marchioness of Reading|Stella Charnaud]], the first Lady Reading's secretary. His second marriage lasted until his own death in 1935.

He is a retired Navy Intelligence Officer and qualified Surface Warfare Officer and Joint Specialty Officer. He writes on maritime and defense issues for various periodicals and serves on the Editorial Board for the US Naval Institute\u2019s Proceedings.\nA 2010 chronicle of the long history of depredation at sea, Benerson Little\u2019s Pirate Hunting: The Fight Against Pirates, Privateers, and Sea Raiders from Antiquity to the Present adds a useful work to the bookshelves of maritime thinkers. Little does a commendable job using historical examples to remind readers that piracy is not a new phenomenon. Perhaps more importantly, he takes the opportunity to clarify that the practice of maritime depredation has not been unique to lawless pirates. Indeed, nations have selectively used the plunder of an adversary\u2019s merchant fleet as legitimate means of warfare. Little seeks to provide \u201ca descriptive and democratic history and analysis applied in the end in the present circumstances of piracy.\u201d11 He begins with a useful discussion on the definitions relevant to piracy, which in itself can aid maritime analysts in clarifying assumptions before courses of action or solutions are applied Ttoo often, pundits have not begun the piracy debate from a footing of rigorous and scholarly examination of problem definition and context). Little categorizes groups historically exploiting maritime depredation as \u201cSea Rovers,\u201d in a deeper assessment of both legitimate and illicit plunderers of merchant shipping. Some readers may take exception to this taxonomy, but it serves an important point in pushing the reader to examine the implications of terminology. Indeed, one only needs to consider that the US Constitution authorizes Congress to issue letters of marque and reprisal for attacks on merchant ships to appreciate that in some cases, one man\u2019s pirate is another man\u2019s privateer.Little finds enduring themes in his study from antiquity to the modern day. He finds that \u201cneed and greed,\u201d much less so than religion or ideology, are the historical motives of piracy. He highlights the traditional clamor of peoples for governments to address the piracy scourge and the general reluctance of leaders to take on the mission due to prohibitive expenses. Little also stresses the tendency of states to seek treaties and alliances to attack the problem, observ- ing that these methods typically achieve mixed results. His examples of the centuries-long blights of Mycenaean pirates, Norse raiders, and Mediterranean Corsairs are sobering evidence that piracy has never been easily addressed. Little effectively dissects piracy across the ages to conclude that it is in essence an economic activity, in that coherent efforts to counter it only come when it suf- ficiently threatens commerce. The book emphasizes that market forces will have significant influence on the commercial response to piracy when governments do not step in\u2014essentially, business will adapt. Little notes that historically, \u201cwith major political and economic transition or breakdown came both the need and opportunity for sea roving.\u201d12 Add to that the strategic proximity to major sea trade routes and it becomes clear that the impetus for piracy is recurring and perhaps inevitable. Notably, he asserts that piracy also remains suppressed only so long as states apply credible land and naval power to the problem. Hence, piracy\u2019s root causes lay inland, and Little emphasizes that it \u201cwill never be solved146 ParametersReview Essay: The Piracy \u201cThreat\u201d in Perspectiveby capturing or killing every pirate on the sea.\u201d13 He recommends a prudent mix of international cooperation, economic and security capacity building, best business practices that include arming merchants, and a credible system to incarcerate captured pirates. Finally, Little deserves praise for cogently stress- ing that piracy and terrorism are different phenomena and equating them is at best naive and at worst a distraction from actual terrorist threats.In the end, Little does a great service by cementing the truism that history provides meaningful context and potentially useful perspectives from which to analyze contemporary problems. Many, if not all, of Little\u2019s observa- tions ring true to the current plague of Somali piracy. Naval leaders and policy makers alike would do well to consider them as contemporary ways, means, and ends are evaluated.-->\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Little, Benerson}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n[[Category:People from Key West, Florida]]\n[[Category:United States Navy SEALs personnel]]\n[[Category:American male writers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{BLP sources|date=January 2017}}\n{{inadequate lead|date=January 2017}}\n{{third-party|date=January 2017}}\n{{Orphan|date=April 2017}}\n}}\n\n'''Benerson Little''' is an American author, primarily of non-fiction, focusing on naval history, in particular, [[piracy]] and [[privateer]]ing in the 17th to early 18th centuries, including the [[Golden Age of Piracy]] in the [[Caribbean]].

Little does a commendable job using historical examples to remind readers that piracy is not a new phenomenon. Perhaps more importantly, he takes the opportunity to clarify that the practice of maritime depredation has not been unique to lawless pirates. Indeed, nations have selectively used the plunder of an adversary\u2019s merchant fleet as legitimate means of warfare. Little seeks to provide \u201ca descriptive and democratic history and analysis applied in the end in the present circumstances of piracy.\u201d11 He begins with a useful discussion on the definitions relevant to piracy, which in itself can aid maritime analysts in clarifying assumptions before courses of action or solutions are applied Ttoo often, pundits have not begun the piracy debate from a footing of rigorous and scholarly examination of problem definition and context). Little categorizes groups historically exploiting maritime depredation as \u201cSea Rovers,\u201d in a deeper assessment of both legitimate and illicit plunderers of merchant shipping. Some readers may take exception to this taxonomy, but it serves an important point in pushing the reader to examine the implications of terminology. Indeed, one only needs to consider that the US Constitution authorizes Congress to issue letters of marque and reprisal for attacks on merchant ships to appreciate that in some cases, one man\u2019s pirate is another man\u2019s privateer.Little finds enduring themes in his study from antiquity to the modern day. He finds that \u201cneed and greed,\u201d much less so than religion or ideology, are the historical motives of piracy. He highlights the traditional clamor of peoples for governments to address the piracy scourge and the general reluctance of leaders to take on the mission due to prohibitive expenses. Little also stresses the tendency of states to seek treaties and alliances to attack the problem, observ- ing that these methods typically achieve mixed results. His examples of the centuries-long blights of Mycenaean pirates, Norse raiders, and Mediterranean Corsairs are sobering evidence that piracy has never been easily addressed. Little effectively dissects piracy across the ages to conclude that it is in essence an economic activity, in that coherent efforts to counter it only come when it suf- ficiently threatens commerce. The book emphasizes that market forces will have significant influence on the commercial response to piracy when governments do not step in\u2014essentially, business will adapt. Little notes that historically, \u201cwith major political and economic transition or breakdown came both the need and opportunity for sea roving.\u201d12 Add to that the strategic proximity to major sea trade routes and it becomes clear that the impetus for piracy is recurring and perhaps inevitable. Notably, he asserts that piracy also remains suppressed only so long as states apply credible land and naval power to the problem. Hence, piracy\u2019s root causes lay inland, and Little emphasizes that it \u201cwill never be solved146 ParametersReview Essay: The Piracy \u201cThreat\u201d in Perspectiveby capturing or killing every pirate on the sea.\u201d13 He recommends a prudent mix of international cooperation, economic and security capacity building, best business practices that include arming merchants, and a credible system to incarcerate captured pirates. Finally, Little deserves praise for cogently stress- ing that piracy and terrorism are different phenomena and equating them is at best naive and at worst a distraction from actual terrorist threats.In the end, Little does a great service by cementing the truism that history provides meaningful context and potentially useful perspectives from which to analyze contemporary problems. Many, if not all, of Little\u2019s observa- tions ring true to the current plague of Somali piracy. Naval leaders and policy makers alike would do well to consider them as contemporary ways, means, and ends are evaluated.-->\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Little, Benerson}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n[[Category:People from Key West, Florida]]\n[[Category:United States Navy SEALs personnel]]\n[[Category:American male writers]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFurther reading:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benerson_Little"}

It is operated by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), which funds and oversees its research and operations.\n\n==Research==\nEMSL scientists and collaborators perform fundamental research that focuses on the biological, biogeochemical, and physical principles to predict processes occurring at the molecular and genomics-controlled smallest scales to the environmental Earth system changes at the largest scales.\n[[File:Web Size-BrownRot-28.jpg|thumb|left|A biologist is preparing an RNA sample to understand how brown rot fungi degrades wood.]]\n\nEMSL uses six Integrated Research Platforms to uncover critical information for understanding and predicting the molecular functions of biological and ecosystem processes.\n\n* '''Functional Omics''' integrates transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses to uncover biological processes in plant, fungal, and microbial systems.\n* '''Isotope and Chemical Analysis''' tracks the fate of isotopes and analyzes the chemistry of biological and environmental systems.\n* '''Molecular Bioimaging''' provides images of the structure and location of proteins and other biomolecules at nanoscale spatial and temporal resolutions.\n* Biogeochemical Transformation investigates how molecular interactions at the Earth\u2019s land, water, and air interfaces transform and transport nutrients and contaminants within the environment.\n* '''Cellular Dynamics''' uncovers the molecular signals within and between cells as they respond to their environment and other organisms.\n* '''Molecular Plant Phenotyping''' probes the interaction between genes and the environment to understand, predict, and control plant traits.\n\n==Operations==\n\nEMSL is a user research facility whereby scientists, from around the world, can submit project proposals to access the laboratory\u2019s experts and equipment at no cost. Proposals are screened through a competitive peer-review process to ensure the project is scientifically impactful and relevant to DOE's Office of Biological and Environmental Research mission.\n\nScientists whose proposals are accepted are referred to as \u201cEMSL users.\u201d Typical user research projects can last a few months to a few years. EMSL users do not have to stay on-site for the duration of their project and can visit the laboratory when needed. Much of the sample processing and analysis can be handled remotely.\n\nEMSL's user community provides the laboratory\u2019s management team with recommendations for scientific direction and efficient operations through an elected committee of representatives.\n\n==History==\nThe beginnings (1986\u20131997)\nThe idea that would become EMSL began in 1985 with a National Academy of Sciences report titled Opportunities in Chemistry. The report identified scientific challenges relating to energy and the environment that required fundamental research to achieve a solution. In response, then director of PNNL, William R. Wiley, and lab senior managers proposed a center for molecular science that would bring together theoreticians with experience in computing, modeling of molecular processes, and researchers from the physical and life sciences. Their recommendations would become EMSL, a center with advanced instrumentation for the study of molecular-level chemistry.\nWiley envisioned a facility where the research was conducted in an integrated and collaborative manner. \u201cProblems don\u2019t come in small, unique, compartmentalized packages. We must recognize the interrelationships,\u201d said Wiley.\nOhio-based Battelle Memorial Institute, which operates PNNL for DOE, approved $8.5 million in funding over four years to build the facility; develop research programs; and obtain the equipment, facilities, scientists, and staff to support these programs.\n\nPNNL began construction of the facility in July 1994 and completed the laboratory in August 1997. EMSL opened October 1, 1997, for full operation as DOE's newest national scientific user facility.\n\n===The early years (1997\u20132001)===\n\nDuring its first five years, EMSL operations focused on building capabilities, recruiting scientific leadership, and attracting users. The scientific focus then expanded to include biology, particularly the study of naturally occurring microbes for environmental cleanup, alternative energy, and carbon dioxide reduction in the atmosphere \u2013 critical challenges important to DOE.\n\nEMSL's early user program focused on single investigator studies \u2013 particularly those Wiley championed that crossed disciplinary boundaries \u2013 and quickly reached more than 1,000 users per year, representing every state and several foreign countries.\n\n===A maturing program (2001\u20132009)===\n\nDuring this period, EMSL focused on two grand challenges:\n* a biogeochemistry question concerning the fundamental interaction between microbes and minerals, and\n* a study addressing the structure and function of proteins in the cell membrane.\n\nWork on these challenges led to new opportunities for the scientific community \u2013 with research campaigns designed to focus teams on a single challenge. \n\nIn January 2007, EMSL celebrated its first permanent expansion: a nearly 4,000-square-foot raised floor within its high-performance computing operations center for an 11.8-teraflop supercomputer named Chinook, which was then the fifth-fastest system in the world. In April 2008, EMSL dedicated a new office pod to distinguished user J. Mike White that houses nearly 100 staff and users. In early 2012, EMSL opened its Quiet Wing housing a suite of ultrasensitive high-resolution microscopy and scanning instruments.\n\n===Building for the future (2009 to present)===\n[[File:Web Size-SynBio Fungi-5.jpg|thumb|right|A biologist is studying natural bioproducts using traditional genetics and synthetic biology. ]]\nIn October 2010, EMSL\u2019s premier computational chemistry software package, NWChem, went open source \u2013 allowing computer scientists worldwide to contribute to its future development and making it available to more researchers and students. The code has been cited over 3760 times (according to a Web of Science search in 2020) since 2010.\n\nIn June 2013, EMSL retired the Chinook supercomputer and welcomed Cascade, a 3.4-petaflops system.\nEMSL celebrated its twentieth anniversary in August 2017, showcasing NWChem computational chemistry software, and advances in subsurface science and foundational biofuel production. Scientific leaders participated in the event, including internationally recognized scientists Thom Dunning, Steve Colson, and Jean Futrell.\n\nToday EMSL focuses its scientific discovery research in Functional and Systems Biology and Environmental Transformations and Interactions, together with users from diverse scientific communities.

From Philadelphia, with its approximately 1,000 followers,<ref name=\"Malik and Hinnells, p. 93\">Malik and Hinnells, p. 93.</ref> branches of the Fellowship have spread throughout the United States and Canada,<ref name=\"Malik and Hinnells, p. 93\" /> as well as Australia and the UK. Societies of followers were already in Jaffna and Colombo,<ref name=\"Malik and Hinnells, p. 91\">Malik and Hinnells, p. 91.</ref> Sri Lanka, before his arrival in the USA. He is considered to be one of the few known [[Muslim saint]]s to be buried in the United States.\n\n==Early life==\nAccording to the older Sri Lankan students, Bawa Muhaiyaddeen emerged from the jungles of that country in the early 1940s and met pilgrims who were visiting shrines in the north. Reports of dreams or mystical meetings that preceded a 'physical' meeting by these early students were not uncommon.<ref name=\"Malik and Hinnells, p. 91\" />  According to an account from the 1940s, Bawa Muhaiyaddeen had spent time in '[[Kataragama]]', a jungle shrine in the south of the island, and in 'Jailani', a cliff shrine dedicated to '[[Abd al-Qadir al-Jilani]] of Baghdad. His association with that Shaikh indicates his connection to the [[Qadiriyya|Qadiri]] order of Sufism.<ref name=\"Malik and Hinnells, p. 91\" /> Many of his followers who lived around the northern town of Jaffna were Hindus and addressed him as swami or guru. His role was often as healer of both medical and spiritual illnesses, including curing demonic possession.<ref name=\"Malik and Hinnells, p. 91\" />\n\nEventually an ashram was formed in Jaffna, and a farm was started south of that city. After business travelers from the south of the country met Bawa Muhaiyaddeen, they invited him to visit in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. By 1967, the 'Serendib Sufi Study Circle' was formed by these Colombo students who were predominantly Muslims. Earlier in 1955, Bawa Muhaiyaddeen had set the foundations for a 'God's house' or mosque in the town of Mankumban, on the northern coast. This was the result of a spiritual meeting with Mary, the mother of Jesus.<ref name=\"Malik and Hinnells, p. 92\">Malik and Hinnells, p. 92.</ref>  After two decades, the building was finished by students from the United States who were visiting the Jaffna ashram.<ref>Malik and Hinnells, p 92.</ref> It was officially opened and dedicated on February 17, 1975.<ref>''The Tree That Fell to the West'', p. 171.</ref>\n\nBawa Muhaiyaddeen taught through the use of fables. These reflected the background of the student or listener and included Hindu, Buddhist, Jewish, Christian, Muslim and Sufi religious traditions; he welcomed persons from all traditions and backgrounds.<ref name=\"Malik and Hinnells, p. 92\" />\n\n==Work in the United States==\n[[Image:Fellowship-small.JPG|thumb|Bawa Muhaiyaddeen Fellowship]]\nIn 1971, Bawa Muhaiyaddeen accepted an invitation from an American woman to visit her in Philadelphia. She had been corresponding with him after being introduced by a university student from Sri Lanka. She and her associates made arrangements for his travel to the United States and for his stay in Philadelphia.<ref name=\"Malik and Hinnells, p. 92\" /> By 1973, a group of his followers formed the Bawa Muhaiyaddeen Fellowship, which hosted a meeting house that offered several public meetings a week.<ref name=\"Malik and Hinnells, p. 92\" />\n\nAs before in Sri Lanka, people from all religious, social and ethnic backgrounds would join to hear him speak. Across the United States, Canada and England, he won recognition from religious scholars, journalists, educators and world leaders. The United Nation's Assistant Secretary General, [[Robert Muller]], asked for Bawa Muhaiyaddeen's guidance on behalf of all mankind during an interview in 1974.<ref>''To Die Before Death'', p. xix.</ref> During the years 1978\u20131980 when the [[Iran hostage crisis|Iranian hostage crisis]] was occurring, he wrote letters to world leaders such as Iran's Khomeini, Prime Minister Begin, President Sadat and President Carter to encourage a peaceful resolution to the conflict in the region.<ref>Haddad and Smith, p 103.</ref><ref>''The Truth and Unity of Man: Letters in Response to a Crisis''</ref> [[Time Magazine]], during the crisis in 1980, quoted him as saying that when the Iranians understand the Koran \"they will release the hostages immediately\".<ref>Article ''Is the Ayatullah a Heretic?'' in the April 28, 1980 issue of ''Time Magazine''</ref> Interviews appeared in ''[[Psychology Today]]'',<ref>Article ''The Mind is in the Heart'' by [[Sam Keen]] in April, 1976 issue.</ref> the ''[[Harvard Divinity Bulletin]]'',<ref>Harvard Divinity Bulletin.

He continued his teaching and personal guidance to his students and visitors until his death on December 8, 1986.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn May, 1984, the [[Mosque of Shaikh M. R. Bawa Muhaiyaddeen]] was completed on the grounds of the Bawa Muhaiyaddeen Fellowship, [https://maps.google.com/maps?q=5820+Overbrook+Ave.,+Philadelphia,+PA 5820 Overbrook Avenue, Philadelphia].

Some titles originated from Sri Lanka before his arrival in the U.S. and were transcribed later. The Bawa Muhaiyaddeen Fellowship continues to study and disseminate this repository of his teachings.  It has not appointed a new leader or Sheikh to replace his role as teacher and personal guide.\n\nIn \"Blue-Eyed Devil\", [[Michael Muhammad Knight]] attempts to receive a message from Bawa Muhaiyaddeen in a dream, in a Sufi practice called [[Salat al-Istikharah]]. He travels to the [[Mazar (mausoleum)|mazar]] and attempts to sleep on the cushions, but is woken up by the groundskeeper and his attempt at istikhara is unsuccessful.<ref>\"Blue-Eyed Devil\", pg. 86-88.</ref>\n\n==Titles and honorifics==\nBawa Muhaiyaddeen was referred to as [[Guru]] or [[Swami]] or [[Sheikh]] or '[[His Holiness]]' depending on the background of the speaker or writer. He was also addressed as 'Bawangal' by those Tamil speakers who were close to him and who wanted to use a respectful address. He often referred to himself as an 'ant man',<ref>''The Tree That Fell to the West'', p. 165.</ref> i.e., a very small life in God's creation. After his arrival in the United States in 1971, he was most often addressed as Guru Bawa and he established the Guru Bawa Fellowship. By 1976, he felt that the title 'guru' had been abused by others who were not true teachers in his estimation. In that year, he decided to drop the title Guru and the organization became the Bawa Muhaiyaddeen Fellowship.<ref>''Truth and Light'', p. 10.</ref> Most of his American students use the familiar name 'Bawa' when speaking of him.\n\nBy 2007, an honorific, [[Qutub (Sufism)|Qutb]], was being used by his students in the publications of Bawa Muhaiyaddeen's talks.<ref>''The Point Where God and Man Meet'', p. xi.</ref> Qutb literally means pole or axis, and signifies the spiritual center which explains and reveals through divine wisdom the true nature of man.<ref>''Resonance of Allah'', p. 716.</ref> The name Muhaiyaddeen means 'the giver of life to true belief' and has been associated with previous Qutbs. By using this title, his students are presenting him as a universal teacher for this era.\n\n==Quotes==\n{{wikiquote}}\nA larger selection of quotes is available at [[q:Bawa Muhaiyaddeen|Wikiquote]].\n\n*\"The prayers you perform, the duties you do, the charity and love you give is equal to just one drop. But if you use that one drop, continue to do your duty, and keep digging within, then the spring of Allah's grace and His qualities will flow in abundance.\"<ref>''Sheikh and Disciple'', p. 63.</ref>\n*\"People with wisdom know that it is important to correct their own mistakes, while people without wisdom find it necessary to point out the mistakes of others. People with strong faith know that it is important to clear their own hearts, while those with unsteady faith seek to find fault in the hearts and prayers of others. This becomes a habit in their lives. But those who pray to Allah with faith, determination, and certitude know that the most important thing in life is to surrender their hearts to Allah.\"<ref>''Islam and World Peace'', p. 3.</ref>\n*\"The things that change are not our real life. Within us there is another body, another beauty. It belongs to that ray of light which never changes. We must discover how to mingle with it and become one with that unchanging thing. We must realize and understand this treasure of truth. That is why we have come to the world.\"<ref>'' Questions of Life Answers of Wisdom, Vol.1'', p. 220.</ref>\n*\"My love you, my children. Very few people will accept the medicine of wisdom. The mind refuses wisdom. But if you do agree to accept it, you will receive the grace, and when you receive that grace, you will have good qualities. When you acquire good qualities, you will know true love, and when you accept love, you will see the light. When you accept the light, you will see the resplendence, and when you accept that resplendence, the wealth of the three worlds will be complete within you. With this completeness, you will receive the kingdom of God, and you will know your Father. When you see your Father, all your connections to karma, hunger, disease, old age will leave you.\"<ref>''Come to the Secret Garden'', p. 188.</ref>\n*My grandchildren, this is the way things really are. We must do everything with love in our hearts. God belongs to everyone. He has given a commonwealth to all His creations, and we must not take it for ourselves. We must not take more than our share. Our hearts must melt with love, we must share everything with others, and we must give lovingly to make others peaceful. Then we will win our true beauty and the liberation of our soul. Please think about this. Prayer, the qualities of God, the actions of God, faith in God, and worship of God are your grace. If you have these, God will be yours and the wealth of the world to come will be yours. My grandchildren, realize this in your lifetime. Consider your life, search for wisdom, search for knowledge, and search for that love of God which is divine knowledge, and search for His qualities, His love, and His actions. That will be good. Amin. Ya Rabbal-'alamin. So be it. O Ruler of the universes. May God grant you this.\"<ref>''My Love you My Children; p. 466.''</ref>\n*\"God has a home inside of our heart.

From Philadelphia, with its approximately 1,000 followers,<ref name=\"Malik and Hinnells, p. 93\">Malik and Hinnells, p. 93.</ref> branches of the Fellowship have spread throughout the United States and Canada,<ref name=\"Malik and Hinnells, p. 93\" /> as well as Australia and the UK. Societies of followers were already in Jaffna and Colombo,<ref name=\"Malik and Hinnells, p. 91\">Malik and Hinnells, p. 91.</ref> Sri Lanka, before his arrival in the USA. He is considered to be one of the few known [[Muslim saint]]s to be buried in the United States.\n\n==Early life==\nAccording to the older Sri Lankan students, Bawa Muhaiyaddeen emerged from the jungles of that country in the early 1940s and met pilgrims who were visiting shrines in the north. Reports of dreams or mystical meetings that preceded a 'physical' meeting by these early students were not uncommon.<ref name=\"Malik and Hinnells, p. 91\" />  According to an account from the 1940s, Bawa Muhaiyaddeen had spent time in '[[Kataragama]]', a jungle shrine in the south of the island, and in 'Jailani', a cliff shrine dedicated to '[[Abd al-Qadir al-Jilani]] of Baghdad. His association with that Shaikh indicates his connection to the [[Qadiriyya|Qadiri]] order of Sufism.<ref name=\"Malik and Hinnells, p. 91\" /> Many of his followers who lived around the northern town of Jaffna were Hindus and addressed him as swami or guru. His role was often as healer of both medical and spiritual illnesses, including curing demonic possession.<ref name=\"Malik and Hinnells, p. 91\" />\n\nEventually an ashram was formed in Jaffna, and a farm was started south of that city. After business travelers from the south of the country met Bawa Muhaiyaddeen, they invited him to visit in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. By 1967, the 'Serendib Sufi Study Circle' was formed by these Colombo students who were predominantly Muslims. Earlier in 1955, Bawa Muhaiyaddeen had set the foundations for a 'God's house' or mosque in the town of Mankumban, on the northern coast. This was the result of a spiritual meeting with Mary, the mother of Jesus.<ref name=\"Malik and Hinnells, p. 92\">Malik and Hinnells, p. 92.</ref>  After two decades, the building was finished by students from the United States who were visiting the Jaffna ashram.<ref>Malik and Hinnells, p 92.</ref> It was officially opened and dedicated on February 17, 1975.<ref>''The Tree That Fell to the West'', p. 171.</ref>\n\nBawa Muhaiyaddeen taught through the use of fables. These reflected the background of the student or listener and included Hindu, Buddhist, Jewish, Christian, Muslim and Sufi religious traditions; he welcomed persons from all traditions and backgrounds.<ref name=\"Malik and Hinnells, p. 92\" />\n\n==Work in the United States==\n[[Image:Fellowship-small.JPG|thumb|Bawa Muhaiyaddeen Fellowship]]\nIn 1971, Bawa Muhaiyaddeen accepted an invitation from an American woman to visit her in Philadelphia. She had been corresponding with him after being introduced by a university student from Sri Lanka. She and her associates made arrangements for his travel to the United States and for his stay in Philadelphia.<ref name=\"Malik and Hinnells, p. 92\" /> By 1973, a group of his followers formed the Bawa Muhaiyaddeen Fellowship, which hosted a meeting house that offered several public meetings a week.<ref name=\"Malik and Hinnells, p. 92\" />\n\nAs before in Sri Lanka, people from all religious, social and ethnic backgrounds would join to hear him speak. Across the United States, Canada and England, he won recognition from religious scholars, journalists, educators and world leaders. The United Nation's Assistant Secretary General, [[Robert Muller]], asked for Bawa Muhaiyaddeen's guidance on behalf of all mankind during an interview in 1974.<ref>''To Die Before Death'', p. xix.</ref> During the years 1978\u20131980 when the [[Iran hostage crisis|Iranian hostage crisis]] was occurring, he wrote letters to world leaders such as Iran's Khomeini, Prime Minister Begin, President Sadat and President Carter to encourage a peaceful resolution to the conflict in the region.<ref>Haddad and Smith, p 103.</ref><ref>''The Truth and Unity of Man: Letters in Response to a Crisis''</ref> [[Time Magazine]], during the crisis in 1980, quoted him as saying that when the Iranians understand the Koran \"they will release the hostages immediately\".<ref>Article ''Is the Ayatullah a Heretic?'' in the April 28, 1980 issue of ''Time Magazine''</ref> Interviews appeared in ''[[Psychology Today]]'',<ref>Article ''The Mind is in the Heart'' by [[Sam Keen]] in April, 1976 issue.</ref> the ''[[Harvard Divinity Bulletin]]'',<ref>Harvard Divinity Bulletin.

He continued his teaching and personal guidance to his students and visitors until his death on December 8, 1986.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn May, 1984, the [[Mosque of Shaikh M. R. Bawa Muhaiyaddeen]] was completed on the grounds of the Bawa Muhaiyaddeen Fellowship, [https://maps.google.com/maps?q=5820+Overbrook+Ave.,+Philadelphia,+PA 5820 Overbrook Avenue, Philadelphia].  The building of the mosque took 6 months and nearly all the work was done by the members of the Bawa Muhaiyaddeen Fellowship under the direction of Bawa Muhaiyaddeen.<ref>Bawa Muhaiyaddeen Fellowship web-site.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Mazar-small.JPG|thumb|Mazar of M.R.

The center point of the farm is Bawa Muhaiyaddeen's [[mausoleum]] or mazar. It was begun shortly after his death and completed in 1987. It is a place of pilgrimage for Sufis and their [[Sheikhs]], as well as other Muslims and followers of other religions.<ref>Xavier, M.

Some titles originated from Sri Lanka before his arrival in the U.S. and were transcribed later. The Bawa Muhaiyaddeen Fellowship continues to study and disseminate this repository of his teachings.  It has not appointed a new leader or Sheikh to replace his role as teacher and personal guide.\n\nIn \"Blue-Eyed Devil\", [[Michael Muhammad Knight]] attempts to receive a message from Bawa Muhaiyaddeen in a dream, in a Sufi practice called [[Salat al-Istikharah]]. He travels to the [[Mazar (mausoleum)|mazar]] and attempts to sleep on the cushions, but is woken up by the groundskeeper and his attempt at istikhara is unsuccessful.<ref>\"Blue-Eyed Devil\", pg. 86-88.</ref>\n\n==Titles and honorifics==\nBawa Muhaiyaddeen was referred to as [[Guru]] or [[Swami]] or [[Sheikh]] or '[[His Holiness]]' depending on the background of the speaker or writer. He was also addressed as 'Bawangal' by those Tamil speakers who were close to him and who wanted to use a respectful address. He often referred to himself as an 'ant man',<ref>''The Tree That Fell to the West'', p. 165.</ref> i.e., a very small life in God's creation. After his arrival in the United States in 1971, he was most often addressed as Guru Bawa and he established the Guru Bawa Fellowship. By 1976, he felt that the title 'guru' had been abused by others who were not true teachers in his estimation. In that year, he decided to drop the title Guru and the organization became the Bawa Muhaiyaddeen Fellowship.<ref>''Truth and Light'', p. 10.</ref> Most of his American students use the familiar name 'Bawa' when speaking of him.\n\nBy 2007, an honorific, [[Qutub (Sufism)|Qutb]], was being used by his students in the publications of Bawa Muhaiyaddeen's talks.<ref>''The Point Where God and Man Meet'', p. xi.</ref> Qutb literally means pole or axis, and signifies the spiritual center which explains and reveals through divine wisdom the true nature of man.<ref>''Resonance of Allah'', p. 716.</ref> The name Muhaiyaddeen means 'the giver of life to true belief' and has been associated with previous Qutbs. By using this title, his students are presenting him as a universal teacher for this era.\n\n==Quotes==\n{{wikiquote}}\nA larger selection of quotes is available at [[q:Bawa Muhaiyaddeen|Wikiquote]].\n\n*\"The prayers you perform, the duties you do, the charity and love you give is equal to just one drop. But if you use that one drop, continue to do your duty, and keep digging within, then the spring of Allah's grace and His qualities will flow in abundance.\"<ref>''Sheikh and Disciple'', p. 63.</ref>\n*\"People with wisdom know that it is important to correct their own mistakes, while people without wisdom find it necessary to point out the mistakes of others. People with strong faith know that it is important to clear their own hearts, while those with unsteady faith seek to find fault in the hearts and prayers of others. This becomes a habit in their lives. But those who pray to Allah with faith, determination, and certitude know that the most important thing in life is to surrender their hearts to Allah.\"<ref>''Islam and World Peace'', p. 3.</ref>\n*\"The things that change are not our real life. Within us there is another body, another beauty. It belongs to that ray of light which never changes. We must discover how to mingle with it and become one with that unchanging thing. We must realize and understand this treasure of truth. That is why we have come to the world.\"<ref>'' Questions of Life Answers of Wisdom, Vol.1'', p. 220.</ref>\n*\"My love you, my children. Very few people will accept the medicine of wisdom. The mind refuses wisdom. But if you do agree to accept it, you will receive the grace, and when you receive that grace, you will have good qualities. When you acquire good qualities, you will know true love, and when you accept love, you will see the light. When you accept the light, you will see the resplendence, and when you accept that resplendence, the wealth of the three worlds will be complete within you. With this completeness, you will receive the kingdom of God, and you will know your Father. When you see your Father, all your connections to karma, hunger, disease, old age will leave you.\"<ref>''Come to the Secret Garden'', p. 188.</ref>\n*My grandchildren, this is the way things really are. We must do everything with love in our hearts. God belongs to everyone. He has given a commonwealth to all His creations, and we must not take it for ourselves. We must not take more than our share. Our hearts must melt with love, we must share everything with others, and we must give lovingly to make others peaceful. Then we will win our true beauty and the liberation of our soul. Please think about this. Prayer, the qualities of God, the actions of God, faith in God, and worship of God are your grace. If you have these, God will be yours and the wealth of the world to come will be yours. My grandchildren, realize this in your lifetime. Consider your life, search for wisdom, search for knowledge, and search for that love of God which is divine knowledge, and search for His qualities, His love, and His actions. That will be good. Amin. Ya Rabbal-'alamin. So be it. O Ruler of the universes. May God grant you this.\"<ref>''My Love you My Children; p. 466.''</ref>\n*\"God has a home inside of our heart.

They discuss the day's latest headlines, while usually tying in the show's theme of motherhood or at least parenthood, such as by giving their opinions \"through the eyes of mothers.\" The show also contains celebrity interviews and segments for mothers and parents in general.\n\n''The Talk'' is broadcast before a live studio audience at the [[CBS Studio Center]] in [[Studio City, California]] each Monday through Friday at 11:00 a.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]], and airs live on most CBS [[owned-and-operated station]]s and [[network affiliate|affiliates]] in the [[Eastern United States|Eastern]] and [[Central United States]] at 2:00 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]. The program is broadcast on [[broadcast delay|tape delay]] elsewhere from the [[Mountain Time Zone]] westward. The Friday shows are recorded on Thursday afternoons at 1:00&nbsp;pm PT for broadcast the next day. Friday shows are taped before the same studio audience in attendance for the earlier live Thursday broadcast.\n\n==Format==\n''The Talk'' has a format similar in style to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]''.  The opening segment of the broadcast is known as \"Everybody Talks\" and usually runs a combined 12 to 25 minutes over multiple segments, depending on the number of stories featured and the number of guests.  It is followed by topical discussion segments, involves the five-female host panel discussing current news items, typically focusing on [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] headlines, offbeat stories, and celebrity news. The program also actively incorporates [[social media]] to allow viewers to provide their opinions on the stories discussed through [[Twitter]] (using the hashtag #EverybodyTalks, or alternately the abbreviated #EVBT).  In season five, the program began allowing viewers to use [[Instagram]] to record and upload videos using the aforementioned hashtags, with one or two videos being selected to air on the live broadcasts.<ref>{{cite press release|title=CBS's \"The Talk\" Kicks Off Season 5 Monday, Sept. 8!|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2014/09/02/cbss-the-talk-kicks-off-season-5-monday-sept-8-45010/20140902cbs01/|publisher=CBS|via=The Futon Critic|date=September 2, 2014|accessdate=July 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn most editions, the \"Top Talker\" serves as the final segment of the topical discussion, featuring a rotating set of contributors - most of whom are correspondents/hosts of entertainment-related newsmagazine programs or magazines or hosts of local or syndicated radio programs - providing detailed analysis of a single trending, usually celebrity-related, story. Following the \"Everybody Talks\" segment, all five hosts interview one or two featured celebrity guests; most of these interviews are conducted at the set's roundtable. Musical performances are also occasionally included.\n\nThe show also regularly has a cooking segment two to four times each week, with two of the panelists - rotating between any combination of Chen, Underwood, Gilbert, or Osbourne - assisting in the preparation of the featured recipes with the guest chef. Product giveaways are also done once per week, as part of a segment showcasing fashion/beauty products and electronics that are given away to studio audience members for attending the show, and are often tied into online [[Deal of the day|flash sale]]s where the viewing audience can purchase the products offered at a reduced price.\n\nTo conclude the show through season 9, each episode signed-off with one of the co-hosts, primarily the moderator, saying \"Remember, it's always the right time to have ''The Talk!''\". With the start of season 10 the sign-off \"Let's Talk Tomorrow!\" or \"Let's Talk Later\" (used on Friday) is used.\n\n==Development==\nIn December 2009, CBS announced the cancellation of ''[[As the World Turns]]'' after 54 years, and was looking for a program to replace the long-running [[soap opera]] in its time slot. Sara Gilbert approached CBS about producing a pilot that would feature six women talking about the day's headlines with opinions told through \"the eyes of mothers.\"<ref name = Mothers />\n\nOn July 21, 2010, CBS announced that it had picked up the show (by then, given the title ''The Talk''), beating out several other contenders, including a cooking show featuring [[Emeril Lagasse]]; ''Say It Now'', a talk show featuring [[Valerie Bertinelli]] and [[Rove McManus]]; and a revamped version of the classic game show ''[[Pyramid (game show)|Pyramid]]'', hosted by [[Andy Richter]].<ref name=Mothers>{{cite web|title=Sara Gilbert talk show to replace veteran CBS soap|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/07/21/us-gilbert-idUSTRE66K5XA20100721|author=Georg Szalai|agency=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=September 19, 2012|date=July 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn the 4 weeks prior to the show's debut, new episodes of ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' and ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'', as well as repeats of ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'', aired in the timeslot vacated by ''As the World Turns''.\n\n==Co-hosts==\n\n=== Timeline ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width:\"100%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Co-host !!  colspan=10 style=text-align:center; | Seasons\n|-\n!! width=\"80\" | 1 !! width=\"80\" | 2 !! width=\"80\" | 3 !! width=\"80\" | 4 !! width=\"80\" | 5 !! width=\"80\"| 6 !! width=\"80\" | 7 !! width=\"80\" |8 !! width=\"80\" | 9 !! width=\"80\" | 10\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Julie Chen]]}} || colspan=\"8\" {{yes|}} || colspan=\"2\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Sara Gilbert]]}} || colspan=\"9\" {{yes|}} || colspan=\"1\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Sharon Osbourne]]}} || colspan=\"10\" {{yes|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Marissa Jaret Winokur]]}} || colspan=\"1\" {{yes|}} || colspan=\"9\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Holly Robinson Peete]]}} || colspan=\"1\" {{yes|}} || colspan=\"9\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Leah Remini]]}} || colspan=\"1\" {{yes|}} || colspan=\"9\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Aisha Tyler]]}} || colspan=\"1\" {{n/a|}} || colspan=\"6\" {{yes|}} || colspan=\"3\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Sheryl Underwood]]}} || colspan=\"1\" {{n/a|}} || colspan=\"9\" {{yes|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Eve (rapper)|Eve]]}} || colspan=\"7\" {{n/a|}} || colspan=\"3\" {{yes|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Carrie Ann Inaba]]}} || colspan=\"8\" {{n/a|}} || colspan=\"2\" {{yes|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Marie Osmond]]}} || colspan=\"9\" {{n/a|}} || colspan=\"1\" {{yes|}}\n|}\n\n===Season 1===\nThe original panel consisted of [[Sara Gilbert]], known for her role on the TV series ''[[Roseanne]]''; [[Holly Robinson Peete]], known for her roles on the TV series ''[[21 Jump Street]]'' and ''[[Hangin' with Mr. Cooper]]''; [[Leah Remini]], known for her role as Carrie Heffernan in the 1998\u20132007 CBS sitcom ''[[The King of Queens]]''; ''[[Big Brother (U.S.)|Big Brother]]'' hostess [[Julie Chen]]; and former talk show hostess/''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|X Factor]]'' judge [[Sharon Osbourne]], the wife of rocker [[Ozzy Osbourne]].

They discuss the day's latest headlines, while usually tying in the show's theme of motherhood or at least parenthood, such as by giving their opinions \"through the eyes of mothers.\" The show also contains celebrity interviews and segments for mothers and parents in general.\n\n''The Talk'' is broadcast before a live studio audience at the [[CBS Studio Center]] in [[Studio City, California]] each Monday through Friday at 11:00 a.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]], and airs live on most CBS [[owned-and-operated station]]s and [[network affiliate|affiliates]] in the [[Eastern United States|Eastern]] and [[Central United States]] at 2:00 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]. The program is broadcast on [[broadcast delay|tape delay]] elsewhere from the [[Mountain Time Zone]] westward. The Friday shows are recorded on Thursday afternoons at 1:00&nbsp;pm PT for broadcast the next day. Friday shows are taped before the same studio audience in attendance for the earlier live Thursday broadcast.\n\n==Format==\n''The Talk'' has a format similar in style to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]''.  The opening segment of the broadcast is known as \"Everybody Talks\" and usually runs a combined 12 to 25 minutes over multiple segments, depending on the number of stories featured and the number of guests.  It is followed by topical discussion segments, involves the five-female host panel discussing current news items, typically focusing on [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] headlines, offbeat stories, and celebrity news. The program also actively incorporates [[social media]] to allow viewers to provide their opinions on the stories discussed through [[Twitter]] (using the hashtag #EverybodyTalks, or alternately the abbreviated #EVBT).  In season five, the program began allowing viewers to use [[Instagram]] to record and upload videos using the aforementioned hashtags, with one or two videos being selected to air on the live broadcasts.<ref>{{cite press release|title=CBS's \"The Talk\" Kicks Off Season 5 Monday, Sept. 8!|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2014/09/02/cbss-the-talk-kicks-off-season-5-monday-sept-8-45010/20140902cbs01/|publisher=CBS|via=The Futon Critic|date=September 2, 2014|accessdate=July 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn most editions, the \"Top Talker\" serves as the final segment of the topical discussion, featuring a rotating set of contributors - most of whom are correspondents/hosts of entertainment-related newsmagazine programs or magazines or hosts of local or syndicated radio programs - providing detailed analysis of a single trending, usually celebrity-related, story. Following the \"Everybody Talks\" segment, all five hosts interview one or two featured celebrity guests; most of these interviews are conducted at the set's roundtable. Musical performances are also occasionally included.\n\nThe show also regularly has a cooking segment two to four times each week, with two of the panelists - rotating between any combination of Chen, Underwood, Gilbert, or Osbourne - assisting in the preparation of the featured recipes with the guest chef. Product giveaways are also done once per week, as part of a segment showcasing fashion/beauty products and electronics that are given away to studio audience members for attending the show, and are often tied into online [[Deal of the day|flash sale]]s where the viewing audience can purchase the products offered at a reduced price.\n\nTo conclude the show through season 9, each episode signed-off with one of the co-hosts, primarily the moderator, saying \"Remember, it's always the right time to have ''The Talk!''\". With the start of season 10 the sign-off \"Let's Talk Tomorrow!\" or \"Let's Talk Later\" (used on Friday) is used.\n\n==Development==\nIn December 2009, CBS announced the cancellation of ''[[As the World Turns]]'' after 54 years, and was looking for a program to replace the long-running [[soap opera]] in its time slot. Sara Gilbert approached CBS about producing a pilot that would feature six women talking about the day's headlines with opinions told through \"the eyes of mothers.\"<ref name = Mothers />\n\nOn July 21, 2010, CBS announced that it had picked up the show (by then, given the title ''The Talk''), beating out several other contenders, including a cooking show featuring [[Emeril Lagasse]]; ''Say It Now'', a talk show featuring [[Valerie Bertinelli]] and [[Rove McManus]]; and a revamped version of the classic game show ''[[Pyramid (game show)|Pyramid]]'', hosted by [[Andy Richter]].<ref name=Mothers>{{cite web|title=Sara Gilbert talk show to replace veteran CBS soap|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/07/21/us-gilbert-idUSTRE66K5XA20100721|author=Georg Szalai|agency=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=September 19, 2012|date=July 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn the 4 weeks prior to the show's debut, new episodes of ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' and ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'', as well as repeats of ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'', aired in the timeslot vacated by ''As the World Turns''.\n\n==Co-hosts==\n\n=== Timeline ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width:\"100%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Co-host !!  colspan=10 style=text-align:center; | Seasons\n|-\n!! width=\"80\" | 1 !! width=\"80\" | 2 !! width=\"80\" | 3 !! width=\"80\" | 4 !! width=\"80\" | 5 !! width=\"80\"| 6 !! width=\"80\" | 7 !! width=\"80\" |8 !! width=\"80\" | 9 !! width=\"80\" | 10\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Julie Chen]]}} || colspan=\"8\" {{yes|}} || colspan=\"2\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Sara Gilbert]]}} || colspan=\"9\" {{yes|}} || colspan=\"1\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Sharon Osbourne]]}} || colspan=\"10\" {{yes|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Marissa Jaret Winokur]]}} || colspan=\"1\" {{yes|}} || colspan=\"9\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Holly Robinson Peete]]}} || colspan=\"1\" {{yes|}} || colspan=\"9\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Leah Remini]]}} || colspan=\"1\" {{yes|}} || colspan=\"9\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Aisha Tyler]]}} || colspan=\"1\" {{n/a|}} || colspan=\"6\" {{yes|}} || colspan=\"3\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Sheryl Underwood]]}} || colspan=\"1\" {{n/a|}} || colspan=\"9\" {{yes|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Eve (rapper)|Eve]]}} || colspan=\"7\" {{n/a|}} || colspan=\"3\" {{yes|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Carrie Ann Inaba]]}} || colspan=\"8\" {{n/a|}} || colspan=\"2\" {{yes|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Marie Osmond]]}} || colspan=\"9\" {{n/a|}} || colspan=\"1\" {{yes|}}\n|}\n\n===Season 1===\nThe original panel consisted of [[Sara Gilbert]], known for her role on the TV series ''[[Roseanne]]''; [[Holly Robinson Peete]], known for her roles on the TV series ''[[21 Jump Street]]'' and ''[[Hangin' with Mr. Cooper]]''; [[Leah Remini]], known for her role as Carrie Heffernan in the 1998\u20132007 CBS sitcom ''[[The King of Queens]]''; ''[[Big Brother (U.S.)|Big Brother]]'' hostess [[Julie Chen]]; and former talk show hostess/''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|X Factor]]'' judge [[Sharon Osbourne]], the wife of rocker [[Ozzy Osbourne]].

It is based on the play ''Speaking In Tongues'' by [[Andrew Bovell]], which premiered at Sydney's [[Griffin Theatre Company]]. The film won seven [[AACTA Awards]] including [[AACTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]] and [[AACTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]].\n\n''Lantana'' is set in suburban [[Sydney]] and focuses on the complex relationships between the characters in the film. The central event of the film is the disappearance and death of a woman whose body is shown at the start of the film, but whose identity is not revealed until later. The film's name derives from the plant [[Lantana]], a weed prevalent in suburban Sydney.\n\n==Plot==\nA woman's body is shown in lantana bushes in a suburban garden.\n\nLeon, a policeman, and Jane have sex in a motel. They part, and Leon and his wife, Sonja, attend Latin dance classes that the recently separated Jane is also taking. Leon does not enjoy the classes. \n\nHe savagely beats a drug dealer during an arrest. He has emotional issues but refuses to confront or admit to them, while Sonja sees a therapist, Valerie, who has published a book on her daughter's recent murder. She and her husband, John, barely speak; he refers to their marriage as surviving on their grief. Valerie feels threatened by another patient, Patrick, who is having an affair with a married man, forcing her to confront her marital issues.\n\nJane purposely encounters Leon outside his station, and they have sex despite his reservations. Nik is upset at the relationship because he is friends with her estranged husband, Pete, who wants to return home. Jane pairs with Sonja in the next salsa class, angering Leon, who ends their arrangement, upsetting Jane. She invites Nik for coffee at Paula's behest, with whom she is friendly, and offers him money as they are struggling. Paula now starts disliking Jane.\n\nValerie, coming home late, crashes. Stranded, she calls John, unsuccessfully. She hails a vehicle but never makes it home. Leon is the investigating detective and searches her office. Surprised at seeing his wife's details, he takes a recording of their sessions, from which he learns that Sonja would not consider an affair a betrayal, but would if Leon didn't tell her. Leon arrives home late, but Sonja is awake. He asks her about her therapy. They discuss their relationship, and he says he just ended an affair but still loves her. Sonja is upset and feels betrayed. Leon sleeps on the couch. In the morning, Sonja says that he will be lucky if she returns home that night.\n\nLeon goes to John's house as he is the main suspect in his wife's disappearance. Leon starts discussing love, marriage and affairs, but lies to John when asked if he ever had an affair. Leon goes to Jane's house after she calls the police. Jane, late one night, saw Nik arrive home and throw something in the bushes. Later, she finds a woman's shoe there. Leon and Paula arrive and declare the shoe is Valerie's.\n\nThe police arrest Nik and he leaves his children with Jane. Police summon Paula for questioning. Neither Nik nor Paula knows that Jane called the police. Although Paula dislikes Jane, she thanks her for minding their children. The police interrogate Nik, but he refuses to answer questions about Valerie, repeatedly asking for Paula. Afterwards, Nik relaxes and talks with Leon and Paula. Valerie had car trouble and hailed Nik. He agreed to take her home but she panicked when he took a shortcut and jumped out, leaving her shoe. Paula goes to Jane's house for her children, where she tells her that Nik is innocent. Jane asks how she knows, and Paula says he told her. Jane asks if she can spend more time with the kids, but Paula forbids it after seeing how Jane went into her house and tidied it. Leon, Paula, Nik, and John go to where Valerie jumped out of the truck. They find her body, as she had fallen down a ravine. Leon listens to the rest of the therapy tape, where his wife says that she still loved him, and cries.\n\nLeon returns home and sees his wife outside. Jane salsa dances alone, drinking and smoking, and her husband leaves her. Patrick is pained to see his lover spending time with his wife and kids. Nik and Paula are spending time with their kids. The movie ends with Sonja and Leon dancing seductively. Leon, who found dancing with his wife difficult, now looks into Sonja's eyes and dances, just as she wanted. Sonja struggles to initially return Leon's gaze but does as the movie ends.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Anthony LaPaglia]] as Detective Leon Zat\n*[[Geoffrey Rush]] as John Knox\n*[[Barbara Hershey]] as Valerie Somers\n*[[Kerry Armstrong]] as Sonja Zat\n*[[Rachael Blake (Australian actress)|Rachael Blake]] as Jane O'May\n*[[Vince Colosimo]] as Nik D'Amato\n*[[Russell Dykstra]] as Neil Toohey\n*[[Daniella Farinacci]] as Paula D'Amato\n*[[Peter Phelps]] as Patrick Phelan\n*[[Leah Purcell]] as Claudia Weis\n*[[Glenn Robbins]] as Pete O'May\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nLantana opened on October 4, 2001 in Australia and December 14, 2001 in North America in 6 theaters.

It is based on the play ''Speaking In Tongues'' by [[Andrew Bovell]], which premiered at Sydney's [[Griffin Theatre Company]]. The film won seven [[AACTA Awards]] including [[AACTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]] and [[AACTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]].\n\n''Lantana'' is set in suburban [[Sydney]] and focuses on the complex relationships between the characters in the film. The central event of the film is the disappearance and death of a woman whose body is shown at the start of the film, but whose identity is not revealed until later. The film's name derives from the plant [[Lantana]], a weed prevalent in suburban Sydney.\n\n==Plot==\nA woman's body is shown in lantana bushes in a suburban garden.\n\nLeon, a policeman, and Jane have sex in a motel. They part, and Leon and his wife, Sonja, attend Latin dance classes that the recently separated Jane is also taking. Leon does not enjoy the classes. \n\nHe savagely beats an arrested drug dealer. He has emotional issues but refuses to confront or admit to them, while Sonja sees a therapist, Valerie, who has published a book on her daughter's recent murder. She and her husband, John, barely speak; he refers to their marriage as surviving on their grief. Valerie feels threatened by another patient, Patrick, who is having an affair with a married man, forcing her to confront her marital issues.\n\nJane purposely encounters Leon outside his station, and they have sex despite his reservations. Nik is upset at the relationship because he is friends with her estranged husband, Pete, who wants to return home. Jane pairs with Sonja in the next salsa class, angering Leon, who ends their arrangement, upsetting Jane. She invites Nik for coffee at Paula's behest, with whom she is friendly, and offers him money as they are struggling. Paula now starts disliking Jane.\n\nValerie, coming home late, crashes. Stranded, she calls John, unsuccessfully. She hails a vehicle but never makes it home. Leon is the investigating detective and searches her office. Surprised at seeing his wife's details, he takes a recording of their sessions, from which he learns that Sonja would not consider an affair a betrayal, but would if Leon didn't tell her. Leon arrives home late, but Sonja is awake. He asks her about her therapy. They discuss their relationship, and he says he just ended an affair but still loves her. Sonja is upset and feels betrayed.

{"title_page": "Transgressive (linguistics)", "text_new": "{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}\n\nIn [[Morphology (linguistics)|linguistic morphology]], a '''transgressive''' is a special form of [[verb]]. It expresses a coincidentally proceeding or following action. It is considered to be a kind of [[infinitive]], or [[participle]]. It is often used in [[Balto-Slavic languages]].\n\n==Czech language==\nThe transgressive (''transgresiv'' or ''p\u0159echodn\u00edk'') is a form of the verb in the [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language]]s. Nowadays it is used only occasionally for [[art]]istic purposes and in set phrases and idioms. Transgressives were still used quite widely in the literary language at the beginning of the 20th century. For example, [[Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek]]'s ''[[The Good Soldier \u0160vejk]]'' contains many of them.\n\nThe Czech language recognizes present and past transgressives (there are future transgressives as well). The present transgressive can express present or future action depending on the [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] of the verb from which it is derived.\n\n===Examples===\n* ''Usednuv\u0161i u okna, za\u010dala plakat.'' (When she sat by the window, she began to cry.) \u2013 past transgressive\n* ''D\u011bti, vidouce babi\u010dku, vyb\u011bhly ven.'' (The children, seeing grandma, ran out.) \u2013 present transgressive\n* ''Po\u0159\u00edd\u00ed si psa, aby byla, p\u0159ijdouc dom\u016f, p\u0159iv\u00edt\u00e1na''. (She will get a dog, in order to be welcomed by someone, whenever she comes home.) \u2013 future transgressive\n* ''Nedbaje sv\u00e9ho zdrav\u00ed, onemocn\u011bl.'' (He hasn't taken care of his health, so he has fallen sick.) \u2013 transgressive used as a preposition\n* ''B\u016fh - tak\u0159\u00edkaj\u00edc P\u00e1nu na\u0161emu.'' (God is the name of our Lord.) \u2013 transgressive used as an adverb\n\n==Slovak language==\nIn Slovak, only the present transgressive form exists, and it does not inflect for gender or number.\n\n==Polish language==\nIn Polish, transgressives are usually called \"adverbial participles\" (''imies\u0142owy przys\u0142\u00f3wkowe'') and inflect neither for gender nor for number. There are two kinds of such participles: anterior (only from perfective verbs) and contemporary (only from imperfective verbs). The anterior participle (related to the Czech past transgressive) expresses an event earlier than the event described by the main clause, while the contemporary adverbial participle expresses an event simultaneous with the event described by the main clause. Nowadays, especially the anterior participle is unused in the spoken language and rare in the written language.\n\nThe contemporary adverbial participle can be derived by adding the ending ''-c'' to the third-person plural present form of an imperfective verb (or by adding the ending ''-\u0105c'' to the present stem of an imperfective verb):\n\n''je\u015b\u0107'' \"to eat (imperf.)\" > 3pl ''jedz\u0105'' \"[they] are eating\" > ''jedz\u0105c'' \"(while) eating\"<br>\n''nie\u015b\u0107'' \"to carry (imperf.)\" > 3pl ''nios\u0105'' \"[they] are carrying\" > ''nios\u0105c'' \"(while) carrying\"<br>\n''czyta\u0107'' \"to read (imperf.)\" > 3pl ''czytaj\u0105'' \"[they] are reading\" > ''czytaj\u0105c'' \"(while) reading\"<br>\n''kupowa\u0107'' \"to buy (imperf.)\" > 3pl ''kupuj\u0105'' \"[they] are buying\" > ''kupuj\u0105c'' \"(while) buying\"\n\nThe verb ''by\u0107'' \"to be\" is the only exception \u2013 its contemporary adverbial participle is ''b\u0119d\u0105c'' and corresponds to its future form ''b\u0119d\u0105'' \"[they] will be\" rather than to its present form ''s\u0105'' \"[they] are\".\n\nThe anterior adverbial participle can be derived by replacing of the ending ''-\u0142'' in the third-person singular masculine past form of a perfective verb with the suffix ''-wszy'' (after a vowel) or ''-\u0142szy'' (after a consonant):\n\n''zje\u015b\u0107'' \"to eat (perf.)\" > ''zjad\u0142'' \"[he] ate\" > ''zjad\u0142szy'' \"having eaten\"<br>\n''przynie\u015b\u0107'' \"to bring (perf.)\" > ''przyni\u00f3s\u0142'' \"[he] brought\" > ''przyni\u00f3s\u0142szy'' \"having carried\"<br>\n''przeczyta\u0107'' \"to read (perf.)\" > ''przeczyta\u0142'' \"[he] read\" > ''przeczytawszy'' \"having read\"<br>\n''kupi\u0107'' \"to buy (perf.)\" > ''kupi\u0142'' \"[he] bought\" > ''kupiwszy'' \"having bought\"<br>\n''pchn\u0105\u0107'' \"to push (perf.)\" > ''pchn\u0105\u0142'' \"[he] pushed\" > ''pchn\u0105wszy'' \"having pushed\"\n\n==Serbo-Croatian language==\nIn all varieties of [[Serbo-Croatian]], the transgressive forms are called \"verbal adverbs\" (''glagolski prilozi'', singular: ''glagolski prilog''). They are common in literature and other written works, while in spoken language simple present or past tense constructions are usually used instead. They are formed similarly to the Czech and Polish transgressives. Examples are given in [[Gaj's Latin alphabet]] and [[Ijekavian]] pronunciation.\n\nThe present verbal adverb (''glagolski prilog sada\u0161nji'') is formed by adding the ending ''-\u0107i'' to the third-person plural present form of an imperfective verb:\n\n''pjevati'' \"to sing\" (imperf.) > 3pl ''pjevaju'' \"[they] sing/are singing\" > ''pjevaju\u0107i'' \"(while) singing\"<br>\n''ljubiti'' \"to kiss\" (imperf.) > 3pl ''ljube'' \"[they] kiss/are kissing\" > ''ljube\u0107i'' \"(while) kissing\"\n\nThe past verbal adverb (''glagolski prilog pro\u0161li'') is formed by adding the ending ''-v\u0161i'' to the infinitive stem of a perfective verb:\n\n''otpjevati'' \"to sing\" (perf.) > ''otpjeva-'' infinitive stem > ''otpjevav\u0161i'' \"having sung\"<br>\n''poljubiti'' \"to kiss\" (perf.) > ''poljubi-'' infinitive stem > ''poljubiv\u0161i'' \"having kissed\"\n\nSome perfective verbs have irregular past verbal adverbs, for example ''do\u0107i'' \"to come (perf.) > ''do\u0161av\u0161i'' \"having come\".\n\nThe auxiliary verbs can be both perfective and imperfective. The verb ''biti'' \"to be\" has the present verbal adverb ''budu\u0107i'' and the past verbal adverb ''biv\u0161i'', and the verb ''htjeti'' \"to want\"  has the present verbal adverb ''htiju\u0107i'' or ''hote\u0107i'' and the past verbal adverb ''htjev\u0161i'' or ''hotjev\u0161i''.\n\nThe past verbal adverb can also be used to describe a way how something was done, for example for the verb ''baciti'' \"to throw\", the past verbal form ''baciv\u0161i'' can mean \"by throwing\", for example ''po\u010dinio je samoubojstvo baciv\u0161i se sa zgrade'' \"he committed suicide by throwing himself off the building\".\n\n==Baltic languages==\nBoth [[Baltic languages]] have multiple transgressive forms most of which are used very actively in all types of modern speech.\n\n===Lithuanian language===\n[[Lithuanian grammar#Adverbial participles|Lithuanian]] has the following transgressive forms:\n\n'''1.''' The gerund (Lith. \"pusdalyvis\"), used with verbs in all tenses to render an action '''done by the sentence subject''' simultaneously with the action of the main verb:\n\n'''Examples:'''\n* '''''Dainuodamas''' jis nieko negirdi.'' \u2013 While singing, he doesn't hear anything.\n* '''''Ra\u0161ydama''' lai\u0161k\u0105, ji visi\u0161kai pamir\u0161o verdan\u010di\u0105 sriub\u0105.'' \u2013 While writing a letter, she totally forgot about the boiling soup.\n\nThe gerund is formed by removing the infinitive ending \"-ti\" and adding the suffix \"-dam-\", as well as endings marking gender and number:\n* m.sg.

Two adverbial participles (Lith. \"padalyvis\") out of four (present adverbial participle and past simple adverbial participle), used with verbs in all tenses to render an action '''of which the sentence subject is not the agent''' and which takes place simultaneously with the action of the main verb (present adverbial) or before it (past simple adverbial):\n\n'''Examples:'''\n* '''''Va\u017eiuojant''' keliu netik\u0117tai i\u0161\u0161oko stirna.''

(past adverbial) \u2013 Bonuses will be paid out only having successfully carried out the project.\n\nThe adverbial participles are not conjugated and are formed by removing the ending of the respective tense and adding the suffix \"-ant(is)\" (present tense) or \"-us(is)\" (past simple tense):\n* present simple: ''-ant'', refl.

The \"-ot\" participle (Latvian \"divdabjis ar ''-ot''\"), used with verbs in all tenses to render an action which takes place simultaneously with the action of the main verb.

(The secondary action is performed by a different agent, thus the usage of \"-ot\" participle is obligatory).\n\nThe adverbial participles are not conjugated and are formed by taking the stem of the present tense and adding the suffix \"-ot\" or \"-oties\" (for reflexive verbs).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Adjectival participle]]\n* [[Adverbial participle]]\n* [[Non-finite verb]]\n* [[Participle]]\n* [[Gerund]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Transgressive (Linguistics)}}\n[[Category:Linguistic morphology]]\n[[Category:Czech language]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}\n\nIn [[Morphology (linguistics)|linguistic morphology]], a '''transgressive''' is a special form of [[verb]].

(The secondary action is performed by a different agent, thus the usage of \"-ot\" participle is obligatory).\n\nThe adverbial participles are not conjugated and are formed by taking the stem of the present tense and adding the suffix \"-ot\" or \"-oties\" (for reflexive verbs).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Adjectival participle]]\n* [[Adverbial participle]]\n* [[Non-finite verb]]\n* [[Participle]]\n* [[Gerund]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Transgressive (Linguistics)}}\n[[Category:Linguistic morphology]]\n[[Category:Czech language]]\n", "name_user": "Gelingvistoj", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLithuanian language:grammar", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgressive_(linguistics)"}
