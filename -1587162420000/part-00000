The transmitter, which used a homemade antenna mounted on a wooden pole, was located in a garage in [[Long Island City]], near the [[Queensborough Bridge]], and its 250 watts provided just enough power to reach midtown [[Manhattan]] and parts of [[Queens]].<ref>Ivan Veit, preface to Howard Taubman, ''The New York Times Guide to Listening Pleasure'' (NY: Macmillan and London: Collier-Macmillan, 1968), p. x.</ref> On December 3, 1936, W2XR became '''WQXR''', the cursive form of the letter \"Q\" mimics the number \"2\". An FM service, [[WQXR-FM|W2XQR]], was added in 1939. The [[North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement]] of 1941 formally extended the [[AM band]] to 1600&nbsp;kHz, ending the \"high-fidelity\" service but keeping all four original stations near their existing dial positions. WQXR was originally slated to move to 1600 as a five-kilowatt [[List of broadcast station classes|class III-A]] regional station, but was able to persuade the FCC to make it a class I-B station on 1560&nbsp;kHz instead.\n\n=== \"The radio station of ''The New York Times''\" (1944\u20131998) ===\nThe ''[[New York Post]]'' approached the company in the early 1940s about purchasing the stations.  Sanger said publicly that he would have preferred to sell to ''[[The New York Times]]'', and in early 1944,  the ''Times'' agreed to pay just over $1 million for ownership of Interstate Broadcasting Company.

(The ''Times'' continued to operate its radio stations under the Interstate Broadcasting name for many years, maintaining what its president called \"basic good-music policies,\"<ref>Ivan Veit, preface to Howard Taubman, ''The New York Times Guide to Listening Pleasure'' (NY: Macmillan and London: Collier-Macmillan, 1968), p. xi.

During some of its live concerts, it used two microphones positioned six feet apart. The microphone on the right led to its AM feed, and the one on the left to its FM feed, so a listener could position two radios six feet apart, one tuned to 1560 and the other to 96.3, and listen in stereo.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=DAgEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=en&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false \"More Air Hats in Stereo Ring\"].

WQXR-FM concentrated on longer classical works, while WQXR (AM) aired lighter Classical music and talk programs produced in conjunction with ''The New York Times''. While this plan gave Classical music fans in the New York area two options, it also increased expenses for the stations.\n\nIn 1971, the ''Times'' put WQXR-AM-FM up for sale. Many offers were received for the FM station, but none of the bids for 1560 AM were satisfactory to management. When the FCC agreed to waive rules prohibiting stations from simulcasting if they were broadcasting classical music, the ''Times'' took the WQXR stations off the market. Simulcasting was also allowed, for example, for [[WWRC|WGMS]] and [[WTOP-FM|WGMS-FM]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].\n\nOn December 2, 1992, the AM side broke away from the simulcast for good, changing to an [[traditional pop music|American popular standards]] format,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/wqew-succeeds-upholds-standards-article-1.693584 |title=WQEW Succeeds Upholds its Standards |work=[[New York Daily News]] |date=December 4, 1995 |accessdate=August 19, 2015 |last=Hinckley |first=David }}</ref> which was inaugurated by a live studio performance by [[Tony Bennett]]. The change came a few months after WNEW (1130 AM), New York's heritage popular standards station, announced an impending sale to [[Bloomberg L.P.]] and a format switch to business information with the new call letters [[WBBR]]. The format change at 1560 to standards happened 10 days before WNEW's transition. To reflect the heritage of both outlets, WQXR (AM) changed its call sign to '''WQEW'''. The station focused on a broad range of pop standards\u2013the format's foundation artists including [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Nat \"King\" Cole]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Dean Martin]] and [[Perry Como]], but also artists from the [[big band]] era (such as [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Artie Shaw]], [[Glenn Miller]], [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Duke Ellington]]); and non-[[rock-and-roll]] pop hits (by artists like [[Neil Diamond]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Bobby Darin]] and [[Pat Boone]], among others). Light rock'n'roll material such as the Turtles was also occasionally heard.\n\n=== Radio Disney (1998\u20132015) === \n[[Image:RadioDisney1560.png|right|thumb|Final Radio Disney logo for WQEW.]]\nAlthough initially successful, the station's advertising revenues were not spectacular, and older audience [[demographic]]s were deemed undesirable for long-term success. On December 3, 1998, the ''Times'' announced that WQEW would switch to [[Radio Disney]] after agreeing to what was initially an eight-year [[local marketing agreement]] term with [[the Walt Disney Company]] and its [[Cumulus Media Networks|ABC Radio]] subsidiary. The entire WQEW air staff, under orders to not discuss the pending changes on the air, was released on December 21; the station played [[Christmas music]] without announcers through the holiday.

The transmitter, which used a homemade antenna mounted on a wooden pole, was located in a garage in [[Long Island City]], near the [[Queensborough Bridge]], and its 250 watts provided just enough power to reach midtown [[Manhattan]] and parts of [[Queens]].<ref>Ivan Veit, preface to Howard Taubman, ''The New York Times Guide to Listening Pleasure'' (NY: Macmillan and London: Collier-Macmillan, 1968), p. x.</ref> On December 3, 1936, W2XR became '''WQXR''', the cursive form of the letter \"Q\" mimics the number \"2\". An FM service, [[WQXR-FM|W2XQR]], was added in 1939. The [[North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement]] of 1941 formally extended the [[AM band]] to 1600&nbsp;kHz, ending the \"high-fidelity\" service but keeping all four original stations near their existing dial positions. WQXR was originally slated to move to 1600 as a five-kilowatt [[List of broadcast station classes|class III-A]] regional station, but was able to persuade the FCC to make it a class I-B station on 1560&nbsp;kHz instead.\n\n=== \"The radio station of ''The New York Times''\" (1944\u20131998) ===\nThe ''[[New York Post]]'' approached the company in the early 1940s about purchasing the stations.  Sanger said publicly that he would have preferred to sell to ''[[The New York Times]]'', and in early 1944,  the ''Times'' agreed to pay just over $1 million for ownership of Interstate Broadcasting Company.

(The ''Times'' continued to operate its radio stations under the Interstate Broadcasting name for many years, maintaining what its president called \"basic good-music policies,\"<ref>Ivan Veit, preface to Howard Taubman, ''The New York Times Guide to Listening Pleasure'' (NY: Macmillan and London: Collier-Macmillan, 1968), p. xi.

During some of its live concerts, it used two microphones positioned six feet apart. The microphone on the right led to its AM feed, and the one on the left to its FM feed, so a listener could position two radios six feet apart, one tuned to 1560 and the other to 96.3, and listen in stereo.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=DAgEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=en&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false \"More Air Hats in Stereo Ring\"].

WQXR-FM concentrated on longer classical works, while WQXR (AM) aired lighter Classical music and talk programs produced in conjunction with ''The New York Times''. While this plan gave Classical music fans in the New York area two options, it also increased expenses for the stations.\n\nIn 1971, the ''Times'' put WQXR-AM-FM up for sale. Many offers were received for the FM station, but none of the bids for 1560 AM were satisfactory to management. When the FCC agreed to waive rules prohibiting stations from simulcasting if they were broadcasting classical music, the ''Times'' took the WQXR stations off the market. Simulcasting was also allowed, for example, for [[WWRC|WGMS]] and [[WTOP-FM|WGMS-FM]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].\n\nOn December 2, 1992, the AM side broke away from the simulcast for good, changing to an [[traditional pop music|American popular standards]] format,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/wqew-succeeds-upholds-standards-article-1.693584 |title=WQEW Succeeds Upholds its Standards |work=[[New York Daily News]] |date=December 4, 1995 |accessdate=August 19, 2015 |last=Hinckley |first=David }}</ref> which was inaugurated by a live studio performance by [[Tony Bennett]]. The change came a few months after WNEW (1130 AM), New York's heritage popular standards station, announced an impending sale to [[Bloomberg L.P.]] and a format switch to business information with the new call letters [[WBBR]]. The format change at 1560 to standards happened 10 days before WNEW's transition. To reflect the heritage of both outlets, WQXR (AM) changed its call sign to '''WQEW'''. The station focused on a broad range of pop standards\u2013the format's foundation artists including [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Nat \"King\" Cole]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Dean Martin]] and [[Perry Como]], but also artists from the [[big band]] era (such as [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Artie Shaw]], [[Glenn Miller]], [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Duke Ellington]]); and non-[[rock-and-roll]] pop hits (by artists like [[Neil Diamond]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Bobby Darin]] and [[Pat Boone]], among others). Light rock'n'roll material such as the Turtles was also occasionally heard.\n\n=== Radio Disney (1998\u20132015) === \n[[Image:RadioDisney1560.png|200px|right|thumb|Final Radio Disney logo for WQEW.]]\nAlthough initially successful, the station's advertising revenues were not spectacular, and older audience [[demographic]]s were deemed undesirable for long-term success. On December 3, 1998, the ''Times'' announced that WQEW would switch to [[Radio Disney]] after agreeing to what was initially an eight-year [[local marketing agreement]] term with [[the Walt Disney Company]] and its [[Cumulus Media Networks|ABC Radio]] subsidiary. The entire WQEW air staff, under orders to not discuss the pending changes on the air, was released on December 21; the station played [[Christmas music]] without announcers through the holiday.
