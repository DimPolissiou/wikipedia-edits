The [[sequel]] to 2009's ''[[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (film)|Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs]]'' (which in turn was loosely based on [[Judi Barrett|Judi]] and [[Ron Barrett]]'s [[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs|book of the same name]]), the film was directed by [[Cody Cameron]] and Kris Pearn with [[Phil Lord and Christopher Miller]] returning as executive producers. [[Bill Hader]], [[Anna Faris]], [[James Caan]], [[Andy Samberg]], [[Neil Patrick Harris]], and [[Benjamin Bratt]] reprise their roles from the first film, while [[Will Forte]], who voiced Joseph Towne in the first film, voices Chester V. in this one. New cast members includes [[Kristen Schaal]] as orangutan Barb and [[Terry Crews]] as Officer Earl, replacing [[Mr. T]] in the role.<ref name=EW /> The film's plot involves Flint Lockwood and his friends returning to Chewandswallow to save the world after the presumably-destroyed FLDSMDFR reawakens, this time producing sentient food animals. ''Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2'' was released in the United States on September 27, 2013,<ref name=Deadline2013Date /> and grossed over $274 million worldwide against its budget of $78 million.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins where the previous film left off, inventor Flint Lockwood and his friends celebrate their success of saving the world from the food storm created by the \"Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator\" (FLDSMDFR), but this has left their island home town of Swallow Falls covered in food. Super-inventor Chester V, the CEO of Live Corp and Flint's childhood idol, offers his company's services to clean the island and helps to relocate the population to nearby [[San Francisco|San Franjose]], [[California]]. Chester also invites Flint to work at Live Corp. During his short tenure at Live Corp for 6 months, Flint attempts to become a Thinkuanaut, only to humiliate himself during his presentation.\n\nChester shows Flint that the island is flourishing with sentient food created by the FLDSMDFR (which is revealed to have survived the explosion and is still functioning) in the form of food animals (foodimals), and that some are trying to swim from the island, potentially threatening the world. Chester tells Flint he needs to travel to the island, find the FLDSMDFR, and insert a special USB device into it to destroy it and end the threat. Though the mission is meant to be classified, Flint invites his friends to help: his girlfriend and meteorologist Sam Sparks; her cameraman Manny; police officer Earl Devereaux; Steve, his pet monkey who communicates via a device on his chest; and his used-to-be bully, \u201cChicken\u201d Brent. He also grudgingly accepts the help of Tim, his widowed father, who takes them to the island by his fishing boat. When Chester learns that Flint is not alone, he and his assistant Barb, a super-intelligent orangutan, soon follow along with several Live Corp employees.\n\nWhile Tim stays with the boat, Flint and his friends work their way through the jungle-like environment that now covers Swallow Falls and encounter the numerous forms of foodimals, including a strawberry they call \"Barry\". Chester arrives shortly, offering to help Flint. Sam becomes suspicious of Chester's motives, as his claims that the foodimals are dangerous and do not align with what they have observed already. Flint refuses to accept Sam's statements, resulting in a heartbreaking argument between the couple and she and the rest of Flint's friends leave on their own, eventually getting captured by the Live Corp employees after discovering Live Corp's antagonism.\n\nFlint, Barb and Chester track down and locate the FLDSMDFR. As Flint is about to insert the USB device, the sentient machine creates a baby marshmallow, showing Flint its newfound love of creating foodimals, and that it has changed. Flint recognizes the mistake he almost made, as the machine, which attached itself to the island's ecosystem and altered it in the process, is acting as a brain to all the foodimals on the island and it is not dangerous to them in any way. He refuses to use the USB device, but Chester forces his hand, and with the device, is able to seize control of the FLDSMDFR. Chester announces his plan to use it to create more foodimals, and with those and the ones being captured on the island as they speak, he will make food bars out of them. Chester knocks Flint into a river, where he is rescued by the marshmallows and reunites with Tim. Without the FLDSMDFR, he and his father find that the existing foodimals on the island are unable to produce new foodimals and flourish. As Flint offers his condolences to the endangered foodimals, he is surprised to discover that the foodimals, having watched footage of Flint inventing the FLDSMDFR, have begun to worship him as their creator. Inspired, Flint vows to get his machine back with the help of Berry and the rest of the foodimals.\n\nTim helps Flint and Berry sneak into the Live Corp base. As Berry frees the foodimals, Flint challenges Chester to turn over the FLDSMDFR, but Chester threatens to [[Human cannibalism|use his friends in his food bar processing machine]]. Flint is able to use his inventions to beat Chester and free his friends, along with Barb's help after Chester shows how little respect he has for her. Chester tries to escape, but he is devoured violently by a cheespider, killing him. Later, Flint returns the FLDSMDFR to the rock candy mountain where he found it and removes the USB device, successfully reactivating it. Doing this allows the machine to continue being sentient, and create foodimals at its own will. The foodimals continue to flourish naturally. Flint reconciles with Sam and Tim, who lets him try out fishing for the first time. It is shown during the credits that the residents of Chewandswallow had returned to their proper homes, adapting to the altered ecosystem and happily continuing their lives. The FLDSMDFR still continues its love of foodimal production, as they continue to flourish with the humans.\n\nIn a mid-credit scene, Barb develops a crush on Steve, attempting to ask him out on a date.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{multiple image\n|footer = Bill Hader, Anna Faris and Terry Crews at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] promoting ''Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2''.\n|footer_align = center\n|image1=Bill Hader, 2013 San Diego Comic Con-cropped.jpg\n|width1=70\n|image2=Anna Faris, 2013 San Diego Comic Con-cropped.jpg\n|width2=70\n|image3=Terry Crews, 2013 San Diego Comic Con-cropped.jpg\n|width3=70\n|header_align=center\n}}\n* [[Bill Hader]] as Flint: an [[inventor]] and Sam's boyfriend.<ref name=PRNewswireCast /> \n** Hader also voices the FLDSMDFR, as he did in the first movie.\n*** [[Bridget Hoffman]] as Young Flint Lockwood.

Pictures]] and [[Sony Pictures Animation]], animated by [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]], and distributed by [[Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group#Sony Pictures Releasing|Sony Pictures Releasing]]. The [[sequel]] to 2009's ''[[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (film)|Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs]]'' (which in turn was loosely based on [[Judi Barrett|Judi]] and [[Ron Barrett]]'s [[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs|book of the same name]]), the film was directed by [[Cody Cameron]] and Kris Pearn with [[Phil Lord and Christopher Miller]] returning as executive producers. [[Bill Hader]], [[Anna Faris]], [[James Caan]], [[Andy Samberg]], [[Neil Patrick Harris]], and [[Benjamin Bratt]] reprise their roles from the first film, while [[Will Forte]], who voiced Joseph Towne in the first film, voices Chester V. in this one. New cast members includes [[Kristen Schaal]] as orangutan Barb and [[Terry Crews]] as Officer Earl, replacing [[Mr. T]] in the role.<ref name=EW /> The film's plot involves Flint Lockwood and his friends returning to Chewandswallow to save the world after the presumably-destroyed FLDSMDFR reawakens, this time producing sentient food animals. ''Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2'' was released in the United States on September 27, 2013,<ref name=Deadline2013Date /> and grossed over $274 million worldwide against its budget of $78 million.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins where the previous film left off, inventor Flint Lockwood and his friends celebrate their success of saving the world from the food storm created by the \"Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator\" (FLDSMDFR), but this has left their island home town of Swallow Falls covered in food. Super-inventor Chester V, the CEO of Live Corp and Flint's childhood idol, offers his company's services to clean the island and helps to relocate the population to nearby [[San Francisco|San Franjose]], [[California]]. Chester also invites Flint to work at Live Corp. During his short tenure at Live Corp for 6 months, Flint attempts to become a Thinkuanaut, only to humiliate himself during his presentation.\n\nChester shows Flint that the island is flourishing with sentient food created by the FLDSMDFR (which is revealed to have survived the explosion and is still functioning) in the form of food animals (foodimals), and that some are trying to swim from the island, potentially threatening the world. Chester tells Flint he needs to travel to the island, find the FLDSMDFR, and insert a special USB device into it to destroy it and end the threat. Though the mission is meant to be classified, Flint invites his friends to help: his girlfriend and meteorologist Sam Sparks; her cameraman Manny; police officer Earl Devereaux; Steve, his pet monkey who communicates via a device on his chest; and his used-to-be bully, \u201cChicken\u201d Brent. He also grudgingly accepts the help of Tim, his widowed father, who takes them to the island by his fishing boat. When Chester learns that Flint is not alone, he and his assistant Barb, a super-intelligent orangutan, soon follow along with several Live Corp employees.\n\nWhile Tim stays with the boat, Flint and his friends work their way through the jungle-like environment that now covers Swallow Falls and encounter the numerous forms of foodimals, including a strawberry they call \"Barry\". Chester arrives shortly, offering to help Flint. Sam becomes suspicious of Chester's motives, as his claims that the foodimals are dangerous and do not align with what they have observed already. Flint refuses to accept Sam's statements, resulting in a heartbreaking argument between the couple and she and the rest of Flint's friends leave on their own, eventually getting captured by the Live Corp employees after discovering Live Corp's antagonism.\n\nFlint, Barb and Chester track down and locate the FLDSMDFR. As Flint is about to insert the USB device, the sentient machine creates a baby marshmallow, showing Flint its newfound love of creating foodimals, and that it has changed. Flint recognizes the mistake he almost made, as the machine, which attached itself to the island's ecosystem and altered it in the process, is acting as a brain to all the foodimals on the island and it is not dangerous to them in any way. He refuses to use the USB device, but Chester forces his hand, and with the device, is able to seize control of the FLDSMDFR. Chester announces his plan to use it to create more foodimals, and with those and the ones being captured on the island as they speak, he will make food bars out of them. Chester knocks Flint into a river, where he is rescued by the marshmallows and reunites with Tim. Without the FLDSMDFR, he and his father find that the existing foodimals on the island are unable to produce new foodimals and flourish. As Flint offers his condolences to the endangered foodimals, he is surprised to discover that the foodimals, having watched footage of Flint inventing the FLDSMDFR, have begun to worship him as their creator. Inspired, Flint vows to get his machine back with the help of Berry and the rest of the foodimals.\n\nTim helps Flint and Berry sneak into the Live Corp base. As Berry frees the foodimals, Flint challenges Chester to turn over the FLDSMDFR, but Chester threatens to [[Human cannibalism|use his friends in his food bar processing machine]]. Flint is able to use his inventions to beat Chester and free his friends, along with Barb's help after Chester shows how little respect he has for her. Chester tries to escape, but he is devoured violently by a cheespider, killing him. Later, Flint returns the FLDSMDFR to the rock candy mountain where he found it and removes the USB device, successfully reactivating it. Doing this allows the machine to continue being sentient, and create foodimals at its own will. The foodimals continue to flourish naturally. Flint reconciles with Sam and Tim, who lets him try out fishing for the first time. It is shown during the credits that the residents of Chewandswallow had returned to their proper homes, adapting to the altered ecosystem and happily continuing their lives. The FLDSMDFR still continues its love of foodimal production, as they continue to flourish with the humans.\n\nIn a mid-credit scene, Barb develops a crush on Steve, attempting to ask him out on a date.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{multiple image\n|footer = Bill Hader, Anna Faris and Terry Crews at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] promoting ''Cloudy with a Chance of Meatball 2''.\n|footer_align = center\n|image1=Bill Hader, 2013 San Diego Comic Con-cropped.jpg\n|width1=70\n|image2=Anna Faris, 2013 San Diego Comic Con-cropped.jpg\n|width2=70\n|image3=Terry Crews, 2013 San Diego Comic Con-cropped.jpg\n|width3=70\n|header_align=center\n}}\n* [[Bill Hader]] as Flint: an [[inventor]] and Sam's boyfriend.<ref name=PRNewswireCast /> \n** Hader also voices the FLDSMDFR, as he did in the first movie.\n*** [[Bridget Hoffman]] as Young Flint Lockwood.
