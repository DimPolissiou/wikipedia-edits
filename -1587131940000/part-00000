Located within the city limits of Madrid, it is just {{convert|9|km|0|abbr=on}} from the city's financial district and {{convert|13|km|0|abbr=on}} northeast of the [[Puerta del Sol]] or [[Plaza Mayor, Madrid|Plaza Mayor de Madrid]], Madrid's historic centre. The airport name derives from the adjacent district of [[Barajas (district)|Barajas]], which has its own metro station on the same rail line serving the airport. Barajas serves as the gateway to the Iberian peninsula from the rest of Europe and the world, and is a particularly key link between Europe and Latin America. The airport is the primary hub and maintenance base for [[Iberia Airlines|Iberia]] and [[Air Europa]]. Consequently, Iberia is responsible for more than 40% of Barajas' traffic. The airport has five passenger terminals named T1, T2, T3, T4 and T4S.\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\n\nThe airport was constructed in 1927, opening to national and international air traffic on 22 April 1931, although regular commercial operations began two years later. A small terminal was constructed with a capacity for 30,000 passengers a year, in addition to several hangars and the building of the Avi\u00f3n Club. The first regular flight was established by [[Lineas A\u00e9reas Postales Espa\u00f1olas]] (LAPE) with its route to [[Barcelona]]. In the 1930s, flights started to serve some European and African destinations, the first international flights from the airport.\n\nOriginally, the flight field was a large circle bordered in white with the name of Madrid in its interior, unpaved, consisting of land covered with natural grass. It was not until the 1940s that the flight field was paved and new runways were designed. The first runway which started operation in 1944 was 1,400 metres long and 45 metres wide.<ref name=history>{{cite web| title=History| url=http://www.aena.es/en/madrid-barajas-airport/history.html| publisher=Aena| accessdate=30 June 2017}}</ref> By the end of the decade the airport had three runways, none of which exist today. In the late 1940s, scheduled flights to Latin America and the [[Philippines]] started.\n\nIn the 1950s, the airport supported over half a million passengers, increasing to five runways and scheduled flights to [[New York City]] began. The National Terminal, currently T2, began construction in 1954 and opened later that year. In the Plan of Airports of 1957, Barajas Airport is classified as a first-class international airport. By the 1970s, large jets were landing at Barajas, and the growth of traffic mainly as a result of tourism exceeded forecasts. At the beginning of the decade, the airport reached the 1.2 million passengers, double that envisaged in the Plan of Airports of 1957.\n\nIn the 1970s, with the boom in tourism and the arrival of the [[Boeing 747]], the airport reached 4 million passengers and began the construction of the international terminal (current T1). In 1974, [[Iberia Airlines|Iberia]], L.A.E. introduced the shuttle service between Madrid and Barcelona, a service with multiple daily frequencies and available without prior reservation.\n\nThe [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] brought significant expansion and modernisation of the airport's two existing terminals.<ref name=history/>\n\nIn the 1990s, the airport expanded further. In 1994, the first cargo terminal was constructed and the control tower was renovated. In 1997, it opened the North Dock, which is used as an exclusive terminal for Iberia's [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen]] flights. In 1998, it inaugurated a new control tower, 71 m tall and then in 1999 the new South Dock opened, which implies an expansion of the international terminal. During this time, the distribution of the terminals changed: The south dock and most of the International Terminal were now called T1, the rest of the International Terminal and Domestic Terminal were now called T2 and the north dock was called T3.\n\nIn November 1998, the new runway 18R-36L started operations (replacing the previous 18\u201336), 4,400 m long, one of the largest in Europe under expansion plans called Major Barajas. In 2000, it began the construction of new terminals T4 and its satellite, T4S, designed by architects [[Antonio Lamela]], [[Richard Rogers]] and [[]]. Two parallel runways to the existing ones were also built.\n\n===Development since the 2000s===\nThe new terminals and runways were completed in 2004, but administrative delays and equipment, as well as the controversy over the redeployment of terminals, delayed service until 5 February 2006.\n\nTerminal 4, designed by Antonio Lamela, [[Richard Rogers]] and [[Luis Vidal]], (winning team of the 2006 [[Stirling Prize]]) and [[Carillion|TPS Engineers]], (winning team of the 2006 [[IStructE Awards|IStructE Award]] for Commercial Structures)<ref>[http://www.carillionplc.com/news/news_story.asp?id=429 TPS expertise recognised at Madrid Terminal 4] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216211147/http://www.carillionplc.com/news/news_story.asp?id=429 |date=16 February 2012 }}</ref> was built by [[Ferrovial]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ferrovial.com/en/company/history/|title=History |publisher=Ferrovial.com |accessdate=30 June 2017}}</ref> and inaugurated on 5 February 2006. Terminal 4 is one of the world's largest [[airport terminal]]s in terms of area, with 760,000 square meters (8,180,572 square feet) in separate landside and airside structures. It consists of a main building, T4 (470,000 m\u00b2) and a satellite building, T4S (290,000 m\u00b2), which are approximately 2.5&nbsp;km apart. The new Terminal 4 is designed to give passengers a stress-free start to their journey. This is managed through careful use of illumination, with glass panes instead of walls and numerous skylights which allow natural light into the structure. With this new addition, Barajas is designed to handle 70 million passengers annually.\n\nDuring the construction of Terminal 4, two more runways (15L/33R and 18L/36R) were constructed to aid in the flow of air traffic arriving and departing from Barajas. These runways were officially inaugurated on 5 February 2006 (together with the terminals), but had already been used on several occasions beforehand to test flight and air traffic manoeuvres. Thus, Barajas came to have four runways: two on a north\u2013south axis and parallel to each other (separated by 1.8&nbsp;km) and two on a northwest\u2013southeast axis (and separated by 2.5&nbsp;km). This allowed simultaneous takeoffs and landings into the airport, allowing 120 operations an hour (one takeoff or landing every 30 seconds).\n\nTerminals 1, 2 and 3 are adjacent terminals that are home to [[SkyTeam]] and [[Star Alliance]] airlines. Terminal 4 is home to [[Iberia Airlines|Iberia]], its franchise [[Air Nostrum]] and all [[Oneworld]] partner airlines. Gate numbers are continuous in terminals 1, 2 and 3 (A1 to E89), but are separately numbered in terminal 4 (H, J, K and M, R, S, U in satellite building).\n\nThe Madrid\u2013Barcelona [[air shuttle]] service, known as the \"Puente A\u00e9reo\" (in Spanish), literally called \"Air Bridge\", used to be the busiest route between two EU airports<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.eurocontrol.int/press-releases/west-east-traffic-shift-continues-summer-2012| title=10 busiest airport pairs per number of daily flights| publisher=[[Eurocontrol]]| date=15 November 2012}}</ref> with 55 daily flights in 2012.<ref>{{cite press release| url=http://www.oag.com/oag/website/com/OAG+Data/News/Press+Room/Press+Releases+2007/OAG+reveals+latest+industry+intelligence+on+the+busiest+routes+2109072 |title=OAG reveals latest industry intelligence on the busiest routes| publisher=[[OAG (Air Travel Intelligence)|OAG]]| date=21 September 2007| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026110411/http://www.oag.com/oag/website/com/OAG%2BData/News/Press%2BRoom/Press%2BReleases%2B2007/OAG%2Breveals%2Blatest%2Bindustry%2Bintelligence%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bbusiest%2Broutes%2B2109072| archivedate=26 October 2007| df=dmy }}</ref> The schedule has been reduced since the February 2008 opening of the [[Madrid\u2013Barcelona high-speed rail line]] which covers the distance in {{frac|2|1|2}} hours.

Located within the city limits of Madrid, it is just {{convert|9|km|0|abbr=on}} from the city's financial district and {{convert|13|km|0|abbr=on}} northeast of the [[Puerta del Sol]] or [[Plaza Mayor, Madrid|Plaza Mayor de Madrid]], Madrid's historic centre. The airport name derives from the adjacent district of [[Barajas (district)|Barajas]], which has its own metro station on the same rail line serving the airport. Barajas serves as the gateway to the Iberian peninsula from the rest of Europe and the world, and is a particularly key link between Europe and Latin America. The airport is the primary hub and maintenance base for [[Iberia Airlines|Iberia]] and [[Air Europa]]. Consequently, Iberia is responsible for more than 40% of Barajas' traffic. The airport has five passenger terminals named T1, T2, T3, T4 and T4S.\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\n\nThe airport was constructed in 1927, opening to national and international air traffic on 22 April 1931, although regular commercial operations began two years later. A small terminal was constructed with a capacity for 30,000 passengers a year, in addition to several hangars and the building of the Avi\u00f3n Club. The first regular flight was established by [[Lineas A\u00e9reas Postales Espa\u00f1olas]] (LAPE) with its route to [[Barcelona]]. In the 1930s, flights started to serve some European and African destinations, the first international flights from the airport.\n\nOriginally, the flight field was a large circle bordered in white with the name of Madrid in its interior, unpaved, consisting of land covered with natural grass. It was not until the 1940s that the flight field was paved and new runways were designed. The first runway which started operation in 1944 was 1,400 metres long and 45 metres wide.<ref name=history>{{cite web| title=History| url=http://www.aena.es/en/madrid-barajas-airport/history.html| publisher=Aena| accessdate=30 June 2017}}</ref> By the end of the decade the airport had three runways, none of which exist today. In the late 1940s, scheduled flights to Latin America and the [[Philippines]] started.\n\nIn the 1950s, the airport supported over half a million passengers, increasing to five runways and scheduled flights to [[New York City]] began. The National Terminal, currently T2, began construction in 1954 and opened later that year. In the Plan of Airports of 1957, Barajas Airport is classified as a first-class international airport. By the 1970s, large jets were landing at Barajas, and the growth of traffic mainly as a result of tourism exceeded forecasts. At the beginning of the decade, the airport reached the 1.2 million passengers, double that envisaged in the Plan of Airports of 1957.\n\nIn the 1970s, with the boom in tourism and the arrival of the [[Boeing 747]], the airport reached 4 million passengers and began the construction of the international terminal (current T1). In 1974, [[Iberia Airlines|Iberia]], L.A.E. introduced the shuttle service between Madrid and Barcelona, a service with multiple daily frequencies and available without prior reservation.\n\nThe [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] brought significant expansion and modernisation of the airport's two existing terminals.<ref name=history/>\n\nIn the 1990s, the airport expanded further. In 1994, the first cargo terminal was constructed and the control tower was renovated. In 1997, it opened the North Dock, which is used as an exclusive terminal for Iberia's [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen]] flights. In 1998, it inaugurated a new control tower, 71 m tall and then in 1999 the new South Dock opened, which implies an expansion of the international terminal. During this time, the distribution of the terminals changed: The south dock and most of the International Terminal were now called T1, the rest of the International Terminal and Domestic Terminal were now called T2 and the north dock was called T3.\n\nIn November 1998, the new runway 18R-36L started operations (replacing the previous 18\u201336), 4,400 m long, one of the largest in Europe under expansion plans called Major Barajas. In 2000, it began the construction of new terminals T4 and its satellite, T4S, designed by architects [[Antonio Lamela]], [[Richard Rogers]] and [[]]. Two parallel runways to the existing ones were also built.\n\n===Development since the 2000s===\nThe new terminals and runways were completed in 2004, but administrative delays and equipment, as well as the controversy over the redeployment of terminals, delayed service until 5 February 2006.\n\nTerminal 4, designed by Antonio Lamela, [[Richard Rogers]] and [[Luis Vidal]], (winning team of the 2006 [[Stirling Prize]]) and [[Carillion|TPS Engineers]], (winning team of the 2006 [[IStructE Awards|IStructE Award]] for Commercial Structures)<ref>[http://www.carillionplc.com/news/news_story.asp?id=429 TPS expertise recognised at Madrid Terminal 4] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216211147/http://www.carillionplc.com/news/news_story.asp?id=429 |date=16 February 2012 }}</ref> was built by [[Ferrovial]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ferrovial.com/en/company/history/|title=History |publisher=Ferrovial.com |accessdate=30 June 2017}}</ref> and inaugurated on 5 February 2006. Terminal 4 is one of the world's largest [[airport terminal]]s in terms of area, with 760,000 square meters (8,180,572 square feet) in separate landside and airside structures. It consists of a main building, T4 (470,000 m\u00b2) and a satellite building, T4S (290,000 m\u00b2), which are approximately 2.5&nbsp;km apart. The new Terminal 4 is designed to give passengers a stress-free start to their journey. This is managed through careful use of illumination, with glass panes instead of walls and numerous skylights which allow natural light into the structure. With this new addition, Barajas is designed to handle 70 million passengers annually.\n\nDuring the construction of Terminal 4, two more runways (15L/33R and 18L/36R) were constructed to aid in the flow of air traffic arriving and departing from Barajas. These runways were officially inaugurated on 5 February 2006 (together with the terminals), but had already been used on several occasions beforehand to test flight and air traffic manoeuvres. Thus, Barajas came to have four runways: two on a north\u2013south axis and parallel to each other (separated by 1.8&nbsp;km) and two on a northwest\u2013southeast axis (and separated by 2.5&nbsp;km). This allowed simultaneous takeoffs and landings into the airport, allowing 120 operations an hour (one takeoff or landing every 30 seconds).\n\nTerminals 1, 2 and 3 are adjacent terminals that are home to [[SkyTeam]] and [[Star Alliance]] airlines. Terminal 4 is home to [[Iberia Airlines|Iberia]], its franchise [[Air Nostrum]] and all [[Oneworld]] partner airlines. Gate numbers are continuous in terminals 1, 2 and 3 (A1 to E89), but are separately numbered in terminal 4 (H, J, K and M, R, S, U in satellite building).\n\nThe Madrid\u2013Barcelona [[air shuttle]] service, known as the \"Puente A\u00e9reo\" (in Spanish), literally called \"Air Bridge\", used to be the busiest route between two EU airports<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.eurocontrol.int/press-releases/west-east-traffic-shift-continues-summer-2012| title=10 busiest airport pairs per number of daily flights| publisher=[[Eurocontrol]]| date=15 November 2012}}</ref> with 55 daily flights in 2012.<ref>{{cite press release| url=http://www.oag.com/oag/website/com/OAG+Data/News/Press+Room/Press+Releases+2007/OAG+reveals+latest+industry+intelligence+on+the+busiest+routes+2109072 |title=OAG reveals latest industry intelligence on the busiest routes| publisher=[[OAG (Air Travel Intelligence)|OAG]]| date=21 September 2007| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026110411/http://www.oag.com/oag/website/com/OAG%2BData/News/Press%2BRoom/Press%2BReleases%2B2007/OAG%2Breveals%2Blatest%2Bindustry%2Bintelligence%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bbusiest%2Broutes%2B2109072| archivedate=26 October 2007| df=dmy }}</ref> The schedule has been reduced since the February 2008 opening of the [[Madrid\u2013Barcelona high-speed rail line]] which covers the distance in {{frac|2|1|2}} hours.

The concept was a single-track rail tunnel with a service tunnel, but without shuttle terminals. The British government took no interest in funding the project, but the British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] did not object to a privately funded project, although she said she assumed it would be for cars rather than trains. In 1981, Thatcher and the French president [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] agreed to establish a working group to evaluate a privately funded project. In June 1982 the Franco-British study group favoured a twin tunnel to accommodate conventional trains and a vehicle shuttle service. In April 1985 promoters were invited to submit scheme proposals. Four submissions were shortlisted:\n* Channel Tunnel, a rail proposal based on the 1975 scheme presented by Channel Tunnel Group/France\u2013Manche (CTG/F\u2013M).\n* Eurobridge, a {{convert|35|km|abbr=on}} [[suspension bridge]] with a series of {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} spans with a roadway in an enclosed tube.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/?id=zhjOPdmyz1wC&lpg=PA17&pg=PA18#v=onepage |title=''New Scientist'' on Google Books |access-date=12 October 2019|last1=Information |first1=Reed Business |date=2 May 1985 }}</ref>\n* Euroroute, a {{convert|21|km|abbr=on}} tunnel between artificial islands approached by bridges.\n* Channel Expressway, a large diameter road tunnels with mid-channel ventilation towers.<ref name=\"Wilson pp. 14\u201321\"/>\n\nThe cross-Channel ferry industry protested under the name \"Flexilink\". In 1975 there was no campaign protesting against a fixed link, with one of the largest ferry operators (Sealink) being state-owned. Flexilink continued rousing opposition throughout 1986 and 1987.<ref name=\"Wilson pp. 14\u201321\"/> Public opinion strongly favoured a drive-through tunnel, but concerns about ventilation, accident management and driver mesmerisation led to the only shortlisted rail submission, CTG/F-M, being awarded the project in January 1986.<ref name=\"Wilson pp. 14\u201321\">Wilson pp. 14\u201321</ref> Reasons given for the selection included that it caused least disruption to shipping in the Channel, least environmental disruption, was the best protected against terrorism, and was the most likely to attract sufficient private finance.{{sfn|Foreign & Commonwealth Office|1994|p=5}}\n\n=== Arrangement ===\n[[File:Channel Tunnel project relations flow chart 1.svg|thumb|A block diagram describing the organisation structure used on the project. Eurotunnel is the central organisation for construction and operation (via a concession) of the tunnel]]\n\nThe British ''Channel Tunnel Group'' consisted of two banks and five construction companies, while their French counterparts, ''France\u2013Manche'', consisted of three banks and five construction companies. The role of the banks was to advise on financing and secure loan commitments. On 2 July 1985, the groups formed Channel Tunnel Group/France\u2013Manche (CTG/F\u2013M). Their submission to the British and French governments was drawn from the 1975 project, including 11&nbsp;volumes and a substantial environmental impact statement.<ref name=\"Wilson pp. 14\u201321\"/>\n\nThe design and construction was done by the ten construction companies in the CTG/F-M group. The French terminal and boring from Sangatte was done by the five French construction companies in the joint venture group ''GIE Transmanche Construction''. The English Terminal and boring from Shakespeare Cliff was done by the five British construction companies in the ''Translink Joint Venture''. The two partnerships were linked by a bi-national project organisation called [[TransManche Link]] (TML).<ref name=\"Wilson pp. 14\u201321\"/> The ''Ma\u00eetre d'Oeuvre'' was a supervisory engineering body employed by Eurotunnel under the terms of the concession that monitored the project and reported to the governments and banks.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.10\u201311\">Kirkland pp. 10\u201311</ref>\n\nIn France, with its long tradition of infrastructure investment, the project had widespread approval. The French National Assembly approved it unanimously in April 1987, and after a public inquiry, the Senate approved it unanimously in June. In Britain, select committees examined the proposal, making history by holding hearings away from Westminster, in Kent. In February 1987, the third reading of the Channel Tunnel Bill took place in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], and passed by 94&nbsp;votes to 22. The [[Channel Tunnel Act 1987|Channel Tunnel Act]] gained [[Royal assent]] and passed into law in July.<ref name=\"Wilson pp. 14\u201321\"/> Parliamentary support for the project came partly from provincial members of Parliament on the basis of promises of [[regional Eurostar]] through train services that never materialised; the promises were repeated in 1996 when the contract for construction of the [[Channel Tunnel Rail Link]] was awarded.<ref>{{cite web |title=Parliamentary note on the Channel Tunnel Rail Link |url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snbt-00070.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423162022/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snbt-00070.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 April 2010 |publisher=[[House of Commons Library]] |accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe tunnel is a build-own-operate-transfer ([[BOOT]]) project with a concession.<ref name=\"Flyvbjerg p. 96/97\">Flyvbjerg et al. pp.&nbsp;96\u201397</ref> TML would design and build the tunnel, but financing was through a separate legal entity, Eurotunnel. Eurotunnel absorbed CTG/F-M and signed a construction contract with TML, but the British and French governments controlled final engineering and safety decisions, now in the hands of the [[Channel Tunnel Safety Authority]]. The British and French governments gave Eurotunnel a 55-year operating concession (from 1987; extended by 10 years to 65 years in 1993){{sfn|Foreign & Commonwealth Office|1994|p=5}} to repay loans and pay dividends. A Railway Usage Agreement was signed between Eurotunnel, [[British Rail]] and [[SNCF]] guaranteeing future revenue in exchange for the railways obtaining half of the tunnel's capacity.\n\nPrivate funding for such a complex infrastructure project was of unprecedented scale.

Also visible is the segmented tunnel lining]]\n\nSurveying undertaken in the 20 years before construction confirmed earlier speculations that a tunnel could be bored through a chalk [[marl]] stratum. The chalk marl is conducive to tunnelling, with impermeability, ease of excavation and strength. The chalk marl runs along the entire length of the English side of the tunnel, but on the French side a length of {{convert|5|km|mi|0}} has variable and difficult geology. The tunnel consists of three bores: two {{convert|7.6|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter rail tunnels, {{convert|30|m|ft|0}} apart, {{convert|50|km|mi|0}} in length with a {{convert|4.8|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter service tunnel in between. The three bores are connected by cross-passages and piston relief ducts. The service tunnel was used as a pilot tunnel, boring ahead of the main tunnels to determine the conditions. English access was provided at Shakespeare Cliff, French access from a shaft at Sangatte. The French side used five [[tunnel boring machine]]s (TBMs), the English side six. The service tunnel uses Service Tunnel Transport System (STTS) and Light Service Tunnel Vehicles (LADOGS). Fire safety was a critical design issue.\n\nBetween the portals at Beussingue and [[Castle Hill, Folkestone|Castle Hill]] the tunnel is {{convert|50.5|km|mi|0}} long, with {{convert|3.3|km|mi|0}} under land on the French side and {{convert|9.3|km|mi|0}} on the UK side, and {{convert|37.9|km|mi|0}} under sea.<ref name=\"ICE p. 95\">Institute of Civil Engineers p. 95{{inconsistent|reason=The book has only 65 pages: please verify the source.}}</ref> It is the third-longest rail tunnel in the world, behind the [[Gotthard Base Tunnel]] in Switzerland and the [[Seikan Tunnel]] in Japan, but with the longest under-sea section.<ref name=\"Daily Post 2006\">{{cite news | first = Jane | last = Gilbert | title = 'Chunnel' workers link France and Britain |work=The Daily Post (New Zealand) | publisher=APN New Zealand Ltd | date = 1 December 2006 }}</ref> The average depth is {{convert|45|m|ft|0}} below the seabed.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.13\">Kirkland p. 13</ref> On the UK side, of the expected {{convert|5|e6m3|e6cuyd|lk=on}} of spoil approximately {{convert|1|e6m3|e6cuyd}} was used for fill at the terminal site, and the remainder was deposited at Lower Shakespeare Cliff behind a seawall, [[land reclamation|reclaiming]] {{convert|74|acre|ha|0}}<ref name=\"Anderson Story p xvi-xvii\"/> of land.<ref name=\"ICE p. 208\">Institute of Civil Engineers p. 208</ref> This land was then made into the [[Samphire Hoe Country Park]].

However, environmental objections were raised over a high-speed link to London.<ref name=\"Flyvbjerg p. 51\">Flyvbjerg et al. p. 51</ref>\n\n=== Geology ===\n[[File:Channel Tunnel geological profile 1.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Geological profile along the tunnel as constructed. For most of its length the tunnel bores through a chalk [[marl]] stratum (layer)]]\n\nSuccessful tunnelling required a sound understanding of the topography and geology and the selection of the best rock strata through which to dig. The geology of this site generally consists of northeasterly dipping Cretaceous strata, part of the northern limb of the Wealden-Boulonnais dome. Characteristics include:\n* Continuous chalk on the cliffs on either side of the Channel containing no major faulting, as observed by [[Verstegan]] in 1605.\n* Four geological [[stratum|strata]], marine sediments laid down 90\u2013100&nbsp;million years ago; pervious upper and middle chalk above slightly pervious lower chalk and finally impermeable [[Gault Clay]]. A sandy stratum, glauconitic marl (tortia), is in between the chalk marl and gault clay.\n* A {{convert|25|\u2013|30|m|adj=on}} layer of chalk marl (French: ''craie bleue'') in the lower third of the lower chalk appeared to present the best tunnelling medium. The chalk has a clay content of 30\u201340% providing impermeability to groundwater yet relatively easy excavation with strength allowing minimal support. Ideally the tunnel would be bored in the bottom {{convert|15|m|ft|0}} of the chalk marl, allowing water inflow from fractures and joints to be minimised, but above the gault clay that would increase stress on the tunnel lining and swell and soften when wet.<ref name=\"Eng Geol\">{{cite book | title = Engineering Geology of the Channel Tunnel | editor = Harris, C.S. | year = 1996 | publisher=Thomas Telford | location = London | isbn = 0-7277-2045-7 | page = 57 |display-editors=etal}}</ref>\n\nOn the English side, the stratum [[Strike and dip|dip]] is less than 5\u00b0; on the French side this increases to 20\u00b0. Jointing and faulting are present on both sides. On the English side, only minor faults of displacement less than {{convert|2|m|ft|0}} exist; on the French side, displacements of up to {{convert|15|m|ft|0}} are present owing to the Quenocs [[anticline|anticlinal]] [[fold (geology)|fold]]. The faults are of limited width, filled with calcite, pyrite and remoulded clay. The increased dip and faulting restricted the selection of route on the French side. To avoid confusion, microfossil assemblages were used to classify the chalk marl. On the French side, particularly near the coast, the chalk was harder, more brittle and more fractured than on the English side. This led to the adoption of different tunnelling techniques on the two sides.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.21\u201350\"/>\n\nThe Quaternary undersea valley Fosse Dangaered, and [[Castle Hill, Folkestone|Castle Hill]] landslip at the English portal, caused concerns. Identified by the 1964\u201365 geophysical survey, the Fosse Dangaered is an infilled valley system extending {{convert|80|m|ft|0}} below the seabed, {{convert|500|m|ft|0}} south of the tunnel route in mid-channel. A 1986 survey showed that a tributary crossed the path of the tunnel, and so the tunnel route was made as far north and deep as possible. The English terminal had to be located in the Castle Hill landslip, which consists of displaced and tipping blocks of lower chalk, glauconitic marl and gault debris. Thus the area was stabilised by buttressing and inserting drainage [[adit]]s.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.21\u201350\"/> The service tunnel acted as a pilot preceding the main ones, so that the geology, areas of crushed rock, and zones of high water inflow could be predicted. Exploratory probing took place in the service tunnel, in the form of extensive forward probing, vertical downward probes and sideways probing.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.21\u201350\">Kirkland pp. 21\u201350</ref>\n\n=== Surveying ===\nMarine soundings and samplings by Thom\u00e9 de Gamond were carried out during 1833\u201367, establishing the seabed depth at a maximum of {{convert|55|m}} and the continuity of geological strata (layers). Surveying continued over many years, with 166&nbsp;marine and 70&nbsp;land-deep boreholes being drilled and over 4,000-line-kilometres of marine geophysical survey completed.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.22\u201326\"/> Surveys were undertaken in 1958\u20131959, 1964\u20131965, 1972\u20131974 and 1986\u20131988.\n\nThe surveying in 1958\u201359 catered for [[immersed tube]] and bridge designs as well as a bored tunnel, and thus a wide area was investigated. At this time, marine geophysics surveying for engineering projects was in its infancy, with poor positioning and resolution from seismic profiling. The 1964\u201365 surveys concentrated on a northerly route that left the English coast at Dover harbour; using 70&nbsp;boreholes, an area of deeply weathered rock with high [[permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] was located just south of Dover harbour.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.22\u201326\"/>\n\nGiven the previous survey results and access constraints, a more southerly route was investigated in the 1972\u201373 survey, and the route was confirmed to be feasible. Information for the tunnelling project also came from work before the 1975 cancellation. On the French side at Sangatte, a deep shaft with [[adit]]s was made. On the English side at Shakespeare Cliff, the government allowed {{convert|250|m|ft|0}} of {{convert|4.5|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter tunnel to be driven. The actual tunnel alignment, method of excavation and support were essentially the same as the 1975 attempt. In the 1986\u201387 survey, previous findings were reinforced, and the characteristics of the gault clay and the tunnelling medium (chalk marl that made up 85% of the route) were investigated. Geophysical techniques from the oil industry were employed.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.22\u201326\">Kirkland pp. 22\u201326</ref>\n\n=== Tunnelling ===\n[[File:Eurotunnel schema (empty service).svg|thumb|Typical cross section, with the service tunnel between the two rail tunnels; shown linking the rail tunnels is a piston relief duct, necessary to manage changes in air pressure caused by the very fast movement of trains]]\n\nTunnelling was a major engineering challenge, with the only precedent being the undersea [[Seikan Tunnel]] in Japan, which opened in 1988. A serious health and safety risk with building tunnels underwater is major water inflow due to the high [[hydrostatics|hydrostatic pressure]] from the sea above, under weak ground conditions. The tunnel also had the challenge of time: being privately funded, early financial return was paramount.\n\nThe objective was to construct two {{convert|7.6|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-diameter}} rail tunnels, {{convert|30|m|ft|0}} apart, {{convert|50|km|mi|0}} in length; a {{convert|4.8|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-diameter}}  service tunnel between the two main ones; pairs of {{convert|3.3|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-diameter}} cross-passages linking the rail tunnels to the service one at {{convert|375|m|ft|0|adj=on}} spacing; piston relief ducts {{convert|2|m|ft|0}} in diameter connecting the rail tunnels {{convert|250|m|ft|0}} apart; two undersea crossover caverns to connect the rail tunnels,<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.63\u2013128\">Kirkland pp. 63\u2013128</ref> with the service tunnel always preceding the main ones by at least {{convert|1|km|mi|1}} to ascertain the ground conditions. There was plenty of experience with excavating through chalk in the mining industry, while the undersea crossover caverns were a complex engineering problem. The French one was based on the [[Mount Baker Tunnel|Mount Baker Ridge]] freeway tunnel in [[Seattle]]; the UK cavern was dug from the service tunnel ahead of the main ones, to avoid delay.\n\nPrecast segmental linings in the main TBM drives were used, but two different solutions were used. On the French side, neoprene and grout sealed bolted linings made of cast iron or high-strength reinforced concrete were used; on the English side, the main requirement was for speed so bolting of cast-iron lining segments was only carried out in areas of poor geology. In the UK rail tunnels, eight lining segments plus a key segment were used; in the French side, five segments plus a key.<ref name=\"Wilson p.38\">Wilson p. 38</ref> On the French side, a {{convert|55|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter {{convert|75|m|ft|0|adj=on}} deep grout-curtained shaft at Sangatte was used for access. On the English side, a marshalling area was {{convert|140|m|ft|0}} below the top of Shakespeare Cliff, the [[New Austrian Tunnelling method]] (NATM) was first applied in the chalk marl here. On the English side, the land tunnels were driven from Shakespeare Cliff \u2013 same place as the marine tunnels \u2013 not from Folkestone. The platform at the base of the cliff was not large enough for all of the drives and, despite environmental objections, tunnel spoil was placed behind a reinforced concrete seawall, on condition of placing the chalk in an enclosed lagoon, to avoid wide dispersal of chalk fines. Owing to limited space, the precast lining factory was on the [[Isle of Grain]] in the Thames estuary,<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.63\u2013128\"/> which used Scottish granite aggregate delivered by ship from the [[Foster Yeoman]] coastal super quarry at [[Glensanda]] in [[Loch Linnhe]] on the west coast of Scotland.\n\nOn the French side, owing to the greater permeability to water, earth pressure balance [[Tunnel boring machine|TBMs]] with open and closed modes were used. The TBMs were of a closed nature during the initial {{convert|5|km|mi|0}}, but then operated as open, boring through the chalk marl stratum.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.63\u2013128\"/> This minimised the impact to the ground, allowed high water pressures to be withstood and it also alleviated the need to grout ahead of the tunnel. The French effort required five TBMs: two main marine machines, one main land machine (the short land drives of {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=on}} allowed one TBM to complete the first drive then reverse direction and complete the other), and two service tunnel machines. On the English side, the simpler geology allowed faster open-faced TBMs.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.29\">Kirkland p. 29</ref> Six machines were used; all commenced digging from Shakespeare Cliff, three marine-bound and three for the land tunnels.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.63\u2013128\"/> Towards the completion of the undersea drives, the UK TBMs were driven steeply downwards and buried clear of the tunnel. These buried TBMs were then used to provide an electrical earth.

There are two sub-stations fed at 400 kV at each terminal, but in an emergency the tunnel's lighting (about 20,000 light fittings) and plant can be powered solely from either England or France.{{sfn|Foreign & Commonwealth Office|1994|p=9}}\n\nThe traditional railway south of London uses a 750&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC [[third rail]] to deliver electricity, but since the opening of [[High Speed 1]] there is no longer any need for tunnel trains to use the third rail system. High Speed 1, the tunnel and the [[LGV Nord]] all have power provided via overhead catenary at 25&nbsp;kV&nbsp;50&nbsp;Hz. The railways on \"classic\" lines in Belgium are also electrified by overhead wires, but at 3000&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC.<ref name=\"wiki_railelectric\"/>\n\n==== Signalling ====\nA cab signalling system gives information directly to train drivers on a display. There is a [[train protection system]] that stops the train if the speed exceeds that indicated on the in-cab display. [[Transmission Voie-Machine|TVM430]], as used on [[LGV Nord]] and [[High Speed 1]], is used in the tunnel.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.149\u2013155\">Kirkland pp. 149\u2013155</ref> The TVM signalling is interconnected with the signalling on the high-speed lines either side, allowing trains to enter and exit the tunnel system without stopping. The maximum speed is {{nowrap|160 km/h}}.<ref name=\"wiki_de-eurotunnel\">Article-de: Eurotunnel#Betrieb 9 August 2009</ref>\n\nSignalling in the tunnel is coordinated from two control centres:  The main control centre at the Folkestone terminal, and a backup at the Calais terminal, which is staffed at all times and can take over all operations in the event of a breakdown or emergency.\n\n==== Track system ====\n{{Technical|section|date=May 2014}}\nConventional ballasted tunnel-track was ruled out owing to the difficulty of maintenance and lack of stability and precision.  The Sonneville International Corporation's track system was chosen based on reliability and cost-effectiveness based on good performance in Swiss tunnels and worldwide. The type of track used is known as Low Vibration Track (LVT). Like ballasted track the LVT is of the free floating type, held in place by gravity and friction. Reinforced concrete blocks of 100&nbsp;kg support the rails every 60&nbsp;cm and are held by 12&nbsp;mm thick closed cell polymer foam pads placed at the bottom of rubber boots. The latter separate the blocks' mass movements from the lean encasement concrete. Ballastless track provides extra overhead clearance necessary for the passage of larger trains.<ref name=\"bonnett782\">Bonnett 2005, p. 78</ref> The corrugated rubber walls of the boots add a degree of isolation of horizontal wheel-rail vibrations, and are insulators of the track signal circuit in the humid tunnel environment. UIC60 (60&nbsp;kg/m) rails of 900A grade rest on {{convert|6|mm|1|abbr=on}} rail pads, which fit the RN/Sonneville bolted dual leaf-springs. The rails, LVT-blocks and their boots with pads were assembled outside the tunnel, in a fully automated process developed by the LVT inventor, Mr. Roger Sonneville. About 334,000 Sonneville blocks were made on the Sangatte site.\n\nMaintenance activities are less than projected. Initially the rails were ground on a yearly basis or after approximately 100MGT of traffic. Ride quality continues to be noticeably smooth and of low noise. Maintenance is facilitated by the existence of two tunnel junctions or crossover facilities, allowing for two-way operation in each of the six tunnel segments thereby created, and thus providing safe access for maintenance of one isolated tunnel segment at a time. The two crossovers are the largest artificial undersea caverns ever built; 150 m long, 10 m high and 18 m wide. The English crossover is {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=on}} from Shakespeare Cliff, and the French crossover is {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} from Sangatte.{{sfn|Foreign & Commonwealth Office|1994|p=14}}\n\n==== Ventilation, cooling and drainage ====\nThe ventilation system maintains the air pressure in the service tunnel higher than in the rail tunnels, so that in the event of a fire, smoke does not enter the service tunnel from the rail tunnels. Two cooling water pipes in each rail tunnel circulate chilled water to remove heat generated by the rail traffic. Pumping stations remove water in the tunnels from rain, seepage, and so on.{{sfn|Foreign & Commonwealth Office|1994|p=8}}\n\n=== Rolling stock ===\n[[File:TGV TMST 3011-2 - Sortie Tunnel sous la Manche \u00e0 Coquelles - Florian F\u00e8vre.JPG|thumb|Entrance to the tunnel near Coquelles, France]]\n\n==== Eurotunnel Shuttle ====\n{{Main|Eurotunnel Shuttle|Eurotunnel Class 9}}\n\nInitially 38&nbsp;Le Shuttle locomotives were commissioned, with one at each end of a shuttle train. The shuttles have two separate halves: single and double deck. Each half has two loading/unloading wagons and 12 carrier wagons. Eurotunnel's original order was for nine tourist shuttles.\n\n[[Heavy goods vehicle]] (HGV) shuttles also have two halves, with each half containing one loading wagon, one unloading wagon and 14&nbsp;carrier wagons. There is a [[Lounge car|club car]] behind the leading locomotive, where haulage drivers must stay during the journey.

By mid-1989 the price had risen to \u00a311.00. Delays and cost overruns led to the price dropping; during demonstration runs in October 1994 it reached an all-time low.

Financial restructuring of Eurotunnel occurred in mid-1998, reducing debt and financial charges. Despite the restructuring, ''[[The Economist]]'' reported in 1998 that to break even Eurotunnel would have to increase fares, traffic and market share for sustainability.<ref name=\"Flyvbjerg p. 32\u201334\">Flyvbjerg et al. pp. 32\u201334</ref> A cost benefit analysis of the tunnel indicated that there were few impacts on the wider economy and few developments associated with the project, and that the British economy would have been better off if it had not been constructed.<ref name=\"Anguera 2006\"/><ref name=\"Flyvbjerg\">{{cite book |author1=Flyvbjerg, B.

There are [[juxtaposed controls]], meaning that passports are checked before boarding first by officials belonging to departing country and then officials of the destination country. These are placed only at the main Eurostar stations: French officials operate at [[St Pancras railway station|London St Pancras]], [[Ebbsfleet International railway station|Ebbsfleet International]] and [[Ashford International railway station|Ashford International]], while British officials operate at [[Gare de Calais-Fr\u00e9thun|Calais-Fr\u00e9thun]], [[Lille-Europe]], [[Brussels-South railway station|Brussels-South]] and [[Gare du Nord|Paris-Gare du Nord]].  There are security checks before boarding as well. For the shuttle road-vehicle trains, there are juxtaposed passport controls before boarding the trains.\n\nFor Eurostar trains travelling from places south of Paris, there is no passport and security check before departure, and those trains must stop in Lille at least 30 minutes to allow all passengers to be checked. No checks are done on board. There have been plans for services from [[Amsterdam]], [[Frankfurt]] and [[Cologne]] to London, but a major reason to cancel them was the need for a stop in Lille. A direct service from London to Amsterdam started on 4 April 2018; following the building of check-in terminals at Amsterdam and Rotterdam and intergovernmental agreement, a direct service from the two Dutch cities to London will start on 30 April 2020.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe reason for juxtaposed controls is a wish to prevent illegal immigration before reaching British soil, and because a check of all passengers on a train can take 30 minutes, which creates long queues if done at arrival.\n\n===No-deal Brexit plan===\n\nUnder a planned legislation which was published on 12 February 2019, it will give the UK and France time to renegotiate the terms under which the railway service operates. Trains will be permitted to use the Channel Tunnel for three months if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, under a proposed [[European Commission]] law.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-47215904|title=Brexit: No-deal plan for Channel Tunnel operations|work=BBC News|date=12 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Terminals ==\n{{Main|Eurotunnel Calais Terminal|Eurotunnel Folkestone Terminal}}\n\n[[File:Chargement voiture Eurotunnel.jpg|thumb|Car being driven onto a shuttle carriage at the French terminal in [[Coquelles]]]]\n\nThe terminals' sites are at [[Cheriton, Kent|Cheriton]] (near Folkestone in the United Kingdom) and [[Coquelles]] (near Calais in France). The terminals are designed to transfer vehicles from the motorway onto trains at a rate of 700&nbsp;cars and 113&nbsp;heavy vehicles per hour.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} The UK site uses the [[M20 motorway]] for access. The terminals are organised with the frontier controls juxtaposed with the entry to the system to allow travellers to go onto the motorway at the destination country immediately after leaving the shuttle. The area of the UK site was severely constrained and the design was challenging.\n\nThe French layout was achieved more easily. To achieve design output, the shuttles accept cars on double-deck wagons; for flexibility, ramps were placed inside the shuttles to provide access to the top decks.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.255\u2013270\">Kirkland pp. 255\u2013270</ref> At Folkestone there are {{convert|20|km|mi|0}} of main-line track, 45&nbsp;turnouts and eight platforms. At Calais there are {{convert|30|km|mi|0}} of track and 44&nbsp;turnouts. At the terminals the shuttle trains traverse a figure eight to reduce uneven wear on the wheels.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.157\u2013174\">Kirkland pp. 157\u2013174</ref> There is a freight marshalling yard west of Cheriton at [[Dollands Moor Freight Yard]].\n\n== Regional impact ==\nA 1996 report from the [[European Commission]] predicted that [[Kent]] and [[Nord-Pas de Calais]] had to face increased traffic volumes due to general growth of cross-Channel traffic and traffic attracted by the tunnel. In Kent, a high-speed rail line to London would transfer traffic from road to rail.<ref name=\"EU reg impact 220-222\">European Commission pp. 220\u2013222</ref> Kent's regional development would benefit from the tunnel, but being so close to London restricts the benefits. Gains are in the traditional industries and are largely dependent on the development of [[Ashford International railway station]], without which Kent would be totally dependent on London's expansion. Nord-Pas-de-Calais enjoys a strong internal symbolic effect of the Tunnel which results in significant gains in manufacturing.<ref name=\"EU reg impact 248-252\">European Commission pp. 248\u2013252</ref>\n\nThe removal of a bottleneck by means like the tunnel does not necessarily induce economic gains in all adjacent regions. The image of a region being connected to the European high-speed transport and active political response are more important for regional economic development. Some small-medium enterprises located in the immediate vicinity of the terminal have used the opportunity to re-brand the profile of their business with positive effect, such as ''The New Inn'' at [[Etchinghill, Kent|Etchinghill]] which was able to commercially exploit its unique selling point as being 'the closest pub to the Channel Tunnel'.

The Service Tunnel Transport System (STTS) allows fast access to all areas of the tunnel. The service vehicles are rubber-tyred with a buried wire guidance system. The 24 STTS vehicles are used mainly for maintenance but also for firefighting and in emergencies. \"Pods\" with different purposes, up to a payload of {{convert|2.5|\u2013|5|tonne}}, are inserted into the side of the vehicles. The vehicles cannot turn around within the tunnel, and are driven from either end. The maximum speed is {{convert|80|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} when the steering is locked. A fleet of 15 Light Service Tunnel Vehicles (LADOGS) was introduced to supplement the STTSs. The LADOGS have a short wheelbase with a {{convert|3.4|m|abbr=on|adj=on}} turning circle, allowing two-point turns within the service tunnel. Steering cannot be locked like the STTS vehicles, and maximum speed is {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}. Pods up to {{convert|1|tonne}} can be loaded onto the rear of the vehicles. Drivers in the tunnel sit on the right, and the vehicles drive on the left. Owing to the risk of French personnel driving on their native right side of the road, sensors in the vehicles alert the driver if the vehicle strays to the right side.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.247\u2013254\">Kirkland pp. 247\u2013254</ref>\n\nThe three tunnels contain {{convert|6000|tonne}} of air that needs to be conditioned for comfort and safety. Air is supplied from [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] buildings at Shakespeare Cliff and Sangatte, with each building capable of providing 100% standby capacity. Supplementary ventilation also exists on either side of the tunnel. In the event of a fire, ventilation is used to keep smoke out of the service tunnel and move smoke in one direction in the main tunnel to give passengers clean air. The tunnel was the first main-line railway tunnel to have special cooling equipment. Heat is generated from traction equipment and drag. The design limit was set at {{convert|30|C|F|sigfig=2}}, using a mechanical cooling system with refrigeration plants on both sides that run chilled water circulating in pipes within the tunnel.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.212\u2013230\"/>\n\nTrains travelling at high speed create [[piston effect]] pressure changes that can affect passenger comfort, ventilation systems, tunnel doors, fans and the structure of the trains, and which drag on the trains.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.212\u2013230\">Kirkland pp. 212\u2013230</ref> Piston relief [[Duct (HVAC)|ducts]] of {{convert|2|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter were chosen to solve the problem, with 4&nbsp;ducts per kilometre to give close to optimum results. Unfortunately this design led to unacceptable lateral forces on the trains so a reduction in train speed was required and restrictors were installed in the ducts.<ref name=\"CT experience\">The Channel Tunnel Experience Lessons for the Future pp. 19\u201323</ref>\n\nThe safety issue of a possible fire on a passenger-vehicle shuttle garnered much attention, with Eurotunnel noting that fire was the risk attracting the most attention in a 1994 safety case for three reasons: the opposition of ferry companies to passengers being allowed to remain with their cars; [[Home Office]] statistics indicating that car fires had doubled in ten years; and the long length of the tunnel. Eurotunnel commissioned the UK Fire Research Station \u2013 now part of the [[Building Research Establishment]] \u2013 to give reports of vehicle fires, and liaised with Kent Fire Brigade to gather vehicle fire statistics over one year. Fire tests took place at the French Mines Research Establishment with a mock wagon used to investigate how cars burned.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.231\u2013240\">Kirkland pp. 231\u2013240</ref> The wagon door systems are designed to withstand fire inside the wagon for 30&nbsp;minutes, longer than the transit time of 27&nbsp;minutes. Wagon air conditioning units help to purge dangerous fumes from inside the wagon before travel. Each wagon has a fire detection and extinguishing system, with sensing of ions or [[ultraviolet radiation]], smoke and gases that can trigger [[Haloalkane|halon]] gas to quench a fire. Since the HGV wagons are not covered, fire sensors are located on the loading wagon and in the tunnel. A {{convert|10|in|adj=on}} water main in the service tunnel provides water to the main tunnels at {{convert|125|m|ft|0|adj=on}} intervals.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7612776.stm | title = Focus turns to cause of tunnel blaze |work=BBC News   | accessdate =12 September 2008 | date = 12 September 2008 | first=Andrew | last=McFarlane}}</ref> The ventilation system can control smoke movement. Special arrival sidings accept a train that is on fire, as the train is not allowed to stop whilst on fire in the tunnel, unless continuing its journey would lead to a worse outcome.

In 1958 the 1881 workings were cleared in preparation for a \u00a3100,000 geological survey by the Channel Tunnel Study Group. 30% of the funding came from the Channel Tunnel Co Ltd, the largest shareholder of which was the [[British Transport Commission]], as successor to the [[South Eastern Railway, UK|South Eastern Railway]].<ref>''Railway Magazine'' November 1958 p. 805</ref> A detailed geological survey was carried out in 1964 and 1965.<ref name=\"halcrow-film-1964\u201365\">{{cite web |title=Channel Tunnel Site Investigation \u2013 1964 |publisher=Halcrow Group |date=13 July 2011 |url=http://www.halcrow.com/Who-we-are/film_archive/Channel-Tunnel-site-investigation-film/ |accessdate=26 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001065054/http://www.halcrow.com/Who-we-are/film_archive/Channel-Tunnel-site-investigation-film/ |archivedate=1 October 2011  }}  Online presentation of a 1964\u201365 film documentary of a geological survey of the Channel, with a brief summary.</ref>\n\nAlthough the two countries agreed to build a tunnel in 1964, the phase 1 initial studies and signing of a second agreement to cover phase 2 took until 1973.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|title = Illustrated London News|year = 1975}}</ref>  Construction work of this government-funded project to create two tunnels designed to accommodate car shuttle wagons on either side of a service tunnel started on both sides of the Channel in 1974.\n\nOn 20 January 1975, to the dismay of their French partners, the now-governing Labour Party in Britain cancelled the project due to uncertainty about [[European Economic Community|EEC]] membership, doubling cost estimates and the general economic crisis at the time.  By this time the British tunnel boring machine was ready and the Ministry of Transport was able to do a {{convert|300|m|abbr=on}} experimental drive.<ref name=\"Wilson pp. 14\u201321\" /> This short tunnel was reused as the starting and access point for tunnelling operations from the British side.  The cancellation costs were estimated to be \u00a317 million.<ref name=\":0\" />  On the French side, a tunnel boring machine had been installed underground in a stub tunnel.  It lay there for 14 years until 1988, when it was sold, dismantled, refurbished and shipped to Turkey where it was used to drive the Moda tunnel for the Istanbul Sewerage Scheme, designed and supervised by British Civil Engineers Binnie & Partners, and officially opened by Margaret Thatcher in 1989.\n\n=== Initiation of project ===\n{{see also|Premiership of Margaret Thatcher#Channel Tunnel}}\nIn 1979, the \"Mouse-hole Project\" was suggested when the Conservatives came to power in Britain. The concept was a single-track rail tunnel with a service tunnel, but without shuttle terminals. The British government took no interest in funding the project, but the British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] did not object to a privately funded project, although she said she assumed it would be for cars rather than trains. In 1981, Thatcher and the French president [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] agreed to establish a working group to evaluate a privately funded project. In June 1982 the Franco-British study group favoured a twin tunnel to accommodate conventional trains and a vehicle shuttle service. In April 1985 promoters were invited to submit scheme proposals. Four submissions were shortlisted:\n\n* Channel Tunnel, a rail proposal based on the 1975 scheme presented by Channel Tunnel Group/France\u2013Manche (CTG/F\u2013M).\n* Eurobridge, a {{convert|35|km|abbr=on}} [[suspension bridge]] with a series of {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} spans with a roadway in an enclosed tube.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/?id=zhjOPdmyz1wC&lpg=PA17&pg=PA18#v=onepage |title=''New Scientist'' on Google Books |access-date=12 October 2019|last1=Information |first1=Reed Business |date=2 May 1985 }}</ref>\n* Euroroute, a {{convert|21|km|abbr=on}} tunnel between artificial islands approached by bridges.\n* Channel Expressway, a large diameter road tunnels with mid-channel ventilation towers.<ref name=\"Wilson pp. 14\u201321\"/>\n\nThe cross-Channel ferry industry protested under the name \"Flexilink\". In 1975 there was no campaign protesting against a fixed link, with one of the largest ferry operators (Sealink) being state-owned. Flexilink continued rousing opposition throughout 1986 and 1987.<ref name=\"Wilson pp. 14\u201321\"/> Public opinion strongly favoured a drive-through tunnel, but concerns about ventilation, accident management and driver mesmerisation led to the only shortlisted rail submission, CTG/F-M, being awarded the project in January 1986.<ref name=\"Wilson pp. 14\u201321\">Wilson pp. 14\u201321</ref> Reasons given for the selection included that it caused least disruption to shipping in the Channel, least environmental disruption, was the best protected against terrorism, and was the most likely to attract sufficient private finance.{{sfn|Foreign & Commonwealth Office|1994|p=5}}\n\n=== Arrangement ===\n[[File:Channel Tunnel project relations flow chart 1.svg|thumb|A block diagram describing the organisation structure used on the project. Eurotunnel is the central organisation for construction and operation (via a concession) of the tunnel]]\n\nThe British ''Channel Tunnel Group'' consisted of two banks and five construction companies, while their French counterparts, ''France\u2013Manche'', consisted of three banks and five construction companies. The role of the banks was to advise on financing and secure loan commitments. On 2 July 1985, the groups formed Channel Tunnel Group/France\u2013Manche (CTG/F\u2013M). Their submission to the British and French governments was drawn from the 1975 project, including 11&nbsp;volumes and a substantial environmental impact statement.<ref name=\"Wilson pp. 14\u201321\"/>\n\nThe design and construction was done by the ten construction companies in the CTG/F-M group. The French terminal and boring from Sangatte was done by the five French construction companies in the joint venture group ''GIE Transmanche Construction''. The English Terminal and boring from Shakespeare Cliff was done by the five British construction companies in the ''Translink Joint Venture''. The two partnerships were linked by a bi-national project organisation called [[TransManche Link]] (TML).<ref name=\"Wilson pp. 14\u201321\"/> The ''Ma\u00eetre d'Oeuvre'' was a supervisory engineering body employed by Eurotunnel under the terms of the concession that monitored the project and reported to the governments and banks.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.10\u201311\">Kirkland pp. 10\u201311</ref>\n\nIn France, with its long tradition of infrastructure investment, the project had widespread approval. The French National Assembly approved it unanimously in April 1987, and after a public inquiry, the Senate approved it unanimously in June. In Britain, select committees examined the proposal, making history by holding hearings away from Westminster, in Kent. In February 1987, the third reading of the Channel Tunnel Bill took place in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], and passed by 94&nbsp;votes to 22. The [[Channel Tunnel Act 1987|Channel Tunnel Act]] gained [[Royal assent]] and passed into law in July.<ref name=\"Wilson pp. 14\u201321\"/> Parliamentary support for the project came partly from provincial members of Parliament on the basis of promises of [[regional Eurostar]] through train services that never materialised; the promises were repeated in 1996 when the contract for construction of the [[Channel Tunnel Rail Link]] was awarded.<ref>{{cite web |title=Parliamentary note on the Channel Tunnel Rail Link |url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snbt-00070.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423162022/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snbt-00070.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 April 2010 |publisher=[[House of Commons Library]] |accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe tunnel is a build-own-operate-transfer ([[BOOT]]) project with a concession.<ref name=\"Flyvbjerg p. 96/97\">Flyvbjerg et al. pp.&nbsp;96\u201397</ref> TML would design and build the tunnel, but financing was through a separate legal entity, Eurotunnel. Eurotunnel absorbed CTG/F-M and signed a construction contract with TML, but the British and French governments controlled final engineering and safety decisions, now in the hands of the [[Channel Tunnel Safety Authority]]. The British and French governments gave Eurotunnel a 55-year operating concession (from 1987; extended by 10 years to 65 years in 1993){{sfn|Foreign & Commonwealth Office|1994|p=5}} to repay loans and pay dividends. A Railway Usage Agreement was signed between Eurotunnel, [[British Rail]] and [[SNCF]] guaranteeing future revenue in exchange for the railways obtaining half of the tunnel's capacity.\n\nPrivate funding for such a complex infrastructure project was of unprecedented scale. An initial equity of \u00a345&nbsp;million was raised by CTG/F-M, increased by \u00a3206&nbsp;million private institutional placement, \u00a3770&nbsp;million was raised in a public share offer that included press and television advertisements, a syndicated bank loan and [[letter of credit]] arranged \u00a35&nbsp;billion.<ref name=\"Wilson pp. 14\u201321\"/> Privately financed, the total investment costs at 1985 prices were \u00a32.6&nbsp;billion.

Also visible is the segmented tunnel lining]]\n\nSurveying undertaken in the 20 years before construction confirmed earlier speculations that a tunnel could be bored through a chalk [[marl]] stratum. The chalk marl is conducive to tunnelling, with impermeability, ease of excavation and strength. The chalk marl runs along the entire length of the English side of the tunnel, but on the French side a length of {{convert|5|km|mi|0}} has variable and difficult geology. The tunnel consists of three bores: two {{convert|7.6|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter rail tunnels, {{convert|30|m|ft|0}} apart, {{convert|50|km|mi|0}} in length with a {{convert|4.8|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter service tunnel in between. The three bores are connected by cross-passages and piston relief ducts. The service tunnel was used as a pilot tunnel, boring ahead of the main tunnels to determine the conditions. English access was provided at Shakespeare Cliff, French access from a shaft at Sangatte. The French side used five [[tunnel boring machine]]s (TBMs), the English side six. The service tunnel uses Service Tunnel Transport System (STTS) and Light Service Tunnel Vehicles (LADOGS). Fire safety was a critical design issue.\n\nBetween the portals at Beussingue and [[Castle Hill, Folkestone|Castle Hill]] the tunnel is {{convert|50.5|km|mi|0}} long, with {{convert|3.3|km|mi|0}} under land on the French side and {{convert|9.3|km|mi|0}} on the UK side, and {{convert|37.9|km|mi|0}} under sea.<ref name=\"ICE p. 95\">Institute of Civil Engineers p. 95{{inconsistent|reason=The book has only 65 pages: please verify the source.}}</ref> It is the third-longest rail tunnel in the world, behind the [[Gotthard Base Tunnel]] in Switzerland and the [[Seikan Tunnel]] in Japan, but with the longest under-sea section.<ref name=\"Daily Post 2006\">{{cite news | first = Jane | last = Gilbert | title = 'Chunnel' workers link France and Britain |work=The Daily Post (New Zealand) | publisher=APN New Zealand Ltd | date = 1 December 2006 }}</ref> The average depth is {{convert|45|m|ft|0}} below the seabed.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.13\">Kirkland p. 13</ref> On the UK side, of the expected {{convert|5|e6m3|e6cuyd|lk=on}} of spoil approximately {{convert|1|e6m3|e6cuyd}} was used for fill at the terminal site, and the remainder was deposited at Lower Shakespeare Cliff behind a seawall, [[land reclamation|reclaiming]] {{convert|74|acre|ha|0}}<ref name=\"Anderson Story p xvi-xvii\"/> of land.<ref name=\"ICE p. 208\">Institute of Civil Engineers p. 208</ref> This land was then made into the [[Samphire Hoe Country Park]].

However, environmental objections were raised over a high-speed link to London.<ref name=\"Flyvbjerg p. 51\">Flyvbjerg et al. p. 51</ref>\n\n=== Geology ===\n[[File:Channel Tunnel geological profile 1.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Geological profile along the tunnel as constructed. For most of its length the tunnel bores through a chalk [[marl]] stratum (layer)]]\n\nSuccessful tunnelling required a sound understanding of the topography and geology and the selection of the best rock strata through which to dig. The geology of this site generally consists of northeasterly dipping Cretaceous strata, part of the northern limb of the Wealden-Boulonnais dome. Characteristics include:\n\n* Continuous chalk on the cliffs on either side of the Channel containing no major faulting, as observed by [[Verstegan]] in 1605.\n* Four geological [[stratum|strata]], marine sediments laid down 90\u2013100&nbsp;million years ago; pervious upper and middle chalk above slightly pervious lower chalk and finally impermeable [[Gault Clay]]. A sandy stratum, glauconitic marl (tortia), is in between the chalk marl and gault clay.\n* A {{convert|25|\u2013|30|m|adj=on}} layer of chalk marl (French: ''craie bleue'') in the lower third of the lower chalk appeared to present the best tunnelling medium. The chalk has a clay content of 30\u201340% providing impermeability to groundwater yet relatively easy excavation with strength allowing minimal support. Ideally the tunnel would be bored in the bottom {{convert|15|m|ft|0}} of the chalk marl, allowing water inflow from fractures and joints to be minimised, but above the gault clay that would increase stress on the tunnel lining and swell and soften when wet.<ref name=\"Eng Geol\">{{cite book | title = Engineering Geology of the Channel Tunnel | editor = Harris, C.S. | year = 1996 | publisher=Thomas Telford | location = London | isbn = 0-7277-2045-7 | page = 57 |display-editors=etal}}</ref>\n\nOn the English side, the stratum [[Strike and dip|dip]] is less than 5\u00b0; on the French side this increases to 20\u00b0. Jointing and faulting are present on both sides. On the English side, only minor faults of displacement less than {{convert|2|m|ft|0}} exist; on the French side, displacements of up to {{convert|15|m|ft|0}} are present owing to the Quenocs [[anticline|anticlinal]] [[fold (geology)|fold]]. The faults are of limited width, filled with calcite, pyrite and remoulded clay. The increased dip and faulting restricted the selection of route on the French side. To avoid confusion, microfossil assemblages were used to classify the chalk marl. On the French side, particularly near the coast, the chalk was harder, more brittle and more fractured than on the English side. This led to the adoption of different tunnelling techniques on the two sides.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.21\u201350\"/>\n\nThe Quaternary undersea valley Fosse Dangaered, and [[Castle Hill, Folkestone|Castle Hill]] landslip at the English portal, caused concerns. Identified by the 1964\u201365 geophysical survey, the Fosse Dangaered is an infilled valley system extending {{convert|80|m|ft|0}} below the seabed, {{convert|500|m|ft|0}} south of the tunnel route in mid-channel. A 1986 survey showed that a tributary crossed the path of the tunnel, and so the tunnel route was made as far north and deep as possible. The English terminal had to be located in the Castle Hill landslip, which consists of displaced and tipping blocks of lower chalk, glauconitic marl and gault debris. Thus the area was stabilised by buttressing and inserting drainage [[adit]]s.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.21\u201350\"/> The service tunnel acted as a pilot preceding the main ones, so that the geology, areas of crushed rock, and zones of high water inflow could be predicted. Exploratory probing took place in the service tunnel, in the form of extensive forward probing, vertical downward probes and sideways probing.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.21\u201350\">Kirkland pp. 21\u201350</ref>\n\n=== Surveying ===\nMarine soundings and samplings by Thom\u00e9 de Gamond were carried out during 1833\u201367, establishing the seabed depth at a maximum of {{convert|55|m}} and the continuity of geological strata (layers). Surveying continued over many years, with 166&nbsp;marine and 70&nbsp;land-deep boreholes being drilled and over 4,000-line-kilometres of marine geophysical survey completed.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.22\u201326\"/> Surveys were undertaken in 1958\u20131959, 1964\u20131965, 1972\u20131974 and 1986\u20131988.\n\nThe surveying in 1958\u201359 catered for [[immersed tube]] and bridge designs as well as a bored tunnel, and thus a wide area was investigated. At this time, marine geophysics surveying for engineering projects was in its infancy, with poor positioning and resolution from seismic profiling. The 1964\u201365 surveys concentrated on a northerly route that left the English coast at Dover harbour; using 70&nbsp;boreholes, an area of deeply weathered rock with high [[permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] was located just south of Dover harbour.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.22\u201326\"/>\n\nGiven the previous survey results and access constraints, a more southerly route was investigated in the 1972\u201373 survey, and the route was confirmed to be feasible. Information for the tunnelling project also came from work before the 1975 cancellation. On the French side at Sangatte, a deep shaft with [[adit]]s was made. On the English side at Shakespeare Cliff, the government allowed {{convert|250|m|ft|0}} of {{convert|4.5|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter tunnel to be driven. The actual tunnel alignment, method of excavation and support were essentially the same as the 1975 attempt. In the 1986\u201387 survey, previous findings were reinforced, and the characteristics of the gault clay and the tunnelling medium (chalk marl that made up 85% of the route) were investigated.

A serious health and safety risk with building tunnels underwater is major water inflow due to the high [[hydrostatics|hydrostatic pressure]] from the sea above, under weak ground conditions. The tunnel also had the challenge of time: being privately funded, early financial return was paramount.\n\nThe objective was to construct two {{convert|7.6|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-diameter}} rail tunnels, {{convert|30|m|ft|0}} apart, {{convert|50|km|mi|0}} in length; a {{convert|4.8|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-diameter}}  service tunnel between the two main ones; pairs of {{convert|3.3|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-diameter}} cross-passages linking the rail tunnels to the service one at {{convert|375|m|ft|0|adj=on}} spacing; piston relief ducts {{convert|2|m|ft|0}} in diameter connecting the rail tunnels {{convert|250|m|ft|0}} apart; two undersea crossover caverns to connect the rail tunnels,<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.63\u2013128\">Kirkland pp. 63\u2013128</ref> with the service tunnel always preceding the main ones by at least {{convert|1|km|mi|1}} to ascertain the ground conditions. There was plenty of experience with excavating through chalk in the mining industry, while the undersea crossover caverns were a complex engineering problem. The French one was based on the [[Mount Baker Tunnel|Mount Baker Ridge]] freeway tunnel in [[Seattle]]; the UK cavern was dug from the service tunnel ahead of the main ones, to avoid delay.\n\nPrecast segmental linings in the main TBM drives were used, but two different solutions were used. On the French side, neoprene and grout sealed bolted linings made of cast iron or high-strength reinforced concrete were used; on the English side, the main requirement was for speed so bolting of cast-iron lining segments was only carried out in areas of poor geology. In the UK rail tunnels, eight lining segments plus a key segment were used; in the French side, five segments plus a key.<ref name=\"Wilson p.38\">Wilson p. 38</ref> On the French side, a {{convert|55|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter {{convert|75|m|ft|0|adj=on}} deep grout-curtained shaft at Sangatte was used for access. On the English side, a marshalling area was {{convert|140|m|ft|0}} below the top of Shakespeare Cliff, the [[New Austrian Tunnelling method]] (NATM) was first applied in the chalk marl here. On the English side, the land tunnels were driven from Shakespeare Cliff \u2013 same place as the marine tunnels \u2013 not from Folkestone. The platform at the base of the cliff was not large enough for all of the drives and, despite environmental objections, tunnel spoil was placed behind a reinforced concrete seawall, on condition of placing the chalk in an enclosed lagoon, to avoid wide dispersal of chalk fines. Owing to limited space, the precast lining factory was on the [[Isle of Grain]] in the Thames estuary,<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.63\u2013128\"/> which used Scottish granite aggregate delivered by ship from the [[Foster Yeoman]] coastal super quarry at [[Glensanda]] in [[Loch Linnhe]] on the west coast of Scotland.\n\nOn the French side, owing to the greater permeability to water, earth pressure balance [[Tunnel boring machine|TBMs]] with open and closed modes were used. The TBMs were of a closed nature during the initial {{convert|5|km|mi|0}}, but then operated as open, boring through the chalk marl stratum.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.63\u2013128\"/> This minimised the impact to the ground, allowed high water pressures to be withstood and it also alleviated the need to grout ahead of the tunnel. The French effort required five TBMs: two main marine machines, one main land machine (the short land drives of {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=on}} allowed one TBM to complete the first drive then reverse direction and complete the other), and two service tunnel machines. On the English side, the simpler geology allowed faster open-faced TBMs.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.29\">Kirkland p. 29</ref> Six machines were used; all commenced digging from Shakespeare Cliff, three marine-bound and three for the land tunnels.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.63\u2013128\"/> Towards the completion of the undersea drives, the UK TBMs were driven steeply downwards and buried clear of the tunnel. These buried TBMs were then used to provide an electrical earth. The French TBMs then completed the tunnel and were dismantled.<ref name=\"Wilson p. 44\">Wilson p. 44</ref> A {{convert|900|mm|0|abbr=on}} gauge railway was used on the English side during construction.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.117\u2013128\">Kirkland pp. 117\u2013128</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the English machines, which were given alphanumeric names, the French tunnelling machines were all named after women: Brigitte, Europa, Catherine, Virginie, Pascaline, S\u00e9verine.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://pagesperso-orange.fr/batisseurs-tunnel/3tunnels.pdf | first = Pierre-Jean | last = Pompee | title = Channel Tunnel: Tunnel's Construction | publisher = pagesperso-orange.fr | accessdate = 19 July 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090326113849/http://pagesperso-orange.fr/batisseurs-tunnel/3tunnels.pdf | archive-date = 26 March 2009 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nAt the end of the tunnelling, one machine was on display at the side of the M20 motorway in [[Folkestone]] until [[Getlink|Eurotunnel]] sold it on eBay for \u00a339,999 to a scrap metal merchant.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurotunnel.com/build/ |title=How the Channel Tunnel was Built |publisher=Eurotunnel Le Shuttle |accessdate=23 October 2017}}</ref> Another machine (T4 \"Virginie\") still survives on the French side, adjacent to Junction 41 on the [[A16 autoroute|A16]], in the middle of the D243E3/D243E4 roundabout.

High Speed 1, the tunnel and the [[LGV Nord]] all have power provided via overhead catenary at 25&nbsp;kV&nbsp;50&nbsp;Hz.

The Sonneville International Corporation's track system was chosen based on reliability and cost-effectiveness based on good performance in Swiss tunnels and worldwide. The type of track used is known as Low Vibration Track (LVT). Like ballasted track the LVT is of the free floating type, held in place by gravity and friction. Reinforced concrete blocks of 100&nbsp;kg support the rails every 60&nbsp;cm and are held by 12&nbsp;mm thick closed cell polymer foam pads placed at the bottom of rubber boots. The latter separate the blocks' mass movements from the lean encasement concrete. Ballastless track provides extra overhead clearance necessary for the passage of larger trains.<ref name=\"bonnett782\">Bonnett 2005, p. 78</ref> The corrugated rubber walls of the boots add a degree of isolation of horizontal wheel-rail vibrations, and are insulators of the track signal circuit in the humid tunnel environment. UIC60 (60&nbsp;kg/m) rails of 900A grade rest on {{convert|6|mm|1|abbr=on}} rail pads, which fit the RN/Sonneville bolted dual leaf-springs. The rails, LVT-blocks and their boots with pads were assembled outside the tunnel, in a fully automated process developed by the LVT inventor, Mr. Roger Sonneville. About 334,000 Sonneville blocks were made on the Sangatte site.\n\nMaintenance activities are less than projected. Initially the rails were ground on a yearly basis or after approximately 100MGT of traffic. Ride quality continues to be noticeably smooth and of low noise. Maintenance is facilitated by the existence of two tunnel junctions or crossover facilities, allowing for two-way operation in each of the six tunnel segments thereby created, and thus providing safe access for maintenance of one isolated tunnel segment at a time. The two crossovers are the largest artificial undersea caverns ever built; 150 m long, 10 m high and 18 m wide. The English crossover is {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=on}} from Shakespeare Cliff, and the French crossover is {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} from Sangatte.{{sfn|Foreign & Commonwealth Office|1994|p=14}}\n\n==== Ventilation, cooling and drainage ====\nThe ventilation system maintains the air pressure in the service tunnel higher than in the rail tunnels, so that in the event of a fire, smoke does not enter the service tunnel from the rail tunnels. Two cooling water pipes in each rail tunnel circulate chilled water to remove heat generated by the rail traffic. Pumping stations remove water in the tunnels from rain, seepage, and so on.{{sfn|Foreign & Commonwealth Office|1994|p=8}}\n\n=== Rolling stock ===\n[[File:TGV TMST 3011-2 - Sortie Tunnel sous la Manche \u00e0 Coquelles - Florian F\u00e8vre.JPG|thumb|Entrance to the tunnel near Coquelles, France]]\n\n==== Eurotunnel Shuttle ====\n{{Main|Eurotunnel Shuttle|Eurotunnel Class 9}}\n\nInitially 38&nbsp;Le Shuttle locomotives were commissioned, with one at each end of a shuttle train. The shuttles have two separate halves: single and double deck. Each half has two loading/unloading wagons and 12 carrier wagons.

By mid-1989 the price had risen to \u00a311.00. Delays and cost overruns led to the price dropping; during demonstration runs in October 1994 it reached an all-time low.

Financial restructuring of Eurotunnel occurred in mid-1998, reducing debt and financial charges.

There are [[juxtaposed controls]], meaning that passports are checked before boarding first by officials belonging to departing country and then officials of the destination country. These are placed only at the main Eurostar stations: French officials operate at [[St Pancras railway station|London St Pancras]], [[Ebbsfleet International railway station|Ebbsfleet International]] and [[Ashford International railway station|Ashford International]], while British officials operate at [[Gare de Calais-Fr\u00e9thun|Calais-Fr\u00e9thun]], [[Lille-Europe]], [[Brussels-South railway station|Brussels-South]] and [[Gare du Nord|Paris-Gare du Nord]].  There are security checks before boarding as well. For the shuttle road-vehicle trains, there are juxtaposed passport controls before boarding the trains.\n\nFor Eurostar trains travelling from places south of Paris, there is no passport and security check before departure, and those trains must stop in Lille at least 30 minutes to allow all passengers to be checked. No checks are done on board. There have been plans for services from [[Amsterdam]], [[Frankfurt]] and [[Cologne]] to London, but a major reason to cancel them was the need for a stop in Lille. A direct service from London to Amsterdam started on 4 April 2018; following the building of check-in terminals at Amsterdam and Rotterdam and intergovernmental agreement, a direct service from the two Dutch cities to London will start on 30 April 2020.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe reason for juxtaposed controls is a wish to prevent illegal immigration before reaching British soil, and because a check of all passengers on a train can take 30 minutes, which creates long queues if done at arrival.\n\n===No-deal Brexit plan===\n\nUnder a planned legislation which was published on 12 February 2019, it will give the UK and France time to renegotiate the terms under which the railway service operates. Trains will be permitted to use the Channel Tunnel for three months if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, under a proposed [[European Commission]] law.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-47215904|title=Brexit: No-deal plan for Channel Tunnel operations|work=BBC News|date=12 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Terminals ==\n{{Main|Eurotunnel Calais Terminal|Eurotunnel Folkestone Terminal}}\n\n[[File:Chargement voiture Eurotunnel.jpg|thumb|Car being driven onto a shuttle carriage at the French terminal in [[Coquelles]]]]\n\nThe terminals' sites are at [[Cheriton, Kent|Cheriton]] (near Folkestone in the United Kingdom) and [[Coquelles]] (near Calais in France). The terminals are designed to transfer vehicles from the motorway onto trains at a rate of 700&nbsp;cars and 113&nbsp;heavy vehicles per hour.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} The UK site uses the [[M20 motorway]] for access. The terminals are organised with the frontier controls juxtaposed with the entry to the system to allow travellers to go onto the motorway at the destination country immediately after leaving the shuttle. The area of the UK site was severely constrained and the design was challenging.\n\nThe French layout was achieved more easily. To achieve design output, the shuttles accept cars on double-deck wagons; for flexibility, ramps were placed inside the shuttles to provide access to the top decks.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.255\u2013270\">Kirkland pp. 255\u2013270</ref> At Folkestone there are {{convert|20|km|mi|0}} of main-line track, 45&nbsp;turnouts and eight platforms. At Calais there are {{convert|30|km|mi|0}} of track and 44&nbsp;turnouts. At the terminals the shuttle trains traverse a figure eight to reduce uneven wear on the wheels.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.157\u2013174\">Kirkland pp. 157\u2013174</ref> There is a freight marshalling yard west of Cheriton at [[Dollands Moor Freight Yard]].\n\n== Regional impact ==\nA 1996 report from the [[European Commission]] predicted that [[Kent]] and [[Nord-Pas de Calais]] had to face increased traffic volumes due to general growth of cross-Channel traffic and traffic attracted by the tunnel. In Kent, a high-speed rail line to London would transfer traffic from road to rail.<ref name=\"EU reg impact 220-222\">European Commission pp. 220\u2013222</ref> Kent's regional development would benefit from the tunnel, but being so close to London restricts the benefits. Gains are in the traditional industries and are largely dependent on the development of [[Ashford International railway station]], without which Kent would be totally dependent on London's expansion. Nord-Pas-de-Calais enjoys a strong internal symbolic effect of the Tunnel which results in significant gains in manufacturing.<ref name=\"EU reg impact 248-252\">European Commission pp. 248\u2013252</ref>\n\nThe removal of a bottleneck by means like the tunnel does not necessarily induce economic gains in all adjacent regions. The image of a region being connected to the European high-speed transport and active political response are more important for regional economic development. Some small-medium enterprises located in the immediate vicinity of the terminal have used the opportunity to re-brand the profile of their business with positive effect, such as ''The New Inn'' at [[Etchinghill, Kent|Etchinghill]] which was able to commercially exploit its unique selling point as being 'the closest pub to the Channel Tunnel'.

The Service Tunnel Transport System (STTS) allows fast access to all areas of the tunnel. The service vehicles are rubber-tyred with a buried wire guidance system. The 24 STTS vehicles are used mainly for maintenance but also for firefighting and in emergencies. \"Pods\" with different purposes, up to a payload of {{convert|2.5|\u2013|5|tonne}}, are inserted into the side of the vehicles. The vehicles cannot turn around within the tunnel, and are driven from either end. The maximum speed is {{convert|80|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} when the steering is locked. A fleet of 15 Light Service Tunnel Vehicles (LADOGS) was introduced to supplement the STTSs. The LADOGS have a short wheelbase with a {{convert|3.4|m|abbr=on|adj=on}} turning circle, allowing two-point turns within the service tunnel. Steering cannot be locked like the STTS vehicles, and maximum speed is {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}. Pods up to {{convert|1|tonne}} can be loaded onto the rear of the vehicles. Drivers in the tunnel sit on the right, and the vehicles drive on the left. Owing to the risk of French personnel driving on their native right side of the road, sensors in the vehicles alert the driver if the vehicle strays to the right side.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.247\u2013254\">Kirkland pp. 247\u2013254</ref>\n\nThe three tunnels contain {{convert|6000|tonne}} of air that needs to be conditioned for comfort and safety. Air is supplied from [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] buildings at Shakespeare Cliff and Sangatte, with each building capable of providing 100% standby capacity. Supplementary ventilation also exists on either side of the tunnel. In the event of a fire, ventilation is used to keep smoke out of the service tunnel and move smoke in one direction in the main tunnel to give passengers clean air. The tunnel was the first main-line railway tunnel to have special cooling equipment. Heat is generated from traction equipment and drag. The design limit was set at {{convert|30|C|F|sigfig=2}}, using a mechanical cooling system with refrigeration plants on both sides that run chilled water circulating in pipes within the tunnel.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.212\u2013230\"/>\n\nTrains travelling at high speed create [[piston effect]] pressure changes that can affect passenger comfort, ventilation systems, tunnel doors, fans and the structure of the trains, and which drag on the trains.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.212\u2013230\">Kirkland pp. 212\u2013230</ref> Piston relief [[Duct (HVAC)|ducts]] of {{convert|2|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter were chosen to solve the problem, with 4&nbsp;ducts per kilometre to give close to optimum results. Unfortunately this design led to unacceptable lateral forces on the trains so a reduction in train speed was required and restrictors were installed in the ducts.<ref name=\"CT experience\">The Channel Tunnel Experience Lessons for the Future pp. 19\u201323</ref>\n\nThe safety issue of a possible fire on a passenger-vehicle shuttle garnered much attention, with Eurotunnel noting that fire was the risk attracting the most attention in a 1994 safety case for three reasons: the opposition of ferry companies to passengers being allowed to remain with their cars; [[Home Office]] statistics indicating that car fires had doubled in ten years; and the long length of the tunnel. Eurotunnel commissioned the UK Fire Research Station \u2013 now part of the [[Building Research Establishment]] \u2013 to give reports of vehicle fires, and liaised with Kent Fire Brigade to gather vehicle fire statistics over one year. Fire tests took place at the French Mines Research Establishment with a mock wagon used to investigate how cars burned.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.231\u2013240\">Kirkland pp. 231\u2013240</ref> The wagon door systems are designed to withstand fire inside the wagon for 30&nbsp;minutes, longer than the transit time of 27&nbsp;minutes. Wagon air conditioning units help to purge dangerous fumes from inside the wagon before travel. Each wagon has a fire detection and extinguishing system, with sensing of ions or [[ultraviolet radiation]], smoke and gases that can trigger [[Haloalkane|halon]] gas to quench a fire. Since the HGV wagons are not covered, fire sensors are located on the loading wagon and in the tunnel. A {{convert|10|in|adj=on}} water main in the service tunnel provides water to the main tunnels at {{convert|125|m|ft|0|adj=on}} intervals.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7612776.stm | title = Focus turns to cause of tunnel blaze |work=BBC News   | accessdate =12 September 2008 | date = 12 September 2008 | first=Andrew | last=McFarlane}}</ref> The ventilation system can control smoke movement.

The British admiral in command of the eastern Indian Ocean, Rear-Admiral [[Edward Pellew|Sir Edward Pellew]], led a force of four [[ships of the line]], two [[frigates]] and [[brig]] to the capital of Java at [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] (later renamed [[Jakarta]]), in search of the squadron, which was reported to consist of a number of Dutch ships of the line and several smaller vessels. However the largest Dutch ships had already sailed eastwards towards [[Gresik|Griessie]] over a month earlier, and Pellew only discovered the frigate ''Phoenix'' and a number of smaller warships in the bay, all of which were driven ashore by their crews rather than engage Pellew's force. The wrecks were subsequently burnt and Pellew, unaware of the whereabouts of the main Dutch squadron, returned to his base at [[Madras]] for the winter.\n\nThe raid was the third of series of actions intended to eliminate the threat posed to British trade routes by the Dutch squadron: at the [[Action of 26 July 1806]] and the [[Action of 18 October 1806]], British frigates sent on reconnaissance missions to the region succeeded in attacking and capturing two Dutch frigates and a number of other vessels. The raid reduced the effectiveness of Batavia as a Dutch base, but the continued presence of the main Dutch squadron at Griessie concerned Pellew and he led a second operation the following year to complete his defeat of the Dutch. Three years later, with the French driven out of the western Indian Ocean, British forces in the region were strong enough to prepare an expeditionary force against the Dutch East Indies, which effectively ended the war in the east.\n\n==Background==\nIn early 1806, Pellew was relieved by the news that [[Linois' expedition to the Indian Ocean|a large French squadron]] under Rear-Admiral [[Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois|Charles Linois]] had sailed out of the Indian Ocean and into the Atlantic. The departure of Linois after three years of operations in eastern waters freed Pellew's small squadron based at [[Madras]] for operations against the [[Dutch East Indies]]. Pellew's particular target was the island of [[Java]], where the principal Dutch squadron and their base at [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] were located.<ref name=\"RG81\">Gardiner, p. 81</ref> The Dutch [[Kingdom of Holland]] was a French client state under Emperor [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]'s brother [[Louis Bonaparte]] and Batavia had been used by Linois in his preparations for the [[Battle of Pulo Aura]], in which a valuable British convoy came under attack, and its position close to the [[Straits of Malacca]] threatened British trade with China.<ref name=\"WLC336\">Clowes, p. 336</ref>\n\nPellew's departure for the East Indies was delayed by the [[Vellore Mutiny]] in the spring, and instead he sent [[frigate]]s to reconnoitre the situation of the Dutch forces in the region. In July, HMS ''Greyhound'' under Captain Edward Elphinstone cruised in the [[Molucca Islands]] and captured a Dutch convoy at the [[Action of 26 July 1806]] off [[Sulawesi|Celebes]].<ref name=\"WJ252\">James, p. 252</ref> Three months later another frigate, HMS ''Caroline'' under Captain Peter Rainier, cruised successfully in the [[Java Sea]] and managed to capture a Dutch frigate at the [[Action of 18 October 1806]] from the entrance to Batavia harbour.<ref name=\"JH79\">Henderson, p. 79</ref> Shortly before Rainier's engagement, the principal ships of the Dutch squadron, the two [[ships of the line]] ''Pluto'' and ''Revolutie'', had sailed westwards towards the port of [[Gresik|Griessie]], Rear-Admiral Hartsinck seeking to divide his forces in preparation for the coming British attack to prevent their complete destruction.<ref name=\"RG82\"/>\n\nPellew sailed from Madras in the early autumn of 1806, expecting the full Dutch squadron to be present and preparing accordingly with the ship of the line [[HMS Culloden (1783)|HMS ''Culloden'']] under Captain [[Christopher Cole (Royal Navy officer)|Christopher Cole]] as his flagship, accompanied by [[HMS Powerful (1783)|HMS ''Powerful'']] under Captain [[Robert Plampin]], [[HMS Russell (1764)|HMS ''Russell'']] under Captain Thomas Gordon Caulfield and [[HMS Belliqueux (1780)|HMS ''Belliqueux'']] under Captain [[George Byng, 6th Viscount Torrington|George Byng]]. The ships of the line were accompanied by the frigate [[HMS Terpsichore (1785)|HMS ''Terpsichore'']] under Captain [[Fleetwood Pellew]], Admiral Pellew's son, as well as the brig HMS ''Seaflower'' under Lieutenant [[William Fitzwilliam Owen]].<ref name=\"WJ267\">James, p. 267</ref>\n\n==Pellew's attack==\nBy 23 November, Pellew's squadron was approaching the [[Sunda Strait]] from the southwest when he encountered the British frigate HMS ''Sir Francis Drake'', which he attached to his force. Three days later, the squadron passed the port of [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]] and seized the [[Dutch East India Company]] brig ''Maria Wilhelmina'', continuing on to Batavia during the night.<ref name=\"LG1\">{{London Gazette|issue=16044|page=893|date=4 July 1807}}</ref> At the approaches to the port, the squadron separated, with the frigates and brig passing between [[Thousand Islands (Indonesia)#History|Onrust Island]] and the shore while the ships of the line took a longer route through deeper water. Although ''Terpsichore'' was able to surprise and capture the [[corvette]] ''William'' near Onrust Island, the main body of the squadron was spotted by Dutch lookouts from a distance, who initially mistook the approaching vessels for a French squadron.<ref name=\"WLC392\">Clowes, p. 392</ref> The Dutch officers, led by Captain Vander Sande on the frigate [[Dutch frigate Phoenix|''Phoenix'']], decided that resistance against such a large British squadron was useless: the only warships remaining in the harbour were the ''Phoenix'' and six small armed ships, none of which could contend with the approaching British force. In an effort to dissuade the British from pressing their attack, the Dutch captains all drove their vessels ashore, joined by the 22 merchant vessels that were anchored in the harbour.<ref name=\"WJ267\"/>\n\nDetermined to prevent the Dutch from refloating the grounded ships, Admiral Pellew ordered landing parties to assemble in the boats of his squadron alongside ''Terpsichore''. From there, under distant covering fire from the British frigates, Fleetwood Pellew led the boats against ''Phoenix'', coming under fire from the grounded vessels and gun batteries ashore.<ref name=\"LG1\"/> Passing through the bombardment from the shoreline, Pellew's men boarded ''Phoenix'' to find that the Dutch crew had just abandoned the vessel, scuttling the frigate as they departed. Although now useless as a ship, ''Phoenix''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s guns were turned on the other beached vessels to cover the British boats as they spread out to board and burn them. This operation was followed by the destruction of 20 grounded merchant ships in the harbour, although two others were successfully refloated and captured.<ref name=\"WJ268\">James, p. 268</ref> In a final act before withdrawing to the squadron offshore, Captain Pellew set fire to the wreck of ''Phoenix'', burning the ship to the waterline. The entire operation was conducted under heavy fire from the shore, but British casualties were only one [[Royal Marine]] killed and three men wounded.<ref name=\"WLC393\">Clowes, p. 393</ref>\n\nWithout sufficient troops to attempt a landing at Batavia itself, Admiral Pellew withdrew from the harbour. Preparing his prizes for the return to Madras, he ordered all prisoners taken from the captured and burnt ships returned to shore under condition of parole.<ref name=\"LG2\"/> The captured ''William'' was found to be in such a poor state of repair that it was not worth keeping the corvette and Admiral Pellew ordered the ship burnt.{{refn|''William'' was a brig that the Batavians had captured from the British in 1799.{{sfn|Van Maanen||p=44}}|group=Note}} Pellew noted in his official report that Lieutenant Owen, who as senior lieutenant would otherwise have been placed in command, should be recompensed with another command as reward for his services in the engagement.

In addition to ''Phoenix'', ''William'' and the merchant ships, Pellew's squadron had burnt the 18-gun brigs ''Aventurier'' and ''Patriot'', the 14-gun ''Zee-Ploeg'', the 10-gun ''Arnistein'', the 8-gun ''Johanna Suzanna'' and the 6-gun ''Snelheid''.
