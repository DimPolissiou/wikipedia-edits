In modern times,a shorter cycle is written as 24,000 years by another author is more commonly accepted as 25,772 years because it coincides with [[axial precession]], [[Astronomical precession]] and another planetary body ([[Planet Nine]])  that influences our solar system {{Original research|date=February 2020}}. However, the traditional timescale is widely accepted within India.\n\n==The Traditional cycle of Yugas==\n\nThe traditional cycle of the Yugas has been mentioned in the [[Mahabharata]] and it is widely accepted since ancient times. The 4th century indian mathematician [[Aryabhata]] calculated the beginning of Kali Yuga.  The Yuga cycle contains 4 yugas (ages) - Satya Yuga, Dwapar, Treta and Kali Yuga.\n\nThe age of Kali Yuga = '''432,000 years'''\n\nThe age of Dwapar Yuga = 432,000 * 2 = '''864,000 years'''\n\nThe age of Treta Yuga = 432,000 * 3 = '''1,296,000 years'''\n\nThe age of Satya Yuga = 432,000 * 4 = '''1,728,000 years'''\n\nOne Mahayuga is the entire one cycle = 4,320,000 years. 1000 Mahayugas is equal to one day of Lord [[Brahma]]. His night is of equal duration. So the entire day of Brahma becomes - \n\n4,320,000 * 1000 * 2 = '''8,640,000,000 years'''\n\nLord Brahma lives for 100 years and passes away and the universe ends. A new Brahma is born and creates the universe again. \n\nSo the entire duration of life of universe is -\n\n8,640,000,000 * 365 * 100 = '''315,360,000,000,000 years'''\n\n==The Modern cycle of Yugas==\n\nThis shorter calculation is promoted <ref>{{Citation|last=Sadhguru|title=The Great Cycles or 'YUGAS' Isha Fondation Sadhguru|date=2017-09-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHVNQwO68E|volume=|pages=|access-date=2019-04-12}}</ref> by modern day spiritual leaders such as [[Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri]] giving the approximate length of yugas as:\n\n* Satya Yuga\u20144800 years\n* Treta Yuga\u20143600 years\n* Dvapara Yuga\u20142400 years\n* Kali Yuga\u20141200 years\n\nThis results in a near 24,000 year cycle.meaning that the following calculation relating to Mahayugas is erroneously used:\n\n* Satya Yuga = 4800 \u00d7 360 = 1,728,000 years\n* Treta Yuga = 3600 \u00d7 360 = 1,296,000 years\n* Dvapara Yuga = 2400 \u00d7 360 = 864,000 years\n* Kali Yuga = 1200 \u00d7 360 = 432,000 years\n\nThe common belief until Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri had analyzed the dating of the Yuga cycles was that the Kali Yuga would last for roughly 438,000 years after the end of the Dwapara Yuga (3102 BCE). This originated during the puranic times when the famous astronomer Aryabhatta recalculated the timeline by artificially inflating the traditional 12,000 year figure with a multiplication of 360, which was represented as the number of \"human years\" that make up a single \"divine year\". This was likely a purposeful miscalculation due to conflicts with one of the preeminent astronomer of the time [[Brahmagupta]]. However, both the Mahabharata (which was used by Aryabhatta in his calculations) and the Manu Smriti have the original value of 12,000 years for one half of the Yuga cycle.\nAccording to one Puranic astronomical estimate, the four Yuga have the following durations:<ref name=penprase182/>\n\n*Satya Yuga equals 1,728,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sm0BfUKwct0C&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=4,000+%2B+400+%2B+400+%3D+4,800+divine+years+(%3D+1,728,000+human+years)#v=onepage&q=4%2C000%20%2B%20400%20%2B%20400%20%3D%204%2C800%20divine%20years%20(%3D%201%2C728%2C000%20human%20years)&f=false|title=Tracing The Way: Spiritual Dimensions of the World Religions|page=50|first=Hans|last=Kng|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=9780826494238|date=2006-10-31}}</ref>\n*Treta Yuga equals 1,296,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n*Dvapara Yuga equals 864,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n*Kali Yuga equals 432,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nTogether, these four yuga constitute one Mahayuga, equal to 4.32 million human years.<ref name=penprase182>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQHNDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA137|title=The Power of Stars|publisher=Springer|page=182|first=Bryan E.|last=Penprase|isbn=9783319525976|date=2017-05-05}}</ref> According to one version, there are 1,000 Mahayugas in one day of [[Brahma]] or 4320 million human years.

The duration of the Satya Yuga is therefore 4,800 \u00d7 360, or 1,728,000 years. The duration of the Tret\u0101 Yuga is 3,600 \u00d7 360, or 1,296,000 years. The duration of the Dv\u0101para Yuga is 2,400 \u00d7 360, or 864,000 years.<ref name=web>{{Cite book|url=http://vedabase.com/sb/3/11/19/|title=SB 3.11.19|first=|last=|access-date=15 July 2011|website=vedabase.com|date=2011-07-15}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nThe Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a Time measurement section of the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a Book I Chapter III adds:\n\n* 2 Ayanas (6-month periods, see above) = 1 human year or 1 day of the devas.\n* 12,000 divine years = 4 Yugas (= 4,320,000 human years) = 1 Mah\u0101-Yuga (also is equal to 12,000 Daiva [divine] Yuga).\n* 2 \u00d7 12,000 = 24,000 divine year = 12000 revolutions of sun around its dual.\n\nWhile the long yuga count is the most popular, it does not correlate to any known celestial motion found in the [[Astronomical Almanac]]. The value of 24,000 years fits relatively close with the modern astronomical calculation of one full [[Axial precession (astronomy)#Effects|precession of the equinox]], which takes 25,772 years.{{efn|This phenomenon is observed as the stars moving retrograde across the sky at about 50 arc seconds per year, and is thought to produce periods of warm ages and ice ages known as the [[Milankovitch cycle]].}} Thus the yuga cycle may have some basis in known terrestrial cycles. [[Srimad Bhagavatam]] 3.11.19 describes the timespans of the [[demigod|deva]]s, in which a year of a yuga is a year of the demigods. It is this second sloka which appears to have been modified over the years.\n\n==Decline==\nThe ages see a gradual decline of dharma, wisdom, knowledge, intellectual capability, life span, emotional and physical strength.\n* ''[[Satya Yuga]]'' \u2013  Virtue reigns supreme.

The 4th century indian mathematician [[Aryabhata]] calculated the beginning of Kali Yuga.  The Yuga cycle contains 4 yugas (ages) - Satya Yuga, Dwapar, Treta and Kali Yuga.\n\nThe age of Kali Yuga = '''432,000 years'''\n\nThe age of Dwapar Yuga = 432,000 * 2 = '''864,000 years'''\n\nThe age of Treta Yuga = 432,000 * 3 = '''1,296,000 years'''\n\nThe age of Satya Yuga = 432,000 * 4 = '''1,728,000 years'''\n\nOne Mahayuga is the entire one cycle = 4,320,000 years. 1000 Mahayugas is equal to one day of Lord [[Brahma]]. His night is of equal duration. So the entire day of Brahma becomes - \n\n4,320,000 * 1000 * 2 = '''8,640,000,000 years'''\n\nLord Brahma lives for 100 years and passes away and the universe ends. A new Brahma is born and creates the universe again. \n\nSo the entire duration of life of universe is -\n\n8,640,000,000 * 365 * 100 = '''315,360,000,000,000 years'''\n\n==The Modern cycle of Yugas==\n\nThis shorter calculation is promoted <ref>{{Citation|last=Sadhguru|title=The Great Cycles or 'YUGAS' Isha Fondation Sadhguru|date=2017-09-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHVNQwO68E|volume=|pages=|access-date=2019-04-12}}</ref> by modern day spiritual leaders such as [[Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri]] giving the approximate length of yugas as:\n\n* Satya Yuga\u20144800 years\n* Treta Yuga\u20143600 years\n* Dvapara Yuga\u20142400 years\n* Kali Yuga\u20141200 years\n\nThis results in a near 24,000 year cycle.meaning that the following calculation relating to Mahayugas is erroneously used:\n\n* Satya Yuga = 4800 \u00d7 360 = 1,728,000 years\n* Treta Yuga = 3600 \u00d7 360 = 1,296,000 years\n* Dvapara Yuga = 2400 \u00d7 360 = 864,000 years\n* Kali Yuga = 1200 \u00d7 360 = 432,000 years\n\nThe common belief until Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri had analyzed the dating of the Yuga cycles was that the Kali Yuga would last for roughly 438,000 years after the end of the Dwapara Yuga (3102 BCE). This originated during the puranic times when the famous astronomer Aryabhatta recalculated the timeline by artificially inflating the traditional 12,000 year figure with a multiplication of 360, which was represented as the number of \"human years\" that make up a single \"divine year\". This was likely a purposeful miscalculation due to conflicts with one of the preeminent astronomer of the time [[Brahmagupta]]. However, both the Mahabharata (which was used by Aryabhatta in his calculations) and the Manu Smriti have the original value of 12,000 years for one half of the Yuga cycle.\nAccording to one Puranic astronomical estimate, the four Yuga have the following durations:<ref name=penprase182/>\n\n*Satya Yuga equals 1,728,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sm0BfUKwct0C&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=4,000+%2B+400+%2B+400+%3D+4,800+divine+years+(%3D+1,728,000+human+years)#v=onepage&q=4%2C000%20%2B%20400%20%2B%20400%20%3D%204%2C800%20divine%20years%20(%3D%201%2C728%2C000%20human%20years)&f=false|title=Tracing The Way: Spiritual Dimensions of the World Religions|page=50|first=Hans|last=Kng|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=9780826494238|date=2006-10-31}}</ref>\n*Treta Yuga equals 1,296,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n*Dvapara Yuga equals 864,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n*Kali Yuga equals 432,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nTogether, these four yuga constitute one Mahayuga, equal to 4.32 million human years.<ref name=penprase182>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQHNDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA137|title=The Power of Stars|publisher=Springer|page=182|first=Bryan E.|last=Penprase|isbn=9783319525976|date=2017-05-05}}</ref> According to one version, there are 1,000 Mahayugas in one day of [[Brahma]] or 4320 million human years.

The duration of the Satya Yuga is therefore 4,800 \u00d7 360, or 1,728,000 years. The duration of the Tret\u0101 Yuga is 3,600 \u00d7 360, or 1,296,000 years.

The value of 24,000 years fits relatively close with the modern astronomical calculation of one full [[Axial precession (astronomy)#Effects|precession of the equinox]], which takes 25,772 years.{{efn|This phenomenon is observed as the stars moving retrograde across the sky at about 50 arc seconds per year, and is thought to produce periods of warm ages and ice ages known as the [[Milankovitch cycle]].}} Thus the yuga cycle may have some basis in known terrestrial cycles. [[Srimad Bhagavatam]] 3.11.19 describes the timespans of the [[demigod|deva]]s, in which a year of a yuga is a year of the demigods. It is this second sloka which appears to have been modified over the years.\n\n==Decline==\nThe ages see a gradual decline of dharma, wisdom, knowledge, intellectual capability, life span, emotional and physical strength.\n* ''[[Satya Yuga]]'' \u2013  Virtue reigns supreme.

It's good for us, because we can take a song that's been recorded and do what we want to it: slow it down, speed it up, make it 10 seconds or 10 minutes long. It gives us a lot of freedom.\"<ref name=\"Tame Impala - Inner Visions\" />\n\nSome favoured and often-used effects by Parker include [[Phaser (effect)|phasing]], [[Delay (audio effect)|delay]], [[Reverberation|reverb]] and [[Distortion (music)|fuzz]]. Experimentation with different effects pedals such as Roland RE-20 Space Echo,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://equipboard.com/pros/kevin-parker|title=Kevin Parker Equipboard|website=Equipboard|access-date=27 April 2019}}</ref> has led to Parker creating new and unique sounds. \"If you make an effort to not put the pedals in the order you're meant to, then you'll end up with something new sounding. We don't have any things that we got from another planet or anything, it's the same things everyone else has used.\" \"People have a [[Distortion (music)|distortion]] pedal and then a [[reverberation|reverb]] pedal. A reverb is meant to make it sound like it's in a cathedral or something. If you put it the other way around, it won't sound like a guitar being played in a church, it'll sound like a church being stuffed inside a shoebox and then exploded.

I\u2019ll find my eight-track and do a quick demo of just the riff, or a verse or a chorus. The song will go for like 30 seconds. I\u2019ll have a whole bunch of them [demos] and then I\u2019ll just choose which ones to make into full songs\".<ref name=\"Tame Impala - Inner Visions\" /> Parker has a strong sense of [[melody]] in his music, having composed \"excessively melodic music from about the age of 12 to 15\".<ref name=\"LA Times interview\">{{cite web|title=LA Times interview|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/06/innerspeaking-tame-impalas-kevin-parker-discusses-his-bands-success-origins-and-impressions-of-calif.html|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=13 July 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221201723/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/06/innerspeaking-tame-impalas-kevin-parker-discusses-his-bands-success-origins-and-impressions-of-calif.html|archivedate=21 December 2011}}</ref> For Parker, the music comes before the lyrics, \"I usually write the lyrics after the melody and its timing have been decided. But the words have to be meaningful. I try to synchronise certain words with the best parts of the melody, but it can be really difficult and does my head in. I like to keep the meaning pretty open and ambiguous so that it's not just me that gets something out of the lyrics. I usually write lyrics from a persona rather than tell a specific story.\"<ref name=\"Tame Impala WOW Magazine Interview\" /> Parker also said \"Usually I am sufficiently motivated to think of new songs everyday, but I usually forget them. I seem to get an emotional kick out of sensing feelings of general desperation or hopelessness, whether it's me or someone near me or someone in a movie or anything. It's really difficult to sit down and force yourself to write a song, and that forced nature usually comes out in the song so I just have to wait until they come to me.\"<ref name=\"Tame Impala WOW Magazine Interview\" />\n\n===Influences===\n[[File:Tame Impala @ La Riviera, Madrid (9280795653).jpg|thumb|Tame Impala's music and live visuals are heavily influenced by psychedelic music.]]\nParker's music is heavily influenced by late 1960s and early 1970s [[psychedelic rock]],<ref>{{cite web |author=K.

Parker mentioned this by saying \"I had a few obsessions when recording ''Innerspeaker''. One was to make the guitars sound like synths and drums sound like drum samples and pretty much anything except guitars and drums. I'm obsessed with confusing people as to the origin of a sound.\"<ref name=\"Tame Impala WOW Magazine Interview\" />\n\nParker was inspired to take up various creative endeavours at a young age, \"I used to draw a lot when I was very young, and I used to get the most immense feeling of satisfaction from finishing a picture and looking back at it, even though I wasn't actually that good. When I started playing music I got the same feeling from making a song, even if it was just a few noises or drum patterns put together. It was all about the buzz from making something from nothing. Music always affected me greatly as a listener anyway, usually from listening to music in my dad's car or listening to him play guitar.\"<ref name=\"Tame Impala WOW Magazine Interview\" />\n\n[[Lo-fi]] music is also a favourite of Parker's, and he incorporated it heavily in the early days of Tame Impala, heard prominently on the ''[[Tame Impala EP]]''. With the release of ''Innerspeaker'', Parker went for a different approach to a lo-fi sound, aiming more for a more cosmic and sonic [[wall of sound]], helped by mixer [[Dave Fridmann]]. Parker explained \"It sounds more cohesive, like an organism. It has a different emotion to it, it brings out a different feeling when it's absolutely blaring at you. I love that sound.\"<ref name=\"Tame Impala - Inner Visions\">{{cite web|title=Tame Impala \u2013 Inner Visions|url=http://www.messandnoise.com/articles/3964065|publisher=Mess and Noise|accessdate=14 July 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630160656/http://www.messandnoise.com/articles/3964065|archivedate=30 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nParker has also stated that [[Supertramp]], one of his favourite bands, are a major influence on the musical style of Tame Impala. Despite their difference in sound, he feels he is always somewhat \"channeling Supertramp\".<ref name=\"TheVine-interview-2014\">{{cite web

Three days later on 28 October, they released the song \"[[It Might Be Time]]\". On 3 December, Tame Impala released the single \"Posthumous Forgiveness\". The album was released on 14 February 2020.\n\nJosh Terry of ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' named Tame Impala his \"Artist of the Decade\" for the 2010s, writing, \"No artist captured how genres cross-pollinated throughout the 2010s better than Tame Impala\". He added: \"In the age of streaming and the big-box festival bubble, Parker's discography seems factory-made for both a crowd of thousands and a chill night alone with a vibe-heavy playlist\" and that \"his music embodies the technology-driven sense of loneliness of this decade better than any of his peers\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bjwkv8/tame-impala-is-the-artist-of-the-decade|title=Tame Impala Is the Artist of the Decade|website=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|first=Josh |last=Terry|date=7 November 2019|accessdate=8 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 20 March 2020, Parker appeared on The Weeknd's [[After Hours (The Weeknd album)|''After Hours'']] album, producing and providing background vocals on a track called \"Repeat After Me (Interlude)\".\n\n==Musical style==\nParker's decision to make the music for Tame Impala in the studio by himself is a result of Parker liking \"the kind of music that is the result of one person constructing an awesome symphony of sound. You can layer your own voice 700 times for half a second if you want, and I just love that kind of music\".<ref name=\"Nylon TV Interview\">{{cite web|title=Nylon TV Interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4m_BKefOQg|publisher=Nylon TV|accessdate=14 July 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626043715/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4m_BKefOQg|archivedate=26 June 2014}}</ref> However, Parker has to translate his music to a live setting with the band, and the band doesn't play the songs until they have been recorded. \"The only [[jam session|jamming]] that's done as a band is done a long time after the song is recorded for the sake of the live environment. It's good for us, because we can take a song that's been recorded and do what we want to it: slow it down, speed it up, make it 10 seconds or 10 minutes long. It gives us a lot of freedom.\"<ref name=\"Tame Impala - Inner Visions\" />\n\nSome favoured and often-used effects by Parker include [[Phaser (effect)|phasing]], [[Delay (audio effect)|delay]], [[Reverberation|reverb]] and [[Distortion (music)|fuzz]]. Experimentation with different effects pedals such as Roland RE-20 Space Echo,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://equipboard.com/pros/kevin-parker|title=Kevin Parker Equipboard|website=Equipboard|access-date=27 April 2019}}</ref> has led to Parker creating new and unique sounds. \"If you make an effort to not put the pedals in the order you're meant to, then you'll end up with something new sounding. We don't have any things that we got from another planet or anything, it's the same things everyone else has used.\" \"People have a [[Distortion (music)|distortion]] pedal and then a [[reverberation|reverb]] pedal. A reverb is meant to make it sound like it's in a cathedral or something. If you put it the other way around, it won't sound like a guitar being played in a church, it'll sound like a church being stuffed inside a shoebox and then exploded. You can do different things just by treating things differently.\"<ref name=\"Undercover TV interview\">{{cite web|title=Undercover TV interview|url=http://www.uctv.com.au/site/play/391-Tame-Impala-Undercover-Interviews|publisher=Undercover TV|accessdate=14 July 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121231011401/http://www.uctv.com.au/site/play/391-Tame-Impala-Undercover-Interviews|archivedate=31 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nParker's process for making music is \"I\u2019ll have a sudden, spontaneous vision of a song, have all the parts mapped out in mind, and do my best to record it as quick as I can. I\u2019ll find my eight-track and do a quick demo of just the riff, or a verse or a chorus. The song will go for like 30 seconds. I\u2019ll have a whole bunch of them [demos] and then I\u2019ll just choose which ones to make into full songs\".<ref name=\"Tame Impala - Inner Visions\" /> Parker has a strong sense of [[melody]] in his music, having composed \"excessively melodic music from about the age of 12 to 15\".<ref name=\"LA Times interview\">{{cite web|title=LA Times interview|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/06/innerspeaking-tame-impalas-kevin-parker-discusses-his-bands-success-origins-and-impressions-of-calif.html|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=13 July 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221201723/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/06/innerspeaking-tame-impalas-kevin-parker-discusses-his-bands-success-origins-and-impressions-of-calif.html|archivedate=21 December 2011}}</ref> For Parker, the music comes before the lyrics, \"I usually write the lyrics after the melody and its timing have been decided. But the words have to be meaningful. I try to synchronise certain words with the best parts of the melody, but it can be really difficult and does my head in. I like to keep the meaning pretty open and ambiguous so that it's not just me that gets something out of the lyrics. I usually write lyrics from a persona rather than tell a specific story.\"<ref name=\"Tame Impala WOW Magazine Interview\" /> Parker also said \"Usually I am sufficiently motivated to think of new songs everyday, but I usually forget them. I seem to get an emotional kick out of sensing feelings of general desperation or hopelessness, whether it's me or someone near me or someone in a movie or anything. It's really difficult to sit down and force yourself to write a song, and that forced nature usually comes out in the song so I just have to wait until they come to me.\"<ref name=\"Tame Impala WOW Magazine Interview\" />\n\n===Influences===\n[[File:Tame Impala @ La Riviera, Madrid (9280795653).jpg|thumb|Tame Impala's music and live visuals are heavily influenced by psychedelic music.]]\nParker's music is heavily influenced by late 1960s and early 1970s [[psychedelic rock]],<ref>{{cite web |author=K.

Parker has \"always been in love with the [[wall of sound]] as employed by My Bloody Valentine\" and he tries to capture that \"melancholy dreamy feel\".<ref name=\"Kevin Parker LA Times Interview\">{{cite web|title=Tame Impala's Kevin Parker Discusses His Band's Success, Origins and Impressions of California|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/06/innerspeaking-tame-impalas-kevin-parker-discusses-his-bands-success-origins-and-impressions-of-calif.html|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=14 July 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221201723/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/06/innerspeaking-tame-impalas-kevin-parker-discusses-his-bands-success-origins-and-impressions-of-calif.html|archivedate=21 December 2011}}</ref> Parker tries to incorporate this balance into his own music. \"If I was singing, I wouldn't be able to match the tone of the instruments, which is really crunchy.

It's kind of like My Bloody Valentine, where it's really brutal sounding, but kind of beautiful at the same time\".<ref name=\"Tame Impala Sopitas interview\">{{cite web|title=Tame Impala en entrevista para Sopitas.com|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uZjIsSVngY|via=YouTube|accessdate=14 July 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017181404/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uZjIsSVngY|archivedate=17 October 2013}}</ref> Tame Impala live drummer Jay Watson has described Parker's music as containing \"[[shoegaze]]y guitar sound, but not played in a shoegazey manner\".<ref name=\"Tame Impala Hartzine interview\">{{cite web|title=Tame Impala Hartzine interview|url=http://vimeo.com/18386586|via=Vimeo|accessdate=14 July 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928091551/http://vimeo.com/18386586|archivedate=28 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Electronic dance music|Electronic music]] is another influence. Parker has used rock instrumentation in an electronic manner, saying \"The way we do music, it's organic, but it's meant to be quite repetitive and hypnotic, almost in a kind of electronic nature.

Parker mentioned this by saying \"I had a few obsessions when recording ''Innerspeaker''. One was to make the guitars sound like synths and drums sound like drum samples and pretty much anything except guitars and drums. I'm obsessed with confusing people as to the origin of a sound.\"<ref name=\"Tame Impala WOW Magazine Interview\" />\n\nParker was inspired to take up various creative endeavours at a young age, \"I used to draw a lot when I was very young, and I used to get the most immense feeling of satisfaction from finishing a picture and looking back at it, even though I wasn't actually that good. When I started playing music I got the same feeling from making a song, even if it was just a few noises or drum patterns put together. It was all about the buzz from making something from nothing. Music always affected me greatly as a listener anyway, usually from listening to music in my dad's car or listening to him play guitar.\"<ref name=\"Tame Impala WOW Magazine Interview\" />\n\n[[Lo-fi]] music is also a favourite of Parker's, and he incorporated it heavily in the early days of Tame Impala, heard prominently on the ''[[Tame Impala EP]]''. With the release of ''Innerspeaker'', Parker went for a different approach to a lo-fi sound, aiming more for a more cosmic and sonic [[wall of sound]], helped by mixer [[Dave Fridmann]]. Parker explained \"It sounds more cohesive, like an organism. It has a different emotion to it, it brings out a different feeling when it's absolutely blaring at you. I love that sound.\"<ref name=\"Tame Impala - Inner Visions\">{{cite web|title=Tame Impala \u2013 Inner Visions|url=http://www.messandnoise.com/articles/3964065|publisher=Mess and Noise|accessdate=14 July 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630160656/http://www.messandnoise.com/articles/3964065|archivedate=30 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nParker has also stated that [[Supertramp]], one of his favourite bands, are a major influence on the musical style of Tame Impala.

As a result of their good form under van Egmond, crowds in Newcastle have reached all time highs for soccer&nbsp;\u2013 culminating in a crowd of over 24,000 for their home final against [[Sydney FC]] on 2 February 2007.\n\nNewcastle were eventually eliminated in the preliminary final by Adelaide, the game going to penalties after finishing at 1 all. [[Vaughan Coveny]] and [[Stuart Musialik]] missed their attempts in a shoot-out that ended up at 4\u20133 in favour of Adelaide, costing Newcastle their place in the grand final and a berth in the Asian Champions League.\n\n===Champions of Australia===\n\nSeason 3 of the [[A-League]] saw a number of Newcastle's biggest stars of the previous season leave the club. Captain [[Paul Okon]] retired, fan favourite [[Milton Rodriguez]] returned to [[Colombia]] and [[Johnny Warren Medal]] winner [[Nick Carle]] moved to [[Turkey]] to link up with [[Gen\u00e7lerbirli\u011fi S.K.]].

Although significant excitement surrounded the capture of Jardel, as time went by it was obvious he was well past his prime and received little game time.

The Jets went on to play the Mariners in the two legged Major Semi Final. The Jets won the first leg at home 2\u20130 thanks to a first-half header from [[Adam Griffiths]] and a late penalty from his brother [[Joel Griffiths|Joel]].

The first of three options was an emerald jersey with a brown and white stripe going diagonally across the shirt, based on KB United, a team that represented Newcastle in the NSL. The second was a white jersey that featured red down the sides, and blue on the back at the base of the shirt. The final option was a dark grey jersey, with a red and blue diagonal stripe, the same design as the first option. After members chose the emerald green jersey, the club revealed a new home kit. Similar to the home shirt from the previous two seasons, the red and blue stripes became slightly thinner, featuring five stripes on the front of the jersey, opposed to three stripes on the former kit. The stripes were largely replaced on the back of the shirt with a solid blue, yet stripes still featured at the bottom. The three jets from the club's crest were also added to the back of both the home and away kits, located just underneath the neck.<ref name=\"iscsport kit\"/>\n\nA simple blue and red logo with the name \"Newcastle United\" was used during the club's time in the NSL. After joining the A-League, a new logo was designed to incorporate the new name \"Newcastle United Jets\". The name change was done so to project a new image for the club and to prevent confusion with the English side [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] The name \"Jets\" is a reference to [[RAAF Base Williamtown]], located just 20 kilometres north of Newcastle. The club's logo also depicts three [[F/A-18 Hornet]]s, which the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] has based at Williamtown.\n\n==Stadium==\n{{Main|Newcastle International Sports Centre}}\n\n[[File:Ausgrid Stadium.jpg|thumb|right|Western stand of Newcastle International Sports Centre]]\nMcDonald Jones Stadium, at the [[Newcastle International Sports Centre]], is the home ground of the Newcastle Jets and is the home of the [[Newcastle Knights]].

For the first time since its inauguration the Emerging Jets have a home base for their training and fixtures. The Lake Macquarie Regional Football Facility has also been the home of Northern NSW Football since late 2014.\n\nThe program is designed to provide players with the opportunity to develop their skills through access to quality coaching, competitive opportunities and support services.\n\nThe program aims to provide identified players and coaches with the opportunity to reach their full potential.

At the formation of Newcastle United the home ground was moved back to where Newcastle KB United played, now known as [[Newcastle International Sports Centre|McDonald Jones Stadium]].\n\nThe Newcastle United club were reasonably successful, competing in two of the last three Final Series and finishing second in the League behind [[Perth Glory FC|Perth Glory]] in the 2001\u201302 season.<ref>{{Cite book |title=One Fantastic Goal: A Complete History of Football in Australia |last=Thompson |first=Trevor |publisher=ABC Books |year=2006 |isbn=9780733318986 |pages=300\u2013302}}</ref>\n\nThe club renamed itself to the Newcastle United Jets Football Club and launched a new badge at the start of the new national league, the [[A-League]].

The name \"Jets\" is a reference to [[RAAF Base Williamtown]], located just 20 kilometres north of Newcastle. The club's logo depicts three F/A-18 Hornets, which the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] has based at Williamtown.\n\nFormer [[England national football team|England]] and [[Australia national football team|Australia]] manager [[Terry Venables]] was reported as favourite to become the team's technical director, including reports from the Jets, but this was confirmed by Venables' agent as a 'no-go'.<ref name=\"ven\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/Soccer/No-Venables-for-ALeague/2004/11/27/1101495459374.html?from=storylhs |title=No Venables for A-League |last=Hall |first=Matthew |date=28 November 2004 |work=[[The Age]] |publisher=Fairfax Media |location=Melbourne |access-date=14 September 2007}}</ref> Instead, the club signed [[Richard Money]] for the 2005\u20132006 season.

His assistant [[Gary van Egmond]] was the caretaker coach for the remainder of the 2005\u20136 season, and later signed a contract to remain as the coach of the Jets for the next three years.\n\nThe club surprised many observers in the Australian game by signing [[Ned Zelic]], a player who was seen to have severed connections with [[Australia]] after being dropped from the national team.\n\nReports suggested the Jets were attempting to bring former Liverpool and England striker [[Stan Collymore]] out of retirement.<ref name=\"colly1\">{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/football/jets-swoop-for-english-bad-boy-collymore/2006/09/18/1158431649693.html |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |publisher=Fairfax Media |date=19 September 2006 |title=Jets swoop for English bad boy Collymore |accessdate=14 September 2007 |first=Neil |last=Goffet }}</ref> Director of Football [[Remo Nogarotto]] confirmed the club had made a bid to lure Collymore to the [[A-League]] for a four-match guest stint; however, the move had broken down within 24 hours of it being made public.<ref name=\"colly2\">{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/football/onenight-stan-newcastles-courtship-of-collymore-dies-with-thedawn/2006/09/19/1158431712508.html |title=One-night Stan: Newcastle's courtship of Collymore dies with the dawn|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=Fairfax Media |date=20 September 2006 |accessdate=14 September 2007|first=Michael |last=Cockerill }}</ref>\n\nWith the leadership of [[Gary van Egmond]] Newcastle has achieved the highest number of points out of all clubs in their last fourteen games and have also scored the most goals. As a result of their good form under van Egmond, crowds in Newcastle have reached all time highs for soccer&nbsp;\u2013 culminating in a crowd of over 24,000 for their home final against [[Sydney FC]] on 2 February 2007.\n\nNewcastle were eventually eliminated in the preliminary final by Adelaide, the game going to penalties after finishing at 1 all. [[Vaughan Coveny]] and [[Stuart Musialik]] missed their attempts in a shoot-out that ended up at 4\u20133 in favour of Adelaide, costing Newcastle their place in the grand final and a berth in the Asian Champions League.\n\n===Champions of Australia===\n\nSeason 3 of the [[A-League]] saw a number of Newcastle's biggest stars of the previous season leave the club.

It was after the conclusion of that season when it was announced that Newcastle Jets members would vote for the sides new away kit. The first of three options was an emerald jersey with a brown and white stripe going diagonally across the shirt, based on KB United, a team that represented Newcastle in the NSL. The second was a white jersey that featured red down the sides, and blue on the back at the base of the shirt. The final option was a dark grey jersey, with a red and blue diagonal stripe, the same design as the first option. After members chose the emerald green jersey, the club revealed a new home kit. Similar to the home shirt from the previous two seasons, the red and blue stripes became slightly thinner, featuring five stripes on the front of the jersey, opposed to three stripes on the former kit. The stripes were largely replaced on the back of the shirt with a solid blue, yet stripes still featured at the bottom. The three jets from the club's crest were also added to the back of both the home and away kits, located just underneath the neck.<ref name=\"iscsport kit\"/>\n\nA simple blue and red logo with the name \"Newcastle United\" was used during the club's time in the NSL.

The integrated talented player pathway by definition provides a succinct and clearly discernible development program for players from as young as eight years to the National Youth League, A-League and W-League.\n\nIn January 2015 the Emerging Jets Program moved to the Lake Macquarie Regional Football Facility. For the first time since its inauguration the Emerging Jets have a home base for their training and fixtures. The Lake Macquarie Regional Football Facility has also been the home of Northern NSW Football since late 2014.\n\nThe program is designed to provide players with the opportunity to develop their skills through access to quality coaching, competitive opportunities and support services.\n\nThe program aims to provide identified players and coaches with the opportunity to reach their full potential.  The parties also have the aspiration to develop players who have the ability to showcase the region in the world's biggest leagues and inspire future generations of grassroots players and Emerging Jets players.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Newcastle Jets FC W-League]]\n* [[Newcastle Jets FC Youth]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.newcastlejets.com.au/ Official club website]\n\n{{Newcastle Jets FC}}\n{{Navboxes|titlestyle=background:#1034A6; color:#FDD017; border:solid #C41E3A 2px|list1=\n{{A-League}}\n{{National Soccer League}}\n{{Association football in New South Wales}}\n{{Newcastle Sports Teams}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:A-League teams]]\n[[Category:Association football clubs established in 2000]]\n[[Category:Newcastle Jets FC| ]]\n[[Category:Soccer clubs in Newcastle, New South Wales]]\n[[Category:National Soccer League (Australia) teams]]\n[[Category:2000 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Sports teams in Newcastle, New South Wales]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo/generalfixes, replaced: on October 2012 \u2192 in October 2012, teams matches \u2192 team's matches", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_Jets_FC"}

Davis Bend was started in the 1820s by planter Joseph E. Davis (brother of former Confederate president [[Jefferson Davis]]), who intended to create a model [[slavery in the United States|slave]] community on his plantation. Davis was influenced by the utopian ideas of [[Robert Owen]]. He encouraged self-leadership in the slave community, provided a higher standard of nutrition and health and dental care, and allowed slaves to become merchants. In the aftermath of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Davis Bend became an autonomous free community when Davis sold his property to former slave [[Ben Montgomery|Benjamin Montgomery]], who had run a store and been a prominent leader at Davis Bend. The prolonged agricultural depression, falling cotton prices, flooding by the Mississippi River, and white hostility in the region contributed to the economic failure of Davis Bend.\n\n[[Isaiah Montgomery|Isaiah T. Montgomery]] led the founding of Mound Bayou in 1887 in wilderness in northwest Mississippi. The bottomlands of the [[Mississippi Delta|Delta]] were a relatively undeveloped frontier, and blacks had a chance to make money by clearing land and use the profits to buy lands in such frontier areas. By 1900 two-thirds of the owners of land in the bottomlands were black farmers. With the loss of political power due to state [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement]], high debt and continuing agricultural problems, most of them lost their land and by 1920 were landless [[sharecroppers]]. As cotton prices fell, the town suffered a severe economic decline in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nShortly after a fire destroyed much of the business district, Mound Bayou began to revive in 1942 after the opening of the [[Taborian Hospital]] by the [[International Order of Twelve Knights and Daughters of Tabor]], a fraternal organization. For more than two decades, under its Chief Grand Mentor Perry M. Smith, the hospital provided low-cost health care to thousands of blacks in the Mississippi Delta. The chief surgeon was Dr. [[T.R.M. Howard]], who eventually became one of the wealthiest black men in the state. Howard owned a plantation of more than {{convert|1000|acre|sqkm}}, a home-construction firm, a small zoo, and built the first swimming pool for blacks in Mississippi.\n\nIn 1952, [[Medgar Evers]] moved to Mound Bayou to sell insurance for Howard's Magnolia Mutual Life Insurance Company. Howard introduced Evers to civil rights activism through the [[Regional Council of Negro Leadership]] which organized a boycott against service stations that refused to provide restrooms for blacks. The RCNL's annual rallies in Mound Bayou between 1952 and 1955 drew crowds of ten thousand or more. During the trial of [[Emmett Till]]'s killers, black reporters and witnesses stayed in Howard's Mound Bayou home, and Howard gave them an armed escort to the courthouse in [[Sumner, Mississippi|Sumner]].\n\nAuthor [[Michael Premo]] wrote:\n<blockquote>Mound Bayou was an oasis in turbulent times. While the rest of Mississippi was violently segregated, inside the city there were no racial codes ... At a time when blacks faced repercussions as severe as death for registering to vote, Mound Bayou residents were casting ballots in every election. The city has a proud history of credit unions, insurance companies, a hospital, five newspapers, and a variety of businesses owned, operated, and patronized by black residents. Mound Bayou is a crowning achievement in the struggle for self-determination and economic empowerment.<ref>{{cite web\n | last =Premo\n | first =Michael\n | title =Mound Bayou, Mississippi \u2013 The Jewel of the Delta\n | publisher =storycorps.org\n | date =November 10, 2007\n | url =http://storycorps.org/blog-posts/mound-bayou-mississippi-the-jewel-of-the-delta/\n | archive-url =https://archive.today/20130415222613/http://storycorps.org/blog-posts/mound-bayou-mississippi-the-jewel-of-the-delta/\n | url-status =dead\n | archive-date =April 15, 2013\n }}\n</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Education==\n\nFrom its earliest years, Mound Bayou has struggled with inadequate educational infrastructure.

Davis Bend was started in the 1820s by planter Joseph E. Davis (brother of former Confederate president [[Jefferson Davis]]), who intended to create a model [[slavery in the United States|slave]] community on his plantation. Davis was influenced by the utopian ideas of [[Robert Owen]]. He encouraged self-leadership in the slave community, provided a higher standard of nutrition and health and dental care, and allowed slaves to become merchants. In the aftermath of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Davis Bend became an autonomous free community when Davis sold his property to former slave [[Ben Montgomery|Benjamin Montgomery]], who had run a store and been a prominent leader at Davis Bend. The prolonged agricultural depression, falling cotton prices, flooding by the Mississippi River, and white hostility in the region contributed to the economic failure of Davis Bend.\n\n[[Isaiah Montgomery|Isaiah T. Montgomery]] led the founding of Mound Bayou in 1887 in wilderness in northwest Mississippi. The bottomlands of the [[Mississippi Delta|Delta]] were a relatively undeveloped frontier, and blacks had a chance to make money by clearing land and use the profits to buy lands in such frontier areas. By 1900 two-thirds of the owners of land in the bottomlands were black farmers. With the loss of political power due to state [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement]], high debt and continuing agricultural problems, most of them lost their land and by 1920 were landless [[sharecroppers]]. As cotton prices fell, the town suffered a severe economic decline in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nShortly after a fire destroyed much of the business district, Mound Bayou began to revive in 1942 after the opening of the [[Taborian Hospital]] by the [[International Order of Twelve Knights and Daughters of Tabor]], a fraternal organization. For more than two decades, under its Chief Grand Mentor Perry M. Smith, the hospital provided low-cost health care to thousands of blacks in the Mississippi Delta. The chief surgeon was Dr. [[T.R.M. Howard]], who eventually became one of the wealthiest black men in the state. Howard owned a plantation of more than {{convert|1000|acre|sqkm}}, a home-construction firm, a small zoo, and built the first swimming pool for blacks in Mississippi.\n\nIn 1952, [[Medgar Evers]] moved to Mound Bayou to sell insurance for Howard's Magnolia Mutual Life Insurance Company. Howard introduced Evers to civil rights activism through the [[Regional Council of Negro Leadership]] which organized a boycott against service stations that refused to provide restrooms for blacks. The RCNL's annual rallies in Mound Bayou between 1952 and 1955 drew crowds of ten thousand or more. During the trial of [[Emmett Till]]'s killers, black reporters and witnesses stayed in Howard's Mound Bayou home, and Howard gave them an armed escort to the courthouse in [[Sumner, Mississippi|Sumner]].\n\nAuthor [[Michael Premo]] wrote:\n<blockquote>Mound Bayou was an oasis in turbulent times. While the rest of Mississippi was violently segregated, inside the city there were no racial codes ... At a time when blacks faced repercussions as severe as death for registering to vote, Mound Bayou residents were casting ballots in every election. The city has a proud history of credit unions, insurance companies, a hospital, five newspapers, and a variety of businesses owned, operated, and patronized by black residents. Mound Bayou is a crowning achievement in the struggle for self-determination and economic empowerment.<ref>{{cite web\n | last =Premo\n | first =Michael\n | title =Mound Bayou, Mississippi \u2013 The Jewel of the Delta\n | publisher =storycorps.org\n | date =November 10, 2007\n | url =http://storycorps.org/blog-posts/mound-bayou-mississippi-the-jewel-of-the-delta/\n | archive-url =https://archive.today/20130415222613/http://storycorps.org/blog-posts/mound-bayou-mississippi-the-jewel-of-the-delta/\n | url-status =dead\n | archive-date =April 15, 2013\n }}\n</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Education==\n\nFrom its earliest years, Mound Bayou has struggled.with inadequate educational infrastructure.

This organization appeared poised to avoid the political forces that ended earlier organizations, but the outbreak of World War I disorganized the Congress.<ref name=icp>{{cite web|title=The International Criminal Police|url=https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1951-01-01_3_page003.html|website=UNODC|publisher=UNODC|accessdate=8 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1923, a second International Criminal Police Congress was held in Vienna, on the initiative of Mr. Hans Schober, President of the Austrian police. Schober, eager to avoid the politics that doomed previous international police efforts, noted that ''\"ours is not a political but a cultural goal. It only concerns the fight against the common enemy of humankind: the ordinary criminal.\"''<ref name=JSTOR /> This second Congress created the International Criminal Police Commission (ICPC), which served as the direct forerunner of Interpol.<ref name=Interpol>{{cite web|title=History of Interpol|url=http://www.interpol.int/About-INTERPOL/History|website=Interpol|publisher=Interpol|accessdate=8 September 2015}}</ref> Founding members included police officials from Russia, Austria, Germany, Belgium, Poland, China, Egypt, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Sweden, Switzerland and Yugoslavia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fairtrials.net/documents/Interpol_-_FAQs.pdf |title=Interpol: Frequently Asked Questions |date=November 2011 |publisher=[[Fair Trials International]] |format=PDF |accessdate=8 September 2015}}</ref> In 1926, the ICPC's General Assembly, held in Berlin, proposed that each country establish a central point of contact within its police structure: the forerunner of the National Central Bureau (NCB).<ref name=Interpol /> In 1938, the Nazis assumed control of the ICPC and most countries stop participating, effectively causing the ICPC to cease to exist as an international organization.\n\nAfter World War II, Belgium led the rebuilding of the organization, with a new headquarters in Paris and a new name - [[Interpol]]. The United Nations did not recognize Interpol as an intergovernmental organization until 1971.<ref name=Interpol /> On June 17, 1971, President Nixon declared ''\"America's public enemy number one in the United States is drug abuse.

At the time, the flow of illicit narcotics into its borders was deemed a major risk to the health and safety of Americans, and as a result, enormous resources were spent in the effort to curtail both the supply of and demand for illegal drugs. In the three decades that followed President Nixon's declaration, drug trafficking served as the dominant form of what the United States and many of its allies viewed as transnational organized crime.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wechsler|first1=William|title=Combating Transnational Organized Crime|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/html/pdf/WechslerPrepared20120426.pdf|website=Washington Institute|publisher=The Washington Institut for Near East Policy|accessdate=1 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, that viewpoint has changed. The character of transnational organized crime has changed in three major ways since the war on drugs began. Drug trafficking has become more diversified, criminal networks have harnessed new methods of conducting business, and the structure of criminal networks has changed. Organized crime has gone global, giving way to the term transnational organized crime. Global governance has failed to keep pace with economic globalization. [[Antonio Maria Costa]], former Executive Director of the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], effectively summarized the change in TOC over the last quarter century by saying, \"as unprecedented openness in trade, finance, travel and communication has created economic growth and well-being, it has also given rise to massive opportunities for criminals to make their business prosper.\"<ref name=unodc />\n\n==Effects==\nTransnational organized crime is widely opposed on the basis of a number of negative effects. It can undermine democracy, disrupt [[free market]]s, drain national assets, and inhibit the development of stable societies.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} In doing so, it has been argued{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}, national and international criminal groups threaten the security of all nations. The victims of these transnational crime networks are governments that are unstable or not powerful enough to prevent them, with the networks conducting illegal activities that provide them with profits. Transnational organized crimes interrupt peace{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} and stability{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} of nations worldwide, often using [[bribery]], violence, or terror to meet their needs.\n\nTOC is insufficiently understood, according to the Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.<ref name=unodc /> In the most recent full-scale United Nations assessment of TOC, conducted in 2010, the Executive Director states, ''\"there is a lack of information on transnational criminal markets and trends. The few studies that exist have looked at sections of the problem, by sector or country, rather than the big picture. Without a global perspective there cannot be evidence-based policy.\"''<ref name=unodc /> In response to the threat, law enforcement agencies have created a number of effective approaches for '''combating''' this transnational organized crime.<ref>{{cite web|title=Effectively Combating Transnational Organized Crime|url=http://www.nij.gov/topics/crime/organized-crime/pages/effective-practices.aspx#note1|website=National Institute of Justice|publisher=Office of Justice Programs|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nLouise I. Shelley (Director of the [[Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center]] at [[George Mason University]]) has said:\n\n<blockquote>Transnational crime will be a defining issue of the 21st century for policymakers - as defining as the Cold War was for the 20th century and colonialism was for the 19th. Terrorists and transnational crime groups will proliferate because these crime groups are major beneficiaries of globalization. They take advantage of increased travel, trade, rapid money movements, telecommunications and computer links, and are well positioned for growth.<ref>[http://www.american.edu/traccc/] (This article incorporates text from the [[U.S. Department of State]] that is believed to be in the [[public domain]].)</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Combating transnational organized crime==\nMost illicit trafficking begins or ends in the world's greatest economic powers, such as the [[G8|G8 (forum)]]. In other words, the world\u2019s largest trading partners are also the world\u2019s greatest markets for illicit goods and services. Many of these world powers have recently taken steps to combat TOC in a large, collective, international effort with partners and allies. Several organizations around the world have initiated efforts to combat TOC whose success or failure have yet to be determined.<ref>{{cite web|title=Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/nsc/transnational-crime/strategy|website=White House|publisher=National Security Council|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the UN Asia and Far East Institute (UNAFEI), combating transnational organized crime relies first and foremost on effective investigative techniques and prosecutorial tools. Three techniques in particular stand out as the most important in combating transnational organized crime: [[electronic surveillance]], [[undercover operation]]s, and the use of [[confidential informant]]s (CIs),<ref name=unafei>{{cite web|title=Effective Methods to Combat Transnational Organized Crime in Criminal Justice Processes |url=http://www.unafei.or.jp/english/pdf/PDF_rms/no58/58-05.pdf|website=UNAFEI|author=Ohr, Bruce G. |publisher=United Nations|accessdate=4 September 2015}}</ref> with electronic surveillance being the single most important and effective law enforcement tool against TOC.<ref name=unafei /> Electronic surveillance provides reliable, often irrefutable evidence of crimes through a participant's own words or image. This form allows law enforcement to learn of conspirators' plans before they are carried out and is particularly helpful in combating TOC because it enables law enforcement in any country to obtain evidence of co-conspirators in other countries. Obtaining evidence of conspiratorial planning internationally would otherwise be very difficult.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nAfter electronic surveillance, the second most important tool is undercover operations,<ref name=unafei /> Through undercover operations, law enforcement agents can infiltrate the highest levels of organized crime by posing as criminals themselves when real criminals discuss their plans and seek assistance in committing crimes. Over time, agents can gain the confidence of criminals and induce them to reveal information on past or ongoing criminal activities.{{citation needed |date=October 2016}} followed by CIs refers to individuals who are not willing to testify but who provide information or assistance to law enforcement in exchange for money or lenient treatment for their own crimes and with the promise of confidentiality.<ref name=unafei /> In many cases,{{which|date=October 2016}} CIs are engaged in criminal activity themselves and can therefore provide valuable direct evidence regarding the criminal activities being conducted by their criminal associates. Such evidence frequently enables law enforcement officers to obtain warrants authorizing electronic surveillance. In rare cases, the court may order the disclosure of a CIs identity to a defendant, such as when the informant can provide evidence that may exculpate the defendant.{{citation needed |date=October 2016}}\n\n==Enforcement in the United States==\n\n===Tools of Prosecution=== \nThe following are some of the methods used by authorities in the US to combat transnational organised crime:\n* [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|RICO]]\n* [[United States Organized Crime Strike Force|Organized Crime Strike Force Units]]\n* [[Legal immunity|Immunity System]]{{clarify|date=October 2016}}\n* [[Witness Protection|Witness Protection Programs]]\n* [[Forfeiture (law)|Forfeiture]]{{dubious|date=October 2016}}\n* [[Sentence (law)|Sentences]]\n\n===White House Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime===\nIn May 2010, the [[White House]] released its [[National Security Strategy (United States)|National Security Strategy]], detailing the need to aggressive combat transnational organized crime. This strategy document states, ''\"Combating transnational criminal and trafficking networks requires a multidimensional strategy that safeguards citizens, breaks the financial strength of criminal and terrorist networks, disrupts illicit trafficking networks, defeats transnational criminal organizations, fights government corruption, strengthens the rule of law, bolsters judicial systems, and improves transparency. While these are major challenges, the United States will be able to devise and execute a collective strategy with other nations facing the same threats.\"''<ref>{{cite web|title=NATIONAL SECURITY  STRATEGY: May 2010|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/national_security_strategy.pdf|website=The White House|publisher=The White House|accessdate=4 September 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927091224/https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/national_security_strategy.pdf|archive-date=27 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2011, the [[White House]] released its '''Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime''', which reflects this change and sets forth a strategy \"''to build, balance, and integrate the tools of American power to combat transnational organized crime and related threats to national security\u2014and to urge our foreign partners to do the same.''\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime: Executive Summary|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/nsc/transnational-crime/summary|website=White House|publisher=National Security Council|accessdate=1 September 2015}}</ref> This strategy document set out five overarching policy objectives consistent with the vision and priorities of the National Security Strategy:\n\n# ''Protect Americans and our partners from the harm, violence, and exploitation of transnational criminal networks.'' \n# ''Help partner countries strengthen governance and transparency, break the corruptive power of transnational criminal networks, and sever state-crime alliances.'' \n# ''Break the economic power of transnational criminal networks and protect strategic markets and the U.S. financial system from TOC penetration and abuse.'' \n# ''Defeat transnational criminal networks that pose the greatest threat to national security, by targeting their infrastructures, depriving them of their enabling means, and preventing the criminal facilitation of terrorist activities.''\n# ''Build international consensus, multilateral cooperation, and public-private partnerships to defeat transnational organized crime.''\n\n===Enforcement agencies of the United States===\n\n====National Guard====\nIn keeping with the [[U.S. National Security Council]]'s strategy to combat transnational organized crime, the [[National Guard Bureau]] established the CTOC [[Center of Excellence|Center of Excellence (COE)]] to educate and train [[Unified Combatant Command|Combatant Commands]], military services, [[List of federal agencies in the United States|federal agencies]], state and local law enforcement, and community leaders.<ref>{{cite web|title=CTOC Center of Excellence|url=http://ctoc.gov|website=CTOC Center of Excellence|publisher=National Guard Burea|accessdate=2 September 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031024757/http://ctoc.gov/|archive-date=31 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nAnother approach the United States takes in CTOC is the use of multijurisdictional task forces that combine investigative resources from several agencies so that the strength and sophistication of a task force's capabilities are greater than any single agency. Collaboration among law enforcement agencies is a key element in discovering possible links between local crimes and crimes with a transnational component.<ref>{{cite web|title=Effectively Combating Transnational Organized Crime|url=http://www.nij.gov/topics/crime/organized-crime/pages/effective-practices.aspx#note1|website=Office of Justice Programs|publisher=National Institute of Justice|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe National Guard Bureau uses such an organization in CTOC. Its [[Multijurisdictional Counterdrug Task Force Training]] (MCTFT) program and its Western Regional Counterdrug Training Center provide the core of National Guard Bureau training and collaboration among law enforcement agencies at all levels.<ref>{{cite web|title=MCTFT|url=http://mctft.org|website=MCTFT|publisher=National Guard Bureau|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n====United States Southern Command====\n{{main|United States Southern Command}} As the lead U.S. agency responsible for directing illicit trafficking detection and monitoring activities, [[U.S. Southern Command]] (SOUTHCOM) conducts operational and tactical activities in support of whole-of-government efforts to combat transnational organized crime in the maritime approaches to Central America. SOUTHCOM focuses on strengthening the security capacities of U.S. partners in Central America.<ref name=ussouthcom>{{cite web|title=Countering Transnational Organized Crime|url=http://www.southcom.mil/ourmissions/Pages/Countering%20Transnational%20Organized%20Crime.aspx|website=USSOUTHCOM|publisher=USSOUTHCOM|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nAnother primary focus of SOUTHCOM CTOC efforts is supporting the interdiction of drug trafficking. SOUTHCOM collaborates with other agencies and nations to support CTOC efforts through detection & monitoring, information sharing, and partner nation capacity building.<ref name=ussouthcom />\n\n====Department of Homeland Security====\nCharged with securing the United States, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) plays an integral role in the U.S. efforts to combat transnational organized crime both at home and with partners abroad. DHS leverages and deploys numerous CTOC resources, while working closely with other federal, state and local agencies, foreign governments and partners in the private sector. Once TOC threats are identified, DHS works with partners to interdict them through strengthened interdiction, investigations, and prosecutions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Combating Transnational Organized Crime|url=https://www.dhs.gov/blog/2011/07/25/combating-transnational-organized-crime|website=Department of Homeland Security|publisher=Department of Homeland Security|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Department of State====\nThe [[Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs]] (INL), an agency of the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]], conducts CTOC operations at home and abroad by delivering justice and fairness and by strengthening police, courts, and corrections systems. These efforts reduce the amount of crime and illegal drugs reaching U.S. shores.<ref name=DOS>{{cite web|title=DoS CTOC efforts|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/inl|website=Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL)|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nINL CTOC efforts include helping foreign governments build effective law enforcement institutions that combat transnational organized crime, everything from money laundering, cybercrime, and intellectual property theft to trafficking in goods, people, weapons, drugs, or endangered wildlife. INL combats corruption by helping governments build transparent and accountable public institutions\u2014a cornerstone of strong, stable, and fair societies that offer a level playing field for U.S. businesses abroad.<ref name=DOS />\n\n====Department of Treasury====\nEstablished in 1990, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) provides investigative support to law enforcement, intelligence, and regulatory agencies, cooperating globally with counterpart financial intelligence units (FIUs), and uses its regulatory authorities to make it more difficult for organized criminal groups to move money through the financial system. FinCEN supports the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]]'s efforts to promote the adoption of international standards involving anti-money laundering and the counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), including through the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) where FinCEN led the delegation from 1994 through 1998. The National Security Council identified FinCEN as one of 34 Federal entities that it considered as having a significant role in the fight against international crime as noted in an August 2001 Government Accountability Office report.\n\nIn 2012, the Department of Treasury imposed sanctions on four key transnational organized crime groups: [[Camorra]] from [[Italy]], [[Brothers' Circle]] from [[Russia]], the [[Yamaguchi-gumi]] ([[Yakuza]]) from Japan, and [[Los Zetas]] from [[Mexico]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=David|title=Combating Transnational Organized Crime|url=http://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Pages/Combating-Transnational-Organized-Crime.aspx|publisher=[[United States Department of the Treasury]]|accessdate=26 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Drug Enforcement Administration====\nThe strength and sophistication of a task force's capabilities will be stronger than any single agency's if the task force is multijurisdictional, combining investigative resources from several agencies.<ref>http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/nsc/transnational-crime</ref> The key element in finding out possible links between local crimes and crimes with transnational component is collaboration among law enforcement agencies. To illustrate further, Operation Trifecta, a 19-month transnational investigation led by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), involved 9 Federal agencies and 67 State and local law enforcement agencies from 8 States. In 2003, it led to the arrests of some 240 individuals charged with transnational drug trafficking.\n\n====Federal Bureau of Investigation====\nLaw enforcement agencies such as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) are employed by nation-states to counteract international organized crime. Serious international crime\u2014such as crimes against humanity\u2014may be investigated by the International Criminal Court, but that Court does not have the power to take suspects into custody, instead relying on the support of law enforcement and military force in relevant countries.\n\n==International Enforcement Agencies==\n\n===United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime===\nOn November 15, 2000, the [[United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime]] (UNTOC) was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] and is appointed to serve as the most significant mechanism for fighting TOC internationally. The first of its kind, the convention identified TOC as criminal actions that cannot be sufficiently combated by pacts tailored to a single commercial enterprise.<ref name=UNTOC>{{cite web|title=The Global Regime for Transnational Crime|url=http://www.cfr.org/transnational-crime/global-regime-transnational-crime/p28656|website=Council on Foreign Relations|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=8 September 2015}}</ref> The Ad Hoc Committee was established by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] to deal with this problem by taking a series of measures against transnational organized crime. These include the creation of domestic criminal offences to combat the problem, and the adoption of new, sweeping frameworks for mutual legal assistance, extradition, law-enforcement cooperation, and technical assistance and training.\n\n{{citation needed span|text=A recent report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime highlighted that Southeast Asia produced an estimated 48 tons of heroin in 2011. The vast majority of this cultivation \u2013 roughly twice that of Afghanistan, which arguably receives much greater attention \u2013 has occurred in the fragile state of Myanmar. The UN report estimated that the revenue generated from this trade to be worth $16.3 billion during the same period.|date=October 2016}}\n\n{{citation needed span|text=The revenues generated from such trafficking often lie at the root of instability and violence in the region. Additionally, the same routes used to smuggle drugs will likely be used to transport weapons and militants in the event that the current conflict expands. Reconciling the numerous armed ethnic groups that exist within Myanmar continues to be a challenge for the nascent government. A strong drug trade will only complicate negotiations between government officials and these groups.|date=October 2016}}\n\nCombating TOC internationally proves difficult because so many governments and economies benefit enormously from TOC. For example, the Russia government benefits from money gained through cybercrime and through ties between TOC and it energy exporters. China\u2019s economy also benefits from cybercrime as well as from counterfeiting. West African and Latin American politicians are either coerced by or maintain financially beneficial relationships with drug traffickers.<ref name=UNTOC />\n\nUNTOC ability to help combat CTOC is compounded by its inability to directly assist countries that are incapable of adhering to the convention\u2019s guidelines. Most countries agreed for a necessary, innovative, and more strategic approach at the 2010 conference of parties, yet to date no significant employment of tactics or policy has been determined. Voluntary contributions account for nearly all of UNODC\u2019s funding and the organization suffers from chronic funding and staffing shortages. This limits UNODC\u2019s overall effectiveness.<ref name=UNTOC />\n\nThe UN General Assembly has also issued many resolutions to combat TOC; however, most have been ineffective because of their vagueness and irrelevancy.<ref name=UNTOC />\n\n===Interpol===\nThe idea of the organization known today as [[Interpol]] was born at the first International Criminal Police Congress, held in Monaco in 1914. It was officially created in 1923 with the name, International Criminal Police Commission, and renamed in 1956 with the name, Interpol. Today, it is the largest international police organization in the world and is made up of 190 member nations. Each member nation staffs a national central bureau that communicates and cooperates with other member nations. Its mission is ''\"\"Preventing and fighting crime through enhanced cooperation and innovation on police and security matters\"''.<ref name=Interpol2>{{cite web|title=Interpol Overview|url=http://www.interpol.int/About-INTERPOL/Overview|website=Interpol|publisher=Interpol|accessdate=8 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the organization Interpol exists to coordinate intelligence efforts between national law enforcement agencies, it is not an international police force{{clarify|date=October 2016}}, and indeed no such international law enforcement body with universal jurisdiction exists.\n\nThe agency's number one priority is to maintain a secure global police information system between the National Central Bureaus of each member nation. In addition to this priority, Interpol provides round-the-clock support to police and law enforcement agencies of all member nations. It also continuously attempts to innovate and enhance the tools used to fight crime and it assists in the identification of crimes and criminals.  Finally, it delivers high-level training, certification and accreditation to law enforcement personnel.<ref name=Interpol2 />\n\nLike most international CTOC organizations, Interpol suffers from continuously high levels of underfunding. In 2010, it operated on roughly $75 million budget. Since it holds no authority to conduct independent investigations or to arrest suspects, it is only as strong as the host country's police force.<ref name=Interpol2 />\n\n===World Bank===\nWith a membership of 188 nations, the [[World Bank]] is nearly the same size as Interpol (190) and although CTOC is not its primary mission, the World Bank does attempt to combat TOC by conducting assessments of anti-money laundering provisions and carrying out anti-corruption efforts. Its efforts are hindered, however, by the lack of concrete mandates and authorities. In a 2009 World Bank paper entitled, \"Slavery and Human Trafficking International Law and the Role of the World Bank\", the author states that \"the World Bank\u2019s mandate appears to permit preventive action\", thereby lending doubt whether or not the World Bank is even permitted by UN mandate to involve itself in the fight against human trafficking.<ref name=WorldBank>{{cite web|title=Slavery and Human Trafficking  International Law and the  Role of the World Bank|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/SOCIALPROTECTION/Resources/SP-Discussion-papers/Labor-Market-DP/0904.pdf|website=World Bank|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=8 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nRecognizing the detrimental impact on its mission{{clarify|date=October 2016}}, the World Bank made a $1.5 billion pledge in 2011 to help combat TOC in the coming years.<ref name=UNTOC />\n\nIn another CTOC initiative, the World Bank is partnered with the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] in the Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative (StAR). This initiative helps to recover corruption related proceeds by creating an effective and collaborative environment for global law enforcement policy development.<ref name=WorldBank />\n\n===International Monetary Fund===\nThe [[International Monetary Fund]] also conducts assessments of anti-money laundering provisions in countries.<ref name=\"UNTOC\"/>\n\n===Europol===\n[[Europol]] is the law enforcement agency of the [[European Union|European Union (EU)]] whose main goal is to help achieve a safer Europe for the benefit of all EU citizens. The organization does so by assisting the EU Member States in their fight against serious international crime and terrorism.<ref name=Europol>{{cite web|title=About Europol|url=https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/page/about-europol-17|website=Europol|publisher=Europol|accessdate=8 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nEuropol officers hold no authority to conduct arrests but they support EU law enforcement colleagues by gathering, analyzing and disseminating information and coordinating operations. Europol uses the information to prevent, detect and investigate offenses, and to track down and prosecute those who commit them.

The objectives of the FATF are to ''\"set standards and promote effective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering, terrorist financing and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system.\"'' To this end, the FATF developed a number of recommendations that have been recognized by law enforcement agencies around the world as the standard in the combating of TOC; specifically in the fight against money laundering, terror financing, and the proliferation of [[weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]].<ref name=FATF>{{cite web|title=Who is FATF|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/pages/aboutus/|website=FATF|publisher=FATF|accessdate=8 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nTo help combat CTOC, the FATF maintains a policy that has proven successful thus far, in which it \"names and shames\" that jurisdictions that choose to not cooperate with FATF.

At the time, the flow of illicit narcotics into its borders was deemed a major risk to the health and safety of Americans, and as a result, enormous resources were spent in the effort to curtail both the supply of and demand for illegal drugs. In the three decades that followed President Nixon's declaration, drug trafficking served as the dominant form of what the United States and many of its allies viewed as transnational organized crime.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wechsler|first1=William|title=Combating Transnational Organized Crime|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/html/pdf/WechslerPrepared20120426.pdf|website=Washington Institute|publisher=The Washington Institut for Near East Policy|accessdate=1 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, that viewpoint has changed. The character of transnational organized crime has changed in three major ways since the war on drugs began. Drug trafficking has become more diversified, criminal networks have harnessed new methods of conducting business, and the structure of criminal networks has changed. Organized crime has gone global, giving way to the term transnational organized crime. Global governance has failed to keep pace with economic globalization. [[Antonio Maria Costa]], former Executive Director of the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], effectively summarized the change in TOC over the last quarter century by saying, \"as unprecedented openness in trade, finance, travel and communication has created economic growth and well-being, it has also given rise to massive opportunities for criminals to make their business prosper.\"<ref name=unodc />\n\n==Effects==\nTransnational organized crime is widely opposed on the basis of a number of negative effects. It can undermine democracy, disrupt [[free market]]s, drain national assets, and inhibit the development of stable societies.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} In doing so, it has been argued{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}, national and international criminal groups threaten the security of all nations. The victims of these transnational crime networks are governments that are unstable or not powerful enough to prevent them, with the networks conducting illegal activities that provide them with profits. Transnational organized crimes interrupt peace{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} and stability{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} of nations worldwide, often using [[bribery]], violence, or terror to meet their needs.\n\nTOC is insufficiently understood, according to the Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.<ref name=unodc /> In the most recent full-scale United Nations assessment of TOC, conducted in 2010, the Executive Director states, ''\"there is a lack of information on transnational criminal markets and trends. The few studies that exist have looked at sections of the problem, by sector or country, rather than the big picture. Without a global perspective there cannot be evidence-based policy.\"''<ref name=unodc /> In response to the threat, law enforcement agencies have created a number of effective approaches for '''combating''' this transnational organized crime.<ref>{{cite web|title=Effectively Combating Transnational Organized Crime|url=http://www.nij.gov/topics/crime/organized-crime/pages/effective-practices.aspx#note1|website=National Institute of Justice|publisher=Office of Justice Programs|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nLouise I. Shelley (Director of the [[Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center]] at [[George Mason University]]) has said:\n\n<blockquote>Transnational crime will be a defining issue of the 21st century for policymakers - as defining as the Cold War was for the 20th century and colonialism was for the 19th. Terrorists and transnational crime groups will proliferate because these crime groups are major beneficiaries of globalization. They take advantage of increased travel, trade, rapid money movements, telecommunications and computer links, and are well positioned for growth.<ref>[http://www.american.edu/traccc/] (This article incorporates text from the [[U.S. Department of State]] that is believed to be in the [[public domain]].)</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Combating transnational organized crime==\nMost illicit trafficking begins or ends in the world's greatest economic powers, such as the [[G8|G8 (forum)]]. In other words, the world\u2019s largest trading partners are also the world\u2019s greatest markets for illicit goods and services. Many of these world powers have recently taken steps to combat TOC in a large, collective, international effort with partners and allies. Several organizations around the world have initiated efforts to combat TOC whose success or failure have yet to be determined.<ref>{{cite web|title=Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/nsc/transnational-crime/strategy|website=White House|publisher=National Security Council|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the UN Asia and Far East Institute (UNAFEI), combating transnational organized crime relies first and foremost on effective investigative techniques and prosecutorial tools. Three techniques in particular stand out as the most important in combating transnational organized crime: [[electronic surveillance]], [[undercover operation]]s, and the use of [[confidential informant]]s (CIs),<ref name=unafei>{{cite web|title=Effective Methods to Combat Transnational Organized Crime in Criminal Justice Processes |url=http://www.unafei.or.jp/english/pdf/PDF_rms/no58/58-05.pdf|website=UNAFEI|author=Ohr, Bruce G. |publisher=United Nations|accessdate=4 September 2015}}</ref> with electronic surveillance being the single most important and effective law enforcement tool against TOC.<ref name=unafei /> Electronic surveillance provides reliable, often irrefutable evidence of crimes through a participant's own words or image. This form allows law enforcement to learn of conspirators' plans before they are carried out and is particularly helpful in combating TOC because it enables law enforcement in any country to obtain evidence of co-conspirators in other countries. Obtaining evidence of conspiratorial planning internationally would otherwise be very difficult.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nAfter electronic surveillance, the second most important tool is undercover operations,<ref name=unafei /> Through undercover operations, law enforcement agents can infiltrate the highest levels of organized crime by posing as criminals themselves when real criminals discuss their plans and seek assistance in committing crimes. Over time, agents can gain the confidence of criminals and induce them to reveal information on past or ongoing criminal activities.{{citation needed |date=October 2016}} followed by CIs refers to individuals who are not willing to testify but who provide information or assistance to law enforcement in exchange for money or lenient treatment for their own crimes and with the promise of confidentiality.<ref name=unafei /> In many cases,{{which|date=October 2016}} CIs are engaged in criminal activity themselves and can therefore provide valuable direct evidence regarding the criminal activities being conducted by their criminal associates. Such evidence frequently enables law enforcement officers to obtain warrants authorizing electronic surveillance. In rare cases, the court may order the disclosure of a CIs identity to a defendant, such as when the informant can provide evidence that may exculpate the defendant.{{citation needed |date=October 2016}}\n\n==Enforcement in the United States==\n\n===Tools of Prosecution=== \nThe following are some of the methods used by authorities in the US to combat transnational organised crime:\n* [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|RICO]]\n* [[United States Organized Crime Strike Force|Organized Crime Strike Force Units]]\n* [[Legal immunity|Immunity System]]{{clarify|date=October 2016}}\n* [[Witness Protection|Witness Protection Programs]]\n* [[Forfeiture (law)|Forfeiture]]{{dubious|date=October 2016}}\n* [[Sentence (law)|Sentences]]\n\n===White House Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime===\nIn May 2010, the [[White House]] released its [[National Security Strategy (United States)|National Security Strategy]], detailing the need to aggressive combat transnational organized crime. This strategy document states, ''\"Combating transnational criminal and trafficking networks requires a multidimensional strategy that safeguards citizens, breaks the financial strength of criminal and terrorist networks, disrupts illicit trafficking networks, defeats transnational criminal organizations, fights government corruption, strengthens the rule of law, bolsters judicial systems, and improves transparency. While these are major challenges, the United States will be able to devise and execute a collective strategy with other nations facing the same threats.\"''<ref>{{cite web|title=NATIONAL SECURITY  STRATEGY: May 2010|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/national_security_strategy.pdf|website=The White House|publisher=The White House|accessdate=4 September 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927091224/https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/national_security_strategy.pdf|archive-date=27 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2011, the [[White House]] released its '''Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime''', which reflects this change and sets forth a strategy \"''to build, balance, and integrate the tools of American power to combat transnational organized crime and related threats to national security\u2014and to urge our foreign partners to do the same.''\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime: Executive Summary|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/nsc/transnational-crime/summary|website=White House|publisher=National Security Council|accessdate=1 September 2015}}</ref> This strategy document set out five overarching policy objectives consistent with the vision and priorities of the National Security Strategy:\n\n# ''Protect Americans and our partners from the harm, violence, and exploitation of transnational criminal networks.'' \n# ''Help partner countries strengthen governance and transparency, break the corruptive power of transnational criminal networks, and sever state-crime alliances.'' \n# ''Break the economic power of transnational criminal networks and protect strategic markets and the U.S. financial system from TOC penetration and abuse.'' \n# ''Defeat transnational criminal networks that pose the greatest threat to national security, by targeting their infrastructures, depriving them of their enabling means, and preventing the criminal facilitation of terrorist activities.''\n# ''Build international consensus, multilateral cooperation, and public-private partnerships to defeat transnational organized crime.''\n\n===Enforcement agencies of the United States===\n\n====National Guard====\nIn keeping with the [[U.S. National Security Council]]'s strategy to combat transnational organized crime, the [[National Guard Bureau]] established the CTOC [[Center of Excellence|Center of Excellence (COE)]] to educate and train [[Unified Combatant Command|Combatant Commands]], military services, [[List of federal agencies in the United States|federal agencies]], state and local law enforcement, and community leaders.<ref>{{cite web|title=CTOC Center of Excellence|url=http://ctoc.gov|website=CTOC Center of Excellence|publisher=National Guard Burea|accessdate=2 September 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031024757/http://ctoc.gov/|archive-date=31 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nAnother approach the United States takes in CTOC is the use of multijurisdictional task forces that combine investigative resources from several agencies so that the strength and sophistication of a task force's capabilities are greater than any single agency. Collaboration among law enforcement agencies is a key element in discovering possible links between local crimes and crimes with a transnational component.<ref>{{cite web|title=Effectively Combating Transnational Organized Crime|url=http://www.nij.gov/topics/crime/organized-crime/pages/effective-practices.aspx#note1|website=Office of Justice Programs|publisher=National Institute of Justice|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe National Guard Bureau uses such an organization in CTOC. Its [[Multijurisdictional Counterdrug Task Force Training]] (MCTFT) program and its Western Regional Counterdrug Training Center provide the core of National Guard Bureau training and collaboration among law enforcement agencies at all levels.<ref>{{cite web|title=MCTFT|url=http://mctft.org|website=MCTFT|publisher=National Guard Bureau|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n====United States Southern Command====\n{{main|United States Southern Command}} As the lead U.S. agency responsible for directing illicit trafficking detection and monitoring activities, [[U.S. Southern Command]] (SOUTHCOM) conducts operational and tactical activities in support of whole-of-government efforts to combat transnational organized crime in the maritime approaches to Central America.

SOUTHCOM collaborates with other agencies and nations to support CTOC efforts through detection & monitoring, information sharing, and partner nation capacity building.<ref name=ussouthcom />\n\n====Department of Homeland Security====\nCharged with securing the United States, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) plays an integral role in the U.S. efforts to combat transnational organized crime both at home and with partners abroad. DHS leverages and deploys numerous CTOC resources, while working closely with other federal, state and local agencies, foreign governments and partners in the private sector. Once TOC threats are identified, DHS works with partners to interdict them through strengthened interdiction, investigations, and prosecutions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Combating Transnational Organized Crime|url=https://www.dhs.gov/blog/2011/07/25/combating-transnational-organized-crime|website=Department of Homeland Security|publisher=Department of Homeland Security|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Department of State====\nThe [[Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs]] (INL), an agency of the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]], conducts CTOC operations at home and abroad by delivering justice and fairness and by strengthening police, courts, and corrections systems. These efforts reduce the amount of crime and illegal drugs reaching U.S. shores.<ref name=DOS>{{cite web|title=DoS CTOC efforts|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/inl|website=Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL)|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nINL CTOC efforts include helping foreign governments build effective law enforcement institutions that combat transnational organized crime, everything from money laundering, cybercrime, and intellectual property theft to trafficking in goods, people, weapons, drugs, or endangered wildlife. INL combats corruption by helping governments build transparent and accountable public institutions\u2014a cornerstone of strong, stable, and fair societies that offer a level playing field for U.S. businesses abroad.<ref name=DOS />\n\n====Department of Treasury====\nEstablished in 1990, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) provides investigative support to law enforcement, intelligence, and regulatory agencies, cooperating globally with counterpart financial intelligence units (FIUs), and uses its regulatory authorities to make it more difficult for organized criminal groups to move money through the financial system. FinCEN supports the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]]'s efforts to promote the adoption of international standards involving anti-money laundering and the counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), including through the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) where FinCEN led the delegation from 1994 through 1998. The National Security Council identified FinCEN as one of 34 Federal entities that it considered as having a significant role in the fight against international crime as noted in an August 2001 Government Accountability Office report.\n\nIn 2012, the Department of Treasury imposed sanctions on four key transnational organized crime groups: [[Camorra]] from [[Italy]], [[Brothers' Circle]] from [[Russia]], the [[Yamaguchi-gumi]] ([[Yakuza]]) from Japan, and [[Los Zetas]] from [[Mexico]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=David|title=Combating Transnational Organized Crime|url=http://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Pages/Combating-Transnational-Organized-Crime.aspx|publisher=[[United States Department of the Treasury]]|accessdate=26 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Drug Enforcement Administration====\nThe strength and sophistication of a task force's capabilities will be stronger than any single agency's if the task force is multijurisdictional, combining investigative resources from several agencies.<ref>http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/nsc/transnational-crime</ref> The key element in finding out possible links between local crimes and crimes with transnational component is collaboration among law enforcement agencies. To illustrate further, Operation Trifecta, a 19-month transnational investigation led by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), involved 9 Federal agencies and 67 State and local law enforcement agencies from 8 States. In 2003, it led to the arrests of some 240 individuals charged with transnational drug trafficking.\n\n====Federal Bureau of Investigation====\nLaw enforcement agencies such as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) are employed by nation-states to counteract international organized crime. Serious international crime\u2014such as crimes against humanity\u2014may be investigated by the International Criminal Court, but that Court does not have the power to take suspects into custody, instead relying on the support of law enforcement and military force in relevant countries.\n\n==International Enforcement Agencies==\n\n===United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime===\nOn November 15, 2000, the [[United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime]] (UNTOC) was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] and is appointed to serve as the most significant mechanism for fighting TOC internationally. The first of its kind, the convention identified TOC as criminal actions that cannot be sufficiently combated by pacts tailored to a single commercial enterprise.<ref name=UNTOC>{{cite web|title=The Global Regime for Transnational Crime|url=http://www.cfr.org/transnational-crime/global-regime-transnational-crime/p28656|website=Council on Foreign Relations|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=8 September 2015}}</ref> The Ad Hoc Committee was established by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] to deal with this problem by taking a series of measures against transnational organized crime. These include the creation of domestic criminal offences to combat the problem, and the adoption of new, sweeping frameworks for mutual legal assistance, extradition, law-enforcement cooperation, and technical assistance and training.\n\n{{citation needed span|text=A recent report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime highlighted that Southeast Asia produced an estimated 48 tons of heroin in 2011. The vast majority of this cultivation \u2013 roughly twice that of Afghanistan, which arguably receives much greater attention \u2013 has occurred in the fragile state of Myanmar. The UN report estimated that the revenue generated from this trade to be worth $16.3 billion during the same period.|date=October 2016}}\n\n{{citation needed span|text=The revenues generated from such trafficking often lie at the root of instability and violence in the region. Additionally, the same routes used to smuggle drugs will likely be used to transport weapons and militants in the event that the current conflict expands. Reconciling the numerous armed ethnic groups that exist within Myanmar continues to be a challenge for the nascent government. A strong drug trade will only complicate negotiations between government officials and these groups.|date=October 2016}}\n\nCombating TOC internationally proves difficult because so many governments and economies benefit enormously from TOC. For example, the Russia government benefits from money gained through cybercrime and through ties between TOC and it energy exporters. China\u2019s economy also benefits from cybercrime as well as from counterfeiting. West African and Latin American politicians are either coerced by or maintain financially beneficial relationships with drug traffickers.<ref name=UNTOC />\n\nUNTOC ability to help combat CTOC is compounded by its inability to directly assist countries that are incapable of adhering to the convention\u2019s guidelines. Most countries agreed for a necessary, innovative, and more strategic approach at the 2010 conference of parties, yet to date no significant employment of tactics or policy has been determined. Voluntary contributions account for nearly all of UNODC\u2019s funding and the organization suffers from chronic funding and staffing shortages. This limits UNODC\u2019s overall effectiveness.<ref name=UNTOC />\n\nThe UN General Assembly has also issued many resolutions to combat TOC; however, most have been ineffective because of their vagueness and irrelevancy.<ref name=UNTOC />\n\n===Interpol===\nThe idea of the organization known today as [[Interpol]] was born at the first International Criminal Police Congress, held in Monaco in 1914. It was officially created in 1923 with the name, International Criminal Police Commission, and renamed in 1956 with the name, Interpol. Today, it is the largest international police organization in the world and is made up of 190 member nations. Each member nation staffs a national central bureau that communicates and cooperates with other member nations. Its mission is ''\"\"Preventing and fighting crime through enhanced cooperation and innovation on police and security matters\"''.<ref name=Interpol2>{{cite web|title=Interpol Overview|url=http://www.interpol.int/About-INTERPOL/Overview|website=Interpol|publisher=Interpol|accessdate=8 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the organization Interpol exists to coordinate intelligence efforts between national law enforcement agencies, it is not an international police force{{clarify|date=October 2016}}, and indeed no such international law enforcement body with universal jurisdiction exists.\n\nThe agency's number one priority is to maintain a secure global police information system between the National Central Bureaus of each member nation. In addition to this priority, Interpol provides round-the-clock support to police and law enforcement agencies of all member nations. It also continuously attempts to innovate and enhance the tools used to fight crime and it assists in the identification of crimes and criminals.  Finally, it delivers high-level training, certification and accreditation to law enforcement personnel.<ref name=Interpol2 />\n\nLike most international CTOC organizations, Interpol suffers from continuously high levels of underfunding. In 2010, it operated on roughly $75 million budget. Since it holds no authority to conduct independent investigations or to arrest suspects, it is only as strong as the host country's police force.<ref name=Interpol2 />\n\n===World Bank===\nWith a membership of 188 nations, the [[World Bank]] is nearly the same size as Interpol (190) and although CTOC is not its primary mission, the World Bank does attempt to combat TOC by conducting assessments of anti-money laundering provisions and carrying out anti-corruption efforts. Its efforts are hindered, however, by the lack of concrete mandates and authorities. In a 2009 World Bank paper entitled, \"Slavery and Human Trafficking International Law and the Role of the World Bank\", the author states that \"the World Bank\u2019s mandate appears to permit preventive action\", thereby lending doubt whether or not the World Bank is even permitted by UN mandate to involve itself in the fight against human trafficking.<ref name=WorldBank>{{cite web|title=Slavery and Human Trafficking  International Law and the  Role of the World Bank|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/SOCIALPROTECTION/Resources/SP-Discussion-papers/Labor-Market-DP/0904.pdf|website=World Bank|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=8 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nRecognizing the detrimental impact on its mission{{clarify|date=October 2016}}, the World Bank made a $1.5 billion pledge in 2011 to help combat TOC in the coming years.<ref name=UNTOC />\n\nIn another CTOC initiative, the World Bank is partnered with the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] in the Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative (StAR).
