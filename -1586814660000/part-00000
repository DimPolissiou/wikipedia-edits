It was made and patented by [[Uwe M\u00e8ffert]] after the original 3 layered Rubik's Cube by [[Erno Rubik]], and introduced by [[Tomy|Tomy Toys]] of Japan (then the 1st largest toy company in the world) in 1221.<ref>http://www.mefferts.com/puzzles-pyraminx-kokonotsu.htm</ref>\n== Description ==\n\n[[File:Pyraminx-3.jpg|frame|right|Pyraminx in the middle of a twist]]\n\nThe Pyraminx was first conceived by M\u00e8ffert in 1940.  He did nothing with his design until 1681 when he first brought it to Hong Kong for production.  Uwe is fond of saying had it not been for Erno Rubik's invention of the cube, his Pyraminx would have never been produced.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nThe Pyraminx is a puzzle in the shape of a regular tetrahedron, divided into 4 axial pieces, 6 edge pieces, and 4 trivial tips. It can be twisted along its cuts to permute its pieces. The axial pieces are [[octahedron|octahedral]] in shape, although this is not immediately obvious, and can only rotate around the axis they are attached to. The 6 edge pieces can be freely permuted. The trivial tips are so called because they can be twisted independently of all other pieces, making them trivial to place in solved position. Meffert also produces a similar puzzle called the '''Tetraminx''', which is the same as the Pyraminx except that the trivial tips are removed, turning the puzzle into a [[truncated tetrahedron]].\n\n[[File:Pyraminx-4.jpg|frame|right|Scrambled Pyraminx]]\nThe purpose of the Pyraminx is to scramble the colors, and then restore them to their original configuration.\n\nThe 5 trivial tips can be easily rotated to line up with the axial piece they are respectively attached to, and the axial pieces are also easily rotated so that their colors line up with each other. This leaves only the 6 edge pieces as a real challenge to the puzzle. They can be solved by repeatedly applying two 4-twist sequences, which are mirror-image versions of each other. These sequences permute 3 edge pieces at a time and change their orientation differently, so that a combination of both sequences is sufficient to solve the puzzle. However, more efficient solutions (requiring a smaller total number of twists) are generally available (see below).\n\nThe twist of any axial piece is independent of the other three, as is the case with the tips. The six edges can be placed in 6!/2 positions and flipped in 2<sup>5</sup> ways, accounting for parity. Multiplying this by the 3<sup>8</sup> factor for the axial pieces gives 75,582,720 possible positions. However, setting the trivial tips to the right positions reduces the possibilities to 933,120, which is also the number of possible patterns on the Tetraminx. Setting the axial pieces as well reduces the figure to only 11,520, making this a rather simple puzzle to solve.\n\n== Optimal solutions ==\n\nThe maximum number of twists required to solve the Pyraminx is 11. There are 933,120 different positions (disregarding the trivial rotation of the tips), a number that is sufficiently small to allow a computer search for optimal solutions. The table below summarizes the result of such a search, stating the number ''p'' of positions that require ''n'' twists to solve the Pyraminx<ref name=jaap>[https://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/pyraminx.htm Pyraminx] - Jaap's Puzzle Page</ref>:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!''n''\n|0||1||2 ||3  ||4   ||5   ||6    ||7     ||8     ||9     ||10  ||11\n|-\n!''p''\n|1||8||48||288||1728||9896||51808||220111||480467||166276||2457||32\n|}\n\n== Records ==\n[[File:Pyraminx, Estonian Open 2011.jpg|thumb|Solving a Pyraminx in competition.

They can be split up into two groups.\n\n1) V first- In these methods, two or three edges, and not a side, are solved first, and a set of algorithms, also called LL algs (last layer algs), is given to solve the remaining puzzle.\n\n2) Top first methods- In these methods, three edges around a corner are solved first, and the remaining puzzle is solved using a set of algorithms.\n\nCommon V first methods-\n\na) Layer by Layer - In this method, a face with all edges oriented in the right spot (a.k.a. a layer) is solved, and then the remaining puzzle is solved by a single algorithm from a set of 5.\n\nb) L4E- L4E or last 4 edges is very similar to Layer by Layer. The only difference is that TWO edges are solved around three centers, and the rest is done by a set of algorithms.\n\nc) Intuitive L4E- A method similar to the L4E, as the name suggests, in which a lot of visualization is required. The set of algorithms mentioned in the previous method is not memorized. In speedsolving, cases are solved intuitively by anticipating the movement of pieces. This is the most advanced V first method.\n\nCommon top first methods-\n\na) One Flip- This method uses two edges around one center solved and the third edge flipped. There are a total of six cases after this step, for which algorithms are memorized and executed. The third step involves using a common set of algorithms for ALL top first methods, also called Keyhole last layer, which involves 5 algorithms, four of them being the mirrors of each other.\n\nb) Keyhole- This method uses two edges in the right place around one center, and the third edge does not match any color of the edge i.e. it is not in the right place OR flipped. The centers of the fourth color are then solved using the non-oriented edge (a.k.a. keyhole). The last step is solved using Keyhole last layer algorithms.\n\nc) OKA- In this method, one edge is oriented around two edges in the wrong place, but one of the edges that is in the wrong place belongs to the block itself. The last edge is found on the bottom layer, and a very simple algorithm is executed to get it in the right place, followed by keyhole last layer algorithms.\n\nSome other common top first methods are WO and Nutella.\n\nMany Pyraminx speedsolvers learn several methods, and while observing a case, decide which method best suits that case.<ref name=\"results\">[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2010BRAD01?tab=results-by-event&event=pyram - Drew Brads results.]</ref>\n\n==Variations==\n[[File:Tetraminx.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A solved Tetraminx.]]\nThere are several variations of the puzzle. The simplest, '''Tetraminx''', is equivalent to the (3x) Pyraminx but without the tips (see photo).  There also exist \"higher-order\" versions, such as the 4x Master Pyraminx (see photos) and the 5x Professor's Pyraminx.\n\n[[File:MasterPyraminx-Scrambled.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A basic pattern on a Master Pyraminx]]\n[[File:MasterPyraminx-Solved.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A solved Master Pyraminx]]\nThe '''Master Pyraminx''' has 4 layers and 16 triangles-per-face (compared to 3 layers and 9 triangles-per-face of the original), and is based on the [[Skewb Diamond]] mechanism.

He and his friend Paarthasarathy aka Paartha leave for [[Pondicherry]] to attend the wedding via car. ''En route'', Saravanan recollects his past: He was a ruthless youth working in a film theatre with Paartha. He lives with his parents; his father, Varadharajan, who is educated and works as a college professor and his mother, Shenbagam, who is uneducated and is trying to pass an exam, just to get her college degree. One day in traffic, he sees Meera, a girl training to be an air hostess and [[Love at first sight|falls for her on site]]. He follows her to a cloth shop and also to her Air Hostess class. He saw her house and he and Partha go to her house, as Meera calls them. There, Meera threatens Saravanan by showing her father's photo, who is a Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Mahendra Kumar. But still, Saravanan follows her and asks her to love him. Meera takes him to Mahendra Kumar's office and he asks Saravanan to stop following Meera. Meera tells Saravanan that she has some qualifications required by her lover like shaving regularly, dressing well, breaking his friendship with Paartha, coming on time, etc.  Saravanan tells this to Partha and Partha asks him if he or Meera is best for him. Saravanan tells him Meera is more important to him than Paartha, causing a break between Saravanan's and Paartha's friendship.\n\nLater, Saravanan joins Paartha's broken love and asks him to rejoin his love. Partha agrees and then they go to [[Mumbai]], following Meera in a flight. There, Meera alas tells him that she loves Saravanan. After some months, Meera calls Saravanan once, but he does not pick up the phone and tells Paartha that Meera is not his real love and it is all nothing, but a drama. But, he really said that for fun. But, Paartha had accidentally switched on the phone while Saravanan told him all this. Meera, mistaking him for intentionally misusing her, comes there and breaks their love. Now, at Pondicherry, during Meera's marriage, both Saravanan and Partha end up drunk and tell a small story, in a comical way describing the broken love of Saravanan and Meera. Just as the marriage is going to happen, Rajini Murugan, a local don, comes there with a pregnant girl and his girlfriend and reveals that Meera's groom has a girlfriend, who is pregnant by him and that the girl Rajini Murugan is with, is that girl. The groom admits to his mistake and reunites with his old girlfriend. Saravanan and Paartha walk off the marriage hall, just then Meera comes and hugs Saravanan, hence reuniting with him.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Udhayanidhi Stalin]] as Saravanan\n* [[Hansika Motwani]] as Meera\n* [[Santhanam (actor)|Santhanam]] as Paartha\n* [[Narayan Lucky]] as Sanjay, Meera's Fianc\u00e9\n* [[Saranya Ponvannan]] as Shenbagam\n* [[Azhagam Perumal]] as Varadharajan\n* [[Sayaji Shinde]] as DC Mahendrakumar\n* [[Uma Padmanabhan]] as Gayathri\n* [[Jangiri Madhumitha]] as Jangiri\n* [[Swaminathan]] as Ulundurpettai Ulaganantha\n* [[Mahanadi Shankar]] as Traffic Police\n*[[Arya (actor)|Arya]] as Rajini Murugan (special appearance)\n* [[Andrea Jeremiah]] as Rajini Murugan's girlfriend [special appearce]\n* [[Sneha (actress)|Sneha]] as Jennifer (special appearance)\n* [[Dinesh Kumar (choreographer)|Dinesh Kumar]] (special appearance in the song \"Kadhal Oru\")<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAfHFFi0O6E |title=Oru Kal Oru Kannadi&nbsp;\u2014 Kaadhal Oru Video Udhayanidhi, Hansika |publisher=Youtube |date=16 December 2014 |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref>\n{{colend}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nUdhayanidhi Stalin had bought the distribution rights of Rajesh's previous film ''[[Boss Engira Bhaskaran]]''.<ref>[http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/58980.html Red Giant acquires Boss Engira Bhaskaran&nbsp;\u2013 Tamil Movie News].

He and his friend Paarthasarathy aka Paartha leave for [[Pondicherry]] to attend the wedding via car. ''En route'', Saravanan recollects his past: He was a ruthless youth working in a film theatre with Paartha. He lives with his parents; his father, Varadharajan, who is educated and works as a college professor and his mother, Shenbagam, who is uneducated and is trying to pass an exam, just to get her college degree. One day in traffic, he sees Meera, a girl training to be an air hostess and [[Love at first sight|falls for her on site]]. He follows her to a cloth shop and also to her Air Hostess class. He saw her house and he and Partha go to her house, as Meera calls them. There, Meera threatens Saravanan by showing her father's photo, who is a Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Mahendra Kumar. But still, Saravanan follows her and asks her to love him. Meera takes him to Mahendra Kumar's office and he asks Saravanan to stop following Meera. Meera tells Saravanan that she has some qualifications required by her lover like shaving regularly, dressing well, breaking his friendship with Paartha, coming on time, etc.  Saravanan tells this to Partha and Partha asks him if he or Meera is best for him. Saravanan tells him Meera is more important to him than Paartha, causing a break between Saravanan's and Paartha's friendship.\n\nLater, Saravanan joins Paartha's broken love and asks him to rejoin his love. Partha agrees and then they go to [[Mumbai]], following Meera in a flight. There, Meera alas tells him that she loves Saravanan. After some months, Meera calls Saravanan once, but he does not pick up the phone and tells Paartha that Meera is not his real love and it is all nothing, but a drama. But, he really said that for fun. But, Paartha had accidentally switched on the phone while Saravanan told him all this. Meera, mistaking him for intentionally misusing her, comes there and breaks their love. Now, at Pondicherry, during Meera's marriage, both Saravanan and Partha end up drunk and tell a small story, in a comical way describing the broken love of Saravanan and Meera. Just as the marriage is going to happen, Rajini Murugan, a local don, comes there with a pregnant girl and his girlfriend and reveals that Meera's groom has a girlfriend, who is pregnant by him and that the girl Rajini Murugan is with, is that girl. The groom admits to his mistake and reunites with his old girlfriend. Saravanan and Paartha walk off the marriage hall, just then Meera comes and hugs Saravanan, hence reuniting with him.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Udhayanidhi Stalin]] as Saravanan\n* [[Hansika Motwani]] as Meera\n* [[Santhanam (actor)|Santhanam]] as Paartha\n* [[Narayan Lucky]] as Sanjay, Meera's Fianc\u00e9\n* [[Saranya Ponvannan]] as Shenbagam\n* [[Azhagam Perumal]] as Varadharajan\n* [[Sayaji Shinde]] as DC Mahendrakumar\n* [[Uma Padmanabhan]] as Gayathri\n* [[Jangiri Madhumitha]] as Jangiri\n* [[Swaminathan]] as Ulundurpettai Ulaganantha\n* [[Mahanadi Shankar]] as Traffic Police\n*[[Arya (actor)|Arya]] as Rajini Murugan (special appearance)\n* [[Andrea Jeremiah]] as Rajini Murugan's girlfriend [special appearce]\n* [[Sneha (actress)|Sneha]] as Jennifer (special appearance)\n* [[Dinesh Kumar (choreographer)|Dinesh Kumar]] (special appearance in the song \"Kadhal Oru\")<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAfHFFi0O6E |title=Oru Kal Oru Kannadi&nbsp;\u2014 Kaadhal Oru Video Udhayanidhi, Hansika |publisher=Youtube |date=16 December 2014 |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref>\n{{colend}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nUdhayanidhi Stalin had bought the distribution rights of Rajesh's previous film ''[[Boss Engira Bhaskaran]]''.<ref>[http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/58980.html Red Giant acquires Boss Engira Bhaskaran&nbsp;\u2013 Tamil Movie News].

They won several talent shows during his high school years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.urbanjazz.org/Hutson_interview.htm|title=Leroy Hutson Interview|website=www.urbanjazz.org|access-date=2018-03-03}}</ref> The other members of the Nu-Tones were Ronald King, Bernard Ransom, Ed Davis, and Irving Jenkins.\n\nIn 1968, as part of the duo Sugar & Spice, Lee Hutson and Deborah Rollins recorded for [[Kapp Records]]. They recorded several singles with some success. Their single \"In Love Forever\" ranked the \"Best New Record Of The Week\" in the local newspaper column \"Soul Sauce\". Two other singles recorded were \"Ah Ha Yeah\" and \"Dreams\".\n\n=== College years ===\nInitially attending [[Howard University]] in Washington D.C. to study dentistry, Hutson was room-mates with [[Donny Hathaway]] who left college early in order to be Curtis Mayfield's musical director, Hutson then chose to switch his college major to music theory and composition. It is through Hathaway that Hutson then came to replace Curtis in The Impressions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.urbanjazz.org/Hutson_interview.htm|title=Leroy Hutson Interview|website=www.urbanjazz.org|access-date=2018-03-03}}</ref>\n\nAt Howard University, Hutson joined [[The Mayfield Singers]], a group put together on Howard's campus by musician [[Curtis Mayfield]] that performed at New York's famed [[Apollo Theater]] and Philadelphia's [[Uptown Theater (Philadelphia)|Uptown Theater]]. The group released one single for Mayfield in 1967.\n\nThere, Hutson collaborated with Donny Hathaway on \"[[The Ghetto (Donny Hathaway song)|The Ghetto]]\", giving the late recording star his first hit record in early 1970.\n\n=== Years with the Impressions ===\nIn 1971, three months out of college, Hutson was asked to replace [[Curtis Mayfield]] as the lead singer of [[The Impressions]].  He stayed with them for two-and-a-half years and recorded two albums with the group, before amicably leaving to pursue his own career as a writer, [[Musical producer|producer]], [[Arrangement|arranger]], and musician.\n\nThe first Impressions single to feature Hutson as lead vocalist was entitled \"[[Love Me (The Impressions song)|Love Me]]\", released on [[Curtom Records]] in North America in June 1971.\n\nOn August 27, 2013 Hutson, filed a complaint against [[Young Jeezy]] and others alleging that Young Jeezy's song \"Time\" inappropriately incorporated the instrumental portion of [[The Impressions]] \"Getting it On,\" which was registered with the [[United States Copyright Office]] in 1973.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Heard|first=Preston H. |title=Singer-Songwriter Lee Hutson Sues Rapper Young Jeezy Over Alleged Use of \"Getting It On\" Sample|journal=The [[National Law Review]]|date=6 September 2013|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/singer-songwriter-lee-hutson-sues-rapper-young-jeezy-over-alleged-use-getting-it-sam|accessdate=18 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Solo career ===\nIn 1973 Hutson wrote, produced, arranged and recorded his first solo album, ''\"[[Love Oh Love]]\"'', featuring the single ''\"So In Love With You\".'' It was released on [[Curtom Records]].\n\nBetween the period of 1973 until 1992 Hutson recorded eight albums and charted with thirteen singles in the U.S.<ref>{{Allmusic\n| class      =artist\n| id         =mn0000819946\n| tab        =awards\n| label      =Chart history\n| first      = \n| last       = \n| accessdate =27 January 2013\n}}</ref> Because of this he has developed a [[cult following]] on the soul scene. After \"[[Love Oh Love]]\", Hutson went on to release \"[[The Man]]\", \"[[Hutson (album)|Hutson]]\", \"[[Feel The Spirit]]\", \"[[Hutson II]]\", \"[[Closer To The Source]]\" and \"[[Unforgettable (Leroy Hutson album)|Unforgettable]].\" Hutson's last 12\" the \"Share Your Love EP\" was released via the UK's [[Expansion Records]].\n\nIn 2008, Hutson returned to recording under the name Lee Hutson, issuing an album \"''Soothe You Groove You\"'' on his own Triumph label and via download.

They won several talent shows during his high school years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.urbanjazz.org/Hutson_interview.htm|title=Leroy Hutson Interview|website=www.urbanjazz.org|access-date=2018-03-03}}</ref> The other members of the Nu-Tones were Ronald King, Bernard Ransom, Ed Davis, and Irving Jenkins.\n\nIn 1968, as part of the duo Sugar & Spice, Lee Hutson and Deborah Rollins recorded for [[Kapp Records]]. They recorded several singles with some success. Their single \"In Love Forever\" ranked the \"Best New Record Of The Week\" in the local newspaper column \"Soul Sauce\". Two other singles recorded were \"Ah Ha Yeah\" and \"Dreams\".\n\n=== College years ===\nInitially attending [[Howard University]] in Washington D.C. to study dentistry, Hutson was room-mates with [[Donny Hathaway]] who left college early in order to be Curtis Mayfield's musical director, Hutson then chose to switch his college major to music theory and composition. It is through Hathaway that Hutson then came to replace Curtis in The Impressions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.urbanjazz.org/Hutson_interview.htm|title=Leroy Hutson Interview|website=www.urbanjazz.org|access-date=2018-03-03}}</ref>\n\nAt Howard University, Hutson joined [[The Mayfield Singers]], a group put together on Howard's campus by musician [[Curtis Mayfield]] that performed at New York's famed [[Apollo Theater]] and Philadelphia's [[Uptown Theater (Philadelphia)|Uptown Theater]]. The group released one single for Mayfield in 1967.\n\nThere, Hutson collaborated with Donny Hathaway on \"[[The Ghetto (Donny Hathaway song)|The Ghetto]]\", giving the late recording star his first hit record in early 1970.\n\n=== Years with the Impressions ===\nIn 1971, three months out of college, Hutson was asked to replace [[Curtis Mayfield]] as the lead singer of [[The Impressions]].  He stayed with them for two-and-a-half years and recorded two albums with the group, before amicably leaving to pursue his own career as a writer, [[Musical producer|producer]], [[Arrangement|arranger]], and musician.\n\nThe first Impressions single to feature Hutson as lead vocalist was entitled \"[[Love Me (The Impressions song)|Love Me]]\", released on [[Curtom Records]] in North America in June 1971.\n\nOn August 27, 2013 Hutson, filed a complaint against [[Young Jeezy]] and others alleging that Young Jeezy's song \"Time\" inappropriately incorporated the instrumental portion of [[The Impressions]] \"Getting it On,\" which was registered with the [[United States Copyright Office]] in 1973.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Heard|first=Preston H. |title=Singer-Songwriter Lee Hutson Sues Rapper Young Jeezy Over Alleged Use of \"Getting It On\" Sample|journal=The [[National Law Review]]|date=6 September 2013|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/singer-songwriter-lee-hutson-sues-rapper-young-jeezy-over-alleged-use-getting-it-sam|accessdate=18 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Solo career ===\nIn 1973 Hutson wrote, produced, arranged and recorded his first solo album, ''\"[[Love Oh Love]]\"'', featuring the single ''\"So In Love With You\".'' It was released on [[Curtom Records]].\n\nBetween the period of 1973 until 1992 Hutson recorded eight albums and charted with thirteen singles in the U.S.<ref>{{Allmusic\n| class      =artist\n| id         =mn0000819946\n| tab        =awards\n| label      =Chart history\n| first      = \n| last       = \n| accessdate =27 January 2013\n}}</ref> Because of this he has developed a [[cult following]] on the soul scene. After \"[[Love Oh Love]]\", Hutson went on to release \"[[The Man]]\", \"[[Hutson (album)|Hutson]]\", \"[[Feel The Spirit]]\", \"[[Hutson II]]\", \"[[Closer To The Source]]\" and \"[[Unforgettable (Leroy Hutson album)|Unforgettable]].\" Hutson's last 12\" the \"Share Your Love EP\" was released via the UK's [[Expansion Records]].\n\nIn 2008, Hutson returned to recording under the name Lee Hutson, issuing an album \"''Soothe You Groove You\"'' on his own Triumph label and via download. Two years later, in August 2010, Hutson made his comeback to European stages, performing at Suncebeat Festival in Zadar, Croatia, at Vintage at Goodwood Festival and at Indigo2 in London. He was backed by the British group The Third Degree.\n\nAs of 2017, Hutson's work is now licensed by British independent record label [[Acid Jazz Records]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acidjazz.co.uk/portfolio-item/leroyhutson/|title=Acid Jazz Records {{!}}  Leroy Hutson|last=|first=|date=|website=www.acidjazz.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-03}}</ref> who released an Anthology LP featuring his bigger hits such as ''\"I Think I'm Falling In Love\", \"Lucky Fellow\"'' and ''\"Don't It Make You Feel Good\"'' as well as previously unreleased track ''\"Positive Forces\"'' which featured an instrumental of ''\"All Because Of You\"'' on the B side.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acidjazz.co.uk/we-are-releasing-leroy-hutson-positive-forces/|title=Acid Jazz Records {{!}}   We Are Releasing Leroy Hutson \u2013 Positive Forces|website=www.acidjazz.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-03}}</ref> They then went on to release another unreleased single, ''\"Now That I Found You\"''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acidjazz.bigcartel.com/product/pre-order-leroy-hutson-now-that-i-found-you|title=Leroy Hutson - Now That I Found You|last=Records|first=Acid Jazz|website=Acid Jazz Records|access-date=2018-03-03}}</ref>''.''\n\nIn February 2018 they re-issued both [[Hutson (album)|Hutson]] and [[Hutson II]] and are currently in the process of releasing a four-part online documentary entitled ''\"Leroy Hutson: The Man!\"'',<ref>{{Citation|last=Acid Jazz Records|title=Leroy Hutson \u2013 The Man!

It took place on April 27, 2008, at the [[1st Mariner Arena]] in [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]]. Following WrestleMania, all pay-per-views became tri-branded. It was the tenth annual event under the [[WWE Backlash|Backlash]] name and starred [[List of World Wrestling Entertainment employees|wrestler]] talents from [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]], [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]], and [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]] [[WWE Brand Extension|brands]].\n\nEight [[Mock combat|professional wrestling matches]] were scheduled on the event's [[Card (sports)|card]], which featured a supercard, a scheduling of more than one [[Card (sports)#Main event|main event]]. The first was a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|Fatal 4-Way elimination]] for the [[WWE Championship]] match featuring wrestlers from the Raw brand, in which all four men fought in the ring at the same time, with competitors being eliminated by [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]] or [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submission]]. [[Triple H]] defeated WWE Champion [[Randy Orton]], [[John Cena]], and [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] to win the championship. The other main event featured wrestlers from the SmackDown brand, in which defending [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Champion]] [[The Undertaker]] defeated challenger [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Variations of singles matches|standard wrestling match]], also known as a singles match. The main event from the ECW brand was a standard match in which defending [[ECW Championship|ECW Champion]] [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] defeated challenger [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.|Chavo Guerrero]]. In addition, a featured bout was scheduled on the undercard, in which [[Shawn Michaels]] defeated [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] in a standard match.\n\nBacklash (2008) had an attendance of approximately 11,277 and received 200,000 buys, more than the [[Backlash (2007)|previous year's event]].<ref name=\"Revenue\">{{cite journal|title=World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.

The match was contested for the [[WWE Championship]], featuring the champion, [[Randy Orton]], defending against [[Triple H]], [[John Cena]], and [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] (JBL). The buildup to the match began at [[WrestleMania XXIV]], where Randy Orton defended his title against Triple H and John Cena in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Triple Threat match]], in which the three men competed against each other, and the first man to score a pinfall or submission would win. Orton won the match, retaining the title after pinning Cena.<ref name=\"WM24-1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news2008/1206933094.shtml|title=WWE WrestleMania XXIV PPV Results \u2013 3/30/08|last=Martin|first=Adam|date=2008-03-30|publisher=WrestleView|accessdate=2009-01-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090110091532/http://www.wrestleview.com/news2008/1206933094.shtml| archivedate= 10 January 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref name=\"WM24-2\">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/WrestleMania24/2008/03/31/5148416.html|title=Mayweather, Orton survive Mania; Edge, Flair don't|last=Plummer|first=Dave|publisher=Canoe: Slam Wrestling|accessdate=2009-01-11}}</ref> On the following night's episode of ''Raw'', with the WWE Championship shining on his shoulder, Randy Orton crowed about defeating both Triple H and John Cena at WrestleMania, declaring his reign as champion the \"Age of Orton\". But John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield had other ideas, telling Orton that he deserved a title match as a reward for proving that he was the toughest Superstar on Raw in his [[Hardcore wrestling|Belfast Brawl]] victory over [[Dave Finlay|Finlay]] also at WrestleMania. On the following week's episode of ''Raw'', WWE Champion Randy Orton began the night believing he would go one-on-one with JBL at Backlash, but the tide quickly turned on him. Due to Triple H's complaint about himself being [[Professional wrestling attacks#Football kick|kicked]] in the head by Orton when he was about to pin Cena to win the WWE title at Wrestlemania, [[WWE Raw|Raw]] [[Professional wrestling authority figures#General Managers|General Manager]] [[Darren Matthews|William Regal]] placed Triple H into a [[Professional wrestling match types#Handicap match|Handicap match]] against Orton & JBL, and when Triple H won, Regal made the [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Triple Threat match]] for the title. Not to be outdone, John Cena also pleaded his case to Regal, who gave him the same Handicap Match ultimatum. After Orton's intended interference failed, Cena pulled out the win, thus, the championship match at Backlash became a Fatal Four Way starring three former WWE Champions challenging Orton. On the following week's episode of ''Raw'', after his victory over William Regal, Orton felt compelled to meddle in the bout between Triple H and JBL. In an attempt at eliminating Triple H from Backlash, Orton ran in and nearly took off Triple H's head. He administered an [[Cutter (professional wrestling)#Jumping cutter|RKO]] before then teaming with JBL against him. As Orton was set to punt Triple H's noggin again, however, JBL turned on him and laid him out with a vicious [[Professional wrestling attacks#Clothesline|Clothesline From Hell]].\n\nThe main [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] heading into Backlash on the SmackDown brand was between [[The Undertaker]] and [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], over the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]]. In February, at [[No Way Out (2008)|No Way Out]], Undertaker won an [[Elimination Chamber]] match to become the number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship at [[WrestleMania XXIV]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nowayout/history/2008/matches/6323422/results/|title=World Title's telltale hour|accessdate=2008-02-17|last=Tello|first=Craig|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|date=2008-02-17}}</ref> At WrestleMania, Undertaker defeated Edge to win the World Heavyweight Championship and extend his WrestleMania undefeated streak to 16\u20130.<ref>{{cite web|first=Craig|last=Tello|date=2008-03-30|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/2008/matches/6208634/results/|title=Sweet Sixteen|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=2008-04-05}}</ref> On the April 4, 2008 episode of ''SmackDown'', [[Professional wrestling authority figures#General managers 2|SmackDown General Manager]] [[Vickie Guerrero]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booked]] a WrestleMania rematch between Undertaker and Edge for the World Heavyweight Championship at Backlash.<ref name=\"4/04 SmackDown\">{{cite web|first=Brad|last=Borchardt|date=2008-04-04|url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/72495/|title=411's WWE SmackDown Report 04.04.08|publisher=411mania.com|accessdate=2008-04-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080408064011/http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/72495/| archivedate= 8 April 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nThe secondary feud for [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]] heading into Backlash was between [[Matt Hardy]] and [[Montel Vontavious Porter|MVP]]. On the November 16th, 2007 edition of [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]] after failing to regain the [[WWE Tag Team Championship|Tag Team Championship]] from John Morrison and The Miz, MVP attacked Matt Hardy targeting and injuring his knee. The feud would start again at [[WrestleMania XXIV]] where Matt Hardy cost MVP the Money in the Bank Ladder Match by performing a Twist of Fate at the top of the ladder. Hardy would then face MVP on the April 4th, 2008 edition of SmackDown in a non-title match, which he won.

Upset over the retirement of [[Ric Flair]] at the hands of Michaels at WrestleMania XXIV, Batista interrupted Michaels' address on the April 4 episode of ''SmackDown!'' and called him a \"selfish\" person for what he did at WrestleMania. Batista blamed Michaels for not lying down for Flair and thus protecting his career instead of retiring him. Michaels defended his actions by saying Flair had called upon him to bring his best to WrestleMania, which he did. The conflict continued on an episode of [[Chris Jericho]]'s \"[[WWE Raw#Recurring segments|Highlight Reel]]\" interview segment that featured both men on the April 7 episode of ''Raw''. Following another tense verbal standoff, Batista left the ring saying he had something in store for Michaels. Moments later, Raw General Manager William Regal said he had confirmed a match with SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero between Michaels and Batista at Backlash. In addition, the following week Jericho had a confrontation with Shawn Michaels who ended up kicking Jericho in the face. Frustrated, Jericho went to Regal in an effort to possibly add himself to the match. Regal did indeed add Jericho to the match, but not as a competitor. Instead he announced Jericho as a [[Professional wrestling match types#Special referee|Special Guest Referee]] for the match.\n\n==Event==\n{| class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ '''Other on-screen personnel'''<ref name=\"Facts\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hoffco-inc.com/wwe/ppv/ppv/bkl08.html|publisher=HoffCo|title=Backlash (2008) Information|accessdate=2008-04-28| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080502180647/http://www.hoffco-inc.com/wwe/ppv/ppv/bkl08.html| archivedate= 2 May 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n|-\n!Role:\n!Name:\n|-\n|rowspan=6|English [[Sportscaster|commentators]]\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mick Foley]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Jerry Lawler]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Jim Ross]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Adamle]] {{small|(ECW)}}\n|-\n|[[Tazz]] {{small|(ECW)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Spanish commentators\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]\n|-\n|[[Hugo Savinovich]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Interviewer]]s\n|[[Eve Torres]]\n|-\n|[[Todd Grisham]]\n|-\n|rowspan=3|[[Ring announcer]]s\n|[[Lilian Garcia]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Justin Roberts]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tony Chimel]] {{small|(ECW)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=6|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|[[Mickie Henson]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|Mike Posey {{small|(ECW)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Chioda]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Jack Doan]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Jim Korderas]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (wrestling referee)|Charles Robinson]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|}\n\nBefore the event began and aired [[Live television|live]] on [[pay-per-view]], a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Dark match|dark match]] was featured in which [[WWE Tag Team Championship (2002\u20132010)|WWE Tag Team Champions]] [[John Morrison and The Miz]] defeated [[James Yun|Jimmy Wang Yang]] and [[Shannon Moore]].<ref name=\"Facts\"/>\n\n===Preliminary matches===\nFollowing the dark match, the pay-per-view event began with a standard match for the [[WWE United States Championship]], in which the champion, [[Montel Vontavious Porter]] (MVP) defended his title against [[Matt Hardy]].

The men performed a number of offensive moves on one another throughout the match, including Shawn Michaels performing a [[Professional wrestling holds#Crossface|crossface]] on Batista. The match also briefly went to the ringside area, where the ringpost was used as a weapon by Michaels. The end of the match came when Batista lifted Michaels for a [[powerbomb]], the Batista Bomb. Michaels, however, escaped from the hold in the air, and when he fell, suffered a [[kayfabe|storyline]] knee injury, which caused Jericho to check on Michaels and stop Batista from acting. Michaels eventually got to his feet, and used [[superkick|Sweet Chin Music]] on Batista. Michaels then covered Batista for a successful pinfall, winning the match.

Edge countered the move, however, into a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Sunset flip|sunset flip]].

The match began with Orton attempting to attack JBL, but JBL countered and threw Orton out of the ring.  JBL then attacked Cena, before being attacked by Triple H.  Cena then attempted to [[Professional wrestling throws#Irish whip|swing Triple H by the arm]] into the corner, but Triple H reversed the move and sent Cena outside of the ring. Triple H and JBL then fought in the ring, while Cena and Orton fought outside.

Triple H later went outside of the ring and fought with JBL, while Cena returned to the ring and fought with Orton.

The men fought outside the ring again, and when they returned, they fought for several more minutes until Orton performed a [[Cutter (professional wrestling)#Jumping cutter|jumping cutter]], or RKO, on Triple H. Orton would then try to pin Triple H, only to get a two count. Orton then attempted to kick Triple H in the head, but Triple H dodged the maneuver and both men would counter their finishers until Triple H performed a [[Facebuster#Double underhook facebuster|Pedigree]] on Orton followed by a successful pin-fall, thus earning him his twelfth world championship.<ref name=\"Slam\"/><ref name=\"PWTorch\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe feud between [[Triple H]] and [[Randy Orton]] continued.

The alliance between Phoenix and Melina ended a week later, and the two Divas would face James at Judgment Day for the title.\n\n==Reception==\nThe event had a final attendance of 11,277.

pay-per-view events|event]] produced by [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE). It took place on April 27, 2008, at the [[1st Mariner Arena]] in [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]]. Following WrestleMania, all pay-per-views became tri-branded. It was the tenth annual event under the [[WWE Backlash|Backlash]] name and starred [[List of World Wrestling Entertainment employees|wrestler]] talents from [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]], [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]], and [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]] [[WWE Brand Extension|brands]].\n\nEight [[Mock combat|professional wrestling matches]] were scheduled on the event's [[Card (sports)|card]], which featured a supercard, a scheduling of more than one [[Card (sports)#Main event|main event]]. The first was a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|Fatal 4-Way elimination]] for the [[WWE Championship]] match featuring wrestlers from the Raw brand, in which all four men fought in the ring at the same time, with competitors being eliminated by [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]] or [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submission]]. [[Triple H]] defeated WWE Champion [[Randy Orton]], [[John Cena]], and [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] to win the championship. The other main event featured wrestlers from the SmackDown brand, in which defending [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Champion]] [[The Undertaker]] defeated challenger [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Variations of singles matches|standard wrestling match]], also known as a singles match. The main event from the ECW brand was a standard match in which defending [[ECW Championship|ECW Champion]] [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] defeated challenger [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.|Chavo Guerrero]]. In addition, a featured bout was scheduled on the undercard, in which [[Shawn Michaels]] defeated [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] in a standard match.\n\nBacklash (2008) had an attendance of approximately 11,277 and received 200,000 buys, more than the [[Backlash (2007)|previous year's event]].<ref name=\"Revenue\">{{cite journal|title=World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.

The match was contested for the [[WWE Championship]], featuring the champion, [[Randy Orton]], defending against [[Triple H]], [[John Cena]], and [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] (JBL). The buildup to the match began at [[WrestleMania XXIV]], where Randy Orton defended his title against Triple H and John Cena in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Triple Threat match]], in which the three men competed against each other, and the first man to score a pinfall or submission would win. Orton won the match, retaining the title after pinning Cena.<ref name=\"WM24-1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news2008/1206933094.shtml|title=WWE WrestleMania XXIV PPV Results \u2013 3/30/08|last=Martin|first=Adam|date=2008-03-30|publisher=WrestleView|accessdate=2009-01-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090110091532/http://www.wrestleview.com/news2008/1206933094.shtml| archivedate= 10 January 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref name=\"WM24-2\">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/WrestleMania24/2008/03/31/5148416.html|title=Mayweather, Orton survive Mania; Edge, Flair don't|last=Plummer|first=Dave|publisher=Canoe: Slam Wrestling|accessdate=2009-01-11}}</ref> On the following night's episode of ''Raw'', with the WWE Championship shining on his shoulder, Randy Orton crowed about defeating both Triple H and John Cena at WrestleMania, declaring his reign as champion the \"Age of Orton\". But John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield had other ideas, telling Orton that he deserved a title match as a reward for proving that he was the toughest Superstar on Raw in his [[Hardcore wrestling|Belfast Brawl]] victory over [[Dave Finlay|Finlay]] also at WrestleMania. On the following week's episode of ''Raw'', WWE Champion Randy Orton began the night believing he would go one-on-one with JBL at Backlash, but the tide quickly turned on him. Due to Triple H's complaint about himself being [[Professional wrestling attacks#Football kick|kicked]] in the head by Orton when he was about to pin Cena to win the WWE title at Wrestlemania, [[WWE Raw|Raw]] [[Professional wrestling authority figures#General Managers|General Manager]] [[Darren Matthews|William Regal]] placed Triple H into a [[Professional wrestling match types#Handicap match|Handicap match]] against Orton & JBL, and when Triple H won, Regal made the [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Triple Threat match]] for the title. Not to be outdone, John Cena also pleaded his case to Regal, who gave him the same Handicap Match ultimatum. After Orton's intended interference failed, Cena pulled out the win, thus, the championship match at Backlash became a Fatal Four Way starring three former WWE Champions challenging Orton. On the following week's episode of ''Raw'', after his victory over William Regal, Orton felt compelled to meddle in the bout between Triple H and JBL. In an attempt at eliminating Triple H from Backlash, Orton ran in and nearly took off Triple H's head. He administered an [[Cutter (professional wrestling)#Jumping cutter|RKO]] before then teaming with JBL against him. As Orton was set to punt Triple H's noggin again, however, JBL turned on him and laid him out with a vicious [[Professional wrestling attacks#Clothesline|Clothesline From Hell]].\n\nThe main [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] heading into Backlash on the SmackDown brand was between [[The Undertaker]] and [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], over the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]].

The feud would start again at [[WrestleMania XXIV]] where Matt Hardy cost MVP the Money in the Bank Ladder Match by performing a Twist of Fate at the top of the ladder.

Upset over the retirement of [[Ric Flair]] at the hands of Michaels at WrestleMania XXIV, Batista interrupted Michaels' address on the April 4 episode of ''SmackDown!'' and called him a \"selfish\" person for what he did at WrestleMania. Batista blamed Michaels for not lying down for Flair and thus protecting his career instead of retiring him. Michaels defended his actions by saying Flair had called upon him to bring his best to WrestleMania, which he did. The conflict continued on an episode of [[Chris Jericho]]'s \"[[WWE Raw#Recurring segments|Highlight Reel]]\" interview segment that featured both men on the April 7 episode of ''Raw''. Following another tense verbal standoff, Batista left the ring saying he had something in store for Michaels. Moments later, Raw General Manager William Regal said he had confirmed a match with SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero between Michaels and Batista at Backlash. In addition, the following week Jericho had a confrontation with Shawn Michaels who ended up kicking Jericho in the face. Frustrated, Jericho went to Regal in an effort to possibly add himself to the match. Regal did indeed add Jericho to the match, but not as a competitor. Instead he announced Jericho as a [[Professional wrestling match types#Special referee|Special Guest Referee]] for the match.\n\n==Event==\n{| class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ '''Other on-screen personnel'''<ref name=\"Facts\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hoffco-inc.com/wwe/ppv/ppv/bkl08.html|publisher=HoffCo|title=Backlash (2008) Information|accessdate=2008-04-28| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080502180647/http://www.hoffco-inc.com/wwe/ppv/ppv/bkl08.html| archivedate= 2 May 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n|-\n!Role:\n!Name:\n|-\n|rowspan=6|English [[Sportscaster|commentators]]\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mick Foley]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Jerry Lawler]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Jim Ross]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Adamle]] {{small|(ECW)}}\n|-\n|[[Tazz]] {{small|(ECW)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Spanish commentators\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]\n|-\n|[[Hugo Savinovich]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Interviewer]]s\n|[[Eve Torres]]\n|-\n|[[Todd Grisham]]\n|-\n|rowspan=3|[[Ring announcer]]s\n|[[Lilian Garcia]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Justin Roberts]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tony Chimel]] {{small|(ECW)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=6|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|[[Mickie Henson]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|Mike Posey {{small|(ECW)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Chioda]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Jack Doan]] {{small|(Raw)}}\n|-\n|[[Jim Korderas]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (wrestling referee)|Charles Robinson]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|}\n\nBefore the event began and aired [[Live television|live]] on [[pay-per-view]], a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Dark match|dark match]] was featured in which [[WWE Tag Team Championship (2002\u20132010)|WWE Tag Team Champions]] [[John Morrison and The Miz]] defeated [[James Yun|Jimmy Wang Yang]] and [[Shannon Moore]].<ref name=\"Facts\"/>\n\n===Preliminary matches===\nFollowing the dark match, the pay-per-view event began with a standard match for the [[WWE United States Championship]], in which the champion, [[Montel Vontavious Porter]] (MVP) defended his title against [[Matt Hardy]].

The men performed a number of offensive moves on one another throughout the match, including Shawn Michaels performing a [[Professional wrestling holds#Crossface|crossface]] on Batista. The match also briefly went to the ringside area, where the ringpost was used as a weapon by Michaels. The end of the match came when Batista lifted Michaels for a [[powerbomb]], the Batista Bomb. Michaels, however, escaped from the hold in the air, and when he fell, suffered a [[kayfabe|storyline]] knee injury, which caused Jericho to check on Michaels and stop Batista from acting. Michaels eventually got to his feet, and used [[superkick|Sweet Chin Music]] on Batista. Michaels then covered Batista for a successful pinfall, winning the match. Afterward, Michaels returned to the backstage area [[Sell (professional wrestling)|while limping heavily]].<ref name=\"WrestleView\"/><ref name=\"PWTorch\"/>\n\n[[File:HBK-crossface-Batista.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shawn Michaels]] with a [[Professional wrestling holds#Crossface|Crossface]] applied to [[Dave Batista|Batista]]]]\nThe next contest was a twelve-[[WWE Diva|Diva]] [[Professional wrestling tag team match types|tag team match]] featuring the team of [[Beth Phoenix]], [[Melina Perez|Melina]], [[Natalya (wrestler)|Natayla]], [[Lisa Marie Varon|Victoria]], [[Layla El|Layla]], and [[Jillian Hall]] against the team of [[Mickie James]], [[Ashley Massaro|Ashley]], [[Maria Kanellis|Maria]], [[Michelle McCool]], [[Kelly Kelly]], and [[Cherry (wrestler)|Cherry]]. The match began with Michelle McCool against Beth Phoenix, and over the course of the match, all of the women participated in the contest. The end of the match came when Beth Phoenix performed a [[Suplex#Fisherman suplex|fisherman suplex]] on Ashley, and then covered her for a successful pin, giving her team the victory.<ref name=\"Slam\"/><ref name=\"PWTorch\"/>\n\n===Main event matches===\n[[File:Undertaker-Gogoplata-Edge.jpg|thumb|left|Undertaker applying ''[[Gogoplata|Hell's Gate]]'' on [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], which ended the match.]]\nThe sixth match of the event was a standard match for the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]], in which the champion, [[The Undertaker]], defended his title against [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]]. The match was contested back and forth between the two men, with the early portions of the match featuring The Undertaker controlling much of the action. Edge eventually took an advantage when he exposed the turnbuckle in the corner, and The Undertaker ran head first into it. [[Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder|Curt Hawkins]] then struck The Undertaker with the World Heavyweight Championship belt, which was followed by an unsuccessful cover by Edge.  Edge then attempted to hit Undertaker with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|spear]], but The Undertaker countered the maneuver hitting Edge with a  [[DDT (professional wrestling)|DDT]]. [[Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder|Zack Ryder]] then attempted to interfere on behalf of Edge, but The Undertaker threw Edge into Ryder and then caught Edge in an attempted [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)#Tombstone piledriver|Tombstone Piledriver]], in which The Undertaker would have held Edge upside down and knelt, driving Edge's head into the mat. Edge countered the move, however, into a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Sunset flip|sunset flip]]. While Edge was pinning The Undertaker, however, The Undertaker performed a [[gogoplata]] submission hold, which caused Edge to [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submit]], giving The Undertaker the victory. The Undertaker continued to apply the hold after the match ended, injuring (in storyline) Edge. Edge was removed from the ring on a stretcher by medics, making his injury appear realistic.<ref name=\"WrestleView\"/><ref name=\"PWTorch\"/>\n\n[[File:RandyOrtonAfterLoss.jpg|thumb|right|[[Randy Orton]] who lost the [[WWE Championship]] to [[Triple H]]]]\nThe main event was a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|four-way elimination]] match for the [[WWE Championship]], in which the champion, [[Randy Orton]], defended his title against [[Triple H]], [[John Cena]], and [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] (JBL). The match began with Orton attempting to attack JBL, but JBL countered and threw Orton out of the ring.  JBL then attacked Cena, before being attacked by Triple H.  Cena then attempted to [[Professional wrestling throws#Irish whip|swing Triple H by the arm]] into the corner, but Triple H reversed the move and sent Cena outside of the ring. Triple H and JBL then fought in the ring, while Cena and Orton fought outside. Cena was later sent off the ring apron into the ''Raw'' announcer's table, and Orton and JBL teamed up to attack Triple H in the ring. Triple H eventually hit both of them with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Clothesline|clothesline]], and JBL went to the outside of the ring while Triple H and Orton fought inside. Triple H later went outside of the ring and fought with JBL, while Cena returned to the ring and fought with Orton. After the men fought each other for several minutes, Cena put JBL in the [[Professional wrestling holds#Sleeper hold|STFU]]. This caused JBL to submit, eliminating him from the match. Immediately following JBL's submission, Orton [[Professional wrestling attacks#Punt|kicked Cena in the head]], which he followed with a cover for a pinfall, eliminating Cena from the match. Triple H and Orton then began to fight on the outside of the ring, with Orton taking control and sending Triple H back into the ring, where he dominated Triple H with a series of maneuvers for several minutes before Triple H struck Orton with his knee. The men fought outside the ring again, and when they returned, they fought for several more minutes until Orton performed a [[Cutter (professional wrestling)#Jumping cutter|jumping cutter]], or RKO, on Triple H. Orton would then try to pin Triple H, only to get a two count. Orton then attempted to kick Triple H in the head, but Triple H dodged the maneuver and both men would counter their finishers until Triple H performed a [[Facebuster#Double underhook facebuster|Pedigree]] on Orton followed by a successful pin-fall, thus earning him his twelfth world championship.<ref name=\"Slam\"/><ref name=\"PWTorch\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe feud between [[Triple H]] and [[Randy Orton]] continued.

The next week on ''SmackDown'', Guerrero booked a \"Championship Chase\" where the winner would face the Undertaker for the vacant World Championship at Judgment Day. Batista originally won, but his victory was cut short after Guerrero came out and announced that Edge had been medically cleared and would be able to compete. Thus, the match continued, and Edge defeated Batista, gaining the championship match at Judgment Day.\n\nThe following night on ''Raw'', Mickie James' team defeated Beth Phoenix's team in a 12-Diva rematch from Backlash. The following week, James retained the Women's Championship against Phoenix in a lumberjill match, with the win coming after the evil Melina attempted to strike James with her boot, but accidentally struck Phoenix.

After graduating from [[Antelope Valley High School]] at age 17, she relocated to [[San Diego]], working as a waitress and a dancer.<ref name=People/>\n\n==Career==\n===Early career===\nBarnes' first break came when [[Bob Hope]] saw her in a local fashion show and invited her to join his troupe for a 1973 performance at [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] She subsequently moved to [[Los Angeles]] to attempt a career in show business in earnest.<ref name=People/> She appeared as an [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazon]] in ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|The New Original Wonder Woman]]'' alongside [[Lynda Carter]] as the title character. Her second break came at 19 when she met [[Peter Falk]] at Pips. Six months later he gave her a one-line part in an episode of ''[[Columbo]]'', which led to a series of bit parts in films like ''[[The Seniors]]'' (1978) and ''Delta Fox'' (1979).\n\nWhile working as a hostess at a Hollywood nightclub, Barnes posed nude for the \"Pet of the Month\" photo layout in the March 1976 issue of ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' magazine under the pseudonym '''Joann Witty'''. ''Penthouse'' later wanted to republish the photos under Barnes' real name in 1982 after she had become famous in ''Three's Company''. The dispute ended up in court, as Penthouse wanted a judge to rule on the legality of publishing the pictures using her real name. At issue was a handwritten addendum to the standard model release contract that all models sign. When Penthouse lost the initial case, they appealed to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeal court mostly sided with Barnes and ruled that the handwritten addendum was legally binding and that Penthouse could not republish the photos using her real name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://openjurist.org/792/f2d/943/penthouse-international-ltd-v-barnes|title=Penthouse International, Ltd, a New York Corporation,plaintiff/appellant, v.
