The city was known in ancient times as [[Ambracia]] ({{lang-grc|\u1f08\u03bc\u03b2\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03af\u03b1}}). Arta is known for the [[Bridge of Arta|medieval bridge]] over the [[Arachthos River]]. Arta is also known for its ancient sites from the era of [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]] and its well-preserved 13th-century castle. Arta's [[Byzantine]] history is reflected in its many [[Byzantine]] churches; perhaps the best known is the [[Panagia Paregoretissa]] (Mother of God the Consoling), built about 1290 by [[despot (court title)|Despot]] [[Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas]]. The city is the seat of the [[Technological Educational Institute of Epirus]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Antiquity===\n{{main|Ambracia}}\nThe first settlement in the area of the modern city dates to the 9th century B.C. Ambracia was founded as a [[Corinth]]ian [[colonies in antiquity|colony]] in the 7th century B.C. In 294 BC, after forty-three years of semi-autonomy under [[Macedon]]ian suzerainty, Ambracia was given to [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], king of the [[Molossians]] and of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]], who made it his capital, using Ambracia as a base to attack the [[Roman Republic|Romans]]. Pyrrhus managed to achieve great but costly victories against the Romans, hence the phrase \"[[Pyrrhic victory]]\" which refers in particular to an exchange at the [[Battle of Asculum]]. Nevertheless, Pyrrhus found the time and means to adorn his capital with a palace, temples and theatres. In 146 BC, Ambracia became part of the [[Roman Republic]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{{further|Byzantine Greece}}\n\nDespite the existence several churches from the 9th and 10th centuries, Arta is first attested only in 1082, when the [[Normans]] under [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond]] laid siege to the city.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|page=113}} The origin and etymology of the name is uncertain and debated.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|page=114}} In the [[Komnenian period]], the city flourished as a commercial centre, with links to [[Venice]], and rose to become a [[bishopric]] by&nbsp;1157.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|page=113}}<ref name=\"ODB\">{{ODB | last = Gregory | first = Timothy E. | last2 = \u0160ev\u010denko | first2 = Nancy Patterson | title = Arta | pages = 191\u2013192 }}</ref> The Jewish traveller [[Benjamin of Tudela]] visited the area in 1165.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|page=113}}\n\n[[File:Church of St. Theodora (Arta) 3.jpg|thumb|left|Byzantine church of St [[Theodora of Arta]] (11th century)]]\n[[File:Byzantium1204.png|thumb|The [[Despotate of Epirus]] (green) in 1204]]\n\nBy the end of the 12th century, Arta probably formed a distinct fiscal district (''[[episkepsis]]'') within the wider [[theme (Byzantine district)|theme]] of [[Nicopolis (theme)|Nicopolis]].<ref name=\"ODB\"/> After the [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|fall]] of [[Constantinople]] to the [[Fourth Crusade]], it is recorded as the ''pertinentia de Arta'' in the ''[[Partitio Romaniae]]'' treaty of 1204, and assigned to Venice.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|page=113}}\n\n[[File:\u0397 \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b7\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03ae\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1.jpg|thumb|right|The 13th-century [[Church of the Parigoritissa]], formerly site of the [[Archaeological Collection of Arta]].]]\n[[File:Byzantine church of st Vasileios in Arta, Greece.jpg|thumb|Saint Basilios of the Agor\u00e1 (14-15th century)]]\n\nThe Venetians did not take control, however, for in 1205 [[Michael I Komnenos Doukas]] came to the city, succeeded its previous Byzantine governor, and quickly established a new principality, which is known by historians as the [[Despotate of Epirus]].{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|page=113}} Arta remained the capital of the new principality for most of its history,{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|page=113}} and flourished as a result. The city experienced considerable building activity, with the renovation of older churches and the construction of new ones, most notably the [[Church of the Parigoritissa]] and the [[Church of the Kato Panagia]].<ref name=\"ODB\"/> Sometime after 1227 it received fortifications,<ref name=\"ODB\"/> and was the site of regional Church councils in 1213, 1219, and 1225.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|page=113}} The 15th-century ''[[Chronicle of the Tocco]]'' describes it as \"the center of a fertile agricultural region with many water buffaloes, cows, and horses\". The city had trade links to Venice\u2014a Venetian consul is attested in 1284 and 1314/19{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|page=113}}\u2014and Ragusa, exporting dried meat, lard, ham, furs, and [[indigo]]. Archaeological finds also attest to a local ceramic industry.<ref name=\"ODB\"/>\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Pelagonia]] in 1259, the city was occupied by the troops of the rival [[Byzantine Greeks|Greek]] successor state, the [[Empire of Nicaea]], (which restored the Byzantine Empire in 1261) but was soon recovered for Epirus by [[John I Doukas]].{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|page=113}} Another attack by the Byzantine emperor [[Andronikos II Palaiologos]] in 1292, by land and sea, was unsuccessful.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|page=113}} In 1303, the city was besieged for a month by the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevins]] under [[Charles II of Naples]].{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|page=113}} In 1313, much of the city was destroyed in a great fire.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|page=113}} In the next year, Byzantine troops under the ''[[pinkernes]]'' John attacked Epirus, including Arta.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|page=113}}\n\nIn 1318, the last male-line descendant of Michael I, [[Thomas I Komnenos Doukas]], was assassinated by his nephew, the [[Count of Cephalonia]] [[Nicholas Orsini]], and Epirus passed to the Italian [[Orsini]] family. Nicholas was in turn murdered in 1323 by his brother [[John II Orsini]]. In 1331 Arta, as well as [[Leucas]] and other areas, were occupied by [[Walter VI of Brienne]], and John Orsini was forced to accept Angevin suzerainty.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|page=113}} John's death in 1335 left Epirus in the weak hands of the young [[Nikephoros II Orsini]] and his mother [[Anna Palaiologina (daughter of Andronikos Angelos Palaiologos)|Anna Palaiologina]], and the Byzantine emperor [[Andronikos III Palaiologos]] availed himself of the opportunity to occupy and annex Epirus.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=253\u2013254}}\n\nByzantine rule was unpopular,{{sfn|Nicol|2010|pp=108ff}} and in 1339 a revolt broke out, with Arta joining it, under a certain Nicholas Basilitzes. Andronikos III and his commander-in-chief, [[John Kantakouzenos]], campaigned in person in Epirus and captured the rebel fortresses one by one, either by siege or through negotiations. By the end of 1340, Byzantine rule was restored, and [[John Angelos (sebastokrator)|John Angelos]] took his seat as imperial governor in Arta.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=254\u2013255}}{{sfn|Nicol|2010|pp=114\u2013121, 124}}\n\n[[File:The Greek defensive barrack of Arta, 1881.jpg|thumb|The Greek defensive barrack, 1881]]\n[[File:Clock Tower Arta Greece 5.jpg|thumb|Old photo of Arta with the clocktower, 1910]]\n\nAided by the [[Byzantine civil war of 1341\u20131347]] and an outbreak of the [[Black Death]] that devastated the region, Arta with the rest of Epirus fell under the rule of the [[Medieval Serbia|Serbian]] king [[Stefan Dushan]] in autumn 1347. Dushan's half-brother [[Simeon Uro\u0161]], who married John II Orsini's daughter [[Thomais Orsini]], was appointed governor of Epirus.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=320}} The city remained part of the new [[Serbian Empire]] until Dushan's death in 1355. Nikephoros II Orsini recovered Epirus in 1356/7, but his death in the [[Battle of Achelous (1359)|Battle of Achelous]] against the [[Albanians|Albanian]] tribes that had invaded the region, meant that Arta returned to the (rather nominal) rule of Simeon Uro\u0161, who preferred to reside in [[Thessaly]] rather than Epirus.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|pp=70, 113\u2013114}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=347\u2013350}}{{sfn|Nicol|2010|pp=123\u2013138}} This left Epirus open to increasing Albanian migration, who soon captured most of Epirus, except for [[Ioannina]].{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=350\u2013351}} In 1367 or shortly after, Arta too was captured, and became the centre of the \"[[Despotate of Arta]]\", until 1374 under [[Peter Losha]] and then [[John Bua Spata]].{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|page=114}} The Albanian rulers managed to withstand attacks by the Angevins (sometime between 1374 and 1384), as well as by the [[Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller]] [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez de Heredia]] in 1378, but in 1384 the city was plundered by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]].{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|page=114}}\n\nFrom 1401/02, [[Carlo I Tocco]], the ambitious Count of Cephalonia, began launching attacks on Arta, taking advantage of the Albanians' infighting. Despite the Albanians' calling on Ottoman aid, in 1416 Tocco captured Arta after a long siege. Having taken control of Ioannina in 1411, Tocco thus reunited the core of the old Epirote realm, and received recognition from both the Ottomans and the Byzantine emperor.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|pp=72\u201373, 114}} After Carlo I's death in 1429, he was succeeded by his nephew [[Carlo II Tocco]].

of Arta]], which is part of [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] region. The city was known in ancient times as [[Ambracia]] ({{lang-grc|\u1f08\u03bc\u03b2\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03af\u03b1}}). Arta is known for the [[Bridge of Arta|medieval bridge]] over the [[Arachthos River]]. Arta is also known for its ancient sites from the era of [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]] and its well-preserved 13th-century castle. Arta's [[Byzantine]] history is reflected in its many [[Byzantine]] churches; perhaps the best known is the [[Panagia Paregoretissa]] (Mother of God the Consoling), built about 1290 by [[despot (court title)|Despot]] [[Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas]]. The city is the seat of the [[Technological Educational Institute of Epirus]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Antiquity===\n{{main|Ambracia}}\nThe first settlement in the area of the modern city dates to the 9th century B.C. Ambracia was founded as a [[Corinth]]ian [[colonies in antiquity|colony]] in the 7th century B.C. In 294 BC, after forty-three years of semi-autonomy under [[Macedon]]ian suzerainty, Ambracia was given to [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], king of the [[Molossians]] and of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]], who made it his capital, using Ambracia as a base to attack the [[Roman Republic|Romans]]. Pyrrhus managed to achieve great but costly victories against the Romans, hence the phrase \"[[Pyrrhic victory]]\" which refers in particular to an exchange at the [[Battle of Asculum]]. Nevertheless, Pyrrhus found the time and means to adorn his capital with a palace, temples and theatres. In 146 BC, Ambracia became part of the [[Roman Republic]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{{further|Byzantine Greece}}\n\nDespite the existence several churches from the 9th and 10th centuries, Arta is first attested only in 1082, when the [[Normans]] under [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond]] laid siege to the city.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|page=113}} The origin and etymology of the name is uncertain and debated.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|page=114}} In the [[Komnenian period]], the city flourished as a commercial centre, with links to [[Venice]], and rose to become a [[bishopric]] by&nbsp;1157.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|page=113}}<ref name=\"ODB\">{{ODB | last = Gregory | first = Timothy E. | last2 = \u0160ev\u010denko | first2 = Nancy Patterson | title = Arta | pages = 191\u2013192 }}</ref> The Jewish traveller [[Benjamin of Tudela]] visited the area in 1165.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|page=113}}\n\n[[File:Church of St. Theodora (Arta) 3.jpg|thumb|left|Byzantine church of St [[Theodora of Arta]] (11th century)]]\n[[File:Byzantium1204.png|thumb|The [[Despotate of Epirus]] (green) in 1204]]\n\nBy the end of the 12th century, Arta probably formed a distinct fiscal district (''[[episkepsis]]'') within the wider [[theme (Byzantine district)|theme]] of [[Nicopolis (theme)|Nicopolis]].<ref name=\"ODB\"/> After the [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|fall]] of [[Constantinople]] to the [[Fourth Crusade]], it is recorded as the ''pertinentia de Arta'' in the ''[[Partitio Romaniae]]'' treaty of 1204, and assigned to Venice.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|page=113}}\n\n[[File:\u0397 \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b7\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03ae\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1.jpg|thumb|right|The 13th-century [[Church of the Parigoritissa]], formerly site of the [[Archaeological Collection of Arta]].]]\n[[File:Byzantine church of st Vasileios in Arta, Greece.jpg|thumb|Saint Basilios of the Agor\u00e1 (14-15th century)]]\n\nThe Venetians did not take control, however, for in 1205 [[Michael I Komnenos Doukas]] came to the city, succeeded its previous Byzantine governor, and quickly established a new principality, which is known by historians as the [[Despotate of Epirus]].{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|page=113}} Arta remained the capital of the new principality for most of its history,{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|page=113}} and flourished as a result. The city experienced considerable building activity, with the renovation of older churches and the construction of new ones, most notably the [[Church of the Parigoritissa]] and the [[Church of the Kato Panagia]].<ref name=\"ODB\"/> Sometime after 1227 it received fortifications,<ref name=\"ODB\"/> and was the site of regional Church councils in 1213, 1219, and 1225.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|page=113}} The 15th-century ''[[Chronicle of the Tocco]]'' describes it as \"the center of a fertile agricultural region with many water buffaloes, cows, and horses\". The city had trade links to Venice\u2014a Venetian consul is attested in 1284 and 1314/19{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|page=113}}\u2014and Ragusa, exporting dried meat, lard, ham, furs, and [[indigo]].
