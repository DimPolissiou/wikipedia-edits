The DOE [https://science.osti.gov/ber Office of Biological and Environmental Research] funds and oversees its research and operations.\n\n== Research ==\n\nEMSL scientists and collaborators perform fundamental research that focuses on the biological, biogeochemical, and physical principles to predict processes occurring at the molecular and genomics-controlled smallest scales to the environmental Earth system changes at the largest scales.\n\nEMSL uses six Integrated Research Platforms to uncover critical information for understanding and predicting the molecular functions of biological and ecosystem processes.\n* Functional Omics integrates transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses to uncover biological processes in plant, fungal, and microbial systems.\nIsotope and Chemical Analysis tracks the fate of isotopes and analyzes the chemistry of biological and environmental systems.\n* Molecular Bioimaging provides images of the structure and location of proteins and other biomolecules at nanoscale spatial and temporal resolutions.\nBiogeochemical Transformation investigates how molecular interactions at the Earth\u2019s land, water, and air interfaces transform and transport nutrients and contaminants within the environment.\n* Cellular Dynamics uncovers the molecular signals within and between cells as they respond to their environment and other organisms.\n* Molecular Plant Phenotyping probes the interaction between genes and the environment to understand, predict, and control plant traits.\n\n==Operations==\nEMSL is a user research facility whereby scientists, from around the world, can submit project proposals to access the laboratory\u2019s experts and equipment at no cost. Proposals are screened through a competitive peer-review process to ensure the project is scientifically impactful and relevant to DOE\u2019s [https://science.osti.gov/ber Office of Biological and Environmental Research mission].\n\nScientists whose proposals are accepted are referred to as \u201cEMSL users.\u201d Typical user research projects can last a few months to a few years. EMSL users do not have to stay on-site for the duration of their project and can visit the laboratory when needed. Much of the sample processing and analysis can be handled remotely.\n\nEMSL's user community provides the laboratory\u2019s management team with recommendations for scientific direction and efficient operations through an elected committee of representatives.\n\n==History==\n\n=== The beginnings (1986\u20131997) ===\nThe idea that would become EMSL began in 1985 with a National Academy of Sciences report titled Opportunities in Chemistry. The report identified scientific challenges relating to energy and the environment that required fundamental research to achieve a solution. In response, then director of PNNL, William R. Wiley, and lab senior managers proposed a center for molecular science that would bring together theoreticians with experience in computing, modeling of molecular processes, and researchers from the physical and life sciences. Their recommendations would become EMSL, a center with advanced instrumentation for the study of molecular-level chemistry.\n\nWiley envisioned a facility where the research was conducted in an integrated and collaborative manner. \u201cProblems don\u2019t come in small, unique, compartmentalized packages. We must recognize the interrelationships,\u201d said Wiley.\n\nOhio-based Battelle Memorial Institute, which operates PNNL for DOE, approved $8.5 million in funding over four years to build the facility; develop research programs; and obtain the equipment, facilities, scientists, and staff to support these programs.\nPNNL began construction of the facility in July 1994 and completed the laboratory in August 1997. EMSL opened October 1, 1997, for full operation as DOE's newest national scientific user facility.\n\n=== The early years (1997\u20132001) ===\n\nDuring its first five years, EMSL operations focused on building capabilities, recruiting scientific leadership, and attracting users. The scientific focus then expanded to include biology, particularly the study of naturally occurring microbes for environmental cleanup, alternative energy, and carbon dioxide reduction in the atmosphere \u2013 critical challenges important to DOE.\n\nEMSL's early user program focused on single investigator studies \u2013 particularly those Wiley championed that crossed disciplinary boundaries \u2013 and quickly reached more than 1,000 users per year, representing every state and several foreign countries.\n\n=== A maturing program (2001\u20132009) ===\n\nDuring this period, EMSL focused on two grand challenges:\n\n* a biogeochemistry question concerning the fundamental interaction between microbes and minerals, and\n* a study addressing the structure and function of proteins in the cell membrane.\n\nWork on these challenges led to new opportunities for the scientific community \u2013 with research campaigns designed to focus teams on a single challenge. \n\nIn January 2007, EMSL celebrated its first permanent expansion: a nearly 4,000-square-foot raised floor within its high-performance computing operations center for an 11.8-teraflop supercomputer named Chinook, which was then the fifth-fastest system in the world. In April 2008, EMSL dedicated a new office pod to distinguished user J. Mike White that houses nearly 100 staff and users. In early 2012, EMSL opened its Quiet Wing housing a suite of ultrasensitive high-resolution microscopy and scanning instruments.\n\n=== Building for the future (2009 to present) ===\n\nIn October 2010, EMSL\u2019s premier computational chemistry software package, [http://www.nwchem-sw.org/index.php/Main_Page NWChem], went open source \u2013 allowing computer scientists worldwide to contribute to its future development and making it available to more researchers and students. The code has been cited over 3760 times (according to a Web of Science search in 2020) since 2010.\n\nIn June 2013, EMSL retired the Chinook supercomputer and welcomed Cascade, a 3.4-petaflops system.\n\nEMSL celebrated its twentieth anniversary in August 2017, showcasing NWChem computational chemistry software, and advances in subsurface science and foundational biofuel production. Scientific leaders participated in the event, including internationally recognized scientists Thom Dunning, Steve Colson, and Jean Futrell.\n\nToday EMSL focuses its scientific discovery research in Functional and Systems Biology and Environmental Transformations and Interactions, together with users from diverse scientific communities.

The report identified scientific challenges relating to energy and the environment that required fundamental research to achieve a solution. Then director of PNNL William R. Wiley and lab senior managers met to discuss the report and how PNNL could respond to the nation's scientific challenges that were critically dependent on fundamental advances in chemistry. Their recommendations would become EMSL, a center with advanced instrumentation for the study of molecular-level chemistry.\n\nWiley envisioned a facility where the research was conducted in an integrated and collaborative manner. \u201cProblems don\u2019t come in small, unique, compartmentalized packages. We must recognize the interrelationships,\u201d said Wiley.\n\nOhio-based [http://www.battelle.org/ Battelle] Memorial Institute, which operates PNNL for the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]], approved $8.5 million in funding over four years to establish the facility; develop research programs; and obtain the equipment, facilities, scientists and staff to support these programs.\n\nThe DOE authorized PNNL to proceed in October 1993, and PNNL began construction of the facility in July 1994. The facility was dedicated on October 16, 1996, in honor of Wiley, who died three months earlier. Construction was completed in August 1997. Then-DOE Secretary [[Hazel R. O'Leary|Hazel O'Leary]] delivered the dedication speech and Wiley's wife, Gus, cut the ribbon. EMSL opened Oct. 1, 1997, for full operation as DOE's newest national scientific user facility.\n\n'''The early years (1997\u20132001)'''\nDuring its first five years, EMSL operations focused on building capabilities, recruiting scientific leadership and attracting users. The scientific focus then expanded to include biology, particularly the study of naturally occurring microbes for environmental cleanup, alternative energy, and [[carbon dioxide]] reduction in the atmosphere \u2013 critical challenges addressed by DOE.\n\nEMSL's early user program focused on single investigator studies \u2013 particularly those Wiley championed that crossed disciplinary boundaries \u2013 and quickly reached more than 1,000 users per year, representing every state and several foreign countries.\n\n'''A maturing program (2001\u20132009)'''\nIn this period there were two grand challenges. These challenges were team-based, multi-investigator research efforts targeted on two key challenges related to DOE missions:\n* a biogeochemistry question concerning the fundamental interaction between microbes and minerals, and\n* a study addressing the structure and function of proteins in the cell membrane.\n[[File:William R. Wiley.jpg|240px|thumb|Dr. William R. Wiley (1931\u20131996) was a distinguished Battelle scientist and one of the driving forces behind the creation of EMSL.

In April 2008, EMSL dedicated a new office pod to distinguished user J. Mike White that houses nearly 100 staff and users. At the same time, EMSL management began pursuing plans for a Radiochemistry Annex and a Quiet Wing.\n\n'''Building for the future (2009 to present)'''\n\nIn 2009, DOE announced a $60 million investment in capabilities for EMSL from the [http://www.emsl.pnnl.gov/capabilities/arra/ American Recovery and Reinvestment Act], or ARRA. EMSL used the funds to upgrade some existing capabilities, as well as developing and deploying totally new systems and capabilities.\n\nAt this same time, EMSL directed capital funds toward construction of the $8 million [http://www.emsl.pnnl.gov/capabilities/facilities/quiet_wing.jsp Quiet Wing] to house up to eight microscopy instruments. The Quiet Wing opened in early 2012.

During most of the year (about 56% of the time) the airport uses Visual Configuration 1: runways 19R and 26L for arrivals and 19L and 26R for departures. Airfield capacity in Configuration 1 is constrained by bordering military airspace, high terrain to the west, and an uphill departure from 26R. Because of the heat, 26R is favored over 19L for departures. When the winds shift in the winter (about 13% of the year), the airfield adopts Visual Configuration 3, which uses 01L and 26L for arrivals and 01L and 01R for departures. Marginal flying conditions adopt the same Configuration 1/Configuration 3 split based on the prevailing winds. In instrument weather, arrivals are preferred on 26L, and departures take off from 19L and 26R.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.faa.gov/airports/planning_capacity/profiles/media/LAS-Airport-Capacity-Profile-2015.pdf |title=McCarran International (Las Vegas) Airport Capacity Profile, 2015 |date=2015 |publisher=Federal Aviation Administration |accessdate=5 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501170813/https://www.faa.gov/airports/planning_capacity/profiles/media/LAS-Airport-Capacity-Profile-2015.pdf |archive-date=1 May 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Terminals===\nThere are two terminals at McCarran and 5 concourses with a total of 92 gates.

During most of the year (about 56% of the time) the airport uses Visual Configuration 1: runways 19R and 26L for arrivals and 19L and 26R for departures. Airfield capacity in Configuration 1 is constrained by bordering military airspace, high terrain to the west, and an uphill departure from 26R. Because of the heat, 26R is favored over 19L for departures. When the winds shift in the winter (about 13% of the year), the airfield adopts Visual Configuration 3, which uses 01L and 26L for arrivals and 01L and 01R for departures. Marginal flying conditions adopt the same Configuration 1/Configuration 3 split based on the prevailing winds. In instrument weather, arrivals are preferred on 26L, and departures take off from 19L and 26R.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.faa.gov/airports/planning_capacity/profiles/media/LAS-Airport-Capacity-Profile-2015.pdf |title=McCarran International (Las Vegas) Airport Capacity Profile, 2015 |date=2015 |publisher=Federal Aviation Administration |accessdate=5 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501170813/https://www.faa.gov/airports/planning_capacity/profiles/media/LAS-Airport-Capacity-Profile-2015.pdf |archive-date=1 May 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Terminals===\nThere are two terminals at McCarran and 5 concourses with a total of 92 gates.

Early Christians regarded themselves as partaking in a new covenant with God, open to both Jews and gentiles, due to the sacrificial death and subsequent exaltation of Jesus Christ.\n\nEarly Christian notions of the person and sacrificial role of Jesus in human salvation were further elaborated by the Church Fathers, medieval writers and modern scholars in various atonement theories, such as the [[Ransom theory of atonement|ransom theory]], [[Christus Victor|Christus Victor theory]], the [[Recapitulation theory of atonement|recapitulation theory]], the [[Satisfaction theory of atonement|satisfaction theory]], the [[Penal substitution|penal substitution theory]], and the [[Moral influence theory of atonement|moral influence theory]].\n\nVariant views on [[salvation]] are among the main fault lines dividing the various [[Christian denominations]], including conflicting definitions of sin and [[Total depravity|depravity]] (the sinful nature of humankind), [[Justification (theology)|justification]] (God's means of removing the consequences of sin), and [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] (the [[Forgiveness#Christianity|forgiving]] or pardoning of sin through the suffering, death and [[resurrection of Jesus]]).\n\n==Definition and scope==\nSalvation in Christianity, or deliverance or redemption, is the \"saving [of] human beings from death and separation from God\" by [[Christ]]'s death and resurrection.<ref name=CDOS /><!-- **START OF NOTES** -->{{efn|name=\"definition\"|Definition of salvation in Christianity:[[OED|Oxford English Dictionary]], 2nd ed. 1989: \"The saving of the soul; the deliverance from sin and its consequences\"}}{{efn|\"Traditional Christianity maintains that human beings are subject to death and eternal separation from God as a result of their sinfulness, but that they can be saved from this condition somehow as a result of what we might refer to as \u201cthe work of Jesus\u201d, which work includes at least his suffering and death on the cross, and perhaps also his sinless life, resurrection, and ascension. We have used the term \u2018theories of the atonement\u2019 here because that is the term most commonly used in the philosophical literature on this topic, and it is a term often enough used in theology as well. But it is not a neutral term. Rather, it already embodies a partial theory about what human salvation involves and about what the work of Christ accomplishes. In particular, it presupposes that saving human beings from death and separation from God primarily involves atoning for sin rather than (say) delivering human beings from some kind of bondage, repairing human nature, or something else. In the New Testament we find various terms and phrases (in addition to \u2018salvation\u2019) used to characterize or describe what the work of Jesus accomplished on behalf of humanity\u2014e.g., justification, redemption or ransom, reconciliation, deliverance from sin, re-creation or rebirth, the offering of an atoning sacrifice, abundant life, and eternal life. Obviously these terms are not all synonymous; so part of the task of an overall theology of salvation\u2014a soteriology\u2014is to sort out the relations among these various terms and phrases (is salvation simply to be identified with eternal life, for example?), to determine which are to be taken literally and which are mere metaphors, and to explain which effects have been brought about by Jesus' life, which by his death, which by his resurrection, and so on.  In light of all this, some theologians and philosophers deliberately avoid talking about \u2018theories of the atonement\u2019 and talk instead about (e.g.) \u2018the theology of reconciliation\u2019 or theories about \u2018the redemption\u2019, etc.\"{{harvnb|Murray|Rea|2012}} }}{{efn|\"At the heart of Christian faith is the reality and hope of salvation in Jesus Christ.

As a process of transformation, ''theosis'' is brought about by the effects of ''[[catharsis]]'' (purification of mind and body) and ''[[Theoria#Eastern Orthodox Catholic and Eastern Catholic Churches|theoria]]'' ('illumination' with the 'vision' of God). According to [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] teaching, ''theosis'' is very much the purpose of human life. It is considered achievable only through a synergy (or cooperation) between human activity and God's uncreated energies (or operations).{{sfn|Bartos|1999|p=253}}{{sfn|Kapsanis|2006}} The synonymous term ''[[Divinization (Christian)|divinization]]'' is the transforming effect of [[divine grace]],{{sfn|Cross|Livingston|2005c|p=700|loc=grace}} the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|spirit]] of [[God in Christianity|God]], or the atonement of [[Christ]].

Over the centuries, Christians have held different ideas about how Jesus saved people, and different views still exist within different [[Christian denominations]]. According to C. Marvin Pate, \"there are three aspects to Christ's atonement according to the early Church: [[vicarious atonement]] [substitutionary atonement],{{efn|In Christianity, vicarious atonement, also called substitutionary atonement, is the idea that Jesus died \"for us.\"{{sfn|Flood|2012|p=53}}}} the eschatological defeat of Satan [Christ the Victor], and the imitation of Christ [participation in Jesus' death and resurrection].\"{{sfn|Pate|2011|p=250-254}} Pate further notes that these three aspects were intertwined in the earliest Christian writings, but that this intertwining was lost since the Patristic times.{{sfn|Pate|2011|p=261}} Due to the influence of [[Gustaf Aulen|Gustaf Aul\u00e9n]]'s (1879\u20131978) ''Christus Victor'', the various theories or paradigms of atonement which developed after the New Testamentical writings are often grouped as \"classic paradigm,\" \"objective paradigm,\" and the \"subjective paradigm\":{{sfn|Weaver|2001|p=2}}{{sfn|Beilby|Eddy|2009|p=11-20}}{{sfn|Aul\u00e9n|1931|p=}}{{efn|[[Karl Barth]] notes a range of alternative themes: ''forensic'' (we are guilty of a crime, and Christ takes the punishment), ''financial'' (we are indebted to God, and Christ pays our debt) and ''cultic'' (Christ makes a sacrifice on our behalf). For various cultural reasons, the oldest themes (honor and sacrifice) prove to have more depth than the more modern ones (payment of a debt, punishment for a crime). But in all these alternatives, the understanding of atonement has the same structure. Human beings owe something to God that we cannot pay. Christ pays it on our behalf. Thus God remains both perfectly just (insisting on a penalty) and perfectly loving (paying the penalty himself). A great many Christians would define such a substitutionary view of the atonement as simply part of what orthodox Christians believe.{{sfn|Placher|2009|}} }}\n\n===Judaism===\nIn the Hebrew writings, God is absolute righteousness, and only pure and sinless persons can approach him.{{sfn|Cross|Livingston|2005a|p=124|loc=Atonement}} Reconciliation is achieved by an act of God, namely by his appointment of the sacrificial system,{{efn|name=\"sacrifice\"}} or, in the Prophetic view, \"by the future Divine gift of a new covenant to replace the old covenant which sinful Israel has broken.\"{{sfn|Cross|Livingston|2005a|p=124|loc=Atonement}} The Jewish scriptures describe three types of vicarious atonement which result in pureness or sinlesssness: the [[Korban Pesach|Paschal Lamb]];{{sfn|Pate|2011|p=250}} \"the [[Korban|sacrificial system]] as a whole,\" with the [[Day of Atonement]] as the most essential element;{{sfn|Pate|2011|p=250}}{{sfn|Cross|Livingston|2005a|p=124|loc=Atonement}} and the idea of the [[suffering servant]] (Isaiah 42:1\u20139, 49:1\u20136, 50:4\u201311, 52:13\u201353:12),{{sfn|Pate|2011|p=250}}<ref group=web name=\"Gandi\">Herald Gandi (2018), [https://www.tms.edu/blog/resurrection-according-to-scriptures/ ''The Resurrection: \u201cAccording to the Scriptures\u201d?'']</ref> \"the action of a Divinely sent [[Servant of the Lord]] who was 'wounded for our transgressions' and 'bare the sin of many'.\"{{sfn|Cross|Livingston|2005a|p=124|loc=Atonement}} The [[Old Testament Apocrypha]] adds a fourth idea, namely the righteous martyr (2 Maccabees, 4 Maccabees, Wisdom 2\u20135).{{sfn|Pate|2011|p=250}}{{sfn|Cross|Livingston|2005a|p=124|loc=Atonement}}\n\nThese traditions of atonement offer only temporary forgiveness,{{sfn|Pate|2011|p=250}} and ''korbanot'' (offerings) could only be used as a means of atoning for the lightest type of sin, that is sins committed in ignorance that the thing was a sin.<ref name=\"jewfaq.org1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/qorbanot.htm|title=Judaism 101: Qorbanot: Sacrifices and Offerings|website=www.jewfaq.org}}</ref>{{efn|name=\"grades of sin\"|Sins in [[Judaism]] consist of different grades of severity:<ref group=web name=\"JE.SIN\"/>\n* The lightest is the ''\u1e25e\u1e6d'', ''\u1e25a\u1e6d\u1e6da'ah'', or ''\u1e25a\u1e6d\u1e6dat''  (lit. \"fault,\" \"shortcoming,\" \"misstep\"), an infraction of a commandment committed in ignorance of the existence or meaning of that command.\n* The second kind is the ''awon'', a breach of a minor commandment committed with a full knowledge of the existence and nature of that commandment (''bemezid''). \n* The gravest kind is the ''pesha'' or ''mered'', a presumptuous and rebellious act against God.

It entails the idea that God deceived the devil,{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=5}} and that Satan, or death, had \"legitimate rights\"{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=5}} over sinful [[soul]]s in the [[afterlife]], due to the fall of man and [[Original sin|inherited sin]]. During the first millennium CE, the ransom theory of atonement was the dominant metaphor for atonement, both in eastern and western Christianity, until it was replaced in the west by Anselmus' satisfaction theory of atonement.{{sfn|Oxenham|1865|p=114}}\n\nIn one version of the idea of deception, Satan attempted to take Jesus' soul after he had died, but in doing so over-extended his authority, as Jesus had never sinned. As a consequence, Satan lost his authority completely, and all humanity gained freedom. In another version, God entered into a deal with Satan, offering to trade Jesus' soul in exchange for the souls of all people, but after the trade, God [[Resurrection of Jesus|raised Jesus from the dead]] and left Satan with nothing. Other versions held that Jesus' [[divinity]] was masked by his human form, so Satan tried to take Jesus\u2019 soul without realizing that his divinity would destroy Satan's power. Another idea is that Jesus came to teach how not to sin and Satan, in anger with this, tried to take his soul.\n\nThe ransom theory was first clearly enunciated by [[Irenaeus]] (c.130\u2013c.202),{{sfn|Oxenham|1865|p=xliv,114}} who was an outspoken critic of [[Gnosticism]], but borrowed ideas from their dualistic worldview.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=4}} In this worldview, humankind is under the power of the [[Demiurge|Demiurg]], a lesser God who has created the world. Yet, humans have a spark of the true divine nature within them, which can be liberated by [[gnosis]] (knowledge) of this divine spark. This knowledge is revealed by the [[Logos]], \"the very mind of the supreme God,\" who entered the world in the person of Jesus. Nevertheless, the Logos could not simply undo the power of the Demiurg, and had to hide his real identity, appearing as a physical form, thereby misleading the Demiurg, and liberating humankind.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=4}} In Irenaeus' writings, the Demiurge is replaced by the devil, while Justin Martyr had already eqauted Jesus and the Logos.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=4}}\n\n[[Origen]] (184\u2013253) introduced the idea that the devil held legitimate rights over humans, who were bought free by the blood of Christ.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=5-6}} He also introduced the notion that the devil was deceived in thinking that he could master the human soul.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=6}}\n\n[[Gustaf Aul\u00e9n]] reinterpreted the ransom theory in his study ''[[Christus Victor]]'' (1931),{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=8}} calling it the [[Christus Victor]] doctrine, arguing that Christ's death was not a payment to the Devil, but defeated the powers of evil, particularly [[Satan]], which had held humankind in their dominion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> According to Pugh, \"Ever since [Aul\u00e9n's] time, we call these patristic ideas the ''Christus Victor'' way of seeing the cross.\"{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=1}}\n\n====Recapitulation theory====\n{{Main|Recapitulation theory of atonement}}\n\nThe recapitulation view, first comprehensively expressed by [[Irenaeus]],{{sfn|Oxenham|1865|p=114-118}} went \"hand-in-hand\" with the ransom theory.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=1}} It says that Christ succeeds where [[Adam]] [[fall of man|failed]],{{sfn|Bethune-Baker|1903|p=334|ps=: Just as mankind in Adam lost its birthright, so in Christ mankind recovers its original condition}} undoing the wrong that Adam did and, because of his union with humanity, leads humanity on to [[immortality|eternal life]], including [[christian ethics|moral perfection]].{{sfn|Franks|n.d.|pp=37-38}} [[Divinization (Christian)|Theosis]] (\"divinisation\") is a \"corollary\" of the recapitulation.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=31}}\n\n===Objective paradigm===\n\n====Satisfaction====\n{{Main|Satisfaction theory of atonement}}\n\nIn the 11th century, [[Anselm of Canterbury]] rejected the ransom view and proposed the [[satisfaction theory of atonement]].

In this view, people needed salvation from the [[divine retribution|divine punishment]] that these offences would bring, since nothing they could do could repay the honor debt. Anselm held that Christ had infinitely honored God through his life and death and that Christ could repay what humanity owed God, thus satisfying the offence to God's honor and doing away with the need for punishment.

In the legal system, offences required punishment, and no satisfaction could be given to avert this need. They proposed a theory known as [[penal substitution]], in which Christ takes the penalty of people's sin as their substitute, thus saving people from [[Divine retribution|God's wrath]] against sin. Penal substitution thus presents Jesus saving people from the divine punishment of their past wrongdoings. However, this salvation is not presented as automatic. Rather, a person must have [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] in order to receive this free gift of salvation. In the penal substitution view, salvation is not dependent upon human effort or deeds.{{sfn|Pugh|2015}}\n\nThe penal substitution paradigm of salvation is widely held among Protestants, who often consider it central to Christianity.

Yet, the real story is not that the world rejected Him; the real story is that He was willing to let the world reject Him. Divine self-emptying, divine servanthood, and divine crucifixion are powerful themes that shock the philosophy of religion. Nietzsche called the greatest of all sins to be the murder of God (deicide). There was nothing more sinful than that. On the reverse, the greatest of all righteousness fulfilled was in the self-giving of the Son of God. This self-giving brought an end to the history of hostility between man and God. It cancelled all debts. Man had committed the greatest of all crimes, and God had allowed it to be done to Him in the ultimate divine sacrifice. The Cross was where Justice and Love met vis-\u00e0-vis. It was where man affirmed his estrangement and God affirmed His belongedness. It was where God accepted man as he was. The one act of righteousness by the Son of God nullified forever the writ of accusation against all humanity.\"<ref name=\"Marbaniang\"/>}}\n\n====Shared atonement theory====\nIn the \"shared atonement\" theory the atonement is spoken of as shared by all.

This restores the relation with God, who is loving and reaches out to humanity, and offers the possibility of ''[[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]'' c.q. [[Divinization (Christian)|divinization]], becoming the kind of humans God wants us to be.\n\nIn [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholicism]] salvation is seen as participation in the renewal of human nature itself by way of the eternal [[Logos (Christianity)|Word of God]] assuming the human nature in its fullness. In contrast to [[Western Christianity|Western branches]] of theology, Orthodox Christians tend to use the word \"expiation\" with regard to what is accomplished in the sacrificial act. In [[Orthodox theology]], expiation is an act of offering that seeks to change the one making the offering. The [[Koine Greek|Biblical Greek]] word which is translated both as \"[[propitiation]]\" and as \"expiation\" is ''hilasmos'', which means \"to make acceptable and enable one to draw close to God\".  Thus the Orthodox emphasis would be that Christ died, not to appease an angry and vindictive Father or to avert the [[Divine retribution|wrath of God]] upon sinners, but to defeat and secure the destruction of sin and death, so that those who are [[ancestral sin|fallen]] and in spiritual bondage may become divinely [[Transfiguration (religion)|transfigured]], and therefore fully human, as their Creator intended; that is to say, human creatures become God in his [[Essence-Energies distinction (Eastern Orthodox theology)|energies or operations but not in his essence or identity]], conforming to the image of Christ and reacquiring the divine likeness (see ''[[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]'').<ref>Fr.

Broadly speaking, [[Protestants]] hold to the [[Five solae|five ''solae'']] of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], which declare that salvation is attained by ''[[grace alone]]'' in ''[[Christ alone]]'' through ''[[faith alone]]'' for the ''[[Soli Deo gloria|Glory of God alone]]'' as told in ''[[Scripture alone]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nMost Protestants believe that salvation is achieved through God's grace alone, and once salvation is secured in the person, good works will be a result of this, allowing good works to often operate as a signifier for salvation. Some Protestants, such as [[Lutherans]] and the [[Reformed]], understand this to mean that God saves solely by grace, and that works follow as a necessary consequence of saving grace. Others, such as [[Methodists]] (and other Arminians), believe that salvation is by faith alone, but that salvation can be forfeited if it is not accompanied by continued faith, and the works that naturally follow from it.

In Lutheranism, it is a message relevant to people of all races and social levels, of all times and places, for \"the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men\" (Romans 5:18).

All of the elect necessarily [[perseverance of the saints|persevere in faith]] because God keeps them from falling away. Calvinists understand the doctrines of salvation to include the [[Calvinism#Five points of Calvinism|five points of Calvinism]], typically arranged in English to form the [[acrostic]] \"TULIP\".<ref>The TULIP acrostic first appeared in Loraine Boettner's ''The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination.'' The names appearing in parentheses, while not forming an acrostic, are offered by Theologian Roger Nicole in Steele's book cited herein, ''The Five Points of Calvinism: Defined.''</ref>\n\n* \"[[Total depravity]]\", also called \"total inability\", asserts that as a consequence of the [[Fall of Man|fall of man into sin]], every person born into the world is enslaved to the service of [[sin]]. People are not by nature inclined to love God with their whole heart, mind, or strength, but rather all are inclined to serve their own interests over those of their neighbor and to reject the rule of God. Thus, all people by their own faculties are morally unable to choose to follow God and be saved because they are unwilling to do so out of the necessity of their own natures. (The term \"total\" in this context refers to sin affecting every part of a person, not that every person is as evil as possible.)<ref>David Steele and Curtis Thomas, \"The Five Points of Calvinism Defined, Defended, Documented,\" pg.25, \"The adjective 'total' does not mean that each sinner is as totally or completely corrupt in his actions and thoughts as it is possible for him to be. Instead, the word 'total' is used to indicate that the \"whole\" of man's being has been affected by sin.\"</ref> This doctrine is derived from [[Augustine]]'s explanation of [[Original Sin]].\n* \"[[Unconditional election]]\" asserts that God has chosen from [[eternity]] those whom he will bring to himself not based on foreseen virtue, merit, or faith in those people; rather, it is unconditionally grounded in God's mercy alone. God has chosen from [[eternity]] to extend mercy to those he has chosen and to withhold mercy from those not chosen. Those chosen receive salvation through Christ alone.

This implies that only the sins of [[the elect]] were [[penal substitution|atoned]] for by Jesus's death. Calvinists do not believe, however, that the atonement is limited in its value or power, but rather that the atonement is limited in the sense that it is designed for some and not all. Hence, Calvinists hold that the atonement is sufficient for all and efficient for the elect.<ref>[http://www.calvinistcorner.com/tulip.htm The Five Points of Calvinism]. The Calvinist Corner.

This means that when God sovereignly purposes to save someone, that individual certainly will be saved. The doctrine holds that this purposeful influence of God's [[Holy Spirit]] cannot be resisted, but that the Holy Spirit, \"graciously causes the elect sinner to cooperate, to believe, to repent, to come freely and willingly to Christ.\"<ref>[http://www.the-highway.com/compare.html Comparison of Calvinism and Arminianism].

Those who apparently fall away either never had true faith to begin with or will return. The word \"saints\" is used to refer to all who are set apart by God, and not only those who are exceptionally [[holy]], [[Canonization|canonized]], or in [[heaven]]).<ref>{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/boettner/predest.iv.vi.html |chapter=The Perseverance of the Saints |title=The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination |author=[[Loraine Boettner]] |accessdate=2009-03-25}}</ref>\n\n===Arminianism===\n{{Main|Arminianism}}\nArminianism is a school of soteriological thought within Protestant Christianity, held by Christian denominations such as the [[Methodist Church]]. It is based on the theological ideas of the Dutch Reformed theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]] (1560\u20131609). Like Calvinists, [[Arminians]] agree that all people are born sinful and are in need of salvation. Classical Arminians emphasize that God's free grace (or [[prevenient grace]]) enables humans to freely respond to or to reject the salvation offered through Christ. Classical Arminians believe that a person's saving relationship with Christ is conditional upon faith, and thus, a person can sever their saving relationship with Christ through persistent unbelief.\n\nThe [[Five Articles of Remonstrance]] that Arminius's followers formulated in 1610 state the beliefs regarding (I) conditional election, (II) unlimited atonement, (III) total depravity, (IV) total depravity and resistible grace, and (V) possibility of apostasy. However, the fifth article did not completely deny the perseverance of the saints; Arminius said that \"I never taught that a true believer can\u2026 fall away from the faith\u2026 yet I will not conceal, that there are passages of Scripture which seem to me to wear this aspect; and those answers to them which I have been permitted to see, are not of such as kind as to approve themselves on all points to my understanding.\"<ref>Arminius ''Writings'', I:254</ref> Further, the text of the Articles of Remonstrance says that no believer can be plucked from Christ's hand, and the matter of falling away, \"loss of salvation\" required further study before it could be taught with any certainty.\n\n====Methodism====\n[[Methodism]] falls squarely in the tradition of [[substitutionary atonement]], though it is linked with Christus Victor and [[Moral influence theory of atonement|moral influence]] theories.<ref name=\"Wood2007\">{{cite journal|last=Wood|first=Darren Cushman|year=2007|title=John Wesley's Use of Atonement|journal=The Asbury Journal|volume=62|issue=2|pages=55\u201370|language=English}}</ref>  Methodism also emphasizes a participatory nature in atonement, in which the Methodist believer spiritually dies with Christ as He dies for humanity.<ref name=\"Wood2007\"/>\n\nMethodism affirms the doctrine of justification by faith, but in [[Wesleyan theology]], justification refers to \"pardon, the forgiveness of sins\", rather than \"being made actually just and righteous\", which Methodists believe is accomplished through [[Sanctification#Methodism|sanctification]].{{sfn|Elwell|2001|p=1268}}{{efn|Elwell (2001): \"This balance is most evident in Wesley's understanding of faith ''and'' works, justification ''and'' sanctification [...] Wesley himself in a sermon entitled \"Justification by Faith\" makes an attempt to define the term accurately. First, he states what justification is not. It is not being made actually just and righteous (that is sanctification). It is not being cleared of the accusations of Satan, nor of the law, nor even of God. We have sinned, so the accusation stands. Justification implies pardon, the forgiveness of sins. ... Ultimately for the true Wesleyan salvation is completed by our return to original righteousness. This is done by the work of the Holy Spirit. ... The Wesleyan tradition insists that grace is not contrasted with law but with the works of the law. Wesleyans remind us that Jesus came to fulfill, not destroy the law. God made us in his perfect image, and he wants that image restored. He wants to return us to a full and perfect obedience through the process of sanctification [...] Good works follow after justification as its inevitable fruit.

Early Christians regarded themselves as partaking in a new covenant with God, open to both Jews and gentiles, due to the sacrificial death and subsequent exaltation of Jesus Christ.\n\nEarly Christian notions of the person and sacrificial role of Jesus in human salvation were further elaborated by the Church Fathers, medieval writers and modern scholars in various atonement theories, such as the [[Ransom theory of atonement|ransom theory]], [[Christus Victor|Christus Victor theory]], the [[Recapitulation theory of atonement|recapitulation theory]], the [[Satisfaction theory of atonement|satisfaction theory]], the [[Penal substitution|penal substitution theory]], and the [[Moral influence theory of atonement|moral influence theory]].\n\nVariant views on [[salvation]] are among the main fault lines dividing the various [[Christian denominations]], including conflicting definitions of sin and [[Total depravity|depravity]] (the sinful nature of humankind), [[Justification (theology)|justification]] (God's means of removing the consequences of sin), and [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] (the [[Forgiveness#Christianity|forgiving]] or pardoning of sin through the suffering, death and [[resurrection of Jesus]]).\n\n==Definition and scope==\nSalvation in Christianity, or deliverance or redemption, is the \"saving [of] human beings from death and separation from God\" by [[Christ]]'s death and resurrection.<ref name=CDOS /><!-- **START OF NOTES** -->{{efn|name=\"definition\"|Definition of salvation in Christianity:[[OED|Oxford English Dictionary]], 2nd ed. 1989: \"The saving of the soul; the deliverance from sin and its consequences\"}}{{efn|\"Traditional Christianity maintains that human beings are subject to death and eternal separation from God as a result of their sinfulness, but that they can be saved from this condition somehow as a result of what we might refer to as \u201cthe work of Jesus\u201d, which work includes at least his suffering and death on the cross, and perhaps also his sinless life, resurrection, and ascension. We have used the term \u2018theories of the atonement\u2019 here because that is the term most commonly used in the philosophical literature on this topic, and it is a term often enough used in theology as well. But it is not a neutral term. Rather, it already embodies a partial theory about what human salvation involves and about what the work of Christ accomplishes. In particular, it presupposes that saving human beings from death and separation from God primarily involves atoning for sin rather than (say) delivering human beings from some kind of bondage, repairing human nature, or something else. In the New Testament we find various terms and phrases (in addition to \u2018salvation\u2019) used to characterize or describe what the work of Jesus accomplished on behalf of humanity\u2014e.g., justification, redemption or ransom, reconciliation, deliverance from sin, re-creation or rebirth, the offering of an atoning sacrifice, abundant life, and eternal life. Obviously these terms are not all synonymous; so part of the task of an overall theology of salvation\u2014a soteriology\u2014is to sort out the relations among these various terms and phrases (is salvation simply to be identified with eternal life, for example?), to determine which are to be taken literally and which are mere metaphors, and to explain which effects have been brought about by Jesus' life, which by his death, which by his resurrection, and so on.  In light of all this, some theologians and philosophers deliberately avoid talking about \u2018theories of the atonement\u2019 and talk instead about (e.g.) \u2018the theology of reconciliation\u2019 or theories about \u2018the redemption\u2019, etc.\"{{harvnb|Murray|Rea|2012}} }}{{efn|\"At the heart of Christian faith is the reality and hope of salvation in Jesus Christ. Christian faith is faith in the God of salvation revealed in Jesus of Nazareth. The Christian tradition has always equated this salvation with the transcendent, eschatological fulfillment of human existence in a life freed from sin, finitude, and mortality and united with the triune God.

[[Divinization (Christian)|divinization]]).{{sfn|O'Kelley|2014|p=43|ps=: =Fourth, justification is connected to the sacramental system, particularly the sacraments of baptism and penance. The former is the instrumental cause of initiaul justification, and the latter restores justification once it has been lost through mortall sin [...] Final salvation, therefore, is the result of an inherent, though imperfect, righteousness.}}\n\n''[[Theosis (Eastern Christian theology)|Theosis]]'', is a transformative process whose aim is likeness to or union with [[God]], as taught by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]. As a process of transformation, ''theosis'' is brought about by the effects of ''[[catharsis]]'' (purification of mind and body) and ''[[Theoria#Eastern Orthodox Catholic and Eastern Catholic Churches|theoria]]'' ('illumination' with the 'vision' of God). According to [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] teaching, ''theosis'' is very much the purpose of human life. It is considered achievable only through a synergy (or cooperation) between human activity and God's uncreated energies (or operations).{{sfn|Bartos|1999|p=253}}{{sfn|Kapsanis|2006}} The synonymous term ''[[Divinization (Christian)|divinization]]'' is the transforming effect of [[divine grace]],{{sfn|Cross|Livingston|2005c|p=700|loc=grace}} the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|spirit]] of [[God in Christianity|God]], or the atonement of [[Christ]]. ''Theosis'' and ''divinization'' are to be distinguished from [[sanctification]], \"being made holy,\" which can also apply to objects;{{sfn|Abraham|2019|p=224}} and from ''[[apotheosis]]'', also \"divinization,\" lit. \"making divine\").\n\nCatholics believe faith as is active in charity and good works (''fides caritate formata'') can justify man. Forgiveness of sin exists and is infused, but justification can be lost by mortal sin.{{sfn|Pohle|1910}}<ref name=\"vatican.va\">{{cite book|title=Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification|url=https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/documents/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_31101999_cath-luth-joint-declaration_en.html|accessdate=November 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the Protestant doctrine, sin is merely \"covered\", and righteousness imputed. In [[Lutheranism]] and [[Calvinism]], righteousness from God is viewed as being credited to the sinner's account through [[Sola fide|faith alone]], without [[Good works|works]]. Protestants believe faith without works can justify man because Christ died for sinners, but anyone who truly has faith will produce good works as a product of faith, as a good tree produces good fruit.

Over the centuries, Christians have held different ideas about how Jesus saved people, and different views still exist within different [[Christian denominations]]. According to C. Marvin Pate, \"there are three aspects to Christ's atonement according to the early Church: [[vicarious atonement]] [substitutionary atonement],{{efn|In Christianity, vicarious atonement, also called substitutionary atonement, is the idea that Jesus died \"for us.\"{{sfn|Flood|2012|p=53}}}} the eschatological defeat of Satan [Christ the Victor], and the imitation of Christ [participation in Jesus' death and resurrection].\"{{sfn|Pate|2011|p=250-254}} Pate further notes that these three aspects were intertwined in the earliest Christian writings, but that this intertwining was lost since the Patristic times.{{sfn|Pate|2011|p=261}} Due to the influence of [[Gustaf Aulen|Gustaf Aul\u00e9n]]'s (1879\u20131978) ''Christus Victor'', the various theories or paradigms of atonement which developed after the New Testamentical writings are often grouped as \"classic paradigm,\" \"objective paradigm,\" and the \"subjective paradigm\":{{sfn|Weaver|2001|p=2}}{{sfn|Beilby|Eddy|2009|p=11-20}}{{sfn|Aul\u00e9n|1931|p=}}{{efn|[[Karl Barth]] notes a range of alternative themes: ''forensic'' (we are guilty of a crime, and Christ takes the punishment), ''financial'' (we are indebted to God, and Christ pays our debt) and ''cultic'' (Christ makes a sacrifice on our behalf). For various cultural reasons, the oldest themes (honor and sacrifice) prove to have more depth than the more modern ones (payment of a debt, punishment for a crime). But in all these alternatives, the understanding of atonement has the same structure. Human beings owe something to God that we cannot pay. Christ pays it on our behalf. Thus God remains both perfectly just (insisting on a penalty) and perfectly loving (paying the penalty himself). A great many Christians would define such a substitutionary view of the atonement as simply part of what orthodox Christians believe.{{sfn|Placher|2009|}} }}\n\n===Judaism===\nIn the Hebrew writings, God is absolute righteousness, and only pure and sinless persons can approach him.{{sfn|Cross|Livingston|2005a|p=124|loc=Atonement}} Reconciliation is achieved by an act of God, namely by his appointment of the sacrificial system,{{efn|name=\"sacrifice\"}} or, in the Prophetic view, \"by the future Divine gift of a new covenant to replace the old covenant which sinful Israel has broken.\"{{sfn|Cross|Livingston|2005a|p=124|loc=Atonement}} The Jewish scriptures describe three types of vicarious atonement which result in pureness or sinlesssness: the [[Korban Pesach|Paschal Lamb]];{{sfn|Pate|2011|p=250}} \"the [[Korban|sacrificial system]] as a whole,\" with the [[Day of Atonement]] as the most essential element;{{sfn|Pate|2011|p=250}}{{sfn|Cross|Livingston|2005a|p=124|loc=Atonement}} and the idea of the [[suffering servant]] (Isaiah 42:1\u20139, 49:1\u20136, 50:4\u201311, 52:13\u201353:12),{{sfn|Pate|2011|p=250}}<ref group=web name=\"Gandi\">Herald Gandi (2018), [https://www.tms.edu/blog/resurrection-according-to-scriptures/ ''The Resurrection: \u201cAccording to the Scriptures\u201d?'']</ref> \"the action of a Divinely sent [[Servant of the Lord]] who was 'wounded for our transgressions' and 'bare the sin of many'.\"{{sfn|Cross|Livingston|2005a|p=124|loc=Atonement}} The [[Old Testament Apocrypha]] adds a fourth idea, namely the righteous martyr (2 Maccabees, 4 Maccabees, Wisdom 2\u20135).{{sfn|Pate|2011|p=250}}{{sfn|Cross|Livingston|2005a|p=124|loc=Atonement}}\n\nThese traditions of atonement offer only temporary forgiveness,{{sfn|Pate|2011|p=250}} and ''korbanot'' (offerings) could only be used as a means of atoning for the lightest type of sin, that is sins committed in ignorance that the thing was a sin.<ref name=\"jewfaq.org1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/qorbanot.htm|title=Judaism 101: Qorbanot: Sacrifices and Offerings|website=www.jewfaq.org}}</ref>{{efn|name=\"grades of sin\"|Sins in [[Judaism]] consist of different grades of severity:<ref group=web name=\"JE.SIN\"/>\n* The lightest is the ''\u1e25e\u1e6d'', ''\u1e25a\u1e6d\u1e6da'ah'', or ''\u1e25a\u1e6d\u1e6dat''  (lit. \"fault,\" \"shortcoming,\" \"misstep\"), an infraction of a commandment committed in ignorance of the existence or meaning of that command.\n* The second kind is the ''awon'', a breach of a minor commandment committed with a full knowledge of the existence and nature of that commandment (''bemezid''). \n* The gravest kind is the ''pesha'' or ''mered'', a presumptuous and rebellious act against God.

It entails the idea that God deceived the devil,{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=5}} and that Satan, or death, had \"legitimate rights\"{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=5}} over sinful [[soul]]s in the [[afterlife]], due to the fall of man and [[Original sin|inherited sin]]. During the first millennium CE, the ransom theory of atonement was the dominant metaphor for atonement, both in eastern and western Christianity, until it was replaced in the west by Anselmus' satisfaction theory of atonement.{{sfn|Oxenham|1865|p=114}}\n\nIn one version of the idea of deception, Satan attempted to take Jesus' soul after he had died, but in doing so over-extended his authority, as Jesus had never sinned. As a consequence, Satan lost his authority completely, and all humanity gained freedom. In another version, God entered into a deal with Satan, offering to trade Jesus' soul in exchange for the souls of all people, but after the trade, God [[Resurrection of Jesus|raised Jesus from the dead]] and left Satan with nothing. Other versions held that Jesus' [[divinity]] was masked by his human form, so Satan tried to take Jesus\u2019 soul without realizing that his divinity would destroy Satan's power. Another idea is that Jesus came to teach how not to sin and Satan, in anger with this, tried to take his soul.\n\nThe ransom theory was first clearly enunciated by [[Irenaeus]] (c.130\u2013c.202),{{sfn|Oxenham|1865|p=xliv,114}} who was an outspoken critic of [[Gnosticism]], but borrowed ideas from their dualistic worldview.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=4}} In this worldview, humankind is under the power of the [[Demiurge|Demiurg]], a lesser God who has created the world. Yet, humans have a spark of the true divine nature within them, which can be liberated by [[gnosis]] (knowledge) of this divine spark. This knowledge is revealed by the [[Logos]], \"the very mind of the supreme God,\" who entered the world in the person of Jesus. Nevertheless, the Logos could not simply undo the power of the Demiurg, and had to hide his real identity, appearing as a physical form, thereby misleading the Demiurg, and liberating humankind.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=4}} In Irenaeus' writings, the Demiurge is replaced by the devil, while Justin Martyr had already eqauted Jesus and the Logos.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=4}}\n\n[[Origen]] (184\u2013253) introduced the idea that the devil held legitimate rights over humans, who were bought free by the blood of Christ.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=5-6}} He also introduced the notion that the devil was deceived in thinking that he could master the human soul.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=6}}\n\n[[Gustaf Aul\u00e9n]] reinterpreted the ransom theory in his study ''[[Christus Victor]]'' (1931),{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=8}} calling it the [[Christus Victor]] doctrine, arguing that Christ's death was not a payment to the Devil, but defeated the powers of evil, particularly [[Satan]], which had held humankind in their dominion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> According to Pugh, \"Ever since [Aul\u00e9n's] time, we call these patristic ideas the ''Christus Victor'' way of seeing the cross.\"{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=1}}\n\n====Recapitulation theory====\n{{Main|Recapitulation theory of atonement}}\n\nThe recapitulation view, first comprehensively expressed by [[Irenaeus]],{{sfn|Oxenham|1865|p=114-118}} went \"hand-in-hand\" with the ransom theory.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=1}} It says that Christ succeeds where [[Adam]] [[fall of man|failed]],{{sfn|Bethune-Baker|1903|p=334|ps=: Just as mankind in Adam lost its birthright, so in Christ mankind recovers its original condition}} undoing the wrong that Adam did and, because of his union with humanity, leads humanity on to [[immortality|eternal life]], including [[christian ethics|moral perfection]].{{sfn|Franks|n.d.|pp=37-38}} [[Divinization (Christian)|Theosis]] (\"divinisation\") is a \"corollary\" of the recapitulation.{{sfn|Pugh|2015|p=31}}\n\n===Objective paradigm===\n\n====Satisfaction====\n{{Main|Satisfaction theory of atonement}}\n\nIn the 11th century, [[Anselm of Canterbury]] rejected the ransom view and proposed the [[satisfaction theory of atonement]].

In this view, people needed salvation from the [[divine retribution|divine punishment]] that these offences would bring, since nothing they could do could repay the honor debt. Anselm held that Christ had infinitely honored God through his life and death and that Christ could repay what humanity owed God, thus satisfying the offence to God's honor and doing away with the need for punishment. When Anselm proposed the satisfaction view, it was immediately criticized by [[Peter Abelard]].\n\n====Penal substitution====\n{{Main|Penal substitution}}\n\nIn the 16th century, the [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant Reformers]] reinterpreted Anselm's satisfaction theory of salvation within a legal paradigm. In the legal system, offences required punishment, and no satisfaction could be given to avert this need. They proposed a theory known as [[penal substitution]], in which Christ takes the penalty of people's sin as their substitute, thus saving people from [[Divine retribution|God's wrath]] against sin. Penal substitution thus presents Jesus saving people from the divine punishment of their past wrongdoings. However, this salvation is not presented as automatic. Rather, a person must have [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] in order to receive this free gift of salvation. In the penal substitution view, salvation is not dependent upon human effort or deeds.{{sfn|Pugh|2015}}\n\nThe penal substitution paradigm of salvation is widely held among Protestants, who often consider it central to Christianity.

It cancelled all debts. Man had committed the greatest of all crimes, and God had allowed it to be done to Him in the ultimate divine sacrifice. The Cross was where Justice and Love met vis-\u00e0-vis. It was where man affirmed his estrangement and God affirmed His belongedness. It was where God accepted man as he was.

This restores the relation with God, who is loving and reaches out to humanity, and offers the possibility of ''[[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]'' c.q. [[Divinization (Christian)|divinization]], becoming the kind of humans God wants us to be.\n\nIn [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholicism]] salvation is seen as participation in the renewal of human nature itself by way of the eternal [[Logos (Christianity)|Word of God]] assuming the human nature in its fullness. In contrast to [[Western Christianity|Western branches]] of theology, Orthodox Christians tend to use the word \"expiation\" with regard to what is accomplished in the sacrificial act. In [[Orthodox theology]], expiation is an act of offering that seeks to change the one making the offering. The [[Koine Greek|Biblical Greek]] word which is translated both as \"[[propitiation]]\" and as \"expiation\" is ''hilasmos'', which means \"to make acceptable and enable one to draw close to God\".  Thus the Orthodox emphasis would be that Christ died, not to appease an angry and vindictive Father or to avert the [[Divine retribution|wrath of God]] upon sinners, but to defeat and secure the destruction of sin and death, so that those who are [[ancestral sin|fallen]] and in spiritual bondage may become divinely [[Transfiguration (religion)|transfigured]], and therefore fully human, as their Creator intended; that is to say, human creatures become God in his [[Essence-Energies distinction (Eastern Orthodox theology)|energies or operations but not in his essence or identity]], conforming to the image of Christ and reacquiring the divine likeness (see ''[[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]'').<ref>Fr.

Broadly speaking, [[Protestants]] hold to the [[Five solae|five ''solae'']] of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], which declare that salvation is attained by ''[[grace alone]]'' in ''[[Christ alone]]'' through ''[[faith alone]]'' for the ''[[Soli Deo gloria|Glory of God alone]]'' as told in ''[[Scripture alone]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nMost Protestants believe that salvation is achieved through God's grace alone, and once salvation is secured in the person, good works will be a result of this, allowing good works to often operate as a signifier for salvation. Some Protestants, such as [[Lutherans]] and the [[Reformed]], understand this to mean that God saves solely by grace, and that works follow as a necessary consequence of saving grace. Others, such as [[Methodists]] (and other Arminians), believe that salvation is by faith alone, but that salvation can be forfeited if it is not accompanied by continued faith, and the works that naturally follow from it. A minority rigidly believe that salvation is accomplished by [[Sola fide|faith alone]] without any reference to works whatsoever, including the works that may follow salvation (see [[Free Grace theology]]).\n\n===Lutheranism===\n{{Main|Lutheranism}}\nLutherans believe that God has [[Unlimited atonement|justified all sinners]], that is, he has declared them \"[[Justification (theology)|not guilty]]\" for the sake of Christ. Lutheran churches believe that this is the central message in the [[Bible]] upon which the very existence of the churches depends. In Lutheranism, it is a message relevant to people of all races and social levels, of all times and places, for \"the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men\" (Romans 5:18). All need forgiveness of sins before God, and Scripture proclaims that all have been justified, for \"the result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men\" (Romans 5:18).<ref>[https://wels.net/about-wels/what-we-believe/this-we-believe/justification/ This We Believe \u2013 IV.

People are not by nature inclined to love God with their whole heart, mind, or strength, but rather all are inclined to serve their own interests over those of their neighbor and to reject the rule of God. Thus, all people by their own faculties are morally unable to choose to follow God and be saved because they are unwilling to do so out of the necessity of their own natures. (The term \"total\" in this context refers to sin affecting every part of a person, not that every person is as evil as possible.)<ref>David Steele and Curtis Thomas, \"The Five Points of Calvinism Defined, Defended, Documented,\" pg.25, \"The adjective 'total' does not mean that each sinner is as totally or completely corrupt in his actions and thoughts as it is possible for him to be. Instead, the word 'total' is used to indicate that the \"whole\" of man's being has been affected by sin.\"</ref> This doctrine is derived from [[Augustine]]'s explanation of [[Original Sin]].\n* \"[[Unconditional election]]\" asserts that God has chosen from [[eternity]] those whom he will bring to himself not based on foreseen virtue, merit, or faith in those people; rather, it is unconditionally grounded in God's mercy alone. God has chosen from [[eternity]] to extend mercy to those he has chosen and to withhold mercy from those not chosen. Those chosen receive salvation through Christ alone.

This implies that only the sins of [[the elect]] were [[penal substitution|atoned]] for by Jesus's death. Calvinists do not believe, however, that the atonement is limited in its value or power, but rather that the atonement is limited in the sense that it is designed for some and not all. Hence, Calvinists hold that the atonement is sufficient for all and efficient for the elect.<ref>[http://www.calvinistcorner.com/tulip.htm The Five Points of Calvinism]. The Calvinist Corner.

This means that when God sovereignly purposes to save someone, that individual certainly will be saved. The doctrine holds that this purposeful influence of God's [[Holy Spirit]] cannot be resisted, but that the Holy Spirit, \"graciously causes the elect sinner to cooperate, to believe, to repent, to come freely and willingly to Christ.\"<ref>[http://www.the-highway.com/compare.html Comparison of Calvinism and Arminianism].

Those who apparently fall away either never had true faith to begin with or will return.

It is based on the theological ideas of the Dutch Reformed theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]] (1560\u20131609). Like Calvinists, [[Arminians]] agree that all people are born sinful and are in need of salvation. Classical Arminians emphasize that God's free grace (or [[prevenient grace]]) enables humans to freely respond to or to reject the salvation offered through Christ. Classical Arminians believe that a person's saving relationship with Christ is conditional upon faith, and thus, a person can sever their saving relationship with Christ through persistent unbelief.\n\nThe [[Five Articles of Remonstrance]] that Arminius's followers formulated in 1610 state the beliefs regarding (I) conditional election, (II) unlimited atonement, (III) total depravity, (IV) total depravity and resistible grace, and (V) possibility of apostasy. However, the fifth article did not completely deny the perseverance of the saints; Arminius said that \"I never taught that a true believer can\u2026 fall away from the faith\u2026 yet I will not conceal, that there are passages of Scripture which seem to me to wear this aspect; and those answers to them which I have been permitted to see, are not of such as kind as to approve themselves on all points to my understanding.\"<ref>Arminius ''Writings'', I:254</ref> Further, the text of the Articles of Remonstrance says that no believer can be plucked from Christ's hand, and the matter of falling away, \"loss of salvation\" required further study before it could be taught with any certainty.\n\n====Methodism====\n[[Methodism]] falls squarely in the tradition of [[substitutionary atonement]], though it is linked with Christus Victor and [[Moral influence theory of atonement|moral influence]] theories.<ref name=\"Wood2007\">{{cite journal|last=Wood|first=Darren Cushman|year=2007|title=John Wesley's Use of Atonement|journal=The Asbury Journal|volume=62|issue=2|pages=55\u201370|language=English}}</ref>  Methodism also emphasizes a participatory nature in atonement, in which the Methodist believer spiritually dies with Christ as He dies for humanity.<ref name=\"Wood2007\"/>\n\nMethodism affirms the doctrine of justification by faith, but in [[Wesleyan theology]], justification refers to \"pardon, the forgiveness of sins\", rather than \"being made actually just and righteous\", which Methodists believe is accomplished through [[Sanctification#Methodism|sanctification]].{{sfn|Elwell|2001|p=1268}}{{efn|Elwell (2001): \"This balance is most evident in Wesley's understanding of faith ''and'' works, justification ''and'' sanctification [...] Wesley himself in a sermon entitled \"Justification by Faith\" makes an attempt to define the term accurately.

It is not being cleared of the accusations of Satan, nor of the law, nor even of God. We have sinned, so the accusation stands. Justification implies pardon, the forgiveness of sins. ... Ultimately for the true Wesleyan salvation is completed by our return to original righteousness. This is done by the work of the Holy Spirit. ... The Wesleyan tradition insists that grace is not contrasted with law but with the works of the law. Wesleyans remind us that Jesus came to fulfill, not destroy the law. God made us in his perfect image, and he wants that image restored.

Swedenborg's account of atonement has much in common with the Christus Victor doctrine, which refers to a [[Christianity|Christian]] understanding of the Atonement which views  [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ's death]] as the means by which the powers of [[evil]], which held humanity under their dominion, were defeated.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Leon Morris, 'Theories of the Atonement' in ''Elwell Evangelical Dictionary''.</ref> It is a model of the atonement that is dated to the [[Church Fathers]],<ref name=Oxenham>H.

In the [[Book of Mormon]] the prophet [[Amulek]] teaches that the \"great and last sacrifice will be the Son of God, yea, infinite and eternal. And thus he shall bring salvation to all those who shall believe on his name\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.14-16?lang=eng|title=Alma 34:14\u201316}}</ref> There are two parts of salvation, conditional and unconditional. Unconditional salvation means that the atonement of Jesus Christ redeems all humanity from the chains of death and they are resurrected to their perfect frames.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/40.23?lang=eng|title=Alma 40:23}}</ref> Conditional salvation of the righteous comes by grace coupled with strict obedience to Gospel principles, in which those who have upheld the highest standards and are committed to the [[Covenant (Latter Day Saints)|covenants]] and [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]] of God, will inherit the [[Celestial kingdom|highest heaven]]. There is no need for infant baptism. Christ's atonement completely resolved the consequence from the fall of Adam of [[spiritual death]] for infants, young children and those of innocent mental capacity who die before an age of self-accountability, hence all these are resurrected to eternal life in the resurrection. However, baptism is required of those who are deemed by God to be accountable for their actions ([https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/8.10-22?lang=eng Moroni 8:10\u201322])\n\n===The United Pentecostal Church===\n[[Oneness Pentecostals]] teach that the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ are the only means by which atonement can be obtained for dying humanity, and which makes the free gift of God's salvation possible.  They believe that all must put faith in the propitiatory work of Christ to gain everlasting life.  According to United Pentecostal theology, this saving faith is more than just mental assent or intellectual acceptance, or even verbal profession, but must include trust, appropriation, application, action, and obedience.  They contend that [[water baptism]] is one of the works of faith and obedience necessary for Christ's sacrificial atonement to be efficacious.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110612115253/http://upci.org/about-us/beliefs/21-about-us/beliefs/91 Our Doctrinal Foundation] \u2013 United Pentecostal Church International.
