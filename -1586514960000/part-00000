Its 20mm variant, the '''20&nbsp;mm MG 151/20''' cannon, was widely used on German [[Luftwaffe]] [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]], [[night fighter]]s, [[fighter-bomber]]s, [[bomber]]s and [[ground-attack aircraft]].  Salvaged guns saw post-war use by other nations.\n\n== Development and wartime history (MG 151/20)==\nThe pre-war German doctrine for arming single-engine [[fighter aircraft]] mirrored that of the French. This doctrine favored a powerful autocannon mounted between the cylinder banks of a [[V engine]] and firing through the propeller hub, known as a ''moteur-canon'' in French (from its first use with the [[Hispano-Suiza 8#Variants|Hispano-Suiza HS.8C engine]] in World War I, on the [[SPAD S.XII]]) and by the cognate ''Motorkanone'' in German by the 1930s. The weapon preferred by the French in this role was the most powerful 20mm Oerlikon of the time, namely the [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|FFS]] model, but this proved too big for German engines. Mauser was given the task of developing a gun that would fit, with a minimum sacrifice in performance. (As a stop-gap measure, the [[MG FF cannon]] was developed and put in widespread use, but its performance was lackluster.{{sfnp|Williams|2002|pp=161\u2013162}})\n\nProduction of the MG 151 in its original 15&nbsp;mm calibre format began in 1940.  After combat evaluation of the 15&nbsp;mm cartridge as the main armament of early [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]F-2 fighters, the cannon was redesigned as the 20&nbsp;mm MG 151/20 in 1941 to fire a 20&nbsp;mm cartridge. Combat experience showed that a more powerful explosive shell was preferable to a higher projectile velocity.{{sfnp|Williams|2002|pp=165}} The MG 151/20 cartridge was created by expanding the neck of the cartridge to hold the larger explosive [[Shell (projectile)|shell]] used in the [[MG FF cannon]], and shortening the length of the cartridge case holding the longer 20&nbsp;mm shell to match the overall length of the original 15&nbsp;mm cartridge.{{sfnp|Williams|2002|pp=165}} These measures simplified conversion of the 15&nbsp;mm to the 20&nbsp;mm MG 151/20, requiring only a change of barrel and other small modifications.  A disadvantage of the simplified conversion was reduction of projectile [[muzzle velocity]] from {{convert|850|m/s}} for the 15&nbsp;mm shell to {{convert|700|m/s}} for the larger and heavier 20&nbsp;mm shell.{{sfnp|Johnson|1944|pp=384\u2013385}} With an AP projectile the new 20 mm cartridge could penetrate only around 10\u201312 mm of armor at 300 m and at 60 degrees, compared to 18 mm penetration for its 15 mm predecessor in the same conditions but this was not seen as a significant limitation.{{sfnp|Williams|2002|pp=165}} The 20&nbsp;mm version thus became the standard inboard cannon from the Bf 109F-4 series.{{sfnp|Williams|2002|pp=165}} The 20&nbsp;mm MG 151/20 offered more predictable trajectory, longer range and higher impact velocity than the {{convert|580|m/s}} cartridge of the earlier MG FF cannon.{{sfnp|Johnson|1944|pp=384\u2013385}} The MG FF was retained for flexible, wing and upward firing ''[[Schr\u00e4ge Musik]]'' mounts to the end of the war.{{sfnp|Williams|2002|pp=163}}\n\nThe German preference for explosion rather than armor penetration was taken further with the development of the ''[[Minengescho\u00df]]'' ammunition, first introduced for the MG FF (in the Bf&nbsp;109&nbsp;E-4) and later introduced for the MG 151/20. Even this improvement in explosive power turned out to be unsatisfactory against the four-engine bombers that German fighters were up against in the second part of the war. By German calculations, it took about 15\u201320 hits with the MG 151/20 to down a heavy bomber but this was reduced to just 3\u20134 hits for a 30&nbsp;mm shell, from the [[Brisance|shattering]] effects of the [[RDX|hexogen]] explosive in the shells used for both the long-barreled [[MK 103 cannon|MK 103]] and shorter barreled [[MK 108 cannon]]. Only 4\u20135 hits with 20&nbsp;mm calibre cannon were needed for frontal attacks on four-engined bombers but such attacks were difficult to execute. The 30&nbsp;mm MK 108 cannon thus replaced the MG 151/20 as the standard, engine-mount  ''Motorkanone'' centre-line armament starting with the Bf&nbsp;109&nbsp;K-4 and was also retrofitted to some of the G-series.{{sfnp|Williams|2002|pp=166\u2013167}}\n\nEight hundred MG 151/20 exported to Japan aboard the Italian submarine {{ship|Italian submarine|Comandante Cappellini||2}} in August 1943 were used to equip 388 [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force|Japanese]] [[Kawasaki Ki-61]]-I Hei fighters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.markkaiser.com/japaneseaviation/hien.html |title=Ki-61 Hien survey |last=Kaiser |first=Mark |date=1999 |website=Japanese Aviation |access-date=2009-06-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731101040/http://www.markkaiser.com/japaneseaviation/hien.html |archive-date=2009-07-31}}</ref> The 20&nbsp;mm MG 151/20 was also fitted on the [[Macchi C.205]], the [[Fiat G.55]] and [[Reggiane Re.2005]] of the [[Regia Aeronautica]] and [[IAR 80#IAR.81|IAR 81B and 81C]] of the Romanian Royal Air Force.{{sfnp|Williams|Gustin|2003|pp=238, 274\u2013275}}\n\n[[File:MG151 and MG151-20 variants from German Manual, 1942.jpg|thumb|The MG151/20 and MG151/15 variants with a normal (left) and electric (right) ignition.]]\n\n===Postwar Use===\n[[File:20 TorKK MG-151 2 Torpin Tykit 3.JPG|thumb|Two MG 151/20 cannon fitted to a Finnish ''TorKK MG-151 2'' anti-aircraft mounting.

A speculative order of 5,000 T17 guns was placed but only around 300 of them were built. However none saw service despite the availability of 6 million rounds of .60 caliber ammunition.{{sfnp|Williams|2002|pp=154}} Almost one million rounds were fired during the T17 testing program. The main US version produced, the T17E3, was made by [[Frigidaire]]; it weighed {{convert|134|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and had a rate of fire of only 600 rounds per minute. Further refinements led to the T39 and T51 versions, but these also did not enter service.{{sfnp|Chinn|1951|pp=105\u2013153}}\n\n===Ammunition===\nA cartridge originally based on an armor-piercing round designed in 1939 for use with the experimental T1 and T1E1 anti-tank rifles. It was cancelled in 1944 when it became clear that modern tanks had armor too thick to penetrate with a heavy rifle cartridge. Developments showed that [[Monroe effect|shaped-charged]] [[M9 rifle grenade|rifle grenades]] and [[Bazooka|rocket launchers]] were the future of infantry anti-tank weapons and the anti-tank rifle concept was abandoned. \n\nMuch like the British attempts to turn their stocks of obsolete .55 Boys anti-tank cartridges into a native-designed heavy machinegun cartridge, the .60-caliber cartridge was repurposed as an auto-cannon cartridge to succeed the older .50 Browning. The ammunition and the T17 cannon were produced from 1942 to 1946 but never proved a substantial improvement over the .50 Browning and the M2HB and M3 heavy machineguns. The cartridge was later shortened and necked-up to produce the 20x102mm Vulcan autocannon round.\n  \n*'''.60 Armor-Piercing (15.2 x 114mm T1E1)''' - A 1180 grain (76.5 gram) kinetic penetrator projectile with a velocity of 3,600 feet per second (1,100 m/s) for a muzzle energy of over 34,000 ft./lbs.

Its 20mm variant, the '''20&nbsp;mm MG 151/20''' cannon, was widely used on German [[Luftwaffe]] [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]], [[night fighter]]s, [[fighter-bomber]]s, [[bomber]]s and [[ground-attack aircraft]].  Salvaged guns saw post-war use by other nations.\n\n== Development and wartime history (MG 151/20)==\nThe pre-war German doctrine for arming single-engine [[fighter aircraft]] mirrored that of the French. This doctrine favored a powerful autocannon mounted between the cylinder banks of a [[V engine]] and firing through the propeller hub, known as a ''moteur-canon'' in French (from its first use with the [[Hispano-Suiza 8#Variants|Hispano-Suiza HS.8C engine]] in World War I, on the [[SPAD S.XII]]) and by the cognate ''Motorkanone'' in German by the 1930s. The weapon preferred by the French in this role was the most powerful 20mm Oerlikon of the time, namely the [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|FFS]] model, but this proved too big for German engines. Mauser was given the task of developing a gun that would fit, with a minimum sacrifice in performance. (As a stop-gap measure, the [[MG FF cannon]] was developed and put in widespread use, but its performance was lackluster.{{sfnp|Williams|2002|pp=161\u2013162}})\n\nProduction of the MG 151 in its original 15&nbsp;mm calibre format began in 1940.  After combat evaluation of the 15&nbsp;mm cartridge as the main armament of early [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]F-2 fighters, the cannon was redesigned as the 20&nbsp;mm MG 151/20 in 1941 to fire a 20&nbsp;mm cartridge. Combat experience showed that a more powerful explosive shell was preferable to a higher projectile velocity.{{sfnp|Williams|2002|pp=165}} The MG 151/20 cartridge was created by expanding the neck of the cartridge to hold the larger explosive [[Shell (projectile)|shell]] used in the [[MG FF cannon]], and shortening the length of the cartridge case holding the longer 20&nbsp;mm shell to match the overall length of the original 15&nbsp;mm cartridge.{{sfnp|Williams|2002|pp=165}} These measures simplified conversion of the 15&nbsp;mm to the 20&nbsp;mm MG 151/20, requiring only a change of barrel and other small modifications.  A disadvantage of the simplified conversion was reduction of projectile [[muzzle velocity]] from {{convert|850|m/s}} for the 15&nbsp;mm shell to {{convert|700|m/s}} for the larger and heavier 20&nbsp;mm shell.{{sfnp|Johnson|1944|pp=384\u2013385}} With an AP projectile the new 20 mm cartridge could penetrate only around 10\u201312 mm of armor at 300 m and at 60 degrees, compared to 18 mm penetration for its 15 mm predecessor in the same conditions but this was not seen as a significant limitation.{{sfnp|Williams|2002|pp=165}} The 20&nbsp;mm version thus became the standard inboard cannon from the Bf 109F-4 series.{{sfnp|Williams|2002|pp=165}} The 20&nbsp;mm MG 151/20 offered more predictable trajectory, longer range and higher impact velocity than the {{convert|580|m/s}} cartridge of the earlier MG FF cannon.{{sfnp|Johnson|1944|pp=384\u2013385}} The MG FF was retained for flexible, wing and upward firing ''[[Schr\u00e4ge Musik]]'' mounts to the end of the war.{{sfnp|Williams|2002|pp=163}}\n\nThe German preference for explosion rather than armor penetration was taken further with the development of the ''[[Minengescho\u00df]]'' ammunition, first introduced for the MG FF (in the Bf&nbsp;109&nbsp;E-4) and later introduced for the MG 151/20. Even this improvement in explosive power turned out to be unsatisfactory against the four-engine bombers that German fighters were up against in the second part of the war. By German calculations, it took about 15\u201320 hits with the MG 151/20 to down a heavy bomber but this was reduced to just 3\u20134 hits for a 30&nbsp;mm shell, from the [[Brisance|shattering]] effects of the [[RDX|hexogen]] explosive in the shells used for both the long-barreled [[MK 103 cannon|MK 103]] and shorter barreled [[MK 108 cannon]]. Only 4\u20135 hits with 20&nbsp;mm calibre cannon were needed for frontal attacks on four-engined bombers but such attacks were difficult to execute. The 30&nbsp;mm MK 108 cannon thus replaced the MG 151/20 as the standard, engine-mount  ''Motorkanone'' centre-line armament starting with the Bf&nbsp;109&nbsp;K-4 and was also retrofitted to some of the G-series.{{sfnp|Williams|2002|pp=166\u2013167}}\n\nEight hundred MG 151/20 exported to Japan aboard the Italian submarine {{ship|Italian submarine|Comandante Cappellini||2}} in August 1943 were used to equip 388 [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force|Japanese]] [[Kawasaki Ki-61]]-I Hei fighters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.markkaiser.com/japaneseaviation/hien.html |title=Ki-61 Hien survey |last=Kaiser |first=Mark |date=1999 |website=Japanese Aviation |access-date=2009-06-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731101040/http://www.markkaiser.com/japaneseaviation/hien.html |archive-date=2009-07-31}}</ref> The 20&nbsp;mm MG 151/20 was also fitted on the [[Macchi C.205]], the [[Fiat G.55]] and [[Reggiane Re.2005]] of the [[Regia Aeronautica]] and [[IAR 80#IAR.81|IAR 81B and 81C]] of the Romanian Royal Air Force.{{sfnp|Williams|Gustin|2003|pp=238, 274\u2013275}}\n\n[[File:MG151 and MG151-20 variants from German Manual, 1942.jpg|thumb|The MG151/20 and MG151/15 variants with a normal (left) and electric (right) ignition.]]\n\n===Postwar Use===\n[[File:20 TorKK MG-151 2 Torpin Tykit 3.JPG|thumb|Two MG 151/20 cannon fitted to a Finnish ''TorKK MG-151 2'' anti-aircraft mounting.

A speculative order of 5,000 T17 guns was placed but only around 300 of them were built. However none saw service despite the availability of 6 million rounds of .60 caliber ammunition.{{sfnp|Williams|2002|pp=154}} Almost one million rounds were fired during the T17 testing program. The main US version produced, the T17E3, was made by [[Frigidaire]]; it weighed {{convert|134|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and had a rate of fire of only 600 rounds per minute. Further refinements led to the T39 and T51 versions, but these also did not enter service.{{sfnp|Chinn|1951|pp=105\u2013153}}\n\n===Ammunition===\nA cartridge originally based on an armor-piercing round designed in 1939 for use with the experimental T1 and T1E1 anti-tank rifles. It was cancelled in 1944 when it became clear that modern tanks had armor too thick to penetrate with a heavy rifle cartridge. Developments showed that [[Monroe effect|shaped-charged]] [[M9 rifle grenade|rifle grenades]] and [[Bazooka|rocket launchers]] were the future of infantry anti-tank weapons and the anti-tank rifle concept was abandoned. \n\nMuch like the British attempts to turn their stocks of obsolete .55 Boys anti-tank cartridges into a native-designed heavy machinegun cartridge, the .60-caliber cartridge was repurposed as an auto-cannon cartridge to succeed the older .50 Browning. The ammunition and the T17 cannon were produced from 1942 to 1946 but never proved a substantial improvement over the .50 Browning and the M2HB and M3 heavy machineguns. The cartridge was later shortened and necked-up to produce the 20x102mm Vulcan autocannon round.\n  \n*'''.60 Armor-Piercing (15.2 x 114mm T1E1)''' - A 1180 grain (76.5 gram) kinetic penetrator projectile with a velocity of 3,600 feet per second (1,100 m/s) for a muzzle energy of over 34,000 ft./lbs.

Between 1866 and 1871 he studied in [[Berlin]] at the [[Bauakademie|Royal Building Academy]]. During his studies, Gorgolewski also supervised the construction of Hanover Train Station in Berlin. After graduating, for six years he worked as an assistant in his alma mater. After that he became an advisor at the German Ministry of Public Works, official royal palace architect and architecture inspector in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]].<ref name=\"Stanski\">{{in lang|pl}} [http://www.lwow.home.pl/semper/gorgolewski.html Piotr Marek Sta\u0144ski - ''Zygmunt Gorgolewski, tw\u00f3rca gmachu Lwowskiego Teatru Wielkiego'']</ref> Gorgolewski was one of the most notable supporters of [[historicism (architecture)|historicism]] in architecture in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and then the [[German Empire]]. \n\nAmong his projects were two versions of the future [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] building, which he proposed in 1872 and then in 1882. His projects were among merely 20 chosen by the committee out of more than 100. However, in the end his ideas for these projects were refused.<ref name=\"Stanski\"/> At the same time, Gorgolewski was awarded with the construction of Kaiser Wilhelm's Bridge. Other, more successful, projects include the plans of refurbishment of royal palaces in Berlin and [[Kiel]], expansion of University Hospitals in Halle and [[Bonn]], expansion of [[Bad Oeynhausen]] spa in [[Province of Westphalia|Westphalia]]. In addition, he was the main architect of the Protestant cathedral in Berlin, [[Belle Vue (Palace)|Belle Vue]] palace, courthouses in [[Opole|Opole (Oppeln)]] and [[Olsztyn|Olsztyn (Allenstein)]], as well as prisons in [[\u015awidnica|\u015awidnica (Schweidnitz)]] and [[Chorz\u00f3w|Chorz\u00f3w (K\u00f6nigsh\u00fctte)]]. \n\nIn the [[Greater Poland]] region, Gorgolewski conducted the construction of many notable palaces both in and around [[Pozna\u0144]].

During his stay there, Gorgolewski for the first time visited [[Vilnius]], [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Kiev]] and [[Lviv]].<ref name=\"Stanski\"/> The latter city enjoyed a period of fast expansion and in 1875 Gorgolewski took part in the contest for the project of the future [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galician]] [[Sejm]]. His project was the most disputed and highly praised, but it was finally turned down, mostly due to financial reasons. \n\nIn 1879, Gorgolewski married Helena ''n\u00e9e'' Hulewicz. He was also an active member of many architectural juries across partitioned Poland. Among others, he was the member of the jury during the contest for the project of [[Teatr Stary|Krak\u00f3w Old Theatre]] (1889), the bank in [[Czerniowce]] and [[Church of St. Elizabeth, Lviv|Church of St. Elizabeth in Lviv]]. In 1893 he moved to Lviv, where he was chosen as the main architect of the Grand Theatre (1897\u20131900). To avoid being accused of using his well-established position in society, Gorgolewski prepared his winning project of the theatre in secret<ref name=\"Stanski\"/> and then sent it under a [[Pseudonym|false name]] from [[Leipzig]]. Other notable building of his authorship was the Industrial School in the same city.\n\nGorgolewski died in Lviv and was buried in the [[Lychakiv Cemetery]].<ref name=\"Stanski\"/>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=200 heights=160>\nImage:LvivOperaHouse2013.JPG|Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet\nImage:Pa\u0142ac wybudowany dla ordynata Tadeusza Twardowskiego 01.JPG|[[Kobylniki, Szamotu\u0142y County|Kobylniki]] Palace\nImage:Siedziba Pozna\u0144skiego Towarzystwa Przyjaci\u00f3\u0142 Nauk.jpg|Seat of the Pozna\u0144 Society of Friends of Arts and Sciences\nImage:Lwow-grobGorgolewskiego.jpg|Tomb of the Gorgolewski family in Lviv\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of Lviv]]\n*[[Teodor Talowski]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gorgolewski, Zygmunt}}\n[[Category:1845 births]]\n[[Category:1903 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Solec Kujawski]]\n[[Category:Polish architects]]\n[[Category:People from the Province of Posen]]\n[[Category:Architects from Lviv]]\n[[Category:Burials at Lychakiv Cemetery]]\n", "name_user": "Ulf Heinsohn", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLife and career:+lks", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygmunt_Gorgolewski"}

She grew up in Berlin, Germany and received a thorough musical education from teachers including her mother, [[Ludwig Berger (composer)|Ludwig Berger]], and [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]]. Her brother [[Felix Mendelssohn]], also a composer and pianist, shared the same education and the two developed a close relationship. Due to social expectations for women at the time discouraging the publication of her compositions, a number of her works were published under her brother's name in his [[Opus number|Opus]] 8 and 9 collections. In 1829, she married painter [[Wilhelm Hensel]] and, in 1820, the two had a single child, Sebastian Hensel. In 1846, despite the ambivalence of her family towards her musical ambitions, Fanny Hensel published a collection of songs as her Opus 1. The next year, she suddenly died of a stroke.\n\nShe composed over 460 pieces of music, including a [[piano trio]], a [[piano quartet]], an orchestral overture, four cantatas, over 125 pieces for the piano, and an excess of 250 [[Lied|Lieder]], most of which went unpublished in her lifetime.
