Lee Thompson]] based on the book by his wife, [[Joan Henry]], starring [[Glynis Johns]] and [[Diana Dors]].\n\nBased on a best-selling book and prison experiences of author Joan Henry, director [[J. Lee Thompson]]'s prison saga explores the life of inmates behind bars where innocence is lost in the world of vice.

The serial involves the [[Time travel in fiction|time traveller]] the [[First Doctor]] ([[William Hartnell]]) and his travelling [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companions]] [[Ian Chesterton]] ([[William Russell (English actor)|William Russell]]), [[Barbara Wright (Doctor Who)|Barbara Wright]] ([[Jacqueline Hill]]), and [[Vicki (Doctor Who)|Vicki]] ([[Maureen O'Brien]]) allying themselves with the former inhabitants of the planet [[Vortis (Doctor Who)|Vortis]], the Menoptra, as they struggle to win back Vortis from the malignant Animus.\n\n==Plot==\n{{needsattention|project=Doctor Who|type=multiple|date=June 2017|\n{{long plot|date=June 2017|episodes}}\n}}\nAn unknown force pulls the [[TARDIS]] off course and forces it to land on an unknown planet. Whilst exploring with [[Ian Chesterton|Ian]], the [[First Doctor]] recognises the planet as [[Vortis (Doctor Who)|Vortis]]; however, the presence of several moons in the sky of the normally moonless planet puzzles him.\n\nInside the ship, an unknown force acting through [[Barbara Wright (Doctor Who)|Barbara]]'s gold bracelet draws her outside, leaving [[Vicki (Doctor Who)|Vicki]] alone. The TARDIS is then pulled by an unseen force across the planet's surface.\n\nIn her trance, Barbara walks into a trio of the butterfly-like Menoptra. They remove her bracelet, freeing her of the trance, then debate what to do with her. She escapes, but the Zarbi immediately capture her. Brainwashed through the use of a gold collar, the Zarbi use Barbara to find the Menoptra. The Zarbi take Barbara and the Menoptra called Hrostar to the Crater of Needles, where the Zarbi force them to gather vegetation and drop it into rivers of acid which feed the Animus.\n\nThe Zarbi capture the Doctor and Ian and take them to the Carsinome. There they find Vicki and the TARDIS. They also meet the Animus who forces the Doctor to help it track down the Menoptra invasion force. Ian escapes, whilst the Doctor and Vicki try to bide their time.\n[[File:Menoptra (28807516473).jpg|thumb|left|A Menoptra, on display at the Doctor Who Experience.]]\nIan meets with a Menoptra called Vrestin. He learns that the Menoptra were native to the planet Vortis along with the Zarbi, until a great evil force, the Animus, slowly and gradually took control of the planet through the Zarbi. By the time the Menoptra noticed the danger it was too late, and they had to flee the planet to one of the moons the Animus pulled into orbit around Vortis.\n\nBack in the Carsinome, the Doctor accidentally reveals that the Menoptra spearhead plans to land at a place near the Crater of Needles. The Animus uses this information to ambush them.\n\nThe Zarbi soon locate Ian and Vrestin, but they escape when they fall into a tunnel. Inside they meet the Optera, descendants of the Menoptra who fled the Animus underground. Ian and Vrestin convince the Optera to join them in fighting the Animus.\n\nAt the Crater of Needles, Barbara and Hrostar escape and try to meet up with the spearhead to warn them, but the spearhead is massacred.\n\nAt the Carsinome, the Doctor works out that the Animus uses gold as a conductor to channel its mesmerising force. He counteracts this force to control one of the Zarbi. The Doctor and Vicki escape. They meet up with Barbara and the Menoptra and devise a plan to attack the Carsinome.\n\nThe Doctor and Vicki return to the Carsinome, where the Zarbi take them to the Animus, a great spider-like creature, which mesmerises them. Meanwhile, Barbara and the Menoptra launch their attack on the Carsinome from outside whilst Ian and Vrestin with the Optera reach the Animus from below. They eventually defeat the Animus with a bomb.\n\n==Production==\nThe story had the working title of ''The Webbed Planet''. Episode six was initially titled \"Centre of Terror\".

The serial involves the [[Time travel in fiction|time traveller]] the [[First Doctor]] ([[William Hartnell]]) and his travelling [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companions]] [[Ian Chesterton]] ([[William Russell (English actor)|William Russell]]), [[Barbara Wright (Doctor Who)|Barbara Wright]] ([[Jacqueline Hill]]), and [[Vicki (Doctor Who)|Vicki]] ([[Maureen O'Brien]]) allying themselves with the former inhabitants of the planet [[Vortis (Doctor Who)|Vortis]], the Menoptra, as they struggle to win back Vortis from the malignant Animus.\n\n==Plot==\n{{needsattention|project=Doctor Who|type=multiple|date=June 2017|\n{{long plot|date=June 2017|episodes}}\n}}\nAn unknown force pulls the [[TARDIS]] off course and forces it to land on an unknown planet. Whilst exploring with [[Ian Chesterton|Ian]], the [[First Doctor]] recognises the planet as [[Vortis (Doctor Who)|Vortis]]; however, the presence of several moons in the sky of the normally moonless planet puzzles him.\n\nInside the ship, an unknown force acting through [[Barbara Wright (Doctor Who)|Barbara]]'s gold bracelet draws her outside, leaving [[Vicki (Doctor Who)|Vicki]] alone. The TARDIS is then pulled by an unseen force across the planet's surface.\n\nIn her trance, Barbara walks into a trio of the butterfly-like Menoptra. They remove her bracelet, freeing her of the trance, then debate what to do with her. She escapes, but the Zarbi immediately capture her. Brainwashed through the use of a gold collar, the Zarbi use Barbara to find the Menoptra. The Zarbi take Barbara and the Menoptra called Hrostar to the Crater of Needles, where the Zarbi force them to gather vegetation and drop it into rivers of acid which feed the Animus.\n\nThe Zarbi capture the Doctor and Ian and take them to the Carsinome. There they find Vicki and the TARDIS. They also meet the Animus who forces the Doctor to help it track down the Menoptra invasion force. Ian escapes, whilst the Doctor and Vicki try to bide their time.\n[[File:Menoptra (28807516473).jpg|thumb|left|A Menoptra, on display at the Doctor Who Experience.]]\nIan meets with a Menoptra called Vrestin. He learns that the Menoptra were native to the planet Vortis along with the Zarbi, until a great evil force, the Animus, slowly and gradually took control of the planet through the Zarbi. By the time the Menoptra noticed the danger it was too late, and they had to flee the planet to one of the moons the Animus pulled into orbit around Vortis.\n\nBack in the Carsinome, the Doctor accidentally reveals that the Menoptra spearhead plans to land at a place near the Crater of Needles. The Animus uses this information to ambush them.\n\nThe Zarbi soon locate Ian and Vrestin, but they escape when they fall into a tunnel. Inside they meet the Optera, descendants of the Menoptra who fled the Animus underground. Ian and Vrestin convince the Optera to join them in fighting the Animus.\n\nAt the Crater of Needles, Barbara and Hrostar escape and try to meet up with the spearhead to warn them, but the spearhead is massacred.\n\nAt the Carsinome, the Doctor works out that the Animus uses gold as a conductor to channel its mesmerising force. He counteracts this force to control one of the Zarbi. The Doctor and Vicki escape. They meet up with Barbara and the Menoptra and devise a plan to attack the Carsinome.\n\nThe Doctor and Vicki return to the Carsinome, where the Zarbi take them to the Animus, a great spider-like creature, which mesmerises them. Meanwhile, Barbara and the Menoptra launch their attack on the Carsinome from outside whilst Ian and Vrestin with the Optera reach the Animus from below. They eventually defeat the Animus with a bomb.\n\n==Production==\nThe story had the working title of ''The Webbed Planet''. Episode six was initially titled \"Centre of Terror\".

To defy expectations, the film shows Cruz' failure to achieve what he really wants.
