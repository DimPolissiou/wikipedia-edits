The team competes at the [[NCAA Division I]] [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] level (formerly Division I-A) and represents the university as a member of [[Conference USA]] in the Eastern division. The program has 1 national championship ([[Football Championship Subdivision|FCS]]/I-AA), 13 conference championships (1 [[Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association|SIAA]], 9 [[Ohio Valley Conference|OVC]], 1 [[Gateway Football Conference|Gateway]], 2 [[Conference USA]]) and 3 FBS-level Bowl wins. The team's current head football coach is [[Tyson Helton]]. The Hilltoppers play their home games at [[Houchens Industries\u2013L. T. Smith Stadium]] in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]].\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early history (1908\u20131947) ===\n\n====L.T. Smith and World War I (1908\u20131921)====\nWestern Kentucky first fielded a football team in 1908 but did not start playing sanctioned games until the 1913 season. M.A. Leiper and Roy Manchester are the first noted coaches for WKU. The two men teamed up to coach the Hilltoppers for their inaugural season which solely consisted of a 20\u20130 win over Elizabethtown. J.L. Arthur then took over the program for three years from 1914 to 1916, coaching a total of 14 games, 6 of which were against [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|Eastern Kentucky]]. From 1917 to 1919 the Hilltoppers didn't compete in football from due to World War I. In 1920, L. T. Smith, whose name bears the Hilltoppers' home stadium, took the reins and coached the team for two seasons.\n\n====Edgar Diddle (1922\u20131928)====\nFrom 1922 to 1928, the Hilltoppers saw their first success as Coach [[Edgar Diddle|E.A. Diddle]] took over the football program for seven seasons leading them to four winning seasons while also coaching the [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|WKU Hilltoppers basketball team]]. Diddle, who was a dual-athlete himself, encouraged his players to participate in multiple sports so they could stay in shape. His last season as football coach the team claimed to be state champions.<ref name=\"Ruby\">{{cite book| last = Ruby| first = Earl| title = Red Towel Territory : A History of Athletics at Western Kentucky University| publisher = American National Bank and Trust Co.| year = 1979|}}</ref>  When he retired from coaching football in 1928, Diddle posted a record of 38\u201324\u20132. The Hilltoppers outscored opponents 171\u20137 in Diddle's final year of coaching the program.\n\n====Carl Anderson (1929\u20131937)====\nAfter Diddle left the football program to focus on coaching basketball, WKU football went through a series of instability in coaching but also a series of 9 winning seasons. In 1929, [[Carl Anderson (American football)|Carl \"Swede\" Anderson]] took over as head coach leading the Hilltoppers to a 7\u20133 record before leaving to take the head coach job over the [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State]] freshman football team. In 1930, James Elam led the Hilltoppers to a 16\u20135\u20131 record during his two seasons. Ernie Miller then took over in 1932 seasons going 7\u20131 during his lone season before Jesse Thomas took over for the 1933 season going 6\u20132. In 1934, Carl Anderson returned for a second stint with the Hilltoppers where he served as head coach through the 1937 season posting a 24\u20139\u20133 record with wins over EKU in all four seasons. The Hilltoppers were very successful in this era posting an outstanding a 60\u201320\u20134 record.\n\n====Gander Terry and World War II (1938\u20131947)====\nAfter Anderson left the hill once again, this time to be an assistant coach at [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]], the Hilltoppers selected \"[[Gander Terry]] to lead the program. In their four seasons under Terry, the Hilltoppers went 25\u20139\u20133 beating rivals [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|[Middle Tennessee]] and Eastern Kentucky in every game they played. Terry left the program after the 1941 season following a 4\u20135\u20131 record, the Hilltopper's first losing season since 1925. Arnold Winkenhofer took over in 1942 coaching the Toppers for one season before the program was stopped from 1943 to 1945 due to World War II. In 1946, Jesse Thomas returned to the Hill for his second stint as head coach. Thomas only stuck around WKU two more seasons with much less success than his first go around posting a 5\u201310\u20132 record.\n\n=== The Jimmy Feix era (1948\u20131988) ===\n\n====Jack Clayton (1948\u20131956)====\n[[Jack Clayton (American football)|Jack Clayton]] provided some much-needed stability to the WKU football program where he served as head coach for 9 seasons. In 1949, after losing the first two games to start the season, Clayton started a freshman quarterback by the name of [[Jimmy Feix]] winning 5 of the last 7 games that season. By 1952, with Feix now in his senior year, Clayton coached WKU to their first [[Ohio Valley Conference]] championship and the school's first bowl appearance, winning 34\u201319 over [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] in the [[Refrigerator Bowl]], finishing the season 9\u20131. Feix became the first WKU football athlete ever to earn All-America honors after posting the highest pass completion percentage in the nation (.612). Under Clayton, the Hilltoppers posted a record of 50\u201333\u20132 before he left to coach at [[Northwestern State Demons football|Northwestern Louisiana State College]], his alma mater.\n\n====Nick Denes (1957\u20131967)====\n[[Nick Denes]], who was also a [[WKU Hilltoppers baseball]] head coach and for who, [[Nick Denes Field]] is named, coached WKU football for 11 seasons. In his time on the Hill, Denes compiled a 57\u201339\u20137 record for a .587 winning percentage. In 1963, Denes led the Hilltoppers to their second bowl game victory, defeating Coast Guard 27\u20130 in the [[Tangerine Bowl (1947\u20131982)|Tangerine Bowl]], a season where the Hilltoppers went 10\u20130\u20131. Denes retired after the 1967 season following a 42\u201319 win over [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]].\n\n====Jimmy Feix and NCAA Division I-AA transition (1968\u20131983)====\nAfter serving under Nick Denes as an assistant coach for all 11 seasons, [[Jimmy Feix]] was promoted to head coach. In his 16 seasons at the helm, Feix compiled an impressive 105\u201356\u20136 record (.6488). His 14 teams that competed in the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] went 67\u201328\u20132 (.701) in conference play. The Hilltoppers won six Ohio Valley Conference championships between 1970 and 1980. Feix became the most successful and longest-tenured coach in Western Kentucky football history while leading the Hilltoppers in a transition from [[NCAA Division II]] to [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|NCAA Division I-AA]] (now FCS).\n\nIn 1973, the Hilltoppers went undefeated in the regular season before competing in the first-year NCAA Division II championship playoffs. They made it to the championship game against [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football|Louisiana Tech]] coming up just short and finishing the season 12\u20131. In 1975, the Hilltoppers made the playoff field again advancing to the title game for the second time, but once again having to settle for runner-up honors finishing their season with an 11\u20132 record.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/26709537/wku-coaching-legend-jimmy-feix-dies|title=WKU coaching legend Jimmy Feix dies|last=Lewis|first=John|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nFeix was named OVC Coach of the Year in 1973, 1978 and 1980 and remains the winningest football coach in WKU history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alumni.wku.edu/s/808/index.aspx?pgid=1777&gid=1|title=WKU Alumni Association \u2013 Mr. Jimmy Feix|website=alumni.wku.edu|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Feix coached 16 athletes who followed him on the list of WKU football All-Americans.\n\n====Dave Roberts (1983\u20131988)====\nFeix retired as head coach moving to work in Alumni Affairs for two years before taking over as Director of Athletics in 1986. In his vacancy, the Hilltoppers hired former [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]] assistant [[Dave Roberts (American football)|Dave Roberts]] to be the head coach with hopes of continuing what Feix started. Roberts struggled through his first three seasons posting a record 10\u201322\u20131 before turning things around. In 1987 and 1988 Roberts took the Hilltoppers to the [[NCAA Division I-AA playoffs]] coming up short to rival EKU both years. After the 1988 season, Roberts left Western Kentucky for the [[Louisiana\u2013Monroe Warhawks football|Northeast Louisiana]] head coaching job. Though going 16\u20138 in his last two season, Roberts left with a 26\u201330\u20131 record becoming the first Hilltopper coach to leave with a losing record in over 60 years.\n\n=== The Jack Harbaugh era and FBS transition (1989\u20132009) ===\n\n==== Jack Harbaugh (1989\u20132002) ====\n[[Jack Harbaugh]] served as the Hilltoppers head football coach for 14 seasons, compiling a 91\u201368 record, three 10+ win seasons, two conference championships (OVC 2000, Gateway 2002) and the 2002 [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA National Championship]]. Harbaugh took the Hilltopper football program from the depths of despair in the early 1990s to its best stretch since the legendary [[Jimmy Feix]] coached on the Hill.\n\nIn 1992, WKU was on the verge of losing its football program after a state-mandated $6.1 million budget cut. Harbaugh was notified of the plans to shut down the program just before spring practice was about to begin. Having already made up his mind that he was not going to quit, he talked with his players left them a choice: accept defeat and leave, or fight to stay. Now known as the 1992 \"Save the Program\" team, every player decided to stay, fight, and work to save WKU football. While Harbaugh and the team did their part, former WKU quarterback, coach and athletics director at the time, Jimmy Feix, started an emergency fundraising campaign writing letters and making calls to former WKU players, urging them to buy season tickets. All the efforts paid off and on April 30, 1992, the WKU Board of Regents voted to allow football to stay but with a reduced budget.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/wku-program-savers-re-unite-on-saturday/article_cb65a9f8-0395-11e2-9bca-001a4bcf6878.html|title=WKU 'Program Savers' re-unite on Saturday|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> The Hilltoppers finished the 1992 season with a losing record of 4\u20136. As the budget remained tight over the next few years WKU managed an 8-3 record in 1993 before having back-to-back losing seasons.\n\nNo one ever doubted Harbaugh's ability to coach but he clearly needed better players. In 1994, with unwavering faith in their father, both of his sons, [[Jim Harbaugh]] and [[John Harbaugh]], decided to help however they could. While still playing in the NFL, Jim joined the WKU football coaching staff as an NCAA-certified unpaid assistant which allowed him to recruit. John, on the other hand, was a coach at [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]] and could rely on his scouting services, deep contacts, and endless high school game footage to help out.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl--harbaugh-sons-used-unconventional-means-to-help-father-build-college-football-powerhouse-053413373.html|title=Harbaugh sons used unconventional means to help father build college football powerhouse|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Jim set out and started contacting recruits, his first being [[Willie Taggart]], an All-American and four-year starter at quarterback for WKU. Jim also recruited future NFL players [[Rod Smart]] and [[Mel Mitchell]] to WKU as well as 17 players on the 2002 national championship team.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/49ers/article/How-Jim-Harbaugh-saved-dad-s-program-4230790.php|title=How Jim Harbaugh saved dad's program|newspaper=SFGate|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nThe Hilltoppers went 7-4 in 1996 behind the arm and legs of quarterback Willie Taggart which started a long series of winning seasons. Jack and his wife Jackie are credited with saving the program which led to being honored in 2012 with naming rights to the stadium club at [[Houchens Industries\u2013L. T. Smith Stadium|L. T. Smith Stadium]]. This was 20 years after the 1992 \"Save the Program\" season and 10 years after the 2002 championship season.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/club-named-for-harbaugh/article_e11bf624-0397-11e2-9665-001a4bcf6878.html|title=Club named for Harbaugh|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\n====David Elson (2003\u20132009)====\nAfter serving on [[Jack Harbaugh|Harbaugh]]'s coaching staff seven seasons, [[David Elson]] was promoted to head coach where he led the Hilltoppers for seven seasons. Elson's first four seasons as head coach were at the [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA]] level (now FCS) where he picked up where Harbaugh left and posted four straight winning seasons, a record of 30\u201317, and two playoff berths. On Nov. 2nd, 2006, prior to the end of the season, WKU's Board of Regents voted in favor of moving from NCAA Division I-AA to [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|NCAA Division I-A]] football (now FBS) and would be joining the [[Sun Belt Conference]] in all sports by 2009. The move allowed WKU to add 22 scholarships by 2009 and increase the overall football budget by an estimated $2.5 million by the time the transition was complete.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wkusports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110206aaa.html|title=Board Of Regents Votes To Elevate Western Kentucky Football To Division I-A Status|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the Hilltoppers began the transition to NCAA Division I FBS as Independents, considered a reclassifying school for both the 2007 and 2008 seasons due to NCAA rules. The Hilltoppers were not eligible to participate in a Sun Belt Conference Championship or a berth in a bowl game until the 2009 season. Knowing it wasn't going to be easy, and without the motivation of being eligible to compete for a championship, Elson and the Hilltoppers set two team goals that season; to win seven games and to go undefeated at home. Both goals required at least one win over an FBS team. If the Hilltoppers won seven games, they got rings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=2647510|title=Moving up? Western Kentucky approves upgrade to I-A|date=2006-11-03|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> They were able to accomplish the first of those goals, going 7\u20135 that season as they beat long-time rival [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|MTSU]] in Murfreesboro, but were unable to hold off [[Troy Trojans football|Troy]] at home; both of which were FBS schools and members of the Sun Belt Conference.\n\nThat win over MTSU in 2007 would be the last major win for the Hilltoppers under Elson. The 2008 season shed a truer light to the transition as the Hilltoppers went 2\u201310 with no wins over FBS opponents, only beating their two other long-time rivals and FCS-level opponents [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|EKU]] and [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]]. Things only got worse for the Hilltoppers in 2009 after they finally became full members of the Sun Belt Conference. WKU lost every game that season, going 0\u201312, posting their worst record in school history. Elson was hopeful to survive the transition as he asked for patience in building the program, but on Nov. 9th, 2009, prior to the end of the season, athletic director, Wood Selig had enough and fired Elson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=4637342|title=Western Kentucky fires coach amid 0-9 season|date=2009-11-09|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> The Hilltoppers went 39\u201344 under Elson, going 9\u201327 in his final three seasons (1\u201326 against FBS opponents).\n\n=== The FBS era (2010\u2013present) ===\n\n====Willie Taggart (2010\u20132012)====\nWKU Quarterback Legend, [[Willie Taggart]], returned to his alma mater as head football coach in 2010 after leaving his position as [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] running backs coach, where he served under [[Jack Harbaugh]]'s son [[Jim Harbaugh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/sunbelt/2009-11-23-western-kentucky-taggart_N.htm|title=Western Kentucky hires Stanford assistant Willie Taggart as coach \u2013 USATODAY.com|work=usatoday.com}}</ref> In their first year under Taggart, coming off a winless season under Elson, WKU finally broke their 26-game losing streak with a 54\u201321 win at [[Louisiana-Lafayette]]. The Hilltoppers finished 2\u201310 that season. From there, Taggart is credited with getting WKU's football program back on track after posting back to back 7\u20135 regular seasons that included an upset of [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]] in Lexington in 2012. That was Western Kentucky's first win over a [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] opponent in program history. Despite the surprising 7\u20135 record in 2011, a season in which the Hilltoppers went 7\u20131 in their final eight games, they were not invited to a bowl game. It wasn't until the following year, 2012, that the Hilltoppers were invited to their first FBS-level bowl game, the [[Little Caesars Pizza Bowl|Little Caesar's Bowl]].\n\nOn December 7, 2012, prior to their December 26th bowl game, Taggart left WKU to accept the head football coach position at [[South Florida Bulls football|South Florida]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gousfbulls.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=7700&ATCLID=205822229|title=Welcome Home Willie Taggart|work=GoUSFBulls.com}}</ref> [[Lance Guidry]], WKU's defensive coordinator was named interim head coach and led the Hilltoppers to their first bowl appearance as an FBS member.

The team competes at the [[NCAA Division I]] [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] level (formerly Division I-A) and represents the university as a member of [[Conference USA]] in the Eastern division. The program has 1 national championship ([[Football Championship Subdivision|FCS]]/I-AA), 13 conference championships (1 [[Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association|SIAA]], 9 [[Ohio Valley Conference|OVC]], 1 [[Gateway Football Conference|Gateway]], 2 [[Conference USA]]) and 3 FBS-level Bowl wins. The team's current head football coach is [[Tyson Helton]]. The Hilltoppers play their home games at [[Houchens Industries\u2013L. T. Smith Stadium]] in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]].\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early history (1908\u20131947) ===\n\n====L.T. Smith and World War I (1908\u20131921)====\nWestern Kentucky first fielded a football team in 1908 but did not start playing sanctioned games until the 1913 season. M.A. Leiper and Roy Manchester are the first noted coaches for WKU. The two men teamed up to coach the Hilltoppers for their inaugural season which solely consisted of a 20\u20130 win over Elizabethtown. J.L. Arthur then took over the program for three years from 1914 to 1916, coaching a total of 14 games, 6 of which were against [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|Eastern Kentucky]]. From 1917 to 1919 the Hilltoppers didn't compete in football from due to World War I. In 1920, L. T. Smith, whose name bears the Hilltoppers' home stadium, took the reins and coached the team for two seasons.\n\n====Edgar Diddle (1922\u20131928)====\nFrom 1922 to 1928, the Hilltoppers saw their first success as Coach [[Edgar Diddle|E.A. Diddle]] took over the football program for seven seasons leading them to four winning seasons while also coaching the [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|WKU Hilltoppers basketball team]]. Diddle, who was a dual-athlete himself, encouraged his players to participate in multiple sports so they could stay in shape. His last season as football coach the team claimed to be state champions.<ref name=\"Ruby\">{{cite book| last = Ruby| first = Earl| title = Red Towel Territory : A History of Athletics at Western Kentucky University| publisher = American National Bank and Trust Co.| year = 1979|}}</ref>  When he retired from coaching football in 1928, Diddle posted a record of 38\u201324\u20132. The Hilltoppers outscored opponents 171\u20137 in Diddle's final year of coaching the program.\n\n====Carl Anderson (1929\u20131937)====\nAfter Diddle left the football program to focus on coaching basketball, WKU football went through a series of instability in coaching but also a series of 9 winning seasons. In 1929, [[Carl Anderson (American football)|Carl \"Swede\" Anderson]] took over as head coach leading the Hilltoppers to a 7\u20133 record before leaving to take the head coach job over the [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State]] freshman football team. In 1930, James Elam led the Hilltoppers to a 16\u20135\u20131 record during his two seasons. Ernie Miller then took over in 1932 seasons going 7\u20131 during his lone season before Jesse Thomas took over for the 1933 season going 6\u20132. In 1934, Carl Anderson returned for a second stint with the Hilltoppers where he served as head coach through the 1937 season posting a 24\u20139\u20133 record with wins over EKU in all four seasons. The Hilltoppers were very successful in this era posting an outstanding a 60\u201320\u20134 record.\n\n====Gander Terry and World War II (1938\u20131947)====\nAfter Anderson left the hill once again, this time to be an assistant coach at [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]], the Hilltoppers selected \"[[Gander Terry]] to lead the program. In their four seasons under Terry, the Hilltoppers went 25\u20139\u20133 beating rivals [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|[Middle Tennessee]] and Eastern Kentucky in every game they played. Terry left the program after the 1941 season following a 4\u20135\u20131 record, the Hilltopper's first losing season since 1925. Arnold Winkenhofer took over in 1942 coaching the Toppers for one season before the program was stopped from 1943 to 1945 due to World War II. In 1946, Jesse Thomas returned to the Hill for his second stint as head coach. Thomas only stuck around WKU two more seasons with much less success than his first go around posting a 5\u201310\u20132 record.\n\n=== The Jimmy Feix era (1948\u20131988) ===\n\n====Jack Clayton (1948\u20131956)====\n[[Jack Clayton (American football)|Jack Clayton]] provided some much-needed stability to the WKU football program where he served as head coach for 9 seasons. In 1949, after losing the first two games to start the season, Clayton started a freshman quarterback by the name of [[Jimmy Feix]] winning 5 of the last 7 games that season. By 1952, with Feix now in his senior year, Clayton coached WKU to their first [[Ohio Valley Conference]] championship and the school's first bowl appearance, winning 34\u201319 over [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] in the [[Refrigerator Bowl]], finishing the season 9\u20131. Feix became the first WKU football athlete ever to earn All-America honors after posting the highest pass completion percentage in the nation (.612). Under Clayton, the Hilltoppers posted a record of 50\u201333\u20132 before he left to coach at [[Northwestern State Demons football|Northwestern Louisiana State College]], his alma mater.\n\n====Nick Denes (1957\u20131967)====\n[[Nick Denes]], who was also a [[WKU Hilltoppers baseball]] head coach and for who, [[Nick Denes Field]] is named, coached WKU football for 11 seasons. In his time on the Hill, Denes compiled a 57\u201339\u20137 record for a .587 winning percentage. In 1963, Denes led the Hilltoppers to their second bowl game victory, defeating Coast Guard 27\u20130 in the [[Tangerine Bowl (1947\u20131982)|Tangerine Bowl]], a season where the Hilltoppers went 10\u20130\u20131. Denes retired after the 1967 season following a 42\u201319 win over [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]].\n\n====Jimmy Feix and NCAA Division I-AA transition (1968\u20131983)====\nAfter serving under Nick Denes as an assistant coach for all 11 seasons, [[Jimmy Feix]] was promoted to head coach. In his 16 seasons at the helm, Feix compiled an impressive 105\u201356\u20136 record (.6488). His 14 teams that competed in the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] went 67\u201328\u20132 (.701) in conference play. The Hilltoppers won six Ohio Valley Conference championships between 1970 and 1980. Feix became the most successful and longest-tenured coach in Western Kentucky football history while leading the Hilltoppers in a transition from [[NCAA Division II]] to [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|NCAA Division I-AA]] (now FCS).\n\nIn 1973, the Hilltoppers went undefeated in the regular season before competing in the first-year NCAA Division II championship playoffs. They made it to the championship game against [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football|Louisiana Tech]] coming up just short and finishing the season 12\u20131. In 1975, the Hilltoppers made the playoff field again advancing to the title game for the second time, but once again having to settle for runner-up honors finishing their season with an 11\u20132 record.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/26709537/wku-coaching-legend-jimmy-feix-dies|title=WKU coaching legend Jimmy Feix dies|last=Lewis|first=John|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nFeix was named OVC Coach of the Year in 1973, 1978 and 1980 and remains the winningest football coach in WKU history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alumni.wku.edu/s/808/index.aspx?pgid=1777&gid=1|title=WKU Alumni Association \u2013 Mr. Jimmy Feix|website=alumni.wku.edu|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Feix coached 16 athletes who followed him on the list of WKU football All-Americans.\n\n====Dave Roberts (1983\u20131988)====\nFeix retired as head coach moving to work in Alumni Affairs for two years before taking over as Director of Athletics in 1986. In his vacancy, the Hilltoppers hired former [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]] assistant [[Dave Roberts (American football)|Dave Roberts]] to be the head coach with hopes of continuing what Feix started. Roberts struggled through his first three seasons posting a record 10\u201322\u20131 before turning things around. In 1987 and 1988 Roberts took the Hilltoppers to the [[NCAA Division I-AA playoffs]] coming up short to rival EKU both years. After the 1988 season, Roberts left Western Kentucky for the [[Louisiana\u2013Monroe Warhawks football|Northeast Louisiana]] head coaching job. Though going 16\u20138 in his last two season, Roberts left with a 26\u201330\u20131 record becoming the first Hilltopper coach to leave with a losing record in over 60 years.\n\n=== The Jack Harbaugh era and FBS transition (1989\u20132009) ===\n\n==== Jack Harbaugh (1989\u20132002) ====\n[[Jack Harbaugh]] served as the Hilltoppers head football coach for 14 seasons, compiling a 91\u201368 record, three 10+ win seasons, two conference championships (OVC 2000, Gateway 2002) and the 2002 [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA National Championship]]. Harbaugh took the Hilltopper football program from the depths of despair in the early 1990s to its best stretch since the legendary [[Jimmy Feix]] coached on the Hill.\n\nIn 1992, WKU was on the verge of losing its football program after a state-mandated $6.1 million budget cut. Harbaugh was notified of the plans to shut down the program just before spring practice was about to begin. Having already made up his mind that he was not going to quit, he talked with his players left them a choice: accept defeat and leave, or fight to stay. Now known as the 1992 \"Save the Program\" team, every player decided to stay, fight, and work to save WKU football. While Harbaugh and the team did their part, former WKU quarterback, coach and athletics director at the time, Jimmy Feix, started an emergency fundraising campaign writing letters and making calls to former WKU players, urging them to buy season tickets. All the efforts paid off and on April 30, 1992, the WKU Board of Regents voted to allow football to stay but with a reduced budget.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/wku-program-savers-re-unite-on-saturday/article_cb65a9f8-0395-11e2-9bca-001a4bcf6878.html|title=WKU 'Program Savers' re-unite on Saturday|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> The Hilltoppers finished the 1992 season with a losing record of 4\u20136. As the budget remained tight over the next few years WKU managed an 8-3 record in 1993 before having back-to-back losing seasons.\n\nNo one ever doubted Harbaugh's ability to coach but he clearly needed better players. In 1994, with unwavering faith in their father, both of his sons, [[Jim Harbaugh]] and [[John Harbaugh]], decided to help however they could. While still playing in the NFL, Jim joined the WKU football coaching staff as an NCAA-certified unpaid assistant which allowed him to recruit. John, on the other hand, was a coach at [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]] and could rely on his scouting services, deep contacts, and endless high school game footage to help out.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl--harbaugh-sons-used-unconventional-means-to-help-father-build-college-football-powerhouse-053413373.html|title=Harbaugh sons used unconventional means to help father build college football powerhouse|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Jim set out and started contacting recruits, his first being [[Willie Taggart]], an All-American and four-year starter at quarterback for WKU. Jim also recruited future NFL players [[Rod Smart]] and [[Mel Mitchell]] to WKU as well as 17 players on the 2002 national championship team.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/49ers/article/How-Jim-Harbaugh-saved-dad-s-program-4230790.php|title=How Jim Harbaugh saved dad's program|newspaper=SFGate|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nThe Hilltoppers went 7-4 in 1996 behind the arm and legs of quarterback Willie Taggart which started a long series of winning seasons. Jack and his wife Jackie are credited with saving the program which led to being honored in 2012 with naming rights to the stadium club at [[Houchens Industries\u2013L. T. Smith Stadium|L. T.

Elson's first four seasons as head coach were at the [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA]] level (now FCS) where he picked up where Harbaugh left and posted four straight winning seasons, a record of 30\u201317, and two playoff berths. On Nov. 2nd, 2006, prior to the end of the season, WKU's Board of Regents voted in favor of moving from NCAA Division I-AA to [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|NCAA Division I-A]] football (now FBS) and would be joining the [[Sun Belt Conference]] in all sports by 2009. The move allowed WKU to add 22 scholarships by 2009 and increase the overall football budget by an estimated $2.5 million by the time the transition was complete.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wkusports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110206aaa.html|title=Board Of Regents Votes To Elevate Western Kentucky Football To Division I-A Status|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the Hilltoppers began the transition to NCAA Division I FBS as Independents, considered a reclassifying school for both the 2007 and 2008 seasons due to NCAA rules. The Hilltoppers were not eligible to participate in a Sun Belt Conference Championship or a berth in a bowl game until the 2009 season. Knowing it wasn't going to be easy, and without the motivation of being eligible to compete for a championship, Elson and the Hilltoppers set two team goals that season; to win seven games and to go undefeated at home. Both goals required at least one win over an FBS team. If the Hilltoppers won seven games, they got rings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=2647510|title=Moving up? Western Kentucky approves upgrade to I-A|date=2006-11-03|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> They were able to accomplish the first of those goals, going 7\u20135 that season as they beat long-time rival [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|MTSU]] in Murfreesboro, but were unable to hold off [[Troy Trojans football|Troy]] at home; both of which were FBS schools and members of the Sun Belt Conference.\n\nThat win over MTSU in 2007 would be the last major win for the Hilltoppers under Elson. The 2008 season shed a truer light to the transition as the Hilltoppers went 2\u201310 with no wins over FBS opponents, only beating their two other long-time rivals and FCS-level opponents [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|EKU]] and [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]]. Things only got worse for the Hilltoppers in 2009 after they finally became full members of the Sun Belt Conference. WKU lost every game that season, going 0\u201312, posting their worst record in school history. Elson was hopeful to survive the transition as he asked for patience in building the program, but on Nov. 9th, 2009, prior to the end of the season, athletic director, Wood Selig had enough and fired Elson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=4637342|title=Western Kentucky fires coach amid 0-9 season|date=2009-11-09|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> The Hilltoppers went 39\u201344 under Elson, going 9\u201327 in his final three seasons (1\u201326 against FBS opponents).\n\n=== The FBS era (2010\u2013present) ===\n\n====Willie Taggart (2010\u20132012)====\nWKU Quarterback Legend, [[Willie Taggart]], returned to his alma mater as head football coach in 2010 after leaving his position as [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] running backs coach, where he served under [[Jack Harbaugh]]'s son [[Jim Harbaugh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/sunbelt/2009-11-23-western-kentucky-taggart_N.htm|title=Western Kentucky hires Stanford assistant Willie Taggart as coach \u2013 USATODAY.com|work=usatoday.com}}</ref> In their first year under Taggart, coming off a winless season under Elson, WKU finally broke their 26-game losing streak with a 54\u201321 win at [[Louisiana-Lafayette]]. The Hilltoppers finished 2\u201310 that season. From there, Taggart is credited with getting WKU's football program back on track after posting back to back 7\u20135 regular seasons that included an upset of [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]] in Lexington in 2012. That was Western Kentucky's first win over a [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] opponent in program history. Despite the surprising 7\u20135 record in 2011, a season in which the Hilltoppers went 7\u20131 in their final eight games, they were not invited to a bowl game. It wasn't until the following year, 2012, that the Hilltoppers were invited to their first FBS-level bowl game, the [[Little Caesars Pizza Bowl|Little Caesar's Bowl]].\n\nOn December 7, 2012, prior to their December 26th bowl game, Taggart left WKU to accept the head football coach position at [[South Florida Bulls football|South Florida]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gousfbulls.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=7700&ATCLID=205822229|title=Welcome Home Willie Taggart|work=GoUSFBulls.com}}</ref> [[Lance Guidry]], WKU's defensive coordinator was named interim head coach and led the Hilltoppers to their first bowl appearance as an FBS member.

This is the reason why I joined a theatre group in Jaipur and even participated in two plays staged at [[Jawahar Kala Kendra]] and Ravindra Manch. One day, I got a call from a casting director who was looking for fresh faces for [[Angrezi Medium]]. I was handed a script and asked to mouth a few dialogues. At that point in time, I didn\u2019t know that I was auditioning for the character of Irrfan\u2019s wife. It was only two weeks after the audition that I got a call saying that I have been chosen for the role. I was thrilled and so was my family.\u201d'' <ref>{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/from-food-blogger-to-actress-in-irrfans-film-jaipurs-poorvi-jain-to-make-her-bollywood-debut-with-angrezi-medium/articleshow/69702489.cms|title=From food blogger to actress in Irrfan's film, Jaipur's Poorvi Jain to make her Bollywood debut with Angrezi Medium|publisher=The Times of India}}</ref>\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n!scope=col |Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Role\n! scope=\"col\" | Language \n|-     \n| 2020 \n!scope=\"row\"|''[[Angrezi Medium]]''\n| Rashi Goswami, Champak's Wife\n| [[Hindi cinema|Hindi Film]]\n|-\n \n|}\n\n==Television==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n!scope=col |Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Channel\n|-     \n| 2020 \n!scope=\"row\"|''Love Yourself''\n| [[Zing TV]]\n|-\n \n\n\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb name|nm10285114}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Indian television actresses]]\n[[Category:Indian film actresses]]\n[[Category:Actresses in Hindi cinema]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1996 births]]\n[[Category:21st-century Indian actresses]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jain, Poorvi}}\n", "name_user": "119.160.116.142", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Kindly take a look at this article once again, this article clearly FailsWP:NACTORSandWP:ENTERTAINER, only has one projectAngrezi Medliumin her list that too is not her leading role.

The competition features many of the current stars of the game and is sometimes known as the \u2018Olympics of Camogie\u2019 because of the disproportionate number of [[Camogie All Stars Awards|All Star]] and [[All-Ireland Senior Camogie Championship|All-Ireland]] elite level players who participate each year<ref>[http://kilkennycamogie.com/index.php?page=ashToWater Michael O\u2019Leary:Ashbourne comes to Waterford]</ref> Since 1972 it has been administered by the [http://www.ccao.ie Higher Education] committee of the [[Camogie Association]].\n\nThe next Ashbourne Cup will take place over the weekend of 10-11 February 2020.\n\n==Format==\nIn the final stages of the competition, six teams are divided into two groups of three in which each team plays two matches. The top two in each group go through to the cup semi finals while the bottom team in each group plays in the final of the Ashbourne Shield. The current holders of the cup are [[Waterford IT|Waterford Institute of Technology]] having [[2011 Ashbourne Cup|defeated UCC 2-10 to 2-2 in the 2011 final]].<ref name=\"camogie1\">2011 final WIT 2-10 UCC 2-2, reports in [http://www.camogie.ie/Home/tabid/54/mid/411/newsid412/1542/Weekend-results-/Default.aspx Camogie.ie] and [http://www.independent.ie/sport/hurling/parrock-seals-wit-treble-2548906.html Irish Independent]</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe competition is the brainchild of [[Agnes O'Farrelly]] (1874\u20131951), founder member (1914) and president (1914\u201351) of the UCD camogie club who later served as president of the Camogie Association of Ireland in 1941\u20132. In 1915 she persuaded her friend, Irish language activist [[William Gibson, 2nd Baron Ashbourne|William Gibson]], aka Liam Mac Giolla Bhr\u00edde (1868\u20131942), second Lord Ashbourne, to donate a trophy for the camogie intervarsity competition. The first game of intercollegiate camogie took place between [[University College Dublin]] and [[University College Cork]] on 18 April 1915. [[NUI Galway]] (then University College, Galway) joined the competition in 1916, [[Queen's University, Belfast]] in 1934, and [[National University of Ireland, Maynooth|NUI Maynooth]] (then St Patrick's College), [[New University of Ulster]], Coleraine, and [[Dublin University|Trinity College]], Dublin in 1972. Apart from 1934-7, until 1960 the competition was played on a league basis, and since then the concluding stages have been played together on a single weekend in mid-February. There was no competition in 1943, due to war-time restrictions, and the competition remained unfinished in 1963, when University College Dublin fielded an ineligible player for the final, which was drawn and never replayed. University College Cork claimed the title. Since 2010 the finals weekend has been staged alongside the Purcell Cup.\n\n==Purcell Cup==\nThe CCAO also oversees the Purcell Cup (effectively Division 2), which has been contested since 1977. The Purcell Cup, the third level colleges division 2 championship, was donated by [[\u00dana U\u00ed Phuirs\u00e9il]], President of the [[Camogie Association]] 1976-78, and her husband [[\u00dana U\u00ed Phuirs\u00e9il#P\u00e1draig Puirs\u00e9il|P\u00e1draig Puirs\u00e9il]], Gaelic games correspondent for the [[Irish Press]] 1954-78. [[Mary Immaculate College, Limerick]] defeated [[University of Ulster|Ulster Polytechnic]] by 3-0 to 0-1 in the first final in [[St Patrick's College, Dublin|St Patrick's. Drumcondra]] on 6 March 1977. The format is similar to the Ashbourne Cup, in the final stages of the competition, six teams are divided into two groups of three in which each team plays two matches. The top two in each group goes through to the cup semi finals while the bottom team in each group plays in the final of the Purcell Shield. The Purcell Cup winners play the Ashbourne Shield runners-up the following year to determine promotion and relegation. Having initially been established for non-university colleges in 1977, from 1994 the standard of the team rather than the type of university determined whether colleges should participate in the Ashbourne Cup or the Purcell Cup.\n\n==Fr Meachair Cup==\nColleges who do not compete in the Ashbourne and Purcell Cups play for a cup named after Fr Gear\u00f3id \u00d3 Meachair (Gerry Meagher, d1982), from [[Cappawhite]], Co Tipperary, founder and popular trainer of the [[NUI Maynooth]] camogie team. It was inaugurated in 1986.  Until [[2011 Ashbourne Cup|2011]] it was a one-day seven-a-side competition. The format is similar to the Ashbourne and Purcell Cups, six teams divided into two groups of three in which each team plays two matches. The top two in each group goes through to the cup semi finals while the bottom team in each group plays in the final of the Fr Meachair Shield. The Fr Meachair Cup winners play the Purcell Shield runners-up the following year to determine promotion and relegation.\n\n==O'Mhaolag\u00e1in Cup==\nThe remaining teams not in the first three championships participate in a one-day seven-a-side competition, a format previously used for the Fr Meachair Cup. The trophy is named for [[Camogie Association]] President of 1991-4, [[Br\u00edd\u00edn U\u00ed Mhaolag\u00e1in]]. The revived O'Mhaolag\u00e1in Cup was staged in [[Dundalk IT]] on 22 February 2012.<ref>[http://www.ccao.ie/index.php/fixtures/championship-fixtures/omhaolagain-cup CCAO IE: O'Mhaolag\u00e1in Cup]</ref>\n\n==\u00d3 Mhaolag\u00e1in cup==\n[[Dundalk IT]] won the reinvented \u00d3 Mhaolag\u00e1in cup in 2012<ref>[http://www.ccao.ie/index.php/latest-news/135-dkit-take-omhaolagain-cup \u00d3 Mhaolag\u00e1in cup on CCAO.ie]</ref>\n[[Froebel College of Education|Col\u00e1iste Froebel]], [[Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology]], [[Limerick IT]], [[Marino College of Further Education|Marino]], and [[University of Ulster at Coleraine|University of Ulster Coleraine]] who won the inaugural O\u2019Mhaolag\u00e1in Shield, all competed in the 2012 competition.

The match was drawn 2-1 each and never replayed, with UCC claiming victory.\n* The 1962 competition when snow was cleared from the field, the semi-finals played on the following day and the final completed a fortnight later when Anne Duane\u2019s late goal gave Dublin a late victory in one of the best Ashbourne cup ties of the 12-a-side era.\n* Galway\u2019s breakthrough in 1965 powered by goalkeeper [[Eileen Naughton]] who held Queen\u2019s scoreless in the semi-final and Dublin could manage just one point in the final,\n* The 1966 semi-final in which Dublin beat Queen\u2019s by an astonishing 17-6 to nil, as [[Ann Carroll]] inspired Dublin to victory in her first appearance in a competition where she was to become the outstanding personality over a five-year period.\n* The 1969 semi-finals played in four inches of snow on the Malone Road sports fields in Belfast. The final was eventually played in Athlone when Dublin won with the help of three goals from Joan Traynor.\n* In 1972 Trinity College, NUI Maynooth and the University of Ulster, Coleraine brought the number of teams competing in the Ashbourne Cup to seven\n* Margery Doohan\u2019s performance in the 1970 final, her five goals won her [[Irish Press]] sports personality of the week in a year when UCD won without their injured captain [[Ann Carroll]]\n* Cork\u2019s six in a row 1972-77 with players like Val O'Dwyer and Aideen McCarthy and three goal hero of 1977 Noreen McCarthy, their toughest contest in the period may have been the 1976 quarter-final 2-6 to 3-2 victory over Maynooth, one of the best matches in the 12-a-side era of Ashbourne history, in which [[Angela Downey]] scored 2-2. Maynooth came closest to winning the Fitzgibbon when it could draw on the services of the iconic [[Angela Downey]] between 1975 and 1979, appearing in two finals.\n* The 1974 first round match between UCG and Queen\u2019s played in perhaps the worst conditions ever for a camogie match - the ball became lodged in a mud pool for a considerable period\n* Dublin\u2019s nine victories in eleven years in the 1980s, launched by Edel Murphy\u2019s scores in a closely fought final against UCC in 1980 and  spearheaded by players such as Germaine Noonan, Marie Connell and Breda Kenny in subsequent years.\n* Cork\u2019s eight goals in arctic conditions at Santry in 1985, decisively defeating [[UCD GAA|UCD]] with great displays by [[Claire Cronin (camogie player)|Claire Cronin]], Patsy Kenelry and three goal hero Norma Delaney.\n* The emergence of Queens in 1991 led by Deirdre O'Doherty, Joan Tobin and Mary Black followed closely by [[University of Ulster|Jordanstown]] in 1992 marking the high point of Colleges camogie in Ulster, followed by Limerick\u2019s victory over Waterford in an all-newcomers final in 1995 when [[Sinead Millea]]\u2019s prolific scoring gave Limerick victory.\n*  Limerick\u2019s breakthrough in 1995 which led to six titles in 11 years including a treble in 2004-6\n* The first 15-a-side final of a major camogie competition in 1999 when Waterford celebrated their first success and the first non-University success thanks to Mary Walshe\u2019s 39th minute winning goal.\n*  Waterford\u2019s 2009-13 five in a row, powered by All Ireland stars from Cork and

The competition features many of the current stars of the game and is sometimes known as the \u2018Olympics of Camogie\u2019 because of the disproportionate number of [[Camogie All Stars Awards|All Star]] and [[All-Ireland Senior Camogie Championship|All-Ireland]] elite level players who participate each year<ref>[http://kilkennycamogie.com/index.php?page=ashToWater Michael O\u2019Leary:Ashbourne comes to Waterford]</ref> Since 1972 it has been administered by the [http://www.ccao.ie Higher Education] committee of the [[Camogie Association]].\n\nThe next Ashbourne Cup will take place over the weekend of 10-11 February 2020.\n\n==Format==\nIn the final stages of the competition, six teams are divided into two groups of three in which each team plays two matches. The top two in each group go through to the cup semi finals while the bottom team in each group plays in the final of the Ashbourne Shield. The current holders of the cup are [[Waterford IT|Waterford Institute of Technology]] having [[2011 Ashbourne Cup|defeated UCC 2-10 to 2-2 in the 2011 final]].<ref name=\"camogie1\">2011 final WIT 2-10 UCC 2-2, reports in [http://www.camogie.ie/Home/tabid/54/mid/411/newsid412/1542/Weekend-results-/Default.aspx Camogie.ie] and [http://www.independent.ie/sport/hurling/parrock-seals-wit-treble-2548906.html Irish Independent]</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe competition is the brainchild of [[Agnes O'Farrelly]] (1874\u20131951), founder member (1914) and president (1914\u201351) of the UCD camogie club who later served as president of the Camogie Association of Ireland in 1941\u20132. In 1915 she persuaded her friend, Irish language activist [[William Gibson, 2nd Baron Ashbourne|William Gibson]], aka Liam Mac Giolla Bhr\u00edde (1868\u20131942), second Lord Ashbourne, to donate a trophy for the camogie intervarsity competition. The first game of intercollegiate camogie took place between [[University College Dublin]] and [[University College Cork]] on 18 April 1915. [[NUI Galway]] (then University College, Galway) joined the competition in 1916, [[Queen's University, Belfast]] in 1934, and [[National University of Ireland, Maynooth|NUI Maynooth]] (then St Patrick's College), [[New University of Ulster]], Coleraine, and [[Dublin University|Trinity College]], Dublin in 1972. Apart from 1934-7, until 1960 the competition was played on a league basis, and since then the concluding stages have been played together on a single weekend in mid-February. There was no competition in 1943, due to war-time restrictions, and the competition remained unfinished in 1963, when University College Dublin fielded an ineligible player for the final, which was drawn and never replayed. University College Cork claimed the title. Since 2010 the finals weekend has been staged alongside the Purcell Cup.\n\n==Purcell Cup==\nThe CCAO also oversees the Purcell Cup (effectively Division 2), which has been contested since 1977. The Purcell Cup, the third level colleges division 2 championship, was donated by [[\u00dana U\u00ed Phuirs\u00e9il]], President of the [[Camogie Association]] 1976-78, and her husband [[\u00dana U\u00ed Phuirs\u00e9il#P\u00e1draig Puirs\u00e9il|P\u00e1draig Puirs\u00e9il]], Gaelic games correspondent for the [[Irish Press]] 1954-78. [[Mary Immaculate College, Limerick]] defeated [[University of Ulster|Ulster Polytechnic]] by 3-0 to 0-1 in the first final in [[St Patrick's College, Dublin|St Patrick's. Drumcondra]] on 6 March 1977. The format is similar to the Ashbourne Cup, in the final stages of the competition, six teams are divided into two groups of three in which each team plays two matches. The top two in each group goes through to the cup semi finals while the bottom team in each group plays in the final of the Purcell Shield. The Purcell Cup winners play the Ashbourne Shield runners-up the following year to determine promotion and relegation. Having initially been established for non-university colleges in 1977, from 1994 the standard of the team rather than the type of university determined whether colleges should participate in the Ashbourne Cup or the Purcell Cup.\n\n==Fr Meachair Cup==\nColleges who do not compete in the Ashbourne and Purcell Cups play for a cup named after Fr Gear\u00f3id \u00d3 Meachair (Gerry Meagher, d1982), from [[Cappawhite]], Co Tipperary, founder and popular trainer of the [[NUI Maynooth]] camogie team. It was inaugurated in 1986.  Until [[2011 Ashbourne Cup|2011]] it was a one-day seven-a-side competition. The format is similar to the Ashbourne and Purcell Cups, six teams divided into two groups of three in which each team plays two matches. The top two in each group goes through to the cup semi finals while the bottom team in each group plays in the final of the Fr Meachair Shield. The Fr Meachair Cup winners play the Purcell Shield runners-up the following year to determine promotion and relegation.\n\n==O'Mhaolag\u00e1in Cup==\nThe remaining teams not in the first three championships participate in a one-day seven-a-side competition, a format previously used for the Fr Meachair Cup. The trophy is named for [[Camogie Association]] President of 1991-4, [[Br\u00edd\u00edn U\u00ed Mhaolag\u00e1in]]. The revived O'Mhaolag\u00e1in Cup was staged in [[Dundalk IT]] on 22 February 2012.<ref>[http://www.ccao.ie/index.php/fixtures/championship-fixtures/omhaolagain-cup CCAO IE: O'Mhaolag\u00e1in Cup]</ref>\n\n==\u00d3 Mhaolag\u00e1in cup==\n[[Dundalk IT]] won the reinvented \u00d3 Mhaolag\u00e1in cup in 2012<ref>[http://www.ccao.ie/index.php/latest-news/135-dkit-take-omhaolagain-cup \u00d3 Mhaolag\u00e1in cup on CCAO.ie]</ref>\n[[Froebel College of Education|Col\u00e1iste Froebel]], [[Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology]], [[Limerick IT]], [[Marino College of Further Education|Marino]], and [[University of Ulster at Coleraine|University of Ulster Coleraine]] who won the inaugural O\u2019Mhaolag\u00e1in Shield, all competed in the 2012 competition.

The match was drawn 2-1 each and never replayed, with UCC claiming victory.\n* The 1962 competition when snow was cleared from the field, the semi-finals played on the following day and the final completed a fortnight later when Anne Duane\u2019s late goal gave Dublin a late victory in one of the best Ashbourne cup ties of the 12-a-side era.\n* Galway\u2019s breakthrough in 1965 powered by goalkeeper [[Eileen Naughton]] who held Queen\u2019s scoreless in the semi-final and Dublin could manage just one point in the final,\n* The 1966 semi-final in which Dublin beat Queen\u2019s by an astonishing 17-6 to nil, as [[Ann Carroll]] inspired Dublin to victory in her first appearance in a competition where she was to become the outstanding personality over a five-year period.\n* The 1969 semi-finals played in four inches of snow on the Malone Road sports fields in Belfast. The final was eventually played in Athlone when Dublin won with the help of three goals from Joan Traynor.\n* In 1972 Trinity College, NUI Maynooth and the University of Ulster, Coleraine brought the number of teams competing in the Ashbourne Cup to seven\n* Margery Doohan\u2019s performance in the 1970 final, her five goals won her [[Irish Press]] sports personality of the week in a year when UCD won without their injured captain [[Ann Carroll]]\n* Cork\u2019s six in a row 1972-77 with players like Val O'Dwyer and Aideen McCarthy and three goal hero of 1977 Noreen McCarthy, their toughest contest in the period may have been the 1976 quarter-final 2-6 to 3-2 victory over Maynooth, one of the best matches in the 12-a-side era of Ashbourne history, in which [[Angela Downey]] scored 2-2. Maynooth came closest to winning the Fitzgibbon when it could draw on the services of the iconic [[Angela Downey]] between 1975 and 1979, appearing in two finals.\n* The 1974 first round match between UCG and Queen\u2019s played in perhaps the worst conditions ever for a camogie match - the ball became lodged in a mud pool for a considerable period\n* Dublin\u2019s nine victories in eleven years in the 1980s, launched by Edel Murphy\u2019s scores in a closely fought final against UCC in 1980 and  spearheaded by players such as Germaine Noonan, Marie Connell and Breda Kenny in subsequent years.\n* Cork\u2019s eight goals in arctic conditions at Santry in 1985, decisively defeating [[UCD GAA|UCD]] with great displays by [[Claire Cronin]], Patsy Kenelry and three goal hero Norma Delaney.\n* The emergence of Queens in 1991 led by Deirdre O'Doherty, Joan Tobin and Mary Black followed closely by [[University of Ulster|Jordanstown]] in 1992 marking the high point of Colleges camogie in Ulster, followed by Limerick\u2019s victory over Waterford in an all-newcomers final in 1995 when [[Sinead Millea]]\u2019s prolific scoring gave Limerick victory.\n*  Limerick\u2019s breakthrough in 1995 which led to six titles in 11 years including a treble in 2004-6\n* The first 15-a-side final of a major camogie competition in 1999 when Waterford celebrated their first success and the first non-University success thanks to Mary Walshe\u2019s 39th minute winning goal.\n*  Waterford\u2019s 2009-13 five in a row, powered by All Ireland stars from Cork and Wexford and Kilkenny, who supplied five of their forwards on the 2012 team\n\n==Ashbourne Cup Champion Colleges==\n{{Div col|colwidth=10em}}\n* 1915 [[University College Dublin|UCD]]\n* 1916 [[University College

Independent]] sports star of the week, selected by newspaper sports staff, was traditionally accorded to a camogie player once each year on the week of the All Ireland final. Annual C\u00fachulainn All Star awards were introduced as part of the first Gaelic Weekly All-star awards scheme, initiated by a group of sportswriters led by [[Mick Dunne]] and awarded on the same selectorial basis as the [[GAA All Stars Awards|Gaelic football and hurling all stars]] are today, though without a major sponsor. They were awarded to two camogie players in 1964-7, reduced to one in 1968-9. The camogie selectors for 1964 were [[Maeve Gilroy]], [[Kathleen Mills]] and [[Lil O'Grady]] and those of 1965 were [[Se\u00e1n O'Duffy#Personal Life|Kathleen O'Duffy]], [[S\u00edghle Nic an Ultaigh]] and Eithne Neville. In the 1970s the GAA Player of the month scheme, awarded one of its monthly awards, usually in November, to a camogie player. The scheme, initiated by sports journalist and historian [[David Guiney]] and also selected by sportswriters, became an effective player of the year award under three successive sponsors, B+I Line, Irish Nationwide and Eircell. The camogie player of the year was revived as part of the Powerscreen all star award scheme in and an official player of the year award was introduced in 2005.\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* 1963 [[\u00dana O'Connor]] ([[Dublin GAA#Camogie|Dublin]])\n* 1963 [[Deirdre Sutton]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])\n* 1964 [[Alice Hussey]] ([[Dublin GAA#Camogie|Dublin]])\n* 1964 [[Teresa Murphy]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])\n* 1965 (Joint) [[Mair\u00e9ad McAtamney]] ([[Antrim GAA#Camogie|Antrim]])\n* 1965 (Joint) [[Claire Hanrahan]] ([[Kilkenny GAA#Camogie|Kilkenny]])\n* 1966 (Joint) [[Mary Connery]] ([[Kilkenny GAA#Camogie|Kilkenny]])\n* 1966 (Joint) [[Maeve Gilroy]] ([[Antrim GAA#Camogie|Antrim]])\n* 1967 [[\u00dana O'Connor]] ([[Dublin GAA#Camogie|Dublin]])\n* 1968 [[Margaret O'Leary]] ([[Wexford GAA#Camogie|Wexford]])\n* 1973 [[Marie Costine]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])\n* 1974 [[Helena O'Neill]] ([[Kilkenny GAA#Camogie|Kilkenny]])\n* 1975 [[Bridget Doyle]] ([[Wexford GAA#Camogie|Wexford]])\n* 1976 [[Angela Downey]] ([[Kilkenny GAA#Camogie|Kilkenny]])\n* 1977 [[Bridie McGarry|Bridie Martin]] ([[Kilkenny GAA#Camogie|Kilkenny]])\n* 1978 [[Pat Moloney]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])\n* 1979 [[Mair\u00e9ad McAtamney]] ([[Antrim GAA#Camogie|Antrim]])\n* 1980 [[Marion McCarthy]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])\n* 1981 [[Liz Neary]] ([[Kilkenny GAA#Camogie|Kilkenny]])\n* 1982 [[Mary O'Leary (camogie)|Mary O'Leary]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])\n* 1983 [[Claire Cronin (camogie player)|Claire Cronin]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])\n* 1984 [[Yvonne Redmond]] ([[Dublin GAA#Camogie|Dublin]])\n* 1985 [[Angela Downey]] ([[Kilkenny GAA#Camogie|Kilkenny]])\n* 1986 [[Ann Downey|Ann]] & [[Angela Downey]] ([[Kilkenny GAA#Camogie|Kilkenny]])\n* 1987 [[Breda Holmes]] ([[Kilkenny GAA#Camogie|Kilkenny]])\n* 1988 [[Biddy O'Sullivan]] ([[Kilkenny GAA#Camogie|Kilkenny]])\n* 1989 [[Ann Downey|Ann]] & [[Angela Downey]] ([[Kilkenny GAA#Camogie|Kilkenny]])\n* 1991 [[Ann Downey]] ([[Kilkenny GAA#Camogie|Kilkenny]])\n* 1992 [[Sandie Fitzgibbon]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])\n* 1993 [[Linda Mellerick]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])\n* 1995 [[Sandie Fitzgibbon]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])\n* 1998 [[Linda Mellerick]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])\n* 1999 [[Deirdre Hughes]] ([[Tipperary GAA#Camogie|Tipperary]])\n* 2000 [[Jovita Delaney]] ([[Tipperary GAA#Camogie|Tipperary]])<ref>Eircell award report in [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2000/1122/00112200167.html Irish Times] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021174741/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2000/1122/00112200167.html |date=October 21, 2012 }}</ref>\n* 2001 [[Ciara Gaynor]] ([[Tipperary GAA#Camogie|Tipperary]])<ref>Eircell award report in [https://archive.is/20120906130541/http://www.independent.ie/sport/hurling/gaynor-honoured-326269.html Irish Independent]</ref>\n* 2002 [[Fiona O'Driscoll]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])<ref>AIB award confined to Munster players, [https://archive.is/20120802085154/http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/louth-fury-with-referee-after-exit-281560.html Irish Independent Dec 6 2002]</ref>\n* 2005 [[Gemma O'Connor (camogie player)|Gemma O'Connor]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])\n* 2006 [[Mary O'Connor (camogie player)|Mary O'Connor]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])\n* 2007 [[Kate Kelly (camogie)|Kate Kelly]] ([[Wexford GAA#Camogie|Wexford]])\n* 2008 [[Aoife Murray]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])\n* 2009 [[Ann Dalton]] ([[Kilkenny GAA#Camogie|Kilkenny]])\n* 2015 [[Gemma O'Connor (camogie player)|Gemma O'Connor]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])\n* 2016 [[Denise Gaule]] ([[Kilkenny GAA#Camogie|Kilkenny]])\n* 2017 [[Rena Buckley]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])\n* 2018 [[Ann Dalton]] ([[Kilkenny GAA#Camogie|Kilkenny]])\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Young Player of the Year===\nThe first attempt at a young player of the year award was the Elvery's Cup for \u201cMiss Camogie\u201d, as much in the tradition of pageants as sports star awards, awarded to UCD [[Ashbourne Cup]] winning captain [[Patricia Morrissey]] in 1971.

Independent]] sports star of the week, selected by newspaper sports staff, was traditionally accorded to a camogie player once each year on the week of the All Ireland final. Annual C\u00fachulainn All Star awards were introduced as part of the first Gaelic Weekly All-star awards scheme, initiated by a group of sportswriters led by [[Mick Dunne]] and awarded on the same selectorial basis as the [[GAA All Stars Awards|Gaelic football and hurling all stars]] are today, though without a major sponsor. They were awarded to two camogie players in 1964-7, reduced to one in 1968-9. The camogie selectors for 1964 were [[Maeve Gilroy]], [[Kathleen Mills]] and [[Lil O'Grady]] and those of 1965 were [[Se\u00e1n O'Duffy#Personal Life|Kathleen O'Duffy]], [[S\u00edghle Nic an Ultaigh]] and Eithne Neville. In the 1970s the GAA Player of the month scheme, awarded one of its monthly awards, usually in November, to a camogie player. The scheme, initiated by sports journalist and historian [[David Guiney]] and also selected by sportswriters, became an effective player of the year award under three successive sponsors, B+I Line, Irish Nationwide and Eircell. The camogie player of the year was revived as part of the Powerscreen all star award scheme in and an official player of the year award was introduced in 2005.\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* 1963 [[\u00dana O'Connor]] ([[Dublin GAA#Camogie|Dublin]])\n* 1963 [[Deirdre Sutton]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])\n* 1964 [[Alice Hussey]] ([[Dublin GAA#Camogie|Dublin]])\n* 1964 [[Teresa Murphy]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])\n* 1965 (Joint) [[Mair\u00e9ad McAtamney]] ([[Antrim GAA#Camogie|Antrim]])\n* 1965 (Joint) [[Claire Hanrahan]] ([[Kilkenny GAA#Camogie|Kilkenny]])\n* 1966 (Joint) [[Mary Connery]] ([[Kilkenny GAA#Camogie|Kilkenny]])\n* 1966 (Joint) [[Maeve Gilroy]] ([[Antrim GAA#Camogie|Antrim]])\n* 1967 [[\u00dana O'Connor]] ([[Dublin GAA#Camogie|Dublin]])\n* 1968 [[Margaret O'Leary]] ([[Wexford GAA#Camogie|Wexford]])\n* 1973 [[Marie Costine]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])\n* 1974 [[Helena O'Neill]] ([[Kilkenny GAA#Camogie|Kilkenny]])\n* 1975 [[Bridget Doyle]] ([[Wexford GAA#Camogie|Wexford]])\n* 1976 [[Angela Downey]] ([[Kilkenny GAA#Camogie|Kilkenny]])\n* 1977 [[Bridie McGarry|Bridie Martin]] ([[Kilkenny GAA#Camogie|Kilkenny]])\n* 1978 [[Pat Moloney]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])\n* 1979 [[Mair\u00e9ad McAtamney]] ([[Antrim GAA#Camogie|Antrim]])\n* 1980 [[Marion McCarthy]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])\n* 1981 [[Liz Neary]] ([[Kilkenny GAA#Camogie|Kilkenny]])\n* 1982 [[Mary O'Leary (camogie)|Mary O'Leary]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])\n* 1983 [[Claire Cronin]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])\n* 1984 [[Yvonne Redmond]] ([[Dublin GAA#Camogie|Dublin]])\n* 1985 [[Angela Downey]] ([[Kilkenny GAA#Camogie|Kilkenny]])\n* 1986 [[Ann Downey|Ann]] & [[Angela Downey]] ([[Kilkenny GAA#Camogie|Kilkenny]])\n* 1987 [[Breda Holmes]] ([[Kilkenny GAA#Camogie|Kilkenny]])\n* 1988 [[Biddy O'Sullivan]] ([[Kilkenny GAA#Camogie|Kilkenny]])\n* 1989 [[Ann Downey|Ann]] & [[Angela Downey]] ([[Kilkenny GAA#Camogie|Kilkenny]])\n* 1991 [[Ann Downey]] ([[Kilkenny GAA#Camogie|Kilkenny]])\n* 1992 [[Sandie Fitzgibbon]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])\n* 1993 [[Linda Mellerick]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])\n* 1995 [[Sandie Fitzgibbon]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])\n* 1998 [[Linda Mellerick]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])\n* 1999 [[Deirdre Hughes]] ([[Tipperary GAA#Camogie|Tipperary]])\n* 2000 [[Jovita Delaney]] ([[Tipperary GAA#Camogie|Tipperary]])<ref>Eircell award report in [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2000/1122/00112200167.html Irish Times] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021174741/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2000/1122/00112200167.html |date=October 21, 2012 }}</ref>\n* 2001 [[Ciara Gaynor]] ([[Tipperary GAA#Camogie|Tipperary]])<ref>Eircell award report in [https://archive.is/20120906130541/http://www.independent.ie/sport/hurling/gaynor-honoured-326269.html Irish Independent]</ref>\n* 2002 [[Fiona O'Driscoll]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])<ref>AIB award confined to Munster players, [https://archive.is/20120802085154/http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/louth-fury-with-referee-after-exit-281560.html Irish Independent Dec 6 2002]</ref>\n* 2005 [[Gemma O'Connor (camogie player)|Gemma O'Connor]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])\n* 2006 [[Mary O'Connor (camogie player)|Mary O'Connor]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])\n* 2007 [[Kate Kelly (camogie)|Kate Kelly]] ([[Wexford GAA#Camogie|Wexford]])\n* 2008 [[Aoife Murray]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])\n* 2009 [[Ann Dalton]] ([[Kilkenny GAA#Camogie|Kilkenny]])\n* 2015 [[Gemma O'Connor (camogie player)|Gemma O'Connor]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])\n* 2016 [[Denise Gaule]] ([[Kilkenny GAA#Camogie|Kilkenny]])\n* 2017 [[Rena Buckley]] ([[Cork GAA#Camogie|Cork]])\n* 2018 [[Ann Dalton]] ([[Kilkenny GAA#Camogie|Kilkenny]])\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Young Player of the Year===\nThe first attempt at a young player of the year award was the Elvery's Cup for \u201cMiss Camogie\u201d, as much in the tradition of pageants as sports star awards, awarded to UCD [[Ashbourne Cup]] winning captain [[Patricia Morrissey]] in 1971.

However, she was known to exaggerate the closeness of Lugosi's paternal relationship to her; in Richard Bojarski's ''The Films of Bela Lugosi'', she describes his funeral as if she had been there, and claims to have been, though she was not actually in attendance.<ref>Lennig, Arthur.
