It was in the [[3rd Tank Army (Soviet Union)|3rd Tank Army]] when it formed but this force was badly damaged in Army Group South's counteroffensive south of [[Kharkiv|Kharkov]] in March, 1943 and the division had to be withdrawn for a substantial rebuilding in [[57th Army (Soviet Union)|57th Army]] of [[Southwestern Front (Soviet Union)|Southwestern Front]] during the spring. It remained in the south of Ukraine into early 1944, mostly in either that or the [[37th Army (Soviet Union)|37th Army]], and won a battle honor in the process. It was then removed to the [[Reserve of the Supreme High Command]] for another rebuilding before returning to the front in May, 1944 and joining the [[28th Army (Soviet Union)|28th Army]], where it remained for the duration of the war. Taking part in the summer offensive in Belarus the 48th Guards was awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner]] and several of its subunits also received decorations or distinctions. In January, 1945 the division fought into East Prussia and assisted in the fighting southwest of the city/fortress of K\u00f6nigsberg before 28th Army was redeployed westward to take part in the Berlin operation. By now it was part of [[1st Ukrainian Front]] and spent the last days of the war advancing on Prague. During the summer it was reassigned to the [[Belorussian Military District]]. The division was converted to the 38th Guards Rifle Brigade in 1946, but reformed as a new 48th Guards Rifle Division in 1949.\n\n==Formation==\nThe 48th Guards officially received its Guards title on October 20. It would receive its banner on December 17 from the commander of 3rd Tank Army, Major General [[Pavel Rybalko]], and its subunits would be redesignated on December 26; at this point the division's order of battle was as follows:{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n* 138th Guards Rifle Regiment (from 1056th Rifle Regiment)\n* 143rd Guards Rifle Regiment (from 1058th Rifle Regiment)\n* 146th Guards Rifle Regiment (from 1060th Rifle Regiment)\n* 98th Guards Artillery Regiment<ref>Charles C.

Nikolai Matveevich Makovchuk remained in command of the division after redesignation; he had commanded the 264th throughout its 2nd formation and would be promoted to the rank of major general on November 10. The redesignation took place when 3rd Tank Army was in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command after having been removed from the south flank of [[Western Front (Soviet Union)|Western Front]].<ref>[http://www.soldat.ru/files/f/boevojsostavsa1942.pdf Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942], pp. 168, 202</ref> On October 25 the division boarded trains at [[Sukhinichi]] and began moving to the [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] area where it remained until December 20 undergoing rebuilding and training of its personnel. By the beginning of January, 1943 the 48th Guards rejoined 3rd Tank Army in [[Voronezh Front]] just prior to the start of the Ostrogozhsk\u2013Rossosh Offensive. 3rd Tank still had the early mixed tank army composition with two rifle divisions, the other being the [[184th Rifle Division|184th]].<ref>[http://www.soldat.ru/files/f/boevojsostavsa1943.pdf Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943], p. 15</ref>\n\n==Third Battle of Kharkov==\nThe Army was concentrated just north of [[Kantemirovka]] when the offensive began on January 13. It was facing elements of the [[Eighth Army (Italy)|Italian 8th Army]], which had already been shattered during [[Operation Little Saturn]], and the [[XXIV Panzer Corps]]. The advance made good progress and the Front commander, Col. Gen. [[Nikolai Vatutin|N. F. Vatutin]], reported that 3rd Tank had captured the [[Valuyki, Belgorod Oblast|Valuyki]] and [[Urazovo]] regions in [[Belgorod Oblast]] by January 19. On February 8 the Front's [[60th Army (Soviet Union)|60th Army]] liberated [[Kursk]] and the German [[2nd Army (Wehrmacht)|2nd Army]] appeared to be in full retreat. 3rd Tank, currently south of Kharkov, was ordered on February 16 to exploit towards [[Poltava]]. However, on February 19 Field Marshal [[Erich von Manstein|E. von Manstein]] launched his counteroffensive towards the former city and had soon thrown the forces of Voronezh Front into confusion.<ref>David M. Glantz, ''After Stalingrad'', Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2011, pp. 18-19, 115, 170, 278</ref> On the last day of the month the Army was transferred to Southwestern Front,<ref>[http://www.soldat.ru/files/f/boevojsostavsa1943.pdf Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943], p. 65</ref> and was ordered to swing 90 degrees from the Poltava axis to counterattack the [[II SS Panzer Corps|SS Panzer Corps]]. After more than a month of near constant fighting 3rd Tank was woefully under-strength, suffering from shortages of equipment, fuel and ammunition and had a total of fewer than 80 operational tanks. On March 1 the Army advanced south into the [[Kehychivka|Kegichevka]] region and soon encountered three converging panzer divisions, with predictable results. Between March 3-5 the SS Corps and the arriving [[XXXXVIII Panzer Corps]] \"completely demolished\" the two tank corps and the supporting rifle divisions of 3rd Tank, forced the survivors back towards Kharkov and advanced to within 32km of the city, which fell by March 16.<ref>Glantz, ''After Stalingrad'', pp. 186-87, 192</ref>\n\nShortly after taking [[Belgorod]] on the 17th the German offensive ground to a halt in part due to the spring [[Rasputitsa|''rasputitsa'']], giving the Red Army survivors a respite to regroup and rebuild. As of the beginning of April the 48th Guards was still in 3rd Tank Army in Southwestern Front, east of the [[Donets]], but later that month it was reassigned to the new [[27th Guards Rifle Corps]] of 57th Army, still in the same Front. It would remain under these commands into July.<ref>[http://www.soldat.ru/files/f/boevojsostavsa1943.pdf Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943], pp. 88, 113, 139, 165</ref> On May 27 General Makovchuk took command of the [[34th Guards Rifle Corps]] and three days later he handed command of the division to Col. Leonid Ivanovich Vagin. As it replenished its forces the division was noted in June as having 80 percent of its personnel of various Asian nationalities, but a month later the breakdown was reported as 40 percent Russian, 30 percent Ukrainian, and 30 percent [[Turkmens|Turkmen]].<ref>Glantz, ''Colossus Reborn'', University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2005, p. 595</ref>\n\n==Into Ukraine==\nOn July 2 Colonel Vagin gave over his command to Col. Gelb Nikolaevich Korchikov. Vagin would go on to command the [[79th Guards Rifle Division]], be promoted to the rank of major general, and was made a [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] in April, 1945. Korchikov was also promoted to major general on March 19, 1944, and led the division into the postwar period when it was reorganized as the 38th Guards Rifle Brigade. Later in July the 27th Guards Corps was transferred to the [[6th Army (Soviet Union)|6th Army]], still in Southwestern Front, at the start of the second Donbass Strategic Offensive. This began on August 13, following the German defeat at Kursk, and the 48th Guards took part in forcing the Donets and assisting [[Steppe Front]] in the final liberation of Kharkov. Later that month the division was reassigned to the [[76th Rifle Corps]], which was in the Steppe Front's reserves.<ref>[http://www.soldat.ru/files/f/boevojsostavsa1943.pdf Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943], pp. 196, 224</ref> Meanwhile, on August 7 the 98th Guards Artillery Regiment had been recognized for its service with the award of the Order of the Red Banner.{{Sfn|Affairs Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of the Soviet Union|1967a|p=175}}\n\nAt the beginning of September the 48th Guards was again marching towards Poltava, but on the 6th the ''STAVKA'' redirected Steppe Front's main thrust in the direction of [[Kremenchuk|Kremenchug]] on the [[Dnieper|Dniepr]].<ref>John Erickson, ''The Road to Berlin'', Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, UK, 1983, p. 126</ref> During the summer offensive Sen. Sgt. Vasilii Yakovlevich Petrov, commander of the reconnaissance platoon of the 146th Guards Rifle Regiment, distinguished himself. Under his leadership the platoon staged a series of raids behind German lines which gained 20 prisoners for interrogation, killed or wounded as many as 100 German soldiers and officers and gained much valuable information. On December 20 Petrov would be made a Hero of the Soviet Union; he would later be killed in action at [[Gusev, Kaliningrad Oblast|Gumbinnen]] on November 25, 1944.<ref>http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=17145.

Sgt. Nikolai Kulba had volunteered for the Red Army in August, 1942 after being convicted for robbery in 1941. By the spring of 1943 he was in the 146th Guards Rifle Regiment and was recognized as one of the division's best snipers, with 29 kills. In the early fighting for the bridgehead he took command of his company after its commander was wounded and led it in a successful attack on the Rogan height, despite his own wound. On October 27, in a battle for the Zhovtnevo farm, he destroyed a German machine gun position with grenades despite being wounded again in the process. He had been in hospital until sometime before his award was approved, but disappeared before it could be awarded. Kulba was not finally tracked down until 1958, due to his use of a different patronymic, and the Soviet Army authorities found he had been convicted of two more crimes, including rape. On July 1, 1959 Kulba was deprived of all ranks and awards.<ref>http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=13510. In Russian; English translation available.

The important rail hub of [[Piatykhatky, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast|Pyatikhatka]] was liberated on October 18 cutting the line from Dnepropetrovsk to [[Kryvyi Rih|Krivoi Rog]] and the latter city was the Front's next objective. On October 24 von Manstein transferred the [[XXXX Panzer Corps]] to [[8th Army (Wehrmacht)|8th Army]] on the northern flank of the Soviet thrust but this was still deploying when 2nd Ukrainian's lead elements reached the outskirts of Krivoi Rog the next day. The German counterattack began on the 27th and over the course of three days caused significant destruction to the overstretched Soviet forces, driving them back some 30km.

The offensive was renewed on January 30 after a powerful artillery preparation against the positions of the German [[XXX Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|XXX Army Corps]] on the same sector of the line, but this was met with a counter-barrage that disrupted the attack. A new effort the next day, backed by even heavier artillery and air support, made progress but still did not penetrate the German line.<ref>Ziemke, ''Stalingrad to Berlin'', pp. 240-41</ref>\n\nOn February 1 the XXX Corps line was pierced in several places and by nightfall the Soviet forces had torn a 9km-wide gap in the line west of the [[Bazavluk River|Buzuluk River]]. During the next two days German [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|6th Army]] tried to avoid encirclement by slogging through the mud to the Kamenka River line, which was already compromised by the Soviet advance. Forward detachments of [[8th Guards Army]] reached [[Apostolove|Apostolovo]] on the 4th and over the next few days 46th Army began to attempt a sweep westward to envelop Krivoi Rog from the south. The dispersion of the Front's forces, combined with German reserves produced by the evacuation of the [[Nikopol, Ukraine|Nikopol]] bridgehead east of the Dniepr and indecision on the part of the German high command, produced \"a peculiar sort of semiparalysis\" on this part of the front during the second half of the month. During this period the 48th Guards was transferred to the [[34th Rifle Corps]] of 46th Army. Finally, on February 21st elements of the 46th and 37th Armies broke into the outer defenses of Krivoi Rog. To avoid costly street fighting 6th Army was withdrawn west of the city, which was liberated the next day.<ref>Ziemke, ''Stalingrad to Berlin'', pp. 241-44</ref> The division was given a battle honor for its part in this action:{{quotation|\"KRIVOI ROG... 48th Guards Rifle Division (Colonel Korchikov, Gleb Nikolaevich)...

While there it was assigned to the 28th Army and it would remain under that command for the duration of the war. In May it became one of the first Red Army divisions to have the [[45 mm anti-tank gun M1942 (M-42)|45mm antitank guns]] of its antitank battalion replaced with 12 [[SU-76]] self-propelled guns.<ref>Sharp, ''\"Red Guards\"'', p. 63</ref>\n\n==Operation Bagration==\n[[File:Operation_bagration-bobruisk_operation-june_24-27_1944.png|thumb|left|140px|Bobryusk Offensive. Note initial position of 28th Army north of Mozyr.]]In April the division was assigned to the [[20th Rifle Corps]], with the [[55th Guards Rifle Division|55th Guards]] and [[20th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|20th Rifle Divisions]]. It would remain in this Corps, with these divisions, for the duration. When the Army returned to the front it joined the center of [[1st Belorussian Front]],<ref>[http://www.soldat.ru/files/f/boevojsostavsa1944.pdf Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944], pp. 148, 163</ref> at the corner northwest of [[Mazyr|Mozyr]], linking with the left-flank armies which stretched along the southern margins of the [[Pripyat Marshes]]. While those armies would mostly remain inactive in the first weeks the Front commander, Army Gen. [[Konstantin Rokossovsky|K. K. Rokossovskii]], assigned the 28th an active role in the initial phase of the summer offensive in support of [[65th Army (Soviet Army)|65th Army's]] drive on [[Babruysk|Bobryusk]]. The Army deployed all three of its corps in the first echelon with 20th Corps on a 5km-wide sector in the center. During the first two days of the battle the Army pressured the flanks of the German [[35th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|35th]] and [[129th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|129th Infantry Divisions]], forcing them back towards the railroad south of Bobruysk.<ref>Walter S. Dunn, Jr., ''Soviet Blitzkrieg'', Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2008, pp. 207-08, 210</ref>\n\nOn June 25 the 28th Army broke into the lines of the two German divisions in five places. The 129th Infantry, by now reduced to the size of a regiment, was forced to rotate to the west, leaving a gap on its corps' north flank. Meanwhile the [[18th Rifle Corps]] of 65th Army was scattering the remnants of 35th Infantry and widening the gap, which was entered by [[Cavalry Mechanized Group Pliev]]. By the evening of June 28 Pliev's [[30th Cavalry Division (Soviet Union)|30th Cavalry Division]] reached the outskirts of [[Slutsk]], as the rifle divisions of 28th Army were making their best speed to keep up with the advance of the mobile group. By June 30 German reinforcements were arriving, including elements of the [[4th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|4th Panzer Division]] at [[Baranavichy|Baranovichi]] which were sent to block the road to Slutsk. From June 22 to July 3 the 28th Army and Group Pliev had forced a German retreat of 250km to the vicinity of [[Stowbtsy|Stolbtsy]], but the advance now paused to bring up supplies to overcome the increasing resistance.<ref>Dunn, Jr., ''Soviet Blitzkrieg'', pp. 213-14, 217, 219</ref>\n===Baranovichi-Slonim Operation===\nResistance along the Baranovichi axis grew on July 4 as reinforcements continued to arrive, including the remainder of 4th Panzer, units of [[12th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|12th Panzer Division]] that had broken through from [[Minsk]], and the [[1st Cavalry Division (Hungary)|1st Hungarian Cavalry Division]] moving up from [[Pinsk]]. 28th Army reached a line from Minkeviche to [[Kletsk]] to Rybaki. At this time Baranovichi was garrisoned by the 52nd Special Designation Security Division, a panzer battalion and three assault gun brigades. A defensive line was already being prepared along the [[Shchara River]] based on the town of [[Slonim]]. The Front was ordered, under ''STAVKA'' operational directive no. 220127, to immediately resume its advance on Baranovichi and subsequently to [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]] with the [[48th Army (Soviet Union)|48th]], 65th and 28th Armies; however the 28th was stretched out over a 25km line of march and was still 12km from its designated attack sector. The 48th Guards was reported as at roughly 85 percent of its authorized strength.<ref>Soviet General Staff, ''Operation Bagration'', ed. & trans. R. W.

Luchinsky]], directed his forces to outflank Baranovichi from the south on July 5, and by evening had liberated [[Lyakhavichy|Lyakhovichi]]. Intensive fighting for Baranovichi took place on July 6-7. The line along the Shchara was penetrated but the Army advanced only a few kilometres. By the end of the second day the town was partially encircled but the Soviet advance was slowed by German reinforcements and continuing difficulties in bringing the Front's forces up to the attack sectors. Overnight the 65th Army, assisted by the 28th, stormed Baranovichi in an unexpected night attack which cleared it by 0400 hours on July 8 as the German forces withdrew to the west. By the end of the day the Army had advanced as far as [[Hantsavichy|Gintsevichi]].<ref>Soviet General Staff, ''Operation Bagration'', Kindle ed., vol. 2, ch. 10</ref> On July 25 the 143rd Guards Rifle Regiment was decorated with the Order of the Red Banner for its part in the crossing of the Shchara and the liberation of Slonim, while two days later the division as a whole received the same award for the liberation of Baranovichi.{{Sfn|Affairs Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of the Soviet Union|1967a|pp=414, 417}}\n===Lublin\u2013Brest Offensive===\nThe 28th Army continued making its main offensive in the direction of [[Kosava, Belarus|Kossovo]] and Smolyanitsa and by July 13 had reached the [[Yaselda River]] along its entire front. At this point it encountered much stiffer resistance from the newly-arrived [[102nd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|102nd Infantry Division]] and the [[5th Reserve Division (Hungary)|5th Hungarian Reserve Division]]. It fell to the [[1st Mechanized Corps (Soviet Union)|1st Mechanized Corps]] to pierce this line and allow the advance to continue. By July 16 the Army had reached the approaches to Brest.<ref>Soviet General Staff, ''Operation Bagration'', Kindle ed., vol. 2, ch. 10</ref>\n\nThe operation to liberate that city began on July 17. The Front's main attack would be made by its left-flank armies with the right-flank forces in support; 28th Army on the right with [[61st Army (Soviet Union)|61st Army]] and the Pliev Group were to outflank the city from the north and northwest, encircle and capture it. The attack began with a 15-20 minute artillery preparation. 28th Army, with the Pliev Group, directed their advances towards [[Kamyenyets|Kamenets]], and by the end of the day had covered 25km. After beating off numerous German counterattacks the next day the Army forced the Lesnaya River east of Dmitrovichi and linked up with 61st Army. From July 19 the German High Command began heavy counterattacks against the Army and the Pliev Group in order to continue its hold on Brest, and these would continue until the 21st. Only with the commitment of 20th Corps from second echelon in the direction of the railroad to Brest along the Army's left flank during the second half of July 20 did the offensive begin to gain momentum and the German forces begin to withdraw towards the city. During July 25-26 the Army forced the [[Lesnaya River]] north of Czernawczyci and General Rokossovskii handed over his reserve [[46th Rifle Corps]] to help complete the encirclement.

In September the 28th Army returned to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command for rest and rebuilding and in October was reassigned to the [[3rd Belorussian Front]] on the East Prussian border.<ref>[http://www.soldat.ru/files/f/boevojsostavsa1944.pdf Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944], pp. 299, 313</ref> It was almost immediately involved in the abortive Goldap-Gumbinnen Operation, which largely ended on its sector by October 30. In the planning for the Vistula-Oder Offensive in January, 1945 the Front organized its shock group into two echelons with the [[39th Army (Soviet Union)|39th]], [[5th Army (RSFSR)|5th]] and 28th Armies in the first, backed by the [[11th Guards Army]] and two tank corps. The 28th Army had its main forces on its right flank and was to launch a vigorous attack north of the [[Nesterov|Stallup\u00f6nen]] - Gumbinnen paved highway in the general direction of [[Chernyakhovsk|Insterburg]]. Its breakthrough frontage was 7km wide and its immediate objective was to destroy the Gumbinnen group of German forces in conjunction with 5th Army before assisting 11th Guards in its deployment along the [[Instruch River|Inster River]].<ref>Soviet General Staff, ''Prelude to Berlin'', ed. & trans.

The Army, mainly facing the [[549th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|549th Infantry Division]], broke through the defense along the Kischen - Grunhaus sector and penetrated as much as 7km by the day's end while fighting off 14 counterattacks by infantry and tanks. On the next day less progress was made as the [[3rd Guards Rifle Corps]] faced a extended fight for the strongpoint of Kattenau. January 16 saw only small progress as the German forces continued to cover the routes to Gumbinnen. By now it was apparent to the Front commander, Army Gen. [[Ivan Chernyakhovsky|I. D. Chernyakhovsky]], that the breakthrough would not come on this sector and he moved his second echelon to the 39th Army's front. On January 19 the Army began to advance more successfully. General Luchinskii concentrated the maximum amount of artillery fire in support of the 3rd Guards and [[128th Rifle Corps]] allowing a breakthrough on a narrow sector towards the northeastern outskirts of Gumbinnen. Meanwhile the 20th Corps reached the town from the south, but the German grouping continued to resist and the Army's units were forced to consolidate. During a two-day battle on January 20-21 the 20th and 128th Corps finally captured Gumbinnen, but a large remnant of the German forces managed to retreat to the [[Angrapa River|Angerapp River]], which the 28th Army reached by the end of the second day. By 2300 hours on January 23 it became apparent that the German forces facing the Army were in retreat to the west. Over the next two days the Army advanced up to 35km and reached a line from Kortmedin to [[Zheleznodorozhny, Kaliningrad Oblast|Gerdauen]] by the end of the 26th, less than 70km southeast of [[Kaliningrad|K\u00f6nigsberg]].<ref>Soviet General Staff, ''Prelude to Berlin'', pp. 190-91, 196-97, 218-19, 222, 226-27</ref>\n\nBy February 8 the 20th Corps, in cooperation with forces of 5th Army, outflanked the town of [[Bagrationovsk|Preu\u00dfisch Eylau]] from the north and began fighting along its outskirts, a battle that continued for some days.<ref>Soviet General Staff, ''Prelude to Berlin'', p. 233</ref> Sgt. Maj. Aleksei Leontievich Pshenichko commanded a platoon of the 47th Guards Reconnaissance Company. On one of the first days his platoon successfully uncovered much of the German fire plan and took 25 soldiers and one officer as prisoners. During February 16 a group of German forces, attempting to escape to the southwest, attempted to take the 48th Guards in the rear in the vicinity of the village of Bomben. Pshenichko's scouts repelled four attacks and killed or wounded up to 80 of the attackers; the [[Starshina|''Starshina's'']] personal example was crucial to holding the line, but he was killed in action. On April 19 he would be posthumously be made a Hero of the Soviet Union.<ref>http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=11995. In Russian; English translation available.

Despite this the Front ordered a new operation to eliminate the remaining German forces southwest of the K\u00f6nigsberg fortified zone. The new offensive began on March 13, with 28th Army attacking in the direction of Bladiau, which was taken on March 15. During the night of March 25/26 the Army, in cooperation with [[31st Army (Soviet Union)|31st Army]], stormed the town of Rosenberg and advanced towards [[Balga]], capturing 6,200 soldiers, 25 tanks and 220 guns of various calibres. Immediately after the operation ended on March 29 the 28th was reassigned to the Reserve of the Supreme High command and began moving across eastern Germany towards the [[Oder River]].<ref>Soviet General Staff, ''Prelude to Berlin'', pp. 245-50</ref> On April 26 the division would be decorated with the [[Order of Suvorov]], 2nd Degree, in recognition of its role in the fighting southwest of K\u00f6nigsberg.{{Sfn|Affairs Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of the Soviet Union|1967b|p=116}}\n===Battle of Berlin===\nBy mid-April the division had arrived in the 1st Ukrainian Front.<ref>[http://www.soldat.ru/files/f/boevojsostavsa1945.pdf Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1945], p. 160</ref> The [[Battle of the Oder\u2013Neisse|battle for the Oder and Neisse Rivers]] began on April 16 but 28th Army's leading divisions did not arrive at the front and begin combat operations until April 22. by this time the Front commander, Marshal [[Ivan Konev]], could foresee fierce fighting for Berlin and decided to reinforce [[3rd Guards Tank Army]] to the maximum. To this end General Luchinskii was ordered to load his 48th and [[61st Guards Rifle Division|61st Guards Rifle Divisions]] onto trucks to join the tank army in the [[Baruth/Mark|Baruth]] area. These divisions would remain under 3rd Guards Tank's command for the remainder of the Berlin battle. During the fighting on this day the 3rd Guards Tank forced the Notte Canal, broke through the Berlin outer defensive line and reached the inner line in the [[Marienfelde]] area in the southern suburbs.<ref>Soviet General Staff, ''The Berlin Operation 1945'', ed. & trans.

Much of that day was spent in coordinating the infantry and armor with artillery and air support for the purpose of forcing the next major obstacle, the [[Teltow Canal]]. The crossing was set to begin at 0600 hours on April 24. Under intense direct and indirect artillery fire the 22nd Guards Motorized Rifle Brigade forced the canal on wooden rafts and the foundations of destroyed bridges and seized small bridgeheads. Once these were expanded the forward detachments of the 48th Guards followed. By 1300 hours a pontoon bridge had been installed and the main forces of the division, plus the tanks of the 9th Mechanized, began crossing to the north bank at 1400 hours, despite powerful German artillery and machine gun fire on the area and several counterattacks. During the day the division advanced as much as 2.5km to the north, reaching a line from [[Lichterfelde (Berlin)|Lichterfelde]] to [[Zehlendorf (Berlin)|Zehlendorf]]. 3rd Guards Tank resumed the offensive the next morning and the 48th Guards assisted in clearing those two places before advancing up to 4km and beginning the fight for [[Steglitz]]. During the day the Soviet forces completed the encirclement of Berlin.<ref>Soviet General Staff, ''The Berlin Operation 1945'', Kindle ed., ch. 16</ref>\n\nBy April 26 the division was joined by its Corps-mate, 20th Rifle Division, in 3rd Guards Tank. During the day the combined force continued to attack northwards toward the city center. Steglitz was cleared along with the southern part of [[Schmargendorf]] and the interior defense line was reached. The next day the 48th and 61st Guards again teamed up with 9th Mechanized to advance 4km, capturing the [[Friedenau]] area and reaching a line along the Hauptstrasse and Haynauer Strasse. On April 28 the division was ordered to join with the [[6th Guards Tank Corps]] to attack in the general direction of Schmargendorf Station and the Preussenpark and by the end of the day to seize the line of the [[Landwehr Canal]] from Woyrschstrasse to the aquarium, but made only minor progress due to numerous obstacles and stubborn resistance, and this continued to be the case the following day. Finally, on April 30 the 48th Guards, 20th Rifle, and the 6th Guards Tank reached the southern edge of Preussenpark as organized resistance waned.<ref>Soviet General Staff, ''The Berlin Operation 1945'', Kindle ed., ch. 19, 20</ref> On May 2 the 138th Guards Rifle Regiment (Col.

It was in the [[3rd Tank Army (Soviet Union)|3rd Tank Army]] when it formed but this force was badly damaged in Army Group South's counteroffensive south of [[Kharkiv|Kharkov]] in March, 1943 and the division had to be withdrawn for a substantial rebuilding in [[57th Army (Soviet Union)|57th Army]] of [[Southwestern Front (Soviet Union)|Southwestern Front]] during the spring. It remained in the south of Ukraine into early 1944, mostly in either that or the [[37th Army (Soviet Union)|37th Army]], and won a battle honor in the process. It was then removed to the [[Reserve of the Supreme High Command]] for another rebuilding before returning to the front in May, 1944 and joining the [[28th Army (Soviet Union)|28th Army]], where it remained for the duration of the war. Taking part in the summer offensive in Belarus the 48th Guards was awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner]] and several of its subunits also received decorations or distinctions. In January, 1945 the division fought into East Prussia and assisted in the fighting southwest of the city/fortress of K\u00f6nigsberg before 28th Army was redeployed westward to take part in the Berlin operation. By now it was part of [[1st Ukrainian Front]] and spent the last days of the war advancing on Prague. During the summer it was reassigned to the [[Belorussian Military District]]. The division was converted to the 38th Guards Rifle Brigade in 1946, but reformed as a new 48th Guards Rifle Division in 1949.\n\n==Formation==\nThe 48th Guards officially received its Guards title on October 20. It would receive its banner on December 17 from the commander of 3rd Tank Army, Major General [[Pavel Rybalko]], and its subunits would be redesignated on December 26; at this point the division's order of battle was as follows:{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n* 138th Guards Rifle Regiment (from 1056th Rifle Regiment)\n* 143rd Guards Rifle Regiment (from 1058th Rifle Regiment)\n* 146th Guards Rifle Regiment (from 1060th Rifle Regiment)\n* 98th Guards Artillery Regiment<ref>Charles C.

Nikolai Matveevich Makovchuk remained in command of the division after redesignation; he had commanded the 264th throughout its 2nd formation and would be promoted to the rank of major general on November 10. The redesignation took place when 3rd Tank Army was in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command after having been removed from the south flank of [[Western Front (Soviet Union)|Western Front]].<ref>[http://www.soldat.ru/files/f/boevojsostavsa1942.pdf Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942], pp. 168, 202</ref> On October 25 the division boarded trains at [[Sukhinichi]] and began moving to the [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] area where it remained until December 20 undergoing rebuilding and training of its personnel. By the beginning of January, 1943 the 48th Guards rejoined 3rd Tank Army in [[Voronezh Front]] just prior to the start of the Ostrogozhsk\u2013Rossosh Offensive. 3rd Tank still had the early mixed tank army composition with two rifle divisions, the other being the [[184th Rifle Division|184th]].<ref>[http://www.soldat.ru/files/f/boevojsostavsa1943.pdf Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943], p. 15</ref>\n\n==Third Battle of Kharkov==\nThe Army was concentrated just north of [[Kantemirovka]] when the offensive began on January 13. It was facing elements of the [[Eighth Army (Italy)|Italian 8th Army]], which had already been shattered during [[Operation Little Saturn]], and the [[XXIV Panzer Corps]]. The advance made good progress and the Front commander, Col. Gen. [[Nikolai Vatutin|N. F. Vatutin]], reported that 3rd Tank had captured the [[Valuyki, Belgorod Oblast|Valuyki]] and [[Urazovo]] regions in [[Belgorod Oblast]] by January 19. On February 8 the Front's [[60th Army (Soviet Union)|60th Army]] liberated [[Kursk]] and the German [[2nd Army (Wehrmacht)|2nd Army]] appeared to be in full retreat. 3rd Tank, currently south of Kharkov, was ordered on February 16 to exploit towards [[Poltava]]. However, on February 19 Field Marshal [[Erich von Manstein|E. von Manstein]] launched his counteroffensive towards the former city and had soon thrown the forces of Voronezh Front into confusion.<ref>David M. Glantz, ''After Stalingrad'', Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2011, pp. 18-19, 115, 170, 278</ref> On the last day of the month the Army was transferred to Southwestern Front,<ref>[http://www.soldat.ru/files/f/boevojsostavsa1943.pdf Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943], p. 65</ref> and was ordered to swing 90 degrees from the Poltava axis to counterattack the [[II SS Panzer Corps|SS Panzer Corps]]. After more than a month of near constant fighting 3rd Tank was woefully under-strength, suffering from shortages of equipment, fuel and ammunition and had a total of fewer than 80 operational tanks. On March 1 the Army advanced south into the [[Kehychivka|Kegichevka]] region and soon encountered three converging panzer divisions, with predictable results. Between March 3-5 the SS Corps and the arriving [[XXXXVIII Panzer Corps]] \"completely demolished\" the two tank corps and the supporting rifle divisions of 3rd Tank, forced the survivors back towards Kharkov and advanced to within 32km of the city, which fell by March 16.<ref>Glantz, ''After Stalingrad'', pp. 186-87, 192</ref>\n\nShortly after taking [[Belgorod]] on the 17th the German offensive ground to a halt in part due to the spring [[Rasputitsa|''rasputitsa'']], giving the Red Army survivors a respite to regroup and rebuild. As of the beginning of April the 48th Guards was still in 3rd Tank Army in Southwestern Front, east of the [[Donets]], but later that month it was reassigned to the new [[27th Guards Rifle Corps]] of 57th Army, still in the same Front. It would remain under these commands into July.<ref>[http://www.soldat.ru/files/f/boevojsostavsa1943.pdf Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943], pp. 88, 113, 139, 165</ref> On May 27 General Makovchuk took command of the [[34th Guards Rifle Corps]] and three days later he handed command of the division to Col. Leonid Ivanovich Vagin. As it replenished its forces the division was noted in June as having 80 percent of its personnel of various Asian nationalities, but a month later the breakdown was reported as 40 percent Russian, 30 percent Ukrainian, and 30 percent [[Turkmens|Turkmen]].<ref>Glantz, ''Colossus Reborn'', University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2005, p. 595</ref>\n\n==Into Ukraine==\nOn July 2 Colonel Vagin gave over his command to Col. Gelb Nikolaevich Korchikov. Vagin would go on to command the [[79th Guards Rifle Division]], be promoted to the rank of major general, and was made a [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] in April, 1945. Korchikov was also promoted to major general on March 19, 1944, and led the division into the postwar period when it was reorganized as the 38th Guards Rifle Brigade. Later in July the 27th Guards Corps was transferred to the [[6th Army (Soviet Union)|6th Army]], still in Southwestern Front, at the start of the second Donbass Strategic Offensive. This began on August 13, following the German defeat at Kursk, and the 48th Guards took part in forcing the Donets and assisting [[Steppe Front]] in the final liberation of Kharkov. Later that month the division was reassigned to the [[76th Rifle Corps]], which was in the Steppe Front's reserves.<ref>[http://www.soldat.ru/files/f/boevojsostavsa1943.pdf Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943], pp. 196, 224</ref> Meanwhile, on August 7 the 98th Guards Artillery Regiment had been recognized for its service with the award of the Order of the Red Banner.{{Sfn|Affairs Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of the Soviet Union|1967a|p=175}}\n\nAt the beginning of September the 48th Guards was again marching towards Poltava, but on the 6th the ''STAVKA'' redirected Steppe Front's main thrust in the direction of [[Kremenchuk|Kremenchug]] on the [[Dnieper|Dniepr]].<ref>John Erickson, ''The Road to Berlin'', Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, UK, 1983, p. 126</ref> During the summer offensive Sen. Sgt. Vasilii Yakovlevich Petrov, commander of the reconnaissance platoon of the 146th Guards Rifle Regiment, distinguished himself. Under his leadership the platoon staged a series of raids behind German lines which gained 20 prisoners for interrogation, killed or wounded as many as 100 German soldiers and officers and gained much valuable information. On December 20 Petrov would be made a Hero of the Soviet Union; he would later be killed in action at [[Gusev, Kaliningrad Oblast|Gumbinnen]] on November 25, 1944.<ref>http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=17145.

Sen. Sgt. Pyotr Akimovich Kravets was the commander of a gun crew of the 98th Guards Artillery Regiment that made an assault crossing into the bridgehead north of Dnepropetrovsk on October 3. Three days later he directed the fire of his gun during a heavy German counterattack and accounted for four tanks, two assault guns and two machine guns. In total he and his crew destroyed seven tanks, three assault guns and several more machine guns and artillery pieces in the bridgehead.<ref>http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=3644.

During the summer offensive he had been responsible for the capture of four prisoners for interrogation. On October 17 he led a party into the German rear and discovered well-concealed artillery positions. He then contacted the divisional artillery by radio and called in accurate fire that destroyed 12 guns, seven mortars, two armored vehicles and a large number of personnel. Pustyntsev survived the war and went on to write his memoirs.<ref>http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=18638. In Russian; English translation available. Retrieved March 9, 2020.</ref> Sen. Sgt. Nikolai Kulba had volunteered for the Red Army in August, 1942 after being convicted for robbery in 1941. By the spring of 1943 he was in the 146th Guards Rifle Regiment and was recognized as one of the division's best snipers, with 29 kills. In the early fighting for the bridgehead he took command of his company after its commander was wounded and led it in a successful attack on the Rogan height, despite his own wound. On October 27, in a battle for the Zhovtnevo farm, he destroyed a German machine gun position with grenades despite being wounded again in the process. He had been in hospital until sometime before his award was approved, but disappeared before it could be awarded. Kulba was not finally tracked down until 1958, due to his use of a different patronymic, and the Soviet Army authorities found he had been convicted of two more crimes, including rape. On July 1, 1959 Kulba was deprived of all ranks and awards.<ref>http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=13510. In Russian; English translation available.

The important rail hub of [[Piatykhatky, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast|Pyatikhatka]] was liberated on October 18 cutting the line from Dnepropetrovsk to [[Kryvyi Rih|Krivoi Rog]] and the latter city was the Front's next objective. On October 24 von Manstein transferred the [[XXXX Panzer Corps]] to [[8th Army (Wehrmacht)|8th Army]] on the northern flank of the Soviet thrust but this was still deploying when 2nd Ukrainian's lead elements reached the outskirts of Krivoi Rog the next day. The German counterattack began on the 27th and over the course of three days caused significant destruction to the overstretched Soviet forces, driving them back some 30km. Until mid-December they rebuilt while carrying on attritional warfare with the two German armies.<ref>Ziemke, ''Stalingrad to Berlin'', pp. 181-82, 184, 189</ref> During November the 48th Guards returned to 27th Guards Corps, still in 57th Army.<ref>[http://www.soldat.ru/files/f/boevojsostavsa1943.pdf Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943], p. 308</ref>\n===Nikopol-Krivoi Rog Offensive===\n[[File:Nikopol\u2013Krivoy Rog Offensive Map English.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Nikopol-Krivoi Rog Offensive]]In December the 27th Guards Corps was reassigned to 37th Army, still in 2nd Ukrainian Front, but in the new year this Army was transferred to [[3rd Ukrainian Front]] while the division was moved to the [[57th Rifle Corps]].<ref>[http://www.soldat.ru/files/f/boevojsostavsa1944.pdf Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944], pp. 18, 48</ref> The Front's first effort to renew the drive on Krivoi Rog began on January 10, led mainly by [[46th Army (Soviet Union)|46th Army]], but made only modest gains at considerable cost and was halted on the 16th. The offensive was renewed on January 30 after a powerful artillery preparation against the positions of the German [[XXX Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|XXX Army Corps]] on the same sector of the line, but this was met with a counter-barrage that disrupted the attack. A new effort the next day, backed by even heavier artillery and air support, made progress but still did not penetrate the German line.<ref>Ziemke, ''Stalingrad to Berlin'', pp. 240-41</ref>\n\nOn February 1 the XXX Corps line was pierced in several places and by nightfall the Soviet forces had torn a 9km-wide gap in the line west of the [[Bazavluk River|Buzuluk River]]. During the next two days German [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|6th Army]] tried to avoid encirclement by slogging through the mud to the Kamenka River line, which was already compromised by the Soviet advance. Forward detachments of [[8th Guards Army]] reached [[Apostolove|Apostolovo]] on the 4th and over the next few days 46th Army began to attempt a sweep westward to envelop Krivoi Rog from the south. The dispersion of the Front's forces, combined with German reserves produced by the evacuation of the [[Nikopol, Ukraine|Nikopol]] bridgehead east of the Dniepr and indecision on the part of the German high command, produced \"a peculiar sort of semiparalysis\" on this part of the front during the second half of the month. During this period the 48th Guards was transferred to the [[34th Rifle Corps]] of 46th Army. Finally, on February 21st elements of the 46th and 37th Armies broke into the outer defenses of Krivoi Rog. To avoid costly street fighting 6th Army was withdrawn west of the city, which was liberated the next day.<ref>Ziemke, ''Stalingrad to Berlin'', pp. 241-44</ref> The division was given a battle honor for its part in this action:{{quotation|\"KRIVOI ROG... 48th Guards Rifle Division (Colonel Korchikov, Gleb Nikolaevich)...

While there it was assigned to the 28th Army and it would remain under that command for the duration of the war. In May it became one of the first Red Army divisions to have the [[45 mm anti-tank gun M1942 (M-42)|45mm antitank guns]] of its antitank battalion replaced with 12 [[SU-76]] self-propelled guns.<ref>Sharp, ''\"Red Guards\"'', p. 63</ref>\n\n==Operation Bagration==\n[[File:Operation_bagration-bobruisk_operation-june_24-27_1944.png|thumb|left|140px|Bobryusk Offensive. Note initial position of 28th Army north of Mozyr.]]In April the division was assigned to the [[20th Rifle Corps]], with the [[55th Guards Rifle Division|55th Guards]] and [[20th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|20th Rifle Divisions]]. It would remain in this Corps, with these divisions, for the duration. When the Army returned to the front it joined the center of [[1st Belorussian Front]],<ref>[http://www.soldat.ru/files/f/boevojsostavsa1944.pdf Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944], pp. 148, 163</ref> at the corner northwest of [[Mazyr|Mozyr]], linking with the left-flank armies which stretched along the southern margins of the [[Pripyat Marshes]]. While those armies would mostly remain inactive in the first weeks the Front commander, Army Gen. [[Konstantin Rokossovsky|K. K. Rokossovskii]], assigned the 28th an active role in the initial phase of the summer offensive in support of [[65th Army (Soviet Army)|65th Army's]] drive on [[Babruysk|Bobryusk]]. The Army deployed all three of its corps in the first echelon with 20th Corps on a 5km-wide sector in the center. During the first two days of the battle the Army pressured the flanks of the German [[35th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|35th]] and [[129th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|129th Infantry Divisions]], forcing them back towards the railroad south of Bobruysk.<ref>Walter S. Dunn, Jr., ''Soviet Blitzkrieg'', Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2008, pp. 207-08, 210</ref>\n\nOn June 25 the 28th Army broke into the lines of the two German divisions in five places. The 129th Infantry, by now reduced to the size of a regiment, was forced to rotate to the west, leaving a gap on its corps' north flank. Meanwhile the [[18th Rifle Corps]] of 65th Army was scattering the remnants of 35th Infantry and widening the gap, which was entered by [[Cavalry Mechanized Group Pliev]]. By the evening of June 28 Pliev's [[30th Cavalry Division (Soviet Union)|30th Cavalry Division]] reached the outskirts of [[Slutsk]], as the rifle divisions of 28th Army were making their best speed to keep up with the advance of the mobile group. By June 30 German reinforcements were arriving, including elements of the [[4th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|4th Panzer Division]] at [[Baranavichy|Baranovichi]] which were sent to block the road to Slutsk. From June 22 to July 3 the 28th Army and Group Pliev had forced a German retreat of 250km to the vicinity of [[Stowbtsy|Stolbtsy]], but the advance now paused to bring up supplies to overcome the increasing resistance.<ref>Dunn, Jr., ''Soviet Blitzkrieg'', pp. 213-14, 217, 219</ref>\n===Baranovichi-Slonim Operation===\nResistance along the Baranovichi axis grew on July 4 as reinforcements continued to arrive, including the remainder of 4th Panzer, units of [[12th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|12th Panzer Division]] that had broken through from [[Minsk]], and the [[1st Cavalry Division (Hungary)|1st Hungarian Cavalry Division]] moving up from [[Pinsk]]. 28th Army reached a line from Minkeviche to [[Kletsk]] to Rybaki. At this time Baranovichi was garrisoned by the 52nd Special Designation Security Division, a panzer battalion and three assault gun brigades. A defensive line was already being prepared along the [[Shchara River]] based on the town of [[Slonim]]. The Front was ordered, under ''STAVKA'' operational directive no. 220127, to immediately resume its advance on Baranovichi and subsequently to [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]] with the [[48th Army (Soviet Union)|48th]], 65th and 28th Armies; however the 28th was stretched out over a 25km line of march and was still 12km from its designated attack sector. The 48th Guards was reported as at roughly 85 percent of its authorized strength.<ref>Soviet General Staff, ''Operation Bagration'', ed. & trans. R. W.

Luchinsky]], directed his forces to outflank Baranovichi from the south on July 5, and by evening had liberated [[Lyakhavichy|Lyakhovichi]]. Intensive fighting for Baranovichi took place on July 6-7. The line along the Shchara was penetrated but the Army advanced only a few kilometres. By the end of the second day the town was partially encircled but the Soviet advance was slowed by German reinforcements and continuing difficulties in bringing the Front's forces up to the attack sectors. Overnight the 65th Army, assisted by the 28th, stormed Baranovichi in an unexpected night attack which cleared it by 0400 hours on July 8 as the German forces withdrew to the west. By the end of the day the Army had advanced as far as [[Hantsavichy|Gintsevichi]].<ref>Soviet General Staff, ''Operation Bagration'', Kindle ed., vol. 2, ch. 10</ref> On July 25 the 143rd Guards Rifle Regiment was decorated with the Order of the Red Banner for its part in the crossing of the Shchara and the liberation of Slonim, while two days later the division as a whole received the same award for the liberation of Baranovichi.{{Sfn|Affairs Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of the Soviet Union|1967a|pp=414, 417}}\n===Lublin\u2013Brest Offensive===\nThe 28th Army continued making its main offensive in the direction of [[Kosava, Belarus|Kossovo]] and Smolyanitsa and by July 13 had reached the [[Yaselda River]] along its entire front. At this point it encountered much stiffer resistance from the newly-arrived [[102nd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|102nd Infantry Division]] and the [[5th Reserve Division (Hungary)|5th Hungarian Reserve Division]]. It fell to the [[1st Mechanized Corps (Soviet Union)|1st Mechanized Corps]] to pierce this line and allow the advance to continue. By July 16 the Army had reached the approaches to Brest.<ref>Soviet General Staff, ''Operation Bagration'', Kindle ed., vol. 2, ch. 10</ref>\n\nThe operation to liberate that city began on July 17. The Front's main attack would be made by its left-flank armies with the right-flank forces in support; 28th Army on the right with [[61st Army (Soviet Union)|61st Army]] and the Pliev Group were to outflank the city from the north and northwest, encircle and capture it. The attack began with a 15-20 minute artillery preparation. 28th Army, with the Pliev Group, directed their advances towards [[Kamyenyets|Kamenets]], and by the end of the day had covered 25km. After beating off numerous German counterattacks the next day the Army forced the Lesnaya River east of Dmitrovichi and linked up with 61st Army. From July 19 the German High Command began heavy counterattacks against the Army and the Pliev Group in order to continue its hold on Brest, and these would continue until the 21st. Only with the commitment of 20th Corps from second echelon in the direction of the railroad to Brest along the Army's left flank during the second half of July 20 did the offensive begin to gain momentum and the German forces begin to withdraw towards the city. During July 25-26 the Army forced the [[Lesnaya River]] north of Czernawczyci and General Rokossovskii handed over his reserve [[46th Rifle Corps]] to help complete the encirclement. This was done on July 27 and beginning after midnight on the 28th the 20th Corps drove into the fortified zone from the north, throwing off counterattacks, and linked up with [[9th Guards Rifle Corps]] of 61st Army and the main forces of [[70th Army (Soviet Union)|70th Army]].<ref>Soviet General Staff, ''Operation Bagration'', Kindle ed., vol. 2, ch. 11</ref> By the end of the day the division was recognized for its part in the liberation of Brest, while its 53rd Guards Sapper Battalion (Maj.

In September the 28th Army returned to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command for rest and rebuilding and in October was reassigned to the [[3rd Belorussian Front]] on the East Prussian border.<ref>[http://www.soldat.ru/files/f/boevojsostavsa1944.pdf Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944], pp. 299, 313</ref> It was almost immediately involved in the abortive Goldap-Gumbinnen Operation, which largely ended on its sector by October 30. In the planning for the Vistula-Oder Offensive in January, 1945 the Front organized its shock group into two echelons with the [[39th Army (Soviet Union)|39th]], [[5th Army (RSFSR)|5th]] and 28th Armies in the first, backed by the [[11th Guards Army]] and two tank corps. The 28th Army had its main forces on its right flank and was to launch a vigorous attack north of the [[Nesterov|Stallup\u00f6nen]] - Gumbinnen paved highway in the general direction of [[Chernyakhovsk|Insterburg]]. Its breakthrough frontage was 7km wide and its immediate objective was to destroy the Gumbinnen group of German forces in conjunction with 5th Army before assisting 11th Guards in its deployment along the [[Instruch River|Inster River]].<ref>Soviet General Staff, ''Prelude to Berlin'', ed. & trans.

The Army, mainly facing the [[549th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|549th Infantry Division]], broke through the defense along the Kischen - Grunhaus sector and penetrated as much as 7km by the day's end while fighting off 14 counterattacks by infantry and tanks. On the next day less progress was made as the [[3rd Guards Rifle Corps]] faced a extended fight for the strongpoint of Kattenau. January 16 saw only small progress as the German forces continued to cover the routes to Gumbinnen. By now it was apparent to the Front commander, Army Gen. [[Ivan Chernyakhovsky|I. D. Chernyakhovsky]], that the breakthrough would not come on this sector and moved his second echelon to the 39th Army's front. On January 19 the Army began to advance more successfully. General Luchinskii concentrated the maximum amount of artillery fire in support of the 3rd Guards and [[128th Rifle Corps]] allowing a breakthrough on a narrow sector towards the northeastern outskirts of Gumbinnen. Meanwhile the 20th Corps reached the town from the south, but the German grouping continued to resist and the Army's units were forced to consolidate. During a two-day battle on January 20-21 the 20th and 128th Corps finally captured Gumbinnen, but a large remnant of the German forces managed to retreat to the [[Angrapa River|Angerapp River]], which the 28th Army reached by the end of the second day. By 2300 hours on January 23 it became apparent that the German forces facing the Army were in retreat to the west. Over the next two days the Army advanced up to 35km and reached a line from Kortmedin to [[Zheleznodorozhny, Kaliningrad Oblast|Gerdauen]] by the end of the 26th, less than 70km southeast of [[Kaliningrad|K\u00f6nigsberg]].<ref>Soviet General Staff, ''Prelude to Berlin'', pp. 190-91, 196-97, 218-19, 222, 226-27</ref>\n\nBy February 8 the 20th Corps, in cooperation with forces of 5th Army, outflanked the town of [[Bagrationovsk|Preu\u00dfisch Eylau]] from the north and began fighting along its outskirts, a battle that continued for some days.<ref>Soviet General Staff, ''Prelude to Berlin'', p. 233</ref> Sgt. Maj. Aleksei Leontievich Pshenichko commanded a platoon of the 47th Guards Reconnaissance Company.

Pshenichko's scouts repelled four attacks and killed or wounded up to 80 of the attackers; the [[Starshina|''Starshina's'']] personal example was crucial to holding the line, but he was killed in action.

Despite this the Front ordered a new operation to eliminate the remaining German forces southwest of the K\u00f6nigsberg fortified zone. The new offensive began on March 13, with 28th Army attacking in the direction of Bladiau, which was taken on March 15. During the night of March 25/26 the Army, in cooperation with [[31st Army (Soviet Union)|31st Army]], stormed the town of Rosenberg and advanced towards [[Balga]], capturing 6,200 soldiers, 25 tanks and 220 guns of various calibres. Immediately after the operation ended on March 29 the 28th was reassigned to the Reserve of the Supreme High command and began moving across eastern Germany towards the [[Oder River]].<ref>Soviet General Staff, ''Prelude to Berlin'', pp. 245-50</ref> On April 26 the division would be decorated with the [[Order of Suvorov]], 2nd Degree, in recognition of its role in the fighting southwest of K\u00f6nigsberg.{{Sfn|Affairs Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of the Soviet Union|1967b|p=116}}\n===Battle of Berlin===\nBy mid-April the division had arrived in the 1st Ukrainian Front.<ref>[http://www.soldat.ru/files/f/boevojsostavsa1945.pdf Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1945], p. 160</ref> The [[Battle of the Oder\u2013Neisse|battle for the Oder and Neisse Rivers]] began on April 16 but 28th Army's leading divisions did not arrive at the front and begin combat operations until April 22. by this time the Front commander, Marshal [[Ivan Konev]], could foresee fierce fighting for Berlin and decided to reinforce [[3rd Guards Tank Army]] to the maximum. To this end General Luchinskii was ordered to load his 48th and [[61st Guards Rifle Division|61st Guards Rifle Divisions]] onto trucks to join the tank army in the [[Baruth/Mark|Baruth]] area. These divisions would remain under 3rd Guards Tank's command for the remainder of the Berlin battle. During the fighting on this day the 3rd Guards Tank forced the Notte Canal, broke through the Berlin outer defensive line and reached the inner line in the [[Marienfelde]] area in the southern suburbs.<ref>Soviet General Staff, ''The Berlin Operation 1945'', ed. & trans.

Much of that day was spent in coordinating the infantry and armor with artillery and air support for the purpose of forcing the next major obstacle, the [[Teltow Canal]]. The crossing was set to begin at 0600 hours on April 24. Under intense direct and indirect artillery fire the 22nd Guards Motorized Rifle Brigade forced the canal on wooden rafts and the foundations of destroyed bridges and seized small bridgeheads. Once these were expanded the forward detachments of the 48th Guards followed. By 1300 hours a pontoon bridge had been installed and the main forces of the division, plus the tanks of the 9th Mechanized, began crossing to the north bank at 1400 hours, despite powerful German artillery and machine gun fire on the area and several counterattacks. During the day the division advanced as much as 2.5km to the north, reaching a line from [[Lichterfelde (Berlin)|Lichterfelde]] to [[Zehlendorf (Berlin)|Zehlendorf]]. 3rd Guards Tank resumed the offensive the next morning and the 48th Guards assisted in clearing those two places before advancing up to 4km and beginning the fight for [[Steglitz]]. During the day the Soviet forces completed the encirclement of Berlin.<ref>Soviet General Staff, ''The Berlin Operation 1945'', Kindle ed., ch. 16</ref>\n\nBy April 26 the division was joined by its Corps-mate, 20th Rifle Division, in 3rd Guards Tank. During the day the combined force continued to attack northwards toward the city center. Steglitz was cleared along with the southern part of [[Schmargendorf]] and the interior defense line was reached. The next day the 48th and 61st Guards again teamed up with 9th Mechanized to advance 4km, capturing the [[Friedenau]] area and reaching a line along the Hauptstrasse and Haynauer Strasse. On April 28 the division was ordered to join with the [[6th Guards Tank Corps]] to attack in the general direction of Schmargendorf Station and the Preussenpark and by the end of the day to seize the line of the [[Landwehr Canal]] from Woyrschstrasse to the aquarium, but made only minor progress due to numerous obstacles and stubborn resistance, and this continued to be the case the following day.

A few were developed during the closing days of [[World War II]] and saw very limited combat operations.  The first [[Jet fighter generations|generation]] can be split into two broad groups, slower craft with straight wings common to World War II era [[fighter aircraft|fighters]] such as the [[Gloster Meteor]], and mature [[swept wing]] designs such as the [[F-86]] used in the [[Fat Korean War]] which are controllable at [[transonic]] speeds:)-_-\n\n== World War II era ==\n[[Image:Kikka Orange Blossom Kikka-10.jpg|thumb|The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s 1945 [[Nakajima J9Y|Nakajima J9Y ''Kikka'']].]]\n\nThe initial attempts were straight-winged subsonic planes based heavily on the design concepts that had worked well in [[aircraft engine|piston-powered]] aircraft.  Some of these fighters were tested using piston engines to evaluate the airframes before the jets to power them were available or reliable enough to sustain flight.<ref>Radinger, Will and Schick Walter. Me 262 (in German). Berlin: Avantic Verlag GmbH, 1996. {{ISBN|3-925505-21-0}}, page 23</ref>\n\nThe pioneering airworthy turbojet aircraft, the [[He 178]], was a German [[Conventional landing gear|taildragger]]-geared design that first flew in August 1939.  It was used as the basis of the later [[tricycle landing gear]]ed [[He 280]], a design passed over for the [[Me 262]].  A similar British design, the [[Gloster E.28/39]] had provisions for some armament, but the guns were not fitted on either prototype.\n\nThe [[Bell P-59 Airacomet]] was the first American jet fighter to be put into service. It was never used in combat, as was mainly useful as an experimental fighter as its performance was inferior to the piston-engined [[North American P-51 Mustang]] which could reach higher top speeds and had a much greater range.\n\nJapan had some experimental models, such as the [[Nakajima Kikka|Nakajima ''Kikka'']], but none saw operational use.<ref># Francillon, R\u00e9ne J.

Although the Me 262 is often classified as an early straight-wing design, it actually incorporates some features of a slightly \"[[swept wing]]\" design, as it had a [[leading edge]] sweep of only 18.5\u00b0, too slight to achieve any significant advantage in increasing the [[critical Mach number]], the speed at which it can fly without encountering control problems due to compressibility.<ref name=\"Loftin\">Loftin, L.K.

There was originally a 35\u00b0 sweep, proposed by [[Adolph Busemann]], which was not adopted.<ref>Christopher, John.  ''The Race for Hitler's X-Planes'' (History Press, The Mill, Gloucestershire, 2013, p.48.</ref> Despite its late-war debut into production, the winner of Nazi Germany's ''Volksj\u00e4ger'' light fighter competition, the [[Heinkel He 162]]A ''Spatz''. was just about to enter service with the Luftwaffe's [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War II)|JG 1]] and even the specialist unit [[JV 44]] at the war's end, but only very isolated engagements with Allied combat aircraft \u2014 with JG 1 losing 13 He 162As during April 1945, ten to operational losses not involving combat (the design was still going through its evaluation period) and only a pair of actual losses of He 162As from aerial combat. 320 examples of the He 162A were completed by the war's end, with hundreds more incomplete He 162A airframes in the process of manufacture.\n\n[[World War II]] ended before jet fighters were common.  The [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] also had jet fighters operational before the end of the war.  The British [[Gloster Meteor]] twin-engined high speed fighter was used to intercept Germany's V-1 flying bombs missiles over the British Isles and not deployed for combat over Europe until 1945 but still kept away from occupied territory to prevent the technology being picked up by the Germans or Soviets. By 1946 16 RAF squadrons were equipped with Meteors. The American Lockheed P-80 entered service in the closing phases of the war and was deployed to Europe but arrived too late to see any combat.\n\nThe earliest jet fighters usually did not carry [[radar]] \u2014 except for the handful of [[Messerschmitt Me 262#Variants|Me 262B-1a/U1]] jet night fighters built and deployed in 1944-45 \u2014 or other sophisticated [[avionics]] and had similar equipment to the piston-engined counterparts used during the war.  [[Machine guns]] and [[cannon]] were the primary armament, though the Me 262 also used air-to-air unguided [[R4M|rocket]]s against Allied bomber formations and could carry unguided [[bomb]]s, with many follow-on designs in development on paper or in wind tunnels as the war ended (especially in Germany), like the [[Focke-Wulf Ta 183]].\n\nThe significant operational aircraft in this group include:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: middle\"\n|-\n!

The Russian [[Mikoyan-Gurevich I-250]] and [[Sukhoi Su-5]] were similar concepts but used a [[motorjet]] instead of a [[turbojet]] and were not designed for carrier use.\n\nFurther experiments after the war with mixed propulsion involving at least one [[turboprop]] powerplant included the [[XF2R Dark Shark]] and the [[XF-84H Thunderscreech]], one of the loudest aircraft ever flown.<ref># Knaack, Marcelle Size.

Washington, D.C.: Office of Air Force History, 1978. {{ISBN|0-912799-59-5}}.</ref>  The Thunderscreech, however, was a much later design, being a contemporary of the clearly second generation [[F-104 Starfighter]].  None of these hybrid-propulsion planes saw combat or major use, though the Fireball was used operationally for two years.\n\n== Post-World War II ==\n[[Image:MiG-15 RB1.jpg|thumb|right|A MiG-15 in [[Poland|Polish]] markings]]\n\nAfter World War II, some additional aircraft were built using refinements of the ideas used in the first attempts.  Some of these included a [[swept wing]] and some could break the [[sound barrier]] in a dive, but almost all of them lacked the [[thrust]] to do so in level flight.  [[Radar]] was used in dedicated [[interceptor aircraft|interceptors]] and [[night fighters]] but early models required a dedicated radar operator.  These aircraft are mostly associated with the [[Korean War]].  Some [[interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] designs, such as the [[F-94 Starfire|F-94]] used rockets such as the [[Mk 4/Mk 40 Folding-Fin Aerial Rocket]] as their primary weapon instead of guns.\n\n===Interceptors/Night fighters===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: right\"\n|-\n!

Pulqui II]], a prototype fighter built in [[Argentina]].  The Pulqui II was designed by a team which included former [[Germany|German]] engineers led by [[Kurt Tank]] and was based on initial designs for the [[Focke-Wulf Ta 183]], the proposed successor to the [[Me 262]]. The Pulqui II itself was a successor to the [[I.Ae. 27 Pulqui I]], a prototype jet fighter developed in Argentina by [[Emile Dewoitine]] in the late 1940s and the first of its type to fly in South America.\n\n== The End of the First Generation ==\n\nBy the 1950s, the next major group of fighter aircraft were planes that used [[air-to-air missiles]] as their primary armament and could routinely exceed the speed of sound in level flight.  First-generation fighters were limited to engagements in visual range, and the expected performance of new missiles, like the [[AIM-7 Sparrow]], with [[semi-active radar homing]], forced changes in aircraft design.\n\nThere is not a bright, clearly defined line between first- and second-generation fighters, and some early second-generation fighters, such as the [[F-8 Crusader]], still had guns as their primary armament.  Infrared-guided or so-called \"heat-seeking\" missiles such as the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] and early beam-riding missiles like the [[Kaliningrad K-5]] were used on late first-generation aircraft.\n\n== Experimental first-generation jet fighters ==\n\n=== Northrop XP-79===\nThe [[Northrop XP-79]] [[flying wing]] was an unusual aircraft that only flew once, resulting in the death of the pilot.  It was originally designed as a [[rocket]] powered aircraft but later used turbojets. The pilot was given a prone flying position.\n\n=== Parasite Fighters ===\n{{details|Parasite aircraft}}\nEarly jet fighters did not have the range to escort [[bombers]] all the way to the target and back, the same problem that had beset the USAAF during the early part of the daylight bombing campaigns of [[World War II]].  Having the bomber carry a fighter as well as turrets to defend itself led to some unusual designs, none of which were implemented.\n\n* [[XF-85 Goblin]], carried in the bomb bay.\n* [[FICON project]] using the [[F-84]]\n\n== Aircraft still in use ==\nA few of the aircraft from this generation are still in use by the air forces of smaller nations, typically in the ground attack role and not as [[Fighter Aircraft|fighters]].  A notable mention of this is the [[Shenyang J-5]], a Chinese aircraft developed from the [[MiG-17]], which is used by [[North Korea]] in the ground attack role and in other countries as a trainer.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Fighter aircraft#Jet-powered fighters|Fighter aircraft generations]]\n*[[List of jet aircraft of World War II]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Jet Fighter Generations}}\n\n[[Category:Jet fighter generations|1st generation]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Messerschmitt Me 262 Schwable.jpg|thumb|upright=1.14|The [[Me 262]], the first operational jet fighter and the most well-known of [[World War II|WWII]]]]\n\n'''First generation jet fighters''' are the first attempts at creation of [[fighter aircraft]] using [[jet engines]].  A few were developed during the closing days of [[World War II]] and saw very limited combat operations.  The first [[Jet fighter generations|generation]] can be split into two broad groups, slower craft with straight wings common to World War II era [[fighter aircraft|fighters]] such as the [[Gloster Meteor]], and mature [[swept wing]] designs such as the [[F-86]] used in the [[Korean War]] which are controllable at [[transonic]] speeds.\n\n== World War II era ==\n[[Image:Kikka Orange Blossom Kikka-10.jpg|thumb|The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s 1945 [[Nakajima J9Y|Nakajima J9Y ''Kikka'']].]]\n\nThe initial attempts were straight-winged subsonic planes based heavily on the design concepts that had worked well in [[aircraft engine|piston-powered]] aircraft.  Some of these fighters were tested using piston engines to evaluate the airframes before the jets to power them were available or reliable enough to sustain flight.<ref>Radinger, Will and Schick Walter. Me 262 (in German). Berlin: Avantic Verlag GmbH, 1996. {{ISBN|3-925505-21-0}}, page 23</ref>\n\nThe pioneering airworthy turbojet aircraft, the [[He 178]], was a German [[Conventional landing gear|taildragger]]-geared design that first flew in August 1939.  It was used as the basis of the later [[tricycle landing gear]]ed [[He 280]], a design passed over for the [[Me 262]].  A similar British design, the [[Gloster E.28/39]] had provisions for some armament, but the guns were not fitted on either prototype.\n\nThe [[Bell P-59 Airacomet]] was the first American jet fighter to be put into service. It was never used in combat, as was mainly useful as an experimental fighter as its performance was inferior to the piston-engined [[North American P-51 Mustang]] which could reach higher top speeds and had a much greater range.\n\nJapan had some experimental models, such as the [[Nakajima Kikka|Nakajima ''Kikka'']], but none saw operational use.<ref># Francillon, R\u00e9ne J.

Although the Me 262 is often classified as an early straight-wing design, it actually incorporates some features of a slightly \"[[swept wing]]\" design, as it had a [[leading edge]] sweep of only 18.5\u00b0, too slight to achieve any significant advantage in increasing the [[critical Mach number]], the speed at which it can fly without encountering control problems due to compressibility.<ref name=\"Loftin\">Loftin, L.K. Jr. [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-468/cover.htm ''Quest for Performance: The Evolution of Modern Aircraft''.] ''NASA SP-468''. Retrieved: 22 April 2006.</ref> Sweep was added after the initial design of the aircraft for balance reasons, when the engines proved heavier than originally expected, primarily to position the center of lift properly relative to the center of mass. There was originally a 35\u00b0 sweep, proposed by [[Adolph Busemann]], which was not adopted.<ref>Christopher, John.  ''The Race for Hitler's X-Planes'' (History Press, The Mill, Gloucestershire, 2013, p.48.</ref> Despite its late-war debut into production, the winner of Nazi Germany's ''Volksj\u00e4ger'' light fighter competition, the [[Heinkel He 162]]A ''Spatz''. was just about to enter service with the Luftwaffe's [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War II)|JG 1]] and even the specialist unit [[JV 44]] at the war's end, but only very isolated engagements with Allied combat aircraft \u2014 with JG 1 losing 13 He 162As during April 1945, ten to operational losses not involving combat (the design was still going through its evaluation period) and only a pair of actual losses of He 162As from aerial combat. 320 examples of the He 162A were completed by the war's end, with hundreds more incomplete He 162A airframes in the process of manufacture.\n\n[[World War II]] ended before jet fighters were common.  The [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] also had jet fighters operational before the end of the war.  The British [[Gloster Meteor]] twin-engined high speed fighter was used to intercept Germany's V-1 flying bombs missiles over the British Isles and not deployed for combat over Europe until 1945 but still kept away from occupied territory to prevent the technology being picked up by the Germans or Soviets. By 1946 16 RAF squadrons were equipped with Meteors. The American Lockheed P-80 entered service in the closing phases of the war and was deployed to Europe but arrived too late to see any combat.\n\nThe earliest jet fighters usually did not carry [[radar]] \u2014 except for the handful of [[Messerschmitt Me 262#Variants|Me 262B-1a/U1]] jet night fighters built and deployed in 1944-45 \u2014 or other sophisticated [[avionics]] and had similar equipment to the piston-engined counterparts used during the war.  [[Machine guns]] and [[cannon]] were the primary armament, though the Me 262 also used air-to-air unguided [[R4M|rocket]]s against Allied bomber formations and could carry unguided [[bomb]]s, with many follow-on designs in development on paper or in wind tunnels as the war ended (especially in Germany), like the [[Focke-Wulf Ta 183]].\n\nThe significant operational aircraft in this group include:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: middle\"\n|-\n!

Some of these included a [[swept wing]] and some could break the [[sound barrier]] in a dive, but almost all of them lacked the [[thrust]] to do so in level flight.  [[Radar]] was used in dedicated [[interceptor aircraft|interceptors]] and [[night fighters]] but early models required a dedicated radar operator.  These aircraft are mostly associated with the [[Korean War]].  Some [[interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] designs, such as the [[F-94 Starfire|F-94]] used rockets such as the [[Mk 4/Mk 40 Folding-Fin Aerial Rocket]] as their primary weapon instead of guns.\n\n===Interceptors/Night fighters===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: right\"\n|-\n!

Pulqui II]], a prototype fighter built in [[Argentina]].  The Pulqui II was designed by a team which included former [[Germany|German]] engineers led by [[Kurt Tank]] and was based on initial designs for the [[Focke-Wulf Ta 183]], the proposed successor to the [[Me 262]]. The Pulqui II itself was a successor to the [[I.Ae. 27 Pulqui I]], a prototype jet fighter developed in Argentina by [[Emile Dewoitine]] in the late 1940s and the first of its type to fly in South America.\n\n== The End of the First Generation ==\n\nBy the 1950s, the next major group of fighter aircraft were planes that used [[air-to-air missiles]] as their primary armament and could routinely exceed the speed of sound in level flight.  First-generation fighters were limited to engagements in visual range, and the expected performance of new missiles, like the [[AIM-7 Sparrow]], with [[semi-active radar homing]], forced changes in aircraft design.\n\nThere is not a bright, clearly defined line between first- and second-generation fighters, and some early second-generation fighters, such as the [[F-8 Crusader]], still had guns as their primary armament.  Infrared-guided or so-called \"heat-seeking\" missiles such as the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] and early beam-riding missiles like the [[Kaliningrad K-5]] were used on late first-generation aircraft.\n\n== Experimental first-generation jet fighters ==\n\n=== Northrop XP-79===\nThe [[Northrop XP-79]] [[flying wing]] was an unusual aircraft that only flew once, resulting in the death of the pilot.  It was originally designed as a [[rocket]] powered aircraft but later used turbojets. The pilot was given a prone flying position.\n\n=== Parasite Fighters ===\n{{details|Parasite aircraft}}\nEarly jet fighters did not have the range to escort [[bombers]] all the way to the target and back, the same problem that had beset the USAAF during the early part of the daylight bombing campaigns of [[World War II]].  Having the bomber carry a fighter as well as turrets to defend itself led to some unusual designs, none of which were implemented.\n\n* [[XF-85 Goblin]], carried in the bomb bay.\n* [[FICON project]] using the [[F-84]]\n\n== Aircraft still in use ==\nA few of the aircraft from this generation are still in use by the air forces of smaller nations, typically in the ground attack role and not as [[Fighter Aircraft|fighters]].  A notable mention of this is the [[Shenyang J-5]], a Chinese aircraft developed from the [[MiG-17]], which is used by [[North Korea]] in the ground attack role and in other countries as a trainer.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Fighter aircraft#Jet-powered fighters|Fighter aircraft generations]]\n*[[List of jet aircraft of World War II]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Jet Fighter Generations}}\n\n[[Category:Jet fighter generations|1st generation]]\n", "name_user": "2001:8003:55ab:1500:b1ca:52f9:c5d1:fef6", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-generation_jet_fighter"}
