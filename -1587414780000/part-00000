It was a [[vigesimal]] (base-20) [[positional notation|positional]]  [[numeral system]]. The numerals are made up of three symbols; [[Zero number#The Americas|zero]] ([[Turtle shell|shell]] shape, with the [[Turtle shell#Plastron|plastron]] uppermost), [[1 (number)|one]] (a dot) and [[5 (number)|five]] (a bar).  For example, thirteen is written as three dots in a horizontal row above two horizontal bars; sometimes it is also written as three vertical dots to the left of two vertical bars.  With these three symbols each of the twenty vigesimal digits could be written.\n\n{| align=\"left\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin-right:10px;\"\n|-\n|400s\n| \n| {{Horizontal Maya|1}}\n| {{Horizontal Maya|12}}\n|- \n| 20s\n| {{Horizontal Maya|1}}\n| {{Horizontal Maya|1}}\n| {{Horizontal Maya|16}}\n|-\n| 1s\n| {{Horizontal Maya|13}}\n| {{Horizontal Maya|9}}\n| {{Horizontal Maya|5}}\n|-\n|\n| 33\n| 429\n| 5125\n|}\nNumbers after 19 were written vertically in powers of twenty.

The first dot represents \"one twenty\" or \"1\u00d720\", which is added to three dots and two bars, or thirteen. Therefore, (1\u00d720) + 13 = 33. Upon reaching 20<sup>2</sup> or 400, another row is started (20<sup>3</sup> or 8000, then 20<sup>4</sup> or 160,000, and so on). The number 429 would be written as one dot above one dot above four dots and a bar, or (1\u00d720<sup>2</sup>) + (1\u00d720<sup>1</sup>) + 9 = 429. \n\nOther than the bar and dot notation, Maya numerals were sometimes illustrated by face type glyphs or pictures.

The case also had a significant impact on [[historic preservation]].\n\n==Facts==\nThe basis for dispute arose when the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Archbishop]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Antonio|San Antonio]], [[Patrick Flores]], applied for a building permit to enlarge the 1923 mission-style St. Peter's Church in [[Boerne, Texas]], which was originally built by German residents.<ref>Miller, Julia. \"U.S. Supreme Court Declares RFRA Unconstitutional in Texas Religious Landmarking Case,\" Preservation Law Reporter (PLR) 16, p. 1053</ref> The building was located in a historic district and considered a [[contributing property]]. Local zoning authorities denied the permit, citing an ordinance governing additions and new construction in a historic district. The Archbishop brought suit, challenging the ruling under the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]] (RFRA) of 1993. Flores argued that his congregation had outgrown the existing structure, rendering the ruling a substantial burden on the free exercise of religion without a compelling state interest.<ref name=\"PLR 16, p.1053\">PLR 16, p.1053</ref>\n\n==Religious Freedom Restoration Act==\nRFRA had been crafted as a direct response to the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Employment Division v.

(42 U.S. Code \u00a7 2000bb\u20133) Congress' power to do so was not challenged. Congress also applied the law to state and local governments, the City of Boerne in this case, relying on the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], particularly Section 5: \"The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.\"\n\n==Result==\n\n===District Court===\nThe City of Boerne was successful at the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Texas]]; the District Judge certified the question of the constitutionality of RFRA to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]], which found the RFRA constitutional.  Boerne filed a ''[[certiorari]]'' petition to the Supreme Court.<ref name=\"Mauro, Tony. p.38\"/> The National Trust for Historic Preservation, among other preservation organizations, filed briefs in support of Boerne.<ref name=\"PLR 16, p.1053\"/>\n\n===Supreme Court===\nThe Court, in an opinion by Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]], struck down RFRA as it applies to the states as an unconstitutional use of Congress's enforcement powers. The Court held that it holds the sole power to define the substantive rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment&mdash;a definition to which Congress may not add and from which it may not subtract. Congress could not constitutionally enact RFRA because the law was not designed to have \"congruence and proportionality\" with the substantive rights that the Court had defined. Although Congress could enact \"remedial\" or \"preventative\" legislation to guarantee rights not exactly congruent with those defined by the Court, it could only do so in order to more effectively prevent, deter, or correct violations of those rights actually guaranteed by the Court. RFRA was seen disproportionate in its effects compared to its objective. Justice Kennedy wrote:\n{{quote|Congress' power under \u00a7 5, however, extends only to \"enforc[ing]\" the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court has described the power as \"remedial.\" The design of the Amendment and the text of \u00a7 5 are inconsistent with the suggestion that Congress has the power to decree the substance of the Fourteenth Amendment's restrictions on the States. Legislation which alters the meaning of the Free Exercise Clause cannot be said to be enforcing the Clause. Congress does not enforce a constitutional right by changing what the right is. It has been given the power \"to enforce,\" not the power to determine what constitutes a constitutional violation. Were it not so, what Congress would be enforcing would no longer be, in any meaningful sense, the \"provisions of [the Fourteenth Amendment].\" (citations omitted)}}\n\nMoreover, remedial or prophylactic legislation still had to show \"congruence and proportionality\" between the end it aimed to reach (that is, the violations it aimed to correct), and the means it chose to reach those ends&mdash;that is, the penalties or prohibitions it enacted to prevent or correct those violations. Because RFRA was not reasonably remedial or preventative, it was unconstitutional.\n\n==Implications==\n===Congruence and proportionality===\n''Boerne'' is important for several reasons. One is that it introduced a completely new test for deciding whether Congress had exceeded its Section 5 powers: the \"congruence and proportionality\" test, a test that has proven to have great importance in the context of the [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eleventh Amendment]]. Another reason was that it explicitly declared that the Court alone has the ability to state which rights are protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. Still another was that it had First Amendment consequences in that it spelled the end for any legislative attempts to overturn ''[[Employment Division v. Smith]]''.\n\nThe \"congruence and proportionality\" requirement replaced the previous theory advanced in ''[[Katzenbach v. Morgan]]'' that  the Equal Protection Clause is \"a positive grant of legislative power authorizing Congress to exercise its discretion in determining the need for and nature of legislation to secure Fourteenth Amendment guarantees.\" Before the 1997 ''Boerne'' decision, ''Katzenbach v. Morgan'' was often interpreted as allowing Congress to go beyond, but not fall short of, the Court's interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause.\nBut that is not how the majority opinion in ''Boerne'' interpreted ''Katzenbach'':\n\n{{quote|There is language in our opinion in Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641 (1966), which could be interpreted as acknowledging a power in Congress to enact legislation that expands the rights contained in \u00a7 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment. This is not a necessary interpretation, however, or even the best one....  If Congress could define its own powers by altering the Fourteenth Amendment's meaning, no longer would the Constitution be \"superior paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary means.\"}}\n\nThe holding of ''Boerne'' said that only the Court could interpret the Constitution, in order to maintain the \"traditional separation of powers between Congress and the Judiciary.\" Also, ''Boerne'' relied on arguments for protecting the rights that pertain to state governments<ref>To support its argument that Congress lacked plenary power to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Court pointed to a proposed enforcement provision which was rejected by the Congress that eventually approved the Fourteenth Amendment: \n:\"Democrats and conservative Republicans argued that the proposed Amendment would give Congress a power to intrude into traditional areas of state responsibility, a power inconsistent with the federal design central to the Constitution. Typifying these views, Republican Representative Robert Hale of New York labeled the Amendment 'an utter departure from every principle ever dreamed of by the men who framed our Constitution,' and warned that under it 'all State legislation, in its codes of civil and criminal jurisprudence and procedures \u2026 may be overridden, may be repealed or abolished, and the law of Congress established instead.'  Senator William Stewart of Nevada likewise stated the Amendment would permit 'Congress to legislate fully upon all subjects affecting life, liberty, and property,' such that 'there would not be much left for the State Legislatures,' and would thereby 'work an entire change in our form of government.'\"\n521 U.S. at 521 (citations omitted).</ref> based on \"enumerated powers.\" The intent of ''Boerne'' was to prevent \"a considerable congressional intrusion into the States' traditional prerogatives and general authority.\" The holding of ''Boerne'' specifically mentioned the state action doctrine of the ''Civil Rights Cases'' as a Court interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause that limits the \"remedial or preventive\" power of Congress.\n\n===Constitutionality of the RFRA===\nThis case has been used to claim that the federal RFRA is \"unconstitutional\".<ref>{{cite web | last=Napolitano | first=Andrew | title=Indiana and the Constitution | url=http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/02/indiana-and-constitution/}}</ref> A more precise and accurate phrasing of this claim is that Boerne held the RFRA could not be constitutionally applied to state and local governments. At the federal level, the RFRA remains operative. The constitutionality of one aspect of RFRA as applied to the federal government was confirmed on February 21, 2006, as the Supreme Court ruled against the government in ''[[Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal]]'', {{Ussc|546|418|2006}}, which involved the use of an otherwise illegal substance in a religious ceremony, stating that the federal government must show a compelling state interest in restricting religious conduct.\n\n===Historic preservation===\nThe Supreme Court's decision in ''City of Boerne'' made a significant impact on the states' abilities to enforce laws, including those pertaining to historic preservation.

Flores''''', 521 U.S. 507 (1997), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case concerning the scope of [[US Congress|Congress]]'s [[congressional power of enforcement|power of enforcement]] under Section 5 of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. The case also had a significant impact on [[historic preservation]].\n\n==Facts==\nThe basis for dispute arose when the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Archbishop]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Antonio|San Antonio]], [[Patrick Flores]], applied for a building permit to enlarge his 1923 mission-style St. Peter's Church in [[Boerne, Texas]].<ref>Miller, Julia. \"U.S. Supreme Court Declares RFRA Unconstitutional in Texas Religious Landmarking Case,\" Preservation Law Reporter (PLR) 16, p. 1053</ref> The building was located in a historic district and considered a [[contributing property]]. Local zoning authorities denied the permit, citing an ordinance governing additions and new construction in a historic district. The Archbishop brought suit, challenging the ruling under the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]] (RFRA) of 1993. Flores argued that his congregation had outgrown the existing structure, rendering the ruling a substantial burden on the free exercise of religion without a compelling state interest.<ref name=\"PLR 16, p.1053\">PLR 16, p.1053</ref>\n\n==Religious Freedom Restoration Act==\nRFRA had been crafted as a direct response to the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Employment Division v. Smith]]'',<ref>{{ussc|name=Employment Division v. Smith|link=|volume=494|page=872|pin=|year=1990}}.</ref> when the Court had upheld, against a [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] challenge, an [[Oregon]] law criminalizing [[peyote]] use, which was used in [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] religious rituals.<ref>Mauro, Tony.

(42 U.S. Code \u00a7 2000bb\u20133) Congress' power to do so was not challenged. Congress also applied the law to state and local governments, the City of Boerne in this case, relying on the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], particularly Section 5: \"The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.\"\n\n==Result==\n\n===District Court===\nThe City of Boerne was successful at the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Texas]]; the District Judge certified the question of the constitutionality of RFRA to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]], which found the RFRA constitutional.  Boerne filed a ''[[certiorari]]'' petition to the Supreme Court.<ref name=\"Mauro, Tony. p.38\"/> The National Trust for Historic Preservation, among other preservation organizations, filed briefs in support of Boerne.<ref name=\"PLR 16, p.1053\"/>\n\n===Supreme Court===\nThe Court, in an opinion by Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]], struck down RFRA as it applies to the states as an unconstitutional use of Congress's enforcement powers. The Court held that it holds the sole power to define the substantive rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment&mdash;a definition to which Congress may not add and from which it may not subtract. Congress could not constitutionally enact RFRA because the law was not designed to have \"congruence and proportionality\" with the substantive rights that the Court had defined. Although Congress could enact \"remedial\" or \"preventative\" legislation to guarantee rights not exactly congruent with those defined by the Court, it could only do so in order to more effectively prevent, deter, or correct violations of those rights actually guaranteed by the Court. RFRA was seen disproportionate in its effects compared to its objective. Justice Kennedy wrote:\n{{quote|Congress' power under \u00a7 5, however, extends only to \"enforc[ing]\" the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court has described the power as \"remedial.\" The design of the Amendment and the text of \u00a7 5 are inconsistent with the suggestion that Congress has the power to decree the substance of the Fourteenth Amendment's restrictions on the States. Legislation which alters the meaning of the Free Exercise Clause cannot be said to be enforcing the Clause. Congress does not enforce a constitutional right by changing what the right is. It has been given the power \"to enforce,\" not the power to determine what constitutes a constitutional violation. Were it not so, what Congress would be enforcing would no longer be, in any meaningful sense, the \"provisions of [the Fourteenth Amendment].\" (citations omitted)}}\n\nMoreover, remedial or prophylactic legislation still had to show \"congruence and proportionality\" between the end it aimed to reach (that is, the violations it aimed to correct), and the means it chose to reach those ends&mdash;that is, the penalties or prohibitions it enacted to prevent or correct those violations. Because RFRA was not reasonably remedial or preventative, it was unconstitutional.\n\n==Implications==\n===Congruence and proportionality===\n''Boerne'' is important for several reasons. One is that it introduced a completely new test for deciding whether Congress had exceeded its Section 5 powers: the \"congruence and proportionality\" test, a test that has proven to have great importance in the context of the [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eleventh Amendment]]. Another reason was that it explicitly declared that the Court alone has the ability to state which rights are protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. Still another was that it had First Amendment consequences in that it spelled the end for any legislative attempts to overturn ''[[Employment Division v. Smith]]''.\n\nThe \"congruence and proportionality\" requirement replaced the previous theory advanced in ''[[Katzenbach v. Morgan]]'' that  the Equal Protection Clause is \"a positive grant of legislative power authorizing Congress to exercise its discretion in determining the need for and nature of legislation to secure Fourteenth Amendment guarantees.\" Before the 1997 ''Boerne'' decision, ''Katzenbach v. Morgan'' was often interpreted as allowing Congress to go beyond, but not fall short of, the Court's interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause.\nBut that is not how the majority opinion in ''Boerne'' interpreted ''Katzenbach'':\n\n{{quote|There is language in our opinion in Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641 (1966), which could be interpreted as acknowledging a power in Congress to enact legislation that expands the rights contained in \u00a7 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment. This is not a necessary interpretation, however, or even the best one....  If Congress could define its own powers by altering the Fourteenth Amendment's meaning, no longer would the Constitution be \"superior paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary means.\"}}\n\nThe holding of ''Boerne'' said that only the Court could interpret the Constitution, in order to maintain the \"traditional separation of powers between Congress and the Judiciary.\" Also, ''Boerne'' relied on arguments for protecting the rights that pertain to state governments<ref>To support its argument that Congress lacked plenary power to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Court pointed to a proposed enforcement provision which was rejected by the Congress that eventually approved the Fourteenth Amendment: \n:\"Democrats and conservative Republicans argued that the proposed Amendment would give Congress a power to intrude into traditional areas of state responsibility, a power inconsistent with the federal design central to the Constitution. Typifying these views, Republican Representative Robert Hale of New York labeled the Amendment 'an utter departure from every principle ever dreamed of by the men who framed our Constitution,' and warned that under it 'all State legislation, in its codes of civil and criminal jurisprudence and procedures \u2026 may be overridden, may be repealed or abolished, and the law of Congress established instead.'  Senator William Stewart of Nevada likewise stated the Amendment would permit 'Congress to legislate fully upon all subjects affecting life, liberty, and property,' such that 'there would not be much left for the State Legislatures,' and would thereby 'work an entire change in our form of government.'\"\n521 U.S. at 521 (citations omitted).</ref> based on \"enumerated powers.\" The intent of ''Boerne'' was to prevent \"a considerable congressional intrusion into the States' traditional prerogatives and general authority.\" The holding of ''Boerne'' specifically mentioned the state action doctrine of the ''Civil Rights Cases'' as a Court interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause that limits the \"remedial or preventive\" power of Congress.\n\n===Constitutionality of the RFRA===\nThis case has been used to claim that the federal RFRA is \"unconstitutional\".<ref>{{cite web | last=Napolitano | first=Andrew | title=Indiana and the Constitution | url=http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/04/02/indiana-and-constitution/}}</ref> A more precise and accurate phrasing of this claim is that Boerne held the RFRA could not be constitutionally applied to state and local governments. At the federal level, the RFRA remains operative. The constitutionality of one aspect of RFRA as applied to the federal government was confirmed on February 21, 2006, as the Supreme Court ruled against the government in ''[[Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal]]'', {{Ussc|546|418|2006}}, which involved the use of an otherwise illegal substance in a religious ceremony, stating that the federal government must show a compelling state interest in restricting religious conduct.\n\n===Historic preservation===\nThe Supreme Court's decision in ''City of Boerne'' made a significant impact on the states' abilities to enforce laws, including those pertaining to historic preservation. Under RFRA, an otherwise neutral state law&mdash;such as zoning, or historic preservation ordinances&mdash;needed to be scrutinized if its enforcement involved a religious group or individual. Therefore, by declaring extension of RFRA to apply against state laws unconstitutional, the ability of the states to establish and maintain historic preservation ordinances was made easier.<ref>PLR 16, p. 1052.</ref>  However, in 2000, Congress enacted the [[Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act]], in which it used the [[Spending Clause]] to require, for localities that receive federal funding, land use laws to accommodate religious freedom, essentially, as if RFRA had been ruled applicable to state law.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 521]]\n* [[List of United States Supreme Court cases]]\n* [[Lists of United States Supreme Court cases by volume]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |title=The Constitution & Religion: Leading Supreme Court Cases on Church and State |last=Alley |first=Robert S. |authorlink= |year=1999 |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Amherst, NY |isbn=978-1-57392-703-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/constitutionreli0000unse/page/515 515&ndash;535] |url=https://archive.org/details/constitutionreli0000unse/page/515 }}\n* {{Cite journal | last = McAward | first = Jennifer Mason | title = The scope of Congress's Thirteenth Amendment enforcement power after ''City of Boerne v.

According to the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]], two tenth-century kings were consecrated  in Kingston: [[\u00c6thelstan]] (925), and [[\u00c6thelred the Unready]] (978). There are certain other kings who are said to have been crowned there, but for whom the evidence (including the writings of [[Florence of Worcester]] and [[Ralph de Diceto]]) is less substantial: [[Edward the Elder]] (902), [[Edmund I]] (939), [[Eadred]] (946), [[Eadwig]] (956), [[Edgar the Peaceful]] (circa 960) and [[Edward the Martyr]] (975). It was later thought that the coronations were conducted in the chapel of St Mary, which collapsed in 1730. Tradition dating to the 18th century holds that a [[Coronation Stone, Kingston upon Thames|large stone]] recovered from the ruins played a part in the coronations. It was initially used as a mounting block, but in 1850 it was moved to a more dignified place in the market before finally being moved to its current location in the grounds of the [[Kingston upon Thames Guildhall|Guildhall]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Foot |first=Sarah |authorlink=Sarah Foot |year=2011 |title=\u00c6thelstan: the first king of England |place= |publisher=Yale University Press |page=74 |isbn=978-0-300-12535-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Simon |last=Keynes |authorlink=Simon Keynes |encyclopedia=The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England |year=1999 |article=Kingston-upon-Thames |editor=Michael Lapidge |display-editors=etal |isbn=978-0-6312-2492-1 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |page=272}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Butters |first1=Shaan |title=The Book of Kingston |publisher=Baron |isbn=0860235629 |year=1995 |pages=29\u201330, 184 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Hilliam |first1=David |title=Crown, Orb and Sceptre: The True Stories of English Coronations |url=https://books.google.com/?id=fKYTDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT13&lpg=PT13&dq=how+many+kings+were+crowned+in+kingston#v=onepage |website=Google Books |date=16 September 2011 |publisher=The History Press |isbn=9780752470795 |accessdate=25 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Economic development===\nFor much of the 20th century, Kingston was a major military aircraft manufacturing centre specialising in fighter aircraft \u2013 first with [[Sopwith Aviation]], H G Hawker Engineering, later [[Hawker Aircraft]], [[Hawker Siddeley]] and eventually [[British Aerospace]].

Other charters were issued by later kings, including [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV's]] charter that gave the town the status of a [[ancient borough|borough]] in 1481.\n\nThe borough covered a much smaller area than the ancient parish, although as new parishes were split off the borough and parish eventually became identical in 1894. The borough was reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], becoming the [[Municipal Borough of Kingston-upon-Thames]] (then spelt with hyphens).

Its former area was merged with that of the [[Municipal Borough of Surbiton]] and the [[Municipal Borough of Malden and Coombe]], to form the [[London Borough of Kingston upon Thames]]. At the request of [[Kingston upon Thames London Borough Council]] another Royal Charter was granted by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] entitling it to continue using the title \"Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames\" for the new borough.\n\n===Urban development===\n[[File:Clattern.JPG|thumb|The Hogsmill flowing under [[Clattern Bridge]] in Kingston.

There is a record of a council held there in 838, at which [[Egbert of Wessex]], King of Wessex, and his son [[Ethelwulf of Wessex]] were present. In the Domesday Book it was held by [[William the Conqueror]].

The daughter survived this accident and was her father's successor as sexton. Kingston sent members to early [[Parliament of England|Parliament]]s, until a petition by the inhabitants prayed to be relieved from the burden. Another chapel, the collegiate chapel of St Mary Magdalene, The Lovekyn Chapel, still exists. It was founded in 1309 by a former mayor of London, [[Edward Lovekyn]]. It is the only private chantry chapel to survive the [[English Reformation|Reformation]].{{sfn|Malden|1967|pp=125\u2013127}}\n\nWith the coming of the railway in the 1830s, there was much building development to the south of the town.

Recent developments along the riverside south of Kingston Bridge have added bars, restaurants and a theatre, the [[Rose Theatre, Kingston|Rose Theatre]] which opened in 2008 with [[Peter Hall (theatre director)|Sir Peter Hall]] as the director.\n\nThe ancient market is still held daily in the Market Place, including today such produce as fish, jewellery, exotic foods, local foods and flowers.\n\nKingston's civic buildings include [[Kingston Museum]], [[public library]], modern [[Crown Court]] and smaller [[county court]] and [[Kingston upon Thames Guildhall|the Guildhall]] by the part-[[culvert]]ed mouth of the [[Hogsmill River]] which houses [[Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames|Kingston Council]] and [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]]. A short distance away is the [[County Hall (Surrey, UK)|County Hall]] Building which houses the main offices of [[Surrey County Council]]. From 1893 to 1965, before Kingston became one of the 32 [[London borough]]s of [[Greater London]], it was the county town of Surrey following the period of 1791\u20131893 when [[Newington, London|Newington]] had this role.

It is where the comic [[Victorian literature|Victorian]] novel ''[[Three Men in a Boat]]'' by [[Jerome K. Jerome]] begins; cannons aimed against the Martians in [[H. G. Wells]]' ''The War of the Worlds'' are positioned on Kingston Hill; in ''The Rainbow'' by [[D. H. Lawrence]] the youngest Brangwen dreams of a job in Kingston upon Thames in a long, lyrical passage; Mr. Knightly in ''Emma'' by [[Jane Austen]] regularly visits Kingston, although the narrative never follows him there.\n\nFine art is also a prominent feature in the history of Kingston. Both [[John Hoyland]] and [[Jeremy Moon (artist)|Jeremy Moon]] worked from permanent studios in Kingston and many prominent artists and designers have studied at the university including [[Fiona Banner]], [[John Bratby]], [[David Nash (artist)|David Nash]] and [[Jasper Morrison]].\n\nEarly in his music career, the guitarist and singer-songwriter [[Eric Clapton]] spent time [[Street performance|busking]] in Kingston upon Thames,<ref>[http://www.ericclapton.com/eric-clapton-biography?page=0%2C1 Biography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515233905/http://www.ericclapton.com/eric-clapton-biography?page=0%2C1 |date=15 May 2013 }}.

More recently, a scene from ''Mujhse Dosti Karoge'', a [[Bollywood]] film starring [[Hrithik Roshan]] as the leading actor, was filmed by the toppled telephone boxes sculpture in Old London Road. A scene in the television programme ''[[The Good Life (1975 TV series)|The Good Life]]'' sees [[Richard Briers]] get on a 71 bus in 'The Avenue' towards Kingston town centre (albeit this route never served the east side of Surbiton where the series is set). The 1974 [[Doctor Who]] story \"[[Invasion of the Dinosaurs]]\" used several locations in the town for filming.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwholocations.net/stories/invasionofthedinosaurs |title=Invasion of the Dinosaurs \u2013 Story Locations \u2013 The Locations Guide to Doctor Who, Torchwood and The Sarah Jane Adventures |publisher=Doctorwholocations.net |accessdate=14 July 2017}}</ref> The 2008 series of ''[[Primeval (TV series)|Primeval]]'', shown on ITV1 in January, featured almost an entire episode filmed inside the [[Bentalls|Bentall Centre]] and [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]] department stores. Kingston featured in ''Primeval'' again in May 2009 with several scenes shot in and around the Market Place. [[Nipper]], the famous \"His Master's Voice\" ([[HMV]]) dog, is buried in the town under Lloyds Bank. His owners lived nearby in Fife Road.\n\nKingston Green Fair was held annually from 1987 to 2008 in Canbury Gardens, next to the river, on the Spring [[Bank Holiday]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kingstononline.co.uk/kingston-green-fair-on-the-banks-of-the-rver-thames/|title=Kingston Green Fair on the banks of the Thames|work=Kingston Online}}</ref> The word \"Green\" in the title refers to the ethos of the fair as promoting [[sustainable development]].

There are up to four trains an hour Monday - Saturday during off-peak hours. Three railway stations serve the town on this line from [[London Waterloo railway station|London Waterloo]]: [[Kingston railway station (London)|Kingston]], {{rws|Norbiton}} and {{rws|Hampton Wick}}. Norbiton is east of the town centre near [[Kingston Hospital]], and Hampton Wick is to the west across Kingston Bridge. {{rws|New Malden}}, [[Wimbledon station|Wimbledon]] and [[Richmond station (London)|Richmond upon Thames]] are on the lines. \n\nA primary stop exists on the nearby main (express) line in nearby {{rws|Surbiton}} which has a peak hour non-stopping service to London Waterloo. The town led to the [[South Western Main Line]] being in Surbiton as much of Kingston's wealth and status were as a direct consequence of the road and stagecoach network developed as a result of its crossing on the Thames. Local landowners would not consent to the line coming through their land so in 1838 the rail station was built a few miles out at Surbiton, which was known as ''Kingston Upon Railway'' and led to the development of [[Surbiton]]. Kingston recognised the need for a railway, and in the 1860s [[Kingston railway station (London)|Kingston]] opened. However, due to the eastern landowners' resistance, the line had to take a longer route via [[Richmond station (London)|Richmond upon Thames]]. Only later did the line receive all the relevant permissions for a closer link, connecting to London Waterloo via {{rws|Norbiton}}.\n\nThe [[A3 road]] runs from central London towards Kingston before by-passing the town to the east. The \"Kingston bypass road\" was one of the first arterial roads to be built in Britain. It was originally proposed in 1912 to relieve the pressure of traffic in the town centre, but World War I delayed the start of work until 1924. It was opened by Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] on 28 October 1927. Kingston is also served by the [[A240 road|A240]], [[A307 road|the A307 (Portsmouth Road)]], [[A308 road|A308]] and [[A310 road|A310]].\n\nKingston has a large number of car parks, connected by a [[one-way system]]. It is also one of the main centres of the south-west London bus network.\n\nCompared with other outer London boroughs and towns in Surrey, a high proportion of trips are made by bicycle in Kingston. The [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]] recorded that 2.8% of journeys to work were made by bicycle.<ref>[https://www.kingston.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/2238/economic_baseline.pdf ''kingston.gov.uk'']</ref>\n\nRiverboats run regularly between Kingston and [[Hampton Court]] as well as [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] all during the summer season. There are also direct services to [[Putney]] and Westminster from Hampton Court connected by the 10\u201315-minute interval [[London Buses route 111|route 111]] to [[Heathrow Central bus station|London Heathrow]], the destination for [[London Buses route X26|X26]], an express service also serving the bus station and the Bentall Centre. Local buses, many of which call or terminate at the Cromwell Road or Fairfield bus stations, link the town with nearby residential districts and other towns in neighbouring boroughs.\n\n==Education==\n{{main|List of schools in Kingston upon Thames}}\n[[File:Universit\u00e4t Kingston.jpg|thumb|[[Kingston University]] main building, Penrhyn Road campus]]\n[[File:Tiffin School.jpg|thumb|Tiffin School]]\nKingston is the location of [[Kingston University]] and [[Kingston College (England)|Kingston College]].

It also has a Quaker meeting house, a Mosque and a Sikh [[Gurdwara]].\n\nLady Booth Road, formally Fairfield Road, is named to commemorate the former location of the [[Salvation Army]] citadel.\n\n==Sport==\nKingston is the home of four association football clubs, [[AFC Wimbledon]] who play at the [[Kingsmeadow]] Stadium, [[Corinthian-Casuals F.C.|Corinthian-Casuals]] and [[Kingstonian F.C.|Kingstonian]] who play in [[Tolworth]] and [[Chessington & Hook United F.C.|Chessington & Hook United]] who play in [[Chessington]].

This stadium boasts a 400m track which is floodlit, a gym and 5-a-side football facilities. In the 2013 season the men competed in Division 3 of the [[British Athletics League]]. Kingston Rugby Club is based on the outskirts of the town, and [[Kingston Rowing Club]] is based on the River Thames. [[Kingston Regatta]] takes place on the river at the town in July.\n\nThe town has a large leisure centre next to Fairfield named the Kingfisher Centre, which contains an indoor swimming pool and gymnasium. Sport in Kingston is promoted and encouraged by Sport Kingston, an organisation funded by the Royal Borough of Kingston.\n\n[[Kingston Wildcats]] '''School of Basketball''' is a community [[basketball]] development club that practices and plays its home fixtures at Chessington Community College, competing in the Surrey League and Basketball England National League.\n\n==London 2012 Summer Olympics==\n[[File:Bradley Wiggins 2012 Olympic time trial.jpg|thumb|alt=Racing cyclist.|Bradley Wiggins riding towards central Kingston on 1 August 2012.]]\nThe borough was the setting for four cycling events during the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], the [[Cycling at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's individual road race|men's road race]], [[Cycling at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's individual road race|women's road race]], [[Cycling at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's road time trial|men's road time trial]] and [[Cycling at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's road time trial|women's road time trial]].

According to the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]], two tenth-century kings were consecrated  in Kingston: [[\u00c6thelstan]] (925), and [[\u00c6thelred the Unready]] (978). There are certain other kings who are said to have been crowned there, but for whom the evidence (including the writings of [[Florence of Worcester]] and [[Ralph de Diceto]]) is less substantial: [[Edward the Elder]] (902), [[Edmund I]] (939), [[Eadred]] (946), [[Eadwig]] (956), [[Edgar the Peaceful]] (circa 960) and [[Edward the Martyr]] (975). It was later thought that the coronations were conducted in the chapel of St Mary, which collapsed in 1730. Tradition dating to the 18th century holds that a [[Coronation Stone, Kingston upon Thames|large stone]] recovered from the ruins played a part in the coronations. It was initially used as a mounting block, but in 1850 it was moved to a more dignified place in the market before finally being moved to its current location in the grounds of the [[Kingston upon Thames Guildhall|Guildhall]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Foot |first=Sarah |authorlink=Sarah Foot |year=2011 |title=\u00c6thelstan: the first king of England |place= |publisher=Yale University Press |page=74 |isbn=978-0-300-12535-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Simon |last=Keynes |authorlink=Simon Keynes |encyclopedia=The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England |year=1999 |article=Kingston-upon-Thames |editor=Michael Lapidge |display-editors=etal |isbn=978-0-6312-2492-1 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |page=272}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Butters |first1=Shaan |title=The Book of Kingston |publisher=Baron |isbn=0860235629 |year=1995 |pages=29\u201330, 184 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Hilliam |first1=David |title=Crown, Orb and Sceptre: The True Stories of English Coronations |url=https://books.google.com/?id=fKYTDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT13&lpg=PT13&dq=how+many+kings+were+crowned+in+kingston#v=onepage |website=Google Books |date=16 September 2011 |publisher=The History Press |isbn=9780752470795 |accessdate=25 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Economic development===\nFor much of the 20th century, Kingston was a major military aircraft manufacturing centre specialising in fighter aircraft \u2013 first with [[Sopwith Aviation]], H G Hawker Engineering, later [[Hawker Aircraft]], [[Hawker Siddeley]] and eventually [[British Aerospace]].

The borough was reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], becoming the [[Municipal Borough of Kingston-upon-Thames]] (then spelt with hyphens).

Its former area was merged with that of the [[Municipal Borough of Surbiton]] and the [[Municipal Borough of Malden and Coombe]], to form the [[London Borough of Kingston upon Thames]].

The daughter survived this accident and was her father's successor as sexton. Kingston sent members to early [[Parliament of England|Parliament]]s, until a petition by the inhabitants prayed to be relieved from the burden. Another chapel, the collegiate chapel of St Mary Magdalene, The Lovekyn Chapel, still exists. It was founded in 1309 by a former mayor of London, [[Edward Lovekyn]].

There are up to four trains an hour Monday - Saturday during off-peak hours. Three railway stations serve the town on this line from [[London Waterloo railway station|London Waterloo]]: [[Kingston railway station (London)|Kingston]], {{rws|Norbiton}} and {{rws|Hampton Wick}}. Norbiton is east of the town centre near [[Kingston Hospital]], and Hampton Wick is to the west across Kingston Bridge. {{rws|New Malden}}, [[Wimbledon station|Wimbledon]] and [[Richmond station (London)|Richmond upon Thames]] are on the lines. \n\nA primary stop exists on the nearby main (express) line in nearby {{rws|Surbiton}} which has a peak hour non-stopping service to London Waterloo. The town led to the [[South Western Main Line]] being in Surbiton as much of Kingston's wealth and status were as a direct consequence of the road and stagecoach network developed as a result of its crossing on the Thames. Local landowners would not consent to the line coming through their land so in 1838 the rail station was built a few miles out at Surbiton, which was known as ''Kingston Upon Railway'' and led to the development of [[Surbiton]]. Kingston recognised the need for a railway, and in the 1860s [[Kingston railway station (London)|Kingston]] opened. However, due to the eastern landowners' resistance, the line had to take a longer route via [[Richmond station (London)|Richmond upon Thames]]. Only later did the line receive all the relevant permissions for a closer link, connecting to London Waterloo via {{rws|Norbiton}}.\n\nThe [[A3 road]] runs from central London towards Kingston before by-passing the town to the east. The \"Kingston bypass road\" was one of the first arterial roads to be built in Britain. It was originally proposed in 1912 to relieve the pressure of traffic in the town centre, but World War I delayed the start of work until 1924.
