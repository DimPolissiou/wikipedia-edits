The word count for a plot is usually 400-700 words. -->\nIn October 2003, 19-year-old [[Harvard University]] student [[Mark Zuckerberg]] is dumped by his girlfriend Erica Albright. Returning to his dorm, Zuckerberg writes an insulting entry about Albright on his [[LiveJournal]] blog. He creates a campus website called [[Facemash]] by hacking into college databases to steal photos of female students, then allowing site visitors to rate their attractiveness. After traffic to the site crashes parts of Harvard's computer network, Zuckerberg is given six months of [[academic probation]]. However, Facemash's popularity attracts the attention of Harvard upperclassmen and twins [[Cameron Winklevoss|Cameron]] and [[Tyler Winklevoss]] and their business partner [[Divya Narendra]]. The trio invites [https://www.letsdiskuss.com/who-is-a-better-visionary-mark-zuckerberg-or-elon-musk Zuckerberg] to work on [[Harvard Connection]], a social network featuring the exclusive nature of Harvard students and aimed at dating.\n\nZuckerberg approaches his friend [[Eduardo Saverin]] with an idea for Thefacebook<!--the original name and spelling-->, a [[Social networking service|social networking]] website that would be exclusive to [[Ivy League]] students. Saverin provides $1,000 in seed funding, allowing Zuckerberg to build the website, which quickly becomes popular. When they learn of Thefacebook'','' the Winklevoss twins and Narendra are incensed, believing that Zuckerberg stole their idea while keeping them in the dark by stalling on developing the Harvard Connection website. They raise their complaint with Harvard President [[Larry Summers]], who is dismissive and sees no value in either disciplinary action or Thefacebook.\n\nSaverin and Zuckerberg meet fellow student Christy Lee, who asks them to \"Facebook me\", a phrase which impresses them. As Thefacebook grows in popularity, Zuckerberg extends the network to [[Yale University]], [[Columbia University]] and [[Stanford University]]. Lee arranges for Saverin and Zuckerberg to meet [[Napster]] co-founder [[Sean Parker]], who presents a \"billion-dollar\" vision for the company that impresses Zuckerberg. He also suggests renaming the site Facebook. At Parker's suggestion, the company moves to [[Palo Alto]], with Saverin remaining in New York to work on business development. After Parker promises to expand Facebook to two continents, Zuckerberg invites him to live at the house he is using as company headquarters.\n\nWhile competing in the [[Henley Royal Regatta]] for Harvard against the [[Hollandia Roeiclub]], the Winklevoss twins discover that Facebook has expanded to Europe with [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[London School of Economics|LSE]], and decide to sue the company for theft of [[Intellectual property rights|intellectual property]]. Meanwhile, Saverin objects to Parker making business decisions for Facebook and freezes the company's bank account in the resulting dispute. He relents when Zuckerberg reveals that they have secured $500,000 from [[angel investor]] [[Peter Thiel]]. Saverin becomes enraged when he discovers that the new investment deal allows his share of Facebook to be [[Stock dilution|diluted]] from 34% to 0.03%, while maintaining the ownership percentage of all other parties. He confronts Zuckerberg and Parker, and Saverin vows to sue Zuckerberg before being ejected from the building. Saverin's name is removed from the masthead as co-founder. After Parker is apprehended for cocaine possession and attempts to blame Saverin, Zuckerberg cuts ties with him.\n\nIn [[Deposition (law)|depositions]], the Winklevoss twins claim that Zuckerberg stole their idea, while Saverin claims his shares of Facebook were unfairly diluted when the company was incorporated. Marylin Delpy, a junior lawyer for the defense, informs Zuckerberg that they will settle with Saverin, since the sordid details of Facebook's founding and Zuckerberg's callous attitude will make him unsympathetic to a jury. Alone, Zuckerberg sends a Facebook friend request to Albright and repeatedly refreshes the page.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as [[Mark Zuckerberg]]\n* [[Andrew Garfield]] as [[Eduardo Saverin]]\n* [[Justin Timberlake]] as [[Sean Parker]]\n* [[Armie Hammer]] as [[Cameron Winklevoss|Cameron]] and [[Tyler Winklevoss]]\n* [[Max Minghella]] as [[Divya Narendra]]\n* [[Brenda Song]] as Christy Lee\n* [[Rashida Jones]] as Marylin Delpy<ref>Tomio, Jay (December 9, 2009).

I can't go too deeply into that because most of the people did it on the condition of anonymity, but what I found was that two lawsuits were brought against Facebook at roughly the same time, that the defendant, plaintiffs, witnesses all came into a deposition room and swore under oath, and three different versions of the story were told. Instead of choosing one and deciding that's the truest one or choosing one and deciding that's the juiciest one, I decided to dramatize the idea that there were three different versions of the story being told.

The word count for a plot is usually 400-700 words. -->\nIn October 2003, 19-year-old [[Harvard University]] student [[Mark Zuckerberg]] is dumped by his girlfriend Erica Albright. Returning to his dorm, Zuckerberg writes an insulting entry about Albright on his [[LiveJournal]] blog. He creates a campus website called [[Facemash]] by hacking into college databases to steal photos of female students, then allowing site visitors to rate their attractiveness. After traffic to the site crashes parts of Harvard's computer network, Zuckerberg is given six months of [[academic probation]]. However, Facemash's popularity attracts the attention of Harvard upperclassmen and twins [[Cameron Winklevoss|Cameron]] and [[Tyler Winklevoss]] and their business partner [[Divya Narendra]]. The trio invites Zuckerberg to work on [[Harvard Connection]], a social network featuring the exclusive nature of Harvard students and aimed at dating.\n\nZuckerberg approaches his friend [[Eduardo Saverin]] with an idea for Thefacebook<!--the original name and spelling-->, a [[Social networking service|social networking]] website that would be exclusive to [[Ivy League]] students. Saverin provides $1,000 in seed funding, allowing Zuckerberg to build the website, which quickly becomes popular. When they learn of Thefacebook'','' the Winklevoss twins and Narendra are incensed, believing that Zuckerberg stole their idea while keeping them in the dark by stalling on developing the Harvard Connection website. They raise their complaint with Harvard President [[Larry Summers]], who is dismissive and sees no value in either disciplinary action or Thefacebook.\n\nSaverin and Zuckerberg meet fellow student Christy Lee, who asks them to \"Facebook me\", a phrase which impresses them. As Thefacebook grows in popularity, Zuckerberg extends the network to [[Yale University]], [[Columbia University]] and [[Stanford University]]. Lee arranges for Saverin and Zuckerberg to meet [[Napster]] co-founder [[Sean Parker]], who presents a \"billion-dollar\" vision for the company that impresses Zuckerberg. He also suggests renaming the site Facebook. At Parker's suggestion, the company moves to [[Palo Alto]], with Saverin remaining in New York to work on business development. After Parker promises to expand Facebook to two continents, Zuckerberg invites him to live at the house he is using as company headquarters.\n\nWhile competing in the [[Henley Royal Regatta]] for Harvard against the [[Hollandia Roeiclub]], the Winklevoss twins discover that Facebook has expanded to Europe with [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[London School of Economics|LSE]], and decide to sue the company for theft of [[Intellectual property rights|intellectual property]]. Meanwhile, Saverin objects to Parker making business decisions for Facebook and freezes the company's bank account in the resulting dispute. He relents when Zuckerberg reveals that they have secured $500,000 from [[angel investor]] [[Peter Thiel]]. Saverin becomes enraged when he discovers that the new investment deal allows his share of Facebook to be [[Stock dilution|diluted]] from 34% to 0.03%, while maintaining the ownership percentage of all other parties. He confronts Zuckerberg and Parker, and Saverin vows to sue Zuckerberg before being ejected from the building. Saverin's name is removed from the masthead as co-founder. After Parker is apprehended for cocaine possession and attempts to blame Saverin, Zuckerberg cuts ties with him.\n\nIn [[Deposition (law)|depositions]], the Winklevoss twins claim that Zuckerberg stole their idea, while Saverin claims his shares of Facebook were unfairly diluted when the company was incorporated. Marylin Delpy, a junior lawyer for the defense, informs Zuckerberg that they will settle with Saverin, since the sordid details of Facebook's founding and Zuckerberg's callous attitude will make him unsympathetic to a jury. Alone, Zuckerberg sends a Facebook friend request to Albright and repeatedly refreshes the page.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as [[Mark Zuckerberg]]\n* [[Andrew Garfield]] as [[Eduardo Saverin]]\n* [[Justin Timberlake]] as [[Sean Parker]]\n* [[Armie Hammer]] as [[Cameron Winklevoss|Cameron]] and [[Tyler Winklevoss]]\n* [[Max Minghella]] as [[Divya Narendra]]\n* [[Brenda Song]] as Christy Lee\n* [[Rashida Jones]] as Marylin Delpy<ref>Tomio, Jay (December 9, 2009).

This same arrangement is still used today in most software phones (see Android dialer for example). The ITU recommendation had 2 design options for the pound sign: a European version where the hash sign was built with a 90-degree angle and a North-American version with an 80-degree angle.

Broadcasters may display a hashtag as an on-screen [[digital on-screen graphic|bug]], encouraging viewers to participate in a [[backchannel]] of discussion via social media prior to, during, or after the program. [[Television commercial]]s have sometimes contained hashtags for similar purposes.<ref>{{cite magazine|url = http://www.tvguide.com/News/New-TV-Screen-1032111.aspx|title = New to Your TV Screen: Twitter Hashtags|date = April 21, 2011<!-- 3:25 PM-->|author = Michael Schneider|magazine = TV Guide}}</ref> Hashtag bugs appear on either corner of the screen, or they may appear at the end of an advertisement.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://mashable.com/2012/12/03/mcdonalds-tv-ad-twitter-hashtag/|title = McDonald's Releases First TV Ad With Twitter Hashtag|date = December 3, 2012|author = Todd Wasserman|publisher = Mashable}}</ref>\n\nWhile personalities associated with broadcasts, such as hosts and correspondents, also promote their corporate or personal Twitter usernames to receive mentions and replies to posts, usage of related or \"branded\" hashtags alongside Twitter usernames (e.g., [[The Ed Show|#edshow]] as well as @edshow) is increasingly encouraged as a microblogging style to \"trend\" the hashtag (and, hence, the discussion topic) in Twitter and other search engines. Broadcasters also make use of such a style to index select posts for a live broadcast. Chloe Sladden, Twitter's director of media partnerships, identified two types of television-formatted usage of hashtags: hashtags that identify a series being broadcast (e.g., [[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia|#SunnyFX]]) and instantaneous, \"temporary\" hashtags issued by television personalities to gauge topical responses from viewers during broadcasts.<ref>{{cite magazine|url = http://www.fastcompany.com/1747437/twitter-tv-hashtag-tips-twitters-own-expert|title = Twitter TV Hashtag Tips From Twitter's Own Expert|author = Gregory Ferenstein|date = April 15, 2011|magazine = Fast Company}}</ref> Some have speculated that hashtags might take the place of (or co-exist with) the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen television ratings system]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/twitter-chatter-correlates-tv-ratings-good-or-bad-news-nielsen-1144311 |title=Twitter Chatter Correlates With TV Ratings, But Is That Good Or Bad News For Nielsen? |work=International Business Times |date=March 22, 2013 |accessdate=September 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAn example of trending \"temporary\" hashtags garnering viewers during broadcasts is observed on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' with [[Jimmy Fallon]], a variety [[talk show]] on [[NBC]]. Every Wednesday, Fallon hosts a segment on his show called \"Tonight Show Hashtags,\" which engages viewers by inviting them via Twitter to post humorous stories based on a specific hashtag topic, such as #WhydidIsaythat, #Worstfirstdate, to #Onetimeinclass, reflecting on funny experiences in daily life. By using hashtags, Fallon creates a sense of community and solidarity among his viewers and draws a wider range of viewers through an online platform while they watch a classic, non-interactive television program. Because of its popularity, the \"Tonight Show Hashtags\" are usually the 'most tweeted hashtag' on Twitter, which promotes the show. By engaging viewers with a lighthearted subject and simple hashtags, Fallon can gauge topical responses from viewers during broadcasts and also use the hashtags to brand his show.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe increased usage of hashtags as brand promotion devices has been compared to the promotion of branded \"[[Index term|keywords]]\" by [[AOL]] in the late 1990s and early 2000s, as such keywords were also promoted at the end of television commercials and series episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/10/twitter-hashtag-pages-aol-keywords/|title = Twitter's Hashtag Pages Could Be The New AOL Keywords \u2014 But Better|author = Ryan Lawler|date = June 10, 2012|publisher = Techcrunch}}</ref>\n\nThe late-night television comedy [[game show]] [[@midnight]] with [[Chris Hardwick]] on [[Comedy Central]] features a daily game entitled \"Hashtag Wars,\" in which three comedians compete against one another to come up with phrases based on a given hashtag theme.\n\nSome hashtags have become famous worldwide. For instance the slogan \"''[[Je suis Charlie]],''\" which was first used on Twitter as the hashtag #jesuischarlie and #iamcharlie to indicate solidarity with ''Charlie Hebdo'' offices attacked in Paris, spread to the internet at large.\n\n==== Purchasing ====\n\nSince February 2013 Twitter and [[American Express]] have collaborated to enable users to pay for discounted goods online by tweeting a special hashtag.<ref>{{cite news | first = Kelly | last = Heather | title = Twitter and Amex let you pay with a hashtag | date = February 12, 2013 | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/11/tech/social-media/twitter-hashtag-purchases/| work = CNN | accessdate = November 25, 2013}}</ref> American Express members can sync their card with Twitter and pay for offers by tweeting; American Express tweets a response to the member that confirms the purchase.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sync.americanexpress.com/Twitter/Index |title=Sync with Twitter |publisher=Amex Sync |accessdate=November 25, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125121304/https://sync.americanexpress.com/Twitter/Index |archive-date=November 25, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==== Event promotion ====\n[[File:Occupy for Rights.JPG|thumb|[[Stencil graffiti]] promoting the hashtag #OccupyForRights]]\n\nOrganized real-world events have used hashtags and ad hoc lists for discussion and promotion among participants. Hashtags are used as beacons by event participants to find each other, both on Twitter and, in many cases, during actual physical events.\n\nCompanies and advocacy organizations have taken advantage of hashtag-based discussions for promotion of their products, services or campaigns.\n\nPolitical protests and campaigns in the early 2010s, such as [[Occupy Wall Street|#OccupyWallStreet]] and [[2011 Libyan civil war|#LibyaFeb17]], have been organized around hashtags or have made extensive usage of hashtags for the promotion of discussion. Hashtags have also been used to promote official events; the [[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Finland)|Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] officially titled the [[2018 Russia\u2013United States summit]] as the \"#HELSINKI2018 Meeting\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://um.fi/helsinki2018|title=#HELSINKI2018 - Ministry for Foreign Affairs|website=um.fi|access-date=2018-07-11}}</ref>\n\n==== Consumer complaints ====\nHashtags are often used by consumers on social media platforms  to complain about the customer service experience with large companies. The term \"bashtag\" has been created to describe situations in which a user refers to a corporate social media hashtag  to criticise the company or to tell others about poor customer service. For example, in January 2012, [[McDonald's]] created the #McDStories hashtag so that customers could share positive experiences about the restaurant chain. But, the marketing effort was cancelled after two hours when McDonald's received numerous complaint tweets rather than the positive stories they were anticipating.<ref>{{cite news | first = Alexis | last = Akwagyiram | title = Are Twitter and Facebook changing the way we complain? | date = May 17, 2012 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18081651 | work = BBC News | accessdate = June 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Sentiment analysis ====\nThe use of hashtags also reveals what feelings or sentiment an author attaches to a statement. This can range from the obvious, where a hashtag directly describes the state of mind, to the less obvious. For example, words in hashtags are the strongest [[Prediction|predictor]] of whether or not a statement is [[sarcasm|sarcastic]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Maynard|title=Who cares about sarcastic tweets?

It is always safe to precede the \"#\" with a space, and to include letters without diacritics, digits, and underscores.{{r|charset}} In many cases, other characters are also allowed, in particular, accented characters used in many languages, but handling may vary from one client to another and from time to time as standards evolve. A discussion of hashtag standards suggests that if #Romeo&Juliet is used, different Twitter clients might link to #Romeo, #Romeo&, or #Romeo&Juliet.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2010/02/hashtag-standards/ |title=Hashtag Standards|website=Terence Eden's Blog|date=25 February 2010|author=Terence Eden|accessdate= 21 September 2017}}</ref> Hashtags are not case sensitive: a search for \"#hashtag\" finds \"#HashTag\". The use of embedded capitals ([[CamelCase]]) increases legibility and avoids confusion.

In China, microblogs [[Sina Weibo]] and [[Tencent Weibo]] use a double-hashtag-delimited #HashName# format, since the lack of spacing between [[Chinese characters]] necessitates a closing tag. [[Twitter]] uses a different syntax for Chinese characters and [[orthographies]] with similar spacing conventions: the hashtag contains unspaced characters, separated from preceding and following text by spaces (e.g., '\u6211 #\u7231 \u4f60' instead of '\u6211#\u7231\u4f60')<ref>{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Rick|title=Twitter Rolls Out Hashtag Support for Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and Russian|url=https://www.techinasia.com/twitter-hashtag-languages/|accessdate=March 5, 2015|publisher=Tech in Asia|date=July 13, 2011}}</ref> or by  [[zero-width non-joiner]] characters before and after the hashtagged element, to retain a linguistically natural appearance (displaying as unspaced '\u6211&#8204;#\u7231&#8204;\u4f60', but with invisible non-joiners delimiting the hashtag).<ref>{{cite news|last1=International services team|title=Right-to-left languages on Twitter|url=https://blog.twitter.com/2012/right-to-left-languages-on-twitter|accessdate=March 5, 2015|publisher=Twitter|date=April 5, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402172013/https://blog.twitter.com/2012/right-to-left-languages-on-twitter|archive-date=April 2, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIt is considered acceptable to tag a post once when contributing to a specific conversation. Two hashtags are considered acceptable when adding a location to the conversation.

On Twitter, when a hashtag becomes extremely popular, it appears in the \"Trending Topics\" area of a user's homepage. The trending topics can be organized by geographic area or by all of Twitter. Hashtags are neither registered nor controlled by any one user or group of users. They cannot be \"retired\" from public usage, meaning that any given hashtag can theoretically be used in perpetuity. They do not contain any set definitions, meaning that a single hashtag can be used for any number of purposes, as chosen by the creators of them.\n\nHashtags intended for discussion of a particular event tend to use an obscure wording to avoid being caught up with generic conversations on similar subjects, such as a cake festival using #cakefestival rather than simply #cake. However, this can also make it difficult for topics to become \"trending topics\" because people often use different spelling or words to refer to the same topic. For topics to trend, there must be a consensus, whether silent or stated, that the hashtag refers to that specific topic.\n\nHashtags also function as beacons that help users find and \"follow\" (subscribe) or \"list\" (organize into public contact lists) other users of similar interest.\n\nTelevision broadcasters such as [[Channel 4]] have employed the hashtag during the transmission of programmes such as [[First Dates]] and [[The Undateables]]. Research has shown that audience numbers go up when individuals can be interactive by tweeting while viewing a programme.\n\nHashtags can be used on the social network [[Instagram]], by posting a picture and hashtagging it with its subject. As an example, a photo of oneself and a friend posted to the social network can be hashtagged #bffl or #friends. Instagram has banned certain hashtags, some because they are too generic, such as #photography #iPhone #iphoneography, and therefore do not fulfill a purpose. They have also blocked hashtags that can be linked to illegal activities, such as drug use.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24842750 |title=Instagram banned hashtags | date = November 7, 2013|work=[[BBC.co.uk]] |accessdate=November 25, 2013}}</ref> The ban against certain hashtags has a consequential role in the way that particular [[subaltern]] communities are built and maintained on Instagram. Despite Instagram's content policies, users are finding creative ways of maintaining their practices and ultimately circumventing censorship.<ref>Olszanowski, M. (2014). \"Feminist Self-Imaging and Instagram: Tactics of Circumventing Sensorship{{sic|hide=y}}\". ''Visual Communication Quarterly,'' 21(1), 83\u201395. Retrieved February 8, 2015, from http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15551393.2014.928154#.VNgGT7DF-7FF-7F</ref>\n\nFamous YouTube bloggers often use hashtags to promote their videos to a wide audience. Thus, by leaving various hashtags under the video, they are trying to increase their views and gain as many likes as possible. Usually, hashtags are left under the video itself in a special line. By clicking on the hashtag you go directly to the link to the video, which are similar in topic.\n\nHashtags are also used informally to express context around a given message, with no intent to categorize the message for later searching, sharing, or other reasons. One of the functions of the hashtag is to serve as a reflexive meta-commentary, which contributes to the idea of how written communication in new media can be paralleled to how pragmatic methodology is applied to speech.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.linguistics.fi/julkaisut/SKY2014/Wikstrom.pdf|title=#srynotfunny: Communicative Functions of Hashtags on Twitter|last=Wikstr\u00f6m|first=Peter|date=2014|work=SKY Journal of Linguistics|access-date=May 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThis can help express contextual cues or offer more depth to the information or message that appears with the hashtag. \"My arms are getting darker by the minute. #toomuchfaketan\". Another function of the hashtag can be used to express personal feelings and emotions. For example, with \"It's Monday!! #excited #sarcasm\" in which the adjectives are directly indicating the emotions of the speaker. It can also be used as a disclaimer of the information that the hashtag accompanies, as in, \"BREAKING NEWS: US GDP growth is back! #kidding\". In this case, the hashtag provides an essential piece of information in which the meaning of the utterance is changed entirely by the disclaimer hashtag. This may also be conveyed with #sarcasm, as in the previous example. Self-mockery is another informal function of the hashtag used by writers, as in this tweet: \"Feeling great about myself till I met an old friend who now races at the Master's level. Yup, there's today's #lessoninhumility,\" where the informality of the hashtag provides commentary on the tweet itself.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite

(The symbol is also called a \"pound sign\" in the US, and \"hash\" in the UK) In 1970, for example, the number sign was used to denote ''immediate'' [[address mode]] in the [[assembly language]] of the [[PDP-11]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://programmer209.wordpress.com/2011/08/03/the-pdp-11-assembly-language/ |title=PDP-11 assembly language |publisher=Programmer209.wordpress.com |date=August 3, 2011 |accessdate=August 25, 2014}}</ref> when placed next to a symbol or a number.

This same arrangement is still used today in most software phones (see Android dialer for example). The ITU recommendation had 2 design options for the pound sign: a European version where the hash sign was built with a 90-degree angle and a North-American version with an 80-degree angle. The North-American version seems to have prevailed as most pound signs in [[Europe]] now follow the 80-degree inclination.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&id=T-REC-E.161-198811-S!!PDF-E&type=items |title=Recommendation E.161 - Arrangement of figures, letters and symbols on telephones and other devices that can be used for gaining access to a telephone network  |publisher=ITU |date=November 25, 1988}}</ref>\n\nThe pound sign was adopted for use within IRC ([[Internet Relay Chat]]) networks circa 1988 to label groups and topics.<ref>\"Channel Scope\".

Broadcasters may display a hashtag as an on-screen [[digital on-screen graphic|bug]], encouraging viewers to participate in a [[backchannel]] of discussion via social media prior to, during, or after the program. [[Television commercial]]s have sometimes contained hashtags for similar purposes.<ref>{{cite magazine|url = http://www.tvguide.com/News/New-TV-Screen-1032111.aspx|title = New to Your TV Screen: Twitter Hashtags|date = April 21, 2011<!-- 3:25 PM-->|author = Michael Schneider|magazine = TV Guide}}</ref> Hashtag bugs appear on either corner of the screen, or they may appear at the end of an advertisement.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://mashable.com/2012/12/03/mcdonalds-tv-ad-twitter-hashtag/|title = McDonald's Releases First TV Ad With Twitter Hashtag|date = December 3, 2012|author = Todd Wasserman|publisher = Mashable}}</ref>\n\nWhile personalities associated with broadcasts, such as hosts and correspondents, also promote their corporate or personal Twitter usernames to receive mentions and replies to posts, usage of related or \"branded\" hashtags alongside Twitter usernames (e.g., [[The Ed Show|#edshow]] as well as @edshow) is increasingly encouraged as a microblogging style to \"trend\" the hashtag (and, hence, the discussion topic) in Twitter and other search engines. Broadcasters also make use of such a style to index select posts for a live broadcast. Chloe Sladden, Twitter's director of media partnerships, identified two types of television-formatted usage of hashtags: hashtags that identify a series being broadcast (e.g., [[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia|#SunnyFX]]) and instantaneous, \"temporary\" hashtags issued by television personalities to gauge topical responses from viewers during broadcasts.<ref>{{cite magazine|url = http://www.fastcompany.com/1747437/twitter-tv-hashtag-tips-twitters-own-expert|title = Twitter TV Hashtag Tips From Twitter's Own Expert|author = Gregory Ferenstein|date = April 15, 2011|magazine = Fast Company}}</ref> Some have speculated that hashtags might take the place of (or co-exist with) the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen television ratings system]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/twitter-chatter-correlates-tv-ratings-good-or-bad-news-nielsen-1144311 |title=Twitter Chatter Correlates With TV Ratings, But Is That Good Or Bad News For Nielsen? |work=International Business Times |date=March 22, 2013 |accessdate=September 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAn example of trending \"temporary\" hashtags garnering viewers during broadcasts is observed on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' with [[Jimmy Fallon]], a variety [[talk show]] on [[NBC]]. Every Wednesday, Fallon hosts a segment on his show called \"Tonight Show Hashtags,\" which engages viewers by inviting them via Twitter to post humorous stories based on a specific hashtag topic, such as #WhydidIsaythat, #Worstfirstdate, to #Onetimeinclass, reflecting on funny experiences in daily life. By using hashtags, Fallon creates a sense of community and solidarity among his viewers and draws a wider range of viewers through an online platform while they watch a classic, non-interactive television program. Because of its popularity, the \"Tonight Show Hashtags\" are usually the 'most tweeted hashtag' on Twitter, which promotes the show. By engaging viewers with a lighthearted subject and simple hashtags, Fallon can gauge topical responses from viewers during broadcasts and also use the hashtags to brand his show.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe increased usage of hashtags as brand promotion devices has been compared to the promotion of branded \"[[Index term|keywords]]\" by [[AOL]] in the late 1990s and early 2000s, as such keywords were also promoted at the end of television commercials and series episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/10/twitter-hashtag-pages-aol-keywords/|title = Twitter's Hashtag Pages Could Be The New AOL Keywords \u2014 But Better|author = Ryan Lawler|date = June 10, 2012|publisher = Techcrunch}}</ref>\n\nThe late-night television comedy [[game show]] [[@midnight]] with [[Chris Hardwick]] on [[Comedy Central]] features a daily game entitled \"Hashtag Wars,\" in which three comedians compete against one another to come up with phrases based on a given hashtag theme.\n\nSome hashtags have become famous worldwide. For instance the slogan \"''[[Je suis Charlie]],''\" which was first used on Twitter as the hashtag #jesuischarlie and #iamcharlie to indicate solidarity with ''Charlie Hebdo'' offices attacked in Paris, spread to the internet at large.\n\n==== Purchasing ====\n\nSince February 2013 Twitter and [[American Express]] have collaborated to enable users to pay for discounted goods online by tweeting a special hashtag.<ref>{{cite news | first = Kelly | last = Heather | title = Twitter and Amex let you pay with a hashtag | date = February 12, 2013 | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/11/tech/social-media/twitter-hashtag-purchases/| work = CNN | accessdate = November 25, 2013}}</ref> American Express members can sync their card with Twitter and pay for offers by tweeting; American Express tweets a response to the member that confirms the purchase.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sync.americanexpress.com/Twitter/Index |title=Sync with Twitter |publisher=Amex Sync |accessdate=November 25, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125121304/https://sync.americanexpress.com/Twitter/Index |archive-date=November 25, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==== Event promotion ====\n[[File:Occupy for Rights.JPG|thumb|[[Stencil graffiti]] promoting the hashtag #OccupyForRights]]\n\nOrganized real-world events have used hashtags and ad hoc lists for discussion and promotion among participants. Hashtags are used as beacons by event participants to find each other, both on Twitter and, in many cases, during actual physical events.\n\nCompanies and advocacy organizations have taken advantage of hashtag-based discussions for promotion of their products, services or campaigns.\n\nPolitical protests and campaigns in the early 2010s, such as [[Occupy Wall Street|#OccupyWallStreet]] and [[2011 Libyan civil war|#LibyaFeb17]], have been organized around hashtags or have made extensive usage of hashtags for the promotion of discussion. Hashtags have also been used to promote official events; the [[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Finland)|Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] officially titled the [[2018 Russia\u2013United States summit]] as the \"#HELSINKI2018 Meeting\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://um.fi/helsinki2018|title=#HELSINKI2018 - Ministry for Foreign Affairs|website=um.fi|access-date=2018-07-11}}</ref>\n\n==== Consumer complaints ====\nHashtags are often used by consumers on social media platforms  to complain about the customer service experience with large companies. The term \"bashtag\" has been created to describe situations in which a user refers to a corporate social media hashtag  to criticise the company or to tell others about poor customer service. For example, in January 2012, [[McDonald's]] created the #McDStories hashtag so that customers could share positive experiences about the restaurant chain. But, the marketing effort was cancelled after two hours when McDonald's received numerous complaint tweets rather than the positive stories they were anticipating.<ref>{{cite news | first = Alexis | last = Akwagyiram | title = Are Twitter and Facebook changing the way we complain? | date = May 17, 2012 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18081651 | work = BBC News | accessdate = June 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Sentiment analysis ====\nThe use of hashtags also reveals what feelings or sentiment an author attaches to a statement. This can range from the obvious, where a hashtag directly describes the state of mind, to the less obvious. For example, words in hashtags are the strongest [[Prediction|predictor]] of whether or not a statement is [[sarcasm|sarcastic]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Maynard|title=Who cares about sarcastic tweets?

It is always safe to precede the \"#\" with a space, and to include letters without diacritics, digits, and underscores.{{r|charset}} In many cases, other characters are also allowed, in particular, accented characters used in many languages, but handling may vary from one client to another and from time to time as standards evolve. A discussion of hashtag standards suggests that if #Romeo&Juliet is used, different Twitter clients might link to #Romeo, #Romeo&, or #Romeo&Juliet.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2010/02/hashtag-standards/ |title=Hashtag Standards|website=Terence Eden's Blog|date=25 February 2010|author=Terence Eden|accessdate= 21 September 2017}}</ref> Hashtags are not case sensitive: a search for \"#hashtag\" finds \"#HashTag\". The use of embedded capitals ([[CamelCase]]) increases legibility and avoids confusion.

In China, microblogs [[Sina Weibo]] and [[Tencent Weibo]] use a double-hashtag-delimited #HashName# format, since the lack of spacing between [[Chinese characters]] necessitates a closing tag. [[Twitter]] uses a different syntax for Chinese characters and [[orthographies]] with similar spacing conventions: the hashtag contains unspaced characters, separated from preceding and following text by spaces (e.g., '\u6211 #\u7231 \u4f60' instead of '\u6211#\u7231\u4f60')<ref>{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Rick|title=Twitter Rolls Out Hashtag Support for Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and Russian|url=https://www.techinasia.com/twitter-hashtag-languages/|accessdate=March 5, 2015|publisher=Tech in Asia|date=July 13, 2011}}</ref> or by  [[zero-width non-joiner]] characters before and after the hashtagged element, to retain a linguistically natural appearance (displaying as unspaced '\u6211&#8204;#\u7231&#8204;\u4f60', but with invisible non-joiners delimiting the hashtag).<ref>{{cite news|last1=International services team|title=Right-to-left languages on Twitter|url=https://blog.twitter.com/2012/right-to-left-languages-on-twitter|accessdate=March 5, 2015|publisher=Twitter|date=April 5, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402172013/https://blog.twitter.com/2012/right-to-left-languages-on-twitter|archive-date=April 2, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIt is considered acceptable to tag a post once when contributing to a specific conversation. Two hashtags are considered acceptable when adding a location to the conversation.

On Twitter, when a hashtag becomes extremely popular, it appears in the \"Trending Topics\" area of a user's homepage. The trending topics can be organized by geographic area or by all of Twitter. Hashtags are neither registered nor controlled by any one user or group of users. They cannot be \"retired\" from public usage, meaning that any given hashtag can theoretically be used in perpetuity. They do not contain any set definitions, meaning that a single hashtag can be used for any number of purposes, as chosen by the creators of them.\n\nHashtags intended for discussion of a particular event tend to use an obscure wording to avoid being caught up with generic conversations on similar subjects, such as a cake festival using #cakefestival rather than simply #cake. However, this can also make it difficult for topics to become \"trending topics\" because people often use different spelling or words to refer to the same topic. For topics to trend, there must be a consensus, whether silent or stated, that the hashtag refers to that specific topic.\n\nHashtags also function as beacons that help users find and \"follow\" (subscribe) or \"list\" (organize into public contact lists) other users of similar interest.\n\nTelevision broadcasters such as [[Channel 4]] have employed the hashtag during the transmission of programmes such as [[First Dates]] and [[The Undateables]]. Research has shown that audience numbers go up when individuals can be interactive by tweeting while viewing a programme.\n\nHashtags can be used on the social network [[Instagram]], by posting a picture and hashtagging it with its subject. As an example, a photo of oneself and a friend posted to the social network can be hashtagged #bffl or #friends. Instagram has banned certain hashtags, some because they are too generic, such as #photography #iPhone #iphoneography, and therefore do not fulfill a purpose. They have also blocked hashtags that can be linked to illegal activities, such as drug use.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24842750 |title=Instagram banned hashtags | date = November 7, 2013|work=[[BBC.co.uk]] |accessdate=November 25, 2013}}</ref> The ban against certain hashtags has a consequential role in the way that particular [[subaltern]] communities are built and maintained on Instagram. Despite Instagram's content policies, users are finding creative ways of maintaining their practices and ultimately circumventing censorship.<ref>Olszanowski, M. (2014). \"Feminist Self-Imaging and Instagram: Tactics of Circumventing Sensorship{{sic|hide=y}}\". ''Visual Communication Quarterly,'' 21(1), 83\u201395. Retrieved February 8, 2015, from http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15551393.2014.928154#.VNgGT7DF-7FF-7F</ref>\n\nFamous YouTube bloggers often use hashtags to promote their videos to a wide audience. Thus, by leaving various hashtags under the video, they are trying to increase their views and gain as many likes as possible. Usually, hashtags are left under the video itself in a special line. By clicking on the hashtag you go directly to the link to the video, which are similar in topic.\n\nHashtags are also used informally to express context around a given message, with no intent to categorize the message for later searching, sharing, or other reasons. One of the functions of the hashtag is to serve as a reflexive meta-commentary, which contributes to the idea of how written communication in new media can be paralleled to how pragmatic methodology is applied to speech.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.linguistics.fi/julkaisut/SKY2014/Wikstrom.pdf|title=#srynotfunny: Communicative Functions of Hashtags on Twitter|last=Wikstr\u00f6m|first=Peter|date=2014|work=SKY Journal of Linguistics|access-date=May 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThis can help express contextual cues or offer more depth to the information or message that appears with the hashtag. \"My arms are getting darker by the minute. #toomuchfaketan\". Another function of the hashtag can be used to express personal feelings and emotions. For example, with \"It's Monday!! #excited #sarcasm\" in which the adjectives are directly indicating the emotions of the speaker. It can also be used as a disclaimer of the information that the hashtag accompanies, as in, \"BREAKING NEWS: US GDP growth is back! #kidding\". In this case, the hashtag provides an essential piece of information in which the meaning of the utterance is changed entirely by the disclaimer hashtag. This may also be conveyed with #sarcasm, as in the previous example. Self-mockery is another informal function of the hashtag used by writers, as in this tweet: \"Feeling great about myself till I met an old friend who now races at the Master's level. Yup, there's today's #lessoninhumility,\" where the informality of the hashtag provides commentary on the tweet itself.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite
