However, at excessive levels, radium poisoning can occur. When the body takes in radium, it perceives it as calcium. Consequently, the body fills bones with radium, which can lead to brittle bones, collapsed spines, and teeth to fall out.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.atomicheritage.org/history/radium-girls|title=Radium Girls|last=|first=|date=|website=Atomic Heritage|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=21 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nRadium was discovered in 1898 by [[Marie Curie|Marie]] and [[Pierre Curie]].<ref name=\":2\" /> In the early 1900\u2019s it was used as radiation treatment for cancer. Expansion of radium\u2019s use in medical practices was earnestly attempted in the treatment of [[rheumatism]] and mental disorders.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, these pursuits were unsuccessful.\n\n===== Radium Girls =====\nDue to radium\u2019s [[Luminescence|luminescent]] properties, American inventor [[William Joseph Hammer|William J. Hammer]] mixed radium with glue and zinc sulfide to make glow-in-the-dark paint.<ref name=\":2\" /> This paint was used by the U.S. Radium Corporation and named \u201c[[Undark]].\u201d<ref name=\":2\" /> The paint was primarily used for wristwatch dials. Further application of the paint reached military equipment after the company accepted a contract with the U.S. government during WWI.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nStarting in 1916, the U.S. Radium Corporation established factories in New Jersey that recruited dozens of women to paint the watch dials with Undark.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/style/article/radium-girls-radioactive-paint/index.html|title=Radium Girls: The dark times of luminous watches|last=CNN|first=Jacopo Prisco|website=CNN|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> No [[Personal protective equipment|safety equipment]] were given to the women, nor were any precautions taken.<ref name=\":2\" /> The women were instructed to frequently lick the paint brushes, in order to keep them wet and shaped to a fine point. Throughout every day, the women\u2019s clothes and skin were covered in radium paint. This lead to the women developing fatal radium poisoning.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nBy the mid-1920\u2019s dozens upon dozens of these women were falling ill and dying from prolonged, horrific deaths. The radium they ingested was dissolving their bones from the inside, causing severe pain and enormous deformities with pieces of their bodies easily breaking and falling off. By 1927, over 50 women died from radium poisoning.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/12/28/373510029/saved-by-a-bad-taste-one-of-the-last-radium-girls-dies-at-107|title=Mae Keane, One Of The Last 'Radium Girls,' Dies At 107|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\nA smaller number of these female workers tried suing the company, not only for financial compensation to pay for their large medical bills and to afford themselves income to be able to live out the rest of their lives, but also to expose the company to their wrongful doing.<ref name=\":5\" /> Dial painter, Grace Fryer, as well as four other women sued U.S. Radium for $250,000. However, this lawsuit was unsuccessful because of U.S. Radium\u2019s vast team of lawyers and contractual affiliation with the U.S. government. The women were so desperate to afford medical treatment and food, that they had to settle for $10,000 each and a $600 annual payment. Unfortunately, all five women passed away within two years after the settlement.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe fate of the [[Radium Girls]] raised a lot of national concern for workers\u2019 health rights and conditions. After the incident, precautions and safety equipment were mandated to protect workers handling radioactive material in several occupations. The [[Manhattan Project]] notably used fume hoods, personal protective equipment, sanitation, and frequent checks for contamination, in order to prevent a repeat of the Radium Girls tragedy. In 1949, the U.S. Congress passed a law that compensates workers for occupational illnesses.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===== Environmental regulation =====\nBy the time World War II began, safety limits for handling radiation had been set by the federal government.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn 1934, the [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] (ICRP) established a tolerance dose for workers of 0.2 [[Roentgen (unit)|roentgens]] of radiation exposure to workers per day.\u00a0In 1936, the National Committee on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) reduced the limit to 0.1 roentgens per day which held through World War II.\u00a0From 1936 through 1977 there were continual revisions by professional scientists and the government agencies as to what constituted safe doses. By the end of World War II, arguments between the U.S. military leaders and civilian officials ensued as to what were considered best practices to controlling nuclear energy and repressing fabrication of nuclear weapons by other nations. This led to the dispute in going to congress and resulting in congress passing the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1946|Atomic Energy Act]] (AEA) of 1946.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Commission|first=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee for Review and Evaluation of the Medical Use Program of the Nuclear Regulatory|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK232703/|title=History of Radiation Regulation in Medicine|last2=Gottfried|first2=Kate-Louise D.|last3=Penn|first3=Gary|date=1996|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe EPA was created in 1970 to accept certain functions and responsibilities from other federal agencies and departments. Since its inception, the EPA has run environmental programs that address radioactive waste disposal sites, off-site monitoring around nuclear power plants, and keeps an eye on natural sources of radioactivity, such as radon.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nThe EPA has developed guidance on topics such as occupational radiation limits and exposures for federal agencies and members of the public.

PFOA or C8, is a synthetic chemical [[surfactant]] that is often used in the process of making non-stick cookware. PFOA is extremely bio-persistent, with a [[half-life]] of 8 years in humans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-01/documents/pfcs_action_plan1230_09.pdf|title=Long-Chain Perfluorinated Chemicals (PFCs)Action Plan|last=|first=|date=2009-12-30|website=EPA|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> PFOA can stay in the environment and the human body over long periods of time, and can have harmful effects to people exposed in high doses.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/teflon-and-perfluorooctanoic-acid-pfoa.html|title=Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA), Teflon, and Related Chemicals|website=www.cancer.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref>\n\n===== Clean blood sudy =====\nA worldwide study was conducted to compare \u201cclean blood,\u201d i.e., blood without C8 as a control with blood that contains C8, in order to illuminate the hazardous effects on humans. However, \u201cclean blood,\u201d could not be found from participants because 99% across the globe had derivatives of C8 found in their blood. Instead, samples of preserved blood from American Soldiers during the Korean War were used as the control. The blood was obtained in 1950, a year before Teflon was ever sold to the public. None of the preserved blood was found to contain C8, strongly suggesting that the worldwide use of Teflon caused a nigh-ubiquitous absence of \u201cclean blood.\u201d<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=http://connect2conserve.org/teflon-and-forever-chemicals/|title=Teflon and Forever Chemicals \u2013 Connect 2 Conserve|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref><ref name=\":9\">{{Cite AV media|url=https://thedevilweknow.com/|title=The Devil We Know|date=2018-01-21|last=Soechtig|first=Stephanie|type=Documentary|language=}}</ref>\n\n===== DuPont and 3M =====\nPFOA has been used to make [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]], a non-stick cookware by the chemical company [[DuPont]], since 1951. Fortunately for consumers, it does not exist in significant amounts in the final product of Teflon that could cause noticeable harm upon normal use.<ref name=\":7\" /> However, DuPont and [[3M]] workers that handle PFOA, as well as people who live near the plants, are not as fortunate.\n\n====== Birth defects ======\nIn 1981, two babies of female workers have been found to have eye-related defects. In 1986, Buck Bailey was born with a single nostril, a serrated eye lid, and a [[Coloboma|keyhole pupil]], due to his mother being exposed to PFOA on a daily basis when she worked at DuPont.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n====== Contamination of drinking water in Parkersburg, WV ======\nIt was not until the early 1990's that the toxic effects of PFOA became a public concern. Wilbur Tennant, a farmer who lives on his own private land near the DuPont plant in [[Parkersburg, West Virginia]], videotaped the calamitous effects of PFOA on his cattle and local wildlife. Calves were born with black teeth and opaque eyes. Several cows and deer were found dead by the stream.<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":9\" /> As it turned out, DuPont was dumping large amounts of waste PFOA into local streams that fed into Parkersburg's town water supply. So much waste PFOA was dumped that DuPont quickly lost count. Eventually, children were noticed to have black teeth, much like the calves in Tennant's farm.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n====== Phasing out C8 ======\nIn 2003, 3M phased out C8 for C4 in attempt to avoid public backlash. They urged DuPont to do the same. Instead, DuPont seized the opportunity to become the sole manufacturer of C8 and increased production.<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":9\" /> This lasted until the EPA banned the production of C8 in 2013. DuPont soon substituted C8 with Gen-X, which is a chemical that has not yet been researched or regulated.<ref name=\":8\" /> In order to detach their name from the toxic reputation of PFOA's, DuPont created the spin-off company, Chemours, to handle production and continued dumping of Gen-X.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nAfter facing several [[Class action|class-action]] lawsuits, DuPont paid $43,000 residents of Ohio each $400 to participate in a study to determine whether C8 could be linked to any diseases. Participation in the study also required each person to waive their rights to sue DuPont if no links could be made. The study lasted over seven years and grew to almost 70,000 participants, including West Virginia residents. The results were concluded in 2012. Six diseases were linked: \u201c[[Testicular cancer|testicular]] and [[kidney cancer]], [[ulcerative colitis]], [[thyroid disease]], [[pre-eclampsia]], and [[Hypercholesterolemia|high cholesterol]].\u201d<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n===== DuPont's public relations with Parkersburg, WV =====\nPart of the reason it has been difficult for residents of Parkersburg, West Virginia to challenge DuPont is because the chemical company makes large contributions to the local economy, education system, and local government. There are even buildings and a street named after DuPont.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n===== Environmental regulation =====\nPFOA is a group of chemicals that are still being studied. To date EPA has not yet established statutory clean-up levels for PFOA.\u00a0However,\u00a0the agency has established health advisory levels for these substances based on EPA\u2019s assessment of the latest\u00a0peer-reviewed science.\u00a0This advisory is meant to provide states, tribal and local officials, and drinking water system operators,\u00a0information on the health risks due to these chemicals in order to enable these people to take appropriate measures to protect their communities.\u00a0EPA has established a health advisory number of 70 parts per trillion for PFOS in drinking water to provide a conservative margin of protection to the most sensitive populations, thus ensuring protection for everyone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/drinking-water-health-advisories-pfoa-and-pfos|title=Drinking Water Health Advisories for PFOA and PFOS|last=US EPA|first=OW|date=2016-05-05|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n\n\n[[Category:Regulation of chemicals]]\n", "text_old": "Despite the best efforts of the government, health, and environmental agencies, improper use of hazardous chemicals is pervasive in commercial products, and can yield devastating effects on human health and the environment.

However, at excessive levels, radium poisoning can occur. When the body takes in radium, it perceives it as calcium. Consequently, the body fills bones with radium, which can lead to brittle bones, collapsed spines, and teeth to fall out.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.atomicheritage.org/history/radium-girls|title=Radium Girls|last=|first=|date=|website=Atomic Heritage|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=21 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nRadium was discovered in 1898 by [[Marie Curie|Marie]] and [[Pierre Curie]].<ref name=\":2\" /> In the early 1900\u2019s it was used as radiation treatment for cancer. Expansion of radium\u2019s use in medical practices was earnestly attempted in the treatment of [[rheumatism]] and mental disorders.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, these pursuits were unsuccessful.\n\n===== Radium Girls =====\nDue to radium\u2019s [[Luminescence|luminescent]] properties, American inventor [[William Joseph Hammer|William J. Hammer]] mixed radium with glue and zinc sulfide to make glow-in-the-dark paint.<ref name=\":2\" /> This paint was used by the U.S. Radium Corporation and named \u201c[[Undark]].\u201d<ref name=\":2\" /> The paint was primarily used for wristwatch dials. Further application of the paint reached military equipment after the company accepted a contract with the U.S. government during WWI.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nStarting in 1916, the U.S. Radium Corporation established factories in New Jersey that recruited dozens of women to paint the watch dials with Undark.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/style/article/radium-girls-radioactive-paint/index.html|title=Radium Girls: The dark times of luminous watches|last=CNN|first=Jacopo Prisco|website=CNN|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> No [[Personal protective equipment|safety equipment]] were given to the women, nor were any precautions taken.<ref name=\":2\" /> The women were instructed to frequently lick the paint brushes, in order to keep them wet and shaped to a fine point. Throughout every day, the women\u2019s clothes and skin were covered in radium paint. This lead to the women developing fatal radium poisoning.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nBy the mid-1920\u2019s dozens upon dozens of these women were falling ill and dying from prolonged, horrific deaths. The radium they ingested was dissolving their bones from the inside, causing severe pain and enormous deformities with pieces of their bodies easily breaking and falling off. By 1927, over 50 women died from radium poisoning.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/12/28/373510029/saved-by-a-bad-taste-one-of-the-last-radium-girls-dies-at-107|title=Mae Keane, One Of The Last 'Radium Girls,' Dies At 107|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\nA smaller number of these female workers tried suing the company, not only for financial compensation to pay for their large medical bills and to afford themselves income to be able to live out the rest of their lives, but also to expose the company to their wrongful doing.<ref name=\":5\" /> Dial painter, Grace Fryer, as well as four other women sued U.S. Radium for $250,000. However, this lawsuit was unsuccessful because of U.S. Radium\u2019s vast team of lawyers and contractual affiliation with the U.S. government. The women were so desperate to afford medical treatment and food, that they had to settle for $10,000 each and a $600 annual payment. Unfortunately, all five women passed away within two years after the settlement.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe fate of the [[Radium Girls]] raised a lot of national concern for workers\u2019 health rights and conditions. After the incident, precautions and safety equipment were mandated to protect workers handling radioactive material in several occupations. The [[Manhattan Project]] notably used fume hoods, personal protective equipment, sanitation, and frequent checks for contamination, in order to prevent a repeat of the Radium Girls tragedy. In 1949, the U.S. Congress passed a law that compensates workers for occupational illnesses.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===== Environmental regulation =====\nBy the time World War II began, safety limits for handling radiation had been set by the federal government.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn 1934, the [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] (ICRP) established a tolerance dose for workers of 0.2 [[Roentgen (unit)|roentgens]] of radiation exposure to workers per day.\u00a0In 1936, the National Committee on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) reduced the limit to 0.1 roentgens per day which held through World War II.\u00a0From 1936 through 1977 there were continual revisions by professional scientists and the government agencies as to what constituted safe doses. By the end of World War II, arguments between the U.S. military leaders and civilian officials ensued as to what were considered best practices to controlling nuclear energy and repressing fabrication of nuclear weapons by other nations. This led to the dispute in going to congress and resulting in congress passing the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1946|Atomic Energy Act]] (AEA) of 1946.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Commission|first=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee for Review and Evaluation of the Medical Use Program of the Nuclear Regulatory|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK232703/|title=History of Radiation Regulation in Medicine|last2=Gottfried|first2=Kate-Louise D.|last3=Penn|first3=Gary|date=1996|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe EPA was created in 1970 to accept certain functions and responsibilities from other federal agencies and departments. Since its inception, the EPA has run environmental programs that address radioactive waste disposal sites, off-site monitoring around nuclear power plants, and keeps an eye on natural sources of radioactivity, such as radon.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nThe EPA has developed guidance on topics such as occupational radiation limits and exposures for federal agencies and members of the public.

PFOA or C8, is a synthetic chemical [[surfactant]] that is often used in the process of making non-stick cookware. PFOA is extremely bio-persistent, with a [[half-life]] of 8 years in humans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-01/documents/pfcs_action_plan1230_09.pdf|title=Long-Chain Perfluorinated Chemicals (PFCs)Action Plan|last=|first=|date=2009-12-30|website=EPA|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> PFOA can stay in the environment and the human body over long periods of time, and can have harmful effects to people exposed in high doses.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/teflon-and-perfluorooctanoic-acid-pfoa.html|title=Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA), Teflon, and Related Chemicals|website=www.cancer.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref>\n\n===== Clean blood sudy =====\nA worldwide study was conducted to compare \u201cclean blood,\u201d i.e., blood without C8 as a control with blood that contains C8, in order to illuminate the hazardous effects on Humans. However, \u201cclean blood,\u201d could not be found from participants because 99% across the globe had derivatives of C8 found in their blood. Instead, samples of preserved blood from American Soldiers during the Korean War were used as the control. The blood was obtained in 1950, a year before the Teflon was ever sold to the public. None of the preserved blood was found to contain C8, strongly suggesting that the worldwide use of Teflon caused a nigh-ubiquitous absence of \u201cclean blood.\u201d<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=http://connect2conserve.org/teflon-and-forever-chemicals/|title=Teflon and Forever Chemicals \u2013 Connect 2 Conserve|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref><ref name=\":9\">{{Cite AV media|url=https://thedevilweknow.com/|title=The Devil We Know|date=2018-01-21|last=Soechtig|first=Stephanie|type=Documentary|language=}}</ref>\n\n===== DuPont and 3M =====\nPFOA has been used to make Teflon, a non-stick cookware by the chemical company DuPont, since 1951. Fortunately for consumers, it does not exist in significant amounts in the final product of Teflon that could cause noticeable harm upon normal use.<ref name=\":7\" /> However, DuPont and 3M workers that manufacture Teflon, as well as people who live near the plants, are not as fortunate. In 1978, 3M conducted a private study that found a \"disturbed\" amount PFOA in the blood of their workers. Possible \"toxic effects\" were expected. These results have not been shared to the public.\n\nIn 1981, two babies of female workers have been found to have eye-related defects. In 1986, Buck Bailey was born with a single nostril, a serrated eye lid, and a keyhole pupil, due to his mother being exposed to PFOA on a daily basis when she worked at DuPont.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n====== Contamination of drinking water in Parkersburg, WV ======\nIt was not until the early 1990's that the toxic effects of PFOA became a public concern. Wilbur Tennant, a farmer who lives on his own private land near the DuPont plant in Parkersburg, West Virginia, videotaped the calamitous effects of PFOA on his cattle and local wildlife. Calves were born with black teeth and opaque eyes. Several cows and deer were found dead by the stream.<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":9\" /> As it turned out, DuPont was dumping large amounts of waste PFOA into local streams that fed into Parkersburg's town water supply. So much waste PFOA was dumped that DuPont quickly lost count. Eventually, children were noticed to have black teeth, much like the calves in Tennant's farm.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n====== Phasing out C8 ======\nIn 2003, 3M phased out C8 for C4 in attempt to avoid public backlash. They urged DuPont to do the same. Instead, DuPont seized the opportunity to become the sole manufacturer of C8 and increased production.<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":9\" /> This lasted until the EPA banned the production of C8 in 2013. DuPont soon substituted C8 with Gen-X, which is a chemical that has not yet been researched or regulated.<ref name=\":8\" /> In order to detach their name from the toxic reputation of PFOA's DuPont created the spin-off company, Chemours, to handle production and continued dumping of Gen-X.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nDuPont paid 43,000 residents of Ohio each $400 to participate in a study to determine whether C8 could be linked to any diseases. Participation in the study also required each person to waive their rights to sue DuPont if no links could be made. The study lasted over seven years and grew to almost 70,000 participants, including West Virginia residents. The results were concluded in 2012. Six diseases were linked: \u201ctesticular and kidney cancer, ulcerative colitis, thyroid disease, preeclampsia, and high cholesterol.\u201d<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n===== DuPont's public relations with Parkersburg, WV =====\nPart of the reason it has been difficult for residents of Parkersburg, West Virginia to challenge DuPont is because the chemical company makes large contributions to the local economy, education system, and local government. There are even buildings and a street named after DuPont.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n===== Environmental regulation =====\nPFOA is a group of chemicals that are still being studied. To date EPA has not yet established statutory clean-up levels for PFOA.\u00a0However,\u00a0the agency has established health advisory levels for these substances based on EPA\u2019s assessment of the latest\u00a0peer-reviewed science.\u00a0This advisory is meant to provide states, tribal and local officials, and drinking water system operators,\u00a0information on the health risks due to these chemicals in order to enable these people to take appropriate measures to protect their communities.\u00a0EPA has established a health advisory number of 70 parts per trillion for PFOS for drinking water to provide a conservative margin of protection to the most sensitive populations, thus ensuring protection for everyone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/drinking-water-health-advisories-pfoa-and-pfos|title=Drinking Water Health Advisories for PFOA and PFOS|last=US EPA|first=OW|date=2016-05-05|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n\n\n[[Category:Regulation of chemicals]]\n", "name_user": "VictorSilva9", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed minor grammatical errors and added several wiki links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaps_in_Regulation_of_Chemical_Agents"}

One of them, ''Thursday Adventure'' (1955) was filmed as ''[[The Stolen Airliner]]'' (1955).<ref>[http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/pudney_john 'John Pudney' in ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'']</ref> They featured classic illustrations by artists such as Ley Kenyon (1913-1990) and Douglas Relf.<ref>[https://www.aces-high.com/artists/view/ley-kenyon Aces High: Aviation Gallery]</ref> The later six volumes of Hartwarp adventures for younger children were published by Hamish Hamilton. Both series were popular and sold well in the 1950s and 1960s, but they haven't remained in print. Most significantly while at Evans, Pudney commissioned the Australian fighter pilot and prisoner of war [[Paul Brickhill]] to come to England and write [[The Great Escape (book)|''The Great Escape'']], which Evans published in 1950 attracting much attention. He had previously suggested to the Air Historical Branch of the British Air Ministry that Brickhill should be considered as the author of a history of [[617 Squadron]]. After the success of ''The Great Escape'' this was also published by Evans as [[The Dam Busters (book)|''The Dam Busters'']] (1951). It sold over one million copies in its first 50 years.<ref>Dando-Collins, Stephen.

Between 1949 and 1963 he edited an annual anthology called ''Pick of Today's Short Stories''. Commissioned non-fiction became an important source of income for Pudney in his later years. Among these works were a history of the British state airline [[B.O.A.C.|B.O.A.C]] (''The Seven Skies'', 1959), and of [[Courage Brewery]] (''A Draught of Contentment'' (1971)<ref>[http://takecourage.info/index.html Text based on ''A Draught of Contentment'' at Courage & Co]</ref>. \n\nHowever, poetry remained the most important to him. His later work, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967) onward, took on a more ironic stance but was still vernacular rather than academic, a period reflected in his second Selected Poems collection of 1973. One of his book blurbs describes him as \"a poet who just missed being an intellectual\".<ref name=white/> His final two poems appeared in the ''Times Literary Supplement'' a few days after his death.<ref name=dnb/>\n\n==Private Life==\nOn 30 October 1934 Pudney married the [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] feminist Crystal Selwyn Herbert (1915-1999), daughter of [[A.

They first lived in Cornwall in a converted lifeboat, then took a farm in Essex.<ref>Crystal Hale obituary in ''The Guardian'', 8 December 1999, p 24</ref>\nThere were two daughters and a son. They divorced in 1955, and Pudney immediately married his second wife, Monica Forbes Curtis of the [[Forbes family]]. She helped him recover from his alcoholism, to which he publicly confessed in 1965 and emerged cured in 1967 - despite a hit-and-run accident in the middle that broke both his legs and dislocated his shoulder.<ref name=white/> The recovery process became a subject for his writing. According to [[Michael White (journalist)|Michael White]] ''Spill Out'' was written \"half of it on the booze and half off, and he didn't remember which half was which\".<ref name=white/> In 1976 Pudney developed cancer of the throat from which he died nearly two years later in much pain. He wrote about his illness unflinchingly in his autobiographical ''Thank Goodness for Cake'', posthumously published in 1978.\n\nJohn Pudney's daughter Tessa (1942-2004) was an academic best known for her work in media studies at [[Sheffield Hallam University]]. She married the film critic [[V. F.

He was known especially for his popular poetry written during the [[Second World War|Second World War]], but he also wrote novels, short stories and children's fiction (including the Hartwarp books). Pudney also wrote broad-ranging non-fiction, often commissioned, which served as his primary source of income. \n\n==Education and Early Career==\nJohn Pudney was born at [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley Marish]], the only son of Henry William Pudney (a farmer and countryman) and Mabel Sleigh Pudney. He was educated at [[Gresham's School]], [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]], where he first encountered [[W. H. Auden]], [[Benjamin Britten]], and [[Humphrey Spender]]. He left school in 1925 at the age of sixteen, and spent several years working as an estate agent and studying to become a surveyor. However, he began contributing articles to the [[News Chronicle|News Chronicle]] at the same time, also writing short stories and channelling his love of the countryside into verse.<ref name=dnb>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31573Roger Lubbock, \u2018Pudney, John Sleigh (1909\u20131977)\u2019, rev.

It depicts a centuries-old struggle, now and then, between the [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]], who fight for peace with free will, and the [[Knights Templar|Templars]], who desire peace through control. The series features [[historical fiction]], [[science fiction]] and [[fictional characters|characters]], intertwined with real-world [[historical events]] and [[historical figures|figures]]. For the majority of time players control an Assassin in the past history, while they also play as Desmond Miles or an Assassin Initiate in the present day, who hunt down their Templar targets.\n\nThe video game series took inspiration from the novel ''[[Alamut (Bartol novel)|Alamut]]'' by the Slovenian writer [[Vladimir Bartol]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/148805/interviews/assassins-creed/|title=Interview: Assassin's Creed|publisher=CVG|accessdate=September 2, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025102806/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/148805/interviews/assassins-creed/|archivedate=October 25, 2012}}</ref> while building upon concepts from the ''[[Prince of Persia]]'' series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-assassins-creed|title=The Making Of: Assassin's Creed|publisher=EDGE|date=August 27, 2012|accessdate=March 3, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228044009/http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-assassins-creed/|archivedate=December 28, 2013}}</ref> The series's [[Assassin's Creed (video game)|eponymous first title]] was released in 2007, and it has featured eleven main games in total, the most recent being 2018's ''[[Assassin's Creed Odyssey]]''.\n\nA new story and time period are introduced in each entry, and gameplay elements evolve from the previous one. There are three story arcs in the series. For the first five main games, the framing story is set in 2012 and features series protagonist [[Desmond Miles]] who uses a machine called the Animus and relives the memories of his ancestors to find a way to avert the [[2012 phenomenon|2012 apocalypse]]. In games up until and including ''[[Assassin's Creed Syndicate]]'', Abstergo employees and Assassin initiates recorded genetic memories using the Helix software, helping the Templars and Assassins find new Pieces of Eden in the modern world. The latest two games, ''[[Assassin's Creed Origins]]'' and ''[[Assassin's Creed Odyssey]]'' follow ex-Abstergo employee Layla Hassan as she is recruited into the Assassin Order.\n\nMain games of ''Assassin's Creed'' are set in an [[open world]] and presented from the [[third-person perspective]] where the protagonists take down targets using their combat and stealth skills with the exploitation of the environment. Players have freedom to explore the historical settings as they finish main and side quests. Apart from single-player missions, some games also provide competitive and cooperative multiplayer gameplay. While main games are produced for major consoles and desktop platforms, multiple spin-off games are released for consoles, mobiles, and handhelds platforms.\n\nThe main games in the ''Assassin's Creed'' video game series have received generally positive reviews for their ambition in visuals, game design, and narratives, with criticism towards the yearly release cycle and frequent bugs. The spin-off games received mixed to positive reviews. The video game series has received multiple awards and nominations, including Game of the Year awards. It is commercially successful, selling over 140 million copies {{as of|2019|9|lc=y}}, becoming Ubisoft's best-selling franchise and one of the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|highest selling video game franchises of all time]]. ''Assassin's Creed'' was adapted into a [[Assassin's Creed (film)|film]], which received negative reviews. A series of art books, encyclopedias, comics, novelizations, and [[Assassin's Creed (book series)|novels]] haven been published. All of the media take place within the same continuity as the main video game series.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ubisoft developper team of Assasians creed on Quebec Remparts vs Titan d'Acadie-Bathurst on Centre Vid\u00e9otron, Qu\u00e9bec city 02.jpg|thumb|Members of Ubisoft Quebec, developer team of the latest title in the series, ''Assassin's Creed Odyssey'']]\nThe ''Assassin's Creed'' series originated out of ideas for a sequel for ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]'', a 3D adaption of the original ''[[Prince of Persia]]'' games, which was made for [[PlayStation 2]], [[GameCube]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and other platforms. It included a number of [[parkour]] moves and combat. ''The Sands of Time'' was a critical and financial success, leading publisher Ubisoft to request Ubisoft Montreal to develop a sequel, aiming for the [[seventh generation of video game consoles|next console generation]]. The Ubisoft Montreal team decided on taking the gameplay from ''The Sands of Time'' into an [[open world]] approach, taking advantage of the improved processing power to render larger spaces and crowds. Narratively, the team wanted to move away from the Prince being someone next in line for the throne but to have to work for it; combined with research into secret societies led them to focus on the [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]], heavily borrowing from the novel ''[[Alamut (Bartol novel)|Alamut]]''.<ref name=\"polygon oral\">{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/features/2018/10/3/17924770/assassins-creed-an-oral-history-patrice-desilets | title=  Assassin's Creed: An oral history | first = Richard | last = Moss | date = October 3, 2018 | accessdate = October 3, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref>\n\nThey developed a narrative where the player would control an Assassin that served as a bodyguard for a non-playable Prince, leading them to call this game ''Prince of Persia: Assassin''. Ubisoft was not happy with a ''Prince of Persia'' game without the Prince as the playable character, but this led to the marketing division to suggest the name ''Assassin's Creed'', playing off the creed of the Assassins, \"nothing is true; everything is permitted\". Ubisoft Montreal ran with this in creating a new [[intellectual property]], eliminating the Prince and creating the conflict between the Assassins and [[Templar Knights]]. Further, in postulating what other assassinations they could account for throughout human history, they came onto the idea of [[genetic memory (psychology)|genetic memory]] and created the \"Animus\" device and modern storyline elements, which further allowed them to explain certain facets of gameplay, such as accounting when the player fails a mission, in the same way they had done in ''The Sands of Time''.<ref name=\"polygon oral\"/>\n\nFollowing release of the first ''Assassin's Creed'' in 2007, Ubisoft Montreal and other Ubisoft studios use the series to present games from various historical periods, striving for historical accuracy while conceding some elements for gameplay.<ref name=\"polygon oral\"/>\n\n==Premise==\n[[File:Abstergo 2.png|thumb|''- \"We change the world. Every day, in a hundred different ways.\"'' -<br />The fictional slogan and logo of [[Abstergo Industries]] from the ''Assassin's Creed'' franchise]]\nThe ''Assassin's Creed'' games primarily revolve around the rivalry and conflict between two ancient secret societies \u2014 the [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]], who represent freedom, and the [[Knights Templar]], who represent order; as well as their indirect relation to an [[Ancient astronauts|ancient species pre-dating humanity]], referred to within the games as \"those who came before\" or \"precursors\", who were technologically advanced and claimed to be the creators of humanity, before their society and much of Earth's biosphere were destroyed by a massive [[Coronal mass ejection|solar storm]] thousands of years before the games. The games' are split between various real-world settings in different chronological periods - the present, modern day era, and various historical settings, the latter including a variety of historical characters given fictionalized involvement in the conflict between the two secret societies.\n\nThe main premise focuses on the efforts of the Assassins in stopping the Knights Templars from finding and securing various artifacts of the ancient species, known as \"Pieces of Eden\", which hold great power and are capable of controlling [[free will]]. In the modern era, the Assassins, also known as \"The Brotherhood\", focus on combating the Templars, who evolved with the world and developed into a [[mega-corporation]] [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] with multiple branches called Astergo Industries. To help trace Pieces of Eden to locations in the modern-era world, Astergo secretly develops a device called the \"Animus\" - a computerized system that can allow one to \"re-live\" and experience the memories of previous people through remnants of their genetic material. Initially only capable of allowing a person to explore the memories of their genetic ancestors, later improvements to the Animus allow virtualy anyone to experience the lives of any person used in the device. Overexposure to the animus causes the \"bleeding effect\", which results in giving the user skills and abilities of his ancestors, but is also dangerous for the user as it can damage their mind, causing symptoms such as [[dementia]], [[insanity]], [[dissociative identity disorder]] or [[brain damage]].\n\nThe initial story arc of the games focuses on the efforts of the Brotherhood to thwart Astergo's plans to secure a Piece of Eden and ultimately to uncover a method to prevent the world being destroyed by another solar storm in 2012, while several titles after this focus on the efforts of each side to cause problems for their opponent in their continuing conflict. The release of ''Origins'' introduced a new story arc focused on a researcher who becomes involved in searching out memories of ancient assassins, and becoming involved in seeking the means to prevent either society gaining the upper-hand over the other.\n\n===Protagonists===\n{{main|List of Assassin's Creed characters}}\n[[Desmond Miles]] is a bartender who is a descendant of several lines of prominent [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]]; though raised as an Assassin, he left his nomadic family to seek out a more common lifestyle. He is initially kidnapped by Abstergo, which is aware of his ancestral lineage. Desmond is forced into the Animus and is revealed to be subject 17; many of the sixteen previous subjects died as a result of Animus over-exposure.\n\nDesmond is later rescued by a small team of modern-day Assassins and agrees to work with them, continuing to experience the memories of his ancestors to discover the locations of additional Pieces of Eden so they can be recovered before Abstergo can do so. From the bleeding effect, Desmond gains some of the Assassin skills of his predecessors at the cost of living with multiple sets of memories and personalities in his mind.\n\nWithin the Animus, Desmond explores the memories of a number of Assassins, including [[Alta\u00efr Ibn-La'Ahad]], an initially disgraced Assassin working to redeem himself during the [[Third Crusade]]; [[Ezio Auditore da Firenze]], an Assassin in Italy during the late 15th and early 16th centuries of the [[Italian Renaissance]]; and [[Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton]], otherwise known as Connor, a half-[[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], half-[[British people|British]] Assassin during the [[American Revolution]].\n\nThroughout these events, Desmond learns of allusions to the prophetic [[2012 phenomenon|end of the world in 2012]] from a former Animus test subject, Subject 16; the event turns out to be a repeat of the disaster which wiped out the ancient civilization, and he finds out that his memories hold the key to Earth's surviving a second solar storm. During his experiences, Desmond is aided by holographic projections of three of the ancient race's rulers: Jupiter, Minerva, and Juno.\n\nAfter Desmond dies to ensure Earth's survival, his memories, which have survived through genetic samples of his DNA,<ref name=\"GI preview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/assassins_creed_iv_black_flag/b/playstation4/archive/2013/03/04/assassin-39-s-creed-iv-black-flag-preview.aspx|title=Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag|last=Vore|first=Bryan|publisher=Gameinformer.com|date=March 4, 2013|accessdate=March 4, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306035746/http://www.gameinformer.com/games/assassins_creed_iv_black_flag/b/playstation4/archive/2013/03/04/assassin-39-s-creed-iv-black-flag-preview.aspx|archivedate=March 6, 2013}}</ref> are accessed by Abstergo, which hires a new subject to enter the Animus. The new subject relives the memories of Edward Kenway (grandfather of Ratohnhak\u00e9:ton, otherwise known as Connor Kenway), a privateer-turned-pirate during the [[Golden Age of Piracy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/04/the-dawn-of-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag|title=The Dawn of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag|last=George|first=Richard|website=IGN|date=March 4, 2013|accessdate=August 30, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930175256/http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/04/the-dawn-of-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag|archivedate=September 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\nWhile the games are often presented through protagonist Desmond Miles, the bulk of the game is played as Desmond experiences the memories of his ancestors through an advanced device called the Animus. This provides a means of a diegetic interface, showing Desmond's ancestor's health, equipment, goals, and other features as part of the Animus interface. The Animus is based on the player controlling the assassin to maintain the synchronization between Desmond and his ancestor's memories. Performing actions that go against the Assassin's way or dying breaks the synchronization, effectively requiring the player to restart at a previous checkpoint. Furthermore, the player cannot explore outside areas that the assassin has not experienced yet. There are also abnormalities within the Animus from previous users of the device.\n\nWhile playing as the Assassin characters, the games are generally presented from a [[Third-person (video games)|third-person perspective]] in an [[open world]] environment, focusing on [[Stealth game|stealth]] and [[parkour]]. The games use a mission structure to follow the main story, generally assigning the player to complete an assassination of public figureheads or a covert mission. Alternatively, several side missions are available, such as mapping out the expansive cities from a high perch followed by performing a \"leap of faith\" into a haystack below, collecting treasures hidden across the cities, exploring ruins for relics, building a brotherhood of assassins to perform other tasks, or funding the rebuilding of a city through purchasing and upgrading of shops and other features. At times, the player is in direct control of Desmond, who by nature of the Animus use has learned Assassin techniques through the bleeding effect, as well as their genetic ability of Eagle Vision, which separates friend, foe and assassination targets by illuminating people in different colors. Through the Animus interface, the player can go back to retry any past mission already completed; for example, in ''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood'', the player achieves better synchronization results by performing the mission in a specific manner such as by only killing the mission's target.\n\nThe games use the concept of \"active\" versus \"passive\" moves, with \"active\" moves, such as running, climbing the sides of buildings, or jumping between rooftops, more likely to alert the attention of nearby guards. When the guards become alerted, the player must either fight them or break their line of sight and locate a hiding place, such as a haystack or a well, and wait until the guards' alert is reduced. The combat system allows for a number of unique weapons, armor, and moves, including the use of a hidden blade set in a bracer on the Assassin's arm, and which also can be used to quietly assassinate targets.\n\n==Release history==\nThe following table lists the games created for the franchise and the respective platform(s) they released upon:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!Title\n!Released\n!Platform\n!Other\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed]]''\n|2007\n|[[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed: Alta\u00efr's Chronicles]]''\n|2008\n|[[Nintendo DS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iOS]], [[Symbian]], [[webOS]], [[Windows Phone]]\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines]]''\n|rowspan=\"3\"|2009\n|[[PlayStation Portable]]\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed II]]''\n|PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], [[OS X]], Windows, Symbian\n|[[OnLive]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed II: Discovery]]''\n|Nintendo DS, iOS\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood]]''\n|2010\n|PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, OS X, Windows\n|rowspan=\"2\"|OnLive\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed: Revelations]]''\n|2011\n|PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows, Android, Symbian\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed III]]''\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2012\n|PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, [[Wii U]], PlayStation 4, Xbox One, [[Nintendo Switch]], [[Symbian]]\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed III: Liberation]]''<ref group=\"lower-alpha\" name=\"Liberation HD\">Released under the title ''Assassin's Creed: Liberation HD'' for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.</ref>\n|PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, [[PlayStation Vita]]\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag]]''\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2013\n|PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii U, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed: Pirates]]''\n|Windows,<ref group=\"lower-alpha\" name=\"Pirates\">Available for Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 from the Microsoft store.</ref> Android, iOS\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed: Freedom Cry]]''<ref group=\"lower-alpha\" name=\"FreedomCry\">Originally released as DLC for all versions of ''Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag''.</ref>\n|rowspan=\"4\"|2014\n|PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Windows\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Rogue]]''\n|PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Windows\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Identity]]''\n|Android, iOS\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Unity]]''\n|PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Chronicles|Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China]]''<ref group=\"lower-alpha\" name=\"ChroniclesChina\">Originally announced as part of the season pass for ''Assassin's Creed Unity''.</ref>\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2015\n|PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows, PlayStation Vita<ref group=\"lower-alpha\" name=\"PSVita\">Released as a compilation titled ''Assassin's Creed Chronicles Trilogy Pack''.</ref>\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Syndicate]]''\n|PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Chronicles|Assassin's Creed Chronicles: India]]''\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2016\n|rowspan=\"2\"|PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows, PlayStation Vita<ref group=\"lower-alpha\" name=\"PSVita\"/>\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Chronicles|Assassin's Creed Chronicles: Russia]]''\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Origins]]''\n|2017\n|rowspan=\"2\"|PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Odyssey]]''\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2018\n|[[Google Stadia|Stadia]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed#Assassin's Creed Rebellion|Assassin's Creed Rebellion]]''\n|Android, iOS\n|\u2014\n|}\n\n; Notes\n<references group=\"lower-alpha\" />\n\n===Main series===\n\n====''Assassin's Creed''====\n{{main|Assassin's Creed (video game)}}\nDesmond Miles is captured by Abstergo and forced to use a machine called the Animus to explore Alta\u00efr ibn-La'Ahad's memories during the time of the [[Third Crusade]]. Desmond begins to witness events after Alta\u00efr breaks all three tenets of the Assassin Brotherhood while attempting to stop [[Robert IV de Sabl\u00e9|Robert de Sabl\u00e9]] from taking a Piece of Eden. [[Al Mualim]], the Brotherhood's leader, demotes Alta\u00efr to Novice and tasks him with assassinating the nine Knights Templars, including de Sabl\u00e9, to regain his former status. Alta\u00efr's quest eventually leads him to face de Sabl\u00e9 in the presence of King [[Richard I of England]] warning the King of de Sabl\u00e9's plot to kill him. Alta\u00efr defeats de Sabl\u00e9, but with his last words, de Sabl\u00e9 reveals that there were ten Templars, the last being Al Mualim, who now holds the Piece of Eden. Alta\u00efr returns to face Al Mualim and struggles to fight through illusions created by the Piece, but eventually kills Al Mualim. When Alta\u00efr recovers the piece, he and those watching the Animus view a holographic map showing where other artifacts are located across the globe. Desmond is pulled from the Animus, and was going to be killed, but his life is spared by [[Lucy Stillman]], an Assassin working as a mole within Abstergo, as she claims they might need to further examine his memories later. He comes to learn that a former test subject had left messages only Desmond can see, foretelling the end of the world in 2012.\n\nThe first ''Assassin's Creed'' introduced core elements that remained  in the rest of the game series. The game creates fictionalized, historical versions of [[Masyaf]] (the Brotherhood's location), [[Jerusalem]], [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] and [[Damascus]], and incorporates a number of documented historical figures into the story. Other core elements include the virtualized Animus system, free running, climbing, stealth, [[parkour]], and the initial formulation of the combat system. The game requires the player to complete a number of side quests before they are able to obtain an assassin quest from a local Brotherhood guidemaster in each city, but this side quest prerequisite was abandoned in future games.\n\n====''Assassin's Creed II''====\n{{main|Assassin's Creed II}}\nLucy returns and breaks Desmond out of Abstergo, taking him to an Assassin safehouse to work alongside Shaun, a historian, and Rebecca, their technical support. Using an improved version of the Animus, Desmond takes witness to Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a young nobleman from the late 15th century in [[Florence]], shortly before the execution of Ezio's father and brothers by order of a corrupt official working for the Templars. He, his mother, and sister take to hiding at the Monteriggioni villa owned by his uncle Mario, who helps to train Ezio in the ways of an Assassin. Ezio and Mario discover that Rodrigo Borgia is the figurehead of a number of Templars all who were accomplices in the execution of his family, and with help of allies like [[Leonardo da Vinci]], methodically assassinate the lower-ranked Templars, while learning that Borgia has acquired a Piece of Eden called the Apple. Eventually, Ezio corners Borgia, who hands over the Piece and flees; Ezio is inducted into the ranks of the Brotherhood and believed to be a prophet based on their codex. A decade later, the Brotherhood learns that Borgia has since become [[Pope Alexander VI]], using the Church's influence to strengthen the Templars. Ezio invades [[Vatican City]] and confronts Borgia, discovering that the Papal staff is also a Piece of Eden. Defeating Borgia but sparing his life, Ezio uses both the Apple and the Papal staff to reveal a chamber of ancient technology. Inside, he is addressed by a hologram of a humanoid female that calls herself Minerva who speaks directly to Desmond through Ezio. Minerva explains how her society had pre-dated humanity's, but a great disaster nearly wiped them out, and warns that another event is due to occur soon, putting the fate of humanity in Desmond's hands. Upon this discovery, Desmond and his allies find the safehouse has been compromised by Abstergo and flee.\n\nSimilar to the first game, ''Assassin's Creed II'' takes place in historical recreations of [[Venice]], [[Florence]], [[Forl\u00ec]], [[San Gimignano]], and the [[Tuscany|Tuscan countryside]], and incorporates events during that period as part of the story. Missions are divided into main story missions, themselves divided into memory sequences reflecting points in Ezio's life, and side missions which can be accomplished at any time; this approach to mission structure remains consistent in the other games in the series. The Monteriggioni villa provides several functions which can be expanded on by paying money for upgrades of surrounding buildings, or by purchasing artwork, weapons, and armor for the villa; in turn, the villa will generate wealth for the player at a rate influenced by the upgrades and acquisition of these items. Additional quests involve locating secret Assassin seals, and finding hidden marks left by \"Subject 16\", a former Animus user, that hint at the nature of Minerva's society.\n\n====''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood''====\n{{main|Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood}}\nDesmond and his allies retreat to the ruins of the Monteriggioni villa, and Desmond reenters the Animus to continue Ezio's memories, specifically to identify the location of the Apple. After facing Rodrigo Borgia, Ezio returned to Monteriggioni, but the villa is soon attacked by forces under the command of [[Cesare Borgia]], Rodrigo's son. Mario is killed and the Apple is stolen. Ezio vows revenge by helping to free the people of Rome from the Borgia family. As Ezio works covertly to turn the city against the Borgias, he gains followers that want to join his cause, and Ezio trains them in the way of the Assassins. In an attempt to assassinate Cesare and Rodrigo at the [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], Ezio instead witnesses Cesare forcing his father to eat a poisoned apple that Rodrigo had prepared to kill his son. Ezio chases down Cesare and eventually captures him and recovers the Apple. Cesare is taken to prison in Viana, Spain but manages to escape with help of his allies. The Assassins lead the fight against Cesare and the remaining loyal Borgia troops, and eventually Ezio throws Cesare from the castle walls, killing him. With no perceived further threats, Ezio takes to hide the Apple under the [[Colosseum]]. In the present, Desmond is able to navigate through the underground chambers beneath the Colosseum to locate the Apple. As he picks it up, Desmond is witness to another hologram figure, calling herself Juno, and who controls Desmond to stab Lucy (because Lucy has defected to the Templars) before he falls into a coma.\n\n''Brotherhood'' shares many of the same features as the previous game though it takes place primarily in Rome. Similar to the villa, the player is able to spend money to buy and upgrade shops and other facilities throughout the city as to increase revenue they can collect from it; however, the player will be required to destroy Borgia towers that control various sections of the city before they can do so.  The Brotherhood of Assassins is introduced, by which, after saving citizens from certain events, the player can invite these citizens as Assassins; they can then be dispatched to remote locations across Europe to gain experience and money, or can be called in to help the player directly in a mission. For the first time in the series, the game features online multiplayer. Players play as Abstergo employees, who, through the use of the Animus, take on the genetic memories of Renaissance Templars in various game modes.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://kotaku.com/5531849/gamestop-placeholder-art-names-assassins-creed-brotherhood---update |title=GameStop Placeholder Art Names Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood \u2013 Update |newspaper=[[Kotaku]] |date=May 5, 2010 |accessdate=October 21, 2010 |last=Fahey |first=Mike |author-link=Mike Fahey |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829145121/http://kotaku.com/5531849/gamestop-placeholder-art-names-assassins-creed-brotherhood---update |archivedate=August 29, 2014  }}</ref> It was the last game to feature ''Assassin's Creed'' creator [[Patrice D\u00e9silets]], as the creative director of the series.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/07/20/life-after-ubisoft-again.aspx |title=Assassin's Creed Creator Talks Life After Ubisoft, Again |last=Bertz |first=Matt |date=July 20, 2015 |access-date=November 29, 2017 |newspaper=[[GameInformer]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822214710/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/07/20/life-after-ubisoft-again.aspx |archivedate=August 22, 2017  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/06/11/patrice-d-233-silets-walks-away-from-ubisoft-and-assassin-s-creed.aspx |title=Update: Patrice D\u00e9silets Walks Away From Ubisoft And Assassin's Creed |last=McNamara |first=Andy |author-link=Andy McNamara |date=June 11, 2010 |access-date=November 29, 2017 |newspaper=[[GameInformer]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201180243/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/06/11/patrice-d-233-silets-walks-away-from-ubisoft-and-assassin-s-creed.aspx |archivedate=December 1, 2017  }}</ref>\n\n====''Assassin's Creed: Revelations''====\n{{main|Assassin's Creed: Revelations}}\n\nWithin the computerized \"core\" of the Animus, Subject 16 ([[Clay Kaczmarek]]) explains to a comatose Desmond that his mind must achieve full synchronization with Alta\u00efr and Ezio, or he will fall into [[dementia]]. Desmond sees Ezio's memories, years after ''Brotherhood'', Ezio researches the Assassins' history and travels to Masyaf to locate Alta\u00efr's library, rumored to hold great power within. The Templars seek to open this library, but it is locked by five keys, hidden in the Ottoman-held [[Constantinople]]. Ezio finds the city in a feud between brothers [[Selim I|Selim]] and [[\u015eehzade Ahmet|Ahmet]] vying for the Sultanate. Ezio is aided by [[List of Assassin's Creed characters#Sofia Sartor|Sofia Sartor]]; the two fall in love. Eventually, Ahmet reveals himself to be a Templar, and is killed by Selim after he battles with Ezio. Ezio uses the keys to witness Alta\u00efr's memories before and after [[Al Mualim]]'s death, which show the death of Alta\u00efr's wife and youngest son in the midst of a [[coup d'etat]] within the Assassins. Altair exiles himself for twenty years, eventually returning to Masyaf to kill the usurper and retake control. Alta\u00efr inscribes his memories in the keys and asks his friend [[Niccol\u00f2 Polo]] to hide them. Afterwards, Ezio and Sofia go to Masyaf and open the library to find Alta\u00efr's corpse and a Piece of Eden. Ezio leaves it and his assassin tools, and tells Desmond, understanding now of his role as a messenger to him. A holographic being calling himself Jupiter explains to Desmond through Ezio how his society perished as a result of a massive [[solar flare]] apocalypse, and that the key to stop the 2012 solar flare lies in the first civilization's technology commanded by vaults linked to a central vault in New York. Within the Animus, Clay sacrifices himself to allow Desmond to wake up from his coma, his memories complete. Along with Shaun, Rebecca, and his father William, Desmond heads to New York to save humanity.\n\nOriginally ''Revelations'' was announced as ''Assassin's Creed: Lost Legacy'', and conceptualized as a [[Nintendo 3DS]] title focusing on Ezio traveling to Masyaf. However, on July 15, 2011, it was announced as cancelled. The reason behind such \"cancellation\" was that Ubisoft had decided to expand the idea further, cancel the 3DS development and fully shift all development duties towards PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC to release the game as a full-fledged main installment of the franchise. The original plot remained, and evolved into the plot seen in the final game, which became ''Assassin's Creed: Revelations''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Philips|first=Tom|title=Assassin's Creed: Lost Legacy canned|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-07-15-assassins-creed-lost-legacy-canned|website=Eurogamer|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718043046/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-07-15-assassins-creed-lost-legacy-canned|archivedate=July 18, 2011|date=July 15, 2011}}</ref> Included were many new systems and additional weapons such as bomb-crafting, allowing the player to create explosive, distraction and tactical bombs, using materials found throughout the world and on Assassin's Guild missions. The hookblade was also introduced, which can be used in free-running (to travel along zip wires and climb more easily) and in combat (to manipulate enemies). Eagle Vision was upgraded into the Eagle Sense, allowing Ezio to not only see where his enemies and targets are but also, where they have been and where they are moving to. As the player progresses through, Ezio can train new recruits to defend \"dens\", Assassin headquarters, and an upgraded Assassin's missions section called \"Mediterranean Defense\" in which the player works to strip control of various cities from Templar hands. The multiplayer mode returned in ''Revelations'', with more characters, modes, and maps, and by advancing up through levels of experience, the player learns more about Abstergo's history.\n\n====''Assassin's Creed III''====\n{{Main|Assassin's Creed III}}\n{{Long plot|section|date=January 2017}}\n\nDesmond and his allies arrive at the Temple in a New York cave on October 31, 2012, where they discover a larger chamber of Precursor technology behind it, including another door. Desmond suddenly falls into a [[fugue state]], and is put into the Animus.\n\nIn the Animus, he experiences the memories of Haytham Kenway, a [[British people|British]] Templar agent, who had gone to the American Colonies with a stolen medallion and recruit Templar allies such as [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]]. He gained the [[Mohawk people]]'s trust to find the Temple the medallion leads to. To his annoyance, the medallion did not open the Temple for him. The remainder of the game shifts to the memories of Haytham's son, [[Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton]], whose heritage is half Mohawk. As a young boy, he witnesses Lee and his troops set fire to his village, killing his mother; years later, he is shown a Piece of Eden, through which Juno speaks to him and instructs him to receive training from the retired Assassin, Achilles Davenport, who later inducts him into the order and nicknames him \"Connor\" (in memory of his son, who was killed in the [[American Revolution]]). Through him, Connor meets Patriots in the Revolution, helping them to stop several Templar plans, including an assassination attempt against [[George Washington]]. Between memories, Desmond helps his allies recover power sources to power the Temple scattered around the globe, including one held by Abstergo.\n\nConnor eventually faces his father and kills Lee; ending the Templar threat, before hiding the amulet. Desmond wakes up on December 21, and with his allies finds the buried medallion; the key to the inner Temple door. Behind it is a control sphere capable of stopping the solar flare. Juno appears and encourages Desmond to touch it, but Minerva appears and warns him not to, as it would release Juno as an entity that would protect against the solar flare, but would also become a threat to mankind's future. Desmond opts to release Juno, believing humanity will have a better chance fighting Juno. The energy from the control sphere protects Earth from the solar flare, but kills Desmond.\n\n''Assassin's Creed III'' is structured similarly to the previous games, with missions taking place on an open-world map based on Colonial Boston and New York, and offers a large wilderness area, the Frontier and in the Davenport Homestead, where the player can hunt animals for materials, which subsequently can be used to construct goods to be traded and sold throughout the colonies. Naval battles were introduced, wherein the player must steer a warship named ''Aquila'' in dangerous waters and perform ship-to-ship combat with cannons and mounted guns. In ''Assassin's Creed III'' there are a large assortment of side missions to play and many different outfits to purchase as the player progresses through the game. The modern-day aspects of the story were significantly expanded, and featured missions taking place in, among other locations, Manhattan, Rome and Brazil.\n\n====''Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag''====\n{{Main|Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag}}\nSamples taken from Desmond Miles' body in the moments after his death have enabled Abstergo Industries to continue to explore his genetic memories using the Animus' newfound cloud computing abilities. The unnamed player character is hired by Abstergo's entertainment division to sift through the memories of Edward Kenway, an eighteenth-century pirate and the grandfather of Connor. Ostensibly, this is to gather material for an Animus-powered interactive video game, but in reality, Abstergo and the Templars are searching for the Observatory, a Precursor structure that allows the user to see through the eyes of a subject. As Kenway, the player must unravel a conspiracy between high-ranking Templars to manipulate the British, Spanish and French empires into locating the Sage \u2013 later identified as [[Bartholomew Roberts]] \u2013 who is the only man who can lead them to the Observatory.\n\nIn the present day, the player is contacted by John, Abstergo Entertainment's information technology manager. John convinces the player that his employer knows more than they are telling, and encourages them to investigate in more detail. He arranges for the player to access the Animus' core, at which point Juno materialises into an incorporeal form. She reveals that although it was necessary to open her temple to avert disaster, the world was not ready for her, and she is unable to affect it or possess the player character as her agents intended. John is unmasked as the reincarnated form of the Sage and attempts to murder the player to cover up the failed attempt at resurrecting Juno, but is killed by Abstergo's security before he can do so. As Roberts, the Sage admits to Kenway that he owes no allegiance to the Assassins or the Templars and instead uses whoever he thinks represents his best chance of achieving his ends.\n\n====''Assassin's Creed Rogue''====\n{{main|Assassin's Creed Rogue}}\nThe plot follows Assassin-turned-Templar, [[Shay Patrick Cormac]], and is set during the [[Seven Years' War]] across various locations in northeastern North America and the North Atlantic.<ref name=\"PolygonRogue\">{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/5/5971421/assassins-creed-rogue-trailer-confirmed-ubisoft|title=Assassin's Creed Rogue confirmed by Ubisoft \u2013 here's the first trailer|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|work=Polygon|date=August 5, 2014|accessdate=August 5, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806140407/http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/5/5971421/assassins-creed-rogue-trailer-confirmed-ubisoft|archivedate=August 6, 2014}}</ref> It is meant to \"fill the gaps\" of the story between ''III'' and ''Black Flag'' and has \"a crucial link to the Kenway saga\", as well as connecting to ''Unity''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2014/08/05/september-cover-reveal-assassins-creed-rogue-unity.aspx|title=September Cover Revealed \u2013 Assassin's Creed Rogue And Unity|last=Wallace|first=Kimberly|publisher=GameStop|work=Game Informer|date=August 5, 2014|accessdate=August 5, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805190710/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2014/08/05/september-cover-reveal-assassins-creed-rogue-unity.aspx|archivedate=August 5, 2014}}</ref>  Haytham Kenway from ''III'' and [[Ad\u00e9wal\u00e9]] from ''Black Flag'' make appearances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/sources-assassins-creed-comet-will-let-you-play-as-a-1552929846|title=Sources: Assassin's Creed Comet Will Let You Play As A Templar|last=Schreier|first=Jason|publisher=Kotaku|date=March 27, 2014|accessdate=March 27, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328120043/http://kotaku.com/sources-assassins-creed-comet-will-let-you-play-as-a-1552929846|archivedate=March 28, 2014}}</ref>\n\nBy March 2014, a game titled or code-named \"''Comet''\" was revealed to be in development, for release on [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]].<ref name=\"KotakuUnity\" /> By the end of the month, additional reports indicated that ''Comet'' would be set around 1758 in New York, as well as feature sailing on the Atlantic Ocean.

One day a stranger appears, a Chinese female Assassin called [[Shao Jun]], who came to Ezio in order to seek knowledge of his life as an Assassin. Although Ezio prefers that Jun not stay, due to his desire to leave his days as an Assassin behind, Sofia allows her to stay for the night. The next day, Ezio catches Jun reading his memoirs and bids her to leave, but relents after she asks him about what it means to be an Assassin. While on a trip to [[Firenze]], Ezio recounts his story of how his father and brothers were executed in the town square, forcing him to become an Assassin (the events of ''[[Assassin's Creed II#Plot|Assassin's Creed II]]''), and how such a life is defined by the pain it brings and causes. As they leave, the two are attacked by a stranger, who appears to be of Asian origin as well. After killing him, Jun reveals that she was a former [[concubine]], now on the run from servants of the Chinese [[Zhengde Emperor]], and explains how her former master rescued her from his influence. After returning to his home, Ezio tells Sofia and his children to leave, knowing that others would come. He then teaches Jun the key to liberating her people from the Emperor's influence. Later that night, Ezio's villa is attacked by more of Shao Jun's enemies, and after a fight, he successfully eliminates them all. The next morning, Ezio hands Shao Jun a small box and tells her it may come to use one day, but only if \"you lose your way\". He then sends her away as two riders appear at the villa. Sometime afterward Ezio journeys to Firenze with his wife Sofia and their daughter Flavia, despite suffering from heart problems. While resting on a bench and after having a short conversation with a young man with a scar on his face, similar to the sort of man he used to be, he exhales and dies in view of his family. The film then ends as a final letter from Ezio to Sofia is read, saying that of all the things that kept him going throughout life, love for the world around him was the strongest of them all.\n\n===Comics===\n<!-- [[Assassin's Creed (comics)]] redirects here. -->\n\n====''Assassin's Creed: Graphic Novel''====\nIn the limited edition of ''Assassin's Creed'', an 8-page [[graphic novel]] was included, that showed two side-stories of Alta\u00efr Ibn-La'Ahad and Desmond Miles.

It depicts a centuries-old struggle, now and then, between the [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]], who fight for peace with free will, and the [[Knights Templar|Templars]], who desire peace through control. The series features [[historical fiction]], [[science fiction]] and [[fictional characters|characters]], intertwined with real-world [[historical events]] and [[historical figures|figures]]. For the majority of time players control an Assassin in the past history, while they also play as Desmond Miles or an Assassin Initiate in the present day, who hunt down their Templar targets.\n\nThe video game series took inspiration from the novel ''[[Alamut (Bartol novel)|Alamut]]'' by the Slovenian writer [[Vladimir Bartol]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/148805/interviews/assassins-creed/|title=Interview: Assassin's Creed|publisher=CVG|accessdate=September 2, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025102806/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/148805/interviews/assassins-creed/|archivedate=October 25, 2012}}</ref> while building upon concepts from the ''[[Prince of Persia]]'' series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-assassins-creed|title=The Making Of: Assassin's Creed|publisher=EDGE|date=August 27, 2012|accessdate=March 3, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228044009/http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-assassins-creed/|archivedate=December 28, 2013}}</ref> The series's [[Assassin's Creed (video game)|eponymous first title]] was released in 2007, and it has featured eleven main games in total, the most recent being 2018's ''[[Assassin's Creed Odyssey]]''.\n\nA new story and time period are introduced in each entry, and gameplay elements evolve from the previous one. There are three story arcs in the series. For the first five main games, the framing story is set in 2012 and features series protagonist [[Desmond Miles]] who uses a machine called the Animus and relives the memories of his ancestors to find a way to avert the [[2012 phenomenon|2012 apocalypse]]. In games up until and including ''[[Assassin's Creed Syndicate]]'', Abstergo employees and Assassin initiates recorded genetic memories using the Helix software, helping the Templars and Assassins find new Pieces of Eden in the modern world. The latest two games, ''[[Assassin's Creed Origins]]'' and ''[[Assassin's Creed Odyssey]]'' follow ex-Abstergo employee Layla Hassan as she is recruited into the Assassin Order.\n\nMain games of ''Assassin's Creed'' are set in an [[open world]] and presented from the [[third-person perspective]] where the protagonists take down targets using their combat and stealth skills with the exploitation of the environment. Players have freedom to explore the historical settings as they finish main and side quests. Apart from single-player missions, some games also provide competitive and cooperative multiplayer gameplay. While main games are produced for major consoles and desktop platforms, multiple spin-off games are released for consoles, mobiles, and handhelds platforms.\n\nThe main games in the ''Assassin's Creed'' video game series have received generally positive reviews for their ambition in visuals, game design, and narratives, with criticism towards the yearly release cycle and frequent bugs. The spin-off games received mixed to positive reviews. The video game series has received multiple awards and nominations, including Game of the Year awards. It is commercially successful, selling over 140 million copies {{as of|2019|9|lc=y}}, becoming Ubisoft's best-selling franchise and one of the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|highest selling video game franchises of all time]]. ''Assassin's Creed'' was adapted into a [[Assassin's Creed (film)|film]], which received negative reviews. A series of art books, encyclopedias, comics, novelizations, and [[Assassin's Creed (book series)|novels]] haven been published. All of the media take place within the same continuity as the main video game series.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ubisoft developper team of Assasians creed on Quebec Remparts vs Titan d'Acadie-Bathurst on Centre Vid\u00e9otron, Qu\u00e9bec city 02.jpg|thumb|Members of Ubisoft Quebec, developer team of the latest title in the series, ''Assassin's Creed Odyssey'']]\nThe ''Assassin's Creed'' series originated out of ideas for a sequel for ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]'', a 3D adaption of the original ''[[Prince of Persia]]'' games, which was made for [[PlayStation 2]], [[GameCube]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and other platforms. It included a number of [[parkour]] moves and combat. ''The Sands of Time'' was a critical and financial success, leading publisher Ubisoft to request Ubisoft Montreal to develop a sequel, aiming for the [[seventh generation of video game consoles|next console generation]]. The Ubisoft Montreal team decided on taking the gameplay from ''The Sands of Time'' into an [[open world]] approach, taking advantage of the improved processing power to render larger spaces and crowds. Narratively, the team wanted to move away from the Prince being someone next in line for the throne but to have to work for it; combined with research into secret societies led them to focus on the [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]], heavily borrowing from the novel ''[[Alamut (Bartol novel)|Alamut]]''.<ref name=\"polygon oral\">{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/features/2018/10/3/17924770/assassins-creed-an-oral-history-patrice-desilets | title=  Assassin's Creed: An oral history | first = Richard | last = Moss | date = October 3, 2018 | accessdate = October 3, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref>\n\nThey developed a narrative where the player would control an Assassin that served as a bodyguard for a non-playable Prince, leading them to call this game ''Prince of Persia: Assassin''. Ubisoft was not happy with a ''Prince of Persia'' game without the Prince as the playable character, but this led to the marketing division to suggest the name ''Assassin's Creed'', playing off the creed of the Assassins, \"nothing is true; everything is permitted\". Ubisoft Montreal ran with this in creating a new [[intellectual property]], eliminating the Prince and creating the conflict between the Assassins and [[Templar Knights]]. Further, in postulating what other assassinations they could account for throughout human history, they came onto the idea of [[genetic memory (psychology)|genetic memory]] and created the \"Animus\" device and modern storyline elements, which further allowed them to explain certain facets of gameplay, such as accounting when the player fails a mission, in the same way they had done in ''The Sands of Time''.<ref name=\"polygon oral\"/>\n\nFollowing release of the first ''Assassin's Creed'' in 2007, Ubisoft Montreal and other Ubisoft studios use the series to present games from various historical periods, striving for historical accuracy while conceding some elements for gameplay.<ref name=\"polygon oral\"/>\n\n==Premise==\n[[File:Abstergo 2.png|thumb|''- \"We change the world. Every day, in a hundred different ways.\"'' -<br />The fictional slogan and logo of [[Abstergo Industries]] from the ''Assassin's Creed'' franchise]]\nThe ''Assassin's Creed'' games primarily revolve around the rivalry and conflict between two ancient secret societies \u2014 the [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]], who represent freedom, and the [[Knights Templar]], who represent order; as well as their indirect relation to an [[Ancient astronauts|ancient species pre-dating humanity]], referred to within the games as \"those who came before\" or \"precursors\", who were technologically advanced and claimed to be the creators of humanity, before their society and much of Earth's biosphere were destroyed by a massive [[Coronal mass ejection|solar storm]] thousands of years before the games. The games' are split between various real-world settings in different chronological periods - the present, modern day era, and various historical settings, the latter including a variety of historical characters given fictionalized involvement in the conflict between the two secret societies.\n\nThe main premise focuses on the efforts of the Assassins in stopping the Knights Templars from finding and securing various artifacts of the ancient species, known as \"Pieces of Eden\", which hold great power and are capable of controlling [[free will]]. In the modern era, the Assassins, also known as \"The Brotherhood\", focus on combating the Templars, who evolved with the world and developed into a [[mega-corporation]] [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] with multiple branches called Astergo Industries. To help trace Pieces of Eden to locations in the modern-era world, Astergo secretly develops a device called the \"Animus\" - a computerized system that can allow one to \"re-live\" and experience the memories of previous people through remnants of their genetic material. Initially only capable of allowing a person to explore the memories of their genetic ancestors, later improvements to the Animus allow virtualy anyone to experience the lives of any person used in the device. Overexposure to the animus causes the \"bleeding effect\", which results in giving the user skills and abilities of his ancestors, but is also dangerous for the user as it can damage their mind, causing symptoms such as [[dementia]], [[insanity]], [[dissociative identity disorder]] or [[brain damage]].\n\nThe initial story arc of the games focuses on the efforts of the Brotherhood to thwart Astergo's plans to secure a Piece of Eden and ultimately to uncover a method to prevent the world being destroyed by another solar storm in 2012, while several titles after this focus on the efforts of each side to cause problems for their opponent in their continuing conflict. The release of ''Origins'' introduced a new story arc focused on a researcher who becomes involved in searching out memories of ancient assassins, and becoming involved in seeking the means to prevent either society gaining the upper-hand over the other.\n\n===Protagonists===\n{{main|List of Assassin's Creed characters}}\n[[Desmond Miles]] is a bartender who is a descendant of several lines of prominent [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]]; though raised as an Assassin, he left his nomadic family to seek out a more common lifestyle. He is initially kidnapped by Abstergo, which is aware of his ancestral lineage. Desmond is forced into the Animus and is revealed to be subject 17; many of the sixteen previous subjects died as a result of Animus over-exposure.\n\nDesmond is later rescued by a small team of modern-day Assassins and agrees to work with them, continuing to experience the memories of his ancestors to discover the locations of additional Pieces of Eden so they can be recovered before Abstergo can do so. From the bleeding effect, Desmond gains some of the Assassin skills of his predecessors at the cost of living with multiple sets of memories and personalities in his mind.\n\nWithin the Animus, Desmond explores the memories of a number of Assassins, including [[Alta\u00efr Ibn-La'Ahad]], an initially disgraced Assassin working to redeem himself during the [[Third Crusade]]; [[Ezio Auditore da Firenze]], an Assassin in Italy during the late 15th and early 16th centuries of the [[Italian Renaissance]]; and [[Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton]], otherwise known as Connor, a half-[[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], half-[[British people|British]] Assassin during the [[American Revolution]].\n\nThroughout these events, Desmond learns of allusions to the prophetic [[2012 phenomenon|end of the world in 2012]] from a former Animus test subject, Subject 16; the event turns out to be a repeat of the disaster which wiped out the ancient civilization, and he finds out that his memories hold the key to Earth's surviving a second solar storm. During his experiences, Desmond is aided by holographic projections of three of the ancient race's rulers: Jupiter, Minerva, and Juno.\n\nAfter Desmond dies to ensure Earth's survival, his memories, which have survived through genetic samples of his DNA,<ref name=\"GI preview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/assassins_creed_iv_black_flag/b/playstation4/archive/2013/03/04/assassin-39-s-creed-iv-black-flag-preview.aspx|title=Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag|last=Vore|first=Bryan|publisher=Gameinformer.com|date=March 4, 2013|accessdate=March 4, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306035746/http://www.gameinformer.com/games/assassins_creed_iv_black_flag/b/playstation4/archive/2013/03/04/assassin-39-s-creed-iv-black-flag-preview.aspx|archivedate=March 6, 2013}}</ref> are accessed by Abstergo, which hires a new subject to enter the Animus.

This provides a means of a diegetic interface, showing Desmond's ancestor's health, equipment, goals, and other features as part of the Animus interface. The Animus is based on the player controlling the assassin to maintain the synchronization between Desmond and his ancestor's memories. Performing actions that go against the Assassin's way or dying breaks the synchronization, effectively requiring the player to restart at a previous checkpoint. Furthermore, the player cannot explore outside areas that the assassin has not experienced yet. There are also abnormalities within the Animus from previous users of the device.\n\nWhile playing as the Assassin characters, the games are generally presented from a [[Third-person (video games)|third-person perspective]] in an [[open world]] environment, focusing on [[Stealth game|stealth]] and [[parkour]]. The games use a mission structure to follow the main story, generally assigning the player to complete an assassination of public figureheads or a covert mission. Alternatively, several side missions are available, such as mapping out the expansive cities from a high perch followed by performing a \"leap of faith\" into a haystack below, collecting treasures hidden across the cities, exploring ruins for relics, building a brotherhood of assassins to perform other tasks, or funding the rebuilding of a city through purchasing and upgrading of shops and other features. At times, the player is in direct control of Desmond, who by nature of the Animus use has learned Assassin techniques through the bleeding effect, as well as their genetic ability of Eagle Vision, which separates friend, foe and assassination targets by illuminating people in different colors. Through the Animus interface, the player can go back to retry any past mission already completed; for example, in ''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood'', the player achieves better synchronization results by performing the mission in a specific manner such as by only killing the mission's target.\n\nThe games use the concept of \"active\" versus \"passive\" moves, with \"active\" moves, such as running, climbing the sides of buildings, or jumping between rooftops, more likely to alert the attention of nearby guards. When the guards become alerted, the player must either fight them or break their line of sight and locate a hiding place, such as a haystack or a well, and wait until the guards' alert is reduced. The combat system allows for a number of unique weapons, armor, and moves, including the use of a hidden blade set in a bracer on the Assassin's arm, and which also can be used to quietly assassinate targets.\n\n==Release history==\nThe following table lists the games created for the franchise and the respective platform(s) they released upon:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!Title\n!Released\n!Platform\n!Other\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed]]''\n|2007\n|[[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed: Alta\u00efr's Chronicles]]''\n|2008\n|[[Nintendo DS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iOS]], [[Symbian]], [[webOS]], [[Windows Phone]]\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines]]''\n|rowspan=\"3\"|2009\n|[[PlayStation Portable]]\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed II]]''\n|PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], [[OS X]], Windows, Symbian\n|[[OnLive]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed II: Discovery]]''\n|Nintendo DS, iOS\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood]]''\n|2010\n|PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, OS X, Windows\n|rowspan=\"2\"|OnLive\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed: Revelations]]''\n|2011\n|PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows, Android, Symbian\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed III]]''\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2012\n|PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, [[Wii U]], PlayStation 4, Xbox One, [[Nintendo Switch]], [[Symbian]]\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed III: Liberation]]''<ref group=\"lower-alpha\" name=\"Liberation HD\">Released under the title ''Assassin's Creed: Liberation HD'' for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.</ref>\n|PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, [[PlayStation Vita]]\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag]]''\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2013\n|PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii U, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed: Pirates]]''\n|Windows,<ref group=\"lower-alpha\" name=\"Pirates\">Available for Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 from the Microsoft store.</ref> Android, iOS\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed: Freedom Cry]]''<ref group=\"lower-alpha\" name=\"FreedomCry\">Originally released as DLC for all versions of ''Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag''.</ref>\n|rowspan=\"4\"|2014\n|PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Windows\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Rogue]]''\n|PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Windows\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Identity]]''\n|Android, iOS\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Unity]]''\n|PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Chronicles|Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China]]''<ref group=\"lower-alpha\" name=\"ChroniclesChina\">Originally announced as part of the season pass for ''Assassin's Creed Unity''.</ref>\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2015\n|PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows, PlayStation Vita<ref group=\"lower-alpha\" name=\"PSVita\">Released as a compilation titled ''Assassin's Creed Chronicles Trilogy Pack''.</ref>\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Syndicate]]''\n|PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Chronicles|Assassin's Creed Chronicles: India]]''\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2016\n|rowspan=\"2\"|PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows, PlayStation Vita<ref group=\"lower-alpha\" name=\"PSVita\"/>\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Chronicles|Assassin's Creed Chronicles: Russia]]''\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Origins]]''\n|2017\n|rowspan=\"2\"|PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Odyssey]]''\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2018\n|[[Google Stadia|Stadia]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed#Assassin's Creed Rebellion|Assassin's Creed Rebellion]]''\n|Android, iOS\n|\u2014\n|}\n\n; Notes\n<references group=\"lower-alpha\" />\n\n===Main series===\n\n====''Assassin's Creed''====\n{{main|Assassin's Creed (video game)}}\nDesmond Miles is captured by Abstergo and forced to use a machine called the Animus to explore Alta\u00efr ibn-La'Ahad's memories during the time of the [[Third Crusade]]. Desmond begins to witness events after Alta\u00efr breaks all three tenets of the Assassin Brotherhood while attempting to stop [[Robert IV de Sabl\u00e9|Robert de Sabl\u00e9]] from taking a Piece of Eden. [[Al Mualim]], the Brotherhood's leader, demotes Alta\u00efr to Novice and tasks him with assassinating the nine Knights Templars, including de Sabl\u00e9, to regain his former status. Alta\u00efr's quest eventually leads him to face de Sabl\u00e9 in the presence of King [[Richard I of England]] warning the King of de Sabl\u00e9's plot to kill him. Alta\u00efr defeats de Sabl\u00e9, but with his last words, de Sabl\u00e9 reveals that there were ten Templars, the last being Al Mualim, who now holds the Piece of Eden. Alta\u00efr returns to face Al Mualim and struggles to fight through illusions created by the Piece, but eventually kills Al Mualim. When Alta\u00efr recovers the piece, he and those watching the Animus view a holographic map showing where other artifacts are located across the globe. Desmond is pulled from the Animus, and was going to be killed, but his life is spared by [[Lucy Stillman]], an Assassin working as a mole within Abstergo, as she claims they might need to further examine his memories later. He comes to learn that a former test subject had left messages only Desmond can see, foretelling the end of the world in 2012.\n\nThe first ''Assassin's Creed'' introduced core elements that remained  in the rest of the game series. The game creates fictionalized, historical versions of [[Masyaf]] (the Brotherhood's location), [[Jerusalem]], [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] and [[Damascus]], and incorporates a number of documented historical figures into the story. Other core elements include the virtualized Animus system, free running, climbing, stealth, [[parkour]], and the initial formulation of the combat system. The game requires the player to complete a number of side quests before they are able to obtain an assassin quest from a local Brotherhood guidemaster in each city, but this side quest prerequisite was abandoned in future games.\n\n====''Assassin's Creed II''====\n{{main|Assassin's Creed II}}\nLucy returns and breaks Desmond out of Abstergo, taking him to an Assassin safehouse to work alongside Shaun, a historian, and Rebecca, their technical support. Using an improved version of the Animus, Desmond takes witness to Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a young nobleman from the late 15th century in [[Florence]], shortly before the execution of Ezio's father and brothers by order of a corrupt official working for the Templars. He, his mother, and sister take to hiding at the Monteriggioni villa owned by his uncle Mario, who helps to train Ezio in the ways of an Assassin. Ezio and Mario discover that Rodrigo Borgia is the figurehead of a number of Templars all who were accomplices in the execution of his family, and with help of allies like [[Leonardo da Vinci]], methodically assassinate the lower-ranked Templars, while learning that Borgia has acquired a Piece of Eden called the Apple. Eventually, Ezio corners Borgia, who hands over the Piece and flees; Ezio is inducted into the ranks of the Brotherhood and believed to be a prophet based on their codex. A decade later, the Brotherhood learns that Borgia has since become [[Pope Alexander VI]], using the Church's influence to strengthen the Templars. Ezio invades [[Vatican City]] and confronts Borgia, discovering that the Papal staff is also a Piece of Eden. Defeating Borgia but sparing his life, Ezio uses both the Apple and the Papal staff to reveal a chamber of ancient technology. Inside, he is addressed by a hologram of a humanoid female that calls herself Minerva who speaks directly to Desmond through Ezio. Minerva explains how her society had pre-dated humanity's, but a great disaster nearly wiped them out, and warns that another event is due to occur soon, putting the fate of humanity in Desmond's hands. Upon this discovery, Desmond and his allies find the safehouse has been compromised by Abstergo and flee.\n\nSimilar to the first game, ''Assassin's Creed II'' takes place in historical recreations of [[Venice]], [[Florence]], [[Forl\u00ec]], [[San Gimignano]], and the [[Tuscany|Tuscan countryside]], and incorporates events during that period as part of the story. Missions are divided into main story missions, themselves divided into memory sequences reflecting points in Ezio's life, and side missions which can be accomplished at any time; this approach to mission structure remains consistent in the other games in the series. The Monteriggioni villa provides several functions which can be expanded on by paying money for upgrades of surrounding buildings, or by purchasing artwork, weapons, and armor for the villa; in turn, the villa will generate wealth for the player at a rate influenced by the upgrades and acquisition of these items. Additional quests involve locating secret Assassin seals, and finding hidden marks left by \"Subject 16\", a former Animus user, that hint at the nature of Minerva's society.\n\n====''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood''====\n{{main|Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood}}\nDesmond and his allies retreat to the ruins of the Monteriggioni villa, and Desmond reenters the Animus to continue Ezio's memories, specifically to identify the location of the Apple. After facing Rodrigo Borgia, Ezio returned to Monteriggioni, but the villa is soon attacked by forces under the command of [[Cesare Borgia]], Rodrigo's son. Mario is killed and the Apple is stolen. Ezio vows revenge by helping to free the people of Rome from the Borgia family. As Ezio works covertly to turn the city against the Borgias, he gains followers that want to join his cause, and Ezio trains them in the way of the Assassins. In an attempt to assassinate Cesare and Rodrigo at the [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], Ezio instead witnesses Cesare forcing his father to eat a poisoned apple that Rodrigo had prepared to kill his son. Ezio chases down Cesare and eventually captures him and recovers the Apple. Cesare is taken to prison in Viana, Spain but manages to escape with help of his allies. The Assassins lead the fight against Cesare and the remaining loyal Borgia troops, and eventually Ezio throws Cesare from the castle walls, killing him. With no perceived further threats, Ezio takes to hide the Apple under the [[Colosseum]]. In the present, Desmond is able to navigate through the underground chambers beneath the Colosseum to locate the Apple. As he picks it up, Desmond is witness to another hologram figure, calling herself Juno, and who controls Desmond to stab Lucy (because Lucy has defected to the Templars) before he falls into a coma.\n\n''Brotherhood'' shares many of the same features as the previous game though it takes place primarily in Rome. Similar to the villa, the player is able to spend money to buy and upgrade shops and other facilities throughout the city as to increase revenue they can collect from it; however, the player will be required to destroy Borgia towers that control various sections of the city before they can do so.  The Brotherhood of Assassins is introduced, by which, after saving citizens from certain events, the player can invite these citizens as Assassins; they can then be dispatched to remote locations across Europe to gain experience and money, or can be called in to help the player directly in a mission. For the first time in the series, the game features online multiplayer. Players play as Abstergo employees, who, through the use of the Animus, take on the genetic memories of Renaissance Templars in various game modes.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://kotaku.com/5531849/gamestop-placeholder-art-names-assassins-creed-brotherhood---update |title=GameStop Placeholder Art Names Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood \u2013 Update |newspaper=[[Kotaku]] |date=May 5, 2010 |accessdate=October 21, 2010 |last=Fahey |first=Mike |author-link=Mike Fahey |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829145121/http://kotaku.com/5531849/gamestop-placeholder-art-names-assassins-creed-brotherhood---update |archivedate=August 29, 2014  }}</ref> It was the last game to feature ''Assassin's Creed'' creator [[Patrice D\u00e9silets]], as the creative director of the series.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/07/20/life-after-ubisoft-again.aspx |title=Assassin's Creed Creator Talks Life After Ubisoft, Again |last=Bertz |first=Matt |date=July 20, 2015 |access-date=November 29, 2017 |newspaper=[[GameInformer]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822214710/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/07/20/life-after-ubisoft-again.aspx |archivedate=August 22, 2017  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/06/11/patrice-d-233-silets-walks-away-from-ubisoft-and-assassin-s-creed.aspx |title=Update: Patrice D\u00e9silets Walks Away From Ubisoft And Assassin's Creed |last=McNamara |first=Andy |author-link=Andy McNamara |date=June 11, 2010 |access-date=November 29, 2017 |newspaper=[[GameInformer]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201180243/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/06/11/patrice-d-233-silets-walks-away-from-ubisoft-and-assassin-s-creed.aspx |archivedate=December 1, 2017  }}</ref>\n\n====''Assassin's Creed: Revelations''====\n{{main|Assassin's Creed: Revelations}}\n\nWithin the computerized \"core\" of the Animus, Subject 16 ([[Clay Kaczmarek]]) explains to a comatose Desmond that his mind must achieve full synchronization with Alta\u00efr and Ezio, or he will fall into [[dementia]]. Desmond sees Ezio's memories, years after ''Brotherhood'', Ezio researches the Assassins' history and travels to Masyaf to locate Alta\u00efr's library, rumored to hold great power within. The Templars seek to open this library, but it is locked by five keys, hidden in the Ottoman-held [[Constantinople]]. Ezio finds the city in a feud between brothers [[Selim I|Selim]] and [[\u015eehzade Ahmet|Ahmet]] vying for the Sultanate. Ezio is aided by [[List of Assassin's Creed characters#Sofia Sartor|Sofia Sartor]]; the two fall in love. Eventually, Ahmet reveals himself to be a Templar, and is killed by Selim after he battles with Ezio. Ezio uses the keys to witness Alta\u00efr's memories before and after [[Al Mualim]]'s death, which show the death of Alta\u00efr's wife and youngest son in the midst of a [[coup d'etat]] within the Assassins. Altair exiles himself for twenty years, eventually returning to Masyaf to kill the usurper and retake control. Alta\u00efr inscribes his memories in the keys and asks his friend [[Niccol\u00f2 Polo]] to hide them. Afterwards, Ezio and Sofia go to Masyaf and open the library to find Alta\u00efr's corpse and a Piece of Eden. Ezio leaves it and his assassin tools, and tells Desmond, understanding now of his role as a messenger to him. A holographic being calling himself Jupiter explains to Desmond through Ezio how his society perished as a result of a massive [[solar flare]] apocalypse, and that the key to stop the 2012 solar flare lies in the first civilization's technology commanded by vaults linked to a central vault in New York. Within the Animus, Clay sacrifices himself to allow Desmond to wake up from his coma, his memories complete. Along with Shaun, Rebecca, and his father William, Desmond heads to New York to save humanity.\n\nOriginally ''Revelations'' was announced as ''Assassin's Creed: Lost Legacy'', and conceptualized as a [[Nintendo 3DS]] title focusing on Ezio traveling to Masyaf. However, on July 15, 2011, it was announced as cancelled. The reason behind such \"cancellation\" was that Ubisoft had decided to expand the idea further, cancel the 3DS development and fully shift all development duties towards PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC to release the game as a full-fledged main installment of the franchise. The original plot remained, and evolved into the plot seen in the final game, which became ''Assassin's Creed: Revelations''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Philips|first=Tom|title=Assassin's Creed: Lost Legacy canned|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-07-15-assassins-creed-lost-legacy-canned|website=Eurogamer|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718043046/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-07-15-assassins-creed-lost-legacy-canned|archivedate=July 18, 2011|date=July 15, 2011}}</ref> Included were many new systems and additional weapons such as bomb-crafting, allowing the player to create explosive, distraction and tactical bombs, using materials found throughout the world and on Assassin's Guild missions. The hookblade was also introduced, which can be used in free-running (to travel along zip wires and climb more easily) and in combat (to manipulate enemies). Eagle Vision was upgraded into the Eagle Sense, allowing Ezio to not only see where his enemies and targets are but also, where they have been and where they are moving to. As the player progresses through, Ezio can train new recruits to defend \"dens\", Assassin headquarters, and an upgraded Assassin's missions section called \"Mediterranean Defense\" in which the player works to strip control of various cities from Templar hands. The multiplayer mode returned in ''Revelations'', with more characters, modes, and maps, and by advancing up through levels of experience, the player learns more about Abstergo's history.\n\n====''Assassin's Creed III''====\n{{Main|Assassin's Creed III}}\n{{Long plot|section|date=January 2017}}\n\nDesmond and his allies arrive at the Temple in a New York cave on October 31, 2012, where they discover a larger chamber of Precursor technology behind it, including another door. Desmond suddenly falls into a [[fugue state]], and is put into the Animus.\n\nIn the Animus, he experiences the memories of Haytham Kenway, a [[British people|British]] Templar agent, who had gone to the American Colonies with a stolen medallion and recruit Templar allies such as [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]]. He gained the [[Mohawk people]]'s trust to find the Temple the medallion leads to. To his annoyance, the medallion did not open the Temple for him. The remainder of the game shifts to the memories of Haytham's son, [[Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton]], whose heritage is half Mohawk. As a young boy, he witnesses Lee and his troops set fire to his village, killing his mother; years later, he is shown a Piece of Eden, through which Juno speaks to him and instructs him to receive training from the retired Assassin, Achilles Davenport, who later inducts him into the order and nicknames him \"Connor\" (in memory of his son, who was killed in the [[American Revolution]]). Through him, Connor meets Patriots in the Revolution, helping them to stop several Templar plans, including an assassination attempt against [[George Washington]]. Between memories, Desmond helps his allies recover power sources to power the Temple scattered around the globe, including one held by Abstergo.\n\nConnor eventually faces his father and kills Lee; ending the Templar threat, before hiding the amulet. Desmond wakes up on December 21, and with his allies finds the buried medallion; the key to the inner Temple door. Behind it is a control sphere capable of stopping the solar flare. Juno appears and encourages Desmond to touch it, but Minerva appears and warns him not to, as it would release Juno as an entity that would protect against the solar flare, but would also become a threat to mankind's future. Desmond opts to release Juno, believing humanity will have a better chance fighting Juno. The energy from the control sphere protects Earth from the solar flare, but kills Desmond.\n\n''Assassin's Creed III'' is structured similarly to the previous games, with missions taking place on an open-world map based on Colonial Boston and New York, and offers a large wilderness area, the Frontier and in the Davenport Homestead, where the player can hunt animals for materials, which subsequently can be used to construct goods to be traded and sold throughout the colonies. Naval battles were introduced, wherein the player must steer a warship named ''Aquila'' in dangerous waters and perform ship-to-ship combat with cannons and mounted guns. In ''Assassin's Creed III'' there are a large assortment of side missions to play and many different outfits to purchase as the player progresses through the game. The modern-day aspects of the story were significantly expanded, and featured missions taking place in, among other locations, Manhattan, Rome and Brazil.\n\n====''Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag''====\n{{Main|Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag}}\nSamples taken from Desmond Miles' body in the moments after his death have enabled Abstergo Industries to continue to explore his genetic memories using the Animus' newfound cloud computing abilities. The unnamed player character is hired by Abstergo's entertainment division to sift through the memories of Edward Kenway, an eighteenth-century pirate and the grandfather of Connor. Ostensibly, this is to gather material for an Animus-powered interactive video game, but in reality, Abstergo and the Templars are searching for the Observatory, a Precursor structure that allows the user to see through the eyes of a subject. As Kenway, the player must unravel a conspiracy between high-ranking Templars to manipulate the British, Spanish and French empires into locating the Sage \u2013 later identified as [[Bartholomew Roberts]] \u2013 who is the only man who can lead them to the Observatory.\n\nIn the present day, the player is contacted by John, Abstergo Entertainment's information technology manager. John convinces the player that his employer knows more than they are telling, and encourages them to investigate in more detail. He arranges for the player to access the Animus' core, at which point Juno materialises into an incorporeal form. She reveals that although it was necessary to open her temple to avert disaster, the world was not ready for her, and she is unable to affect it or possess the player character as her agents intended. John is unmasked as the reincarnated form of the Sage and attempts to murder the player to cover up the failed attempt at resurrecting Juno, but is killed by Abstergo's security before he can do so. As Roberts, the Sage admits to Kenway that he owes no allegiance to the Assassins or the Templars and instead uses whoever he thinks represents his best chance of achieving his ends.\n\n====''Assassin's Creed Rogue''====\n{{main|Assassin's Creed Rogue}}\nThe plot follows Assassin-turned-Templar, [[Shay Patrick Cormac]], and is set during the [[Seven Years' War]] across various locations in northeastern North America and the North Atlantic.<ref name=\"PolygonRogue\">{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/5/5971421/assassins-creed-rogue-trailer-confirmed-ubisoft|title=Assassin's Creed Rogue confirmed by Ubisoft \u2013 here's the first trailer|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|work=Polygon|date=August 5, 2014|accessdate=August 5, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806140407/http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/5/5971421/assassins-creed-rogue-trailer-confirmed-ubisoft|archivedate=August 6, 2014}}</ref> It is meant to \"fill the gaps\" of the story between ''III'' and ''Black Flag'' and has \"a crucial link to the Kenway saga\", as well as connecting to ''Unity''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2014/08/05/september-cover-reveal-assassins-creed-rogue-unity.aspx|title=September Cover Revealed \u2013 Assassin's Creed Rogue And Unity|last=Wallace|first=Kimberly|publisher=GameStop|work=Game Informer|date=August 5, 2014|accessdate=August 5, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805190710/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2014/08/05/september-cover-reveal-assassins-creed-rogue-unity.aspx|archivedate=August 5, 2014}}</ref>  Haytham Kenway from ''III'' and [[Ad\u00e9wal\u00e9]] from ''Black Flag'' make appearances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/sources-assassins-creed-comet-will-let-you-play-as-a-1552929846|title=Sources: Assassin's Creed Comet Will Let You Play As A Templar|last=Schreier|first=Jason|publisher=Kotaku|date=March 27, 2014|accessdate=March 27, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328120043/http://kotaku.com/sources-assassins-creed-comet-will-let-you-play-as-a-1552929846|archivedate=March 28, 2014}}</ref>\n\nBy March 2014, a game titled or code-named \"''Comet''\" was revealed to be in development, for release on [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]].<ref name=\"KotakuUnity\" /> By the end of the month, additional reports indicated that ''Comet'' would be set around 1758 in New York, as well as feature sailing on the Atlantic Ocean.

One day a stranger appears, a Chinese female Assassin called [[Shao Jun]], who came to Ezio in order to seek knowledge of his life as an Assassin. Although Ezio prefers that Jun not stay, due to his desire to leave his days as an Assassin behind, Sofia allows her to stay for the night. The next day, Ezio catches Jun reading his memoirs and bids her to leave, but relents after she asks him about what it means to be an Assassin. While on a trip to [[Firenze]], Ezio recounts his story of how his father and brothers were executed in the town square, forcing him to become an Assassin (the events of ''[[Assassin's Creed II#Plot|Assassin's Creed II]]''), and how such a life is defined by the pain it brings and causes. As they leave, the two are attacked by a stranger, who appears to be of Asian origin as well. After killing him, Jun reveals that she was a former [[concubine]], now on the run from servants of the Chinese [[Zhengde Emperor]], and explains how her former master rescued her from his influence. After returning to his home, Ezio tells Sofia and his children to leave, knowing that others would come. He then teaches Jun the key to liberating her people from the Emperor's influence. Later that night, Ezio's villa is attacked by more of Shao Jun's enemies, and after a fight, he successfully eliminates them all. The next morning, Ezio hands Shao Jun a small box and tells her it may come to use one day, but only if \"you lose your way\". He then sends her away as two riders appear at the villa. Sometime afterward Ezio journeys to Firenze with his wife Sofia and their daughter Flavia, despite suffering from heart problems. While resting on a bench and after having a short conversation with a young man with a scar on his face, similar to the sort of man he used to be, he exhales and dies in view of his family. The film then ends as a final letter from Ezio to Sofia is read, saying that of all the things that kept him going throughout life, love for the world around him was the strongest of them all.\n\n===Comics===\n<!-- [[Assassin's Creed (comics)]] redirects here. -->\n\n====''Assassin's Creed: Graphic Novel''====\nIn the limited edition of ''Assassin's Creed'', an 8-page [[graphic novel]] was included, that showed two side-stories of Alta\u00efr Ibn-La'Ahad and Desmond Miles.

A total of {{convert|348.23|mi|km}} of I-94 lie in the state.\n\n==Route description==\n[[File:Zoo Interchange from the east in Milwaukee.jpg|thumb|left|I-894 west at the [[Zoo Interchange]] (I-94)]]\n\nThe route, cosigned with [[U.S. Route 12 in Wisconsin|US 12]], enters from [[Minnesota]] just east of the Twin Cities.  The route passes north of [[Menomonie, Wisconsin|Menomonie]] and south of [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin|Eau Claire]] before turning southeast and heading towards [[Tomah, Wisconsin|Tomah]] where it joins [[Interstate 90 in Wisconsin|I-90]].  The two Interstates [[Concurrency (road)|run concurrently]] for the next {{convert|91.76|mi|km}} to [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]]. I-94 enters the state as a six-lane facility which reduces to four-lane at exit 4 (US 12).\n\nI-94 passes by the popular tourist destination of [[Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin|Wisconsin Dells]].\n\nThe route converges with [[Interstate 39]] {{convert|63|mi|km}} southeast of Tomah (near [[Portage, Wisconsin|Portage]]).  This concurrency ({{convert|30|mi|km|disp=sqbr}}) is the longest three-route concurrency of the [[Interstate Highway system]] and only one of two in existence.  The interchanges mark a return to a six-lane configuration.\n\nI-94 turns eastward toward [[Milwaukee]] at what is commonly known as the \"Badger Interchange\" where the three interstates meet with [[Wisconsin Highway 30|WIS 30]]. The route returns to four lanes after the interchange traffic merges, then returns to six lanes just west of Waukesha.  The highway remains a six-lane facility (with various auxiliary and collector\u2013distributor lanes in Milwaukee at interchanges) east and south of this point, and through the area is officially designated the '''East\u2013West Freeway''', though very few organizations, including the [[Wisconsin Department of Transportation]]'s traffic control center in the area actually use that name.  I-94 passes through downtown Milwaukee, turning southbound and joining [[Interstate 43|I-43]] for {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in}}, into a road designated from Ozaukee County to the Illinois state line as the '''North\u2013South Freeway'''.\n\nI-94 leaves Milwaukee to the south, joining with [[Interstate 41|I-41]] at the [[Mitchell Interchange]]. These two Interstates run concurrently to the border, passing west of [[Racine, Wisconsin|Racine]] and [[Kenosha, Wisconsin|Kenosha]] on their way into [[Illinois]] toward [[Chicago]].  Traffic is heavy along this stretch.\n\n=== Speed limits ===\nThe speed limit on I-94 from the Minnesota border to the Waukesha/Milwaukee county border is 70 mph. Entering Milwaukee County, the limit decreases to 55 mph. The limit is 55 mph until just west of Marquette Interchange, where it decreases to 50 mph. This 50 mph limit continues to the Airport Interchange, where it increases to 55 mph. Between Rawson and Drexel Avenues, the limit increases to 70 mph and maintains this limit to the Illinois border.\n\n==History==\nI-94 was the first section of the [[Interstate Highway System]] completed within the state of [[Wisconsin]].  This {{convert|7|mi|km|adj=on|spell=in}} section, between the unincorporated town of [[Goerke's Corners, Wisconsin|Goerkes Corners]] (currently at the intersection of [[U.S. Highway 18 in Wisconsin|US 18]] and Barker Road) and [[Waukesha, Wisconsin|Waukesha]] was built in 1956.  The route was added segment-by-segment over the years and was completed to its current alignment in 1968.\n\nFrom 2004 until 2008, a portion of I-94 in [[Milwaukee]] was reconstructed as a part of the [[Marquette Interchange|Marquette Interchange project]].\n\n===Current construction===\nBeginning in 2009 and continuing until 2021, the {{convert|35|mi|km}} of I-94 between the Mitchell Interchange and the Illinois state line will be widened from six to eight lanes.  This includes a complete rebuild of the roadway, modern frontage roads, and interchange improvements including a new design of the Mitchell Interchange in Milwaukee County. Additional plans are underway to accommodate the extra traffic and needs of the [[Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin|Mount Pleasant]] [[Foxconn]] plant currently in the design and development stages.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Exit list==\n{{jcttop|exit|length_ref=<ref name=\"WisDOT\">Wisconsin State Trunk Highway Logs:\n*{{cite book |author= Northwest Region Staff |title= State Trunk Highway Log for

A total of {{convert|348.23|mi|km}} of I-94 lie in the state.\n\n==Route description==\n[[File:Zoo Interchange from the east in Milwaukee.jpg|thumb|left|I-894 west at the [[Zoo Interchange]] (I-94)]]\n\nThe route, cosigned with [[U.S. Route 12 in Wisconsin|US 12]], enters from [[Minnesota]] just east of the Twin Cities.  The route passes north of [[Menomonie, Wisconsin|Menomonie]] and south of [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin|Eau Claire]] before turning southeast and heading towards [[Tomah, Wisconsin|Tomah]] where it joins [[Interstate 90 in Wisconsin|I-90]].  The two Interstates [[Concurrency (road)|run concurrently]] for the next {{convert|91.76|mi|km}} to [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]]. I-94 enters the state as a six-lane facility which reduces to four-lane at exit 4 (US 12).\n\nI-94 passes by the popular tourist destination of [[Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin|Wisconsin Dells]].\n\nThe route converges with [[Interstate 39]] {{convert|63|mi|km}} southeast of Tomah (near [[Portage, Wisconsin|Portage]]).  This concurrency ({{convert|30|mi|km|disp=sqbr}}) is the longest three-route concurrency of the [[Interstate Highway system]] and only one of two in existence.  The interchanges mark a return to a six-lane configuration.\n\nI-94 turns eastward toward [[Milwaukee]] at what is commonly known as the \"Badger Interchange\" where the three interstates meet with [[Wisconsin Highway 30|WIS 30]]. The route returns to four lanes after the interchange traffic merges, then returns to six lanes just west of Waukesha.  The highway remains a six-lane facility (with various auxiliary and collector\u2013distributor lanes in Milwaukee at interchanges) east and south of this point, and through the area is officially designated the '''East\u2013West Freeway''', though very few organizations, including the [[Wisconsin Department of Transportation]]'s traffic control center in the area actually use that name.  I-94 passes through downtown Milwaukee, turning southbound and joining [[Interstate 43|I-43]] for {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in}}, into a road designated from Ozaukee County to the Illinois state line as the '''North\u2013South Freeway'''.\n\nI-94 leaves Milwaukee to the south, joining with [[Interstate 41|I-41]] at the [[Mitchell Interchange]]. These two Interstates run concurrently to the border, passing west of [[Racine, Wisconsin|Racine]] and [[Kenosha, Wisconsin|Kenosha]] on their way into [[Illinois]] toward [[Chicago]].  Traffic is heavy along this stretch.\n\n=== Speed limits ===\nThe speed limit on I-94 from the Minnesota border to the Waukesha/Milwaukee county border is 70 mph. Entering Milwaukee County, the limit decreases to 55 mph. The limit is 55 mph until just west of Marquette Interchange, where it decreases to 50 mph. This 50 mph limit continues to the Airport Interchange, where it increases to 55 mph. Between Rawson and Drexel Avenues, the limit increases to 70 mph and maintains this limit to the Illinois border.\n\n==History==\nI-94 was the first section of the [[Interstate Highway System]] completed within the state of [[Wisconsin]].  This {{convert|7|mi|km|adj=on|spell=in}} section, between the unincorporated town of [[Goerke's Corners, Wisconsin|Goerkes Corners]] (currently at the intersection of [[U.S. Highway 18 in Wisconsin|US 18]] and Barker Road) and [[Waukesha, Wisconsin|Waukesha]] was built in 1956.  The route was added segment-by-segment over the years and was completed to its current alignment in 1968.\n\nFrom 2004 until 2008, a portion of I-94 in [[Milwaukee]] was reconstructed as a part of the [[Marquette Interchange|Marquette Interchange project]].\n\n===Current construction===\nBeginning in 2009 and continuing until 2021, the {{convert|35|mi|km}} of I-94 between the Mitchell Interchange and the Illinois state line will be widened from six to eight lanes.  This includes a complete rebuild of the roadway, modern frontage roads, and interchange improvements including a new design of the Mitchell Interchange in Milwaukee County. Additional plans are underway to accommodate the extra traffic and needs of the [[Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin|Mount Pleasant]] [[Foxconn]] plant currently in the design and development stages.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Exit list==\n{{jcttop|exit|length_ref=<ref name=\"WisDOT\">Wisconsin State Trunk Highway Logs:\n*{{cite book |author= Northwest Region Staff |title= State Trunk Highway Log for

{"title_page": "Fighter pilot", "text_new": "{{short description|Military combat aviator}}\n{{About||the film|Fighter Pilot: Operation Red Flag|the BBC documentary|Fighter Pilot (TV series)}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{refimprove|date=January 2013}}\n{{original research|date=November 2010}}\n{{globalize|date=November 2010}}\n}}\n\nA '''fighter pilot''' is a [[Military aviation|military aviator]] trained to engage in [[air-to-air combat]], [[Air-to-ground weaponry|air-to-ground combat]] and sometimes [[Electronic-warfare aircraft|electronic warfare]] while in the [[cockpit]] of a [[fighter aircraft]]. Fighter pilots undergo specialized training in [[aerial warfare]] and [[dogfight]]ing (close range aerial combat). A fighter pilot with at least five air-to-air kills becomes known as an [[flying ace|ace]].\n\n== Recruitment ==\n\nFighter pilots are one of the most highly regarded and desirable positions of any air force. Selection processes only accept the elite out of all the potential candidates. An individual who possesses an exceptional academic record, physical fitness, healthy well-being, and a strong mental drive will have a higher chance of being selected for pilot training. Candidates are also expected to exhibit strong leadership and teamwork abilities. As such, in nearly all air forces, fighter pilots, as are pilots of most other aircraft, are [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned officers]].\n\n== Fitness ==\n[[File:F-15 Eagle female pilots, 3rd Wing.jpg|thumb|Female USAF fighter pilots heading to their jets before takeoff.]]\nFighter pilots must be in [[Optimal health range|optimal health]] to handle the physical demands of modern [[aerial warfare]]. Excellent heart condition is required, as the increased \"G's\" a pilot experiences in a turn can cause stress on the [[Cardiology|cardiovascular system]]. One \"G\" is equal to the force of gravity experienced under normal conditions, two \"G\"s would be twice the force of normal gravity.  Some fighter aircraft can accelerate to up to 9 G\u2019s. Fighter pilots also require strong muscle tissue along the extremities and abdomen, for performing an anti-G straining maneuver (AGSM, see below) when performing tight turns and other highly accelerated maneuvers. Better-than-average [[visual acuity]] is also a highly desirable and valuable trait.\n\n== Tactics ==\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|width=170\n|image1=\n|width1=\n|image2=\n|width2=\n| footer=<center>[[Air Force of Iran|Iranian pilots]] VS [[Air Force of Iraq|Iraqi pilots]] during [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]]</center>\n}}\n\n===Offensive===\nModern medium and long range [[active radar homing]] and [[semi-active radar homing]] missiles can be fired at targets outside or [[Beyond Visual Range missile|beyond visual range]]. However, when a pilot is [[dogfight]]ing at short-range, his position relative to the opponent is decidedly important. Outperformance of another pilot and that pilot's aircraft is critical to maintain the upper-hand. A common saying for [[dogfight]]ing is \"lose sight, lose fight\".\n\nIf one pilot had a greater missile range than the other, he would choose to fire his missile first, before being in range of the enemy's missile. Normally, the facts of an enemy's weapon payload is unknown, and are revealed as the fight progresses.\n\nSome air combat maneuvers form the basis for the sport of [[aerobatics]]:\n\n*Basic\n**[[Split S]]\n**[[Immelmann turn]]\n**[[Thach Weave]]\n**[[The Scissors]]\n**[[Chandelle]]\n*Complex\n**[[Pugachev's Cobra]]\n**[[Herbst maneuver]]\n\n=== Defensive ===\nPilots are trained to employ specific tactics and maneuvers when they are under attack. Attacks from missiles are usually countered with [[electronic countermeasure]]s, [[Flare (countermeasure)|Flares]] and [[chaff (countermeasure)|chaff]]. Missiles like the [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]], however, can actively home in on jamming signals.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nDogfighting at {{convert|1|to|4|mi|m}} is considered \"close\". Pilots perform stressful maneuvers to gain advantage in the dogfight. Pilots need to be in good shape in order to handle the high [[G-force]]s caused by [[Aerial warfare|aerial combat]]. A pilot flexes his legs and torso to keep blood from draining out of the head. This is known as the AGSM or the M1 or, sometimes, as the \"grunt\".{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n=== Defense against missiles ===\nMany early air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles had very simple [[infrared homing]] (\"heat seeking\") guidance systems with a narrow field of view. These missiles could be avoided by simply turning sharply, which essentially caused the missile to lose sight of the target aircraft. Another tactic was to exploit a missile's limited range by performing evasive maneuvers until the missiles had run out of fuel.\n\nModern infrared missiles, like the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]], have a more advanced guidance system. [[Supercooling|Supercooled]] [[infrared]] detectors help the missile find a possible exhaust source, and software assists the missile in flying towards its target. Pilots normally drop [[Flare (countermeasure)|flares]] to confuse or decoy these missiles by creating more multiple heat signatures hotter than that of the aircraft for the missile to lock onto and guide away from the defending aircraft.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Stephens |first1=Gus |title=The Difference Between Chaff & Flare in a Jet |url=https://ourpastimes.com/difference-between-chaff-flare-jet-8624626.html |website=Our Pastimes |language=en}}</ref>\n\nRadar homing missiles could sometimes be confused by surface objects or geographical features causing clutter for the guidance system of either the missile or ground station guiding it. Chaff is another option in the case that the aircraft is too high up to use geographical obstructions. Pilots have to be aware of the potential threats and learn to distinguish between the two where possible. They use the RWR (radar warning receiver) to discern the types of signals hitting their aircraft.\n\n=== G-force ===\n{{main article|g-force}}\nWhen maneuvering fiercely during engagements, pilots are subjected to high [[g-force]]. G-Forces express the magnitude of gravity, with 1G being equivalent to Earth's normal pull of gravity. Because modern jet aircraft are highly agile and have the capacity to make very sharp turns, the pilot's physical body is often pushed to the limit.\n\nWhen executing a \"positive G\" maneuver like turning upwards the force pushes the pilot down. The most serious consequence of this is that the blood in the pilot's body is also pulled down and into their extremities. If the forces are great enough and over a sufficient period of time this can lead to blackouts (called ''g-induced Loss Of Consciousness'' or [[G-LOC]]), because not enough blood is reaching the pilot's brain. To counteract this effect pilots are trained to tense their legs and abdominal muscles to restrict the \"downward\" flow of blood. This is known as the \"grunt\" or the \"Hick maneuver\", both names allude to the sounds the pilot makes, and is the primary method of resisting G-LOCs. Modern flight suits, called [[g-suit]]s, are worn by pilots to contract around the extremities exerting pressure, providing about 1G of extra tolerance.\n\n== Notable fighter pilots ==\n\nNotable fighter pilots include:\n*[[Gregory \"Pappy\" Boyington]]      {{Flag icon|USA}} Medal of Honor\n*[[Adolf Galland]]     {{Flag icon|Nazi Germany}}\n*[[Adolph Malan]] (Sailor Malan)     {{Flag icon| Union of South Africa}}\n*[[Adolphe P\u00e9goud]]    {{Flag icon|France}} (the first [[fighter ace]] in history during [[World War I]])\n*[[Alexander Pokryshkin]] {{Flag icon|USSR}} (The [[List of World War II flying aces|second top scoring Allied ace]] \u2013 Soviet Air Force)\n*[[Alexandru \u0218erb\u0103nescu]] {{Flag icon|Romania}}\n*[[Antonio Bautista]]      {{Flag icon|Philippines}}\n*[[Billy Bishop]]      {{Flag icon|Canada}}\n*[[Buzz Aldrin]]      {{Flag icon|USA}}\n*[[Charles Nungesser]]     {{Flag icon|France}}\n*[[Chuck Yeager]]      {{Flag icon|USA}}\n*[[Constantin Cantacuzino (aviator)|Constantin Cantacuzino]] {{Flag icon|Romania}}(Top Romanian ace)\n*[[Douglas Bader]]      {{Flag icon|United Kingdom}}\n*[[Erich Hartmann]] (highest scoring ace in the history of aerial warfare)     {{Flag icon|Nazi Germany}}\n*[[Ernst Udet]]     {{Flag icon|German Empire}}\n*[[Brendan Finucane]] (Irishman who flew for the Royal Air Force who became the youngest wing commander in RAF history.

Fighter pilots undergo specialized training in [[aerial warfare]] and [[dogfight]]ing (close range aerial combat). A fighter pilot with at least five air-to-air kills becomes known as an [[flying ace|ace]].\n\n== Recruitment ==\n\nFighter pilots are one of the most highly regarded and desirable positions of any air force. Selection processes only accept the elite out of all the potential candidates. An individual who possesses an exceptional academic record, physical fitness, healthy well-being, and a strong mental drive will have a higher chance of being selected for pilot training. Candidates are also expected to exhibit strong leadership and teamwork abilities. As such, in nearly all air forces, fighter pilots, as are pilots of most other aircraft, are [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned officers]].\n\n== Fitness ==\n[[File:F-15 Eagle female pilots, 3rd Wing.jpg|thumb|Female USAF fighter pilots heading to their jets before takeoff.]]\nFighter pilots must be in [[Optimal health range|optimal health]] to handle the physical demands of modern [[aerial warfare]]. Excellent heart condition is required, as the increased \"G's\" a pilot experiences in a turn can cause stress on the [[Cardiology|cardiovascular system]]. One \"G\" is equal to the force of gravity experienced under normal conditions, two \"G\"s would be twice the force of normal gravity.  Some fighter aircraft can accelerate to up to 9 G\u2019s. Fighter pilots also require strong muscle tissue along the extremities and abdomen, for performing an anti-G straining maneuver (AGSM, see below) when performing tight turns and other highly accelerated maneuvers. Better-than-average [[visual acuity]] is also a highly desirable and valuable trait.\n\n== Tactics ==\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|width=170\n|image1=\n|width1=\n|image2=\n|width2=\n| footer=<center>[[Air Force of Iran|Iranian pilots]] VS [[Air Force of Iraq|Iraqi pilots]] during [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]]</center>\n}}\n\n===Offensive===\nModern medium and long range [[active radar homing]] and [[semi-active radar homing]] missiles can be fired at targets outside or [[Beyond Visual Range missile|beyond visual range]]. However, when a pilot is [[dogfight]]ing at short-range, his position relative to the opponent is decidedly important. Outperformance of another pilot and that pilot's aircraft is critical to maintain the upper-hand. A common saying for [[dogfight]]ing is \"lose sight, lose fight\".\n\nIf one pilot had a greater missile range than the other, he would choose to fire his missile first, before being in range of the enemy's missile. Normally, the facts of an enemy's weapon payload is unknown, and are revealed as the fight progresses.\n\nSome air combat maneuvers form the basis for the sport of [[aerobatics]]:\n\n*Basic\n**[[Split S]]\n**[[Immelmann turn]]\n**[[Thach Weave]]\n**[[The Scissors]]\n**[[Chandelle]]\n*Complex\n**[[Pugachev's Cobra]]\n**[[Herbst maneuver]]\n\n=== Defensive ===\nPilots are trained to employ specific tactics and maneuvers when they are under attack. Attacks from missiles are usually countered with [[electronic countermeasure]]s, [[Flare (countermeasure)|Flares]] and [[chaff (countermeasure)|chaff]]. Missiles like the [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]], however, can actively home in on jamming signals.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nDogfighting at {{convert|1|to|4|mi|m}} is considered \"close\". Pilots perform stressful maneuvers to gain advantage in the dogfight. Pilots need to be in good shape in order to handle the high [[G-force]]s caused by [[Aerial warfare|aerial combat]]. A pilot flexes his legs and torso to keep blood from draining out of the head. This is known as the AGSM or the M1 or, sometimes, as the \"grunt\".{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n=== Defense against missiles ===\nMany early air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles had very simple [[infrared homing]] (\"heat seeking\") guidance systems with a narrow field of view. These missiles could be avoided by simply turning sharply, which essentially caused the missile to lose sight of the target aircraft. Another tactic was to exploit a missile's limited range by performing evasive maneuvers until the missiles had run out of fuel.\n\nModern infrared missiles, like the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]], have a more advanced guidance system. [[Supercooling|Supercooled]] [[infrared]] detectors help the missile find a possible exhaust source, and software assists the missile in flying towards its target. Pilots normally drop [[Flare (countermeasure)|flares]] to confuse or decoy these missiles by creating more multiple heat signatures hotter than that of the aircraft for the missile to lock onto and guide away from the defending aircraft.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Stephens |first1=Gus |title=The Difference Between Chaff & Flare in a Jet |url=https://ourpastimes.com/difference-between-chaff-flare-jet-8624626.html |website=Our Pastimes |language=en}}</ref>\n\nRadar homing missiles could sometimes be confused by surface objects or geographical features causing clutter for the guidance system of either the missile or ground station guiding it. Chaff is another option in the case that the aircraft is too high up to use geographical obstructions. Pilots have to be aware of the potential threats and learn to distinguish between the two where possible. They use the RWR (radar warning receiver) to discern the types of signals hitting their aircraft.\n\n=== G-force ===\n{{main article|g-force}}\nWhen maneuvering fiercely during engagements, pilots are subjected to high [[g-force]]. G-Forces express the magnitude of gravity, with 1G being equivalent to Earth's normal pull of gravity. Because modern jet aircraft are highly agile and have the capacity to make very sharp turns, the pilot's physical body is often pushed to the limit.\n\nWhen executing a \"positive G\" maneuver like turning upwards the force pushes the pilot down. The most serious consequence of this is that the blood in the pilot's body is also pulled down and into their extremities. If the forces are great enough and over a sufficient period of time this can lead to blackouts (called ''g-induced Loss Of Consciousness'' or [[G-LOC]]), because not enough blood is reaching the pilot's brain. To counteract this effect pilots are trained to tense their legs and abdominal muscles to restrict the \"downward\" flow of blood. This is known as the \"grunt\" or the \"Hick maneuver\", both names allude to the sounds the pilot makes, and is the primary method of resisting G-LOCs. Modern flight suits, called [[g-suit]]s, are worn by pilots to contract around the extremities exerting pressure, providing about 1G of extra tolerance.\n\n== Notable fighter pilots ==\n\nNotable fighter pilots include:\n*[[Gregory \"Pappy\" Boyington]]      {{Flag icon|USA}} Medal of Honor\n*[[Adolf Galland]]     {{Flag icon|Nazi Germany}}\n*[[Adolph Malan]] (Sailor Malan)     {{Flag icon| Union of South Africa}}\n*[[Adolphe P\u00e9goud]]    {{Flag icon|France}} (the first [[fighter ace]] in history during [[World War I]])\n*[[Alexander Pokryshkin]] {{Flag icon|USSR}} (The [[List of World War II flying aces|second top scoring Allied ace]] \u2013 Soviet Air Force)\n*[[Alexandru \u0218erb\u0103nescu]] {{Flag icon|Romania}}\n*[[Antonio Bautista]]      {{Flag icon|Philippines}}\n*[[Billy Bishop]]      {{Flag icon|Canada}}\n*[[Buzz Aldrin]]      {{Flag icon|USA}}\n*[[Charles Nungesser]]     {{Flag icon|France}}\n*[[Chuck Yeager]]      {{Flag icon|USA}}\n*[[Constantin Cantacuzino (aviator)|Constantin Cantacuzino]] {{Flag icon|Romania}}(Top Romanian ace)\n*[[Douglas Bader]]      {{Flag icon|United Kingdom}}\n*[[Erich Hartmann]] (highest scoring ace in the history of aerial warfare)     {{Flag icon|Nazi Germany}}\n*[[Ernst Udet]]     {{Flag icon|German Empire}}\n*[[Brendan Finucane]] (Irishman who flew for the Royal Air Force who became the youngest wing commander in RAF history.

He was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]], the highest decoration of the United States Armed Forces, for his actions in combat.\n\n==Biography==\n\nBaca was born on January 10, 1949 in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], and was raised in [[San Diego, California]]. Baca was drafted into the United States Army on June 10, 1968.\n\nBy February 10, 1970, he was stationed in [[South Vietnam]] as a [[Specialist (rank)|Specialist Four]] with Company D of the 1st Battalion, [[12th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|12th Cavalry Regiment]], [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]]. On that day, in [[Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Long Province]], during [[Operation Toan Thang IV]] he was serving on a [[recoilless rifle]] team when the lead [[platoon]] of his company was ambushed. Baca led his team forward through intense fire to reach the besieged platoon. When a [[fragmentation grenade]] was tossed into their midst, he \"unhesitatingly, and with complete disregard for his own safety,\" covered it with his helmet and then laid his body over the helmet, smothering the blast and saving eight fellow soldiers from severe injury or death.<ref name=\"citation\"/>\n\nBaca survived his wounds and was formally awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] by President [[Richard M. Nixon]] on March 2, 1971. Two other soldiers in Company D, [[Allen J. Lynch]] and [[Rodney J. Evans]], had previously earned the medal.\n\nIn 1990, Baca returned to Vietnam with seven other soldiers of the Veterans Vietnam Restoration Project. The group spent eight weeks working alongside former [[North Vietnamese Army]] soldiers building a health clinic in a village north of [[Hanoi]].\n\nBaca rarely speaks publicly about the events for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor. However, he prefers to recall an event that occurred on Christmas Day, 1969, when he was walking ahead of his unit, acting as \"[[Reconnaissance|point]],\" and surprised a young North Vietnamese soldier sitting alone on top of an enemy bunker in the jungle. He saw that the soldier could not reach his rifle quickly and, not wanting to shoot him, yelled in Vietnamese for him to surrender. Not only was he able to take his \"Christmas gift\" alive and unharmed, the young man, twenty years later, was among the Vietnamese that Baca worked with building the clinic in 1990.<ref name=ChristmasGift>{{Cite web|accessdate=2007-12-21\n|url=https://www.pbs.org/weta/americanvalor/teachers/lesson4.html \n|author=Israel, Michele\n|title=Lesson Four: The Negotiation of Emotion and Duty\n|work=American Valor\n|publisher=PBS\n}}</ref>\n\nBaca remains active in social causes, particularly related to Vietnam veterans issues and the plight of the [[homeless]].\n[[File:US Navy 111111-N-AC887-001 Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) the Honorable Ray Mabus welcomes Congressional Medal of Honor recipient John P.

Sp4c. Baca, Company D, distinguished himself while serving on a recoilless rifle team during a night ambush mission. A platoon from his company was sent to investigate the detonation of an automatic ambush device forward of his unit's main position and soon came under intense enemy fire from concealed positions along the trail. Hearing the heavy firing from the platoon position and realizing that his recoilless rifle team could assist the members of the besieged patrol, Sp4c. Baca led his team through the hail of enemy fire to a firing position within the patrol's defensive perimeter. As they prepared to engage the enemy, a fragmentation grenade was thrown into the midst of the patrol. Fully aware of the danger to his comrades, Sp4c.

He was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]], the highest decoration of the United States Armed Forces, for his actions in combat.\n\n==Biography==\n\nBaca was born on January 10, 1949 in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], and was raised in [[San Diego, California]]. Baca was drafted into the United States Army on June 10, 1968.\n\nBy February 10, 1970, he was stationed in [[South Vietnam]] as a [[Specialist (rank)|Specialist Four]] with Company D of the 1st Battalion, [[12th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|12th Cavalry Regiment]], [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]]. On that day, in [[Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Long Province]], during [[Operation Toan Thang IV]] he was serving on a [[recoilless rifle]] team when the lead [[platoon]] of his company was ambushed. Baca led his team forward through intense fire to reach the besieged platoon. When a [[fragmentation grenade]] was tossed into their midst, he \"unhesitatingly, and with complete disregard for his own safety,\" covered it with his helmet and then laid his body over the helmet, smothering the blast and saving eight fellow soldiers from severe injury or death.<ref name=\"citation\"/>\n\nBaca survived his wounds and was formally awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] by President [[Richard M. Nixon]] on March 2, 1971. Two other soldiers in Company D, [[Allen J. Lynch]] and [[Rodney J. Evans]], had previously earned the medal.\n\nIn 1990, Baca returned to Vietnam with seven other soldiers of the Veterans Vietnam Restoration Project. The group spent eight weeks working alongside former [[North Vietnamese Army]] soldiers building a health clinic in a village north of [[Hanoi]].\n\nBaca rarely speaks publicly about the events for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor. However, he prefers to recall an event that occurred on Christmas Day, 1969, when he was walking ahead of his unit, acting as \"[[Reconnaissance|point]],\" and surprised a young North Vietnamese soldier sitting alone on top of an enemy bunker in the jungle. He saw that the soldier could not reach his rifle quickly and, not wanting to shoot him, yelled in Vietnamese for him to surrender. Not only was he able to take his \"Christmas gift\" alive and unharmed, the young man, twenty years later, was among the Vietnamese that Baca worked with building the clinic in 1990.<ref name=ChristmasGift>{{Cite web|accessdate=2007-12-21\n|url=https://www.pbs.org/weta/americanvalor/teachers/lesson4.html \n|author=Israel, Michele\n|title=Lesson Four: The Negotiation of Emotion and Duty\n|work=American Valor\n|publisher=PBS\n}}</ref>\n\nBaca remains active in social causes, particularly related to Vietnam veterans issues and the plight of the [[homeless]].\n[[File:US Navy 111111-N-AC887-001 Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) the Honorable Ray Mabus welcomes Congressional Medal of Honor recipient John P.

Sp4c. Baca, Company D, distinguished himself while serving on a recoilless rifle team during a night ambush mission. A platoon from his company was sent to investigate the detonation of an automatic ambush device forward of his unit's main position and soon came under intense enemy fire from concealed positions along the trail. Hearing the heavy firing from the platoon position and realizing that his recoilless rifle team could assist the members of the besieged patrol, Sp4c. Baca led his team through the hail of enemy fire to a firing position within the patrol's defensive perimeter. As they prepared to engage the enemy, a fragmentation grenade was thrown into the midst of the patrol. Fully aware of the danger to his comrades, Sp4c. Baca unhesitatingly, and with complete disregard for his own safety, covered the grenade with his steel helmet and fell on it as the grenade exploded, thereby absorbing the lethal fragments and concussion with his body.
