{"title_page": "Mass (music)", "text_new": "{{short description|Form of sacred musical composition}}\n[[File:Barbireau illum.jpg|thumb|''Missa Virgo parens Christi'' by [[Jacobus Barbireau]]]]\nThe '''mass''' ({{lang-la|missa}}), a [[Musical form|form]] of [[sacred music|sacred musical composition]], is a [[choir|choral]] composition that sets the invariable portions of the [[Eucharist]]ic [[liturgy]] (principally that of the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Anglican Communion]], and [[Lutheranism]]) to music. Most masses are settings of [[Mass (liturgy)|the liturgy]] in Latin, the liturgical sacred language of the Catholic Church's Roman liturgy, but there are a significant number written in the languages of non-Catholic countries where vernacular worship has long been the norm. For example, there are many masses (often called \"communion services\") written in English for the [[Church of England]]. Musical masses take their name from the Catholic liturgy called [[Mass (liturgy)|\"the mass\"]] as well.\n\nMasses can be ''[[a cappella]]'', that is, without an independent [[accompaniment]], or they can be accompanied by instrumental ''[[obbligato]]s'' up to and including a full orchestra. Many masses, especially later ones, were never intended to be performed during the celebration of an actual mass.{{citation needed lead|date=January 2013}}\n\n==Form of the mass==\n{{see also|Order of Mass}}\nA distinction is made between texts that recur for every mass celebration ({{lang|la|[[#Ordinarium|ordinarium]]|italic=no}}, [[ordinary (liturgy)|ordinary]]), and texts that are sung depending on the occasion ({{lang|la|[[#Other sections|proprium]]|italic=no}}, [[proper (liturgy)|proper]]).<ref name=\"brit_Mass\"/> For example, for the [[Tridentine Mass]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Kyrie====\n{{See also|Kyrie#Musical settings}}\n[[File:Schola Gregoriana-Kyrie eleison.ogg|thumb|A Gregorian chant Kyrie eleison]]\nIn the [[Tridentine Mass]], the [[Kyrie]] is the first sung prayer of the [[mass ordinary]]. It is usually (but not always) part of any musical setting of the mass. Kyrie movements often have a [[ternary form|ternary]] (ABA) musical structure that reflects the symmetrical structure of the text. Musical settings exist in styles ranging from [[Gregorian chant]] to [[Folk music|Folk]].\n\n{{citation needed span|Of 226 catalogued [[Gregorian chant]] melodies, 30 appear in the ''[[Liber Usualis]]''.|date=April 2018}} In what are presumed to be the oldest versions, the same melody is repeated for the first eight iterations, and a variation used on the final line (that is, formally, aaa aaa aaa'). These [[repeat sign|repeats]] are notated by the [[Roman numeral]]s \"iij\" (for three times) or \"ij\" (for twice). The Kyrie for the [[Requiem Mass]] in the ''Liber Usualis'' has this form. Later Kyries have more elaborate patterns, such as aaa bbb aaa', aaa bbb ccc', or aba cdc efe'. Note that the final line is nearly always modified somewhat; in some cases this may be because it leads into the [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]] better. In forms both with and without literal repeats, most Kyries in the ''Liber Usualis'' have a closing phrase used in nearly all of the lines of the text. This in fact parallels the text, as each line ends with the same word \"eleison\".\n\nBecause of the brevity of the text, Kyries were often very [[melisma]]tic. This encouraged later composers to make [[Trope (music)|tropes]] out of them, either by adding words to the melisma (as how a [[sequence (poetry)|sequence]] is often considered), or extending the melisma. In fact, because of the late date of most Kyries, it is not always clear whether a particular Kyrie melody or the apparently troped text came first; it could just as easily be the case that a [[melisma|syllabic]] song was converted into a melisma for a Kyrie verse. In some cases, verses interpolate Latin text between each \"Kyrie\" (or \"Christe\") and \"eleison\".\n\n[[File:Kyrie XI (Orbis Factor) sample.ogg|thumb|The introductory words \u201cK\u00fdrie El\u00e9ison\u201d from the [[Kyriale]] Mass XI, Orbis Factor]]\nAs the Kyrie is the first item in settings of the mass ordinary and the second in the requiem mass (the only mass proper set regularly over the centuries), nearly all of the thousands of composers over the centuries who have set the ordinaries of the mass to music have included a Kyrie movement.\n\nKyrie movements often have a structure that reflects the concision and symmetry of the text. Many have a ternary (ABA) form known as a three-fold kyrie, where the two appearances of the phrase ''\"Kyrie eleison\"'' consist of identical or closely related material and frame a contrasting ''\"Christe eleison\"'' section. Or AAABBBCCC' form is also commonly used which is known as a nine-fold kyrie. Famously, [[Mozart]] sets the ''\"Kyrie\"'' and ''\"Christe\"'' texts in [[Requiem (Mozart)|his Requiem Mass]] as the two subjects of a [[double fugue]].\n\n====II. Gloria====\n{{See also|Gloria in excelsis Deo#Musical settings}}\nThe [[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloria]] is a celebratory passage praising God the Father and Christ.\n\nIn mass settings (normally in English) composed for the Church of England's ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' liturgy, the Gloria is commonly the last movement, because it occurs in this position in the text of the service. In Order One of the newer ''[[Common Worship]]'' liturgy, however, it is restored to its earlier place in the service.\n\n====III. Credo====\n{{See also|Credo#Musical settings}}\nThe [[Credo]], a setting of the [[Nicene Creed]], is the longest text of a sung mass.\n\nOrganizers of international celebrations, such as [[World Youth Day]], have been encouraged by Rome to familiarize congregants in the Latin chants for the Our Father and the Credo, specifically Credo III (17th century, Fifth Mode) from the ''[[Missa de Angelis]]''. The purpose of singing these two texts in Latin is to engender a sense of unity in the faithful, all of whom thus sing the prayer of Jesus and the shared belief of the universal Church in the same language.\n\n====IV. Sanctus and Benedictus====\n{{See also|Sanctus#Musical settings}}\nThe [[Sanctus]] is a [[doxology]] praising the [[Trinity]]. A variant exists in Lutheran settings of the Sanctus. While most hymnal settings keep the second person [[pronoun]], other settings change the second person pronoun to the third person. This is most notable in [[J.S. Bach]]'s [[Mass in B minor]], where the text reads ''gloria ejus'' (\"His glory\"). [[Martin Luther]]'s [[chorale]] ''Isaiah, Mighty in Days of Old'', and [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s setting of the ''Heilig!'' (German ''Sanctus'') from his ''Deutsche Liturgie'' also use the third person.\n\nThe Benedictus is a continuation of the Sanctus. ''Hosanna in excelsis'' is repeated after the ''Benedictus'' section, often with musical material identical to that used after the ''Sanctus'', or very closely related.\n\nIn Gregorian chant the ''Sanctus'' (with ''Benedictus'') was sung whole at its place in the mass. However, as composers produced more embellished settings of the ''Sanctus'' text, {{cn span|the music often would go on so long that it would run into the [[consecration]] of the bread and wine. This was considered the most important part of the Mass, so composers began to stop the ''Sanctus'' halfway through to allow this to happen, and then continue it after the consecration is finished. This practice was forbidden for a period in the 20th century.|date=April 2018}}\n\n====V. Agnus Dei====\n{{details|Agnus Dei (music)}}\nThe [[Agnus Dei (music)|Agnus Dei]] is a setting of the \"[[Lamb of God]]\" litany, containing the responses ''miserere nobis'' (have mercy upon us), repeated twice, and ''dona nobis pacem'' (grant us peace) once at the end.\n\nIn a [[Requiem Mass]], the words ''\"miserere nobis\"'' are replaced by ''\"dona eis requiem\"'' (grant them rest), while ''\"dona nobis pacem\"'' is replaced by ''\"dona eis requiem sempiternam\"'' (grant them eternal rest).\n\n===Short and solemn masses===\nThere is some additional terminology regarding mass settings indicating whether or not they include all five usual sections of the ordinarium, and whether or not the mass is intended for exceptionally festive occasions.\n\n====Missa brevis====\n{{Main|Missa brevis}}\n[[Missa brevis]] (literally: short mass) may, depending on time and conventions, indicate the setting of a subset of the five ordinary mass parts (e.g. masses containing only a setting of the Kyrie and the Gloria), or a mass containing all these parts, but relatively short in duration, or a mass in a setting that is less extended in vocal and orchestral forces than that of a [[Neapolitan mass]].\n\nMissa longa (\"long mass\") can indicate the counterpart of missa brevis when the aspect of ''duration'' is considered.\n\n====Missa solemnis====\n{{Main|Missa solemnis}}\n[[Missa solemnis]] indicates a solemn mass, usually for special festive occasions and with an extended vocal and orchestral setting. In that sense Missa brevis is sometimes used to indicate the counterpart of a Missa solemnis.\n\n====Missa brevis et solemnis====\nThe Missa brevis et solemnis (short ''and'' solemn) is an exceptional format, for its best known instances tied to the [[Salzburg]] of archbishop [[Hieronymus Colloredo]], although earlier examples are extant. [[Mozart]] described it thus in a letter he wrote in 1776 (\"the Archbishop\" in this quotation refers to Colloredo):<ref name=EisenKeefe>{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Mozart Encyclopedia|editor1-first=Cliff|editor1-last=Eisen|editor1-link=Cliff Eisen|editor2-first=Simon|editor2-last=Keefe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8o6mVjlSzM4C&dq|date=2006|pages=271\u2013274\n|isbn=9781139448789}}</ref><ref name=\"Senn\">Walter Senn, [[Neue Mozart-Ausgabe|NMA]] Series I: Geistliche Gesangwerke, Group I (Masses and Requiem), [http://dme.mozarteum.at/DME/nma/nma_cont.php?vsep=3&gen=&l=1&p1=-25 Division I: ''Masses'', Volume 2, Preface, pp. VIII-IX] 1975.</ref>{{quotation|Our church music is very different from that of Italy, since a Mass with the whole Kyrie, the Gloria, the Credo, the Epistle sonata, the Offertory or motet, the Sanctus and the Agnus Dei must not last longer than three quarters of an hour. This applies even to the most Solemn Mass spoken by the Archbishop himself. Special study is required for this kind of composition, particularly as the Mass must have a full contingent of instruments\u2014trumpets, drums and so forth.}}\n\nThe \"brevis et solemnis\" description applies to several of the [[list of masses by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Masses Mozart composed]] in Salzburg between 1775 and 1780, the ''[[Sparrow Mass]]'' being considered as its first instance for this composer.<ref name=EisenKeefe /><ref name=\"Senn\" />\n\nTongue-in-cheek, and not indebted to Viennese traditions, [[Gioachino Rossini]] qualified one of his last compositions, a [[petite messe solennelle|mass, as both \"petite\" (\"small\") and \"solennelle\" (\"solemn\")]]. In this case \"small\" rather refers to the modest forces needed for its performance, and \"solemn\" to its duration, although later commentators would describe the composition as \"neither small nor solemn\".<ref>[http://www.lepetitjournal.net/011016-148853-La-Petite-Messe-Solennelle-de-Rossini.html_887 La Petite Messe Solennelle de Rossini\u2026] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504014329/http://www.lepetitjournal.net/011016-148853-La-Petite-Messe-Solennelle-de-Rossini.html_887 |date=2015-05-04 }} in ''Le petit journal'', 10 April 2014</ref>\n\n====Other types of masses with fewer than five of the usual parts of the ordinarium====\nDuring [[Lent]] (in Latin: {{lang|la|Quadragesima|italic=no}}) and [[Advent]] (in Latin: {{lang|la|Adventus|italic=no}}) the Gloria is not sung. Thus {{lang|la|Missa (in) tempore (Adventus et) Quadragesimae|italic=no}}, \"Mass for the period of (Advent and) Lent\" indicates a mass composition without music for the Gloria. [[Michael Haydn]] composed a mass suitable for Lent and Advent, the ''[[Missa tempore Quadragesimae (Michael Haydn)|Missa tempore Quadragesimae]]'', in {{nowrap|D minor}} for the modest forces of choir and organ.\n\nMissa senza credo (\"mass without a Credo\") indicates a musical setting of the usual parts of the mass ordinary with exception of the Credo.\n\nA {{lang|la|missa ferialis}} (weekday mass) leaves out both the Gloria and the Credo.\n\n===Other sections===\nThe sixth and last part of the Ordinarium (either [[Ite, missa est]], or, in masses without Gloria, [[Benedicamus Domino]]) is usually not set as part of a mass composition. In a Tridentine Mass that part of the Ordinarium is usually spoken, or sung to the Gregorian melody provided in the Roman Missal, although early polyphonic settings for the \"Deo gratias\" response (e.g. in [[Guillaume de Machaut]]'s ''[[Messe de Nostre Dame]]'') and for the Benedicamus Domino (e.g. in ''[[Magnus Liber Organi]]'') are extant.\n\nThe Proper of the mass is usually not set to music in a mass itself, except in the case of a [[Music for the Requiem Mass|Requiem Mass]], but may be the subject of [[motet]]s or other musical compositions. Some mass compositions, like for instance [[Rossini]]'s ''[[Petite messe solennelle]]'', do however contain parts outside the Ordinarium. Some mass compositions even consist entirely of such additions: [[Schubert]]'s ''[[Deutsche Messe (Schubert)|Deutsche Messe]]'', a set of eight hymns with epilogue,<ref>[[Brian Newbould]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-Faikq3F8VYC&pg=PA285&dq=%22set+of+eight+hymns+with+epilogue%22&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=ogl6VMqkNYztaPzlgegF&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22set%20of%20eight%20hymns%20with%20epilogue%22&f=false ''Schubert: The Music and the Man'', pp. 284-285.] University of California Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0520219570}} {{ISBN|9780520219571}}</ref> is an example of such a mass.\n\nAlso purely instrumental compositions can be part of a mass celebration, e.g. a [[Sonata da chiesa]], sometimes with a liturgical function, like [[Church Sonatas (Mozart)|Mozart's Epistle Sonatas]].\n\n====Proprium (Tridentine Mass)====\nIn a liturgical mass, there are other sections that may be sung, often in [[Gregorian chant]]. These sections, the \"Proper\" of the mass, change with the day and season according to the Church calendar, or according to the special circumstances of the mass. The sections of the Proper of the mass include the Introit, Gradual, Alleluia or Tract (depending on the time of year), Offertory and Communion.\n\nOrdinarium and proprium sections of a specific liturgical mass are not typically set to music together in the same composition. The one major exception to this rule is the mass for the dead, or [[requiem (music)|requiem]].\n\n====Other denominations====\nFollowing the distribution of the Sacrament, it is customary in most Lutheran churches to sing the [[Nunc dimittis]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Musical settings==\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\nThe earliest musical settings of the mass are [[Gregorian chant]]. The different portions of the Ordinary came into the liturgy at different times, with the Kyrie probably being first (perhaps as early as the 7th century) and the Credo being last (it did not become part of the Roman mass until 1014).<ref>Harvard Dictionary of Music, p. 472.</ref>\n\nIn the early 14th century, composers began writing polyphonic versions of the sections of the Ordinary. The reason for this surge in interest is not known, but it has been suggested that there was a shortage of new music since composers were increasingly attracted to secular music, and overall interest in writing sacred music had entered a period of decline.<ref>Lockwood, \"Mass\", Grove (1980).</ref>  The non-changing part of the mass, the Ordinary, then would have music which was available for performance all the time.\n\nTwo manuscripts from the 14th century, the [[Ivrea Codex]] and the [[Apt Codex]], are the primary sources for polyphonic settings of the Ordinary. Stylistically these settings are similar to both [[motet]]s and secular music of the time, with a three-voice texture dominated by the highest part. Most of this music was written or assembled at the papal court at [[Avignon]].\n\nSeveral [[Anonymous work|anonymous]] complete masses from the 14th century survive, including the [[Tournai Mass]]; however, discrepancies in style indicate that the movements of these masses were written by several composers and later compiled by scribes into a single set. The first complete mass we know of whose composer can be identified was the ''[[Messe de Nostre Dame]]'' (''Mass of Our Lady'') by [[Guillaume de Machaut]] in the 14th century.\n\n===Renaissance===\n{{Main articles|Cyclic mass|Paraphrase mass|Parody mass}}\n{{1500smusic|expanded=liturgies}}\n\nThe musical setting of the Ordinary of the mass was the principal large-scale form of the Renaissance. The earliest complete settings date from the 14th century, with the most famous example being the [[Messe de Nostre Dame]] of [[Guillaume de Machaut]]. Individual movements of the mass, and especially pairs of movements (such as Gloria-Credo pairs, or Sanctus-Agnus pairs), were commonly composed during the 14th and early 15th centuries. Complete masses by a single composer were the norm by the middle of the 15th century, and the form of the mass, with the possibilities for large-scale structure inherent in its multiple movement format, was the main focus of composers within the area of sacred music; it was not to be eclipsed until the motet and related forms became more popular in the first decades of the 16th century.\n\nMost 15th-century masses were based on a [[cantus firmus]], usually from a Gregorian chant, and most commonly put in the tenor voice. The cantus firmus sometimes appeared simultaneously in other voices, using a variety of [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] techniques. Later in the century, composers such as [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Johannes Ockeghem]], and [[Jacob Obrecht]], used secular tunes for cantus firmi. This practice was accepted with little controversy until prohibited by the [[Council of Trent]] in 1562. In particular, the song ''[[L'homme arm\u00e9]]'' has a long history with composers; more than 40 separate mass settings exist.\n\nOther techniques for organizing the [[cyclic mass]] evolved by the beginning of the 16th century, including the [[paraphrase mass|paraphrase]] technique, in which the cantus firmus was elaborated and ornamented, and the [[Parody mass|parody]] technique, in which several voices of a polyphonic source, not just one, were incorporated into the texture of the mass. Paraphrase and parody supplanted cantus-firmus as the techniques of choice in the 16th century: [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]] alone wrote 51 parody masses.\n\nYet another technique used to organize the multiple movements of a mass was [[canon (music)|canon]]. The earliest masses based entirely on canon are Johannes Ockeghem's ''[[Missa prolationum]]'', in which each movement is a [[prolation canon]] on a freely-composed tune, and the ''[[Missa L'homme arm\u00e9 (Faugues)|Missa L'homme arm\u00e9]]'' of [[Guillaume Faugues]], which is also entirely canonic but also uses the famous tune ''L'homme arm\u00e9'' throughout.  [[Pierre de La Rue]] wrote four separate canonic masses based on plainchant, and one of [[Josquin des Prez]]'s mature masses, the ''[[Missa Ad fugam]]'', is entirely canonic and free of borrowed material.<ref>Bloxham, p. 196</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Missa sine nomine]]'', literally \"Mass without a name\", refers to a mass written on freely composed material. Sometimes these masses were named for other things, such as Palestrina's famous ''[[Missa Papae Marcelli]]'', the Mass of Pope Marcellus, and many times they were canonic masses, as in [[Missa sine nomine (Josquin)|Josquin's ''Missa sine nomine'']].\n\nMany famous and influential masses were composed by [[Josquin des Prez]], the single most influential composer of the middle Renaissance. At the end of the 16th century, prominent representatives of ''a cappella'' choral [[counterpoint]] included the Englishman [[William Byrd]], the Castilian [[Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria]] and the Roman [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], whose ''Mass for Pope Marcellus'' is sometimes credited with saving [[polyphony]] from the censure of the Council of Trent. By the time of Palestrina, however, most composers outside of Rome were using other forms for their primary creative outlet for expression in the realm of sacred music, principally the [[motet]] and the [[madrigale spirituale]]; composers such as the members of the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian School]] preferred the possibilities inherent in the new forms. Other composers, such as [[Orlande de Lassus]], working in Munich and comfortably distant from the conservative influence of the [[Council of Trent]], continued to write [[parody mass]]es on secular songs. Monteverdi composed masses in [[Prima pratica|stile antico]], the ''[[Missa in illo tempore]]'' was published in 1610, one ''[[Messa a 4 da cappella]]'' in 1641 as part of ''[[Selva morale e spirituale]]'' along with single movements of the mass in [[stile concertato]], another ''[[Messa a 4 da cappella (1650)|Messa a 4 da cappella]]'' was published after his death, in 1650.\n\n===Baroque to Romantic (Catholic and Lutheran traditions)===\nThe early Baroque era initiated stylistic changes which led to increasing disparity between masses written entirely in the traditional polyphonic manner (stile antico), whose principal advancements were the use of the basso continuo and the gradual adoption of a wider harmonic vocabulary, and the mass in modern style with solo voices and instrumental obbligatos. The Lutheran [[Michael Praetorius]] composed a mass for double choir in the old style, which he published in 1611 in the collection of church music for the mass in Latin, ''[[Missodia Sionia]]''. Composers such as [[Henri Dumont]] (1610\u20131684) continued to compose plainsong settings, distinct from and more elaborate than the earlier Gregorian chants.<ref name=Wye>[http://sscm-jscm.press.illinois.edu/v5/no1/vanwye.html Benjamin van Wye, Review of Marc-Antoine Charpentier, ''Messe pour le Port-Royal'', in  ''Journal of Seventeenth-Century Music'' 1999] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719211643/http://sscm-jscm.press.illinois.edu/v5/no1/vanwye.html |date=2011-07-19 }}</ref>\n\nA further disparity arose between the festive [[missa solemnis]] and the [[missa brevis]], a more compact setting. Composers like [[Johann Joseph Fux]] in the 18th century continued to cultivate the stile antico mass, which was suitable for use on weekdays and at times when orchestral masses were not practical or appropriate, and in 19th-century Germany the [[Cecilian movement]] kept the tradition alive. [[Franti\u0161ek Brixi]], who worked at the [[Prague Cathedral]], wrote his ''[[Missa aulica]]'', a Missa brevis in C, for four voices, trumpets, violin and continuo, \"cantabile\" but solo voices just singing short passages within chorale movements. The Italian style cultivated orchestral masses including soloists, chorus and obbligato instruments. It spread to the German-speaking Catholic countries north of the Alps, using instruments for color and creating dialogues between solo voices and chorus that was to become characteristic of the 18th-century Viennese style. The so-called \"Neapolitan\" or \"cantata\" mass style also had much influence on 18th-century mass composition with its short sections set as self-contained solo arias and choruses in a variety of styles.<ref name=RocheLingas>Roche, Elizabeth and Alex Lingas. \"Mass\". ''The Oxford Companion to Music''. Ed. Alison Latham. Oxford Music Online.</ref>\n\nThe 18th-century Viennese mass combines operatic elements from the cantata mass with a trend in the symphony and concerto to organize choral movements. The large scale masses of the first half of the century still have Glorias and Credos divided into many movements, unlike smaller masses for ordinary churches. Many of Mozart's masses are in missa brevis form, as are some of Haydn's early ones. Later masses, especially of Haydn, are of symphonic structure, with long sections divided into fewer movements, organized like a symphony, with soloists used as an ensemble rather than as individuals. The distinction between concert masses and those intended for liturgical use also came into play as the 19th century progressed.<ref name=RocheLingas/>\n\n====Major works====\nAfter the Renaissance, the mass tended not to be the central genre for any one composer, yet among the most famous works of the Baroque, Classical, and Romantic periods are settings of the [[Ordinary of the Mass]]. Many of the famous masses of the Romantic era were [[Requiem]]s, one of the most famous, [[A German Requiem (Brahms)|''A German Requiem'']] by [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], being the composer's own selection of biblical texts rather than a setting of a standard liturgy.\n\nAmong the masses written in these eras are:\n* ''Messa Concertata'' by [[Francesco Cavalli|Cavalli]] (1656)\n* Mass for double choir, from ''[[Missodia Sionia]]'', by Michael Praetorius (1611)\n* ''Missa assumpta est Maria : Missa sex vocibus cum simphonia'' H 11 & H 11 a (1699 ?) by [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier]], and 11 others masses, H 1, H 2 ''(pour les tr\u00e9pass\u00e9s''), H 3, H 4 (''for 4 Chorus''), H 5, H 6, H 7, H 8, H9, H 10, H 513.\n* ''Missa Scala Aretina'' by [[Francesc Valls]] (Barcelona, 1702)\n* [[Mass in B minor]] and four [[Missa (Bach)|Missae]] by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S.

The revival of choral celebration of Holy Communion in the Anglican Church in the late 19th century marked the beginning several liturgical settings of mass texts in English, particularly for choir and organ.<ref name=Grove_McKinnon>McKinnon, James W. et al. \u201cMass\u201d. Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online.</ref> The movement for liturgical reform has resulted in revised forms of the mass, making it more functional by using a variety of accessible styles, popular or ethnic, and using new methods such as refrain and response to encourage congregational involvement.<ref name=Grove_McKinnon/> Nevertheless, the mass in its musical incarnation continues to thrive beyond the walls of the church, as is evident in many of the 21st-century masses listed here which were composed for concert performance rather than in service of the Roman Rite.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n====Musical reforms of Pius X====\nPope [[Pius X]] initiated many regulations reforming the liturgical music of the mass in the early 20th century. He felt that some of the masses composed by the famous post-Renaissance composers were too long and often more appropriate for a theatrical rather than a church setting. He advocated primarily Gregorian plainchant and polyphony. He was primarily influenced by the work of the [[Abbey of Solesmes]]. Some of the rules he put forth include the following:\n* That any mass be composed in an integrated fashion, not by assembling different compositions for different parts.\n* That all percussive instruments should be forbidden.\n* That the piano be explicitly forbidden.\n* That the centuries' old practice of ''alternatim'' between choir and organ be concluded immediately.\n* That ideally the choir should be all male.\n* That the congregation itself should ideally be trained to sing the various modes of Gregorian chant along with the choir.\n\nThese regulations carry little if any weight today, especially after the changes of the [[Second Vatican Council]]. Quite recently, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] has encouraged a return to chant as the primary music of the liturgy, as this is explicitly mentioned in the documents of the [[Second Vatican Council]], specifically Sacrosanctum Concilium 116.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19631204_sacrosanctum-concilium_en.html#116 Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy Sacrosanctum Concilium<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n====Major works====\n=====20th century=====\n\nIn the 20th century, composers continued to write masses, in an even wider diversity of style, form and function than before.\n\n* Requiem Mass by [[Herbert Howells]]\n* [[Requiem (Durufl\u00e9)|Requiem]] by [[Maurice Durufl\u00e9]]\n* [[Mass (Poulenc)|Mass]] in G by [[Francis Poulenc]]\n* Messe Solennelle by [[Jean Langlais]]\n* [[Glagolitic Mass]] (1926) by [[Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek]]\n* [[Mass in G minor (Vaughan Williams)|Mass in G minor]] by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]\n* [[Mass, Op. 130]] for choir and brass by [[Joseph Jongen]] (1945)\n* [[Requiem]] by [[Bruno Maderna]] (1946)\n* [[Mass (Stravinsky)|Mass]] by [[Igor Stravinsky]]\n* [[Mass (Bernstein)|Mass]] by [[Leonard Bernstein]]<ref name=\"brit_Mass\"/>\n* [[War Requiem]] by [[Benjamin Britten]]\n* Mass for mixed chorus (1963) by [[Paul Hindemith]]\n* Requiem, for soprano and mezzo-soprano solo, mixed chorus and orchestra (1963\u201365) by [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti]]\n* [[Requiem (Lloyd Webber)|Requiem]] by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]\n* [[Mass in F Minor]] by [[The Electric Prunes]]\n* [[Mass (Maslansky)|Mass]] by [[David Maslanka]]\n* [[Berliner Messe]] and [[Missa Syllabica]] by [[Arvo P\u00e4rt]]\n* Mass by [[Frank Martin (composer)|Frank Martin]]\n* A Symphonic Mass by [[George Lloyd (composer)|George Lloyd]]\n* Missa Laudate Pueri by [[Bertold Hummel]]<ref>http://www.bertoldhummel.de/english/commentaries/opus_98B.html</ref>\n* [[Mass of the Children]], [[Requiem (Rutter)|Requiem]], and [[Gloria (Rutter)|Gloria]] by [[John Rutter]]\n* [[Mass To Hope]] by [[Dave Brubeck]]\n* Misa Criolla by [[Ariel Ram\u00edrez]]\n* Misa by [[Rodrigo Prats]]\n* [[New Plainsong Mass]] by [[David Hurd]]\n* Mass in Honor of St. Cecilia by [[Lou Harrison]]\n* [[African Sanctus]] by [[David Fanshawe]]\n* [[Polish Requiem]] by [[Krzysztof Penderecki]]\n*[[Missa Luba]] by Guido Haazen\n* Missa supra Parsifal (1985) by Dimitri Aguero <ref>http://www.spectable.com/concert-chorale-le-bon-temperament/327442/359962</ref>\n*B\u1ed9 l\u1ec5 Seraphim (1960) by [[Paul Nguy\u00ean Van H\u00f2a|Paul Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Ho\u00e0]]\n\n=====21st century=====\n* [[Missa Latina]]: pro Pace by [[Roberto Sierra]]\n* [[Missa pro Pace]] (Mass for Peace) by [[Kentaro Sato (composer)|Kentaro Sato]]\n* [[The Armed Man]]: A Mass for Peace by [[Karl Jenkins]]\n* Son of God Mass by [[James Whitbourn]]\n* Missa Carolae (Mass from Christmas Carols) by [[James Whitbourn]]\n* Bright Mass with Canons by [[Nico Muhly]]\n* Misa Flamenca by [[Paco Pe\u00f1a]]\n* Mass (2000) by [[James MacMillan]]\n* Misa de San Isidro (2001) by [[Dieter Lehnhoff]]\n* Requiem (2001\u20132002) by [[Christopher Rouse (composer)|Christopher Rouse]]\n* Missa Brevis by [[Douglas Knehans]]\n* Missa Gongso, for choir and gamelan, by [[Neil Sorrell]]\n* [[Missa Concertante]] (2008) by [[Marcus Paus]]\n* Messe br\u00e8ve: \"Acclamez le Seigneur!\", in French for choir and organ ( 2011) by Jean Huot;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diosher.org/file/Ens_AVRIL.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214003222/http://www.diosher.org/file/Ens_AVRIL.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-14 }}</ref>\n* [[Street Requiem]] (for those who have died on the street) for choir and orchestra by [[Kathleen McGuire]], [[Jonathon Welch]] and Andy Payne (2014) <ref>https://streetrequiem.teamapp.com</ref> \n* Messe de la Mis\u00e9ricorde divine, in French for choir and organ (2015) by Jean Huot;<ref>http://www.diosher.org/file/pdf/ensemble/Web_Ensemble_Vol_46_no_1_janv._2015{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n* Missa Papae Francisci (2015) by [[Ennio Morricone]] <ref>http://www.rai5.rai.it/articoli/missa-papae-francisci-morricone/30466/default.aspx</ref>\n* Mass of Innocence and Experience for SATB and organ (2006) by [[Stephen Hough]]\n* Missa Mirablis SATB and organ or orchestra (2007) by [[Stephen Hough]]\n\n===Masses written for the Anglican liturgy===\nThese are more often known as 'Communion Services', and differ not only in that they are settings of English words,<ref name=\"brit_Mass\">{{Cite web | title = Mass: Music | work = Encyclopedia Britannica | date = 11 October 2007 | accessdate = 20 April 2018 | url = https://www.britannica.com/art/mass-music }}</ref> but also, as mentioned above, in that the Gloria usually forms the last movement. Sometimes the Kyrie movement takes the form of sung responses to the Ten Commandments, 1 to 9 being followed by the words 'Lord have mercy upon us and incline our hearts to keep this law', and the tenth by 'Lord have mercy upon us and write all these thy laws in our hearts, we beseech thee'. Since the texts of the 'Benedictus qui venit' and the 'Agnus Dei' do not actually feature in the liturgy of the 1662 [[Book of Common Prayer]], these movements are often missing from some of the earlier Anglican settings. [[Charles Villiers Stanford]] composed a Benedictus and Agnus in the key of F major which was published separately to complete his service in C.\n\nWith reforms in the Anglican liturgy, the movements are now usually sung in the same order that they are in the Roman Catholic rite.

Musical settings exist in styles ranging from [[Gregorian chant]] to [[Folk music|Folk]].\n\n{{citation needed span|Of 226 catalogued [[Gregorian chant]] melodies, 30 appear in the ''[[Liber Usualis]]''.|date=April 2018}} In what are presumed to be the oldest versions, the same melody is repeated for the first eight iterations, and a variation used on the final line (that is, formally, aaa aaa aaa'). These [[repeat sign|repeats]] are notated by the [[Roman numeral]]s \"iij\" (for three times) or \"ij\" (for twice). The Kyrie for the [[Requiem Mass]] in the ''Liber Usualis'' has this form. Later Kyries have more elaborate patterns, such as aaa bbb aaa', aaa bbb ccc', or aba cdc efe'. Note that the final line is nearly always modified somewhat; in some cases this may be because it leads into the [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]] better. In forms both with and without literal repeats, most Kyries in the ''Liber Usualis'' have a closing phrase used in nearly all of the lines of the text. This in fact parallels the text, as each line ends with the same word \"eleison\".\n\nBecause of the brevity of the text, Kyries were often very [[melisma]]tic. This encouraged later composers to make [[Trope (music)|tropes]] out of them, either by adding words to the melisma (as how a [[sequence (poetry)|sequence]] is often considered), or extending the melisma. In fact, because of the late date of most Kyries, it is not always clear whether a particular Kyrie melody or the apparently troped text came first; it could just as easily be the case that a [[melisma|syllabic]] song was converted into a melisma for a Kyrie verse. In some cases, verses interpolate Latin text between each \"Kyrie\" (or \"Christe\") and \"eleison\".\n\n[[File:Kyrie XI (Orbis Factor) sample.ogg|thumb|The introductory words \u201cK\u00fdrie El\u00e9ison\u201d from the [[Kyriale]] Mass XI, Orbis Factor]]\nAs the Kyrie is the first item in settings of the mass ordinary and the second in the requiem mass (the only mass proper set regularly over the centuries), nearly all of the thousands of composers over the centuries who have set the ordinaries of the mass to music have included a Kyrie movement.\n\nKyrie movements often have a structure that reflects the concision and symmetry of the text. Many have a ternary (ABA) form known as a three-fold kyrie, where the two appearances of the phrase ''\"Kyrie eleison\"'' consist of identical or closely related material and frame a contrasting ''\"Christe eleison\"'' section. Or AAABBBCCC' form is also commonly used which is known as a nine-fold kyrie. Famously, [[Mozart]] sets the ''\"Kyrie\"'' and ''\"Christe\"'' texts in [[Requiem (Mozart)|his Requiem Mass]] as the two subjects of a [[double fugue]].\n\n====II. Gloria====\n{{See also|Gloria in excelsis Deo#Musical settings}}\nThe [[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloria]] is a celebratory passage praising God the Father and Christ.\n\nIn mass settings (normally in English) composed for the Church of England's ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' liturgy, the Gloria is commonly the last movement, because it occurs in this position in the text of the service. In Order One of the newer ''[[Common Worship]]'' liturgy, however, it is restored to its earlier place in the service.\n\n====III. Credo====\n{{See also|Credo#Musical settings}}\nThe [[Credo]], a setting of the [[Nicene Creed]], is the longest text of a sung mass.\n\nOrganizers of international celebrations, such as [[World Youth Day]], have been encouraged by Rome to familiarize congregants in the Latin chants for the Our Father and the Credo, specifically Credo III (17th century, Fifth Mode) from the ''[[Missa de Angelis]]''. The purpose of singing these two texts in Latin is to engender a sense of unity in the faithful, all of whom thus sing the prayer of Jesus and the shared belief of the universal Church in the same language.\n\n====IV. Sanctus and Benedictus====\n{{See also|Sanctus#Musical settings}}\nThe [[Sanctus]] is a [[doxology]] praising the [[Trinity]]. A variant exists in Lutheran settings of the Sanctus. While most hymnal settings keep the second person [[pronoun]], other settings change the second person pronoun to the third person. This is most notable in [[J.S. Bach]]'s [[Mass in B minor]], where the text reads ''gloria ejus'' (\"His glory\"). [[Martin Luther]]'s [[chorale]] ''Isaiah, Mighty in Days of Old'', and [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s setting of the ''Heilig!'' (German ''Sanctus'') from his ''Deutsche Liturgie'' also use the third person.\n\nThe Benedictus is a continuation of the Sanctus. ''Hosanna in excelsis'' is repeated after the ''Benedictus'' section, often with musical material identical to that used after the ''Sanctus'', or very closely related.\n\nIn Gregorian chant the ''Sanctus'' (with ''Benedictus'') was sung whole at its place in the mass. However, as composers produced more embellished settings of the ''Sanctus'' text, {{cn span|the music often would go on so long that it would run into the [[consecration]] of the bread and wine. This was considered the most important part of the Mass, so composers began to stop the ''Sanctus'' halfway through to allow this to happen, and then continue it after the consecration is finished. This practice was forbidden for a period in the 20th century.|date=April 2018}}\n\n====V. Agnus Dei====\n{{details|Agnus Dei (music)}}\nThe [[Agnus Dei (music)|Agnus Dei]] is a setting of the \"[[Lamb of God]]\" litany, containing the responses ''miserere nobis'' (have mercy upon us), repeated twice, and ''dona nobis pacem'' (grant us peace) once at the end.\n\nIn a [[Requiem Mass]], the words ''\"miserere nobis\"'' are replaced by ''\"dona eis requiem\"'' (grant them rest), while ''\"dona nobis pacem\"'' is replaced by ''\"dona eis requiem sempiternam\"'' (grant them eternal rest).\n\n===Short and solemn masses===\nThere is some additional terminology regarding mass settings indicating whether or not they include all five usual sections of the ordinarium, and whether or not the mass is intended for exceptionally festive occasions.\n\n====Missa brevis====\n{{Main|Missa brevis}}\n[[Missa brevis]] (literally: short mass) may, depending on time and conventions, indicate the setting of a subset of the five ordinary mass parts (e.g. masses containing only a setting of the Kyrie and the Gloria), or a mass containing all these parts, but relatively short in duration, or a mass in a setting that is less extended in vocal and orchestral forces than that of a [[Neapolitan mass]].\n\nMissa longa (\"long mass\") can indicate the counterpart of missa brevis when the aspect of ''duration'' is considered.\n\n====Missa solemnis====\n{{Main|Missa solemnis}}\n[[Missa solemnis]] indicates a solemn mass, usually for special festive occasions and with an extended vocal and orchestral setting. In that sense Missa brevis is sometimes used to indicate the counterpart of a Missa solemnis.\n\n====Missa brevis et solemnis====\nThe Missa brevis et solemnis (short ''and'' solemn) is an exceptional format, for its best known instances tied to the [[Salzburg]] of archbishop [[Hieronymus Colloredo]], although earlier examples are extant. [[Mozart]] described it thus in a letter he wrote in 1776 (\"the Archbishop\" in this quotation refers to Colloredo):<ref name=EisenKeefe>{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Mozart Encyclopedia|editor1-first=Cliff|editor1-last=Eisen|editor1-link=Cliff Eisen|editor2-first=Simon|editor2-last=Keefe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8o6mVjlSzM4C&dq|date=2006|pages=271\u2013274\n|isbn=9781139448789}}</ref><ref name=\"Senn\">Walter Senn, [[Neue Mozart-Ausgabe|NMA]] Series I: Geistliche Gesangwerke, Group I (Masses and Requiem), [http://dme.mozarteum.at/DME/nma/nma_cont.php?vsep=3&gen=&l=1&p1=-25 Division I: ''Masses'', Volume 2, Preface, pp. VIII-IX] 1975.</ref>{{quotation|Our church music is very different from that of Italy, since a Mass with the whole Kyrie, the Gloria, the Credo, the Epistle sonata, the Offertory or motet, the Sanctus and the Agnus Dei must not last longer than three quarters of an hour.

Thus {{lang|la|Missa (in) tempore (Adventus et) Quadragesimae|italic=no}}, \"Mass for the period of (Advent and) Lent\" indicates a mass composition without music for the Gloria. [[Michael Haydn]] composed a mass suitable for Lent and Advent, the ''[[Missa tempore Quadragesimae (Michael Haydn)|Missa tempore Quadragesimae]]'', in {{nowrap|D minor}} for the modest forces of choir and organ.\n\nMissa senza credo (\"mass without a Credo\") indicates a musical setting of the usual parts of the mass ordinary with exception of the Credo.\n\nA {{lang|la|missa ferialis}} (weekday mass) leaves out both the Gloria and the Credo.\n\n===Other sections===\nThe sixth and last part of the Ordinarium (either [[Ite, missa est]], or, in masses without Gloria, [[Benedicamus Domino]]) is usually not set as part of a mass composition. In a Tridentine Mass that part of the Ordinarium is usually spoken, or sung to the Gregorian melody provided in the Roman Missal, although early polyphonic settings for the \"Deo gratias\" response (e.g. in [[Guillaume de Machaut]]'s ''[[Messe de Nostre Dame]]'') and for the Benedicamus Domino (e.g. in ''[[Magnus Liber Organi]]'') are extant.\n\nThe Proper of the mass is usually not set to music in a mass itself, except in the case of a [[Music for the Requiem Mass|Requiem Mass]], but may be the subject of [[motet]]s or other musical compositions. Some mass compositions, like for instance [[Rossini]]'s ''[[Petite messe solennelle]]'', do however contain parts outside the Ordinarium. Some mass compositions even consist entirely of such additions: [[Schubert]]'s ''[[Deutsche Messe (Schubert)|Deutsche Messe]]'', a set of eight hymns with epilogue,<ref>[[Brian Newbould]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-Faikq3F8VYC&pg=PA285&dq=%22set+of+eight+hymns+with+epilogue%22&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=ogl6VMqkNYztaPzlgegF&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22set%20of%20eight%20hymns%20with%20epilogue%22&f=false ''Schubert: The Music and the Man'', pp. 284-285.] University of California Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0520219570}} {{ISBN|9780520219571}}</ref> is an example of such a mass.\n\nAlso purely instrumental compositions can be part of a mass celebration, e.g. a [[Sonata da chiesa]], sometimes with a liturgical function, like [[Church Sonatas (Mozart)|Mozart's Epistle Sonatas]].\n\n====Proprium (Tridentine Mass)====\nIn a liturgical mass, there are other sections that may be sung, often in [[Gregorian chant]]. These sections, the \"Proper\" of the mass, change with the day and season according to the Church calendar, or according to the special circumstances of the mass. The sections of the Proper of the mass include the Introit, Gradual, Alleluia or Tract (depending on the time of year), Offertory and Communion.\n\nOrdinarium and proprium sections of a specific liturgical mass are not typically set to music together in the same composition. The one major exception to this rule is the mass for the dead, or [[requiem (music)|requiem]].\n\n====Other denominations====\nFollowing the distribution of the Sacrament, it is customary in most Lutheran churches to sing the [[Nunc dimittis]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Musical settings==\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\nThe earliest musical settings of the mass are [[Gregorian chant]]. The different portions of the Ordinary came into the liturgy at different times, with the Kyrie probably being first (perhaps as early as the 7th century) and the Credo being last (it did not become part of the Roman mass until 1014).<ref>Harvard Dictionary of Music, p. 472.</ref>\n\nIn the early 14th century, composers began writing polyphonic versions of the sections of the Ordinary. The reason for this surge in interest is not known, but it has been suggested that there was a shortage of new music since composers were increasingly attracted to secular music, and overall interest in writing sacred music had entered a period of decline.<ref>Lockwood, \"Mass\", Grove (1980).</ref>  The non-changing part of the mass, the Ordinary, then would have music which was available for performance all the time.\n\nTwo manuscripts from the 14th century, the [[Ivrea Codex]] and the [[Apt Codex]], are the primary sources for polyphonic settings of the Ordinary. Stylistically these settings are similar to both [[motet]]s and secular music of the time, with a three-voice texture dominated by the highest part. Most of this music was written or assembled at the papal court at [[Avignon]].\n\nSeveral [[Anonymous work|anonymous]] complete masses from the 14th century survive, including the [[Tournai Mass]]; however, discrepancies in style indicate that the movements of these masses were written by several composers and later compiled by scribes into a single set. The first complete mass we know of whose composer can be identified was the ''[[Messe de Nostre Dame]]'' (''Mass of Our Lady'') by [[Guillaume de Machaut]] in the 14th century.\n\n===Renaissance===\n{{Main articles|Cyclic mass|Paraphrase mass|Parody mass}}\n{{1500smusic|expanded=liturgies}}\n\nThe musical setting of the Ordinary of the mass was the principal large-scale form of the Renaissance. The earliest complete settings date from the 14th century, with the most famous example being the [[Messe de Nostre Dame]] of [[Guillaume de Machaut]]. Individual movements of the mass, and especially pairs of movements (such as Gloria-Credo pairs, or Sanctus-Agnus pairs), were commonly composed during the 14th and early 15th centuries. Complete masses by a single composer were the norm by the middle of the 15th century, and the form of the mass, with the possibilities for large-scale structure inherent in its multiple movement format, was the main focus of composers within the area of sacred music; it was not to be eclipsed until the motet and related forms became more popular in the first decades of the 16th century.\n\nMost 15th-century masses were based on a [[cantus firmus]], usually from a Gregorian chant, and most commonly put in the tenor voice. The cantus firmus sometimes appeared simultaneously in other voices, using a variety of [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] techniques. Later in the century, composers such as [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Johannes Ockeghem]], and [[Jacob Obrecht]], used secular tunes for cantus firmi. This practice was accepted with little controversy until prohibited by the [[Council of Trent]] in 1562. In particular, the song ''[[L'homme arm\u00e9]]'' has a long history with composers; more than 40 separate mass settings exist.\n\nOther techniques for organizing the [[cyclic mass]] evolved by the beginning of the 16th century, including the [[paraphrase mass|paraphrase]] technique, in which the cantus firmus was elaborated and ornamented, and the [[Parody mass|parody]] technique, in which several voices of a polyphonic source, not just one, were incorporated into the texture of the mass. Paraphrase and parody supplanted cantus-firmus as the techniques of choice in the 16th century: [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]] alone wrote 51 parody masses.\n\nYet another technique used to organize the multiple movements of a mass was [[canon (music)|canon]]. The earliest masses based entirely on canon are Johannes Ockeghem's ''[[Missa prolationum]]'', in which each movement is a [[prolation canon]] on a freely-composed tune, and the ''[[Missa L'homme arm\u00e9 (Faugues)|Missa L'homme arm\u00e9]]'' of [[Guillaume Faugues]], which is also entirely canonic but also uses the famous tune ''L'homme arm\u00e9'' throughout.  [[Pierre de La Rue]] wrote four separate canonic masses based on plainchant, and one of [[Josquin des Prez]]'s mature masses, the ''[[Missa Ad fugam]]'', is entirely canonic and free of borrowed material.<ref>Bloxham, p. 196</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Missa sine nomine]]'', literally \"Mass without a name\", refers to a mass written on freely composed material. Sometimes these masses were named for other things, such as Palestrina's famous ''[[Missa Papae Marcelli]]'', the Mass of Pope Marcellus, and many times they were canonic masses, as in [[Missa sine nomine (Josquin)|Josquin's ''Missa sine nomine'']].\n\nMany famous and influential masses were composed by [[Josquin des Prez]], the single most influential composer of the middle Renaissance. At the end of the 16th century, prominent representatives of ''a cappella'' choral [[counterpoint]] included the Englishman [[William Byrd]], the Castilian [[Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria]] and the Roman [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], whose ''Mass for Pope Marcellus'' is sometimes credited with saving [[polyphony]] from the censure of the Council of Trent. By the time of Palestrina, however, most composers outside of Rome were using other forms for their primary creative outlet for expression in the realm of sacred music, principally the [[motet]] and the [[madrigale spirituale]]; composers such as the members of the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian School]] preferred the possibilities inherent in the new forms. Other composers, such as [[Orlande de Lassus]], working in Munich and comfortably distant from the conservative influence of the [[Council of Trent]], continued to write [[parody mass]]es on secular songs. Monteverdi composed masses in [[Prima pratica|stile antico]], the ''[[Missa in illo tempore]]'' was published in 1610, one ''[[Messa a 4 da cappella]]'' in 1641 as part of ''[[Selva morale e spirituale]]'' along with single movements of the mass in [[stile concertato]], another ''[[Messa a 4 da cappella (1650)|Messa a 4 da cappella]]'' was published after his death, in 1650.\n\n===Baroque to Romantic (Catholic and Lutheran traditions)===\nThe early Baroque era initiated stylistic changes which led to increasing disparity between masses written entirely in the traditional polyphonic manner (stile antico), whose principal advancements were the use of the basso continuo and the gradual adoption of a wider harmonic vocabulary, and the mass in modern style with solo voices and instrumental obbligatos. The Lutheran [[Michael Praetorius]] composed a mass for double choir in the old style, which he published in 1611 in the collection of church music for the mass in Latin, ''[[Missodia Sionia]]''. Composers such as [[Henri Dumont]] (1610\u20131684) continued to compose plainsong settings, distinct from and more elaborate than the earlier Gregorian chants.<ref name=Wye>[http://sscm-jscm.press.illinois.edu/v5/no1/vanwye.html Benjamin van Wye, Review of Marc-Antoine Charpentier, ''Messe pour le Port-Royal'', in  ''Journal of Seventeenth-Century Music'' 1999] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719211643/http://sscm-jscm.press.illinois.edu/v5/no1/vanwye.html |date=2011-07-19 }}</ref>\n\nA further disparity arose between the festive [[missa solemnis]] and the [[missa brevis]], a more compact setting. Composers like [[Johann Joseph Fux]] in the 18th century continued to cultivate the stile antico mass, which was suitable for use on weekdays and at times when orchestral masses were not practical or appropriate, and in 19th-century Germany the [[Cecilian movement]] kept the tradition alive. [[Franti\u0161ek Brixi]], who worked at the [[Prague Cathedral]], wrote his ''[[Missa aulica]]'', a Missa brevis in C, for four voices, trumpets, violin and continuo, \"cantabile\" but solo voices just singing short passages within chorale movements. The Italian style cultivated orchestral masses including soloists, chorus and obbligato instruments. It spread to the German-speaking Catholic countries north of the Alps, using instruments for color and creating dialogues between solo voices and chorus that was to become characteristic of the 18th-century Viennese style. The so-called \"Neapolitan\" or \"cantata\" mass style also had much influence on 18th-century mass composition with its short sections set as self-contained solo arias and choruses in a variety of styles.<ref name=RocheLingas>Roche, Elizabeth and Alex Lingas. \"Mass\". ''The Oxford Companion to Music''. Ed. Alison Latham. Oxford Music Online.</ref>\n\nThe 18th-century Viennese mass combines operatic elements from the cantata mass with a trend in the symphony and concerto to organize choral movements. The large scale masses of the first half of the century still have Glorias and Credos divided into many movements, unlike smaller masses for ordinary churches. Many of Mozart's masses are in missa brevis form, as are some of Haydn's early ones. Later masses, especially of Haydn, are of symphonic structure, with long sections divided into fewer movements, organized like a symphony, with soloists used as an ensemble rather than as individuals. The distinction between concert masses and those intended for liturgical use also came into play as the 19th century progressed.<ref name=RocheLingas/>\n\n====Major works====\nAfter the Renaissance, the mass tended not to be the central genre for any one composer, yet among the most famous works of the Baroque, Classical, and Romantic periods are settings of the [[Ordinary of the Mass]]. Many of the famous masses of the Romantic era were [[Requiem]]s, one of the most famous, [[A German Requiem (Brahms)|''A German Requiem'']] by [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], being the composer's own selection of biblical texts rather than a setting of a standard liturgy.\n\nAmong the masses written in these eras are:\n* Messa Concertata by [[Francesco Cavalli|Cavalli]] (1656)\n* Mass for double choir, from ''[[Missodia Sionia]]'', by Michael Praetorius (1611)\n* ''Requiem'' by [[Jean Gilles (composer)|Jean Gilles]]\n* ''Missa assumpta est Maria : Missa sex vocibus cum simphonia'' H 11 & H 11 a (1699 ?) by [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier]], and 11 others masses, H 1, H 2 ''(pour les tr\u00e9pass\u00e9s''), H 3, H 4 (''for 4 Chorus''), H 5, H 6, H 7, H 8, H9, H 10, H 513.\n* Missa Scala Aretina by [[Francesc Valls]] (Barcelona, 1702)\n* [[Mass in B minor]] and four [[Missa (Bach)|Missae]] by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]\n* \"High Masses\" by Czech Baroque composer [[Jan Dismas Zelenka]]\n* 18 [[List of masses by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|masses]] by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], including the [[Great Mass in C minor]] (1782) and [[Requiem (Mozart)|Requiem]]\n* ''Mass for double choir and double orchestra'' by [[Henry Desmarest]]\n* ''Mass of Requiem'' by [[Andr\u00e9 Campra]] 1723\n* ''Requiem'', (Great mass for dead people) by [[Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph Gossec]] 1760 \n* 14 [[List of Masses by Joseph Haydn|masses]] by [[Joseph Haydn]], including [[Missa in angustiis|Nelson Mass]] and [[Missa in tempore belli|Mass in Time of War]]\n* [[Mass in C major (Beethoven)|Mass in C major]] and [[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis in D Major]] by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]\n* [[Mass No. 2 (Schubert)|Mass in G Major]] and 5 others by [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]]\n* [[Missa Choralis]] and [[Hungarian Coronation Mass]] by [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]\n* ''Requiem'' by [[Hector Berlioz]] 1837\n* [[Mass No. 1 (Bruckner)|Mass in D Minor]], [[Mass No. 2 (Bruckner)|Mass in E Minor]] and [[Mass No. 3 (Bruckner)|Mass in F Minor]] by [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]]\n* ''Requiem'' by [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]] 1878\n* ''[[St. Cecilia Mass]]'' and 13 others by [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]]\n* [[Messa (Puccini)|Messa]] by [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]\n* [[Petite messe solennelle]] (1863) by [[Gioachino Rossini]]\n* [[Mass (Paine)|Mass in D minor, op. 10]] (1866) by [[John Knowles Paine]]\n* [[Requiem (Faur\u00e9)|Requiem]] by Gabriel Faur\u00e9\n* [[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]] by Giuseppe Verdi\n* [[Requiem (Dvo\u0159\u00e1k)|Requiem in B-flat minor]] (1890) by [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]]\n* [[Mass (Dvo\u0159\u00e1k)|Mass in D major, Op. 86]] (1887) by [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]]\n\n===20th and 21st century===\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, composers were combining modern elements with the characteristics of Renaissance polyphony and plainchant, which continued to influence 20th-century composers, possibly fueled by the Motu proprio [[Tra le sollecitudini]] (1903) of Pope Pius X. The revival of choral celebration of Holy Communion in the Anglican Church in the late 19th century marked the beginning several liturgical settings of mass texts in English, particularly for choir and organ.<ref name=Grove_McKinnon>McKinnon, James W. et al. \u201cMass\u201d. Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online.</ref> The movement for liturgical reform has resulted in revised forms of the mass, making it more functional by using a variety of accessible styles, popular or ethnic, and using new methods such as refrain and response to encourage congregational involvement.<ref name=Grove_McKinnon/> Nevertheless, the mass in its musical incarnation continues to thrive beyond the walls of the church, as is evident in many of the 21st-century masses listed here which were composed for concert performance rather than in service of the Roman Rite.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n====Musical reforms of Pius X====\nPope [[Pius X]] initiated many regulations reforming the liturgical music of the mass in the early 20th century. He felt that some of the masses composed by the famous post-Renaissance composers were too long and often more appropriate for a theatrical rather than a church setting. He advocated primarily Gregorian plainchant and polyphony. He was primarily influenced by the work of the [[Abbey of Solesmes]]. Some of the rules he put forth include the following:\n* That any mass be composed in an integrated fashion, not by assembling different compositions for different parts.\n* That all percussive instruments should be forbidden.\n* That the piano be explicitly forbidden.\n* That the centuries' old practice of ''alternatim'' between choir and organ be concluded immediately.\n* That ideally the choir should be all male.\n* That the congregation itself should ideally be trained to sing the various modes of Gregorian chant along with the choir.\n\nThese regulations carry little if any weight today, especially after the changes of the [[Second Vatican Council]]. Quite recently, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] has encouraged a return to chant as the primary music of the liturgy, as this is explicitly mentioned in the documents of the [[Second Vatican Council]], specifically Sacrosanctum Concilium 116.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19631204_sacrosanctum-concilium_en.html#116 Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy Sacrosanctum Concilium<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n====Major works====\n=====20th century=====\n\nIn the 20th century, composers continued to write masses, in an even wider diversity of style, form and function than before.\n\n* Requiem Mass by [[Herbert Howells]]\n* [[Requiem (Durufl\u00e9)|Requiem]] by [[Maurice Durufl\u00e9]]\n* [[Mass (Poulenc)|Mass]] in G by [[Francis Poulenc]]\n* Messe Solennelle by [[Jean Langlais]]\n* [[Glagolitic Mass]] (1926) by [[Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek]]\n* [[Mass in G minor (Vaughan Williams)|Mass in G minor]] by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]\n* [[Mass, Op. 130]] for choir and brass by [[Joseph Jongen]] (1945)\n* [[Requiem]] by [[Bruno Maderna]] (1946)\n* [[Mass (Stravinsky)|Mass]] by [[Igor Stravinsky]]\n* [[Mass (Bernstein)|Mass]] by [[Leonard Bernstein]]<ref name=\"brit_Mass\"/>\n* [[War Requiem]] by [[Benjamin Britten]]\n* Mass for mixed chorus (1963) by [[Paul Hindemith]]\n* Requiem, for soprano and mezzo-soprano solo, mixed chorus and orchestra (1963\u201365) by [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti]]\n* [[Requiem (Lloyd Webber)|Requiem]] by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]\n* [[Mass in F Minor]] by [[The Electric Prunes]]\n* [[Mass (Maslansky)|Mass]] by [[David Maslanka]]\n* [[Berliner Messe]] and [[Missa Syllabica]] by [[Arvo P\u00e4rt]]\n* Mass by [[Frank Martin (composer)|Frank Martin]]\n* A Symphonic Mass by [[George Lloyd (composer)|George Lloyd]]\n* Missa Laudate Pueri by [[Bertold Hummel]]<ref>http://www.bertoldhummel.de/english/commentaries/opus_98B.html</ref>\n* [[Mass of the Children]], [[Requiem (Rutter)|Requiem]], and [[Gloria (Rutter)|Gloria]] by [[John Rutter]]\n* [[Mass To Hope]] by [[Dave Brubeck]]\n* Misa Criolla by [[Ariel Ram\u00edrez]]\n* Misa by [[Rodrigo Prats]]\n* [[New Plainsong Mass]] by [[David Hurd]]\n* Mass in Honor of St. Cecilia by [[Lou Harrison]]\n* [[African Sanctus]] by [[David Fanshawe]]\n* [[Polish Requiem]] by [[Krzysztof Penderecki]]\n*[[Missa Luba]] by Guido Haazen\n* Missa supra Parsifal (1985) by Dimitri Aguero <ref>http://www.spectable.com/concert-chorale-le-bon-temperament/327442/359962</ref>\n*B\u1ed9 l\u1ec5 Seraphim (1960) by [[Paul Nguy\u00ean Van H\u00f2a|Paul Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Ho\u00e0]]\n\n=====21st century=====\n* [[Missa Latina]]: pro Pace by [[Roberto Sierra]]\n* [[Missa pro Pace]] (Mass for Peace) by [[Kentaro Sato (composer)|Kentaro Sato]]\n* [[The Armed Man]]: A Mass for Peace by [[Karl Jenkins]]\n* Son of God Mass by [[James Whitbourn]]\n* Missa Carolae (Mass from Christmas Carols) by [[James Whitbourn]]\n* Bright Mass with Canons by [[Nico Muhly]]\n* Misa Flamenca by [[Paco Pe\u00f1a]]\n* Mass (2000) by [[James MacMillan]]\n* Misa de San Isidro (2001) by [[Dieter Lehnhoff]]\n* Requiem (2001\u20132002) by [[Christopher Rouse (composer)|Christopher Rouse]]\n* Missa Brevis by [[Douglas Knehans]]\n* Missa Gongso, for choir and gamelan, by [[Neil Sorrell]]\n* [[Missa Concertante]] (2008) by [[Marcus Paus]]\n* Messe br\u00e8ve: \"Acclamez le Seigneur!\", in French for choir and organ ( 2011) by Jean Huot;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diosher.org/file/Ens_AVRIL.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214003222/http://www.diosher.org/file/Ens_AVRIL.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-14 }}</ref>\n* [[Street Requiem]] (for those who have died on the street) for choir and orchestra by [[Kathleen McGuire]], [[Jonathon Welch]] and Andy Payne (2014) <ref>https://streetrequiem.teamapp.com</ref> \n* Messe de la Mis\u00e9ricorde divine, in French for choir and organ (2015) by Jean Huot;<ref>http://www.diosher.org/file/pdf/ensemble/Web_Ensemble_Vol_46_no_1_janv._2015{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n* Missa Papae Francisci (2015) by [[Ennio Morricone]] <ref>http://www.rai5.rai.it/articoli/missa-papae-francisci-morricone/30466/default.aspx</ref>\n* Mass of Innocence and Experience for SATB and organ (2006) by [[Stephen Hough]]\n* Missa Mirablis SATB and organ or orchestra (2007) by [[Stephen Hough]]\n\n===Masses written for the Anglican liturgy===\nThese are more often known as 'Communion Services', and differ not only in that they are settings of English words,<ref name=\"brit_Mass\">{{Cite web | title = Mass: Music | work = Encyclopedia Britannica | date = 11 October 2007 | accessdate = 20 April 2018 | url = https://www.britannica.com/art/mass-music }}</ref> but also, as mentioned above, in that the Gloria usually forms the last movement. Sometimes the Kyrie movement takes the form of sung responses to the Ten Commandments, 1 to 9 being followed by the words 'Lord have mercy upon us and incline our hearts to keep this law', and the tenth by 'Lord have mercy upon us and write all these thy laws in our hearts, we beseech thee'. Since the texts of the 'Benedictus qui venit' and the 'Agnus Dei' do not actually feature in the liturgy of the 1662 [[Book of Common Prayer]], these movements are often missing from some of the earlier Anglican settings. [[Charles Villiers Stanford]] composed a Benedictus and Agnus in the key of F major which was published separately to complete his service in C.\n\nWith reforms in the Anglican liturgy, the movements are now usually sung in the same order that they are in the Roman Catholic rite. Choral settings of the Creed, the most substantial movement, are nowadays rarely performed in Anglican cathedrals.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nWell known Anglican settings of the mass, which may be found in the repertoire of many English cathedrals are:\n\n* [[Harold Darke|Darke]] in F\n* [[Harold Darke|Darke]] in E\n* [[Harold Darke|Darke]] in A minor\n* [[John Ireland (composer)|Ireland]] in C\n* [[Charles Villiers Stanford|Stanford]] in C & F\n* [[Charles Villiers Stanford|Stanford]] in B flat\n* [[Charles Villiers Stanford|Stanford]] in A\n* [[Herbert Sumsion|Sumsion]] in F\n* [[George Oldroyd|Oldroyd]], Mass of the Quiet Hour\n* [[Francis Jackson (composer)|Jackson]] in G\n* [[Herbert Howells|Howells]], Collegium Regale\n* [[Kenneth Leighton|Leighton]] in D\n* [[Tertius Noble|Noble]] in B minor\n* [[Basil Harwood|Harwood]] in A flat\n* [[Charles Wood (composer)|Wood]] in the [[Phrygian mode]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Classical music}}\n*[[Alternatim]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Gustave Reese]], ''Music in the Renaissance''.

They typically consist of a pair of [[String (cord)|strings]] or cords, one for each shoe, finished off at both ends with stiff sections, known as [[aglet]]s. Each shoelace typically passes through a series of holes, eyelets, loops or hooks on either side of the shoe. Loosening the lacing allows the shoe to open wide enough for the foot to be inserted or removed. Tightening the lacing and tying off the ends secures the foot firmly within the shoe.\n\n== Shoelace construction ==\nTraditional shoelaces were made of [[leather]], [[cotton]], [[jute]], [[hemp]], or other materials used in the manufacture of [[rope]]. Modern shoelaces often incorporate various [[synthetic fibers]], which are generally more slippery and thus more prone to coming undone than those made from traditional fibers. On the other hand, smooth synthetic shoelaces generally have a less rough appearance, suffer less wear from friction, and are less susceptible to rotting from moisture. Specialized fibers like flame resistant [[nomex]] are applied in [[safety boot]]s for [[firefighter]]s.\n\nThere are also various [[Elastomer|elasticized]] shoelaces:\n# Traditional \"elastic\" laces look identical to normal laces, and can simply be tied and untied as normal. They may also come with a permanent clip so they can be fastened invisibly.\n# \"Knotty\" laces have a series of \"fat\" sections, which restrict movement through eyelets. These can be used to adjust tension throughout the lacing area. These laces can be tied or the ends can be left loose.\n# \"Twirly\" laces are like a tight elastic helix, which can simply be pulled tight without requiring a knot.\nElastic laces both make the lacing more comfortable, as well as allowing the shoe to be slipped on and off without tying or untying, which makes them a popular choice for children, the elderly and athletes.\n\n[[Image:Three Different Aglets.jpg|thumb|200px|Three shoelaces tipped with three different [[aglet]]s: copper, plastic, and brass]]\nThe stiff section at each end of the shoelace, which both keeps the twine from unraveling and also makes it easier to hold the lace and feed it through the eyelets, is called an ''[[aglet]],'' also spelled ''aiglet.''\n\nShoelaces with a flat cross-section are generally easier to hold and stay tied more securely than those with a round cross-section due to the increased surface area for friction.<ref>{{cite web|last=Crowther|first=Ken|title=It's not the knot|url=https://www.newscientist.com/topic/lastword/its-not-the-knot/|work=[[New Scientist]]|publisher= [[Reed Business Information]]|accessdate=15 April 2014}}</ref>  Very wide flat laces are often called \"fat laces\". Leather shoelaces with a square cross-section, which are very common on boat shoes, are notoriously prone to coming undone.\n\nShoelaces can be coated, either in the factory or with aftermarket products, to increase [[friction]] and help them stay tied.\n\n== Shoelace tying ==\n{{Main|Shoelace knot}}\n[[Image:Shoelace knot.svg|thumb|Basic shoe-tying knot]]\n[[File:Red shoelace.jpg|thumb|A knot squashes the cord and this stops the lace end passing through the knot]]\nWhen a shoelace is secured with a knot, the lace is crimped, or squashed. Primarily this is what stops the lace from coming undone. In effect, the lace is narrower inside the knot than it is on the loose end, and the loose end cannot make itself smaller and slide though the knot.  Generally, a flat tubular lace will stay tied more easily than a round lace with a core because the flat lace can be more crimped within the knot. Most laces, however, are round and have core of cotton yarn, especially boot laces. For these to stay tied securely, the core on the inside of the lace must be soft and compressible. A secondary factor of laces coming undone is the knot itself slipping. This is due to a lack of friction. Cotton laces have a rough surface and will make a more reliable knot compared to polyester (the most common yarn used in shoelaces). In addition, a lace can be smooth or have a coarse surface, which will also affect performance. Finishing processes are available, including waxing and silicone treatments, which enhance friction and stop knot slippage. These are important design factors in the manufacture of hiking-boot laces.\n\n===Common bow===\nShoelaces are typically tied off at the top of the shoe using a simple [[bow knot]]. Besides securing the shoe, this also takes up the length of shoelace exposed after tightening. The common bow consists of two half-knots tied one on top of the other, with the second half-knot looped in order to allow quick untying. When required, the knot can be readily loosened by pulling one or both of the loose ends.\n\nWhen tying the half-knots, a right-over-left half-knot followed by a left-over-right half-knot (or vice versa) forms a square or [[reef knot]], a fairly effective knot for the purpose of tying shoelaces. However, tying two consecutive right-over-left half-knots (or two consecutive left-over-right half-knots) forms the infamous [[granny knot]], which is much less secure.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ashley |first=Clifford W. |title=The Ashley Book of Knots |year=1944 |publisher=Doubleday |isbn=0-385-04025-3 |page=75}}</ref> Most people who use it will find themselves regularly retying their shoelaces.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/grannyknot.htm|title=The 'Granny Knot'|publisher=Ian's Shoelace Site|accessdate=2016-06-13}}</ref>\n\nIf the loops lie across the shoe (left to right), the knot is probably a square knot. If they lie along the shoe (heel to toe), the knot is probably a granny knot.\n\n===Other more secure knots===\n[[File:ELTEN 765841 \u2013 RENZO Mid ESD S3.jpg|thumb|Ian's Secure Shoelace Knot used on a pair of [[safety boots]]]]\n\nThere are several more secure alternatives to the common shoelace bow, with names such as Turquoise Turtle Shoelace Knot, or ''Shoemaker's Knot'', Better Bow Shoelace Knot, Surgeon's Shoelace Knot, and Ian's Secure Shoelace Knot<ref>[https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/secureknot.htm Ian's Secure Shoelace Knot]</ref>, or ''double slip knot''. One such knot has been patented in 1999 under the title \"Shoelace tying system\".<ref name=\"Shoelace knot patent\">{{cite web |url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5997051.html|title=Shoelace tying system |publisher=Free Patents Online |accessdate=2010-06-11}}</ref> These are all variations of the same concept of looping the top part of the knot twice instead of once, which results in a finished bow of almost identical appearance but with the laces wrapped twice around the middle. This double-wrap holds the shoelaces more securely tied while still allowing them to be untied with a (slightly firmer) pull on the loose end(s). Possibly the simplest, also neat and quite effective, is after tying a common bow to tie a [[half-hitch]] with one or other loose end around its adjacent half bow, close to the knot; it is untied by pulling on the other (unhitched) free end.\n\n===Length===\nThe proper length of a shoelace, fitting it to a shoe, varies according to the type of lacing used, as well as the type of lace. However, at a rough reference the following guide can be used.<ref>Royal Laces.</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! No of holes !!

One such method, patented in 2003 as \"Double helix shoe lacing process\", runs in a [[double helix]] pattern and results in less friction and faster and easier tightening and loosening.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6513211.html |title=Double helix shoe lacing process |publisher=Free Patents Online |accessdate=2010-06-11}}</ref> Another method, called \"Rinlers Instant Lace Up\", use additional accessories for instant tightening and loosening.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hildus.com/method.html |title=Rinlers Instant Lace Up |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622060806/http://www.hildus.com/method.html |archivedate=2012-06-22 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Black Etnies shoes with checkerboard laces.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of [[Etnies]] shoes with checkerboard laces]]\nMany other lacing methods have been developed purely for appearance, often at the expense of functionality. One of the most popular decorative methods, [[checkerboard]] lacing, is very difficult to tighten or loosen without destroying the pattern. Shoes with checkerboard lacing are generally treated as \"slip-ons\".\n\nMost of these lacing methods are not suitable for formalwear.\n\n== History ==\nIt is as difficult to determine the exact history of shoelaces as it is for shoes. Archaeological records of footwear are rare because shoes were generally made of materials that deteriorated readily. The [[Areni-1 shoe]], which has been dated to around 3500 BC, is a simple leather \"shoe\" with leather \"shoelaces\" passing through slotted \"eyelets\" cut into the hide. The more complex shoes worn by [[\u00d6tzi the Iceman]], who lived around 3300 BC, were bound with \"shoelaces\" made of lime bark string.\n\nAs for shoelaces in the sense that we know them in modern times, the [[Museum of London]] has documented examples of medieval footwear dating from as far back as the 12th century, which clearly show the lacing passing through a series of hooks or eyelets down the front or side of the shoe and being tied in a knot rather than hanging loose.<ref name=\"Shoes and Pattens\">{{cite book |last=Grew |first=F. |author2=de Neegaard, M. |title=Shoes and Pattens - Medieval Finds from Excavations in London |year=2006 |publisher=The Boydell Press |isbn=1-84383-238-0 }}</ref> Indeed the code of the [[Knights Templar]] banned the wearing of shoelaces as a vanity that was \"abominable and pagan\".<ref>{{cite book\n |last=Jones\n |first=Dan\n |year=2017\n |title=The Templars: The Rise and Spectacular Fall of God's Holy Warriors\n |url=\n |location=\n |publisher=Viking\n |page= <!-- or pages= -->\n |isbn=978-0525428305\n |author-link= }}</ref>\n\n===Myths===\nA popular myth states that [[Gurkha]] soldiers, fighting for Britain, crawled along the ground, feeling the laces of the soldiers they encountered. British soldiers employed straight- or bar-lacing, while Japanese troops employed a criss-cross pattern. Criss-cross laces could therefore mean the difference between life and death. The importance of correct lacing was thus emphasized to British troops.  Whether true or not, there is an account of Gurkha soldiers checking the boots and laces of soldiers they encounter in the dark to find if they are friend or foe.<ref>{{Citation\n | first         = Larry (Lew)\n | last          = Fox\n | authorlink    =\n | title         = Sleep Johny Sleep at Cassino\n | publisher     = [[BBC]]\n | series        = WW2 People's War\n | id            = A5458656\n | date          = 2005-09-01\n | location      = [[Monte Cassino]], [[Italy]]\n | url           = http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/56/a5458656.shtml\n | accessdate    = 2012-03-31\n}}</ref>\n\n== Shoelace accessories ==\n[[Image:deubre.png|right|200px|thumb|A deubr\u00e9 on a [[Air Force 1 (shoe)|Nike Air Force 1 sneaker]].]]\nThere are many shoelace accessories. There are hooks to help lace shoelaces tightly. They are especially useful for skates where tight lacing is important. Shoelace covers protect the laces, especially in [[wrestling shoe|wrestling]]. Shoelace [[Amulet|charms]] are decorative, as are colored shoelaces. Some laces are colored using expensive dyes, other, more \"personal\" colors, are drawn-on with [[permanent marker]]s. Some [[dress code]]s (especially high schools) will specifically exclude color laces and charms. Lace-locks hold laces together, eliminating the need for tying. There are shoelace tags, sometimes called [[deubr\u00e9]], with two holes or slots through which the shoelace is passed. These are worn on the section of shoelace closest to the toes, in other words the last lace, so that the image or writing on the tag is visible (as can be seen at right).\n\n== Photos of shoelaces ==\n<gallery>\nImage:Shoelace skulls.png|A shoelace featuring red and white skulls.\nImage:Selling_shoelaces.JPG|Shoelaces for sale on Avenue Road in [[Bangalore]].\nFile:Schn\u00fcrsenkel in verschiedenen Farben.JPG|Shoelaces in various [[color]]s.\nFile:Photo Bate\u017eo Ka Mikilu.JPG|Lacing assortment\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Drawstring]], similar in concept.\n* [[Lock Laces]]\n* [[Shoelace knot]], a knot commonly used to tie shoelaces.\n* [[Velcro|Velcro hook-and-loop fasteners]], another system sometimes used to secure footwear.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|shoelace}}\n{{Commons|Shoelaces}}\n* [http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/ Ian's Shoelace Site]&nbsp;\u2014 Extensive discussion of ways to lace shoes and tie knots in shoelaces\n* [http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/shoelacecalc.htm Shoelace Length Calculator] at Ian's Shoelace Site\n* [http://www.shoeknots.com/ Tying instructions, with images]\n* [http://www.wikihow.com/Lace-Shoes wikiHow on How to Lace Shoes]\n* [https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/04/17/523636317/untangling-the-mystery-of-why-shoelaces-come-untied Study Explains Why Shoelaces Come Untied]\n{{Footwear}}\n[[Category:Footwear accessories]]\n[[Category:Textile closures]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Shoestring|other uses|Shoestring (disambiguation)}}\n{{for|the football player nicknamed \"Shoelace\"|Denard Robinson}}\n[[Image:Shoelaces 20050719 001.jpg|thumb|Black shoelace]]\n'''Shoelaces''', also called '''shoestrings''' (US English) or '''bootlaces''' (UK English), are a system commonly used to secure [[shoes]], [[boot]]s, and other [[footwear]].

If they lie along the shoe (heel to toe), the knot is probably a granny knot.\n\n===Other more secure knots===\n[[File:ELTEN 765841 \u2013 RENZO Mid ESD S3.jpg|thumb|Ian's Secure Shoelace Knot used on a pair of [[safety boots]]]]\n\nThere are several more secure alternatives to the common shoelace bow, with names such as Turquoise Turtle Shoelace Knot, or ''Shoemaker's Knot'', Better Bow Shoelace Knot, Surgeon's Shoelace Knot, and Ian's Secure Shoelace Knot<ref>[https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/secureknot.htm Ian's Secure Shoelace Knot]</ref>, or ''double slip knot''. One such knot has been patented in 1999 under the title \"Shoelace tying system\".<ref name=\"Shoelace knot patent\">{{cite web |url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5997051.html|title=Shoelace tying system |publisher=Free Patents Online |accessdate=2010-06-11}}</ref> These are all variations of the same concept of looping the top part of the knot twice instead of once, which results in a finished bow of almost identical appearance but with the laces wrapped twice around the middle. This double-wrap holds the shoelaces more securely tied while still allowing them to be untied with a (slightly firmer) pull on the loose end(s). Possibly the simplest, also neat and quite effective, is after tying a common bow to tie a [[half-hitch]] with one or other loose end around its adjacent half bow, close to the knot; it is untied by pulling on the other (unhitched) free end.\n\n===Length===\nThe proper length of a shoelace, fitting it to a shoe, varies according to the type of lacing used, as well as the type of lace. However, at a rough reference the following guide can be used.<ref>Royal Laces.</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! No of holes !!

Formal shoes usually demand straight-bar lacing to preserve their clean, neat look.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://shoetreeproject.com/lace-formal-dress-shoes/|title=How To Lace Formal Dress Shoes {{!}} ShoeTree Project|date=2018-02-05|work=ShoeTree Project|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en-US}}</ref> This is especially true for dress shoes using a closed lacing system such as [[Oxfords]], because the central shoelace crossovers of criss-cross lacing prevent the sides of the shoe from coming together in the middle.\n\n==== Criss-cross lacing ====\n[[Image:A classic Black pair of Converse All Stars resting on the Black & White Ed. Shoebox (1998-2002).JPG|thumb|left|200px|Chuck Taylor All-Stars with criss-cross lacing]]\nThe most common lacing method, termed ''criss-cross lacing'', is also one of the strongest and most efficient.<ref name=Nature>{{Citation\n | first         = Burkard\n | last          = Polster |author-link=Burkard Polster\n | title         = Mathematics: What is the best way to lace your shoes?\n |journal     = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]\n | volume=420\n | issue = 6915 | doi=10.1038/420476a\n | pages=476\n | pmid=12466832\n| year = 2002 }}</ref> However, they are reserved for more casual footwear, such as sneakers and boots.

One such method, patented in 2003 as \"Double helix shoe lacing process\", runs in a [[double helix]] pattern and results in less friction and faster and easier tightening and loosening.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6513211.html |title=Double helix shoe lacing process |publisher=Free Patents Online |accessdate=2010-06-11}}</ref> Another method, called \"Rinlers Instant Lace Up\", use additional accessories for instant tightening and loosening.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hildus.com/method.html |title=Rinlers Instant Lace Up |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622060806/http://www.hildus.com/method.html |archivedate=2012-06-22 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Black Etnies shoes with checkerboard laces.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of [[Etnies]] shoes with checkerboard laces]]\nMany other lacing methods have been developed purely for appearance, often at the expense of functionality. One of the most popular decorative methods, [[checkerboard]] lacing, is very difficult to tighten or loosen without destroying the pattern. Shoes with checkerboard lacing are generally treated as \"slip-ons\".\n\nMost of these lacing methods are not suitable for formalwear.\n\n== History ==\nIt is as difficult to determine the exact history of shoelaces as it is for shoes. Archaeological records of footwear are rare because shoes were generally made of materials that deteriorated readily. The [[Areni-1 shoe]], which has been dated to around 3500 BC, is a simple leather \"shoe\" with leather \"shoelaces\" passing through slotted \"eyelets\" cut into the hide. The more complex shoes worn by [[\u00d6tzi the Iceman]], who lived around 3300 BC, were bound with \"shoelaces\" made of lime bark string.\n\nAs for shoelaces in the sense that we know them in modern times, the [[Museum of London]] has documented examples of medieval footwear dating from as far back as the 12th century, which clearly show the lacing passing through a series of hooks or eyelets down the front or side of the shoe and being tied in a knot rather than hanging loose.<ref name=\"Shoes and Pattens\">{{cite book |last=Grew |first=F. |author2=de Neegaard, M. |title=Shoes and Pattens - Medieval Finds from Excavations in London |year=2006 |publisher=The Boydell Press |isbn=1-84383-238-0 }}</ref> Indeed the code of the [[Knights Templar]] banned the wearing of shoelaces as a vanity that was \"abominable and pagan\".<ref>{{cite book\n |last=Jones\n |first=Dan\n |year=2017\n |title=The Templars: The Rise and Spectacular Fall of God's Holy Warriors\n |url=\n |location=\n |publisher=Viking\n |page= <!-- or pages= -->\n |isbn=978-0525428305\n |author-link= }}</ref>\n\n===Myths===\nA popular myth states that [[Gurkha]] soldiers, fighting for Britain, crawled along the ground, feeling the laces of the soldiers they encountered. British soldiers employed straight- or bar-lacing, while Japanese troops employed a criss-cross pattern. Criss-cross laces could therefore mean the difference between life and death. The importance of correct lacing was thus emphasized to British troops.  Whether true or not, there is an account of Gurkha soldiers checking the boots and laces of soldiers they encounter in the dark to find if they are friend or foe.<ref>{{Citation\n | first         = Larry (Lew)\n | last          = Fox\n | authorlink    =\n | title         = Sleep Johny Sleep at Cassino\n | publisher     = [[BBC]]\n | series        = WW2 People's War\n | id            = A5458656\n | date          = 2005-09-01\n | location      = [[Monte Cassino]], [[Italy]]\n | url           = http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/56/a5458656.shtml\n | accessdate    = 2012-03-31\n}}</ref>\n\n== Shoelace accessories ==\n[[Image:deubre.png|right|200px|thumb|A deubr\u00e9 on a [[Air Force 1 (shoe)|Nike Air Force 1 sneaker]].]]\nThere are many shoelace accessories. There are hooks to help lace shoelaces tightly. They are especially useful for skates where tight lacing is important. Shoelace covers protect the laces, especially in [[wrestling shoe|wrestling]]. Shoelace [[Amulet|charms]] are decorative, as are colored shoelaces. Some laces are colored using expensive dyes, other, more \"personal\" colors, are drawn-on with [[permanent marker]]s. Some [[dress code]]s (especially high schools) will specifically exclude color laces and charms. Lace-locks hold laces together, eliminating the need for tying. There are shoelace tags, sometimes called [[deubr\u00e9]], with two holes or slots through which the shoelace is passed. These are worn on the section of shoelace closest to the toes, in other words the last lace, so that the image or writing on the tag is visible (as can be seen at right).\n\n== Photos of shoelaces ==\n<gallery>\nImage:Shoelace skulls.png|A shoelace featuring red and white skulls.\nImage:Selling_shoelaces.JPG|Shoelaces for sale on Avenue Road in [[Bangalore]].\nFile:Schn\u00fcrsenkel in verschiedenen Farben.JPG|Shoelaces in various [[color]]s.\nFile:Photo Bate\u017eo Ka Mikilu.JPG|Lacing assortment\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Drawstring]], similar in concept.\n* [[Lock Laces]]\n* [[Shoelace knot]], a knot commonly used to tie shoelaces.\n* [[Velcro|Velcro hook-and-loop fasteners]], another system sometimes used to secure footwear.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|shoelace}}\n{{Commons|Shoelaces}}\n* [http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/ Ian's Shoelace Site]&nbsp;\u2014 Extensive discussion of ways to lace shoes and tie knots in shoelaces\n* [http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/shoelacecalc.htm Shoelace Length Calculator] at Ian's Shoelace Site\n* [http://www.shoeknots.com/ Tying instructions, with images]\n* [http://www.wikihow.com/Lace-Shoes wikiHow on How to Lace Shoes]\n* [https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/04/17/523636317/untangling-the-mystery-of-why-shoelaces-come-untied Study Explains Why Shoelaces Come Untied]\n{{Footwear}}\n[[Category:Footwear accessories]]\n[[Category:Textile closures]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "name_user": "Arunuflex", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelaces"}

These have in recent years been granted [[Lebanese nationality law|Lebanese citizenship]] and, coupled with several [[Lebanese Civil War|civil wars]] between Islamic extremists and the [[Lebanese Armed Forces|Lebanese military]] that have caused many Christians to flee the country, have re-tipped the demographic balance in favour of the Muslims and the Sunnis in particular.<ref>International Journal of Kurdish Studies, Jan 2002 by Lokman I.

Like most [[DNA]] studies that attempt to identify a population's origins and migration patterns in the region that may have influenced the genetic make-up\u2014these studies have focused on two [[human genome]] segments, the [[Y chromosome]] (inherited only by males and passed only by fathers) and [[mtDNA]] (mitochondrial DNA, which passes only from mother to child). Both segments are unaffected by recombination, thus they provide an indicator of paternal and maternal origins, respectively.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nTheories from some studies propose to corroborate that the Lebanese trace genetic continuity with earlier inhabitants, regardless of their membership to any of Lebanon's different religious communities today. \"The genetic marker which identifies descendants of the ancient Levantines is found among members of all of Lebanon's religious communities\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Perry |first=Tom |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL0559096520070910 |title=In Lebanon DNA may yet heal rifts |publisher=Reuters |date= 10 September 2007|accessdate=4 July 2011}}</ref> as well as some Syrians and Palestinians. By identifying the ancient type of DNA attributed to the Phoenicians, geneticist Pierre Zalloua was also able to chart their spread out of the eastern [[Mediterranean]]. These markers were found in unusually high proportions in non-Lebanese samples from other parts of the \"Mediterranean coast where the Phoenicians are known to have established colonies, such as [[Carthage]] in today's [[Tunisia]].\"<ref name=\"reuters1\"/> The markers were also found among samples of [[Maltese people|Maltese]] and [[Spaniards]], where the Phoenicians were also known to have established colonies. The study shows that 1 out of 17 people in the countries surrounding the Mediterranean basin can be identified with the Phoenician genetic markers in their male chromosomes. However, the particular marker associated by some studies with the historical Phoenicians, [[haplogroup J2]], actually represents a complex mosaic of different demographic processes which affected the Mediterranean in prehistoric and historic times.<ref>Di Giacomo 2004, Semino 2004, Cruciani 2004</ref>\n\nBeyond this, more recent finds have also interested geneticists and Lebanese [[anthropologists]]. These indicate foreign non-Levantine admixture from some unexpected but not surprising sources, even if only in a small proportion of the samples. Like a story written in DNA, it recounts some of the major historical events seen in the land today known as Lebanon.\n\nAmong the more interesting genetic markers found are those that seem to indicate that a small proportion of Lebanese Christians (2%) and a smaller proportion of Lebanese Muslims are descended, in part, from European [[Crusaders|Crusader Christians]] and Arabian Muslims respectively. The author states that the \"study tells us that some European crusaders did not just conquer and leave behind castles. They left a subtle genetic connection as well.\"<ref name=\"nationalgeographic1\">{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/03/080328-crusaders-dna.html|title=Crusades, Islam Expansion Traced in Lebanon DNA}}</ref> In much the same manner, some of the Arabian Muslims did not just conquer and leave behind mosques.\n\n[[File:Lebanesefighta.JPG|thumb|Christian men from [[Mount Lebanon]], late 1800s]]\nIt was during a broader survey of [[Middle East]]ern populations conducted for the [[Genographic Project]] of the [[National Geographic Society]] that the findings were stumbled upon. \"We noticed some interesting lineages in the dataset.

Like most [[DNA]] studies that attempt to identify a population's origins and migration patterns in the region that may have influenced the genetic make-up\u2014these studies have focused on two [[human genome]] segments, the [[Y chromosome]] (inherited only by males and passed only by fathers) and [[mtDNA]] (mitochondrial DNA, which passes only from mother to child). Both segments are unaffected by recombination, thus they provide an indicator of paternal and maternal origins, respectively.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nTheories from some studies propose to corroborate that the Lebanese trace genetic continuity with earlier inhabitants, regardless of their membership to any of Lebanon's different religious communities today. \"The genetic marker which identifies descendants of the ancient Levantines is found among members of all of Lebanon's religious communities\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Perry |first=Tom |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL0559096520070910 |title=In Lebanon DNA may yet heal rifts |publisher=Reuters |date= 10 September 2007|accessdate=4 July 2011}}</ref> as well as some Syrians and Palestinians. By identifying the ancient type of DNA attributed to the Phoenicians, geneticist Pierre Zalloua was also able to chart their spread out of the eastern [[Mediterranean]]. These markers were found in unusually high proportions in non-Lebanese samples from other parts of the \"Mediterranean coast where the Phoenicians are known to have established colonies, such as [[Carthage]] in today's [[Tunisia]].\"<ref name=\"reuters1\"/> The markers were also found among samples of [[Maltese people|Maltese]] and [[Spaniards]], where the Phoenicians were also known to have established colonies. The study shows that 1 out of 17 people in the countries surrounding the Mediterranean basin can be identified with the Phoenician genetic markers in their male chromosomes. However, the particular marker associated by some studies with the historical Phoenicians, [[haplogroup J2]], actually represents a complex mosaic of different demographic processes which affected the Mediterranean in prehistoric and historic times.<ref>Di Giacomo 2004, Semino 2004, Cruciani 2004</ref>\n\nBeyond this, more recent finds have also interested geneticists and Lebanese [[anthropologists]]. These indicate foreign non-Levantine admixture from some unexpected but not surprising sources, even if only in a small proportion of the samples. Like a story written in DNA, it recounts some of the major historical events seen in the land today known as Lebanon.\n\nAmong the more interesting genetic markers found are those that seem to indicate that a small proportion of Lebanese Christians (2%) and a smaller proportion of Lebanese Muslims are descended, in part, from European [[Crusaders|Crusader Christians]] and Arabian Muslims respectively. The author states that the \"study tells us that some European crusaders did not just conquer and leave behind castles. They left a subtle genetic connection as well.\"<ref name=\"nationalgeographic1\">{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/03/080328-crusaders-dna.html|title=Crusades, Islam Expansion Traced in Lebanon DNA}}</ref> In much the same manner, some of the Arabian Muslims did not just conquer and leave behind mosques.\n\n[[File:Lebanesefighta.JPG|thumb|Christian men from [[Mount Lebanon]], late 1800s]]\nIt was during a broader survey of [[Middle East]]ern populations conducted for the [[Genographic Project]] of the [[National Geographic Society]] that the findings were stumbled upon. \"We noticed some interesting lineages in the dataset. Among Lebanese Christians, in particular, we found higher frequency (2%) of a genetic marker \u2014 [[R1b]] \u2014 that we typically see only in Western Europe.\"<ref name=\"nationalgeographic1\"/>\n\nThe lineage was seen at that \"higher\" frequency only in the Christian populations in Lebanon, even though among the Muslims it was not altogether absent. \"The study matched the [[western Europe]]an Y-chromosome lineage against thousands of people in [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], and the [[United Kingdom]].\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/03/080328-crusaders-dna.html |title=Crusades, Islam Expansion Traced in Lebanon DNA |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=28 October 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2011}}</ref> On the other hand, in the Lebanese Muslim population a similar pattern, this time associated with genetic markers from [[Arabia]], was also observed in \"higher\" preferential frequencies, although they too were not altogether absent in the Christian population. \"We found that a lineage that is very common in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] \u2014 Hg J*\u2014 is found in slightly higher frequencies preferentially in the Muslim population.\"<ref name=\"nationalgeographic1\"/>\nThe author of the study added that the findings \"certainly doesn't undermine the similarities among the various Lebanese communities, but it does agree with oral tradition.\"<ref name=\"nationalgeographic1\"/>\n\nOther unrelated studies have sought to establish relationships between the Lebanese people and other groups. At least one study by the International Institute of Anthropology in [[Paris]], [[France]], confirmed similarities in the Y-haplotype frequencies in Lebanese, Palestinian, and [[Sephardim|Sephardic Jewish]] men, identifying them as \"three Near-Eastern populations sharing a common geographic origin.\"<ref>{{cite journal|title=Y-chromosome DNA haplotypes in Jews: comparisons with Lebanese and Palestinians|first1=G\u00e9rard|last1=Lucotte|first2=G\u00e9raldine|last2=Mercier|date=1 January 2003|journal=Genet.

In contrast, the zygotes of monotremes, like those of birds and reptiles, undergo meroblastic (partial) division.

All five extant species show prolonged parental care of infants, with low rates of reproduction and relatively long life-spans.\n\nMonotremes are also noteworthy in their zygotic development. Most mammal zygotes go through holoblastic [[cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]], meaning that after fertilization, the ovum splits into multiple, divisible daughter cells. In contrast, the zygotes of monotremes, like those of birds and reptiles, undergo meroblastic (partial) division. This means the cells at the yolk's edge have cytoplasm continuous with that of the egg, which allows the yolk and embryo to exchange waste and nutrients with the surrounding cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Myers 2008\"/>\n\n==Physiology==\n[[File:Monotreme reproductive organs.png|thumb|Monotreme female reproductive organs]]\n[[File:Male Platypus Reproductive System.svg|thumb|Male Platypus Reproductive System. 1.

Containing unilobar nuclei, these cells are one of the types of mononuclear leukocytes which shelter [[azurophil granules]]. The archetypal geometry of the monocyte nucleus is ellipsoidal; metaphorically bean-shaped or kidney-shaped, although the most significant distinction is that the nuclear envelope should not be hyperbolically furcated into lobes.  Contrast to this classification occurs in [[polymorphonuclear leukocyte]]s. Monocytes compose 2% to 10% of all leukocytes in the human body and serve multiple roles in immune function. Such roles include:  replenishing resident [[macrophage]]s under normal conditions; migration within approximately 8\u201312 hours in response to [[inflammation]] signals from sites of infection in the tissues; and [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]] into macrophages or [[dendritic cell]]s to effect an immune response.

They are cells that possess a large smooth nucleus, a large area of cytoplasm, and many internal [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] for processing foreign material.\n\n=== Dendritic cells ===\n''In vitro'', monocytes can differentiate into [[dendritic cells]] by adding the cytokines [[granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor]] (GM-CSF) and [[interleukin 4]].<ref name=\"sallusto\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sallusto F, Cella M, Danieli C, Lanzavecchia A |title=Dendritic cells use macropinocytosis and the mannose receptor to concentrate macromolecules in the major histocompatibility complex class II compartment: downregulation by cytokines and bacterial products |journal=J.

These are [[phagocytosis]], antigen presentation, and cytokine production.  Phagocytosis is the process of uptake of microbes and particles followed by digestion and destruction of this material.  Monocytes can perform phagocytosis using intermediary ([[opsonization|opsonising]]) proteins such as [[antibody|antibodies]] or [[complement system|complement]] that coat the pathogen, as well as by binding to the microbe directly via pattern-recognition receptors that recognize pathogens. Monocytes are also capable of killing infected host cells via [[antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity]]. [[Vacuolization]] may be present in a cell that has recently phagocytized foreign matter.\n\nMany factors produced by other cells can regulate the chemotaxis and other functions of monocytes.  These factors include most particularly [[chemokines]] such as [[monocyte chemotactic protein-1]] (CCL2) and [[CCL7|monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (CCL7)]]; certain [[arachidonic acid]] metabolites such as [[Leukotriene B4]] and members of the [[5-Hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid and 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid]] family of OXE1 receptor agonists (e.g., [[5-HETE]] and 5-oxo-ETE); and [[N-Formylmethionine leucyl-phenylalanine]] and other N-formylated oligopeptides which are made by bacteria and activate the [[formyl peptide receptor 1]].<ref>{{Cite journal\n | pmid = 8906847\n| year = 1996\n| last1 = Sozzani\n| first1 = S\n| title = Stimulating properties of 5-oxo-eicosanoids for human monocytes: Synergism with monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and -3\n| journal = Journal of Immunology\n| volume = 157\n| issue = 10\n| pages = 4664\u201371\n| last2 = Zhou\n| first2 = D\n| last3 = Locati\n| first3 = M\n| last4 = Bernasconi\n| first4 = S\n| last5 = Luini\n| first5 = W\n| last6 = Mantovani\n| first6 = A\n| last7 = O'Flaherty\n| first7 = J.

The fragments can be incorporated into MHC molecules and then trafficked to the cell surface of monocytes (and macrophages and dendritic cells). This process is called [[antigen presentation]] and it leads to activation of [[T lymphocyte]]s, which then mount a specific immune response against the antigen.\n\nOther microbial products can directly activate monocytes and this leads to production of pro-inflammatory and, with some delay, of anti-inflammatory [[cytokine]]s. Typical cytokines produced by monocytes are [[tumor necrosis factor|TNF]], [[interleukin-1|IL-1]], and [[interleukin-12|IL-12]].\n\n==Clinical significance==\n[[Image:SEM blood cells.jpg|thumb|right|230px|A [[scanning electron microscope]] (SEM) image of normal circulating human blood.

Containing unilobar nuclei, these cells are one of the types of mononuclear leukocytes which shelter [[azurophil granules]]. The archetypal geometry of the monocyte nucleus is ellipsoidal; metaphorically bean-shaped or kidney-shaped, although the most significant distinction is that the nuclear envelope should not be hyperbolically furcated into lobes.  Contrast to this classification occurs in [[polymorphonuclear leukocyte]]s. Monocytes compose 2% to 10% of all leukocytes in the human body and serve multiple roles in immune function. Such roles include:  replenishing resident [[macrophage]]s under normal conditions; migration within approximately 8\u201312 hours in response to [[inflammation]] signals from sites of infection in the tissues; and [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]] into macrophages or [[dendritic cell]]s to effect an immune response.

They are cells that possess a large smooth nucleus, a large area of cytoplasm, and many internal [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] for processing foreign material.\n\n=== Dendritic cells ===\n''In vitro'', monocytes can differentiate into [[dendritic cells]] by adding the cytokines [[granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor]] (GM-CSF) and [[interleukin 4]].<ref name=\"sallusto\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sallusto F, Cella M, Danieli C, Lanzavecchia A |title=Dendritic cells use macropinocytosis and the mannose receptor to concentrate macromolecules in the major histocompatibility complex class II compartment: downregulation by cytokines and bacterial products |journal=J.

These are [[phagocytosis]], antigen presentation, and cytokine production.  Phagocytosis is the process of uptake of microbes and particles followed by digestion and destruction of this material.  Monocytes can perform phagocytosis using intermediary ([[opsonization|opsonising]]) proteins such as [[antibody|antibodies]] or [[complement system|complement]] that coat the pathogen, as well as by binding to the microbe directly via pattern-recognition receptors that recognize pathogens. Monocytes are also capable of killing infected host cells via [[antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity]]. [[Vacuolization]] may be present in a cell that has recently phagocytized foreign matter.\n\nMany factors produced by other cells can regulate the chemotaxis and other functions of monocytes.  These factors include most particularly [[chemokines]] such as [[monocyte chemotactic protein-1]] (CCL2) and [[CCL7|monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (CCL7)]]; certain [[arachidonic acid]] metabolites such as [[Leukotriene B4]] and members of the [[5-Hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid and 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid]] family of OXE1 receptor agonists (e.g., [[5-HETE]] and 5-oxo-ETE); and [[N-Formylmethionine leucyl-phenylalanine]] and other N-formylated oligopeptides which are made by bacteria and activate the [[formyl peptide receptor 1]].<ref>{{Cite journal\n | pmid = 8906847\n| year = 1996\n| last1 = Sozzani\n| first1 = S\n| title = Stimulating properties of 5-oxo-eicosanoids for human monocytes: Synergism with monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and -3\n| journal = Journal of Immunology\n| volume = 157\n| issue = 10\n| pages = 4664\u201371\n| last2 = Zhou\n| first2 = D\n| last3 = Locati\n| first3 = M\n| last4 = Bernasconi\n| first4 = S\n| last5 = Luini\n| first5 = W\n| last6 = Mantovani\n| first6 = A\n| last7 = O'Flaherty\n| first7 = J.

The fragments can be incorporated into MHC molecules and then trafficked to the cell surface of monocytes (and macrophages and dendritic cells). This process is called [[antigen presentation]] and it leads to activation of [[T lymphocyte]]s, which then mount a specific immune response against the antigen.\n\nOther microbial products can directly activate monocytes and this leads to production of pro-inflammatory and, with some delay, of anti-inflammatory [[cytokine]]s. Typical cytokines produced by monocytes are [[tumor necrosis factor|TNF]], [[interleukin-1|IL-1]], and [[interleukin-12|IL-12]].\n\n==Clinical significance==\n[[Image:SEM blood cells.jpg|thumb|right|230px|A [[scanning electron microscope]] (SEM) image of normal circulating human blood.
