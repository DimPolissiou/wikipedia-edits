S. Lewis]]. She is sometimes called briefly the ''Green Lady'' (on analogy with [[White Witch|Jadis]], the ''White Lady''), and she is known also as the ''Emerald Witch''; neither name, however, appears in Lewis's text. She enslaved Prince [[Rilian]] of [[Narnia]] and a horde of gnomes by her witchcraft, and planned to use them to take over Narnia. She is foiled by three friends of [[Aslan]]: [[Eustace Scrubb]], [[Jill Pole]], and [[Puddleglum]].\n\n== Overview==\nThe Green Lady has kidnapped Prince Rilian, son of King [[Prince Caspian (character)|Caspian X]], and has fatally poisoned his mother, [[Ramandu's Daughter|Ramandu's daughter]].  The Lady plans to conquer Narnia from underground, using the enslaved prince as her general.\n\nShe understands that Eustace, Jill, and Puddleglum have been sent to rescue Rilian, and meets them as they head north from Narnia.  She slyly directs them to the giants' castle Harfang for the Autumn Feast, and bids them explain that she salutes the giants by them; for she knows that \"man-pies\" are a traditional dish for this feast and that this is an easy way to get rid of her adversaries.\n\nWhen the three unexpectedly turn up instead in her own domain, she attempts to dull their senses and critical thinking through hypnotic magic.  She very nearly convinces them that neither Narnia nor the Earth truly exist, but Puddleglum successfully counters the illusion.\n\nShe finally uses her [[shapeshifting]] skill to transform into a gigantic green [[Snake|serpent]], but the Prince recognizes her serpent form as the same one that killed his mother ten years earlier, and after a brief struggle, he strikes off her head.\n\n== The Green Lady and the White Witch ==\nThe story never makes clear who the Green Lady really is or where she comes from. ''The Silver Chair'' includes her among several \"Northern Witches\", a group that evidently also includes Jadis, the [[White Witch]]. Some readers believe that Jadis and the Lady of The Green Kirtle are the same person. Jadis, however, is slain by Aslan centuries earlier in ''[[The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe]]'', and Lewis never describes her being brought back to life. \n\nThe speculation is probably reinforced by the set of character sketches included in some later editions of the books. One sketch describes Jadis as \"completely evil, even in ''The Silver Chair''.\" Since it is the Lady of the Green Kirtle who appears in ''The Silver Chair'', some conclude that this must refer to the Green Lady. The character sketches, however, are recent additions to the books; they were not written by Lewis, and, in this regard, are not supported by Lewis's text. Lewis scholar Peter Schakel even writes that the character sketch \"states incorrectly that the Queen of Underland is an embodiment of Jadis\".<ref>Schakel, p. 146.</ref>\n\nThe mechanics of how Jadis could return are never made clear, since she is killed at the end of ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', her last chronological appearance in the books. In ''[[Prince Caspian]]'', [[Nikabrik]] and his companions suggest that the White Witch could be ''resurrected''{{spaced en dash}}\"who ever heard of a witch that really died?\" In Lewis's text this plan is never put to the test, though the [[The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian|Walden Media film adaptation]] introduces a ritual that begins to pull Jadis back to life before the spell is broken.  ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'' was written as a prequel to the Narnia series, and relates that Jadis gained immortality by eating a magic apple; but except for the LeFay fragment, this book was written after ''Prince Caspian'' was finished.<ref>Ford, p. 464</ref>. While it is possible that Lewis meant this to give a route to reincarnating Jadis, the text never follows up on it.<ref>Ford, p. 456.</ref>\n\n== Literary inspirations ==\n\nCarina Rumberger-Yanda suggests that the Lady of the Green Kirtle may be associated with the eponymous character of [[John Keats]]'s ''[[Lamia (poem)|Lamia]]''.<ref>Carina Rumberger-Yanda, \"[http://www.cslewis.org/journal/?p=22&page=2 Nothing Yet in Its True Form: Shifting Portrayals of Female Villains in C.

He began writing it in the summer of 1974, after his [[Bob Dylan and The Band 1974 Tour|comeback tour]] with [[The Band]]. Dylan recorded the song in September&nbsp;1974 and re-recorded it in December&nbsp;1974 along with some other from ''Blood on the Tracks''. Between the recordings, he often reworked the lyrics. A live version of the song was released on Dylan's 1976 album ''[[Hard Rain (Bob Dylan album)|Hard Rain]]'', and all of the studio outtakes from the September sessions were released on the deluxe edition of ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 14: More Blood, More Tracks]]'' in 2018. Some reviewers have speculated that the song is a reflection on Dylan's personal life, and in particular on his deteriorating relationship with his wife [[Sara Dylan]], whilst Dylan has denied that it is autobiographical.\n\n== Background and recording ==\nThe song was written, or at least begun, in the summer of 1974, after Dylan's [[Bob Dylan and The Band 1974 Tour|comeback tour]] with [[The Band]] that year and a separation from [[Sara Dylan]], who he had married in 1965. Dylan had moved to a farm in Minnesota with his brother, David Zimmerman, and there started to write the songs that were recorded for his album ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]''.<ref name=\"UNCUT\">{{cite web |url=https://www.uncut.co.uk/features/shelter-from-the-storm-the-inside-story-of-bob-dylan-s-blood-on-the-tracks-15656/ |title=Shelter From The Storm \u2013 the inside story of Bob Dylan's Blood on the Tracks |last=Hasted |first=Nick |date=15 November 2013 | orig-year=2005 | work=Uncut |access-date=6 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180715011356/https://www.uncut.co.uk/features/shelter-from-the-storm-the-inside-story-of-bob-dylan-s-blood-on-the-tracks-15656 |archive-date=15 July 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1974, Dylan had taken art classes at [[Carnegie Hall]] and was influenced by his tutor [[Norman Raeben]].<ref name=\"UNCUT\" /><ref name=\"Rogovoy2009\">{{cite book|author=Seth Rogovoy|title=Bob Dylan: Prophet, Mystic, Poet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IdbgeObYgIkC&pg=PA160|date=24 November 2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4165-5983-2}}</ref>{{rp|160}} and, in particular, Raeben's view of [[time]].<ref name=\"GillOdegard2004\">{{cite book|author1=Andy Gill|author2=Kevin Odegard|title=A Simple Twist of Fate: Bob Dylan and the Making of Blood on the Tracks|url=https://archive.org/details/simpletwistoffat00gill|url-access=registration|date=January 2004|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0-306-81231-6|page=148}}</ref> Dylan was later to say that \"Idiot Wind\" was \"a song I wanted to make as a painting\".<ref name=\"Flanagan2010\">{{cite book|author=Bill Flanagan|title=Written in My Soul: Conversations with Rock's Great Songwriters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BUAqAAAAQBAJ|date=1 April 2010|publisher=RosettaBooks|isbn=978-0-7953-1081-2|access-date=6 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506011534/https://books.google.com/books?id=BUAqAAAAQBAJ|archive-date=6 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> \"Idiot Wind\" was a derogatory phrase employed by Raeben and this may have inspired Dylan's use of it, although the term also appears in the poem ''June&nbsp;1940'' by [[Weldon Kees]] and that may have been the reference point.<ref name=\"Wilentz2011\">{{cite book|author=Sean Wilentz|title=Bob Dylan in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sb5UygkZlH0C&pg=PA140|date=15 February 2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4070-7411-5|}}{{rp|140-141}}</ref>\n\nDylan first recorded \"Idiot Wind\" in New York City on 16&nbsp;September 1974 during the initial ''Blood on the Tracks'' sessions at [[A & R Recording|A&R Studios]].

He began writing it in the summer of 1974, after his [[Bob Dylan and The Band 1974 Tour|comeback tour]] with [[The Band]]. Dylan recorded the song in September&nbsp;1974 and re-recorded it in December&nbsp;1974 along with some other from ''Blood on the Tracks''. Between the recordings, he often reworked the lyrics. A live version of the song was released on Dylan's 1976 album ''[[Hard Rain (Bob Dylan album)|Hard Rain]]'', and all of the studio outtakes from the September sessions were released on the deluxe edition of ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 14: More Blood, More Tracks]]'' in 2018. Some reviewers have speculated that the song is a reflection on Dylan's personal life, and in particular on his deteriorating relationship with his wife [[Sara Dylan]], whilst Dylan has denied that it is autobiographical.\n\n== Background and recording ==\nThe song was written, or at least begun, in the summer of 1974, after Dylan's [[Bob Dylan and The Band 1974 Tour|comeback tour]] with [[The Band]] that year and a separation from [[Sara Dylan]], who he had married in 1965. Dylan had moved to a farm in Minnesota with his brother, David Zimmerman, and there started to write the songs that were recorded for his album ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]''.<ref name=\"UNCUT\">{{cite web |url=https://www.uncut.co.uk/features/shelter-from-the-storm-the-inside-story-of-bob-dylan-s-blood-on-the-tracks-15656/ |title=Shelter From The Storm \u2013 the inside story of Bob Dylan's Blood on the Tracks |last=Hasted |first=Nick |date=15 November 2013 | orig-year=2005 | work=Uncut |access-date=6 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180715011356/https://www.uncut.co.uk/features/shelter-from-the-storm-the-inside-story-of-bob-dylan-s-blood-on-the-tracks-15656 |archive-date=15 July 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1974, Dylan had taken art classes at [[Carnegie Hall]] and was influenced by his tutor [[Norman Raeben]].<ref name=\"UNCUT\" /><ref name=\"Rogovoy2009\">{{cite book|author=Seth Rogovoy|title=Bob Dylan: Prophet, Mystic, Poet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IdbgeObYgIkC&pg=PA160|date=24 November 2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4165-5983-2}}</ref>{{rp|160}} and, in particular, Raeben's view of [[time]].<ref name=\"GillOdegard2004\">{{cite book|author1=Andy Gill|author2=Kevin Odegard|title=A Simple Twist of Fate: Bob Dylan and the Making of Blood on the Tracks|url=https://archive.org/details/simpletwistoffat00gill|url-access=registration|date=January 2004|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0-306-81231-6|page=148}}</ref> Dylan was later to say that \"Idiot Wind\" was \"a song I wanted to make as a painting\".<ref name=\"Flanagan2010\">{{cite book|author=Bill Flanagan|title=Written in My Soul: Conversations with Rock's Great Songwriters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BUAqAAAAQBAJ|date=1 April 2010|publisher=RosettaBooks|isbn=978-0-7953-1081-2|access-date=6 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506011534/https://books.google.com/books?id=BUAqAAAAQBAJ|archive-date=6 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> \"Idiot Wind\" was a derogatory phrase employed by Raeben and this may have inspired Dylan's use of it, although the term also appears in the poem ''June&nbsp;1940'' by [[Weldon Kees]] and that may have been the reference point.<ref name=\"Wilentz2011\">{{cite book|author=Sean Wilentz|title=Bob Dylan in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sb5UygkZlH0C&pg=PA140|date=15 February 2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4070-7411-5|}}{{rp|140-141}}</ref>\n\nDylan first recorded \"Idiot Wind\" in New York City on 16&nbsp;September 1974 during the initial ''Blood on the Tracks'' sessions at [[A & R Recording|A&R Studios]].

The Town of Port Washington was formed in January 1846 and until 1847 included the surrounding areas and what is currently [[Fredonia (town), Wisconsin|Fredonia]], [[Saukville (town), Wisconsin|Saukville]], and [[Belgium (town), Wisconsin|Belgium]].<ref>Price, p. 20</ref> At the time, the land was part of [[Washington County, Wisconsin|Washington County]], and in the late 1840s, Port Washington was a candidate for the county seat. However, the community was far from the county's other early settlements, including [[Mequon, Wisconsin|Mequon]], [[Grafton (town), Wisconsin|Grafton]] and [[Germantown, Wisconsin|Germantown]]. In 1850, the Wisconsin legislature voted to bisected Washington County into northern and southern counties, with Port Washington as the northern seat and [[Cedarburg, Wisconsin|Cedarburg]] as the southern. County residents failed to ratify the bill, and in 1853 the legislature instead bisected the county into eastern and western sections, creating Ozaukee County.

The Town of Port Washington was formed in January 1846 and until 1847 included the surrounding areas and what is currently [[Fredonia (town), Wisconsin|Fredonia]], [[Saukville (town), Wisconsin|Saukville]], and [[Belgium (town), Wisconsin|Belgium]].<ref>Price, p. 20</ref> At the time, the land was part of [[Washington County, Wisconsin|Washington County]], and in the late 1840s, Port Washington was a candidate for the county seat. However, the community was far from the county's other early settlements, including [[Mequon, Wisconsin|Mequon]], [[Grafton (town), Wisconsin|Grafton]] and [[Germantown, Wisconsin|Germantown]]. In 1850, the Wisconsin legislature voted to bisected Washington County into northern and southern counties, with Port Washington as the northern seat and [[Cedarburg, Wisconsin|Cedarburg]] as the southern. County residents failed to ratify the bill, and in 1853 the legislature instead bisected the county into eastern and western sections, creating Ozaukee County. Port Washington became the seat of the new county, and the Washington County seat moved to [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://genealogytrails.com/wis/washington/history_westbend.htm|title=Washington County Wisconsin Town History|publisher=Wisconsin Genealogy Trails|accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref> The bisection was controversial.

The material is then shaped via a continuous extrusion process \u2013 producing a single sausage casing of indefinite length \u2013 which is then cut into desired lengths, usually while the extrusion process continues.\n\n==Natural casings==\n\n'''Origin'''\n\nNatural sausage casings are made from the [[Submucosa|sub-mucosa]] of the small intestine, a layer of the [[intestine]] that consists mainly of naturally occurring collagen. In Western European cuisine and Chinese cuisine, most casings come from pigs, but elsewhere the intestines of sheep, goats, cattle and sometimes horses are also used. To prepare the intestines as casings, they are flushed, scraped and cleaned with water and salt by hand or with machinery; today they are primarily machine cleaned. The outer fat and the inner mucosa lining are removed during processing. They are salted to lower the water activity (which inhibits microbial growth) and preserve the casing. Natural casings have been used in the production of meat specialties for centuries and have remained virtually unchanged in function, appearance, and composition. US and EU [[organic food]] regulations only allow natural casings, they can be derived from non organically raised animals as there are no large scale slaughter plants which handle and process only organic animals and sell their casings as certified organic casings. As a result all large scale natural casing companies buy casings from around the world and send them to their selection facilities to be graded and packaged. There are three primary animal species which are used to manufacture natural casings (although all [[Mammal|mammals]] raised for [[meat]] could potentially be used to produce natural casing): [[Cattle|cows]], [[Pig|pigs]], and [[lamb and mutton|lambs]] and [[sheep]]. \n\n'''Appearance'''\n\nNatural casing sausages are distinguishable from collagen or cellulose casings because of their irregularity, although high quality sheep and lamb casings can be almost indistinguishable from a collagen casing as they have no noticeable imperfections. The main difference is in the way they are twisted and linked which impacts the appearance of the final product and makes it easy to differentiate a hot dog using natural sheep or lamb casing vs collagen casing. The size and usage of natural casings are impacted by the animal they are derived from, the narrowest being [[lamb and mutton|lamb]] followed by [[sheep]] followed by [[Pig|hog]] followed by [[Beef cattle|beef]]. The size range for lamb is 14 mm to 28 mm in diameter (which is how casings are graded), the size range for sheep is 16 mm to 32 mm in diameter, the size range for hog is 28 mm to 58 mm in diameter, the size range for beef is 43 mm to 65 mm, although beef bung caps (which are not derived from the small intestine) have a size range of 115 mm to 130 mm. \n\n'''Processing'''\n\nThe process begins at the slaughter plant where \"green\" (uncleaned) runners (ungraded casings) are removed from the animal during the slaughter process and they are subsequently cleaned, which involves breaking the inner mucosa usually with a machine that they go through and rollers break the inner mucosa so it can be flushed out and removed. The cleaning process can also be done by hand but primarily casings are machine cleaned. This is a very water intensive process as the casings are vigorously flushed with cold water to remove blood from the mucosa which if not properly flushed during the initial processing can lead to \"staining\" of the casing where it becomes pink. The cleaned runners are then tied in bundles and packed in plastic drums and filled with a saturated salt brine for preservation. The runners are then sold to the company which processes natural casings by grading and packaging them to create finished units called hanks.\n\nNatural casings are produced and sold almost exclusively by the hank which is a unit of measure that is 90 meters long. A hank can consist of a varying number of strands (individual pieces of casing) which vary in length from 2 meters (which is the shortest length sold for commercial use) to as long as 28 meters. Each casing manufacturer has various \"put ups\" which dictate the maximum number of strands and the minimum length of each strand allowed in the put up. Casings are selected for size which is measured in millimeters and refers to the diameter of the casing, this is done exclusively by hand and is primarily done in China due to the availability of low cost labor. Commercially casings are available in various forms of packaging which are suited to different applications. Sheep/lamb and hog are available in all packaging types due to the high demand and long length of pieces, due to the shorter length and much lower demand for beef casings they are primarily only available loose or in net packs either salted or in brine. \n\n'''Packaging'''\n\nSheep and lamb and hog casings are available \"tubed\" where each strand is put on a plastic tube which allows the sausage maker to easily place the casing on the stuffing horn, in recent years these tubes have been modified so they break open along a seam and the operator can pull them out at the back of the horn allowing greater efficiency; these are referred to in the industry as \"zip tubes\", due to the zipper like nature of the seam. These tubed casings are then packed in plastic nets usually 2 per net and packed in plastic drums which are then filled with a [[Saturated solution|saturated]] salt [[brine]], usually 200 per drum. These are available in all diameters and in lengths greater than 3 meters (as 2 meter or shorter pieces are cost prohibitive to tube).\n\nSheep and lamb and hog are also available loose in brine in a vacuum sealed plastic pack, commonly referred to as \"vacuum packs\", these are primarily used by small to medium sized sausage makers who use less than 100 hanks per month of casing. The appeal of vacuum packs is the ease of use, their shorter strand length for hand stuffing (all sausage makers who don't use automatic sausage stuffing and linking machines) and their shelf life, they only need to be opened as needed so the sausage maker doesn't need to worry that they won't use their opened casings prior to a decrease in quality. These are available in all diameters and in put ups from short up to medium length, about 6 meter minimum, with a maximum length of about 14 meters.\n\nSheep and lamb and hog are also available in a net, commonly referred to as net pack, these are available salted or in brine and they are primarily used by medium to large sausage makers who do not want to pay the additional cost for the tubed casing and don't have automatic sausage stuffing and linking machines (which require tubed casings to operate efficiently). These are available in all diameters and in lengths greater than 2 meters (as that is the shortest length sold for commercial use).\n\nBeef casings are primarily available only salted or in brine, they are measured in sets not hanks and the length is 32 meters, this is for beef \"rounds\" and \"middles\" only, beef bung caps are only about 1 meter in length.\n\n==Artificial casings==\n\nArtificial casings are made of collagen (often derived from cattle skin), cellulose, or plastic. Artificial casings from animal collagen are generally edible, though some are not.\n\n===Collagen casings===\n[[file:Beretta Salami and Collagen Casing .jpg|right|150px|thumb|A salami and the collagen casing (below) it came in]]\nCollagen casings are mainly produced from the collagen in beef or pig hides, and the bones and tendons. It can also be derived from poultry and fish. They have been made for more than 50 years and their share of the market has been increasing<ref>https://www.lemproducts.com/understanding_collagen_casings</ref><ref>http://askthemeatman.com/what_are_collagen_casings.htm</ref>. Usually the cost to produce sausages in collagen is significantly lower than making sausages in gut because of higher production speeds and lower labor requirements.\n\nThe collagen for artificial casings is processed extensively. It is formed by [[Food extrusion|extrusion]] through a die to the desired diameter, dried and [[shirring (sausage)|shirred]] into short sticks up to {{convert|41|cm|abbr=on}} long that contain as much as {{convert|50|m|abbr=on}} of casing. In a newer process, a form of dough is coextruded with the meat blend, and a coating is formed by treating the outside with a calcium solution to set the coating.\n\nThe latest generation of collagen casings are usually more tender than natural casings but do not exhibit the \"snap\" or \"bite\" of natural casing sausages. Most collagen casings are edible, but a special form of thicker collagen casings is used for [[salami]]s and large caliber sausages where the casing is usually peeled off the sausage by the consumer. Collagen casings are less expensive to use, give better weight and size control, and are easier to run when compared to natural casings.\n\n===Cellulose casings===\n\nCellulose, usually from cotton linters or wood pulp, is processed to make [[viscose]], which is then extruded into clear, tough casings for making [[Hot dog|wieners]] and franks. They also are shirred for easier use and can be treated with dye to make \"red hots\". The casing is peeled off after cooking, resulting in \"skinless\" franks. Cellulosic viscose solutions are combined with wood or for example [[abaca]] pulp to make large diameter fibrous casings for bologna, cotto salami, smoked ham and other products sliced for sandwiches. This type is also permeable to smoke and water vapor. They can be flat or shirred, depending on application, and can be pretreated with smoke, caramel color, or other surface treatments.\n\n===Plastic casings===\n\nPlastic casings are not eaten. They also can be flat or shirred. Generally, smoke and water can not pass through the casing, so plastic is used for non-smoked products where high yields are expected. The inner surface can be [[laminated]] or co-extruded with a polymer with an affinity for meat protein causing the meat to stick to the film, resulting in some loss when the casing is peeled, but higher overall yield due to better moisture control.\n\nPlastic casings are generally made from polymers such as [[polyamide]], [[polypropylene]], or [[Polyethylene|polyethylene]]. [[Polyamide]] (Nylon) plastic casings are the most commonly used in production of cooked sausages and hams such as luncheon meat and bologna. Polyamide casings come in two main varieties: Oriented and non-oriented. The oriented polyamide<ref>{{Citation|last=Vicik|first=Stephen James|title=A heat shrinkable polyamide sausage casing with a polyolefin core layer|date=Dec 11, 2002|url=http://www.google.com/patents/EP0589436B2|accessdate=2016-11-10}}</ref> are shrinkable casings and will shrink during the cooking process thereby reducing the water loss. Non-oriented polyamide casings remain the same diameter during the cooking process and thereby allow for expansion of the meat during cooking. The use of polyamide casings has expanded recently with the advent of various varieties and structures of casings such as multilayer casings.<ref>{{US patent|4243074}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archpatent.com/patents/4243074 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313131522/http://archpatent.com/patents/4243074 |archivedate=2016-03-13 }}</ref>\n\n=== Vegetarian casings ===\nSome innovative coextrusion processes have been developed in recent years, allowing 100% plant-based vegetarian casings to be created.

The outer fat and the inner mucosa lining are removed during processing. They are salted to lower the water activity (which inhibits microbial growth) and preserve the casing. Natural casings have been used in the production of meat specialties for centuries and have remained virtually unchanged in function, appearance, and composition. US and EU [[organic food]] regulations only allow natural casings, they can be derived from non organically raised animals as there are no large scale slaughter plants which handle and process only organic animals and sell their casings as certified organic casings. As a result all large scale natural casing companies buy casings from around the world and send them to their selection facilities to be graded and packaged. There are three primary animal species which are used to manufacture natural casings (although all [[Mammal|mammals]] raised for [[meat]] could potentially be used to produce natural casing): [[Cattle|cows]], [[Pig|pigs]], and [[lamb and mutton|lambs]] and [[sheep]]. \n\n'''Appearance'''\n\nNatural casing sausages are distinguishable from collagen or cellulose casings because of their irregularity, although high quality sheep and lamb casings can be almost indistinguishable from a collagen casing as they have no noticeable imperfections. The main difference is in the way they are twisted and linked which impacts the appearance of the final product and makes it easy to differentiate a hot dog using natural sheep or lamb casing vs collagen casing. The size and usage of natural casings are impacted by the animal they are derived from, the narrowest being [[lamb and mutton|lamb]] followed by [[sheep]] followed by [[Pig|hog]] followed by [[Beef cattle|beef]]. The size range for lamb is 14 mm to 28 mm in diameter (which is how casings are graded), the size range for sheep is 16 mm to 32 mm in diameter, the size range for hog is 28 mm to 58 mm in diameter, the size range for beef is 43 mm to 65 mm, although beef bung caps (which are not derived from the small intestine) have a size range of 115 mm to 130 mm. \n\n'''Processing'''\n\nThe process begins at the slaughter plant where \"green\" (uncleaned) runners (ungraded casings) are removed from the animal during the slaughter process and they are subsequently cleaned, which involves breaking the inner mucosa usually with a machine that they go through and rollers break the inner mucosa so it can be flushed out and removed. The cleaning process can also be done by hand but primarily casings are machine cleaned. This is a very water intensive process as the casings are vigorously flushed with cold water to remove blood from the mucosa which if not properly flushed during the initial processing can lead to \"staining\" of the casing where it becomes pink. The cleaned runners are then tied in bundles and packed in plastic drums and filled with a saturated salt brine for preservation. The runners are then sold to the company which processes natural casings by grading and packaging them to create finished units called hanks.\n\nNatural casings are produced and sold almost exclusively by the hank which is a unit of measure that is 90 meters long. A hank can consist of a varying number of strands (individual pieces of casing) which vary in length from 2 meters (which is the shortest length sold for commercial use) to as long as 28 meters. Each casing manufacturer has various \"put ups\" which dictate the maximum number of strands and the minimum length of each strand allowed in the put up. Casings are selected for size which is measured in millimeters and refers to the diameter of the casing, this is done exclusively by hand and is primarily done in China due to the availability of low cost labor. Commercially casings are available in various forms of packaging which are suited to different applications. Sheep/lamb and hog are available in all packaging types due to the high demand and long length of pieces, due to the shorter length and much lower demand for beef casings they are primarily only available loose or in net packs either salted or in brine. \n\n'''Packaging'''\n\nSheep and lamb and hog casings are available \"tubed\" where each strand is put on a plastic tube which allows the sausage maker to easily place the casing on the stuffing horn, in recent years these tubes have been modified so they break open along a seam and the operator can pull them out at the back of the horn allowing greater efficiency; these are referred to in the industry as \"zip tubes\", due to the zipper like nature of the seam. These tubed casings are then packed in plastic nets usually 2 per net and packed in plastic drums which are then filled with a [[Saturated solution|saturated]] salt [[brine]], usually 200 per drum. These are available in all diameters and in lengths greater than 3 meters (as 2 meter or shorter pieces are cost prohibitive to tube).\n\nSheep and lamb and hog are also available loose in brine in a vacuum sealed plastic pack, commonly referred to as \"vacuum packs\", these are primarily used by small to medium sized sausage makers who use less than 100 hanks per month of casing. The appeal of vacuum packs is the ease of use, their shorter strand length for hand stuffing (all sausage makers who don't use automatic sausage stuffing and linking machines) and their shelf life, they only need to be opened as needed so the sausage maker doesn't need to worry that they won't use their opened casings prior to a decrease in quality. These are available in all diameters and in put ups from short up to medium length, about 6 meter minimum, with a maximum length of about 14 meters.\n\nSheep and lamb and hog are also available in a net, commonly referred to as net pack, these are available salted or in brine and they are primarily used by medium to large sausage makers who do not want to pay the additional cost for the tubed casing and don't have automatic sausage stuffing and linking machines (which require tubed casings to operate efficiently). These are available in all diameters and in lengths greater than 2 meters (as that is the shortest length sold for commercial use).\n\nBeef casings are primarily available only salted or in brine, they are measured in sets not hanks and the length is 32 meters, this is for beef \"rounds\" and \"middles\" only, beef bung caps are only about 1 meter in length.\n\n==Artificial casings==\n\nArtificial casings are made of collagen (often derived from cattle skin), cellulose, or plastic. Artificial casings from animal collagen are generally edible, though some are not.\n\n===Collagen casings===\n[[file:Beretta Salami and Collagen Casing .jpg|right|150px|thumb|A salami and the collagen casing (below) it came in]]\nCollagen casings are mainly produced from the collagen in beef or pig hides, and the bones and tendons. It can also be derived from poultry and fish. They have been made for more than 50 years and their share of the market has been increasing<ref>https://www.lemproducts.com/understanding_collagen_casings</ref><ref>http://askthemeatman.com/what_are_collagen_casings.htm</ref>. Usually the cost to produce sausages in collagen is significantly lower than making sausages in gut because of higher production speeds and lower labor requirements.\n\nThe collagen for artificial casings is processed extensively. It is formed by [[Food extrusion|extrusion]] through a die to the desired diameter, dried and [[shirring (sausage)|shirred]] into short sticks up to {{convert|41|cm|abbr=on}} long that contain as much as {{convert|50|m|abbr=on}} of casing. In a newer process, a form of dough is coextruded with the meat blend, and a coating is formed by treating the outside with a calcium solution to set the coating.\n\nThe latest generation of collagen casings are usually more tender than natural casings but do not exhibit the \"snap\" or \"bite\" of natural casing sausages. Most collagen casings are edible, but a special form of thicker collagen casings is used for [[salami]]s and large caliber sausages where the casing is usually peeled off the sausage by the consumer. Collagen casings are less expensive to use, give better weight and size control, and are easier to run when compared to natural casings.\n\n===Cellulose casings===\n\nCellulose, usually from cotton linters or wood pulp, is processed to make [[viscose]], which is then extruded into clear, tough casings for making [[Hot dog|wieners]] and franks. They also are shirred for easier use and can be treated with dye to make \"red hots\". The casing is peeled off after cooking, resulting in \"skinless\" franks. Cellulosic viscose solutions are combined with wood or for example [[abaca]] pulp to make large diameter fibrous casings for bologna, cotto salami, smoked ham and other products sliced for sandwiches. This type is also permeable to smoke and water vapor. They can be flat or shirred, depending on application, and can be pretreated with smoke, caramel color, or other surface treatments.\n\n===Plastic casings===\n\nPlastic casings are not eaten. They also can be flat or shirred. Generally, smoke and water can not pass through the casing, so plastic is used for non-smoked products where high yields are expected. The inner surface can be [[laminated]] or co-extruded with a polymer with an affinity for meat protein causing the meat to stick to the film, resulting in some loss when the casing is peeled, but higher overall yield due to better moisture control.\n\nPlastic casings are generally made from polymers such as [[polyamide]], [[polypropylene]], or [[Polyethylene|polyethylene]]. [[Polyamide]] (Nylon) plastic casings are the most commonly used in production of cooked sausages and hams such as luncheon meat and bologna. Polyamide casings come in two main varieties: Oriented and non-oriented. The oriented polyamide<ref>{{Citation|last=Vicik|first=Stephen James|title=A heat shrinkable polyamide sausage casing with a polyolefin core layer|date=Dec 11, 2002|url=http://www.google.com/patents/EP0589436B2|accessdate=2016-11-10}}</ref> are shrinkable casings and will shrink during the cooking process thereby reducing the water loss. Non-oriented polyamide casings remain the same diameter during the cooking process and thereby allow for expansion of the meat during cooking. The use of polyamide casings has expanded recently with the advent of various varieties and structures of casings such as multilayer casings.<ref>{{US patent|4243074}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archpatent.com/patents/4243074 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313131522/http://archpatent.com/patents/4243074 |archivedate=2016-03-13 }}</ref>\n\n=== Vegetarian casings ===\nSome innovative coextrusion processes have been developed in recent years, allowing 100% plant-based vegetarian casings to be created. Some special alginate coextrusion equipment is required to make casings that can be used in [[Halal#Foods|halal]] or [[kosher]] food making.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{Sausage}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Casing (Sausage)}}\n[[Category:Sausages]]\n[[Category:Meat industry]]\n[[Category:Garde manger]]\n", "name_user": "Derim Hunt", "label": "safe", "comment": "minor ortography errors erased", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sausage_casing"}
