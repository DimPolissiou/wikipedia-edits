From 1939 to 1981, this activity had affected 39% of the area of the current national park. The park also has its own cultural heritage. Its history as an English resort, hunting and fishing with the Murray River fishing Club, also called Club La Roche, a former private fishing club adds to the history of logging and dredging that took place in the park before its creation.<ref>{{cite web|language=|title=Portrait of the park|url=https://www.sepaq.com/pq/grj/decouverte/portrait.dot|website=sepaq.com|date=|access-date=2016-12-04}}</ref>.\n\nGrands-Jardins National Park protects an environment that is highly representative of the natural region of the [[Jacques-Cartier Lake Massif]].<ref name=\"mfpp\">{{cite web|title=Grands Jardins National Park - Minist\u00e8re des Forests, Wildlife and Parks|url=http://mffp.gouv.qc.ca/parcs/reseau-parcs-nationaux/fiches/grands-jardins.jsp|website=mffp.gouv.qc.ca|access-date=2016-12-05}}</ref> The natural environment of the park is dominated by forests and approximately 30% of the park was ravaged by a [[forest fire]] in 1991 then in 1999.

Indeed, dead wood trunks on the ground or standing still have shelters ideal for species of birds, rodents, insects and fungi. A few years later, the forest already begins to regain its rights and slowly resumes its cycle of natural succession.\n\nOn September 13, 2017, the Grands-Jardins National Park was enlarged by {{convert|8.9|km|2}} to reach an area of {{convert|318.9|km|2}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mffp.gouv.qc.ca/parcs/reseau-parcs-nationaux/fiches/grands-jardins.jsp|title=Parc national des Grands-Jardins|website=Minist\u00e8re des Forests, Wildlife and Parks|access-date=September 24, 2017}}.</ref>.\n\n== Geography ==\n=== Topography ===\n[[File:Mont du Lac \u00e0 Mo\u00efse 2018.jpg|thumbnail|[[Mont du Lac \u00e0 Mo\u00efse]]]]\nThe topography of the park is varied due to the mountain ranges that characterize the park. The climatic conditions of the park can easily vary from place to place. The territory is part of the [[Canadian Shield]] and its rock base is mainly composed of granite rocks such as [[igneous rock]]. In addition, part of the territory is composed of anorthosite, a type of igneous rock.\n\n* [[Mont du Lac \u00e0 Mo\u00efse]]\n* [[Mont du Lac des Cygnes]]\n* Mont de l'Ours\n* Mont Jean-Palardy\n* Mont Ren\u00e9-Richard\n* La Chouenne\n\n=== Hydrography ===\n[[File:Lac des Cygnes Quebec.jpg|thumbnail|left|Lac des Cygnes]]\nThe park includes more than 120 bodies of water as well as several mountains that are part of the mountain range of [[Laurentian Mountains]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Portrait - Parc national des Grands-Jardins - Ecological integrity monitoring program - Parcs Qu\u00e9bec - S\u00e9paq|url=http://www.sepaq.com/parcs-quebec/psie/resultats/parc/grj/portrait.dot|website=www.sepaq.com|access-date=2016-12-05}}</ref> The summits of these mountains are protected because of the fragility of the ecosystems present at the summits which are sensitive to the trampling of hikers. These summits are still accessible to hikers by marked and landscaped trails. The water bodies make up 3.6% of the park area and the two most important watersheds are the [[Malbaie River]] and the [[Sainte-Anne-du-Nord River]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Portrait of the park - Parc national des Grands-Jardins - Parcs Qu\u00e9bec - S\u00e9paq|url=https://www.sepaq.com/pq/grj/decouverte/portrait.dot|website=www.sepaq.com|access-date= 2016-12-05}}</ref>\n\n== Fauna ==\nThe park offers a privileged habitat for several animals. Three distinct habitat types can be observed in the park: young forests which were created by natural fires and logging, mature forests composed of black spruce and balsam fir with closed cover and taiga reminiscent of the Great Northern Quebec. Taiga environments similar to that of Grands-Jardins National Park are normally found more than {{convert|500|km}} further north, above the 52th parallel. These different habitats make it possible to shelter a variety of animals, some of which have threatened or vulnerable status. We find in particular populations of [[Alces|moose]], [[reindeer|woodland caribou]], [[bear|black bear]], [[red fox]], [[pig-spicy]], [[common loon]], [[Canada grouse]], [[Wolf (mammal)|wolves]], several [[lynx]] and several other species.\n\nDue to the diversity of habitats found within the national park, several species frequent the latter, including three species that are classified as vulnerable, namely the [[woodland caribou]] of the forest ecotype, the [[Bicknell's thrush]] and [[Barrow's Goldeneye|Barrow's Goldeneye]].<ref name=\"mfpp\"/> These species have the most serious status under the Quebec Act on threatened or vulnerable species. There are also seven species likely to be designated threatened or vulnerable, namely [[arctic char]], [[golden eagle]], [[peregrine falcon]], [[Common nighthawk America|nightjar of America]]<nowiki/>, [[chimney swift]], [[rock vole]], [[cougar]] and [[Cooper vole-lemming]].<ref name=\"mfpp\"/>{{,}}<ref>{{cite article|language=French|author1=Lepage, M.|title=Threatened or vulnerable vertebrate fauna in the boreal forest|periodical=Canadian naturalist|date=Fall 2001, volume 125, number 3|issn =|read online=|pages= 131-137}}</ref> The park is obviously home to several species of mammals, birds, amphibians, fish and insects.\n\n==== Mammals ====\n\nThe mammal category includes as many large mammals as small rodents, moving from moose to bear and porcupine. We thus find the following mammals: several species of shrews (the great shrew, the common shrew, sooty, palustrine and pygmy), the condylure with a star nose, the snowshoe hare, the red squirrel, the large polatouche, the marmot common, Canada beaver, several species of voles (red-backed Gapper, fields, rocks, Cooper's lemming), phenacomys, muskrat, some species of mouse (deer, wood jumping and field jumping ), American porcupine, coyote, gray wolf, red fox, black bear, raccoon, long-tailed weasel, stoat, river otter, woodland caribou, white-tailed deer, moose, American marten, American mink, striped skunk, cougar and Canadian lynx.<ref>{{cite web|language=French|title=List of species - mammals|url=https://www.sepaq.com/dotAsset/27312.pdf|website=sepaq.com|date=|access-date=2016-12-02}}</ref>. This is explained by the varied habitats offered by the vast territory of the Grands-Jardins National Park.\n\n[[File: Snowshoe Hare, Shirleys Bay.jpg|thumbnail|[[Snowshoe hare]].]]\n\nThe [[Snowshoe hare|snowshoe hare]] is one of the most important species in the park (and even in Canada) from an ecological point of view<ref>{{cite web|title=Faune et flora of the country - The snowshoe hare|url=http://www.hww.ca/fr/faune/mammiferes/le-lievre-d-amerique.html|website=www.hww.ca|access-date=2016-12-05}}</ref>, because it represents a food source for a good number of predators which frequent the national park and the boreal forest in general such as the Canada lynx, the red fox and the coyote. In addition, it feeds on several plants and shrubs in the boreal forest.\n\nThe woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) is a mammal very sensitive to the presence of humans. Too large a presence on its territory can disturb the species and modify its behavior and lead it to frequent places less favorable for the species, making the caribou more vulnerable to its predators such as the wolf and the black bear. The territory of the Grands-Jardins Park is an important environment for the calving, rutting and winter feeding of the woodland caribou and plays a decisive role in the conservation of the species.<ref> {{cite article|language=French|author1=Courtois, R., Ouellet, JP, Gingras, A., Dussault, C., Banville D.|title=The situation of forest caribou in Quebec|periodical=The Canadian naturalist|date=Fall 2001 Volume 125 num. ro 3|issn=|read online=|pages=53-63}}</ref> It lives in particular in mature coniferous forests where arboreal lichens are very present.\n\nThe [[black bear]], an omnivorous animal whose diet consists mainly of plants, is [http://www.parcparcours.com/grands-jardins/fiches/ours.html abundant in the national park]. However, it also feeds on fawns that are easy prey for bears when they venture out of the dense forest. The bear prefers open and semi-open sites where the vegetation constituting a good part of its diet is more abundant and rarely ventures into the dense forest of the park.\n\nThe [[Canadian lynx]] (Lynx canadensis) is a wild feline from the boreal forest that lives in varied habitats dominated by mature stand forests. It is one of the three wild felines that live in Canada with the bobcat to which it resembles much and the cougar<ref>{{cite web|title=Fauna and flora of the country - The lynx of Canada|url=http://www.hww.ca/fr/faune/mammiferes/le-lynx-du-canada.html|website=www.hww.ca|access-date=2016-12-05}}</ref>. This carnivore feeds mainly on snowshoe hares that are found in the park. Thus the Grands-Jardins National Park is a suitable habitat for this species. On the other hand, it is a shy and secretive feline since it is rarely observed.\n\nThe [[Cooper's vole-lemming|Cooper's lemming vole]] (Synaptomys cooperi) is a small rodent that frequents wetlands.<ref>DESROSIERS, N., R. MORIN and J. JUTRAS. 2002. [http://www.cdpnq.gouv.qc.ca/pdf/atlas/micromammiferes.pdf Atlas of micromammals of Quebec]. Quebec Wildlife and Parks Society. Wildlife Development Directorate.

The [[common loon]], [[golden eagle]], [[black-backed woodpecker]], [[Barrow's Goldeneye]], [[peregrine falcon]], [[thrush Bicknell]] and [[Canada grouse]] are a small, non-exhaustive list.<ref>{{cite web|language=French|title=List of species - birds|url=https://www.sepaq.com/dotAsset/27314.pdf|website=sepaq.com|date=|access-date=2016-12-02}}</ref>\n\nThe common loon, a skilled diver, lives in fish-rich lakes since it is a great predator of aquatic environments. Its presence indicates good health of the lakes it frequents. The golden eagle, meanwhile, lives in rock walls and open or semi-open environments. The [[Peregrine Falcon]] also lives in the rock faces and open spaces of the national park. The black-backed woodpecker plays an important role in burnt forests since it creates cavities in dead trees in order to feed on the insects that adore this environment. The cavities thus created are then used for several species. The [[Bicknell's Thrush]] which is a forest bird prefers rather dense and regenerating forests as habitat.<ref>{{cite article|language=English|author1=Chisholm SE et Leonard ML|title=Effect of forest management on rare habitat specialist, the Bicknell's Thrush (Catharus bicknelli)|periodical=NRC Canada|date=2008|issn=|read online=|pages=217-223}}</ref>.

Among the amphibians, we find the [[two-line salamander]], [[American toad|American toad]], [[cruciferous tree frog]], [[wood frog]], [[Pelophylax kl. esculentus|green frog]], the [[northern frog]] and finally the [[striped snake]].<ref>{{cite web|language=French|title=List of species - amphibians and reptiles|url=https://www.sepaq.com/dotAsset/27310.pdf|website=sepaq.com|date=|access-date=2016-12-02}}.</ref> Arctic char and [[brook trout]] are two species of fish that frequent the national park.\n\n== Flora ==\n[[File: Kalmia latifolia Clementine Churchill.jpg|thumb|Kalmia latifolia Clementine Churchill]] The park is made up of different habitats due to its diverse topography, going from high mountains to large lakes. This is why we find there forest habitats which dominate the landscape, open habitats, taiga habitats composed mainly of lichens as well as varied aquatic habitats. The park helps protect a site of exceptional character that are cladonia spruces, a sample of taiga which is unique for southern Quebec. This type of habitat is normally found further north in Quebec.<ref name=\"mfpp\"/> These different types of habitats are home to a wide variety of plants from four different categories: heather, lichen, bog and trees.\n\nAbout fifteen species of the heather family are [http://www.parcparcours.com/grands-jardins/fiches/ericacees.html observable in the park]. Their flowering extends from the beginning of June until the end of the summer. One of the most easily observable flowers is probably the narrow-leaved Kalmia (Kalmia augustifolia) which has pink saucer-shaped flowers. The park is also home to [[Labrador tea]] (Rhododendron groenlandicum), a few varieties of [cranberry] (Vaccinium sp.) That produce blueberries and cranberries, the [[Moneses uniflora|pirole with one flower]] (Moneses uniflora), [[Gaultheria|wintergreen]] Hispid (Gaultheria hispidula), [[Glaucous Andromeda]] (Andromeda polifolia var. Glaucophylla) and [[Chamaedaphne calyculata|Caliculated Cassandra]] (Chamaedaphne calyculata). [[File: Boreal Flora.jpg|left|thumbnail|Lichens cladoni|alt=|293x293px]] A second family of plants is very abundant in the park, that of the lichen which is represented in the Parc des Grands-Jardins by 200 different species. Different species colonize different parts of the park. Some lichens are more adapted to the soil while others colonize trees or rock walls. There are different species of crustacean and foliaceous lichens that grow mainly on rocks in the Bear Mountains and Swan Lake. Lichens of the Bryoria and Usnea type are found on mature trees in the boreal forest. Finally, fruticulous lichens of the genus Cladoni grow directly on the ground. Lichens are an important component of the ecosystem since they are the main source of food for certain species, especially for woodland caribou in winter.<ref>{{cite article|language=French|author1=Courtois, R., Ouellet, JP, Gingras, A., Dussault C. and Banville D.|title=The situation of the woodland caribou in Quebec|periodical = The Canadian naturalist|date=autumn 2001 volume 125 number 3|issn=|read online=|pages=53-63}}</ref>\n\nTwo remarkable peat bogs are present on the territory of the national park. These are rare habitats for southern Quebec. The first peatland is the permafrost of Mont de l'ours and the second is the reticulated peatland of Lac Malbaie.\n\nThe trees in the park are mainly [[Black spruce|black spruce]] and [[Balsam fir|balsam fir]] which are similar to the Canadian boreal forest. There are also larches and jack pines. The boreal forest, which is found in the national park, is dominated by conifers which are particularly well adapted to the harsh boreal climate.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fauna and flora of the country - The Canadian boreal forest|url=http://www.hww.ca/fr/espaces-sauvages/la-foret-boreale-canadienne.html|website=www.hww.ca|access-date=2016-12-05}}</ref>.

The second is that of characterizing the emergence of insects on lakes. The third is the restoration of borrow pits abandoned since 2007, led by the team of Line Rochefort of the Faculty of Agriculture and Food Sciences at Laval University. The goal of the project is to accelerate the vegetal restoration of the borrow pits of the park created by the extraction of sand and gravel which have been abandoned for 40 years. The park is also the subject of a project to modify the park boundary<ref>Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks, National Parks Directorate. Undated. ''Information document, Project to modify the boundary of Grands-Jardins National Park''. [pdf] 28 p.</ref> in order to enlarge it and incorporate an interesting area for the conservation of five new peaks, six lakes and the habitat of the woodland caribou<ref name=\"mfpp\"/>. The park team has also been carrying out a monitoring of the loon's nesting since 2007 and invites visitors to share their observations of the bird via observation sheets.\n\nOne of the main goals of the national park is the conservation of the natural environments of the Charlevoix region and the species that inhabit it. The protection of aquatic environments and peaks are major issues for Grands-Jardins National Park. Rigorous monitoring of fishing quotas, identification of spawning grounds and characterization of numerous water bodies allow the park to minimize the pressure on the aquatic ecosystem and promote a favorable environment for the populations of Arctic char and d brook trout that depend on it. Marked trails and awareness of hikers reduce the anthropogenic impact on the fragile ecosystems of mountain peaks.\n\n==References==\n:''This article was initially translated from the French Wikipedia.''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Autres projets|commons=Category:Parc national des Grands-Jardins}}\n* [[Charlevoix Regional County Municipality]]\n* [[Lac-Pikauba, Quebec|Lac-Pikauba]], an unorganized territory\n* [[Malbaie River]]\n* [[Petite rivi\u00e8re Malbaie]]\n* [[Sainte-Anne River (Beaupr\u00e9)]]\n* [[Rivi\u00e8re du Chemin des Canots]]\n* [[Rivi\u00e8re de l'Enfer]]\n* [[Lac Sainte-Anne du Nord]]\n* [[Malbaie Pond]]\n* [[National Parks of Quebec]]\n* [[National Parks of Canada]]\n* [[Mont du Lac des Cygnes]]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category-inline|Parc national des Grands-Jardins}}\n* [http://www.bonjourquebec.com/qc-fr/repertoire-attraits/parc-national-du-quebec/parc-national-des-grands-jardins_1931513.html  Parc national des Grands-Jardins]\n*[http://www.sepaq.com/pq/grj/index.dot Grands-Jardins National Park] - official site\n* {{fr}} [http://biospherecharlevoix.com/ Site officiel de la R\u00e9serve mondiale de la Biosph\u00e8re de Charlevoix-UNESCO]\n\n{{Protected Areas of Quebec}}\n[[Category:IUCN Category II]]\n[[Category:Charlevoix Regional County Municipality]]\n[[Category:National parks of Quebec]]\n[[Category:Important Bird Areas of Canada]]\n[[Category:Protected areas of Capitale-Nationale]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox protected area\n| name =  Grands-Jardins National Park\n| iucn_category = II\n| photo = Parc national des Grands-Jardins.jpg\n| photo_caption =\n| location = [[Lac-Pikauba, Quebec|Lac-Pikauba]], [[Charlevoix Regional County Municipality, Quebec|Charlevoix Regional County Municipality]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]]\n| nearest_city = [[Baie-Saint-Paul]]\n| coordinates = {{coords|47|41|N|70|51|W|display=inline, title}}\n| area =\n| established =\n| visitation_num =\n| visitation_year =\n| governing_body =\n}}\n'''Grands-Jardins National Park''' is a [[provincial park]], located in the Unorganized Territory of [[Lac-Pikauba, Quebec|Lac-Pikauba]], in the [[Charlevoix Regional County Municipality]], in administrative region of [[Capitale-Nationale]], in [[Quebec]], [[Canada]].<ref>[http://www.mddep.gouv.qc.ca/biodiversite/aires_protegees/registre/reg-design/17Parc-nationalquebec.pdf Registre des aires prot\u00e9g\u00e9es du Qu\u00e9bec] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212162228/http://www.mddep.gouv.qc.ca/biodiversite/aires_protegees/registre/reg-design/17Parc-nationalquebec.pdf |date=2013-12-12}}, Minist\u00e8re du D\u00e9veloppement durable, de l\u2019Environnement et des Parcs.{{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\nThe Grands-Jardins National Park is a protected area for the conservation of the natural heritage of the Charlevoix region in which certain human activities are permitted.

A few years later, the forest already begins to regain its rights and slowly resumes its cycle of natural succession.\n\nOn September 13, 2017, the Grands-Jardins National Park was enlarged by {{convert|8.9|km|2}} to reach an area of {{convert|318.9|km|2}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mffp.gouv.qc.ca/parcs/reseau-parcs-nationaux/fiches/grands-jardins.jsp|title=Parc national des Grands-Jardins|website=Minist\u00e8re des Forests, Wildlife and Parks|access-date=September 24, 2017}}.</ref>.\n\n== Geography ==\n=== Topography ===\n[[File:Mont du Lac \u00e0 Mo\u00efse 2018.jpg|thumbnail|[[Mont du Lac \u00e0 Mo\u00efse]]]]\nThe topography of the park is varied due to the mountain ranges that characterize the park. The climatic conditions of the park can easily vary from place to place. The territory is part of the [[Canadian Shield]] and its rock base is mainly composed of granite rocks such as [[igneous rock]]. In addition, part of the territory is composed of anorthosite, a type of igneous rock.\n\n* [[Mont du Lac \u00e0 Mo\u00efse]]\n* [[Mont du Lac des Cygnes]]\n* Mont de l'Ours\n* Mont Jean-Palardy\n* Mont Ren\u00e9-Richard\n* La Chouenne\n\n=== Hydrography ===\n[[File:Lac des Cygnes Quebec.jpg|thumbnail|left|Lac des Cygnes]]\nThe park includes more than 120 bodies of water as well as several mountains that are part of the mountain range of [[Laurentian Mountains]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Portrait - Parc national des Grands-Jardins - Ecological integrity monitoring program - Parcs Qu\u00e9bec - S\u00e9paq|url=http://www.sepaq.com/parcs-quebec/psie/resultats/parc/grj/portrait.dot|website=www.sepaq.com|access-date=2016-12-05}}</ref> The summits of these mountains are protected because of the fragility of the ecosystems present at the summits which are sensitive to the trampling of hikers. These summits are still accessible to hikers by marked and landscaped trails. The water bodies make up 3.6% of the park area and the two most important watersheds are the [[Malbaie River]] and the [[Sainte-Anne-du-Nord River]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Portrait of the park - Parc national des Grands-Jardins - Parcs Qu\u00e9bec - S\u00e9paq|url=https://www.sepaq.com/pq/grj/decouverte/portrait.dot|website=www.sepaq.com|access-date= 2016-12-05}}</ref>\n\n== Fauna ==\nThe park offers a privileged habitat for several animals. Three distinct habitat types can be observed in the park: young forests which were created by natural fires and logging, mature forests composed of black spruce and balsam fir with closed cover and taiga reminiscent of the Great Northern Quebec. Taiga environments similar to that of Grands-Jardins National Park are normally found more than {{convert|500|km}} further north, above the 52th parallel. These different habitats make it possible to shelter a variety of animals, some of which have threatened or vulnerable status. We find in particular populations of [[Alces|moose]], [[reindeer|woodland caribou]], [[bear|black bear]], [[red fox]], [[pig-spicy]], [[common loon]], [[Canada grouse]], [[Wolf (mammal)|wolves]], several [[lynx]] and several other species.\n\nDue to the diversity of habitats found within the national park, several species frequent the latter, including three species that are classified as vulnerable, namely the [[woodland caribou]] of the forest ecotype, the [[Bicknell's thrush]] and [[Barrow's Goldeneye|Barrow's Goldeneye]].<ref name=\"mfpp\"/> These species have the most serious status under the Quebec Act on threatened or vulnerable species. There are also seven species likely to be designated threatened or vulnerable, namely [[arctic char]], [[golden eagle]], [[peregrine falcon]], [[Common nighthawk America|nightjar of America]]<nowiki/>, [[chimney swift]], [[rock vole]], [[cougar]] and [[Cooper vole-lemming]].<ref name=\"mfpp\"/>{{,}}<ref>{{cite article|language=French|author1=Lepage, M.|title=Threatened or vulnerable vertebrate fauna in the boreal forest|periodical=Canadian naturalist|date=Fall 2001, volume 125, number 3|issn =|read online=|pages= 131-137}}</ref> The park is obviously home to several species of mammals, birds, amphibians, fish and insects.\n\n==== Mammals ====\n\nThe mammal category includes as many large mammals as small rodents, moving from moose to bear and porcupine. We thus find the following mammals: several species of shrews (the great shrew, the common shrew, sooty, palustrine and pygmy), the condylure with a star nose, the snowshoe hare, the red squirrel, the large polatouche, the marmot common, Canada beaver, several species of voles (red-backed Gapper, fields, rocks, Cooper's lemming), phenacomys, muskrat, some species of mouse (deer, wood jumping and field jumping ), American porcupine, coyote, gray wolf, red fox, black bear, raccoon, long-tailed weasel, stoat, river otter, woodland caribou, white-tailed deer, moose, American marten, American mink, striped skunk, cougar and Canadian lynx.<ref>{{cite web|language=French|title=List of species - mammals|url=https://www.sepaq.com/dotAsset/27312.pdf|website=sepaq.com|date=|access-date=2016-12-02}}</ref>. This is explained by the varied habitats offered by the vast territory of the Grands-Jardins National Park.\n\n[[File: Snowshoe Hare, Shirleys Bay.jpg|thumbnail|[[Snowshoe hare]].]]\n\nThe [[Snowshoe hare|snowshoe hare]] is one of the most important species in the park (and even in Canada) from an ecological point of view<ref>{{cite web|title=Faune et flora of the country - The snowshoe hare|url=http://www.hww.ca/fr/faune/mammiferes/le-lievre-d-amerique.html|website=www.hww.ca|access-date=2016-12-05}}</ref>, because it represents a food source for a good number of predators which frequent the national park and the boreal forest in general such as the Canada lynx, the red fox and the coyote. In addition, it feeds on several plants and shrubs in the boreal forest.\n\nThe woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) is a mammal very sensitive to the presence of humans. Too large a presence on its territory can disturb the species and modify its behavior and lead it to frequent places less favorable for the species, making the caribou more vulnerable to its predators such as the wolf and the black bear. The territory of the Grands-Jardins Park is an important environment for the calving, rutting and winter feeding of the woodland caribou and plays a decisive role in the conservation of the species.<ref> {{cite article|language=French|author1=Courtois, R., Ouellet, JP, Gingras, A., Dussault, C., Banville D.|title=The situation of forest caribou in Quebec|periodical=The Canadian naturalist|date=Fall 2001 Volume 125 num. ro 3|issn=|read online=|pages=53-63}}</ref> It lives in particular in mature coniferous forests where arboreal lichens are very present.\n\nThe [[black bear]], an omnivorous animal whose diet consists mainly of plants, is [http://www.parcparcours.com/grands-jardins/fiches/ours.html abundant in the national park]. However, it also feeds on fawns that are easy prey for bears when they venture out of the dense forest. The bear prefers open and semi-open sites where the vegetation constituting a good part of its diet is more abundant and rarely ventures into the dense forest of the park.\n\nThe [[Canadian lynx]] (Lynx canadensis) is a wild feline from the boreal forest that lives in varied habitats dominated by mature stand forests. It is one of the three wild felines that live in Canada with the bobcat to which it resembles much and the cougar<ref>{{cite web|title=Fauna and flora of the country - The lynx of Canada|url=http://www.hww.ca/fr/faune/mammiferes/le-lynx-du-canada.html|website=www.hww.ca|access-date=2016-12-05}}</ref>. This carnivore feeds mainly on snowshoe hares that are found in the park. Thus the Grands-Jardins National Park is a suitable habitat for this species. On the other hand, it is a shy and secretive feline since it is rarely observed.\n\nThe [[Cooper's vole-lemming|Cooper's lemming vole]] (Synaptomys cooperi) is a small rodent that frequents wetlands.<ref>DESROSIERS, N., R. MORIN and J. JUTRAS. 2002. [http://www.cdpnq.gouv.qc.ca/pdf/atlas/micromammiferes.pdf Atlas of micromammals of Quebec]. Quebec Wildlife and Parks Society. Wildlife Development Directorate.

The [[common loon]], [[golden eagle]], [[black-backed woodpecker]], [[Barrow's Goldeneye]], [[peregrine falcon]], [[thrush Bicknell]] and [[Canada grouse]] are a small, non-exhaustive list.<ref>{{cite web|language=French|title=List of species - birds|url=https://www.sepaq.com/dotAsset/27314.pdf|website=sepaq.com|date=|access-date=2016-12-02}}</ref>\n\nThe common loon, a skilled diver, lives in fish-rich lakes since it is a great predator of aquatic environments. Its presence indicates good health of the lakes it frequents. The golden eagle, meanwhile, lives in rock walls and open or semi-open environments. The [[Peregrine Falcon]] also lives in the rock faces and open spaces of the national park. The black-backed woodpecker plays an important role in burnt forests since it creates cavities in dead trees in order to feed on the insects that adore this environment. The cavities thus created are then used for several species. The [[Bicknell's Thrush]] which is a forest bird prefers rather dense and regenerating forests as habitat.<ref>{{cite article|language=English|author1=Chisholm SE et Leonard ML|title=Effect of forest management on rare habitat specialist, the Bicknell's Thrush (Catharus bicknelli)|periodical=NRC Canada|date=2008|issn=|read online=|pages=217-223}}</ref>.

Among the amphibians, we find the [[two-line salamander]], [[American toad|American toad]], [[cruciferous tree frog]], [[wood frog]], [[Pelophylax kl. esculentus|green frog]], the [[northern frog]] and finally the [[striped snake]].<ref>{{cite web|language=French|title=List of species - amphibians and reptiles|url=https://www.sepaq.com/dotAsset/27310.pdf|website=sepaq.com|date=|access-date=2016-12-02}}.</ref> Arctic char and [[brook trout]] are two species of fish that frequent the national park.\n\n== Flora ==\n[[File: Kalmia latifolia Clementine Churchill.jpg|thumb|Kalmia latifolia Clementine Churchill]] The park is made up of different habitats due to its diverse topography, going from high mountains to large lakes. This is why we find there forest habitats which dominate the landscape, open habitats, taiga habitats composed mainly of lichens as well as varied aquatic habitats. The park helps protect a site of exceptional character that are cladonia spruces, a sample of taiga which is unique for southern Quebec. This type of habitat is normally found further north in Quebec.<ref name=\"mfpp\"/> These different types of habitats are home to a wide variety of plants from four different categories: heather, lichen, bog and trees.\n\nAbout fifteen species of the heather family are [http://www.parcparcours.com/grands-jardins/fiches/ericacees.html observable in the park]. Their flowering extends from the beginning of June until the end of the summer. One of the most easily observable flowers is probably the narrow-leaved Kalmia (Kalmia augustifolia) which has pink saucer-shaped flowers. The park is also home to [[Labrador tea]] (Rhododendron groenlandicum), a few varieties of [cranberry] (Vaccinium sp.) That produce blueberries and cranberries, the [[Moneses uniflora|pirole with one flower]] (Moneses uniflora), [[Gaultheria|wintergreen]] Hispid (Gaultheria hispidula), [[Glaucous Andromeda]] (Andromeda polifolia var. Glaucophylla) and [[Chamaedaphne calyculata|Caliculated Cassandra]] (Chamaedaphne calyculata). [[File: Boreal Flora.jpg|left|thumbnail|Lichens cladoni|alt=|293x293px]] A second family of plants is very abundant in the park, that of the lichen which is represented in the Parc des Grands-Jardins by 200 different species. Different species colonize different parts of the park. Some lichens are more adapted to the soil while others colonize trees or rock walls. There are different species of crustacean and foliaceous lichens that grow mainly on rocks in the Bear Mountains and Swan Lake. Lichens of the Bryoria and Usnea type are found on mature trees in the boreal forest. Finally, fruticulous lichens of the genus Cladoni grow directly on the ground. Lichens are an important component of the ecosystem since they are the main source of food for certain species, especially for woodland caribou in winter.<ref>{{cite article|language=French|author1=Courtois, R., Ouellet, JP, Gingras, A., Dussault C. and Banville D.|title=The situation of the woodland caribou in Quebec|periodical = The Canadian naturalist|date=autumn 2001 volume 125 number 3|issn=|read online=|pages=53-63}}</ref>\n\nTwo remarkable peat bogs are present on the territory of the national park. These are rare habitats for southern Quebec. The first peatland is the permafrost of Mont de l'ours and the second is the reticulated peatland of Lac Malbaie.\n\nThe trees in the park are mainly [[Black spruce|black spruce]] and [[Balsam fir|balsam fir]] which are similar to the Canadian boreal forest. There are also larches and jack pines. The boreal forest, which is found in the national park, is dominated by conifers which are particularly well adapted to the harsh boreal climate.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fauna and flora of the country - The Canadian boreal forest|url=http://www.hww.ca/fr/espaces-sauvages/la-foret-boreale-canadienne.html|website=www.hww.ca|access-date=2016-12-05}}</ref>.

The second is that of characterizing the emergence of insects on lakes. The third is the restoration of borrow pits abandoned since 2007, led by the team of Line Rochefort of the Faculty of Agriculture and Food Sciences at Laval University. The goal of the project is to accelerate the vegetal restoration of the borrow pits of the park created by the extraction of sand and gravel which have been abandoned for 40 years. The park is also the subject of a project to modify the park boundary<ref>Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks, National Parks Directorate. Undated. ''Information document, Project to modify the boundary of Grands-Jardins National Park''. [pdf] 28 p.</ref> in order to enlarge it and incorporate an interesting area for the conservation of five new peaks, six lakes and the habitat of the woodland caribou<ref name=\"mfpp\"/>. The park team has also been carrying out a monitoring of the loon's nesting since 2007 and invites visitors to share their observations of the bird via observation sheets.\n\nOne of the main goals of the national park is the conservation of the natural environments of the Charlevoix region and the species that inhabit it. The protection of aquatic environments and peaks are major issues for Grands-Jardins National Park. Rigorous monitoring of fishing quotas, identification of spawning grounds and characterization of numerous water bodies allow the park to minimize the pressure on the aquatic ecosystem and promote a favorable environment for the populations of Arctic char and d brook trout that depend on it. Marked trails and awareness of hikers reduce the anthropogenic impact on the fragile ecosystems of mountain peaks.\n\n==References==\n:''This article was initially translated from the French Wikipedia.''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Autres projets|commons=Category:Parc national des Grands-Jardins}}\n* [[Charlevoix Regional County Municipality]]\n* [[Lac-Pikauba, Quebec|Lac-Pikauba]], an unorganized territory\n* [[Malbaie River]]\n* [[Petite rivi\u00e8re Malbaie]]\n* [[Sainte-Anne River (Beaupr\u00e9)]]\n* [[Rivi\u00e8re du Chemin des Canots]]\n* [[Rivi\u00e8re de l'Enfer]]\n* [[Lac Sainte-Anne du Nord]]\n* [[Malbaie Pond]]\n* [[National Parks of Quebec]]\n* [[National Parks of Canada]]\n* [[Mont du Lac des Cygnes]]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category-inline|Parc national des Grands-Jardins}}\n* [http://www.bonjourquebec.com/qc-fr/repertoire-attraits/parc-national-du-quebec/parc-national-des-grands-jardins_1931513.html  Parc national des Grands-Jardins]\n*[http://www.sepaq.com/pq/grj/index.dot Grands-Jardins National Park] - official site\n* {{fr}} [http://biospherecharlevoix.com/ Site officiel de la R\u00e9serve mondiale de la Biosph\u00e8re de Charlevoix-UNESCO]\n\n{{Protected Areas of Quebec}}\n[[Category:IUCN Category II]]\n[[Category:Charlevoix Regional County Municipality]]\n[[Category:National parks of Quebec]]\n[[Category:Important Bird Areas of Canada]]\n[[Category:Protected areas of Capitale-Nationale]]\n", "name_user": "Veillg1", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grands-Jardins_National_Park"}

Theoretically, a decrease in transferrin could additionally be decreased by an upregulation of [[transferrin receptor]]s, but the latter does not appear to change with inflammation.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chua E, Clague JE, Sharma AK, Horan MA, Lombard M |title=Serum transferrin receptor assay in iron deficiency anaemia and anaemia of chronic disease in the elderly |journal=QJM |volume=92 |issue=10 |pages=587\u201394 |date=October 1999 |pmid=10627880 |doi= 10.1093/qjmed/92.10.587|url=http://qjmed.oxfordjournals.org/content/92/10/587.full}}</ref>\n\nWhile the production of C3 (a complement factor) increases in the liver, the plasma concentration often lowers because of an increased turn-over, therefore it is often seen as a negative acute-phase protein.\n\n==Clinical significance==\nMeasurement of acute-phase proteins, especially C-reactive protein, is a useful marker of inflammation in both medical and veterinary [[clinical pathology]]. It correlates with the [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] (ESR), however not always directly. This is due to the ESR being largely dependent on elevation of [[fibrinogen]], an acute phase reactant with a half-life of approximately one week. This protein will therefore remain higher for longer despite removal of the inflammatory stimuli. In contrast, C-reactive protein (with a half-life of 6\u20138 hours) rises rapidly and can quickly return to within the normal range if treatment is employed.

It correlates with the [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] (ESR), however not always directly. This is due to the ESR being largely dependent on elevation of [[fibrinogen]], an acute phase reactant with a half-life of approximately one week. This protein will therefore remain higher for longer despite removal of the inflammatory stimuli. In contrast, C-reactive protein (with a half-life of 6\u20138 hours) rises rapidly and can quickly return to within the normal range if treatment is employed. For example, in active [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], one may find a raised ESR but normal C-reactive protein.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}They may also indicate liver failure.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ananian P, Hardwigsen J, Bernard D, Le Treut YP |title=Serum acute-phase protein level as indicator for liver failure after liver resection |journal=Hepatogastroenterology |volume=52 |issue=63 |pages=857\u201361 |year=2005 |pmid=15966220 |doi=}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* http://eclinpath.com/chemistry/proteins/acute-phase-proteins/\n* {{MeshName|Acute-Phase+Proteins}}\n\n{{Acute phase proteins}}\n{{Portal bar|Biology|Medicine}}\n\n[[Category:Acute phase proteins|*]]\n[[Category:Immune system]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePositive:Journal cites:, added 1 DOI, added 1 PMC, templated 1 journal cites", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute-phase_protein"}

The cast includes [[Naomi Watts]], [[Ewan McGregor]] and [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]].\n\nThe film received positive reviews from critics for its direction and its acting, especially for Watts who was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Drama]], and a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role]].\n\n==Plot==\nMaria Bennett, her husband Henry Bennett, and their three sons Lucas, Thomas, and Simon go on a Christmas holiday in 2004 to [[Khao Lak]], [[Thailand]]. Arriving on Christmas Eve, they settle in and begin to enjoy the brand new Orchid Beach Resort. Two days later on [[Boxing Day]], the massive [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 tsunami]] inundates the area.\n\nMaria and Lucas eventually emerge from the swirling water and find one another, with Maria having sustained serious injuries to her leg and chest. They help a toddler, Daniel, from the wreckage and are soon found by locals who transfer them to a local hospital in the city of [[Takua Pa]]. Daniel is separated from them during the journey. At the hospital, Maria encourages Lucas to help others find their family members while she goes into surgery for her chest injuries.\n\nMeanwhile, Henry, Thomas and Simon have also survived and are together. Henry leaves the two boys with another family who are taken to the mountains for safe shelter by local relief crews while he stays behind to search for Maria and Lucas. While out looking, injured and alone, he is picked up by a passer-by and driven to a nearby bus shelter to wait out with other survivors. Communication facilities are scarce, but eventually a tourist named Karl ([[S\u00f6nke M\u00f6hring]]), who has also been separated from his family, lends Henry his cell phone to contact his relatives. Henry promises Maria's father he will look everywhere for his family and that he will find them. Karl tells the group his wife had left him a note confirming they were at the beach, their location when the wave hit. He volunteers to accompany Henry to look for Maria and Lucas and his own family, too.\n\nWhile Maria is in surgery, her medical chart is mixed-up with another patient who has died. Lucas returns to find his mother's bed empty and is then taken to a tent where children without families are kept safe. The mistake is discovered when Lucas cannot identify any of the dead woman's jewelry and he is subsequently reunited with his mother, who has been moved to a private room in the [[Intensive Care Unit|ICU]]. In the hospital, while he waits, Lucas finds Daniel, who has been reunited with his father.\n\nHenry and Karl search for their families in various places before they arrive at the hospital, where Henry is given five minutes to look. Karl gives him a piece of paper with his family members\u2019 names on. The vehicle carrying Thomas and Simon also stops outside the hospital, and the boys get off so Simon can urinate. From a distance, Lucas recognizes his father, and while searching him out in the chaotic crowd outside, Lucas' brothers spot him and they reunite. Henry finds the three of them together. He learns that Maria is in the hospital, ready to undergo more surgery for her leg, which she survives. Flashbacks reveal how she came to be badly injured and how she surfaced the water. While in surgery, Lucas tells his father he has something really important to tell Maria.\n\nThe following day, the family boards an ambulance airplane to [[Singapore]] so Maria may receive further medical treatment, arranged by their insurance company. On the plane, Lucas tells his mother he knows Daniel is safe. Maria cries as she looks out the window at the chaos left behind.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] as Lucas Bennett, the 12-year-old<ref name=\"Gene Triplett, January 4, 2013\">{{cite web | url=http://newsok.com/movie-review-the-impossible/article/3742524 | title=Movie review: 'The Impossible' | date=4 January 2013 | accessdate=11 February 2013 | author=Triplett, Gene}}</ref> son.\n* [[Naomi Watts]] as [[Mar\u00eda Bel\u00f3n|Maria Bennett]], a doctor and the mother of the Bennett family.\n* [[Ewan McGregor]] as Henry Bennett, the father of the Bennett family.\n* [[Samuel Joslin]] as Thomas Bennett, the seven-and-a-half-year-old son.\n* [[Oaklee Pendergast]] as Simon Bennett, the five-year-old son.\n* [[Marta Etura]] as Simone\n*Johan Sundberg as Daniel\n* [[S\u00f6nke M\u00f6hring]] as Karl Schweber, a German man trying to find his wife and daughter.

Had this film been purely about the tale of a western middle class family's 'ruined' holiday then I would have agreed. For me, it was the exact opposite. Rather than concentrating on the 'privileged white visitors', the film portrayed the profound sense of community and unity that I experienced in Thailand, with this family at the centre of it. Both for my (then) 16-year-old self and the Bel\u00f3n family, it was the [[Thai people]] who waded through the settled water after the first wave had struck to help individuals and families...

Henry leaves the two boys with another family who are taken to the mountains for safe shelter by local relief crews while he stays behind to search for Maria and Lucas. While out looking, injured and alone, he is picked up by a passer-by and driven to a nearby bus shelter to wait out with other survivors. Communication facilities are scarce, but eventually a tourist named Karl ([[S\u00f6nke M\u00f6hring]]), who has also been separated from his family, lends Henry his cell phone to contact his relatives. Henry promises Maria's father he will look everywhere for his family and that he will find them. Karl tells the group his wife had left him a note confirming they were at the beach, their location when the wave hit. He volunteers to accompany Henry to look for Maria and Lucas and his own family, too.\n\nWhile Maria is in surgery, her medical chart is mixed-up with another patient who has died. Lucas returns to find his mother's bed empty and is then taken to a tent where children without families are kept safe. The mistake is discovered when Lucas cannot identify any of the dead woman's jewelry and he is subsequently reunited with his mother, who has been moved to a private room in the [[Intensive Care Unit|ICU]]. In the hospital, while he waits, Lucas finds Daniel, who has been reunited with his father.\n\nHenry and Karl search for their families in various places before they arrive at the hospital, where Henry is given five minutes to look. Karl gives him a piece of paper with his family members\u2019 names on. The vehicle carrying Thomas and Simon also stops outside the hospital, and the boys get off so Simon can urinate. From a distance, Lucas recognizes his father, and while searching him out in the chaotic crowd outside, Lucas' brothers spot him and they reunite. Henry finds the three of them together. He learns that Maria is in the hospital, ready to undergo more surgery for her leg, which she survives. Flashbacks reveal how she came to be badly injured and how she surfaced the water. While in surgery, Lucas tells his father he has something really important to tell Maria.\n\nThe following day, the family boards an ambulance airplane to [[Singapore]] so Maria may receive further medical treatment, arranged by their insurance company. On the plane, Lucas tells his mother he knows Daniel is safe. Maria cries as she looks out the window at the chaos left behind.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] as Lucas Bennett, the 12-year-old<ref name=\"Gene Triplett, January 4, 2013\">{{cite web | url=http://newsok.com/movie-review-the-impossible/article/3742524 | title=Movie review: 'The Impossible' | date=4 January 2013 | accessdate=11 February 2013 | author=Triplett, Gene}}</ref> son.\n* [[Naomi Watts]] as [[Mar\u00eda Bel\u00f3n|Maria Bennett]], a doctor and the mother of the Bennett family.\n* [[Ewan McGregor]] as Henry Bennett, the father of the Bennett family.\n* [[Samuel Joslin]] as Thomas Bennett, the seven-and-a-half-year-old son.\n* [[Oaklee Pendergast]] as Simon Bennett, the five-year-old son.\n* [[Marta Etura]] as Simone\n*Johan Sundberg as Daniel\n* [[S\u00f6nke M\u00f6hring]] as Karl Schweber, a German man trying to find his wife and daughter.

Had this film been purely about the tale of a western middle class family's 'ruined' holiday then I would have agreed. For me, it was the exact opposite. Rather than concentrating on the 'privileged white visitors', the film portrayed the profound sense of community and unity that I experienced in Thailand, with this family at the centre of it. Both for my (then) 16-year-old self and the Bel\u00f3n family, it was the [[Thai people]] who waded through the settled water after the first wave had struck to help individuals and families...

Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the [[Red Special]].<ref name=redspecial>{{cite book |last1=May|first1=Brian |authorlink1= Brian May|last2=Bradley |first2=Simon |title=Brian May's Red Special  |date=2014 |publisher=Prion Books |isbn=978-1-78097-276-3 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|1992 tribute concert]], the release of ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, \"[[No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)]]\" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists.

May brought guitarist [[Jamie Moses]] on board to replace Mike Caswell. The backing vocalists, Ryder, Stockley and Thompson, were replaced by [[Catherine Porter]] and [[Shelley Preston]]. On 23&nbsp;February 1993, this new line-up of The Brian May Band began its world tour in the US, both supporting [[Guns N' Roses]] and headlining a few dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/live/brian.htm#1993bttlnorthamerica1|title=1993 Back To The Light North American Tour (1st leg)|publisher=Ultimatequeen.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> The tour included dates in North America, Europe (support act: Valentine) and Japan.

May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', and featured mainly [[Spike Edney]], Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5&nbsp;April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Bristol]], England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band which now needed a new drummer on short notice. [[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording the drum tracks and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced him on the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.  Conway (Brian May in a wig and colourful suit playing the part of a [[teddy boy]] crooner) would play a number of 1950s [[rock and roll]] standards prior to May's 'arrival'.  A bonus T. E.

While May and his father were building the Red Special, May also produced plans to build a second guitar. However, the Red Special was so successful that May had no need to build another guitar.<ref name=\"The Spade\"/> These plans were eventually given to guitar [[luthier]] Andrew Guyton in around 2004/05, some slight modifications were made and the guitar was built. It was named \"The Spade\", as the shape of the body resembled the form shown on playing cards. However, the guitar also came to be known as \"The Guitar That Time Forgot\".<ref name=\"The Spade\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guytonguitars.com/the-spade-guitar.html|title=The 'Spade' guitar|website=Guyton Guitars|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nMay commented on the Red Special:\n\n{{quote|I like a big neck \u2013 thick, flat and wide.

''Queen in Their Own Words''. p.62. Omnibus Press, 1992</ref>}}\n\nIn addition to using his home-made guitar he prefers to use coins (especially [[Sixpence (British coin)|a sixpence]] from the farewell proof set of 1970), instead of a more traditional plastic [[plectrum]], because he feels their rigidity gives him more control in playing.<ref name=\"Jackson\"/> He is known to carry coins in his pockets specifically for this purpose.<ref name=\"Jackson\">Laura Jackson (2011).

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including: [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\" \"Chinese Torture\"); [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"); [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"); slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"); [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"); tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\"); and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"Good Company\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer\u2014the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998\u2014as back-up.

He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox&nbsp;AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, [[flanger]] and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"Hammer to Fall\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would step in occasionally (such as on \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUyPyTn-IS4 |title=Queen Save Me (Live) |website=youtube.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> and \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\").<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sheetmusic-free.com/flash-theme-sheet-music-queen/ |title=Flash Theme Sheet Music Queen |website=sheetmusic-free.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano.

He used a \"genuine [[George Formby]] Ukulele-Banjo\" in \"[[Bring Back That Leroy Brown]]\" and [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"Good Company\"]]. Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album). May was keen on using some toys as instruments as well.

From Queen's ''[[Queen II]]'' to ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'', May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with [[Lee Holdridge]], ''Il Colosso'', for [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.  May performed the opera with [[Jerry Hadley]], [[Sissel Kyrkjebo]], and [[Just William]].

Harold May''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CBE}} (born 19 July 1947) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and astrophysicist. He is the lead guitarist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. His songs include \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", \"[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" and \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\".\n\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], having previously performed with Taylor in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]], which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the [[Red Special]].<ref name=redspecial>{{cite book |last1=May|first1=Brian |authorlink1= Brian May|last2=Bradley |first2=Simon |title=Brian May's Red Special  |date=2014 |publisher=Prion Books |isbn=978-1-78097-276-3 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|1992 tribute concert]], the release of ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, \"[[No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)]]\" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists.

May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', and featured mainly [[Spike Edney]], Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5&nbsp;April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Bristol]], England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band which now needed a new drummer on short notice. [[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording the drum tracks and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced him on the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.  Conway (Brian May in a wig and colourful suit playing the part of a [[teddy boy]] crooner) would play a number of 1950s [[rock and roll]] standards prior to May's 'arrival'.  A bonus T. E. Conway EP entitled ''Retro Rock Special'' was attached to some pressings of the ''Another World'' album.  The Conway character was retired at the end of the tour.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/brian-may-guide-queen-guitarists-eccentricities-obessions/|first=Adam|last=White|title=From badgers to flamboyant alter egos: a guide to the strange obsessions of Queen's Brian May|date=19 July 2017|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>\nIn May 1999, May recorded lead guitars for the Guns N' Roses song \"Catcher in the Rye\" on ''[[Chinese Democracy]]'', however, his performance was removed from the album by the time it was released in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/07/brian-may-chinese-democracy|title=Brian May dropped from Guns N' Roses album|last=Anthony|first=James|date=7 November 2008|website=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>\n\n===2000\u20132010===\n[[File:Queen 2005 1010016.JPG|thumb|May performing in Frankfurt in 2005.]]\nFrom his last solo release in 1998, May has been performing as a solo artist, as part of an ensemble, and infrequently as Queen with Roger Taylor.

While May and his father were building the Red Special, May also produced plans to build a second guitar. However, the Red Special was so successful that May had no need to build another guitar.<ref name=\"The Spade\"/> These plans were eventually given to guitar [[luthier]] Andrew Guyton in around 2004/05, some slight modifications were made and the guitar was built. It was named \"The Spade\", as the shape of the body resembled the form shown on playing cards. However, the guitar also came to be known as \"The Guitar That Time Forgot\".<ref name=\"The Spade\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guytonguitars.com/the-spade-guitar.html|title=The 'Spade' guitar|website=Guyton Guitars|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nMay commented on the Red Special:\n\n{{quote|I like a big neck \u2013 thick, flat and wide.

''Queen in Their Own Words''. p.62. Omnibus Press, 1992</ref>}}\n\nIn addition to using his home-made guitar he prefers to use coins (especially [[Sixpence (British coin)|a sixpence]] from the farewell proof set of 1970), instead of a more traditional plastic [[plectrum]], because he feels their rigidity gives him more control in playing.<ref name=\"Jackson\"/> He is known to carry coins in his pockets specifically for this purpose.<ref name=\"Jackson\">Laura Jackson (2011).

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including: [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\" \"Chinese Torture\"); [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"); [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"); slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"); [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"); tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\"); and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"Good Company\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer\u2014the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998\u2014as back-up.

He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox&nbsp;AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, [[flanger]] and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would step in occasionally (such as on \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUyPyTn-IS4 |title=Queen Save Me (Live) |website=youtube.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> and \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\").<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sheetmusic-free.com/flash-theme-sheet-music-queen/ |title=Flash Theme Sheet Music Queen |website=sheetmusic-free.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano.

He used a \"genuine [[George Formby]] Ukulele-Banjo\" in \"[[Bring Back That Leroy Brown]]\" and [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"Good Company\"]]. Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album). May was keen on using some toys as instruments as well.

From Queen's ''[[Queen II]]'' to ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'', May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with [[Lee Holdridge]], ''Il Colosso'', for [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.  May performed the opera with [[Jerry Hadley]], [[Sissel Kyrkjebo]], and [[Just William]].
