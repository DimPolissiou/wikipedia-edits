By the time European explorers and traders visited Iowa, American Indians were largely settled farmers with complex economic, social, and political systems. This transformation happened gradually. During the [[Archaic period in North America|Archaic period]] (10,500 to 2,800 years ago), American Indians adapted to local environments and ecosystems, slowly becoming more sedentary as populations increased.<ref name=\"iaarch\" />\n\nMore than 3,000 years ago, during the Late Archaic period, American Indians in Iowa began utilizing domesticated plants. The subsequent [[Woodland period]] saw an increased reliance on agriculture and social complexity, with increased use of mounds, ceramics, and specialized subsistence. During the Late Prehistoric period (beginning about AD 900) increased use of maize and social changes led to social flourishing and nucleated settlements.<ref name=\"iaarch\" />\n\nThe arrival of European trade goods and diseases in the Protohistoric period led to dramatic population shifts and economic and social upheaval, with the arrival of new tribes and early European explorers and traders. There were numerous Indian tribes living in Iowa at the time of early European exploration. Tribes which were probably descendants of the prehistoric [[Oneota]] include the [[Sioux|Dakota]], [[Ho-Chunk]], [[Ioway]], and [[Otoe (tribe)|Otoe]].

By the time European explorers and traders visited Iowa, American Indians were largely settled farmers with complex economic, social, and political systems. This transformation happened gradually. During the [[Archaic period in North America|Archaic period]] (10,500 to 2,800 years ago), American Indians adapted to local environments and ecosystems, slowly becoming more sedentary as populations increased.<ref name=\"iaarch\" />\n\nMore than 3,000 years ago, during the Late Archaic period, American Indians in Iowa began utilizing domesticated plants. The subsequent [[Woodland period]] saw an increased reliance on agriculture and social complexity, with increased use of mounds, ceramics, and specialized subsistence. During the Late Prehistoric period (beginning about AD 900) increased use of maize and social changes led to social flourishing and nucleated settlements.<ref name=\"iaarch\" />\n\nThe arrival of European trade goods and diseases in the Protohistoric period led to dramatic population shifts and economic and social upheaval, with the arrival of new tribes and early European explorers and traders. There were numerous Indian tribes living in Iowa at the time of early European exploration. Tribes which were probably descendants of the prehistoric [[Oneota]] include the [[Sioux|Dakota]], [[Ho-Chunk]], [[Ioway]], and [[Otoe (tribe)|Otoe]]. Tribes which arrived in Iowa in the late prehistoric or protohistoric periods include the [[Illiniwek]], [[Meskwaki]], [[Omaha (tribe)|Omaha]], and [[Sauk people|Sauk]].<ref name=\"iaarch\">Alex, Lynn M.

He was the leader of two political parties: [[Centre Alliance|Nick Xenophon Team]] federally, and [[SA-Best|Nick Xenophon's SA-BEST]] in South Australia. In October 2017, Xenophon resigned from the Australian Senate to contest a seat in the [[South Australian House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] at the [[2018 South Australian state election]]. From 1997 to 2007, he was a member of the [[South Australian Legislative Council]], serving as an independent on a [[No Pokies]] policy platform. When the Nick Xenophon Team changed its name to Centre Alliance, Xenophon himself ceased to be directly involved with the party.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://centrealliance.org.au/ |work=Centre Alliance website |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Centre Alliance |accessdate=11 May 2018 |quote=Q.

Nick Xenophon is no longer involved with the party so it was appropriate to change the party name to a name that reflects the common sense centrist approach the party takes when tackling issues.}}</ref>\n\nXenophon initially focused on his central anti-gambling policy, but also embraced other issues in federal parliament such as civil liberties, defence, education, foreign policy, health, infrastructure, manufacturing, national security, and regional affairs.\n\nXenophon failed in his central mission to have poker machines curbed or eliminated in a lasting way, but was instrumental in the [[Rudd Government (2007\u201310)|Rudd Government]]'s repeal of [[WorkChoices]] legislation and the passage of the [[economic stimulus]] package, as well as the [[Abbott Government]]'s repeal of the [[Clean Energy Act 2011]].

It was also aired in India on [[Zee Zindagi]] under the title ''Katha... Do Behnon Ki''.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe betrayal of one will give birth to the greed of another. AKS is the story of two sisters, who in their youth were torn apart both in relations and emotions, because of a lack of trust and false accusations. A conflict that later on is transferred to their children, forcing an already troubled family into further despair.\n\n== Plot ==\nZakia lives with her three daughters and husband. Her two elder daughters Zohra and Zooni are from her previous marriage. It is revealed that her previous husband kicked her out of the house when she gave birth to a third daughter and refused to believe that was his daughter. That baby dies as it was very cold on the streets and Zakia's first husband refuses to have any mercy on her. Zakia's older sister (Shahbano) is married to her first husband's elder brother so is Zakia's 'jaithani' as well. She too supports Zakia's husband as she doesn't want to leave the luxurious life. Zakia has no support so is kicked out of the house. Zakia then remarries a poorer man.\n\nIn the future Zakia's daughters have  grown up and Zohra alliance has been fixed with her step-taya's son. Then Shahbano re-enters their lives and is now an even richer affluent woman and asks for Zohra's hand for her son Shah-Nawaz. However Zooni likes Shah-Nawaz as he is rich so can fulfill her desires of having a big house, with cars, servants and status. Zohra marries Shah-Nawaz and Zooni tries to ruin her sister's marriage. Thus the two sisters' (Shahbano and Zakia) destiny re-collides and history is replayed (hence the title Aks) as wealth again causes the relationship of two sisters (Zoni and Zohra) to break.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Zhalay Sarhadi]] Zohra Jawed\n* [[Mohib Mirza]] as Shahnawaz\n* [[Saba Hameed]] as Shahbano (Zahida)\n* [[Aiza Khan]] as Zoonehrah Javed (Zooni)\n* Naila Jaferi as Zakia Ismael\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{ARY Digital Programs}}\n\n[[Category:2012 Pakistani television series debuts]]\n[[Category:ARY Digital television series]]\n[[Category:Pakistani drama television series]]\n[[Category:Urdu-language television programs]]\n[[Category:2013 Pakistani television series endings]]\n[[Category:A&B Entertainment]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Pakistani English|date=June 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2015}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name            = Aks\n| image                = Aks ARY Digital drama title.jpg\n| caption              = ''Aks title screen''\n| show_name_2          = \n| genre                = [[Drama]]\n| creator              = \n| developer            = \n| writer               = Sarwat Nazir\n| director             = Nadeem Siddique\n| creative_director    = \n| presenter            = \n| starring             = [[Zhalay Sarhadi]]<br>[[Mohib Mirza]]<br>[[Saba Hameed]]<br>[[Aiza Khan]]<br>Naila Jaffery\n| judges               = \n| voices               = \n| narrated             = \n| theme_music_composer = \n| opentheme            = \n| endtheme             = \n| composer             = \n| country              = [[Pakistan]]\n| language             = [[Urdu]]\n| num_seasons          = <!-- or num_series -->\n| num_episodes         = 23\n| list_episodes        = \n| executive_producer   = \n| producer             = \n| editor               = \n| location             = \n| cinematography       = \n| camera               = \n| runtime              = ~45 minutes\n| company              = \n| distributor          = \n| channel              = [[ARY Digital]]\n| picture_format       = \n| audio_format         = \n| first_run            = \n| first_aired          = {{Start date|df=yes|2012|08|29}}\n| last_aired           = {{End date|df=yes|2013|02|06}}\n| preceded_by          = \n| followed_by          = \n| related              = \n| website              = \n| website_title        = Website\n| production_website   = \n}}\n\n'''Aks''' is a 2012 [[Pakistani dramas|Pakistani drama]] serial which aired on [[ARY Digital]] every Wednesday since 29 August 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Story and episodes of the serial|url=http://www.awazfun.pk//drama/home/543/Aks|publisher=awazfun.pk|accessdate=12 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209031147/http://www.awazfun.pk/drama/home/543/Aks|archive-date=9 February 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Serial is directed by ''Nadeem Siddiqui'' and written by ''Sarwat Nazir'', starring [[Zhalay Sarhadi]], [[Mohib Mirza]], [[Saba Hameed]], [[Aiza Khan]] and Naila Jaffery.<ref>{{cite web|title=Information and cast of the serial|url=http://www.tv.com.pk/tvshow/AKS/84|publisher=tv.com.pk|accessdate=12 February 2013}}</ref> Serial was last aired on 5 February 2013.

AKS is the story of two sisters, who in their youth were torn apart both in relations and emotions, because of a lack of trust and false accusations. A conflict that later on is transferred to their children, forcing an already troubled family into further despair.\n== Plot ==\nZakia lives with her three daughters and husband. Her two elder daughters Zohra and Zooni are from her previous marriage. It is revealed that her previous husband kicked her out of the house when she gave birth to a third daughter and refused to believe that was his daughter. That baby dies as it was very cold on the streets and Zakia's first husband refuses to have any mercy on her. Zakia's older sister (Shahbano) is married to her first husband's elder brother so is Zakia's 'jaithani' as well. She too supports Zakia's husband as she doesn't want to leave the luxurious life. Zakia has no support so is kicked out of the house. Zakia then remarries a poorer man.\nIn the future Zakia's daughters have  grown up and Zohra alliance has been fixed with her step-taya's son. Then Shahbano re-enters their lives and is now an even richer affluent woman and asks for Zohra's hand for her son Shah-Nawaz. However Zooni likes Shah-Nawaz as he is rich so can fulfill her desires of having a big house, with cars, servants and status. Zohra gets married to Shah-Nawaz and Zooni tries to ruin her sister's marriage. Thus the two sisters' (Shahbano and Zakia) destiny re-collides and history is replayed (hence the title Aks) as wealth again causes the relationship of two sisters (Zoni and Zohra) to break.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Zhalay Sarhadi]] Zohra Jawed\n* [[Mohib Mirza]] as Shahnawaz\n* [[Saba Hameed]] as Shahbano (Zahida)\n* [[Aiza Khan]] as Zoonehrah Javed (Zooni)\n* Naila Jaferi as Zakia Ismael\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{ARY Digital Programs}}\n\n[[Category:2012 Pakistani television series debuts]]\n[[Category:ARY Digital television series]]\n[[Category:Pakistani drama television series]]\n[[Category:Urdu-language television programs]]\n[[Category:2013 Pakistani television series endings]]\n[[Category:A&B Entertainment]]\n", "name_user": "Jellysandwich0", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aks_(2012_TV_series)"}
