It was the tenth appearance of the event. The competition was held from 19 to 20 October 1968. 38 fencers from 16 nations competed.<ref name=\"sports-reference\">{{cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1968/FEN/womens-foil-individual.html |title=Fencing: 1968 Olympic Results - Women's foil |accessdate=23 December 2010 |work=sports-reference.com}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n==Competition format==\n\nThe 1968 tournament continued to use a mix of pool play and knockout rounds, but with substantial changes from 1964. The first two rounds were round-robin pool play, followed by a knockout round, finishing with another pool for the final. Early-round barrages were eliminated and the knockout round was a modified double elimination round.<ref name=\"sports-reference\"/><ref name=OR640to41>Official Report, pp. 640\u201341.</ref>\n\n* Round 1: 6 pools, with 6 or 7 fencers in each pool. The top 4 fencers in each pool advanced, cutting the field from 38 to 24.\n* Round 2: 4 pools, with 6 fencers per pool. Again, the top 4 fencers advanced, reducing the number of remaining fencers from 24 to 16.\n* Knockout round: This was a modified double-elimination tournament. The 16 fencers were divided into 4 groups of 4. The winner of the \"winners bracket\" in each group advanced to the final pool. The winner of the \"losers bracket\" from each group faced the winner of a different group's \"losers bracket,\" with the winner of that match advancing to the final pool as well. The knockout round winnowed the fencers from 16 to 6.\n* Final round: A final pool with the 6 remaining fencers determined the medals and 4th through 6th place. A barrage was used if necessary.\n\n==Results==\n\n===Round 1===\n\n==== Round 1 Pool A ====\n\n<!-- -->{{#invoke:sports

[[fencing at the 1968 Summer Olympics]] programme. It was the tenth appearance of the event. The competition was held from 19 to 20 October 1968. 38 fencers from 16 nations competed.<ref name=\"sports-reference\">{{cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1968/FEN/womens-foil-individual.html |title=Fencing: 1968 Olympic Results - Women's foil |accessdate=23 December 2010 |work=sports-reference.com}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n==Competition format==\n\nThe 1968 tournament continued to use a mix of pool play and knockout rounds, but with substantial changes from 1964. The first two rounds were round-robin pool play, followed by a knockout round, finishing with another pool for the final. Early-round barrages were eliminated and the knockout round was a modified double elimination round.<ref name=\"sports-reference\"/><ref name=OR640to41>Official Report, pp. 640\u201341.</ref>\n\n* Round 1: 6 pools, with 6 or 7 fencers in each pool. The top 4 fencers in each pool advanced, cutting the field from 38 to 24.\n* Round 2: 4 pools, with 6 fencers per pool. Again, the top 4 fencers advanced, reducing the number of remaining fencers from 24 to 16.\n* Knockout round: This was a modified double-elimination tournament. The 16 fencers were divided into 4 groups of 4. The winner of the \"winners bracket\" in each group advanced to the final pool. The winner of the \"losers bracket\" from each group faced the winner of a different group's \"losers bracket,\" with the winner of that match advancing to the final pool as well. The knockout round winnowed the fencers from 16 to 6.\n* Final round: A final pool with the 6 remaining fencers determined the medals and 4th through 6th place. A barrage was used if necessary.\n\n==Results==\n\n===Round 1===\n\n==== Round 1 Pool A ====\n\n<!-- -->{{#invoke:sports

Part of the [[Ecclesiastical Province of Miami]], it covers much of North Florida, including the cities of [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]], [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], and [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]]. The bishop's seat is the [[Cathedral Basilica of St. Augustine]]; the current bishop is [[Felipe de Jes\u00fas Est\u00e9vez]].\n\n[[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] is the oldest continuously inhabited European-established settlement in the continental United States. The city was part of other dioceses until March 11, 1870, when the Diocese of St. Augustine was created. It covered most of the Florida peninsula until the 1950s, when Florida's expanding population necessitated the creation of new dioceses.\n\n==Bishops==\n\n===Bishops of Saint Augustine===\nThe list of ordinaries of the diocese and their years of service:\n# [[Augustin Verot]], [[Society of Saint-Sulpice|P.S.S.]] (1870\u20131876)\n# [[John Moore (bishop of St Augustine)|John Moore]] (1877\u20131901)\n# [[William John Kenny]] (1902\u20131913)\n# [[Michael Joseph Curley]] (1914\u20131921), appointed the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore|Archbishop of Baltimore-Washington]]\n# [[Patrick Joseph Barry]] (1922\u20131940)\n# [[Joseph Patrick Hurley]] (1940\u20131967)\n# [[Paul Francis Tanner]] (1968\u20131979)\n# [[John J.

He had been accompanied by four priests. [[Nombre de Dios (mission)]] is at the spot of the first Thanksgiving Mass celebrated on the grounds.\n\nMartin Francisco Lopez de Mendoza Grajales became first parish priest of St. Augustine, the first established parish in the United States. Pending the arrival of regular missionaries, Men\u00e9ndez appointed soldiers he deemed qualified to give religious instructions to the Indians.\n\nThe Jesuits were the first to arrive. Three were sent by [[Saint Francis Borgia, 4th Duke of Gand\u00eda|St. Francis Borgia]] in 1566 and ten in 1568. The few who survived the martyrdom of their brethren were recalled in 1572.\n\nIn 1577, the Franciscans arrived. In 1597, a young chief, smarting from a reprimand, instigated a general massacre of the missionaries.\n\nIn 1609, several Indian chiefs sought baptism at St. Augustine. Evangelizing became easier afterwards. This lasted past the middle of the century. In 1634, the Franciscan province of St. Helena, with mother-house at St. Augustine, contained 44 Indian missions, 35 missionaries, and 30,000 Roman Catholic Indians. By 1674, evidences of decline begin to appear. Bishop Calderon found his episcopal jurisdiction questioned by the friars. Although he confirmed many Indians, he complained of their religious ignorance.\n\nRelations between the colonists and natives worsened. The colony was menaced by the growing English power to the north. In 1704, the blow fell. Moore's raid burned, plundered, destroyed, and enslaved the natives at the [[Mission San Luis de Apalachee]].\n\nEfforts at re-establishment partially succeeded. By 1720, there were six towns of Roman Catholic Indians and several missions. Persistent conflict between the Spanish and English colonies reduced these to four missions with 136 people by 1763. The cession to England in 1763 resulted, not merely in the final extinction of the missions, but in the complete obliteration of Florida's ancient Roman Catholicity.\n[[File:Catholic Heritage Plaque.jpg|left|thumb|Catholic Heritage of Florida Plaque in Cathedral-Basilica]]\n\n===Formation of Dioceses===\nSt. Augustine began its existence as a regularly constituted parish of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santiago de Cuba|Diocese of Santiago de Cuba]]. Its church records, dating from 1594, are preserved in the archives of the present cathedral. The first recorded episcopal visitation was made by Bishop Cabeza de Altamirano in 1606. In 1674, Bishop [[Gabriel Diaz Vara Calderon]] visited the Floridian portion of his diocese; he conferred minor orders on seven candidates, and during an itinerary of eight months, extending to the Carolinian confines, confirmed 13,152 persons, founded many mission churches, and liberally supplied others. The permanent residence of Bishops-Auxiliary Resino (1709\u201310), Tejada (1735\u201345), and Ponce y Carasco (1751\u201355) at St. Augustine, demonstrates that, despite the waning condition of the colony and missions at this period, the Church in Florida continued episcopal oversight. Bishop Morell of Santiago, exiled from his see during the English occupation of Havana (1662\u201363), remained four months at St. Augustine, confirming 639 persons. When Florida in 1763 passed under English rule, freedom of worship was guaranteed, but the illiberal interpretation of officials resulted in the general exodus of Roman Catholics, so that by 1765, the bi-centenary year of the Church in Florida, a few defaced church buildings presented the only evidence of its former Catholicity. Five hundred survivors of the New Smyrna colony of 1,400 Roman Catholics, natives of Mediterranean lands, settled at St. Augustine in 1776 and preserved the Faith alive through a trying epoch. In 1787, Florida became subject to the newly constituted See of St. Christopher of Havana, and the following year Bishop [[Cyril de Barcelona]] found the church at St. Augustine progressing satisfactorily under the care of Fathers Hassett and O'Reilly, who had arrived on the retrocession of Florida to Spain in 1783.\n\nIn 1793, Pius VI established the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans|Diocese of Louisiana and the Floridas]], appointing the Right Rev. [[Luis Pe\u00f1alver y Cardenas]], with residence at New Orleans, as first bishop. After Bishop Pe\u00f1alver's promotion to the Archbishopric of Guatemala in 1801, no successor having been appointed, Louisiana, which was annexed to the United States in 1803, came under the jurisdiction of Bishop Carroll of Baltimore in 1806, the bishops of Havana reassuming authority over Florida until the appointment of the Rev. [[Michael Portier]] in 1825 to the new Vicariate of Alabama and Florida. Bishop Portier undertook single-handed the work of his vast vicariate, not having a single priest, until at his request, Bishop England of Charleston sent Father Edward Mayne to St. Augustine in 1828. In 1850, the See of Savannah was created and included that part of Florida which lies east of the Apalachicola River; this was constituted a separate vicariate in 1857 under the Right Rev. [[Augustin Verot]] as vicar apostolic and erected into the Diocese of St. Augustine in 1870, with Bishop Verot, who had occupied the See of Savannah since 1861, as first bishop. Bishop Verot's unwearied activity and zeal in promoting religion and education soon bore fruit; schools were opened by the Christian Brothers and the Sisters of Mercy in 1858, but the outbreak of the Civil War frustrated all hopes of success. In 1866, the [[Sisters of St. Joseph]] were introduced from France, and despite the most adverse conditions, they had several flourishing schools and academies in operation before many years. The era of progress inaugurated by Bishop Verot continued under the administration of Bishop [[John Moore (bishop of St Augustine)|John Moore]] (1877\u20131901), whose successor, the Right Rev. [[William John Kenny]], was consecrated by Cardinal Gibbons 18 May 1902, in the historic cathedral of St. Augustine. The Catholic population of the State, including 1750 coloured Catholics, is (1908) about 30,000. The Diocese of St. Augustine, wholly included within the State, contains about 25,000 Catholics; there are 49 priests with 40 churches and several missions, and 2897 young people under the care of [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]] teaching [[religious institute|institutes]]. That portion of the state situated west of the Apalachicola River forms part of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mobile|Diocese of Mobile]] since 1829; the Catholic population is about 5000, there are five churches with resident priests and 6 Catholic schools with 807 pupils; Pensacola, founded 1696, is the Catholic centre.\n\n{{catholic}}\n\n==Parishes==\nThere are 52 active parishes in the Diocese of St. Augustine.<ref name=\"Diocese of St. Augustine\">{{cite web|url= http://www.dosafl.com/find-a-parish/|title= Diocese of St. Augustine |last=|first=}}</ref>\n\n===Basilicas===\n*[[Basilica of the Immaculate Conception (Jacksonville)|Basilica of the Immaculate Conception]] - [[Pope Francis]] raised Immaculate Conception in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] to a [[Minor Basilica]] in 2013.<ref name=\"Florida Times Union\">{{cite web|url=http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2013-08-15/story/jacksonvilles-immaculate-conception-named-minor-basilica|title=Jacksonville's Immaculate Conception named a Minor Basilica|publisher=Florida Times Union|accessdate=2016-12-12|last=|first=}}</ref>\n*[[Cathedral Basilica of St. Augustine (St. Augustine, Florida)]] - Originally established in 1565 and re-built in the 18th century, it is the oldest church in Florida.\n\n== Arms ==\n{{Infobox COA wide\n|image             = CoA Roman Catholic Diocese of Diocese of St Augustine.svg\n|bannerimage       =\n|badgeimage        =\n|notes             = Arms was designed and adopted when the diocese was erected\n|year_adopted      = 1870\n|crest             =\n|torse             =\n|helm              =\n|escutcheon        =  The diocesan arms consists of background, quartered red (gules) and silver (argent).

The background, quartered red (gules) and silver (argent) are reminiscent of the Spanish roots of Florida and the see city of St. Augustine which was founded in 1565. In the royal arms of Spain the fields of Castile and Leon are of these tinctures.

Part of the [[Ecclesiastical Province of Miami]], it covers much of North Florida, including the cities of [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]], [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], and [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]]. The bishop's seat is the [[Cathedral Basilica of St. Augustine]]; the current bishop is [[Felipe de Jes\u00fas Est\u00e9vez]].\n\n[[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] is the oldest continuously inhabited European-established settlement in the continental United States. The city was part of other dioceses until March 11, 1870, when the Diocese of St. Augustine was created. It covered most of the Florida peninsula until the 1950s, when Florida's expanding population necessitated the creation of new dioceses.\n\n==Bishops==\n\n===Bishops of Saint Augustine===\nThe list of ordinaries of the diocese and their years of service:\n# [[Augustin Verot]], [[Society of Saint-Sulpice|P.S.S.]] (1870\u20131876)\n# [[John Moore (bishop of St Augustine)|John Moore]] (1877\u20131901)\n# [[William John Kenny]] (1902\u20131913)\n# [[Michael Joseph Curley]] (1914\u20131921), appointed the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore|Archbishop of Baltimore-Washington]]\n# [[Patrick Joseph Barry]] (1922\u20131940)\n# [[Joseph Patrick Hurley]] (1940\u20131967)\n# [[Paul Francis Tanner]] (1968\u20131979)\n# [[John J.

He had been accompanied by four priests. [[Nombre de Dios (mission)]] is at the spot of the first Thanksgiving Mass celebrated on the grounds.\n\nMartin Francisco Lopez de Mendoza Grajales became first parish priest of St. Augustine, the first established parish in the United States. Pending the arrival of regular missionaries, Men\u00e9ndez appointed soldiers he deemed qualified to give religious instructions to the Indians.\n\nThe Jesuits were the first to arrive. Three were sent by [[Saint Francis Borgia, 4th Duke of Gand\u00eda|St. Francis Borgia]] in 1566 and ten in 1568. The few who survived the martyrdom of their brethren were recalled in 1572.\n\nIn 1577, the Franciscans arrived. In 1597, a young chief, smarting from a reprimand, instigated a general massacre of the missionaries.\n\nIn 1609, several Indian chiefs sought baptism at St. Augustine. Evangelizing became easier afterwards. This lasted past the middle of the century. In 1634, the Franciscan province of St. Helena, with mother-house at St. Augustine, contained 44 Indian missions, 35 missionaries, and 30,000 Roman Catholic Indians. By 1674, evidences of decline begin to appear. Bishop Calderon found his episcopal jurisdiction questioned by the friars. Although he confirmed many Indians, he complained of their religious ignorance.\n\nRelations between the colonists and natives worsened. The colony was menaced by the growing English power to the north. In 1704, the blow fell. Moore's raid burned, plundered, destroyed, and enslaved the natives at the [[Mission San Luis de Apalachee]].\n\nEfforts at re-establishment partially succeeded. By 1720, there were six towns of Roman Catholic Indians and several missions. Persistent conflict between the Spanish and English colonies reduced these to four missions with 136 people by 1763. The cession to England in 1763 resulted, not merely in the final extinction of the missions, but in the complete obliteration of Florida's ancient Roman Catholicity.\n[[File:Catholic Heritage Plaque.jpg|left|thumb|Catholic Heritage of Florida Plaque in Cathedral-Basilica]]\n\n===Formation of Dioceses===\nSt. Augustine began its existence as a regularly constituted parish of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santiago de Cuba|Diocese of Santiago de Cuba]]. Its church records, dating from 1594, are preserved in the archives of the present cathedral. The first recorded episcopal visitation was made by Bishop Cabeza de Altamirano in 1606. In 1674, Bishop [[Gabriel Diaz Vara Calderon]] visited the Floridian portion of his diocese; he conferred minor orders on seven candidates, and during an itinerary of eight months, extending to the Carolinian confines, confirmed 13,152 persons, founded many mission churches, and liberally supplied others. The permanent residence of Bishops-Auxiliary Resino (1709\u201310), Tejada (1735\u201345), and Ponce y Carasco (1751\u201355) at St. Augustine, demonstrates that, despite the waning condition of the colony and missions at this period, the Church in Florida continued episcopal oversight. Bishop Morell of Santiago, exiled from his see during the English occupation of Havana (1662\u201363), remained four months at St. Augustine, confirming 639 persons. When Florida in 1763 passed under English rule, freedom of worship was guaranteed, but the illiberal interpretation of officials resulted in the general exodus of Roman Catholics, so that by 1765, the bi-centenary year of the Church in Florida, a few defaced church buildings presented the only evidence of its former Catholicity. Five hundred survivors of the New Smyrna colony of 1,400 Roman Catholics, natives of Mediterranean lands, settled at St. Augustine in 1776 and preserved the Faith alive through a trying epoch. In 1787, Florida became subject to the newly constituted See of St. Christopher of Havana, and the following year Bishop [[Cyril de Barcelona]] found the church at St. Augustine progressing satisfactorily under the care of Fathers Hassett and O'Reilly, who had arrived on the retrocession of Florida to Spain in 1783.\n\nIn 1793, Pius VI established the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans|Diocese of Louisiana and the Floridas]], appointing the Right Rev. [[Luis Pe\u00f1alver y Cardenas]], with residence at New Orleans, as first bishop. After Bishop Pe\u00f1alver's promotion to the Archbishopric of Guatemala in 1801, no successor having been appointed, Louisiana, which was annexed to the United States in 1803, came under the jurisdiction of Bishop Carroll of Baltimore in 1806, the bishops of Havana reassuming authority over Florida until the appointment of the Rev. [[Michael Portier]] in 1825 to the new Vicariate of Alabama and Florida. Bishop Portier undertook single-handed the work of his vast vicariate, not having a single priest, until at his request, Bishop England of Charleston sent Father Edward Mayne to St. Augustine in 1828. In 1850, the See of Savannah was created and included that part of Florida which lies east of the Apalachicola River; this was constituted a separate vicariate in 1857 under the Right Rev. [[Augustin Verot]] as vicar apostolic and erected into the Diocese of St. Augustine in 1870, with Bishop Verot, who had occupied the See of Savannah since 1861, as first bishop. Bishop Verot's unwearied activity and zeal in promoting religion and education soon bore fruit; schools were opened by the Christian Brothers and the Sisters of Mercy in 1858, but the outbreak of the Civil War frustrated all hopes of success. In 1866, the [[Sisters of St. Joseph]] were introduced from France, and despite the most adverse conditions, they had several flourishing schools and academies in operation before many years. The era of progress inaugurated by Bishop Verot continued under the administration of Bishop [[John Moore (bishop of St Augustine)|John Moore]] (1877\u20131901), whose successor, the Right Rev. [[William John Kenny]], was consecrated by Cardinal Gibbons 18 May 1902, in the historic cathedral of St. Augustine. The Catholic population of the State, including 1750 coloured Catholics, is (1908) about 30,000. The Diocese of St. Augustine, wholly included within the State, contains about 25,000 Catholics; there are 49 priests with 40 churches and several missions, and 2897 young people under the care of [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]] teaching [[religious institute|institutes]]. That portion of the state situated west of the Apalachicola River forms part of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mobile|Diocese of Mobile]] since 1829; the Catholic population is about 5000, there are five churches with resident priests and 6 Catholic schools with 807 pupils; Pensacola, founded 1696, is the Catholic centre.\n\n{{catholic}}\n\n==Parishes==\nThere are 52 active parishes in the Diocese of St. Augustine.<ref name=\"Diocese of St. Augustine\">{{cite web|url= http://www.dosafl.com/find-a-parish/|title= Diocese of St. Augustine |last=|first=}}</ref>\n\n===Basilicas===\n*[[Basilica of the Immaculate Conception (Jacksonville)|Basilica of the Immaculate Conception]] - [[Pope Francis]] raised Immaculate Conception in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] to a [[Minor Basilica]] in 2013.<ref name=\"Florida Times Union\">{{cite web|url=http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2013-08-15/story/jacksonvilles-immaculate-conception-named-minor-basilica|title=Jacksonville's Immaculate Conception named a Minor Basilica|publisher=Florida Times Union|accessdate=2016-12-12|last=|first=}}</ref>\n*[[Cathedral Basilica of St. Augustine (St. Augustine, Florida)]] - Originally established in 1565 and re-built in the 18th century, it is the oldest church in Florida.\n\n== Arms ==\n{{Infobox COA wide\n|image             = CoA Roman Catholic Diocese of Diocese of St Augustine.svg\n|bannerimage       =\n|badgeimage        =\n|notes             = Arms was designed and adopted when the diocese was erected\n|year_adopted      = 1870\n|crest             =\n|torse             =\n|helm              =\n|escutcheon        =  The diocesan arms consists of background, quartered red (gules) and silver (argent).

It consists of 39 primarily rural counties in the southern third of Missouri that include the urban areas of [[Springfield, Missouri|Springfield]] (the diocese headquarters), [[Branson, Missouri|Branson]] and [[Cape Girardeau, Missouri|Cape Girardeau]].\n\nThe diocese has two cathedrals: [[St. Agnes Cathedral (Springfield, Missouri)|St. Agnes Cathedral]] in Springfield and the [[Cathedral of St. Mary of the Annunciation (Cape Girardeau, Missouri)|Cathedral of St. Mary of the Annunciation]] in Cape Girardeau.  The two cathedrals are often (mistakenly) referred to as co-cathedrals.  The diocese established the Cape Girardeau cathedral as part of an eventual plan to create a separate diocese in Cape Girardeau.\n\nIn 1975, Bishop [[Bernard Francis Law]] sponsored the priests and brothers of the [[Congregation of the Mother Coredemptrix]] who arrived from [[Vietnam]], inviting them to buy a vacant [[Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate|Oblates of Mary Immaculate]] seminary, Our Lady of the Ozarks College in [[Carthage, Missouri|Carthage]], for $1, to use as their U.S. monastery and shrine to the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary]].<ref name=\"Sun Rivera\">{{cite news|title=Vietnamese Catholics on Ozarks pilgrimage Festival: During Marian Days, the faithful honor the Virgin Mary and reunite with family and friends|first=John|last=Rivera|location=Baltimore, Maryland|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|publisher=Tribune Company|date=1998-08-10|accessdate=2011-08-10|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-08-10/news/1998222073_1_carthage-vietnamese-culture-virgin-mary}}</ref> Since 1978, the shrine has hosted an annual [[Marian Days]] celebration, the largest Roman Catholic festival in the United States.<ref>[http://whispersintheloggia.blogspot.com/2007/08/asian-invasion-for-mary.html \"Asian Invasion\" -- for Mary]</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nThe diocese includes 66 parishes, 19 missions, 2 chapels, and, as of a 2003 estimate, 63,179 Catholics.

Rice]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Exterior of the Cathedral of St. Mary of the Annunciation Cape Girardeau, Missouri.JPG|thumb|left|Cathedral of St. Mary of the Annunciation, Cape Girardeau]]\nThe diocese was formed on August 24, 1956 from the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis|Archdiocese of St. Louis]] and the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint Joseph|Diocese of Kansas City]].   It consists of 39 primarily rural counties in the southern third of Missouri that include the urban areas of [[Springfield, Missouri|Springfield]] (the diocese headquarters), [[Branson, Missouri|Branson]] and [[Cape Girardeau, Missouri|Cape Girardeau]].\n\nThe diocese has two cathedrals: [[St. Agnes Cathedral (Springfield, Missouri)|St. Agnes Cathedral]] in Springfield and the [[Cathedral of St. Mary of the Annunciation (Cape Girardeau, Missouri)|Cathedral of St. Mary of the Annunciation]] in Cape Girardeau.  The two cathedrals are often (mistakenly) referred to as co-cathedrals.  The diocese established the Cape Girardeau cathedral as part of an eventual plan to create a separate diocese in Cape Girardeau.\n\nIn 1975, Bishop [[Bernard Francis Law]] sponsored the priests and brothers of the [[Congregation of the Mother Coredemptrix]] who arrived from [[Vietnam]], inviting them to buy a vacant [[Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate|Oblates of Mary Immaculate]] seminary, Our Lady of the Ozarks College in [[Carthage, Missouri|Carthage]], for $1, to use as their U.S. monastery and shrine to the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary]].<ref name=\"Sun Rivera\">{{cite news|title=Vietnamese Catholics on Ozarks pilgrimage Festival: During Marian Days, the faithful honor the Virgin Mary and reunite with family and friends|first=John|last=Rivera|location=Baltimore, Maryland|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|publisher=Tribune Company|date=1998-08-10|accessdate=2011-08-10|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-08-10/news/1998222073_1_carthage-vietnamese-culture-virgin-mary}}</ref> Since 1978, the shrine has hosted an annual [[Marian Days]] celebration, the largest Roman Catholic festival in the United States.<ref>[http://whispersintheloggia.blogspot.com/2007/08/asian-invasion-for-mary.html \"Asian Invasion\" -- for Mary]</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nThe diocese includes 66 parishes, 19 missions, 2 chapels, and, as of a 2003 estimate, 63,179 Catholics.
