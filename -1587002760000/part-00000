After being incorporated as a city in 1785 with an influx of British Loyalists from the northern of the former Thirteen Colonies and immigrants from Ireland, the city grew as a global hub for shipping and shipbuilding.<ref name=\"CanEncycl\" /> After the partitioning of the colony of Nova Scotia in 1784, the new colony of New Brunswick was thought to be named 'New Ireland' with the capital to be in Saint John before being vetoed by [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lib.unb.ca/winslow/partition.html|title=Winslow Papers: The Partition of Nova Scotia|website=lib.unb.ca}}</ref> In 1851 the city cemented itself as a global shipbuilding hub when the {{ship||Marco Polo|1851 ship|2}}, built from a Saint John yard, became the fastest in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://new-brunswick.net/marcopolo/historic.html |title=The Ship ''Marco Polo'' |accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Old Acadia Flag.svg|thumb|The flag of Acadia until 1713.]]\n\nHowever, the city would also struggle with its success.

Saint John Harbour, where the two rivers meet the Bay of Fundy, is a deep water port and ice-free all year long. Partridge Island is in the harbour.\n\nStonehammer [[UNESCO]] Geopark, the first Geopark in North America, is centred around Saint John. The Geopark has been recognized by UNESCO as having exceptional geological significance. The park contains rock formations throughout the Saint John region ranging billions of years.\n\n[[File:St Martins NB covered bridge.jpg|thumb|Covered bridges dot the Greater Saint John region.]]\n\nThe Saint John River itself flows into the [[Bay of Fundy]] through a narrow gorge several hundred feet wide at the centre of the city. It contains a unique phenomenon called the [[Reversing Falls]] where the diurnal tides of the bay reverse the water flow of the river for several kilometres. A series of underwater ledges at the narrowest point of this gorge also create a series of rapids.\n\nThe topography surrounding Saint John is hilly; a result of the influence of two coastal mountain ranges which run along the Bay of Fundy&nbsp;\u2013 the ''St. Croix Highlands'' and the ''Caledonia Highlands''. The soil throughout the region is extremely rocky with frequent granite outcrops. The coastal plain hosts numerous freshwater lakes in the eastern, western and northern parts of the city.\n\nIn Saint John the height difference from low to high [[tide]] is approximately 8 metres (28&nbsp;ft) due to the funnelling effect of the Bay of Fundy as it narrows. The Reversing Falls in Saint John, actually an area of strong rapids, provides one example of the power of these tides; at every high tide, ocean water is pushed through a narrow gorge in the middle of the city and forces the Saint John River to reverse its flow for several hours.\n\n===Neighbourhoods===\n[[File:SaintJohn1894.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Saint John from 1894, including the lower west (then Carleton), and uptown]]\nSaint John is a city of neighbourhoods, with residents closely identifying with their particular area.\n\n[[File:King Edward VII Memorial Bandstand.JPG|thumb|left|King Edward VII Memorial Bandstand]]\n\n====South (End) Central Peninsula\u2014Uptown====\nThe central peninsula on the east side of [[Saint John Harbour]] and the area immediately opposite on the west side are the sites of the original city, which resulted from the merger of Parrtown and Carleton. The western side of the central peninsula subsequently saw increased development and includes the central business district (CBD) and the [[Trinity Royal Heritage Conservation Area]], which together are referred to as \"Uptown\" by residents throughout the city. The term \"Uptown\" came about as people at the slips would go up the hill to the city. In addition, most of the central peninsula is situated on a hill. This central area of Saint John is only rarely called \"Downtown.\" The south end of the central peninsula, south of Duke Street, is appropriately called the South End.\n\n====North End (Portland/Millidgeville)====\nMuch of the North End is made up of the former city of Portland, a predominantly working class area north of the harbour along the Saint John River. Vessels navigating the Saint John River can only transit the Reversing Falls gorge at [[slack tide]], thus Portland became a location during the 19th and 20th centuries where tugboats and paddle wheelers could dock to wait. Being at the beginning of the navigable part of the Saint John River, Portland also became a major terminal for vessels departing to ply their trade upriver.\n\nFurther north of the central part of the city, and northeast of Portland, along the southern bank of the Kennebecasis River is the area of Millidgeville which is generally considered a neighbourhood separate from Portland. The boundary of Millidgeville is typically thought to begin at the \"Y\" intersection of Somerset Street and Millidge Ave or right after Tartan St. It is a middle to upper-class neighbourhood.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Located here is [[University of New Brunswick]], as well as New Brunswick's largest health care centre, the [[Saint John Regional Hospital]], and Saint John's only completely French school and community centre, [[\u00c9cole Samuel-de-Champlain|Centre Scolaire Communautaire Samuel-de-Champlain]].\n\nThe eastern area of the North End plays host to the city's largest park, and one of Canada's largest urban parks. [[Rockwood Park, Saint John|Rockwood Park]] encompasses {{convert|890|ha|abbr=on}} of upland Acadian mixed forest, many hills and several caves, as well as several freshwater lakes, with an extensive trail network, a golf course, and the [[Cherry Brook Zoo]]. The park was designed by [[Calvert Vaux]] in the mid-to-late 19th century. Mount Pleasant borders the park, and is generally seen as distinct from the traditionally poorer North End.\n\n===={{anchor|East Side}} East Side (Simonds/Loch Lomond)====\n\n[[File:Church, St. Johns.jpg|thumb|Our Lady of the Assumption Catholic Church in Saint John]]\n\nTo the east of the [[Courtney Bay]] / Forebay and south of [[New Brunswick Route 1]] is the East Side, where the city has experienced its greatest suburban sprawl in recent decades with commercial retail centres and residential subdivisions. There has been significant and consistent commercial and retail development in the Westmorland Road-McAllister Drive-Consumer's Drive-Major's Brook Drive-Retail Drive corridor since the 1970s, including McAllister Place, the city's largest shopping mall, which opened in 1978, and with active year-to-year development since 1994. The city's airport is further east on the coastal plain among several lakes at the far eastern edge of the municipality. Far east side is Loch Lomond, including several urban neighbourhoods found here, including Forest Hills, Champlain Heights, and Lakewood Heights. The malls were built by filling in Major's Brook (a tributary to Marsh Creek), making the area prone to flooding.\n\n====West Side (Carleton/Lancaster/Fairville)====\nThe portion of the city west of the Saint John River is collectively referred to as West Side, although West Saint Johners divide this area into several neighbourhoods. As mentioned previously, the Lower West Side is the former working-class neighbourhood known as Carleton at the time of the city's formation in 1785. West and north of the Lower West Side is the former city of Lancaster (commonly referred to as Saint John West), which was amalgamated into Saint John in 1967. The boundary was City Line Street, with the streets east considered to be the \"West Side\", and the streets west of City Kine Street having been renamed from Lancaster, NB to Saint John West, NB.\n\nThe southern part of Lancaster abutting [[Saint John Harbour]] and the Bay of Fundy is Bayshore and the location of [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]'s Bayshore Yard. The north end of Lancaster, known as Fairville, is home to [[Moosehead Brewery]] and older neighbourhoods clustered along Manawagonish Road. North of Fairville are the communities of [[Milford, New Brunswick|Milford]] and [[Randolph, New Brunswick|Randolph]]. Randolph, which is home to Dominion Park Beach, includes land on the city's largest island, and is joined by the Canal Bridge over Mosquito Cove on Greenhead Road. The area also contains the Irving Pulp and Paper mill, a highly visible manufacturing plant that sits next to the [[Reversing Falls]] and is owned and operated by [[J. D. Irving|J. D. Irving, Ltd.]]\n\nWest of Lancaster, the city hosts its second largest park, and one of the largest coastal urban parks in the country. The [[Irving Nature Park]], along Saints' Rest Beach, sits on an extensive peninsula called [[Taylor's Island, New Brunswick|Taylor's Island]] extending into the western part of the harbour into the Bay of Fundy. The park is partially open to vehicles in summer and features ocean views and walking trails through mixed forests.\n\n====Suburbs====\n\nSaint John's suburbs, just on the edge of the city limit, are [[Rothesay, New Brunswick|Rothesay]], [[Quispamsis]], and [[Grand Bay\u2013Westfield]]. Mainly residential, the suburbs have attracted many of Saint John's residents, leading the city's population to shrink.\n\n===Climate===\n{{climate chart\n| Saint John\n| \u221213.6 | \u22122.7 | 139\n| \u221212.7 | \u22121.9 |  94\n|  \u22127.3 |  2.3 | 118\n|  \u22121.2 |  8.3 | 104\n|   4.0 | 14.8 | 118\n|   8.4 | 19.5 | 101\n|  11.7 | 22.4 | 102\n|  11.6 | 22.2 |  90\n|   7.7 | 17.7 | 117\n|   2.7 | 11.9 | 125\n|  \u22122.1 |  6.0 | 134\n|  \u22129.7 |  0.3 | 149\n| float  = right\n| clear  = none\n| source = Environment Canada<ref>{{cite web\n| publisher = [[Environment Canada]]\n| url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?stnID=6250&prov=&lang=e&dCode=1&dispBack=1&StationName=saint_john&SearchType=Contains&province=ALL&provBut=&month1=0&month2=12\n| title = Saint John A\n| work = Canadian Climate Normals 1971\u20132000\n| accessdate = September 30, 2013}}</ref>}}\nThe climate of Saint John is [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''[[Humid continental climate#Dfb/Dwb/Dsb: Warm summer subtype|Dfb]]''). The Bay of Fundy never fully freezes, thus moderating the winter temperatures compared with inland locations. Even so, with the prevailing wind blowing from the west (from land to sea), the average January temperature is about {{convert|-8.2|C}}. Summers are usually warm to hot, and daytime temperatures often exceed {{convert|25|C}}. The highest temperature recorded in a given year is usually {{convert|30|or|31|C|0}}. The confluence of cold Bay of Fundy air and inland warmer temperatures often creates onshore winds that bring periods of fog and cooler temperatures during the summer months.\n\nPrecipitation in Saint John totals about {{convert|1295|mm|abbr=on}} annually and is well distributed throughout the year, although the late autumn and early winter are typically the wettest time of year.

But when the Great Irish Potato Famine raged between 1845 and 1852, huge waves of famine refugees flooded the city's shores. It is estimated that between 1845 and 1847, some 30,000 arrived, more people than were living in the city at the time. In 1847, dubbed \"[[Great Famine (Ireland)|Black 47]]\", one of the worst years of the famine, some 16,000 immigrants, most of them from Ireland, arrived at Partridge Island, the immigration and quarantine station at the mouth of Saint John Harbour.<ref>Thomas P.

Saint John has a long history of shipbuilding at the city's dry dock, which is one of the largest in the world. Since 2003 shipbuilding has ended on the scale it once was, forcing the city to adopt a new economic strategy. The University of New Brunswick, the New Brunswick Museum and the New Brunswick Community College are important institutions, and along with Radian6, Horizon Health Network and many others, they are a part of Saint John's fast-growing research and information-technology sectors. As the city moves away from its industrial past it now begins to capitalize on the growing sector of tourism, hosting over 1.5 million visitors a year and 200,000 cruise ship visitors a year, creating a renaissance in the city's historic downtown (locally known as uptown). Many small businesses have moved into Uptown and large scale waterfront developments are underway, such as the Fundy Quay (condo, hotel and office space), Saint John Law Courts, and the Three Sisters Harbourfront condos.\n\n===Arts & culture===\nThe arts and culture sector plays a large role in Saint John's economy. The Imperial Theatre is home to the highly acclaimed Saint John Theatre Company, and the Symphony New Brunswick and hosts a large collection of plays, concerts and other stage productions year-round. Harbour Station entertainment complex is home to the Saint John Sea Dogs of the QMJHL and the Saint John Riptide of the NBL.\n\nArt galleries in Saint John cover the uptown, more than any other Atlantic Canadian city. Artists like [[Miller Brittain]] and [[Fred Ross (artist)|Fred Ross]] have made Uptown Saint John their home, and now the torch has been passed to artists like Gerard Collins, Cliff Turner and Peter Salmon and their respective galleries. Uptown art galleries also include the Trinity Galleries, Citadel Gallery, Handworks Gallery and the Saint John Arts Centre (SJAC). The SJAC in the Carnegie Building hosts art exhibits, workshops, local songwriters' circles and other shows too small to be featured at the grand Imperial Theatre.\n\n===Heavy industry===\nSaint John maintains industrial infrastructure in the city's East side such as Canada's largest [[Irving Oil Refinery|oil refinery]]. Capitalist [[Kenneth Colin Irving|K.C. Irving]] and his family built his unfettered industrial conglomerate in the city by buying up mills, shipyards, media outlets, and other industrial infrastructure during the 20th century, and still continue to this day. Today Irving dominates the city and province with stakes in oil, forestry, shipbuilding, media and transportation. Irving companies remain dominant employers in the region with North America's first deepwater oil terminal,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/CAN_Saint_John_Port_130.php |title=Saint John Port |website=World Port Source |accessdate=January 10, 2019}}</ref> a pulp mill, a paper mill and a tissue paper plant.\n\nOther important economic activity in the city is generated by the [[Port of Saint John]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sjport.com/|title=Port Saint John|website=https://www.sjport.com/}}</ref>\n\nSaint John has a long history of brewers, such as Simeon Jones, The Olands, and James Ready. The city is now home to Moosehead Breweries, James Ready Brewing Co., Big Tide Brewing Co., Picaroon's and other craft brewers. The [[Moosehead Brewery]] (established in 1867, is Canada's only nationally distributed independent brewery [M. Nicholson]), James Ready Brewing Co., the [[New Brunswick Power Corporation]] which operates three electrical generating stations in the region including the [[Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station]], [[Bell Aliant]] which operates out of the former [[New Brunswick Telephone]] headquarters, the Horizon Health Network, which operates 5 hospitals in the Saint John area,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.horizonnb.ca/home/facilities-and-services/facilities.aspx?cat=1&type=hospital |title=Facilities: Hospitals |publisher=Horizon Health Services |accessdate=August 26, 2019}} Hospitals in the Saint John Region: Charlotte County Hospital, Grand Manan Hospital, Saint John Regional Hospital, St. Joseph's Hospital and Sussex Health Centre.</ref> and numerous [[information technology]] companies. There are also a number of [[call centres]] which were established in the 1990s under provincial government incentives.\n\n{{wide image|Stjohnpanoramo.jpg|1800px|View from Fort Howe of the Saint John skyline prior to Peel Plaza}}\n\n===Maritime activities===\n{{main|Port of Saint John}}\nUntil the first decade of the 21st century, Canada's largest shipyard (Irving Shipbuilding) had been an important employer in the city. During the 1980s-early 1990s the shipyard was responsible for building 9 of the 12 {{sclass-|Halifax|frigate|0}} multi-purpose patrol [[frigate]]s for the [[Canadian Forces Maritime Command|Canadian Navy]]. However, the Irvings closed the shipyard in 2003 and centralized in Halifax.\n\nPrior to the opening of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] in 1959, the Port of Saint John functioned as the winter port for [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] when shipping was unable to traverse the [[sea ice]] in the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] and [[St. Lawrence River]]. The [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] opened a line to Saint John from Montreal in 1889 across the state of [[Maine]] and transferred the majority of its trans-Atlantic passenger and cargo shipping to the port during the winter months. The port fell into decline following the seaway opening and the start of year-round [[icebreaker]] services in the 1960s. In 1994 CPR left Saint John when it sold the line to [[Short-line railroad|shortline]] operator [[New Brunswick Southern Railway]]. The [[Canadian National Railway]] still services Saint John with a secondary mainline from [[Moncton]]. Despite these setbacks, Port Saint John is the largest port by volume in Eastern Canada, at about 28 million metric tonnes of cargo per year, including [[Shipping container|containers]] and [[bulk cargo]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Port Saint John |url=https://www.sjport.com/ |accessdate=5 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Military===\nBesides being the location of several historical forts, such as Fort Howe, Fort Dufferin, Fort Latour, and the [[Carleton Martello Tower]], Saint John is the location of a number of reserve units of the [[Canadian Forces]].\n\n*[[Canadian Forces Naval Reserve|Naval Reserve]]\n** [[HMCS Brunswicker]]\n*[[37 Canadian Brigade Group]]\n** [[3rd Field Artillery Regiment, RCA]]: Regimental headquarters and 115th Field Battery (The Loyal Company)\n** [[Royal New Brunswick Regiment]] (Carleton & York): B Company\n** 37 Service Battalion: Battalion headquarters and a composite logistics company\n** 37 Signal Regiment: 2 Squadron\n\n==Labour==\n\n===Canada's first trade union===\nSaint John is often described as the birthplace of unionism in Canada and is one of the few pre-capitalist colonial settlements in North America. The city has a history of labour achievements and sparked the Canadian labour movement with Canada's first trade union, the Labourers' Benevolent Association (now International Longshoremen's Association Local 273). In 1849 the union was formed when Saint John's longshoremen banded together to lobby for regular pay and a shorter workday. One of their first resolutions was to apply to the city council for permission to erect the bell, which would announce the beginning and end of the labourers' 10-hour workday. As the bell shears were hardly finished when capitalists and merchants in the city objected to the bell and successfully lobbied city hall to keep the bell from being put up. But then, citizens and longshoremen defied the order and erected a larger bell and merchants withdrew their opposition to the \"Labourers' Bell\". ILA Local 273 remain one of the city's strongest trade unions to this day.<ref>{{cite web|title=For Whom The Bells Toll|url=http://www.wfhathewaylabourexhibitcentre.ca/labour-history/for-whom-the-bells-toll/|publisher=Hatheway Labour Exhibit Center|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===The Saint John Street Railwaymen\u2019s strike and riot of 1914===\nThe [[1914 Saint John street railway strike]] (sometimes called the ''Saint John street railwaymen's strike'')<ref name=Babcock>{{cite journal |last=Babcock |first=Robert H. |date=January 1982 |title=The Saint John Street Railwaymen's Strike and Riot, 1914 |url=https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/Acadiensis/article/view/11570/0 |journal=[[Acadiensis]] |publisher=[[University of New Brunswick]] |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages= |issn=0044-5851 |access-date=May 13, 2016}}</ref> was a [[strike action|strike]] by workers on the street railway system in the city which lasted from July 22\u201324, 1914, with rioting by Saint John inhabitants occurring on July 23 and 24. The strike was important for shattering the image of Saint John as a conservative town dominated primarily by ethnic and religious (rather than class) divisions, and highlighting tensions between railway industrialists and the local working population.\n\n[[File:1914 Saint John riot aftermath.jpg|thumb|1914 Saint John Railwaymen's Strike riot]]\n\n===October 14, 1976 - the Saint John General Strike===\nThe Saint John General Strike of 1976 was a result of the Bill C-73 passed by Prime Minister of Canada, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, and the House of Commons in Ottawa on October 14, 1975. This bill limited wage increases to 8% the first year, 6% the second year, and 4% the third year after its enactment. Most provinces of Canada accepted the bill by spring of 1976, but within eighteen months they began to withdraw from the program. After its introduction in 1975, it was not until 1976 that the Anti-Inflation Board (AIB) began to roll back workers' wages. The employees of Irving Pulp and Paper, members of the Canadian Paper Workers Union, were among the first to experience the roll backs implemented by the AIB. The paper workers were required to give back to the employer 9.8% of their previous wage increase the first year, and 11% the second year. The Atlantic Sugar Refinery workers of the Bakery and Confectionary Workers International Union of America soon felt the burden as well. The majority of workers within Saint John were influenced by the AIB by January 1976. On February 5, 1976, the Saint John District and the Labour Council held a conference to plan an organized opposition to the AIB. Fifty-two people came to the meeting as representatives of twenty-six unions in Saint John. The council was led by the Labour Council president, George Vair. They began by educating those present on wage control legislation, but swiftly transitioned into rallying and demonstrating in opposition throughout the city. Five thousand marched from numerous ends of the town to King Square. All major industries in Saint John were shut down.<ref>{{cite web|title=Canadian workers strike against wage controls, 1976|url=http://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/canadian-workers-strike-against-wage-controls-1976|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===The Irving Oil Refinery strike, 1994-96===\nOn May 12, 1994, at 4:30 pm, members of Local 691 of the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers (CEP) union at the Irving Oil Ltd. Refinery went on strike. At this time the refinery's management took over its operations. Irving had argued the refinery might have to shut down and had to bring in a bevy of rollbacks to the workers\u2019 pay and benefits and other changes to the collective agreement. Local 691 argued Irving simply wished to lengthen the work week without paying workers overtime rates. The strike lasted 27 months and was based on Irving\u2019s demands for flexibility of the workers to ensure the refinery was competitive. The strike is seen as symbolic of a rollback of labour and democratic collective bargaining rights that have been in decline across North America.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Steuter|first1=Erin|last2=Martin|first2=Geoff|title=The Myth of the Competitive Challenge: The Irving Oil Refinery Strike, 1994\u201396 and the Canadian Petroleum Industry|url=http://spe.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/spe/article/view/6728|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Uptown Saint John, from Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|Looking east on the Saint John Throughway, right before the Harbour Bridge and the now closed (since 2011) toll plaza]]\n[[File:June 2009 Saint John Transit Bus.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Saint John Transit]] bus in uptown]]\n\n===Air===\nAir service into Saint John is provided by the [[Saint John Airport|Saint John Airport/A\u00e9roport de Saint-Jean]], near Loch Lomond {{convert|8|NM|lk=in}} east northeast of the central business district<ref name=\"CFS\">{{CFS}}</ref> or approximately {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}} by road northeast of the city centre.

In 1968 UNBSJ opened a new campus in the city's Tucker Park neighbourhood. This campus has undergone expansion over the years and is the fastest growing component of the UNB system with many new buildings constructed from the 1970s to the first decade of the 21st century. A trend in recent years has been a growth in the number of international students. The city also hosts a [[New Brunswick Community College]] campus in the East End of the city. There has also been a satellite campus of [[Dalhousie Medical School]] added within the UNBSJ campus in 2010, instructing 30 medical students each year.\n\nIn the fall of 2007, a report commissioned by the provincial government recommended UNBSJ and the NBCC be reformed and consolidated into a new polytechnic post-secondary institute. The proposal immediately came under heavy criticism and led to the organizing of several protests in the uptown area, citing the diminishment of UNB as a nationally accredited university, the reduction in accessibility to receive degrees \u2013 and these are only a couple of the reasons why the community was enraged by the recommendation. Support for keeping UNBSJ as it was, and expanding the university under its current structure, fell slightly below 90%. Seeing too much political capital would be lost, and several Saint John MPs were likely not to support the initiative if the policies recommended by the report were legislated, the government abandoned the commission's report and created an intra-provincial post-secondary commission.\n\nSaint John is served by two school boards: [[Anglophone South School District]] schools and [[Francophone Sud School District]] (based out of [[Dieppe, New Brunswick|Dieppe]], [[New Brunswick]]) for the city's only Francophone school, [[\u00c9cole Samuel-de-Champlain|Centre-Scolaire-Communautaire Samuel-de-Champlain]]. Saint John is also home to Canada's oldest publicly funded school, [[Saint John High School]]. The other high schools in the city are [[Harbour View High School]], [[St. Malachy's High School]], and [[Simonds High School]].\n\n==Media==\n{{Main|Media in Saint John, New Brunswick}}\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Main|List of people from Saint John, New Brunswick}}\n\n==Twin/sister cities==\n\n* {{flagicon|SLO}} [[Koper]], Slovenia<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/iiapublications/SmartBook/Documents/abbd6fd3-4149-4206-8731-eb53a3ffdc31/abbd6fd3-4149-4206-8731-eb53a3ffdc31.pdf |title=Report:  Visit of the Honourable No\u00ebl A.

Saint John Harbour, where the two rivers meet the Bay of Fundy, is a deep water port and ice-free all year long. Partridge Island is in the harbour.\n\nStonehammer [[UNESCO]] Geopark, the first Geopark in North America, is centred around Saint John. The Geopark has been recognized by UNESCO as having exceptional geological significance. The park contains rock formations throughout the Saint John region ranging billions of years.\n\n[[File:St Martins NB covered bridge.jpg|thumb|Covered bridges dot the Greater Saint John region.]]\n\nThe Saint John River itself flows into the [[Bay of Fundy]] through a narrow gorge several hundred feet wide at the centre of the city. It contains a unique phenomenon called the [[Reversing Falls]] where the diurnal tides of the bay reverse the water flow of the river for several kilometres. A series of underwater ledges at the narrowest point of this gorge also create a series of rapids.\n\nThe topography surrounding Saint John is hilly; a result of the influence of two coastal mountain ranges which run along the Bay of Fundy&nbsp;\u2013 the ''St. Croix Highlands'' and the ''Caledonia Highlands''. The soil throughout the region is extremely rocky with frequent granite outcrops. The coastal plain hosts numerous freshwater lakes in the eastern, western and northern parts of the city.\n\nIn Saint John the height difference from low to high [[tide]] is approximately 8 metres (28&nbsp;ft) due to the funnelling effect of the Bay of Fundy as it narrows. The Reversing Falls in Saint John, actually an area of strong rapids, provides one example of the power of these tides; at every high tide, ocean water is pushed through a narrow gorge in the middle of the city and forces the Saint John River to reverse its flow for several hours.\n\n===Neighbourhoods===\n[[File:SaintJohn1894.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Saint John from 1894, including the lower west (then Carleton), and uptown]]\nSaint John is a city of neighbourhoods, with residents closely identifying with their particular area.\n\n[[File:King Edward VII Memorial Bandstand.JPG|thumb|left|King Edward VII Memorial Bandstand]]\n\n====South (End) Central Peninsula\u2014Uptown====\nThe central peninsula on the east side of [[Saint John Harbour]] and the area immediately opposite on the west side are the sites of the original city, which resulted from the merger of Parrtown and Carleton. The western side of the central peninsula subsequently saw increased development and includes the central business district (CBD) and the [[Trinity Royal Heritage Conservation Area]], which together are referred to as \"Uptown\" by residents throughout the city. The term \"Uptown\" came about as people at the slips would go up the hill to the city. In addition, most of the central peninsula is situated on a hill. This central area of Saint John is only rarely called \"Downtown.\" The south end of the central peninsula, south of Duke Street, is appropriately called the South End.\n\n====North End (Portland/Millidgeville)====\nMuch of the North End is made up of the former city of Portland, a predominantly working class area north of the harbour along the Saint John River. Vessels navigating the Saint John River can only transit the Reversing Falls gorge at [[slack tide]], thus Portland became a location during the 19th and 20th centuries where tugboats and paddle wheelers could dock to wait. Being at the beginning of the navigable part of the Saint John River, Portland also became a major terminal for vessels departing to ply their trade upriver.\n\nFurther north of the central part of the city, and northeast of Portland, along the southern bank of the Kennebecasis River is the area of Millidgeville which is generally considered a neighbourhood separate from Portland. The boundary of Millidgeville is typically thought to begin at the \"Y\" intersection of Somerset Street and Millidge Ave or right after Tartan St. It is a middle to upper-class neighbourhood.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Located here is [[University of New Brunswick]], as well as New Brunswick's largest health care centre, the [[Saint John Regional Hospital]], and Saint John's only completely French school and community centre, [[\u00c9cole Samuel-de-Champlain|Centre Scolaire Communautaire Samuel-de-Champlain]].\n\nThe eastern area of the North End plays host to the city's largest park, and one of Canada's largest urban parks. [[Rockwood Park, Saint John|Rockwood Park]] encompasses {{convert|890|ha|abbr=on}} of upland Acadian mixed forest, many hills and several caves, as well as several freshwater lakes, with an extensive trail network, a golf course, and the [[Cherry Brook Zoo]]. The park was designed by [[Calvert Vaux]] in the mid-to-late 19th century. Mount Pleasant borders the park, and is generally seen as distinct from the traditionally poorer North End.\n\n===={{anchor|East Side}} East Side (Simonds/Loch Lomond)====\n\n[[File:Church, St. Johns.jpg|thumb|Our Lady of the Assumption Catholic Church in Saint John]]\n\nTo the east of the [[Courtney Bay]] / Forebay and south of [[New Brunswick Route 1]] is the East Side, where the city has experienced its greatest suburban sprawl in recent decades with commercial retail centres and residential subdivisions. There has been significant and consistent commercial and retail development in the Westmorland Road-McAllister Drive-Consumer's Drive-Major's Brook Drive-Retail Drive corridor since the 1970s, including McAllister Place, the city's largest shopping mall, which opened in 1978, and with active year-to-year development since 1994. The city's airport is further east on the coastal plain among several lakes at the far eastern edge of the municipality. Far east side is Loch Lomond, including several urban neighbourhoods found here, including Forest Hills, Champlain Heights, and Lakewood Heights. The malls were built by filling in Major's Brook (a tributary to Marsh Creek), making the area prone to flooding.\n\n====West Side (Carleton/Lancaster/Fairville)====\nThe portion of the city west of the Saint John River is collectively referred to as West Side, although West Saint Johners divide this area into several neighbourhoods. As mentioned previously, the Lower West Side is the former working-class neighbourhood known as Carleton at the time of the city's formation in 1785. West and north of the Lower West Side is the former city of Lancaster (commonly referred to as Saint John West), which was amalgamated into Saint John in 1967. The boundary was City Line Street, with the streets east considered to be the \"West Side\", and the streets west of City Kine Street having been renamed from Lancaster, NB to Saint John West, NB.\n\nThe southern part of Lancaster abutting [[Saint John Harbour]] and the Bay of Fundy is Bayshore and the location of [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]'s Bayshore Yard. The north end of Lancaster, known as Fairville, is home to [[Moosehead Brewery]] and older neighbourhoods clustered along Manawagonish Road. North of Fairville are the communities of [[Milford, New Brunswick|Milford]] and [[Randolph, New Brunswick|Randolph]]. Randolph, which is home to Dominion Park Beach, includes land on the city's largest island, and is joined by the Canal Bridge over Mosquito Cove on Greenhead Road. The area also contains the Irving Pulp and Paper mill, a highly visible manufacturing plant that sits next to the [[Reversing Falls]] and is owned and operated by [[J. D. Irving|J. D. Irving, Ltd.]]\n\nWest of Lancaster, the city hosts its second largest park, and one of the largest coastal urban parks in the country. The [[Irving Nature Park]], along Saints' Rest Beach, sits on an extensive peninsula called [[Taylor's Island, New Brunswick|Taylor's Island]] extending into the western part of the harbour into the Bay of Fundy. The park is partially open to vehicles in summer and features ocean views and walking trails through mixed forests.\n\n====Suburbs====\n\nSaint John's suburbs, just on the edge of the city limit, are [[Rothesay, New Brunswick|Rothesay]], [[Quispamsis]], and [[Grand Bay\u2013Westfield]]. Mainly residential, the suburbs have attracted many of Saint John's residents, leading the city's population to shrink.\n\n===Climate===\n{{climate chart\n| Saint John\n| \u221213.6 | \u22122.7 | 139\n| \u221212.7 | \u22121.9 |  94\n|  \u22127.3 |  2.3 | 118\n|  \u22121.2 |  8.3 | 104\n|   4.0 | 14.8 | 118\n|   8.4 | 19.5 | 101\n|  11.7 | 22.4 | 102\n|  11.6 | 22.2 |  90\n|   7.7 | 17.7 | 117\n|   2.7 | 11.9 | 125\n|  \u22122.1 |  6.0 | 134\n|  \u22129.7 |  0.3 | 149\n| float  = right\n| clear  = none\n| source = Environment Canada<ref>{{cite web\n| publisher = [[Environment Canada]]\n| url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?stnID=6250&prov=&lang=e&dCode=1&dispBack=1&StationName=saint_john&SearchType=Contains&province=ALL&provBut=&month1=0&month2=12\n| title = Saint John A\n| work = Canadian Climate Normals 1971\u20132000\n| accessdate = September 30, 2013}}</ref>}}\nThe climate of Saint John is [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''[[Humid continental climate#Dfb/Dwb/Dsb: Warm summer subtype|Dfb]]''). The Bay of Fundy never fully freezes, thus moderating the winter temperatures compared with inland locations. Even so, with the prevailing wind blowing from the west (from land to sea), the average January temperature is about {{convert|-8.2|C}}. Summers are usually warm to hot, and daytime temperatures often exceed {{convert|25|C}}. The highest temperature recorded in a given year is usually {{convert|30|or|31|C|0}}. The confluence of cold Bay of Fundy air and inland warmer temperatures often creates onshore winds that bring periods of fog and cooler temperatures during the summer months.\n\nPrecipitation in Saint John totals about {{convert|1295|mm|abbr=on}} annually and is well distributed throughout the year, although the late autumn and early winter are typically the wettest time of year.

But when the Great Irish Potato Famine raged between 1845 and 1852, huge waves of famine refugees flooded the city's shores. It is estimated that between 1845 and 1847, some 30,000 arrived, more people than were living in the city at the time. In 1847, dubbed \"[[Great Famine (Ireland)|Black 47]]\", one of the worst years of the famine, some 16,000 immigrants, most of them from Ireland, arrived at Partridge Island, the immigration and quarantine station at the mouth of Saint John Harbour.<ref>Thomas P.

The largest visible minority groups were [[Black people|Black]] (2.1%), [[Chinese people|Chinese]] (1.4%), [[Arabs|Arab]] (0.9%), and [[South Asian People|South Asian]] (0.7%). 5% of Saint Johners are francophone.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=POPC&Code1=0734&Geo2=PR&Code2=13&SearchText=Saint+John&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=Language&TABID=1&type=0 |publisher=Statistics Canada |accessdate=15 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nWith regard to religion, 89.2% identify as Christian (47.6% Protestant, 40.3% Roman Catholic, and 1.3% other Christian, mostly [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and independent churches). 10.1% state no religious affiliation, and other religions including [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Hinduism]] together comprise less than 1%.\n\n==Municipal government (Common Council)==\n{{See also|List of mayors of Saint John, New Brunswick}}\n\nSaint John is one of five chartered cities in Canada, giving it unique legislative powers.<ref name=\"policyschool\">{{cite web |title=Is \u2018Charter-City Status\u2019 a Solution for Financing City Services in Canada \u2014 Or is that a Myth? |url=https://www.policyschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/charter-city-status-kitchen_0.pdf |publisher=University of Calgary |accessdate=21 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Responsibility===\nSaint John is governed by a body of elected officials, referred to as \"Common Council\", whose responsibilities include:\n* Setting the city operational budget\n* Setting the City Water utility budget/ rates\n* Enacting and amending by-laws\n* Rezoning and land-use permissions of properties in Saint John.\n* Setting the capital budget for the city\n* Acting as the Board of Directors for the corporation \"City of Saint John\"\n* Appointing persons to city staff and commissions\n* Overseeing the operation of city commissions and departments\n\n===Composition===\n{{Main|Saint John City Council}}\nThe Common Council consists of:\n* The Mayor, who runs at-large, acts as Chairman of the Board.\n* Two at-large Common Councillors.\n* Two Common Councillors, from each of the city's four wards.\nOne is elected by the council to serve as Deputy Mayor.\n\nAs of 2017, the Council's members are:\n* Mayor: Don Darling\n* Deputy Mayor: [[Shirley McAlary]]\n* Councillor at Large: Gary Sullivan\n* Ward 1: Blake Armstrong, Greg Norton\n* Ward 2: John MacKenzie, Sean Casey\n* Ward 3: Donna Reardon, David Hickey\n* Ward 4: Ray Strowbridge, David Meritthew\n\nIn the [[2007 Saint John, New Brunswick Ward Plebiscite|October 9, 2007 Plebiscite]], it was decided that as of the May 2008 quadrennial municipal elections, the city will be divided into four wards of approximately equal population, with two councillors to be elected by the voters in that ward, and two councillors to be elected at large.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Colsen cove park 009.jpg|thumb|Colsen Cove generating station]]\n[[File:Old Post Office Saint John.JPG|thumb|The Old Post Office]]\nSaint John derived its economy from maritime industries such as shipping, fishing and shipbuilding. Saint John has a long history of shipbuilding at the city's dry dock, which is one of the largest in the world. Since 2003 shipbuilding has ended on the scale it once was, forcing the city to adopt a new economic strategy. The University of New Brunswick, the New Brunswick Museum and the New Brunswick Community College are important institutions, and along with Radian6, Horizon Health Network and many others, they are a part of Saint John's fast-growing research and information-technology sectors. As the city moves away from its industrial past it now begins to capitalize on the growing sector of tourism, hosting over 1.5 million visitors a year and 200,000 cruise ship visitors a year, creating a renaissance in the city's historic downtown (locally known as uptown). Many small businesses have moved into Uptown and large scale waterfront developments are underway, such as the Fundy Quay (condo, hotel and office space), Saint John Law Courts, and the Three Sisters Harbourfront condos.\n\n===Arts & culture===\nThe arts and culture sector plays a large role in Saint John's economy. The Imperial Theatre is home to the highly acclaimed Saint John Theatre Company, and the Symphony New Brunswick and hosts a large collection of plays, concerts and other stage productions year-round. Harbour Station entertainment complex is home to the Saint John Sea Dogs of the QMJHL and the Saint John Riptide of the NBL.\n\nArt galleries in Saint John cover the uptown, more than any other Atlantic Canadian city. Artists like [[Miller Brittain]] and [[Fred Ross (artist)|Fred Ross]] have made Uptown Saint John their home, and now the torch has been passed to artists like Gerard Collins, Cliff Turner and Peter Salmon and their respective galleries. Uptown art galleries also include the Trinity Galleries, Citadel Gallery, Handworks Gallery and the Saint John Arts Centre (SJAC). The SJAC in the Carnegie Building hosts art exhibits, workshops, local songwriters' circles and other shows too small to be featured at the grand Imperial Theatre.\n\n===Heavy industry===\nSaint John maintains industrial infrastructure in the city's East side such as Canada's largest [[Irving Oil Refinery|oil refinery]]. Capitalist [[Kenneth Colin Irving|K.C. Irving]] and his family built his unfettered industrial conglomerate in the city by buying up mills, shipyards, media outlets, and other industrial infrastructure during the 20th century, and still continue to this day. Today Irving dominates the city and province with stakes in oil, forestry, shipbuilding, media and transportation. Irving companies remain dominant employers in the region with North America's first deepwater oil terminal,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/CAN_Saint_John_Port_130.php |title=Saint John Port |website=World Port Source |accessdate=January 10, 2019}}</ref> a pulp mill, a paper mill and a tissue paper plant.\n\nOther important economic activity in the city is generated by the [[Port of Saint John]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sjport.com/|title=Port Saint John|website=https://www.sjport.com/}}</ref>\n\nSaint John has a long history of brewers, such as Simeon Jones, The Olands, and James Ready. The city is now home to Moosehead Breweries, James Ready Brewing Co., Big Tide Brewing Co., Picaroon's and other craft brewers. The [[Moosehead Brewery]] (established in 1867, is Canada's only nationally distributed independent brewery [M. Nicholson]), James Ready Brewing Co., the [[New Brunswick Power Corporation]] which operates three electrical generating stations in the region including the [[Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station]], [[Bell Aliant]] which operates out of the former [[New Brunswick Telephone]] headquarters, the Horizon Health Network, which operates 5 hospitals in the Saint John area,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.horizonnb.ca/home/facilities-and-services/facilities.aspx?cat=1&type=hospital |title=Facilities: Hospitals |publisher=Horizon Health Services |accessdate=August 26, 2019}} Hospitals in the Saint John Region: Charlotte County Hospital, Grand Manan Hospital, Saint John Regional Hospital, St. Joseph's Hospital and Sussex Health Centre.</ref> and numerous [[information technology]] companies. There are also a number of [[call centres]] which were established in the 1990s under provincial government incentives.\n\n{{wide image|Stjohnpanoramo.jpg|1800px|View from Fort Howe of the Saint John skyline prior to Peel Plaza}}\n\n===Maritime activities===\n{{main|Port of Saint John}}\nUntil the first decade of the 21st century, Canada's largest shipyard (Irving Shipbuilding) had been an important employer in the city. During the 1980s-early 1990s the shipyard was responsible for building 9 of the 12 {{sclass-|Halifax|frigate|0}} multi-purpose patrol [[frigate]]s for the [[Canadian Forces Maritime Command|Canadian Navy]]. However, the Irvings closed the shipyard in 2003 and centralized in Halifax.\n\nPrior to the opening of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] in 1959, the Port of Saint John functioned as the winter port for [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] when shipping was unable to traverse the [[sea ice]] in the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] and [[St. Lawrence River]]. The [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] opened a line to Saint John from Montreal in 1889 across the state of [[Maine]] and transferred the majority of its trans-Atlantic passenger and cargo shipping to the port during the winter months. The port fell into decline following the seaway opening and the start of year-round [[icebreaker]] services in the 1960s. In 1994 CPR left Saint John when it sold the line to [[Short-line railroad|shortline]] operator [[New Brunswick Southern Railway]]. The [[Canadian National Railway]] still services Saint John with a secondary mainline from [[Moncton]]. Despite these setbacks, Port Saint John is the largest port by volume in Eastern Canada, at about 28 million metric tonnes of cargo per year, including [[Shipping container|containers]] and [[bulk cargo]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Port Saint John |url=https://www.sjport.com/ |accessdate=5 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Military===\nBesides being the location of several historical forts, such as Fort Howe, Fort Dufferin, Fort Latour, and the [[Carleton Martello Tower]], Saint John is the location of a number of reserve units of the [[Canadian Forces]].\n\n*[[Canadian Forces Naval Reserve|Naval Reserve]]\n** [[HMCS Brunswicker]]\n*[[37 Canadian Brigade Group]]\n** [[3rd Field Artillery Regiment, RCA]]: Regimental headquarters and 115th Field Battery (The Loyal Company)\n** [[Royal New Brunswick Regiment]] (Carleton & York): B Company\n** 37 Service Battalion: Battalion headquarters and a composite logistics company\n** 37 Signal Regiment: 2 Squadron\n\n==Labour==\n\n===Canada's first trade union===\nSaint John is often described as the birthplace of unionism in Canada and is one of the few pre-capitalist colonial settlements in North America. The city has a history of labour achievements and sparked the Canadian labour movement with Canada's first trade union, the Labourers' Benevolent Association (now International Longshoremen's Association Local 273). In 1849 the union was formed when Saint John's longshoremen banded together to lobby for regular pay and a shorter workday. One of their first resolutions was to apply to the city council for permission to erect the bell, which would announce the beginning and end of the labourers' 10-hour workday. As the bell shears were hardly finished when capitalists and merchants in the city objected to the bell and successfully lobbied city hall to keep the bell from being put up. But then, citizens and longshoremen defied the order and erected a larger bell and merchants withdrew their opposition to the \"Labourers' Bell\". ILA Local 273 remain one of the city's strongest trade unions to this day.<ref>{{cite web|title=For Whom The Bells Toll|url=http://www.wfhathewaylabourexhibitcentre.ca/labour-history/for-whom-the-bells-toll/|publisher=Hatheway Labour Exhibit Center|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===The Saint John Street Railwaymen\u2019s strike and riot of 1914===\nThe [[1914 Saint John street railway strike]] (sometimes called the ''Saint John street railwaymen's strike'')<ref name=Babcock>{{cite journal |last=Babcock |first=Robert H. |date=January 1982 |title=The Saint John Street Railwaymen's Strike and Riot, 1914 |url=https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/Acadiensis/article/view/11570/0 |journal=[[Acadiensis]] |publisher=[[University of New Brunswick]] |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages= |issn=0044-5851 |access-date=May 13, 2016}}</ref> was a [[strike action|strike]] by workers on the street railway system in the city which lasted from July 22\u201324, 1914, with rioting by Saint John inhabitants occurring on July 23 and 24. The strike was important for shattering the image of Saint John as a conservative town dominated primarily by ethnic and religious (rather than class) divisions, and highlighting tensions between railway industrialists and the local working population.\n\n[[File:1914 Saint John riot aftermath.jpg|thumb|1914 Saint John Railwaymen's Strike riot]]\n\n===October 14, 1976 - the Saint John General Strike===\nThe Saint John General Strike of 1976 was a result of the Bill C-73 passed by Prime Minister of Canada, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, and the House of Commons in Ottawa on October 14, 1975. This bill limited wage increases to 8% the first year, 6% the second year, and 4% the third year after its enactment. Most provinces of Canada accepted the bill by spring of 1976, but within eighteen months they began to withdraw from the program. After its introduction in 1975, it was not until 1976 that the Anti-Inflation Board (AIB) began to roll back workers' wages. The employees of Irving Pulp and Paper, members of the Canadian Paper Workers Union, were among the first to experience the roll backs implemented by the AIB. The paper workers were required to give back to the employer 9.8% of their previous wage increase the first year, and 11% the second year. The Atlantic Sugar Refinery workers of the Bakery and Confectionary Workers International Union of America soon felt the burden as well. The majority of workers within Saint John were influenced by the AIB by January 1976. On February 5, 1976, the Saint John District and the Labour Council held a conference to plan an organized opposition to the AIB. Fifty-two people came to the meeting as representatives of twenty-six unions in Saint John. The council was led by the Labour Council president, George Vair. They began by educating those present on wage control legislation, but swiftly transitioned into rallying and demonstrating in opposition throughout the city. Five thousand marched from numerous ends of the town to King Square. All major industries in Saint John were shut down.<ref>{{cite web|title=Canadian workers strike against wage controls, 1976|url=http://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/canadian-workers-strike-against-wage-controls-1976|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===The Irving Oil Refinery strike, 1994-96===\nOn May 12, 1994, at 4:30 pm, members of Local 691 of the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers (CEP) union at the Irving Oil Ltd. Refinery went on strike. At this time the refinery's management took over its operations. Irving had argued the refinery might have to shut down and had to bring in a bevy of rollbacks to the workers\u2019 pay and benefits and other changes to the collective agreement. Local 691 argued Irving simply wished to lengthen the work week without paying workers overtime rates. The strike lasted 27 months and was based on Irving\u2019s demands for flexibility of the workers to ensure the refinery was competitive. The strike is seen as symbolic of a rollback of labour and democratic collective bargaining rights that have been in decline across North America.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Steuter|first1=Erin|last2=Martin|first2=Geoff|title=The Myth of the Competitive Challenge: The Irving Oil Refinery Strike, 1994\u201396 and the Canadian Petroleum Industry|url=http://spe.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/spe/article/view/6728|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Uptown Saint John, from Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|Looking east on the Saint John Throughway, right before the Harbour Bridge and the now closed (since 2011) toll plaza]]\n[[File:June 2009 Saint John Transit Bus.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Saint John Transit]] bus in uptown]]\n\n===Air===\nAir service into Saint John is provided by the [[Saint John Airport|Saint John Airport/A\u00e9roport de Saint-Jean]], near Loch Lomond {{convert|8|NM|lk=in}} east northeast of the central business district<ref name=\"CFS\">{{CFS}}</ref> or approximately {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}} by road northeast of the city centre.

In 1968 UNBSJ opened a new campus in the city's Tucker Park neighbourhood. This campus has undergone expansion over the years and is the fastest growing component of the UNB system with many new buildings constructed from the 1970s to the first decade of the 21st century. A trend in recent years has been a growth in the number of international students. The city also hosts a [[New Brunswick Community College]] campus in the East End of the city. There has also been a satellite campus of [[Dalhousie Medical School]] added within the UNBSJ campus in 2010, instructing 30 medical students each year.\n\nIn the fall of 2007, a report commissioned by the provincial government recommended UNBSJ and the NBCC be reformed and consolidated into a new polytechnic post-secondary institute. The proposal immediately came under heavy criticism and led to the organizing of several protests in the uptown area, citing the diminishment of UNB as a nationally accredited university, the reduction in accessibility to receive degrees \u2013 and these are only a couple of the reasons why the community was enraged by the recommendation. Support for keeping UNBSJ as it was, and expanding the university under its current structure, fell slightly below 90%. Seeing too much political capital would be lost, and several Saint John MPs were likely not to support the initiative if the policies recommended by the report were legislated, the government abandoned the commission's report and created an intra-provincial post-secondary commission.\n\nSaint John is served by two school boards: [[Anglophone South School District]] schools and [[Francophone Sud School District]] (based out of [[Dieppe, New Brunswick|Dieppe]], [[New Brunswick]]) for the city's only Francophone school, [[\u00c9cole Samuel-de-Champlain|Centre-Scolaire-Communautaire Samuel-de-Champlain]]. Saint John is also home to Canada's oldest publicly funded school, [[Saint John High School]]. The other high schools in the city are [[Harbour View High School]], [[St. Malachy's High School]], and [[Simonds High School]].\n\n==Media==\n{{Main|Media in Saint John, New Brunswick}}\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Main|List of people from Saint John, New Brunswick}}\n\n==Twin/sister cities==\n\n* {{flagicon|SLO}} [[Koper]], Slovenia<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/iiapublications/SmartBook/Documents/abbd6fd3-4149-4206-8731-eb53a3ffdc31/abbd6fd3-4149-4206-8731-eb53a3ffdc31.pdf |title=Report:  Visit of the Honourable No\u00ebl A.

He was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on May 7, 1804, and received his commission the same day. He was the first of Jefferson's three appointments to the court, and was selected for sharing Jefferson's political philosophy. Johnson was the first member of the Court who was not a [[Federalist Party|Federalist]].\n\nIn his years on the Court, Johnson developed a reputation as a frequent and articulate dissenter from the Federalist majority.  While Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] was frequently able to steer the opinions of most of the justices, Johnson demonstrated an independent streak. From 1805 through 1833, Johnson wrote nearly half of the Supreme Court's dissenting opinions.<ref>Morgan, D. (1944). Mr. Justice William Johnson and the Constitution.

The trials were held privately and the accused were likely not present when witnesses testified against them. The criticism from both Governor Bennett and Justice Johnson outraged members of the court whom published a rebuttal in the Charleston Courier the following month. The arrests and executions more than doubled in July 1822.

He was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on May 7, 1804, and received his commission the same day. He was the first of Jefferson's three appointments to the court, and was selected for sharing Jefferson's political philosophy. Johnson was the first member of the Court who was not a [[Federalist Party|Federalist]].\n\nIn his years on the Court, Johnson developed a reputation as a frequent and articulate dissenter from the Federalist majority.  While Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] was frequently able to steer the opinions of most of the justices, Johnson demonstrated an independent streak. From 1805 through 1833, Johnson wrote nearly half of the Supreme Court's dissenting opinions.<ref>Morgan, D. (1944). Mr. Justice William Johnson and the Constitution. ''Harvard Law Review,'' ''57''(3), 328-361. doi:10.2307/1335111</ref> Johnson also restored the practice of delivering [[seriatim]] opinions which President Thomas Jefferson approved of.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Relationship with South Carolina ===\nIn one notable instance, in 1808 he defied the orders of the federal Collector of the Port of Charleston, [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Caesar A. Rodney]], and President Jefferson, because he felt that the executive branch's control of maritime trade was an impermissible extension of its constitutional powers. (Johnson was nominated for Collector of the Port of Charleston on January 23, 1819, but chose to remain on the Court.)<ref>Fish, P. Graham., United States.

The rebellion Johnson cited had turned out to be only [[hearsay]] and resulted in the murder of an innocent man.<ref name=\":1\">Denmark Vesey and His Co-Conspirators Author(s): Michael P.

The trials were held privately and the accused were likely not present when witnesses testified against them. The criticism from both Governor Bennett and Justice Johnson outraged members of the court whom published a rebuttal in the Charleston Courier the following month. The arrests and executions more than doubled in July 1822. Some scholars have argued that this was because the court was attempting to legitimize the proceedings after being criticized.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1861/06/denmark-vesey/396239/|title=The Story of Denmark Vesey|last=Higginson|first=Thomas Wentworth|date=2015-06-18|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n==Career as author and later life==\nIn 1822 Johnson authored the two-volume ''Sketches of the Life and Correspondence of Nathanael Greene'', a comprehensive work about the [[Major general (United States)|major general]] in the [[Continental Army]] who played a vital role in the defeat of the British during the [[American Revolution]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=William |date=1822 |title=Sketches of the Life and Correspondence of Nathanael Greene |volume=I |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m1VXYdFfeR8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22nathanael+greene%22+%22william+johnson%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwij54eYzMXKAhVEqx4KHYETAfMQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22nathanael%20greene%22%20%22william%20johnson%22&f=false |location=Charleston, SC |publisher=A.

The term myth here refers to the imaginative expression in narrative form of what is experienced or apprehended as basic reality \u2026 The term creation refers to the beginning of things, whether by the will and act of a transcendent being, by emanation from some ultimate source, or in any other way.\"<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/142144/creation-myth creation myth], ''Enyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' (2009)</ref>\n\nReligion professor [[Mircea Eliade]] defined the word ''myth'' in terms of creation: \n<blockquote>\nMyth narrates a sacred history; it relates an event that took place in primordial Time, the fabled time of the \"beginnings.\" In other words, myth tells how, through the deeds of Supernatural Beings, a reality came into existence, be it the whole of reality, the Cosmos, or only a fragment of reality \u2013 an island, a species of plant, a particular kind of human behavior, an institution.<ref>{{harvnb|Eliade|1964|pp=5\u20136}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Meaning and function==\n[[File:Ba-Gua animated.gif|thumb|left|upright|In [[Chinese creation myth|Daoist creation myth]], \"The Way gave birth to unity; unity gave birth to duality; duality gave birth to trinity; trinity gave birth to the myriad creatures.\" (''[[Daodejing]]'', 4th century BCE)<ref>{{harvnb|Mair|1990|pages=9}}</ref>]]\nAll creation myths are in one sense [[etiological]] because they attempt to explain how the world was formed and where humanity came from.<ref name=\"Leeming 2005\"/> Myths attempt to explain the unknown and sometimes teach a lesson.<ref>[http://www.ushistory.org/civ/5c.asp Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes].

Central Oregon Community College.</ref>\n\nEthnologists and anthropologists{{which|date=December 2013}} who study these myths say that in the modern context theologians try to discern humanity's meaning from [[revelation|revealed truth]]s and scientists investigate [[cosmology]] with the tools of [[empiricism]] and [[rationality]], but creation myths define human reality in very different terms.  In the past historians of religion and other students of myth thought of them as forms of [[Primitive culture|primitive]] or early-stage science or religion and analyzed them in a [[wikt:literal|literal]] or logical sense.  Today, however, they are seen as symbolic narratives which must be understood in terms of their own cultural context. Charles Long writes, \"The beings referred to in the myth \u2013 gods, animals, plants \u2013 are forms of power grasped existentially. The myths should not be understood as attempts to work out a rational explanation of deity.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Long|1963|page=12}}</ref>\n\nWhile creation myths are not literal [[explication]]s they do serve to define an orientation of humanity in the world in terms of a birth story. They are the basis of a worldview that reaffirms and guides how people relate to the natural world, to any assumed spiritual world, and to each other. The creation myth acts as a cornerstone for distinguishing primary reality from relative reality, the origin and nature of [[being]] from non-being.<ref>{{harvnb|Sproul|1979|page=6}}</ref> In this sense they serve as a [[meaning of life|philosophy of life]] but one expressed and conveyed through [[Symbolic anthropology|symbol]] rather than systematic reason. And in this sense they go beyond [[Etiological myth#Mythology|etiological myth]]s which mean to explain specific features in religious rites, natural phenomena or cultural life. Creation myths also help to orient human beings in the world, giving them a sense of their place in the world and the regard that they must have for humans and nature.<ref name=\"britannica\"/>\n\nHistorian [[David Christian (historian)|David Christian]] has summarised issues common to multiple creation myths:\n<blockquote>\nEach beginning seems to presuppose an earlier beginning. ... Instead of meeting a single starting point, we encounter an infinity of them, each of which poses the same problem. ... There are no entirely satisfactory solutions to this dilemma. What we have to find is not a solution but some way of dealing with the mystery .... And we have to do so using words. The words we reach for, from ''God'' to ''gravity'', are inadequate to the task.

Eliade and his colleague Charles Long developed a classification based on some common [[Motif (literature)|motifs]] that reappear in stories the world over. The classification identifies five basic types:<ref name=\"lm3233\">{{harvnb|Leonard|McClure|2004|page=32\u201333}}</ref>\n[[File:Shesh shaiya Vishnu.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Brahma|Brahm\u0101]], the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]'' of creation, emerges from a [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] risen from the navel of [[Vishnu|Vi\u1e63\u0146u]], who lies with [[Lakshmi]] on the serpent [[Ananta Shesha]].]]\n\n* Creation ''[[ex nihilo]]'' in which the creation is through the thought, word, dream or bodily secretions of a divine being.\n* [[Earth diver]] creation in which a diver, usually a bird or amphibian sent by a creator, plunges to the seabed through a [[cosmic ocean|primordial ocean]] to bring up sand or mud which develops into a terrestrial world.\n* Emergence myths in which progenitors pass through a series of worlds and metamorphoses until reaching the present world.\n* Creation by the dismemberment of a primordial being.\n* Creation by the splitting or ordering of a primordial unity such as the cracking of a [[cosmic egg]] or a bringing order from [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]].\n\n[[Marta Weigle]] further developed and refined this typology to highlight nine themes, adding elements such as ''deus faber'', a creation crafted by a deity, creation from the work of two creators working together or against each other, creation from sacrifice and creation from division/conjugation, accretion/conjunction, or secretion.<ref name=\"lm3233\"/>\n\nAn alternative system based on six recurring narrative themes was designed by Raymond Van Over:<ref name=\"lm3233\"/>\n* Primeval [[Abyss (religion)|abyss]], an infinite expanse of waters or space.\n* Originator deity which is awakened or an eternal entity within the abyss.\n* Originator deity poised above the abyss.\n* [[Cosmic egg]] or [[embryo]].\n* Originator deity creating life through sound or word.\n* Life generating from the corpse or dismembered parts of an originator deity.\n\n===''Ex nihilo''===\n{{main|Ex nihilo}}\n[[File:Hieronymus Bosch - The Garden of Earthly Delights - The exterior (shutters).jpg|thumb|upright|''Creation'' on the exterior shutters of [[Hieronymus Bosch]]'s [[triptych]] ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'' (c. 1490\u20131510)]]\n\nThe myth that God created the world out of nothing \u2013 ''[[ex nihilo]]'' \u2013 is central today to Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and the medieval Jewish philosopher [[Maimonides]] felt it was the only concept that the three religions shared.{{sfn|Soskice|2010|p=24}} Nonetheless, the concept is not found in the entire Hebrew Bible.{{sfn|Nebe|2002|p=119}} The authors of Genesis 1 were concerned not with the origins of matter (the material which God formed into the habitable cosmos), but with assigning roles so that the Cosmos should function.{{sfn|Walton|2006|p=183}} In the early 2nd century AD, early Christian scholars were beginning to see a tension between the idea of world-formation and the omnipotence of God, and by the beginning of the 3rd century creation ''ex nihilo'' had become a fundamental tenet of Christian theology.{{sfn|May|2004|p=179}}\n\n''Ex nihilo'' creation is found in creation stories from [[ancient Egypt]], the [[Rig Veda]], and many [[animism|animistic]] cultures in Africa, Asia, Oceania and North America.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|2010|pages=1\u20133, 153}}</ref>  In most of these stories the world is brought into being by the speech, dream, breath, or pure thought of a creator but creation ex nihilo may also take place through a creator's bodily secretions.\n\nThe literal translation of the phrase ''ex nihilo'' is \"from nothing\" but in many creation myths the line is blurred whether the creative act would be better classified as a creation ''ex nihilo'' or creation from chaos. In ''ex nihilo'' creation myths the potential and the substance of creation springs from within the creator. Such a creator may or may not be existing in physical surroundings such as darkness or water, but does not create the world from them, whereas in creation from chaos the substance used for creation is pre-existing within the unformed void.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|Leeming|1994|pages=60\u201361}}</ref>\n\n===Creation from chaos===\n{{main|Chaos (cosmogony)}}\nIn creation from chaos myth, initially there is nothing but a formless, shapeless expanse.  In these stories the word \"chaos\" means \"disorder\", and this formless expanse, which is also sometimes called a void or an abyss, contains the material with which the created world will be made.  Chaos may be described as having the consistency of vapor or water, dimensionless, and sometimes salty or muddy.  These myths associate chaos with evil and oblivion, in contrast to \"order\" (''cosmos'') which is the good.  The act of creation is the bringing of order from disorder, and in many of these cultures it is believed that at some point the forces preserving order and form will weaken and the world will once again be engulfed into the abyss.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|2010}}</ref> One example is the [[Genesis creation narrative|Genesis creation myth]] from the first chapter of the [[Book of Genesis]].\n\n===World parent===\n[[Image:WahineTane.jpg|right|thumb|upright|In one [[M\u0101ori mythology|Maori creation myth]], the primal couple are [[Rangi and Papa]], depicted holding each other in a tight embrace.]]\nThere are two types of world parent myths, both describing a separation or splitting of a primeval entity, the world parent or parents.  One form describes the primeval state as an eternal union of two parents, and the creation takes place when the two are pulled apart.  The two parents are commonly identified as Sky (usually male) and Earth (usually female) who in the primeval state were so tightly bound to each other that no offspring could emerge.  These myths often depict creation as the result of a sexual union, and serve as genealogical record of the deities born from it.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|2010|page=16}}</ref>\n\nIn the second form of world parent myth, creation itself springs from dismembered parts of the body of the primeval being.  Often in these stories the limbs, hair, blood, bones or organs of the primeval being are somehow severed or sacrificed to transform into sky, earth, animal or plant life, and other worldly features. These myths tend to emphasize creative forces as animistic in nature rather than sexual, and depict the sacred as the elemental and integral component of the natural world.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|2010|page=18}}</ref> One example of this is the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] creation myth described in ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' exactly in the poem [[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9I62BcuPxfYC&pg=PA209&lpg=PA209&dq=creation+myth+in+voluspa#v=onepage&q=creation%20myth%20in%20voluspa&f=false|title=Creation Myths of the World: An Encyclopedia|last=Leeming|first=David Adams|date=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781598841749|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Emergence===\nIn emergence myths humanity emerges from another world into the one they currently inhabit. The previous world is often considered the womb of the [[earth mother]], and the process of emergence is likened to the act of giving birth.  The role of midwife is usually played by a female deity, like the spider woman of several mythologies of Indigenous peoples in the Americas.  Male characters rarely figure into these stories, and scholars often consider them in counterpoint to male-oriented creation myths, like those of the ''ex nihilo'' variety.<ref name=\"Leeming 2005\">{{harvnb|Leeming|chapter=\"Creation\"|2011a}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Image-sipapu.JPG|thumb|upright|left|In the [[kiva]] of both [[Ancestral Puebloans|ancient]] and present-day [[Pueblo people]]s, the [[sipapu]] is a small round hole in the floor that represents the portal through which the ancestors [[Hopi mythology#Four Worlds|first emerged]]. (The larger hole is a fire pit, here in a ruin from the [[Mesa Verde National Park]].)]]\nEmergence myths commonly describe the creation of people and/or supernatural beings as a staged ascent or [[metamorphosis]] from nascent forms through a series of subterranean worlds to arrive at their current place and form.  Often the passage from one world or stage to the next is impelled by inner forces, a process of germination or gestation from earlier, embryonic forms.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|2010|pages=21\u201324}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Long|1963}}</ref>  The genre is most commonly found in Native American cultures where the myths frequently link the final emergence of people from a hole opening to the underworld to stories about their subsequent migrations and eventual settlement in their current homelands.<ref>{{harvnb|Wheeler-Voegelin|Moore|1957|pages=66\u201373}}</ref>\n\n===Earth-diver===\nThe earth-diver is a common character in various traditional creation myths. In these stories a supreme being usually sends an animal into the primal waters to find bits of sand or mud with which to build habitable land. Some scholars interpret these myths psychologically while others interpret them [[Cosmogony|cosmogonically]]. In both cases emphasis is placed on beginnings emanating from the depths.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|chapter=\"Earth-Diver Creation\"|2011b}}</ref> Earth-diver myths are common in [[Native American mythology|Native American folklore]] but can be found among the [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]] and [[Yukaghir]], the [[Tatars]] and many [[Uralic mythologies|Finno-Ugrian]] traditions. The pattern of distribution of these stories suggest they have a common origin in the [[Geography of Asia#East Asia|eastern Asiatic]] coastal region, spreading as peoples migrated west into [[Siberia]] and east to the [[North America]]n continent.<ref>{{harvnb|Booth|1984|pages=168\u201370}}</ref><ref>[[Vladimir Napolskikh]] (2012), ''[https://www.academia.edu/4918926/Diving_Bird_Myth_after_20_years_2012 Earth-Diver Myth (\u0410812) in northern Eurasia and North America: twenty years later]''</ref>\n\nCharacteristic of many Native American myths, earth-diver creation stories begin as beings and potential forms linger asleep or suspended in the primordial realm. The earth-diver is among the first of them to awaken and lay the necessary groundwork by building suitable lands where the coming creation will be able to live. In many cases, these stories will describe a series of failed attempts to make land before the solution is found.<ref>{{harvnb|Leonard|McClure|2004|page=38}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div

Central Oregon Community College.</ref>\n\nEthnologists and anthropologists{{which|date=December 2013}} who study these myths say that in the modern context theologians try to discern humanity's meaning from [[revelation|revealed truth]]s and scientists investigate [[cosmology]] with the tools of [[empiricism]] and [[rationality]], but creation myths define human reality in very different terms.  In the past historians of religion and other students of myth thought of them as forms of [[Primitive culture|primitive]] or early-stage science or religion and analyzed them in a [[wikt:literal|literal]] or logical sense.  Today, however, they are seen as symbolic narratives which must be understood in terms of their own cultural context. Charles Long writes, \"The beings referred to in the myth \u2013 gods, animals, plants \u2013 are forms of power grasped existentially. The myths should not be understood as attempts to work out a rational explanation of deity.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Long|1963|page=12}}</ref>\n\nWhile creation myths are not literal [[explication]]s they do serve to define an orientation of humanity in the world in terms of a birth story. They are the basis of a worldview that reaffirms and guides how people relate to the natural world, to any assumed spiritual world, and to each other. The creation myth acts as a cornerstone for distinguishing primary reality from relative reality, the origin and nature of [[being]] from non-being.<ref>{{harvnb|Sproul|1979|page=6}}</ref> In this sense they serve as a [[meaning of life|philosophy of life]] but one expressed and conveyed through [[Symbolic anthropology|symbol]] rather than systematic reason. And in this sense they go beyond [[Etiological myth#Mythology|etiological myth]]s which mean to explain specific features in religious rites, natural phenomena or cultural life. Creation myths also help to orient human beings in the world, giving them a sense of their place in the world and the regard that they must have for humans and nature.<ref name=\"britannica\"/>\n\nHistorian [[David Christian (historian)|David Christian]] has summarised issues common to multiple creation myths:\n<blockquote>\nEach beginning seems to presuppose an earlier beginning. ...

Eliade and his colleague Charles Long developed a classification based on some common [[Motif (literature)|motifs]] that reappear in stories the world over. The classification identifies five basic types:<ref name=\"lm3233\">{{harvnb|Leonard|McClure|2004|page=32\u201333}}</ref>\n[[File:Shesh shaiya Vishnu.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Brahma|Brahm\u0101]], the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]'' of creation, emerges from a [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] risen from the navel of [[Vishnu|Vi\u1e63\u0146u]], who lies with [[Lakshmi]] on the serpent [[Ananta Shesha]].]]\n\n* Creation ''[[ex nihilo]]'' in which the creation is through the thought, word, dream or bodily secretions of a divine being.\n* [[Earth diver]] creation in which a diver, usually a bird or amphibian sent by a creator, plunges to the seabed through a [[cosmic ocean|primordial ocean]] to bring up sand or mud which develops into a terrestrial world.\n* Emergence myths in which progenitors pass through a series of worlds and metamorphoses until reaching the present world.\n* Creation by the dismemberment of a primordial being.\n* Creation by the splitting or ordering of a primordial unity such as the cracking of a [[cosmic egg]] or a bringing order from [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]].\n\n[[Marta Weigle]] further developed and refined this typology to highlight nine themes, adding elements such as ''deus faber'', a creation crafted by a deity, creation from the work of two creators working together or against each other, creation from sacrifice and creation from division/conjugation, accretion/conjunction, or secretion.<ref name=\"lm3233\"/>\n\nAn alternative system based on six recurring narrative themes was designed by Raymond Van Over:<ref name=\"lm3233\"/>\n* Primeval [[Abyss (religion)|abyss]], an infinite expanse of waters or space.\n* Originator deity which is awakened or an eternal entity within the abyss.\n* Originator deity poised above the abyss.\n* [[Cosmic egg]] or [[embryo]].\n* Originator deity creating life through sound or word.\n* Life generating from the corpse or dismembered parts of an originator deity.\n\n===''Ex nihilo''===\n{{main|Ex nihilo}}\n[[File:Hieronymus Bosch - The Garden of Earthly Delights - The exterior (shutters).jpg|thumb|upright|''Creation'' on the exterior shutters of [[Hieronymus Bosch]]'s [[triptych]] ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'' (c. 1490\u20131510)]]\n\nThe myth that God created the world out of nothing \u2013 ''[[ex nihilo]]'' \u2013 is central today to Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and the medieval Jewish philosopher [[Maimonides]] felt it was the only concept that the three religions shared.{{sfn|Soskice|2010|p=24}} Nonetheless, the concept is not found in the entire Hebrew Bible.{{sfn|Nebe|2002|p=119}} The authors of Genesis 1 were concerned not with the origins of matter (the material which God formed into the habitable cosmos), but with assigning roles so that the Cosmos should function.{{sfn|Walton|2006|p=183}} In the early 2nd century AD, early Christian scholars were beginning to see a tension between the idea of world-formation and the omnipotence of God, and by the beginning of the 3rd century creation ''ex nihilo'' had become a fundamental tenet of Christian theology.{{sfn|May|2004|p=179}}\n\n''Ex nihilo'' creation is found in creation stories from [[ancient Egypt]], the [[Rig Veda]], and many [[animism|animistic]] cultures in Africa, Asia, Oceania and North America.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|2010|pages=1\u20133, 153}}</ref>  In most of these stories the world is brought into being by the speech, dream, breath, or pure thought of a creator but creation ex nihilo may also take place through a creator's bodily secretions.\n\nThe literal translation of the phrase ''ex nihilo'' is \"from nothing\" but in many creation myths the line is blurred whether the creative act would be better classified as a creation ''ex nihilo'' or creation from chaos. In ''ex nihilo'' creation myths the potential and the substance of creation springs from within the creator. Such a creator may or may not be existing in physical surroundings such as darkness or water, but does not create the world from them, whereas in creation from chaos the substance used for creation is pre-existing within the unformed void.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|Leeming|1994|pages=60\u201361}}</ref>\n\n===Creation from chaos===\n{{main|Chaos (cosmogony)}}\nIn creation from chaos myth, initially there is nothing but a formless, shapeless expanse.  In these stories the word \"chaos\" means \"disorder\", and this formless expanse, which is also sometimes called a void or an abyss, contains the material with which the created world will be made.  Chaos may be described as having the consistency of vapor or water, dimensionless, and sometimes salty or muddy.  These myths associate chaos with evil and oblivion, in contrast to \"order\" (''cosmos'') which is the good.  The act of creation is the bringing of order from disorder, and in many of these cultures it is believed that at some point the forces preserving order and form will weaken and the world will once again be engulfed into the abyss.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|2010}}</ref> One example is the [[Genesis creation narrative|Genesis creation myth]] from the first chapter of the [[Book of Genesis]].\n\n===World parent===\n[[Image:WahineTane.jpg|right|thumb|upright|In one [[M\u0101ori mythology|Maori creation myth]], the primal couple are [[Rangi and Papa]], depicted holding each other in a tight embrace.]]\nThere are two types of world parent myths, both describing a separation or splitting of a primeval entity, the world parent or parents.  One form describes the primeval state as an eternal union of two parents, and the creation takes place when the two are pulled apart.  The two parents are commonly identified as Sky (usually male) and Earth (usually female) who in the primeval state were so tightly bound to each other that no offspring could emerge.  These myths often depict creation as the result of a sexual union, and serve as genealogical record of the deities born from it.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|2010|page=16}}</ref>\n\nIn the second form of world parent myth, creation itself springs from dismembered parts of the body of the primeval being.  Often in these stories the limbs, hair, blood, bones or organs of the primeval being are somehow severed or sacrificed to transform into sky, earth, animal or plant life, and other worldly features. These myths tend to emphasize creative forces as animistic in nature rather than sexual, and depict the sacred as the elemental and integral component of the natural world.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|2010|page=18}}</ref> One example of this is the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] creation myth described in ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' exactly in the poem [[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9I62BcuPxfYC&pg=PA209&lpg=PA209&dq=creation+myth+in+voluspa#v=onepage&q=creation%20myth%20in%20voluspa&f=false|title=Creation Myths of the World: An Encyclopedia|last=Leeming|first=David Adams|date=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781598841749|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Emergence===\nIn emergence myths humanity emerges from another world into the one they currently inhabit. The previous world is often considered the womb of the [[earth mother]], and the process of emergence is likened to the act of giving birth.  The role of midwife is usually played by a female deity, like the spider woman of several mythologies of Indigenous peoples in the Americas.  Male characters rarely figure into these stories, and scholars often consider them in counterpoint to male-oriented creation myths, like those of the ''ex nihilo'' variety.<ref name=\"Leeming 2005\">{{harvnb|Leeming|chapter=\"Creation\"|2011a}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Image-sipapu.JPG|thumb|upright|left|In the [[kiva]] of both [[Ancestral Puebloans|ancient]] and present-day [[Pueblo people]]s, the [[sipapu]] is a small round hole in the floor that represents the portal through which the ancestors [[Hopi mythology#Four Worlds|first emerged]]. (The larger hole is a fire pit, here in a ruin from the [[Mesa Verde National Park]].)]]\nEmergence myths commonly describe the creation of people and/or supernatural beings as a staged ascent or [[metamorphosis]] from nascent forms through a series of subterranean worlds to arrive at their current place and form.  Often the passage from one world or stage to the next is impelled by inner forces, a process of germination or gestation from earlier, embryonic forms.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|2010|pages=21\u201324}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Long|1963}}</ref>  The genre is most commonly found in Native American cultures where the myths frequently link the final emergence of people from a hole opening to the underworld to stories about their subsequent migrations and eventual settlement in their current homelands.<ref>{{harvnb|Wheeler-Voegelin|Moore|1957|pages=66\u201373}}</ref>\n\n===Earth-diver===\nThe earth-diver is a common character in various traditional creation myths. In these stories a supreme being usually sends an animal into the primal waters to find bits of sand or mud with which to build habitable land. Some scholars interpret these myths psychologically while others interpret them [[Cosmogony|cosmogonically]]. In both cases emphasis is placed on beginnings emanating from the depths.<ref>{{harvnb|Leeming|chapter=\"Earth-Diver Creation\"|2011b}}</ref> Earth-diver myths are common in [[Native American mythology|Native American folklore]] but can be found among the [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]] and [[Yukaghir]], the [[Tatars]] and many [[Uralic mythologies|Finno-Ugrian]] traditions. The pattern of distribution of these stories suggest they have a common origin in the [[Geography of Asia#East Asia|eastern Asiatic]] coastal region, spreading as peoples migrated west into [[Siberia]] and east to the [[North America]]n continent.<ref>{{harvnb|Booth|1984|pages=168\u201370}}</ref><ref>[[Vladimir Napolskikh]] (2012), ''[https://www.academia.edu/4918926/Diving_Bird_Myth_after_20_years_2012 Earth-Diver Myth (\u0410812) in northern Eurasia and North America: twenty years later]''</ref>\n\nCharacteristic of many Native American myths, earth-diver creation stories begin as beings and potential forms linger asleep or suspended in the primordial realm. The earth-diver is among the first of them to awaken and lay the necessary groundwork by building suitable lands where the coming creation will be able to live. In many cases, these stories will describe a series of failed attempts to make land before the solution is found.<ref>{{harvnb|Leonard|McClure|2004|page=38}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div

I ended up managing them and producing them and writing with them.\"<ref name=\"CRAugust\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/features/iron-maidens-steve-harris-on-british-lion-solo-project/ |title=Exclusive: Iron Maiden\u2019s Steve Harris talks about his British Lion solo project |accessdate=8 September 2012 |last=Brannigan |first=Paul |date=27 August 2012 |magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020112709/http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/features/iron-maidens-steve-harris-on-british-lion-solo-project/ |archivedate=20 October 2013 }}</ref> After the original band split up, he \"kept in touch with Richie [Taylor, vocals] and Graham, and then Richie was working with another guitarist called David Hawkins, who's a really talented guy, and so we started writing songs together.\"<ref name=\"CRAugust\"/> After several years of work, due to Harris being occupied with Iron Maiden, the album ultimately consists of \"six songs written with Richie and David, there's one with just me and Richie, and the others are me, Richie, Graham and a couple of other guys that were around at the time.\"<ref name=\"CRAugust\"/> In an interview published by ''[[Kerrang!]]'' in September, Harris said that he considers ''British Lion'' \"more of a side-project\" than a solo record.<ref name=\"kerrang lion\"/>\n\nStylistically, Harris argues that the record is \"more mainstream rock than metal, very British sounding, very 70s-influenced and quite commercial\u2026 but good commercial.

I ended up managing them and producing them and writing with them.\"<ref name=\"CRAugust\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/features/iron-maidens-steve-harris-on-british-lion-solo-project/ |title=Exclusive: Iron Maiden\u2019s Steve Harris talks about his British Lion solo project |accessdate=8 September 2012 |last=Brannigan |first=Paul |date=27 August 2012 |magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020112709/http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/features/iron-maidens-steve-harris-on-british-lion-solo-project/ |archivedate=20 October 2013 }}</ref> After the original band split up, he \"kept in touch with Richie [Taylor, vocals] and Graham, and then Richie was working with another guitarist called David Hawkins, who's a really talented guy, and so we started writing songs together.\"<ref name=\"CRAugust\"/> After several years of work, due to Harris being occupied with Iron Maiden, the album ultimately consists of \"six songs written with Richie and David, there's one with just me and Richie, and the others are me, Richie, Graham and a couple of other guys that were around at the time.\"<ref name=\"CRAugust\"/> In an interview published by ''[[Kerrang!]]'' in September, Harris said that he considers ''British Lion'' \"more of a side-project\" than a solo record.<ref name=\"kerrang lion\"/>\n\nStylistically, Harris argues that the record is \"more mainstream rock than metal, very British sounding, very 70s-influenced and quite commercial\u2026 but good commercial. There's all kinds of stuff going on, with nods to [[the Who]] and [[UFO (band)|UFO]] and some classic British rock bands, but it's not the progressive rock album some might be expecting.\"<ref

as letting his strings \"go dead\".<ref>{{cite episode | title = Iron Maiden | series = [[That Metal Show]] | serieslink =  | credits = [[Eddie Trunk]], [[Jim Florentine]], [[Don Jamieson

''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'' also gave it a score of 3/5, although they praised the \"cohesive\" song-writing and referred to Taylor as \"a compelling hard-rock singer\".<ref

The chassis is similar to the liquid cooled models, but the engine cradle is 1 1/2\u201d longer to accommodate the larger powerplant.
