Al-Ghazali reluctantly capitulated in 1106, fearing rightly that he and his teachings would meet with resistance and controversy.<ref name=\"Griffel\" /> He later returned to Tus and declined an invitation in 1110 from the grand vizier of the Seljuq Sultan [[Muhammad I (Seljuq sultan)|Muhammad I]] to return to Baghdad.

The {{lang|ar|Ihya}} became the most frequently recited Islamic text after the Qur'an and the hadith.

After the existential crisis that caused him to completely re-examine his way of living and his approach to religion, Al-Ghazali put together ''The Alchemy of Happiness''<ref name=\"Kimiya\" /> to reassert his fundamental belief that a connection to God was an integral part of the joy of living. The book is divided into four different sections. The first of these is Knowledge of Self'','' where Al-Ghazali asserts that while food, sex, and other indulgences might slake humans appetites temporarily, they in turn make a human into an animal, and therefore will never give true happiness and fulfillment. In order to find oneself, people must devote themselves to God by showing restraint and discipline rather than gluttony of the senses ''.'' The second installment is called Knowledge of God, where Al-Ghazali states that the events that occur during one's life are meant to point an individual towards God, and that God will always be strong, no matter how far humans deviate from His will. The third section of ''[[The Alchemy of Happiness]]'' is Knowledge of the World. Here he states that the world is merely a place where humans learn to love God, and prepare for the future, or the afterlife, the nature of which will be determined by our actions in this phase of our journey to happiness''.'' The final section is Knowledge of the Future World, which details how there are two types of spirits within a man: the angelic spirit and the animal spirit. Al-Ghazali details the types of spiritual tortures unbelievers experience, as well as the path that must be taken in order to attain spiritual enlightenment''.'' This book serves as a culmination of the transformation Ghazali goes through during his spiritual awakening.\n\n'''<big>Disciplining the Soul</big>'''\n\nOne of the key sections of Ghazali's ''[[The Revival of the Religious Sciences|Revival of the Religious Sciences]]'' is ''Disciplining the Soul'', which focuses on the internal struggles that every Muslim will face over the course of his lifetime.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Al-Ghazali on Disciplining the Soul and on Breaking the Two Desires|last=Winter|first=T.J|publisher=The Islamic Text Society|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The first chapter primarily focuses on how one can develop himself into a person with positive attributes and good personal characteristics . The second chapter has a more specific focus: sexual satisfaction and [[gluttony]].<ref name=\":2\" /> Here, Ghazali states that indeed every man has these desires and needs, and that it is natural to want these things.<ref name=\":2\" /> However, the Prophet explicitly states that there must be a middle ground for man, in order to practice the tenets of Islam faithfully . The ultimate goal that Ghazali is presenting not only in these two chapters, but in the entirety of ''The'' ''Revival of the Religious Sciences'', is that there must be moderation in every aspect of the soul of a man, an equilibrium. These two chapters were the 22nd and 23rd chapters, respectively, in Ghazali's ''Revival of the Religious Sciences''<ref name=\":2\" />''.'' It's also important to note here that Ghazali draws from Greek as well as Islamic philosophy in crafting this literary staple, even though much of ''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]],'' his most well known work, takes a critical aim at their perspective.\n\n'''<big>The Eternity of the World</big>'''\n\nAl-Ghazali crafted his rebuttal of the Aristotelian viewpoint on the creation of the world in ''The Eternity of the World .'' Al-Ghazali essentially formulates two main arguments for what he views as a sacrilegious thought process. Central to the [[Eternity of the world|Aristotelian]] approach is the concept that motion will always precede motion, or in other words, a force will always create another force, and therefore for a force to be created, another force must act upon that force.<ref name=\":0\" /> This means that in essence time stretches infinitely both into the future and into the past, which therefore proves that [[God]] did not create the universe at one specific point in time. Ghazali counters this by first stating that if the world was created with exact boundaries, then in its current form there would be no need for a time before the creation of the world by God.<ref name=\":0\" />  The second argument Ghazali makes is that because humans can only imagine the time before the creation of the world, and your imagination is a fictional thing, that all the time before the world was created is fictional as well, and therefore does not matter as it was not intended by God to be understood by humans.\n\n<big>'''The Decisive Criterion for Distinguishing Islam from Clandestine Unbelief'''</big>\n\nAl-Ghazali lays out in ''The'' ''Decisive Criterion for Distinguishing Islam from Clandestine Unbelief'' his approach to Muslim orthodoxy. Ghazali veers from the often hardline stance of many of his contemporaries during this time period and states that as long as one believes in the [[Muhammad|Prophet Muhammad]] and God himself, there are many different ways to practice Islam and that any of the many traditions practiced in good faith by believers should not be viewed as heretical by other Muslims.<ref name=\"Griffel\" /> While Ghazali does state that any Muslim practicing Islam in good faith is not guilty of [[apostasy]], he does outline in ''The Criterion'' that there is one standard of Islam that is more correct than the others, and that those practicing the faith incorrectly should be moved to change.<ref name=\"Griffel\" /> In Ghazali's view, only the Prophet himself could deem a faithfully practicing Muslim an infidel, and his work was a pushback against the religious persecution and strife that occurred often during this time period between various Islamic sects.<ref name=\"Griffel\" />\n\n===Works in Persian===\n\nAl-Ghazali wrote most of his works in [[Arabic]] and few in [[Persian language|Persian]]. His most important Persian work is [[Kimiya-yi sa'\u0101dat|''K\u012bmy\u0101y\u00e9 Sa'\u0101dat'']] (The Alchemy of Happiness). It is al-Ghazali's own Persian version of ''Ihya'ul ulumuddin'' (The Revival of Religious Sciences) in Arabic, but a shorter work. It is one of the outstanding works of 11th-century-Persian literature. The book was published several times in [[Tehran]] by the edition of Hussain Khadev-jam, a renowned Iranian scholar. It is translated to [[English language|English]], [[Arabic]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Urdu]], [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] and other languages.<ref name=\"Kimiya\">Translated into English by Mohammed Asim Bilal and available at [https://archive.org/details/KimiyaISaadatAnEnglishTranslationOfImamGhazzalisAlchemyOfEternalBlissabuHamidAlGhazali archive.org]</ref>\n\nApart from Kimya, the most celebrated of al-Ghazali's works in Persian is '''Nas\u012bhatul Mul\u016bk'' (The Counseling Kings), written most probably for Sultan [[Ahmed Sanjar|Ahmad Sanjar ibn Malekshah]]. In the edition published by Jal\u0101ludd\u012bn Hum\u0101y\u012b, the book consists of two parts of which only the first can reliably be attributed to al-Ghazali. The language and the contents of some passages are similar to the Kimyaye Sa'adat. The second part differs considerably in content and style from the well-known writings of al-Ghazali. It contains the stories of pre-Islamic kings of [[Persia]], especially those of [[Khosrau I|Anosherv\u0101n]]. Nasihatul Muluk was early translated to Arabic under the title '' al-Tibr al-masbuk fi nasihat al-muluk'' (The Forged Sword in Counseling Kings).\n\n''Z\u0101d-e \u0100kherat'' (Provision for the hereafter) is an important Persian book of al-Ghazali but gained less scholarly attention. The greater part of it consists of the Persian translation of one of his Arabic books, ''Bed\u0101yat al-Hed\u0101ya'' (Beginning of Guidance). It contains in addition the same contents as the K\u012bmy\u0101y\u00e9 Sa'\u0101dat. The book was most probably written during the last years of his life. Its manuscripts are in [[Kabul]] (Library of the Department of Press) and in [[Leiden]].\n\n'''Pand-n\u0101ma''' (Book of Counsel) is another book of advice and probably attributed to Sultan Sanjar. The introduction to the book relates that Al-Ghazali wrote the book in response to a certain king who had asked him for advice. '''Ay farzand''' (O son!) is a short book of counsel that al-Ghazali wrote for one of his students. The book was early translated to Arabic entitled ''ayyuhal walad''. Another Persian work is '''Ham\u0101q\u0101ti ahli ib\u0101hat''' or '''Raddi eb\u0101h\u012byya''' (Condemnation of antinomians) which is his ''[[fatwa]]'' in Persian illustrated with [[Quran]]ic verses and [[Hadith]]s.\n\n'''Faza'ilul al-anam min rasa'ili hujjat al-Islam''' is the collection of letters in Persian that al-Ghazali wrote in response to the kings, ministers, jurists and some of his friends after he returned to [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]]. The collection was gathered by one of his grandchildren after his death, under five sections/chapters. The longest letter is the response to objections raised against some of his statements in ''Mishkat al-Anwar'' (The Niche of Light) and ''al-Munqidh min al-dalal'' (Rescuer from Error). The first letter is the one which al-Ghazali wrote to [[Ahmed Sanjar|Sultan Sanjar]] presenting his excuse for teaching in [[Nizamiyya]] of [[Nishapur]]; followed by al-Ghazali's speech in the court of Sultan Sanjar. Al-Ghazali makes an impressive speech when he was taken to the king's court in Nishapur in 1106, giving very influential counsels, asking the sultan once again for excusing him from teaching in Nizamiyya. The sultan was so impressed that he ordered al-Ghazali to write down his speech so that it will be sent to all the [[ulema]]s of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Persian Iraq|Iraq]].\n\n==Influence==\n{{Full citations needed|section|date=November 2019}}<!-- The quotations, quotation marks, and references are jumbled, and the latter need to be expanded into full citations. -->\nDuring his life, he authored over 70 books on science, Islamic reasoning and Sufism.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith, Margaret, \u201cThe Forerunner of al-Ghazali\", Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1936, pp. 65-78.|first=Margaret|date=1936|title=The Forerunner of Al-Ghazali|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=13|via=}}</ref> Al-Ghazali distributed his book ''The Incoherence of Philosophers'', set apart as the defining moment in Islamic epistemology. The experience that he had with suspicion drove al-Ghazali to shape a conviction that all occasions and connections are not the result of material conjunctions but are the present and prompt will of God.\n\nAnother of al-Ghazali's most prestigious works is ''Ihya' Ulum al-Din'' (\"The Revival of Religious Sciences\"). The work covers all fields of Islamic science and incorporates Islamic statute, philosophy and Sufism. It had numerous positive reactions, and Al-Ghazali at that point composed a condensed form in Persian under the title ''Kimiya-yi sa'adat'' (\"The Alchemy of Happiness\"). Although al-Ghazali said that he has composed more than 70 books, attributed to him are more than 400 books.\n\nAl-Ghazali likewise assumed a noteworthy part in spreading Sufism and Sharia. He was the first to consolidate the ideas of Sufism into Sharia laws and the first to give a formal depiction of Sufism in his works. His works fortify the position of Sunni Islam, contrasted with different schools of thought.\n\nAl-Ghazali had an important influence on both later [[Muslim philosophers]] and [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Medieval philosophy|medieval philosophers]]. [[Margaret Smith (author)|Margaret Smith]] writes in her book ''Al-Ghazali: The Mystic'' (London 1944): \"There can be no doubt that al-Ghazali\u2019s works would be among the first to attract the attention of these European scholars\" (page 220). Then she emphasizes, \"The greatest of these Christian writers who was influenced by al-Ghazali was St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225\u20131274), who made a study of the Arabic writers and admitted his indebtedness to them, having studied at the [[University of Naples]] where the influence of Arab literature and culture was predominant at the time.\" In addition, Aquinas' interest in Islamic studies could be attributed to the infiltration of \u2018Latin Averroism\u2019 in the 13th century, especially at the [[University of Paris]].\n\nThe period following Ghazali \"has tentatively been called the Golden Age of Arabic philosophy\" initiated by Ghazali's successful integration of [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|logic into the Islamic]] seminary [[Madrasah]] curriculum.<ref name=Stanford>\n\"Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee had successfully introduced logic into the madrasa (though it was studied in other venues as well (Endress 2006)). What happened to it after this time was the result of the activities of logicians much more gifted than Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee. This period has tentatively been called the Golden Age of Arabic philosophy (Gutas 2002). It is in this period, and especially in the thirteenth century, that the major changes in the coverage and structure of Avicennan logic were introduced; these changes were mainly introduced in free-standing treatises on logic. It has been observed that the thirteenth century was the time that \u201cdoing logic in Arabic was thoroughly disconnected from textual exegesis, perhaps more so than at any time before or since\u201d (El-Rouayheb 2010b: 48\u201349). Many of the major textbooks for teaching logic in later centuries come from this period. [...] For all his historical importance in the process of introducing logic into the madrasa, the logic that Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee defended was too dilute to be recognizably Farabian or Avicennan.\"\n{{cite encyclopedia|author=Tony Street|title=Arabic and Islamic Philosophy of Language and Logic|encyclopedia=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|date=July 23, 2008|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/arabic-islamic-language|accessdate=2008-12-05}}</ref>\n\nAl-Ghazali also played a major role in integrating [[Sufism]] with [[Shariah]]. He was also the first to present a formal description of Sufism in his works. His works also strengthened the status of [[Sunni Islam]] against other schools. The [[Batiniyya|Batinite]] ([[Ismailism]]) had emerged in [[Persia]]n territories and were gaining more and more power during al-Ghazali's period, as [[Nizam al-Mulk]] was assassinated by the members of Ismailis. Al-Ghazali strongly rejected their ideology and wrote several books on criticism of Baatinyas which significantly weakened their status.\n\nAl-Ghazali succeeded in gaining widespread acceptance for Sufism at the expense of philosophy.<ref name=sells>{{cite book|author=Sells, Michael Anthony|title=Early Islamic Mysticism: Sufi, Qur\u02bcan, Miraj, Poetic and Theological Writings|publisher=New York: Paulist|year=1996|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BrU54SYQSyoC&pg=PA24|isbn=9780809136193}}</ref> At the same time, in his refutation of philosophers he made use of their philosophical categories and thus helped to give them wider circulation.<ref name=sells/>\n\nHis influences and impact on Sufism and Islam during the 11th century has been a subject of debate in contemporary times.  Some fifty works that he had written is evidenced that he was one of the most important Islamic thinkers of his time.  Three of his works, Ihaya' Ulum ad-Din (Revival of Religious Sciences), Tahafut al-Falasifa (The Incoherence of Philosophers), and al-Muniqidh min a-alal (Al-Ghazali's Path to Sufism: His Deliverance from Error) are still widely read and circulated among Islamic scholars today.  After the death of Al-Ghazali, it is believed there followed a long era in which there was a notable absence of Islamic philosophers, contributing to the status of Ghazali in the modern era.  The staple of his religious philosophy was arguing that the creator was the center point of all human life that played a direct role in all world affairs.  Al-Ghazali's influence was not limited to Islam, but in fact his works were widely circulated among Christian and Hebrew scholars and philosophers.  Some of the more notable philosophers and scholars in the west include David Hume, Dante, and St. Thomas Aquinas.  Moses Ben Maimon, a Jewish theologian was deeply interested and vested in the works of Al-Ghazali.  One of the more notable achievements of Ghazali were his writing and reform of education that laid the path of Islamic Education from the 12th to the 19th centuries CE.  Al-Ghazali's works were heavily relied upon by Islamic mathematicians and astronomers such as At-Tusi.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=AL-Ghazali|url=http://www.ibe.unesco.org/sites/default/files/ghazalie.pdf|journal=Quarterly Review of Comparative Education|volume=23|pages=3\u20134|via=}}</ref>\n\nEarly childhood development was a central focal point of Al-Ghazali.  He worked to influence and develop a program to mold the young minds of children at an early age to develop their mind and character.  He stressed that socialization, family, and schools were central in the achievement of language, morality, and behavior.  He emphasized incorporating physical fitness such as games that were important in the development of young minds to attract the idea of attending schools and maintaining an education.  In addition, he stressed the importance of understanding and sharing cultures in the classrooms to achieve a civic harmony that would be expressed outside the classroom and kindness to one another.  In his writings he placed this responsibility upon the teachers.  His treatise on early education centered on Islamic laws, God, and memorizing the Qur'an to achieve literary skill.  Ghazali emphasized the importance that there should be a dual respect in regard to the teacher and the pupil.  Whereas the teacher guides the student and takes the role of a father figure and offers council to the student, and the student respects the teacher as a patriarch.  He stressed that the teacher needed to pay attention to the learning paces of his students so that he could help them be successful in academic achievements.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Soussi|first=Khalid|date=2016-11-01|title=AL Ghazali Cultivates Education: A Comparison with Modern Theories|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317578476|journal=International Journal of Education and Research|volume=4}}</ref>\n\nAl-Ghazali was by every indication of his writings a true mystic in the Persian sense.  He believed himself to be more mystical or religious than he was philosophical however, he is more widely regarded by some scholars as a leading figure of Islamic philosophy and thought.  He describes his philosophical approach as a seeker of true knowledge, a deeper understanding of the philosophical and scientific, and a better understanding of mysticism and cognition.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Phenomenology/Ontopoiesis Retrieving Geo-cosmic Horizons of Antiquity|last=Louchakova-Schwartz|first=Olga|date=2011|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789400716902|location=Dordrecht|pages=423\u2013438|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-1691-9_33|chapter=The Self and the World: Vedanta, Sufism, and the Presocratics in a Phenomenological View}}</ref>  In the contemporary world, Al-Ghazali is renowned not only for his contribution to Sufism, Islam, Philosophy, or education.  But his work and ethical approach transcends another boundary into the Islamic business practice.  In the ''Journal of Business Ethics'', authors Yusif Sidani and Akram Al Ariss explain how Islamic business ethics are governed by the writings of Abu-Hamid Al-Ghazali and even posit that Al-Ghazali is the greatest Muslim since the prophet Muhammad.  Traditional Islamist's are influenced by Ghazali's writings since he was indebted to writing about and incorporating Sharia Law.

Many, perhaps most, later Muslims concurred and, according to Watt, some have even considered him to be the greatest Muslim after Muhammad.<ref>William Montgomery Watt, ''Al-Ghazali: The Muslim Intellectual'', p. 180. [[Edinburgh]]: [[Edinburgh University Press]], 1963.</ref>\n\nAs an example, the Islamic scholar al-Safadi stated: {{cquote| Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Ahmad, the Proof of Islam, Ornament of the Faith, Abu Hamid al-Tusi (al-Ghazali) the Shafi'ite jurist, was in his later years without rival<ref>al-Wafa bi'l wafayat, p. 274 - 277. Also see Tabaqat al-Shafiyya, subki, 4, 101.</ref>}}\n\nand the jurist, al-Yafi'i stated:\n\n{{cquote| \nHe was called The Proof of Islam and undoubtedly was worthy of the name, absolutely trustworthy (in respect of the Faith) How many an epitome (has he given) us setting forth the basic principles of religion: how much that was repetitive has he summarised, and epitomised what was lengthy. How many a simple explanation has he given us of what was hard to fathom, with brief elucidation and clear solution of knotty problems. He used moderation, being quiet but decisive in silencing an adversary, though his words were like a sharp sword-thrust in refuting a slanderer and protecting the high-road of guidance.<ref>Margaret Smith, Al-Ghazali, The Mystic, p. 47</ref>\n}}\n\nThe Shafi'i jurist al-Subki stated:\n\n{{cquote| \n\"If there had been a prophet after Muhammad, al-Ghazali would have been the man\".<ref>Tabaqat al-Shafi\u2019iyyah al-Kubra, Cairo, 1324/1906, Vol. IV, p. 101</ref><ref>Margaret Smith, Al-Ghazali, The Mystic, p. 48</ref> \n}}\n\nAlso a widely considered [[Sunni]] scholar, [[Al-Dhahabi|Al Dhahabi]] in, his praise of Al Ghazali, wrote: \u201cAl-Ghazzaali, the imaam and shaykh, the prominent scholar, Hujjat al-Islam, the wonder of his time, Zayn al-Deen Abu Haamid Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Toosi al-Shaafa\u2019i al-Ghazzaali, the author of many books and one possessed of utter intelligence. He studied fiqh in his own town, then he moved to Nisapur in the company of a group of students. He stayed with the Imaam al-Haramayn and gained a deep knowledge of fiqh within a short period. He became well-versed in \u2018ilm al-kalaam and debate, until he became the best of debater.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title = Siyar A'laam al-Nubala'|last = Al-Dhahabi|publisher = Dar Al-Hadith|year = |isbn = |location = Lebanon|pages = 323|volume = 9}}</ref>\n\nIbn Rushd ([[Averroes]]), a rationalist, famously responded that \"to say that philosophers are incoherent is itself to make an incoherent statement.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Rushd's book, ''The Incoherence of the Incoherence'', attempted to refute al-Ghazali's views, but the work was not well received in the Muslim community.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4dxbqEmU-OkC|title=The Ornament of the World: How Muslims, Jews, and Christians Created a Culture of Tolerance in Medieval Spain|first=Maria Rosa|last=Menocal|date=29 November 2009|publisher=Little, Brown|via=Google Books|isbn=9780316092791}}</ref>\n\nAccording to historian Firas Alkhateeb, \"When one reads Imam al-Ghazali\u2019s works at a very superficial level, one can easily misunderstand what he is saying as anti-scientific in general. The truth, however, is that al-Ghazali\u2019s only warning to students is to not fully accept all the beliefs and ideas of a scholar simply because of his achievements in mathematics and science. By issuing such a warning, al-Ghazali is in fact protecting the scientific enterprise for future generations by insulating it from being mixed with theoretical philosophy that could eventually dilute science itself to a field based on conjecture and reasoning alone.\"<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web|url=http://lostislamichistory.com/al-ghazali/|title=Al-Ghazali and the Revival of Islamic Scholarship|date=22 May 2013|access-date=27 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630034053/http://lostislamichistory.com/al-ghazali/|archive-date=30 June 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAl-Ghazali has been seen by Orientalist scholars of causing a decline in scientific advancement in Islam because of his refutation of the new philosophies of his time. He believed he saw danger in the statements made by philosophers that suggested that God was not all-knowing or even non-existent, which strongly contradicted his conservative Islamic belief.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Economic philosophy ==\nMost aspects of Al-Ghazali's life were heavily influenced by his Islamic beliefs, and his [[Economics|economic]] philosophy was no exception. He held economic activity to a very high level of importance in his life and thought that others should as well, as he felt that it was not only necessary for the overall benefit to society but also to achieve spiritual wholeness and salvation. In his view, the worldly life of humanity depended on the economic activity of people and so he considered being economically active to be a mandated part of the [[Sharia]] law.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Ghazanfar and Islahi|date=1997|title=Economic Thought of Al-Ghazali|url=http://www.targheeb.com/phocadownload/Trade/economics%20thoughts.pdf|journal=Islamic Economics Research Series, King Abdulaziz University|volume=2|pages=7\u201318|via=Google Scholar}}</ref>\n\nHe established three goals of economic activity that he believed were part of one's religious obligation as well as beneficial to the individual: \"achievement of self-sufficiency for one's survival; provision for the well-being of one's progeny; and provision for assisting those in economic need.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> He argued that subsistence living, or living in a way that provides the basic necessities for only one's family, would not be an acceptable practice to be held by the general population because of the detrimental results that he believed that would bring upon the economy, but he acknowledged that some people may choose to live the subsistence lifestyle at their own will for the sake of their personal religious journey. Conversely, he discouraged people from purchasing or possessing excessive material items, suggesting that any additional money earned could be given to provide for the poor.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nAl-Ghazali thought that it should not be necessary to force equality of income in society but that people should be driven by \"the spirit of Islamic brotherhood\" to share their wealth willingly, but he recognized that it is not always the case. He believed that wealth earned could be used in two potential manners. One is for good, such as maintaining the health of oneself and their family as well as taking care of others and any other actions seen as positive for the Islamic community. The other is what Al-Ghazali would consider misuse, spending it selfishly on extravagant or unnecessary material items.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nIn terms of trade, Al-Ghazali discussed the necessity of exchanging goods across close cities as well as larger borders because it allows more goods, which may be necessary and not yet available, to be accessible to more people in various locations. He recognized the necessity of trade and its overall beneficial effect on the economy, but making money in that way might not be considered the most virtuous in his beliefs. He did not support people taking \"excessive\" profits from their trade sales.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Mujaddid]]\n* [[Nas\u00eehatn\u00e2me]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation\n |first=Amber\n |last=Haque\n |year=2004\n |title=Psychology from Islamic perspective: contributions of early Muslim scholars and challenges to contemporary Muslim psychologists\n |journal=Journal of Religion & Health\n |volume=43\n |issue=4\n |pages=357\u2013377\n |doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4302-z\n }}\n* {{citation |first=Emilie |last=Savage-Smith |title=Attitudes toward dissection in medieval Islam |journal=Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences |year=1995 |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=67\u2013110 |pmid=7876530 |doi=10.1093/jhmas/50.1.67 }}\n*   Rahman, M.

Al-Ghazali reluctantly capitulated in 1106, fearing rightly that he and his teachings would meet with resistance and controversy.<ref name=\"Griffel\" /> He later returned to Tus and declined an invitation in 1110 from the grand vizier of the Seljuq Sultan [[Muhammad I (Seljuq sultan)|Muhammad I]] to return to Baghdad.

The book is divided into four different sections. The first of these is Knowledge of Self'','' where Al-Ghazali asserts that while food, sex, and other indulgences might slake humans appetites temporarily, they in turn make a human into an animal, and therefore will never give true happiness and fulfillment. In order to find oneself, people must devote themselves to God by showing restraint and discipline rather than gluttony of the senses ''.'' The second installment is called Knowledge of God, where Al-Ghazali states that the events that occur during one's life are meant to point an individual towards God, and that God will always be strong, no matter how far humans deviate from His will. The third section of ''[[The Alchemy of Happiness]]'' is Knowledge of the World. Here he states that the world is merely a place where humans learn to love God, and prepare for the future, or the afterlife, the nature of which will be determined by our actions in this phase of our journey to happiness''.'' The final section is Knowledge of the Future World, which details how there are two types of spirits within a man: the angelic spirit and the animal spirit. Al-Ghazali details the types of spiritual tortures unbelievers experience, as well as the path that must be taken in order to attain spiritual enlightenment''.'' This book serves as a culmination of the transformation Ghazali goes through during his spiritual awakening.\n\n'''<big>Disciplining the Soul</big>'''\n\nOne of the key sections of Ghazali's ''[[The Revival of the Religious Sciences|Revival of the Religious Sciences]]'' is ''Disciplining the Soul'', which focuses on the internal struggles that every Muslim will face over the course of his lifetime.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Al-Ghazali on Disciplining the Soul and on Breaking the Two Desires|last=Winter|first=T.J|publisher=The Islamic Text Society|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The first chapter primarily focuses on how one can develop himself into a person with positive attributes and good personal characteristics . The second chapter has a more specific focus: sexual satisfaction and [[gluttony]].<ref name=\":2\" /> Here, Ghazali states that indeed every man has these desires and needs, and that it is natural to want these things.<ref name=\":2\" /> However, the Prophet explicitly states that there must be a middle ground for man, in order to practice the tenets of Islam faithfully . The ultimate goal that Ghazali is presenting not only in these two chapters, but in the entirety of ''The'' ''Revival of the Religious Sciences'', is that there must be moderation in every aspect of the soul of a man, an equilibrium. These two chapters were the 22nd and 23rd chapters, respectively, in Ghazali's ''Revival of the Religious Sciences''<ref name=\":2\" />''.'' It's also important to note here that Ghazali draws from Greek as well as Islamic philosophy in crafting this literary staple, even though much of ''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]],'' his most well known work, takes a critical aim at their perspective.\n\n'''<big>The Eternity of the World</big>'''\n\nAl-Ghazali crafted his rebuttal of the Aristotelian viewpoint on the creation of the world in ''The Eternity of the World .'' Al-Ghazali essentially formulates two main arguments for what he views as a sacrilegious thought process. Central to the [[Eternity of the world|Aristotelian]] approach is the concept that motion will always precede motion, or in other words, a force will always create another force, and therefore for a force to be created, another force must act upon that force.<ref name=\":0\" /> This means that in essence time stretches infinitely both into the future and into the past, which therefore proves that [[God]] did not create the universe at one specific point in time. Ghazali counters this by first stating that if the world was created with exact boundaries, then in its current form there would be no need for a time before the creation of the world by God.<ref name=\":0\" />  The second argument Ghazali makes is that because humans can only imagine the time before the creation of the world, and your imagination is a fictional thing, that all the time before the world was created is fictional as well, and therefore does not matter as it was not intended by God to be understood by humans.\n\n<big>'''The Decisive Criterion for Distinguishing Islam from Clandestine Unbelief'''</big>\n\nAl-Ghazali lays out in ''The'' ''Decisive Criterion for Distinguishing Islam from Clandestine Unbelief'' his approach to Muslim orthodoxy. Ghazali veers from the often hardline stance of many of his contemporaries during this time period and states that as long as one believes in the [[Muhammad|Prophet Muhammad]] and God himself, there are many different ways to practice Islam and that any of the many traditions practiced in good faith by believers should not be viewed as heretical by other Muslims.<ref name=\"Griffel\" /> While Ghazali does state that any Muslim practicing Islam in good faith is not guilty of [[apostasy]], he does outline in ''The Criterion'' that there is one standard of Islam that is more correct than the others, and that those practicing the faith incorrectly should be moved to change.<ref name=\"Griffel\" /> In Ghazali's view, only the Prophet himself could deem a faithfully practicing Muslim an infidel, and his work was a pushback against the religious persecution and strife that occurred often during this time period between various Islamic sects.<ref name=\"Griffel\" />\n\n===Works in Persian===\n\nAl-Ghazali wrote most of his works in [[Arabic]] and few in [[Persian language|Persian]]. His most important Persian work is [[Kimiya-yi sa'\u0101dat|''K\u012bmy\u0101y\u00e9 Sa'\u0101dat'']] (The Alchemy of Happiness). It is al-Ghazali's own Persian version of ''Ihya'ul ulumuddin'' (The Revival of Religious Sciences) in Arabic, but a shorter work. It is one of the outstanding works of 11th-century-Persian literature. The book was published several times in [[Tehran]] by the edition of Hussain Khadev-jam, a renowned Iranian scholar. It is translated to [[English language|English]], [[Arabic]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Urdu]], [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] and other languages.<ref name=\"Kimiya\">Translated into English by Mohammed Asim Bilal and available at [https://archive.org/details/KimiyaISaadatAnEnglishTranslationOfImamGhazzalisAlchemyOfEternalBlissabuHamidAlGhazali archive.org]</ref>\n\nApart from Kimya, the most celebrated of al-Ghazali's works in Persian is '''Nas\u012bhatul Mul\u016bk'' (The Counseling Kings), written most probably for Sultan [[Ahmed Sanjar|Ahmad Sanjar ibn Malekshah]]. In the edition published by Jal\u0101ludd\u012bn Hum\u0101y\u012b, the book consists of two parts of which only the first can reliably be attributed to al-Ghazali. The language and the contents of some passages are similar to the Kimyaye Sa'adat. The second part differs considerably in content and style from the well-known writings of al-Ghazali. It contains the stories of pre-Islamic kings of [[Persia]], especially those of [[Khosrau I|Anosherv\u0101n]]. Nasihatul Muluk was early translated to Arabic under the title '' al-Tibr al-masbuk fi nasihat al-muluk'' (The Forged Sword in Counseling Kings).\n\n''Z\u0101d-e \u0100kherat'' (Provision for the hereafter) is an important Persian book of al-Ghazali but gained less scholarly attention. The greater part of it consists of the Persian translation of one of his Arabic books, ''Bed\u0101yat al-Hed\u0101ya'' (Beginning of Guidance). It contains in addition the same contents as the K\u012bmy\u0101y\u00e9 Sa'\u0101dat. The book was most probably written during the last years of his life. Its manuscripts are in [[Kabul]] (Library of the Department of Press) and in [[Leiden]].\n\n'''Pand-n\u0101ma''' (Book of Counsel) is another book of advice and probably attributed to Sultan Sanjar. The introduction to the book relates that Al-Ghazali wrote the book in response to a certain king who had asked him for advice. '''Ay farzand''' (O son!) is a short book of counsel that al-Ghazali wrote for one of his students. The book was early translated to Arabic entitled ''ayyuhal walad''. Another Persian work is '''Ham\u0101q\u0101ti ahli ib\u0101hat''' or '''Raddi eb\u0101h\u012byya''' (Condemnation of antinomians) which is his ''[[fatwa]]'' in Persian illustrated with [[Quran]]ic verses and [[Hadith]]s.\n\n'''Faza'ilul al-anam min rasa'ili hujjat al-Islam''' is the collection of letters in Persian that al-Ghazali wrote in response to the kings, ministers, jurists and some of his friends after he returned to [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]]. The collection was gathered by one of his grandchildren after his death, under five sections/chapters. The longest letter is the response to objections raised against some of his statements in ''Mishkat al-Anwar'' (The Niche of Light) and ''al-Munqidh min al-dalal'' (Rescuer from Error). The first letter is the one which al-Ghazali wrote to [[Ahmed Sanjar|Sultan Sanjar]] presenting his excuse for teaching in [[Nizamiyya]] of [[Nishapur]]; followed by al-Ghazali's speech in the court of Sultan Sanjar. Al-Ghazali makes an impressive speech when he was taken to the king's court in Nishapur in 1106, giving very influential counsels, asking the sultan once again for excusing him from teaching in Nizamiyya. The sultan was so impressed that he ordered al-Ghazali to write down his speech so that it will be sent to all the [[ulema]]s of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Persian Iraq|Iraq]].\n\n==Influence==\n{{Full citations needed|section|date=November 2019}}<!-- The quotations, quotation marks, and references are jumbled, and the latter need to be expanded into full citations. -->\nDuring his life, he authored over 70 books on science, Islamic reasoning and Sufism.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith, Margaret, \u201cThe Forerunner of al-Ghazali\", Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1936, pp. 65-78.|first=Margaret|date=1936|title=The Forerunner of Al-Ghazali|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=13|via=}}</ref> Al-Ghazali distributed his book ''The Incoherence of Philosophers'', set apart as the defining moment in Islamic epistemology. The experience that he had with suspicion drove al-Ghazali to shape a conviction that all occasions and connections are not the result of material conjunctions but are the present and prompt will of God.\n\nAnother of al-Ghazali's most prestigious works is ''Ihya' Ulum al-Din'' (\"The Revival of Religious Sciences\"). The work covers all fields of Islamic science and incorporates Islamic statute, philosophy and Sufism. It had numerous positive reactions, and Al-Ghazali at that point composed a condensed form in Persian under the title ''Kimiya-yi sa'adat'' (\"The Alchemy of Happiness\"). Although al-Ghazali said that he has composed more than 70 books, attributed to him are more than 400 books.\n\nAl-Ghazali likewise assumed a noteworthy part in spreading Sufism and Sharia. He was the first to consolidate the ideas of Sufism into Sharia laws and the first to give a formal depiction of Sufism in his works. His works fortify the position of Sunni Islam, contrasted with different schools of thought.\n\nAl-Ghazali had an important influence on both later [[Muslim philosophers]] and [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Medieval philosophy|medieval philosophers]]. [[Margaret Smith (author)|Margaret Smith]] writes in her book ''Al-Ghazali: The Mystic'' (London 1944): \"There can be no doubt that al-Ghazali\u2019s works would be among the first to attract the attention of these European scholars\" (page 220). Then she emphasizes, \"The greatest of these Christian writers who was influenced by al-Ghazali was St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225\u20131274), who made a study of the Arabic writers and admitted his indebtedness to them, having studied at the [[University of Naples]] where the influence of Arab literature and culture was predominant at the time.\" In addition, Aquinas' interest in Islamic studies could be attributed to the infiltration of \u2018Latin Averroism\u2019 in the 13th century, especially at the [[University of Paris]].\n\nThe period following Ghazali \"has tentatively been called the Golden Age of Arabic philosophy\" initiated by Ghazali's successful integration of [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|logic into the Islamic]] seminary [[Madrasah]] curriculum.<ref name=Stanford>\n\"Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee had successfully introduced logic into the madrasa (though it was studied in other venues as well (Endress 2006)). What happened to it after this time was the result of the activities of logicians much more gifted than Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee. This period has tentatively been called the Golden Age of Arabic philosophy (Gutas 2002). It is in this period, and especially in the thirteenth century, that the major changes in the coverage and structure of Avicennan logic were introduced; these changes were mainly introduced in free-standing treatises on logic. It has been observed that the thirteenth century was the time that \u201cdoing logic in Arabic was thoroughly disconnected from textual exegesis, perhaps more so than at any time before or since\u201d (El-Rouayheb 2010b: 48\u201349). Many of the major textbooks for teaching logic in later centuries come from this period. [...] For all his historical importance in the process of introducing logic into the madrasa, the logic that Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee defended was too dilute to be recognizably Farabian or Avicennan.\"\n{{cite encyclopedia|author=Tony Street|title=Arabic and Islamic Philosophy of Language and Logic|encyclopedia=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|date=July 23, 2008|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/arabic-islamic-language|accessdate=2008-12-05}}</ref>\n\nAl-Ghazali also played a major role in integrating [[Sufism]] with [[Shariah]]. He was also the first to present a formal description of Sufism in his works. His works also strengthened the status of [[Sunni Islam]] against other schools. The [[Batiniyya|Batinite]] ([[Ismailism]]) had emerged in [[Persia]]n territories and were gaining more and more power during al-Ghazali's period, as [[Nizam al-Mulk]] was assassinated by the members of Ismailis. Al-Ghazali strongly rejected their ideology and wrote several books on criticism of Baatinyas which significantly weakened their status.\n\nAl-Ghazali succeeded in gaining widespread acceptance for Sufism at the expense of philosophy.<ref name=sells>{{cite book|author=Sells, Michael Anthony|title=Early Islamic Mysticism: Sufi, Qur\u02bcan, Miraj, Poetic and Theological Writings|publisher=New York: Paulist|year=1996|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BrU54SYQSyoC&pg=PA24|isbn=9780809136193}}</ref> At the same time, in his refutation of philosophers he made use of their philosophical categories and thus helped to give them wider circulation.<ref name=sells/>\n\nHis influences and impact on Sufism and Islam during the 11th century has been a subject of debate in contemporary times.  Some fifty works that he had written is evidenced that he was one of the most important Islamic thinkers of his time.  Three of his works, Ihaya' Ulum ad-Din (Revival of Religious Sciences), Tahafut al-Falasifa (The Incoherence of Philosophers), and al-Muniqidh min a-alal (Al-Ghazali's Path to Sufism: His Deliverance from Error) are still widely read and circulated among Islamic scholars today.  After the death of Al-Ghazali, it is believed there followed a long era in which there was a notable absence of Islamic philosophers, contributing to the status of Ghazali in the modern era.  The staple of his religious philosophy was arguing that the creator was the center point of all human life that played a direct role in all world affairs.  Al-Ghazali's influence was not limited to Islam, but in fact his works were widely circulated among Christian and Hebrew scholars and philosophers.  Some of the more notable philosophers and scholars in the west include David Hume, Dante, and St. Thomas Aquinas.  Moses Ben Maimon, a Jewish theologian was deeply interested and vested in the works of Al-Ghazali.  One of the more notable achievements of Ghazali were his writing and reform of education that laid the path of Islamic Education from the 12th to the 19th centuries CE.  Al-Ghazali's works were heavily relied upon by Islamic mathematicians and astronomers such as At-Tusi.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=AL-Ghazali|url=http://www.ibe.unesco.org/sites/default/files/ghazalie.pdf|journal=Quarterly Review of Comparative Education|volume=23|pages=3\u20134|via=}}</ref>\n\nEarly childhood development was a central focal point of Al-Ghazali.  He worked to influence and develop a program to mold the young minds of children at an early age to develop their mind and character.  He stressed that socialization, family, and schools were central in the achievement of language, morality, and behavior.  He emphasized incorporating physical fitness such as games that were important in the development of young minds to attract the idea of attending schools and maintaining an education.  In addition, he stressed the importance of understanding and sharing cultures in the classrooms to achieve a civic harmony that would be expressed outside the classroom and kindness to one another.  In his writings he placed this responsibility upon the teachers.  His treatise on early education centered on Islamic laws, God, and memorizing the Qur'an to achieve literary skill.  Ghazali emphasized the importance that there should be a dual respect in regard to the teacher and the pupil.  Whereas the teacher guides the student and takes the role of a father figure and offers council to the student, and the student respects the teacher as a patriarch.  He stressed that the teacher needed to pay attention to the learning paces of his students so that he could help them be successful in academic achievements.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Soussi|first=Khalid|date=2016-11-01|title=AL Ghazali Cultivates Education: A Comparison with Modern Theories|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317578476|journal=International Journal of Education and Research|volume=4}}</ref>\n\nAl-Ghazali was by every indication of his writings a true mystic in the Persian sense.  He believed himself to be more mystical or religious than he was philosophical however, he is more widely regarded by some scholars as a leading figure of Islamic philosophy and thought.  He describes his philosophical approach as a seeker of true knowledge, a deeper understanding of the philosophical and scientific, and a better understanding of mysticism and cognition.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Phenomenology/Ontopoiesis Retrieving Geo-cosmic Horizons of Antiquity|last=Louchakova-Schwartz|first=Olga|date=2011|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789400716902|location=Dordrecht|pages=423\u2013438|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-1691-9_33|chapter=The Self and the World: Vedanta, Sufism, and the Presocratics in a Phenomenological View}}</ref>  In the contemporary world, Al-Ghazali is renowned not only for his contribution to Sufism, Islam, Philosophy, or education.  But his work and ethical approach transcends another boundary into the Islamic business practice.  In the ''Journal of Business Ethics'', authors Yusif Sidani and Akram Al Ariss explain how Islamic business ethics are governed by the writings of Abu-Hamid Al-Ghazali and even posit that Al-Ghazali is the greatest Muslim since the prophet Muhammad.  Traditional Islamist's are influenced by Ghazali's writings since he was indebted to writing about and incorporating Sharia Law.  They emphasize, \"His mastery of philosophical logic and reasoning earned him the title of philosopher without losing his status as a religious scholar.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sidani|first=Yusuf|last2=Al Ariss|first2=Akram|date=2014-04-04|title=New Conceptual Foundations for Islamic Business Ethics: The Contributions of Abu-Hamid Al-Ghazali|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|language=en|volume=129|issue=4|pages=847\u2013857|doi=10.1007/s10551-014-2136-5|issn=0167-4544}}</ref>  Al-Ghazili's reasoning on the use of intellect in combination with the rational and spiritual is an integral part of Muslim society today.

By issuing such a warning, al-Ghazali is in fact protecting the scientific enterprise for future generations by insulating it from being mixed with theoretical philosophy that could eventually dilute science itself to a field based on conjecture and reasoning alone.\"<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web|url=http://lostislamichistory.com/al-ghazali/|title=Al-Ghazali and the Revival of Islamic Scholarship|date=22 May 2013|access-date=27 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630034053/http://lostislamichistory.com/al-ghazali/|archive-date=30 June 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAl-Ghazali has been seen by Orientalist scholars of causing a decline in scientific advancement in Islam because of his refutation of the new philosophies of his time. He believed he saw danger in the statements made by philosophers that suggested that God was not all-knowing or even non-existent, which strongly contradicted his conservative Islamic belief.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Economic philosophy ==\nMost aspects of Al-Ghazali's life were heavily influenced by his Islamic beliefs, and his [[Economics|economic]] philosophy was no exception. He held economic activity to a very high level of importance in his life and thought that others should as well, as he felt that it was not only necessary for the overall benefit to society but also to achieve spiritual wholeness and salvation. In his view, the worldly life of humanity depended on the economic activity of people and so he considered being economically active to be a mandated part of the [[Sharia]] law.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Ghazanfar and Islahi|date=1997|title=Economic Thought of Al-Ghazali|url=http://www.targheeb.com/phocadownload/Trade/economics%20thoughts.pdf|journal=Islamic Economics Research Series, King Abdulaziz University|volume=2|pages=7\u201318|via=Google Scholar}}</ref>\n\nHe established three goals of economic activity that he believed were part of one's religious obligation as well as beneficial to the individual: \"achievement of self-sufficiency for one's survival; provision for the well-being of one's progeny; and provision for assisting those in economic need.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> He argued that subsistence living, or living in a way that provides the basic necessities for only one's family, would not be an acceptable practice to be held by the general population because of the detrimental results that he believed that would bring upon the economy, but he acknowledged that some people may choose to live the subsistence lifestyle at their own will for the sake of their personal religious journey. Conversely, he discouraged people from purchasing or possessing excessive material items, suggesting that any additional money earned could be given to provide for the poor.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nAl-Ghazali thought that it should not be necessary to force equality of income in society but that people should be driven by \"the spirit of Islamic brotherhood\" to share their wealth willingly, but he recognized that it is not always the case. He believed that wealth earned could be used in two potential manners. One is for good, such as maintaining the health of oneself and their family as well as taking care of others and any other actions seen as positive for the Islamic community. The other is what Al-Ghazali would consider misuse, spending it selfishly on extravagant or unnecessary material items.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nIn terms of trade, Al-Ghazali discussed the necessity of exchanging goods across close cities as well as larger borders because it allows more goods, which may be necessary and not yet available, to be accessible to more people in various locations. He recognized the necessity of trade and its overall beneficial effect on the economy, but making money in that way might not be considered the most virtuous in his beliefs. He did not support people taking \"excessive\" profits from their trade sales.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Mujaddid]]\n* [[Nas\u00eehatn\u00e2me]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation\n |first=Amber\n |last=Haque\n |year=2004\n |title=Psychology from Islamic perspective: contributions of early Muslim scholars and challenges to contemporary Muslim psychologists\n |journal=Journal of Religion & Health\n |volume=43\n |issue=4\n |pages=357\u2013377\n |doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4302-z\n }}\n* {{citation |first=Emilie |last=Savage-Smith |title=Attitudes toward dissection in medieval Islam |journal=Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences |year=1995 |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=67\u2013110 |pmid=7876530 |doi=10.1093/jhmas/50.1.67 }}\n*   Rahman, M.

In 1821, Charsley formed a partnership with William Barker, creating Charsley & Barker. Later that century, Phillip Rose (later [[Sir Philip Rose, 1st Baronet|Sir Philip Rose]]) joined the firm, creating Barker & Rose. In the years that followed, a new partnership between Phillip Rose and Henry Elland Norton was formed under the name Barker, Rose & Norton. By the turn of the 20th century, the firm was called Norton, Rose, Norton & Co., and had maintained its position as a powerful force in the City of London for six decades.{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n\nIn 1960, the firm, by then re-named Norton, Rose & Co., amalgamated with specialist shipping firm Botterell & Roche (founded 1861) to form Norton, Rose, Botterell & Roche. With its expertise in shipping, the firm benefited from the growth of the international shipping market in the early 1960s, and was involved in the nationalization of [[British Steel (1967\u20131999)|British Steel]] and the after-arrangement of its subsidiary companies.{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n\nThe firm continued to grow, and in 1976 established its first international office in Hong Kong, followed by Bahrain in 1979 and Singapore in 1982. By 1988, the firm had shortened its name and over the next ten years Norton Rose commenced a programme of international expansion, with the establishment of offices across Asia, Europe and the Middle East, taking the firm\u2019s international operations to 22 offices.

In 1821, Charsley formed a partnership with William Barker, creating Charsley & Barker. Later that century, Phillip Rose (later [[Sir Philip Rose, 1st Baronet|Sir Philip Rose]]) joined the firm, creating Barker & Rose. In the years that followed, a new partnership between Phillip Rose and Henry Elland Norton was formed under the name Barker, Rose & Norton. By the turn of the 20th century, the firm was called Norton, Rose, Norton & Co., and had maintained its position as a powerful force in the City of London for six decades.{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n\nIn 1960, the firm, by then re-named Norton, Rose & Co., amalgamated with specialist shipping firm Botterell & Roche (founded 1861) to form Norton, Rose, Botterell & Roche. With its expertise in shipping, the firm benefited from the growth of the international shipping market in the early 1960s, and was involved in the nationalization of [[British Steel (1967\u20131999)|British Steel]] and the after-arrangement of its subsidiary companies.{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n\nThe firm continued to grow, and in 1976 established its first international office in Hong Kong, followed by Bahrain in 1979 and Singapore in 1982. By 1988, the firm had shortened its name and over the next ten years Norton Rose commenced a programme of international expansion, with the establishment of offices across Asia, Europe and the Middle East, taking the firm\u2019s international operations to 22 offices. In 2007, Norton Rose converted to a Limited Liability Partnership.{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n\nWith a vision to become one of the world\u2019s top global legal brands, Norton Rose embarked on the first phase of rapid expansion when it combined with Australian firm Deacons in 2010, adding to the strength and size of the firm across the Asia-Pacific region.

[[AllMusic]] editor Andy Kellman gave note of the record's short running time allowing equal attention for each track and the overall throwback aesthetic being the same as Musiq's previous efforts and not containing \"insincere trend-hopping or ill-fitting collaborations with hot MCs.\" He concluded that \"[T]hey're neither raunchy nor drab, and they're nearly a lost art form in 2007.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> DJBooth's Nathan Slavik gave praise to the musicianship feeling mature throughout the record's track list of slow jams and crowd pleasers, despite the former's combination of lush minimalism and sincere lyricism coming across as \"background music.\" He concluded that, \"If Musiq\u2019s sole intention for this album was to remind us he\u2019s alive, mission accomplished. ''Luvanmusiq'' has several solid tracks, and a couple excellent ones, but as a whole it falls just short of excellent.\"<ref name=\"DJB\"/> Mark Edward Nero from [[About.com]] gave a mixed review of the album, commending Musiq for remaining consistent in terms of his \"soft, deliberate vocal style\" and penchant for romantic ballads but felt that it comes across as though he's shown \"little creative growth as a singer.\" He highlighted the tracks \"Betterman\", \"Makeyouhappy\" and \"Ridiculous\" for having enough content to stand alongside the first single \"B.U.D.D.Y.\" and showcasing Musiq's continued talent as \"one of the better R&B songwriters in the business today\", concluding that \"Although ''Luvanmusiq'' rates pretty low in the excitement and thrills departments, if you take the time to listen to it repeatedly, it's an album whose subtle romantic charm grows on you.\"<ref name=\"About\"/>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{track listing\n| extra_column    = Producer(s)\n| title1          = [[B.U.D.D.Y.]]\n| writer1         = T.

[[AllMusic]] editor Andy Kellman gave note of the record's short running time allowing equal attention for each track and the overall throwback aesthetic being the same as Musiq's previous efforts and not containing \"insincere trend-hopping or ill-fitting collaborations with hot MCs.\" He concluded that \"[T]hey're neither raunchy nor drab, and they're nearly a lost art form in 2007.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> DJBooth's Nathan Slavik gave praise to the musicianship feeling mature throughout the record's track list of slow jams and crowd pleasers, despite the former's combination of lush minimalism and sincere lyricism coming across as \"background music.\" He concluded that, \"If Musiq\u2019s sole intention for this album was to remind us he\u2019s alive, mission accomplished. ''Luvanmusiq'' has several solid tracks, and a couple excellent ones, but as a whole it falls just short of excellent.\"<ref name=\"DJB\"/> Mark Edward Nero from [[About.com]] gave a mixed review of the album, commending Musiq for remaining consistent in terms of his \"soft, deliberate vocal style\" and penchant for romantic ballads but felt that it comes across as though he's shown \"little creative growth as a singer.\" He highlighted the tracks \"Betterman\", \"Makeyouhappy\" and \"Ridiculous\" for having enough content to stand alongside the first single \"B.U.D.D.Y.\" and showcasing Musiq's continued talent as \"one of the better R&B songwriters in the business today\", concluding that \"Although ''Luvanmusiq'' rates pretty low in the excitement and thrills departments, if you take the time to listen to it repeatedly, it's an album whose subtle romantic charm grows on you.\"<ref name=\"About\"/>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{track listing\n| extra_column    = Producer(s)\n| title1          = [[B.U.D.D.Y.]]\n| writer1         = T.

At Parliament Hill, the two addressed their followers.\n\nBurdi then led the group to the Chateau Laurier, where he led a charge across the street to confront protesters. During the charge, Alicia Reckzin  was struck on the head while running from Burdi's supporters. When she fell, she was kicked several times on her right side; Reckzin later reported having seen Burdi kick her in the face.\n\nIn 1995, as a result of the violent confrontation, Burdi was convicted of [[assault causing bodily harm]], and sentenced to 12 months imprisonment. Burdi appealed both his conviction and the sentence, but on February 14, 1997, the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] upheld the lower court's 1995 decision ([[s:HMQ vs George Burdi|O.J. No. 554 No. C21788/C21820]]), and Burdi began his sentence. The court \"ruled him out as the kicker,\" but he was found guilty of vicarious liability by having led the charge across the street. Burdi continues to deny having assaulted Reckzin.\n\n=== Renunciation of racism ===\nIn 1997, much of Resistance Record's inventory and business paraphernalia were seized in an April raid by the [[Oakland County, Michigan]] Sheriff's Department, the [[Michigan Department of the Treasury]], and the [[Ontario Provincial Police]]. The same day this raid was carried out in Michigan, Burdi was arrested in [[Windsor, Ontario]], for contravening the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Canadian Criminal Code]] provisions against promoting hatred.\n\nConvicted in Windsor, Burdi was able to avoid a jail sentence with the condition that he not be involved with RaHoWa or Resistance Records. He sold the company to [[Willis Carto]] who soon sold it to [[National Alliance (Canada)|National Alliance]] head [[William Luther Pierce]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Atkins|first=Stephen|title=Encyclopedia of Right-Wing Extremism in Modern American History|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1598843507|page=62}}</ref><ref>[http://www.adl.org/resistance_records/introduction.asp Deafening Hate: The Revival of Resistance Records<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620073603/http://adl.org/resistance_records/introduction.asp |date=20 June 2010 }}</ref> Burdi then renounced white nationalism.<ref>{{cite news |title= 'Hatecore' uses music to lure angry white youth |author= Tony Norman |url= http://www.post-gazette.com/columnists/20020219tony0219p3.asp |newspaper= Post-Gazette |date= 19 February 2002 |accessdate=27 January 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2001-01-25/news.html A racist no longer: Ex-white rights fan just wants to be a rock star] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050111031141/http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2001-01-25/news.html |date=11 January 2005 }} 25 January 2001 article from [[Toronto]]'s ''[[Now (newspaper)|Now Magazine]]''.</ref>\n\n=== Return to racism ===\nIn 2017, Burdi revealed that he felt he had never truly abandoned white nationalism and claimed that the media took statements that he made during his hiatus from \"the movement\" out of context. Burdi maintained contact with up to 100 individuals active in right-wing extremist movements, mainly in Europe, throughout the period in which he had allegedly abandoned racism. Burdi further stated that the esoteric neo-Nazi [[Savitri Devi]], who combined [[Nazism]] with [[Hinduism]], sparked his interest in Hinduism and helped him connect with his Hindu wife. Burdi also stated that he views the development of the [[alt-right]] as a positive thing and questions whether he ever would have abandoned [[neo-Nazism]] if he had lived in Europe at the time of his disillusionment with the [[skinhead]] scene.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2EKphh-Cno]{{dead link|date=April 2020}}</ref> In the same year, there appeared a bootleg RaHoWa album with lyrics glorifying [[white supremacy]], calling white people \"the greatest race to ever walk the earth.\"<ref>http://www.lyricsfreak.com/r/rahowa/ode+to+a+dying+people_20772418.html</ref> Burdi has disclaimed currently holding these views.\n\nIn the same interview with the German neo-Nazis, Burdi praises a fascist musical group from France called Les Brigandes and their music video \"Le grand remplacement\", which promotes a conspiracy theory alleging that Jews are in favor of an \"Islamic invasion\" of Europe in order to bring about conditions for the coming of the \"[[Messiah]] of Israel.\"\n\n===Novacosm===\nIn 1998 Burdi founded the multi-racial band Novacosm.<ref name=\"Kinsella2011\">{{cite book|author=Warren Kinsella|title=Fury's Hour: A (sort-of) Punk Manifesto|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tAKSNLj1wGEC&pg=PT166|date=27 July 2011|publisher=Random House of Canada|isbn=978-0-307-36972-7|pages=166\u2013}}</ref>  The band, with Burdi on vocals and guitar, B.

Love, author of ''Trendy Fascism'', remarked, during a 2018 interview with ''The Financial Times'', that, after having been \"silent for almost 20 years but in 2017 resurfaced, emboldened by the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump presidency]] and also the turn to the right in Europe\u201d.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hunter-Tilney |first1=Ludovic |title=The re-emergence of white supremacist pop |url=https://www.ft.com/content/68033ace-9732-11e8-b747-fb1e803ee64e |accessdate=9 November 2019 |publisher=The Financial Times Ltd. |date=17 August 2018 |language=EN}}</ref>\n\n=== Reckzin incident ===\nIn [[Ottawa]], on May 29, 1993, after a RaHoWa concert which was picketed by [[Anti-Racist Action]] protesters, Burdi and the leader of the White nationalist Heritage Front, [[Wolfgang Droege]], led their supporters on a march to [[Parliament Hill]], chanting \"[[Nazi salute|sieg heil]]\", making racist remarks, and giving the [[Hitler salute]]. At Parliament Hill, the two addressed their followers.\n\nBurdi then led the group to the Chateau Laurier, where he led a charge across the street to confront protesters. During the charge, Alicia Reckzin  was struck on the head while running from Burdi's supporters. When she fell, she was kicked several times on her right side; Reckzin later reported having seen Burdi kick her in the face.\n\nIn 1995, as a result of the violent confrontation, Burdi was convicted of [[assault causing bodily harm]], and sentenced to 12 months imprisonment. Burdi appealed both his conviction and the sentence, but on February 14, 1997, the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] upheld the lower court's 1995 decision ([[s:HMQ vs George Burdi|O.J. No. 554 No. C21788/C21820]]), and Burdi began his sentence. The court \"ruled him out as the kicker,\" but he was found guilty of vicarious liability by having led the charge across the street. Burdi continues to deny having assaulted Reckzin.\n\n=== Renunciation of racism ===\nIn 1997, much of Resistance Record's inventory and business paraphernalia were seized in an April raid by the [[Oakland County, Michigan]] Sheriff's Department, the [[Michigan Department of the Treasury]], and the [[Ontario Provincial Police]]. The same day this raid was carried out in Michigan, Burdi was arrested in [[Windsor, Ontario]], for contravening the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Canadian Criminal Code]] provisions against promoting hatred.\n\nConvicted in Windsor, Burdi was able to avoid a jail sentence with the condition that he not be involved with RaHoWa or Resistance Records. He sold the company to [[Willis Carto]] who soon sold it to [[National Alliance (Canada)|National Alliance]] head [[William Luther Pierce]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Atkins|first=Stephen|title=Encyclopedia of Right-Wing Extremism in Modern American History|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1598843507|page=62}}</ref><ref>[http://www.adl.org/resistance_records/introduction.asp Deafening Hate: The Revival of Resistance Records<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620073603/http://adl.org/resistance_records/introduction.asp |date=20 June 2010 }}</ref> Burdi then renounced white nationalism.<ref>{{cite news |title= 'Hatecore' uses music to lure angry white youth |author= Tony Norman |url= http://www.post-gazette.com/columnists/20020219tony0219p3.asp |newspaper= Post-Gazette |date= 19 February 2002 |accessdate=27 January 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2001-01-25/news.html A racist no longer: Ex-white rights fan just wants to be a rock star] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050111031141/http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2001-01-25/news.html |date=11 January 2005 }} 25 January 2001 article from [[Toronto]]'s ''[[Now (newspaper)|Now Magazine]]''.</ref>\n\n=== Return to racism ===\nIn 2017, Burdi revealed that he felt he had never truly abandoned white nationalism and claimed that the media took statements that he made during his hiatus from \"the movement\" out of context. Burdi maintained contact with up to 100 individuals active in right-wing extremist movements, mainly in Europe, throughout the period in which he had allegedly abandoned racism. Burdi further stated that the esoteric neo-Nazi [[Savitri Devi]], who combined [[Nazism]] with [[Hinduism]], sparked his interest in Hinduism and helped him connect with his Hindu wife. Burdi also stated that he views the development of the [[alt-right]] as a positive thing and questions whether he ever would have abandoned [[neo-Nazism]] if he had lived in Europe at the time of his disillusionment with the [[skinhead]] scene.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2EKphh-Cno</ref> In the same year, there appeared a bootleg RaHoWa album with lyrics glorifying [[white supremacy]], calling white people \"the greatest race to ever walk the earth.\"<ref>http://www.lyricsfreak.com/r/rahowa/ode+to+a+dying+people_20772418.html</ref> Burdi has disclaimed currently holding these views.\n\nIn the same interview with the German neo-Nazis, Burdi praises a fascist musical group from France called Les Brigandes and their music video \"Le grand remplacement\", which promotes a conspiracy theory alleging that Jews are in favor of an \"Islamic invasion\" of Europe in order to bring about conditions for the coming of the \"[[Messiah]] of Israel.\"\n\n===Novacosm===\nIn 1998 Burdi founded the multi-racial band Novacosm.<ref name=\"Kinsella2011\">{{cite book|author=Warren Kinsella|title=Fury's Hour: A (sort-of) Punk Manifesto|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tAKSNLj1wGEC&pg=PT166|date=27 July 2011|publisher=Random House of Canada|isbn=978-0-307-36972-7|pages=166\u2013}}</ref>  The band, with Burdi on vocals and guitar, B.
