The team had no official name, although they had been referred to as \"The In Crowd\" or \"The Dirt Sheet Duo\", after the name of their [[Slammy Award]]-winning online webshow, ''[[ECW (WWE)#Recurring segments|The Dirt Sheet]]''. Both were former ''[[WWE Tough Enough]]'' contestants, with Morrison winning the show's [[WWE Tough Enough#Tough Enough III|third season]] and Miz the runner-up of its [[WWE Tough Enough#$1,000,000 Tough Enough (season 4)|fourth season]].\n\nThey first began teaming together in November 2007. Originally rivals, John Morrison and The Miz became partners as a result of winning the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Championship]] and making the title exclusive to the ECW brand, for a brief time. They eventually [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Drop|dropped]] the title in July 2008. During their title reign, Morrison and Miz developed a gimmick that resulted in the duo being given their own webshow, ''The Dirt Sheet'', and their own in-ring interview segment of the same name on ECW. In December 2008, they won the Slammy Award in the category for Tag Team of the Year and won the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Championship]]. The team split in April 2009, after Miz was drafted to the Raw brand and Morrison was drafted to the SmackDown brand as part of the [[2009 WWE draft]].\n\nAfter the team disbanded, Morrison and Miz sporadically feuded with each other until Morrison's departure from WWE in November 2011. They reunited in January 2020 after Morrison returned to WWE. They won the [[SmackDown Tag Team Championship]] shortly thereafter, becoming only the second team (after [[The Hardy Boyz|The Hardys]]) to win WWE's original World Tag Team, the 2002 established WWE (now Raw) Tag Team, and SmackDown Tag Team Championships, making them overall three-time Tag Team Champions in WWE.\n\n==History==\n===Tag Team Championship reigns (2007\u20132009)===\n[[File:Morrison and Miz 2009.jpg|thumb|left|John Morrison (right) and The Miz (left)]]\nBefore they formed a partnership, [[John Morrison (wrestler)|John Morrison]] and [[The Miz]] were opponents, competing for the [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship|ECW Championship]] in October 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/ecw-wwe/071016.html|title=ECW on Sci-Fi Results&nbsp;\u2014 October 16, 2007|date=October 16, 2007|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=February 24, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/cybersunday/history/2007/matches/52676101/preview/|title=ECW Championship Match (Fans' choice)|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=November 2, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/archive/10162007/articles/matterofchoices|title=A matter of choice|first=Craig|last=Tello|date=October 19, 2007|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=November 2, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/archive/10232007/articles/punkrockthevote1|title=Punk rockin' the vote|first=Craig|last=Tello|date=October 23, 2007|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=November 2, 2007}}</ref> On the November 16, 2007, episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'', then-rivals Morrison and The Miz were paired together to face [[Matt Hardy]] and [[Montel Vontavious Porter|MVP]] in a match for the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Championship]], which they subsequently won after MVP [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turned]] on Hardy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/11162007/mainarticle|accessdate=August 9, 2008|date= November 16, 2007|last=DiFino|first=Lennie|title=Survival techniques|publisher=[[WWE]]}}</ref><ref name=\"wwetag1\"/> After winning the title, Morrison and The Miz brought the title to the [[ECW (WWE)|ECW]] [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]].

[[WWE]], currently performing on the [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] [[WWE brand extension|brand]] where they are the current [[WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship|SmackDown Tag Team Champions]] in their first reign.\n\nThe duo originally performed on [[ECW (WWE)|ECW]] brand, but also appeared on the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and SmackDown brands due to ECW's talent exchanges with those brands during their tenure as a team. The team had no official name, although they had been referred to as \"The In Crowd\" or \"The Dirt Sheet Duo\", after the name of their [[Slammy Award]]-winning online webshow, ''[[ECW (WWE)#Recurring segments|The Dirt Sheet]]''. Both were former ''[[WWE Tough Enough]]'' contestants, with Morrison winning the show's [[WWE Tough Enough#Tough Enough III|third season]] and Miz the runner-up of its [[WWE Tough Enough#$1,000,000 Tough Enough (season 4)|fourth season]].\n\nThey first began teaming together in November 2007. Originally rivals, John Morrison and The Miz became partners as a result of winning the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Championship]] and making the title exclusive to the ECW brand, for a brief time. They eventually [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Drop|dropped]] the title in July 2008. During their title reign, Morrison and Miz developed a gimmick that resulted in the duo being given their own webshow, ''The Dirt Sheet'', and their own in-ring interview segment of the same name on ECW. In December 2008, they won the Slammy Award in the category for Tag Team of the Year and won the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Championship]]. The team split in April 2009, after Miz was drafted to the Raw brand and Morrison was drafted to the SmackDown brand as part of the [[2009 WWE draft]].\n\nAfter the team disbanded, Morrison and Miz sporadically feuded with each other until Morrison's departure from WWE in November 2011. They reunited in January 2020 after Morrison returned to WWE. They won the [[SmackDown Tag Team Championship]] shortly thereafter, becoming only the second team (after [[The Hardy Boyz|The Hardys]]) to win WWE's original World Tag Team, the 2002 established WWE (now Raw) Tag Team, and SmackDown Tag Team Championships, making them overall three-time Tag Team Champions in WWE.\n\n==History==\n===Tag Team Championship reigns (2007\u20132009)===\n[[File:Morrison and Miz 2009.jpg|thumb|left|John Morrison (right) and The Miz (left)]]\nBefore they formed a partnership, [[John Morrison (wrestler)|John Morrison]] and [[The Miz]] were opponents, competing for the [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship|ECW Championship]] in October 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/ecw-wwe/071016.html|title=ECW on Sci-Fi Results&nbsp;\u2014 October 16, 2007|date=October 16, 2007|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=February 24, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/cybersunday/history/2007/matches/52676101/preview/|title=ECW Championship Match (Fans' choice)|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=November 2, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/archive/10162007/articles/matterofchoices|title=A matter of choice|first=Craig|last=Tello|date=October 19, 2007|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=November 2, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/archive/10232007/articles/punkrockthevote1|title=Punk rockin' the vote|first=Craig|last=Tello|date=October 23, 2007|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=November 2, 2007}}</ref> On the November 16, 2007, episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'', then-rivals Morrison and The Miz were paired together to face [[Matt Hardy]] and [[Montel Vontavious Porter|MVP]] in a match for the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Championship]], which they subsequently won after MVP [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turned]] on Hardy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/11162007/mainarticle|accessdate=August 9, 2008|date= November 16, 2007|last=DiFino|first=Lennie|title=Survival techniques|publisher=[[WWE]]}}</ref><ref name=\"wwetag1\"/> After winning the title, Morrison and The Miz brought the title to the [[ECW (WWE)|ECW]] [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]].

In 1965, the government converted the institution into an autonomous body and its administration was relegated to a board of governors with the Chief Secretary as its chairman. In 1967, the government again took control of the school. At that time, a new board of governors was constituted with the Education Secretary as its Chairman.<ref name=\"drmc_history\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.drmc-edu.com/history.php\n|title=History of Dhaka Residential Model College\n|website=DRMC\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623044719/http://www.drmc-edu.com/history.php\n|archive-date=June 23, 2010\n|access-date=June 15, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe initial purpose of establishing DRMC was to provide education for elite army officers in East Pakistan. The school, and later the college, were modeled after public schools in the [[United Kingdom]] (according to the British Public Schools Act 1868), particularly [[Eton College]]. The house system was designed to resemble Eton's. After the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|independence of Bangladesh]], a board of governors was appointed with the Education Secretary as its Chairman. Since its inception, the school has been funded through government grants and fees from students. The Board of Governors has been empowered to \u201cframe rules as it deems necessary for the proper functioning of the school\u201d.<ref name=\"drmc_history\"/>\n\nThe school began with only one study session, known as the ''Morning shift'' which operates from 8:00&nbsp;a.m. to 12:45&nbsp;p.m. In March 1993, another session known as the ''Day shift'' was added, according to the education expansion policy of the government, to cope with the growing number of students.<ref name=\"P_Alo\">{{cite news\n |author=Asif Ali\n |date=January 31, 2010\n |script-title=bn:\u09a2\u09be\u0995\u09be \u09b0\u09c7\u09b8\u09bf\u09a1\u09c7\u09a8\u09b8\u09bf\u09af\u09bc\u09be\u09b2 \u09ae\u09a1\u09c7\u09b2 \u0995\u09b2\u09c7\u099c: \u09ac\u09bf\u09b6\u09c3\u0999\u09cd\u0996\u09b2 \u09a8\u0997\u09b0\u09c7 \u09b8\u09c1\u09b6\u09c3\u0999\u09cd\u0996\u09b2 \u099c\u09c0\u09ac\u09a8\n |trans-title=Dhaka Residential Model College: Disciplined life in an undisciplined city\n |url=http://www.prothom-alo.com/detail/date/2010-01-31/news/38861\n |location=Dhaka\n |newspaper=[[Prothom Alo]]\n |language=bn\n |page=22\n |access-date=February 2, 2010\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112084537/http://www.prothom-alo.com/detail/date/2010-01-31/news/38861\n |archivedate=January 12, 2012\n}}</ref> The day shift session operates from 1:00&nbsp;p.m. to 5:45&nbsp;p.m. Measures were taken to build a gymnasium, park, swimming pool, auditorium, mosque, administrative building and residences for the principal, vice-principal and school staff.

Students have to sit for the [[Secondary School Certificate]] (SSC) examination at the end of the 10th grade, and the [[Higher Secondary (School) Certificate|Higher Secondary Certificate]] (HSC) at the end of the 12th grade. At the completion of the 5th grade, students have to sit for the Primary Education Completion Exam (PECE) examination program. Students at the end of the 8th grade have the option to sit for the Junior School Certificate (JSC). The school employs about 200 teaching staff and 80 non-teaching staff. The student-teacher ratio is 20:1. Teachers occasionally attend training programs organized by different government institutions. The school had more training workshops for its teachers than any other neighboring cluster of schools in 2000, under the English Language Teaching Improvement Project, which is funded by the [[British Government|British]] and Bangladeshi governments.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hunter |first=Tom |date=November 9, 2000 |title=Teacher power grows in Bangladesh |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2000/nov/09/tefl.bangladesh |work=The Guardian |access-date=October 15, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe school operates on two different schedules. Students can opt for either of the schedules right before their enrollment. Each schedule includes seven periods and a 30-minute break for lunch. Students are provided with snacks by the school. The school is a closed campus; students are not allowed to leave school grounds during school hours.\n\n===Admission===\nAlthough Dhaka Residential Model College operates from the 3rd through the 12th grade, it only admits students into the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 11th grades. As a result, the higher grades have fewer students than the lower grades, as a relatively large number of students transfer out. Admission in the 3rd and 9th grades are based on admission tests. The admission tests for DRMC are highly competitive.<ref name=\"admission\">{{cite news |date=July 18, 2004 |title=Colleges start distribution of admission forms |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2004/07/18/d40718060158.htm |work=The Daily Star |access-date=June 15, 2009}}</ref> Students in these grades are admitted through written and [[Test (assessment)|viva voce]] tests for both the morning and day shifts. Students who pass the written test have to qualify in the viva exam. In addition to written and viva tests, candidates have to go through a [[medical examination]] as well.\nAdmission to the 11th grade is determined by a student's [[grade point average]] (GPA) in the SSC examination. Many students with the highest grades in the SSC compete for admission as the school has limited enrollment in every grade.<ref>{{cite news |author= Sidiqur Rahman Khan |date=May 29, 2009 |title=Admission to Colleges: Tough competition for some, no students for others |url=http://www.newagebd.com/2009/may/29/front.html |work=New Age |accessdate=August 5, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628094354/http://www.newagebd.com/2009/may/29/front.html |archivedate=June 28, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Curriculum===\nDhaka Residential Model College's curriculum includes traditional primary, secondary and intermediate level academic subjects. Students of primary classes take academic core subjects including Bengali, English, mathematics, social science, general science, arts and crafts, religion and physical science. Students have to take agricultural science after completing their primary education. Students of the secondary level have to elect one of the three major programs: Arts and Humanities; Commerce; and Science. Students of the intermediate level (grades 11 and 12), have to elect one of the three major programs as well. Students have some compulsory subjects and some optional subjects in each of the programs.<ref name=\"DRMC_prospectus\"/>\n\n===Academic performance===\nThe SSC and HSC examinations are conducted by the Board of Secondary and Intermediate Education under the [[Ministry of Education (Bangladesh)|Ministry of Education]]. SSC is the diploma awarded for the completion of grades one to ten, which is equivalent to the [[O Levels]] in the UK. HSC is the [[high school diploma]] which is equivalent to the [[High-school diploma|high school diploma]] in the [[United States]] that is given after the completion of Grade 12, and the [[A Levels]] in the UK. The SSC examination consists of eleven subjects totaling 1,100 marks, with each subject given 100 marks, including practical tests for science subjects. A minimum of 33 marks are required to pass each subject. Subjects will depend on which major program a student has elected to study. These major programs are Sciences; Arts and Humanities; and Commerce. Students have to elect one of these three programs just before enrollment in the 9th grade for SSC, and again in the 11th grade for HSC. The HSC examination consists of six subjects totaling 1,200 marks, with each subject providing 200 marks, including practical tests for science subjects. The minimum number of marks required to pass each subject is 66. Results of both the exams are published in the form of a GPA. The highest score is GPA-5.

It has laboratories for physics, chemistry, computers, biology, mathematics and geography and a library with more than 20,000 books, journals, newspapers and magazines. The [[Year#Academic year|academic year]] is divided into two [[academic term|terms]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drmc-edu.com/teaching_method.php |title=Teaching System |website=DRMc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807143725/http://www.drmc-edu.com/teaching_method.php |archive-date=August 7, 2010 |access-date= March 20, 2010}}</ref> In addition to a terminal exam, three class tests are held each term. Students have to sit for the [[Secondary School Certificate]] (SSC) examination at the end of the 10th grade, and the [[Higher Secondary (School) Certificate|Higher Secondary Certificate]] (HSC) at the end of the 12th grade. At the completion of the 5th grade, students have to sit for the Primary Education Completion Exam (PECE) examination program. Students at the end of the 8th grade have the option to sit for the Junior School Certificate (JSC). The school employs about 200 teaching staff and 80 non-teaching staff. The student-teacher ratio is 20:1. Teachers occasionally attend training programs organized by different government institutions. The school had more training workshops for its teachers than any other neighboring cluster of schools in 2000, under the English Language Teaching Improvement Project, which is funded by the [[British Government|British]] and Bangladeshi governments.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hunter |first=Tom |date=November 9, 2000 |title=Teacher power grows in Bangladesh |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2000/nov/09/tefl.bangladesh |work=The Guardian |access-date=October 15, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe school operates on two different schedules. Students can opt for either of the schedules right before their enrollment. Each schedule includes seven periods and a 30-minute break for lunch. Students are provided with snacks by the school. The school is a closed campus; students are not allowed to leave school grounds during school hours.\n\n===Admission===\nAlthough Dhaka Residential Model College operates from the 3rd through the 12th grade, it only admits students into the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 11th grades. Consequently, the higher grades have fewer students than the lower grades, as a relatively large number of students transfer out. Admission in the 3rd and 9th grades are based on admission tests. The admission tests for DRMC are highly competitive.<ref name=\"admission\">{{cite news |date=July 18, 2004 |title=Colleges start distribution of admission forms |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2004/07/18/d40718060158.htm |work=The Daily Star |access-date=June 15, 2009}}</ref> Students in these grades are admitted through written and [[Test (assessment)|viva voce]] tests for both the morning and day shifts. Students who pass the written test have to qualify in the viva exam. In addition to written and viva tests, candidates have to go through a [[medical examination]] as well.\nAdmission to the 11th grade is determined by a student's [[grade point average]] (GPA) in the SSC examination. Many students with the highest grades in the SSC compete for admission as the school has limited enrollment in every grade.<ref>{{cite news |author= Sidiqur Rahman Khan |date=May 29, 2009 |title=Admission to Colleges: Tough competition for some, no students for others |url=http://www.newagebd.com/2009/may/29/front.html |work=New Age |accessdate=August 5, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628094354/http://www.newagebd.com/2009/may/29/front.html |archivedate=June 28, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Curriculum===\nDhaka Residential Model College's curriculum includes traditional primary, secondary and intermediate level academic subjects. Students of primary classes take academic core subjects including Bengali, English, mathematics, social science, general science, arts and crafts, religion and physical science. Students have to take agricultural science after completing their primary education. Students of the secondary level have to elect one of the three major programs: Arts and Humanities; Commerce; and Science. Students of the intermediate level (grades 11 and 12), have to elect one of the three major programs as well. Students have some compulsory subjects and some optional subjects in each of the programs.<ref name=\"DRMC_prospectus\"/>\n\n===Academic performance===\nThe SSC and HSC examinations are conducted by the Board of Secondary and Intermediate Education under the [[Ministry of Education (Bangladesh)|Ministry of Education]]. SSC is the diploma awarded for the completion of grades one to ten, which is equivalent to the [[O Levels]] in the UK. HSC is the [[high school diploma]] which is equivalent to the [[High-school diploma|high school diploma]] in the [[United States]] that is given after the completion of Grade 12, and the [[A Levels]] in the UK. The SSC examination consists of eleven subjects totaling 1,100 marks, with each subject given 100 marks, including practical tests for science subjects. A minimum of 33 marks are required to pass each subject. Subjects will depend on which major program a student has elected to study. These major programs are Sciences; Arts and Humanities; and Commerce. Students have to elect one of these three programs just before enrollment in the 9th grade for SSC, and again in the 11th grade for HSC. The HSC examination consists of six subjects totaling 1,200 marks, with each subject providing 200 marks, including practical tests for science subjects. The minimum number of marks required to pass each subject is 66. Results of both the exams are published in the form of a GPA. The highest score is GPA-5. The [[Dhaka Education Board]] annually ranks schools and colleges from across the country in terms of GPA-5 scorers.<ref name=\"DRMC_prospectus\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dhakaeducationboard.gov.bd/ |title=Education Board Bangladesh |publisher=Intermediate and Secondary Education Boards |accessdate= March 16, 2010}}</ref>\n\nDRMC has generally remained among the top ranked schools and colleges of Bangladesh since its inception.<ref name=\"performance_1\">{{cite news\n|url=http://nation.ittefaq.com/issues/2009/05/30/news0603.htm\n|title=6 thousand city students unlikely to get admission\n|date=May 30, 2009\n|author=Md Jamal Uddin\n|work=The New Nation\n|accessdate=December 2, 2009}}</ref> The Ministry of Education awarded the institution in 2008 for brilliant performance in the HSC examination.<ref name=\"poll\">{{cite news\n | date=November 5, 2008\n | title=Govt to make polls acceptable to all parties\n | url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/story.php?nid=61954\n | work=[[Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]]\n | access-date=August 5, 2009\n | quote=The seven institutes awarded at the event are the Notre Dame College, Rajuk Uttara Model College, Dhaka Residential Model College...}}</ref>\n\nDhaka Residential Model College's results from 2005 to 2019 for the Secondary School Certificate level examinations are as follows:\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
