The chorus of the song is also grouped in bars of 3 rather than the regular bars of 4. Somewhat unusually, the song intro starts in 8/4 time for 4 bars, then switches to 7/4 for 8 bars and then 6 bars of 8/4 again before leading into the first verse, which is also in 8/4. It is set at 145 BPM.\n\nAfter the album version ended its run on the charts, a solo acoustic version of the song performed by Grohl was released and had some success on pop and adult contemporary radio but generally it enjoyed great success on rock and alternative radio just like the original electric version.\n\n==Music videos==\nTwo music videos were made for the studio version of the song and a third music video was made for an acoustic version of the song. All 3 versions were made available via the DVD release \"Low/Times Like These\"(2003):\n\n===Version 1===\nDirected by [[Liam Lynch (musician)|Liam Lynch]]. The band is shown performing the song against changing backgrounds, consisting mainly of brightly colored [[Kaleidoscope|kaleidoscopic]] forms similar to those found in [[music visualization]], giving the video a psychedelic, hopeful, joyful mood. In the end, the backgrounds blink out to reveal that the band are performing against a [[Chroma key|greenscreen]] in a studio. This version is often referred to as the \"UK version\" and received little airplay in the US as the band ultimately opted to film another video shortly afterwards.\n\n===Version 2===\nDirected by [[Marc Klasfeld]]. The video was shot on the Mojave River Bridge in [[Victorville, CA]] and shows the band performing the song on location, below and in front of a bridge. A girl wanders onto the bridge and eventually tosses her [[Game Boy Advance]] at them. Gradually, more and more people arrive at the bridge and start throwing other inanimate objects (including appliances, instruments, and furniture) behind and around the oblivious band members. The items never hit any of them, though they come close. The actions of the participants would suggest that their motivations and intentions are to cast off the material trappings of society which prohibit them from living freely.\n\nTwo cars are then simultaneously dropped off the bridge and behind the band, resulting in clouds of smoke and fire. This is followed by an entire house (only with walls and roof) being dropped onto the band by a crane, and the walls falling onto the ground without anyone getting hurt. A continuity error occurs at the end: when the house falls apart, the roof is missing.\n\nSome of the extras featured in the video were fans selected through the band's official web site.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foofighters.com/news/index.php?month=01&year=2003 |title=Official FooFighters.com news headline, \"Wanna be in a Foo video?\" (bottom of page) |accessdate=2017-09-14 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031017120236/http://www.foofighters.com/news/index.php?month=01&year=2003 |archivedate=October 17, 2003 }}</ref>\n\nThis version has been banned from airplay, for unknown reasons.\n\n===Acoustic version===\nA music video was produced for the acoustic version. It consists solely of clips of Grohl recording the song's vocal, guitar, and piano tracks in the studio.

The Foo Fighters later managed to perform the song at Glastonbury in 2017, opening their set and dedicating it to Florence Welch.\n\n==In media==\nThe acoustic version of this song was used in episode 20 of season 4 (\u201cThe Birth and Death of the Day\u201d) of ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' during the graduation scene, which is also when Haley's water breaks.\n\nThis is also used as the theme song for a video montage showing memorable past goals at [[Turf Moor]] for all of [[Burnley FC]]'s home games from 2009 to the present.\n\nIt was used by [[George W. Bush]] for his 2004 re-election campaign without the band's knowledge. \"That was weird,\" Grohl remarked. \"And to me it just seemed like a pretty good example of how completely out of touch he was. You read those lyrics: they're about hope and love and compassion. And look at his [[Presidency of George W. Bush|administration]]: [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|war]] and fear and death.

The chorus of the song is also grouped in bars of 3 rather than the regular bars of 4. Somewhat unusually, the song intro starts in 8/4 time for 4 bars, then switches to 7/4 for 8 bars and then 6 bars of 8/4 again before leading into the first verse, which is also in 8/4. It is set at 145 BPM.\n\nAfter the album version ended its run on the charts, a solo acoustic version of the song performed by Grohl was released and had some success on pop and adult contemporary radio but generally it enjoyed great success on rock and alternative radio just like the original electric version.\n\n==Music videos==\nTwo music videos were made for the studio version of the song and a third music video was made for an acoustic version of the song. All 3 versions were made available via the DVD release \"Low/Times Like These\"(2003):\n\n===Version 1===\nDirected by [[Liam Lynch (musician)|Liam Lynch]]. The band is shown performing the song against changing backgrounds, consisting mainly of brightly colored [[Kaleidoscope|kaleidoscopic]] forms similar to those found in [[music visualization]], giving the video a psychedelic, hopeful, joyful mood. In the end, the backgrounds blink out to reveal that the band are performing against a [[Chroma key|greenscreen]] in a studio. This version is often referred to as the \"UK version\" and received little airplay in the US as the band ultimately opted to film another video shortly afterwards.\n\n===Version 2===\nDirected by [[Marc Klasfeld]]. The video was shot on the Mojave River Bridge in [[Victorville, CA]] and shows the band performing the song on location, below and in front of a bridge. A girl wanders onto the bridge and eventually tosses her [[Game Boy Advance]] at them. Gradually, more and more people arrive at the bridge and start throwing other inanimate objects (including appliances, instruments, and furniture) behind and around the oblivious band members. The items never hit any of them, though they come close. The actions of the participants would suggest that their motivations and intentions are to cast off the material trappings of society which prohibit them from living freely.\n\nTwo cars are then simultaneously dropped off the bridge and behind the band, resulting in clouds of smoke and fire. This is followed by an entire house (only with walls and roof) being dropped onto the band by a crane, and the walls falling onto the ground without anyone getting hurt. A continuity error occurs at the end: when the house falls apart, the roof is missing.\n\nSome of the extras featured in the video were fans selected through the band's official web site.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foofighters.com/news/index.php?month=01&year=2003 |title=Official FooFighters.com news headline, \"Wanna be in a Foo video?\" (bottom of page) |accessdate=2017-09-14 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031017120236/http://www.foofighters.com/news/index.php?month=01&year=2003 |archivedate=October 17, 2003 }}</ref>\n\nThis version has been banned from airplay, for unknown reasons.\n\n===Acoustic version===\nA music video was produced for the acoustic version. It consists solely of clips of Grohl recording the song's vocal, guitar, and piano tracks in the studio.

It features a percussive and idiosyncratic sound, lyrically exploring freedom from oppression and Apple's relationships with women.\n\nThe album was released during the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic]], and many critics found its exploration of confinement pertinent. It received universal critical acclaim, and is currently the highest-rated album of all time on review aggregator [[Metacritic]].\n\n==Background and recording==\nIn 2012, Apple began conceptualizing a new album, considering a [[concept album]] based on her home in [[Venice Beach]] or the [[Pando (tree)|Pando]] in Utah.\n\nIn February 2015, she began rehearsals for the album with band members [[Sebastian Steinberg]], Amy Aileen Wood and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]].<ref name=\"VultureProfile\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters.html|title=Allow Fiona Apple to Reintroduce Herself|last=Handler|first=Rachel|date=April 17, 2020|website=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|access-date=April 18, 2020}}</ref> They began writing and rehearsing in Apple's [[Venice Beach]] home studio, using home-made percussive objects and chanting as they marched around the house.<ref name=\"newyorker\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity|title=Fiona Apple's Art of Radical Sensitivity|last=Nussbaum|first=Emily|author-link=Emily Nussbaum|website=[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]|date=March 16, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn July, they began recording the album, spending three weeks at the [[Sonic Ranch]] studio in rural Texas, with little success.

Apple's dog Mercy appears on the album, as well as [[Cara Delevigne]]'s Leo and Alfie, and Zelda Hallman's Maddie.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\nOn the album, Apple approached her voice as a musical instrument, commenting: \"I have fun with my voice, but I\u2019m not trying to make it pretty all the time. I\u2019m not trying to convince anybody I\u2019m a singer.

Hi, hi, hi, hi.'\"<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\nThe title, ''Fetch the Bolt Cutters'', is a quote from the British-Irish crime drama television series ''[[The Fall (TV series)|The Fall]]'', where the protagonist, a sex-crimes investigator portrayed by [[Gillian Anderson]], recites the phrase while investigating a crime scene where a woman was tortured.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| AOTY = 95/100<ref name=\"aoty\">{{cite web |title=Fiona Apple - Fetch the Bolt Cutters - Reviews |url=https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/224348-fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters.php |publisher=Album of The Year |accessdate=April 23, 2020}}</ref>\n| ADM = 9.2/10<ref name=\"adm\">{{cite web |title=Fetch The Bolt Cutters by Fiona Apple reviews|url=http://www.anydecentmusic.com/review/11368/Fiona-Apple-Fetch-The-Bolt-Cutters.aspx |publisher=[[AnyDecentMusic?]] |accessdate=April 22, 2020}}</ref>\n| MC = 100/100<ref name=\"MC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/fetch-the-bolt-cutters/fiona-apple|title=Fetch the Bolt Cutters by Fiona Apple Reviews and Tracks|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=April 23, 2020}}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''[[The A.V.

It was released on April 17, 2020, Apple's first release since ''[[The Idler Wheel...]]'' in 2012.\n\nApple began recording the album in 2015, producing and performing it alongside Amy Aileen Wood, [[Sebastian Steinberg]] and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]]. It features a percussive and idiosyncratic sound, lyrically exploring freedom from oppression and Apple's relationships with women.\n\nThe album was released during the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic]], and many critics found its exploration of confinement pertinent. It received universal critical acclaim, and is currently the highest-rated album of all time on review aggregator [[Metacritic]].\n\n==Background and recording==\nIn 2012, Apple began conceptualizing a new album, considering a [[concept album]] based on her home in [[Venice Beach]] or the [[Pando (tree)|Pando]] in Utah.\n\nIn February 2015, she began rehearsals for the album with band members [[Sebastian Steinberg]], Amy Aileen Wood and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]].<ref name=\"VultureProfile\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters.html|title=Allow Fiona Apple to Reintroduce Herself|last=Handler|first=Rachel|date=April 17, 2020|website=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|access-date=April 18, 2020}}</ref> They began writing and rehearsing in Apple's [[Venice Beach]] home studio, using home-made percussive objects and chanting as they marched around the house.<ref name=\"newyorker\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity|title=Fiona Apple's Art of Radical Sensitivity|last=Nussbaum|first=Emily|author-link=Emily Nussbaum|website=[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]|date=March 16, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn July, they began recording the album, spending three weeks at the [[Sonic Ranch]] studio in rural Texas, with little success. A few months later, after returning to Venice Beach, they began making progress, with Apple recording long takes consisting of instruments being hit against surfaces and objects. Apple's vocals were unedited, and the album developed a highly percussive sound.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/><ref name=\"newyorker\"/> As well as Apple's home, recording sessions took place at Stanley Recordings and at engineer [[Dave Way]]'s private studio, Waystation.<ref name=\"Credits\"/>\n\nBy July 2019, Apple had begun mixing the album. In September, the process began to slow down, with Apple developing doubts about the album.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> At this time, the artist first mentioned work on her new project in an interview with ''[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]'', explaining that she was still working hard on her next album which should have been released \"a million years ago\" and was hoping to put it out in 2020. She also admitted to being reclusive due to ongoing recording sessions at her Venice Beach house.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/fiona-apple-is-still-calling-bullshit.html|title=Fiona Apple Is Still Calling Bullshit|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]|date=September 25, 2019|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2020, she played the mixes to her band members, whose positive response brought Apple back on track.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> In an interview that month, she said that the album process was in its final stages, with the only things left being \"artwork and stuff\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-soon/|title=Fiona Apple says new album will \"be done soon\"|last=Bacior|first=Robin|website=Consequence of Sound|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-updates.html|title=15 Minutes With Fiona Apple|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=Vulture|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> On March 9, 2020, she revealed that she had finished recording.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/fiona-apple-reveals-her-new-album-is-finished-2622233|title=Fiona Apple reveals her new album is finished|last=Langford|first=Jackson|website=[[NME]]|date=March 9, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n===Musical style===\nThe album's sound is defined by percussion.

Apple's dog Mercy appears on the album, as well as [[Cara Delevigne]]'s Leo and Alfie, and Zelda Hallman's Maddie.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\nOn the album, Apple approached her voice as a musical instrument, commenting: \"I have fun with my voice, but I\u2019m not trying to make it pretty all the time. I\u2019m not trying to convince anybody I\u2019m a singer.

Twelve teams played 78 games each. The league was officially incorporated in June of [[1971 in sports|1971]] by [[Garry L. Davidson]] and [[Dennis A. Murphy]] and promised to ice twelve teams in various markets around [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. The league championship trophy, the [[Avco World Trophy]], was donated by [[AVCO Financial Services Corporation]] along with $500,000. The [[New England Whalers]] won the first Avco World Trophy.\n\n==1972 General Player Draft==\n{{Main|WHA General Player Draft}}\nThe WHA's inaugural player draft was held in [[Anaheim, California]] on February 12 and 13, 1972. All 12 WHA franchises took part in the draft. There were no drafting constraints, and the WHA teams selected players from all levels of play, including established [[National Hockey League]] players, minor leaguers, college, junior players, Europeans, and even retired players.<ref>{{cite book |last=Surgent |first=Scott Adam|title=The Complete Historical and Statistical Reference to the World Hockey Association 1972-1979 |year=1999 |publisher=Xaler Press |location=Tempe, Arizona |isbn=0964477408 |pages=447\u201351}}</ref> The first player selected in the general draft was [[United States men's national ice hockey team]] member [[Henry Boucha]], taken by the [[Minnesota Fighting Saints]] (who also selected the [[Governor of Minnesota]], [[Wendell Anderson]], with a late pick). After 70 rounds the [[Winnipeg Jets (1972\u201396)|Winnipeg Jets]] selected Soviet premier [[Alexei Kosygin]] and then stop participating in the draft, while the other teams continued making selections. This process continued, with teams arbitrarily dropping out from the draft, while others kept going, until attrition finally ended the process.  The final two teams participating in this draft were the [[Dayton Aeros]] and the [[Los Angeles Sharks]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Willes |first=Ed |title=The Rebel League: The Short and Unruly Life of the World Hockey Association |year=2004 |publisher=McClelland & Stewart Ltd. |location=Toronto, Ontario |isbn=0771089473 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/rebelleagueshort0000will/page/23 23\u20134] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/rebelleagueshort0000will/page/23 }}</ref> In all, just under 1100 selections were made by the 12 teams, who could now focus their efforts on signing players for the first season of play.\n\n==Regular season summary==\nThe first WHA games, on October 11, 1972, were won by the [[Alberta Oilers]] 7-4 over the [[Ottawa Nationals]] and the [[Cleveland Crusaders]] 2-0 over the [[Quebec Nordiques]].<ref>http://basketball.ballparks.com/NBA/ClevelandCavaliers/oldindex.htm</ref><ref>http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/team_results.php?tid=000244&sid=1973</ref>\n\nThe WHA was split into two divisions, the Eastern Division and the Western Division. Each division sported six teams. The New England Whalers led the Eastern Division and had the best record in the league. The other playoff qualifiers in the East were Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Ottawa. The [[Winnipeg Jets (1972\u201396)|Winnipeg Jets]] led the Western Division and had the second best record in the league. Behind Winnipeg, the West had a thrilling race with four teams fighting for three playoff spots, trading second through fifth place all season. Houston won three of its last four games to finish second with 82 points. With two games remaining, Minnesota had 79 points, Alberta had 77, and Los Angeles had 76. Los Angeles won their last two games to finish third, while Minnesota and Alberta both lost their next to last game of the season, setting up a final game showdown in Minnesota against each other with Minnesota two points ahead of Alberta. Alberta won the game 5-3, so both teams finished with identical records.  The league now faced a dilemma. The first standings tiebreaker was number of wins, and the teams both had 38. The second tiebreaker was head to head record and the teams split their eight games with four wins apiece. The league by-laws did not specify further tiebreakers. In the NHL, the next two tie breakers were goal differential and goals scored, both of which favored Alberta. But because the WHA by-laws did not specify additional tiebreakers, the league Board of Governors met to decide how to break the tie. They ultimately decided on a 1-game playoff at a neutral site.  The [[Alberta Oilers]] missed the playoffs, despite having a superior goal-differential to the [[Minnesota Fighting Saints]], because they lost the neutral-site, tie-breaking game against the Saints in [[Calgary]] by a score of 4-2.\n\n===Final standings===\n''GP = Games Played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against, PIM = Penalties in minutes''\n<br>\n''Teams that qualifies for the playoffs are highlighted in '''bold'''''\n{{1972\u201373 WHA Eastern Division standings}}\n{{1972\u201373 WHA Western Division standings}}\n\n==Player stats==\n\n===Scoring leaders===\n<sub>'''Bolded numbers''' indicate season leaders</sub>\n\n<!-- IMPORTANT: Rank players by GAA (lower), then SV%, then W, then GP -->\n''GP = Games played; G = Goals; A = Assists; Pts = Points; PIM = Penalty minutes''\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"18%\" | Player\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"14%\" | Team\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | GP\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | G\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | A\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | Pts\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | PIM\n|- \n|- \n| align=\"left\" | [[Andr\u00e9 Lacroix (ice hockey)|Andre Lacroix]]|| [[Philadelphia Blazers]]  || 78 || 50 || '''74''' || '''124''' || 83\n|- \n| align=\"left\" | [[Ron Ward]] || [[New York Golden Blades|New York Raiders]]|| 77 || 51 || 67 || 118 || 28\n|- \n| align=\"left\" | [[Danny Lawson]] || [[Philadelphia Blazers]]  || 78 || '''61''' || 45 || 106 || 35\n|- \n| align=\"left\" | [[Tom Webster (ice hockey)|Tom Webster]] || [[Hartford Whalers|New England Whalers]] || 77 || 53 || 50 || 103 || 89\n|- \n| align=\"left\" | [[Bobby Hull]] || [[Winnipeg Jets (1972\u201396)|Winnipeg Jets]] || 63 || 51 || 52 || 103 || 37\n|- \n| align=\"left\" | [[Norm Beaudin]] || [[Winnipeg Jets (1972\u201396)|Winnipeg Jets]] || 78 || 38 || 65 || 103 || 15\n|- \n| align=\"left\" | [[Chris Bordeleau]] || [[Winnipeg Jets (1972\u201396)|Winnipeg Jets]]|| 78 || 47 || 54 || 101 || 12\n|- \n| align=\"left\" | [[Terry Caffery]] || [[Hartford Whalers|New England Whalers]] || 74 || 39 || 61 || 100 || 14\n|- \n| align=\"left\" | [[Gord Labossiere]] || [[Houston Aeros (WHA)|Houston Aeros]] || 77 || 36 || 60 || 96 || 56\n|- \n| align=\"left\" | [[Wayne Carleton]] || [[Ottawa Nationals]] || 75 || 42 || 49 || 91 || 42\n|}\n\n=== Leading goaltenders ===\n<sub>'''Bolded numbers''' indicate season leaders</sub>\n\n<!-- IMPORTANT: Rank players by GAA (lower), then SV%, then W, then GP -->\n''GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties, GA = Goals against; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = [[Save percentage]]; GAA = [[Goals against average]]''\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"100%\"\n! bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" width=\"20%\" align=\"left\" | Spieler\n! bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" width=\"15%\" | Team\n! bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" width=\"8.1%\" | GP\n! bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" width=\"8.1%\" | Min\n! bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" width=\"8.1%\" | W\n! bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" width=\"8.1%\" | L\n! bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" width=\"8.1%\" | T\n! bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" width=\"8.1%\" | GA\n! bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" width=\"8.1%\" | SO\n! bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" width=\"8.1%\" | SV%\n! bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" width=\"8.1%\" | GAA\n|- \n| align=\"left\" | [[Gerry Cheevers]] || [[Cleveland Crusaders]] || 52 || 3144 || 32 || 20 || 2 || 149 || '''5''' || '''91.2''' || '''2.84'''\n|- \n| align=\"left\" | [[Joe Daley (ice hockey)|Joe Daley]] || [[Winnipeg Jets (1972\u201396)|Winnipeg Jets]] || 29 || 1718 || 17 || 10 || 1 || 83 || 2 || 89.3 || 2.90\n|- \n| align=\"left\" | [[Russ Gillow]] || [[Los Angeles Sharks]] || 38 || 1892 || 17 || 13 || 2 || 96 || 2 || 88.7 || 2.91\n|- \n| align=\"left\" | [[Wayne Rutledge]] || [[Houston Aeros (WHA)|Houston Aeros]] || 36 || 2163 || 20 || 14 || 2 || 110 || 0 || 90.7 || 3.05\n|- \n| align=\"left\" | [[Jack Norris (ice hockey)|Jack Norris]] || [[Alberta Oilers]] || '''64''' || '''3702''' || 28 || '''37''' || 3 || 189 || 1 || 90.2 || 3.06\n|}\n\n==All-star game==\n{{Main|1972\u201373 WHA All-Star Game}}\nThe WHA held its first all-star game on January 6, 1973, in [[Quebec City]].

The Sharks then won a thrilling game three in L.A. 3-2. Game 4 was the turning point of the series. The teams headed into overtime tied at 2; a Houston goal would even the series while a Los Angeles goal would give the Sharks a commanding 3-1 series lead. The Aeros scored in overtime to even the series, then won game 5 in Houston, 6-3.

Twelve teams played 78 games each. The league was officially incorporated in June of [[1971 in sports|1971]] by [[Garry L. Davidson]] and [[Dennis A. Murphy]] and promised to ice twelve teams in various markets around [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. The league championship trophy, the [[Avco World Trophy]], was donated by [[AVCO Financial Services Corporation]] along with $500,000. The [[New England Whalers]] won the first Avco World Trophy.\n\n==1972 General Player Draft==\n{{Main|WHA General Player Draft}}\nThe WHA's inaugural player draft was held in [[Anaheim, California]] on February 12 and 13, 1972. All 12 WHA franchises took part in the draft. There were no drafting constraints, and the WHA teams selected players from all levels of play, including established [[National Hockey League]] players, minor leaguers, college, junior players, Europeans, and even retired players.<ref>{{cite book |last=Surgent |first=Scott Adam|title=The Complete Historical and Statistical Reference to the World Hockey Association 1972-1979 |year=1999 |publisher=Xaler Press |location=Tempe, Arizona |isbn=0964477408 |pages=447\u201351}}</ref> The first player selected in the general draft was [[United States men's national ice hockey team]] member [[Henry Boucha]], taken by the [[Minnesota Fighting Saints]] (who also selected the [[Governor of Minnesota]], [[Wendell Anderson]], with a late pick). After 70 rounds the [[Winnipeg Jets (1972\u201396)|Winnipeg Jets]] selected Soviet premier [[Alexei Kosygin]] and then stop participating in the draft, while the other teams continued making selections. This process continued, with teams arbitrarily dropping out from the draft, while others kept going, until attrition finally ended the process.  The final two teams participating in this draft were the [[Dayton Aeros]] and the [[Los Angeles Sharks]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Willes |first=Ed |title=The Rebel League: The Short and Unruly Life of the World Hockey Association |year=2004 |publisher=McClelland & Stewart Ltd. |location=Toronto, Ontario |isbn=0771089473 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/rebelleagueshort0000will/page/23 23\u20134] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/rebelleagueshort0000will/page/23 }}</ref> In all, just under 1100 selections were made by the 12 teams, who could now focus their efforts on signing players for the first season of play.\n\n==Regular season summary==\nThe first WHA games, on October 11, 1972, were won by the [[Alberta Oilers]] 7-4 over the [[Ottawa Nationals]] and the [[Cleveland Crusaders]] 2-0 over the [[Quebec Nordiques]].<ref>http://basketball.ballparks.com/NBA/ClevelandCavaliers/oldindex.htm</ref><ref>http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/team_results.php?tid=000244&sid=1973</ref>\n\nThe WHA was split into two divisions, the Eastern Division and the Western Division. Each division sported six teams. The New England Whalers led the Eastern Division and had the best record in the league. The other playoff qualifiers in the East were Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Ottawa. The [[Winnipeg Jets (1972\u201396)|Winnipeg Jets]] led the Western Division and had the second best record in the league. Behind Winnipeg, the West had a thrilling race with four teams fighting for three playoff spots, trading second through fifth place all season. Houston won three of its last four games to finish second with 82 points. With two games remaining, Minnesota had 79 points, Alberta had 77, and Los Angeles had 76. Los Angeles won their last two games to finish third, while Minnesota and Alberta both lost their next to last game of the season, setting up a final game showdown in Minnesota against each other with Minnesota two points ahead of Alberta. Alberta won the game 5-3, so both teams finished with identical records.  The league now faced a dilemma. The first standings tiebreaker was number of wins, and the teams both had 38. The second tiebreaker was head to head record and the teams split their eight games with four wins apiece. The league by-laws did not specify further tiebreakers. In the NHL, the next two tie breakers were goal differential and goals scored, both of which favored Alberta. But because the WHA by-laws did not specify additional tiebreakers, the league Board of Governors met to decide how to break the tie. They ultimately decided on a 1-game playoff at a neutral site.  The [[Alberta Oilers]] missed the playoffs, despite having a superior goal-differential to the [[Minnesota Fighting Saints]], because they lost the neutral-site, tie-breaking game against the Saints in [[Calgary]] by a score of 4-2.\n\n===Final standings===\n''GP = Games Played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against, PIM = Penalties in minutes''\n<br>\n''Teams that qualifies for the playoffs are highlighted in '''bold'''''\n{{1972\u201373 WHA Eastern Division standings}}\n{{1972\u201373 WHA Western Division standings}}\n\n==Player stats==\n\n===Scoring leaders===\n<sub>'''Bolded numbers''' indicate season leaders</sub>\n\n<!-- IMPORTANT: Rank players by GAA (lower), then SV%, then W, then GP -->\n''GP = Games played; G = Goals; A = Assists; Pts = Points; PIM = Penalty minutes''\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"18%\" | Player\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"14%\" | Team\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | GP\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | G\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | A\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | Pts\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | PIM\n|- \n|- \n| align=\"left\" | [[Andr\u00e9 Lacroix (ice hockey)|Andre Lacroix]]|| [[Philadelphia Blazers]]  || 78 || 50 || '''74''' || '''124''' || 83\n|- \n| align=\"left\" | [[Ron Ward]] || [[New York Golden Blades|New York Raiders]]|| 77 || 51 || 67 || 118 || 28\n|- \n| align=\"left\" | [[Danny Lawson]] || [[Philadelphia Blazers]]  || 78 || '''61''' || 45 || 106 || 35\n|- \n| align=\"left\" | [[Tom Webster (ice hockey)|Tom Webster]] || [[Hartford Whalers|New England Whalers]] || 77 || 53 || 50 || 103 || 89\n|- \n| align=\"left\" | [[Bobby Hull]] || [[Winnipeg Jets (1972\u201396)|Winnipeg Jets]] || 63 || 51 || 52 || 103 || 37\n|- \n| align=\"left\" | [[Norm Beaudin]] || [[Winnipeg Jets (1972\u201396)|Winnipeg Jets]] || 78 || 38 || 65 || 103 || 15\n|- \n| align=\"left\" | [[Chris Bordeleau]] || [[Winnipeg Jets (1972\u201396)|Winnipeg Jets]]|| 78 || 47 || 54 || 101 || 12\n|- \n| align=\"left\" | [[Terry Caffery]] || [[Hartford Whalers|New England Whalers]] || 74 || 39 || 61 || 100 || 14\n|- \n| align=\"left\" | [[Gord Labossiere]] || [[Houston Aeros (WHA)|Houston Aeros]] || 77 || 36 || 60 || 96 || 56\n|- \n| align=\"left\" | [[Wayne Carleton]] || [[Ottawa Nationals]] || 75 || 42 || 49 || 91 || 42\n|}\n\n=== Leading goaltenders ===\n<sub>'''Bolded numbers''' indicate season leaders</sub>\n\n<!-- IMPORTANT: Rank players by GAA (lower), then SV%, then W, then GP -->\n''GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties, GA = Goals against; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = [[Save percentage]]; GAA = [[Goals against average]]''\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"100%\"\n! bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" width=\"20%\" align=\"left\" | Spieler\n! bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" width=\"15%\" | Team\n! bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" width=\"8.1%\" | GP\n! bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" width=\"8.1%\" | Min\n! bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" width=\"8.1%\" | W\n! bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" width=\"8.1%\" | L\n! bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" width=\"8.1%\" | T\n! bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" width=\"8.1%\" | GA\n! bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" width=\"8.1%\" | SO\n! bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" width=\"8.1%\" | SV%\n! bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" width=\"8.1%\" | GAA\n|- \n| align=\"left\" | [[Gerry Cheevers]] || [[Cleveland Crusaders]] || 52 || 3144 || 32 || 20 || 2 || 149 || '''5''' || '''91.2''' || '''2.84'''\n|- \n| align=\"left\" | [[Joe Daley (ice hockey)|Joe Daley]] || [[Winnipeg Jets (1972\u201396)|Winnipeg Jets]] || 29 || 1718 || 17 || 10 || 1 || 83 || 2 || 89.3 || 2.90\n|- \n| align=\"left\" | [[Russ Gillow]] || [[Los Angeles Sharks]] || 38 || 1892 || 17 || 13 || 2 || 96 || 2 || 88.7 || 2.91\n|- \n| align=\"left\" | [[Wayne Rutledge]] || [[Houston Aeros (WHA)|Houston Aeros]] || 36 || 2163 || 20 || 14 || 2 || 110 || 0 || 90.7 || 3.05\n|- \n| align=\"left\" | [[Jack Norris (ice hockey)|Jack Norris]] || [[Alberta Oilers]] || '''64''' || '''3702''' || 28 || '''37''' || 3 || 189 || 1 || 90.2 || 3.06\n|}\n\n==All-star game==\n{{Main|1972\u201373 WHA All-Star Game}}\nThe WHA held its first all-star game on January 6, 1973, in [[Quebec City]].

The Sharks then won a thrilling game three in L.A. 3-2. Game 4 was the turning point of the series. The teams headed into overtime tied at 2; a Houston goal would even the series while a Los Angeles goal would give the Sharks a commanding 3-1 series lead. The Aeros scored in overtime to even the series, then won game 5 in Houston, 6-3.

Jack and Annie discover that their neighbor, Mrs. Martin, has died and steal her chili recipe with the help of Jing; having won the past ten years. Mia finds the holiday offensive as it involves burning a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 witch in celebration of Oak Dale's terrible historic past. Duncan at first pays no mind, but when he is elected the new town virgin for the holiday (the previous virgin got pregnant), he and his friends decide to steal the witch. Bex, who was a distraction, lets slip that Duncan and his friends are the culprits and drag them back for the burning. Duncan threatens everyone by reading their darkest secrets, which were to be burned with the witch, and everyone lays off. Mia admits that she likes the festivities, but that everyone should be more aware of the history. Annie, having realized what she is doing to her son, apologizes for putting his name up as a virgin and she and Jack win the chili cook off. Kimberly awaits for a boy that she likes, but accidentally scares him away.\n| LineColor       = #F7D90A\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 5\n| Title           = Fridgy\n| DirectedBy      = Adam Henry\n| WrittenBy       = [[John Viener]]\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|15}}\n| ProdCode        = 1LAZ03\n| Viewers         = 1.17<ref name=\"1.05\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-sunday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-15-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Sunday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.15.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 17, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 17, 2020}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = The Harrises' refrigerator finally breaks down after years of use and they head to the store to buy a new one. They are greeted by Janine who presents them with a smart fridge from ConVee. The Harrises are happy with the fridge, which they name Fridgy, as it can perform all of their tasks and chores giving them ample time to do the things they have always wanted to do. However, Annie is shocked when she realizes that Fridgy keeps a tab on many of her personal things, such as having sex with Jack on the kitchen floor, and finds herself left out of the family's personal time. When she confronts Fridgy about it, it locks the Harrises in the house. They escape, but are taken to the ConVee headquarters where Janine wants them to be the family of the future. Annie gives a speech about making an effort and the family agree with her. Janine threatens to kill them, but the Harrises have the appliances fight one another and they escape the exploding base.

Feeling he cannot compete, his family convince him to find a new avenue in life. Jack reveals that he has been writing a rock opera called ''Rommy'', which clearly takes cues from ''[[Tommy (The Who album)|Tommy]]'', and convinces his family to perform in it, despite its clearly awful inception and development. Duncan and Kimberly are initially disgusted with their roles (playing the lead and pregnant girlfriend), but after telling their friends about it, who actually seem intrigued by it, they decide to go through with the musical. Annie gets rid of the flyers by dumping them in the sewers, but it causes the town to flood. The townspeople rush to the theater while ''Rommy'' is on and Jack is asked to fix the town's plumbing. Bobby is revealed to not actually be a real plumber and he fills in for Jack in the last number. The play ends up being a huge success and the town is saved with Jack deciding to return to his old job.
