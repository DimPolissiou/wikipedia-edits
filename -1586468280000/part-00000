From arstechnica on 04/02: \"California has 8,200 confirmed cases. On a per-capita basis, that makes California about average among the states. However, that figure comes with a big caveat: California has only gotten results back for about 30,000 tests, and it says it has 57,400 test results pending. The tests returned so far have shown a positive rate of 27 percent. If the backlogged specimens are positive at a similar rate, it will add thousands of people to California's count of confirmed coronavirus carriers.

From arstechnica on 04/02: \"California has 8,200 confirmed cases. On a per-capita basis, that makes California about average among the states. However, that figure comes with a big caveat: California has only gotten results back for about 30,000 tests, and it says it has 57,400 test results pending. The tests returned so far have shown a positive rate of 27 percent. If the backlogged specimens are positive at a similar rate, it will add thousands of people to California's count of confirmed coronavirus carriers.

Her work has appeared in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''The Best American Short Stories'' (1993, 2006, 2012), and ''The O. Henry Prize Stories'' (1998, 2008).\n\n==Life==\nGaitskill was born in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. She has lived in [[New York City]], [[Toronto]], [[San Francisco]], [[Marin County, California|Marin County]] and [[Pennsylvania]], as well as attending the [[University of Michigan]], where she earned her B.A. in 1981<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blueflowerarts.com/artist/mary-gaitskill/|title=Mary Gaitskill|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref> and won a [[Hopwood Award]]. She sold flowers in San Francisco as a teenage runaway. In a conversation with novelist and short story writer [[Matthew Sharpe]] for ''[[BOMB Magazine]]'', Gaitskill said she chose to become a writer at age 18 because she was \"indignant about things\u2014it was the typical teenage sense of 'things are wrong in the world and I must say something.'\"<ref>Sharpe, Matthew. [http://bombsite.com/issues/107/articles/3265 \"Mary Gaitskill\"]. ''[[BOMB Magazine]]''. Spring 2009. Retrieved July 27, 2011.</ref> Gaitskill has also recounted (in her essay \"Revelation\") becoming a born-again Christian at age 21 but lapsing after six months.\n\nShe married the writer [[Peter Trachtenberg]] in 2001. They divorced in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|last=Barrodale|first=Amie|title=I'm Psychic... with Mary Gaitskill|url=https://www.vice.com/read/im-psychic-mary-gaitskill|work=Interview with Vice Magazine|magazine=Vice Magazine|accessdate=October 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\nGaitskill has taught at [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]], the [[University of Houston]], [[New York University]], [[The New School]], [[Brown University]], in the MFA program at [[Temple University]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cla.temple.edu/english/faculty/mary-gaitskill/|title=Department of English: Mary Gaitskill|publisher=Temple University College of Liberal Arts|access-date=February 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203162351/http://www.cla.temple.edu/english/faculty/mary-gaitskill/|archive-date=February 3, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> and [[Syracuse University]]. She was the Writer-In-Residence at [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges]]. As of 2020, Gaitskill is a [[Visiting Professor|visiting professor]] of literature at [[Claremont McKenna College]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmc.edu/news/prof-mary-gaitskill-recognized-by-american-academy-of-arts-and-letters|title=Prof. Mary Gaitskill recognized by American Academy of Arts and Letters|last=Affairs|first=Office of Public|last2=Claremont|first2=Communications 400 N. Claremont Blvd|website=cmc.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-01-04|last3=537-3559}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\nGaitskill attempted to find a publisher for four years before her first book, the short story collection ''Bad Behavior,'' was published in 1988. The first four stories are written in the third person point of view from the perspectives of male characters. The remaining five stories are written from the perspectives of female characters. ''Secretary'' is the only story in the book written in the first person point of view. Several of the stories have themes of sexuality, romance, love, [[sex work]], [[sadomasochism]], drug addiction, being a writer in New York City, and living in New York City. ''A Romantic Weekend'' and ''Secretary'' both explore themes of [[BDSM]] and psychological aspects of dominance and submission in sexual relationships. The story ''Connection'' is about a female friendship.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gaitskill|first1=Mary|title=Bad Behavior|date=1988|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4391-4887-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/badbehaviorstori0000gait}}</ref>\n\nGaitskill's fiction is typically about female characters dealing with their own inner conflicts, and her subject matter matter-of-factly includes many \"taboo\" subjects such as [[prostitution]], [[Substance dependence|addiction]], and [[sado-masochism]].  Gaitskill says that she had worked as a stripper and call girl.  She showed similar candor in an essay about being raped, \"On Not Being a Victim,\" for ''[[Harper's]]''.\n\nGaitskill's 1994 essay in ''Harper's'' also addresses feminist debates about [[date rape]], victimization, and responsibility. She describes ways that individual subjectivity influences all experiences, making it impossible to come to \"universally agreed-upon conclusions.\" <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gaitskill|first1=Mary|title=On Not Being a Victim|journal=Harper's Magazine|date=March 1994|volume=288|issue=1726|page=35}}</ref>\n\nThe film ''[[Secretary (2002 film)|Secretary]]'' (2002) is based on the short story of the same name in ''Bad Behavior'', although the two have little in common.  She characterized the film as \"the ''[[Pretty Woman]]'' version, heavy on the charm (and a little too nice),\" but observed that the \"bottom line is that if [a film adaptation is] made you get some money and exposure, and people can make up their minds from there.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Mary Gaitskill Interview|url=http://failbetter.com/19/GaitskillInterview.php?sxnSrc=ltst|publisher=Failbetter|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe novel ''Two Girls, Fat and Thin'' follows the childhood and adult lives of Justine Shade (thin) and Dorothy Never (fat).  Justine works through her sadomasochistic issues while Dorothy works through her up-and-down commitment to the philosophy of \"Definitism\" and its founder \"Anna Granite\" (thinly veiled satires of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] and [[Ayn Rand]]).  When journalist Justine interviews Dorothy for an expos\u00e9 of Definitism, an unusual relationship begins between the two women.  In an interview, Gaitskill discussed what she was trying to convey about Justine via her sadomasochistic impulses:\n\n{{ quote|It's a kind of inward aggression. It seems like self-contempt, but it's really an inverted contempt for everything. That's what I was trying to describe in her. I would say it had to do with her childhood, not because she was sexually abused, but because the world that she was presented with was so inadequate in terms of giving her a full-spirited sense of herself. That inadequacy can make you implode with a lot of disgust. It can become the gestalt of who you are. So the masochism is like \"I'm going to make myself into a debased object because that is what I think of you. This is what I think of your love. I don't want your love. Your love is shit. Your love is nothing.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Alexander Laurence (originally at Altx.com) |url=http://www.altx.com/int2/mary.gaitskill.html |date=1994 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921215639/http://www.altx.com/int2/mary.gaitskill.html |archivedate=2016-09-21 }}</ref>}}\n\nThe novel ''The Mare'', published in 2015, is written from the perspectives of several different characters. The primary characters are named Ginger and Velvet (short for Velveteen). Ginger is a middle-aged woman who meets Velvet, a young adolescent, through [[The Fresh Air Fund]]. Other characters whose perspectives are featured include Paul (Ginger's husband), Silvia (Velvet's mother), Dante (Velvet's younger brother), and Beverly (a horse trainer).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gaitskill|first1=Mary|title=The Mare|date=2015|publisher=Pantheon|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-37974-0}}</ref>\n\nGaitskill's honors include a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2002 and a PEN/Faulkner Award nomination for ''Because They Wanted To'' in 1998. ''Veronica'' (2005) was a [[National Book Award]] nominee, as well as a National Book Critics Circle finalist for that year.  The book is centered on the narrator, a former fashion model and her friend Veronica who contracts [[AIDS]].  Gaitskill mentioned working on the novel in a 1994 interview, but that same year she put it aside until 2001.  Writing of ''Veronica'' and Gaitskill's career in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' in March 2006, [[Wyatt Mason]] said:\n\n{{ quote|Through four books over eighteen years, Mary Gaitskill has been formulating her fiction around the immutable question of how we manage to live in a seemingly inscrutable world. In the past, she has described, with clarity and vision, the places in life where we sometimes get painfully caught. Until ''Veronica'', however, she had never ventured to show fully how life could also be made a place where, despite all, we find meaningful release.}}\n\nGaitskill's favorite writers have changed over time, as she noted in a 2005 interview,<ref>[http://www.barnesandnoble.com/writers/writerdetails.asp?z=y&cid=973021#interview Barnes & Noble.com - Mary Gaitskill - Books: Meet the Writers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> but one constant is the author [[Vladimir Nabokov]], whose ''[[Lolita]]'' \"will be on my ten favorites list until the end of my life.\" Another consistently named influence is [[Flannery O'Connor]]. Despite her well-known S/M themes, Gaitskill does not appear to consider the [[Marquis de Sade]] himself an influence, or at least not a literary one:  \"I don't think much of Sade as a writer, although I enjoyed beating off to him as a child.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Alexander Laurence/Portable Infinite (originally at Altx.com)|url=http://portable-infinite.blogspot.com/2006/11/mary-gaitskill-interview.html|date=1994}}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n*''Bad Behavior'' (1988) (stories) {{ISBN|0-671-65871-9}}\n*''Two Girls, Fat and Thin'' (1991) (novel) {{ISBN|0-671-68540-6}}\n*''Because They Wanted To'' (1997) (stories) {{ISBN|0-684-80856-0}}\n*''Veronica'' (2005) (novel, [[National Book Award]] Finalist) {{ISBN|0-375-42145-9}}\n*''Don't Cry'' (2009) (stories) {{ISBN|0-375-42419-9}}\n*''The Mare'' (November 2015) (novel) {{ISBN|978-0307379740}}\n*''Somebody with a Little Hammer'' (2017) (essays) {{ISBN|0-307-37822-5}}\n\n==Awards==\n\n* [[Hopwood Award]]\n* [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] for fiction (2002)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://womenwriters.as.uky.edu/presenters/mary-gaitskill|title=Mary Gaitskill {{!}} womenwriters.as.uky.edu|website=womenwriters.as.uky.edu|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref>\n* Cullman Research Fellowship at the [[New York Public Library]] (2010)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://womenwriters.as.uky.edu/presenters/mary-gaitskill|title=Mary Gaitskill {{!}} womenwriters.as.uky.edu|website=womenwriters.as.uky.edu|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref>\n* Arts and Letters Award in Literature, [[The American Academy of Arts and Letters]] (2018).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://artsandletters.org/pressrelease/2018-literature-award-winners/|title=2018 LITERATURE AWARD WINNERS|website=artsandletters.org|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* [http://www.narrativemagazine.com/issues/spring-2010/mary-gaitskill Author interview] (2010) by Suzanne Warren at [http://www.narrativemagazine.com/issues/spring-2010/mary-gaitskill Narrative.com].\n* {{Cite web |url=http://www.collegecrier.com/interviews/int-00351.asp |work=College Crier |first=Carri Anne |last=Yager |title=Mary Gaitskill: Critics line up to praise her work- and don't have a clue |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009042111/http://www.collegecrier.com/interviews/int-00351.asp |archivedate=2007-10-09 }}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060421140536/http://www.failbetter.com/19/GaitskillInterview.htm Author interview] (2005?) at [http://www.failbetter.com failbetter.com].\n* [http://www.barnesandnoble.com/writers/writerdetails.asp?z=y&cid=973021#interview Author interview] (2005) for Barnes & Noble's \"Meet the Writers\" website.

Retrieved July 27, 2011.</ref> Gaitskill has also recounted (in her essay \"Revelation\") becoming a born-again Christian at age 21 but lapsing after six months.\n\nShe married the writer [[Peter Trachtenberg]] in 2001. They divorced in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|last=Barrodale|first=Amie|title=I'm Psychic... with Mary Gaitskill|url=https://www.vice.com/read/im-psychic-mary-gaitskill|work=Interview with Vice Magazine|magazine=Vice Magazine|accessdate=October 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\nGaitskill has taught at [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]], the [[University of Houston]], [[New York University]], [[The New School]], [[Brown University]], in the MFA program at [[Temple University]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cla.temple.edu/english/faculty/mary-gaitskill/|title=Department of English: Mary Gaitskill|publisher=Temple University College of Liberal Arts|access-date=February 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203162351/http://www.cla.temple.edu/english/faculty/mary-gaitskill/|archive-date=February 3, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> and [[Syracuse University]]. She was the Writer-In-Residence at [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges]]. As of 2020, Gaitskill is a [[Visiting Professor|visiting professor]] of literature at [[Claremont McKenna College]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmc.edu/news/prof-mary-gaitskill-recognized-by-american-academy-of-arts-and-letters|title=Prof. Mary Gaitskill recognized by American Academy of Arts and Letters|last=Affairs|first=Office of Public|last2=Claremont|first2=Communications 400 N.

The first four stories are written in the third person point of view from the perspectives of male characters. The remaining five stories are written from the perspectives of female characters. ''Secretary'' is the only story in the book written in the first person point of view. Several of the stories have themes of sexuality, romance, love, [[sex work]], [[sadomasochism]], drug addiction, being a writer in New York City, and living in New York City. ''A Romantic Weekend'' and ''Secretary'' both explore themes of [[BDSM]] and psychological aspects of dominance and submission in sexual relationships. The story ''Connection'' is about a female friendship.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gaitskill|first1=Mary|title=Bad Behavior|date=1988|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4391-4887-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/badbehaviorstori0000gait}}</ref>\n\nGaitskill's fiction is typically about female characters dealing with their own inner conflicts, and her subject matter matter-of-factly includes many \"taboo\" subjects such as [[prostitution]], [[Substance dependence|addiction]], and [[sado-masochism]].  Gaitskill says that she had worked as a stripper and call girl.  She showed similar candor in an essay about being raped, \"On Not Being a Victim,\" for ''[[Harper's]]''.\n\nGaitskill's 1994 essay in ''Harper's'' also addresses feminist debates about [[date rape]], victimization, and responsibility. She describes ways that individual subjectivity influences all experiences, making it impossible to come to \"universally agreed-upon conclusions.\" <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gaitskill|first1=Mary|title=On Not Being a Victim|journal=Harper's Magazine|date=March 1994|volume=288|issue=1726|page=35}}</ref>\n\nThe film ''[[Secretary (2002 film)|Secretary]]'' (2002) is based on the short story of the same name in ''Bad Behavior'', although the two have little in common.  She characterized the film as \"the ''[[Pretty Woman]]'' version, heavy on the charm (and a little too nice),\" but observed that the \"bottom line is that if [a film adaptation is] made you get some money and exposure, and people can make up their minds from there.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Mary Gaitskill Interview|url=http://failbetter.com/19/GaitskillInterview.php?sxnSrc=ltst|publisher=Failbetter|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe novel ''Two Girls, Fat and Thin'' follows the childhood and adult lives of Justine Shade (thin) and Dorothy Never (fat).  Justine works through her sadomasochistic issues while Dorothy works through her up-and-down commitment to the philosophy of \"Definitism\" and its founder \"Anna Granite\" (thinly veiled satires of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] and [[Ayn Rand]]).  When journalist Justine interviews Dorothy for an expos\u00e9 of Definitism, an unusual relationship begins between the two women.  In an interview, Gaitskill discussed what she was trying to convey about Justine via her sadomasochistic impulses:\n\n{{ quote|It's a kind of inward aggression. It seems like self-contempt, but it's really an inverted contempt for everything. That's what I was trying to describe in her. I would say it had to do with her childhood, not because she was sexually abused, but because the world that she was presented with was so inadequate in terms of giving her a full-spirited sense of herself. That inadequacy can make you implode with a lot of disgust. It can become the gestalt of who you are. So the masochism is like \"I'm going to make myself into a debased object because that is what I think of you. This is what I think of your love. I don't want your love. Your love is shit. Your love is nothing.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Alexander Laurence (originally at Altx.com) |url=http://www.altx.com/int2/mary.gaitskill.html |date=1994 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921215639/http://www.altx.com/int2/mary.gaitskill.html |archivedate=2016-09-21 }}</ref>}}\n\nThe novel ''The Mare'', published in 2015, is written from the perspectives of several different characters. The primary characters are named Ginger and Velvet (short for Velveteen). Ginger is a middle-aged woman who meets Velvet, a young adolescent, through [[The Fresh Air Fund]]. Other characters whose perspectives are featured include Paul (Ginger's husband), Silvia (Velvet's mother), Dante (Velvet's younger brother), and Beverly (a horse trainer).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gaitskill|first1=Mary|title=The Mare|date=2015|publisher=Pantheon|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-37974-0}}</ref>\n\nGaitskill's honors include a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2002 and a PEN/Faulkner Award nomination for ''Because They Wanted To'' in 1998. ''Veronica'' (2005) was a [[National Book Award]] nominee, as well as a National Book Critics Circle finalist for that year.  The book is centered on the narrator, a former fashion model and her friend Veronica who contracts [[AIDS]].  Gaitskill mentioned working on the novel in a 1994 interview, but that same year she put it aside until 2001.  Writing of ''Veronica'' and Gaitskill's career in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' in March 2006, [[Wyatt Mason]] said:\n\n{{ quote|Through four books over eighteen years, Mary Gaitskill has been formulating her fiction around the immutable question of how we manage to live in a seemingly inscrutable world. In the past, she has described, with clarity and vision, the places in life where we sometimes get painfully caught. Until ''Veronica'', however, she had never ventured to show fully how life could also be made a place where, despite all, we find meaningful release.}}\n\nGaitskill's favorite writers have changed over time, as she noted in a 2005 interview,<ref>[http://www.barnesandnoble.com/writers/writerdetails.asp?z=y&cid=973021#interview Barnes & Noble.com - Mary Gaitskill - Books: Meet the Writers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> but one constant is the author [[Vladimir Nabokov]], whose ''[[Lolita]]'' \"will be on my ten favorites list until the end of my life.\" Another consistently named influence is [[Flannery O'Connor]]. Despite her well-known S/M themes, Gaitskill does not appear to consider the [[Marquis de Sade]] himself an influence, or at least not a literary one:  \"I don't think much of Sade as a writer, although I enjoyed beating off to him as a child.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Alexander Laurence/Portable Infinite (originally at Altx.com)|url=http://portable-infinite.blogspot.com/2006/11/mary-gaitskill-interview.html|date=1994}}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n*''Bad Behavior'' (1988) (stories) {{ISBN|0-671-65871-9}}\n*''Two Girls, Fat and Thin'' (1991) (novel) {{ISBN|0-671-68540-6}}\n*''Because They Wanted To'' (1997) (stories) {{ISBN|0-684-80856-0}}\n*''Veronica'' (2005) (novel, [[National Book Award]] Finalist) {{ISBN|0-375-42145-9}}\n*''Don't Cry'' (2009) (stories) {{ISBN|0-375-42419-9}}\n*''The Mare'' (November 2015) (novel) {{ISBN|978-0307379740}}\n*''Somebody with a Little Hammer'' (2017) (essays) {{ISBN|0-307-37822-5}}\n\n==Awards==\n\n* [[Hopwood Award]]\n* [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] for fiction (2002)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://womenwriters.as.uky.edu/presenters/mary-gaitskill|title=Mary Gaitskill {{!}} womenwriters.as.uky.edu|website=womenwriters.as.uky.edu|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref>\n* Cullman Research Fellowship at the [[New York Public Library]] (2010)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://womenwriters.as.uky.edu/presenters/mary-gaitskill|title=Mary Gaitskill {{!}} womenwriters.as.uky.edu|website=womenwriters.as.uky.edu|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref>\n* Arts and Letters Award in Literature, [[The American Academy of Arts and Letters]] (2018).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* [http://www.narrativemagazine.com/issues/spring-2010/mary-gaitskill Author interview] (2010) by Suzanne Warren at [http://www.narrativemagazine.com/issues/spring-2010/mary-gaitskill Narrative.com].\n* {{Cite web |url=http://www.collegecrier.com/interviews/int-00351.asp |work=College Crier |first=Carri Anne |last=Yager |title=Mary Gaitskill: Critics line up to praise her work- and don't have a clue |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009042111/http://www.collegecrier.com/interviews/int-00351.asp |archivedate=2007-10-09 }}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060421140536/http://www.failbetter.com/19/GaitskillInterview.htm Author interview] (2005?) at [http://www.failbetter.com failbetter.com].\n* [http://www.barnesandnoble.com/writers/writerdetails.asp?z=y&cid=973021#interview Author interview] (2005) for Barnes & Noble's \"Meet the Writers\" website.
