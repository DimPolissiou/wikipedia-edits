It is located on the eastern shore of [[San Francisco Bay]], between [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] to the northwest and [[Hayward, California|Hayward]] to the southeast.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Pre-history===\nThe first inhabitants of the geographic region which would eventually become San Leandro were the ancestors of the [[Ohlone people]], who arrived sometime between 3500 and 2500 BC.\n\n===Pre-American era===\nThe Spanish settlers called these natives Coste\u00f1os or \"coast people\" and the English-speaking settlers called them [[Ohlone|Costanoans]]. San Leandro was first visited by Europeans on March 20, 1772 by Spanish soldier Captain [[Pedro Fages]] and the Spanish Catholic priest Father Crespi.\n\nSan Leandro is located on the [[Rancho San Leandro]] and [[Rancho San Antonio (Peralta)|Rancho San Antonio]] [[Ranchos of California|Mexican land grants]]. Its name refers to [[Leander of Seville]], a sixth-century Spanish bishop.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=5hFuaYgbz64C&pg=PA8|first=Cynthia Vrilakas|last=Simons|title=San Leandro|series=Images of America|publisher=[[Arcadia Publishing]]|year=2008|isbn=9780738559377}}</ref> Both land grants were located along [[El Camino Viejo]], modern 14th Street / State Route 185.\n\nThe smaller, Rancho San Leandro, approximately {{convert|9000|acre|ha}}, was given to [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Estudillo]] in 1842. The larger, Rancho San Antonio, approximately {{convert|44,000|acre|ha}} was given to another Spanish soldier Don Luis Maria Peralta in 1820. Beginning in 1855, two of Estudillo's sons-in-law, John B.

The [[Board of education|board]] of the [[San Leandro Unified School District]] is composed of Monique Tate (Area 1), Christian Rodriguez (Area 2), Evelyn Gonzalez (Area 3), Leo Sheridan (Area 4), Diana J. Prola (Area 5), James Aguilar (Area 6), and Peter Oshinski (At-Large).<ref>[https://www.sanleandro.k12.ca.us/Page/84 San Leandro Unified School District] accessed April 24, 2019</ref>\n\nIn the latter part of the 20th century, San Leandro was home to three high schools: [[San Leandro High School]], [[Pacific High School (San Leandro, California)|Pacific High School]] (in the San Leandro Unified School District) and [[Marina High School (San Leandro, California)|Marina High School]] (located within the San Leandro city limits but coming under the authority of the neighboring [[San Lorenzo Unified School District]]). San Leandro High School was established in 1926. As the city's population grew, so did the need for a second high school. Pacific High School was built across town nearer the industrial area adjacent to State Route 17 (now Interstate 880) and opened in 1960. It featured a round main building and more traditional outbuildings, as well as a lighted football field. (The football field at San Leandro High School did not have, and still does not have, lights. All night games for both high schools were played at the Pacific football field, named C. Burrell Field after a former San Leandro Unified School District superintendent. San Leandro High School's night football games are still played there.)\n\nStudent enrollment declined in San Leandro and statewide in the late 1970s through the mid 1980s. In California, public schools receive their financing from the state based on the number of students. As a result of declining enrollment and corresponding decreases in state funds, both the San Leandro and San Lorenzo school districts were forced to close schools in the 1980s.\n\nThe San Leandro school district could not afford to operate two comprehensive high schools given the decline in enrollment. Amid much controversy, the school board voted to close Pacific High School, which graduated its last class in 1983. Those who wished to keep Pacific High School open cited the fact that it was a much newer facility and handicap accessible, with a more modern football field. Those who were in favor of retaining San Leandro High School maintained that it was a larger campus and therefore had more room to house both school populations; but planned on using Marina High School as a buffer. Through failed dealings and negotiations with the San Lorenzo Unified School District, Marina closed its doors shortly after leaving the City of San Leandro with only 1 high school instead of 3.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nIn 1989, the San Leandro school district sold the property on which Pacific High School was located and the site was developed into the Marina Square Shopping Center. The school's adjacent football field, Burrell Field, and baseball fields were retained. In 2012, the voters of San Leandro approved the Measure M $50 million construction bond for the renovation of Burrell Field and the baseball fields.\n\nIn 1990's and post 2000, student enrollment in the San Leandro school district increased. A new science wing was built at San Leandro High School followed by an Arts Education Center with a performing arts theater. In 2010, a separate campus one block from the main campus at San Leandro High School was opened for 9th grade students and is named after the civil rights leader Fred T. Korematsu, who had many connections to San Leandro and lived close to the city.\n\nIn 2018, the California State Department of Education selected James Madison Elementary as one of 21 elementary schools across Alameda County, and the only school in San Leandro, as a 2018 California Distinguished School.<ref>[https://www.sanleandro.k12.ca.us/site/default.aspx?PageType=3&ModuleInstanceID=12369&ViewID=7b97f7ed-8e5e-4120-848f-a8b4987d588f&RenderLoc=0&FlexDataID=13966&PageID=1 San Leandro Unified School District, James Madison Elementary Named a 2018 California Distinguished School] published May 16, 2018</ref>\n\nSan Leandro High School is home to such academic programs as the Business Academy, Social Justice Academy, and San Leandro Academy of Multimedia (SLAM). One of the award-winning national programs located in San Leandro is Distributed Education Clubs of America (DECA), an association for marketing students. In 2007, six students from San Leandro High School won in their competitive events and won a slot to compete in Orlando, Florida on April 27, 2007.\n\nIn 2018, the College Board Advanced Placement named the San Leandro Unified School District a District of the Year for being the national leader among medium-sized school districts in expanding access to Advanced Placement Program (AP) courses while simultaneously improving AP Exam performance. The San Leandro Unified School District was one of 447 school districts across the U.S. and Canada that achieved placement on the annual AP District Honor Roll.\n\nFrom this list, three AP Districts of the Year were selected based on an analysis of three academic years of AP data. SLUSD was chosen for the \u2018medium\u2019 district population size, which is defined as having between 8,000 and 49,999 students. SLUSD was the only district in the state and only three in the nation who were honored with this recognition.<ref>[https://www.sanleandro.k12.ca.us/site/default.aspx?PageType=3&ModuleInstanceID=12369&ViewID=7b97f7ed-8e5e-4120-848f-a8b4987d588f&RenderLoc=0&FlexDataID=13854&PageID=1 San Leandro Unified School District, San Leandro Unified School District Awarded National \u201cAdvanced Placement District of the Year\u201d by the College Board]</ref>\n\nA number of students residing in San Leandro attend [[San Lorenzo Unified School District]] schools, including [[Arroyo High School (San Lorenzo, California)|Arroyo High School]], Washington Manor Middle School and Corvallis Elementary School, due to proximity to the San Leandro/San Lorenzo border.\n\nThe rest of San Leandro is served by [[San Leandro Unified School District]].\n\n==Government==\n[[Image:SanLeandroCityHall.JPG|thumb|right|City Hall]]\nSan Leandro is a charter city with a Mayor-Council-Manager form of government.<ref>The City Manager is Jeff Kay.

It is located on the eastern shore of [[San Francisco Bay]], between [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] to the northwest and [[Hayward, California|Hayward]] to the southeast.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Pre-history===\nThe first inhabitants of the geographic region which would eventually become San Leandro were the ancestors of the [[Ohlone people]], who arrived sometime between 3500 and 2500 BC.\n\n===Pre-American era===\nThe Spanish settlers called these natives Coste\u00f1os or \"coast people\" and the English-speaking settlers called them [[Ohlone|Costanoans]]. San Leandro was first visited by Europeans on March 20, 1772 by Spanish soldier Captain [[Pedro Fages]] and the Spanish Catholic priest Father Crespi.\n\nSan Leandro is located on the [[Rancho San Leandro]] and [[Rancho San Antonio (Peralta)|Rancho San Antonio]] [[Ranchos of California|Mexican land grants]]. Its name refers to [[Leander of Seville]], a sixth-century Spanish bishop.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=5hFuaYgbz64C&pg=PA8|first=Cynthia Vrilakas|last=Simons|title=San Leandro|series=Images of America|publisher=[[Arcadia Publishing]]|year=2008|isbn=9780738559377}}</ref> Both land grants were located along [[El Camino Viejo]], modern 14th Street / State Route 185.\n\nThe smaller, Rancho San Leandro, approximately {{convert|9000|acre|ha}}, was given to [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Estudillo]] in 1842. The larger, Rancho San Antonio, approximately {{convert|44,000|acre|ha}} was given to another Spanish soldier Don Luis Maria Peralta in 1820. Beginning in 1855, two of Estudillo's sons-in-law, John B.

The [[Board of education|board]] of the [[San Leandro Unified School District]] is composed of Monique Tate (Area 1), Christian Rodriguez (Area 2), Evelyn Gonzalez (Area 3), Leo Sheridan (Area 4), Diana J. Prola (Area 5), James Aguilar (Area 6), and Peter Oshinski (At-Large).<ref>[https://www.sanleandro.k12.ca.us/Page/84 San Leandro Unified School District] accessed April 24, 2019</ref>\n\nIn the latter part of the 20th century, San Leandro was home to three high schools: [[San Leandro High School]], [[Pacific High School (San Leandro, California)|Pacific High School]] (in the San Leandro Unified School District) and [[Marina High School (San Leandro, California)|Marina High School]] (located within the San Leandro city limits but coming under the authority of the neighboring [[San Lorenzo Unified School District]]). San Leandro High School was established in 1926. As the city's population grew, so did the need for a second high school. Pacific High School was built across town nearer the industrial area adjacent to State Route 17 (now Interstate 880) and opened in 1960. It featured a round main building and more traditional outbuildings, as well as a lighted football field. (The football field at San Leandro High School did not have, and still does not have, lights. All night games for both high schools were played at the Pacific football field, named C. Burrell Field after a former San Leandro Unified School District superintendent. San Leandro High School's night football games are still played there.)\n\nStudent enrollment declined in San Leandro and statewide in the late 1970s through the mid 1980s. In California, public schools receive their financing from the state based on the number of students. As a result of declining enrollment and corresponding decreases in state funds, both the San Leandro and San Lorenzo school districts were forced to close schools in the 1980s.\n\nThe San Leandro school district could not afford to operate two comprehensive high schools given the decline in enrollment. Amid much controversy, the school board voted to close Pacific High School, which graduated its last class in 1983. Those who wished to keep Pacific High School open cited the fact that it was a much newer facility and handicap accessible, with a more modern football field. Those who were in favor of retaining San Leandro High School maintained that it was a larger campus and therefore had more room to house both school populations; but planned on using Marina High School as a buffer. Through failed dealings and negotiations with the San Lorenzo Unified School District, Marina closed its doors shortly after leaving the City of San Leandro with only 1 high school instead of 3.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nIn 1989, the San Leandro school district sold the property on which Pacific High School was located and the site was developed into the Marina Square Shopping Center. The school's adjacent football field, Burrell Field, and baseball fields were retained. In 2012, the voters of San Leandro approved the Measure M $50 million construction bond for the renovation of Burrell Field and the baseball fields.\n\nIn 1990's and post 2000, student enrollment in the San Leandro school district increased. A new science wing was built at San Leandro High School followed by an Arts Education Center with a performing arts theater. In 2010, a separate campus one block from the main campus at San Leandro High School was opened for 9th grade students and is named after the civil rights leader Fred T. Korematsu, who had many connections to San Leandro and lived close to the city.\n\nIn 2018, the California State Department of Education selected James Madison Elementary as one of 21 elementary schools across Alameda County, and the only school in San Leandro, as a 2018 California Distinguished School.<ref>[https://www.sanleandro.k12.ca.us/site/default.aspx?PageType=3&ModuleInstanceID=12369&ViewID=7b97f7ed-8e5e-4120-848f-a8b4987d588f&RenderLoc=0&FlexDataID=13966&PageID=1 San Leandro Unified School District, James Madison Elementary Named a 2018 California Distinguished School] published May 16, 2018</ref>\n\nSan Leandro High School is home to such academic programs as the Business Academy, Social Justice Academy, and San Leandro Academy of Multimedia (SLAM). One of the award-winning national programs located in San Leandro is Distributed Education Clubs of America (DECA), an association for marketing students. In 2007, six students from San Leandro High School won in their competitive events and won a slot to compete in Orlando, Florida on April 27, 2007.\n\nIn 2018, the College Board Advanced Placement named the San Leandro Unified School District a District of the Year for being the national leader among medium-sized school districts in expanding access to Advanced Placement Program (AP) courses while simultaneously improving AP Exam performance. The San Leandro Unified School District was one of 447 school districts across the U.S. and Canada that achieved placement on the annual AP District Honor Roll.\n\nFrom this list, three AP Districts of the Year were selected based on an analysis of three academic years of AP data. SLUSD was chosen for the \u2018medium\u2019 district population size, which is defined as having between 8,000 and 49,999 students. SLUSD was the only district in the state and only three in the nation who were honored with this recognition.<ref>[https://www.sanleandro.k12.ca.us/site/default.aspx?PageType=3&ModuleInstanceID=12369&ViewID=7b97f7ed-8e5e-4120-848f-a8b4987d588f&RenderLoc=0&FlexDataID=13854&PageID=1 San Leandro Unified School District, San Leandro Unified School District Awarded National \u201cAdvanced Placement District of the Year\u201d by the College Board]</ref>\n\nA number of students residing in San Leandro attend [[San Lorenzo Unified School District]] schools, including [[Arroyo High School (San Lorenzo, California)|Arroyo High School]], Washington Manor Middle School and Corvallis Elementary School, due to proximity to the San Leandro/San Lorenzo border.\n\nThe rest of San Leandro is served by [[San Leandro Unified School District]].\n\n==Government==\n[[Image:SanLeandroCityHall.JPG|thumb|right|City Hall]]\nSan Leandro is a charter city with a Mayor-Council-Manager form of government.<ref>The City Manager is Jeff Kay.
