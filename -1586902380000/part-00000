Arguably, an effective deterrent as there is no record of them ever being engaged in serious combat.\n\n==== Demographic History ====\nAlthough the population of Hoy is now only around 400, there was a much larger population in the past. In 1890 there were 4 schools on the island and 4 churches suggesting a much larger population. Despite the larger population there was no paved road between the north of the island and the southern tip of the island and [[South Walls]] island, only a footpath. There was however an unsurfaced road between the two villages on the north of the isle; Rackwick and Moaness. <ref name=\":2\">observations of ordnance survey maps of the time.</ref>\n\n==== '''Longhope lifeboat station''' ====\nA Lifeboat has been on Hoy since 1874 which was originally housed in a prominent stone building close to the west end of the causeway that links the two islands of Hoy and South Walls together at a cost of \u00a3228. It was stationed there as it meant that the lifeboat could be dragged over wooden skids and into the sea in either North Bay, giving access to [[Scapa Flow]] or in Aith Hope, an offshoot of the notorious [[Pentland Firth]] to the south. The shed continued to serve as the base of the Longhope lifeboat until 1906, when it was replaced.\n\nThe lifeboat station that stands slightly to the south of the original station which is now home to the Longhope Lifeboat Museum, cost \u00a32,700 to build in 1906. It continued to serve as the base for the Longhope lifeboat until 1999. Whilst based at this station,1969 On 17 March the lifeboat 'T.G.B.' ON 962, capsized while on service to the Liberian vessel 'Irene' and her entire crew of eight lost their lives, known as the Longhope lifeboat disaster.<ref name=\":2\" /> In August of that year an Arun-class lifeboat, Sir Max Aitken II became the Longhope lifeboat. This class was designed to stay permanently afloat, and the decision was taken to move her to purpose-built moorings at Longhope pier. The lifeboats that have served here since have also been stationed at Longhope, including the current vessel the Helen Comrie (a [[Tamar-class lifeboat|Tamar class lifeboat)]] and her predecessor The Queen Mother, which was based here between 2004 and 2006. A station has been built where the lifeboat is moored at Longhope which is also the main habout for boats to and from the island. <ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== '''World Wars''' ====\nThe main naval base for the British fleet in both the [[World War I|First]] and [[World War II|Second]] World Wars, [[Scapa Flow]], was at [[Lyness]] in the southeast of the island. This is because the sheltered harbour offered an ideal location for refuelling and maintaining the fleet.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe sheltered sounds around the islands of [[Flotta]], Fara, Cava and [[Rysa Little]] made up the [[Royal Navy|Royal Navy\u2019s]] main fleet anchorage in [[Scapa Flow]] during both world wars. At Lyness on Hoy, an oil depot, naval quarters and stores were established during [[World War I]] and were considerably developed in the second world war to form the [[Scapa Flow]] Naval Base Headquarters, temporary wartime home to thousands of military and civilian personnel.\n\nNear the modern ferry terminal is a solitary oil storage tank and pumping station, which together now serve as the Scapa Flow Visitor Centre. This tank, which had a capacity of 12 000 tons, was one of four erected in 1917 when oil-fired warships were coming into service with the Royal Navy. The associated pumping station, also built in 1917, housed the steam pumps which drew the heavy fuel oil from tankers at the pier. Originally coal fired, the pumps were converted to diesel power in 1936 when, with the threat of another war looming, plans were laid to massively increase oil-storage capacity. In 1937, Messrs Balfour Beatty & Co. Ltd were contracted to build 12 slightly larger 15 000 [[ton]] tanks, bringing the total complement of above-ground tanks to 16 by 1938. Also in 1937 the considerable engineering challenge of creating underground tanks \u2013 safer from potential aerial attack \u2013 went to [[Sir William Arrol & Co.|Sir William Arrol & Co. Ltd]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/98128/hoy-lyness-royal-naval-oil-terminal|title=Hoy, Lyness, Royal Naval Oil Terminal {{!}} Canmore|website=canmore.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early years of [[World War II|WWII]], up to 12,000 personnel were based in and around [[Lyness]] to support the defences of the naval anchorage at [[Scapa Flow]] and the ships that used it. To support this huge population, hundreds of accommodation huts were built in a number of camps around [[Lyness]]. A large [[wharf]] was built (known as the Golden Wharf because of its huge cost) along with a series of piers and slipways. Offices, workshops, stores and recreational buildings were erected, including a cinema, a theatre and several churches. An earlier headquarters building was replaced in 1943 by an imposing concrete HQ and communications centre, also located high on Wee Fea which now serves as a hotel.\n\nLyness was finally closed as a naval base in 1957, when it was cleared of many of its wartime buildings, but continued to function as an Admiralty oil fuel depot until 1977.\n[[File:Lyness Royal Naval Cemetery, Hoy, Orkney - geograph.org.uk - 121041.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lyness%20Royal%20Naval%20Cemetery,%20Hoy,%20Orkney%20-%20geograph.org.uk%20-%20121041.jpg|thumb|Lyness Royal Naval Cemetery.]]\nLyness Royal Naval Cemetery is situated around 1.0km inland from the naval base and has an area of around 10,000 square meters (2.5 acres). The cemetery was begun in 1915 when [[Scapa Flow]] was the base of the [[Grand Fleet]]. [[Lyness]] remained as a [[Royal Navy|Royal Naval]] base until July 1946 and the cemetery contains graves from both wars. There are 445 [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] burials of the First World War, 109 of which are unidentified. The majority of the graves are of officers, ratings, and members of the land forces lost from H.M.S. \"[[HMS Hampshire (1903)|Hampshire]],\" \"[[HMS Vanguard|Vanguard]],\" \"[[HMS Narborough (1916)|Narborough]]\" and \"[[HMS Opal (1915)|Opal]].\" The 200 burials of the Second World War in the cemetery include those of 26 men from H.M.S. \"Royal Oak\", which was sunk off [[Longhope, Orkney|Longhope]] in Scapa Flow by a [[German U-boat]] on 14 October 1939. 8 of these burials are unidentified. The cemetery also contains the graves of 14 sailors of the [[German Navy]] (the [[High Seas Fleet]] was interned at [[Scapa Flow]] after the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|1918 Armistice]]), 3 German airmen and 1 German sailor from the 1939-45 war and 1 Norwegian sailor of the 1939-45 war.

The Old Man is popular with climbers, and was first climbed in 1966. Created by the erosion of a cliff through [[hydraulic action]] some time after 1750, the stack is no more than a few hundred years old, and paintings 1817 shows the stack with an arch at the bottom which has now further eroded and no longer remains hence it may soon collapse into the sea.\n\nThe dramatic coastline of Hoy can be seen by visitors travelling to Orkney by ferry from the Scottish mainland. It has some of the highest sea cliffs in the UK at St John's Head, which reach 350m (1,150ft)<ref name=\"Smith\" />\n\nThe name Hoy comes from the [[Old Norse language|Norse]] word ''H\u00e1ey'' meaning \"high island\". It is therefore not surprising that the island of Hoy is the most mountainous in the [[Orkney]] [[archipelago]]. The highest point on the island (and indeed the whole archipelago is [[Ward Hill, Hoy|Ward Hill]] which stands at 481 m (1,578 ft) and is to the north of the island.

Arguably, an effective deterrent as there is no record of them ever being engaged in serious combat.\n\n==== Demographic History ====\nAlthough the population of Hoy is now only around 400, there was a much larger population in the past. In 1890 there were 4 schools on the island and 4 churches suggesting a much larger population. Despite the larger population there was no paved road between the north of the island and the southern tip of the island and [[South Walls]] island, only a footpath. There was however an unsurfaced road between the two villages on the north of the isle; Rackwick and Moaness. <ref name=\":2\">observations of ordnance survey maps of the time.</ref>\n\n==== '''Longhope lifeboat station''' ====\nA Lifeboat has been on Hoy since 1874 which was originally housed in a prominent stone building close to the west end of the causeway that links the two islands of Hoy and South Walls together at a cost of \u00a3228. It was stationed there as it meant that the lifeboat could be dragged over wooden skids and into the sea in either North Bay, giving access to [[Scapa Flow]] or in Aith Hope, an offshoot of the notorious [[Pentland Firth]] to the south. The shed continued to serve as the base of the Longhope lifeboat until 1906, when it was replaced.\n\nThe lifeboat station that stands slightly to the south of the original station which is now home to the Longhope Lifeboat Museum, cost \u00a32,700 to build in 1906. It continued to serve as the base for the Longhope lifeboat until 1999. Whilst based at this station,1969 On 17 March the lifeboat 'T.G.B.' ON 962, capsized while on service to the Liberian vessel 'Irene' and her entire crew of eight lost their lives, known as the Longhope lifeboat disaster.<ref name=\":2\" /> In August of that year an Arun-class lifeboat, Sir Max Aitken II became the Longhope lifeboat. This class was designed to stay permanently afloat, and the decision was taken to move her to purpose-built moorings at Longhope pier. The lifeboats that have served here since have also been stationed at Longhope, including the current vessel the Helen Comrie (a [[Tamar-class lifeboat|Tamar class lifeboat)]] and her predecessor The Queen Mother, which was based here between 2004 and 2006. A station has been built where the lifeboat is moored at Longhope which is also the main habout for boats to and from the island. <ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== '''World Wars''' ====\nThe main naval base for the British fleet in both the [[World War I|First]] and [[World War II|Second]] World Wars, [[Scapa Flow]], was at [[Lyness]] in the southeast of the island. This iis because the sheltered harbour offered an ideal location for refuelling and maintaining the fleet.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe sheltered sounds around the islands of [[Flotta]], Fara, Cava and [[Rysa Little]] made up the [[Royal Navy|Royal Navy\u2019s]] main fleet anchorage in [[Scapa Flow]] during both world wars. At Lyness on Hoy, an oil depot, naval quarters and stores were established during [[World War I]] and were considerably developed in the second world war to form the [[Scapa Flow]] Naval Base Headquarters, temporary wartime home to thousands of military and civilian personnel.\n\nNear the modern ferry terminal is a solitary oil storage tank and pumping station, which together now serve as the Scapa Flow Visitor Centre. This tank, which had a capacity of 12 000 tons, was one of four erected in 1917 when oil-fired warships were coming into service with the Royal Navy. The associated pumping station, also built in 1917, housed the steam pumps which drew the heavy fuel oil from tankers at the pier. Originally coal fired, the pumps were converted to diesel power in 1936 when, with the threat of another war looming, plans were laid to massively increase oil-storage capacity. In 1937, Messrs Balfour Beatty & Co. Ltd were contracted to build 12 slightly larger 15 000 [[ton]] tanks, bringing the total complement of above-ground tanks to 16 by 1938. Also in 1937 the considerable engineering challenge of creating underground tanks \u2013 safer from potential aerial attack \u2013 went to [[Sir William Arrol & Co.|Sir William Arrol & Co. Ltd]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/98128/hoy-lyness-royal-naval-oil-terminal|title=Hoy, Lyness, Royal Naval Oil Terminal {{!}} Canmore|website=canmore.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early years of [[World War II|WWII]], up to 12,000 personnel were based in and around [[Lyness]] to support the defences of the naval anchorage at [[Scapa Flow]] and the ships that used it. To support this huge population, hundreds of accommodation huts were built in a number of camps around [[Lyness]]. A large [[wharf]] was built (known as the Golden Wharf because of its huge cost) along with a series of piers and slipways. Offices, workshops, stores and recreational buildings were erected, including a cinema, a theatre and several churches. An earlier headquarters building was replaced in 1943 by an imposing concrete HQ and communications centre, also located high on Wee Fea which now serves as a hotel.\n\nLyness was finally closed as a naval base in 1957, when it was cleared of many of its wartime buildings, but continued to function as an Admiralty oil fuel depot until 1977.\n[[File:Lyness Royal Naval Cemetery, Hoy, Orkney - geograph.org.uk - 121041.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lyness%20Royal%20Naval%20Cemetery,%20Hoy,%20Orkney%20-%20geograph.org.uk%20-%20121041.jpg|thumb|Lyness Royal Naval Cemetery.]]\nLyness Royal Naval Cemetery is situated around 1.0km inland from the naval base and has an area of around 10,000 square meters (2.5 acres). The cemetery was begun in 1915 when [[Scapa Flow]] was the base of the [[Grand Fleet]]. [[Lyness]] remained as a [[Royal Navy|Royal Naval]] base until July 1946 and the cemetery contains graves from both wars. There are 445 [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] burials of the First World War, 109 of which are unidentified. The majority of the graves are of officers, ratings, and members of the land forces lost from H.M.S. \"[[HMS Hampshire (1903)|Hampshire]],\" \"[[HMS Vanguard|Vanguard]],\" \"[[HMS Narborough (1916)|Narborough]]\" and \"[[HMS Opal (1915)|Opal]].\" The 200 burials of the Second World War in the cemetery include those of 26 men from H.M.S. \"Royal Oak\", which was sunk off [[Longhope, Orkney|Longhope]] in Scapa Flow by a [[German U-boat]] on 14 October 1939. 8 of these burials are unidentified. The cemetery also contains the graves of 14 sailors of the [[German Navy]] (the [[High Seas Fleet]] was interned at [[Scapa Flow]] after the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|1918 Armistice]]), 3 German airmen and 1 German sailor from the 1939-45 war and 1 Norwegian sailor of the 1939-45 war.

The Old Man is popular with climbers, and was first climbed in 1966. Created by the erosion of a cliff through [[hydraulic action]] some time after 1750, the stack is no more than a few hundred years old, and paintings 1817 shows the stack with an arch at the bottom which has now further eroded and no longer remains hence it may soon collapse into the sea.\n\nThe dramatic coastline of Hoy can be seen by visitors travelling to Orkney by ferry from the Scottish mainland. It has some of the highest sea cliffs in the UK at St John's Head, which reach 350m (1,150ft)<ref name=\"Smith\" />\n\nThe name Hoy comes from the [[Old Norse language|Norse]] word ''H\u00e1ey'' meaning \"high island\". It is therefore not surprising that the island of Hoy is the most mountainous in the [[Orkney]] [[archipelago]]. The highest point on the island (and indeed the whole archipelago is [[Ward Hill, Hoy|Ward Hill]] which stands at 481 m (1,578 ft) and is to the north of the island.

Once the outer edge of woodland was damaged by wind or by felling, then the inner trees (which would have been used to more shelter) would be vulnerable to damage.
