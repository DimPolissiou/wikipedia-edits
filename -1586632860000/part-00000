The song was a massive hit in German-speaking countries, reaching number-one in Austria and Germany, while it peaked at number two in Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland. The song spent 75 weeks in the Austrian charts and was number-one for ten weeks. The success of this single propelled the release of the Anton (feat. Dj. \u00d6tzi) album, '''Das Album''' in 2000.\n\n====Second album and international recognition====\nIn July 2000, he released a [[cover version]] of [[Bruce Channel]]'s 1962 song \"[[Hey Baby (DJ \u00d6tzi song)|Hey Baby]]\". This single reached number-one in several English-speaking countries, including Australia, Ireland and the United Kingdom.

It reached number one in (Germany) where it stayed for 13 weeks and [[Austria]], number 2 in [[Switzerland]], and number 5 in the European Union, despite the fact that at the time of its release, some of the most popular radio stations in Austria and Germany declined to play the song because its genre did not fit their programme style.

The song was a massive hit in German-speaking countries, reaching number-one in Austria and Germany, while it peaked at number two in Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland. The song spent 75 weeks in the Austrian charts and was number-one for ten weeks. The success of this single propelled the release of the Anton (feat. Dj. \u00d6tzi) album, '''Das Album''' in 2000.\n\n====Second album and international recognition====\nIn July 2000, he released a [[cover version]] of [[Bruce Channel]]'s 1962 song \"[[Hey Baby (DJ \u00d6tzi song)|Hey Baby]]\". This single reached number-one in several English-speaking countries, including Australia, Ireland and the United Kingdom. He followed up this release with a cover version of \"[[Do Wah Diddy Diddy|Do Wah Diddy]]\".\n\n====Continued success====\nIn 2003, he released a cover version of \"[[A Ram Sam Sam]]\", called the \"[[Fast Food Song#DJ .C3.96tzi version|Burger Dance]]\", which reached number-one in Germany, number 3 in Austria and number 7 in Switzerland.\n\nIn 2006, he found success with the [[Volksmusik]]-hit \"Sieben S\u00fcnden\", which became a number 2 hit in Austria and \"I Am the Music Man\" under the pseudonym DJ \u00d6tzi Junior, which reached number-one in Japan.\n\nIn 2007, he released \"[[Ein Stern (...der deinen Namen tr\u00e4gt)]]\" with Austrian [[schlager]] singer [[Nik P.]]. It reached number one in (Germany) where it stayed for 13 weeks and [[Austria]], number 2 in [[Switzerland]], and number 5 in the European Union, despite the fact that at the time of its release, some of the most popular radio stations in Austria and Germany declined to play the song because its genre did not fit their programme style.

It was a [[flagship]] publication of the [[1980s in comics|1980s]] [[alternative comics]] movement, serving as a more intellectual counterpoint to [[Robert Crumb]]'s visceral ''[[Weirdo (magazine)|Weirdo]]'', which followed squarely in the [[Underground comix|underground]] tradition of ''[[Zap Comix|Zap]]'' and ''[[Arcade (comics magazine)|Arcade]]''. Along with the more [[genre]]-oriented ''[[Heavy Metal (magazine)|Heavy Metal]]'' it was also one of the main venues for [[European comics]] in the United States in its day.\n\n== Publication history ==\n===Origins===\nSpiegelman has often described the reasoning and process that led Mouly to start the magazine. After the demise of ''[[Arcade (comics magazine)|Arcade]]'', the '70s [[underground comix]] anthology he co-edited with [[Bill Griffith]], and the general waning of the underground scene, Spiegelman despaired that comics for adults might fade away for good. He had sworn not to work on another magazine where he would be editing his peers because of the tension and jealousies involved;<ref name=Cav>Cavalieri, Joey. \"Jewish Mice, Bubblegum Cards, Comics Art, & Raw Possibilities: an interview with Art Spiegelman & Francoise Mouly,\" ''Comics Journal'' #65 (August 1981), pp. 98-125.</ref> however, Mouly had her own reasons for wanting to do just that. Having set up her small publishing company, '''[[Raw Books & Graphics]]''', in 1977, she envisioned a magazine encompassing the range of her graphic and literary interests as a more attractive prospect than publishing a series of books. Spiegelman finally agreed on New Year's Eve 1979 to co-edit.<ref name=Cav /> The magazine was to provide an outlet for the kinds of comics that had difficulty finding a publisher in the US, in particular younger cartoonists who fit neither the superhero nor the underground mold, and European cartoonists who did not fit the sex-and-sci-fi appetites of ''[[Heavy Metal (magazine)|Heavy Metal]]'' fans.{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=53\u201354}}\n\nAt the time, large-format, graphic [[Punk visual art|punk]] and New Wave design magazines like ''[[Wet (magazine)|Wet]]'' were distributed in [[independent bookstore]]s. Mouly had earlier installed a [[printing press]] in her and Spiegelman's fourth floor walk-up [[SoHo, Manhattan|Soho]] loft and experimented with different bindings and printing techniques. Mouly's approach was hands-on, and she gave great attention to every step of the printing process. She and Spiegelman eventually settled on a very bold, large-scale and upscale package. Calling ''Raw'' a \"graphix magazine,\" they hoped their unprecedented approach would bypass readers' prejudices against comics and force them to look at the work with new eyes.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n=== Volume 1 ===\nIn the midst of a commercial and artistic fallow period in the American comics industry, the lavishly-printed, {{convert|10+1/2|x|14+1/8|in|cm|abbr=on}} first issue of ''Raw'' appeared in July 1980.<ref>\"Spiegelman and Mouly's Raw Premieres,\" ''Comics Journal'' #58 (Sept. 1980), p. 21.</ref> Its production values resulted in a $3.50 cover price, several times the going prices for comics, either mainstream or underground.\n\nThe first eight issues of ''Raw'' (Volume 1), published by Mouly and co-edited by Mouly and Spiegelman, were printed in [[black-and-white]] in an enormous, doormat-sized magazine format with a stapled binding. The physicality of ''Raw'' was evident in each issue: tipped-in plates, bubblegum cards, and torn covers were part of the aesthetic of the magazine, accomplished by hand by Mouly, Spiegelman, and friends at gatherings after the printing of a new issue.{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=61\u201362}}\n\nFor example, one issue came with \"City of Terror\" [[trading card]]s and [[Chewing gum|gum]]; another issue contained a [[flexi disc]] with a [[sound collage]] made from excerpts of [[Ronald Reagan]]'s speeches; a third issue had a corner torn off the cover, with the missing corner from a ''different'' copy taped inside.\n\nIn 1987 [[Pantheon Books]] published a book collection of pieces from the first three issues titled ''[[Read Yourself Raw]]''.\n\n=== Volume 2 ===\nThe final three issues of ''Raw'' (Volume 2) were printed in a \"[[digest size|digest]]\" or \"[[paperback]]\" format with a mixture of full-color and [[black-and-white]] pages, some of which were printed on differing [[paper]] stock. They featured longer stories that focused more on narrative than bold graphic experiments. These issues were published by [[Penguin Books]].\n\nIn 1991, Mouly and Spiegelman published the final issue of ''Raw'', which was no longer a small, hands-on operation, nor was it something they still thought necessary, as the artists then had a range of publishing outlets that had not existed when ''Raw'' first saw the light of day.{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=77\u201378}}\n\n==Contents==\nAmong the comics the first issue contained was the only strip Mouly herself was to produce, \"Industry News and Review No. 6\", an autobiographical strip in which she contemplates her late-1970s anxieties and thoughts of suicide.{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=55\u201456}} Other strips in the eclectic anthology included an example of the early 20th-century newspaper strip ''[[Dream of the Rarebit Fiend]]'' by [[Winsor McCay]], and an excerpt from ''Manhattan'' by contemporary French cartoonist [[Jacques Tardi]].{{sfn|Heer|2013|p=59}}\n\nAs an editor, Mouly was hands-on, suggesting ideas and changes \u2014 an approach anathema to the editor-adverse underground spirit, but artists welcomed her input as in the end she did not interfere with their autonomy.{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=67\u201368}}\n\n''Raw'' featured a mix of American and European contributors (including some of Spiegelman's students at the [[School of Visual Arts]]), as well as various contributors from other parts of the world, including the Argentine duo of [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Mu\u00f1oz|Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz]] and [[Carlos Sampayo]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] painter [[Ch\u00e9ri Samba]], and several Japanese cartoonists known for their work in ''[[Garo (magazine)|Garo]]''.

It was a [[flagship]] publication of the [[1980s in comics|1980s]] [[alternative comics]] movement, serving as a more intellectual counterpoint to [[Robert Crumb]]'s visceral ''[[Weirdo (magazine)|Weirdo]]'', which followed squarely in the [[Underground comix|underground]] tradition of ''[[Zap Comix|Zap]]'' and ''[[Arcade (comics magazine)|Arcade]]''. Along with the more [[genre]]-oriented ''[[Heavy Metal (magazine)|Heavy Metal]]'' it was also one of the main venues for [[European comics]] in the United States in its day.\n\n== Publication history ==\n===Origins===\nSpiegelman has often described the reasoning and process that led Mouly to start the magazine. After the demise of ''[[Arcade (comics magazine)|Arcade]]'', the '70s [[underground comix]] anthology he co-edited with [[Bill Griffith]], and the general waning of the underground scene, Spiegelman despaired that comics for adults might fade away for good. He had sworn not to work on another magazine where he would be editing his peers because of the tension and jealousies involved;<ref name=Cav>Cavalieri, Joey. \"Jewish Mice, Bubblegum Cards, Comics Art, & Raw Possibilities: an interview with Art Spiegelman & Francoise Mouly,\" ''Comics Journal'' #65 (August 1981), pp. 98-125.</ref> however, Mouly had her own reasons for wanting to do just that. Having set up her small publishing company, '''[[Raw Books & Graphics]]''', in 1977, she envisioned a magazine encompassing the range of her graphic and literary interests as a more attractive prospect than publishing a series of books. Spiegelman finally agreed on New Year's Eve 1979 to co-edit.<ref name=Cav /> The magazine was to provide an outlet for the kinds of comics that had difficulty finding a publisher in the US, in particular younger cartoonists who fit neither the superhero nor the underground mold, and European cartoonists who did not fit the sex-and-sci-fi appetites of ''[[Heavy Metal (magazine)|Heavy Metal]]'' fans.{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=53\u201354}}\n\nAt the time, large-format, graphic [[Punk visual art|punk]] and New Wave design magazines like ''[[Wet (magazine)|Wet]]'' were distributed in [[independent bookstore]]s. Mouly had earlier installed a [[printing press]] in her and Spiegelman's fourth floor walk-up [[SoHo, Manhattan|Soho]] loft and experimented with different bindings and printing techniques. Mouly's approach was hands-on, and she gave great attention to every step of the printing process. She and Spiegelman eventually settled on a very bold, large-scale and upscale package. Calling ''Raw'' a \"graphix magazine,\" they hoped their unprecedented approach would bypass readers' prejudices against comics and force them to look at the work with new eyes.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n=== Volume 1 ===\nIn the midst of a commercial and artistic fallow period in the American comics industry, the lavishly-printed, {{convert|10+1/2|x|14+1/8|in|cm|abbr=on}} first issue of ''Raw'' appeared in July 1980.<ref>\"Spiegelman and Mouly's Raw Premieres,\" ''Comics Journal'' #58 (Sept. 1980), p. 21.</ref> Its production values resulted in a $3.50 cover price, several times the going prices for comics, either mainstream or underground.\n\nThe first eight issues of ''Raw'' (Volume 1), published by Mouly and co-edited by Mouly and Spiegelman, were printed in [[black-and-white]] in an enormous, doormat-sized magazine format with a stapled binding. The physicality of ''Raw'' was evident in each issue: tipped-in plates, bubblegum cards, and torn covers were part of the aesthetic of the magazine, accomplished by hand by Mouly, Spiegelman, and friends at gatherings after the printing of a new issue.{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=61\u201362}}  \n\nFor example, one issue came with \"City of Terror\" [[trading card]]s and [[Chewing gum|gum]]; another issue contained a [[flexi disc]] with a [[sound collage]] made from excerpts of [[Ronald Reagan]]'s speeches; a third issue had a corner torn off the cover, with the missing corner from a ''different'' copy taped inside. \n\nIn 1987 [[Pantheon Books]] published a book collection of pieces from the first three issues titled ''[[Read Yourself Raw]]''.\n\n=== Volume 2 ===\nThe final three issues of ''Raw'' (Volume 2) were printed in a \"[[digest size|digest]]\" or \"[[paperback]]\" format with a mixture of full-color and [[black-and-white]] pages, some of which were printed on differing [[paper]] stock. They featured longer stories that focused more on narrative than bold graphic experiments. These issues were published by [[Penguin Books]].\n\nIn 1991, Mouly and Spiegelman published the final issue of ''Raw'', which was no longer a small, hands-on operation, nor was it something they still thought necessary, as the artists then had a range of publishing outlets that had not existed when ''Raw'' first saw the light of day.{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=77\u201378}}\n\n==Contents==\nAmong the comics the first issue contained was the only strip Mouly herself was to produce, \"Industry News and Review No. 6\", an autobiographical strip in which she contemplates her late-1970s anxieties and thoughts of suicide.{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=55\u201456}} Other strips in the eclectic anthology included an example of the early 20th-century newspaper strip ''[[Dream of the Rarebit Fiend]]'' by [[Winsor McCay]], and an excerpt from ''Manhattan'' by contemporary French cartoonist [[Jacques Tardi]].{{sfn|Heer|2013|p=59}}\n\nAs an editor, Mouly was hands-on, suggesting ideas and changes \u2014 an approach anathema to the editor-adverse underground spirit, but artists welcomed her input as in the end she did not interfere with their autonomy.{{sfn|Heer|2013|pp=67\u201368}} \n\n''Raw'' featured a mix of American and European contributors (including some of Spiegelman's students at the [[School of Visual Arts]]), as well as various contributors from other parts of the world, including the Argentine duo of [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Mu\u00f1oz|Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz]] and [[Carlos Sampayo]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] painter [[Ch\u00e9ri Samba]], and several Japanese cartoonists known for their work in ''[[Garo (magazine)|Garo]]''.

The film talks about the group of businessmen and politicians \u2013 the ''Loro'' (''Them'') from the title \u2013 who live and act near to media tycoon and politician [[Silvio Berlusconi]].\n\n==Plot==\n===Act 1===\nSergio Morra is a young businessman from [[Taranto]] who manages small-scale trafficking of young escorts which he uses to bribe local politicians and obtain licenses outside normal procedures. Sergio has a relationship with Tamara, an irresponsible young mother unscrupulous just like him, who helps him in his trafficking. The two decide to go to [[Rome]], since Sergio wants to get close to power and aims to reach [[Silvio Berlusconi]].\n\nOnce in Rome, Sergio meets the mysterious Kira, known as ''the Queen Bee'' because of her direct relation with Berlusconi. Meanwhile, Tamara becomes acquainted with former minister Santino Recchia. She flirts with the politician in order to help Sergio to get a contact with Berlusconi. Recchia wants to replace Berlusconi as leader of the centre-right coalition and asks to deputy Cupa Caiafa if she is going to support him in the challenge of the party secretariat.\n\nSergio manages to gather many young escorts and rents an imposing villa in [[Sardinia]] that borders with Berlusconi's summer residence in order to get noticed by him. But Berlusconi is having a very difficult time: alone with his wife Veronica Lario, Berlusconi tries to engage her attentions, but Veronica is now very icy towards him. Diamonds, jokes or a song by the trusted Mariano Apicella are not enough to warm Veronica up again, that claims back her dignity.\n\n[[Forza Italia]] is no longer in government and Berlusconi, left without government offices, has nothing to do, since his family businesses are now controlled by his children. One day, Recchia comes to Berlusconi pleading for help, since Tamara is blackmailing him, asking more money for Sergio, otherwise she will reveal that Recchia is betraying his wife. Berlusconi at first shows himself willing, but then he furiously reveals that he has known that Recchia wants to replace him. Then Berlusconi goes to Rome, telling Veronica that he is involved in political commitments, but he is actually participating in a fashion event with Noemi Letizia, a young and uninhibited girl.\n\nBack at Sardinia, during a talk on his yacht where Veronica suggests that he take back [[Mike Bongiorno]] on TV, Berlusconi notices Morra's boat with lots of naked girls, but, despite a little interest, he decides to take a ride with Veronica on his watercraft and, after a sudden storm, they return to the villa. Back there, Veronica asks Berlusconi if he remembers the song that was played on the day of their marriage: after pretending not to remembering the song, Berlusconi demonstrates his affection to Veronica by summoning [[Fabio Concato]], who sings ''Una domenica bestiale'' for her, the song that was played when they got married.\n\n===Act 2===\n[[Ennio Doris]], an entrepreneur and an old friend of Berlusconi, boasts of his wealth, praising at the same time the entrepreneurial genius of Berlusconi, who is more concerned that he has lost the [[2006 Italian general election|elections]] by only 25,000 votes. Ennio suggests Berlusconi to pass six senators to his side in order to bring down the centre-left government. Meanwhile Veronica decides to leave Berlusconi for a while, announcing that she wants to travel to [[Cambodia]]. Berlusconi manages to persuade several senators to join his side by giving them money or helping them by giving a place to their girlfriends in films or TV productions. The government falls and Berlusconi wins the [[2008 Italian general election|new elections]].\n\nThe loneliness at his Sardinian villa pushes Berlusconi to give in to the requests from Sergio Morra to whom he asks to helping him to organize a party in his villa by bringing as many girls as possible. The army of Morra's escorts are at first happy to be noticed by Berlusconi, but then they clash with a boring and disappointing reality. Kira tries to get some attention from Berlusconi, but she's not able to compete with Sergio and Tamara. After the party, Berlusconi only shows interest for a young girl, Stella, and tries to seduce her, but she refuses him and leaves with a controversial vein. Kira is not in Berlusconi's graces anymore and Sergio and Tamara understand that having arrived to Berlusconi has led to nothing.\n\nAs soon as Berlusconi becomes prime minister again, he has to face the consequences of the [[2009 L'Aquila earthquake|L'Aquila earthquake]], showing up among the refugees and promising new houses for the needing. Nevertheless his behavior in international meetings is embarrassing the highest authorities of Italy and Crepuscolo, one of Berlusconi's most trusted men, asks him to do his job more seriously. One day, Berlusconi is preparing to fly to [[New York City]] in order to talk at the [[United Nations]], but once on the plane he decides to fly to [[Naples]] instead, to see Noemi Letizia on the day of her 18th birthday.\n\nAs more details about his dissoluted behavior come out, Berlusconi finds himself at the centre of a political scandal and sees the allies of a lifetime, including Cupa Caiafa, leaving him. Veronica, back from Cambodia, announces to Berlusconi that she wants to divorce and a furious quarrel begins between the two of them. Crushed by political scandals and more isolated, Berlusconi finally invites Mike Bongiorno to his villa to dinner, even if the presenter is in the end dismissed without much regard. Once alone, Berlusconi activates the fake volcano in his garden, an attraction he said he would have shown to all his guests but that he actually never powered on.\n\nMeanwhile in [[L'Aquila]], refugees enter the new houses built for them by Berlusconi, while firefighters manage to recover an enormous statue of [[Jesus Christ]] by extracting it from a church that was destroyed during the earthquake. The credits are accompanied by a long sequence of shots of the tired firefighters' faces after a long night of work.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Toni Servillo]] as [[Silvio Berlusconi]] and [[Ennio Doris]]\n* [[Elena Sofia Ricci]] as [[Veronica Lario]]\n* [[Riccardo Scamarcio]] as Sergio Morra\n* [[Kasia Smutniak]] as Kira (''The Queen Bee'')\n* [[Euridice Axen]] as Tamara\n* [[Fabrizio Bentivoglio]] as Santino Recchia\n* Roberto De Francesco as Fabrizio Sala \n* [[Dario Cantarelli]] as Paolo Spagnolo\n* [[Anna Bonaiuto]] as Cupa Caiafa\n* [[Roberto Herlitzka]] as Crepuscolo\n* [[Ricky Memphis]] as Riccardo Pasta\n* Yann Gael as Michel Martinez\n* [[Alice Pagani]] as Stella\n* [[Giovanni Esposito]] as Mariano Apicella\n* [[Ugo Pagliai]] as [[Mike Bongiorno]]\n* [[Max Tortora]] as Martino\n* [[Fabio Concato]] as himself\n* [[Paolo Buglioni]] as Sergio's father\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe screenplay was co-written by [[Paolo Sorrentino]] and Umberto Contarello.

The film talks about the group of businessmen and politicians \u2013 the ''Loro'' (''Them'') from the title \u2013 who live and act near to media tycoon and politician [[Silvio Berlusconi]].\n\n==Plot==\n===Act 1===\nSergio Morra is a young businessman from [[Taranto]] who manages small-scale trafficking of young escorts which he uses to bribe local politicians and obtain licenses outside normal procedures. Sergio has a relationship with Tamara, an irresponsible young mother unscrupulous just like him, who helps him in his trafficking. The two decide to go to [[Rome]], since Sergio wants to get close to power and aims to reach [[Silvio Berlusconi]].\n\nOnce in Rome, Sergio meets the mysterious Kira, known as ''the Queen Bee'' because of her direct relation with Berlusconi. Meanwhile, Tamara becomes acquainted with former minister Santino Recchia. She flirts with the politician in order to help Sergio to get a contact with Berlusconi. Recchia wants to replace Berlusconi as leader of the centre-right coalition and asks to deputy Cupa Caiafa if she is going to support him in the challenge of the party secretariat.\n\nSergio manages to gather many young escorts and rents an imposing villa in [[Sardinia]] that borders with Berlusconi's summer residence in order to get noticed by him. But Berlusconi is having a very difficult time: alone with his wife Veronica Lario, Berlusconi tries to engage her attentions, but Veronica is now very icy towards him. Diamonds, jokes or a song by the trusted Mariano Apicella are not enough to warm Veronica up again, that claims back her dignity.\n\n[[Forza Italia]] is no longer in government and Berlusconi, left without government offices, has nothing to do, since his family businesses are now controlled by his children. One day, Recchia comes to Berlusconi pleading for help, since Tamara is blackmailing him, asking more money for Sergio, otherwise she will reveal that Recchia is betraying his wife. Berlusconi at first shows himself willing, but then he furiously reveals that he has known that Recchia wants to replace him. Then Berlusconi goes to Rome, telling Veronica that he is involved in political commitments, but he is actually participating in a fashion event with Noemi Letizia, a young and uninhibited girl.\n\nBack at Sardinia, during a talk on his yacht where Veronica suggests that he take back [[Mike Bongiorno]] on TV, Berlusconi notices Morra's boat with lots of naked girls, but, despite a little interest, he decides to take a ride with Veronica on his watercraft and, after a sudden storm, they return to the villa.
