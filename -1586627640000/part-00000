The identified traits are: 1) extraversion, the quantity and intensity of one's interpersonal interactions 2) neuroticism, the tendency to experience negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, and hostility 3) conscientiousness, the persistence, organization, and motivation exhibited in goal-directed behaviors 4) agreeableness, the quality of one's interpersonal interactions along a continuum from compassion to antagonism 5) openness, the proactive seeking and appreciation of new experiences. The idea behind the big five personality characteristics that makes them compatible to religious study is that each trait is orthogonal, or completely independent from one another.<ref>{{cite book|last=Funder|first=David C.|title=The personality puzzle|year=2010|publisher=W.W.

Open, mature religiosity and spirituality were associated with high openness to experience, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, and with low neuroticism. Religious fundamentalism was associated with higher agreeableness, and lower neuroticism and lower openness to experience. Because of these factors, it was also seen that more religious people seem to be altruistic and more well behaved. However, this correlation is pretty small. It is not known if religious people tend to be better behaved or if better behaved people are more attracted to religion.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Individual Differences and Personality|last=Ashton|first=Michael|publisher=Nikki Levy|year=2018|isbn=978-0-12-809845-5|location=125 London Wall, London EC2Y 5AS, United Kingdom|pages=306}}</ref> Extrinsic religiosity was associated with higher neuroticism but unrelated to the other personality factors. All of these relationships between personality and religion were small. This finding does not necessarily support the concept of personality for being the specific reason for religiosity, however this correlation with the FFM can lead to more in depth research on the topic.\n\n===Strengths and weaknesses===\nAs previously stated, one of the major strengths for using the FFM to study religiosity in people is that it is empirically tested, and how accurate the measure actually is in accordance to personality.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Costa|first1=P|last2=McCrae|title=The NEO PI-R Professional Manual|journal=The NEO PI-R Professional Manual|date=1992}}</ref> Another strength is that the big five is an excellent starting point for beginning to look at links between personality and religiosity because it is simply laid out. While this is a huge strength, some research argues that its downfall lies in that it is solely a personality indicator, and is not compatible with religious or spiritual matters.  For example, in another study that investigated the correlation between religiosity and the FFM, a conclusion was drawn that religiosity and/or spirituality should be made into a sixth personality factor in order to truly make research using this model accurate.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Piedmont|first=R|title=Strategies for using the five factor model of personality in religious research|journal=Journal of Psychology and Theology|volume=27|issue=4|pages=338\u2013350|doi=10.1177/009164719902700406|year=1999}}</ref> As more advances in research using the FFM to study religiosity and spirituality come, there will be a clearer cut answer as to whether there is a significant place for the FFM in studying religious behavior.\n\n==Attachment theory==\n[[Attachment Theory]] is another example of a personality indicator with the ability to help researchers understand religiosity and spirituality.  The basic premise of attachment theory is that infants form relationships with their caregivers, and depending on the type of attachment, personality and future relationships will be influenced accordingly.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bowlby|first=J|title=Attachment and loss: Separation, anxiety and anger|year=1973|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York}}</ref> The idea behind how the theory relates to the psychology of religion is that these future relationships can be with the particular god, or higher power.\n\nIn attachment theory, there have been three attachment styles identified: 1)secure style- confidence in the availability of attachment figures during times of need 2)avoidant style- insecurity and lack of trust in the ability of others to care for one's needs 3) anxious-ambivalent style- view of others as being reluctant to get close to oneself.<ref>{{cite book|last=Park|first=edited by Raymond F. Paloutzian, Crystal L.|title=Handbook of the psychology of religion and spirituality|year=2005|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-57230-922-7|pages=256}}</ref> The research varies in explaining which type of attachment style yields the individual's particular relationship with God.  For example, in one study, a secure relationship with one's parents will translate into a secure attachment to God, and vice versa.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kirkpatrick|first=L|title=God as a substitute attachment figure: a longitudinal study of adult attachment style and religious change in college students.|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=1998|volume=24|issue=9|pages=961\u2013973|doi=10.1177/0146167298249004}}</ref> However, other research has showed that there is a compensatory effect, or the need of people to make up for something that is lacking.  For instance, someone with an insecure attachment style with their parents may in turn, have a very secure, and confident relationship with God.<ref>{{cite book|last=Park|first=edited by Raymond F. Paloutzian, Crystal L.|title=Handbook of the psychology of religion and spirituality|year=2005|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1572309227|pages=256\u2013257}}</ref>\n\n===Strengths and weaknesses===\nThe idea of being able to link people's religiousness (or lack thereof) with how their attachment with their caregivers was, seems to be a promising field of study.  The obstacle that makes this seemingly simple idea very complicated is that the current data is so skewed.  There are many studies that found there is a direct correspondence from attachment style with caregivers to God, and there are studies who have found more compensatory results.  The inability of researchers to find a general consensus could be a hindrance towards future exploration in this field.\n\n==Object relations theory==\n[[Object relations theory]]'s roots lie in children relating or associating different emotions with different people (objects).  The children associate these emotions to the objects based on how they currently view the world around them.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kernberg|first=O|title=Structural derivatives of object relationships|journal=International Journal of Psycho-Analysis|pages=236\u2013253}}</ref> For example, kids will associate the emotion of something good with mother, and bad with something like criminals.  In relating this with religious ideals, it seems natural that the same concept should apply.  One's relationship with God should, in theory, be traced back to association.\n\nIn this theory, it is hypothesized that the person ends up creating an idea of God according to what the individual needs, and how he or she perceives the world. This view of personality and religion does not focus on how each person differs trait wise, but it centers on the type of relationship the individual has with God.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rizzuto|first=A|title=The birth of the living god|year=1979|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}</ref>\n\n===Strengths and weaknesses===\nAn important notion to keep in mind with Object Relations theory is that it is highly theoretical.  This is a weakness in the sense that all data is based on a concept that cannot be objectively verified, and thus creates a confound.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lilienfeld|first=S |author2=Wood, J |author3=Garb, H|title=The scientific status of projective tests|journal=Psychological Science in the Public Interest|volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=27\u201366 |year=2000|doi= 10.1111/1529-1006.002 |pmid=26151980 |citeseerx=10.1.1.113.4433 }}</ref> As with all inquiries about the psychological nature of religion, it is difficult to find extremely valid and reliable measures because of the introspective nature of the subject.  That being said, there is something that we can learn from this field of study.  By analyzing how this theory of personality development correlates with one's attachment to a religious deity, we can hopefully begin to understand how important association, and perception is to religious ideals.\n\n== Religious struggles and personality ==\nResearch has shown that struggles with religion correlates to basic personality traits. Studies on [[Big Five personality traits|The Big Five Factors of Personality]], as well as factors such as self-compassion, self-esteem, and entitlement, suggest that there is a significant relationship between religious uncertainty and personality.<ref name=\":02\">http://sites.nd.edu/lapseylab/files/2016/08/Grubbs_etal_SelfStruggleAndSoul_2016.pdf</ref>\n\nPeople who are high in neuroticism may have a hard time trying to find purpose in their life. This correlates with divine struggles as they may encounter distress when it comes to finding the meaning of life as well as recognizing divine figures of religions. Extroversion, however, has not been linked through research or studies with religious struggles. Very little evidence is available to suggest that openness to experience is linked to religious struggles, but it is thought that those who are high in openness to experience may carry more doubt in religion compared to those who are lower in openness to experience. Both agreeableness and conscientiousness have been associated with possible animosity towards God or other divine figures.<ref name=\":02\" />  It has also been found that religious people are more likely to avoid risk.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Does local religiosity matter for bank risk-taking?|journal=Journal of Corporate Finance|volume=38|pages=272\u2013293|doi=10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2016.01.009|year=2016|last1=Adhikari|first1=Binay Kumar|last2=Agrawal|first2=Anup}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Risk aversion and religion|journal=Journal of Risk and Uncertainty|volume=47|issue=2|pages=165\u2013183|doi=10.1007/s11166-013-9174-8|year = 2013|last1 = Noussair|first1 = Charles N.|last2=Trautmann|first2=Stefan T.|last3=Van De Kuilen|first3=Gijs|last4=Vellekoop|first4=Nathanael|url=https://pure.uvt.nl/ws/files/1443326/2012-073.pdf}}</ref>\n\n== Religion and life satisfaction ==\nResearch done by Salsman, Brown, Brechting, and Carlson showed a positive correlation between religion and life satisfaction of about 0.2 to 0.3. It was shown by Salsman that those who practice religion have a generally more positive outlook on life.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite book|title=Individual Differences in Personality|last1=Ashton|first1=Michael C|date=2018|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-12-809845-5|edition=Third|pages=310\u2013311}}</ref> Many elements of religion have been studied to determine which aspects impacts one's life satisfaction. It was found that both personal and organizational religion can lead to an increased life satisfaction. Individual prayer, a feeling of intimacy with the divine, and meditation were all linked to greater psychological well-being and life satisfaction. When it came to organizational religion, people felt a greater satisfaction knowing that they belonged to a group, had a support system from the church, and felt fulfilled when they increased their participation within the church's community.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Elliot|first1=Marta|last2=Hayward|first2=R. David|date=October 1, 2009|title=Religion and Life Satisfaction Worldwide: The Role of Government Regulation|journal=Sociology of Religion|volume=70|issue=3|pages=285\u2013310|doi=10.1093/socrel/srp028}}</ref>\n\nThose who feel conflicted about religion may encounter a decline in their health, both mentally and physically. Research has shown that those who have religious struggles could have higher depression and anxiety levels. The risk of suicide is even elevated when struggle is present within religion. These struggles have been linked to a separation from the church or the divine; however the cause for the separation is unknown and may stem from different events throughout life such as a traumatic death in the family, difficult life events, or a mental battle between oneself.<ref name=\":02\" /> It is likely people who are religiously conflicted show a decline in health, compared to religious people, due to a lack of community support or ability to manage stress. Since a religious community can offer psychological, social, or financial support, it may help people better handle stress or recover from hardship. Not only can religious people benefit from the community, but they can possibly benefit from prayer or meditation.<ref name=\":2\" /> Although, more research is needed to validate the causes of religious separation and how it effect one's personality.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n\n== Religion and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator ==\nThe [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]], or MBTI, uses four dichotomies to indicate a person's psychological preference. When used in studies alongside religion, it has been shown that introverted types (primarily ISTJ and INTJ) are more likely to be atheist. However, a large portion of Greek Orthodox is ISTJ as well. In addition, the \"judging\" (J) type is common among evangelical and Protestants.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.scienceonreligion.org/index.php/news-research/research-updates/573-the-personality-types-of-christians-and-atheists | title=The personality types of Christians and atheists - Science on Religion}}</ref>  ESFJ and ENFJ personality types are more interested in becoming ministers than other type.

This may lead some to believe that the characteristic of being religious would relate in someway to the characteristic of believing in other paranormal beings. However, multiple studies have found no correlation between these two characteristics. This could be due to the fact that many religions discourage their members from thinking too much of paranormal beings, as they are thought to be evil.<ref name=\":0\" /> In conclusion, paranormal beliefs are probably not highly related to personality traits. \n\n== Religion as a personality characteristic ==\nWhile there are many who believe religion has a strong influence on personality development, some believe it may be a personality trait on its own. Vassilis Saroglou, for example,  has developed on the idea by introducing four traits of personality that religion develop: believing, bonding, behaving, and belonging. Believing refers to someone accepting the belief in a supernatural being or world. Bonding is how important religion is to the self and how it connects them to something larger than themselves. Behaving is how someone changes their own lifestyle to appease their spiritual beliefs. Belonging is the identity one acquires from believing in a religion. This concept, published in 2011, easily applies to religion cross-culturally and to a wide range of spirituality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Saroglou|first=Vassilis|date=September 2, 2011|title=Believing, Bonding, Behaving, and Belonging - The Big Four Religious Dimensions and Cultural Variation|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology |volume=42|issue=8|pages=1320\u20131340|doi=10.1177/0022022111412267}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Religion and coping with trauma]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Psychology of religion]]\n[[Category:Personality]]\n[[Category:Religious behaviour and experience]]\n", "text_old": "{{Orphan|date=February 2013}}\nMost scientists agree that [[religiosity]] is not an independent [[Trait theory|personality trait]], despite there being some commonality between their characteristics.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Individual Differences and Personality|last=Ashton|first=Michael C|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|year=2007|isbn=9780123741295|location=Oxford, UK|pages=260\u2013267}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Ashton|first=Michael|title=Individual Differences and Personality (3rd edition)|publisher=Elselvier|year=2018|isbn=978-0-12-809845-5|location=|pages=30, 304-305}}</ref> Religiosity and personality traits both relate to one's feelings, thoughts, and behaviors.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, one's level of religiosity is often measured by the presence or lack of belief in and relationship with a higher power, certain lifestyles or behaviors adopted for a higher power, and a sense of belonging with other followers of one's religion.<ref name=\":1\" /> Additionally, personality traits tend to follow a [[normal distribution]], such that the majority of individuals' scores for a personality trait will be concentrated towards the middle, rather than being extremely high or low.

For instance, someone with an insecure attachment style with their parents may in turn, have a very secure, and confident relationship with God.<ref>{{cite book|last=Park|first=edited by Raymond F. Paloutzian, Crystal L.|title=Handbook of the psychology of religion and spirituality|year=2005|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1572309227|pages=256\u2013257}}</ref>\n\n===Strengths and weaknesses===\nThe idea of being able to link people's religiousness (or lack thereof) with how their attachment with their caregivers was, seems to be a promising field of study.  The obstacle that makes this seemingly simple idea very complicated is that the current data is so skewed.  There are many studies that found there is a direct correspondence from attachment style with caregivers to God, and there are studies who have found more compensatory results.  The inability of researchers to find a general consensus could be a hindrance towards future exploration in this field.\n\n==Object relations theory==\n[[Object relations theory]]'s roots lie in children relating or associating different emotions with different people (objects).  The children associate these emotions to the objects based on how they currently view the world around them.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kernberg|first=O|title=Structural derivatives of object relationships|journal=International Journal of Psycho-Analysis|pages=236\u2013253}}</ref> For example, kids will associate the emotion of something good with mother, and bad with something like criminals.  In relating this with religious ideals, it seems natural that the same concept should apply.  One's relationship with God should, in theory, be traced back to association.\n\nIn this theory, it is hypothesized that the person ends up creating an idea of God according to what the individual needs, and how he or she perceives the world. This view of personality and religion does not focus on how each person differs trait wise, but it centers on the type of relationship the individual has with God.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rizzuto|first=A|title=The birth of the living god|year=1979|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}</ref>\n\n===Strengths and weaknesses===\nAn important notion to keep in mind with Object Relations theory is that it is highly theoretical.  This is a weakness in the sense that all data is based on a concept that cannot be objectively verified, and thus creates a confound.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lilienfeld|first=S |author2=Wood, J |author3=Garb, H|title=The scientific status of projective tests|journal=Psychological Science in the Public Interest|volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=27\u201366 |year=2000|doi= 10.1111/1529-1006.002 |pmid=26151980 |citeseerx=10.1.1.113.4433 }}</ref> As with all inquiries about the psychological nature of religion, it is difficult to find extremely valid and reliable measures because of the introspective nature of the subject.  That being said, there is something that we can learn from this field of study.  By analyzing how this theory of personality development correlates with one's attachment to a religious deity, we can hopefully begin to understand how important association, and perception is to religious ideals.\n\n== Religious struggles and personality ==\nResearch has shown that struggles with religion correlates to basic personality traits. Studies on [[Big Five personality traits|The Big Five Factors of Personality]], as well as factors such as self-compassion, self-esteem, and entitlement, suggest that there is a significant relationship between religious uncertainty and personality.<ref name=\":02\">http://sites.nd.edu/lapseylab/files/2016/08/Grubbs_etal_SelfStruggleAndSoul_2016.pdf</ref>\n\nPeople who are high in neuroticism may have a hard time trying to find purpose in their life. This correlates with divine struggles as they may encounter distress when it comes to finding the meaning of life as well as recognizing divine figures of religions. Extroversion, however, has not been linked through research or studies with religious struggles. Very little evidence is available to suggest that openness to experience is linked to religious struggles, but it is thought that those who are high in openness to experience may carry more doubt in religion compared to those who are lower in openness to experience. Both agreeableness and conscientiousness have been associated with possible animosity towards God or other divine figures.<ref name=\":02\" />  It has also been found that religious people are more likely to avoid risk.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Does local religiosity matter for bank risk-taking?|journal=Journal of Corporate Finance|volume=38|pages=272\u2013293|doi=10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2016.01.009|year=2016|last1=Adhikari|first1=Binay Kumar|last2=Agrawal|first2=Anup}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Risk aversion and religion|journal=Journal of Risk and Uncertainty|volume=47|issue=2|pages=165\u2013183|doi=10.1007/s11166-013-9174-8|year = 2013|last1 = Noussair|first1 = Charles N.|last2=Trautmann|first2=Stefan T.|last3=Van De Kuilen|first3=Gijs|last4=Vellekoop|first4=Nathanael|url=https://pure.uvt.nl/ws/files/1443326/2012-073.pdf}}</ref>\n\n== Religion and life satisfaction ==\nResearch done by Salsman, Brown, Brechting, and Carlson showed a positive correlation between religion and life satisfaction of about 0.2 to 0.3. It was shown by Salsman that those who practice religion have a generally more positive outlook on life.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite book|title=Individual Differences in Personality|last1=Ashton|first1=Michael C|date=2018|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-12-809845-5|edition=Third|pages=310\u2013311}}</ref> Many elements of religion have been studied to determine which aspects impacts one's life satisfaction. It was found that both personal and organizational religion can lead to an increased life satisfaction. Individual prayer, a feeling of intimacy with the divine, and meditation were all linked to greater psychological well-being and life satisfaction. When it came to organizational religion, people felt a greater satisfaction knowing that they belonged to a group, had a support system from the church, and felt fulfilled when they increased their participation within the church's community.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Elliot|first1=Marta|last2=Hayward|first2=R. David|date=October 1, 2009|title=Religion and Life Satisfaction Worldwide: The Role of Government Regulation|journal=Sociology of Religion|volume=70|issue=3|pages=285\u2013310|doi=10.1093/socrel/srp028}}</ref>\n\nThose who feel conflicted about religion may encounter a decline in their health, both mentally and physically. Research has shown that those who have religious struggles could have higher depression and anxiety levels. The risk of suicide is even elevated when struggle is present within religion. These struggles have been linked to a separation from the church or the divine; however the cause for the separation is unknown and may stem from different events throughout life such as a traumatic death in the family, difficult life events, or a mental battle between oneself.<ref name=\":02\" /> It is likely people who are religiously conflicted show a decline in health, compared to religious people, due to a lack of community support or ability to manage stress. Since a religious community can offer psychological, social, or financial support, it may help people better handle stress or recover from hardship. Not only can religious people benefit from the community, but they can possibly benefit from prayer or meditation.<ref name=\":2\" /> Although, more research is needed to validate the causes of religious separation and how it effect one's personality.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n\n== Religion and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator ==\nThe [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]], or MBTI, uses four dichotomies to indicate a person's psychological preference. When used in studies alongside religion, it has been shown that introverted types (primarily ISTJ and INTJ) are more likely to be atheist. However, a large portion of Greek Orthodox is ISTJ as well. In addition, the \"judging\" (J) type is common among evangelical and Protestants.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.scienceonreligion.org/index.php/news-research/research-updates/573-the-personality-types-of-christians-and-atheists | title=The personality types of Christians and atheists - Science on Religion}}</ref>  ESFJ and ENFJ personality types are more interested in becoming ministers than other type. ENFJs are more attracted to becoming ministers of liberal denominations, while ESFJs are more interested in becoming ministers in conservative denominations.<ref>{{cite journal|title=EVIDENCE BEARING ON USE OF THE MYERS\u2010BRIGGS TYPE INDICATOR TO SELECT PERSONS FOR ADVANCED RELIGIOUS TRAINING: A PRELIMINARY REPORT|journal=Ets Research Bulletin Series|volume=1957|issue=2|pages=i-18|doi=10.1002/j.2333-8504.1957.tb00074.x|year = 1957|last1 = Saunders|first1 = D.

And Coming Up Short|journal=Journal of Career Planning & Placement|issue=Fall 1993|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~jobtalk/Articles/develop/mbti.pdf}}</ref>\n\n== Religiosity and paranormal beliefs ==\nMost religions are based around a belief in some sort of supernatural being. This may lead some to believe that the characteristic of being religious would relate in someway to the characteristic of believing in other paranormal beings. According to Thalbourne, evidence suggests that people who are religious tend to have paranormal beliefs. One possible explanation for this is to try to reduce anxiety about dying.<ref name=\":3\" /> However, multiple studies have found no correlation between these two characteristics. This could be due to the fact that many religions discourage their members from thinking too much of paranormal beings, as they are thought to be evil.<ref name=\":0\" /> Research conducted by Thalbourne, Dunbar, and Delin, found Conscientiousness and Neuroticism may be a predictor of paranormal beliefs. Furthermore, Aarnio and Lindeman conducted research to confirm the relationship between religion and paranormal beliefs. One of their findings was that individuals who were believers were more neurotic than skeptics. However, it is possible this is due to the type of religion an individual belongs to.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Aarnio|first=Kia|last2=Lindeman|first2=Marjaana|date=2007-01-01|title=Religious People and Paranormal Believers|url=https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/10.1027/1614-0001.28.1.1|journal=Journal of Individual Differences|volume=28|issue=1|pages=1\u20139|doi=10.1027/1614-0001.28.1.1|issn=1614-0001}}</ref> In conclusion, paranormal beliefs are probably not highly related to personality traits. \n\n== Religion as a personality characteristic ==\nWhile there are many who believe religion has a strong influence on personality development, some believe it may be a personality trait on its own. Vassilis Saroglou, for example,  has developed on the idea by introducing four traits of personality that religion develop: believing, bonding, behaving, and belonging. Believing refers to someone accepting the belief in a supernatural being or world. Bonding is how important religion is to the self and how it connects them to something larger than themselves. Behaving is how someone changes their own lifestyle to appease their spiritual beliefs. Belonging is the identity one acquires from believing in a religion. This concept, published in 2011, easily applies to religion cross-culturally and to a wide range of spirituality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Saroglou|first=Vassilis|date=September 2, 2011|title=Believing, Bonding, Behaving, and Belonging - The Big Four Religious Dimensions and Cultural Variation|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology |volume=42|issue=8|pages=1320\u20131340|doi=10.1177/0022022111412267}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Religion and coping with trauma]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Psychology of religion]]\n[[Category:Personality]]\n[[Category:Religious behaviour and experience]]\n", "name_user": "Abbigail Ely", "label": "safe", "comment": "Revised article too soon.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_and_personality"}

It was originally recorded in February 1971 at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London and released as a single by his short-lived band [[Arnold Corns]] in May 1971 on [[B&C Records]]. Bowie subsequently re-recorded the song later that year with his backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]]\u2014comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]\u2014for release on his 1972 album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''. The re-recording was co-produced by [[Ken Scott]] and recorded at [[Trident Studios]] in London in November 1971. On the album, the song directly introduces the character Ziggy Stardust, who describes himself as a [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] alien rock superstar who will save the Earth from the impending disaster described in the opening track \"[[Five Years (David Bowie song)|Five Years]]\". It features saxophone played by Bowie and a guitar solo and string arrangement by Ronson.\n\nSince its release, \"Moonage Daydream\" has received critical acclaim, with many deeming Ronson's guitar work its clear standout. Bolder, Woodmansey and Scott have called it the best song on the album; retrospectively, it has been named one of Bowie's greatest songs. He played it in concert throughout 1972\u201373 and on later tours. The ''Ziggy'' recording has since appeared on multiple [[compilation album]]s and in the 2014 film ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', while the Arnold Corns' recording has appeared on reissues of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' (1970) and ''Ziggy Stardust''. The ''Ziggy'' recording has been remastered multiple times, including in 2012, which was subsequently included as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set in 2015, along with the Arnold Corns' recording.\n\n==Composition and recording==\n\"Moonage Daydream\" was written during Bowie's US promotional tour in early February 1971.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} After the tour Bowie formed a short-lived band, [[Arnold Corns]], named after the [[Pink Floyd]] song \"[[Arnold Layne]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}} Led by Bowie, the band consisted of guitarist Mark Carr-Pritchard, bassist Peter DeSomogyi and drummer Tim Broadbent, who were known previously as a trio called Rungk.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}} Arnold Corns recorded \"Moonage Daydream\" and \"[[Hang On to Yourself]]\" on 25&nbsp;February 1971 at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=206\u2013207}}{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} Bowie later hired openly gay dress designer Freddie Burretti, for whom he wrote \"Moonage Daydream\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=207}} Burretti did not appear on either track's recording.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=207}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=605}} Biographer [[Peter Doggett]] writes, the original version had a \"playful science-fiction-inspired chorus, two nondescript verses with a single memorable line, and an arrangement that not only racked his voice like a martyr under the Inquisition but virtually defined the word 'shambolic'.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=118}} According to biographer [[Nicholas Pegg]], the Corns' version lacks  the \"lightness of touch\" of the second.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} Like Doggett, Pegg criticises the recording's arrangement and Bowie's vocal, calling it a \"strained attempt\" at an American [[Rock and roll|rock'n'roll]] vocal, along with an additional \"come on, you mothers!\" lyric.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} According to [[Marc Spitz]], the Corns' version is melodically the same as the ''Ziggy'' version, but with a slightly different chorus.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} Doggett believes that had the track and \"Hang On to Yourself\" not been re-recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust'', they would have been forgotten.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=118}} Author Kevin Cann writes that once the lyrics were revised and \"given the Ziggy treatment\", it became a \"glittering glam gem\" in the context of the album.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=253}}\n\nBowie re-recorded \"Moonage Daydream\" on 12&nbsp;November 1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London for inclusion on ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}}{{sfn|Woodmansey|2017|pp=88, 114}} Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], the lineup consisted of Bowie's backing band known as [[the Spiders from Mars]]\u2014comprising guitarist [[Mick Ronson]], bassist [[Trevor Bolder]] and drummer [[Mick Woodmansey]].<ref name=\"Erlewine AllMusic\" /> The group recorded the track in two takes, as well as \"[[Soul Love (David Bowie song)|Soul Love]]\", \"[[Lady Stardust]]\" and a re-recording of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' track \"[[The Supermen]]\" during the session.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=231}} The re-recording, like its parent album, is a [[glam rock]] song<ref>{{cite web|title=Masterpiece Reviews: \"David Bowie \u2013 The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And

metal]].{{sfn|Perone|2007|p=28}} Doggett writes that after learning from the \"vocal agonies\" of the Corns' recording, the Spiders decided to record the song three semitones lower than before.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=119}} Ronson begins it on guitar with a D chord described as an \"avalanche\",{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=187}} a \"pile-driver\", and an \"opening thunderbolt\" that is Ronson's \"declaration of intent\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=119}} Pegg writes that the chord \"cuts across the fade-out\" of \"[[Soul Love (David Bowie song)|Soul Love]]\" taking the listener \"into the morass of sleazy sex and surreal science fiction that occupies the album's heart.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} After a short pause, Bowie begins his vocal, which Doggett believes sounds far better than the \"metallic rasp\" of his 1970 recordings.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=119}} Bowie plays a saxophone and a [[pennywhistle]] during Ronson's solo, which are inspired by [[the Hollywood Argyles]]' 1960 song \"Sho Know a Lot About Love\";{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=328}} Bowie recalled in 2003 that he thought the combination of sax and piccolo was \"a great thing to put in a rock song\".<ref name=\"NME\" /> Ronson's guitar solo was mostly improvised after Bowie had conveyed the mood he wanted to him.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=328}} Bowie later recalled in his 2002 book ''Moonage Daydream'':\n\n{{block quote|[I would] literally draw out on paper with a crayon or felt-tip pen the shape of a solo. The one in 'Moonage Daydream', for instance, started as a flat line that became a fat megaphone type shape, and ended as sprays of disassociated and broken lines. I'd read somewhere that [[Frank Zappa]] used a series of drawn symbols to explain to his musicians how he wanted the shape of a composition to sound. Mick could take something like that and actually bloody play it, bring it to life. Very impressive.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=328}}}}\n\nThe song's strings, arranged and orchestrated by Ronson,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=328}} appear at the return of the chorus, climaxing in a \"steep pizzicato descent.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=119}} They appear again during the fadeout, this time having a \"swirling phased\" effect that was Scott's idea during the mixing stage.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=328}} Doggett writes, \"Only in the final moments did Ronson's guitar provide the climactic release that the daydream demanded, continually returning to the same motifs as if in ecstatic spasm.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=119}}\n\n==Lyrics==\nAs the third track on the album, \"Moonage Daydream\" directly introduces the character of Ziggy Stardust,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} following \"[[Five Years (David Bowie song)|Five Years]]\" which describes an impending disaster that will result in Earth only having five years left and \"[[Soul Love (David Bowie song)|Soul Love]]\" in which numerous characters deal with love before the impending disaster.<ref>{{harvnb|Spitz|2009|p=187: \"Five Years\"}}; {{harvnb|Pegg|2016|p=445; \"Soul Love\"}}</ref> Once introduced, Ziggy proclaims himself \"an exotic hybrid of rock's past and mankind's future\": \"an alligator\" (strong and remorseless), \"a mama-papa\" (non-gender specific), \"the space invader\" (alien and phallic), \"a rock'n'rollin' bitch\" and a \"pink-monkey-bird\" (gay slang for a recipient of anal sex).{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=118}} Ziggy also praises the virtues of \"the church of man, love\" (or heard as \"the church of man-love\"); Pegg believes that this line is inspired in part by the proposed \"Church of God, Love and Man\" by philosopher [[Thomas Paine]], who Bowie often referenced indirectly (and directly on the 1990 [[Adrian Belew]] collaboration \"Pretty Pink Rose\").{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} Doggett believes that the \"carefree\" imagery Ziggy presents heightens the \"erotic fantasy\" of the chorus, described as \"a wet dream that was 'moonage' for the era of the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] missions\" and for the tradition of \"muse poetry\" by [[Robert Graves]], which is linked to \"ancient cults that worshipped the moon, accessing the imagination without involving the intellect.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=118}} Doggett continues that as philosopher [[Colin Wilson]] said in 1971, \"the moon goddess was the goddess of magic, of the subconscious, of poetic inspiration.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=118}} Hence, a \"moonage daydream\" might represent \"an ecstatic, instinctive path to creativity\", or nothing more than an homage to \"[[Marc Bolan]]'s brand of lyrical imagery.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=118}} Bowie used several Americanisms on the original version of the song, most of which he which retained on the re-recording, using abbreviations such as \"comin'\", \"'lectric\" and \"rock'n'rollin'\", as well as phrases such as \"busting up my brains\", \"lay the real thing on me\", \"freak out\" and \"far out\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} According to Pegg, there are several homages present\u2014including one to [[Iggy Pop]], whose lyric \"she got a TV eye on me\" turns into \"keep your 'lectric eye on me\", and one to [[Legendary Stardust Cowboy]], whose lyric \"I shot my space gun\" turns into \"put your ray gun to my head\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n[[File:Mick Ronson 1979.jpg|thumb|180px|alt=Mick Ronson playing guitar|[[Mick Ronson]]'s guitar work received unanimous praise from music critics, with most calling it the best aspect of the track.]]\nThe original version of \"Moonage Daydream\" by the short-lived band Arnold Corns was released in the UK by [[B&C Records]] as a single with \"Hang On to Yourself\" as the B-side in May 1971.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=216}}<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=''\"Moonage Daydream\"''|others=[[Arnold Corns|The Arnold Corns]]|year=1971|publisher=[[B&C Records]]|location=UK|type=Single liner notes|id=CB 149}}</ref> The re-recorded version was released as the third track on Bowie's fifth studio album ''The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars'', between \"Soul Love\" and \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\", on 16&nbsp;June 1972 by [[RCA Records]].<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1972|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SF 8287}}</ref> Discussing the song's placement in the album's track-listing, Pegg describes it as its \"keystone\" if one identifies the opening and closing tracks (\"Five Years\" and \"[[Rock 'n' Roll Suicide]]\", respectively) as the album's framework.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}}\n\n{{quote box|quote=When I walked into the control room and heard \"Moonage Daydream\" played back through the speakers for the first time I knew then we really had something special.

Daydream'''\" is a song by English singer-songwriter [[David Bowie]]. It was originally recorded in February 1971 at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London and released as a single by his short-lived band [[Arnold Corns]] in May 1971 on [[B&C Records]]. Bowie subsequently re-recorded the song later that year with his backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]]\u2014comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]\u2014for release on his 1972 album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''. The re-recording was co-produced by [[Ken Scott]] and recorded at [[Trident Studios]] in London in November 1971. On the album, the song directly introduces the character Ziggy Stardust, who describes himself as a [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] alien rock superstar who will save the Earth from the impending disaster described in the opening track \"[[Five Years (David Bowie song)|Five Years]]\". It features saxophone played by Bowie and a guitar solo and string arrangement by Ronson.\n\nSince its release, \"Moonage Daydream\" has received critical acclaim, with many deeming Ronson's guitar work its clear standout. Bolder, Woodmansey and Scott have called it the best song on the album; retrospectively, it has been named one of Bowie's greatest songs. He played it in concert throughout 1972\u201373 and on later tours. The ''Ziggy'' recording has since appeared on multiple [[compilation album]]s and in the 2014 film ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', while the Arnold Corns' recording has appeared on reissues of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' (1970) and ''Ziggy Stardust''. The ''Ziggy'' recording has been remastered multiple times, including in 2012, which was subsequently included as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set in 2015, along with the Arnold Corns' recording.\n\n==Composition and recording==\n\"Moonage Daydream\" was written during Bowie's US promotional tour in early February 1971.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} After the tour Bowie formed a short-lived band, [[Arnold Corns]], named after the [[Pink Floyd]] song \"[[Arnold Layne]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}} Led by Bowie, the band consisted of guitarist Mark Carr-Pritchard, bassist Peter DeSomogyi and drummer Tim Broadbent, who were known previously as a trio called Rungk.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}} Arnold Corns recorded \"Moonage Daydream\" and \"[[Hang On to Yourself]]\" on 25&nbsp;February 1971 at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=206\u2013207}}{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} Bowie later hired openly gay dress designer Freddie Burretti, for whom he wrote \"Moonage Daydream\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=207}} Burretti did not appear on either track's recording.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=207}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=605}} Biographer [[Peter Doggett]] writes, the original version had a \"playful science-fiction-inspired chorus, two nondescript verses with a single memorable line, and an arrangement that not only racked his voice like a martyr under the Inquisition but virtually defined the word 'shambolic'.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=118}} According to biographer [[Nicholas Pegg]], the Corns' version lacks  the \"lightness of touch\" of the second.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} Like Doggett, Pegg criticises the recording's arrangement and Bowie's vocal, calling it a \"strained attempt\" at an American [[Rock and roll|rock'n'roll]] vocal, along with an additional \"come on, you mothers!\" lyric.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} According to [[Marc Spitz]], the Corns' version is melodically the same as the ''Ziggy'' version, but with a slightly different chorus.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} Doggett believes that had the track and \"Hang On to Yourself\" not been re-recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust'', they would have been forgotten.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=118}} Author Kevin Cann writes that once the lyrics were revised and \"given the Ziggy treatment\", it became a \"glittering glam gem\" in the context of the album.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=253}}\n\nBowie re-recorded \"Moonage Daydream\" on 12&nbsp;November 1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London for inclusion on ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}}{{sfn|Woodmansey|2017|pp=88, 114}} Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], the lineup consisted of Bowie's backing band known as [[the Spiders from Mars]]\u2014comprising guitarist [[Mick Ronson]], bassist [[Trevor Bolder]] and drummer [[Mick Woodmansey]].<ref name=\"Erlewine AllMusic\" /> The group recorded the track in two takes, as well as \"[[Soul Love (David Bowie song)|Soul Love]]\", \"[[Lady Stardust]]\" and a re-recording of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' track \"[[The Supermen]]\" during the session.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=231}} The re-recording, like its parent album, is a [[glam rock]] song<ref>{{cite web|title=Masterpiece Reviews: \"David Bowie \u2013 The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And

metal]].{{sfn|Perone|2007|p=28}} Doggett writes that after learning from the \"vocal agonies\" of the Corns' recording, the Spiders decided to record the song three semitones lower than before.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=119}} Ronson begins it on guitar with a D chord described as an \"avalanche\",{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=187}} a \"pile-driver\", and an \"opening thunderbolt\" that is Ronson's \"declaration of intent\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=119}} Pegg writes that the chord \"cuts across the fade-out\" of \"[[Soul Love (David Bowie song)|Soul Love]]\" taking the listener \"into the morass of sleazy sex and surreal science fiction that occupies the album's heart.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} After a short pause, Bowie begins his vocal, which Doggett believes sounds far better than the \"metallic rasp\" of his 1970 recordings.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=119}} Bowie plays a saxophone and a [[pennywhistle]] during Ronson's solo, which are inspired by [[the Hollywood Argyles]]' 1960 song \"Sho Know a Lot About Love\";{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=328}} Bowie recalled in 2003 that he thought the combination of sax and piccolo was \"a great thing to put in a rock song\".<ref name=\"NME\" /> Ronson's guitar solo was mostly improvised after Bowie had conveyed the mood he wanted to him.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=328}} Bowie later recalled in his 2002 book ''Moonage Daydream'':\n\n{{block quote|[I would] literally draw out on paper with a crayon or felt-tip pen the shape of a solo. The one in 'Moonage Daydream', for instance, started as a flat line that became a fat megaphone type shape, and ended as sprays of disassociated and broken lines. I'd read somewhere that [[Frank Zappa]] used a series of drawn symbols to explain to his musicians how he wanted the shape of a composition to sound. Mick could take something like that and actually bloody play it, bring it to life. Very impressive.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=328}}}}\n\nThe song's strings, arranged and orchestrated by Ronson,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=328}} appear at the return of the chorus, climaxing in a \"steep pizzicato descent.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=119}} They appear again during the fadeout, this time having a \"swirling phased\" effect that was Scott's idea during the mixing stage.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=328}} Doggett writes, \"Only in the final moments did Ronson's guitar provide the climactic release that the daydream demanded, continually returning to the same motifs as if in ecstatic spasm.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=119}}\n\n==Lyrics==\nAs the third track on the album, \"Moonage Daydream\" directly introduces the character of Ziggy Stardust,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} following \"[[Five Years (David Bowie song)|Five Years]]\" which describes an impending disaster that will result in Earth only having five years left and \"[[Soul Love (David Bowie song)|Soul Love]]\" in which numerous characters deal with love before the impending disaster.<ref>{{harvnb|Spitz|2009|p=187: \"Five Years\"}}; {{harvnb|Pegg|2016|p=445; \"Soul Love\"}}</ref> Once introduced, Ziggy proclaims himself \"an exotic hybrid of rock's past and mankind's future\": \"an alligator\" (strong and remorseless), \"a mama-papa\" (non-gender specific), \"the space invader\" (alien and phallic), \"a rock'n'rollin' bitch\" and a \"pink-monkey-bird\" (gay slang for a recipient of anal sex).{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=118}} Ziggy also praises the virtues of \"the church of man, love\" (or heard as \"the church of man-love\"); Pegg believes that this line is inspired in part by the proposed \"Church of God, Love and Man\" by philosopher [[Thomas Paine]], who Bowie often referenced indirectly (and directly on the 1990 [[Adrian Belew]] collaboration \"Pretty Pink Rose\").{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} Doggett believes that the \"carefree\" imagery Ziggy presents heightens the \"erotic fantasy\" of the chorus, described as \"a wet dream that was 'moonage' for the era of the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] missions\" and for the tradition of \"muse poetry\" by [[Robert Graves]], which is linked to \"ancient cults that worshipped the moon, accessing the imagination without involving the intellect.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=118}} Doggett continues that as philosopher [[Colin Wilson]] said in 1971, \"the moon goddess was the goddess of magic, of the subconscious, of poetic inspiration.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=118}} Hence, a \"moonage daydream\" might represent \"an ecstatic, instinctive path to creativity\", or nothing more than an homage to \"[[Marc Bolan]]'s brand of lyrical imagery.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=118}} Bowie used several Americanisms on the original version of the song, most of which he which retained on the re-recording, using abbreviations such as \"comin'\", \"'lectric\" and \"rock'n'rollin'\", as well as phrases such as \"busting up my brains\", \"lay the real thing on me\", \"freak out\" and \"far out\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} According to Pegg, there are several homages present\u2014including one to [[Iggy Pop]], whose lyric \"she got a TV eye on me\" turns into \"keep your 'lectric eye on me\", and one to [[Legendary Stardust Cowboy]], whose lyric \"I shot my space gun\" turns into \"put your ray gun to my head\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n[[File:Mick Ronson 1979.jpg|thumb|180px|alt=Mick Ronson playing guitar|[[Mick Ronson]]'s guitar work received unanimous praise from music critics, with most calling it the best aspect of the track.]]\nThe original version of \"Moonage Daydream\" by the short-lived band Arnold Corns was released in the UK by [[B&C Records]] as a single with \"Hang On to Yourself\" as the B-side in May 1971.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=216}}<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=''\"Moonage Daydream\"''|others=[[Arnold Corns|The Arnold Corns]]|year=1971|publisher=[[B&C Records]]|location=UK|type=Single liner notes|id=CB 149}}</ref> The re-recorded version was released as the third track on Bowie's fifth studio album ''The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars'', between \"Soul Love\" and \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\", on 16&nbsp;June 1972 by [[RCA Records]].<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1972|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SF 8287}}</ref> Discussing the song's placement in the album's track-listing, Pegg describes it as its \"keystone\" if one identifies the opening and closing tracks (\"Five Years\" and \"[[Rock 'n' Roll Suicide]]\", respectively) as the album's framework.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}}\n\n{{quote box|quote=When I walked into the control room and heard \"Moonage Daydream\" played back through the speakers for the first time I knew then we really had something special.

He is the author of ''Remembering Vanessa,'' the first biography of actress [[Vanessa Howard]], published in the Spring 2014 issue of Screem. In 2017, he became a staff writer for Fangoria; in 2018, the magazine published his debut novel, [[Our Lady of the Inferno]], as the first entry in their \"FANGORIA Presents\" imprint. The book received an overwhelmingly positive critical response, and was named one of the ten best horror books of 2018 by [[Bloody Disgusting]]. Later that year, Fangoria's parent company, [[Cinestate]], announced that they would be adapting the book into a film with Fassel collaborating on the screenplay and serving as [[executive producer]]. In 2019, Fangoria announced that they would publish Fassel's second novel, ''Beasts of 42nd Street'', in 2020.\n\n==Early life==\n\nFassel was born in Houston, Texas, but spent his childhood between [[St. Louis, Missouri]] and [[Broken Arrow, Oklahoma]].<ref name=tulsa/><ref name=gavin/> He was raised [[Catholic]]; his mother's family coming from a line of [[Polish people|Poles]] and [[Jewish people|ethnic Jews]] who had converted.<ref name=five/><ref name=pop/><ref name=void>[https://www.longlivethevoid.com/news/prestonfasselintermd Coming Soon - Interview with Preston Fassel.

His work has appeared in [[Fangoria]], [[Rue Morgue (magazine)|Rue Morgue]], Screem magazine, and on Cinedump.com. He is the author of ''Remembering Vanessa,'' the first biography of actress [[Vanessa Howard]], published in the Spring 2014 issue of Screem. In 2017, he became a staff writer for Fangoria; in 2018, the magazine published his debut novel, [[Our Lady of the Inferno]], as the first entry in their \"FANGORIA Presents\" imprint. The book received an overwhelmingly positive critical response, and was named one of the ten best horror books of 2018 by [[Bloody Disgusting]]. Later that year, Fangoria's parent company, [[Cinestate]], announced that they would be adapting the book into a film with Fassel collaborating on the screenplay and serving as [[executive producer]]. In 2019, Fangoria announced that they would publish Fassel's second novel, ''Beasts of 42nd Street'', in 2020. \n\n==Early life==\n\nFassel was born in Houston, Texas, but spent his childhood between [[St. Louis, Missouri]] and [[Broken Arrow, Oklahoma]].<ref name=tulsa/><ref name=gavin/> He was raised [[Catholic]]; his mother's family coming from a line of [[Polish people|Poles]] and [[Jewish people|ethnic Jews]] who had converted.<ref name=five/><ref name=pop/><ref name=void>[https://www.longlivethevoid.com/news/prestonfasselintermd Coming Soon - Interview with Preston Fassel.
