Analysis of prevalence across sub-Saharan Africa between 2000 and 2017 found high variation in prevalence at a subnational level, with some countries demonstrating a more than five-fold difference in prevalence between different districts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dwyer-Lindgren|first=Laura|last2=Cork|first2=Michael A.|last3=Sligar|first3=Amber|last4=Steuben|first4=Krista M.|last5=Wilson|first5=Kate F.|last6=Provost|first6=Naomi R.|last7=Mayala|first7=Benjamin K.|last8=VanderHeide|first8=John D.|last9=Collison|first9=Michael L.|date=15 May 2019|title=Mapping HIV prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa between 2000 and 2017|journal=Nature|volume=570|issue=7760|pages=189\u2013193|language=en|doi=10.1038/s41586-019-1200-9|pmid=31092927|pmc=6601349|issn=0028-0836|bibcode=2019Natur.570..189D}}</ref>\n\n[[Eastern Africa]] also experiences relatively high levels of prevalence with estimates above 10% in some countries, although there are signs that the pandemic is declining in this region. [[West Africa]] on the other hand has been much less affected by the pandemic.\nSeveral countries reportedly have prevalence rates around 2 to 3%, and no country has rates above 10%. In Nigeria and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, two of the region's most populous countries, between 5 and 7% of adults are reported to carry the virus.\n\nAcross Sub-Saharan Africa, more women are infected with HIV than men, with 13 women infected for every 10 infected men. This gender gap continues to grow. Throughout the region, women are being infected with HIV at earlier ages than men. The differences in infection levels between women and men are most pronounced among young people (aged 15\u201324 years). In this age group, there are 36 women infected with HIV for every 10 men.

Due to a lack of testing, a shortage in antenatal therapies and through the feeding of contaminated breast milk, 590,000 infants born in developing countries are infected with HIV-1 per year. In 2000, the [[WHO|World Health Organization]] estimated that 25% of the units of blood transfused in Africa were not tested for HIV, and that 10% of HIV infections in Africa were transmitted via blood.\n\nPoor economic conditions (leading to the use of dirty needles in healthcare clinics) and lack of [[sex education]] contribute to high rates of infection. In some African countries, 25% or more of the working adult population is HIV-positive. Poor economic conditions caused by slow onset-emergencies, such as drought, or rapid onset natural disasters and conflict can result in young women and girls being forced into using sex as a survival strategy.<ref name=\"odi.org.uk\">Samuels, Fiona (2009) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2645&title=hiv-aids-emergencies HIV and emergencies: one size does not fit all] London: Overseas Development Institute</ref> Worse still, research indicates that as emergencies, such as drought, take their toll and the number of potential 'clients' decreases, women are forced by clients to accept greater risks, such as not using contraceptives.<ref name=\"odi.org.uk\" />\n\n[[AIDS denialism|AIDS-denialist]] policies have impeded the creation of effective programs for distribution of antiretroviral drugs.

However, due to the large populations of many East Asian nations, this low national HIV prevalence still means that large numbers of people are infected with HIV.  The picture in this region is dominated by China. Much of the current spread of HIV in China is through injecting drug use and paid sex. In China, the number was estimated at between 430,000 and 1.5 million by independent researchers, with some estimates going much higher.\n\nIn the rural areas of China, where large numbers of farmers, especially in [[Henan]] province, participated in unclean [[blood transfusion]]s; estimates of those infected are in the tens of thousands. In Japan, just over half of [[HIV/AIDS in Japan|HIV/AIDS cases]] are officially recorded as occurring amongst [[homosexuality|homosexual]] men, with the remainder occurring amongst heterosexuals and also via [[drug abuse]], [[perinatal|in the womb]] or unknown means.\n\nIn East Asia, men who have sex with men account for 18% of new HIV/AIDS cases and are therefore a key affected group along with sex workers and their clients who makeup 29% of new cases. This is also a noteworthy aspect because men who have sex with men had a prevalence of at least 5% or higher in countries in Asia and Pacific.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-around-world/asia-pacific/overview|title=HIV and AIDS in Asia & the Pacific regional overview {{!}} Avert|website=avert.org|access-date=19 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Americas===\n\n====Caribbean====\n{{Main|HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean}}\nThe Caribbean is the second-most affected region in the world.<ref name=\"aidsdayrpt2011\" /> Among adults aged 15\u201344, AIDS has become the leading cause of death.

Research presented at the 12th Annual Retrovirus Conference in [[Boston]] in February 2005 concluded that using crystal meth or [[cocaine]] is the biggest single risk factor for becoming HIV+ among US gay men, contributing 29% of the overall risk of becoming positive and 28% of the overall risk of being the receptive partner in [[anal sex]].<ref name=\"lifeormeth.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lifeormeth.com/ |title=Life or Meth |accessdate=27 December 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition, several renowned clinical psychologists now cite methamphetamine as the biggest problem facing gay men today, including Michael Majeski, who believes meth is the catalyst for at least 80% of seroconversions currently occurring across the United States, and Tony Zimbardi, who calls methamphetamine the number one cause of HIV transmission, and says that high rates of new HIV infection are not being found among non-crystal users. In addition, various HIV and STD clinics across the United States report anecdotal evidence that 75% of new HIV seroconversions they deal with are methamphetamine-related; indeed, in [[Los Angeles]], methamphetamine is regarded as the main cause of HIV [[seroconversion]] among gay men in their late thirties.<ref name=\"lifeormeth.com\" /> The chemical \"methamphetamine\", in and of itself, cannot infect someone with HIV.\n\n====Canada====\n\nIn 2016, there were approximately 63,100 people living with HIV/AIDS in Canada.<ref name=\"The epidemiology of HIV in Canada\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.catie.ca/en/fact-sheets/epidemiology/epidemiology-hiv-canada|title=The epidemiology of HIV in Canada|publisher=CATIE|date=2018|access-date=18 January 2020}}</ref> It was estimated that 9090 persons were living with undiagnosed HIV at the end of 2016.<ref name=\"The epidemiology of HIV in Canada\"/>\n[[Mortality rate|Mortality]] has decreased due to medical advances against HIV/AIDS, especially [[Antiretroviral drug#Combination therapy|highly active antiretroviral therapy]] (HAART). HIV/AIDS prevalence is increasing most rapidly amongst [[aboriginal Canadians]], with 11.3% of new infections in 2016.<ref name=\"The epidemiology of HIV in Canada\"/>\n\n===Eastern Europe and Central Asia===\n{{Main|HIV/AIDS in Eastern Europe and Central Asia}}\nThere is growing concern about a rapidly growing epidemic in [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Central Asia]], where an estimated 1.23\u20133.7 million people were infected as of December 2011, though the adult (15\u201349) prevalence rate is low (1.1%). The rate of HIV infections began to grow rapidly from the mid-1990s, due to social and economic collapse, increased levels of intravenous drug use and increased numbers of prostitutes. By 2010 the number of reported cases in [[Russia]] was over 450,000 according to the [[World Health Organization]], up from 15,000 in 1995 and 190,000 in 2002; some estimates claim the real number is up to eight times higher, well over 2 million. There are predictions that the infection rate in Russia will continue to rise quickly, since education there about AIDS is almost non-existent.<ref>Center for Strategic and International Studies. http://csis.org/program/hivaids</ref>\n\n[[HIV/AIDS in Ukraine|Ukraine]] and [[HIV/AIDS in Europe#Estonia|Estonia]] also have growing numbers of infected people, with estimates of 240,000 and 7,400 respectively in 2018. Also, transmission of HIV is increasing through sexual contact and drug use among the young (<30 years). Indeed, over 84% of current AIDS cases in this region occur in non-drug-using heterosexuals less than 26 years of age.\n\n===Western Europe===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}\n{{Main|HIV/AIDS in Western Europe}}\nIn most countries of Western Europe, AIDS cases have fallen to levels not seen since the original outbreak; many attribute this trend to aggressive educational campaigns, screening of blood transfusions and increased use of condoms. Also, the death rate from AIDS in Western Europe has fallen sharply, as new AIDS therapies have proven to be an effective (though expensive) means of suppressing HIV.\n\nIn this area, the routes of transmission of HIV is diverse, including paid sex, injecting drug use, mother to child, male with male sex and heterosexual sex.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} However, many new infections in this region occur through contact with HIV-infected individuals from other regions. The adult (15\u201349) prevalence in this region is 0.3% with between 570,000 and 890,000 people currently infected with HIV. Due to the availability of antiretroviral therapy, AIDS deaths have stayed low since the lows of the late 1990s. However, in some countries, a large share of HIV infections remain undiagnosed and there is worrying evidence of antiretroviral drug resistance among some newly HIV-infected individuals in this region.\n\n===Oceania===\n{{Main|HIV/AIDS in Australia|HIV/AIDS in New Zealand|HIV/AIDS in Papua New Guinea}}\nThere is a very large range of national situations regarding AIDS and HIV in this region. This is due in part to the large distances between the islands of Oceania. The wide range of development in the region also plays an important role. The prevalence is estimated at between 0.2% and 0.7%, with between 45,000 and 120,000 adults and children currently infected with HIV.\n\nPapua New Guinea has one of the most serious AIDS epidemics in the region. According to UNAIDS, HIV cases in the country have been increasing at a rate of 30 percent annually since 1997, and the country's HIV prevalence rate in late 2006 was 1.3%.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/asia/papua_new_guinea_profile.pdf Health Profile: Papua New Guinea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214223546/http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/asia/papua_new_guinea_profile.pdf |date=14 February 2009 }}.

[[West Africa]] on the other hand has been much less affected by the pandemic.\nSeveral countries reportedly have prevalence rates around 2 to 3%, and no country has rates above 10%. In Nigeria and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, two of the region's most populous countries, between 5 and 7% of adults are reported to carry the virus.\n\nAcross Sub-Saharan Africa, more women are infected with HIV than men, with 13 women infected for every 10 infected men. This gender gap continues to grow. Throughout the region, women are being infected with HIV at earlier ages than men. The differences in infection levels between women and men are most pronounced among young people (aged 15\u201324 years). In this age group, there are 36 women infected with HIV for every 10 men.

Due to a lack of testing, a shortage in antenatal therapies and through the feeding of contaminated breast milk, 590,000 infants born in developing countries are infected with HIV-1 per year. In 2000, the [[WHO|World Health Organization]] estimated that 25% of the units of blood transfused in Africa were not tested for HIV, and that 10% of HIV infections in Africa were transmitted via blood.\n\nPoor economic conditions (leading to the use of dirty needles in healthcare clinics) and lack of [[sex education]] contribute to high rates of infection. In some African countries, 25% or more of the working adult population is HIV-positive. Poor economic conditions caused by slow onset-emergencies, such as drought, or rapid onset natural disasters and conflict can result in young women and girls being forced into using sex as a survival strategy.<ref name=\"odi.org.uk\">Samuels, Fiona (2009) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2645&title=hiv-aids-emergencies HIV and emergencies: one size does not fit all] London: Overseas Development Institute</ref> Worse still, research indicates that as emergencies, such as drought, take their toll and the number of potential 'clients' decreases, women are forced by clients to accept greater risks, such as not using contraceptives.<ref name=\"odi.org.uk\" />\n\n[[AIDS denialism|AIDS-denialist]] policies have impeded the creation of effective programs for distribution of antiretroviral drugs.

The picture in this region is dominated by China. Much of the current spread of HIV in China is through injecting drug use and paid sex. In China, the number was estimated at between 430,000 and 1.5 million by independent researchers, with some estimates going much higher.\n\nIn the rural areas of China, where large numbers of farmers, especially in [[Henan]] province, participated in unclean [[blood transfusion]]s; estimates of those infected are in the tens of thousands. In Japan, just over half of [[HIV/AIDS in Japan|HIV/AIDS cases]] are officially recorded as occurring amongst [[homosexuality|homosexual]] men, with the remainder occurring amongst heterosexuals and also via [[drug abuse]], [[perinatal|in the womb]] or unknown means.\n\nIn East Asia, men who have sex with men account for 18% of new HIV/AIDS cases and are therefore a key affected group along with sex workers and their clients who makeup 29% of new cases. This is also a noteworthy aspect because men who have sex with men had a prevalence of at least 5% or higher in countries in Asia and Pacific.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-around-world/asia-pacific/overview|title=HIV and AIDS in Asia & the Pacific regional overview {{!}} Avert|website=avert.org|access-date=19 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Americas===\n\n====Caribbean====\n{{Main|HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean}}\nThe Caribbean is the second-most affected region in the world.<ref name=\"aidsdayrpt2011\" /> Among adults aged 15\u201344, AIDS has become the leading cause of death.

This rate is comparable to what is seen in west Africa, and is considered a severe epidemic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pri.org/stories/health/aids-epidemic-in-washington-dc1819.html|title=AIDS epidemic in Washington, DC|author=|date=|website=pri.org|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States in particular, a new wave of infection is being blamed on the use of [[methamphetamine]], known as crystal meth. Research presented at the 12th Annual Retrovirus Conference in [[Boston]] in February 2005 concluded that using crystal meth or [[cocaine]] is the biggest single risk factor for becoming HIV+ among US gay men, contributing 29% of the overall risk of becoming positive and 28% of the overall risk of being the receptive partner in [[anal sex]].<ref name=\"lifeormeth.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lifeormeth.com/ |title=Life or Meth |accessdate=27 December 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition, several renowned clinical psychologists now cite methamphetamine as the biggest problem facing gay men today, including Michael Majeski, who believes meth is the catalyst for at least 80% of seroconversions currently occurring across the United States, and Tony Zimbardi, who calls methamphetamine the number one cause of HIV transmission, and says that high rates of new HIV infection are not being found among non-crystal users. In addition, various HIV and STD clinics across the United States report anecdotal evidence that 75% of new HIV seroconversions they deal with are methamphetamine-related; indeed, in [[Los Angeles]], methamphetamine is regarded as the main cause of HIV [[seroconversion]] among gay men in their late thirties.<ref name=\"lifeormeth.com\" /> The chemical \"methamphetamine\", in and of itself, cannot infect someone with HIV.\n\n====Canada====\n\nIn 2016, there were approximately 63,100 people living with HIV/AIDS in Canada.<ref name=\"The epidemiology of HIV in Canada\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.catie.ca/en/fact-sheets/epidemiology/epidemiology-hiv-canada|title=The epidemiology of HIV in Canada|publisher=CATIE|date=2018|access-date=18 January 2020}}</ref> It was estimated that 9090 persons were living with undiagnosed HIV at the end of 2016.<ref name=\"The epidemiology of HIV in Canada\"/>\n[[Mortality rate|Mortality]] has decreased due to medical advances against HIV/AIDS, especially [[Antiretroviral drug#Combination therapy|highly active antiretroviral therapy]] (HAART). HIV/AIDS prevalence is increasing most rapidly amongst [[aboriginal Canadians]], with 11.3% of new infections in 2016.<ref name=\"The epidemiology of HIV in Canada\"/>\n\n===Eastern Europe and Central Asia===\n{{Main|HIV/AIDS in Eastern Europe and Central Asia}}\nThere is growing concern about a rapidly growing epidemic in [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Central Asia]], where an estimated 1.23\u20133.7 million people were infected as of December 2011, though the adult (15\u201349) prevalence rate is low (1.1%). The rate of HIV infections began to grow rapidly from the mid-1990s, due to social and economic collapse, increased levels of intravenous drug use and increased numbers of prostitutes. By 2010 the number of reported cases in [[Russia]] was over 450,000 according to the [[World Health Organization]], up from 15,000 in 1995 and 190,000 in 2002; some estimates claim the real number is up to eight times higher, well over 2 million. There are predictions that the infection rate in Russia will continue to rise quickly, since education there about AIDS is almost non-existent.<ref>Center for Strategic and International Studies. http://csis.org/program/hivaids</ref>\n\n[[HIV/AIDS in Ukraine|Ukraine]] and [[HIV/AIDS in Europe#Estonia|Estonia]] also have growing numbers of infected people, with estimates of 240,000 and 7,400 respectively in 2018. Also, transmission of HIV is increasing through sexual contact and drug use among the young (<30 years). Indeed, over 84% of current AIDS cases in this region occur in non-drug-using heterosexuals less than 26 years of age.\n\n===Western Europe===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}\n{{Main|HIV/AIDS in Western Europe}}\nIn most countries of Western Europe, AIDS cases have fallen to levels not seen since the original outbreak; many attribute this trend to aggressive educational campaigns, screening of blood transfusions and increased use of condoms. Also, the death rate from AIDS in Western Europe has fallen sharply, as new AIDS therapies have proven to be an effective (though expensive) means of suppressing HIV.\n\nIn this area, the routes of transmission of HIV is diverse, including paid sex, injecting drug use, mother to child, male with male sex and heterosexual sex.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} However, many new infections in this region occur through contact with HIV-infected individuals from other regions. The adult (15\u201349) prevalence in this region is 0.3% with between 570,000 and 890,000 people currently infected with HIV. Due to the availability of antiretroviral therapy, AIDS deaths have stayed low since the lows of the late 1990s. However, in some countries, a large share of HIV infections remain undiagnosed and there is worrying evidence of antiretroviral drug resistance among some newly HIV-infected individuals in this region.\n\n===Oceania===\n{{Main|HIV/AIDS in Australia|HIV/AIDS in New Zealand|HIV/AIDS in Papua New Guinea}}\nThere is a very large range of national situations regarding AIDS and HIV in this region. This is due in part to the large distances between the islands of Oceania. The wide range of development in the region also plays an important role. The prevalence is estimated at between 0.2% and 0.7%, with between 45,000 and 120,000 adults and children currently infected with HIV.\n\nPapua New Guinea has one of the most serious AIDS epidemics in the region. According to UNAIDS, HIV cases in the country have been increasing at a rate of 30 percent annually since 1997, and the country's HIV prevalence rate in late 2006 was 1.3%.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/asia/papua_new_guinea_profile.pdf Health Profile: Papua New Guinea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214223546/http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/asia/papua_new_guinea_profile.pdf |date=14 February 2009 }}.
