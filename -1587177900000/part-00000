It was the second of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in warfare, the first being [[Little Boy]], and its detonation marked the third nuclear explosion in history. It was built by scientists and engineers at [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] using [[plutonium]] from the [[Hanford Site]], and it was dropped from the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] ''[[Bockscar]]'' piloted by Major [[Charles Sweeney]].\n \nThe name Fat Man refers to the early design of the bomb because it had a wide, round shape; it was also known as the Mark III. Fat Man was an [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]] with a solid plutonium core. The first of that type to be detonated was the Gadget in the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity nuclear test]] less than a month earlier on 16 July at the [[Holloman Air Force Base|Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range]] in New Mexico. Two more were detonated during the [[Operation Crossroads]] nuclear tests at [[Bikini Atoll]] in 1946, and some 120 were produced between 1947 and 1949, when it was superseded by the [[Mark 4 nuclear bomb]]. The Fat Man was retired in 1950.\n\n==Early decisions==\n[[Robert Oppenheimer]] held conferences in Chicago in June 1942, prior to the Army taking over wartime atomic research, and in Berkeley, California, in July, at which various engineers and physicists discussed nuclear bomb design issues. They chose a [[Gun-type fission weapon|gun-type]] design in which two sub-critical masses would be brought together by firing a \"bullet\" into a \"target\".{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=42\u201344}} [[Richard C. Tolman]] suggested an [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]], but the proposal attracted little interest.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=55}}\n\nThe feasibility of a plutonium bomb was questioned in 1942. [[Wallace Akers]], the director of the British \"[[Tube Alloys]]\" project, told [[James Bryant Conant]] on 14 November that [[James Chadwick]] had \"concluded that plutonium might not be a practical fissionable material for weapons because of impurities.\"{{sfn|Nichols|1987|p=64}} Conant consulted [[Ernest Lawrence]] and [[Arthur Compton]], who acknowledged that their scientists at Berkeley and Chicago respectively knew about the problem, but they could offer no ready solution. Conant informed [[Manhattan Project]] director Brigadier General [[Leslie R. Groves Jr.]], who in turn assembled a special committee consisting of Lawrence, Compton, Oppenheimer, and McMillan to examine the issue. The committee concluded that any problems could be overcome simply by requiring higher purity.{{sfn|Nichols|1987|pp=64\u201365}}\n\nOppenheimer reviewed his options in early 1943 and gave priority to the gun-type weapon,{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=55}} but he created the E-5 Group at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] under [[Seth Neddermeyer]] to investigate implosion as a hedge against the threat of pre-detonation. Implosion-type bombs were determined to be significantly more efficient in terms of explosive yield per unit mass of fissile material in the bomb, because compressed fissile materials react more rapidly and therefore more completely. Nonetheless, it was decided that the plutonium gun would receive the bulk of the research effort, since it was the project with the least amount of uncertainty involved. It was assumed that the uranium gun-type bomb could be easily adapted from it.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=87}}\n\n==Naming==\nThe gun-type and implosion-type designs were codenamed \"[[Thin Man (nuclear bomb)|Thin Man]]\" and \"Fat Man\" respectively. These code names were created by [[Robert Serber]], a former student of Oppenheimer's who worked on the Manhattan Project. He chose them based on their design shapes; the Thin Man was a very long device, and the name came from the [[Dashiell Hammett]] detective novel ''[[The Thin Man]]'' and [[The Thin Man (film)|series of movies]]. The Fat Man was round and fat and was named after [[Sydney Greenstreet]]'s character in ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]''. [[Little Boy]] came last as a variation of Thin Man.{{sfn|Serber|Crease|1998|p=104}}\n\n==Development==\nNeddermeyer discarded Serber and Tolman's initial concept of implosion as assembling a series of pieces in favor of one in which a hollow sphere was imploded by an explosive shell. He was assisted in this work by [[Hugh Bradner]], [[Charles Critchfield]], and John Streib. [[L.T.E. Thompson|L. T. E. Thompson]] was brought in as a consultant, and discussed the problem with Neddermeyer in June 1943. Thompson was skeptical that an implosion could be made sufficiently symmetric. Oppenheimer arranged for Neddermeyer and [[Edwin McMillan]] to visit the [[National Defense Research Committee]]'s Explosives Research Laboratory near the [[Experimental Mine, U.S. Bureau of Mines|laboratories]] of the [[United States Bureau of Mines|Bureau of Mines]] in [[Bruceton, Pennsylvania]] (a [[Pittsburgh]] suburb), where they spoke to [[George Kistiakowsky]] and his team. But Neddermeyer's efforts in July and August at imploding tubes to produce cylinders tended to produce objects that resembled rocks. Neddermeyer was the only person who believed that implosion was practical, and only his enthusiasm kept the project alive.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=86\u201390}}\n\n[[File:AirForceMuseum FatManReplica.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|left|alt=Fat Man Replica|Replica mockup of a ''Fat Man'' displayed in the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]], beside the ''[[Bockscar]]'' B-29 that dropped the original device \u2013 black liquid asphalt sealant was sprayed over the original bomb casing's seams, simulated on the mockup.]]\nOppenheimer brought [[John von Neumann]] to Los Alamos in September 1943 to take a fresh look at implosion. After reviewing Neddermeyer's studies, and discussing the matter with [[Edward Teller]], von Neumann suggested the use of high explosives in [[shaped charge]]s to implode a sphere, which he showed could not only result in a faster assembly of [[fissile]] material than was possible with the gun method, but which could greatly reduce the amount of material required, because of the resulting higher density.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=130\u2013133}} The idea that, under such pressures, the plutonium metal itself would be compressed came from Teller, whose knowledge of how dense metals behaved under heavy pressure was influenced by his pre-war theoretical studies of the [[Earth's core]] with [[George Gamow]].{{sfn|Teller|2001|pp=174\u2013176}} The prospect of more-efficient nuclear weapons impressed Oppenheimer, Teller, and [[Hans Bethe]], but they decided that an expert on explosives would be required. Kistiakowsky's name was immediately suggested, and Kistiakowsky was brought into the project as a consultant in October 1943.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=130\u2013133}}\n \nThe implosion project remained a backup until April 1944, when experiments by [[Emilio G. Segr\u00e8]] and his P-5 Group at Los Alamos on the newly reactor-produced [[plutonium]] from the [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]] at [[Clinton Engineer Works|Oak Ridge]] and the [[B Reactor]] at the [[Hanford site]] showed that it contained impurities in the form of the [[isotope]] [[plutonium-240]]. This has a far higher spontaneous fission rate and radioactivity than [[plutonium-239]]. The [[cyclotron]]-produced isotopes, on which the original measurements had been made, held much lower traces of plutonium-240. Its inclusion in reactor-bred plutonium appeared unavoidable. This meant that the spontaneous fission rate of the reactor plutonium was so high that it would be highly likely that it would [[predetonation|predetonate]] and blow itself apart during the initial formation of a critical mass.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=228}} The distance required to accelerate the plutonium to speeds where predetonation would be less likely would need a gun barrel too long for any existing or planned bomber. The only way to use plutonium in a workable bomb was therefore implosion.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=240\u2013244}}\n\n[[File:X-Ray-Image-HE-Lens-Test-Shot.gif|thumb|Flash X-Ray images of the converging shock waves formed during a test of the high-explosive lens system.]]\nThe impracticability of a gun-type bomb using plutonium was agreed at a meeting in Los Alamos on 17 July 1944. All gun-type work in the [[Manhattan Project]] was directed at the Little Boy, enriched-uranium gun design, and the Los Alamos Laboratory was reorganized, with almost all of the research focused on the problems of implosion for the Fat Man bomb.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=240\u2013244}} The idea of using shaped charges as three-dimensional [[explosive lens]]es came from [[James L. Tuck]], and was developed by von Neumann.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=163}} To overcome the difficulty of synchronizing multiple detonations, [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] and [[Lawrence H. Johnston|Lawrence Johnston]] invented [[exploding-bridgewire detonator]]s to replace the less precise [[primacord]] detonation system.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=163}} [[Robert Christy]] is credited with doing the calculations that showed how a solid subcritical sphere of plutonium could be compressed to a critical state, greatly simplifying the task, since earlier efforts had attempted the more-difficult compression of a hollow spherical shell.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=270\u2013271}} After Christy's report, the solid-plutonium core weapon was referred to as the \"[[pit (nuclear weapon)#Christy pits|Christy Gadget]]\".{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=293, 307\u2013308}}\n \nThe task of the [[metallurgist]]s was to determine how to cast plutonium into a sphere. The difficulties became apparent when attempts to measure the density of plutonium gave inconsistent results. At first contamination was believed to be the cause, but it was soon determined that there were multiple [[allotropes of plutonium]].{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=244\u2013245}} The brittle \u03b1 phase that exists at room temperature changes to the plastic \u03b2 phase at higher temperatures. Attention then shifted to the even more malleable \u03b4 phase that normally exists in the {{convert|300|-|450|\u00b0C|F|round=5}} range. It was found that this was stable at room temperature when alloyed with aluminum, but aluminum emits neutrons when bombarded with [[alpha particles]], which would exacerbate the pre-ignition problem. The metallurgists then hit upon a [[plutonium\u2013gallium alloy]], which stabilized the \u03b4 phase and could be [[hot pressing|hot pressed]] into the desired spherical shape. As plutonium was found to corrode readily, the sphere was coated with nickel.{{sfn|Baker|Hecker|Harbur|1983|pp=144\u2013145}}\n\n[[File:Fat Man test unit being raised from the pit into the bomb bay of a B-29.jpg|thumb|left|A [[pumpkin bomb]] (Fat Man test unit) being raised from the pit into the bomb bay of a B-29 for bombing practice during the weeks before the attack on Nagasaki.]]\nThe size of the bomb was constrained by the available aircraft. The only Allied aircraft considered capable of carrying the Fat Man without major modification were the British [[Avro Lancaster]] and the American [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]].{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=380\u2013383}}{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=119\u2013120}}{{sfn|Groves|1962|p=254}} At the time, the B-29 represented the epitome of bomber technology with significant advantages in [[MTOW]], range, speed, flight ceiling, and survivability. Without the availability of the B-29, dropping the bomb would likely have been impossible. However, this still constrained the bomb to a maximum length of {{convert|11|ft}}, width of {{convert|5|ft}} and weight of {{convert|20000|lb}}. Removing the bomb rails allowed a maximum width of {{convert|5.5|ft}}.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=119\u2013120}}\n\nDrop tests began in March 1944, and resulted in modifications to the [[Silverplate]] aircraft due to the weight of the bomb.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=8\u201310}} High-speed photographs revealed that the tail fins folded under the pressure, resulting in an erratic descent. Various combinations of stabilizer boxes and fins were tested on the Fat Man shape to eliminate its persistent wobble until an arrangement dubbed a \"California Parachute\", a cubical open-rear tail box outer surface with eight radial fins inside of it, four angled at 45\u00b0 and four perpendicular to the line of fall holding the outer square-fin box to the bomb's rear end, was approved.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=380\u2013383}} In drop tests in early weeks, the Fat Man missed its target by an average of {{convert|1,857|ft|m|0}}, but this was halved by June as the bombardiers became more proficient with it.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=131}}\n\nThe early Y-1222 model Fat Man was assembled with some 1,500 bolts.{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|p=52}}{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=121}} This was superseded by the Y-1291 design in December 1944.

There were also the Y-1563 and Y-1564, which were practice bombs with no detonators at all.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=127}} The final wartime Y-1561 design was assembled with just 90 bolts.{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|p=52}}\nOn 16 July 1945, a Y-1561 model Fat Man, known as the Gadget, was detonated in a [[nuclear weapons testing|test explosion]] at a remote site in [[New Mexico]], known as the \"[[Trinity test|Trinity]]\" test.

The first was known as ''Gilda'' after [[Rita Hayworth]]'s character in the 1946 movie [[Gilda]], and it was dropped by the B-29 ''[[Big Stink (B-29)|Dave's Dream]]''; it missed its aim point by {{convert|710|yd}}. The second bomb was nicknamed ''Helen of Bikini'' and was placed without its tail fin assembly in a steel caisson made from a submarine's conning tower; it was detonated {{convert|90|ft|m|0}} beneath the landing craft ''[[USS LSM-60]]''. The two weapons yielded about {{convert|23|kt(TNT)}} each.{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|pp=84\u201385}}\n\nThe Los Alamos Laboratory and the Army Air Forces had already commenced work on improving the design. The [[North American B-45 Tornado]], [[Convair XB-46]], [[Martin XB-48]], and [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]] bombers had bomb bays sized to carry the [[Grand Slam (bomb)|Grand Slam]], which was much longer but not as wide as the Fat Man. The only American bombers that could carry the Fat Man were the B-29 and the [[Convair B-36]]. In November 1945, the Army Air Forces asked Los Alamos for 200 Fat Man bombs, but there were only two sets of plutonium cores and high-explosive assemblies at the time. The Army Air Forces wanted improvements to the design to make it easier to manufacture, assemble, handle, transport, and stockpile. The wartime [[Project W-47]] was continued, and drop tests resumed in January 1946.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=137\u2013142}}\n\nThe Mark III Mod 0 Fat Man was ordered into production in mid-1946. High explosives were manufactured by the [[Salt Wells Pilot Plant]], which had been established by the Manhattan Project as part of [[Project Camel]], and a new plant was established at the [[Iowa Army Ammunition Plant]]. Mechanical components were made or procured by the [[Rock Island Arsenal]]; electrical and mechanical components for about 50 bombs were stockpiled at Kirtland Army Air Field by August 1946, but only nine plutonium cores were available. Production of the Mod 0 ended in December 1948, by which time there were still only 53 cores available. It was replaced by improved versions known as Mods 1 and 2 which contained a number of minor changes, the most important of which was that they did not charge the X-Unit firing system's capacitors until released from the aircraft. The Mod 0s were withdrawn from service between March and July 1949, and by October they had all been rebuilt as Mods 1 and 2.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=142\u2013145}} Some 120 Mark III Fat Man units were added to the stockpile between 1947 and 1949{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|p=87}} when it was superseded by the [[Mark 4 nuclear bomb]].{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=143}} The Mark III Fat Man was retired in 1950.{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|p=87}}{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=150}}\n\nA nuclear strike would have been a formidable undertaking in the post-war 1940s due to the limitations of the Mark III Fat Man. The lead-acid batteries which powered the fuzing system remained charged for only 36 hours, after which they needed to be recharged. To do this meant disassembling the bomb, and recharging took 72 hours. The batteries had to be removed in any case after nine days or they corroded. The plutonium core could not be left in for much longer, because its heat damaged the high explosives. Replacing the core also required the bomb to be completely disassembled and reassembled. This required about 40 to 50 men and took between 56 and 72 hours, depending on the skill of the bomb assembly team, and the [[Armed Forces Special Weapons Project]] had only three teams in June 1948. The only aircraft capable of carrying the bomb were Silverplate B-29s, and the only group equipped with them was the 509th Bombardment Group at [[Walker Air Force Base]] in [[Roswell, New Mexico]]. They would first have to fly to [[Sandia Base]] to collect the bombs, and then to an overseas base from which a strike could be mounted.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=147\u2013149}}\n\nThe Soviet Union's first nuclear weapon was based closely on Fat Man's design thanks to spies [[Klaus Fuchs]], [[Theodore Hall]], and [[David Greenglass]], who provided them with secret information concerning the Manhattan Project and Fat Man.

It was the second of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in warfare, the first being [[Little Boy]], and its detonation marked the third nuclear explosion in history. It was built by scientists and engineers at [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] using [[plutonium]] from the [[Hanford Site]], and it was dropped from the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] ''[[Bockscar]]'' piloted by Major [[Charles Sweeney]].\n \nThe name Fat Man refers to the early design of the bomb because it had a wide, round shape; it was also known as the Mark III. Fat Man was an [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]] with a solid plutonium core. The first of that type to be detonated was the Gadget in the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity nuclear test]] less than a month earlier on 16 July at the [[Holloman Air Force Base|Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range]] in New Mexico. Two more were detonated during the [[Operation Crossroads]] nuclear tests at [[Bikini Atoll]] in 1946, and some 120 were produced between 1947 and 1949, when it was superseded by the [[Mark 4 nuclear bomb]]. The Fat Man was retired in 1950.\n\n==Early decisions==\n[[Robert Oppenheimer]] held conferences in Chicago in June 1942, prior to the Army taking over wartime atomic research, and in Berkeley, California, in July, at which various engineers and physicists discussed nuclear bomb design issues. They chose a [[Gun-type fission weapon|gun-type]] design in which two sub-critical masses would be brought together by firing a \"bullet\" into a \"target\".{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=42\u201344}} [[Richard C. Tolman]] suggested an [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]], but the proposal attracted little interest.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=55}}\n\nThe feasibility of a plutonium bomb was questioned in 1942. [[Wallace Akers]], the director of the British \"[[Tube Alloys]]\" project, told [[James Bryant Conant]] on 14 November that [[James Chadwick]] had \"concluded that plutonium might not be a practical fissionable material for weapons because of impurities.\"{{sfn|Nichols|1987|p=64}} Conant consulted [[Ernest Lawrence]] and [[Arthur Compton]], who acknowledged that their scientists at Berkeley and Chicago respectively knew about the problem, but they could offer no ready solution. Conant informed [[Manhattan Project]] director Brigadier General [[Leslie R. Groves Jr.]], who in turn assembled a special committee consisting of Lawrence, Compton, Oppenheimer, and McMillan to examine the issue. The committee concluded that any problems could be overcome simply by requiring higher purity.{{sfn|Nichols|1987|pp=64\u201365}}\n\nOppenheimer reviewed his options in early 1943 and gave priority to the gun-type weapon,{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=55}} but he created the E-5 Group at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] under [[Seth Neddermeyer]] to investigate implosion as a hedge against the threat of pre-detonation. Implosion-type bombs were determined to be significantly more efficient in terms of explosive yield per unit mass of fissile material in the bomb, because compressed fissile materials react more rapidly and therefore more completely. Nonetheless, it was decided that the plutonium gun would receive the bulk of the research effort, since it was the project with the least amount of uncertainty involved. It was assumed that the uranium gun-type bomb could be easily adapted from it.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=87}}\n\n==Naming==\nThe gun-type and implosion-type designs were codenamed \"[[Thin Man (nuclear bomb)|Thin Man]]\" and \"Fat Man\" respectively. These code names were created by [[Robert Serber]], a former student of Oppenheimer's who worked on the Manhattan Project. He chose them based on their design shapes; the Thin Man was a very long device, and the name came from the [[Dashiell Hammett]] detective novel ''[[The Thin Man]]'' and [[The Thin Man (film)|series of movies]]. The Fat Man was round and fat and was named after [[Sydney Greenstreet]]'s character in ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]''. [[Little Boy]] came last as a variation of Thin Man.{{sfn|Serber|Crease|1998|p=104}}\n\n==Development==\nNeddermeyer discarded Serber and Tolman's initial concept of implosion as assembling a series of pieces in favor of one in which a hollow sphere was imploded by an explosive shell. He was assisted in this work by [[Hugh Bradner]], [[Charles Critchfield]], and John Streib. [[L.T.E. Thompson|L. T. E. Thompson]] was brought in as a consultant, and discussed the problem with Neddermeyer in June 1943. Thompson was skeptical that an implosion could be made sufficiently symmetric. Oppenheimer arranged for Neddermeyer and [[Edwin McMillan]] to visit the [[National Defense Research Committee]]'s Explosives Research Laboratory near the [[Experimental Mine, U.S. Bureau of Mines|laboratories]] of the [[United States Bureau of Mines|Bureau of Mines]] in [[Bruceton, Pennsylvania]] (a [[Pittsburgh]] suburb), where they spoke to [[George Kistiakowsky]] and his team. But Neddermeyer's efforts in July and August at imploding tubes to produce cylinders tended to produce objects that resembled rocks. Neddermeyer was the only person who believed that implosion was practical, and only his enthusiasm kept the project alive.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=86\u201390}}\n\n[[File:AirForceMuseum FatManReplica.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|left|alt=Fat Man Replica|Replica mockup of a ''Fat Man'' displayed in the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]], beside the ''[[Bockscar]]'' B-29 that dropped the original device \u2013 black liquid asphalt sealant was sprayed over the original bomb casing's seams, simulated on the mockup.]]\nOppenheimer brought [[John von Neumann]] to Los Alamos in September 1943 to take a fresh look at implosion. After reviewing Neddermeyer's studies, and discussing the matter with [[Edward Teller]], von Neumann suggested the use of high explosives in [[shaped charge]]s to implode a sphere, which he showed could not only result in a faster assembly of [[fissile]] material than was possible with the gun method, but which could greatly reduce the amount of material required, because of the resulting higher density.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=130\u2013133}} The idea that, under such pressures, the plutonium metal itself would be compressed came from Teller, whose knowledge of how dense metals behaved under heavy pressure was influenced by his pre-war theoretical studies of the [[Earth's core]] with [[George Gamow]].{{sfn|Teller|2001|pp=174\u2013176}} The prospect of more-efficient nuclear weapons impressed Oppenheimer, Teller, and [[Hans Bethe]], but they decided that an expert on explosives would be required. Kistiakowsky's name was immediately suggested, and Kistiakowsky was brought into the project as a consultant in October 1943.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=130\u2013133}}\n \nThe implosion project remained a backup until April 1944, when experiments by [[Emilio G. Segr\u00e8]] and his P-5 Group at Los Alamos on the newly reactor-produced [[plutonium]] from the [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]] at [[Clinton Engineer Works|Oak Ridge]] and the [[B Reactor]] at the [[Hanford site]] showed that it contained impurities in the form of the [[isotope]] [[plutonium-240]]. This has a far higher spontaneous fission rate and radioactivity than [[plutonium-239]]. The [[cyclotron]]-produced isotopes, on which the original measurements had been made, held much lower traces of plutonium-240. Its inclusion in reactor-bred plutonium appeared unavoidable. This meant that the spontaneous fission rate of the reactor plutonium was so high that it would be highly likely that it would [[predetonation|predetonate]] and blow itself apart during the initial formation of a critical mass.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=228}} The distance required to accelerate the plutonium to speeds where predetonation would be less likely would need a gun barrel too long for any existing or planned bomber. The only way to use plutonium in a workable bomb was therefore implosion.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=240\u2013244}}\n\n[[File:X-Ray-Image-HE-Lens-Test-Shot.gif|thumb|Flash X-Ray images of the converging shock waves formed during a test of the high-explosive lens system.]]\nThe impracticability of a gun-type bomb using plutonium was agreed at a meeting in Los Alamos on 17 July 1944. All gun-type work in the [[Manhattan Project]] was directed at the Little Boy, enriched-uranium gun design, and the Los Alamos Laboratory was reorganized, with almost all of the research focused on the problems of implosion for the Fat Man bomb.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=240\u2013244}} The idea of using shaped charges as three-dimensional [[explosive lens]]es came from [[James L.

The difficulties became apparent when attempts to measure the density of plutonium gave inconsistent results. At first contamination was believed to be the cause, but it was soon determined that there were multiple [[allotropes of plutonium]].{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=244\u2013245}} The brittle \u03b1 phase that exists at room temperature changes to the plastic \u03b2 phase at higher temperatures. Attention then shifted to the even more malleable \u03b4 phase that normally exists in the {{convert|300|-|450|\u00b0C|F|round=5}} range. It was found that this was stable at room temperature when alloyed with aluminum, but aluminum emits neutrons when bombarded with [[alpha particles]], which would exacerbate the pre-ignition problem. The metallurgists then hit upon a [[plutonium\u2013gallium alloy]], which stabilized the \u03b4 phase and could be [[hot pressing|hot pressed]] into the desired spherical shape. As plutonium was found to corrode readily, the sphere was coated with nickel.{{sfn|Baker|Hecker|Harbur|1983|pp=144\u2013145}}\n\n[[File:Fat Man test unit being raised from the pit into the bomb bay of a B-29.jpg|thumb|left|A [[pumpkin bomb]] (Fat Man test unit) being raised from the pit into the bomb bay of a B-29 for bombing practice during the weeks before the attack on Nagasaki.]]\nThe size of the bomb was constrained by the available aircraft.

The [[North American B-45 Tornado]], [[Convair XB-46]], [[Martin XB-48]], and [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]] bombers had bomb bays sized to carry the [[Grand Slam (bomb)|Grand Slam]], which was much longer but not as wide as the Fat Man. The only American bombers that could carry the Fat Man were the B-29 and the [[Convair B-36]]. In November 1945, the Army Air Forces asked Los Alamos for 200 Fat Man bombs, but there were only two sets of plutonium cores and high-explosive assemblies at the time. The Army Air Forces wanted improvements to the design to make it easier to manufacture, assemble, handle, transport, and stockpile. The wartime [[Project W-47]] was continued, and drop tests resumed in January 1946.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=137\u2013142}}\n\nThe Mark III Mod 0 Fat Man was ordered into production in mid-1946. High explosives were manufactured by the [[Salt Wells Pilot Plant]], which had been established by the Manhattan Project as part of [[Project Camel]], and a new plant was established at the [[Iowa Army Ammunition Plant]]. Mechanical components were made or procured by the [[Rock Island Arsenal]]; electrical and mechanical components for about 50 bombs were stockpiled at Kirtland Army Air Field by August 1946, but only nine plutonium cores were available. Production of the Mod 0 ended in December 1948, by which time there were still only 53 cores available. It was replaced by improved versions known as Mods 1 and 2 which contained a number of minor changes, the most important of which was that they did not charge the X-Unit firing system's capacitors until released from the aircraft. The Mod 0s were withdrawn from service between March and July 1949, and by October they had all been rebuilt as Mods 1 and 2.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=142\u2013145}} Some 120 Mark III Fat Man units were added to the stockpile between 1947 and 1949{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|p=87}} when it was superseded by the [[Mark 4 nuclear bomb]].{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=143}} The Mark III Fat Man was retired in 1950.{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|p=87}}{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=150}}\n\nA nuclear strike would have been a formidable undertaking in the post-war 1940s due to the limitations of the Mark III Fat Man. The lead-acid batteries which powered the fuzing system remained charged for only 36 hours, after which they needed to be recharged. To do this meant disassembling the bomb, and recharging took 72 hours. The batteries had to be removed in any case after nine days or they corroded. The plutonium core could not be left in for much longer, because its heat damaged the high explosives. Replacing the core also required the bomb to be completely disassembled and reassembled. This required about 40 to 50 men and took between 56 and 72 hours, depending on the skill of the bomb assembly team, and the [[Armed Forces Special Weapons Project]] had only three teams in June 1948.

In 1961 The Oslo School of Architecture was established as an independent school, and, from 1968, located in ''St. Olavs gate''.\n\nIn 1979, the first formal education in industrial design in Norway was offered as a two-year postgraduate study. A full degree program was established in 1983, and in 1989 this was placed under the direction of The Norwegian Arts and Crafts School. Then, in 1996, the Institute of Industrial Design became part of the Oslo School of Architecture.\n\nMaster of Landscape Architecture became part of AHO\u2019s master\u2019s programmes in 2004. In 2005, The Oslo School of Architecture changed name to The Oslo School of Architecture and Design. In 2009, the Institute of Industrial Design changed its name to the Institute of Design.\n\nIn 2001 the school moved to new facilities at Vulkan, a revitalised industrial area near the [[Aker River]]. In a central, innovative, creative and cultural part of the city. The school lays adjacent to the [[Oslo National Academy of the Arts]] and the recently opened Food Hall.\nIn 2005 the school changed its name to The Oslo School of Architecture and Design.\n\n==Units==\n*Institute of Architecture\n*Institute of Design\n*Institute of Form, Theory and History\n*Institute of Urbanism and Landscape\n\n==Notable alumni==\n* [[Sverre Fehn]]\n* [[Christian Norberg-Schulz]]\n* [[B\u00e5rd Eker]]\n\n==External links==\n*[https://aho.no/en The Oslo School of Architecture and Design (AHO)]\n\n{{Norwegian_Educational_Institutions}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Oslo School Of Architecture And Design}}\n[[Category:Architecture schools]]\n[[Category:Education in Oslo]]\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in Norway]]\n[[Category:Culture in Oslo]]\n[[Category:Architectural design]]\n[[Category:Oslo School of Architecture and Design|*]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1961]]\n[[Category:1961 establishments in Norway]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_School_of_Architecture_and_Design"}
