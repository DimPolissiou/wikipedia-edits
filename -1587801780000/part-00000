The [[Nullarbor Plain]] separates this race from the race ''novaenorciae'', which is found in [[Western Australia]].<ref name=Morcombe />\nThe western race ''novaenorciae'' is categorised on the basis of size differences, being about 20% smaller than race ''leucotis''.<ref name=Pearce /> Both populations look very similar, but they have significant genetic differences.

It is constituted by two different examinations - [[JEE Main]] and the [[JEE Advanced]].\n\nThe Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA) conducts the joint admission process for a total of 23 [[Indian Institutes of Technology|Indian Institute of Technology]] campuses, 32 [[National Institutes of Technology|National Institute of Technology]] campuses, 18 [[Indian Institutes of Information Technology|Indian Institute of Information Technology]] campuses, [[Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad|Indian School of Mines]] and 19 other [[Government Funded Technical Institutes]] (GFTIs) based on the rank obtained by a student in JEE Mains and JEE Advanced.\n\nThere are some institutes like [[Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research]] (IISERs), [[Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology]] (RGIPT), and  [[Indian Institute of Science]] (IISc) use the score obtained in JEE Advanced as the basis for admission. These institutes do not participate in the post examination counselling session. Any student who takes admission to IITs cannot appear for the JEE-Advanced exam in the next year, but the same is not the case with IISc, IISER, RGIPT and other institutes as these institutes only use JEE Advanced score for admission.\n\nAs per the reports from [[Ministry of Human Resource Development (India)|Ministry of Human Resource Development]] (MHRD) of Government of India, the government is considering to conduct only one common engineering entrance test based on the lines of [[National Eligibility and Entrance Test|NEET]] for all engineering colleges, including private institutions, across India.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jagranjosh.com/articles/mhrd-plans-single-entrance-exam-for-all-engineering-colleges-from-2018-1482482657-1|title=MHRD plans single entrance exam for all engineering colleges from 2018|date=10 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==JEE Main==\n{{Main|Joint Entrance Examination \u2013 Main}}\n\nJEE Main has two papers, Paper-1 and Paper-2.

Initially, in 1928, it was demand of ''Unnati Samaj'', political wing of Christian Tribals Association, which submitted a memorandum to Simon Commission to constitute a tribal state in eastern India. Prominent leader like [[Jaipal Singh Munda]] and [[Ram Narayan Singh]] demanded a separate state. [[Jharkhand Party]] led by Jaipal Singh Munda submitted memorandum to [[States Reorganization Commission]] for Jharkhand state, but it was rejected due to there was many languages and no link language in the region, tribal were not in majority and adverse effects on economy after separation from Bihar. In 1972, [[Binod Bihari Mahato]], [[Shibu Soren]] and [[A. K. Roy]] founded [[Jharkhand Mukti Morcha]].  [[Nirmal Mahto]] founded [[All Jharkhand Students Union]]. They spearheaded movement for separate state of Jharkhand. AJSU introduced elements of violence in the movement and called for boycott of election while JMM opposed it. Due to differences these party parted away from each other. There was a provision for limited internal autonomy in the hill area of Assam. Other tribal area were covered by the fifth schedule of the constitution. Chotanagpur and Santal Pargana development board constituted under the chairmanship of then Chief minister of Bihar under the provinsion of fifth schedule in 1972. It failed to meet desire result.

They spearheaded movement for separate state of Jharkhand. AJSU introduced elements of violence in the movement and called for boycott of election while JMM opposed it. Due to differences these party parted away from each other. There was a provision for limited internal autonomy in the hill area of Assam. Other tribal area were covered by the fifth schedule of the constitution. Chotanagpur and Santal Pargana development board constituted under the chairmanship of then Chief minister of Bihar under the provinsion of fifth schedule in 1972. It failed to meet desire result. Jharkhand co-ordination committee (JCC) led by [[Ram Dayal Munda]], [[Bindheswari Prasad Keshri|Dr. B.P. Keshri]], [[Binod Bihari Mahato]], Santosh Rana and Suraj Singh Besra started fresh initiative in the matter. Dr. B.P Keshri sent memoradum to form Jharkhand state. Centre government formed a committee on Jharkhand matter in 1989. It stressed the need of greater allocation of the development funds for the area. Jharkhand Area Autonomous Council (JAAC) Bill passed in Bihar legislative assembly in December 1994.

It was released by Pikachu Records on June 10, 1998, in [[Japan]] only. This collection consists of composer [[Shinji Miyazaki]]'s orchestrated arrangements of musical compositions from the first four Pok\u00e9mon games by composer [[Junichi Masuda]] and exclusive musical cues heard throughout the first series. These instrumental tracks are categorized as sixteen chapters included with the show's first opening song \"Mezase Pokemon Masut\u0101\" and second ending song \"Poketto ni Fantaj\u012b\" (both are the TV-size edits). Each of the instrumental tracks are followed by a brief commentary featuring [[Ash Ketchum|Satoshi]]'s [[Pok\u00e9dex|Pok\u00e9mon Zukan]] voiced by its voice actor [[Shin-ichiro Miki]] explaining each composition's association with the story and at what point it plays. Included with the album is a hard bound picture book (the {{nihongo|''Meibamen Sh\u016b''|\u540d\u5834\u9762\u96c6|famous  (impressive) scene collection}}), stickers, and a merchandise catalogue.\n\n====Track list====\n{{Tracklist\n| extra_column    =  Performed by\n| title1          = Mezase Pokemon Masut\u0101\n| note1           = {{Nihongo2|\u3081\u3056\u305b\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30de\u30b9\u30bf-}} ''Aim to Be a Pokemon Master''\n| music1          = Hirokazu Tanaka\n| lyrics1         = Akihito Toda\n| extra1          = [[Rika Matsumoto]]\n| length1         = 2:43\n}}\n{{Tracklist\n| headline        = Chapter.1 {{Nihongo|Pokemon!

It was released by Pikachu Records on June 10, 1998, in [[Japan]] only. This collection consists of composer [[Shinji Miyazaki]]'s orchestrated arrangements of musical compositions from the first four Pok\u00e9mon games by composer [[Junichi Masuda]] and exclusive musical cues heard throughout the first series. These instrumental tracks are categorized as sixteen chapters included with the show's first opening song \"Mezase Pokemon Masut\u0101\" and second ending song \"Poketto ni Fantaj\u012b\" (both are the TV-size edits). Each of the instrumental tracks are followed by a brief commentary featuring [[Ash Ketchum|Satoshi]]'s [[Pok\u00e9dex|Pok\u00e9mon Zukan]] voiced by its voice actor [[Shin-ichiro Miki]] explaining each composition's association with the story and at what point it plays. Included with the album is a hard bound picture book (the {{nihongo|''Meibamen Sh\u016b''|\u540d\u5834\u9762\u96c6|famous  (impressive) scene collection}}), stickers, and a merchandise catalogue.\n\n====Track list====\n{{Tracklist\n| extra_column    =  Performed by\n| title1          = Mezase Pokemon Masut\u0101\n| note1           = {{Nihongo2|\u3081\u3056\u305b\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30de\u30b9\u30bf-}} ''Aim to Be a Pokemon Master''\n| music1          = Hirokazu Tanaka\n| lyrics1         = Akihito Toda\n| extra1          = [[Rika Matsumoto]]\n| length1         = 2:43\n}}\n{{Tracklist\n| headline        = Chapter.1 {{Nihongo|Pokemon!

It is encompassed by hills of the Eastern Ghats and the [[Araku]] hills on three sides like a horse shoe with the western side opening up to [[Chhattisgarh]] in central India.\n\n==History==\nThe city of Jeypore came into existence when Veer Vikrama Dev, the King of Nandapur abandoned his old mainstay due to the rigorous skirmishes with the Qutub Shahis and decided to built a new bastion amidst high altitude mountain ranges and valleys of Jeypore. His successors including the next seventeen kings ruled their vast kingdom from this capital city of Jeypore until the dissolution of the state in 1947. Jeypore Rajya before the advent of the [[United Kingdom|British]] was a dominant kingdom in the ancient region of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] and administered over the feudatories of [[Vijayanagara|Vijaynagar]], [[Bobbili]], [[Kalahandi]], [[Gajapathinagaram]], [[Srikakulam]], [[Gunupur]], [[Madugula]], [[Nowrangpur]] and [[Araku]] until 1712 CE. It was Vishwambhar Dev (1676-1681 CE) who is known as the originator of the feudal system, he is known for defeating the Nawab of Chicacole in 1673. He also defeated the Dutch forces in the port of [[Visakhapatnam]] which was under his vast domain and was known as 'Sumber Deo which was a mispronounced form of his name.{{sfn|KBS Singh|1939|p=58}}\n[[File:Vikram Deo IV of Jeypore.jpg|thumb|His Highness Maharajah Sir Vikram Deo III K.C.I.E. of Jeypore]]\n\nHowever, when the British forces arrived in the region they were helped by Vijaynagar and other zamindaris to defeat Vikrama Dev I (1758-1781) who was against the idea of British occupation in his region. In 1775, Maharajah Vikram Dev I assembled a force in [[Rayagada]] valley against the rising British forces of the [[East India Company]] who were accompanied by the army of Vijaynagar, the former feudatory of Jeypore. Captain Richard Matthews was commanding the Northern [[Circars]] and he quoted, \" I took possession of the fort in 11th March, it is a square of about one thousand yards. The wall 20 feet high, the bastions very good, the rampart tolerable and a ditch 20 feet wide and as much deep. I have ordered it to be destroyed.\" However, the king was pardoned by the British and the kingdom was granted back to him but the clamorous defeat meant that the status of the kingdom was now lowered to that of a [[zamindari]] and Jeypore Rajya became Jeypore Samasthanam or Jeypore zamindari. {{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=97}}\n\nThe other notable kings were Vikram Dev III who was granted along with his successors the title of 'Maharajah' and the style of 'His Highness' by the British Raj, Ramchandra Dev IV (1920-1931 CE) who built the new palaces called Moti Mahal in Jeypore, Hawa Mahal in Visakhapatnam and sent his fleet of ships to help the British in World War I due to that he was thus granted the military rank of Lieutenant and the last king 'Sahitya Samrat' Vikram Dev IV (1931-1951) D.

It is encompassed by hills of the Eastern Ghats and the [[Araku]] hills on three sides like a horse shoe with the western side opening up to [[Chhattisgarh]] in central India.\n\n==History==\nThe city of Jeypore came into existence when Veer Vikrama Dev, the King of Nandapur abandoned his old mainstay due to the rigorous skirmishes with the Qutub Shahis and decided to built a new bastion amidst high altitude mountain ranges and valleys of Jeypore. His successors including the next seventeen kings ruled their vast kingdom from this capital city of Jeypore until the dissolution of the state in 1947. Jeypore Rajya before the advent of the [[United Kingdom|British]] was a dominant kingdom in the ancient region of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] and administered over the feudatories of [[Vijayanagara|Vijaynagar]], [[Bobbili]], [[Kalahandi]], [[Gajapathinagaram]], [[Srikakulam]], [[Gunupur]], [[Madugula]], [[Nowrangpur]] and [[Araku]] until 1712 CE. It was Vishwambhar Dev (1676-1681 CE) who is known as the originator of the feudal system, he is known for defeating the Nawab of Chicacole in 1673. He also defeated the Dutch forces in the port of [[Visakhapatnam]] which was under his vast domain and was known as 'Sumber Deo which was a mispronounced form of his name.{{sfn|KBS Singh|1939|p=58}}\n[[File:Vikram Deo IV of Jeypore.jpg|thumb|His Highness Maharajah Sir Vikram Deo III K.C.I.E. of Jeypore]]\n\nHowever, when the British forces arrived in the region they were helped by Vijaynagar and other zamindaris to defeat Vikrama Dev I (1758-1781) who was against the idea of British occupation in his region. In 1775, Maharajah Vikram Dev I assembled a force in [[Rayagada]] valley against the rising British forces of the [[East India Company]] who were accompanied by the army of Vijaynagar, the former feudatory of Jeypore. Captain Richard Matthews was commanding the Northern [[Circars]] and he quoted, \" I took possession of the fort in 11th March, it is a square of about one thousand yards. The wall 20 feet high, the bastions very good, the rampart tolerable and a ditch 20 feet wide and as much deep. I have ordered it to be destroyed.\" However, the king was pardoned by the British and the kingdom was granted back to him but the clamorous defeat meant that the status of the kingdom was now lowered to that of a [[zamindari]] and Jeypore Rajya became Jeypore Samasthanam or Jeypore zamindari. {{sfn|KSB Singh|1939|p=97}}\n\nThe other notable kings were Vikram Dev III who was granted along with his successors the title of 'Maharajah' and the style of 'His Highness' by the British Raj, Ramchandra Dev IV (1920-1931 CE) who built the new palaces called Moti Mahal in Jeypore, Hawa Mahal in Visakhapatnam and sent his fleet of ships to help the British in World War I due to that he was thus granted the military rank of Lieutenant and the last king 'Sahitya Samrat' Vikram Dev IV (1931-1951) D.
