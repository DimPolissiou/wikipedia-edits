He served as the chairman and [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) of the [[Starbucks|Starbucks Coffee Corporation]] for more than two decades; first from 1986 to 2000, and then from 2008 to 2017. After stepping down as CEO, Schultz stayed at the company from 2017 to 2018 as its executive chairman overseeing Starbuck's philanthropic and charitable giving arm. From 2001 to 2006, he owned the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], a basketball franchise that he sold for [[United States dollar|US$]]350 million to [[Clay Bennett (businessman)|Clay Bennett]], who moved the team to Oklahoma creating the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]]. <!--The lack of citations is purposeful.

After briefly selling office equipment door-to-door one of his early clients, the then coffeehouse startup Starbucks, onboarded him as their marketing head in 1982. A business trip to [[Milan|Milan, Italy]] and the [[Coffee in Italy|country's coffee culture]] inspired him to open ''Il Giornale'', a specialty coffeeshop that quickly merged with Starbucks during the late-1980s. Shultz pushed the new company to sell more than [[Coffee bean|coffee beans]] and equipment, quickly establishing a large network of stores that served [[espresso]], [[coffee]], teas, and casual food. Following large-scale distribution deals \u2013 particularly with major hotels, groceries, and bookstores \u2013 Starbucks became [[List of coffeehouse chains|the largest coffee-house chain]] in the world.<!--Cited in body.--> Shultz took the company [[Initial public offering|public]] in 1992 and used a $271 million valuation to double their store count in a series of  highly publicized [[coffee wars]]. He stepped down in 2000 to focus on Starbuck's international expansion, succeeded by [[Orin C. Smith|Orin Smith]].<!--Second tenure as CEO, 2008 to 2017.-->\n\nDuring the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2008 financial crisis]], Schultz returned as chief executive to stabilize the company after years of unsustainable growth. He led a mass-firing of executives, shuttered hundreds of weak stores, and temporarily closed all U.S. stores to retrain employees in making espresso. Shultz orchestrated multiple [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisitions]] of American and Chinese beverage companies and introduced a national [[loyalty program]]. His aggressive expansion in Chinese markets has been credited with reconciling [[Chinese tea culture|the country's tea-culture]] with [[Coffee production in China|coffee consumption in China]]. Schultz's positioning of Starbucks as a social hub is widely seen as introducing [[Third wave of coffee#History|the second wave]] of coffee culture in the U.S., particularly in Seattle. His second tenure sustained both [[Criticism of Starbucks|significant criticism]] and growth, ultimately adding nearly $100 billion in [[market capitalization]] to the company, a 21,000% increase in [[shareholder value]]. <!--Cited in body.-->Schultz was succeeded by [[Kevin Johnson (executive)|Kevin Johnson]] as CEO in April 2017, and has, since 2018, retained the title \"Chairman emeritus\" of Starbucks. \n\nSchultz was named the [[The World's Billionaires|145th-richest person in the United States]] by ''Forbes'' in 2019 with a [[net worth]] of $4.1 billion (November 2019).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/howard-schultz/#6de1621452c6|title=Howard Schultz|website=Forbes|access-date=April 2, 2019|language=en}}</ref> He is the author of [[Howard Schultz#Books|three books]], ''Pour Your Heart Into It'' (1997), ''Onward'' (2011), and ''From the Ground Up'' (2019). Long known for his outspoken [[Centrism|centrist]], moderate, and independent political views, Schultz explored a run in the [[2020 United States presidential election]] as an independent candidate but declined to formally join the contest for fear of re-electing [[Donald Trump]]. Schultz supports nonpartisan immigration policy, [[free trade]], [[Balanced budget|fiscal discipline]], comprehensive tax reform, gun control, same-sex marriage, and more generally, [[bipartisanship]] across the political spectrum.

He learned that they not only served excellent [[espresso]], they also served as meeting places or public squares; the 200,000 caf\u00e9s in the country were an important element of Italian culture and society. On his return, he tried to persuade the owners (including cofounder [[Jerry Baldwin]]) to offer traditional espresso beverages in addition to the whole bean coffee, leaf teas and spices they had long offered. After a successful pilot of the cafe concept, the owners refused to roll it out company-wide, saying they did not want to get into the restaurant business. Frustrated, Schultz decided to leave Starbucks in 1985. He needed $400,000 to open the first store and start the business. He did not have the money and his wife was pregnant with their first baby. Jerry Baldwin and Starbucks cofounder [[Gordon Bowker]] offered to help. Schultz also received $100,000 from a doctor who was impressed by Schultz's energy to \"take a gamble\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Mullins|first=John|title=The New Business Road Test|url=https://archive.org/details/newbusinessroadt0000mull|url-access=registration|year=2007}}</ref> By 1986, he had raised all the money he needed to open the first store, \"Il Giornale\", named after [[Il Giornale|the Milanese newspaper]] of the same name. The store offered ice cream in addition to coffee, had little seating, and played opera music in the background to portray an Italian experience. Two years later, the original Starbucks management decided to focus on [[Peet's Coffee & Tea]] and sold its Starbucks retail unit to Schultz and Il Giornale for US$3.8&nbsp;million.\n\nSchultz renamed ''Il Giornale'' with the Starbucks name, and aggressively expanded its reach across the United States. Schultz's insight in real estate and his hard-line focus on growth drove him to expand the company rapidly. Schultz did not believe in [[franchising]], and made a point of having Starbucks retain ownership of every domestic outlet.

He served as the chairman and [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) of the [[Starbucks|Starbucks Coffee Corporation]] for more than two decades; first from 1986 to 2000, and then from 2008 to 2017. After stepping down as CEO, Schultz stayed at the company from 2017 to 2018 as its executive chairman overseeing Starbuck's philanthropic and charitable giving arm. From 2001 to 2006, he owned the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], a basketball franchise that he sold for [[United States dollar|US$]]350 million to [[Clay Bennett (businessman)|Clay Bennett]], who moved the team to Oklahoma creating the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]]. <!--The lack of citations is purposeful.

After briefly selling office equipment door-to-door one of his early clients, the then coffeehouse startup Starbucks, onboarded him as their marketing head in 1982. A business trip to [[Milan|Milan, Italy]] and the [[Coffee in Italy|country's coffee culture]] inspired him to open ''Il Giornale'', a specialty coffeeshop that quickly merged with Starbucks during the late-1980s. Shultz pushed the new company to sell more than [[Coffee bean|coffee beans]] and equipment, quickly establishing a large network of stores that served [[espresso]], [[coffee]], teas, and casual food. Following large-scale distribution deals \u2013 particularly with major hotels, groceries, and bookstores \u2013 Starbucks became [[List of coffeehouse chains|the largest coffee-house chain]] in the world.<!--Cited in body.--> Shultz took the company [[Initial public offering|public]] in 1992 and used a $271 million valuation to double their store count in a series of  highly publicized [[coffee wars]]. He stepped down in 2000 to focus on Starbuck's international expansion, succeeded by [[Orin C. Smith|Orin Smith]].<!--Second tenure as CEO, 2008 to 2017.-->\n\nDuring the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2008 financial crisis]], Schultz returned as chief executive to stabilize the company after years of unsustainable growth. He led a mass-firing of executives, shuttered hundreds of weak stores, and temporarily closed all U.S. stores to retrain employees in making espresso. Shultz orchestrated multiple [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisitions]] of American and Chinese beverage companies and introduced a national [[loyalty program]]. His aggressive expansion in Chinese markets has been credited with reconciling [[Chinese tea culture|the country's tea-culture]] with [[Coffee production in China|coffee consumption in China]]. Schultz's positioning of Starbucks as a social hub is widely seen as introducing [[Third wave of coffee#History|the second wave]] of coffee culture in the U.S., particularly in Seattle. His second tenure sustained both [[Criticism of Starbucks|significant criticism]] and growth, ultimately adding nearly $100 billion in [[market capitalization]] to the company, a 21,000% increase in [[shareholder value]]. <!--Cited in body.-->Schultz was succeeded by [[Kevin Johnson (executive)|Kevin Johnson]] as CEO in April 2017, and has, since 2018, retained the title \"Chairman emeritus\" of Starbucks. \n\nSchultz was named the [[The World's Billionaires|145th-richest person in the United States]] by ''Forbes'' in 2019 with a [[net worth]] of $4.1 billion (November 2019).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/howard-schultz/#6de1621452c6|title=Howard Schultz|website=Forbes|access-date=April 2, 2019|language=en}}</ref> He is the author of [[Howard Schultz#Books|three books]], ''Pour Your Heart Into It'' (1997), ''Onward'' (2011), and ''From the Ground Up'' (2019). Long known for his outspoken [[Centrism|centrist]], moderate, and independent political views, Schultz explored a run in the [[2020 United States presidential election]] as an independent candidate but declined to formally join the contest for fear of re-electing [[Donald Trump]]. Schultz supports nonpartisan immigration policy, [[free trade]], [[Balanced budget|fiscal discipline]], comprehensive tax reform, gun control, same-sex marriage, and more generally, [[bipartisanship]] across the political spectrum.

He learned that they not only served excellent [[espresso]], they also served as meeting places or public squares; the 200,000 caf\u00e9s in the country were an important element of Italian culture and society. On his return, he tried to persuade the owners (including cofounder [[Jerry Baldwin]]) to offer traditional espresso beverages in addition to the whole bean coffee, leaf teas and spices they had long offered. After a successful pilot of the cafe concept, the owners refused to roll it out company-wide, saying they did not want to get into the restaurant business. Frustrated, Schultz decided to leave Starbucks in 1985. He needed $400,000 to open the first store and start the business. He did not have the money and his wife was pregnant with their first baby. Jerry Baldwin and Starbucks cofounder [[Gordon Bowker]] offered to help. Schultz also received $100,000 from a doctor who was impressed by Schultz's energy to \"take a gamble\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Mullins|first=John|title=The New Business Road Test|url=https://archive.org/details/newbusinessroadt0000mull|url-access=registration|year=2007}}</ref> By 1986, he had raised all the money he needed to open the first store, \"Il Giornale\", named after [[Il Giornale|the Milanese newspaper]] of the same name. The store offered ice cream in addition to coffee, had little seating, and played opera music in the background to portray an Italian experience. Two years later, the original Starbucks management decided to focus on [[Peet's Coffee & Tea]] and sold its Starbucks retail unit to Schultz and Il Giornale for US$3.8&nbsp;million.\n\nSchultz renamed ''Il Giornale'' with the Starbucks name, and aggressively expanded its reach across the United States. Schultz's insight in real estate and his hard-line focus on growth drove him to expand the company rapidly. Schultz did not believe in [[franchising]], and made a point of having Starbucks retain ownership of every domestic outlet.

{"title_page": "Gilberts of Compton", "text_new": "The Gilberts of Compton were a noted [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] family of knightly class,<ref name=\"Westcote, Thomas\">Westcote, Thomas. ''A View of Devonshire in MDCXXX, with a Pedigree of Most of its Gentry''. Exeter, 1845.</ref> having seats at both [[Compton Castle]] and [[Greenway Estate]], [[Devon]], [[England]]. They were prominent in the [[British colonization of the Americas]] during the [[Elizabethan era]].<ref name=\"Thornton, J. Wingate\">Thornton, J. Wingate. ''Genealogical Memoir of the Gilbert Family in both Old and New England''. Boston, 1850.</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n\nThere are conflicting origin stories of the Gilberts of Compton among [[antiquarians]].  A popular story is that the Gilberts descended from [[Gilbert, Count of Brionne]], through his sons [[Richard fitz Gilbert|Richard Fitz-Gilbert]] and [[Baldwin FitzGilbert|Baldwin Fitz-Gilbert]].<ref name=\"Gilbert, C.S.\">Gilbert, C.S. ''An Historical Survey of the County of Cornwall : To Which is Added, a Complete Heraldry of the Same''. London, Congdon, 1820.</ref><ref name=\"Thornton, J. Wingate\" />  While the Fitz-Gilbert brothers were active in Devon, there is no evidence to suggest that their progeny became the Gilbert family.  This claim is especially dubious considering the name Fitz-Gilbert was not, at that time, a hereditary surname under the [[Normans|Norman]] naming system.\n  \nA second claim is that the Gilberts \u201cpossessed lands in [[Manaton]], (in or near [[Dartmoor]],) in [[Edward the Confessor|Edward the Confessors]]\u2019 days\u201d, placing the Gilbert family in Devon before 1066.<ref>Burke, Bernard. ''Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry of Great Britain & Ireland''. London, Harrison, Pall Mall, 1875.</ref><ref>Lysons, Daniel and Samuel Lysons. ''Magna Britannia: Being a Concise Topographical Account of the Several Counties of Great Britain''. London, 1817.</ref><ref name=\"Gilbert, C.S.\" />  Though [[surname|surnames]] at that epoch were rare in Europe, it is possible that the surname Gilbert existed quite early as evidenced by [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Poitiers|Guillaume I Gilbert, Bishop of Poitiers]] from 1117 to 1124.<ref>''Dictionnaire universel, dogmatique, canonique, historique, g\u00e9ographique et chronologique, des sciences eccl\u00e9siastiques, Volume 6''. 1765.</ref><ref>''Biblioth\u00e8que sacr\u00e9e, ou Dictionnaire universel, historique, dogmatique, canonique, g\u00e9ographique et chronologique des sciences eccl\u00e9siastiques''. 1827</ref><ref>''Archives Historiques du Poitou, Volume 25''. Societe des Archives Historiques du Poitou, 1895.</ref>  The quote was likely based on a passage from an earlier work: \u201cThis riveret parts Manaton, alias Magneton, and [[Lustleigh|Lustlegh]]. Many have possessed lands here: in the Confessor's time Gilbert; after Sauls, Horton, Le Moyn, and others\u201d, itself based on entries in the [[Domesday Book]].<ref name=\"Westcote, Thomas\" />  The other names listed are surnames, suggesting 'Gilbert' is as well in this instance.  Taken with the fact that Manaton is a mere 15 miles from Compton Castle, the suggestion is that these Gilberts may have been the progenitors of the line.  However, there is so far no direct evidence of this being the case.\n\nWhat is more demonstrable is that the male line leading to the Gilberts of Compton likely rose from obscurity with the marriage of a William Gilbert of Devon to Elizabeth Champernowne of [[Clist]], a descendant of [[William the Conqueror]], sometime in the first few decades of the [[13th century]].  Their great grandson, Sir Geoffrey (Galfried) Gilbert ([[Member of Parliament]] for [[Totnes]] in 1326) married Lady Joan Compton, heiress of Compton Castle, thereby becoming \u201cof Compton\u201d.<ref>Worthy, Charles. ''Devonshire wills: a collection of annotated testamentary abstracts, together with the family history and genealogy of many of the most ancient gentle houses of the west of England''.

Vivian''. Exeter, 1895.</ref>\n\n==Notable Descendants==\n\nLittle is known of the family's activities during the [[Middle Ages]] aside from Sir Otho Gilbert of Compton serving as [[High Sheriff of Devon]] from 1475 to 1476.  It was descendants of this Otho Gilbert who would set out during the Elizabethan period on the family's \u201chereditary scheme of peopling America with Englishmen\u201d.<ref name=\"Thornton, J. Wingate\" />  Most famous among these were the half brothers Sir [[Humphrey Gilbert]] and Sir [[Walter Raleigh]], both famous explorers of the New World and perhaps infamous military figures in Ireland due to their military exploits there. Their lesser-known brother, Sir Adrian Gilbert of Compton, was nonetheless of the same cloth, having an especially savage military reputation in Ireland while also seeking a [[Northwest Passage]] to [[China]] under a patent from [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].<ref name=\"Thornton, J. Wingate\" />  Another brother, Sir John Gilbert, was Sheriff of Devon, knighted by Elizabeth I in 1571, and was [[Vice Admiral of Devon]] \u2013 responsible for defense against the [[Spanish Armada]].<ref>[https://www.rammuseum.org.uk/elizabethan-silver-spoon-saved-for-devon/ \"Elizabethan Silver Spoon Saved for Devon\"], ''Royal Albert Memorial Museum & Art Gallery, Exeter City Council'', September 19, 2013.</ref>\n \nIn the following generation, [[Bartholomew Gilbert]] named [[Cape Cod]] during his 1602 expedition to establish a colony in [[New England]].  He was killed by a group of [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquians]] during a voyage the following year in search of the missing [[Roanoke Colony]].  In 1607, Sir Humphrey Gilbert's son, Raleigh Gilbert, established a fortified storehouse he called [[Popham Colony|Fort Saint George]] on the coast of [[Maine]].  In the face of \u201cnothing but extreme extremities\u201d, this colony ultimately voted to return to England.  It is said that they were so resolute in this goal that they built a ship to facilitate the return voyage, which would probably have been the first oceangoing vessel built in America.<ref name=\"Thornton, J. Wingate\" />\n\nLater, brothers Jonathan and John Gilbert would have a hand in establishing [[Hartford]], [[Connecticut]], acting as emissaries between the Governor in Hartford and the local [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous tribes]].  Jonathan was a skilled [[Linguistics|linguist]] of local tribal languages and served as a [[militia]] leader.<ref name=\"Thornton, J. Wingate\" />  John's young son, another John Gilbert, was famously captured by [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]], [[Wampanoag]] and [[Nashaway]]/[[Nipmuc]] tribes led by [[Monoco]] after their [[Lancaster raid|attack on Lancaster, Massachusetts]].<ref>Drake, Samuel. ''Tragedies of the Wilderness''. Boston, 1844.</ref>  In another unfortunate incident John's sister-in-law, Lydia Gilbert, was sentenced to death for witchcraft in Windsor, Connecticut, in 1654 during the infamous [[Connecticut Witch Trials]].<ref>Taylor, John M. ''The Witchcraft Delusion in Colonial Connecticut, 1647-1697''. New York, Grafton Press, 1908.</ref>  However Jonathan's younger son, Captain Thomas Gilbert, was said to have been \u201ca brave and successful officer, and a leading man in the primitive navy of the colony\u201d.  Thomas commanded the twelve-gun ship ''Swan'' during [[King William's War]], capturing the French ship ''Saint Jacob''.  He was captured in 1695, spending the rest of the war as a prisoner in France.<ref name=\"Thornton, J. Wingate\" />\n\n==Current Day==\n\nCompton Castle is still today in the hands of the Gilbert family.  Geoffrey Gilbert, a modern descendant, resides at Compton and administers the estate for the [[National trust|National Trust]].  His wife, Angela Gilbert, was appointed High Sheriff of Devon in 2016.<ref>Rees, Julian. [http://www.englishrivieramagazine.co.uk/riviera-people-angela-gilbert-lady-castle/ \"Riviera People \u2013 Angela Gilbert, Lady of the Castle\"], ''English Riviera Magazine'', August 9, 2016.</ref>\n\n==Myths and Legends==\n\nAccording to one of the many purported versions of the now lost [[Companions of William the Conqueror|Battle Abby Roll]], a T. Gilbard (Gilbert) fought alongside William the Conqueror at the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066.  This claim comes from a 1655 work called ''The church-history of Britain from the birth of Jesus Christ until the year M.DC.XLVIII'', written by [[Thomas Fuller]].  Fuller relied on source material provided by an antiquarian named Thomas Scriven, who was operating under the alias Mr. Fox. There is no evidence so far to corroborate this claim.<ref>Fuller, Thomas.

''Genealogical Memoir of the Gilbert Family in both Old and New England''. Boston, 1850.</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n\nThere are conflicting origin stories of the Gilberts of Compton among [[antiquarians]].  A popular story is that the Gilberts descended from [[Gilbert, Count of Brionne]], through his sons [[Richard fitz Gilbert|Richard Fitz-Gilbert]] and [[Baldwin FitzGilbert|Baldwin Fitz-Gilbert]].<ref name=\"Gilbert, C.S.\">Gilbert, C.S. ''An Historical Survey of the County of Cornwall : To Which is Added, a Complete Heraldry of the Same''. London, Congdon, 1820.</ref><ref name=\"Thornton, J. Wingate\" />  While the Fitz-Gilbert brothers were active in Devon, there is no evidence to suggest that their progeny became the Gilbert family.  This claim is especially dubious considering the name Fitz-Gilbert was not, at that time, a hereditary surname under the [[Normans|Norman]] naming system.\n  \nA second claim is that the Gilberts \u201cpossessed lands in [[Manaton]], (in or near [[Dartmoor]],) in [[Edward the Confessor|Edward the Confessors]]\u2019 days\u201d, placing the Gilbert family in Devon before 1066.<ref>Burke, Bernard.

''Magna Britannia: Being a Concise Topographical Account of the Several Counties of Great Britain''. London, 1817.</ref><ref name=\"Gilbert, C.S.\" />  Though [[surname|surnames]] at that epoch were rare in Europe, it is possible that the surname Gilbert existed at that time as evidenced by [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Poitiers|Guillaume I Gilbert, Bishop of Poitiers]] from 1117 to 1124.<ref>''Dictionnaire universel, dogmatique, canonique, historique, g\u00e9ographique et chronologique, des sciences eccl\u00e9siastiques, Volume 6''. 1765.</ref><ref>''Biblioth\u00e8que sacr\u00e9e, ou Dictionnaire universel, historique, dogmatique, canonique, g\u00e9ographique et chronologique des sciences eccl\u00e9siastiques''. 1827</ref><ref>''Archives Historiques du Poitou, Volume 25''.

Many have possessed lands here: in the Confessor's time Gilbert; after Sauls, Horton, Le Moyn, and others\u201d, itself based on entries in the [[Domesday Book]].<ref name=\"Westcote, Thomas\" />  This passage simply states someone named Gilbert, a popular first name at the time, lived in Devon.\n\nWhat is more demonstrable is that the male line leading to the Gilberts of Compton likely rose from obscurity with the marriage of a William Gilbert of Devon to Elizabeth Champernowne of [[Clist]], a descendant of [[William the Conqueror]], sometime in the first few decades of the [[13th century]].  Their great grandson, Sir Geoffrey (Galfried) Gilbert ([[Member of Parliament]] for [[Totnes]] in 1326) married Lady Joan Compton, heiress of Compton Castle, thereby becoming \u201cof Compton\u201d.<ref>Worthy, Charles.

It was descendants of this Otho Gilbert who would set out during the Elizabethan period on the family's \u201chereditary scheme of peopling America with Englishmen\u201d.<ref name=\"Thornton, J. Wingate\" />  Most famous among these were the half brothers Sir [[Humphrey Gilbert]] and Sir [[Walter Raleigh]], both famous explorers of the New World and perhaps infamous military figures in Ireland due to their military exploits there. Their lesser-known brother, Sir Adrian Gilbert of Compton, was nonetheless of the same cloth, having an especially savage military reputation in Ireland while also seeking a [[Northwest Passage]] to [[China]] under a patent from [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].<ref name=\"Thornton, J. Wingate\" />  Another brother, Sir John Gilbert, was Sheriff of Devon, knighted by Elizabeth I in 1571, and was [[Vice Admiral of Devon]] \u2013 responsible for defense against the [[Spanish Armada]].<ref>[https://www.rammuseum.org.uk/elizabethan-silver-spoon-saved-for-devon/ \"Elizabethan Silver Spoon Saved for Devon\"], ''Royal Albert Memorial Museum & Art Gallery, Exeter City Council'', September 19, 2013.</ref>\n \nIn the following generation, [[Bartholomew Gilbert]] named [[Cape Cod]] during his 1602 expedition to establish a colony in [[New England]].  He was killed by a group of [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquians]] during a voyage the following year in search of the missing [[Roanoke Colony]].  In 1607, Sir Humphrey Gilbert's son, Raleigh Gilbert, established a fortified storehouse he called [[Popham Colony|Fort Saint George]] on the coast of [[Maine]].  In the face of \u201cnothing but extreme extremities\u201d, this colony ultimately voted to return to England.  It is said that they were so resolute in this goal that they built a ship to facilitate the return voyage, which would probably have been the first oceangoing vessel built in America.<ref name=\"Thornton, J. Wingate\" />\n\nLater, brothers Jonathan and John Gilbert would have a hand in establishing [[Hartford]], [[Connecticut]], acting as emissaries between the Governor in Hartford and the local [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous tribes]].  Jonathan was a skilled [[Linguistics|linguist]] of local tribal languages and served as a [[militia]] leader.<ref name=\"Thornton, J. Wingate\" />  John's young son, another John Gilbert, was famously captured by [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]], [[Wampanoag]] and [[Nashaway]]/[[Nipmuc]] tribes led by [[Monoco]] after their [[Lancaster raid|attack on Lancaster, Massachusetts]].<ref>Drake, Samuel. ''Tragedies of the Wilderness''. Boston, 1844.</ref>  In another unfortunate incident John's sister-in-law, Lydia Gilbert, was sentenced to death for witchcraft in Windsor, Connecticut, in 1654 during the infamous [[Connecticut Witch Trials]].<ref>Taylor, John M. ''The Witchcraft Delusion in Colonial Connecticut, 1647-1697''. New York, Grafton Press, 1908.</ref>  However Jonathan's younger son, Captain Thomas Gilbert, was said to have been \u201ca brave and successful officer, and a leading man in the primitive navy of the colony\u201d.  Thomas commanded the twelve-gun ship ''Swan'' during [[King William's War]], capturing the French ship ''Saint Jacob''.  He was captured in 1695, spending the rest of the war as a prisoner in France.<ref name=\"Thornton, J. Wingate\" />\n\n==Current Day==\n\nCompton Castle is still today in the hands of the Gilbert family.  Geoffrey Gilbert, a modern descendant, resides at Compton and administers the estate for the [[National trust|National Trust]].  His wife, Angela Gilbert, was appointed High Sheriff of Devon in 2016.<ref>Rees, Julian. [http://www.englishrivieramagazine.co.uk/riviera-people-angela-gilbert-lady-castle/ \"Riviera People \u2013 Angela Gilbert, Lady of the Castle\"], ''English Riviera Magazine'', August 9, 2016.</ref>\n\n==Myths and Legends==\n\nAccording to one of the many purported versions of the now lost [[Companions of William the Conqueror|Battle Abby Roll]], a T. Gilbard (Gilbert) fought alongside William the Conqueror at the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066.  This claim comes from a 1655 work called ''The church-history of Britain from the birth of Jesus Christ until the year M.DC.XLVIII'', written by [[Thomas Fuller]].  Fuller relied on source material provided by an antiquarian named Thomas Scriven, who was operating under the alias Mr. Fox. There is no evidence so far to corroborate this claim.<ref>Fuller, Thomas.

The season began on 30 July 1999 and ended on 4 June 1999. [[Mamelodi Sundowns F.C.|Mamelodi Sundowns]] once again managed to secure their crown, sealing their third successive PSL title. Along with their success in the PSL's predecessor - winning three [[National Soccer League]] titles in 1988, 1990 and 1993 - this gave Mamelodi Sundowns their 6th South African championship. Sundowns tallied 75 points for the season, equalling the points record they jointly set with [[Kaizer Chiefs F.C.|Kaizer Chiefs]] [[1998\u201399 Premier Soccer League|last season]], but unlike the previous season in which the title was decided by goal difference, there was no close title race this season as Sundowns finished comfortably ahead of second placed [[Orlando Pirates]] with an 11-point margin.\n\nAs before, the league was contested by 18 teams, sixteen returning from the [[1997\u201398 Premier Soccer League|1997\u201398 season]] and two newly promoted clubs; the returning [[African Wanderers]] and [[Maritzburg United F.C.|Tembisa Classic]]. The league continued to run parallel to the European football calendar (August\u2013May) and not run concurrently with the African football calendar (January\u2013December).\n\n== Club mergers and name changes ==\nAt the conclusion of the 1998-99 PSL season [[Cape Town]] clubs [[Ajax Cape Town F.C.|Cape Town Spurs]] and [[Seven Stars (South Africa)|Seven Stars]] merged, and in conjunction with [[Netherlands|Dutch]] giants [[AFC Ajax|Ajax Amsterdam]], named the new club [[Ajax Cape Town F.C.]]. The merger came about after Seven Stars' Chairman and owner [[Rob Moore (South African Entrepreneur)|Rob Moore]] had travelled to the Netherlands to conclude the transfer of star striker [[Benni McCarthy]]. At the transfer meeting the Ajax Amsterdam board mentioned to Moore that they would like to set up a ''Football Development Academy'' in South Africa. With this in mind, Moore developed a blueprint for the creation of a new football club that would best be able to harness the talents of young South African footballers and operate as a feeder club to Ajax Amsterdam. Moore submitted his proposal to the Ajax Amsterdam board and they accepted it, entrusting Moore with the task of returning to South Africa and implementing his idea. Once back home Moore contacted Cape Town Spurs' Chairman [[John Comitis]] and invited him to join this new venture. The two Chairman agreed and so, in October 1998, Ajax Cape Town was created from the merger of the two clubs and with the technical input of Ajax Amsterdam. The new club adopted the famous kit and badge - with a slight modification, replacing the word ''Amsterdam'' with ''Cape Town'' - of their European ''parent'' club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ajaxct.com/the_club.htm?category=club+history|title=Ajax Cape Town Club History|publisher=ajaxct.com|date=5 August 2011|accessdate=6 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe merger between Ajax Cape Town and Free State Stars left the PSL with 17 teams, one short of the 18 it required. In order to fill the vacant spot a second team was created out of the Cape Town Spurs-Seven Stars merger; [[Mother City F.C.]]. However, unlike the planning and resources that went into establishing Ajax Cape Town, Mother City came into existence in a far more rushed manner with nowhere near the resources or technical input of Ajax Cape Town. The result was a club that set as yet unbroken records for fewest wins, most goals conceded and fewest points in a league season. The club was relegated with ease and would cease to exist a mere 3 years after its establishment.\n\n[[Free State (South African province)|Free State]] club [[Free State Stars F.C.|Qwa Qwa Stars]] changed their name to [[Free State Stars F.C.]] in order to broaden their appeal.\n\n==Season summary==\n\n[[Mamelodi Sundowns]] clinched a record third successive [[Premier Soccer League]] title when they romped home in first place at the end of the 1999-2000 season. After a nail-biting finish to the [[1998\u201399 Premier Soccer League|1998-99 season]] that saw Sundowns and [[Kaizer Chiefs F.C.|Kaizer Chiefs]] finish level on points, Sundowns had a much easier time securing the title this time around, finishing comfortably ahead of second placed [[Orlando Pirates]]. Chiefs, who had finished runners-up for the past three seasons, fell back to third place as they found themselves unable to replicate their performance from the 1998-99 season.\n\nThe newly created [[Ajax Cape Town F.C.|Ajax Cape Town]] had a strong season, finishing in fourth place on 53 points, with inaugural PSL champions [[Manning Rangers]] just behind them in fifth. [[Wits University F.C.|Wits University]], [[Jomo Cosmos]] and [[Hellenic F.C.|Hellenic]] rounded out the top eight. Newly promoted [[Maritzburg United F.C.|Tembisa Classic]] had a strong debut season, finishing in a respectable 9th place.\n\nPopular [[KwaZulu Natal]] club [[AmaZulu F.C.|AmaZulu]] and the newly formed [[Mother City F.C.|Mother City]] found themselves at the wrong end of the table. After years of just avoiding the drop by finishing 14th, 15th & 14th over the course of the past three seasons, AmaZulu's luck finally ran out as they were relegated. Heading into the final day of the season AmaZulu found themselves level on points with [[African Wanderers]] - who had only just returned to the PSL following their relegation at the end of the [[1997\u201398 Premier Soccer League|1997-98 season]] - with only goal difference separating them; AmaZulu's goal difference of -11 keeping them above African Wanderers who had a goal difference of -13. All AmaZulu had to do was equal or better African Wanderers' result on the final day of the season. For their final fixtures neither team had it easy as AmaZulu had to travel to face Ajax Cape Town while Wanderers had to host runners-up Orlando Pirates. In a thrilling result African Wanderers managed to put four goals past Pirates in a magnificent 4-3 win while AmaZulu suffered an agonising 2-1 defeat, putting both teams level on goal difference but moving Wanderers onto 39 points, three ahead of AmaZulu and into safety.\n\nMother City however never looked like they would survive. By season's end they had set PSL records for the fewest wins (2), most defeats (28), most goals conceded (85), worst goal difference (-63) and fewest points (10). Mother City conceded 4-goals or more on 6 occasions and twice conceded 6. Following their relegation the club would not return to the PSL and would only last for two more seasons in the [[National First Division]] before shutting down.\n\nThe 1999-2000 season was characterised by prolific goalscoring, with an average of 2.69 goals per match. Of particular interest were the games between Classic and Hellenic which featured a startling 15 goals. Classic had suffered a 6-0 drubbing at the hands of Hellenic on 14 August 1999 but returned home and defeated Hellenic in a thrilling 9-goal affair, running out 5-4 winners. Other high scoring games included SuperSport United's 7-2 rout of AmaZulu in Mthatha and the pulsating 4-4 draw in [[Bloemfontein]] between Bloemfontein Celtic and Manning Rangers.\n\n==Final table==\n\n{{#invoke:sports table|main|style=WDL\n|res_col_header=QR\n\n|team1=MAM|name_MAM=[[Mamelodi Sundowns F.C.|Mamelodi Sundowns]]\n|team2=ORL|name_ORL=[[Orlando Pirates]]\n|team3=KAI|name_KAI=[[Kaizer Chiefs F.C.|Kaizer Chiefs]]\n|team4=AJA|name_AJA=[[Ajax Cape Town F.C.|Ajax Cape Town]]\n|team5=MAN|name_MAN=[[Manning Rangers]]\n|team6=WTU|name_WTU=[[Wits University F.C.|Wits University]]\n|team7=JOM|name_JOM=[[Jomo Cosmos]]\n|team8=HEL|name_HEL=[[Hellenic F.C.|Hellenic]]\n|team9=TEM|name_TEM=[[Maritzburg United F.C.|Tembisa Classic]]\n|team10=SUP|name_SUP=[[SuperSport United F.C.|SuperSport United]]\n|team11=SAN|name_SAN=[[Santos Football Club (South Africa)|Santos]]\n|team12=MOR|name_MOR=[[Moroka Swallows F.C.|Moroka Swallows]]\n|team13=BUS|name_BUS=[[Bush Bucks F.C.

The season began on 30 July 1999 and ended on 4 June 1999. [[Mamelodi Sundowns F.C.|Mamelodi Sundowns]] once again managed to secure their crown, sealing their third successive PSL title. Along with their success in the PSL's predecessor - winning three [[National Soccer League]] titles in 1988, 1990 and 1993 - this gave Mamelodi Sundowns their 6th South African championship. Sundowns tallied 75 points for the season, equalling the points record they jointly set with [[Kaizer Chiefs F.C.|Kaizer Chiefs]] [[1998-99 Premier Soccer League|last season]], but unlike the previous season in which the title was decided by goal difference, there was no close title race this season as Sundowns finished comfortably ahead of second placed [[Orlando Pirates]] with an 11-point margin.\n\nAs before, the league was contested by 18 teams, sixteen returning from the [[Premier Soccer League 1997-98|1997\u201398 season]] and two newly promoted clubs; the returning [[African Wanderers]] and [[Maritzburg United F.C.|Tembisa Classic]]. The league continued to run parallel to the European football calendar (August\u2013May) and not run concurrently with the African football calendar (January\u2013December).\n\n== Club mergers and name changes ==\n\n* At the conclusion of the 1998-99 PSL season [[Cape Town]] clubs [[Ajax Cape Town F.C.|Cape Town Spurs]] and [[Seven Stars (South Africa)|Seven Stars]] merged, and in conjunction with [[Netherlands|Dutch]] giants [[AFC Ajax|Ajax Amsterdam]], named the new club [[Ajax Cape Town F.C.]]. The merger came about after Seven Stars' Chairman and owner [[Rob Moore (South African Entrepreneur)|Rob Moore]] had travelled to the Netherlands to conclude the transfer of star striker [[Benni McCarthy]]. At the transfer meeting the Ajax Amsterdam board mentioned to Moore that they would like to set up a ''Football Development Academy'' in South Africa. With this in mind, Moore developed a blueprint for the creation of a new football club that would best be able to harness the talents of young South African footballers and operate as a feeder club to Ajax Amsterdam. Moore submitted his proposal to the Ajax Amsterdam board and they accepted it, entrusting Moore with the task of returning to South Africa and implementing his idea. Once back home Moore contacted Cape Town Spurs' Chairman [[John Comitis]] and invited him to join this new venture. The two Chairman agreed and so, in October 1998, Ajax Cape Town was created from the merger of the two clubs and with the technical input of Ajax Amsterdam. The new club adopted the famous kit and badge - with a slight modification, replacing the word ''Amsterdam'' with ''Cape Town'' - of their European ''parent'' club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ajaxct.com/the_club.htm?category=club+history|title=Ajax Cape Town Club History|publisher=ajaxct.com|date=5 August 2011|accessdate=6 July 2012}}</ref>\n* The merger between Ajax Cape Town and Free State Stars left the PSL with 17 teams, one short of the 18 it required. In order to fill the vacant spot a second team was created out of the Cape Town Spurs-Seven Stars merger; [[Mother City F.C.]]. However, unlike the planning and resources that went into establishing Ajax Cape Town, Mother City came into existence in a far more rushed manner with nowhere near the resources or technical input of Ajax Cape Town. The result was a club that set as yet unbroken records for fewest wins, most goals conceded and fewest points in a league season. The club was relegated with ease and would cease to exist a mere 3 years after its establishment.\n* [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]] club [[Free State Stars F.C.|Qwa Qwa Stars]] changed their name to [[Free State Stars F.C.]] in order to broaden their appeal.\n\n==Season summary==\n\n[[Mamelodi Sundowns]] clinched a record third successive [[Premier Soccer League]] title when they romped home in first place at the end of the 1999-2000 season. After a nail-biting finish to the [[Premier Soccer League 1998-99|1998-99 season]] that saw Sundowns and [[Kaizer Chiefs F.C.|Kaizer Chiefs]] finish level on points, Sundowns had a much easier time securing the title this time around, finishing comfortably ahead of second placed [[Orlando Pirates]]. Chiefs, who had finished runners-up for the past three seasons, fell back to third place as they found themselves unable to replicate their performance from the 1998-99 season.\n\nThe newly created [[Ajax Cape Town F.C.|Ajax Cape Town]] had a strong season, finishing in fourth place on 53 points, with inaugural PSL champions [[Manning Rangers]] just behind them in fifth. [[Wits University F.C.|Wits University]], [[Jomo Cosmos]] and [[Hellenic F.C.|Hellenic]] rounded out the top eight. Newly promoted [[Maritzburg United F.C.|Tembisa Classic]] had a strong debut season, finishing in a respectable 9th place.\n\nPopular [[KwaZulu Natal]] club [[AmaZulu F.C.|AmaZulu]] and the newly formed [[Mother City F.C.|Mother City]] found themselves at the wrong end of the table. After years of just avoiding the drop by finishing 14th, 15th & 14th over the course of the past three seasons, AmaZulu's luck finally ran out as they were relegated. Heading into the final day of the season AmaZulu found themselves level on points with [[African Wanderers]] - who had only just returned to the PSL following their relegation at the end of the [[Premier Soccer League 1997-98|1997-98 season]] - with only goal difference separating them; AmaZulu's goal difference of -11 keeping them above African Wanderers who had a goal difference of -13. All AmaZulu had to do was equal or better African Wanderers' result on the final day of the season. For their final fixtures neither team had it easy as AmaZulu had to travel to face Ajax Cape Town while Wanderers had to host runners-up Orlando Pirates. In a thrilling result African Wanderers managed to put four goals past Pirates in a magnificent 4-3 win while AmaZulu suffered an agonising 2-1 defeat, putting both teams level on goal difference but moving Wanderers onto 39 points, three ahead of AmaZulu and into safety.\n\nMother City however never looked like they would survive. By season's end they had set PSL records for the fewest wins (2), most defeats (28), most goals conceded (85), worst goal difference (-63) and fewest points (10). Mother City conceded 4-goals or more on 6 occasions and twice conceded 6. Following their relegation the club would not return to the PSL and would only last for two more seasons in the [[National First Division]] before shutting down.\n\nThe 1999-2000 season was characterised by prolific goalscoring, with an average of 2.69 goals per match. Of particular interest were the games between Classic and Hellenic which featured a startling 15 goals. Classic had suffered a 6-0 drubbing at the hands of Hellenic on 14 August 1999 but returned home and defeated Hellenic in a thrilling 9-goal affair, running out 5-4 winners. Other high scoring games included SuperSport United's 7-2 rout of AmaZulu in Mthatha and the pulsating 4-4 draw in [[Bloemfontein]] between Bloemfontein Celtic and Manning Rangers.\n\n==Final table==\n\n{{fb cl header}}\n|- bgcolor=#ACE1AF\n|1||align=left|[[Mamelodi Sundowns F.C.|Mamelodi Sundowns]] '''(C)'''\n|34||23||6||5||68||34||+34||'''75'''||<small>[[2001 CAF Champions League#First Round|2001 CAF Champions League First Round]]</small><sup><span style=\"color:red;\">1</span></sup>\n|-\n|2||align=left|[[Orlando Pirates]]\n|34||18||10||6||72||36||+36||'''64'''||<small>Withdrew from participating in the [[2001 CAF Cup]]</small><sup><span style=\"color:blue;\">2</span></sup>\n|- bgcolor=#97DEFF\n|3||align=left|[[Kaizer Chiefs F.C.|Kaizer Chiefs]]\n|34||16||12||6||40||22||+18||'''60'''||<small>[[2001 African Cup Winners' Cup#First Round|2001 African Cup Winners' Cup First Round]]</small><sup><span style=\"color:red;\">1</span></sup>\n|- bgcolor=#EEE8AA\n|4||align=left|[[Ajax Cape Town F.C.|Ajax Cape Town]]\n|34||15||8||11||43||39||+4||'''53'''||<small>[[2001 CAF Cup#First round|2001 CAF Cup First Round]]</small><sup><span style=\"color:red;\">1</span></sup> <sup>&</sup> <sup><span style=\"color:blue;\">2</span></sup>\n|-\n|5||align=left|[[Manning Rangers]]\n|34||14||10||10||54||49||+5||'''52'''\n|-\n|6||align=left|[[Wits University F.C.|Wits University]]\n|34||12||15||7||36||29||+7||'''51'''\n|-\n|7||align=left|[[Jomo Cosmos]]\n|34||12||14||8||49||32||+17||'''50'''\n|-\n|8||align=left|[[Hellenic F.C.|Hellenic]]\n|34||13||8||13||62||45||+17||'''47'''\n|-\n|9||align=left|[[Maritzburg United F.C.|Tembisa Classic]]\n|34||13||5||16||48||57||-9||'''44'''\n|-\n|10||align=left|[[SuperSport United F.C.|SuperSport United]]\n|34||11||10||13||51||48||+3||'''43'''\n|-\n|11||align=left|[[Santos Football Club (South Africa)|Santos]]\n|34||9||16||9||44||64||-20||'''43'''\n|-\n|12||align=left|[[Moroka Swallows F.C.|Moroka Swallows]]\n|34||11||9||14||39||52||-13||'''42'''\n|-\n|13||align=left|[[Bush Bucks F.C.
