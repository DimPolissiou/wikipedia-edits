Several tornadoes were responsible for prompting [[tornado emergency|tornado emergencies]], including the first one to be issued by the [[National Weather Service]] in Charleston, South Carolina. A large [[squall line]] formed and tracked through the [[Mid-Atlantic (United States)|mid-Atlantic]] on April 13, prompting more [[tornado warning]]s and [[Tornado watch|watches]]. Fifteen total watches were produced during the course of the event, two of which were designated [[Particularly Dangerous Situation]]s. \n\nThroughout the two-day outbreak a total of 132&nbsp;tornadoes touched down across 10&nbsp;states, inflicting widespread and locally catastrophic damage. Fourteen of these became intense tornadoes (EF3 or EF4 intensity). The strongest tornado occurred in southern Mississippi, producing estimated winds of {{convert|190|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, reaching a width of {{convert|2.25|mi|km|abbr=on}}, and causing eight deaths. With a total of 32 tornado related fatalities, this was the deadliest tornado outbreak since [[tornado outbreak of April 27\u201330, 2014|April 27\u201330, 2014]]. To assist with recovery efforts, governors of five states declared a [[state of emergency]].

EF2 to EF3 damage continued as the tornado moved through rural areas to the northeast of Seminary, moving into [[Jones County, Mississippi|Jones County]] and crossing [[U.S. Route 84]]. Damage along this portion of the path consisted of mobile homes, metal buildings, outbuildings, and poultry barns destroyed, along with frame homes sustaining roof and exterior wall loss. Massive tree damage continued to occur, with large swaths of trees snapped, denuded, and partially debarked. It then moved through the small town of [[Soso, Mississippi|Soso]], causing major damage to homes, churches, and the local fire department building.

After crossing [[Mississippi Highway 15]] and entering [[Jasper County, Mississippi|Jasper County]], the tornado intensified back to low-end EF4 intensity as it struck the community of [[Moss, Mississippi|Moss]], where nearly every structure in town was damaged and numerous homes were destroyed. Several of these homes were flattened with only piles of rubble remaining, and one was left with only a single closet standing. Half of the First Baptist Church was leveled, and a pickup truck was thrown hundreds of yards and completely destroyed. Continuing northeast of Moss, the tornado began to weaken, producing EF1 to EF2 damage. Several homes and mobile homes had metal roofing peeled back or decking exposed. Large swaths of trees were snapped for several miles, including some along Interstate 59 between the [[Heidelburg, Mississippi|Heidelburg]] and Vossburg exits. Barns and outbuildings were destroyed along this segment of the path, and some power poles were snapped. Northeast of [[Vossburg, Mississippi|Vossburg]], the tornado weakened further, inflicting EF1 damage to trees and a mobile home. EF1 damage continued as the tornado crossed into [[Clarke County, Mississippi|Clarke County]] and struck the town of [[Pachuta, Mississippi|Pachuta]]. Damage in Pachuta consisted of trees downed and moderate roof damage. North-northeast of Pachuta, the tornado finally dissipated at County Road 320, after causing some additional minor EF0 tree limb damage.

Northeast of this point, the tornado became violent and expanded to one mile wide, as EF4-level tree damage began to occur along Pitts Lane and Reese Road. Every tree in the path in this area was snapped or sustained severe debarking, and another mobile home was obliterated, with the damage to that structure rated EF3. A house farther away from the center of the path sustained severe roof damage as well. EF4 tree damage continued to the northeast through the intersection of Graves Key Road and Harper Road, and one tree was found with a metal mobile home frame wrapped around it. Four people were killed in this area as Mama Dee's Cafe, a small restaurant housed in a cinder-block building, was leveled and swept away, with the concrete slab foundation largely swept clean of debris.

EF2 to EF3 damage continued as the tornado moved through rural areas to the northeast of Seminary, moving into [[Jones County, Mississippi|Jones County]] and crossing [[U.S. Route 84]]. Damage along this portion of the path consisted of mobile homes, metal buildings, outbuildings, and poultry barns destroyed, along with frame homes sustaining roof and exterior wall loss. Massive tree damage continued to occur, with large swaths of trees snapped, denuded, and partially debarked. It then moved through the small town of [[Soso, Mississippi|Soso]], causing major damage to homes, churches, and the local fire department building. Numerous trees were snapped throughout town, and several mobile homes were destroyed. Most of the damage in Soso was rated EF3, though a small area of low-end EF4 damage occurred along [[Mississippi Highway 28]], where a concrete block convenience store was completely leveled.<ref name=\"JAN_0412\" /> The tornado weakened to EF2 intensity as it continued to the northeast of Soso, where more trees were downed and numerous mobile homes were destroyed. Metal buildings were damaged, and outbuildings were destroyed as well. A house along Matthews Road had much of its roof torn off, and a nearby vehicle was rolled down a hill and badly mangled. After crossing [[Mississippi Highway 15]] and entering [[Jasper County, Mississippi|Jasper County]], the tornado intensified back to low-end EF4 intensity as it struck the community of [[Moss, Mississippi|Moss]], where nearly every structure in town was damaged and numerous homes were destroyed. Several of these homes were flattened with only piles of rubble remaining, and one was left with only a single closet standing. Half of the First Baptist Church was leveled, and a pickup truck was thrown hundreds of yards and completely destroyed. Continuing northeast of Moss, the tornado began to weaken, producing EF1 to EF2 damage. Several homes and mobile homes had metal roofing peeled back or decking exposed. Large swaths of trees were snapped for several miles, including some along Interstate 59 between the [[Heidelburg, Mississippi|Heidelburg]] and Vossburg exits. Barns and outbuildings were destroyed along this segment of the path, and some power poles were snapped. Northeast of [[Vossburg, Mississippi|Vossburg]], the tornado weakened further, inflicting EF1 damage to trees and a mobile home. EF1 damage continued as the tornado crossed into [[Clarke County, Mississippi|Clarke County]] and struck the town of [[Pachuta, Mississippi|Pachuta]]. Damage in Pachuta consisted of trees downed and moderate roof damage. North-northeast of Pachuta, the tornado finally dissipated at County Road 320, after causing some additional minor EF0 tree limb damage.

It was made by a group of teachers from Norton Park School, who filmed some of their pupils playing street games, accompanied by traditional children's songs, at various locations in the city. It documented an oral tradition which has all but vanished in the half century since it was made.\n\n== Norton Park School ==\n[[File:Norton Park School and Easter Road Stadium.JPG|thumb|Norton Park School beside [[Easter Road Stadium|Easter Road]] football stadium]]\nNorton Park was an inner-city Junior Secondary School (equivalent to a [[Secondary Modern School]] in England at the time). The old [[burgh]] boundary between Edinburgh and [[Leith]] runs through the school grounds. The building still stands beside the [[Easter Road Stadium|Easter Road]] football stadium of [[Hibernian F.C.]] but is now a business conference centre. At the time of filming the area was a more industrial environment than now with numerous industrial premises including two major printing works, a large engineering works, a timber merchant's yard and a tobacco factory surrounded by tenement buildings built chiefly for [[artisan]]s in the second half of the nineteenth century.\n\nThe songs were collected by James T R Ritchie, a science teacher at the school, assisted by his colleagues Nigel McIsaac and Raymond Townsend, both art teachers. McIsaac produced rough [[storyboard]] sketches and calculated timings to provide the shooting script. The camera was operated by [[William Geissler]] and Townsend. The songs were recorded subsequently, with no re-takes necessary, and [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|'dubbed']] onto the film. According to the film's production notes, the Scottish poet [[Norman McCaig]] supplied the whistling heard on the soundtrack.<ref name=\"ssa.nls.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://ssa.nls.uk/film.cfm?fid=0799 |title=Full record for ''The Singing Street'' |publisher=[[Scottish Screen Archive]]|accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref> The 'Norton Park Group' then shot, cut and edited the film themselves, while taking advice from the [[Scottish Film Council]], the [[British Film Institute]] and Campbell Harper Films.<ref name=\"Cityof\">City of Edinburgh Museums and Galleries video booklet, Albyn Press, 1993</ref>\n\n[[File:Easter Road in December.JPG|thumb|The densely populated Easter Road area of Edinburgh]]\nThe film was shot in monochrome and lasts 18 minutes. Its stated purpose was \"to show how the singing games are played \u2013 in their natural setting. Beginning in the morning and ending with the dusk\u2026\"<ref name=\"Cityof\" />\n\nThe cast comprised around 60 pupils, of between 11 and 14 years of age. Shooting took place on six days during the school Easter holiday break in 1950 in local locations including streets and backgreens (communal drying areas) off [[Easter Road, Edinburgh|Easter Road]], and streets around the [[Calton Hill]] and in the [[Canongate]], West Bow and the [[Grassmarket]]. The Shore, [[Leith]] appears briefly at the end of the film.\n\nMost of the games revolve around the themes of love and death (courtship and bereavement), expressed in rhymes passed down the generations by word of mouth. Notes accompanying the issue of the film on video in 1993 explain that \"The rhymes\u2026vary from street to street and change from day to day. (\u2026) What is old seldom dies yet there is always something new appearing. The word is accepted and the poetry is kept alive. No one asks: What does that mean?\".<ref name=\"Cityof\" /> The songs in the film are accompanied by various skipping and ball games.\n\nThe film is subtitled ''A Merry-Ma Tanzie'' which is a traditional Scottish wedding game sung to the same tune as ''Here we go round the Mulberry Bush''. Girls join hands in a circle and, at a chosen point, fall to the ground. One player, usually chosen for her slowness in falling, leaves the circle and confides the name of the one she intends to marry to a close friend. The circle members sing verses to guess his name and, on approval, the girl and her friend, as a bridal couple, are welcomed into the circle through \"high arches\" and kiss. The first recorded mention of the game occurs in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' published in Edinburgh in August 1821.<ref>I and P Opie, The Singing Game, OUP 1985, pp.148 and 152; Many theories exist as to the origin of the name, but the Opies give prominence to the following. \"In 1868 an observer in Glasgow was certain the words were 'And round about Mary matan'sy'; and remarked on the way children bent to the ground when they repeated them, in the way children did in Antwerp when playing a similar game, to the same tune, with the figure of the Madonna in the centre. The line might therefore, he suggested, mean 'Round about Mary our matins say', and certainly children at this time moved round slowly, rather than briskly, and curtsied to the ground rather than fell to the ground, the one who last regained her position being the one who was required to say her sweetheart's name.\" If that supposition is correct, it is evidence of the game's origins in Scotland's pre-Reformation Catholic past.</ref> In one variation girls form a circle with a player in the middle covering her face while the circle moves slowly round her. The circle sing verses with the girl's name and try to guess her suitor's name. If her true love is revealed, the girl has to show her face and choose a partner. The circle then opens as a gate to allow the bridal couple to pass through. In the variation shown in the film (''The Golden City'') friends of the girl inside the circle quickly confide with each other to determine her intended sweetheart and name him in the song. She then chooses a partner from the circle in his place to form the bridal couple.\n[[File:Crawford Bridge from Bothwell Street.JPG|thumb|The Crawford Bridge (named after a city councillor) is a footbridge over a now rarely used railway line. It appears several times in the first half of the film. It points directly to Norton Park School which can be seen in the distance.]]\nThe film captured a slice of children's history shortly before playing in the street began to decline with the advent of mass television ownership in Britain, though games seen in the film continued to be played in school playgrounds throughout the 1950s and into the 1960s. The 1950s were a time when the Edinburgh Corporation (town council) had designated many inner-city streets \"children's play areas\", requesting vehicle drivers to avoid them from the end of the school day until sunset.<ref>One of the official \"children's play area\" street signs off Easter Road can be seen at [http://www.edinphoto.org.uk/0_street_e/0_street_views_-_east_thomas_street_021836.htm Edinphoto]</ref> Also, as James Ritchie pointed out in the decade after the film, [[slum clearance]] soon transformed the surroundings in which most children grew up: \"The tenement-factory conglomeration produced by accident a playing environment of exciting variety: and unless present-day architecture incorporates such ideas, it's dead from the start. The houses in modern schemes are so dull and unmysterious. They have no 'Unknown Corners' such as haunted painters like [[James Pryde]]...\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Ritchie |first=J |title=Golden City |year=1999|edition=reprint|publisher=Mercat Press |location=Edinburgh |isbn=1873644 973 |page=2}}</ref>\n\nThe film won critical acclaim when it was shown at the [[Union Internationale du Cin\u00e9ma|UNICA]] Festival in Barcelona Film Festival in 1952.<ref name=\"ssa.nls.uk\"/> [[John Grierson]], \"father of the documentary\", wrote that it was \"the best amateur film I ever saw...

It was made by a group of teachers from Norton Park School, who filmed some of their pupils playing street games, accompanied by traditional children's songs, at various locations in the city. It documented an oral tradition which has all but vanished in the half century since it was made.\n\n== Norton Park School ==\n[[File:Norton Park School and Easter Road Stadium.JPG|thumb|Norton Park School beside [[Easter Road]] football stadium]]\nNorton Park was an inner-city Junior Secondary School (equivalent to a [[Secondary Modern School]] in England at the time). The old [[burgh]] boundary between Edinburgh and [[Leith]] runs through the school grounds. The building still stands beside the [[Easter Road]] football stadium of [[Hibernian F.C.]] but is now a business conference centre. At the time of filming the area was a more industrial environment than now with numerous industrial premises including two major printing works, a large engineering works, a timber merchant's yard and a tobacco factory surrounded by tenement buildings built chiefly for [[artisan]]s in the second half of the nineteenth century.\n\nThe songs were collected by James T R Ritchie, a science teacher at the school, assisted by his colleagues Nigel McIsaac and Raymond Townsend, both art teachers. McIsaac produced rough [[storyboard]] sketches and calculated timings to provide the shooting script. The camera was operated by [[William Geissler]] and Townsend. The songs were recorded subsequently, with no re-takes necessary, and [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|'dubbed']] onto the film. According to the film's production notes, the Scottish poet [[Norman McCaig]] supplied the whistling heard on the soundtrack.<ref name=\"ssa.nls.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://ssa.nls.uk/film.cfm?fid=0799 |title=Full record for ''The Singing Street'' |publisher=[[Scottish Screen Archive]]|accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref> The 'Norton Park Group' then shot, cut and edited the film themselves, while taking advice from the [[Scottish Film Council]], the [[British Film Institute]] and Campbell Harper Films.<ref name=\"Cityof\">City of Edinburgh Museums and Galleries video booklet, Albyn Press, 1993</ref>\n\n[[File:Easter Road in December.JPG|thumb|The densely populated Easter Road area of Edinburgh]]\nThe film was shot in monochrome and lasts 18 minutes. Its stated purpose was \"to show how the singing games are played \u2013 in their natural setting. Beginning in the morning and ending with the dusk\u2026\"<ref name=\"Cityof\" />\n\nThe cast comprised around 60 pupils, of between 11 and 14 years of age. Shooting took place on six days during the school Easter holiday break in 1950 in local locations including streets and backgreens (communal drying areas) off [[Easter Road, Edinburgh|Easter Road]], and streets around the [[Calton Hill]] and in the [[Canongate]], West Bow and the [[Grassmarket]]. The Shore, [[Leith]] appears briefly at the end of the film.\n\nMost of the games revolve around the themes of love and death (courtship and bereavement), expressed in rhymes passed down the generations by word of mouth. Notes accompanying the issue of the film on video in 1993 explain that \"The rhymes\u2026vary from street to street and change from day to day. (\u2026) What is old seldom dies yet there is always something new appearing. The word is accepted and the poetry is kept alive. No one asks: What does that mean?\".<ref name=\"Cityof\" /> The songs in the film are accompanied by various skipping and ball games.\n\nThe film is subtitled ''A Merry-Ma Tanzie'' which is a traditional Scottish wedding game sung to the same tune as ''Here we go round the Mulberry Bush''. Girls join hands in a circle and, at a chosen point, fall to the ground. One player, usually chosen for her slowness in falling, leaves the circle and confides the name of the one she intends to marry to a close friend. The circle members sing verses to guess his name and, on approval, the girl and her friend, as a bridal couple, are welcomed into the circle through \"high arches\" and kiss. The first recorded mention of the game occurs in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' published in Edinburgh in August 1821.<ref>I and P Opie, The Singing Game, OUP 1985, pp.148 and 152; Many theories exist as to the origin of the name, but the Opies give prominence to the following. \"In 1868 an observer in Glasgow was certain the words were 'And round about Mary matan'sy'; and remarked on the way children bent to the ground when they repeated them, in the way children did in Antwerp when playing a similar game, to the same tune, with the figure of the Madonna in the centre. The line might therefore, he suggested, mean 'Round about Mary our matins say', and certainly children at this time moved round slowly, rather than briskly, and curtsied to the ground rather than fell to the ground, the one who last regained her position being the one who was required to say her sweetheart's name.\" If that supposition is correct, it is evidence of the game's origins in Scotland's pre-Reformation Catholic past.</ref> In one variation girls form a circle with a player in the middle covering her face while the circle moves slowly round her. The circle sing verses with the girl's name and try to guess her suitor's name. If her true love is revealed, the girl has to show her face and choose a partner. The circle then opens as a gate to allow the bridal couple to pass through. In the variation shown in the film (''The Golden City'') friends of the girl inside the circle quickly confide with each other to determine her intended sweetheart and name him in the song. She then chooses a partner from the circle in his place to form the bridal couple.\n[[File:Crawford Bridge from Bothwell Street.JPG|thumb|The Crawford Bridge (named after a city councillor) is a footbridge over a now rarely used railway line. It appears several times in the first half of the film. It points directly to Norton Park School which can be seen in the distance.]]\nThe film captured a slice of children's history shortly before playing in the street began to decline with the advent of mass television ownership in Britain, though games seen in the film continued to be played in school playgrounds throughout the 1950s and into the 1960s. The 1950s were a time when the Edinburgh Corporation (town council) had designated many inner-city streets \"children's play areas\", requesting vehicle drivers to avoid them from the end of the school day until sunset.<ref>One of the official \"children's play area\" street signs off Easter Road can be seen at [http://www.edinphoto.org.uk/0_street_e/0_street_views_-_east_thomas_street_021836.htm Edinphoto]</ref> Also, as James Ritchie pointed out in the decade after the film, [[slum clearance]] soon transformed the surroundings in which most children grew up: \"The tenement-factory conglomeration produced by accident a playing environment of exciting variety: and unless present-day architecture incorporates such ideas, it's dead from the start. The houses in modern schemes are so dull and unmysterious. They have no 'Unknown Corners' such as haunted painters like [[James Pryde]]...\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Ritchie |first=J |title=Golden City |year=1999|edition=reprint|publisher=Mercat Press |location=Edinburgh |isbn=1873644 973 |page=2}}</ref>\n\nThe film won critical acclaim when it was shown at the [[Union Internationale du Cin\u00e9ma|UNICA]] Festival in Barcelona Film Festival in 1952.<ref name=\"ssa.nls.uk\"/> [[John Grierson]], \"father of the documentary\", wrote that it was \"the best amateur film I ever saw...

The cathedral city is [[Kristiansand]], Norway's fifth largest city. [[Kristiansand Cathedral]] serves as the seat of the presiding Bishop. The bishop since 2013 has been [[Stein Reinertsen]].  As of 1 January 2003, there were 347,324 members of the Church of Norway in the diocese.\n\n==History==\nIn 1125, the southern part of the [[Ancient Diocese of Bergen]] was split off as the [[Ancient Diocese of Stavanger]]. This new diocese stretched from the coast of [[Haugesund]] in the west to [[Gjernestangen]] between [[Ris\u00f8r]] and [[Krager\u00f8]], later the border stretched to [[Eidanger]] in the east. [[Stavanger]] was the [[cathedral]] city.  During the [[Protestant Reformation]], Norway became a Lutheran nation, establishing the [[Church of Norway]].  The diocesan boundaries remained the same.\n\nOver time, however, the diocese was reduced in size.  The parish of Eidfjord was transferred to the neighboring [[Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin]] in 1630. The regions of Valdres and Hallingdal were transferred to the [[Diocese of Oslo]] in 1631, but in exchange, the Diocese of Oslo had to give the upper part of [[Telemark]] and transfer that to the Diocese of Stavanger.<ref name=\"snl\" />\n\nIn 1682 [[Christian V]], King of [[Denmark-Norway]], issued an order that the Bishop and the Prefect of the Diocese of Stavanger were to be moved to the [[Kristiansand Cathedral|Christianssand Cathedral]], which had been consecrated in 1646 and which the King intended be perfect site for a new cathedral. The citizens of Stavanger protested, with the Prefect and the Bishop refusing to move and ignoring the order. It took two years before Christianssand was established as the new cathedral city. The diocese was renamed [[Diocese of Agder|Diocese of Christianssand]] ({{lang-no|\"Christiansands stift\"}}).<ref name=\"snl\" />\n\nOn 1 January 1925, the Diocese of Kristiansand was divided and all of the diocese located in [[Rogaland]] county was moved to the newly re-established [[Diocese of Stavanger]] and the [[Stavanger Cathedral]] regained its place as the seat of a bishop.  The Diocese of Agder continued to serve the counties of [[Aust-Agder]], [[Vest-Agder]], and [[Telemark]], although its name \"Diocese of Agder\" continued to be used until 2005 when the name \"Telemark\" was added to fully reflect the areas included in the diocese.<ref name=\"snl\" />\n\n==Kristiansand Cathedral==\n{{main|Kristiansand Cathedral}}\n[[Kristiansand Cathedral]] is the headquarters of the Diocese of Agder and Telemark and it is the main parish church for the city of [[Kristiansand]]. In 1682, there was a small church built of wood on site in Kristiansand. A new cathedral was built of stone and consecrated by Bishop [[Hans Munch (bishop)|Hans Munch]] in 1696, but burned down in 1734. The city's second cathedral was consecrated in 1738 by Bishop [[Jacob K\u00e6rup]]. This cathedral was destroyed in the city fire of 1880.\n\nThe present church is the third cathedral in the city and the fourth church in the town square in Kristiansand. The church was built after a drawing by the architect [[Henrik Thrap-Meyer]]. The church is described as [[neo-gothic]] style. The building is {{convert|70|m}} long and {{convert|39|m}} wide, and the tower is {{convert|70|m}} high. The Cathedral has a beautiful wooden ceiling and six beautiful stained glass windows with Biblical themes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinoybro.com/index.php/travel/travel-blog/521-kristiansand-cathedral|title=Kristiansand Cathedral|publisher=PinoyBro|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520065359/http://www.pinoybro.com/index.php/travel/travel-blog/521-kristiansand-cathedral|archivedate=2011-05-20}}</ref>\n\nIn order to exploit the ancient walls of the church that burned in 1880, the altar was placed against the west, while the churches generally tend to have the altar in the east.

The diocese was renamed [[Diocese of Agder|Diocese of Christianssand]] ({{lang-no|\"Christiansands stift\"}}).<ref name=\"snl\" />\n\nOn 1 January 1925, the Diocese of Kristiansand was divided and all of the diocese located in [[Rogaland]] county was moved to the newly re-established [[Diocese of Stavanger]] and the [[Stavanger Cathedral]] regained its place as the seat of a bishop.  The Diocese of Agder continued to serve the counties of [[Aust-Agder]], [[Vest-Agder]], and [[Telemark]], although its name \"Diocese of Agder\" continued to be used until 2005 when the name \"Telemark\" was added to fully reflect the areas included in the diocese.<ref name=\"snl\" />\n\n==Kristiansand Cathedral==\n{{main|Kristiansand Cathedral}}\n[[Kristiansand Cathedral]] is the headquarters of the Diocese of Agder and Telemark and it is the main parish church for the city of [[Kristiansand]]. In 1682, there was a small church built of wood on site in Kristiansand. A new cathedral was built of stone and consecrated by Bishop [[Hans Munch (bishop)|Hans Munch]] in 1696, but burned down in 1734. The city's second cathedral was consecrated in 1738 by Bishop [[Jacob K\u00e6rup]]. This cathedral was destroyed in the city fire of 1880.\n\nThe present church is the third cathedral in the city and the fourth church in the town square in Kristiansand. The church was built after a drawing by the architect [[Henrik Thrap-Meyer]]. The church is described as [[neo-gothic]] style. The building is {{convert|70|m}} long and {{convert|39|m}} wide, and the tower is {{convert|70|m}} high. The Cathedral has a beautiful wooden ceiling and six beautiful stained glass windows with Biblical themes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinoybro.com/index.php/travel/travel-blog/521-kristiansand-cathedral|title=Kristiansand Cathedral|publisher=PinoyBro|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520065359/http://www.pinoybro.com/index.php/travel/travel-blog/521-kristiansand-cathedral|archivedate=2011-05-20}}</ref>\n\nIn order to exploit the ancient walls of the church that burned in 1880, the altar was placed against the west, while the churches generally tend to have the altar in the east. Building work was completed on 1 February 1885. The church was consecrated on 18 March 1885 with [[Johan M.

Cr\u00f3nica translates as \u2018chronicle.\u2019 When I began writing in this style, in a terribly hot, humid Buenos Aires summer (February 2001), I was trying to capture some of the local flavor, the barrios and smells and sounds, the ways of being of the highly idiosyncratic, porte\u00f1o cityscape that I had begun to love\u2014to feel, even, more of a sense of belonging in than I\u2019d felt in almost any other place in the world\u2014but also found mysterious, frustrating, and sometimes hilarious, often all at once. I was writing as a kind of reminder to my close friend Pablo \u2018Hugo\u2019 Zambrano, who is from Spain, and had come to spend several weeks with us in Buenos Aires. Somehow, having a partner-in-crime, someone bilingual, yet foreign, decidedly non-Argentine spurred me to create an experimental text, kind of an amalgam, or [[mestizaje]], a blend of short story, reportage, and a bit of prose poetry, in the form of an e-mail letter, to remind Hugo of some of our adventures, on the eve of his return to Spain.\n\n:'''''Killer Cronicas: Bilingual Memories,''''' which I wrote for Hugo, was one of the first pieces I wrote in this style. I decided to title it\u2014and subsequent e-mail missives\u2014a cr\u00f3nica, inspired by the somewhat rough-hewn, journalistic, often fantastic first-hand accounts of the so-called New World sent \u201chome\u201d by the early Spanish conquistadores, and refashioned by modern-day counterparts such as the Mexicans Carlos Monsiv\u00e1is, Elena Poniatowska, Cristina Pacheco, and the Chilean [[Pedro Lemebel]], whose writing I admire.\n\n:This is a form that works for me.

She has said: \"Living in Buenos Aires, that gorgeous, turn of the century city in a country on the brink of (economic) collapse-home to many of the authors and artists I had long admired ([[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Julio Cort\u00e1zar]], [[Alfonsina Storni]], [[Alejandra Pizarnik]], and before them the foundational Romantics, [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]] and Echeverr\u00eda)-brought out a sense of self, displaced yet oddly at home, in a cultural, linguistic and even tangible way. In Buenos Aires, the fragmented parts of me, the voices, cultures, and places inside of me rubbed up against each other and struck fire. I called my email missives \"Cr\u00f3nicas,\" inspired by the somewhat rough-hewn, journalistic, often fantastic first-hand accounts sent \"home\" by the early conquistadores, and refashioned by modern-day counterparts such as [[Carlos Monsiv\u00e1is]], [[Elena Poniatowska]], and [[Cristina Pacheco]].\"<ref>Gamst, Erika. \"Bookshelf: Voices De Amor.\" Pomona Online Magazine.

Cr\u00f3nica translates as \u2018chronicle.\u2019 When I began writing in this style, in a terribly hot, humid Buenos Aires summer (February 2001), I was trying to capture some of the local flavor, the barrios and smells and sounds, the ways of being of the highly idiosyncratic, porte\u00f1o cityscape that I had begun to love\u2014to feel, even, more of a sense of belonging in than I\u2019d felt in almost any other place in the world\u2014but also found mysterious, frustrating, and sometimes hilarious, often all at once. I was writing as a kind of reminder to my close friend Pablo \u2018Hugo\u2019 Zambrano, who is from Spain, and had come to spend several weeks with us in Buenos Aires. Somehow, having a partner-in-crime, someone bilingual, yet foreign, decidedly non-Argentine spurred me to create an experimental text, kind of an amalgam, or [[mestizaje]], a blend of short story, reportage, and a bit of prose poetry, in the form of an e-mail letter, to remind Hugo of some of our adventures, on the eve of his return to Spain.\n\n:'''''Killer Cronicas: Bilingual Memories,''''' which I wrote for Hugo, was one of the first pieces I wrote in this style. I decided to title it\u2014and subsequent e-mail missives\u2014a cr\u00f3nica, inspired by the somewhat rough-hewn, journalistic, often fantastic first-hand accounts of the so-called New World sent \u201chome\u201d by the early Spanish conquistadores, and refashioned by modern-day counterparts such as the Mexicans Carlos Monsiv\u00e1is, Elena Poniatowska, Cristina Pacheco, and the Chilean [[Pedro Lemebel]], whose writing I admire.\n\n:This is a form that works for me. It gives me a sense of both containment (due to its relatively short length) and freedom, flexibility. Like Saturn and Jupiter, both of which are prominent in my natal chart! The cr\u00f3nica can vary widely in subject matter and style, but central to its project is a keenly observing eye/I; close attention to detail; a sense of humor (I almost always relieve some of my more emo-moments with laughter, often at my own expense); a sense of the fantastic or uncanny, even in the most everyday; and a desire to connect with an often explicitly-acknowledged interlocutor.\"<ref>\"Interview: Susana Ch\u00e1vez-Silverman Speaks with David Newman,\u201d in New Delta Review 27:1 (2010), pp. 223\u201333.</ref>\n\n==Works==\n\n===Books===\n* '''''Heartthrob: del Balboa Cafe al Apartheid and Back.'''''

In 1971, Williams and [[Raymond Washington]] formed an alliance establishing the Crips as the first major [[African-American]] [[street gang]] in [[South Central Los Angeles]]. Williams became the ''[[de facto]]'' leader and the prominent [[Boss (crime)|crime boss]] in South Central in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fortier |first=Zach |date=2015-02-09 |title=I Am Raymond Washington |url=https://www.amazon.com/Raymond-Washington-authorized-biography-original-ebook/dp/B00RUQEP6M |publisher=SSP |page=170 |isbn=978-0692359877 |access-date=2015-05-06 }}</ref> In 1979, Williams was convicted for the [[murder]] of four people during two [[robbery|robberies]], and was [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]]. The highly publicized trial of Williams and extensive appeals for [[pardon|clemency]] sparked debate on the status of the death penalty in California.\n\nOn December 13, 2005, Williams was executed by [[lethal injection]] after extensive appeals for clemency and a four-week [[stay of execution]] were both rejected by California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].\n\n==Early Years==\nTookie was born on December 29, 1953, in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], to a 17-year-old mother, and his family moved to [[New Orleans]]. His father abandoned the family when Williams was just a year old, and in 1959, Williams moved with his mother, Louisiana Williams, to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], and settled in the city's [[South Los Angeles|South Central]] region. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/crime-figure/stanley-tookie-williams|title=Stanley Tookie Williams|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref>\n\nAs Williams' mother worked several jobs to support them, Williams was a [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8704827.stm latchkey kid] and often engaged in mischief on the streets. He recalled that, as a child, he would hang out in abandoned houses and [[vacant lot]]s around his neighborhood in South Central where he would watch adults get drunk, [[Substance abuse|abuse drugs]], [[gamble]] and engage in dog fights. Williams stated that after the adults finished the dog fighting they would make the children fight each other, including himself. Williams began to participate in these [[Street fighting|street fights]] regularly as a child, where adults would bet on him and give him part of the proceeds for winning his fights. Williams was often the target of older bullies and street thugs in his neighborhood and, by the age of twelve, began carrying a [[switchblade]] in order to protect himself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asecurelife.com/self-defense-without-a-gun/|title=Best Concealable and Non-Lethal Self-Defense Weapons|date=2020-01-24|website=ASecureLife.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref> By the time Williams was a teenager he had gained a reputation in South Central's West Side as a vicious street fighter. Williams was expelled from [[George Washington Preparatory High School]] and was [[Blackballing|blackballed]] by several other high schools in the South Central area for fighting, and eventually began doing stints in [[Central Juvenile Hall]].\n\n==Gang activity==\nIn the late 1960s, [[juvenile crime]] increased in South Central as older gangs disbanded to join the [[Black Power Movement]], most notably as part of the [[Black Panther Party]], initially to protect black people from [[police brutality]] and corruption in the [[Los Angeles Police Department]]. Increasingly violent youth gangs formed in their place, which Williams initially despised as predatory, but because of his viciousness and willingness to fight older youths Williams earned the respect of many gangsters on the West Side. These gangs were mostly small-time neighborhood cliques that operated independently from each other, and leadership was not chosen but determined naturally. At age fifteen, Williams was invited into a small West Side clique after he befriended a local teenager, Donald \"Doc/Sweetback\" Archie. Williams soon earned the clique's respect after beating up one of their members for insulting his mother, and Williams became the unofficial leader of this clique as his violent reputation began to spread across South Central.\n\nIn 1969, at age sixteen, Williams was arrested in [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] for [[car theft]] and was sent to the Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall in [[Downey, California|Downey]]. While doing time at the detention center, Williams was introduced to [[Olympic weightlifting]] by the facility's gym coach, and this experience would spark an interest in [[bodybuilding]]. By his release from custody in early 1971, aged seventeen, Williams was physically bigger and stronger. According to Williams, upon his release from custody the review board asked him what he planned to do after being released, to which he replied \"being the leader of the biggest gang in the world.\"\n\nShortly after his release, Williams was approached by [[Raymond Washington]] at [[Washington Preparatory High School]] after hearing of Williams through a mutual friend of both young men. The friend had informed Washington of Williams' toughness and his willingness to fight members of larger, more established street gangs such as the L.A. Brims and the Chain Gang. According to Williams' account of the meeting, what struck him about Washington was that, besides being incredibly muscular, he and his cohort were dressed similar to Williams and his clique, wearing [[leather jackets]] with starched [[Levi's]] jeans and [[suspenders]]. Washington was from South Central's East Side, where he was a prominent gangster similar to Williams, and proposed they use their influence in their respective regions to form the larger [[Crips]] street gang. The purpose for creating the gang initially was to eliminate all street gangs and create a \"bull force\" [[neighborhood watch]] in South Central. Williams said: \"We started out\u2014at least my intent was to, in a sense, address all of the so-called neighboring gangs in the area and to put, in a sense\u2014I thought 'I can cleanse the neighborhood of all these, you know, marauding gangs.' But I was totally wrong. And eventually, we morphed into the monster we were addressing.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=05/11/30/153247 |title=A Conversation with Death Row Prisoner Stanley Tookie Williams from his San Quentin Cell |date=2005-11-30 |accessdate=2009-09-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115033333/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=05%2F11%2F30%2F153247 |archivedate=2007-11-15 }}</ref> Williams himself has stated that he founded the Crips not with the intention of eliminating other gangs, but to create a force powerful enough to protect local black people from racism, corruption and brutality at the hands of the police. At the time of the Crips' initial formation there were only three Crip sets: Washington's East Side Crips (later called East Coast Crips), Williams' West Side Crips, and the [[Compton, California|Compton]] Crips, led by a teenager named Mac Thomas. Williams formed the West Side Crips using his own influence, having befriended so many clique leaders and street thugs on the West Side. Washington, Williams and Thomas went on an aggressive and violent recruitment campaign throughout the black ghettos of Los Angeles, where they challenged the leaders of other gangs to one-on-one street fights. This process resulted in most gangs agreeing to join the Crips, and they were converted from small independent cliques into subgroups (''sets'') of a gang within the larger gang. The Crips quickly became the biggest street gang in South Central by both numbers and territory, however, numerous gangs still resisted losing their independence. These hold-out gangs formed a similar alliance to combat the Crips' influence, branding themselves as the [[Bloods]], and would become their fiercest rivals. Williams' former rivals, the L.A. Brims and the Chain Gang, joined the Blood alliance and became The Brims and The Inglewood Family Bloods, respectively.\n\nAs leader of the West Side Crips, Williams became the [[archetype]] of the new wave of Los Angeles gang members that would engage in random acts of violence against rival gang members and innocent people alike. Williams and his best friend, Curtis \"Buddha\" Morrow, would noticeably participate in these activities, striking fear into both street criminals and the residents of South Central, [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]], Inglewood, and Compton. Williams violent acts became legendary in southern Los Angeles' [[criminal underworld]] as on numerous occasions [[criminal charges]] brought against him ended in disarray, and [[prosecutors]] were unable to convict him due to lack of [[evidence]].\n\n==Crips leader==\nSoon after the foundation of the Crips, other leaders were either [[murdered]] or [[incarcerated]], and Williams was regarded as the ''[[de facto]]'' leader. In 1974, Raymond Washington was arrested for 2nd degree [[robbery]] and served five years in prison in [[Tracy, California|Tracy]], and soon after was murdered. On February 23, 1973, Curtis \"Buddha\" Morrow was shot to death in South Central following a petty argument. Mac Thomas was murdered under mysterious circumstances in the mid-1970s. Williams began to live an ironic [[double life]], where he worked in a legal job as an anti-gang [[School counselor|youth counselor]] in Compton<ref name=\"Morain1989\">{{cite news |last1=Morain |first1=Dan |title=Death Row Violence Part of Gang Power Struggle, San Quentin Officials Say |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-06-11-mn-3235-story.html |accessdate=9 February 2020 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=11 June 1989}}</ref> while also serving as the overboss for one of the largest gangs in Los Angeles. Williams would work as a counselor and study [[Sociology]] at [[Compton College]] during working hours, then spend his free time participating in numerous violent attacks against the Bloods.\n\nIn 1976, Williams was wounded in a [[drive-by shooting]] while sitting on the porch of his house in Compton. The shooting was committed by members of the Bloods, who shot at Williams from their car as he was letting his dog out for a walk in the evening. Attempting to avoid getting hit, Williams dove to the ground from the porch, but was shot in both of his legs. Williams was told by doctors that he would never walk again, but after a nearly year-long process of [[physical rehabilitation]] and an intense workout regimen, he ultimately regained his ability to walk. After the shooting, Williams re-developed a substance abuse problem when he began smoking [[Phencyclidine|PCP]]. Williams had begun dabbling in street drugs around the age of twelve, and as a preteen befriended a neighborhood [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]] who, in return for performing errands for him, would reward Williams with money and drugs, particularly [[Methaqualone|Quaaludes]], [[barbiturate]]s (then known as \"Red Devils\") or [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. Williams' personal life began to unravel: his maternal grandmother, with whom he was very close, died in 1976. He lost his counseling job in 1977 after being implicated in a robbery that was committed by two youths from a [[group home]] that Williams supervised. He was denied an opportunity to compete in an amateur bodybuilding contest after it was discovered that he was a gang leader (Williams would later appear on the 1970s variety show ''[[The Gong Show]]'' performing a [[posedown]] routine). Eventually his gangster lifestyle was beginning to take a mental toll on him, which included a brief stay in the [[Psychiatric hospital|psychiatric ward]] of a hospital after Williams experienced a bad [[Psychedelic experience|trip]] while high on PCP. With each of these setbacks Williams increasingly found himself using PCP, and supported his drug habit by intimidating and robbing [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealers]] in South Central.\n\n==Murder convictions==\nIn 1981, Williams was convicted of four counts of murder committed in two of three separate incidents. Williams always maintained his innocence, though subsequent court reviews concluded that there was no compelling reason to grant a [[retrial]].\n\nThe prosecution stated that Williams met with a man identified in court documents only as \"Darryl\" late on Tuesday evening, February 28, 1979.<ref name=\"LADAResponse\">{{cite web |url=http://da.co.la.ca.us/pdf/swilliams.pdf |title=Los Angeles County District Attorney's Response To Stanley Williams' Petition For Executive Clemency |date=2005-11-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060325011012/http://da.co.la.ca.us/pdf/swilliams.pdf |archivedate=2006-03-25 }}</ref> Williams introduced Darryl to friends of his, Alfred \"Blackie\" Coward and to Bernard \"Whitie\" Trudeau, and a short time after the initial meeting, Darryl, driving a brown [[station wagon]] and accompanied by Williams and Coward drove to the home of James Garret. Williams frequently stayed and kept some possessions at Garret's home, including a [[12-gauge]] [[shotgun]], and after about 10 minutes inside, Williams returned with the shotgun. Williams, Darryl and Coward then went to the home of Tony Sims in [[Pomona, California|Pomona]], where they discussed possible locations to obtain money through robbery. Afterwards, they went to another residence where Williams left the others and returned with a [[.22|.22-caliber]] [[pistol]], and placed it in the station wagon. Darryl and Williams entered the station wagon, Coward and Sims entered another vehicle, and then embarked on the [[freeway]]. Both vehicles exited the freeway at [[California State Route 72]] ([[Whittier Boulevard]]). The first incident occurred at a nearby [[National Convenience Stores|Stop-N-Go]] supermarket, where Darryl and Sims, at the request of Williams, entered the store with the apparent intention of robbing it. Darryl was carrying the .22 pistol that Williams had deposited in the station wagon earlier, and also had a [[rifle]] in the trunk of the car, along with two [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]] handguns. The clerk at the Stop-N-Go market, Johnny Garcia, had just finished mopping the floor when he observed a station wagon and the four men at the door to the market. Two of the men entered the market and one of the men went down an aisle, while the other approached Garcia asking for a [[cigarette]]. Garcia gave the man a cigarette and lit it for him. After approximately three to four minutes, the men left the market without carrying out the planned robbery.\n\nThe prosecution stated that next Coward and Sims followed Williams and Darryl to the 7-Eleven market located at 10437 Whittier Boulevard in [[Whittier, California|Whittier]], where the second incident occurred. The store clerk, 26-year-old Albert Lewis Owens, was sweeping the store's [[parking lot]] at 7:42&nbsp;p.m. when Darryl and Sims entered the 7-Eleven. Owens put the [[broom]] and [[dustpan]] he was using on the hood of his car and entered the store to serve them, and was followed in by Williams and Coward. As Darryl and Sims walked to the counter area to take money from the [[cash register]], Williams walked behind Owens, pulled the shotgun from under his jacket and told Owens to \"shut up and keep walking.\"<ref name=\"LADAResponse\" /> While pointing the shotgun at Owens' back, Williams directed him to a back storage room and ordered him to lie down. Coward said that he next heard the sound of a round being [[Chamber (firearms)|chambered]] into the shotgun, then heard a shot and [[glass]] breaking, followed by two more shots. Williams had shot at a [[Security surveillance camera|security monitor]] and then killed Owens, shooting him twice in the back at [[point-blank range]] as he lay prone on the storage room floor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/williams1003.htm|title=Stanley \"Tookie\" Williams #1003|website=Clarkprosecutor.org|accessdate=24 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe third incident occurred at the Brookhaven Motel located at 10411 South Vermont Avenue in South Central Los Angeles, which was run by 76-year-old Yen-Yi Yang and his wife, 63-year old Tsai-Shai C. Yang, their daughter, 43-year-old Yu-Chin Yang Lin, and their son, Robert. The Yangs were immigrants from [[Taiwan]], and Yu-Chin had recently joined them in the United States to run the hotel. According to the prosecutors, at approximately 5:00&nbsp;a.m. on March 11, 1979, Williams entered the Brookhaven Motel lobby and then broke down the door that led to the private office. Inside the office, Williams shot and killed Yen-Yi, Tsai-Shai, and Yu-Chin, after which he emptied the cash register and fled the scene. Robert, asleep with his wife in their bedroom at the motel, was awakened by the sound of somebody breaking down the door to the motel's office. Shortly thereafter he heard a female scream, followed by gunshots. Robert entered the motel office and found that his mother, his sister, and his father had all been shot, and the cash register was empty. The forensic pathologist testified that Yen-Yi Yang suffered two close range shotgun wounds, one to his left arm and abdomen, and one to the lower left chest. Tsai-Shai also received two close range wounds, one to the [[tailbone]], and the other to the front of the [[abdomen]], entering at the navel. Yu-Chin Yang Lin was shot once in the upper left face area at a distance of a few [[Foot (measure)|feet]]. Witnesses testified that Williams referred to the victims in conversations with friends as \"[[Buddha]]-heads.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=>Schwarzenegger, Arnold.

They didn't match my boots, nor eyewitnesses. Even the shotgun shells found conveniently at each crime scene didn't match the shotgun shells that I owned.\" However, the prosecution's firearms expert, a [[sheriff's deputy]], testified during trial that the shotgun shell recovered from the Brookhaven Motel crime scene matched test shells from the shotgun owned by Stanley Williams. No second examiner verified his findings, and the defense claimed this expert's methodology was \"[[junk science]] at best.\"<ref name=\"execclemency\">{{cite web |url=http://www.streetgangs.com/magazine/images/executiveclemency_reply.pdf |title=Reply Petition for Executive Clemency|website=streetgangs.com}}</ref> Williams' gun was found in the home of a couple with whom he occasionally stayed. According to the [[District Attorney]], the husband was undergoing sentencing for receiving stolen property and tried for [[extortion]]. Williams' lawyers have claimed that the District Attorney quashed a murder investigation in exchange for their testimony. The two shells recovered from the 7-Eleven crime scene were consistent with shells fired from this gun, with no exclusionary markings. The shell recovered from the Brookhaven Motel crime scene was conclusively matched to Williams' weapon \"to the exclusion of all other firearms.\"<ref name=\"LADAResponse\"/>\n\nCritics claim that although he renounced gangs and apologized for his role in co-founding the Crips, Williams continued to associate with Crips members in prison.

In 1971, Williams and [[Raymond Washington]] formed an alliance establishing the Crips as the first major [[African-American]] [[street gang]] in [[South Central Los Angeles]]. Williams became the ''[[de facto]]'' leader and the prominent [[Boss (crime)|crime boss]] in South Central in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fortier |first=Zach |date=2015-02-09 |title=I Am Raymond Washington |url=https://www.amazon.com/Raymond-Washington-authorized-biography-original-ebook/dp/B00RUQEP6M |publisher=SSP |page=170 |isbn=978-0692359877 |access-date=2015-05-06 }}</ref> In 1979, Williams was convicted for the [[murder]] of four people during two [[robbery|robberies]], and was [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]]. The highly publicized trial of Williams and extensive appeals for [[pardon|clemency]] sparked debate on the status of the death penalty in California.\n\nOn December 13, 2005, Williams was executed by [[lethal injection]] after extensive appeals for clemency and a four-week [[stay of execution]] were both rejected by California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].\n\n==Early Years==\nTookie was born on December 29, 1953, in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], to a 17-year-old mother, and his family moved to [[New Orleans]]. His father abandoned the family when Williams was just a year old, and in 1959, Williams moved with his mother, Louisiana Williams, to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], and settled in the city's [[South Los Angeles|South Central]] region. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/crime-figure/stanley-tookie-williams|title=Stanley Tookie Williams|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref>\n\nAs Williams' mother worked several jobs to support them, Williams was a [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8704827.stm latchkey kid] and often engaged in mischief on the streets. He recalled that, as a child, he would hang out in abandoned houses and [[vacant lot]]s around his neighborhood in South Central where he would watch adults get drunk, [[Substance abuse|abuse drugs]], [[gamble]] and engage in dog fights. Williams stated that after the adults finished the dog fighting they would make the children fight each other, including himself. Williams began to participate in these [[Street fighting|street fights]] regularly as a child, where adults would bet on him and give him part of the proceeds for winning his fights. Williams was often the target of older bullies and street thugs in his neighborhood and, by the age of twelve, began carrying a [[switchblade]] in order to protect himself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asecurelife.com/self-defense-without-a-gun/|title=Best Concealable and Non-Lethal Self-Defense Weapons|date=2020-01-24|website=ASecureLife.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref> By the time Williams was a teenager he had gained a reputation in South Central's West Side as a vicious street fighter. Williams was expelled from [[George Washington Preparatory High School]] and was [[Blackballing|blackballed]] by several other high schools in the South Central area for fighting, and eventually began doing stints in [[Central Juvenile Hall]].\n\n==Gang activity==\nIn the late 1960s, [[juvenile crime]] increased in South Central as older gangs disbanded to join the [[Black Power Movement]], most notably as part of the [[Black Panther Party]], initially to protect black people from [[police brutality]] and corruption in the [[Los Angeles Police Department]]. Increasingly violent youth gangs formed in their place, which Williams initially despised as predatory, but because of his viciousness and willingness to fight older youths Williams earned the respect of many gangsters on the West Side. These gangs were mostly small-time neighborhood cliques that operated independently from each other, and leadership was not chosen but determined naturally. At age fifteen, Williams was invited into a small West Side clique after he befriended a local teenager, Donald \"Doc/Sweetback\" Archie. Williams soon earned the clique's respect after beating up one of their members for insulting his mother, and Williams became the unofficial leader of this clique as his violent reputation began to spread across South Central.\n\nIn 1969, at age sixteen, Williams was arrested in [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] for [[car theft]] and was sent to the Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall in [[Downey, California|Downey]]. While doing time at the detention center, Williams was introduced to [[Olympic weightlifting]] by the facility's gym coach, and this experience would spark an interest in [[bodybuilding]]. By his release from custody in early 1971, aged seventeen, Williams was physically bigger and stronger. According to Williams, upon his release from custody the review board asked him what he planned to do after being released, to which he replied \"being the leader of the biggest gang in the world.\"\n\nShortly after his release, Williams was approached by [[Raymond Washington]] at [[Washington Preparatory High School]] after hearing of Williams through a mutual friend of both young men. The friend had informed Washington of Williams' toughness and his willingness to fight members of larger, more established street gangs such as the L.A. Brims and the Chain Gang. According to Williams' account of the meeting, what struck him about Washington was that, besides being incredibly muscular, he and his cohort were dressed similar to Williams and his clique, wearing [[leather jackets]] with starched [[Levi's]] jeans and [[suspenders]]. Washington was from South Central's East Side, where he was a prominent gangster similar to Williams, and proposed they use their influence in their respective regions to form the larger [[Crips]] street gang. The purpose for creating the gang initially was to eliminate all street gangs and create a \"bull force\" [[neighborhood watch]] in South Central. Williams said: \"We started out\u2014at least my intent was to, in a sense, address all of the so-called neighboring gangs in the area and to put, in a sense\u2014I thought 'I can cleanse the neighborhood of all these, you know, marauding gangs.' But I was totally wrong. And eventually, we morphed into the monster we were addressing.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=05/11/30/153247 |title=A Conversation with Death Row Prisoner Stanley Tookie Williams from his San Quentin Cell |date=2005-11-30 |accessdate=2009-09-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115033333/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=05%2F11%2F30%2F153247 |archivedate=2007-11-15 }}</ref> Williams himself has stated that he founded the Crips not with the intention of eliminating other gangs, but to create a force powerful enough to protect local black people from racism, corruption and brutality at the hands of the police. At the time of the Crips' initial formation there were only three Crip sets: Washington's East Side Crips (later called East Coast Crips), Williams' West Side Crips, and the [[Compton, California|Compton]] Crips, led by a teenager named Mac Thomas. Williams formed the West Side Crips using his own influence, having befriended so many clique leaders and street thugs on the West Side. Washington, Williams and Thomas went on an aggressive and violent recruitment campaign throughout the black ghettos of Los Angeles, where they challenged the leaders of other gangs to one-on-one street fights. This process resulted in most gangs agreeing to join the Crips, and they were converted from small independent cliques into subgroups (''sets'') of a gang within the larger gang. The Crips quickly became the biggest street gang in South Central by both numbers and territory, however, numerous gangs still resisted losing their independence. These hold-out gangs formed a similar alliance to combat the Crips' influence, branding themselves as the [[Bloods]], and would become their fiercest rivals. Williams' former rivals, the L.A. Brims and the Chain Gang, joined the Blood alliance and became The Brims and The Inglewood Family Bloods, respectively.\n\nAs leader of the West Side Crips, Williams became the [[archetype]] of the new wave of Los Angeles gang members that would engage in random acts of violence against rival gang members and innocent people alike. Williams and his best friend, Curtis \"Buddha\" Morrow, would noticeably participate in these activities, striking fear into both street criminals and the residents of South Central, [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]], Inglewood, and Compton. Williams violent acts became legendary in southern Los Angeles' [[criminal underworld]] as on numerous occasions [[criminal charges]] brought against him ended in disarray, and [[prosecutors]] were unable to convict him due to lack of [[evidence]].\n\n==Crips leader==\nSoon after the foundation of the Crips, other leaders were either [[murdered]] or [[incarcerated]], and Williams was regarded as the ''[[de facto]]'' leader. In 1974, Raymond Washington was arrested for 2nd degree [[robbery]] and served five years in prison in [[Tracy, California|Tracy]], and soon after was murdered. On February 23, 1973, Curtis \"Buddha\" Morrow was shot to death in South Central following a petty argument. Mac Thomas was murdered under mysterious circumstances in the mid-1970s. Williams began to live an ironic [[double life]], where he worked in a legal job as an anti-gang [[School counselor|youth counselor]] in Compton<ref name=\"Morain1989\">{{cite news |last1=Morain |first1=Dan |title=Death Row Violence Part of Gang Power Struggle, San Quentin Officials Say |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-06-11-mn-3235-story.html |accessdate=9 February 2020 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=11 June 1989}}</ref> while also serving as the overboss for one of the largest gangs in Los Angeles. Williams would work as a counselor and study [[Sociology]] at [[Compton College]] during working hours, then spend his free time participating in numerous violent attacks against the Bloods.\n\nIn 1976, Williams was wounded in a [[drive-by shooting]] while sitting on the porch of his house in Compton. The shooting was committed by members of the Bloods, who shot at Williams from their car as he was letting his dog out for a walk in the evening. Attempting to avoid getting hit, Williams dove to the ground from the porch, but was shot in both of his legs. Williams was told by doctors that he would never walk again, but after a nearly year-long process of [[physical rehabilitation]] and an intense workout regimen, he ultimately regained his ability to walk. After the shooting, Williams re-developed a substance abuse problem when he began smoking [[Phencyclidine|PCP]]. Williams had begun dabbling in street drugs around the age of twelve, and as a preteen befriended a neighborhood [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]] who, in return for performing errands for him, would reward Williams with money and drugs, particularly [[Methaqualone|Quaaludes]], [[barbiturate]]s (then known as \"Red Devils\") or [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. Williams' personal life began to unravel: his maternal grandmother, with whom he was very close, died in 1976. He lost his counseling job in 1977 after being implicated in a robbery that was committed by two youths from a [[group home]] that Williams supervised. He was denied an opportunity to compete in an amateur bodybuilding contest after it was discovered that he was a gang leader (Williams would later appear on the 1970s variety show ''[[The Gong Show]]'' performing a [[posedown]] routine). Eventually his gangster lifestyle was beginning to take a mental toll on him, which included a brief stay in the [[Psychiatric hospital|psychiatric ward]] of a hospital after Williams experienced a bad [[Psychedelic experience|trip]] while high on PCP. With each of these setbacks Williams increasingly found himself using PCP, and supported his drug habit by intimidating and robbing [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealers]] in South Central.\n\n==Murder convictions==\nIn 1981, Williams was convicted of four counts of murder committed in two of three separate incidents. Williams always maintained his innocence, though subsequent court reviews concluded that there was no compelling reason to grant a [[retrial]].\n\nThe prosecution stated that Williams met with a man identified in court documents only as \"Darryl\" late on Tuesday evening, February 28, 1979.<ref name=\"LADAResponse\">{{cite web |url=http://da.co.la.ca.us/pdf/swilliams.pdf |title=Los Angeles County District Attorney's Response To Stanley Williams' Petition For Executive Clemency |date=2005-11-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060325011012/http://da.co.la.ca.us/pdf/swilliams.pdf |archivedate=2006-03-25 }}</ref> Williams introduced Darryl to friends of his, Alfred \"Blackie\" Coward and to Bernard \"Whitie\" Trudeau, and a short time after the initial meeting, Darryl, driving a brown [[station wagon]] and accompanied by Williams and Coward drove to the home of James Garret. Williams frequently stayed and kept some possessions at Garret's home, including a [[12-gauge]] [[shotgun]], and after about 10 minutes inside, Williams returned with the shotgun. Williams, Darryl and Coward then went to the home of Tony Sims in [[Pomona, California|Pomona]], where they discussed possible locations to obtain money through robbery. Afterwards, they went to another residence where Williams left the others and returned with a [[.22|.22-caliber]] [[pistol]], and placed it in the station wagon. Darryl and Williams entered the station wagon, Coward and Sims entered another vehicle, and then embarked on the [[freeway]]. Both vehicles exited the freeway at [[California State Route 72]] ([[Whittier Boulevard]]). The first incident occurred at a nearby [[National Convenience Stores|Stop-N-Go]] supermarket, where Darryl and Sims, at the request of Williams, entered the store with the apparent intention of robbing it. Darryl was carrying the .22 pistol that Williams had deposited in the station wagon earlier, and also had a [[rifle]] in the trunk of the car, along with two [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]] handguns. The clerk at the Stop-N-Go market, Johnny Garcia, had just finished mopping the floor when he observed a station wagon and the four men at the door to the market. Two of the men entered the market and one of the men went down an aisle, while the other approached Garcia asking for a [[cigarette]]. Garcia gave the man a cigarette and lit it for him.

According to the prosecutors, at approximately 5:00&nbsp;a.m. on March 11, 1979, Williams entered the Brookhaven Motel lobby and then broke down the door that led to the private office. Inside the office, Williams shot and killed Yen-Yi, Tsai-Shai, and Yu-Chin, after which he emptied the cash register and fled the scene. Robert, asleep with his wife in their bedroom at the motel, was awakened by the sound of somebody breaking down the door to the motel's office. Shortly thereafter he heard a female scream, followed by gunshots. Robert entered the motel office and found that his mother, his sister, and his father had all been shot, and the cash register was empty. The forensic pathologist testified that Yen-Yi Yang suffered two close range shotgun wounds, one to his left arm and abdomen, and one to the lower left chest. Tsai-Shai also received two close range wounds, one to the [[tailbone]], and the other to the front of the [[abdomen]], entering at the navel.

Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the {{convert|6.1|mi|km|1|adj=on}} '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the {{convert|6.6|mi|km|1|adj=on}} '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a loop on both sides of the [[Willamette River]], crossing the river on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The route connects Portland's [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown]], [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]], [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], and [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of Portland's [[NS Line|first modern streetcar line]] on the west side. After several years of planning, the city council approved the Eastside Loop extension in 2008 and the line's groundbreaking was held the following year. The extension's first {{convert|3.3|mi|km}} opened between the Broadway Bridge and OMSI on September 22, 2012.

system. Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the {{convert|6.1|mi|km|1|adj=on}} '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the {{convert|6.6|mi|km|1|adj=on}} '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a loop on both sides of the [[Willamette River]], crossing the river on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The route connects Portland's [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown]], [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]], [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], and [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the Portland's [[NS Line|first modern streetcar line]] on the west side. After several years of planning, the city council approved the Eastside Loop extension in 2008 and the line's groundbreaking was held the following year. The extension's first {{convert|3.3|mi|km}} opened between the Broadway Bridge and OMSI on September 22, 2012. It was inaugurated by the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line''') service, which ran an additional {{convert|1.1|mi|km}} alongside the NS Line on 10th and 11th avenues. The CL Line re-branded in 2015 during the opening of Tilikum Crossing, which completed the streetcar loop with a southerly river crossing extension from OMSI to the South Waterfront.\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].
