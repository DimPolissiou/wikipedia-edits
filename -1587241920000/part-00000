Throughout the eleven hundred pages of the manuals, there are few mentions of democracy, human rights, or the rule of law. Instead, the manuals provide detailed techniques for infiltrating social movements, interrogating suspects, surveillance, maintaining military secrecy, recruiting and retaining spies, and controlling the population. While the excerpts released by the Pentagon are a useful and not misleading selection of the most egregious passages, the ones most clearly advocating torture, execution and blackmail, they do not provide adequate insight into the manuals' highly objectionable framework. In the name of defending democracy, the manuals advocate profoundly undemocratic methods.\"\n\nAfter this 1992 investigation, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] discontinued the use of the manuals, directed their recovery to the extent practicable, and destroyed the copies in the field. U.S. Southern Command advised governments in Latin America that the manuals contained passages that did not represent U.S. government policy, and pursued recovery of the manuals from the governments and some individual students.<ref name = \"fact\">{{cite journal\n| date =August 27, 1992  | title =Fact Sheet Concerning Training Manuals Containing Materials Inconsistent With U.S. Policy | journal =From the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense/Public Affairs Office\n}}</ref> Notably, [[David Addington]] and [[Dick Cheney]] retained personal copies of the training manuals.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wheeler |first=Marcy |url=http://www.salon.com/2009/05/18/torture_25/ |title=The 13 people who made torture possible |publisher=Salon.com |date=2009-05-18 |accessdate=2012-08-19}}</ref>\n\nSoon after, the U.S. Army issued the [[FM 34-52 Intelligence Interrogation]] manual, which was used until September 2006, when it was superseded by [[FM 2-22.3, Human Intelligence Collector Operations]].\n\n==CIA manuals==\n\n[[File:US Senate Report on CIA Detention Interrogation Program.pdf|thumb|The [[Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture|US Senate Report on CIA Detention and Interrogation Program]] that details the use of torture]]\n\nThe first manual, \"KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation\", dated July 1963, is the source of much of the material in the second manual.

Interrogation rooms should be windowless, soundproof, dark and without toilets.\n\nThe manuals advise that torture techniques can backfire and that the threat of pain is often more effective than pain itself. The manuals describe coercive techniques to be used \"to induce psychological regression in the subject by bringing a superior outside force to bear on his will to resist.\" These techniques include prolonged constraint, prolonged exertion, extremes of heat, cold, or moisture, deprivation of food or sleep, disrupting routines, solitary confinement, threats of pain, deprivation of sensory stimuli, hypnosis, and use of drugs or placebos.<ref name = \"para\">{{cite web\n| title = Kubark Counterintelligence Interrogation\n| work =parascope.com\n| url = http://www.parascope.com/articles/0397/kubark06.htm\n | accessdate=2006-09-05\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060615214021/http://www.parascope.com/articles/0397/kubark06.htm |archivedate = 2006-06-15}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1984 and 1985, after congressional committees began questioning training techniques being used by the CIA in Latin America, the 1983 manual went through substantial revision.

Throughout the eleven hundred pages of the manuals, there are few mentions of democracy, human rights, or the rule of law. Instead, the manuals provide detailed techniques for infiltrating social movements, interrogating suspects, surveillance, maintaining military secrecy, recruiting and retaining spies, and controlling the population. While the excerpts released by the Pentagon are a useful and not misleading selection of the most egregious passages, the ones most clearly advocating torture, execution and blackmail, they do not provide adequate insight into the manuals' highly objectionable framework. In the name of defending democracy, the manuals advocate profoundly undemocratic methods.\"\n\nAfter this 1992 investigation, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] discontinued the use of the manuals, directed their recovery to the extent practicable, and destroyed the copies in the field. U.S. Southern Command advised governments in Latin America that the manuals contained passages that did not represent U.S. government policy, and pursued recovery of the manuals from the governments and some individual students.<ref name = \"fact\">{{cite journal\n| date =August 27, 1992  | title =Fact Sheet Concerning Training Manuals Containing Materials Inconsistent With U.S. Policy | journal =From the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense/Public Affairs Office\n}}</ref> Notably, [[David Addington]] and [[Dick Cheney]] retained personal copies of the training manuals.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wheeler |first=Marcy |url=http://www.salon.com/2009/05/18/torture_25/ |title=The 13 people who made torture possible |publisher=Salon.com |date=2009-05-18 |accessdate=2012-08-19}}</ref>\n\nSoon after, the U.S. Army issued the [[FM 34-52 Intelligence Interrogation]] manual, which was used until September 2006, when it was superseded by [[FM 2-22.3, Human Intelligence Collector Operations]].\n\n==CIA manuals==\n\n[[File:US Senate Report on CIA Detention Interrogation Program.pdf|thumb|The [[Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture|US Senate Report on CIA Detention and Interrogation Program]] that details the use of torture]]\n\nThe first manual, \"KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation\", dated July 1963, is the source of much of the material in the second manual.

The manuals describe coercive techniques to be used \"to induce psychological regression in the subject by bringing a superior outside force to bear on his will to resist.\" These techniques include prolonged constraint, prolonged exertion, extremes of heat, cold, or moisture, deprivation of food or sleep, disrupting routines, solitary confinement, threats of pain, deprivation of sensory stimuli, hypnosis, and use of drugs or placebos.<ref name = \"para\">{{cite web\n| title = Kubark Counterintelligence Interrogation\n| work =parascope.com\n| url = http://www.parascope.com/articles/0397/kubark06.htm\n | accessdate=2006-09-05\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060615214021/http://www.parascope.com/articles/0397/kubark06.htm |archivedate = 2006-06-15}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1984 and 1985, after congressional committees began questioning training techniques being used by the CIA in Latin America, the 1983 manual went through substantial revision.

Dobbs ordered the producer to cut away from the speech and return to broadcast ''Moneyline''.<ref name=\"Madashell\"/> Dobbs was countermanded by Kaplan, who ordered CNN to return to the speech. Kaplan later said, \"Tell me what journalistic reason there was not to cover the president at Columbine soon after the shootings? Everyone else was doing it\".

There are two main ways for a regional airline to do business:\n# As an '''affiliated airline''', contracting with a [[Major carrier|major airline]], operating under their brand name (for example, [[Endeavor Air]] operates flights under the [[Delta Connection]] brand name for [[Delta Air Lines]]), and filling two roles: delivering passengers to the major airline's hubs from surrounding towns, and increasing frequency of service on mainline routes during times when demand does not warrant use of large aircraft, known as ''commuter flights''.\n# Operating as an '''independent airline''' under their own brand, mostly providing service to small and isolated towns, for whom the airline is the only reasonable link to a larger town. Examples of this are [[PenAir]], which links the remote [[Aleutian Islands]] to [[Anchorage, Alaska]], and [[Mokulele Airlines]], which operates in the Hawaiian islands.\n\nSmall regional airlines operating in the U.S. during the 1960s and 1970s were also known as '''commuter airlines''' and were classified as such in the [[Official Airline Guide]] (OAG).\n\n==History==\n[[Image:easternairways j41 g-majx arp.jpg|thumb|left|[[BAe Jetstream 41|British Aerospace Jetstream 41]] of the UK regional airline [[Eastern Airways]]]]\nRegional airlines began by operating propeller-driven aircraft over short routes, sometimes on flights of less than 100 miles. In the early days of commercial aviation few aircraft had ranges greater than this, and airlines were often formed to serve the area in which they formed. That is, there was no strong distinction between a regional airline and any other airline. This changed with the introduction of long-range aircraft, which led to the development of the flag carrier airlines, such as [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] and [[Trans-Canada Airlines]]. As the flag carriers grew in importance with increasing long-range passenger traffic, the smaller airlines found a niche flying passengers over short routes to the flag carrier's airport. This arrangement was eventually formalized, forming the regional airlines.\n\nThrough the 1960s and 1970s, war surplus designs, notably the [[DC-3]], were replaced by much more capable [[turboprop]] or [[Jet aircraft|jet]]-powered designs like the [[Fokker F27 Friendship]] or [[BAC One-Eleven]]. This extended the range of the regionals dramatically, causing a wave of consolidations between the now overlapping airlines.\n\nIn the United States, regional airlines were an important building block of today's passenger air system.  The U.S. Government encouraged the forming of regional airlines to provide services from smaller communities to larger towns, where air passengers could connect to a larger network.\n\nSome of the original regional airlines (then known as \"'''Local Service Airlines'''\") sanctioned by the [[Civil Aeronautics Board]] in the 1940s and 1950s include:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Allegheny Airlines]]\n* [[Bonanza Air Lines]]\n* [[Central Airlines]]\n* [[Frontier Airlines (1950-1986)|Frontier Airlines]]\n* [[Lake Central Airlines]]\n* [[Mohawk Airlines]]\n* [[North Central Airlines]]\n* [[Ozark Airlines]]\n* [[Pacific Air Lines]]\n* [[Pacific Southwest Airlines]]\n* [[Piedmont Airlines (1948-1989)|Piedmont Airlines]]\n* [[Southern Airways]]\n* [[Southwest Airways]] (renamed Pacific Air Lines in 1958)\n* [[Trans-Texas Airways]]\n* [[West Coast Airlines]]\n{{div col end}}\n\nNone of these airlines survive today; some airlines use these names today but are not the direct successors to the original airlines.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} A history and study of regional airlines was published by the Smithsonian Institution Press in 1994 under the title ''Commuter Airlines of the United States'', by [[R.E.G. Davies]] and [[I. E. Quastler]].\n\nOne of the first independently owned and managed airlines in the world that rebranded its aircraft to match a larger airline's brand was [[Air Alpes]] of France. During 1974, Air Alpes painted its newly delivered short range regional jets in the livery of [[Air France]].\n[[File:Fokker F27-300 PH-KFA NLM GRON 13.03.67 edited-3.jpg|thumb|NLM [[Fokker F.27|Fokker F.27 Friendship]] wearing the basic mainline livery of [[KLM Airlines]] however wearing the initial titles of NLM at Groningen in 1967.

Much like Air Alpes, these aircraft fed regional and higher yielding traffic to Air France and were also one of the first companies to adopt the now common practice of taking on the branding livery of a much large company, namely Air France; who they operated in association with.]] [[NLM Cityhopper|NLM]]'s KLM style branding does however pre-date the Air France efforts though by a number of years.\n<ref>http://library.fes.de/itf/pdf/z2776/1976/z2776_1976_12.pdf</ref>\n\nThe success of the \"rebranding\" or \"pseudo branding\" of a much smaller airline into the name recognition of a much larger one soon became clear as passenger numbers soared at Air Alpes, and it was soon decided to paint other aircraft such as the [[Fokker F-27]] into full Air France colours as well.\n\nSince the [[Airline Deregulation Act]] of 1978, the US federal government has continued support of the regional airline sector to ensure many of the smaller and more isolated [[rural]] communities remain connected to air services. This is encouraged with the [[Essential Air Service]] program<ref>[http://www.dot.gov/policy/aviation-policy/small-community-rural-air-service/essential-air-service \"Essential Air Service\"]. ''U.S. Department of Transportation''. Office of Aviation Policy. DOT. Tuesday, April 29, 2014. Retrieved Thursday, July 24, 2014.</ref> that subsidizes airline service to smaller U.S. [[community|communities]] and [[suburban]] centers, aiming to maintain year-round service.\n\nAlthough regional airlines in the United States are often viewed as small, not particularly lucrative \"no name\" subsidiaries of the mainline airlines, in terms of revenue, many would be designated [[major carrier|major airline carrier]] status based on the only actual definition of \"major airline,\" in the United States, the definition from the U.S. Department of Transportation. This definition is based solely on annual revenue and not on any other criterion such as average aircraft seating capacity, pilot pay, or number of aircraft in the fleet. It is common in the U.S. to incorrectly associate aircraft size with the Department of Transportation's designation of major, national, and regional airline. The only corollary is the Regional Airline Association, an industry trade group, defines \"regional airlines\" generally as \"...operat(ing) short and medium haul scheduled airline service connecting smaller communities with larger cities and connecting hubs. The airlines' fleet primarily consists of 19 to 68 seat turboprops and 30 to 100 seat regional jets.\" To be clear there is no distinction in the Department of Transportation definition of major, national and regional airlines by aircraft size. The definition is based on revenue. The clash of definitions has led to confusion in the media and the public.\n\nBeginning around 1985, a number of trends have become apparent. Regional aircraft are getting larger, faster, and are flying longer ranges. Additionally, the vast majority of regionals within the United States with more than ten aircraft within their fleet, have lost their individual identities and now serve only as feeders, to [[Alaska Airlines]],  [[American Airlines]],  [[Delta Air Lines]], or [[United Airlines]] major hubs. Regional  aircraft in the US have been getting slightly more comfortable with the addition of better [[ergonomics|ergonomically]] designed [[aircraft cabin]]s, and the addition of varying [[travel class]]es aboard these aircraft.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}  From small, less than 50-seat \"single-class cabin\" [[turboprop]], to [[turbofan]] [[Regional airliner#Regional jets|regional jet]] equipment, present day regional airlines provide [[aircraft]] such as the higher capacity [[Bombardier CRJ700|CRJ700]], [[Bombardier CRJ700|CRJ900]], [[Bombardier CRJ700|CRJ1000]] series of aircraft and the somewhat larger fuselage [[Embraer E-Jets]].  Some of these newer aircraft are capable of flying longer distances with comfort levels that rival and surpass the regional airline equipment of the past.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\nIn the early 1990s, much more advanced turboprop-powered, fuel efficient, and passenger friendly [[DC-3]] type replacement projects such as the 19 passenger [[Embraer/FMA CBA 123 Vector]] and the 34 seat [[Dornier 328]] were undertaken, but met little financial success, partly due to economic downturn in the airline industry resulting from the outbreak of hostilities when [[Iraq invasion of Kuwait|Iraq invaded Kuwait]]. Many of the regional airlines  operating turboprop equipment such as [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]]'s regional sister [[Comair]] airlines in the United States set the course for bypassing entirely the regional turboprops as they became the first to transition to an all-jet [[Regional jet#Regional jets|regional jet]] fleet.  To a lesser extent in Europe and the United Kingdom this transition, to  notably the [[Embraer]] or [[Canadair]] designs, was well advanced by the late  1990s. This evolution towards jet equipment, brought the independent regional airlines into direct competition with the major airlines, forcing additional consolidation.\n\nTo improve on their market penetration, larger airline [[holding company|holding companies]] rely on operators of smaller aircraft to provide service or added frequency service to some airports. Such airlines, often operating in [[code-share]] arrangements with mainline airlines, often completely repaint [http://www.eturbonews.com/7932/commuter-airlines-bring-anxiety-business-travelers] their aircraft fleet in the mainline airline's sub-brand livery.  For example, [[United Express]] regional airline partner [[CommutAir]] branded its entire fleet as United Express.  On the other hand, regional airline [[Gulfstream International Airlines]] does not brand their aircraft. When [[Colgan Air]] was still operating, they branded a handful of aircraft as Colgan Air, but most were branded as [[Continental Connection]], [[US Airways Express]] or [[United Express]], with whom it had contractual agreements.\n\n[[Image:Corporate5966.JPG|thumb|Typical seat map of a smaller [[regional airliner]] as is often flown by the regional airlines.

Sub-branding is pretty consistent throughout the airline industry of the United States, with all the regional airlines, mainline airlines, and the regional airline holding companies, as well as the mainline airlines holding companies participating.<ref>{{cite news|title=Frontline: Flying Cheap|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/flyingcheap/interviews/cohen.html#1|accessdate=1 June 2012|newspaper=Public Broadcasting Service|date=Feb 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Former regional airlines===\nPost airline deregulation, airlines sought added market share and to do this they sought partnerships with regional and small airlines to feed traffic into the airline hub.\n\nInitially these tie ups tended to use small 15 -19 seat aircraft, which did not have a reputation of passenger comfort, or safe reliable operations, by small often under capitalized tiny airline operators.\n\nTo create a common tie and what appeared to be seamless to the air traveler, major carriers marketed in advertising and soon had much smaller airlines paint their small and what was often described as puddle-jumper aircraft, in the image and branding colors of the much larger mainline partner. This was to give the appearance of reliability. Over time these regional aircraft grew in size as airline hubs expanded and competition dwindled among the major carriers.\n\nBelow is a list of many of the regional brands that evolved when regional

the major hubs, where they will connect for longer distance flights on the [[national airline]]s also known as [[flag carrier|flagship carriers]]'s, larger aircraft. The smallest regional carriers have become known as feeder airlines. The separate corporate structure allows the company to operate under different pay schedules, typically paying much less than their [[mainline (flight)|mainline]] owners.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\nMany large North American airlines, have established operational relationships with one or more regional airline companies. Their aircraft often use the [[aircraft livery]] for the company they are operating flights for.  These airlines can be [[subsidiary|subsidiaries]] of the major airline or fly under a [[code sharing]] agreement or operating through capacity purchase agreements, with the mainline parent company financing the aircraft for the regional airline, and then placing the aircraft with the regional for very little cost. An example would be [[Envoy Air]], which is fully owned by [[American Airlines Group]] and does business as [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]].\n\nMany of these large regional airlines have joined the lobbying group [[Regional Airline Association]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Members in the Regional Airline Assoc.|url=http://www.raa.org/AirlineMembers/tabid/65/Default.aspx|publisher=RAA|accessdate=28 May 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510171307/http://www.raa.org/AirlineMembers/tabid/65/Default.aspx|archivedate=10 May 2012}}</ref> This association lobbies purely for the financial interest of the corporate bodies it constitutes, not the employees of those airlines.\n\n==== Canada ====\nIn Canada, there are a number of regional airlines. Some of them focus on [[Northern Canada|Canadian Arctic]] and [[First Nations]] communities, while others operate regional flights on behalf of a larger carrier, similar to their American counterparts. Some of these airlines and brands include:\n* [[Air Canada Express]] operated by:\n** [[Exploits Valley Air Services]]\n** [[Jazz (airline)|Jazz]]\n** [[Sky Regional Airlines]]\n* [[Air Creebec]]\n* [[Air Tindi]]\n* [[Bearskin Airlines]]\n* [[Canadian North]]\n* [[Pacific Coastal Airlines]]\n* [[Pascan Aviation]]\n* [[Perimeter Aviation]]\n* [[Porter Airlines]]\n* [[Wasaya Airways]]\n* [[WestJet Encore]] (operating for [[WestJet]])\n\n==== United States ====\nThe trend of branding smaller and mostly regional (in terms of geographical scope) airlines to match the mainline airlines, has led to only three main sub-brands in the United States. These three, [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]], [[Delta Connection]], and [[United Express]] are the post-deregulation survivors resultant of the multiple bankruptcies and mergers of the major, legacy, [[mainline (flight)|mainline]] airlines, as well as some discount or low-cost carriers which adopted similar strategic marketing ideas.\n\n=====Regional airline holding companies=====\nMany small regional airlines have grown substantially, usually through virtual mergers by use of the regional airline holding company, as pioneered by [[AMR Corporation]] in 1982. AMR created the AMR Eagle Holding Corporation<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.hoovers.com/american-eagle/--ID__104090--/free-co-factsheet.xhtml |title= AMR Eagle Holding Corporation |accessdate=2007-10-01 |work= }}</ref> which unified its wholly owned [[Envoy Air|American Eagle Airlines]] and [[Executive Airlines]] under one division, but still maintained the regional airlines' [[operating certificate]]s and personnel separate from each other and [[American Airlines]]. Also, [[ExpressJet Airlines]] is partially owned by United Airlines, which in 2010 acquired the resources of [[Continental Airlines|Continental Airlines, Inc.]], including the marketing [[brand]] of [[Continental Express]].\n\nThe most significant airline holding companies in the United States, and their subsidiary regional airlines, are:\n* [[Alaska Air Group]]\n** [[Horizon Air]]\n* [[American Airlines Group]]\n** [[Envoy Air]]\n** [[Piedmont Airlines]]\n** [[PSA Airlines]]\n* [[United Airlines Holdings]]\n** [[ExpressJet Airlines]]\n* [[HoTH Inc.]]\n** [[Era Aviation|Corvus Airlines]]\n** [[Frontier Flying Services]]\n** [[Hageland Aviation]]\n* [[Republic Airways Holdings]]\n** [[Republic Airways]]\n* [[SkyWest, Inc.]]\n**[[SkyWest Airlines]]\n* [[Trans States Holdings]]\n** [[Compass Airlines (North America)|Compass Airlines]]\n** [[GoJet Airlines|GoJet]]\n* [[Mesa Air Group]]\n** [[Mesa Airlines]]\n* [[Delta Air Lines]]\n** [[Endeavor Air]]\n\n=====Regional brands=====\nAs of August 2018, the various holding companies support the dwindling number of regional brands:\n* [[Alaska Air Group|Alaska Horizon/Alaska SkyWest]]\n* [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]]\n* [[Delta Connection]]\n* [[Hawaiian Airlines|Ohana by Hawaiian]]\n* [[United Express]]\n\nThese [[virtual airline (economics)|virtual airlines]], as they have been called, tend to use largely outsourced labor at most stations, to reduce costs.

There are two main ways for a regional airline to do business:\n# As an '''affiliated airline''', contracting with a [[Major carrier|major airline]], operating under their brand name (for example, [[Endeavor Air]] operates flights under the [[Delta Connection]] brand name for [[Delta Air Lines]]), and filling two roles: delivering passengers to the major airline's hubs from surrounding towns, and increasing frequency of service on mainline routes during times when demand does not warrant use of large aircraft, known as ''commuter flights''.\n# Operating as an '''independent airline''' under their own brand, mostly providing service to small and isolated towns, for whom the airline is the only reasonable link to a larger town. Examples of this are [[PenAir]], which links the remote [[Aleutian Islands]] to [[Anchorage, Alaska]], and [[Mokulele Airlines]], which operates in the Hawaiian islands.\n\nSmall regional airlines operating in the U.S. during the 1960s and 1970s were also known as '''commuter airlines''' and were classified as such in the [[Official Airline Guide]] (OAG).\n\n==History==\n[[Image:easternairways j41 g-majx arp.jpg|thumb|left|[[BAe Jetstream 41|British Aerospace Jetstream 41]] of the UK regional airline [[Eastern Airways]]]]\nRegional airlines began by operating propeller-driven aircraft over short routes, sometimes on flights of less than 100 miles. In the early days of commercial aviation few aircraft had ranges greater than this, and airlines were often formed to serve the area in which they formed. That is, there was no strong distinction between a regional airline and any other airline. This changed with the introduction of long-range aircraft, which led to the development of the flag carrier airlines, such as [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] and [[Trans-Canada Airlines]]. As the flag carriers grew in importance with increasing long-range passenger traffic, the smaller airlines found a niche flying passengers over short routes to the flag carrier's airport. This arrangement was eventually formalized, forming the regional airlines.\n\nThrough the 1960s and 1970s, war surplus designs, notably the [[DC-3]], were replaced by much more capable [[turboprop]] or [[Jet aircraft|jet]]-powered designs like the [[Fokker F27 Friendship]] or [[BAC One-Eleven]]. This extended the range of the regionals dramatically, causing a wave of consolidations between the now overlapping airlines.\n\nIn the United States, regional airlines were an important building block of today's passenger air system.  The U.S. Government encouraged the forming of regional airlines to provide services from smaller communities to larger towns, where air passengers could connect to a larger network.\n\nSome of the original regional airlines (then known as \"'''Local Service Airlines'''\") sanctioned by the [[Civil Aeronautics Board]] in the 1940s and 1950s include:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Allegheny Airlines]]\n* [[Bonanza Air Lines]]\n* [[Central Airlines]]\n* [[Frontier Airlines (1950-1986)|Frontier Airlines]]\n* [[Lake Central Airlines]]\n* [[Mohawk Airlines]]\n* [[North Central Airlines]]\n* [[Ozark Airlines]]\n* [[Pacific Air Lines]]\n* [[Pacific Southwest Airlines]]\n* [[Piedmont Airlines (1948-1989)|Piedmont Airlines]]\n* [[Southern Airways]]\n* [[Southwest Airways]] (renamed Pacific Air Lines in 1958)\n* [[Trans-Texas Airways]]\n* [[West Coast Airlines]]\n{{div col end}}\n\nNone of these airlines survive today; some airlines use these names today but are not the direct successors to the original airlines.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} A history and study of regional airlines was published by the Smithsonian Institution Press in 1994 under the title ''Commuter Airlines of the United States'', by [[R.E.G. Davies]] and [[I. E. Quastler]].\n\nOne of the first independently owned and managed airlines in the world that rebranded its aircraft to match a larger airline's brand was [[Air Alpes]] of France. During 1974, Air Alpes painted its newly delivered short range regional jets in the livery of [[Air France]].\n[[File:Fokker F27-300 PH-KFA NLM GRON 13.03.67 edited-3.jpg|thumb|NLM [[Fokker F.27|Fokker F.27 Friendship]] wearing the basic mainline livery of [[KLM Airlines]] however wearing the initial titles of NLM at Groningen in 1967.

This is encouraged with the [[Essential Air Service]] program<ref>[http://www.dot.gov/policy/aviation-policy/small-community-rural-air-service/essential-air-service \"Essential Air Service\"]. ''U.S. Department of Transportation''. Office of Aviation Policy. DOT. Tuesday, April 29, 2014. Retrieved Thursday, July 24, 2014.</ref> that subsidizes airline service to smaller U.S. [[community|communities]] and [[suburban]] centers, aiming to maintain year-round service.\n\nAlthough regional airlines in the United States are often viewed as small, not particularly lucrative \"no name\" subsidiaries of the mainline airlines, in terms of revenue, many would be designated [[major carrier|major airline carrier]] status based on the only actual definition of \"major airline,\" in the United States, the definition from the U.S. Department of Transportation. This definition is based solely on annual revenue and not on any other criterion such as average aircraft seating capacity, pilot pay, or number of aircraft in the fleet. It is common in the U.S. to incorrectly associate aircraft size with the Department of Transportation's designation of major, national, and regional airline. The only corollary is the Regional Airline Association, an industry trade group, defines \"regional airlines\" generally as \"...operat(ing) short and medium haul scheduled airline service connecting smaller communities with larger cities and connecting hubs. The airlines' fleet primarily consists of 19 to 68 seat turboprops and 30 to 100 seat regional jets.\" To be clear there is no distinction in the Department of Transportation definition of major, national and regional airlines by aircraft size. The definition is based on revenue. The clash of definitions has led to confusion in the media and the public.\n\nBeginning around 1985, a number of trends have become apparent. Regional aircraft are getting larger, faster, and are flying longer ranges. Additionally, the vast majority of regionals within the United States with more than ten aircraft within their fleet, have lost their individual identities and now serve only as feeders, to [[Alaska Airlines]],  [[American Airlines]],  [[Delta Air Lines]], or [[United Airlines]] major hubs. Regional  aircraft in the US have been getting slightly more comfortable with the addition of better [[ergonomics|ergonomically]] designed [[aircraft cabin]]s, and the addition of varying [[travel class]]es aboard these aircraft.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}  From small, less than 50-seat \"single-class cabin\" [[turboprop]], to [[turbofan]] [[Regional airliner#Regional jets|regional jet]] equipment, present day regional airlines provide [[aircraft]] such as the higher capacity [[Bombardier CRJ700|CRJ700]], [[Bombardier CRJ700|CRJ900]], [[Bombardier CRJ700|CRJ1000]] series of aircraft and the somewhat larger fuselage [[Embraer E-Jets]].  Some of these newer aircraft are capable of flying longer distances with comfort levels that rival and surpass the regional airline equipment of the past.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\nIn the early 1990s, much more advanced turboprop-powered, fuel efficient, and passenger friendly [[DC-3]] type replacement projects such as the 19 passenger [[Embraer/FMA CBA 123 Vector]] and the 34 seat [[Dornier 328]] were undertaken, but met little financial success, partly due to economic downturn in the airline industry resulting from the outbreak of hostilities when [[Iraq invasion of Kuwait|Iraq invaded Kuwait]]. Many of the regional airlines  operating turboprop equipment such as [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]]'s regional sister [[Comair]] airlines in the United States set the course for bypassing entirely the regional turboprops as they became the first to transition to an all-jet [[Regional jet#Regional jets|regional jet]] fleet.  To a lesser extent in Europe and the United Kingdom this transition, to  notably the [[Embraer]] or [[Canadair]] designs, was well advanced by the late  1990s. This evolution towards jet equipment, brought the independent regional airlines into direct competition with the major airlines, forcing additional consolidation.\n\nTo improve on their market penetration, larger airline [[holding company|holding companies]] rely on operators of smaller aircraft to provide service or added frequency service to some airports. Such airlines, often operating in [[code-share]] arrangements with mainline airlines, often completely repaint [http://www.eturbonews.com/7932/commuter-airlines-bring-anxiety-business-travelers] their aircraft fleet in the mainline airline's sub-brand livery.  For example, [[United Express]] regional airline partner [[CommutAir]] branded its entire fleet as United Express.  On the other hand, regional airline [[Gulfstream International Airlines]] does not brand their aircraft. When [[Colgan Air]] was still operating, they branded a handful of aircraft as Colgan Air, but most were branded as [[Continental Connection]], [[US Airways Express]] or [[United Express]], with whom it had contractual agreements.\n\n[[Image:Corporate5966.JPG|thumb|Typical seat map of a smaller [[regional airliner]] as is often flown by the regional airlines. The smallest aircraft flown under such brands and regional airlines may or may not have [[aircraft lavatory|lavatories]].]]\n\nMany airline passengers find sub-branding very confusing, while many other airline passengers are content to think they are on a mainline or flagship airline's aircraft, while in actuality they are far from it. Sub-branding is pretty consistent throughout the airline industry of the United States, with all the regional airlines, mainline airlines, and the regional airline holding companies, as well as the mainline airlines holding companies participating.<ref>{{cite news|title=Frontline: Flying Cheap|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/flyingcheap/interviews/cohen.html#1|accessdate=1 June 2012|newspaper=Public Broadcasting Service|date=Feb 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Former regional airlines===\nPost airline deregulation, airlines sought added market share and to do this they sought partnerships with regional and small airlines to feed traffic into the airline hub.\n\nInitially these tie ups tended to use small 15 -19 seat aircraft, which did not have a reputation of passenger comfort, or safe reliable operations, by small often under capitalized tiny airline operators.\n\nTo create a common tie and what appeared to be seamless to the air traveler, major carriers marketed in advertising and soon had much smaller airlines paint their small and what was often described as puddle-jumper aircraft, in the image and branding colors of the much larger mainline partner. This was to give the appearance of reliability. Over time these regional aircraft grew in size as airline hubs expanded and competition dwindled among the major carriers.\n\nBelow is a list of many of the regional brands that evolved when regional

the major hubs, where they will connect for longer distance flights on the [[national airline]]s also known as [[flag carrier|flagship carriers]]'s, larger aircraft. The smallest regional carriers have become known as feeder airlines. The separate corporate structure allows the company to operate under different pay schedules, typically paying much less than their [[mainline (flight)|mainline]] owners.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\nMany large North American airlines, have established operational relationships with one or more regional airline companies. Their aircraft often use the [[aircraft livery]] for the company they are operating flights for.  These airlines can be [[subsidiary|subsidiaries]] of the major airline or fly under a [[code sharing]] agreement or operating through capacity purchase agreements, with the mainline parent company financing the aircraft for the regional airline, and then placing the aircraft with the regional for very little cost. An example would be [[Envoy Air]], which is fully owned by [[American Airlines Group]] and does business as [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]].\n\nMany of these large regional airlines have joined the lobbying group [[Regional Airline Association]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Members in the Regional Airline Assoc.|url=http://www.raa.org/AirlineMembers/tabid/65/Default.aspx|publisher=RAA|accessdate=28 May 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510171307/http://www.raa.org/AirlineMembers/tabid/65/Default.aspx|archivedate=10 May 2012}}</ref> This association lobbies purely for the financial interest of the corporate bodies it constitutes, not the employees of those airlines.\n\n==== Canada ====\nIn Canada, there are a number of regional airlines.

These three, [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]], [[Delta Connection]], and [[United Express]] are the post-deregulation survivors resultant of the multiple bankruptcies and mergers of the major, legacy, [[mainline (flight)|mainline]] airlines, as well as some discount or low-cost carriers which adopted similar strategic marketing ideas.\n\n=====Regional airline holding companies=====\nMany small regional airlines have grown substantially, usually through virtual mergers by use of the regional airline holding company, as pioneered by [[AMR Corporation]] in 1982. AMR created the AMR Eagle Holding Corporation<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.hoovers.com/american-eagle/--ID__104090--/free-co-factsheet.xhtml |title= AMR Eagle Holding Corporation |accessdate=2007-10-01 |work= }}</ref> which unified its wholly owned [[Envoy Air|American Eagle Airlines]] and [[Executive Airlines]] under one division, but still maintained the regional airlines' [[operating certificate]]s and personnel separate from each other and [[American Airlines]]. Also, [[ExpressJet Airlines]] is partially owned by United Airlines, which in 2010 acquired the resources of [[Continental Airlines|Continental Airlines, Inc.]], including the marketing [[brand]] of [[Continental Express]].\n\nThe most significant airline holding companies in the United States, and their subsidiary regional airlines, are:\n* [[Alaska Air Group]]\n** [[Horizon Air]]\n* [[American Airlines Group]]\n** [[Envoy Air]]\n** [[Piedmont Airlines]]\n** [[PSA Airlines]]\n* [[United Airlines Holdings]]\n** [[ExpressJet Airlines]]\n* [[HoTH Inc.]]\n** [[Era Aviation|Corvus Airlines]]\n** [[Frontier Flying Services]]\n** [[Hageland Aviation]]\n* [[Republic Airways Holdings]]\n** [[Republic Airways]]\n* [[SkyWest, Inc.]]\n**[[SkyWest Airlines]]\n* [[Trans States Holdings]]\n** [[Compass Airlines (North America)|Compass Airlines]]\n** [[GoJet Airlines|GoJet]]\n* [[Mesa Air Group]]\n** [[Mesa Airlines]]\n* [[Delta Air Lines]]\n** [[Endeavor Air]]\n\n=====Regional brands=====\nAs of August 2018, the various holding companies support the dwindling number of regional brands:\n* [[Alaska Air Group|Alaska Horizon/Alaska SkyWest]]\n* [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]]\n* [[Delta Connection]]\n* [[Hawaiian Airlines|Ohana by Hawaiian]]\n* [[United Express]]\n\nThese [[virtual airline (economics)|virtual airlines]], as they have been called, tend to use largely outsourced labor at most stations, to reduce costs.

Among these significant dates are:\n\n: '''1967''' \u2013 CAB makes exemption for airlines, starting with the local service carrier '''Allegheny Airlines'''; to suspend operating a route with [[large aircraft]] due to a lack of passenger traffic to do so profitably, provided the airline operating the CAB awarded route substitutes its operation with other equipment and maintains responsibility the route is served.

He has played a significant role in the development of the \"Denver Sound\", music that mixes elements of [[country music|country]], [[Gothic rock|gothic]], [[Folk music|folk]] and [[gospel music|gospel]]. He is a current member of [[Slim Cessna's Auto Club]], Munly and the Lupercalians, and Denver Broncos UK (DBUK). He was the leader of Munly and the Lee Lewis Harlots from approximately 2000 to 2006. \n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood and upbringing ===\n\nMunly was born and raised [[Quebec, Canada]] in a \"stereotypical Catholic family\"<ref name=\"Munly on Vera\">{{cite news |last1=Forman |first1=Bill |title=Wulf at the door |url=https://m.csindy.com/coloradosprings/wulf-at-the-door/Content?oid=1974001 |accessdate=March 26, 2020 |work=Colorado Springs Indy |publisher=Colorado Springs Independent |date=December 23, 2010 |ref=Munly on Vera}}</ref> with two parents and two siblings \u2013 one brother<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\">{{cite news |last1=Solomon |first1=Jon |title=Munly talks Slim Cessna's Auto Club's new album and seeing Billy Bragg for the first time |url=https://www.westword.com/music/munly-talks-slim-cessnas-auto-clubs-new-album-and-seeing-billy-bragg-for-the-first-time-5719289 |accessdate=March 23, 2020 |work=Westword |date=December 27, 2012 |ref=Munly Acting Westword}}</ref> and one sister.<ref name=\"Munly ORH\">{{cite news |title=Munly Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots |url=https://archive.org/details/OutsightRadioHoursInterviews2000-2010/KramerEddie.rm |accessdate=April 5, 2020 |work=Outsight Radio Hours |issue=Interview No. 252 |publisher=Archive.org |date=October 26, 2004 |ref=Munly ORH}}</ref><ref name=\"Coolstreams\">{{cite web |title=CoolStreams Internet Radio \u2013 Jay Munly |url=http://musicsojourn.com/AR/Alt/page/m/MunlyJay.htm |website=musicsojourn.com |accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\nHe was a well-behaved child growing up, rarely getting into trouble.

In a 2012 interview with [[Westword]], he says that his brother took him to the [[Bob Johnson (ice hockey, born 1931)|Bob Johnson]] ice hockey school to play.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\n===Interest in music===\n\nHis interest in music initially stemmed from boredom as he was recovering from an ice hockey injury. He also had some familial ties: his father and grandfather owned and played banjos, and his father also made a [[dulcimer]] for his mother as a gift, although she did not play it.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />\n\nWhile recuperating from said injury, Munly taught himself how to play his father's 19th century-era [[banjo]], which was technically off-limits to handle,<ref name=\"Munly on Vera\" /> although his mother knew what was going on. She eventually bought him a guitar which he taught himself to play as well.<ref name=\"Munly Syffal\">{{cite news |last1=Frieders |first1=Joel |title=Our Interview With Munly J.

It is a role that he is happy to take on by himself, believing that a band's success is dependent on playing to individual strengths rather than collaboration with members on each part of an album's creation.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" /> He also says that he is \"selfish\" with his written material and serious about lyrical preservation.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\nHe expanded on his way of songwriting in a 2019 interview with Sadwave, a Russian publication:\n\n{{quote|''\"From the very beginning, I understand where and why I'm writing a song. There is no complicated science. When you have been doing this for so many years, you bring the skill to automatism. I can start with a melody, but I can with a text \u2013 I always have a lot of words, I write a lot. I constantly find common themes in my songs, but I never had the feeling that I was working on a pattern. It would be immoral and unnatural, and I would not want to. I have characters who constantly come back, wander from song to song. But I try to change the angle, write on behalf of different people. On behalf of all sad people.\"''<ref name=\"Munly Sadwave\">{{cite news |last1=Kurkin |first1=Dmitry |title=Jay Manley [sic] (DBUK): 'I try to write on behalf of all sad people' |url=https://sadwave.com/2019/02/jay-munli/ |accessdate=April 5, 2020 |work=sad wave |date=February 8, 2019 |ref=Munly Sadwave}}</ref>}}\n\n===Musical themes and genres===\n\nHis music has ties to [[alt-country]] and [[Gothabilly|Gothic-Americana]]. Common themes include religion, violence and dysfunctional relationships; often they are intertwined. His increasingly narrative songs often feature banjo and, since the recording of his fourth album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', strings.\n\nOne topic that Munly deliberately does not write about is politics, since he \"hates\" music that veers into that kind of territory.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he admits that the stories and songs that he writes can be applied to real-world events in a way that coincidentally fits.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" />\n\n===Vocals===\n\nTechnically, Munly is a baritone, but his [[vocal range]] extends from A1 to F5.<ref name=\"Munly Vocal Range 1\">{{cite news |title=Jay \"Munly\" Munly |url=https://therangeplanet.proboards.com/thread/14/jay-munly |accessdate=9 April 2020 |work=The Range Planet |date=September 22, 2019 |ref=Munly Vocal Range 1}}</ref> Audio samples can be found on Youtube.<ref name=\"Munly Vocal Range 2\">{{cite web |title=The Vocal Range of Jay Munly |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_hVoW0VwVA |via=YouTube |accessdate=April 9, 2020 |ref=Munly Vocal Range 2}}</ref> \n\nEarly on in his solo career, he sang at a higher register than what he usually sounds like on his later records. \n\nOn the expanded DVDs of ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004) and ''The Commandments According to SCAC'' (2016), Munly read the lyrics of each song as poetry, employing a wide range of voices to the characters in his songs.\n\n===Controversial lyrics===\n\nAs stated in a few interviews, people have found some of Munly's material controversial and politically incorrect. It is important to note that in most cases, the words and phrases used (as well as the views they represent) are that of the fictional characters that Munly creates, not of Munly himself.\n\nExamples:\n\n* ''\"Boys with tattoos can't be Jews\"'' \u2013 from \"Kidneys Running Dry\" on ''Blurry'' (1996)<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /><ref name=\"KRD Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Munly \u2013 Kidneys Running Dry |url=https://genius.com/Munly-kidneys-running-dry-lyrics?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=bd3ae05fe6c1e2a47c4f0713ffa5a16e71fce6fd-1586308658-0-AacccNM6Up3QUKAwcxWr7moI6buvh28pOpYPxYODrvwTY_F1arxPxbTRgSuWyl4Xdp0ySY_ZseZwWCStv8dumtz5AhmL5llOOnD9_3dv6-XTquwykYgduqCixdMk01PstYrSa8KQZi4SK3emYdNuLlbX4RFCHJbwQ1YRExOJjd6dkKD1_GHgcdfYYDe-vTJWI1uyX_0R8Q64ZevT3n-7A-7f2-ifsSZoF6J2JCq_RT2aMwKoWBxbHjarJrGdvNiZWwohYzH2ba2tN14wf2PwTXEzsdbFCgp-hDaOKuoeEYASB7ZBgYOJT_5LMn8GQ2PkKSfxVXNgggJO-I6ajZK3bMX27bSVAiYaqRheMbR_klyaHJvQPTQvRxAPyOR5CZ1c9A |website=Genius |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=KRD Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[a] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"My Darling Sambo\" \u2013 the first track title on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"JCS Amazon\">{{cite web |title=MUNLY, JAY \u2013 Jimmy Carter Syndrome |url=https://www.amazon.com/Jimmy-Carter-Syndrome-JAY-MUNLY/dp/B000BKWZOI |website=Amazon Music |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=JCS Amazon}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[b] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Paint your blackface/Yeah, won't you put me in your anteroom case/I'll be your n***er/On stage\"'' \u2013 from \"Censer from the Footlights\" on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"CFTF Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Jay Munly \u2013 Censer from the Footlights Lyrics |url=http://www.songlyrics.com/jay-munly/censer-from-the-footlights-lyrics/ |website=SongLyrics |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=CFTF Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[c] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[d] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[e] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[f] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Then we found ourselves a half-breed/To tell us our fortune today/He painted my hands a deep, dark red/Said 'now boy, you know that you gotta pay'\"'' \u2013 from \"Goose Walking Over My Grave\" on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"Munly Birds\">{{cite news |last1=Bradley |first1=Lisa M. |title=A Crack in Its Speak: Fantastic Birds in the Gothic Country Lyrics of Jay Munly |url=http://stonetelling.com/issue8-aug2012/bradley-speak.html |accessdate=April 6, 2020 |work=Stone Telling |issue=Issue No. 8 |date=August 2012 |ref=Munly Birds}}</ref><ref name=\"Goose Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Lyrics \u2013 Goose Walking Over My Grave |url=https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Munly-The-Lee-Lewis-Harlots/Goose-Walking-Over-My-Grave |website=Musixmatch |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=Goose Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[g] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"Cassius Castrato The She-Male of the Men's Prison\" \u2013 the fifth track title on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"LLH Album\">{{cite web |title=Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots |url=https://slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com/collections/munly/products/munly-the-lee-lewis-harlots |website=slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=LLH Album}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[h] ]]</sup>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Solo career===\n\nIn the 1990s, Munly started out his music career as a solo artist.

He also shared a 7-inch vinyl album with [[Roger Manning]].<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" />\n\nHe released his debut solo album, ''Blurry'', in 1996 through Top Notch, an imprint of [[What Are Records?]]. ''Munly de Dar He'' and ''Galvanized Yankee'' were also released through Top Notch in 1997 and 1999, respectively.

He is a current member of [[Slim Cessna's Auto Club]], Munly and the Lupercalians, and Denver Broncos UK (DBUK).

In a 2012 interview with [[Westword]], he says that his brother took him to the [[Bob Johnson (ice hockey, born 1931)|Bob Johnson]] ice hockey school to play.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\n===Interest in music===\n\nHis interest in music initially stemmed from boredom as he was recovering from an ice hockey injury.

It is a role that he is happy to take on by himself, believing that a band's success is dependent on playing to individual strengths rather than collaboration with members on each part of an album's creation.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" /> He also says that he is \"selfish\" with his written material and serious about lyrical preservation.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\nHe expanded on his way of songwriting in a 2019 interview with Sadwave, a Russian publication:\n\n{{quote|''\"From the very beginning, I understand where and why I'm writing a song. There is no complicated science. When you have been doing this for so many years, you bring the skill to automatism. I can start with a melody, but I can with a text \u2013 I always have a lot of words, I write a lot. I constantly find common themes in my songs, but I never had the feeling that I was working on a pattern. It would be immoral and unnatural, and I would not want to. I have characters who constantly come back, wander from song to song. But I try to change the angle, write on behalf of different people. On behalf of all sad people.\"''<ref name=\"Munly Sadwave\">{{cite news |last1=Kurkin |first1=Dmitry |title=Jay Manley [sic] (DBUK): 'I try to write on behalf of all sad people' |url=https://sadwave.com/2019/02/jay-munli/ |accessdate=April 5, 2020 |work=sad wave |date=February 8, 2019 |ref=Munly Sadwave}}</ref>}}\n\n===Musical themes and genres===\n\nHis music has ties to [[alt-country]] and [[Gothabilly|Gothic-Americana]]. Common themes include religion, violence and dysfunctional relationships; often they are intertwined. His increasingly narrative songs often feature banjo and, since the recording of his fourth album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', strings.\n\nOne topic that Munly deliberately does not write about is politics, since he \"hates\" music that veers into that kind of territory.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he admits that the stories and songs that he writes can be applied to real-world events in a way that coincidentally fits.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" />\n\n===Vocals===\n\nTechnically, Munly is a baritone, but his [[vocal range]] extends from A1 to F5.<ref name=\"Munly Vocal Range 1\">{{cite news |title=Jay \"Munly\" Munly |url=https://therangeplanet.proboards.com/thread/14/jay-munly |accessdate=9 April 2020 |work=The Range Planet |date=September 22, 2019 |ref=Munly Vocal Range 1}}</ref> Audio samples can be found on Youtube.<ref name=\"Munly Vocal Range 2\">{{cite web |title=The Vocal Range of Jay Munly |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_hVoW0VwVA |via=YouTube |accessdate=April 9, 2020 |ref=Munly Vocal Range 2}}</ref> \n\nEarly on in his solo career, he sang at a higher register than what he usually sounds like on his later records. \n\nOn the expanded DVDs of ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004) and ''The Commandments According to SCAC'' (2016), Munly read the lyrics of each song as poetry, employing a wide range of voices to the characters in his songs.\n\n===Controversial lyrics===\n\nAs stated in a few interviews, people have found some of Munly's material controversial and politically incorrect. It is important to note that in most cases, the words and phrases used (as well as the views they represent) are that of the fictional characters that Munly creates, not of Munly himself.\n\nExamples:\n\n* ''\"Boys with tattoos can't be Jews\"'' \u2013 from \"Kidneys Running Dry\" on ''Blurry'' (1996)<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /><ref name=\"KRD Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Munly \u2013 Kidneys Running Dry |url=https://genius.com/Munly-kidneys-running-dry-lyrics?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=bd3ae05fe6c1e2a47c4f0713ffa5a16e71fce6fd-1586308658-0-AacccNM6Up3QUKAwcxWr7moI6buvh28pOpYPxYODrvwTY_F1arxPxbTRgSuWyl4Xdp0ySY_ZseZwWCStv8dumtz5AhmL5llOOnD9_3dv6-XTquwykYgduqCixdMk01PstYrSa8KQZi4SK3emYdNuLlbX4RFCHJbwQ1YRExOJjd6dkKD1_GHgcdfYYDe-vTJWI1uyX_0R8Q64ZevT3n-7A-7f2-ifsSZoF6J2JCq_RT2aMwKoWBxbHjarJrGdvNiZWwohYzH2ba2tN14wf2PwTXEzsdbFCgp-hDaOKuoeEYASB7ZBgYOJT_5LMn8GQ2PkKSfxVXNgggJO-I6ajZK3bMX27bSVAiYaqRheMbR_klyaHJvQPTQvRxAPyOR5CZ1c9A |website=Genius |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=KRD Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[a] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"My Darling Sambo\" \u2013 the first track title on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"JCS Amazon\">{{cite web |title=MUNLY, JAY \u2013 Jimmy Carter Syndrome |url=https://www.amazon.com/Jimmy-Carter-Syndrome-JAY-MUNLY/dp/B000BKWZOI |website=Amazon Music |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=JCS Amazon}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[b] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Paint your blackface/Yeah, won't you put me in your anteroom case/I'll be your n***er/On stage\"'' \u2013 from \"Censer from the Footlights\" on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"CFTF Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Jay Munly \u2013 Censer from the Footlights Lyrics |url=http://www.songlyrics.com/jay-munly/censer-from-the-footlights-lyrics/ |website=SongLyrics |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=CFTF Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[c] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[d] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[e] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[f] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Then we found ourselves a half-breed/To tell us our fortune today/He painted my hands a deep, dark red/Said 'now boy, you know that you gotta pay'\"'' \u2013 from \"Goose Walking Over My Grave\" on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"Munly Birds\">{{cite news |last1=Bradley |first1=Lisa M. |title=A Crack in Its Speak: Fantastic Birds in the Gothic Country Lyrics of Jay Munly |url=http://stonetelling.com/issue8-aug2012/bradley-speak.html |accessdate=April 6, 2020 |work=Stone Telling |issue=Issue No. 8 |date=August 2012 |ref=Munly Birds}}</ref><ref name=\"Goose Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Lyrics \u2013 Goose Walking Over My Grave |url=https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Munly-The-Lee-Lewis-Harlots/Goose-Walking-Over-My-Grave |website=Musixmatch |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=Goose Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[g] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"Cassius Castrato The She-Male of the Men's Prison\" \u2013 the fifth track title on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"LLH Album\">{{cite web |title=Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots |url=https://slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com/collections/munly/products/munly-the-lee-lewis-harlots |website=slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=LLH Album}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[h] ]]</sup>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Solo career===\n\nIn the 1990s, Munly started out his music career as a solo artist.

''Munly de Dar He'' and ''Galvanized Yankee'' were also released through Top Notch in 1997 and 1999, respectively. His fourth and final solo album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', was released through [[Alternative Tentacles]] in 2002. Each of these albums were re-mastered by Bob Ferbrache and re-released as limited editions through Smooch Records in 2006. Only 1,000 copies of each were printed.\n\nHe has worked with several musicians that are featured on his albums, such as John Ellison of The Reejers and Chris Mars of The Replacements.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he makes a point of not listing the exact musical contributions of each member in liner notes, preferring the simplicity of the 'Modern Library book' aesthetic.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />\n\nAlthough Munly is the primary vocalist and lyricist on each of his albums, he hesitates to call himself a \"singer-songwriter\":\n\n''{{quote|\"It's kind of rough being a solo artist.

The suburb makes up the western side of the [[Takanini]] urban area and is in the Manurewa-Papakura ward of Auckland City. The suburb is known for its tree-lined streets<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=10825979|title=My Auckland: Conifer Grove|last=Easther|first=Elisabeth|date=2012-08-11|work=NZ Herald|access-date=2019-01-01|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}</ref>, bay views, and until 2018 its border with the Manukau Golf Course<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=11426512|title=$175m South Auckland retirement village planned|last=anne.gibson@nzherald.co.nz @anneherald|first=Anne Gibson Property editor, NZ Herald|date=2015-04-01|work=NZ Herald|access-date=2019-01-01|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}</ref>. \n\n==History==\n\nConifer Grove was constructed around 1965-1970. Conifer Grove's modern area (including Keywella Drive, Aristoy Close and Chippewa Place) was previously a dairy farm owned by the Strevens family, which connected onto [[Great South Road, New Zealand|Great South Road]] and is now the Manukau Golf Course. The names Walter Strevens Drive and Walter Strevens reserve come from the name of the patriarch of that family at the time it was sold - Walter John Strevens.\n\nDuring the major reformation of local government in 1989, Conifer Grove was re-zoned and the area was included into the [[Papakura District]] boundaries.\n\nFrom October 2010, after a review of the [[Royal Commission on Auckland Governance]], the entire [[Auckland Region]] was amalgamated into a single city authority. As well as the current [[Papakura District]], other territorial authorities have been abolished and the entire area has been dissolved into a single [[Auckland]] city council. The suburb of Conifer Grove is now be in the ''Manurewa-Papakura Ward'' of the [[Auckland Council]].\n\nFun facts :\nMayor of Conifer 1995-current \n - Naveen joshi\n\n==People==\n\nThe most common ethnic group in Conifer Grove is [[Europe]]an as at 2006, with 66.2 percent. [[M\u0101ori people|Maori]] residents make up 17.7 percent of the suburb, and [[Asia]]n residents consisting of 10.3 percent.\n\nAccording to the 2006 New Zealand census, (for residents aged 15 years and older) the most common occupational group in Conifer Grove is ''Managers'', and the least common group is ''Community and personal service workers'', with an unemployment rate of 5.1 percent of the Conifer Grove population.\n\nFraser Thomas were commissioned to design the subdivision and to manage its construction. Fraser Thomas were awarded Certificates of Merit by both the Association of Consulting Engineers NZ and the New Zealand Institute of Surveyors.<ref>[http://www.fraserthomas.co.nz/job%20profiles/sur-conifer.htm Conifer Grove] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009000953/http://www.fraserthomas.co.nz/job%20profiles/sur-conifer.htm |date=9 October 2007 }} (from the [[Fraser Thomas]] website. Accessed 2008-03-16.)</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\n\nConifer Grove has a small shopping centre. Located in the grove is also Conifer Grove Primary School and Conifer Grove Kindergarten.  The primary school includes an intermediate school, offering education for students years one to eight. It is zoned primarily for Rosehill College. There are various parks/reserves such as Brylee Drive Reserve with two tennis courts and playground. This links to a board walk which goes around the waters/mangroves edge, which is enjoyed by many of the residents.

Located on the eastern shores of the [[Pahurehure]] Inlet, on the [[Manukau Harbour]], under authority of the [[Auckland Council]]. The suburb makes up the western side of the [[Takanini]] urban area and is in the Manurewa-Papakura ward of Auckland City. The suburb is known for its tree-lined streets<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=10825979|title=My Auckland: Conifer Grove|last=Easther|first=Elisabeth|date=2012-08-11|work=NZ Herald|access-date=2019-01-01|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}</ref>, bay views, and until 2018 its border with the Manukau Golf Course<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=11426512|title=$175m South Auckland retirement village planned|last=anne.gibson@nzherald.co.nz @anneherald|first=Anne Gibson Property editor, NZ Herald|date=2015-04-01|work=NZ Herald|access-date=2019-01-01|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}</ref>. \n\n==History==\n\nConifer Grove was constructed around 1965-1970. Conifer Grove's modern area (including Keywella Drive, Aristoy Close and Chippewa Place) was previously a dairy farm owned by the Strevens family, which connected onto [[Great South Road, New Zealand|Great South Road]] and is now the Manukau Golf Course. The names Walter Strevens Drive and Walter Strevens reserve come from the name of the patriarch of that family at the time it was sold - Walter John Strevens.\n\nDuring the major reformation of local government in 1989, Conifer Grove was re-zoned and the area was included into the [[Papakura District]] boundaries.\n\nFrom October 2010, after a review of the [[Royal Commission on Auckland Governance]], the entire [[Auckland Region]] was amalgamated into a single city authority. As well as the current [[Papakura District]], other territorial authorities have been abolished and the entire area has been dissolved into a single [[Auckland]] city council. The suburb of Conifer Grove is now be in the ''Manurewa-Papakura Ward'' of the [[Auckland Council]].\n\n==People==\n\nThe most common ethnic group in Conifer Grove is [[Europe]]an as at 2006, with 66.2 percent. [[M\u0101ori people|Maori]] residents make up 17.7 percent of the suburb, and [[Asia]]n residents consisting of 10.3 percent.\n\nAccording to the 2006 New Zealand census, (for residents aged 15 years and older) the most common occupational group in Conifer Grove is ''Managers'', and the least common group is ''Community and personal service workers'', with an unemployment rate of 5.1 percent of the Conifer Grove population.\n\nFraser Thomas were commissioned to design the subdivision and to manage its construction. Fraser Thomas were awarded Certificates of Merit by both the Association of Consulting Engineers NZ and the New Zealand Institute of Surveyors.<ref>[http://www.fraserthomas.co.nz/job%20profiles/sur-conifer.htm Conifer Grove] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009000953/http://www.fraserthomas.co.nz/job%20profiles/sur-conifer.htm |date=9 October 2007 }} (from the [[Fraser Thomas]] website. Accessed 2008-03-16.)</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\n\nConifer Grove has a small shopping centre. Located in the grove is also Conifer Grove Primary School and Conifer Grove Kindergarten.  The primary school includes an intermediate school, offering education for students years one to eight. It is zoned primarily for Rosehill College. There are various parks/reserves such as Brylee Drive Reserve with two tennis courts and playground. This links to a board walk which goes around the waters/mangroves edge, which is enjoyed by many of the residents.  This walk has been extended to connect the boardwalk through to Walter Strevens Drive reserve.\n\nMost of the streets are [[cul-de-sac]]s. Due to the suburbs design pattern, there is only one way in and out of the newer area of Conifer Grove.

Until now, there was 105 official games between Budu\u0107nost and Sutjeska.<br />\nAs a match of main and strongest clubs from two biggest Montenegrin cities, derby became popular among the citizens from the early history. Some of the highest attendance in Montenegrin football were recorded at the games of Montenegrin Derby. From the 80's, both clubs have organised supporters groups, which gave to a Montenegrin Derby new and often a violent dimension.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtcg.me/sport/kosarka/92178/prekinut-mec-sutjeska---buducnost-.html|title=Prekinut me\u010d Sutjeska - Budu\u0107nost|publisher=[[RTCG]] |date= 21 May 2015 |language=Montenegrin}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdm.me/sport/fudbal/foto-sjajna-atmosfera-los-fudbal-u-nerijesenom-derbiju-pod-goricom|title=Sjajna atmosfera, lo\u0161 fudbal u nerije\u0161enom derbiju pod Goricom|publisher=CdM |date= 23 February 2016 |language=Montenegrin}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mondo.rs/a728634/Sport/Fudbal/Tuca-Varvara-i-Vojvoda-u-Podgorici.html|title=Tu\u010da Varvara i Vojvoda u Podgorici|publisher=Mondo |date= 18 September 2014 |language=Montenegrin}}</ref><ref>https://www.vijesti.me/sport/fudbal/uznemirujuce-krvave-glave-kao-epilog-derbija-u-niksicu</ref>\n\n===Records and statistics===\n\n====Head to head record====\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Competition\n!width=60|Played\n!width=60|Budu\u0107nost\n!width=60|Draw\n!width=60|Sutjeska\n!width=60|GD\n|-\n|align=center|'''First League'''\n|66\n|bgcolor=\"darkblue\" |<center><span style=\"color:white;\">28</span></center>\n|22\n|bgcolor=\"cornflowerblue\" |<center><span style=\"color:white;\">16</span></center>\n|101:69\n|-\n|align=center|'''Montenegrin Championship'''\n|4\n|bgcolor=\"darkblue\" |<center><span style=\"color:white;\">4</span></center>\n|0\n|bgcolor=\"cornflowerblue\" |<center><span style=\"color:white;\">0</span></center>\n|15:3\n|-\n|align=center|'''Lower leagues'''\n|26\n|bgcolor=\"darkblue\" |<center><span style=\"color:white;\">12</span></center>\n|7\n|bgcolor=\"cornflowerblue\" |<center><span style=\"color:white;\">7</span></center>\n|43:28\n|-\n|align=center|'''National Cup'''\n|9\n|bgcolor=\"darkblue\" |<center><span style=\"color:white;\">6</span></center>\n|3\n|bgcolor=\"cornflowerblue\" |<center><span style=\"color:white;\">0</span></center>\n|14:5\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n!align=center|Totals\n!105\n|bgcolor=\"darkblue\" |<center><span style=\"color:white;\">'''50'''</span></center>\n!32\n|bgcolor=\"cornflowerblue\" |<center><span style=\"color:white;\">'''23'''</span></center>\n!173:106\n|}\n\n''GD - Goals of Budu\u0107nost first''\n\n====Biggest wins====\n=====Budu\u0107nost=====\n*'''Home:''' Budu\u0107nost ''7-1'' Sutjeska, 1933, [[Montenegrin Football Championship (1922-1940)]]\n*'''Away:''' Sutjeska ''0-4'' Budu\u0107nost, 2016, [[Montenegrin First League]]\n\n=====Sutjeska=====\n*'''Home:''' Sutjeska ''5-2'' Budu\u0107nost, 1963, [[Yugoslav Second League]]\n*'''Away:''' Budu\u0107nost ''1-4'' Sutjeska, 2019, [[Montenegrin First League]]\n\n====Runs====\n*'''Most consecutive draws:''' 4 games, ''2018-2019''\n\n=====Budu\u0107nost=====\n*'''Longest unbeaten run:''' 17 games, ''2000-2010''\n*'''Longest winning streak:''' 9 games, ''1932-1953''\n*'''Longest run without conceded goal:''' 4 games, ''2004-2007''\n\n=====Sutjeska=====\n*'''Longest unbeaten run:''' 9 games, ''2017-2019''\n*'''Longest winning streak:''' 3 games, ''2017''; ''2018''\n*'''Longest run without conceded goal:''' 3 games, ''1969-1971, 2017''\n\n====Record by venue====\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Town\n!width=60|Played\n!width=60|Budu\u0107nost\n!width=60|Draw\n!width=60|Sutjeska\n!width=60|GD\n|-\n|align=center|'''Podgorica'''\n|51\n|bgcolor=\"darkblue\" |<center><span style=\"color:white;\">31</span></center>\n|14\n|bgcolor=\"cornflowerblue\" |<center><span style=\"color:white;\">6</span></center>\n|105:44\n|-\n|align=center|'''Nik\u0161i\u0107'''\n|54\n|bgcolor=\"darkblue\" |<center><span style=\"color:white;\">19</span></center>\n|18\n|bgcolor=\"cornflowerblue\" |<center><span style=\"color:white;\">17</span></center>\n|68:62\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n!align=center|Totals\n!105\n|bgcolor=\"darkblue\" |<center><span style=\"color:white;\">'''50'''</span></center>\n!32\n|bgcolor=\"cornflowerblue\" |<center><span style=\"color:white;\">'''23'''</span></center>\n!173:106\n|}\n\n====Attendance====\n*'''Highest / [[Podgorica]]:''' ''16,000'', Budu\u0107nost - Sutjeska 3:0, [[Podgorica City Stadium|Stadion pod Goricom]], 1974\n*'''Lowest / [[Podgorica]]:''' ''700'', Budu\u0107nost - Sutjeska 1:1, [[Podgorica City Stadium|Stadion pod Goricom]], 2018\n*'''Highest / [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]]:''' ''12,000'' Sutjeska - Budu\u0107nost 1:3, [[Gradski stadion (Nik\u0161i\u0107)|Stadion kraj Bistrice]], 1975\n*'''Lowest / [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]]:''' ''1,500'' Sutjeska - Budu\u0107nost 3:1, [[Gradski stadion (Nik\u0161i\u0107)|Stadion kraj Bistrice]], 1992; Sutjeska - Budu\u0107nost 1:0, [[Gradski stadion (Nik\u0161i\u0107)|Stadion kraj Bistrice]], 1995; Sutjeska - Budu\u0107nost 3:2, [[Gradski stadion (Nik\u0161i\u0107)|Stadion kraj Bistrice]], 2018\n\n====Attendance by venue====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

For FK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica home games, Varvari occupy the northern stand (Sjever) of the [[Podgorica city stadium]].
