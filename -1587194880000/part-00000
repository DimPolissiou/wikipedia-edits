An election is held at least once every five years as required by law, however, the house can be dissolved at any time at the request of the [[Taoiseach]] (head of government). D\u00e1il elections use a system of [[proportional representation]] by way of a [[single transferable vote]]. The D\u00e1il has had 166 members since 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&HouseNum=3&disp=mem|title=Members Database 1919 \u2013 2011 \u2013 Houses of the Oireachtas \u2013 Tithe an Oireachtais|publisher=Oireachtas|accessdate=24 November 2011}}</ref> The Seanad is not directly elected but consists of a mixture of members selected in a number of different ways. 43 senators are elected by councillors and parliamentarians, 11 are appointed by the Taoiseach, and six are elected by two [[university constituency|university constituencie]]s, thus having 60 members in total. The President of Ireland is directly elected once every seven years, and may serve a maximum of two terms, however, if, as has occurred on a number of occasions, a consensus among the larger political parties can result in only a single candidate being nominated, no actual ballot takes place.\n\n==Role==\nTo become law, a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] must first be approved by both the D\u00e1il and in most circumstances the Seanad (although the D\u00e1il can override a Seanad refusal to pass a Bill), and then signed into law by the President. Bills to amend the Constitution must also be approved by the People in a referendum prior to being presented to the President.  In most circumstances, the President is in effect obliged to sign all laws approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas, although he or she has the power to [[Advisory opinion|refer most bills to the Supreme Court for a ruling on constitutionality.]] The powers of the Seanad are in effect limited to delay rather than veto. It is the D\u00e1il, therefore, that is the supreme tier of the Irish legislature. The general [[enacting formula]] for [[Acts of the Oireachtas]] is: \"Be it enacted by the Oireachtas as follows:\u2014\", for an act with a preamble this enacting formula is, instead, \"Be it therefore enacted by the Oireachtas as follows:\u2014\".\n\n===Powers===\nThe Oireachtas has exclusive power to:\n\n* Legislate, including a power vested in the D\u00e1il of approving the financial resolutions relevant to the budget.

There are currently thirteen of these (the first ten below are based on the ten [[select committee]]s of the D\u00e1il):\n\n*Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine \n*Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection\n*Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht\n*Joint Committee on European Union Affairs\n*Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform\n*Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and Defence\n*Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement\n*Joint Committee on Health and Children\n*Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation\n*Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality\n*Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions\n*Joint Committee on Transport and Communications\n*Joint Committee on Administration\n*Standing Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills\n*Working Group of Committee Chairmen\n\n==History==\n\n''Oireachtas'' has been the title of two parliaments in [[History of Ireland|Irish history]]: the current Oireachtas of Ireland, since 1937, and, immediately before that, the [[Oireachtas of the Irish Free State]] of 1922\u20131937.\n\nThe earliest parliament in Ireland was the [[Parliament of Ireland]], which was founded in the thirteenth century as the supreme legislative body of the lordship of Ireland and was in existence until 1801. This parliament governed the English-dominated part of Ireland, which at first was limited to Dublin and surrounding cities, but later grew to include the entire island. But the Irish Parliament was, from the passage of [[Poynings' Law (on certification of acts)|Poynings' Law]] in 1494 until its repeal in 1782, subordinate to the English, and later British, [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]. This Parliament consisted of the [[Monarchy of Ireland|King of Ireland]], who was the same person as the King of England, a [[Irish House of Lords|House of the Lords]] and a [[Irish House of Commons|House of Commons]]. In 1800 the Irish Parliament abolished itself when, after widespread bribery of members, it adopted the [[Acts of Union 1800|Act of Union]], which came into effect from 1 January 1801.\n\nThe next legislature to exist in Ireland only came into being in 1919. This was a [[unicameralism|unicameral]] parliament established by [[Irish republicanism|Irish republicans]], known simply as [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Irish Republic)|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]]. This revolutionary D\u00e1il was notionally a legislature for the whole island of Ireland. In 1920, in parallel to the D\u00e1il, the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] created a [[home rule]] legislature called the [[Parliament of Southern Ireland]]. However this parliament was boycotted by most Irish politicians. It was made up of the King, the [[House of Commons of Southern Ireland]] and the [[Senate of Southern Ireland]]. The Parliament of Southern Ireland was formally abolished in 1922, with the establishment of the Oireachtas under the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]].\n\nThe Oireachtas of the Irish Free State consisted officially of the [[Monarchy in the Irish Free State|King]] and two houses, named, as their successors would be, D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (described, in this case, as a 'Chamber of Deputies') and Seanad \u00c9ireann. However the [[Seanad \u00c9ireann (Irish Free State)|Free State Senate]] was abolished in 1935. The modern Oireachtas came into being in 1937, with the adoption by referendum of the Constitution of Ireland.\n\n===Broadcasting===\nThe first Oireachtas radio and television broadcasts were of [[List of addresses to the Oireachtas|ceremonial addresses from dignitaries]], beginning with that of [[John F.

The D\u00e1il has had 166 members since 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&HouseNum=3&disp=mem|title=Members Database 1919 \u2013 2011 \u2013 Houses of the Oireachtas \u2013 Tithe an Oireachtais|publisher=Oireachtas|accessdate=24 November 2011}}</ref> The Seanad is not directly elected but consists of a mixture of members selected in a number of different ways. 43 senators are elected by councillors and parliamentarians, 11 are appointed by the Taoiseach, and six are elected by two [[university constituency|university constituencie]]s, thus having 60 members in total. The President of Ireland is directly elected once every seven years, and may serve a maximum of two terms, however, if, as has occurred on a number of occasions, a consensus among the larger political parties can result in only a single candidate being nominated, no actual ballot takes place.\n\n==Role==\nTo become law, a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] must first be approved by both the D\u00e1il and in most circumstances the Seanad (although the D\u00e1il can override a Seanad refusal to pass a Bill), and then signed into law by the President. Bills to amend the Constitution must also be approved by the People in a referendum prior to being presented to the President.  In most circumstances, the President is in effect obliged to sign all laws approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas, although he or she has the power to [[Advisory opinion|refer most bills to the Supreme Court for a ruling on constitutionality.]] The powers of the Seanad are in effect limited to delay rather than veto. It is the D\u00e1il, therefore, that is the supreme tier of the Irish legislature. The general [[enacting formula]] for [[Acts of the Oireachtas]] is: \"Be it enacted by the Oireachtas as follows:-\", for an act with a preamble this enacting formula is, instead, \"Be it therefore enacted by the Oireachtas as follows:\u2014\".\n\n===Powers===\nThe Oireachtas has exclusive power to:\n*Legislate, including a power vested in the D\u00e1il of approving the financial resolutions relevant to the budget.

There are currently thirteen of these (the first ten below are based on the ten [[select committee]]s of the D\u00e1il):\n\n*Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine \n*Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection\n*Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht\n*Joint Committee on European Union Affairs\n*Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform\n*Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and Defence\n*Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement\n*Joint Committee on Health and Children\n*Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation\n*Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality\n*Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions\n*Joint Committee on Transport and Communications\n*Joint Committee on Administration\n*Standing Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills\n*Working Group of Committee Chairmen\n\n==History==\n\n''Oireachtas'' has been the title of two parliaments in [[History of Ireland|Irish history]]: the current Oireachtas of Ireland, since 1937, and, immediately before that, the [[Oireachtas of the Irish Free State]] of 1922\u20131937.\n\nThe earliest parliament in Ireland was the [[Parliament of Ireland]], which was founded in the thirteenth century as the supreme legislative body of the lordship of Ireland and was in existence until 1801. This parliament governed the English-dominated part of Ireland, which at first was limited to Dublin and surrounding cities, but later grew to include the entire island. But the Irish Parliament was, from the passage of [[Poynings' Law (on certification of acts)|Poynings' Law]] in 1494 until its repeal in 1782, subordinate to the English, and later British, [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]. This Parliament consisted of the [[Monarchy of Ireland|King of Ireland]], who was the same person as the King of England, a [[Irish House of Lords|House of the Lords]] and a [[Irish House of Commons|House of Commons]]. In 1800 the Irish Parliament abolished itself when, after widespread bribery of members, it adopted the [[Acts of Union 1800|Act of Union]], which came into effect from 1 January 1801.\n\nThe next legislature to exist in Ireland only came into being in 1919. This was a [[unicameralism|unicameral]] parliament established by [[Irish republicanism|Irish republicans]], known simply as [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Irish Republic)|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]]. This revolutionary D\u00e1il was notionally a legislature for the whole island of Ireland. In 1920, in parallel to the D\u00e1il, the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] created a [[home rule]] legislature called the [[Parliament of Southern Ireland]]. However this parliament was boycotted by most Irish politicians. It was made up of the King, the [[House of Commons of Southern Ireland]] and the [[Senate of Southern Ireland]]. The Parliament of Southern Ireland was formally abolished in 1922, with the establishment of the Oireachtas under the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]].\n\nThe Oireachtas of the Irish Free State consisted officially of the [[Monarchy in the Irish Free State|King]] and two houses, named, as their successors would be, D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (described, in this case, as a 'Chamber of Deputies') and Seanad \u00c9ireann. However the [[Seanad \u00c9ireann (Irish Free State)|Free State Senate]] was abolished in 1935. The modern Oireachtas came into being in 1937, with the adoption by referendum of the Constitution of Ireland.\n\n===Broadcasting===\nThe first Oireachtas radio and television broadcasts were of [[List of addresses to the Oireachtas|ceremonial addresses from dignitaries]], beginning with that of [[John F.

Historically, there has been a difference in philosophy among optometry and medicine regarding the efficacy and relevance of vision therapy:  Major organizations, including the [[International Orthoptic Association]] and the [[American Academy of Ophthalmology]] have concluded that there is no validity for clinically significant improvements in vision with Behavioral Vision Therapy, and therefore do not practice it.<ref name=Barrett/> However, major optometric organizations, including the [[American Optometric Association]], the [[American Academy of Optometry]], the [[College of Optometrists in Vision Development]], and the [[Optometric Extension Program]], support the assertion that non-strabismic visual therapy does address underlying visual problems which are claimed to affect learning potential.  These optometric organizations are careful to distinguish, though, that vision therapy does not directly treat learning disorders.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Vision, learning and dyslexia.

Vision therapy is a subset of behavioral optometry.  In general, vision therapists attempt to improve vision, and therefore day-to-day [[well-being]], of patients using \"eye exercises,\" prism, and lenses, with more emphasis on the patient's visual function.  Among schools of medicine, ophthalmology does not see merit in the procedures surrounding many of behavioral optometry's practices, arguing that there have not been enough studies of high enough merit to warrant practicing of vision therapy.\n\n===== Techniques =====\nIn a 2008, vision scientist Brendan Barrett published a review of behavioral optometry at the invitation of the UK [[College of Optometrists]]. Barrett wrote that behavioral optometry was not a well-defined field but that it was sometimes said to be an \"extension\" to optometry, taking a [[holistic]] approach: practitioners of the therapy use techniques outside mainstream optometry to \"influence the visual process\". Barrett discussed these techniques under ten headings:\n\n*Vision therapy for accommodation/vergence disorders&nbsp;&ndash; eye exercises and training to try and alleviate these disorders. There is evidence that convergence disorders may be helped by eye exercises, but no good evidence exercises help with accommodation disorders. <ref name=Barrett/>\n*The underachieving child&nbsp;&ndash; therapies claimed to help children with [[dyslexia]], [[dyspraxia]] and [[attention deficit disorder]] &ndash; a \"vulnerable\" target market. There is no evidence that behavioral optometry is of any benefit in relation to these conditions.<ref name=Barrett/>\n*Prisms for near binocular disorders and for producing postural change&nbsp;&ndash; the use of \"yoked\" prisms to redirect a person's gaze and bring about a range of claimed benefits including postural improvements and increased wellbeing. There is a lack of evidence for the effect this approach may have.<ref name=Barrett/>\n*Near point stress and low-plus&nbsp;&ndash; the use of special lenses to adjust near-field vision, even for people who would not normally need glasses. This is claimed to bring about postural benefits and relieve visual stress. Some research has been carried out in this area and its effectiveness remains \"unproven\".<ref name=Barrett/>\n*Use of low-plus lenses at near to slow the progression of myopia<ref name=Barrett/>\n*Therapy to reduce myopia<ref name=Barrett/>\n*Behavioural approaches to the treatment of strabismus and amblyopia<ref name=Barrett/>\n*Training central and peripheral awareness and syntonics<ref name=Barrett/>\n*Sports vision therapy<ref name=Barrett/>\n*Neurological disorders and neurorehabilitation after trauma/stroke.<ref name=Barrett/>\n\nBarrett noted the lack of published controlled trials of the techniques. He found that there are a few areas where the available evidence suggest that the approach might have some value, namely in the treatment of convergence insufficiency, the use of yoked prisms in neurological patients, and in vision rehabilitation after brain disease or injury\u2014but he found that in the other areas where the techniques have been used, the majority, there is no evidence of their value.<ref name=Barrett/> In contrast, [[Steven Novella]] points out that the only condition that there is good quality scientific evidence for is convergence disorders.

Vision therapy is a subset of behavioral optometry.  In general, vision therapists attempt to improve vision, and therefore day-to-day [[well-being]], of patients using \"eye exercises,\" prism, and lenses, with more emphasis on the patient's visual function.  Among schools of medicine, ophthalmology does not see merit in the procedures surrounding many of behavioral optometry's practices, arguing that there have not been enough studies of high enough merit to warrant practicing of vision therapy.\n\n===== Techniques =====\nIn a 2008, vision scientist Brendan Barrett published a review of behavioral optometry at the invitation of the UK [[College of Optometrists]]. Barrett wrote that behavioral optometry was not a well-defined field but that it was sometimes said to be an \"extension\" to optometry, taking a [[holistic]] approach: practitioners of the therapy use techniques outside mainstream optometry to \"influence the visual process\". Barrett discussed these techniques under ten headings:\n\n*Vision therapy for accommodation/vergence disorders&nbsp;&ndash; eye exercises and training to try and alleviate these disorders. There is evidence that convergence disorders may be helped by eye exercises, but no good evidence exercises help with accommodation disorders. <ref name=Barrett/>\n*The underachieving child&nbsp;&ndash; therapies claimed to help children with [[dyslexia]], [[dyspraxia]] and [[attention deficit disorder]] &ndash; a \"vulnerable\" target market. There is no evidence that behavioral optometry is of any benefit in relation to these conditions.<ref name=Barrett/>\n*Prisms for near binocular disorders and for producing postural change&nbsp;&ndash; the use of \"yoked\" prisms to redirect a person's gaze and bring about a range of claimed benefits including postural improvements and increased wellbeing. There is a lack of evidence for the effect this approach may have.<ref name=Barrett/>\n*Near point stress and low-plus&nbsp;&ndash; the use of special lenses to adjust near-field vision, even for people who would not normally need glasses. This is claimed to bring about postural benefits and relieve visual stress. Some research has been carried out in this area and its effectiveness remains \"unproven\".<ref name=Barrett/>\n*Use of low-plus lenses at near to slow the progression of myopia<ref name=Barrett/>\n*Therapy to reduce myopia<ref name=Barrett/>\n*Behavioural approaches to the treatment of strabismus and amblyopia<ref name=Barrett/>\n*Training central and peripheral awareness and syntonics<ref name=Barrett/>\n*Sports vision therapy<ref name=Barrett/>\n*Neurological disorders and neurorehabilitation after trauma/stroke.<ref name=Barrett/>\n\nBarrett noted the lack of published controlled trials of the techniques. He found that there are a few areas where the available evidence suggest that the approach might have some value, namely in the treatment of convergence insufficiency, the use of yoked prisms in neurological patients, and in vision rehabilitation after brain disease or injury\u2014but he found that in the other areas where the techniques have been used, the majority, there is no evidence of their value.<ref name=Barrett/> In contrast, [[Steven Novella]] points out that the only condition that there is good quality scientific evidence for is convergence disorders. This points out a problem that is common with Complementary or integrative medicine, a type of [[Alternative medicine]], is that a promising use for treating a single disorder is applied to a wide range of disorders for which there is no evidence.<ref name=\"Vision therapy quackery\">{{cite web|last1=Novella|first1=Steven|authorlink=Steven Novella|title=Vision Therapy Quackery|url=https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/vision-therapy-quackery/|website=Science Based Medicine|accessdate=23 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n=====Eye exercises=====\nThe eye exercises used in vision therapy can generally be divided into two groups; those employed for \"strabismic\" outcomes and those employed for \"non-strabismic\" outcomes, to improve eye health.  \nOphthalmologists and orthoptists do not endorse these exercises as having clinically significant validity for improvements in vision. Usually, they see these perceptual-motor activities being in the sphere of either [[speech therapy]] or [[occupational therapy]].\n\nSome of the exercises used are\n*Near point of [[Convergence (eye)|convergence]] training, or the ability for both eyes to focus on a single point in space,\n*Base-out prism reading, [[stereoscopy|stereogram]] cards, computerized training programs are used to improve fusional vergence.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1199429-treatment | title=Convergence Insufficiency Treatment & Management | website=Medscape | accessdate=8 May 2014 | author=Michael J Bartiss}}</ref>\n*The wearing of [[convex lenses]]<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.ophth.wisc.edu/news/kushner_book/Eye%20Muscle%20Problems%20In%20Children%20and%20Adults.pdf | title=Eye Muscle Problems in Children and Adults: A Guide to Understanding | author=Burton J.

Behavioral Vision Therapy aims to treat problems including difficulties of '''visual attention and concentration''', which may manifest themselves as an inability to sustain focus or to shift focus from one area of space to another.\n\nSome of the exercises{{clarify|date=July 2013}} used are:\n*Marsden balls\n*Rotation trainers\n*Syntonics\n*Balance board/beams\n*Saccadic fixators\n*Directional sequencers\n\nFusional Amplitude and Relative Fusional Amplitude training{{clarify|date=July 2013}}\n*Designed to alleviate [[convergence insufficiency]].

Both optometry and ophthalmology were co-authors of this study.\n*Designed to alleviate intermittent [[exotropia]]<ref name=\"Zhang KK 2007\"/> or other less common forms of strabismus.\n\nCertain [[do-it-yourself]] eye exercises are claimed by some to improve [[visual acuity]] by reducing or eliminating [[refractive errors]].
