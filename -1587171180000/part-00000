When low cloud cover is present below the peak, light pollution is cut to almost nothing.{{citation needed|date = January 2014}}\n\nIn 1928, Donald C.

[[Edward Singleton Holden]] was the first director. The location provided excellent viewing performance because of lack of ambient light and pollution; additionally, the night air at the top of Mt.

When low cloud cover is present below the peak, light pollution is cut to almost nothing.{{citation needed|date = January 2014}}\n\nIn 1928, Donald C.

However, funding for the move was not available, and in 1980 San Jose began a program to reduce the effects of lighting, most notably replacing all streetlamps with [[Sodium vapor lamp#Low pressure / LPS / SOX|low pressure sodium lamps]].

The school colors, orange and blue, are a reference to the region's heritage and an homage to the Scottish and Ulster-Scots Presbyterian heritage of the original founders of Gainesville and Alachua County, most of whom were settlers from North Carolina whose ancestors were primarily Presbyterians of Scottish descent who had come to America from [[County Down]] and [[County Antrim]] in what has become [[Northern Ireland]], while some had come directly from the [[Scottish Lowlands]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Ulster and North America: Transatlantic Perspectives on the Scotch-Irish|last=Wood|first=Curtis|publisher=University of Alabama Press |year=1997|location=Tuscaloosa, Alabama}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Biohistory of Alachua County, Florida |last=William Zettler|first=Francis|publisher=Pineapple Press Inc Press|year=2015|location=Sarasota, Florida |pages=64, 79 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Ulster to America: The Scots-Irish Migration Experience, 1680\u20131830 |last=Hofstra|first=Warren R. |publisher=Univ. of Tennessee Press|year=2011|location=Knoxville, Tennessee |pages=140, 153 }}</ref>\n<ref>University of Florida, History, [http://www.ufl.edu/history/1906.html University of Florida History 1906-1927] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231184043/http://www.ufl.edu/history/1906.html |date=December 31, 2010 }}.

Kelly, who disliked cold weather, listed the [[Minnesota Vikings]], [[Green Bay Packers]], and [[Buffalo Bills]]. He was pleased to see while watching the 1983 draft on television that the Bills did not select him as the 12th pick in the first round, but learned from his agent that the team had another first-round pick; the Bills chose Kelly as the 14th pick. Although Kelly at the time stated that he had expected the Bills to choose him, he later said, \"You have to say those things ... I cried. (Laughs) I didn't really literally cry. I just had tears. I'm like, 'You got to be kidding me.'\"<ref name=\"30for30\">{{cite episode | title=Elway to Marino | series=30 for 30 | network=ESPN | airdate=2013-04-23 | season=2}}</ref>\n\nAlthough he believed that team owner [[Ralph Wilson]] would not bring in the right players to build a championship team,{{r|Page2}} Kelly was resigned to playing for the Bills. While meeting with the team to negotiate his contract, however, a Bills secretary mistakenly let [[Bruce Allen (American football)|Bruce Allen]], general manager of the rival [[United States Football League]]'s [[Chicago Blitz]], reach Kelly on the telephone; Allen persuaded Kelly to leave the meeting. Kelly later claimed that the USFL offered him his choice of teams because of the league's interest in signing quarterbacks. He signed with the [[Houston Gamblers]], who played in the climate-controlled [[Houston Astrodome]], and said, \"Would you rather be in Houston or Buffalo?\"{{r|30for30}}\n\nIn two seasons in Houston leading offensive coach [[Mouse Davis]]'s run-and-shoot offense, Kelly threw for 9,842 yards and 83 touchdowns, completing 63% with an average of 8.53 yards per attempt with 45 interceptions. He was the USFL MVP in 1984, when he set a league record with 5,219 yards passing and 44 touchdown passes. Kelly's USFL records eclipsed those of fellow league quarterbacks [[Doug Williams (American football)|Doug Williams]] and [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]]. When the Houston Gamblers folded, Kelly went to the [[New Jersey Generals]] and was slated as their starting quarterback.

The game was supposed to be televised by ABC, but they opted to cover [[Doug Flutie]]'s debut with the [[New Jersey Generals]] instead. Only cameramen that worked for both teams were on hand to record the game. Houston raced out to an early lead, but the Express mounted a comeback that led to them being ahead 33-14 with just under ten minutes left in the game. Kelly lead the Gamblers on a comeback that would see them pull off a 34-33 win, and in the end, Kelly threw for 574 yards.<ref>https://www.thesportscol.com/2017/05/sports-illustrated-called-it-greatest-game-no-one-saw/</ref>\n\nKelly threw three touchdown passes in the last Gambler drives of the game, including what turned out to be the game winner, a 39-yard strike to receiver [[Ricky Sanders]]. The Express thought they had the game won, especially after safety [[Troy West]] picked off a Kelly pass, and returned it 42 yards for a touchdown. The Gamblers got the ball back and it just took two plays for them to score, as Kelly tossed a pass to [[Richard Johnson (wide receiver)|Richard Johnson]] that ended up being a 52-yard score. The drive took less than a minute. The Gamblers defense forced a punt, and the offense scored again, this time Kelly found receiver [[Vince Courville]] for a 20-yard strike. The drive was aided by a poor punt from Express punter Jeff Partridge that only netted 16 yards and allowed the Gamblers to take over at the Express 43 yard line.<ref name=\"latimes.com\">https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-02-25-sp-33480-story.html</ref>\n\nKelly found Sanders for the go-ahead score, Sanders beating Troy West on the play. West had picked off two Kelly passes that day, but Kelly ended up with the last laugh. The Express were driving to get in range for their placekicker, [[Tony Zendejas]] to kick what had the potential to be the game winner. That was not to be as Young was picked off by Gamblers linebacker [[Mike Hawkins (linebacker)|Mike Hawkins]].<ref name=\"latimes.com\"/>\n\n===Buffalo Bills===\n\nKelly finally joined the Bills (who had retained his NFL rights) in [[1986 Buffalo Bills season|1986]] after the USFL folded. He helped lead the Bills to four consecutive Super Bowl appearances ([[Super Bowl XXV]]\u2013[[Super Bowl XXVIII]]) and six divisional championships from 1988 to 1995. Buffalo made the playoffs in eight of Kelly's 11 seasons as their starting quarterback. Kelly's primary 'go-to' wide receiver with the Bills, [[Andre Reed]], ranks among the NFL's all-time leaders in several receiving categories. Kelly and Reed connected for 65 touchdowns during their career together trailing only the tandems of [[Peyton Manning]] and [[Marvin Harrison]] (112), [[Philip Rivers]] and [[Antonio Gates]], (87), [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]] and [[Jerry Rice]] (85), [[Dan Marino]] and [[Mark Gregory Clayton|Mark Clayton]] (79), [[Peyton Manning]] and [[Reggie Wayne]] (69), and [[Drew Brees]] and [[Marques Colston]] (68) for touchdowns by an NFL quarterback and receiver tandem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jimkelly.com/scrapbook/career_bills_reed.htm |title=From East Brady to Canton... |accessdate=November 30, 2007|url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112010803/http://www.jimkelly.com/scrapbook/career_bills_reed.htm|archivedate=November 12, 2007}}</ref>\nKelly, along with [[Andre Reed]], [[Bruce Smith (defensive end)|Bruce Smith]], [[Thurman Thomas]], and [[Scott Norwood]], was the subject of the ''[[30 for 30]]'' film&mdash;''[[Four Falls of Buffalo]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/30for30/film?page=fourfalls|title=Four Falls of Buffalo - ESPN Films: 30 for 30|website=espn.go.com}}</ref>\n\n====\"No-huddle offense\"====\nKelly ran the Bills' \"K-Gun\" [[no-huddle offense]], which was a fast-paced offense named after tight end Keith McKeller, that denied opposing defenses the opportunity to make timely substitutions (the NFL later changed the rules in response to this to allow opposing defenses time to change formations under no-huddle situations, but this applied only if the offense made personnel substitutions). This offensive scheme called for multiple formation calls in a huddle, so that after each play was completed, the Bills would eschew a following huddle, instead lining up for the next play where Kelly would read the defense and audible the play. This led to mismatches and defensive communication breakdowns and, in the 1990s, established the Bills as one of the NFL's most successful and dangerous offenses, instrumental in leading Buffalo to four consecutive Super Bowl appearances.\n\n==Statistics==\n'''USFL'''\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Year !! rowspan=\"2\"|Team !! colspan=\"2\"|Games !! colspan=\"7\"|Passing\n|-\n!

February 14, 1960) is a former [[American football]] [[quarterback]] who played in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for eleven seasons all with the [[Buffalo Bills]]. He also played two seasons with the [[Houston Gamblers]] in the [[United States Football League]] (USFL).\n\nKelly was selected by the Bills in the first round of [[1983 NFL draft]] and was taken 14th overall. He chose to sign with the Gamblers instead and did not play for the Bills until the USFL folded in 1986. Employing the [[Hurry-up offense#Development as a standard method|\"K-Gun\" offense]], known for its no-huddle shotgun formations, Kelly led one of the greatest NFL scoring juggernauts. From 1990 season to the 1993 season, he helped guide the Bills to a record four consecutive [[Super Bowl]]s, although the team lost each game.  (Only two other teams have gone to three straight Super Bowls, the Miami Dolphins, with [[Bob Griese]], and the New England Patriots, with [[Tom Brady]].)\n\nIn 2002, Kelly was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]], his first year of eligibility. His jersey number 12 is one of only three numbers retired by the Buffalo Bills as of 2020.\n\n==Early life==\nKelly was born in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/players/jimkelly/profile?id=KEL581385|title=Jim Kelly|work=NFL.com|accessdate=May 20, 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.buffalobills.com/history/HOFKelly.jsp Buffalo Bills website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116143146/http://www.buffalobills.com/history/HOFKelly.jsp |date=November 16, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://insider.espn.go.com/nfl/players/fantasy?statsId=34&action=login&appRedirect=http%3a%2f%2finsider.espn.go.com%2fnfl%2fplayers%2ffantasy%3fstatsId%3d34|title=NFL - Players Rosters - National Football League - ESPN|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=May 20, 2015}}</ref> and grew up about 60 miles to the northeast, in [[East Brady, Pennsylvania|East Brady]].

Kelly, who disliked cold weather, listed the [[Minnesota Vikings]], [[Green Bay Packers]], and [[Buffalo Bills]]. He was pleased to see while watching the 1983 draft on television that the Bills did not select him as the 12th pick in the first round, but learned from his agent that the team had another first-round pick; the Bills chose Kelly as the 14th pick. Although Kelly at the time stated that he had expected the Bills to choose him, he later said, \"You have to say those things ... I cried. (Laughs) I didn't really literally cry. I just had tears. I'm like, 'You got to be kidding me.'\"<ref name=\"30for30\">{{cite episode | title=Elway to Marino | series=30 for 30 | network=ESPN | airdate=2013-04-23 | season=2}}</ref>\n\nAlthough he believed that team owner [[Ralph Wilson]] would not bring in the right players to build a championship team,{{r|Page2}} Kelly was resigned to playing for the Bills. While meeting with the team to negotiate his contract, however, a Bills secretary mistakenly let [[Bruce Allen (American football)|Bruce Allen]], general manager of the rival [[United States Football League]]'s [[Chicago Blitz]], reach Kelly on the telephone; Allen persuaded Kelly to leave the meeting. Kelly later claimed that the USFL offered him his choice of teams because of the league's interest in signing quarterbacks. He signed with the [[Houston Gamblers]], who played in the climate-controlled [[Houston Astrodome]], and said, \"Would you rather be in Houston or Buffalo?\"{{r|30for30}}\n\nIn two seasons in Houston leading offensive coach [[Mouse Davis]]'s run-and-shoot offense, Kelly threw for 9,842 yards and 83 touchdowns, completing 63% with an average of 8.53 yards per attempt with 45 interceptions. He was the USFL MVP in 1984, when he set a league record with 5,219 yards passing and 44 touchdown passes. Kelly's USFL records eclipsed those of fellow league quarterbacks [[Doug Williams (American football)|Doug Williams]] and [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]]. When the Houston Gamblers folded, Kelly went to the [[New Jersey Generals]] and was slated as their starting quarterback. Kelly [[Sports Illustrated cover jinx|appeared on a cover]] of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' while holding a Generals' helmet, but the league collapsed before he ever fielded a snap with the Generals.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jim Kelly, Football, New Jersey Generals |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] (SI Vault) |date=July 21, 1986 |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/cover/featured/9019/index.htm |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310164253/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/cover/featured/9019/index.htm |archivedate=March 10, 2011 }}</ref> Kelly remained on good terms with Generals owner [[Donald Trump]], who provided his family with lodging during Kelly's later health issues.<ref>[http://insider.foxnews.com/2017/01/25/jim-kelly-cancer-donald-trump-support-varney Fmr QB Jim Kelly: Trump 'Took Care of My Whole Family'].

The game was supposed to be televised by ABC, but they opted to cover [[Doug Flutie]]'s debut with the [[New Jersey Generals]] instead. Only cameramen that worked for both teams were on hand to record the game. Houston raced out to an early, lead, but the Express mounted a comeback that led to them being ahead 33-14 with just under ten minutes left in the game. Kelly lead the Gamblers on a comeback that would see them pull off a 34-33 win, and in the end, Kelly threw for 574 yards.<ref>https://www.thesportscol.com/2017/05/sports-illustrated-called-it-greatest-game-no-one-saw/</ref>\n\nKelly threw three touchdown passes in the last Gambler drives of the game, including what turned out to be the game winner, a 39-yard strike to receiver [[Ricky Sanders]]. The Express thought they had the game won, especially after safety [[Troy West]] picked off a Kelly pass, and returned it 42 yards for a touchdown. The Gamblers got the ball back and it just took two plays for them to score, as Kelly tossed a pass to [[Richard Johnson (wide receiver)|Richard Johnson]] that ended up being a 52-yard score. The drive took less than a minute. The Gamblers defense forced a punt, and the offense scored again, this time Kelly found receiver [[Vince Courville]] for a 20-yard strike. The drive was aided by a poor punt from Express punter Jeff Partridge that only netted 16 yards and allowed the Gamblers to take over at the Express 43 yard line.<ref name=\"latimes.com\">https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-02-25-sp-33480-story.html</ref>\n\nKelly found Sanders for the go-ahead score, Sanders beating Troy West on the play. West had picked off two Kelly passes that day, but Kelly ended up with the last laugh. The Express were driving to get in range for their placekicker, [[Tony Zendejas]] to kick what had the potential to be the game winner. That was not to be as Young was picked off by Gamblers linebacker [[Mike Hawkins (linebacker)|Mike Hawkins]].<ref name=\"latimes.com\"/>\n\n===Buffalo Bills===\n\nKelly finally joined the Bills (who had retained his NFL rights) in [[1986 Buffalo Bills season|1986]] after the USFL folded. He helped lead the Bills to four consecutive Super Bowl appearances ([[Super Bowl XXV]]\u2013[[Super Bowl XXVIII]]) and six divisional championships from 1988 to 1995. Buffalo made the playoffs in eight of Kelly's 11 seasons as their starting quarterback. Kelly's primary 'go-to' wide receiver with the Bills, [[Andre Reed]], ranks among the NFL's all-time leaders in several receiving categories. Kelly and Reed connected for 65 touchdowns during their career together trailing only the tandems of [[Peyton Manning]] and [[Marvin Harrison]] (112), [[Philip Rivers]] and [[Antonio Gates]], (87), [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]] and [[Jerry Rice]] (85), [[Dan Marino]] and [[Mark Gregory Clayton|Mark Clayton]] (79), [[Peyton Manning]] and [[Reggie Wayne]] (69), and [[Drew Brees]] and [[Marques Colston]] (68) for touchdowns by an NFL quarterback and receiver tandem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jimkelly.com/scrapbook/career_bills_reed.htm |title=From East Brady to Canton... |accessdate=November 30, 2007|url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112010803/http://www.jimkelly.com/scrapbook/career_bills_reed.htm|archivedate=November 12, 2007}}</ref>\nKelly, along with [[Andre Reed]], [[Bruce Smith (defensive end)|Bruce Smith]], [[Thurman Thomas]], and [[Scott Norwood]], was the subject of the ''[[30 for 30]]'' film&mdash;''[[Four Falls of Buffalo]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/30for30/film?page=fourfalls|title=Four Falls of Buffalo - ESPN Films: 30 for 30|website=espn.go.com}}</ref>\n\n====\"No-huddle offense\"====\nKelly ran the Bills' \"K-Gun\" [[no-huddle offense]], which was a fast-paced offense named after tight end Keith McKeller, that denied opposing defenses the opportunity to make timely substitutions (the NFL later changed the rules in response to this to allow opposing defenses time to change formations under no-huddle situations, but this applied only if the offense made personnel substitutions). This offensive scheme called for multiple formation calls in a huddle, so that after each play was completed, the Bills would eschew a following huddle, instead lining up for the next play where Kelly would read the defense and audible the play. This led to mismatches and defensive communication breakdowns and, in the 1990s, established the Bills as one of the NFL's most successful and dangerous offenses, instrumental in leading Buffalo to four consecutive Super Bowl appearances.\n\n==Statistics==\n'''USFL'''\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Year !! rowspan=\"2\"|Team !! colspan=\"2\"|Games !! colspan=\"7\"|Passing\n|-\n!

Kelly's advocacy on behalf of Krabbe patients has increased national awareness of the disease.  He and his wife Jill founded the annual Hunter's Day of Hope, which is held on February 14, the birthdays of both Jim and Hunter Kelly.  The [http://hjkri.buffalo.edu/ Hunter James Kelly Research Institute] was founded at the University of Buffalo in 2004, where neuroscientists and clinicians are studying myelin and its diseases. When Kelly was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2002, he dedicated his speech to Hunter. \"It's been written that the trademark of my career was toughness,\" he said as he choked back tears. \"The toughest person I ever met in my life was my hero, my soldier, my son, Hunter. I love you, buddy.\"\n\nKelly is a devout [[Christians|Christian]], and has several business ventures, including Hall of Fame Life Promotions, a promotional company that is committed to donating a percentage of all of its proceeds to the Hunter's Hope Foundation. In 2011, Kelly founded Jim Kelly Inc. a company which produces the MyFanClip line of all purpose clips which bear sports team logos and other insignia. MyFanClip has licensing agreements with the NFL, MLB, NHL and NASCAR. Proceeds also benefit the Hunter's Hope Foundation.\n\nSince 1988, Kelly has run a football camp for youths between the ages of eight to 18 at the Buffalo Bills facilities. It started with 325 campers in its first year, growing to over 500 campers a year. This camp provides teaching from experienced coaches and previous players from all over the country. Kelly also participates in various drills with the participants.\n\nOn June 3, 2013, Kelly announced that he had been diagnosed with [[squamous cell carcinoma]], a form of cancer, in his upper jaw.

However, the 13-hour \"duty time\" (flight duration, plus pre-flight preparation) required for the Rio-Paris route exceeds the 10 hours permitted before a pilot must take a break dictated by Air France's procedures. To comply with these procedures, Flight 447 was crewed by three pilots: a captain and two first officers.<ref>[[#CITEREFBEA first2009|BEA first 2009]] 1.17.2.3 \"Air France procedures\"</ref> With three pilots on board, each could take a break in the A330's rest cabin located behind the cockpit.{{sfn|BEA first|2009|loc=\u00a71.17.2.2}}\n\nIn accordance with common practice, captain Dubois had sent one of the co-pilots for the first rest period with the intention of taking the second break himself.{{sfn|BEA final|2012|loc=\u00a72.1.1.3.1|ps=,\"Choice of time period\"}} At 01:55 UTC, he woke first officer Robert and said: \"... he's going to take my place\". After attending the briefing between the two co-pilots, the captain left the cockpit to rest at 02:01:46 UTC. At 02:06 UTC, the pilot warned the cabin crew that they were about to enter an area of turbulence. About two to three minutes later, the aircraft encountered [[icing conditions]] (the [[cockpit voice recorder]] recorded what sounded like hail or [[graupel]] on the outside of the aircraft) and [[ice crystals]] started to accumulate in the [[pitot tube]]s, which measure airspeed.{{sfn|BEA third|2011|p=73}} Bonin turned the aircraft slightly to the left and decreased its speed from [[Mach number|Mach]] 0.82 to Mach 0.8 (the recommended \"turbulence penetration speed\").

As the pilot flying the aircraft, Bonin used the side stick priority button to take control, and said, \"I have the controls.\" Without the auto-pilot, the aircraft started to roll to the right due to turbulence, and Bonin reacted by deflecting his side-stick to the left. One consequence of the change to alternate law was an increase in the aircraft's sensitivity to roll, and the pilot's input over-corrected. During the next 30 seconds, the aircraft rolled alternately left and right as Bonin adjusted to the altered handling characteristics of the aircraft.{{sfn|Palmer|2013|p=86}} At the same time he abruptly pulled back on his side-stick, raising the nose. This action has been described as unnecessary and excessive under the circumstances.{{sfn|BEA final|2012|loc=\u00a72.1.2.3|ps=,\"The excessive amplitude of these [nose-up] inputs made them unsuitable and incompatible with the recommended aeroplane handling practices for high altitude flight.\"}} The aircraft's [[stall warning]] sounded briefly twice due to the angle of attack tolerance being exceeded<!-- by short vertical accelerations due to turbulence-->, and the aircraft's recorded airspeed dropped sharply from {{convert|274|kn}} to {{convert|52|kn}}. The aircraft's [[angle of attack]] increased, and the aircraft started to climb above its cruising level of FL350. By the time the pilot had control of the aircraft's roll, it was climbing at nearly {{convert|7000|ft/min|m/s km/h}}{{sfn|Palmer|2013|p=86}} For comparison, the typical normal rate of climb for modern airliners is {{convert|2000\u20133,000|ft/min|m/s km/h}} at sea level, and much smaller at high altitude and, also for comparison, a typical updraft speed for a severe storm is 120&nbsp;km/h.\n\nAt 02:10:34 UTC, after displaying incorrectly for half a minute, the left-side instruments recorded a sharp rise in airspeed to {{convert|223|kn}}, as did the [[Integrated Standby Instrument System]] (ISIS) 33 seconds later{{sfn|BEA final appx2|2012|ps=:<br />\n<u>2 h 10 min 08</u>: CAS changes from 274kt to 156kt.

There, its angle of attack was 16 degrees, and the engine thrust levers were in the fully forward [[Takeoff/Go-around switch|Takeoff/Go-around detent]] (TOGA). As the aircraft began to descend, the angle of attack rapidly increased toward 30 degrees. A second consequence of the reconfiguration into alternate law was that stall protection no longer operated. Whereas in normal law, the aircraft's flight management computers would have acted to prevent such a high angle of attack, in alternate law this did not happen. (Indeed, the switch into alternate law occurred precisely because the computers, denied reliable speed data, were no longer able to provide such protection\u2014nor many of the other functions expected of normal law.){{sfn|Palmer|2013|pp=78\u201380}} The wings lost [[lift (force)|lift]] and the aircraft [[stall (flight)|stalled]].{{sfn|BEA third|2011}}{{page needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nIn response to the stall, first officer Bonin exclaimed \"(Expletive) <ref name=\"understandingaf447.com\"/> I don't have control of the airplane any more now\", and two seconds later, \"I don't have control of the airplane at all!\" First officer Robert responded to this by saying, \"controls to the left\", and took over control of the aircraft.<ref>https://www.bea.aero/uploads/tx_elyextendttnews/annexe.01.en_03.pdf</ref><ref name=\"popularmechanics.com\"/> Robert pushed his control stick forward to lower the nose and recover from the stall; however, Bonin was still pulling his control stick back. The inputs [[Cancelling out|cancelled each other out]] and triggered a \"dual input\" warning.\n\nAt 02:11:40 UTC, captain Dubois re-entered the cockpit after being summoned by first officer Robert. Noticing the various alarms going off, he asked the two crew members, \"er what the hell are you doing?\"<!-- direct from the CVR transcript.--><ref name=\"popularmechanics.com\">https://www.popularmechanics.com/flight/a3115/what-really-happened-aboard-air-france-447-6611877/</ref> The angle of attack had then reached 40 degrees, and the aircraft had descended to {{convert|35000|ft}} with the engines running at almost 100% [[airbreathing jet engine#Terminology|N<sub>1</sub>]] (the rotational speed of the front intake fan, which delivers most of a [[turbofan]] engine's thrust). The stall warnings stopped, as all airspeed indications were now considered invalid by the aircraft's computer due to the high angle of attack.{{sfn|Palmer|2013|p=57|ps=: \"This created a situation where the air was pushing into, in addition to flowing over, the static ports. [...] This dynamic accounts for the repeated falling of the airspeed to invalid values.\"}} The aircraft had its nose above the horizon but was descending steeply.\n\nRoughly 20 seconds later, at 02:12 UTC, the pilot decreased the aircraft's [[pitch (aviation)|pitch]] slightly, airspeed indications became valid, and the stall warning sounded again; it then sounded intermittently for the remaining duration of the flight, but stopped when the pilot increased the aircraft's nose-up pitch. From there until the end of the flight, the angle of attack never dropped below 35 degrees. From the time the aircraft stalled until its impact with the ocean, the engines were primarily developing either 100 percent N<sub>1</sub> or TOGA thrust, though they were briefly spooled down to about 50 percent N<sub>1</sub> on two occasions. The engines always responded to commands and were developing in excess of 100 percent N<sub>1</sub> when the flight ended.  First officer Robert responded to Captain Dubois by saying: \"We've lost all control of the aeroplane, we don\u2019t understand anything, we\u2019ve tried everything\".<ref name=\"popularmechanics.com\"/> Soon after this, Robert said to himself, \"climb\" four times.

interim report stated that some new facts had been established.

This confirmed the findings of the preliminary reports and provided additional details and recommendations to improve safety. According to the final report,{{sfn|BEA final|2012}} the accident resulted from the following succession of major events:\n* temporary inconsistency between the measured speeds, likely as a result of the obstruction of the pitot tubes by ice crystals, causing autopilot disconnection and reconfiguration to [[alternate law#Alternate law|alternate law]];\n* the crew made inappropriate control inputs that destabilized the flight path;\n* the crew failed to follow appropriate procedure for loss of displayed airspeed information;\n* the crew were late in identifying and correcting the deviation from the flight path;\n* the crew lacked understanding of the approach to stall;\n* the crew failed to recognize the aircraft had stalled and consequently did not make inputs that would have made it possible to recover from the stall.{{sfn|BEA final|2012|p=200}}\n\nThese events resulted from the following major factors in combination:{{sfn|BEA final|2012}}\n* feedback mechanisms on the part of those involved made it impossible to identify and remedy the repeated non-application of the procedure for inconsistent airspeed, and to ensure that crews were trained in icing of the pitot probes and its consequences;\n* the crew lacked practical training in manually handling the aircraft both at high altitude and in the event of anomalies of speed indication;\n* the two co-pilots' task sharing was weakened both by incomprehension of the situation at the time of autopilot disconnection, and by poor management of the \"[[Startle response|startle effect]]\", leaving them in an emotionally charged situation;\n* the cockpit lacked a clear display of the inconsistencies in airspeed readings identified by the flight computers;\n* the crew did not respond to the stall warning, whether due to a failure to identify the aural warning, to the transience of the stall warnings that could have been considered spurious, to the absence of any visual information that could confirm that the aircraft was approaching stall after losing the characteristic speeds, to confusing stall-related [[Buffeting|buffet]] for overspeed-related buffet, to the indications by the Flight Director that might have confirmed the crew's mistaken view of their actions, or to difficulty in identifying and understanding the implications of the switch to alternate law, which does not protect the angle of attack.\n\n==Independent analyses==\nBefore and after the publication of the final report by the BEA in July 2012, there were many independent analyses and expert opinions published in the media about the cause of the accident.\n\n===Significance of the accident===\nIn May 2011, [[Wil S. Hylton]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' commented that the crash \"was easy to bend into myth\" because \"no other passenger jet in modern history had disappeared so completely\u2014without a Mayday call or a witness or even a trace on radar.\" Hylton explained that the A330 \"was considered to be among the safest\" of the passenger aircraft. Hylton added that when \"Flight 447 seemed to disappear from the sky, it was tempting to deliver a tidy narrative about the hubris of building a self-flying aircraft, Icarus falling from the sky.

The investigators also pointed to the lack of a clear display of the airspeed inconsistencies even though the computers had identified them. Some systems generated failure messages only about the consequences but never mentioned the origin of the problem. The investigators recommended a blocked pitot tube should be clearly indicated as such to the crew on the flight displays. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' pointed out the absence of angle of attack information, which is so important in identifying and preventing a stall.<ref name=Ross/> The paper stated that \"though angle of attack readings are sent to onboard computers, there are no displays in modern jets to convey this critical information to the crews\". ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' indicated the difficulty the pilots faced in diagnosing the problem: \"One alarm after another lit up the cockpit monitors.

The ''Spiegel'' report asserts that such a crash \"could happen again\".\n\nIn an article in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', [[William Langewiesche]] noted that once the angle of attack was so extreme, the system rejected the data as invalid and temporarily stopped the stall warnings. However, \"this led to a perverse reversal that lasted nearly to the impact: each time Bonin happened to lower the nose, rendering the angle of attack marginally less severe, the stall warning sounded again\u2014a negative reinforcement that may have locked him into his pattern of pitching up\", which increased the angle of attack and thus aggravated the stall.<ref name=VF201410>{{cite news |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/business/2014/10/air-france-flight-447-crash |newspaper=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |title=The Human Factor |first1=William |last1=Langewiesche |first2=Sean.

However, the 13-hour \"duty time\" (flight duration, plus pre-flight preparation) required for the Rio-Paris route exceeds the 10 hours permitted before a pilot must take a break dictated by Air France's procedures. To comply with these procedures, Flight 447 was crewed by three pilots: a captain and two first officers.<ref>[[#CITEREFBEA first2009|BEA first 2009]] 1.17.2.3 \"Air France procedures\"</ref> With three pilots on board, each could take a break in the A330's rest cabin located behind the cockpit.{{sfn|BEA first|2009|loc=\u00a71.17.2.2}}\n\nIn accordance with common practice, captain Dubois had sent one of the co-pilots for the first rest period with the intention of taking the second break himself.{{sfn|BEA final|2012|loc=\u00a72.1.1.3.1|ps=,\"Choice of time period\"}} At 01:55 UTC, he woke first officer Robert and said: \"... he's going to take my place\". After attending the briefing between the two co-pilots, the captain left the cockpit to rest at 02:01:46 UTC. At 02:06 UTC, the pilot warned the cabin crew that they were about to enter an area of turbulence. About two to three minutes later, the aircraft encountered [[icing conditions]] (the [[cockpit voice recorder]] recorded what sounded like hail or [[graupel]] on the outside of the aircraft) and [[ice crystals]] started to accumulate in the [[pitot tube]]s, which measure airspeed.{{sfn|BEA third|2011|p=73}} Bonin turned the aircraft slightly to the left and decreased its speed from [[Mach number|Mach]] 0.82 to Mach 0.8 (the recommended \"turbulence penetration speed\").

As the pilot flying the aircraft, Bonin used the side stick priority button to take control, and said, \"I have the controls.\" Without the auto-pilot, the aircraft started to roll to the right due to turbulence, and Bonin reacted by deflecting his side-stick to the left. One consequence of the change to alternate law was an increase in the aircraft's sensitivity to roll, and the pilot's input over-corrected. During the next 30 seconds, the aircraft rolled alternately left and right as Bonin adjusted to the altered handling characteristics of the aircraft.{{sfn|Palmer|2013|p=86}} At the same time he abruptly pulled back on his side-stick, raising the nose. This action has been described as unnecessary and excessive under the circumstances.{{sfn|BEA final|2012|loc=\u00a72.1.2.3|ps=,\"The excessive amplitude of these [nose-up] inputs made them unsuitable and incompatible with the recommended aeroplane handling practices for high altitude flight.\"}} The aircraft's [[stall warning]] sounded briefly twice due to the angle of attack tolerance being exceeded<!-- by short vertical accelerations due to turbulence-->, and the aircraft's recorded airspeed dropped sharply from {{convert|274|kn}} to {{convert|52|kn}}. The aircraft's [[angle of attack]] increased, and the aircraft started to climb above its cruising level of FL350. By the time the pilot had control of the aircraft's roll, it was climbing at nearly {{convert|7000|ft/min|m/s km/h}}{{sfn|Palmer|2013|p=86}} For comparison, the typical normal rate of climb for modern airliners is {{convert|2000\u20133,000|ft/min|m/s km/h}} at sea level, and much smaller at high altitude and, also for comparison, a typical updraft speed for a severe storm is 120&nbsp;km/h.\n\nAt 02:10:34 UTC, after displaying incorrectly for half a minute, the left-side instruments recorded a sharp rise in airspeed to {{convert|223|kn}}, as did the [[Integrated Standby Instrument System]] (ISIS) 33 seconds later{{sfn|BEA final appx2|2012|ps=:<br />\n<u>2 h 10 min 08</u>: CAS changes from 274kt to 156kt.

There, its angle of attack was 16 degrees, and the engine thrust levers were in the fully forward [[Takeoff/Go-around switch|Takeoff/Go-around detent]] (TOGA). As the aircraft began to descend, the angle of attack rapidly increased toward 30 degrees. A second consequence of the reconfiguration into alternate law was that stall protection no longer operated. Whereas in normal law, the aircraft's flight management computers would have acted to prevent such a high angle of attack, in alternate law this did not happen. (Indeed, the switch into alternate law occurred precisely because the computers, denied reliable speed data, were no longer able to provide such protection\u2014nor many of the other functions expected of normal law.){{sfn|Palmer|2013|pp=78\u201380}} The wings lost [[lift (force)|lift]] and the aircraft [[stall (flight)|stalled]].{{sfn|BEA third|2011}}{{page needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nIn response to the stall, first officer Bonin exclaimed \"(Expletive) <ref name=\"understandingaf447.com\"/> I don't have control of the airplane any more now\", and two seconds later, \"I don't have control of the airplane at all!\" First officer Robert responded to this by saying, \"controls to the left\", and took over control of the aircraft.<ref>https://www.bea.aero/uploads/tx_elyextendttnews/annexe.01.en_03.pdf</ref><ref name=\"popularmechanics.com\"/> Robert pushed his control stick forward to lower the nose and recover from the stall; however, Bonin was still pulling his control stick back. The inputs [[Cancelling out|cancelled each other out]] and triggered a \"dual input\" warning.\n\nAt 02:11:40 UTC, captain Dubois re-entered the cockpit after being summoned by first officer Robert. Noticing the various alarms going off, he asked the two crew members, \"er what the hell are you doing?\"<!-- direct from the CVR transcript.--><ref name=\"popularmechanics.com\">https://www.popularmechanics.com/flight/a3115/what-really-happened-aboard-air-france-447-6611877/</ref> The angle of attack had then reached 40 degrees, and the aircraft had descended to {{convert|35000|ft}} with the engines running at almost 100% [[airbreathing jet engine#Terminology|N<sub>1</sub>]] (the rotational speed of the front intake fan, which delivers most of a [[turbofan]] engine's thrust). The stall warnings stopped, as all airspeed indications were now considered invalid by the aircraft's computer due to the high angle of attack.{{sfn|Palmer|2013|p=57|ps=: \"This created a situation where the air was pushing into, in addition to flowing over, the static ports. [...] This dynamic accounts for the repeated falling of the airspeed to invalid values.\"}} The aircraft had its nose above the horizon but was descending steeply.\n\nRoughly 20 seconds later, at 02:12 UTC, the pilot decreased the aircraft's [[pitch (aviation)|pitch]] slightly, airspeed indications became valid, and the stall warning sounded again; it then sounded intermittently for the remaining duration of the flight, but stopped when the pilot increased the aircraft's nose-up pitch. From there until the end of the flight, the angle of attack never dropped below 35 degrees. From the time the aircraft stalled until its impact with the ocean, the engines were primarily developing either 100 percent N<sub>1</sub> or TOGA thrust, though they were briefly spooled down to about 50 percent N<sub>1</sub> on two occasions. The engines always responded to commands and were developing in excess of 100 percent N<sub>1</sub> when the flight ended.  First officer Robert responded to Captain Dubois by saying: \"We've lost all control of the aeroplane, we don\u2019t understand anything, we\u2019ve tried everything\".<ref name=\"popularmechanics.com\"/> Soon after this, Robert said to himself, \"climb\" four times.

interim report stated that some new facts had been established.

This confirmed the findings of the preliminary reports and provided additional details and recommendations to improve safety. According to the final report,{{sfn|BEA final|2012}} the accident resulted from the following succession of major events:\n* temporary inconsistency between the measured speeds, likely as a result of the obstruction of the pitot tubes by ice crystals, causing autopilot disconnection and reconfiguration to [[alternate law#Alternate law|alternate law]];\n* the crew made inappropriate control inputs that destabilized the flight path;\n* the crew failed to follow appropriate procedure for loss of displayed airspeed information;\n* the crew were late in identifying and correcting the deviation from the flight path;\n* the crew lacked understanding of the approach to stall;\n* the crew failed to recognize the aircraft had stalled and consequently did not make inputs that would have made it possible to recover from the stall.{{sfn|BEA final|2012|p=200}}\n\nThese events resulted from the following major factors in combination:{{sfn|BEA final|2012}}\n* feedback mechanisms on the part of those involved made it impossible to identify and remedy the repeated non-application of the procedure for inconsistent airspeed, and to ensure that crews were trained in icing of the pitot probes and its consequences;\n* the crew lacked practical training in manually handling the aircraft both at high altitude and in the event of anomalies of speed indication;\n* the two co-pilots' task sharing was weakened both by incomprehension of the situation at the time of autopilot disconnection, and by poor management of the \"[[Startle response|startle effect]]\", leaving them in an emotionally charged situation;\n* the cockpit lacked a clear display of the inconsistencies in airspeed readings identified by the flight computers;\n* the crew did not respond to the stall warning, whether due to a failure to identify the aural warning, to the transience of the stall warnings that could have been considered spurious, to the absence of any visual information that could confirm that the aircraft was approaching stall after losing the characteristic speeds, to confusing stall-related [[Buffeting|buffet]] for overspeed-related buffet, to the indications by the Flight Director that might have confirmed the crew's mistaken view of their actions, or to difficulty in identifying and understanding the implications of the switch to alternate law, which does not protect the angle of attack.\n\n==Independent analyses==\nBefore and after the publication of the final report by the BEA in July 2012, there were many independent analyses and expert opinions published in the media about the cause of the accident.\n\n===Significance of the accident===\nIn May 2011, [[Wil S. Hylton]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' commented that the crash \"was easy to bend into myth\" because \"no other passenger jet in modern history had disappeared so completely\u2014without a Mayday call or a witness or even a trace on radar.\" Hylton explained that the A330 \"was considered to be among the safest\" of the passenger aircraft. Hylton added that when \"Flight 447 seemed to disappear from the sky, it was tempting to deliver a tidy narrative about the hubris of building a self-flying aircraft, Icarus falling from the sky.

The investigators also pointed to the lack of a clear display of the airspeed inconsistencies even though the computers had identified them. Some systems generated failure messages only about the consequences but never mentioned the origin of the problem. The investigators recommended a blocked pitot tube should be clearly indicated as such to the crew on the flight displays. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' pointed out the absence of angle of attack information, which is so important in identifying and preventing a stall.<ref name=Ross/> The paper stated that \"though angle of attack readings are sent to onboard computers, there are no displays in modern jets to convey this critical information to the crews\". ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' indicated the difficulty the pilots faced in diagnosing the problem: \"One alarm after another lit up the cockpit monitors.

The ''Spiegel'' report asserts that such a crash \"could happen again\".\n\nIn an article in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', [[William Langewiesche]] noted that once the angle of attack was so extreme, the system rejected the data as invalid and temporarily stopped the stall warnings. However, \"this led to a perverse reversal that lasted nearly to the impact: each time Bonin happened to lower the nose, rendering the angle of attack marginally less severe, the stall warning sounded again\u2014a negative reinforcement that may have locked him into his pattern of pitching up\", which increased the angle of attack and thus aggravated the stall.<ref name=VF201410>{{cite news |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/business/2014/10/air-france-flight-447-crash |newspaper=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |title=The Human Factor |first1=William |last1=Langewiesche |first2=Sean.
