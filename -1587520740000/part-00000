Green sulfur bacteria use [[sulfide]] ions, [[hydrogen]] or [[ferrous iron]] as [[electron donor]]s and the process is mediated by the Type I [[reaction centre]] and [[Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex]].  Reaction centre contains bacteriochlorophylls, P840, which donates electrons to [[cytochrome]] c-551 when it is excited by light.  Cytochrome c-551 then passes the electrons down the electron chain.  P840 is returned to its reduced state by the oxidation of sulfide.  Sulfide donates two electrons to yield elemental sulfur.  Elemental sulfur is deposited in globules on the extracellular side of the outer membrane.  When sulfide is depleted, the sulfur globules are consumed and oxidized to sulfate.  However, the pathway of sulfur oxidation is not well-understood.<ref name=pmid20143161/>\n\n===Anabolism===\nThese autotrophs fix carbon dioxide using the reverse tricarboxylic acid (RTCA) cycle.  Energy is consumed to incorporate carbon dioxide in order to assimilate [[pyruvate]] and [[acetate]] and generate [[macromolecule]]s.  ''Chlorobium tepidum'', a member of green sulfur bacteria was found to be mixotroph due to its ability to use inorganic and organic carbon sources.  They can assimilate acetate through the oxidative (forward) TCA (OTCA) cycle in addition to RTCA.  In contrast to the RTCA cycle, energy is generated in the OTCA cycle, which may contribute to better growth.  However, the capacity of the OTCA cycle is limited because gene that code for enzymes of the OTCA cycle are down-regulated when the bacteria is growing phototrophically.<ref name=pmid20650900/>\n\n==Habitat==\nThe Black Sea, an extremely anoxic environment, was found to house a large population of green sulfur bacteria at about 100 m depth.  Due to the lack of light available in this region of the sea, most bacteria were photosynthetically inactive.  The photosynthetic activity detected in the sulfide [[chemocline]] suggests that the bacteria need very little energy for cellular maintenance.<ref name=pmid20236170/>\n\nA species of green sulfur bacteria has been found living near a [[black smoker]] off the coast of [[Mexico]] at a depth of 2,500 m in the [[Pacific Ocean]].  At this depth, the bacterium, designated GSB1, lives off the dim glow of the thermal vent since no sunlight can penetrate to that depth.<ref name=pmid15967984>{{cite journal | vauthors = Beatty JT, Overmann J, Lince MT, Manske AK, Lang AS, Blankenship RE, Van Dover CL, Martinson TA, Plumley FG | title = An obligately photosynthetic bacterial anaerobe from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 | issue = 26 | pages = 9306\u201310 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15967984 | pmc = 1166624 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0503674102 | bibcode = 2005PNAS..102.9306B }}</ref>\n\n==Phylogeny==\nThe currently accepted phylogeny is based on 16S rRNA-based LTP release 123 by [[The All-Species Living Tree Project]].<ref>See the [[All-Species Living Tree Project]] [http://www.arb-silva.de/projects/living-tree].

Green sulfur bacteria use [[sulfide]] ions, [[hydrogen]] or [[ferrous iron]] as [[electron donor]]s and the process is mediated by the Type I [[reaction centre]] and [[Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex]].  Reaction centre contains bacteriochlorophylls, P840, which donates electrons to [[cytochrome]] c-551 when it is excited by light.  Cytochrome c-551 then passes the electrons down the electron chain.  P840 is returned to its reduced state by the oxidation of sulfide.  Sulfide donates two electrons to yield elemental sulfur.  Elemental sulfur is deposited in globules on the extracellular side of the outer membrane.  When sulfide is depleted, the sulfur globules are consumed and oxidized to sulfate.  However, the pathway of sulfur oxidation is not well-understood.<ref name=pmid20143161/>\n\n===Anabolism===\nThese autotrophs fix carbon dioxide using the reverse tricarboxylic acid (RTCA) cycle.  Energy is consumed to incorporate carbon dioxide in order to assimilate [[pyruvate]] and [[acetate]] and generate [[macromolecule]]s.  ''Chlorobium tepidum'', a member of green sulfur bacteria was found to be mixotroph due to its ability to use inorganic and organic carbon sources.  They can assimilate acetate through the oxidative (forward) TCA (OTCA) cycle in addition to RTCA.  In contrast to the RTCA cycle, energy is generated in the OTCA cycle, which may contribute to better growth.  However, the capacity of the OTCA cycle is limited because gene that code for enzymes of the OTCA cycle are down-regulated when the bacteria is growing phototrophically.<ref name=pmid20650900/>\n\n==Habitat==\nThe Black Sea, an extremely anoxic environment, was found to house a large population of green sulfur bacteria at about 100 m depth.  Due to the lack of light available in this region of the sea, most bacteria were photosynthetically inactive.  The photosynthetic activity detected in the sulfide [[chemocline]] suggests that the bacteria need very little energy for cellular maintenance.<ref name=pmid20236170/>\n\nA species of green sulfur bacteria has been found living near a [[black smoker]] off the coast of [[Mexico]] at a depth of 2,500 m in the [[Pacific Ocean]].  At this depth, the bacterium, designated GSB1, lives off the dim glow of the thermal vent since no sunlight can penetrate to that depth.<ref name=pmid15967984>{{cite journal | vauthors = Beatty JT, Overmann J, Lince MT, Manske AK, Lang AS, Blankenship RE, Van Dover CL, Martinson TA, Plumley FG | title = An obligately photosynthetic bacterial anaerobe from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 | issue = 26 | pages = 9306\u201310 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15967984 | pmc = 1166624 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0503674102 | bibcode = 2005PNAS..102.9306B }}</ref>\n\n==Phylogeny==\nThe currently accepted phylogeny is based on 16S rRNA-based LTP release 123 by [[The All-Species Living Tree Project]].<ref>See the [[All-Species Living Tree Project]] [http://www.arb-silva.de/projects/living-tree].

He also served on the board of trustees for the [[American Church Institute for Negroes]], [[Hampton University]] in [[Virginia]], [[Tuskegee University]] in [[Alabama]], the [[University of Georgia]], and the [[Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute]].\n\n==Political activities==\nFrom early in his life Peabody was interested in Democratic Party politics. In the early 1880s, he helped his close friend [[Edward M. Shepard]] organize the Young Men's Democratic Club of Brooklyn, took a part in the 1892 presidential campaign on behalf of [[Grover Cleveland]], supported the [[Gold Democrats]] against [[William Jennings Bryan]] in 1896, then switched to more moderate monetary reform as a member of the executive committee of the [[Indianapolis Monetary Convention]] in 1897. In 1904 and 1905 he served as treasurer of the [[Democratic National Committee]]. Although he declined to run for political office, and declined President Wilson's offer of a place on the [[Federal Trade Commission]], Peabody was an unofficial counselor to many government officials. From 1914 to 1921 he served on the board of directors of the [[Federal Reserve Bank]] in New York. In June 1932 [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], then [[Governor of New York]], visited Peabody for advice and support in deciding to run for [[President of the United States]].\n\n==Philanthropic activities==\nPeabody served from 1884 to 1930 as a trustee of [[Hampton University]], one of Virginia's historically black universities, where he established in the university library the Peabody Collection of rare materials on African-American history, one of the largest collections in the United States.<ref name=Zaki|2006>{{cite book|last1=Zaki|first1=Hoda M.|title=Civil Rights and Politics at Hampton Institute: The Legacy of Alonzo G.

In 1924 he invited his friend [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] (who had recently contracted a [[Franklin D. Roosevelt's paralytic illness|paralytic illness]]) to visit the 90 degree Fahrenheit springs there, which Roosevelt eventually purchased and turned into the [[Little White House]] and the [[Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation]], expanding it from a limited rehab center into a full-service center.\n\n==Honorary degrees==\nWhile his formal education was limited and he had no college degree, Peabody received honorary degrees from [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[Washington and Lee University|Washington and Lee]] Universities in 1903, and the [[University of Georgia]] in 1906.

George Henry Peabody, who came from a line of merchants, bankers and professional men, had moved from Connecticut to [[Columbus, Georgia]], where he ran a prosperous general store. After attending private school in Columbus, young Peabody spent a few months at [[Deer Hill Institute]] in [[Danbury, Connecticut]]. The Civil War, however, impoverished his family, and in 1866 they moved to [[Brooklyn]], New York, and young Peabody went to work as an errand boy.<ref name=Washington>{{cite book|last1=Washington|first1=Booker T.|editor1-last=Kaufman|editor1-first=Stuart|editor2-last=Smock|editor2-first=Raymond W.|editor3-last=Harlan|editor3-first=Louis R.|title=The Booker T.

On May 2, 1881, Peabody became a partner in the new firm of Spencer Trask & Company. During the 1880s and 1890s this investment house took a leading part in financing electric lighting corporations, sugar beet and other industrial enterprises, and railroad construction in the western United States and Mexico. Peabody himself handled most of the firm's railroad investments, working in close association with [[William J. Palmer]]. He also became a director in numerous corporations.  Peabody, his brother Charles Jones Peabody and Spencer Trask amassed a great portion of their wealth from the Edison Electric Company.  Trask served as president of Edison Electric Illuminating, and when [[J. P. Morgan]]\u2014prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of New England businessman/philanthropist [[George Peabody]]\u2014financier of Edison Electric, merged all into the [[General Electric|General Electric Company]] in 1892, George Foster Peabody became a member of the GE board of directors. Peabody had investments in Mexico, particularly in railways, along with many other U.S. financiers in the late nineteenth century. He was director of the Mexican National Railroad; and had holdings in Yucatan, where he was involved in commercial henequen exports, a natural twine used for binding wheat; was a director of the Intercontinental Rubber Company, founded by [[Bernard Baruch]]; and  provided capital for mining enterprises.<ref>Hart, John Mason.

The library was housed first on the second floor of the old City Hall on 8th Street, later moved to the second floor of the Model Drug Store, also on 8th Street, and in 1911 finally moved to the new City Hall on 12th Street, where it remained until 1960, when the city built the Herrick Public Library.<ref name=\"VanderKooy\">Vander Kooy, Mary. \"History of the Herrick Public Library: 1958-1990.\" April 1991.</ref>\n\nIn 1953, Hazel Hayes, Holland's first professional librarian, was hired.  Recognizing the city's need for funding for a new library, she wrote a letter to Ray Herrick, the owner of [[Tecumseh Products]] and originally from the Holland area, asking if he was interested in helping the library obtain a new building.  Months later, he anonymously donated $300,000 to build a public library for the city of Holland.  Following his gift, other groups donated funds, and in 1960, the newly built Herrick Public Library opened its doors on River Ave. between 12th and 13th Streets.  Holland's [[mayor]] at the time, Robert Visscher, rejoiced at the opening of the new library, saying, \"Never in the history of the community has anything so wonderful happened to the city of Holland\u2026There is nothing we need as much as a new library.\"<ref name=\"VanderKooy\" /><ref>\"City Given $300,000 for Library\", The Holland Evening Sentinel, 24 July 1958.</ref>\n\nIn 1971, in order to expand its service area, Herrick District Library joined the Lakeland Library Federation, which became the Lakeland Library Cooperative in 1977, allowing library patrons access to a larger collection.<ref name=\"VanderKooy\" />\n\nSince its opening in 1960, the Herrick Library's service area has grown from 25,000 to over 102,000 people, and this would not be possible if not for the 1999 library expansion. Prior to the renovation, Herrick Library faced numerous space challenges and could not adequately serve its patrons. Library consultant Anders Dahlgren reported that Herrick was 42 percent lower than the national average in terms of the number of volumes held and that 60 percent more space was needed just to house the number of collections at that time.\n\nSpatially, the library was insufficient. Staff members were overcrowded in offices, auditorium space was insufficient, programming and event space was limited and there were no conference rooms at all. In addition, Herrick was forced to remove many videos, books, art and reference materials to make room for newer materials, most patrons waited in check out lines for 10 minutes or more, and the number of patrons in the library eliminated the library's ability to offer a quiet reading environment.\n\nThe expansion came after a long-awaited [[Property tax|millage]] referendum and the switch from Herrick's status as a public library to a district library. The switch meant that the control of the library shifted from the City of Holland to an area wide board, allowing for a more reasonable form of funding. In December 1996, the District Library Planning Committee endorsed a \"resolution of intent\" to fund a library district which was unanimously supported. Then in 1997, focus was placed on receiving a millage referendum that sought $11.5 million in funding. On May 6, 1997, the City of Holland as well as surrounding Townships voted to approve 1.5 mills for a period of 20 years to support the establishment and operation of the Herrick District Library.\n\nThe renovation began on January 4, 1998 and took 18 months with the reopening occurring on June 11, 1999. The new building has been increased in size by {{convert|48144|sqft|m2}}, or 200 percent over the original building, leaving a total square footage of 72,291, and was designed by Frye, Fillan & Molinaro Architects Ltd.\n\nIn addition to the new Herrick District Library, the North Side Branch, located on Riley St., was completed in early 2000, giving Herrick an additional {{convert|5200|sqft|m2}}.\n\nIn 2016, voters overwhelmingly approved a renewal of the library's operating millage.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hollandsentinel.com/news/20160802/update-herrick-district-library-tax-overwhelmingly-passes|title=UPDATE: Herrick District Library tax overwhelmingly passes|last=Biolchini|first=Amy.|work=Holland Sentinel|access-date=2018-01-04|language=en}}</ref> The millage will allow for many improvements, including expansion at the North Branch and additional hours at each location.

The library was housed first on the second floor of the old City Hall on 8th Street, later moved to the second floor of the Model Drug Store, also on 8th Street, and in 1911 finally moved to the new City Hall on 12th Street, where it remained until 1960, when the city built the Herrick Public Library.<ref name=\"VanderKooy\">Vander Kooy, Mary. \"History of the Herrick Public Library: 1958-1990.\" April 1991.</ref>\n\nIn 1953, Hazel Hayes, Holland's first professional librarian, was hired.  Recognizing the city's need for funding for a new library, she wrote a letter to Ray Herrick, the owner of [[Tecumseh Products]] and originally from the Holland area, asking if he was interested in helping the library obtain a new building.  Months later, he anonymously donated $300,000 to build a public library for the city of Holland.  Following his gift, other groups donated funds, and in 1960, the newly built Herrick Public Library opened its doors on River Ave. between 12th and 13th Streets.  Holland's [[mayor]] at the time, Robert Visscher, rejoiced at the opening of the new library, saying, \"Never in the history of the community has anything so wonderful happened to the city of Holland\u2026There is nothing we need as much as a new library.\"<ref name=\"VanderKooy\" /><ref>\"City Given $300,000 for Library\", The Holland Evening Sentinel, 24 July 1958.</ref>\n\nIn 1971, in order to expand its service area, Herrick District Library joined the Lakeland Library Federation, which became the Lakeland Library Cooperative in 1977, allowing library patrons access to a larger collection.<ref name=\"VanderKooy\" />\n\nSince its opening in 1960, the Herrick Library's service area has grown from 25,000 to over 102,000 people, and this would not be possible if not for the 1999 library expansion. Prior to the renovation, Herrick Library faced numerous space challenges and could not adequately serve its patrons. Library consultant Anders Dahlgren reported that Herrick was 42 percent lower than the national average in terms of the number of volumes held and that 60 percent more space was needed just to house the number of collections at that time.\n\nSpatially, the library was insufficient. Staff members were overcrowded in offices, auditorium space was insufficient, programming and event space was limited and there were no conference rooms at all. In addition, Herrick was forced to remove many videos, books, art and reference materials to make room for newer materials, most patrons waited in check out lines for 10 minutes or more, and the number of patrons in the library eliminated the library's ability to offer a quiet reading environment.\n\nThe expansion came after a long-awaited [[Property tax|millage]] referendum and the switch from Herrick's status as a public library to a district library. The switch meant that the control of the library shifted from the City of Holland to an area wide board, allowing for a more reasonable form of funding. In December 1996, the District Library Planning Committee endorsed a \"resolution of intent\" to fund a library district which was unanimously supported. Then in 1997, focus was placed on receiving a millage referendum that sought $11.5 million in funding. On May 6, 1997, the City of Holland as well as surrounding Townships voted to approve 1.5 mills for a period of 20 years to support the establishment and operation of the Herrick District Library.\n\nThe renovation began on January 4, 1998 and took 18 months with the reopening occurring on June 11, 1999. The new building has been increased in size by {{convert|48144|sqft|m2}}, or 200 percent over the original building, leaving a total square footage of 72,291, and was designed by Frye, Fillan & Molinaro Architects Ltd.\n\nIn addition to the new Herrick District Library, the North Side Branch, located on Riley St., was completed in early 2000, giving Herrick an additional {{convert|5200|sqft|m2}}.\n\nIn 2016, voters overwhelmingly approved a renewal of the library's operating millage.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hollandsentinel.com/news/20160802/update-herrick-district-library-tax-overwhelmingly-passes|title=UPDATE: Herrick District Library tax overwhelmingly passes|last=Biolchini|first=Amy.|work=Holland Sentinel|access-date=2018-01-04|language=en}}</ref> The millage will allow for many improvements, including expansion at the North Branch and additional hours at each location.

The fire was deemed suspicious due to the fact that some of the wicker furniture from inside the library had been piled up against the back porch door. Two weeks later the Hernando County  Sheriff's Office and the Florida Division of State Fire Marshal received a confession from a suspect who had been previously reported to be on the scene at the time of the fire. The suspect had made his presence known at the scene of the fire by claiming he was going to school to become a volunteer fire fighter and was there to assist with putting out the fire \u2013 he also arrived in a fire suit and an oxygen tank strapped to his back. The smoke and water damage from this incident has been estimated at $500,000. This estimation includes $250,000 in damages to the building and another $250,000 to the books. Eighteen thousand books were damaged by either smoke or water during the incident.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://hernandotoday.com/he/list/news/suspect-admits-he-started-hernando-library-fire-20130723/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-04-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407075624/http://hernandotoday.com/he/list/news/suspect-admits-he-started-hernando-library-fire-20130723/ |archive-date=2014-04-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The suspect accepted a plea deal with the following terms: 8 years in prison, pay back roughly $590,000 to Travelers Insurance and $25,000 to Hernando County.<ref>http://www.tampabay.com/news/courts/criminal/teen-sentenced-to-eight-years-in-prison-for-setting-east-hernando-library/2169093</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\n\n* Florida Library of the Year Award for 2013 <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.flalib.org/awards_documents/2013_award_winners_for_web.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-04-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407100437/http://www.flalib.org/awards_documents/2013_award_winners_for_web.pdf |archive-date=2014-04-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.hcpl.lib.fl.us/ Hernando County Public Library. 2012]\n* [http://florida.educationbug.org/public-library/2882-hernando-county-library-system.html Education Bug. 2013]\n* [http://www.hcplgenealogy.blogspot.com/2012_02_01_archive.html Hernando County Library Genealogy Blog]\t\n* [http://www.hcpl.lib.fl.us/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=118&Itemid=111 Library Link] - HCPL newsletter\n\n{{coord missing|Florida}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:County library systems in Florida|Hernando]]\n[[Category:Education in Hernando County, Florida|Library]]\n[[Category:Public libraries in Florida]]\n", "text_old": "'''Hernando County Public Library''' is  located in [[Hernando County]], [[Florida State League|Florida]], which is about an hour north of [[Tampa]].

The fire was deemed suspicious due to the fact that some of the wicker furniture from inside the library had been piled up against the back porch door. Two weeks later the Hernando County  Sheriff's Office and the Florida Division of State Fire Marshal received a confession from a suspect who had been previously reported to be on the scene at the time of the fire. The suspect had made his presence known at the scene of the fire by claiming he was going to school to become a volunteer fire fighter and was there to assist with putting out the fire \u2013 he also arrived in a fire suit and an oxygen tank strapped to his back. The smoke and water damage from this incident has been estimated at $500,000. This estimation includes $250,000 in damages to the building and another $250,000 to the books. Eighteen thousand books were damaged by either smoke or water during the incident.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://hernandotoday.com/he/list/news/suspect-admits-he-started-hernando-library-fire-20130723/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-04-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407075624/http://hernandotoday.com/he/list/news/suspect-admits-he-started-hernando-library-fire-20130723/ |archive-date=2014-04-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The suspect accepted a plea deal with the following terms: 8 years in prison, pay back roughly $590,000 to Travelers Insurance and $25,000 to Hernando County. <ref>http://www.tampabay.com/news/courts/criminal/teen-sentenced-to-eight-years-in-prison-for-setting-east-hernando-library/2169093</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\n\n* Florida Library of the Year Award for 2013 <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.flalib.org/awards_documents/2013_award_winners_for_web.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-04-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407100437/http://www.flalib.org/awards_documents/2013_award_winners_for_web.pdf |archive-date=2014-04-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n* [http://www.hcpl.lib.fl.us/ Hernando County Public Library. 2012]\n* [http://florida.educationbug.org/public-library/2882-hernando-county-library-system.html Education Bug. 2013]\n* [http://www.hcplgenealogy.blogspot.com/2012_02_01_archive.html Hernando County Library Genealogy Blog]\t\n* [http://www.hcpl.lib.fl.us/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=118&Itemid=111 Library Link] - HCPL newsletter\n\n{{coord missing|Florida}}\n\n[[Category:County library systems in Florida|Hernando]]\n[[Category:Education in Hernando County, Florida|Library]]\n[[Category:Public libraries in Florida]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernando_County_Library_System"}
