It was first broadcast on [[SoHo (Australian TV channel)|SoHo]] on 1 May 2013. The series serves as a contemporary reimagining of ''[[Prisoner (TV series)|Prisoner]]'', which ran on [[Network Ten]] from 1979 to 1986. Lara Radulovich and David Hannam developed ''Wentworth'' from [[Reg Watson]]'s original concept. The series is set in the modern day and initially focuses on Bea Smith's ([[Danielle Cormack]]) early days in prison and her subsequent rise to the top of the prison's hierarchy. From the fifth season onward, the series shifted to emphasize more of an [[ensemble cast|ensemble]] format. \n\nFor the first three seasons, ''Wentworth'' was filmed on purpose-built sets in the suburbs of [[Clayton, Victoria]]. Starting with the fourth season, production moved to [[Newport, Victoria]]. The show has received a mostly positive reception from critics, and the first episode became the most watched Australian drama series premiere in [[Foxtel]] history. The series was picked up by several countries, including New Zealand and the UK, where it has been retitled '''''Wentworth Prison'''''.\n\nAn eighth and ninth season have been commissioned, set to be broadcast through 2020 and 2021 respectively with ten episodes each, with the ninth serving as the final season to the series.<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n==Premise==\n{{further|List of Wentworth episodes}}\n''Wentworth'' is set in modern-day Australia.

It was first broadcast on [[SoHo (Australian TV channel)|SoHo]] on 1 May 2013. The series serves as a contemporary reimagining of ''[[Prisoner (TV series)|Prisoner]]'', which ran on [[Network Ten]] from 1979 to 1986. Lara Radulovich and David Hannam developed ''Wentworth'' from [[Reg Watson]]'s original concept. The series is set in the modern day and initially focuses on Bea Smith's ([[Danielle Cormack]]) early days in prison and her subsequent rise to the top of the prison's hierarchy. From the fifth season onward, the series shifted to emphasize more of an [[ensemble cast|ensemble]] format. \n\nFor the first three seasons, ''Wentworth'' was filmed on purpose-built sets in the suburbs of [[Clayton, Victoria]]. Starting with the fourth season, production moved to [[Newport, Victoria]]. The show has received a mostly positive reception from critics, and the first episode became the most watched Australian drama series premiere in [[Foxtel]] history.

The country has two main landmasses\u2014the [[North Island]] (''Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui''), and the [[South Island]] (''Te Waipounamu'')\u2014and around 600 [[List of islands of New Zealand|smaller islands]]. It has a total land area of {{convert|268000|km2|-2}}. New Zealand is about {{convert|2000|km|-2}} east of [[Australia]] across the [[Tasman Sea]] and {{convert|1000|km|-2}} south of the [[List of islands in the Pacific Ocean|Pacific island areas]] of [[New Caledonia]], [[Fiji]], and [[Tonga]]. Because of its remoteness, it was the last large habitable land to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct [[Biodiversity of New Zealand|biodiversity]] of animal, fungal, and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the [[Southern Alps]], owe much to the [[tectonic uplift]] of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's [[Capital of New Zealand|capital city]] is [[Wellington]], and its most populous city is [[Auckland]].\n\nBetween about 1280 and 1350, [[Polynesians]] began to settle in the islands and developed a distinctive [[M\u0101ori culture]]. In 1642, Dutch explorer [[Abel Tasman]] became the first European to sight New Zealand. In 1840, representatives of the United Kingdom and [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] chiefs signed the [[Treaty of Waitangi]], which declared British sovereignty over the islands. In 1841, New Zealand [[Colony of New Zealand|became a colony]] within the [[British Empire]] and in 1907 it [[Dominion of New Zealand|became a dominion]]; it gained [[Independence of New Zealand|full statutory independence]] in 1947 and the British monarch remained the [[head of state]]. Today, the majority of [[New Zealand's population]] of 4.9&nbsp;million is of [[European New Zealanders|European descent]]; the indigenous M\u0101ori are the largest minority, followed by [[Asian New Zealanders|Asians]] and [[Pacific Islander]]s. Reflecting this, [[New Zealand's culture]] is mainly derived from M\u0101ori and early British settlers, with recent broadening arising from increased [[Immigration to New Zealand|immigration]]. The [[Languages of New Zealand|official languages]] are [[English language|English]], [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]], and [[New Zealand Sign Language]], with English being very dominant.\n\nA [[developed country]], New Zealand [[international rankings of New Zealand|ranks highly]] in international comparisons of national performance, such as quality of life, health, education, protection of [[civil liberties]], and [[economic freedom]]. New Zealand underwent [[Rogernomics|major economic changes]] during the 1980s, which transformed it from a [[protectionist]] to a [[economic liberalization|liberalised]] [[free-trade]] economy. The service sector dominates the [[Economy of New Zealand|national economy]], followed by the industrial sector, and [[Agriculture in New Zealand|agriculture]]; international [[tourism in New Zealand|tourism]] is a significant source of revenue. Nationally, legislative authority is vested in an elected, [[unicameral]] [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]], while executive political power is exercised by the [[Cabinet of New Zealand|Cabinet]], led by the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|prime minister]], currently [[Jacinda Ardern]]. [[Queen Elizabeth II]] is the [[monarchy of New Zealand|country's monarch]] and is represented by a [[Governor-General of New Zealand|governor-general]], currently [[Dame Patsy Reddy]]. In addition, New Zealand is organised into 11 [[Regions of New Zealand|regional councils]] and 67 [[Territorial authorities of New Zealand|territorial authorities]] for local government purposes. The [[Realm of New Zealand]] also includes [[Tokelau]] (a [[dependent territory]]); the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]] (self-governing states in [[Associated state|free association]] with New Zealand); and the [[Ross Dependency]], which is New Zealand's [[territorial claim in Antarctica]].\n\nNew Zealand is a member of the [[United Nations]], [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[ANZUS]], [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations#ASEAN Plus Three and Six|ASEAN Plus Six]], [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]], the [[Pacific Community]] and the [[Pacific Islands Forum]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==<!--linked-->\n{{See also|New Zealand place names}}\n\n[[File:Detail of 1657 map Polus Antarcticus by Jan Janssonius, showing Nova Zeelandia.png|thumb|left|Detail from a 1657 map showing the western coastline of \"Nova Zeelandia\".

The country has two main landmasses\u2014the [[North Island]] (''Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui''), and the [[South Island]] (''Te Waipounamu'')\u2014and around 600 [[List of islands of New Zealand|smaller islands]]. It has a total land area of {{convert|268000|km2|-2}}. New Zealand is about {{convert|2000|km|-2}} east of [[Australia]] across the [[Tasman Sea]] and {{convert|1000|km|-2}} south of the [[List of islands in the Pacific Ocean|Pacific island areas]] of [[New Caledonia]], [[Fiji]], and [[Tonga]]. Because of its remoteness, it was the last large habitable land to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct [[Biodiversity of New Zealand|biodiversity]] of animal, fungal, and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the [[Southern Alps]], owe much to the [[tectonic uplift]] of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's [[Capital of New Zealand|capital city]] is [[Wellington]], and its most populous city is [[Auckland]].\n\nBetween about 1280 and 1350, [[Polynesians]] began to settle in the islands and developed a distinctive [[M\u0101ori culture]]. In 1642, Dutch explorer [[Abel Tasman]] became the first European to sight New Zealand. In 1840, representatives of the United Kingdom and [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] chiefs signed the [[Treaty of Waitangi]], which declared British sovereignty over the islands. In 1841, New Zealand [[Colony of New Zealand|became a colony]] within the [[British Empire]] and in 1907 it [[Dominion of New Zealand|became a dominion]]; it gained [[Independence of New Zealand|full statutory independence]] in 1947 and the British monarch remained the [[head of state]]. Today, the majority of [[New Zealand's population]] of 4.9&nbsp;million is of [[European New Zealanders|European descent]]; the indigenous M\u0101ori are the largest minority, followed by [[Asian New Zealanders|Asians]] and [[Pacific Islander]]s. Reflecting this, [[New Zealand's culture]] is mainly derived from M\u0101ori and early British settlers, with recent broadening arising from increased [[Immigration to New Zealand|immigration]]. The [[Languages of New Zealand|official languages]] are [[English language|English]], [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]], and [[New Zealand Sign Language]], with English being very dominant.\n\nA [[developed country]], New Zealand [[international rankings of New Zealand|ranks highly]] in international comparisons of national performance, such as quality of life, health, education, protection of [[civil liberties]], and [[economic freedom]]. New Zealand underwent [[Rogernomics|major economic changes]] during the 1980s, which transformed it from a [[protectionist]] to a [[economic liberalization|liberalised]] [[free-trade]] economy. The service sector dominates the [[Economy of New Zealand|national economy]], followed by the industrial sector, and [[Agriculture in New Zealand|agriculture]]; international [[tourism in New Zealand|tourism]] is a significant source of revenue. Nationally, legislative authority is vested in an elected, [[unicameral]] [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]], while executive political power is exercised by the [[Cabinet of New Zealand|Cabinet]], led by the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|prime minister]], currently [[Jacinda Ardern]]. [[Queen Elizabeth II]] is the [[monarchy of New Zealand|country's monarch]] and is represented by a [[Governor-General of New Zealand|governor-general]], currently [[Dame Patsy Reddy]]. In addition, New Zealand is organised into 11 [[Regions of New Zealand|regional councils]] and 67 [[Territorial authorities of New Zealand|territorial authorities]] for local government purposes. The [[Realm of New Zealand]] also includes [[Tokelau]] (a [[dependent territory]]); the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]] (self-governing states in [[Associated state|free association]] with New Zealand); and the [[Ross Dependency]], which is New Zealand's [[territorial claim in Antarctica]].\n\nNew Zealand is a member of the [[United Nations]], [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[ANZUS]], [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations#ASEAN Plus Three and Six|ASEAN Plus Six]], [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]], the [[Pacific Community]] and the [[Pacific Islands Forum]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==<!--linked-->\n{{See also|New Zealand place names}}\n\n[[File:Detail of 1657 map Polus Antarcticus by Jan Janssonius, showing Nova Zeelandia.png|thumb|left|Detail from a 1657 map showing the western coastline of \"Nova Zeelandia\".
