The objective of four square is to eliminate other players to achieve the highest rank on the court, and this is done by bouncing the ball back and forth between quadrants.  A player is eliminated when a ball is bounced in a player's quadrant and the player is unable to touch the ball into another player's quadrant.  It is a popular game at elementary schools with little required equipment, almost no setup, and short rounds of play that can be ended at any time.  No player is permitted to enter another players square.  If done that will count as a fault (player gets eliminated).  Colin Murphy thinks otherwise.\n\n==Playing environment==\nFour square is played on any hard-surfaced court, such as [[wood]], concrete or [[asphalt]]. There is no official court size, but typically courts measure between 10 and 20&nbsp;feet on a side, and divided into four smaller equal-size squares. Each of the four squares has a rank and is occupied by a single player. The ranks may be arranged so that either the highest ranking square is positioned facing the lowest ranking square, or the ranks increase as one moves clockwise (or counterclockwise).\n\nThe lines on the court are boundaries. The interior lines separating player squares are [[out of bounds]]. The ball may not touch any portion of an inside line or the player who hit the ball is in error. The lines marking the outermost edges of the court are typically considered in-bounds.<ref name=\"squarefour\">[http://www.squarefour.org/rules Official Rules of Four Square]. Squarefour.org (2004-09-10). Retrieved on 2011-06-18.</ref> These boundary rules are often described as \"inside out, outside in.\" In recreational play, and even with a judge in tournament play, it is often difficult to determine if the ball hits the line.\n\n==Ball usage==\nFour square is played with a rubber playground ball, typically {{convert|8.5|in}} diameter, and inflated to {{convert|2|psi|abbr=on}}. However, other sizes and types of balls can be used.\n\nDuring regular play, or \"classic,\" the ball must be hit with the player's hands only.\n\nIn classic play, carrying, catching, or holding the ball during play is not allowed, although putting spin on the ball is allowed as long as carrying does not occur. Prolonged contact with the ball can give players unfair control over the play. Hitting the ball must create a perceptible change in the ball's velocity (speed or direction).<ref name=\"squarefour\"/>\n\n==Elimination==\nPlayers may be eliminated from the court because of errors or fouls they commit. Eliminated players leave the court, the remaining players move up to the next highest square, and a new player joins the court in the lowest square. Eliminated players wait in line for their next turn.\n\nThe following actions may result in elimination (although many variations exist):<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150223075148/http://squarefour.org/coolrules Monstrous Collection of Cool Rules]. Squarefour.org (2010-02-23). Retrieved on 2011-06-18.</ref>\n\n* Failing to hit the ball into another square\n* Hitting the ball out of turn\n* Hitting the ball with a prohibited body part\n* Hitting the ball out of bounds (or onto an internal boundary line)\n\n==Game scalability==\nFour square is a popular game for children and school playgrounds.

The objective of four square is to eliminate other players to achieve the highest rank on the court, and this is done by bouncing the ball back and forth between quadrants.  A player is eliminated when a ball is bounced in a player's quadrant and the player is unable to touch the ball into another player's quadrant.  It is a popular game at elementary schools with little required equipment, almost no setup, and short rounds of play that can be ended at any time.\n\n==Playing environment==\nFour square is played on any hard-surfaced court, such as [[wood]], concrete or [[asphalt]]. There is no official court size, but typically courts measure between 10 and 20&nbsp;feet on a side, and divided into four smaller equal-size squares. Each of the four squares has a rank and is occupied by a single player. The ranks may be arranged so that either the highest ranking square is positioned facing the lowest ranking square, or the ranks increase as one moves clockwise (or counterclockwise).\n\nThe lines on the court are boundaries. The interior lines separating player squares are [[out of bounds]]. The ball may not touch any portion of an inside line or the player who hit the ball is in error. The lines marking the outermost edges of the court are typically considered in-bounds.<ref name=\"squarefour\">[http://www.squarefour.org/rules Official Rules of Four Square]. Squarefour.org (2004-09-10). Retrieved on 2011-06-18.</ref> These boundary rules are often described as \"inside out, outside in.\" In recreational play, and even with a judge in tournament play, it is often difficult to determine if the ball hits the line.\n\n==Ball usage==\nFour square is played with a rubber playground ball, typically {{convert|8.5|in}} diameter, and inflated to {{convert|2|psi|abbr=on}}. However, other sizes and types of balls can be used.\n\nDuring regular play, or \"classic,\" the ball must be hit with the player's hands only.\n\nIn classic play, carrying, catching, or holding the ball during play is not allowed, although putting spin on the ball is allowed as long as carrying does not occur. Prolonged contact with the ball can give players unfair control over the play. Hitting the ball must create a perceptible change in the ball's velocity (speed or direction).<ref name=\"squarefour\"/>\n\n==Elimination==\nPlayers may be eliminated from the court because of errors or fouls they commit. Eliminated players leave the court, the remaining players move up to the next highest square, and a new player joins the court in the lowest square. Eliminated players wait in line for their next turn.\n\nThe following actions may result in elimination (although many variations exist):<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150223075148/http://squarefour.org/coolrules Monstrous Collection of Cool Rules].

It is possible to scale the game's difficulty and supervision appropriately for different age groups and ability levels. Schools, churches, and camps often change the size of the court, the type of ball, or aspects of the rules to create variation in play or to suit the players' abilities.\n\n==History==\nFour square dates back to at least the 1950s.

Please do not add more material to this summary; instead, adjust what is already here. -->\nOn the [[Polynesia]]n island of Motunui, the inhabitants worship the goddess Te Fiti, who brought life to the ocean using a [[pounamu]] stone as her heart and the source of her power. [[M\u0101ui (mythology)|Maui]], the shape-shifting demigod and master of sailing, steals the heart to give humanity the power of creation. However, Te Fiti disintegrates, and Maui is attacked by another who seeks the heart: Te K\u0101, a volcanic demon. Maui is blasted out of the sky, losing both his magical giant [[fishhook]] and the heart to the depths of the sea.\n\nA millennium later, the ocean chooses Moana, daughter of Motunui's chief Tui, to return the heart to Te Fiti. Tui takes Moana away, causing her to lose the heart. Tui and Sina, Moana's mother, try to keep her away from the ocean to prepare her for ascension as the island's chief. Sixteen years later, a [[blight]] strikes the island, killing vegetation and shrinking the fish catch. Moana suggests going beyond the island's reef to find more fish and figure out what is happening, but Tui forbids it. Moana tries conquering the reef but is overpowered by the tides and shipwrecked back to Motunui with Pua the pig.\n\nMoana's grandmother, Tala, shows her a secret cave of ships, revealing that their people were voyagers until Maui stole Te Fiti's heart; the ocean was no longer safe without it. Tala explains that Te K\u0101's darkness is poisoning the island, but can be cured if Moana finds Maui and makes him restore the heart of Te Fiti, which she gives to Moana. Tala falls ill and, on her death bed, tells Moana that she must depart to find Maui.\n\nSetting sail on a [[camakau]] from the cavern, Moana is caught in a typhoon and shipwrecked on an island where she finds Maui, who boasts about his achievements. She demands that Maui return the heart, but he refuses and traps her in a cave. She escapes and confronts Maui, who reluctantly lets her on the camakau. They are attacked by Kakamora\u2014small, coconut-armored pirates\u2014who seek the heart, but Moana and Maui outwit them. Moana realizes Maui is no longer a hero since he stole the heart and cursed the world, and convinces him to redeem himself by returning the heart. Maui first needs to retrieve his magical [[fishhook]] in Lalotai, the Realm of Monsters, from Tamatoa, a giant [[coconut crab]]. While Moana distracts Tamatoa, Maui retrieves his hook but discovers he can no longer control his shape-shifting. He is overpowered by Tamatoa, but Moana's quick thinking allows them to escape with the hook. Maui reveals that his first tattoo was earned when his mortal parents rejected him. After reassurance from Moana, Maui teaches her the art of sailing, regaining control of his powers, and the two grow closer.\n\nThey arrive at Te Fiti's island, only to be attacked by Te K\u0101. Moana refuses to turn back, resulting in Maui's hook being badly damaged. Unwilling to lose his hook in another confrontation with Te K\u0101, Maui abandons Moana, who tearfully asks the ocean to find someone else to restore the heart. The ocean obliges and takes the heart, but Tala's spirit appears, inspiring Moana to find her true calling. She retrieves the heart and sails back to confront Te K\u0101. Maui returns, having had a change of heart, and buys Moana time to reach Te Fiti by fighting Te K\u0101, destroying his hook in the process. Moana discovers Te Fiti is missing, and realizes Te K\u0101 is Te Fiti, corrupted without her heart. Moana tells the ocean to clear a path, allowing her to return Te Fiti's heart, and the restored goddess heals the ocean and islands of the blight. Maui apologizes to Te Fiti, who restores his hook and gives Moana a new boat before falling into a deep sleep and becoming a mountain.\n\nMoana bids farewell to Maui, returning home where she reunites with her parents. She takes up her role as chief and [[Polynesian navigation|wayfinder]], leading her people as they resume voyaging.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Auli'i Cravalho December 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] at the film's premiere in [[Samoa]] in December 2016]]\n* [[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] as Moana, the curious daughter of village chief Tui and his wife Sina, who is chosen by the ocean to restore the heart of Te Fiti\n** Cravalho reprised her role in the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian-language]] version of the movie.<ref name=\"instagram\">{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BbAOujigpkd/|title=Auli'i on Instagram: 'Aloha nui k\u0101kou!

animation|computer-animated]] [[Musical film|musical]] [[adventure film]] produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] and released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. It is the 56th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]]. Directed by [[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]], co-directed by [[Don Hall (filmmaker)|Don Hall]] and [[Chris Williams (director)|Chris Williams]], the film introduces [[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] as Moana and features the voices of [[Dwayne Johnson]], [[Rachel House (actress)|Rachel House]], [[Temuera Morrison]], [[Jemaine Clement]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Alan Tudyk]]. The film features songs written by [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]], [[Te Vaka|Opetaia Foa'i]] and [[Mark Mancina]], and an orchestral score also composed by Mancina.\n\nThe film tells the story of [[Moana (Disney character)|Moana]], the strong-willed daughter of a chief of a [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] village, who is chosen by the ocean itself to reunite a mystical relic with the goddess Te Fiti. When a [[blight]] strikes her island, Moana sets sail in search of [[M\u0101ui (mythology)|Maui]], a legendary [[demigod]], in the hope of returning the relic to Te Fiti and saving her people.\n\n''Moana'' was released theatrically in the United States on November 23, 2016 to positive reviews from critics, with particular praise going towards its animation, music, and vocal performances. The film went on to gross over $690&nbsp;million worldwide. Along with ''[[Zootopia]]'', it marked the first time since 2002 that Walt Disney Animation Studios released two feature films in the same year. It received two [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations at the [[89th Academy Awards]]: one for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]] and another for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] (\"[[How Far I'll Go]]\").<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/2017-oscar-nominations-academy-awards-nominees-1201968107/|title=Oscar Nominations: Complete List|date=January 24, 2017|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Variety Media|location=Los Angeles|accessdate=January 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plots should be between 400 and 700 words. Please do not add more material to this summary; instead, adjust what is already here. -->\nOn the [[Polynesia]]n island of Motunui, the inhabitants worship the goddess Te Fiti, who brought life to the ocean using a [[pounamu]] stone as her heart and the source of her power. [[M\u0101ui (mythology)|Maui]], the shape-shifting demigod and master of sailing, steals the heart to give humanity the power of creation. However, Te Fiti disintegrates, and Maui is attacked by another who seeks the heart: Te K\u0101, a volcanic demon. Maui is blasted out of the sky, losing both his magical giant [[fishhook]] and the heart to the depths of the sea.\n\nA millennium later, the ocean chooses Moana, daughter of Motunui's chief Tui, to return the heart to Te Fiti. Tui takes Moana away, causing her to lose the heart. Tui and Sina, Moana's mother, try to keep her away from the ocean to prepare her for ascension as the island's chief. Sixteen years later, a [[blight]] strikes the island, killing vegetation and shrinking the fish catch. Moana suggests going beyond the island's reef to find more fish and figure out what is happening, but Tui forbids it. Moana tries conquering the reef but is overpowered by the tides and shipwrecked back to Motunui with Pua the pig.\n\nMoana's grandmother, Tala, shows her a secret cave of ships, revealing that their people were voyagers until Maui stole Te Fiti's heart; the ocean was no longer safe without it. Tala explains that Te K\u0101's darkness is poisoning the island, but can be cured if Moana finds Maui and makes him restore the heart of Te Fiti, which she gives to Moana. Tala falls ill and, on her death bed, tells Moana that she must depart to find Maui.\n\nSetting sail on a [[camakau]] from the cavern, Moana is caught in a typhoon and shipwrecked on an island where she finds Maui, who boasts about his achievements. She demands that Maui return the heart, but he refuses and traps her in a cave. She escapes and confronts Maui, who reluctantly lets her on the camakau. They are attacked by Kakamora\u2014small, coconut-armored pirates\u2014who seek the heart, but Moana and Maui outwit them. Moana realizes Maui is no longer a hero since he stole the heart and cursed the world, and convinces him to redeem himself by returning the heart. Maui first needs to retrieve his magical [[fishhook]] in Lalotai, the Realm of Monsters, from Tamatoa, a giant [[coconut crab]]. While Moana distracts Tamatoa, Maui retrieves his hook but discovers he can no longer control his shape-shifting. He is overpowered by Tamatoa, but Moana's quick thinking allows them to escape with the hook. Maui reveals that his first tattoo was earned when his mortal parents rejected him. After reassurance from Moana, Maui teaches her the art of sailing, regaining control of his powers, and the two grow closer.\n\nThey arrive at Te Fiti's island, only to be attacked by Te K\u0101. Moana refuses to turn back, resulting in Maui's hook being badly damaged. Unwilling to lose his hook in another confrontation with Te K\u0101, Maui abandons Moana, who tearfully asks the ocean to find someone else to restore the heart. The ocean obliges and takes the heart, but Tala's spirit appears, inspiring Moana to find her true calling. She retrieves the heart and sails back to confront Te K\u0101. Maui returns, having had a change of heart, and buys Moana time to reach Te Fiti by fighting Te K\u0101, destroying his hook in the process. Moana discovers Te Fiti is missing, and realizes Te K\u0101 is Te Fiti, corrupted without her heart. Moana tells the ocean to clear a path, allowing her to return Te Fiti's heart, and the restored goddess heals the ocean and islands of the blight. Maui apologizes to Te Fiti, who restores his hook and gives Moana a new boat before falling into a deep sleep and becoming a mountain.\n\nMoana bids farewell to Maui, returning home where she reunites with her parents. She takes up her role as chief and [[Polynesian navigation|wayfinder]], leading her people as they resume voyaging.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Auli'i Cravalho December 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] at the film's premiere in [[Samoa]] in December 2016]]\n* [[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] as Moana, the curious daughter of village chief Tui and his wife Sina, who is chosen by the ocean to restore the heart of Te Fiti\n** Cravalho reprised her role in the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian-language]] version of the movie.<ref name=\"instagram\">{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BbAOujigpkd/|title=Auli'i on Instagram: 'Aloha nui k\u0101kou!

The game was played on January 29, 1995 at [[Hard Rock Stadium|Joe Robbie Stadium]] in [[Miami|Miami, Florida]] (now part of the suburb of [[Miami Gardens, Florida|Miami Gardens]], which became a separate city in 2003).\n\nThis game is regarded as 49ers quarterback [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]]'s final leap out of the shadow of his predecessor, [[Joe Montana]], who had won four Super Bowls with the 49ers (in [[Super Bowl XVI|1981]], [[Super Bowl XIX|1984]], [[Super Bowl XXIII|1988]], and [[Super Bowl XXIV|1989]]), two with Young as the backup quarterback. With Young at the helm, and a defense consisting of several veteran [[free agent]]s who joined the team during the previous offseason, San Francisco finished the regular season with a league-best 13\u20133 record, and led the league in total points scored (505). The Chargers, on the other hand, were regarded as a [[Cinderella (sports)|\"Cinderella\" team]], and advanced to their first Super Bowl after posting an 11\u20135 regular-season record and overcoming halftime deficits in both of their playoff wins.\n\nThis was the first Super Bowl in which both teams scored in all four quarters. The combined aggregate score of 75 points and the ten total [[touchdown]]s both remain Super Bowl records. Still, the 49ers controlled most of the game, with Young completing touchdown passes in each of the 49ers' first two drives. The Chargers were able to cut the deficit late in the first quarter, 14\u20137, on a 13-play, 78-yard drive, but could not slow down San Francisco afterwards. Young was named the [[Super Bowl MVP]], throwing a Super Bowl-record six touchdown passes, and completing 24 out of 36 passes for 325 yards.\n\nDespite the predicted blowout (18\u00bd points is the largest margin a team has been favored by in a Super Bowl), the fact that San Diego did not have as much national appeal nor a relatively large core fan base, and two teams from [[California]] playing, which could have significantly diminished interest along the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], the telecast of the game on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] still had a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 41.3.<ref name=\"TVRatings\"/>\n\n==Background==\nNFL owners voted to award Super Bowl XXIX to Miami, Florida during a meeting on May 23, 1991. This was the seventh time that Miami hosted the game.\n\n===San Diego Chargers===\n{{main|1994 San Diego Chargers season}}\n\nThe Chargers were the biggest surprise of the 1994 season, with very few expecting them to even reach the playoffs, let alone the Super Bowl.\n\nSan Diego suffered losing seasons in the 1980s until former [[Washington Redskins]] general manager [[Bobby Beathard]] joined the team in 1990. Beathard decided to rebuild the Chargers using the same model that he used to build the Redskins into Super Bowl contenders during the 1980s \u2013 a powerful running game built around big linemen, a passing game that helped sustain extremely long drives, and a bending but steady defense. After former [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] head coach [[Bobby Ross]] was hired by the [[1992 San Diego Chargers season|Chargers in 1992]], the team won the [[AFC West]] with an 11\u20135 regular season record and won an opening round playoff game against Kansas City. But [[1993 San Diego Chargers season|in 1993]], they slumped back to 8\u20138 and did not reach the postseason.\n\nBefore the start of the 1994 season, San Diego was not expected to do well because they had so many newcomers via the draft and free agency; the Chargers ended up with 22 new players on their roster, and 10 of them became starters. However, they ended up winning their first six regular season games en route to an 11\u20135 record, the AFC West championship, and the #2 AFC playoff [[Single-elimination tournament#Seeding|seed]]. The Chargers went into the final game of the season against the Pittsburgh Steelers needing a win to get the #2 seed (a loss would have given that spot to the Miami Dolphins), which came with a first-round bye and a home game in the divisional round of the playoffs. Backup quarterback [[Gale Gilbert]], subbing for injured starter [[Stan Humphries]], led the Chargers to a come-from-behind 37\u201334 win, with [[John Carney (American football)|John Carney]] kicking a game-winning field goal in the game's final seconds.\n\nThe Chargers' offense was led by quarterback [[Stan Humphries]], who was the Redskins' backup to [[Mark Rypien]] during the [[1991 Washington Redskins season|1991 season]], when they won [[Super Bowl XXVI]]. During the 1994 season for San Diego, Humphries completed 264 out of 453 attempts for 3,209 yards and 17 touchdowns, with 12 interceptions. Wide receiver [[Mark Seay]] was the team's leading receiver with 58 receptions for 645 yards and 6 touchdowns. Wide receiver [[Tony Martin (American football)|Tony Martin]] had 50 catches for 885 yards and 7 touchdowns, wide receiver [[Shawn Jefferson]] recorded 43 catches for 627 yards and 3 touchdowns, and tight end [[Alfred Pupunu]] had 21 receptions for 214 yards and 2 touchdowns.\n\nRunning back [[Natrone Means]] led the team in rushing with 1,350 yards and 12 touchdowns. He also recorded 39 receptions for 235 yards, and was named to the Pro Bowl. Third-down back [[Ronnie Harmon]] was also a big contributor, catching 58 passes for 615 yards and a touchdown. Meanwhile, the Chargers' [[special teams]] was also a major threat with [[Andre Coleman]], who returned 49 kickoffs for 1,293 yards (26.4 average yards per return) and 2 touchdowns.\n\nThe Chargers had an excellent defensive line, anchored by Pro Bowl defensive end [[Leslie O'Neal]], who led the team with 12.5 sacks and forced four fumbles, defensive tackle [[Chris Mims]], who recorded 11 sacks, and [[Shawn Lee (American football)|Shawn Lee]], who added 6.5 sacks and a fumble recovery. Their linebacking corps was led by [[Junior Seau]], who was a Pro Bowl selection for the fourth consecutive year, recording 123 tackles, 5.5 sacks, and 3 fumble recoveries. Defensive back [[Stanley Richard]] was a major weapon in the secondary, recording 4 interceptions, 224 return yards, and 2 touchdowns. Defensive back [[Darrien Gordon]] was also a major asset to the team, recording 4 interceptions and 32 return yards, while also adding another 475 yards and 2 touchdowns returning punts. Safety [[Rodney Harrison]] was a rookie on the team.\n\nChargers backup quarterback [[Gale Gilbert]] became the first player to be a member of five consecutive Super Bowl teams. He had been a third-string quarterback for the [[Buffalo Bills]], who had won AFC Championships in the four previous seasons (1990\u20131993).\n\n===San Francisco 49ers===\n{{main|1994 San Francisco 49ers season}}\n\nFrom the [[1988 NFL season|1988]] to the [[1993 NFL season|1993]] seasons, the 49ers played in five out of six NFC Championship Games, winning Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XXIII|XXIII]] and [[Super Bowl XXIV|XXIV]]. But after head coach [[George Seifert]]'s team lost two consecutive NFC Championship games to the [[Dallas Cowboys]] in [[1992-93 NFL playoffs|1992]] and [[1993-94 NFL playoffs|1993]], San Francisco brought in several veteran [[free agent]]s to strengthen their defense. Among the players signed were defensive linemen [[Richard Dent]] (the MVP of [[Super Bowl XX]]), [[Charles Mann (American football)|Charles Mann]], [[Rhett Hall]], and [[Rickey Jackson]]; linebackers [[Ken Norton Jr.]] and [[Gary Plummer (American football)|Gary Plummer]]; and cornerback [[Deion Sanders]].\n\nThe free agents enabled the 49ers to jump from the 18th-ranked defense in the league to the 8th, and to jump from the league's 16th-best defense against the run to the 2nd. [[Pro Bowl]] defensive lineman [[Dana Stubblefield]] led the team with 8.5 sacks. Rookie defensive tackle [[Bryant Young]] was also a big threat to opposing quarterbacks and rushers, recording 42 tackles, 6 sacks, and a fumble recovery. Behind them, Norton played very effectively at the middle linebacker position, leading the team with 77 tackles and recording an interception. Pro Bowl safety [[Merton Hanks]] led the team with 7 interceptions for 93 return yards, while Sanders had 6 interceptions for 303 return yards and 3 touchdowns, earning him the [[NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award]]. His 303 return yards was the third-highest total in NFL history, while his touchdown returns of 74, 93, and 90 yards made him the first player ever to have two 90-yard interception returns in one season. Pro Bowl safety [[Tim McDonald]] was also a big contributor, recording 2 interceptions for 79 yards and a touchdown.\n\nThe 49ers' offense was led by quarterback [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]], who replaced future [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Joe Montana]] as the starter in [[1991 NFL season|1991]] and [[1992 NFL season|1992]] due to injuries.  After Young led the league in passing in both seasons, Montana was traded to the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], leaving Young as the undisputed starter in 1993. But even with his impressive passing statistics, Young was criticized as \"not being able to win the big games\" as Montana had done in leading the 49ers to Super Bowl victories in [[Super Bowl XVI|XVI]], [[Super Bowl XIX|XIX]], XXIII, and XXIV.  It also didn't help that the team had lost to Montana's Chiefs 24\u201317 during the regular season.\n\nStill, Young again led the league in passing during the 1994 regular season with a [[passer rating]] of 112.8, breaking Montana's record for the highest regular season rating in NFL history. Young recorded 324 out of 461 completions for 3,969 yards, 35 touchdowns, and just 10 interceptions. He also had 58 rushes for 293 yards and 7 touchdowns, and earned the [[NFL Most Valuable Player Award]].\n\nWith Young at the helm, the 49ers led the league in total points scored (505) and helped them earn a league best 13\u20133 regular season record. Pro Bowl running back [[Ricky Watters]] was the team's leading rusher with 877 yards and 6 touchdowns, while also recording 66 receptions for 719 yards and 5 touchdowns. Rookie fullback [[William Floyd (American football)|William Floyd]] was the team's second-leading rusher with 305 yards and 6 touchdowns, while also having 19 receptions for 145 yards. The team's leading receiver was Pro Bowl wide receiver [[Jerry Rice]], who had 112 catches for 1,499 yards and 13 touchdowns, while also gaining 93 yards and two more touchdowns rushing the ball. Receiver [[John Taylor (American football)|John Taylor]] was also a reliable target, catching 41 passes for 531 yards and 5 touchdowns. Pro Bowl tight end [[Brent Jones]] added 49 receptions for 670 yards and 9 touchdowns. The offensive line was led by Pro Bowl center [[Bart Oates]], another offseason free agent pickup, and Pro Bowl guard [[Jesse Sapolu]].\n\nRunning back [[Dexter Carter]] had a standout season as a returner on [[special teams]], gaining a combined total of 1,426 yards and a touchdown returning both punts and kickoffs.\n\n===Playoffs===\n{{Further|1994\u201395 NFL playoffs}}\n\n====Chargers====\nIn the AFC Divisional Playoffs, the Chargers managed to overcome a 21\u20136 halftime deficit to defeat the [[1994 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]], 22\u201321. In the first half, San Diego was limited to only two [[John Carney (American football)|John Carney]] field goals, while Miami quarterback [[Dan Marino]] threw for over 180 yards and 3 touchdowns. However, the Chargers dominated the Dolphins in the second half, limiting their offense to just 16 plays. In the third quarter, after being stopped on fourth and goal at the 1-yard line, Chargers defensive lineman [[Reuben Davis (American football)|Reuben Davis]] tackled Dolphins running back [[Bernie Parmalee]] in the end zone for a safety. San Diego then took the ensuing free kick and marched 54 yards to score on Means' 24-yard touchdown run. Then with time running out, Humphries threw an 8-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Mark Seay, giving his team a one-point lead. The Dolphins, aided by a pass interference call, responded with a drive to the Chargers' 31-yard line, but kicker [[Pete Stoyanovich]]'s potential game-winning 48-yard field goal attempt sailed far to the right of the goal posts and sealed San Diego's stirring win.\n\nSan Diego then faced the [[1994 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] in the [[AFC Championship Game]]. Once again, the Chargers fell behind early as the Steelers built up a 13\u20133 halftime lead, but Humphries fooled the Steelers secondary with a 43-yard play-action touchdown pass to a wide open tight end [[Alfred Pupunu]]. The Chargers then took a 17\u201313 lead when Martin beat the Steelers secondary (particularly a badly overmatched [[Tim McKyer]]) down the right sideline for a 43-yard touchdown reception. On their final drive, the Steelers advanced to the San Diego 3-yard line, but Chargers linebacker [[Dennis Gibson (American football)|Dennis Gibson]] sealed the victory on fourth down by deflecting quarterback [[Neil O'Donnell]]'s pass intended for running back [[Barry Foster (American football)|Barry Foster]] to turn the ball back over to San Diego. Just like the 49ers in the NFC title game, the Chargers advanced to the Super Bowl despite the fact that the Steelers had outgained them in many key statistical categories such as total plays (80\u201347), total offensive yards (415\u2013226), and time of possession (37:13\u201322:47).\n\n====49ers====\nThe 49ers first defeated the [[1994 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]], 44\u201315, in the NFC Divisional Playoffs. Although Chicago scored first with a field goal, San Francisco scored 37 unanswered points to put the game out of reach by the end of the third quarter. Floyd scored three rushing touchdowns, while Young rushed for a touchdown and threw for another.\n\nSan Francisco then defeated [[49ers\u2013Cowboys rivalry|their nemesis]], the [[1994 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], 38\u201328, in the [[NFC Championship Game]]. Expected to be a close game, the 49ers converted 3 Dallas turnovers into 21 points in the first quarter. On the third play of the game, cornerback [[Eric Davis (American football)|Eric Davis]] returned an interception from Cowboys quarterback [[Troy Aikman]] for a touchdown. Wide receiver [[Michael Irvin]] lost a fumble on Dallas' next drive, setting up Young's 29-yard touchdown pass to Watters. Then Cowboys returner [[Kevin Williams (wide receiver, born 1971)|Kevin Williams]] lost a fumble on the ensuing kickoff, and it was recovered by kicker [[Doug Brien]] at Dallas' 35-yard line. Several plays later, Floyd scored on a 1-yard touchdown run to give San Francisco a 21\u20130 lead less than 8 minutes into the game. With the score 24\u201314 in the closing minutes of the first half, Aikman threw 3 straight incompletions, and a short punt by the Cowboys set up Young's 28-yard touchdown completion to Rice with 8 seconds remaining in the first half. The Cowboys eventually cut their deficit to 38\u201328 with a touchdown run by [[Emmitt Smith]] and Aikman's 10-yard touchdown pass to Irvin in the final period, but they were unable to score again. Although the Cowboys outgained the 49ers in total offensive yards (451\u2013294), Aikman broke an NFC Championship Game record with 380 yards passing, and Irvin also broke an NFC Championship Game record with 192 receiving yards, Dallas was ultimately unable to overcome their first-quarter turnovers.\n\n===Super Bowl pregame news===\nEntering Super Bowl XXIX, most sports writers and fans thought the Chargers had absolutely no chance of defeating the 49ers. San Francisco was on track, winning 12 of its last 13 games (with their only loss in that span coming against the Minnesota Vikings in a meaningless regular season finale at Minnesota), including their playoff victories. Many people also thought that the NFC Championship Game between the 49ers and the Cowboys was \"the real Super Bowl\", because those two teams were commonly viewed as vastly superior to any AFC team. Furthermore, San Francisco defeated San Diego, 38\u201315, during the regular season. As a result, the 49ers entered the game favored to win by 18\u00bd points, surpassing the 18 point spread in which the [[1968 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]] were favored over the [[1968 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] in [[Super Bowl III]] more than two decades prior.\n\nMany also speculated that Super Bowl XXIX would be the least watched game in Super Bowl history. In addition, the Chargers did not have as large of a core fan base when compared to the Chiefs, the Dolphins, or the Steelers. (This prediction ultimately turned out to be false. Although Super Bowl XXIX was viewed by 125.2 million people and had a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 41.3, [[Super Bowl XXVI]] three years earlier was seen by 119.7 million viewers and recorded a 40.3 rating.)\n\nThis was the seventh Super Bowl to be played in Miami, at the time tying both [[New Orleans]], Louisiana and the [[Greater Los Angeles area]] for hosting the Super Bowl the most times. It remains the only Super Bowl played between teams that play their home games in the same state (although [[Super Bowl XXV]] was played between the [[New York Giants]] and the [[Buffalo Bills]], two teams representing areas of [[New York (state)|New York]], the Giants play their home games in [[New Jersey]]).\n\n==Broadcasting==\nThe game was broadcast in the United States by the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC), with [[play-by-play|play-by-play announcer]] [[Al Michaels]] and [[color commentator]]s [[Frank Gifford]] and [[Dan Dierdorf]]. [[Lynn Swann]] ([[1994 San Diego Chargers season|Chargers]] sideline) and [[Lesley Visser]] ([[1994 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]] sideline) served as sideline reporters. During that Super Bowl, Visser became the first woman assigned to a Super Bowl sideline. Visser had previously become the first woman sportscaster to cover the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]] presentation ceremony, when she covered [[Super Bowl XXVI]] for [[NFL on CBS|CBS]]. [[Brent Musburger]] hosted all the Super Bowl XXIX pregame (2 hours), halftime, and postgame events with the help of then-[[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]] analyst [[Dick Vermeil]], Musburger's regular color commentator on ABC's [[college football]] [[ESPN College Football on ABC|telecasts]], and then-[[1994 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] quarterback [[Boomer Esiason]]. This would be the final Super Bowl hosted by Musburger, as all subsequent Super Bowls on ABC were hosted by [[ESPN]]'s [[Chris Berman]] following the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] purchase of ABC (which included ESPN), and the subsequent integration of ESPN and ABC Sports (now ESPN on ABC). Also, the trophy presentation for this game was the last to be held in the winning team's locker room, as all subsequent Vince Lombardi Trophy presentations would be held on the field.\n\nThis was the last Super Bowl broadcast by the ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' broadcast team of Michaels, Gifford and Dierdorf. This was the broadcast team for ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' from [[1987 NFL season|1987]] to [[1997 NFL season|1997]]. They also worked ABC's coverage of Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XXII|XXII]] and [[Super Bowl XXV|XXV]]. This would also be the last Super Bowl aired on ABC until the [[Super Bowl XXXIV|1999 season]] (when Al Michaels called the game with Boomer Esiason).\n\nOn the Tuesday prior to the Super Bowl, the ABC sitcom ''[[Full House]]'' aired an episode called \"[[Full House (season 8)|Super Bowl Fun Day]]\" involving two main characters actually at the game. (''Full House'' was set in San Francisco, and this was the only time during the show's run that the 49ers advanced to a Super Bowl aired on ABC.) A week earlier, the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode \"[[The Label Maker]]\" involved [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry]] trying to give away his tickets to the game. He eventually decided to go, but unfortunately was stuck sitting next to [[Newman (Seinfeld)|Newman]].\n\nThirty-second television advertisements for Super Bowl XXIX averaged $1.15 million in costs, the first time that Super Bowl ads exceeded the $1 million mark.\n\nThis Super Bowl aired in over 150 countries worldwide. It was simulcast in Canada on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] and [[TVA (Canada)|TVA]] (in French), in Mexico on [[Televisa]]'s [[XHGC-TV|Canal 5]], in Germany on [[Tele 5]], in Australia on the ABC, in [[the Philippines]] on the [[GMA Network]] and later aired in the United Kingdom on [[Channel 4]].\n\nFollowing the game ABC premiered the television drama ''[[Extreme (1995 TV series)|Extreme]]'' starring [[James Brolin]]; this was the last series to premiere following the Super Bowl until ''[[Family Guy]]'' premiered following [[Super Bowl XXXIII]] and is one of only four in the last fourteen years to premiere following a Super Bowl (joining ''Family Guy'', its spinoff ''[[American Dad!]]'', and ''[[Undercover Boss]]'' which premiered following [[Super Bowl XLIV]]), since the networks have preferred to have new episodes of established shows to catch as much of the post-game audience as possible.\n\nThis Super Bowl would later be featured on ''[[NFL's Greatest Games]]'' under the title ''Exercise in Excellence.''  The Super Bowl highlight film on which the episode was based was the only Super Bowl highlight film to be narrated by [[Harry Kalas]].\n\n==Entertainment==\n===Pregame ceremonies===\nThe pregame show held before the game featured [[country music]] singer [[Hank Williams Jr.]], who performed his theme song for ''[[Monday Night Football]]'', which was based on his single \"All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight\".\n\nActress and singer [[Kathie Lee Gifford]] (Frank Gifford's wife) later sang the national anthem. She was accompanied by then-[[Miss America]] [[Heather Whitestone]] who [[American Sign Language|signed]] the anthem for the hearing impaired.\n\nTo honor the NFL's 75th season, four former players all Hall of Fame members, who were named to the league's 75th Anniversary All-Time Team joined the [[coin flipping|coin toss]] ceremony: [[Otto Graham]], [[Joe Greene (American football)|Joe Greene]], [[Ray Nitschke]], and [[Gale Sayers]]. \n\nA special 75th anniversary logo was painted at midfield. Each player also wore a patch on his [[jersey (clothing)|jersey]] with the same logo; the 75th anniversary patch was worn by all players league-wide during the [[1994 NFL season|1994 season]]. During the regular season, teams also wore \"throwback\" jerseys for selected games. The 49ers wore their throwbacks (which paid tribute to the [[1957 San Francisco 49ers season|1957 Niners]]) for most of the season, this game included.\n\n===Halftime show===\nThe halftime show was titled \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of the Forbidden Eye\" and was produced by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] to promote their [[Indiana Jones Adventure]] attraction at [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] that opened later that year. The show featured actors playing [[Indiana Jones]] and his girlfriend [[Marion Ravenwood]] who were raiding the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]] from the Temple of the Forbidden Eye. The show also had performances by singers [[Tony Bennett]] and [[Patti LaBelle]], [[jazz]] trumpeter [[Arturo Sandoval]], and the [[Miami Sound Machine]]. The show ended with everybody singing \"Can You Feel The Love Tonight\", the song featured in Disney's (which later acquired ABC) 1994 film ''[[The Lion King]]''.\n\nThis halftime show also had a connection with past ABC programming: the first two ''Indiana Jones'' films had their broadcast premieres on ABC, and the network aired a TV series, ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'', from 1992 to 1993 (actually serving as the lead-in to ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' at one point).\n\n==Radio==\nThe game was broadcast on nationwide radio by [[NFL on Westwood One|CBS]] with [[play-by-play|play-by-play announcer]] [[Jack Buck]] and [[color commentator]] [[Hank Stram]].  [[Jim Hunter (sports broadcaster)|Jim Hunter]] hosted all of the events.  Locally, Super Bowl XXIX was broadcast by [[XEWW-AM|XTRA-AM]] in [[San Diego]] with [[Lee Hamilton (sports)|Lee \"Hacksaw\" Hamilton]] and [[Jim Laslavic]] and by [[KGO (AM)|KGO-AM]] in [[San Francisco]] with [[Joe Starkey]] and [[Wayne Walker]].\n\n==Game summary==\n\n===First quarter===\nOn the opening kickoff, a 15-yard face-mask penalty on Chargers linebacker Doug Miller gave San Francisco the ball at their own 41-yard line. Then on the third play of the drive, 49ers quarterback [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]] threw a 44-yard touchdown pass to [[Jerry Rice]]. The 49ers became the second team to take the opening kickoff and score a touchdown on that first drive (the first being the [[Miami Dolphins]] in [[Super Bowl VIII]]), and also set a new Super Bowl record for the fastest touchdown (later broken by the Chicago Bears' [[Devin Hester]] in [[Super Bowl XLI]]). After forcing the Chargers to punt, the 49ers advanced 79 yards in four plays, with Young rushing for 21 yards and then throwing a 51-yard touchdown pass to running back [[Ricky Watters]] to give San Francisco a 14\u20130 lead less than 5 minutes into the 1st quarter, and set a Super Bowl record for the fastest second touchdown scored by a team.\n\nThe Chargers responded on their ensuing possession, marching 78 yards in 13 plays and taking more than 7 minutes off the clock. Running back [[Natrone Means]] finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run to cut San Diego's deficit to 14\u20137. However, the 49ers quickly countered after the ensuing kickoff, driving 70 yards in 10 plays. Rice started off the drive with a 19-yard reception and 10-yard run on a reverse play, while Young added a 12-yard completion to [[John Taylor (American football)|John Taylor]] and a 15-yard scramble.\n\n===Second quarter===\nYoung eventually finished the drive with his third touchdown pass, this one from five yards out to fullback [[William Floyd (American football)|William Floyd]] five plays into the 2nd quarter.\n\nLater in the quarter, Chargers punter [[Bryan Wagner (American football)|Bryan Wagner]]'s 40-yard punt from his own 9-yard line gave the 49ers the ball at the San Diego 49. San Francisco then marched on a 9-play drive to score on Young's fourth touchdown pass, an 8-yard toss to Watters with 4:44 left in the half, making the score 28\u20137. The Chargers then took the ensuing kickoff and drove 62 yards from their own 25-yard line to the San Francisco 13, featuring a 33-yard gain on a [[screen pass]] from [[Stan Humphries]] to [[Eric Bieniemy]], San Diego's longest play of the game. But after three incomplete passes, one of which was a perfectly thrown Humphries pass that Mark Seay dropped in the end zone, they were forced to settle for kicker [[John Carney (American football)|John Carney's]] 31-yard field goal, cutting their deficit to 28\u201310.\n\nA 33-yard completion from Young to tight end [[Brent Jones]] helped the 49ers reach the San Diego 29-yard line on their next possession, but Young's third-down pass to Jones was overthrown, and rookie kicker [[Doug Brien]] missed a 47-yard field goal attempt. The Chargers then drove to their own 46-yard line, but 49ers defensive back Eric Davis intercepted Humphries' third-down pass in the end zone with 10 seconds left in the half, and the score remained 28\u201310 at halftime. The Chargers' 18-point halftime deficit ended up being the closest scoring margin they would reach for the rest of the game.\n\n===Third quarter===\nLeading 28\u201310 in the 3rd quarter, the 49ers added 14 more points. The Chargers were forced to punt after three plays on the opening drive of the second half, and [[Dexter Carter]] returned the ball 11 yards to his own 38-yard line. Young subsequently completed three consecutive passes for 53 yards on a 7-play, 62-yard drive that ended with Watters' third touchdown on a 9-yard run. After a 33-yard kickoff return by [[Andre Coleman]], the Chargers advanced to the San Francisco 33-yard line, but they turned the ball over on downs when Humphries' fourth-down pass was broken up by Davis. After the turnover, Young led his team on a 10-play, 67-yard drive, aided by a 22-yard pass interference penalty against [[Darrien Gordon]] on third and 14, to score on his fifth touchdown pass, a 15-yard completion to Rice. The Chargers' only highlight of the 3rd quarter was when Coleman returned the ensuing kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown. Then, wide receiver [[Mark Seay]] caught a pass for a successful [[two-point conversion]] (the first in Super Bowl history; the rule had been adopted by the NFL at the start of the season), but it only cut the deficit to 42\u201318.\n\nThe 49ers were forced to punt on their next drive, but San Diego ended up turning the ball over on downs when Means was tackled for a 4-yard loss on a fourth down and 1 from their own 37-yard line.\n\n===Fourth quarter===\nSix plays later, Young threw his record-setting sixth touchdown pass to Rice with 13:49 remaining in the game to make the score 49\u201318. The Chargers responded with a 13-play, 59-yard drive to get to the San Francisco 7-yard line, but 49ers defensive back [[Deion Sanders]] intercepted backup quarterback [[Gale Gilbert]]'s fourth-down pass in the end zone. After two San Francisco punts and another interception (defensive back [[Toi Cook]] picked off a pass from Humphries on the 49ers 28), the Chargers scored the final points of the game with a 30-yard touchdown pass from Humphries to wide receiver [[Tony Martin (footballer)|Tony Martin]] and another two-point conversion to make the score 49\u201326. San Francisco recovered the ensuing onside kick and ran time off the clock before punting to the San Diego 7.  San Diego drove to the San Francisco 35 before time ran out, and the game ended in a 49ers victory.\n\nAt the end of the game, Young showed his jubilation at finally being able to win \"the big one\" while accepting the MVP trophy.  \"There were times when this was hard! But this is the greatest feeling in the world!  No one \u2014 ''no one!'' \u2014 can ever take this away from us! No one, ''ever!'' It's ours!\"  Young and his teammates were equally enthusiastic in the locker room afterwards.  \"We're part of history,\" said guard [[Jesse Sapolu]]. \"This is probably the best offense people will see in their lifetimes.\"  \"Is this great or what?\" Young added. \"I mean, I haven't thrown six touchdown passes in a game in my life. Then I throw six in the Super Bowl! Unbelievable.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Telander|first=Rick|title=Superb!|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/features/superbowl/archives/29/|magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=February 6, 1995|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030404202137/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/features/superbowl/archives/29/|archive-date=April 4, 2003|access-date=January 30, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nRice caught 10 passes for 149 yards and 3 touchdowns, tying his own record for most touchdown receptions in a Super Bowl, and becoming the first player ever to do it twice. He also recorded 10 rushing yards. Watters rushed for 47 yards and a touchdown, while also catching 3 passes for 61 yards and two touchdowns. Means, who rushed for 1,350 yards in the regular season, was held to just 33 yards in the game. Humphries finished 24 out of 49 for 275 yards and one touchdown, with two interceptions. Seay was the Chargers' top receiver with 7 receptions for 75 yards, while [[Ronnie Harmon]] added 8 catches for 68 yards. Defensive end Raylee Johnson had two sacks. Coleman's 8 kickoff returns for 244 yards and a touchdown set the following Super Bowl records: most kickoff returns in a Super Bowl, most kickoff return yards in a Super Bowl, and most combined net yards gained in a Super Bowl.\n\nThis was the first Super Bowl to have two players each score three touchdowns. Rice matched his [[Super Bowl XXIV]] performance with his three touchdown catches. Watters also had three touchdowns, matching Roger Craig's three touchdowns (two receiving and one rushing) in [[Super Bowl XIX]]. Watters also became the second running back to catch two touchdown passes in a game, matching Craig.\n\n[[Ken Norton Jr.]] became the first player to win three straight Super Bowls, although as a member of two teams. Norton was a member of the Cowboys teams who won Super Bowls XXVII and XXVIII. [[Deion Sanders]] became the first player to play in both a Super Bowl and a World Series, playing in the [[1992 World Series]] with the [[1992 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]].\n\nChargers quarterback [[Gale Gilbert]] became the first player to be a member of five straight Super Bowl teams. Gilbert was a member of the Bills who played in four straight Super Bowls (XXV\u2013XXVIII). Gilbert was on the losing team in all five Super Bowl games.\n\nThe 49ers' spectacular performance led to their offensive coordinator, [[Mike Shanahan]], and defensive coordinator, [[Ray Rhodes]], earning head coaching positions in 1995 for the [[Denver Broncos]] and the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], respectively. [[Bobby Ross]] became the second coach, after [[Jimmy Johnson (football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]] in [[Super Bowl XXVII]], to lead a team to a [[NCAA Division I-A national football championship|college football national championship]] ([[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] in 1990) and a Super Bowl. One year later, [[Barry Switzer]] would join Johnson as the only coaches to win championships in both NCAA Division I-A (now FBS) college football and the NFL.\n\n===Box

Their [[2019 San Francisco 49ers season|2019 squad]] also lost [[Super Bowl LIV]] to the [[Kansas City Chiefs]].\n\nAs for the Chargers, the implications of their defeat were worse in hindsight. This remains the only Super Bowl the Chargers have ever played in including the pre AFL-NFL merger, [[1965 American Football League Championship Game|the 3rd championship game]] that the Chargers lost. The [[1963 American Football League playoffs|AFL Championship in 1963]] remains to this day as the only major sports championship the city of San Diego has won (and also the longest championship drought for any city that has at least two major sports franchises), so even though they were heavy underdogs, the loss still had a great significance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sandiego6.com/mostpopular/story/Are-San-Diego-Sports-Teams-Cursed/p9gpzJyNPEWgxpIADJhOSA.cspx |title=Are San Diego Sports Teams Cursed? |publisher=San Diego 6 |date= |accessdate=July 1, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716002728/http://www.sandiego6.com/mostpopular/story/Are-San-Diego-Sports-Teams-Cursed/p9gpzJyNPEWgxpIADJhOSA.cspx |archive-date=July 16, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1032492/4/index.htm|title=Thirteen years after missing a Super Bowl-winning field \u2013 07.12.04 \u2013 SI Vault<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=|access-date=January 15, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222080019/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1032492/4/index.htm|archive-date=February 22, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> The Chargers would also not win another playoff game since then until the [[2007 San Diego Chargers season|2007 season]], when they reached the AFC Championship, but lost to the then [[2007 New England Patriots season|18-0 New England Patriots]], 21\u201312.

The game was played on January 29, 1995 at [[Hard Rock Stadium|Joe Robbie Stadium]] in [[Miami|Miami, Florida]] (now part of the suburb of [[Miami Gardens, Florida|Miami Gardens]], which became a separate city in 2003).\n\nThis game is regarded as 49ers quarterback [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]]'s final leap out of the shadow of his predecessor, [[Joe Montana]], who had won four Super Bowls with the 49ers (in [[Super Bowl XVI|1981]], [[Super Bowl XIX|1984]], [[Super Bowl XXIII|1988]], and [[Super Bowl XXIV|1989]]), two with Young as the backup quarterback. With Young at the helm, and a defense consisting of several veteran [[free agent]]s who joined the team during the previous offseason, San Francisco finished the regular season with a league-best 13\u20133 record, and led the league in total points scored (505). The Chargers, on the other hand, were regarded as a [[Cinderella (sports)|\"Cinderella\" team]], and advanced to their first Super Bowl after posting an 11\u20135 regular-season record and overcoming halftime deficits in both of their playoff wins.\n\nThis was the first Super Bowl in which both teams scored in all four quarters. The combined aggregate score of 75 points and the ten total [[touchdown]]s both remain Super Bowl records. Still, the 49ers controlled most of the game, with Young completing touchdown passes in each of the 49ers' first two drives. The Chargers were able to cut the deficit late in the first quarter, 14\u20137, on a 13-play, 78-yard drive, but could not slow down San Francisco afterwards. Young was named the [[Super Bowl MVP]], throwing a Super Bowl-record six touchdown passes, and completing 24 out of 36 passes for 325 yards.\n\nDespite the predicted blowout (18\u00bd points is the largest margin a team has been favored by in a Super Bowl), the fact that San Diego did not have as much national appeal nor a relatively large core fan base, and two teams from [[California]] playing, which could have significantly diminished interest along the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], the telecast of the game on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] still had a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 41.3.<ref name=\"TVRatings\"/>\n\n==Background==\nNFL owners voted to award Super Bowl XXIX to Miami, Florida during a meeting on May 23, 1991. This was the seventh time that Miami hosted the game.\n\n===San Diego Chargers===\n{{main|1994 San Diego Chargers season}}\n\nThe Chargers were the biggest surprise of the 1994 season, with very few expecting them to even reach the playoffs, let alone the Super Bowl.\n\nSan Diego suffered losing seasons in the 1980s until former [[Washington Redskins]] general manager [[Bobby Beathard]] joined the team in 1990. Beathard decided to rebuild the Chargers using the same model that he used to build the Redskins into Super Bowl contenders during the 1980s \u2013 a powerful running game built around big linemen, a passing game that helped sustain extremely long drives, and a bending but steady defense. After former [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] head coach [[Bobby Ross]] was hired by the [[1992 San Diego Chargers season|Chargers in 1992]], the team won the [[AFC West]] with an 11\u20135 regular season record and won an opening round playoff game against Kansas City. But [[1993 San Diego Chargers season|in 1993]], they slumped back to 8\u20138 and did not reach the postseason.\n\nBefore the start of the 1994 season, San Diego was not expected to do well because they had so many newcomers via the draft and free agency; the Chargers ended up with 22 new players on their roster, and 10 of them became starters. However, they ended up winning their first six regular season games en route to an 11\u20135 record, the AFC West championship, and the #2 AFC playoff [[Single-elimination tournament#Seeding|seed]]. The Chargers went into the final game of the season against the Pittsburgh Steelers needing a win to get the #2 seed (a loss would have given that spot to the Miami Dolphins), which came with a first-round bye and a home game in the divisional round of the playoffs. Backup quarterback [[Gale Gilbert]], subbing for injured starter [[Stan Humphries]], led the Chargers to a come-from-behind 37\u201334 win, with [[John Carney (American football)|John Carney]] kicking a game-winning field goal in the game's final seconds.\n\nThe Chargers' offense was led by quarterback [[Stan Humphries]], who was the Redskins' backup to [[Mark Rypien]] during the [[1991 Washington Redskins season|1991 season]], when they won [[Super Bowl XXVI]]. During the 1994 season for San Diego, Humphries completed 264 out of 453 attempts for 3,209 yards and 17 touchdowns, with 12 interceptions. Wide receiver [[Mark Seay]] was the team's leading receiver with 58 receptions for 645 yards and 6 touchdowns. Wide receiver [[Tony Martin (American football)|Tony Martin]] had 50 catches for 885 yards and 7 touchdowns, wide receiver [[Shawn Jefferson]] recorded 43 catches for 627 yards and 3 touchdowns, and tight end [[Alfred Pupunu]] had 21 receptions for 214 yards and 2 touchdowns.\n\nRunning back [[Natrone Means]] led the team in rushing with 1,350 yards and 12 touchdowns. He also recorded 39 receptions for 235 yards, and was named to the Pro Bowl. Third-down back [[Ronnie Harmon]] was also a big contributor, catching 58 passes for 615 yards and a touchdown. Meanwhile, the Chargers' [[special teams]] was also a major threat with [[Andre Coleman]], who returned 49 kickoffs for 1,293 yards (26.4 average yards per return) and 2 touchdowns.\n\nThe Chargers had an excellent defensive line, anchored by Pro Bowl defensive end [[Leslie O'Neal]], who led the team with 12.5 sacks and forced four fumbles, defensive tackle [[Chris Mims]], who recorded 11 sacks, and [[Shawn Lee (American football)|Shawn Lee]], who added 6.5 sacks and a fumble recovery. Their linebacking corps was led by [[Junior Seau]], who was a Pro Bowl selection for the fourth consecutive year, recording 123 tackles, 5.5 sacks, and 3 fumble recoveries. Defensive back [[Stanley Richard]] was a major weapon in the secondary, recording 4 interceptions, 224 return yards, and 2 touchdowns. Defensive back [[Darrien Gordon]] was also a major asset to the team, recording 4 interceptions and 32 return yards, while also adding another 475 yards and 2 touchdowns returning punts. Safety [[Rodney Harrison]] was a rookie on the team.\n\nChargers backup quarterback [[Gale Gilbert]] became the first player to be a member of five consecutive Super Bowl teams. He had been a third-string quarterback for the [[Buffalo Bills]], who had won AFC Championships in the four previous seasons (1990\u20131993).\n\n===San Francisco 49ers===\n{{main|1994 San Francisco 49ers season}}\n\nFrom the [[1988 NFL season|1988]] to the [[1993 NFL season|1993]] seasons, the 49ers played in five out of six NFC Championship Games, winning Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XXIII|XXIII]] and [[Super Bowl XXIV|XXIV]]. But after head coach [[George Seifert]]'s team lost two consecutive NFC Championship games to the [[Dallas Cowboys]] in [[1992-93 NFL playoffs|1992]] and [[1993-94 NFL playoffs|1993]], San Francisco brought in several veteran [[free agent]]s to strengthen their defense. Among the players signed were defensive linemen [[Richard Dent]] (the MVP of [[Super Bowl XX]]), [[Charles Mann (American football)|Charles Mann]], [[Rhett Hall]], and [[Rickey Jackson]]; linebackers [[Ken Norton Jr.]] and [[Gary Plummer (American football)|Gary Plummer]]; and cornerback [[Deion Sanders]].\n\nThe free agents enabled the 49ers to jump from the 18th-ranked defense in the league to the 8th, and to jump from the league's 16th-best defense against the run to the 2nd. [[Pro Bowl]] defensive lineman [[Dana Stubblefield]] led the team with 8.5 sacks. Rookie defensive tackle [[Bryant Young]] was also a big threat to opposing quarterbacks and rushers, recording 42 tackles, 6 sacks, and a fumble recovery. Behind them, Norton played very effectively at the middle linebacker position, leading the team with 77 tackles and recording an interception. Pro Bowl safety [[Merton Hanks]] led the team with 7 interceptions for 93 return yards, while Sanders had 6 interceptions for 303 return yards and 3 touchdowns, earning him the [[NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award]]. His 303 return yards was the third-highest total in NFL history, while his touchdown returns of 74, 93, and 90 yards made him the first player ever to have two 90-yard interception returns in one season. Pro Bowl safety [[Tim McDonald]] was also a big contributor, recording 2 interceptions for 79 yards and a touchdown.\n\nThe 49ers' offense was led by quarterback [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]], who replaced future [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Joe Montana]] as the starter in [[1991 NFL season|1991]] and [[1992 NFL season|1992]] due to injuries.  After Young led the league in passing in both seasons, Montana was traded to the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], leaving Young as the undisputed starter in 1993. But even with his impressive passing statistics, Young was criticized as \"not being able to win the big games\" as Montana had done in leading the 49ers to Super Bowl victories in [[Super Bowl XVI|XVI]], [[Super Bowl XIX|XIX]], XXIII, and XXIV.  It also didn't help that the team had lost to Montana's Chiefs 24\u201317 during the regular season.\n\nStill, Young again led the league in passing during the 1994 regular season with a [[passer rating]] of 112.8, breaking Montana's record for the highest regular season rating in NFL history. Young recorded 324 out of 461 completions for 3,969 yards, 35 touchdowns, and just 10 interceptions. He also had 58 rushes for 293 yards and 7 touchdowns, and earned the [[NFL Most Valuable Player Award]].\n\nWith Young at the helm, the 49ers led the league in total points scored (505) and helped them earn a league best 13\u20133 regular season record. Pro Bowl running back [[Ricky Watters]] was the team's leading rusher with 877 yards and 6 touchdowns, while also recording 66 receptions for 719 yards and 5 touchdowns. Rookie fullback [[William Floyd (American football)|William Floyd]] was the team's second-leading rusher with 305 yards and 6 touchdowns, while also having 19 receptions for 145 yards. The team's leading receiver was Pro Bowl wide receiver [[Jerry Rice]], who had 112 catches for 1,499 yards and 13 touchdowns, while also gaining 93 yards and two more touchdowns rushing the ball. Receiver [[John Taylor (American football)|John Taylor]] was also a reliable target, catching 41 passes for 531 yards and 5 touchdowns. Pro Bowl tight end [[Brent Jones]] added 49 receptions for 670 yards and 9 touchdowns. The offensive line was led by Pro Bowl center [[Bart Oates]], another offseason free agent pickup, and Pro Bowl guard [[Jesse Sapolu]].\n\nRunning back [[Dexter Carter]] had a standout season as a returner on [[special teams]], gaining a combined total of 1,426 yards and a touchdown returning both punts and kickoffs.\n\n===Playoffs===\n{{Further|1994\u201395 NFL playoffs}}\n\n====Chargers====\nIn the AFC Divisional Playoffs, the Chargers managed to overcome a 21\u20136 halftime deficit to defeat the [[1994 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]], 22\u201321. In the first half, San Diego was limited to only two [[John Carney (American football)|John Carney]] field goals, while Miami quarterback [[Dan Marino]] threw for over 180 yards and 3 touchdowns. However, the Chargers dominated the Dolphins in the second half, limiting their offense to just 16 plays. In the third quarter, after being stopped on fourth and goal at the 1-yard line, Chargers defensive lineman [[Reuben Davis (American football)|Reuben Davis]] tackled Dolphins running back [[Bernie Parmalee]] in the end zone for a safety. San Diego then took the ensuing free kick and marched 54 yards to score on Means' 24-yard touchdown run. Then with time running out, Humphries threw an 8-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Mark Seay, giving his team a one-point lead. The Dolphins, aided by a pass interference call, responded with a drive to the Chargers' 31-yard line, but kicker [[Pete Stoyanovich]]'s potential game-winning 48-yard field goal attempt sailed far to the right of the goal posts and sealed San Diego's stirring win.\n\nSan Diego then faced the [[1994 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] in the [[AFC Championship Game]]. Once again, the Chargers fell behind early as the Steelers built up a 13\u20133 halftime lead, but Humphries fooled the Steelers secondary with a 43-yard play-action touchdown pass to a wide open tight end [[Alfred Pupunu]]. The Chargers then took a 17\u201313 lead when Martin beat the Steelers secondary (particularly a badly overmatched [[Tim McKyer]]) down the right sideline for a 43-yard touchdown reception. On their final drive, the Steelers advanced to the San Diego 3-yard line, but Chargers linebacker [[Dennis Gibson (American football)|Dennis Gibson]] sealed the victory on fourth down by deflecting quarterback [[Neil O'Donnell]]'s pass intended for running back [[Barry Foster (American football)|Barry Foster]] to turn the ball back over to San Diego. Just like the 49ers in the NFC title game, the Chargers advanced to the Super Bowl despite the fact that the Steelers had outgained them in many key statistical categories such as total plays (80\u201347), total offensive yards (415\u2013226), and time of possession (37:13\u201322:47).\n\n====49ers====\nThe 49ers first defeated the [[1994 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]], 44\u201315, in the NFC Divisional Playoffs. Although Chicago scored first with a field goal, San Francisco scored 37 unanswered points to put the game out of reach by the end of the third quarter. Floyd scored three rushing touchdowns, while Young rushed for a touchdown and threw for another.\n\nSan Francisco then defeated [[49ers\u2013Cowboys rivalry|their nemesis]], the [[1994 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], 38\u201328, in the [[NFC Championship Game]]. Expected to be a close game, the 49ers converted 3 Dallas turnovers into 21 points in the first quarter. On the third play of the game, cornerback [[Eric Davis (American football)|Eric Davis]] returned an interception from Cowboys quarterback [[Troy Aikman]] for a touchdown. Wide receiver [[Michael Irvin]] lost a fumble on Dallas' next drive, setting up Young's 29-yard touchdown pass to Watters. Then Cowboys returner [[Kevin Williams (wide receiver)|Kevin Williams]] lost a fumble on the ensuing kickoff, and it was recovered by kicker [[Doug Brien]] at Dallas' 35-yard line. Several plays later, Floyd scored on a 1-yard touchdown run to give San Francisco a 21\u20130 lead less than 8 minutes into the game. With the score 24\u201314 in the closing minutes of the first half, Aikman threw 3 straight incompletions, and a short punt by the Cowboys set up Young's 28-yard touchdown completion to Rice with 8 seconds remaining in the first half. The Cowboys eventually cut their deficit to 38\u201328 with a touchdown run by [[Emmitt Smith]] and Aikman's 10-yard touchdown pass to Irvin in the final period, but they were unable to score again. Although the Cowboys outgained the 49ers in total offensive yards (451\u2013294), Aikman broke an NFC Championship Game record with 380 yards passing, and Irvin also broke an NFC Championship Game record with 192 receiving yards, Dallas was ultimately unable to overcome their first-quarter turnovers.\n\n===Super Bowl pregame news===\nEntering Super Bowl XXIX, most sports writers and fans thought the Chargers had absolutely no chance of defeating the 49ers. San Francisco was on track, winning 12 of its last 13 games (with their only loss in that span coming against the Minnesota Vikings in a meaningless regular season finale at Minnesota), including their playoff victories. Many people also thought that the NFC Championship Game between the 49ers and the Cowboys was \"the real Super Bowl\", because those two teams were commonly viewed as vastly superior to any AFC team. Furthermore, San Francisco defeated San Diego, 38\u201315, during the regular season. As a result, the 49ers entered the game favored to win by 18\u00bd points, surpassing the 18 point spread in which the [[1968 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]] were favored over the [[1968 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] in [[Super Bowl III]] more than two decades prior.\n\nMany also speculated that Super Bowl XXIX would be the least watched game in Super Bowl history. In addition, the Chargers did not have as large of a core fan base when compared to the Chiefs, the Dolphins, or the Steelers. (This prediction ultimately turned out to be false. Although Super Bowl XXIX was viewed by 125.2 million people and had a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 41.3, [[Super Bowl XXVI]] three years earlier was seen by 119.7 million viewers and recorded a 40.3 rating.)\n\nThis was the seventh Super Bowl to be played in Miami, at the time tying both [[New Orleans]], Louisiana and the [[Greater Los Angeles area]] for hosting the Super Bowl the most times. It remains the only Super Bowl played between teams that play their home games in the same state (although [[Super Bowl XXV]] was played between the [[New York Giants]] and the [[Buffalo Bills]], two teams representing areas of [[New York (state)|New York]], the Giants play their home games in [[New Jersey]]).\n\n==Broadcasting==\nThe game was broadcast in the United States by the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC), with [[play-by-play|play-by-play announcer]] [[Al Michaels]] and [[color commentator]]s [[Frank Gifford]] and [[Dan Dierdorf]]. [[Lynn Swann]] ([[1994 San Diego Chargers season|Chargers]] sideline) and [[Lesley Visser]] ([[1994 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]] sideline) served as sideline reporters. During that Super Bowl, Visser became the first woman assigned to a Super Bowl sideline. Visser had previously become the first woman sportscaster to cover the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]] presentation ceremony, when she covered [[Super Bowl XXVI]] for [[NFL on CBS|CBS]]. [[Brent Musburger]] hosted all the Super Bowl XXIX pregame (2 hours), halftime, and postgame events with the help of then-[[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]] analyst [[Dick Vermeil]], Musburger's regular color commentator on ABC's [[college football]] [[ESPN College Football on ABC|telecasts]], and then-[[1994 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] quarterback [[Boomer Esiason]]. This would be the final Super Bowl hosted by Musburger, as all subsequent Super Bowls on ABC were hosted by [[ESPN]]'s [[Chris Berman]] following the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] purchase of ABC (which included ESPN), and the subsequent integration of ESPN and ABC Sports (now ESPN on ABC). Also, the trophy presentation for this game was the last to be held in the winning team's locker room, as all subsequent Vince Lombardi Trophy presentations would be held on the field.\n\nThis was the last Super Bowl broadcast by the ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' broadcast team of Michaels, Gifford and Dierdorf. This was the broadcast team for ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' from [[1987 NFL season|1987]] to [[1997 NFL season|1997]]. They also worked ABC's coverage of Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XXII|XXII]] and [[Super Bowl XXV|XXV]]. This would also be the last Super Bowl aired on ABC until the [[Super Bowl XXXIV|1999 season]] (when Al Michaels called the game with Boomer Esiason).\n\nOn the Tuesday prior to the Super Bowl, the ABC sitcom ''[[Full House]]'' aired an episode called \"[[Full House (season 8)|Super Bowl Fun Day]]\" involving two main characters actually at the game. (''Full House'' was set in San Francisco, and this was the only time during the show's run that the 49ers advanced to a Super Bowl aired on ABC.) A week earlier, the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode \"[[The Label Maker]]\" involved [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry]] trying to give away his tickets to the game. He eventually decided to go, but unfortunately was stuck sitting next to [[Newman (Seinfeld)|Newman]].\n\nThirty-second television advertisements for Super Bowl XXIX averaged $1.15 million in costs, the first time that Super Bowl ads exceeded the $1 million mark.\n\nThis Super Bowl aired in over 150 countries worldwide. It was simulcast in Canada on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] and [[TVA (Canada)|TVA]] (in French), in Mexico on [[Televisa]]'s [[XHGC-TV|Canal 5]], in Germany on [[Tele 5]], in Australia on the ABC, in [[the Philippines]] on the [[GMA Network]] and later aired in the United Kingdom on [[Channel 4]].\n\nFollowing the game ABC premiered the television drama ''[[Extreme (1995 TV series)|Extreme]]'' starring [[James Brolin]]; this was the last series to premiere following the Super Bowl until ''[[Family Guy]]'' premiered following [[Super Bowl XXXIII]] and is one of only four in the last fourteen years to premiere following a Super Bowl (joining ''Family Guy'', its spinoff ''[[American Dad!]]'', and ''[[Undercover Boss]]'' which premiered following [[Super Bowl XLIV]]), since the networks have preferred to have new episodes of established shows to catch as much of the post-game audience as possible.\n\nThis Super Bowl would later be featured on ''[[NFL's Greatest Games]]'' under the title ''Exercise in Excellence.''  The Super Bowl highlight film on which the episode was based was the only Super Bowl highlight film to be narrated by [[Harry Kalas]].\n\n==Entertainment==\n===Pregame ceremonies===\nThe pregame show held before the game featured [[country music]] singer [[Hank Williams Jr.]], who performed his theme song for ''[[Monday Night Football]]'', which was based on his single \"All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight\".\n\nActress and singer [[Kathie Lee Gifford]] (Frank Gifford's wife) later sang the national anthem. She was accompanied by then-[[Miss America]] [[Heather Whitestone]] who [[American Sign Language|signed]] the anthem for the hearing impaired.\n\nTo honor the NFL's 75th season, four former players all Hall of Fame members, who were named to the league's 75th Anniversary All-Time Team joined the [[coin flipping|coin toss]] ceremony: [[Otto Graham]], [[Joe Greene (American football)|Joe Greene]], [[Ray Nitschke]], and [[Gale Sayers]]. \n\nA special 75th anniversary logo was painted at midfield. Each player also wore a patch on his [[jersey (clothing)|jersey]] with the same logo; the 75th anniversary patch was worn by all players league-wide during the [[1994 NFL season|1994 season]]. During the regular season, teams also wore \"throwback\" jerseys for selected games. The 49ers wore their throwbacks (which paid tribute to the [[1957 San Francisco 49ers season|1957 Niners]]) for most of the season, this game included.\n\n===Halftime show===\nThe halftime show was titled \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of the Forbidden Eye\" and was produced by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] to promote their [[Indiana Jones Adventure]] attraction at [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] that opened later that year. The show featured actors playing [[Indiana Jones]] and his girlfriend [[Marion Ravenwood]] who were raiding the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]] from the Temple of the Forbidden Eye. The show also had performances by singers [[Tony Bennett]] and [[Patti LaBelle]], [[jazz]] trumpeter [[Arturo Sandoval]], and the [[Miami Sound Machine]]. The show ended with everybody singing \"Can You Feel The Love Tonight\", the song featured in Disney's (which later acquired ABC) 1994 film ''[[The Lion King]]''.\n\nThis halftime show also had a connection with past ABC programming: the first two ''Indiana Jones'' films had their broadcast premieres on ABC, and the network aired a TV series, ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'', from 1992 to 1993 (actually serving as the lead-in to ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' at one point).\n\n==Radio==\nThe game was broadcast on nationwide radio by [[NFL on Westwood One|CBS]] with [[play-by-play|play-by-play announcer]] [[Jack Buck]] and [[color commentator]] [[Hank Stram]].  [[Jim Hunter (sports broadcaster)|Jim Hunter]] hosted all of the events.  Locally, Super Bowl XXIX was broadcast by [[XEWW-AM|XTRA-AM]] in [[San Diego]] with [[Lee Hamilton (sports)|Lee \"Hacksaw\" Hamilton]] and [[Jim Laslavic]] and by [[KGO (AM)|KGO-AM]] in [[San Francisco]] with [[Joe Starkey]] and [[Wayne Walker]].\n\n==Game summary==\n\n===First quarter===\nOn the opening kickoff, a 15-yard face-mask penalty on Chargers linebacker Doug Miller gave San Francisco the ball at their own 41-yard line. Then on the third play of the drive, 49ers quarterback [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]] threw a 44-yard touchdown pass to [[Jerry Rice]]. The 49ers became the second team to take the opening kickoff and score a touchdown on that first drive (the first being the [[Miami Dolphins]] in [[Super Bowl VIII]]), and also set a new Super Bowl record for the fastest touchdown (later broken by the Chicago Bears' [[Devin Hester]] in [[Super Bowl XLI]]). After forcing the Chargers to punt, the 49ers advanced 79 yards in four plays, with Young rushing for 21 yards and then throwing a 51-yard touchdown pass to running back [[Ricky Watters]] to give San Francisco a 14\u20130 lead less than 5 minutes into the 1st quarter, and set a Super Bowl record for the fastest second touchdown scored by a team.\n\nThe Chargers responded on their ensuing possession, marching 78 yards in 13 plays and taking more than 7 minutes off the clock. Running back [[Natrone Means]] finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run to cut San Diego's deficit to 14\u20137. However, the 49ers quickly countered after the ensuing kickoff, driving 70 yards in 10 plays. Rice started off the drive with a 19-yard reception and 10-yard run on a reverse play, while Young added a 12-yard completion to [[John Taylor (American football)|John Taylor]] and a 15-yard scramble.\n\n===Second quarter===\nYoung eventually finished the drive with his third touchdown pass, this one from five yards out to fullback [[William Floyd (American football)|William Floyd]] five plays into the 2nd quarter.\n\nLater in the quarter, Chargers punter [[Bryan Wagner (American football)|Bryan Wagner]]'s 40-yard punt from his own 9-yard line gave the 49ers the ball at the San Diego 49. San Francisco then marched on a 9-play drive to score on Young's fourth touchdown pass, an 8-yard toss to Watters with 4:44 left in the half, making the score 28\u20137. The Chargers then took the ensuing kickoff and drove 62 yards from their own 25-yard line to the San Francisco 13, featuring a 33-yard gain on a [[screen pass]] from [[Stan Humphries]] to [[Eric Bieniemy]], San Diego's longest play of the game. But after three incomplete passes, one of which was a perfectly thrown Humphries pass that Mark Seay dropped in the end zone, they were forced to settle for kicker [[John Carney (American football)|John Carney's]] 31-yard field goal, cutting their deficit to 28\u201310.\n\nA 33-yard completion from Young to tight end [[Brent Jones]] helped the 49ers reach the San Diego 29-yard line on their next possession, but Young's third-down pass to Jones was overthrown, and rookie kicker [[Doug Brien]] missed a 47-yard field goal attempt. The Chargers then drove to their own 46-yard line, but 49ers defensive back Eric Davis intercepted Humphries' third-down pass in the end zone with 10 seconds left in the half, and the score remained 28\u201310 at halftime. The Chargers' 18-point halftime deficit ended up being the closest scoring margin they would reach for the rest of the game.\n\n===Third quarter===\nLeading 28\u201310 in the 3rd quarter, the 49ers added 14 more points. The Chargers were forced to punt after three plays on the opening drive of the second half, and [[Dexter Carter]] returned the ball 11 yards to his own 38-yard line. Young subsequently completed three consecutive passes for 53 yards on a 7-play, 62-yard drive that ended with Watters' third touchdown on a 9-yard run. After a 33-yard kickoff return by [[Andre Coleman]], the Chargers advanced to the San Francisco 33-yard line, but they turned the ball over on downs when Humphries' fourth-down pass was broken up by Davis. After the turnover, Young led his team on a 10-play, 67-yard drive, aided by a 22-yard pass interference penalty against [[Darrien Gordon]] on third and 14, to score on his fifth touchdown pass, a 15-yard completion to Rice. The Chargers' only highlight of the 3rd quarter was when Coleman returned the ensuing kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown. Then, wide receiver [[Mark Seay]] caught a pass for a successful [[two-point conversion]] (the first in Super Bowl history; the rule had been adopted by the NFL at the start of the season), but it only cut the deficit to 42\u201318.\n\nThe 49ers were forced to punt on their next drive, but San Diego ended up turning the ball over on downs when Means was tackled for a 4-yard loss on a fourth down and 1 from their own 37-yard line.\n\n===Fourth quarter===\nSix plays later, Young threw his record-setting sixth touchdown pass to Rice with 13:49 remaining in the game to make the score 49\u201318. The Chargers responded with a 13-play, 59-yard drive to get to the San Francisco 7-yard line, but 49ers defensive back [[Deion Sanders]] intercepted backup quarterback [[Gale Gilbert]]'s fourth-down pass in the end zone. After two San Francisco punts and another interception (defensive back [[Toi Cook]] picked off a pass from Humphries on the 49ers 28), the Chargers scored the final points of the game with a 30-yard touchdown pass from Humphries to wide receiver [[Tony Martin (footballer)|Tony Martin]] and another two-point conversion to make the score 49\u201326. San Francisco recovered the ensuing onside kick and ran time off the clock before punting to the San Diego 7.  San Diego drove to the San Francisco 35 before time ran out, and the game ended in a 49ers victory.\n\nAt the end of the game, Young showed his jubilation at finally being able to win \"the big one\" while accepting the MVP trophy.  \"There were times when this was hard! But this is the greatest feeling in the world!  No one \u2014 ''no one!'' \u2014 can ever take this away from us! No one, ''ever!'' It's ours!\"  Young and his teammates were equally enthusiastic in the locker room afterwards.  \"We're part of history,\" said guard [[Jesse Sapolu]]. \"This is probably the best offense people will see in their lifetimes.\"  \"Is this great or what?\" Young added. \"I mean, I haven't thrown six touchdown passes in a game in my life. Then I throw six in the Super Bowl! Unbelievable.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Telander|first=Rick|title=Superb!|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/features/superbowl/archives/29/|magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=February 6, 1995|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030404202137/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/features/superbowl/archives/29/|archive-date=April 4, 2003|access-date=January 30, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nRice caught 10 passes for 149 yards and 3 touchdowns, tying his own record for most touchdown receptions in a Super Bowl, and becoming the first player ever to do it twice. He also recorded 10 rushing yards. Watters rushed for 47 yards and a touchdown, while also catching 3 passes for 61 yards and two touchdowns. Means, who rushed for 1,350 yards in the regular season, was held to just 33 yards in the game. Humphries finished 24 out of 49 for 275 yards and one touchdown, with two interceptions. Seay was the Chargers' top receiver with 7 receptions for 75 yards, while [[Ronnie Harmon]] added 8 catches for 68 yards. Defensive end Raylee Johnson had two sacks. Coleman's 8 kickoff returns for 244 yards and a touchdown set the following Super Bowl records: most kickoff returns in a Super Bowl, most kickoff return yards in a Super Bowl, and most combined net yards gained in a Super Bowl.\n\nThis was the first Super Bowl to have two players each score three touchdowns. Rice matched his [[Super Bowl XXIV]] performance with his three touchdown catches. Watters also had three touchdowns, matching Roger Craig's three touchdowns (two receiving and one rushing) in [[Super Bowl XIX]]. Watters also became the second running back to catch two touchdown passes in a game, matching Craig.\n\n[[Ken Norton Jr.]] became the first player to win three straight Super Bowls, although as a member of two teams. Norton was a member of the Cowboys teams who won Super Bowls XXVII and XXVIII. [[Deion Sanders]] became the first player to play in both a Super Bowl and a World Series, playing in the [[1992 World Series]] with the [[1992 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]].\n\nChargers quarterback [[Gale Gilbert]] became the first player to be a member of five straight Super Bowl teams. Gilbert was a member of the Bills who played in four straight Super Bowls (XXV\u2013XXVIII). Gilbert was on the losing team in all five Super Bowl games.\n\nThe 49ers' spectacular performance led to their offensive coordinator, [[Mike Shanahan]], and defensive coordinator, [[Ray Rhodes]], earning head coaching positions in 1995 for the [[Denver Broncos]] and the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], respectively. [[Bobby Ross]] became the second coach, after [[Jimmy Johnson (football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]] in [[Super Bowl XXVII]], to lead a team to a [[NCAA Division I-A national football championship|college football national championship]] ([[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] in 1990) and a Super Bowl. One year later, [[Barry Switzer]] would join Johnson as the only coaches to win championships in both NCAA Division I-A (now FBS) college football and the NFL.\n\n===Box

Their [[2019 San Francisco 49ers season|2019 squad]] also lost [[Super Bowl LIV]] to the [[Kansas City Chiefs]].\n\nAs for the Chargers, the implications of their defeat were worse in hindsight. This remains the only Super Bowl the Chargers have ever played in including the pre AFL-NFL merger, [[1965 American Football League Championship Game|the 3rd championship game]] that the Chargers lost.

Technical students were transferred to the newly opened [[Abbs Cross Academy and Arts College|Abbs Cross Technical High School]]  in 1958, and Brittons was redesignated as a coeducational [[secondary modern school]]. In 1973 the school was redesignated as a [[comprehensive school]], and by 1981 the school was operating a [[sixth form]] for pupils aged up to 18. The sixth form provision was removed in 1990 due to local authority restructuring and Brittons became an 11-16 school. It gained Specialist [[Technology college]] status in 2001, and became a [[Foundation School]] in 2009.\n\nThe Brittons Academy had an [[Ofsted]] report of \"Inadequate\" following a full inspection on 3rd July 2019.<ref>http://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.brittons.havering.sch.uk/ The Brittons Academy official website]\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.brittons.havering.sch.uk/School%20History_updated%20170112.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226011913/http://www.brittons.havering.sch.uk/School%20History_updated%20170112.pdf|archivedate=26 December 2014|title=School History (archived)|website=The Brittons Academy|date=  |author= |accessdate= 26 July 2017}}\n\n{{Schools and colleges in Havering}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brittons Academy}}\n[[Category:Secondary schools in the London Borough of Havering]]\n[[Category:Academies in the London Borough of Havering]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1952]]\n[[Category:1952 establishments in England]]\n\n\n{{London-school-stub}}\n", "name_user": "YOUBINFEDSHEAINTFEDMEYET", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Added basic information, included sources)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brittons_Academy"}
