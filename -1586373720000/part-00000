All either forcibly close the glottis or allow the pharynx to remove particles into the digestive tract that may have been forced back up by both this tract and the upper respiratory tract. These reflexes can also protect the airways from any food or liquids that may spill over from the hypopharynx. The hypopharynx is the bottom part of pharynx, and can be considered the first area where the digestive tract splits from the airways. However, if the maximum capacity of fluids that the hypopharynx can safely hold is exceeded, then this excess fluid spills into the [[larynx]] and from there into the lungs. Therefore, these reflexes prevent levels reaching this maximum volume.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dua|first=Kulwinder|author2=Sri Naveen Surapaneni |author3=Shiko Kuribayashi |author4=Muhammed Hafeezullah |author5=Reza Shaker |title=Pharyngeal airway protective reflexes are triggered before the maximum volume of fluid that the hypopharynx can safely hold is exceeded|journal=Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol|date=May 2011|volume=301|issue=2|pages=G197-202|doi=10.1152/ajpgi.00046.2011|pmid=21566013|pmc=3154610}}</ref>\n\nSince both the digestive system and the respiratory system are connected by the pharynx, there are many problems and diseases that occur when the body is unable to regulate passage of food and air into the appropriate tracts.

The source of the river was earlier thought to be on the [[Chemayungdung glacier]], which covers the slopes of the Himalayas about {{convert|60|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} southeast of [[Lake Manasarovar]] in southwestern Tibet.

The most important left-bank tributaries are the Raka Zangbo (Raka Tsangpo), which joins the river west of [[Xigaz\u00ea]] (Shigatse), and the [[Lhasa River|Lhasa]] (Kyi), which flows past the Tibetan capital of [[Lhasa]] and joins the Tsangpo at [[Q\u00fcx\u00fc]]. The [[Nyang River|Nyang Qu]] (Gyamda) River joins the river from the north at Zela (Tsela Dzong). On the right bank, a second river called the Nyang Qu (Nyang Chu) meets the Tsangpo at Xigaz\u00ea.\n\nAfter passing Pi (Pe) in Tibet, the river turns suddenly to the north and northeast and cuts a course through a succession of great narrow gorges between the mountainous massifs of [[Gyala Peri]] and [[Namcha Barwa]] in a series of rapids and cascades. Thereafter, the river turns south and southwest and flows through a deep gorge (the \"[[Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon]]\") across the eastern extremity of the Himalayas with canyon walls that extend upward for {{convert|5000|m|abbr=on}} and more on each side. During that stretch, the river enters northern Arunachal Pradesh state in northeastern India, where it is known as the Dihang (or Siang) River, and turns more southerly.\n\n====Assam and adjoining region====\n[[File:Brahmaputra-river-basin.png|thumb|Brahmaputra basin in [[India]]]]\n\n[[File:Sunset in Dibrugarh.jpg|right|160px|thumb|A view of sunset in the Brahmaputra from Dibrugarh]]\nThe Yarlung Tsangpo (Brahmaputra) enters the state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] in India, where it is called Siang. It makes a very rapid descent from its original height in Tibet and finally appears in the plains, where it is called Dihang. It flows for about {{convert|35|km|abbr=on}} southward after which, it is joined by the [[Dibang River]] and the [[Lohit River]] at the head of the Assam Valley. Below the Lohit, the river is called  Brahmaputra and Doima(mother of water) and Burlung-Buthur by native [[Bodo people|Bodo]] tribals, it then enters the state of [[Assam]], and becomes very wide\u2014as wide as {{convert|20|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} in parts of Assam.\n\nThe Dihang, winding out of the mountains, turns towards the southeast and descends into a low-lying basin as it enters northeastern Assam state. Just west of the town of Sadiya, the river again turns to the southwest and is joined by two mountain streams, the Lohit, and the Dibang. Below that confluence, about {{convert|1450|km|abbr=on}} from the Bay of Bengal, the river becomes known conventionally as the Brahmaputra (\"Son of Brahma\"). In Assam, the river is mighty, even in the dry season, and during the rains, its banks are more than {{convert|8|km|abbr=on}} apart. As the river follows its braided {{convert|700|km|abbr=on}} course through the valley, it receives several rapidly flowing Himalayan streams, including the Subansiri, Kameng, Bhareli, Dhansiri, Manas, Champamati, Saralbhanga, and Sankosh Rivers. The main tributaries from the hills and from the plateau to the south are the Burhi Dihing, the Disang, the Dikhu, and the Kopili.\n\nBetween [[Dibrugarh district|Dibrugarh]] and [[Lakhimpur District]]s, the river divides into two channels\u2014the northern Kherkutia channel and the southern Brahmaputra channel.

Because of the river's narrow width, the [[Battle of Saraighat]] was fought here in March 1671. The first combined rail/road bridge across the Brahmaputra was opened to traffic in April 1962 at [[Saraighat]].\n\nThe environment of the Brahmaputra [[floodplain]]s in Assam have been described as the [[Brahmaputra Valley semi-evergreen forests]] [[ecoregion]].\n\n====Bangladesh====\n[[File:Bangladesh LOC 1996 map.jpg|left|175px|thumb|Rivers of Bangladesh, including the Brahmaputra]]\nIn Bangladesh, the Brahmaputra is joined by the [[Teesta River]] (or Tista), one of its largest tributaries. Below the Tista, the Brahmaputra splits into two [[distributary]] branches. The western branch, which contains the majority of the river's flow, continues due south as the Jamuna ({{lang|bn-Latn|Jomuna}}) to merge with the lower Ganga, called the [[Padma River]] ({{lang|bn-Latn|P\u00f4dda}}). The eastern branch, formerly the larger, but now much smaller, is called the lower or [[Old Brahmaputra]] ({{lang|bn-Latn|Brommoputro}}). It curves southeast to join the [[Meghna River]] near [[Dhaka]]. The Padma and Meghna converge near [[Chandpur District|Chandpur]] and flow out into the Bay of Bengal. This final part of the river is called Meghna.\n\nThe Brahmaputra enters the plains of Bangladesh after turning south around the Garo Hills below Dhuburi, India. After flowing past Chilmari, Bangladesh, it is joined on its right bank by the Tista River and then follows a 240&nbsp; km (150-mi) course due south as the Jamuna River. (South of Gaibanda, the Old Brahmaputra leaves the left bank of the mainstream and flows past Jamalpur and Mymensingh to join the Meghna River at Bhairab Bazar.) Before its confluence with the Ganga, the Jamuna receives the combined waters of the [[Baral River|Baral]], [[Atrai River|Atrai]], and [[Hurasagar River|Hurasagar]] Rivers on its right bank and becomes the point of departure of the large [[Dhaleswari River]] on its left bank. A tributary of the Dhaleswari, the Buriganga (\"Old Ganga\"), flows past Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, and joins the Meghna River above Munshiganj.\n\nThe Jamuna joins with the Ganga north of Goalundo Ghat, below which, as the Padma, their combined waters flow to the southeast for a distance of about {{convert|120|km|abbr=on}}. After several smaller channels branch off to feed the Ganga-Brahmaputra delta to the south, the main body of the Padma reaches its confluence with the Meghna River near Chandpur and then enters the Bay of Bengal through the Meghna estuary and lesser channels flowing through the delta. The growth of the Ganga-Brahmaputra Delta is dominated by tidal processes.\n\nThe [[Ganga Delta]], fed by the waters of numerous rivers, including the Ganga and Brahmaputra, is {{convert|59570|km2|sqmi}} the largest [[river delta]]s in the world.<ref name=\"SinghSharma2004\">{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Vijay P.|last2=Sharma|first2=Nayan|author3=C.

A region of significant tectonic activity has developed in the Jamuna River and is associated with the Himalayan uplift and development of the Bengal foredeep. Several researchers have hypothesized that the underlying structural control on the location of the major river systems of Bangladesh. A zone of 'structural weakness' along the present course of the Ganga-Jamuna-Padma Rivers due to either a subsiding trough or a fault at depth has been observed by Morgan and Melntire. (1959). Scijmonsbergen (1999) contends that width changes in the Jamuna may respond to these faults and they may also cause increased sedimentation upstream of the fault. He presented a few images to argue that a fault downstream of the Bangabandhu Multipurpose Bridge has affected channel migration. Huge accumulations of sediment that have been fed from Himalayan erosion has been produced due to the deepening of the Bengal Basin, with the thickness of sediment above the Precambrian basement increasing from a few hundred meters in the shelf region to over 18&nbsp; km in the Bengal foredeep to the south. The tectonic and climatic context for the large water and sediment discharges in the rivers of Bangladesh was set by the ongoing subsidence in the Bengal Basin, combined with high rates of Himalayan uplift. The control of uplift and subsidence is, however, clear.

K. }}</ref> The discharge of the river Brahmaputra is highly affected by the melting of snow at the upper part of its catchment. The attenuation of river flow due to the melting of snow in the river Brahmaputra basin affects the downstream discharge of the river. This increase in discharge due to the significant retreat of snow gives rise to severe catastrophic problems such as flood and erosion. The weather is a cold and harsh climate.\n\n====Hydrology====\nThe hydrology of the Brahmaputra River is characterized by its significant rates of sediment discharge, the large and variable flows, along with its rapid channel aggradations and accelerated rates of basin denudation. Over time, the deepening of the Bengal Basin caused by erosion will result in the increase in hydraulic radius, and hence allowing for the huge accumulation of sediments fed from the Himalayan erosion by efficient sediment transportation. The thickness of the sediment accumulated above the Precambrian basement has increased over the years from a few hundred meters to over 18&nbsp; km in the Bengal fore-deep to the south. The ongoing subsidence of the Bengal Basin and the high rate of Himalayan uplift continues to contribute to the large water and sediment discharges of fine sand and silt, with 1% clay, in the Brahmaputra River.\n\nClimatic change plays a crucial role in affecting the basin hydrology. Throughout the year, there is a significant rise in hydrograph, with a broad peak between July and September. The Brahmaputra River experiences two high-water seasons, one in early summer caused by snowmelt in the mountains, and one in late summer caused by runoff from monsoon rains. The river flow is strongly influenced by snow and ice melting of the glaciers, which are located mainly on the eastern Himalaya regions in the upstream parts of the basin. The snow and glacier melt contribution to the total annual runoff is about 27%, while the annual rainfall contributes to about 1.9m and 19,830 m3 /s of discharge.  The highest recorded daily discharge in the Brahmaputra at Pandu was 72,726 m3 /s August 1962 while the lowest was 1,757 m3 /s in February 1968. The increased rates of snow and glacial melt are likely to increase summer flows in some river systems for a few decades, followed by a reduction in flow as the glaciers disappear and snowfall diminishes. This is particularly true for the dry season when water availability is crucial for the irrigation systems.\n\n====Floodplain evolution====\nThe course of the Brahmaputra River has changed drastically in the past two and a half centuries, moving its river course westwards for a distance of about {{convert|80|km|abbr=on}}, leaving its old river course, appropriately named the old Brahmaputra river, behind. In the past, the floodplain of the old river course had soils which were more properly formed compared to graded sediments on the operating Jamuna river. This change of river course resulted in modifications to the soil-forming process, which include acidification, the breakdown of clays and buildup of organic matter, with the soils showing an increasing amount of biotic homogenization, mottling, the coating around Peds and maturing soil arrangement, shape and pattern. In the future, the consequences of local ground subsidence coupled with flood prevention propositions, for instance, localised breakwaters, that increase flood-plain water depths outside the water breakers, may alter the water levels of the floodplains. Throughout the years, bars, scroll bars, and sand dunes are formed at the edge of the flood plain by deposition. The height difference of the channel topography is often not more than 1m-2m. Furthermore, flooding over the history of the river has caused the formation of river levees due to deposition from the overbank flow. The height difference between the levee top and the surrounding floodplains is typically 1m along small channels and 2-3m along major channels. Crevasse splay, a sedimentary fluvial deposit which forms when a stream breaks its natural or artificial levees and deposits sediment on a floodplain, are often formed due to a breach in the levee, forming a lobe of sediments which progrades onto the adjacent floodplain. Lastly, flood basins are often formed between the levees of adjacent rivers.\n\n====Flooding====\n[[File:Brahmaputra Plains in Goalpara District of Assam 857.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Flooded villages along the Brahmaputra]]\nDuring the monsoon season (June\u2013October), floods are a very common occurrence. Deforestation in the Brahmaputra watershed has resulted in increased siltation levels, flash floods, and soil erosion in critical downstream habitat, such as the [[Kaziranga National Park]] in middle Assam. Occasionally, massive flooding causes huge losses to crops, life, and property. Periodic flooding is a natural phenomenon which is ecologically important because it helps maintain the lowland grasslands and associated wildlife. Periodic floods also deposit fresh alluvium, replenishing the fertile soil of the Brahmaputra River Valley. Thus flooding, agriculture, and agricultural practices are closely connected.<ref>Das, D.C. 2000.

During the 1998 flood, over 70% of the land area of Bangladesh was inundated, affecting 31 million people and 1 million homesteads. In the 1998 flood which had an unusually long duration from July to September, claimed 918 human lives and was responsible for damaging 16 00 and 6000&nbsp; km of roads and embankments respectively, and affecting 6000&nbsp; km<sup>2</sup> of standing crops. The 2004 floods, over 25% of the population of Bangladesh or 36 million people, were affected by the floods; 800 lives were lost; 952 000 houses were destroyed and 1.4 million were badly damaged; 24 000 educational institutions were affected including the destruction of 1200 primary schools, 2 million governments and private tube wells were affected, over 3 million latrines were damaged or washed away, this increases the risks of waterborne diseases including diarrhea and cholera. Also, 1.1 M ha of the rice crop was submerged and lost before it could be harvested, with 7% of the yearly ''aus'' (early season) rice crop lost; 270 000 ha of grazing land was affected, 5600 livestock perished together with 254 00 poultry and 63 MT of lost fish production.\n\nFlood-control measures are taken by the water resource department and the Brahmaputra Board, but until now the flood problem remains unsolved. At least a third of the land of Majuli island has been eroded by the river. Recently, it is suggested that a highway protected by concrete mat along the river bank and excavation of the river bed can curb this menace. This project, named the Brahmaputra River Restoration Project, is yet to be implemented by the government. Recently the Central Government approved the construction of Brahmaputra Express Highways.\n\n===Channel morphology===\nThe course of the Brahmaputra River has changed dramatically over the past 250 years, with evidence of large-scale avulsion, in the period 1776\u20131850, of 80&nbsp; km from east of the Madhupur tract to the west of it. Prior to 1843, the Brahmaputra flowed within the channel now termed the \"old Brahmaputra\". The banks of the river are mostly weakly cohesive sand and silts, which usually erodes through large scale slab failure, where previously deposited materials undergo scour and bank erosion during flood periods. Presently, the river's erosion rate has decreased to 30m per year as compared to 150m per year from 1973 to 1992. This erosion has, however, destroyed so much land that it has caused 0.7 million people to become homeless due to loss of land.\n\nSeveral studies have discussed the reasons for the avulsion of the river into its present course, and have suggested a number of reasons including tectonic activity, switches in the upstream course of the Teesta River, the influence of increased discharge, catastrophic floods and river capture into an old river course. From an analysis of maps of the river between 1776 and 1843, it was concluded in a study that the river avulsion was more likely gradual than catastrophic and sudden, and may have been generated by bank erosion, perhaps around a large mid-channel bar, causing a diversion of the channel into the existing floodplain channel.\n\nThe Brahmaputra channel is governed by the peak and low flow periods during which its bed undergoes tremendous modification. The Brahmaputra's bank line migration is inconsistent with time. The Brahmaputra river bed has widened significantly since 1916 and appears to be shifting more towards the south than towards the north. Together with the contemporary slow migration of the river, the left bank is being eroded away faster than the right bank.<ref name=\"researchgate.net\">{{Cite journal | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268404868 | title=Channel and Bed Morphology of a Part of the Brahmaputra River in Assam| journal=Journal of the Geological Society of India| volume=62| date=August 2003| last1=Gilfellon| first1=George| last2=Sarma| first2=Jogendra| last3=Gohain| first3=K.}}</ref>\n\n==== River engineering ====\nThe Brahmaputra River experiences high levels of [[bank erosion]] (usually via slab failure) and [[River channel migration|channel migration]] caused by its strong current, lack of riverbank vegetation, and loose sand and silt which compose its banks. It is thus difficult to build permanent structures on the river, and protective structures designed to limit the river's erosional effects often face numerous issues during and after construction. In fact, a 2004 report<ref>{{Cite report\n| date = 2004\n| url = http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/0601496727BB568AC1256F230033FBC5-lcg-bang-6oct.pdf\n| title = Monsoon Floods 2004: Post Flood Needs Assessment Summary Report\n| journal = Bangladesh Disaster and Emergency Sub-Group (BDER)\n| location = Dhaka, Bangladesh\n| page = 23\n| access-date = 25 February 2016\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160321070102/http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/0601496727BB568AC1256F230033FBC5-lcg-bang-6oct.pdf\n| archivedate = 21 March 2016\n| url-status = live\n}}</ref> by the Bangladesh Disaster and Emergency Sub-Group (BDER) has stated that several of such protective systems have 'just failed'. However, some progress has been made in the form of construction works which stabilize sections of the river, albeit the need for heavy maintenance. The [[Bangabandhu Bridge]], the only bridge to span the river's major distributary, the [[Jamuna River (Bangladesh)|Jamuna]], was thus opened in June 1998. Constructed at a narrow braid belt of the river, it is 4.8&nbsp; km long with a platform 18.5 m wide, and it is used to carry railroad traffic as well as gas, power and telecommunication lines. Due to the variable nature of the river, the prediction of the river's future course is crucial in planning upstream engineering to prevent flooding on the bridge.\n\nChina had built the [[Zangmu Dam]] in the upper course of the Brahmaputra River in the Tibet region and it was operationalised on 13 October 2015.<ref>{{cite news |date=13 October 2015 |title=China operationalizes biggest dam on Brahmaputra in Tibet |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/China-operationalizes-biggest-dam-on-Brahmaputra-in-Tibet/articleshow/49335741.cms |newspaper=The Times of India |access-date=26 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422074545/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/China-operationalizes-biggest-dam-on-Brahmaputra-in-Tibet/articleshow/49335741.cms |archive-date=22 April 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Brahmaputra River SPOT 1125.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Brahmaputra River seen from a [[spot satellite]]]]\n[[File:Brahmaputra system.png|thumb|right|250px|The Brahmaputra and its tributaries in northeastern India and Bangladesh]]\n[[File:1776 Rennell - Dury Wall Map of Bihar and Bengal, India - Geographicus - BaharBengal-dury-1776.jpg|thumb|300px|right|James Rennell's 1776 map shows the Brahmaputra's flow before an earthquake on 2 April 1762 and the [[Teesta River]] flowing in three channels to the Ganga before a flood in 1787.]]\n\n===Earlier history===\nEarly accounts give its name as Dyardanes.<ref>A compendium of ancient and modern geography: for the use of Eton School By Aaron Arrowsmith, page 56</ref> In the past, the course of the lower Brahmaputra was different and passed through the [[Jamalpur District|Jamalpur]] and [[Mymensingh]] districts. Some water still flows through that course, now called the Old Brahmaputra, as a distributary of the main channel.\n\nA question about the river system in [[Bangladesh]] is when and why the Brahmaputra changed its main course, at the site of the Jamuna and the \"Old Brahmaputra\" fork that can be seen by comparing modern maps to historic maps before the 1800s.<ref>e.g. Rennell, 1776; Rennel, 1787</ref> The Brahmaputra likely flowed directly south along its present main channel for much of the time since the [[last glacial maximum]], switching back and forth between the two courses several times throughout the [[Holocene]].\n\nOne idea about the most recent [[avulsion (river)|avulsion]] is that the change in the course of the main waters of the Brahmaputra took place suddenly in 1787, the year of the heavy flooding of the river Tista.\n\nIn the middle of the 18th century, at least three fair-sized streams flowed between the [[Rajshahi]] and [[Dhaka]] Divisions, viz., the Daokoba, a branch of the Tista, the Monash or Konai, and the [[Salangi]]. The Lahajang and the Elengjany were also important rivers. In Renault's time, the Brahmaputra as a first step towards securing a more direct course to the sea by leaving the [[Mahdupur]] Jungle to the east began to send a considerable volume of water down the Jinai or Jabuna from Jamalpur into the [[Monash (river)|Monash]] and Salangi. These rivers gradually coalesced and kept shifting to the west till they met the Daokoba, which was showing an equally rapid tendency to cut towards the east. The junction of these rivers gave the Brahmaputra a course worthy of her immense power, and the rivers to right and left silted up. In Renault's Altas they very much resemble the rivers of Jessore, which dried up after the hundred-mouthed Ganga had cut her new channel to join the Meghna at the south of the [[Munshiganj]] subdivision.\n\nIn 1809, [[Francis Buchanan-Hamilton]] wrote that the new channel between Bhawanipur and [[Dewanranj]] \"was scarcely inferior to the mighty river, and threatens to sweep away the intermediate country\". By 1830, the old channel had been reduced to its present insignificance. It was navigable by country boats throughout the year and by launches only during rains, but at the point as low as Jamalpur it was formidable throughout the cold weather. Similar was the position for two or three months just below Mymensingh also.\n\n===International cooperation===\nThe waters of the River Brahmaputra are shared by China, India, and Bangladesh. In the 1990s and 2000s, there was repeated speculation that mentioned Chinese plans to build a dam at the Great Bend, with a view to diverting the waters to the north of the country.

The source of the river was earlier thought to be on the [[Chemayungdung glacier]], which covers the slopes of the Himalayas about {{convert|60|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} southeast of [[Lake Manasarovar]] in southwestern Tibet. The river is {{convert|3848|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, and its drainage area is {{convert|712035|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} according to the new findings, while previous documents showed its length varied from 2,900 to 3,350&nbsp;km and its drainage area between 520,000 and 1.73&nbsp;million km<sup>2</sup>.

The most important left-bank tributaries are the Raka Zangbo (Raka Tsangpo), which joins the river west of [[Xigaz\u00ea]] (Shigatse), and the [[Lhasa River|Lhasa]] (Kyi), which flows past the Tibetan capital of [[Lhasa]] and joins the Tsangpo at [[Q\u00fcx\u00fc]]. The [[Nyang River|Nyang Qu]] (Gyamda) River joins the river from the north at Zela (Tsela Dzong). On the right bank, a second river called the Nyang Qu (Nyang Chu) meets the Tsangpo at Xigaz\u00ea.\n\nAfter passing Pi (Pe) in Tibet, the river turns suddenly to the north and northeast and cuts a course through a succession of great narrow gorges between the mountainous massifs of [[Gyala Peri]] and [[Namcha Barwa]] in a series of rapids and cascades. Thereafter, the river turns south and southwest and flows through a deep gorge (the \"[[Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon]]\") across the eastern extremity of the Himalayas with canyon walls that extend upward for {{convert|5000|m|abbr=on}} and more on each side. During that stretch, the river enters northern Arunachal Pradesh state in northeastern India, where it is known as the Dihang (or Siang) River, and turns more southerly.\n\n====Assam and adjoining region====\n[[File:Brahmaputra-river-basin.png|thumb|Brahmaputra basin in [[India]]]]\n\n[[File:Sunset in Dibrugarh.jpg|right|160px|thumb|A view of sunset in the Brahmaputra from Dibrugarh]]\nThe Yarlung Tsangpo (Brahmaputra) enters the state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] in India, where it is called Siang. It makes a very rapid descent from its original height in Tibet and finally appears in the plains, where it is called Dihang. It flows for about {{convert|35|km|abbr=on}} southward after which, it is joined by the [[Dibang River]] and the [[Lohit River]] at the head of the Assam Valley. Below the Lohit, the river is called  Brahmaputra and Doima(mother of water) and Burlung-Buthur by native [[Bodo people|Bodo]] tribals, it then enters the state of [[Assam]], and becomes very wide\u2014as wide as {{convert|20|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} in parts of Assam.\n\nThe Dihang, winding out of the mountains, turns towards the southeast and descends into a low-lying basin as it enters northeastern Assam state. Just west of the town of Sadiya, the river again turns to the southwest and is joined by two mountain streams, the Lohit, and the Dibang. Below that confluence, about {{convert|1450|km|abbr=on}} from the Bay of Bengal, the river becomes known conventionally as the Brahmaputra (\"Son of Brahma\"). In Assam, the river is mighty, even in the dry season, and during the rains, its banks are more than {{convert|8|km|abbr=on}} apart. As the river follows its braided {{convert|700|km|abbr=on}} course through the valley, it receives several rapidly flowing Himalayan streams, including the Subansiri, Kameng, Bhareli, Dhansiri, Manas, Champamati, Saralbhanga, and Sankosh Rivers. The main tributaries from the hills and from the plateau to the south are the Burhi Dihing, the Disang, the Dikhu, and the Kopili.\n\nBetween [[Dibrugarh district|Dibrugarh]] and [[Lakhimpur District]]s, the river divides into two channels\u2014the northern Kherkutia channel and the southern Brahmaputra channel. The two channels join again about {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} downstream, forming the [[Majuli]] island, which is the largest river island in the world.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Majuli|first1=River Island|title=Largest river island|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-river-island-|website=Guinness World Records|accessdate=6 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903033856/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-river-island-|archive-date=3 September 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> At [[Guwahati]], near the ancient pilgrimage centre of [[Hajo (India)|Hajo]], the Brahmaputra cuts through the rocks of the [[Shillong Plateau]], and is at its narrowest at {{convert|1|km|yd|abbr=on}} bank-to-bank. Because of the river's narrow width, the [[Battle of Saraighat]] was fought here in March 1671. The first combined rail/road bridge across the Brahmaputra was opened to traffic in April 1962 at [[Saraighat]].\n\nThe environment of the Brahmaputra [[floodplain]]s in Assam have been described as the [[Brahmaputra Valley semi-evergreen forests]] [[ecoregion]].\n\n====Bangladesh====\n[[File:Bangladesh LOC 1996 map.jpg|left|175px|thumb|Rivers of Bangladesh, including the Brahmaputra]]\nIn Bangladesh, the Brahmaputra is joined by the [[Teesta River]] (or Tista), one of its largest tributaries. Below the Tista, the Brahmaputra splits into two [[distributary]] branches. The western branch, which contains the majority of the river's flow, continues due south as the Jamuna ({{lang|bn-Latn|Jomuna}}) to merge with the lower Ganga, called the [[Padma River]] ({{lang|bn-Latn|P\u00f4dda}}). The eastern branch, formerly the larger, but now much smaller, is called the lower or [[Old Brahmaputra]] ({{lang|bn-Latn|Brommoputro}}). It curves southeast to join the [[Meghna River]] near [[Dhaka]]. The Padma and Meghna converge near [[Chandpur District|Chandpur]] and flow out into the Bay of Bengal. This final part of the river is called Meghna.\n\nThe Brahmaputra enters the plains of Bangladesh after turning south around the Garo Hills below Dhuburi, India. After flowing past Chilmari, Bangladesh, it is joined on its right bank by the Tista River and then follows a 240&nbsp; km (150-mi) course due south as the Jamuna River. (South of Gaibanda, the Old Brahmaputra leaves the left bank of the mainstream and flows past Jamalpur and Mymensingh to join the Meghna River at Bhairab Bazar.) Before its confluence with the Ganga, the Jamuna receives the combined waters of the [[Baral River|Baral]], [[Atrai River|Atrai]], and [[Hurasagar River|Hurasagar]] Rivers on its right bank and becomes the point of departure of the large [[Dhaleswari River]] on its left bank. A tributary of the Dhaleswari, the Buriganga (\"Old Ganga\"), flows past Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, and joins the Meghna River above Munshiganj.\n\nThe Jamuna joins with the Ganga north of Goalundo Ghat, below which, as the Padma, their combined waters flow to the southeast for a distance of about {{convert|120|km|abbr=on}}. After several smaller channels branch off to feed the Ganga-Brahmaputra delta to the south, the main body of the Padma reaches its confluence with the Meghna River near Chandpur and then enters the Bay of Bengal through the Meghna estuary and lesser channels flowing through the delta. The growth of the Ganga-Brahmaputra Delta is dominated by tidal processes.\n\nThe [[Ganga Delta]], fed by the waters of numerous rivers, including the Ganga and Brahmaputra, is {{convert|59570|km2|sqmi}} the largest [[river delta]]s in the world.<ref name=\"SinghSharma2004\">{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Vijay P.|last2=Sharma|first2=Nayan|author3=C.

A region of significant tectonic activity has developed in the Jamuna River and is associated with the Himalayan uplift and development of the Bengal foredeep. Several researchers have hypothesized that the underlying structural control on the location of the major river systems of Bangladesh. A zone of 'structural weakness' along the present course of the Ganga-Jamuna-Padma Rivers due to either a subsiding trough or a fault at depth has been observed by Morgan and Melntire. (1959). Scijmonsbergen (1999) contends that width changes in the Jamuna may respond to these faults and they may also cause increased sedimentation upstream of the fault. He presented a few images to argue that a fault downstream of the Bangabandhu Multipurpose Bridge has affected channel migration. Huge accumulations of sediment that have been fed from Himalayan erosion has been produced due to the deepening of the Bengal Basin, with the thickness of sediment above the Precambrian basement increasing from a few hundred meters in the shelf region to over 18&nbsp; km in the Bengal foredeep to the south. The tectonic and climatic context for the large water and sediment discharges in the rivers of Bangladesh was set by the ongoing subsidence in the Bengal Basin, combined with high rates of Himalayan uplift. The control of uplift and subsidence is, however, clear.

K. }}</ref> The discharge of the river Brahmaputra is highly affected by the melting of snow at the upper part of its catchment. The attenuation of river flow due to the melting of snow in the river Brahmaputra basin affects the downstream discharge of the river. This increase in discharge due to the significant retreat of snow gives rise to severe catastrophic problems such as flood and erosion. The weather is a cold and harsh climate.\n\n====Hydrology====\nThe hydrology of the Brahmaputra River is characterized by its significant rates of sediment discharge, the large and variable flows, along with its rapid channel aggradations and accelerated rates of basin denudation. Over time, the deepening of the Bengal Basin caused by erosion will result in the increase in hydraulic radius, and hence allowing for the huge accumulation of sediments fed from the Himalayan erosion by efficient sediment transportation. The thickness of the sediment accumulated above the Precambrian basement has increased over the years from a few hundred meters to over 18&nbsp; km in the Bengal fore-deep to the south. The ongoing subsidence of the Bengal Basin and the high rate of Himalayan uplift continues to contribute to the large water and sediment discharges of fine sand and silt, with 1% clay, in the Brahmaputra River.\n\nClimatic change plays a crucial role in affecting the basin hydrology. Throughout the year, there is a significant rise in hydrograph, with a broad peak between July and September. The Brahmaputra River experiences two high-water seasons, one in early summer caused by snowmelt in the mountains, and one in late summer caused by runoff from monsoon rains. The river flow is strongly influenced by snow and ice melting of the glaciers, which are located mainly on the eastern Himalaya regions in the upstream parts of the basin. The snow and glacier melt contribution to the total annual runoff is about 27%, while the annual rainfall contributes to about 1.9m and 19,830 m3 /s of discharge.  The highest recorded daily discharge in the Brahmaputra at Pandu was 72,726 m3 /s August 1962 while the lowest was 1,757 m3 /s in February 1968. The increased rates of snow and glacial melt are likely to increase summer flows in some river systems for a few decades, followed by a reduction in flow as the glaciers disappear and snowfall diminishes. This is particularly true for the dry season when water availability is crucial for the irrigation systems.\n\n====Floodplain evolution====\nThe course of the Brahmaputra River has changed drastically in the past two and a half centuries, moving its river course westwards for a distance of about {{convert|80|km|abbr=on}}, leaving its old river course, appropriately named the old Brahmaputra river, behind. In the past, the floodplain of the old river course had soils which were more properly formed compared to graded sediments on the operating Jamuna river. This change of river course resulted in modifications to the soil-forming process, which include acidification, the breakdown of clays and buildup of organic matter, with the soils showing an increasing amount of biotic homogenization, mottling, the coating around Peds and maturing soil arrangement, shape and pattern. In the future, the consequences of local ground subsidence coupled with flood prevention propositions, for instance, localised breakwaters, that increase flood-plain water depths outside the water breakers, may alter the water levels of the floodplains. Throughout the years, bars, scroll bars, and sand dunes are formed at the edge of the flood plain by deposition. The height difference of the channel topography is often not more than 1m-2m. Furthermore, flooding over the history of the river has caused the formation of river levees due to deposition from the overbank flow. The height difference between the levee top and the surrounding floodplains is typically 1m along small channels and 2-3m along major channels. Crevasse splay, a sedimentary fluvial deposit which forms when a stream breaks its natural or artificial levees and deposits sediment on a floodplain, are often formed due to a breach in the levee, forming a lobe of sediments which progrades onto the adjacent floodplain. Lastly, flood basins are often formed between the levees of adjacent rivers.\n\n====Flooding====\n[[File:Brahmaputra Plains in Goalpara District of Assam 857.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Flooded villages along the Brahmaputra]]\nDuring the monsoon season (June\u2013October), floods are a very common occurrence. Deforestation in the Brahmaputra watershed has resulted in increased siltation levels, flash floods, and soil erosion in critical downstream habitat, such as the [[Kaziranga National Park]] in middle Assam. Occasionally, massive flooding causes huge losses to crops, life, and property. Periodic flooding is a natural phenomenon which is ecologically important because it helps maintain the lowland grasslands and associated wildlife. Periodic floods also deposit fresh alluvium, replenishing the fertile soil of the Brahmaputra River Valley. Thus flooding, agriculture, and agricultural practices are closely connected.<ref>Das, D.C. 2000.

During the 1998 flood, over 70% of the land area of Bangladesh was inundated, affecting 31 million people and 1 million homesteads. In the 1998 flood which had an unusually long duration from July to September, claimed 918 human lives and was responsible for damaging 16 00 and 6000&nbsp; km of roads and embankments respectively, and affecting 6000&nbsp; km<sup>2</sup> of standing crops. The 2004 floods, over 25% of the population of Bangladesh or 36 million people, were affected by the floods; 800 lives were lost; 952 000 houses were destroyed and 1.4 million were badly damaged; 24 000 educational institutions were affected including the destruction of 1200 primary schools, 2 million governments and private tube wells were affected, over 3 million latrines were damaged or washed away, this increases the risks of waterborne diseases including diarrhea and cholera. Also, 1.1 M ha of the rice crop was submerged and lost before it could be harvested, with 7% of the yearly ''aus'' (early season) rice crop lost; 270 000 ha of grazing land was affected, 5600 livestock perished together with 254 00 poultry and 63 MT of lost fish production.\n\nFlood-control measures are taken by the water resource department and the Brahmaputra Board, but until now the flood problem remains unsolved. At least a third of the land of Majuli island has been eroded by the river. Recently, it is suggested that a highway protected by concrete mat along the river bank and excavation of the river bed can curb this menace. This project, named the Brahmaputra River Restoration Project, is yet to be implemented by the government. Recently the Central Government approved the construction of Brahmaputra Express Highways.\n\n===Channel morphology===\nThe course of the Brahmaputra River has changed dramatically over the past 250 years, with evidence of large-scale avulsion, in the period 1776\u20131850, of 80&nbsp; km from east of the Madhupur tract to the west of it. Prior to 1843, the Brahmaputra flowed within the channel now termed the \"old Brahmaputra\". The banks of the river are mostly weakly cohesive sand and silts, which usually erodes through large scale slab failure, where previously deposited materials undergo scour and bank erosion during flood periods. Presently, the river's erosion rate has decreased to 30m per year as compared to 150m per year from 1973 to 1992. This erosion has, however, destroyed so much land that it has caused 0.7 million people to become homeless due to loss of land.\n\nSeveral studies have discussed the reasons for the avulsion of the river into its present course, and have suggested a number of reasons including tectonic activity, switches in the upstream course of the Teesta River, the influence of increased discharge, catastrophic floods and river capture into an old river course. From an analysis of maps of the river between 1776 and 1843, it was concluded in a study that the river avulsion was more likely gradual than catastrophic and sudden, and may have been generated by bank erosion, perhaps around a large mid-channel bar, causing a diversion of the channel into the existing floodplain channel.\n\nThe Brahmaputra channel is governed by the peak and low flow periods during which its bed undergoes tremendous modification. The Brahmaputra's bank line migration is inconsistent with time. The Brahmaputra river bed has widened significantly since 1916 and appears to be shifting more towards the south than towards the north. Together with the contemporary slow migration of the river, the left bank is being eroded away faster than the right bank.<ref name=\"researchgate.net\">{{Cite journal | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268404868 | title=Channel and Bed Morphology of a Part of the Brahmaputra River in Assam| journal=Journal of the Geological Society of India| volume=62| date=August 2003| last1=Gilfellon| first1=George| last2=Sarma| first2=Jogendra| last3=Gohain| first3=K.}}</ref>\n\n==== River engineering ====\nThe Brahmaputra River experiences high levels of [[bank erosion]] (usually via slab failure) and [[River channel migration|channel migration]] caused by its strong current, lack of riverbank vegetation, and loose sand and silt which compose its banks. It is thus difficult to build permanent structures on the river, and protective structures designed to limit the river's erosional effects often face numerous issues during and after construction. In fact, a 2004 report<ref>{{Cite report\n| date = 2004\n| url = http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/0601496727BB568AC1256F230033FBC5-lcg-bang-6oct.pdf\n| title = Monsoon Floods 2004: Post Flood Needs Assessment Summary Report\n| journal = Bangladesh Disaster and Emergency Sub-Group (BDER)\n| location = Dhaka, Bangladesh\n| page = 23\n| access-date = 25 February 2016\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160321070102/http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/0601496727BB568AC1256F230033FBC5-lcg-bang-6oct.pdf\n| archivedate = 21 March 2016\n| url-status = live\n}}</ref> by the Bangladesh Disaster and Emergency Sub-Group (BDER) has stated that several of such protective systems have 'just failed'. However, some progress has been made in the form of construction works which stabilize sections of the river, albeit the need for heavy maintenance. The [[Bangabandhu Bridge]], the only bridge to span the river's major distributary, the [[Jamuna River (Bangladesh)|Jamuna]], was thus opened in June 1998. Constructed at a narrow braid belt of the river, it is 4.8&nbsp; km long with a platform 18.5 m wide, and it is used to carry railroad traffic as well as gas, power and telecommunication lines. Due to the variable nature of the river, the prediction of the river's future course is crucial in planning upstream engineering to prevent flooding on the bridge.\n\nChina had built the [[Zangmu Dam]] in the upper course of the Brahmaputra River in the Tibet region and it was operationalised on 13 October 2015.<ref>{{cite news |date=13 October 2015 |title=China operationalizes biggest dam on Brahmaputra in Tibet |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/China-operationalizes-biggest-dam-on-Brahmaputra-in-Tibet/articleshow/49335741.cms |newspaper=The Times of India |access-date=26 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422074545/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/China-operationalizes-biggest-dam-on-Brahmaputra-in-Tibet/articleshow/49335741.cms |archive-date=22 April 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Brahmaputra River SPOT 1125.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Brahmaputra River seen from a [[spot satellite]]]]\n[[File:Brahmaputra system.png|thumb|right|250px|The Brahmaputra and its tributaries in northeastern India and Bangladesh]]\n[[File:1776 Rennell - Dury Wall Map of Bihar and Bengal, India - Geographicus - BaharBengal-dury-1776.jpg|thumb|300px|right|James Rennell's 1776 map shows the Brahmaputra's flow before an earthquake on 2 April 1762 and the [[Teesta River]] flowing in three channels to the Ganga before a flood in 1787.]]\n\n===Earlier history===\nEarly accounts give its name as Dyardanes.<ref>A compendium of ancient and modern geography: for the use of Eton School By Aaron Arrowsmith, page 56</ref> In the past, the course of the lower Brahmaputra was different and passed through the [[Jamalpur District|Jamalpur]] and [[Mymensingh]] districts. Some water still flows through that course, now called the Old Brahmaputra, as a distributary of the main channel.\n\nA question about the river system in [[Bangladesh]] is when and why the Brahmaputra changed its main course, at the site of the Jamuna and the \"Old Brahmaputra\" fork that can be seen by comparing modern maps to historic maps before the 1800s.<ref>e.g. Rennell, 1776; Rennel, 1787</ref> The Brahmaputra likely flowed directly south along its present main channel for much of the time since the [[last glacial maximum]], switching back and forth between the two courses several times throughout the [[Holocene]].\n\nOne idea about the most recent [[avulsion (river)|avulsion]] is that the change in the course of the main waters of the Brahmaputra took place suddenly in 1787, the year of the heavy flooding of the river Tista.\n\nIn the middle of the 18th century, at least three fair-sized streams flowed between the [[Rajshahi]] and [[Dhaka]] Divisions, viz., the Daokoba, a branch of the Tista, the Monash or Konai, and the [[Salangi]]. The Lahajang and the Elengjany were also important rivers. In Renault's time, the Brahmaputra as a first step towards securing a more direct course to the sea by leaving the [[Mahdupur]] Jungle to the east began to send a considerable volume of water down the Jinai or Jabuna from Jamalpur into the [[Monash (river)|Monash]] and Salangi. These rivers gradually coalesced and kept shifting to the west till they met the Daokoba, which was showing an equally rapid tendency to cut towards the east. The junction of these rivers gave the Brahmaputra a course worthy of her immense power, and the rivers to right and left silted up. In Renault's Altas they very much resemble the rivers of Jessore, which dried up after the hundred-mouthed Ganga had cut her new channel to join the Meghna at the south of the [[Munshiganj]] subdivision.\n\nIn 1809, [[Francis Buchanan-Hamilton]] wrote that the new channel between Bhawanipur and [[Dewanranj]] \"was scarcely inferior to the mighty river, and threatens to sweep away the intermediate country\". By 1830, the old channel had been reduced to its present insignificance. It was navigable by country boats throughout the year and by launches only during rains, but at the point as low as Jamalpur it was formidable throughout the cold weather. Similar was the position for two or three months just below Mymensingh also.\n\n===International cooperation===\nThe waters of the River Brahmaputra are shared by China, India, and Bangladesh. In the 1990s and 2000s, there was repeated speculation that mentioned Chinese plans to build a dam at the Great Bend, with a view to diverting the waters to the north of the country.

However, Ravaisson developed his doctrine as what he called \u2018spiritualist realism\u2019 and \u2018spiritualist positivism\u2019, and - according to Ravaisson scholar [[Mark Sinclair (philosopher)|Mark Sinclair]] - can be thought of as founding 'the school of contingency'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9-10\">\"Sinclair (2019), pp. 9-10</ref> His most well known and influential successor was [[Henri Bergson]], with whom the tradition can be seen to end during the 1930s;<ref name=\"SinclairBI-1\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 1</ref> although the 'lineage' of this 'philosophy of life' can be seen to return in the late twentieth century with [[Gilles Deleuze]].<ref name=\"GroszHT-219\">\"Grosz (2013), p. 219</ref> Ravaisson never worked in the French state university system, in his late 20s declining a position at the University of Rennes.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-7\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 7</ref> In 1838 he was employed as the principle private secretary to the Minister of Public Instruction, going on to secure high-ranking positions such as Inspector General of Libraries, and then the Curator of Classical Antiquities at the [[Louvre]].<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> Later in his life he was appointed as the President of the Jury of the Aggregation of philosophy in France, 'a position of considerable influence'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 9</ref> Ravaisson, was not only a philosopher, classicist, archivist, and educational administrator, but also a painter exhibiting under the name Lach\u00e9.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> \n\n==Biography==\n\n[[File:Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau - Portrait of Jean-Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Larcher Ravaisson-Mollien.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A portrait of F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau.|F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau (1846)]]\n\nRavaisson was born at [[Namur]]. After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson's 'complete' 'three major' philosophical works are: ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d\u2019Aristote'' [Vol. 1 & Vol. 2] (1837 and 1846); ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''On Habit'', 1838); and ''Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme si\u00e8cle'' (1867).<ref name=\"SinclairBI-6\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 6</ref><ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-4-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), pp. 4-5</ref> Ravaisson also produced a number of other 'noteworthy essays' such as \"La Philosophie contemporaine\" (\"Contemporary Philosophy\", 1840); \"La Philosophie de Pascale\" (\"Pascal\u2019s Philosophy\", 1887), and \"M\u00e9taphysique et Morale\" (\"Metaphysics and Morals\", 1893).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref> Upon his death he also 'left unfinished fragments of a major work, which were published posthumously', first as \"Testament philosophique\" in ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale'' (\"Philosophical Testament\", 1901), then later in extended form as ''Testament philosophique'' (''Philosophical Testament'', 1933).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref><ref name=\"SinclairI-vii\">\"Sinclair (2016), p. vii</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!

However, Ravaisson developed his doctrine as what he called \u2018spiritualist realism\u2019 and \u2018spiritualist positivism\u2019, and - according to Ravaisson scholar [[Mark Sinclair (philosopher)|Mark Sinclair]] - can be thought of as founding 'the school of contingency'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9-10\">\"Sinclair (2019), pp. 9-10</ref> His most well known and influential successor was [[Henri Bergson]], with whom the tradition can be seen to end during the 1930s;<ref name=\"SinclairBI-1\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 1</ref> although the 'lineage' of this 'philosophy of life' can be seen to return in the late twentieth century with [[Gilles Deleuze]].<ref name=\"GroszHT-219\">\"Grosz (2013), p. 219</ref> Ravaisson never worked in the French state university system, in his late 20s declining a position at the University of Rennes.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-7\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 7</ref> In 1838 he was employed as the principle private secretary to the Minister of Public Instruction, going on to secure high-ranking positions such as Inspector General of Libraries, and then the Curator of Classical Antiquities at the [[Louvre]].<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> Later in his life he was appointed as the President of the Jury of the Aggregation of philosophy in France, 'a position of considerable influence'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 9</ref> Ravaisson, was not only a philosopher, classicist, archivist, and educational administrator, but also a painter exhibiting under the name Lach\u00e9.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> \n\n==Biography==\n\n[[File:Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau - Portrait of Jean-Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Larcher Ravaisson-Mollien.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A portrait of F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau.|F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau (1846)]]\n\nRavaisson was born at [[Namur]]. After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson's 'complete' 'three major' philosophical works are: ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d\u2019Aristote'' [Vol. 1 & Vol. 2] (1837 and 1846); ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''On Habit'', 1838); and ''Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme si\u00e8cle'' (1867).<ref name=\"SinclairBI-6\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 6</ref><ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-4-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), pp. 4-5</ref> Ravaisson also produced a number of other 'noteworthy essays' such as \"La Philosophie contemporaine\" (\"Contemporary Philosophy\", 1840); \"La Philosophie de Pascale\" (\"Pascal\u2019s Philosophy\", 1887), and \"M\u00e9taphysique et Morale\" (\"Metaphysics and Morals\", 1893).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref> Upon his death he also 'left unfinished fragments of a major work, which were published posthumously', first as \"Testament philosophique\" in ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale'' (\"Philosophical Testament\", 1901), then later in extended form as ''Testament philosophique'' (''Philosophical Testament'', 1933).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref><ref name=\"SinclairI-vii\">\"Sinclair (2016), p. vii</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!

He was twice [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]].\n\n==Background and education==\nSpencer was the son of [[Frederick Spencer, 4th Earl Spencer]], by his first wife Georgiana, daughter of William Poyntz. The prominent Whig politician [[John Spencer, 3rd Earl Spencer]], was his uncle and [[Charles Spencer, 6th Earl Spencer]], his half-brother. He was educated at [[Harrow School|Harrow]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], from which he graduated in 1857.<ref>{{acad|id=SPNR853JP|name=Spencer, John Poyntz, Viscount Althorp}}</ref>\n\n==Political career, 1857\u20131885==\nAlmost immediately after leaving Cambridge Spencer was elected to parliament for [[South Northamptonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South Northamptonshire]] as a Liberal, before departing for a tour of North America. He returned in December 1857, and within a few days his father died, leaving him as the new Earl Spencer. He was sworn of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] in 1859<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=22283 |date=8 July 1859|page=2628}}</ref> and made a [[Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]] in 1864. Spencer split from other whiggish aristocratic Liberals in 1866 on the issue of [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Russell]]'s reform bill, which he supported, and his loyalty was rewarded by his appointment as [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] when Gladstone returned to power in 1868. Ireland came to be a major preoccupation of the remainder of Spencer's long political career. In this first tenure as Lord Lieutenant, he had to deal with implementation of the [[Irish Church Act 1869|disestablishment]] of the [[Church of Ireland]] in 1869 and of the [[Irish Land Act]] of 1870, both of which measures he strongly supported. Spencer, in fact, went further than most of his ministerial colleagues, including Gladstone himself, in arguing for the setting up of government tribunals to enforce fair rents on Irish landlords.\n\nSpencer, along with the successive [[Chief Secretary for Ireland|Chief Secretaries for Ireland]], [[Chichester Parkinson-Fortescue, 1st Baron Carlingford|Chichester Fortescue]] and Spencer's own cousin, [[Spencer Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|Lord Hartington]], supported coercive legislation to deal with the increase in agrarian crime, but at the same time supported a policy of releasing [[Fenian]] prisoners when possible. Spencer also had to deal during his tenure with Gladstone's Irish Universities Bill. In spite of Spencer's efforts to secure the support of the Catholic hierarchy for the bill, they opposed it, and it went down to defeat in the commons in March 1873. The government lingered on for a further year, until the election defeat of February 1874, when Spencer found himself out of office. When Gladstone returned to power for his second government in 1880, Spencer joined the Cabinet as [[Lord President of the Council]], having responsibility for education policy, and was partially responsible for several major educational reforms of the period. The increasingly tense situation in Ireland, however, commanded an increasing portion of Spencer's time. In May 1882, Gladstone's decision to release the Irish Nationalist leader [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] from prison led to the resignation of the hardline Chief Secretary for Ireland, [[William Edward Forster|W. E. Forster]]. As a result, Spencer, while retaining his seat in the cabinet and position as Lord President, was again appointed Lord Lieutenant to take charge of the government's Irish policy.\n[[File:MaolraSeoighe.jpeg|thumb|100px|left|Spencer received condemnation from Irish Nationalist sources for his role in the trial for the [[Maamtrasna murders]].<ref>\n{{cite news\n|url= https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/a-wrongful-hanging-in-connemara-1882-1.2650574\n|title= A wrongful hanging in Connemara, 1882\n|date= 20 May 2016\n|work= The Irish Times\n|page= \n}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Shield of arms of John Spencer, 5th Earl Spencer, KG, PC.png|thumb|262px|right|Shield of arms of John Spencer, 5th Earl Spencer, as displayed on his Order of the Garter stall plate in St. George's Chapel.]]\nSpencer and his new chief secretary, Gladstone's nephew and Hartington's brother [[Lord Frederick Cavendish]], crossed to Ireland on 5 May, but Cavendish and the permanent under-secretary, [[Thomas Henry Burke (civil servant)|Thomas Henry Burke]], were [[Phoenix Park Murders|murdered]] by extremist Irish nationalists the next day in [[Phoenix Park]], Dublin, while walking to the [[\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in|Viceregal Lodge]] where Spencer was staying. Spencer, assisted by [[Sir George Trevelyan, 2nd Baronet|George Trevelyan]], his new secretary, was now faced with the difficult task of pacifying Ireland. Spencer acted quickly to reform the Irish police forces and destroy the secret societies which had been responsible for the murders. He attracted heavy criticism for his poor handling of a group of murders in [[Maamtrasna]] - one of the supposed criminals, [[Myles Joyce]], had been hanged while still proclaiming his innocence, leading to a great deal of condemnation of Spencer from Irish Nationalist sources. The end of Spencer's second tenure as viceroy saw the successful visit of the [[Edward VII|Prince]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess of Wales]] to Ireland, but Spencer's efforts to get the [[Queen Victoria|Queen]] to agree to the creation of a royal residence in Ireland were unsuccessful.\n\n==Political career, 1885\u20131905==\nBy 1885, Gladstone's second government was in a very weak position, largely as a result of the death of [[Charles George Gordon|Charles Gordon]], and Spencer's efforts to renew the Irish Crimes Act and secure passage of a land purchase bill ran into opposition from the radicals in the Cabinet - [[Joseph Chamberlain]] and [[Sir Charles Dilke, 2nd Baronet|Sir Charles Dilke]] - who hoped to use the opportunity of the legislation to pass a greater measure of local self-government for Ireland. The issue remained up in the air when Gladstone's government fell in early June. During the interval between the fall of Gladstone's second government and the beginning of his third, in February 1886, Spencer became a convert to [[Irish Home Rule]], unlike most of the other leading Whigs, who deserted to [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionism]]. Spencer would serve as Lord President in Gladstone's third government, and was instrumental in the formulation of Gladstone's home rule legislation. After the defeat of the bill, Spencer joined his chief in opposition. Spencer's position on home rule led to his social ostracism by other members of his class, including the Queen herself, and spent much of his period in opposition getting his personal finances in order. He also acted from 1888 as chairman of the [[Northamptonshire County Council]], and continued to work with Gladstone and other liberal leaders in determining the shape of a home rule bill in the next liberal government.\n\n[[File:5 Earl Spencer.jpg|thumb|200px|Lord Spencer, in the robes of a [[Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter (KG)]].]]\nWhen the Liberals returned to power in August 1892, Spencer was appointed [[List of the First Lords of the Admiralty|First Lord of the Admiralty]]. Gladstone's opposition to Spencer's policy, following the recommendations of the [[Sea Lords]], of naval expansion, led to Gladstone's final resignation in March 1894. Gladstone himself nonetheless hoped that Spencer would be his successor, but the Queen did not seek his advice, and chose [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebery]] instead. Spencer continued to serve under Rosebery, and went out when the Liberal government fell in June 1895. In his later years, Spencer remained active in politics. Spencer was a key support for the Liberal leader in the Commons, [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] (who had previously been Spencer's Chief Secretary at the end of his second vice-regency) during the [[Boer War]], holding to the Liberal leader's middle course between the active anti-war position of the Radicals and the pro-war position of Rosebery's Liberal Imperialists. Following [[John Wodehouse, 1st Earl of Kimberley|Lord Kimberley's]] death in 1902, Spencer was elected Liberal leader in the House of Lords. Despite health problems, he was rumoured as late as February 1905 to be a potential candidate for Liberal prime minister should the Liberals soon return to power, as by then seemed likely as a result of the Unionist split over tariff reform. However, on 11 October of that year he suffered a major stroke which ended his political career, only two months shy of the Liberals' return to power.\n<!--* ''& chancellorship of the [[Victoria University (UK)|Victoria University]]-<nowiki/>{[[Leeds]]; [[Liverpool]]; [[Manchester]]}.''-->\n\n==Rifle Volunteers==\nAn [[Volunteer Force#The British Army following the Crimea|invasion scare in 1859]] led to a War Office decision to call for [[Volunteer Force#Creation of the Volunteer Force|local Volunteer Corps]] to be established.<ref>[Ian F.

Spencer''', [[Order of the Garter|KG]], [[Order of St Patrick|KP]], [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|PC]] (27 October 1835 \u2013 13 August 1910), known as '''Viscount Althorp''' from 1845 to 1857 (and also known as the ''Red Earl'' because of his distinctive long red beard), was a British [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] politician under, and close friend of, British prime minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]]. He was twice [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]].\n\n==Background and education==\nSpencer was the son of [[Frederick Spencer, 4th Earl Spencer]], by his first wife Georgiana, daughter of William Poyntz. The prominent Whig politician [[John Spencer, 3rd Earl Spencer]], was his uncle and [[Charles Spencer, 6th Earl Spencer]], his half-brother. He was educated at [[Harrow School|Harrow]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], from which he graduated in 1857.<ref>{{acad|id=SPNR853JP|name=Spencer, John Poyntz, Viscount Althorp}}</ref>\n\n==Political career, 1857\u20131885==\nAlmost immediately after leaving Cambridge Spencer was elected to parliament for [[South Northamptonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South Northamptonshire]] as a Liberal, before departing for a tour of North America. He returned in December 1857, and within a few days his father died, leaving him as the new Earl Spencer. He was sworn of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] in 1859<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=22283 |date=8 July 1859|page=2628}}</ref> and made a [[Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]] in 1864. Spencer split from other whiggish aristocratic Liberals in 1866 on the issue of [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Russell]]'s reform bill, which he supported, and his loyalty was rewarded by his appointment as [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] when Gladstone returned to power in 1868. Ireland came to be a major preoccupation of the remainder of Spencer's long political career. In this first tenure as Lord Lieutenant, he had to deal with implementation of the [[Irish Church Act 1869|disestablishment]] of the [[Church of Ireland]] in 1869 and of the [[Irish Land Act]] of 1870, both of which measures he strongly supported. Spencer, in fact, went further than most of his ministerial colleagues, including Gladstone himself, in arguing for the setting up of government tribunals to enforce fair rents on Irish landlords.\n\nSpencer, along with the successive [[Chief Secretary for Ireland|Chief Secretaries for Ireland]], [[Chichester Parkinson-Fortescue, 1st Baron Carlingford|Chichester Fortescue]] and Spencer's own cousin, [[Spencer Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|Lord Hartington]], supported coercive legislation to deal with the increase in agrarian crime, but at the same time supported a policy of releasing [[Fenian]] prisoners when possible. Spencer also had to deal during his tenure with Gladstone's Irish Universities Bill. In spite of Spencer's efforts to secure the support of the Catholic hierarchy for the bill, they opposed it, and it went down to defeat in the commons in March 1873. The government lingered on for a further year, until the election defeat of February 1874, when Spencer found himself out of office. When Gladstone returned to power for his second government in 1880, Spencer joined the Cabinet as [[Lord President of the Council]], having responsibility for education policy, and was partially responsible for several major educational reforms of the period. The increasingly tense situation in Ireland, however, commanded an increasing portion of Spencer's time. In May 1882, Gladstone's decision to release the Irish Nationalist leader [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] from prison led to the resignation of the hardline Chief Secretary for Ireland, [[William Edward Forster|W. E. Forster]]. As a result, Spencer, while retaining his seat in the cabinet and position as Lord President, was again appointed Lord Lieutenant to take charge of the government's Irish policy.\n[[File:MaolraSeoighe.jpeg|thumb|100px|left|Spencer received condemnation from Irish Nationalist sources for his role in the trial for the [[Maamtrasna murders]].<ref>\n{{cite news\n|url= https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/a-wrongful-hanging-in-connemara-1882-1.2650574\n|title= A wrongful hanging in Connemara, 1882\n|date= 20 May 2016\n|work= The Irish Times\n|page= \n}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Shield of arms of John Spencer, 5th Earl Spencer, KG, PC.png|thumb|262px|right|Shield of arms of John Spencer, 5th Earl Spencer, as displayed on his Order of the Garter stall plate in St. George's Chapel.]]\nSpencer and his new chief secretary, Gladstone's nephew and Hartington's brother [[Lord Frederick Cavendish]], crossed to Ireland on 5 May, but Cavendish and the permanent under-secretary, [[Thomas Henry Burke (civil servant)|Thomas Henry Burke]], were [[Phoenix Park Murders|murdered]] by extremist Irish nationalists the next day in [[Phoenix Park]], Dublin, while walking to the [[\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in|Viceregal Lodge]] where Spencer was staying. Spencer, assisted by [[Sir George Trevelyan, 2nd Baronet|George Trevelyan]], his new secretary, was now faced with the difficult task of pacifying Ireland. Spencer acted quickly to reform the Irish police forces and destroy the secret societies which had been responsible for the murders. He attracted heavy criticism for his poor handling of a group of murders in [[Maamtrasna]] - one of the supposed criminals, [[Myles Joyce]], had been hanged while still proclaiming his innocence, leading to a great deal of condemnation of Spencer from Irish Nationalist sources. The end of Spencer's second tenure as viceroy saw the successful visit of the [[Edward VII|Prince]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess of Wales]] to Ireland, but Spencer's efforts to get the [[Queen Victoria|Queen]] to agree to the creation of a royal residence in Ireland were unsuccessful.\n\n==Political career, 1885\u20131905==\nBy 1885, Gladstone's second government was in a very weak position, largely as a result of the death of [[Charles George Gordon|Charles Gordon]], and Spencer's efforts to renew the Irish Crimes Act and secure passage of a land purchase bill ran into opposition from the radicals in the Cabinet - [[Joseph Chamberlain]] and [[Sir Charles Dilke, 2nd Baronet|Sir Charles Dilke]] - who hoped to use the opportunity of the legislation to pass a greater measure of local self-government for Ireland. The issue remained up in the air when Gladstone's government fell in early June. During the interval between the fall of Gladstone's second government and the beginning of his third, in February 1886, Spencer became a convert to [[Irish Home Rule]], unlike most of the other leading Whigs, who deserted to [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionism]]. Spencer would serve as Lord President in Gladstone's third government, and was instrumental in the formulation of Gladstone's home rule legislation. After the defeat of the bill, Spencer joined his chief in opposition. Spencer's position on home rule led to his social ostracism by other members of his class, including the Queen herself, and spent much of his period in opposition getting his personal finances in order. He also acted from 1888 as chairman of the [[Northamptonshire County Council]], and continued to work with Gladstone and other liberal leaders in determining the shape of a home rule bill in the next liberal government.\n\n[[File:5 Earl Spencer.jpg|thumb|200px|Lord Spencer, in the robes of a [[Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter (KG)]].]]\nWhen the Liberals returned to power in August 1892, Spencer was appointed [[List of the First Lords of the Admiralty|First Lord of the Admiralty]]. Gladstone's opposition to Spencer's policy, following the recommendations of the [[Sea Lords]], of naval expansion, led to Gladstone's final resignation in March 1894. Gladstone himself nonetheless hoped that Spencer would be his successor, but the Queen did not seek his advice, and chose [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebery]] instead. Spencer continued to serve under Rosebery, and went out when the Liberal government fell in June 1895. In his later years, Spencer remained active in politics. Spencer was a key support for the Liberal leader in the Commons, [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] (who had previously been Spencer's Chief Secretary at the end of his second vice-regency) during the [[Boer War]], holding to the Liberal leader's middle course between the active anti-war position of the Radicals and the pro-war position of Rosebery's Liberal Imperialists. Following [[John Wodehouse, 1st Earl of Kimberley|Lord Kimberley's]] death in 1902, Spencer was elected Liberal leader in the House of Lords. Despite health problems, he was rumoured as late as February 1905 to be a potential candidate for Liberal prime minister should the Liberals soon return to power, as by then seemed likely as a result of the Unionist split over tariff reform. However, on 11 October of that year he suffered a major stroke which ended his political career, only two months shy of the Liberals' return to power.\n<!--* ''& chancellorship of the [[Victoria University (UK)|Victoria University]]-<nowiki/>{[[Leeds]]; [[Liverpool]]; [[Manchester]]}.''-->\n\n==Rifle Volunteers==\nAn [[Volunteer Force#The British Army following the Crimea|invasion scare in 1859]] led to a War Office decision to call for [[Volunteer Force#Creation of the Volunteer Force|local Volunteer Corps]] to be established.<ref>[Ian F.

After studying at the [[Kingswood School]], Bath he attended the [[University of Edinburgh]] to study medicine but then took up law. He became a barrister, wrote several legal text-books, and in 1852 was made Recorder of [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]].\n\nWarren sat in the House of Commons for [[Midhurst (UK Parliament constituency)|Midhurst]] 1856\u20131859, and was a Master in Lunacy 1859\u201377. He was the author of ''[[Passages from the Diary of a late Physician]]'', which appeared (1832\u201337) first in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'', as did also the novel ''[[Ten Thousand a-Year]]'' (1839). Both attracted considerable attention, and were often reprinted and translated. The novel was based on the Alexander Humphrys-Alexander [[Earl of Stirling|Stirling forgery]] case, where a claim was made to a vacant earldom using fake documents. The shallow, profligate young protagonist, Tittlebat Titmouse, is said to be based on [[Edward Oxford]], who tried to assassinate Queen Victoria.\n\nHis last novel, ''Now and Then'' (1847), was a [[social novel]] of criminality and the law, arguing from a [[Methodist]] perspective the moral case for reform.

After studying at the [[Kingswood School]], Bath he attended the [[University of Edinburgh]] to study medicine but then took up law. He became a barrister, wrote several legal text-books, and in 1852 was made Recorder of [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]].\n\nWarren sat in the House of Commons for [[Midhurst (UK Parliament constituency)|Midhurst]] 1856\u20131859, and was a Master in Lunacy 1859-77. He was the author of ''[[Passages from the Diary of a late Physician]]'', which appeared (1832\u201337) first in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'', as did also the novel ''[[Ten Thousand a-Year]]'' (1839). Both attracted considerable attention, and were often reprinted and translated. The novel was based on the Alexander Humphrys-Alexander [[Earl of Stirling|Stirling forgery]] case, where a claim was made to a vacant earldom using fake documents. The shallow, profligate young protagonist, Tittlebat Titmouse, is said to be based on [[Edward Oxford]], who tried to assassinate Queen Victoria.\n\nHis last novel, ''Now and Then'' (1847), was a [[social novel]] of criminality and the law, arguing from a [[Methodist]] perspective the moral case for reform. It is realistically observed, based in outline on an actual case in [[Wolverhampton]], but had little success. Some critics thought Warren entertained exaggerated ideas as to the importance of his place in literature. However, his best known work, ''Ten Thousand a Year'', contains social satire rivalling that of [[Thackeray]], written from a Tory standpoint.\n\nHe was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in April 1835.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=5&dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27warren%27%29 |title=Library and Archiv catalogue |publisher=Royal Society |accessdate=30 October 2010 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> He died in London.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Hansard-contribs | mr-samuel-warren | Samuel Warren }}\n* [https://www.jstor.org/stable/743371  Samuel Warren: A Victorian Law and Literature Practitioner, by C.R.B.

I decided, that's it, I've as good as broken the record.<ref name=\"Tel2007\" />\n\n===The bike===\nObree had built frames for his bike shop and made another for his record attempt. Instead of traditional [[Bicycle handlebar#Drop|dropped handlebars]] it had straight bars like those of a mountain bike. He placed them closer to the [[Bicycle saddle|saddle]] than usual and rode with the bars under his chest, his elbows bent and tucked into his sides like those of a skier. Watching a [[washing machine]] spin at 1,200rpm led him to take the bearings, which he assumed must be of superior quality, and fit them to his bike.<ref name=\"Tel2007\" /><ref name=\"VeloOct93\">{{cite news| title=Article title unknown| publisher=V\u00e9lo| location=France|date=October 1993}}</ref><ref name=\"BikebizJan02\">{{cite web| url=http://www.bikebiz.com/news/21090/Graeme-Obree-rescued-in-hanging-attempt| title=Graeme Obree rescued in hanging attempt| publisher=Bikebiz| date=9 January 2002}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>Cycling Weekly, 29 March 1997</ref> Obree later regretted admitting to the bearings experiment, because journalists referred to that before his achievements and other innovations.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0037/index.shtml Graeme Obree: Homegrown Hero]</ref>\n\nObree called his bike \"Old Faithful\". It has a narrow [[bottom bracket]], around which the [[Crankset|cranks]] revolve, to bring his legs closer together, as he thought this is the \"natural\" position. As shown in the film, he thought a [[Q Factor (Bicycles)|tread]] of \"one banana\" would be ideal. The bike has no [[top tube]], so that his knees did not hit the frame. The [[Chainstay#Chain stays|chainstays]] are not horizontal to the ground. Thus the cranks can pass with a narrow bottom bracket. The [[Bicycle fork|fork]] had only one blade, carefully shaped to be as narrow as possible. A French writer who tried it said the narrow handlebars made it hard to accelerate the machine in a straight line but, once it was at speed, he could hold the bars and get into Obree's tucked style.\n\n:''At a high enough speed, [I could] tuck in my arms. And, above all, get in a very forward position on the bike, on the peak of the saddle. The Obree position isn't advantageous simply aerodynamically, it also allows, by pushing the point of pedalling towards the rear, to benefit from greater pressure while remaining in the saddle. You soon get an impression of speed, all the greater because you've got practically nothing [''deux fois rien''] between your hands. Two other things I noticed after a few hundred metres: I certainly didn't have the impression of turning 53 \u00d7 13, and the Obree position is no obstruction to breathing. But I wasn't pedalling at 55kmh, 100 turns of the pedals a minute, yet my arms already hurt.''<ref name=\"VeloOct93\" />\n\n=== Taking the record ===\nObree attacked Moser's record, on 16 July 1993, at the [[Vikingskipet]] [[velodrome]] in Norway.<ref group=\"n\">The track, 250m round, was built of Siberian pine in three and a half weeks to convert the indoor speed skating arena to a velodrome for the cycling world championships, and was removed shortly afterwards.</ref> He failed by nearly a kilometre.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://cyclinginfo.co.uk/cyclists/british/graeme-obree/| title=Graeme Obree| publisher=Cycling Info| date=17 June 2008}}</ref> He had booked the track for 24 hours and decided to come back the next day.<ref name=\"Tel2007\" /><ref name=Grdn>{{cite news|last1=Clemitson|first1=Suze|title=Why Jens Voigt and a new group of cyclists want to break the Hour record|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/100-tours-100-tales/2014/sep/19/why-jens-voigt-and-a-new-group-of-cyclists-want-to-break-the-hour-record|accessdate=19 September 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=19 September 2014}}</ref> The writer Nicholas Roe said:\n\n:To stop his aching body seizing up, Obree then took the unusual measure of drinking pint upon pint of water so that he had to wake up to go to the lavatory every couple of hours through the night. Each time he got up, he stretched his muscles. On the next weary day, he was up and out within minutes, at the deserted velodrome by 7:55 am and on the track ready to start just five minutes after that. He had barely slept. He had punished his body hugely the previous day. Surely this was a waste of time?<ref name=\"Tel2007\" />\n\nObree said:\n\n:I was [[Butch Cassidy]] in terms of swagger. I didn't want any negativity. This was [[blitzkrieg]]. I'm going in there. Let me do it. I'm not going to be the timorous guy from Scotland. That's what the difference was. Purely mental state. The day before, I had been a mouse. Now I was a lion.<ref name=\"Tel2007\" />\n\nOn 17 July 1993, Obree set a new record of 51.596&nbsp;kilometres, beating Moser's record of 51.151&nbsp;kilometres by 445 metres.<ref name=\"Indy06\" />\n\n===Losing the record===\nObree's triumph lasted less than a week. On 23 July 1993, the British Olympic champion, [[Chris Boardman]] broke Obree's record by 674 metres, riding 52.270&nbsp;km at [[Bordeaux]] during the rest day of the [[Tour de France]]. His bike had a carbon monocoque frame, carbon wheels, and a [[Triathlon bars#Triathlon or aero bars|triathlon handlebar]]. Their rivalry grew: a few months later Obree knocked Boardman out of the world championship pursuit to take the title himself.<ref>Cycling Weekly, 23 September 1995, p22</ref>\n\n===Regaining the record===\nFrancesco Moser, whose record Obree had beaten, adopted Obree's riding position\u2014adding a chest pad\u2014and established not an outright world record but a veterans' record of 51.84&nbsp;kilometres.{{clarify|date=June 2016}} He did it on 15 January 1994, riding in the thin air of [[Mexico City]] as he had for his outright record, whereas Obree and Boardman had ridden at close to sea level.\n\nObree retook the record on 27 April 1994, using the track that Boardman had used at Bordeaux. He had bolted his shoes to his pedals, to avoid what had happened in the final of the national pursuit championship, when he pulled his foot off the pedal during his starting effort.<ref group=\"n\">Bolting shoes to the pedals was pioneered by the Australian sprinter John Nicholson at the world championship in Leicester in 1970. Riders today use cleats on the soles of their shoes, which combined with specially designed pedals, make the accidental separation of the shoe from the pedal highly unlikely when the tension is properly adjusted.</ref>\n\nHe rode 52.713&nbsp;kilometres, a distance beaten on 2 September 1994 by the Spanish Tour de France winner, [[Miguel Indur\u00e1in]].\n\n===Old Faithful banned===\nThe world governing body, the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]], grew concerned that changes to bicycles were making a disproportionate influence to track records. Among other measures, it banned his riding position: he did not find out until one hour before he began the world championship pursuit in Italy.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cycling-no-daylight-for-obree-as-riding-position-falls-foul-of-rules-cyclings-world-pursuit-champion-has-ridden-into-trouble-again-robin-nichol-reports-from-palermo-1376851.html \"Cycling's world pursuit champion has ridden into trouble again\"], The Independent</ref> Judges disqualified him when he refused to comply.<ref name=\"CW19Aug95\">{{cite magazine| title=Article title unknown| magazine=Cycling Weekly| location=UK| date=19 August 1995| pp=26}}</ref> The magazine ''[[Cycling Weekly]]'' blamed \"petty-minded officialdom.\"<ref name=\"CW23Sep95p20\">{{cite magazine| title=Article title unknown| magazine=Cycling Weekly| location=UK| date=23 September 1995| pp=20}}</ref>\n\nObree developed another riding position, the \"Superman\" style, his arms fully extended in front, and he won the individual pursuit at the [[UCI Track Cycling World Championships|world championships]] with this and Old Faithful in 1995.<ref name=\"CW23Sep95p20\" /> That position was also banned.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/obrees-riding-position-banned-1357714.html \"Obree's riding position banned\"], The Independent</ref> However, in May 2014 the UCI relented, acknowledging that fixing the kind of equipment to be used was hindering technical progress. It restored previous banned world records, from 2000, now to be described as \"Best hour performance\".\n\nThe original Old Faithful bike is on display at the [[National Museum of Scotland]] in Edinburgh, while two near-replicas built for use in the ''Flying Scotsman'' film are displayed in the [[Riverside Transport Museum]] in Glasgow.<ref name=DRecord>{{cite web|last=McIver|first=Brian|title=Scots cycling legend Graeme Obree & stuntman Danny MacAskill race into Riverside Museum ahead of opening|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/scots-cycling-legend-graeme-obree-1104360|work=Daily Record, 31 May 2011|accessdate=5 September 2012}}</ref> In March 2018, Obree tested another replica of Old Faithful in the [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes-Benz F1 team]]'s wind tunnel to gauge the aerodynamic efficiency of his various riding positions on the bike, having never previously participated in wind-tunnel testing before. It was found that the {{CdA}} ([[drag coefficient]]) of Obree's initial \"tuck\" or \"crouch\" position was 0.17, compared to a conventional 1990s bike position of 0.20 and a modern conventional position of 0.188, leading to an estimated gain in speed of about 2-2.5 km/h over his rivals in the nineties and a gain of 1.5 km/h over contemporary track cyclists: meanwhile the \"Superman\" position was found only to be marginally more efficient than the 1990s conventional position, and less efficient than the modern conventional position. Obree however noted that the discomfort of the \"crouch\" position takes a lot of energy out of the rider through holding the hands and shoulders in place, whilst the \"Superman\" position was much more manageable.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/latest-news/graeme-obree-old-faithful-bike-put-test-wind-tunnel-heres-373769|title=Graeme Obree and his Old Faithful bike put to the test in a wind tunnel: Here\u2019s how they did |last=Hutchinson |first=Michael Hutchinson|author-link=Michael Hutchinson (cyclist) |date=21 March 2018 |website=[[Cycling Weekly]]|access-date=26 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Other achievements===\nObree was [[individual pursuit]] world champion in 1993 and 1995. He broke the British 10-mile [[individual time trial]] record in 1993, won the chiken nugget\n[[Cycling Time Trials|RTTC]] 50-mile championship the same year (a record 1h 39m 1s), and won the 25-mile championship in 1996. In 1997 he joined forces with coach Joe Beer and clocked 18m 36s in a 10-mile time trial (V718 Hull) and next day won the [[British Cycling Federation]] 25-mile championship - this was part of building towards an hour record attempt that was to be eventually shelved.\n\nThe writer Peter Bryan, of ''[[The Times]]'', said:\n\n<blockquote>''To see Obree in full flight, shoulders hunched and elbows tucked into his ribs, is a memorable sight. His face contorted with pain illustrates the effort he is putting in. And yet, not too many minutes after he has finished a ride the champion is sufficiently relaxed to talk with a queue of pressmen.<ref name=\"PCi\" /></blockquote>\n\n===Professional career===\nObree rode his hour records as an amateur. He took a professional licence after winning his first world championship, telling Bryan: \"I reckon I can make more money on the bike than I get from unemployment benefit.\"<ref name=\"PCi\" />\n\nHe joined [[Le Groupement (cycling team)|Le Groupement]], a French team but did not attend a meeting in [[Les Carroz d'Ar\u00e2ches]] ([[:fr:Les Carroz d'Ar\u00e2ches|fr]])<ref name=\"CW19Aug95\" /> and was fired for \"lack of professionalism.\"<ref name=\"CWsacked\">{{cite magazine| title=Obree sacked by French team| magazine=Cycling Weekly| location=UK|date=January 1995}}</ref> Obree had been racing in Florida when the team first met. But he was on holiday there when the team met again for publicity photographs. He got to the next get-together but flew to Paris instead of [[Lille]], where the meeting was held.<ref name=\"CWsacked\" />\n\nThe team manager, Patrick Valcke, said:\n\n:\"If a rider has that attitude, it's best to stop working together as soon as possible. We paid for his tickets [to fly from [[Glasgow]] to [[Geneva]]] and he didn't even turn up, didn't even phone to explain why he was not coming. He said that he did not want to leave his family so soon after the death of his brother (''see below'') but he could have phoned to tell us that. I don't want any more to do with him.\"<ref name=\"CWsacked\" />\n\nObree said: \"I was too ill to attend the get-together and had no success when I attempted to contact team officials on 1 January. My wife, Anne, who is a nurse, insisted I was not well enough to travel to France.\"<ref name=\"CW19Aug95\" /><ref name=\"CWsacked\" />\n\nThe Le Groupement team fell apart after a short time, when the sponsoring company was involved in scandal, with accusations that it was nothing but a pyramid selling scheme. Some of the team members claimed that they were owed money, and their wages had not been paid.\n\n===Attitude to doping===\nObree said of his short professional career:\n\n:\"I still feel I was robbed of part of my career. I was signed up to ride in the prologue of the Tour back in 1995, but it was made very obvious to me I would have to take drugs. I said no, no way, and I was sacked by my team. So there I was, 11 years later, sitting there waiting for the Tour cyclists to come by, and something welled up in me. I feel I was robbed by a lot of these bastards taking drugs. I also hate the way that people think anyone who has ever achieved anything on a bike must have been taking drugs. I was surprised how resentful I felt when I was in Paris.

Instead of traditional [[Bicycle handlebar#Drop|dropped handlebars]] it had straight bars like those of a mountain bike. He placed them closer to the [[Bicycle saddle|saddle]] than usual and rode with the bars under his chest, his elbows bent and tucked into his sides like those of a skier. Watching a [[washing machine]] spin at 1,200rpm led him to take the bearings, which he assumed must be of superior quality, and fit them to his bike.<ref name=\"Tel2007\" /><ref name=\"VeloOct93\">{{cite news| title=Article title unknown| publisher=V\u00e9lo| location=France|date=October 1993}}</ref><ref name=\"BikebizJan02\">{{cite web| url=http://www.bikebiz.com/news/21090/Graeme-Obree-rescued-in-hanging-attempt| title=Graeme Obree rescued in hanging attempt| publisher=Bikebiz| date=9 January 2002}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>Cycling Weekly, 29 March 1997</ref> Obree later regretted admitting to the bearings experiment, because journalists referred to that before his achievements and other innovations.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0037/index.shtml Graeme Obree: Homegrown Hero]</ref>\n\nObree called his bike \"Old Faithful\". It has a narrow [[bottom bracket]], around which the [[Crankset|cranks]] revolve, to bring his legs closer together, as he thought this is the \"natural\" position. As shown in the film, he thought a [[Q Factor (Bicycles)|tread]] of \"one banana\" would be ideal. The bike has no [[top tube]], so that his knees did not hit the frame. The [[Chainstay#Chain stays|chainstays]] are not horizontal to the ground. Thus the cranks can pass with a narrow bottom bracket. The [[Bicycle fork|fork]] had only one blade, carefully shaped to be as narrow as possible. A French writer who tried it said the narrow handlebars made it hard to accelerate the machine in a straight line but, once it was at speed, he could hold the bars and get into Obree's tucked style.\n\n:''At a high enough speed, [I could] tuck in my arms. And, above all, get in a very forward position on the bike, on the peak of the saddle. The Obree position isn't advantageous simply aerodynamically, it also allows, by pushing the point of pedalling towards the rear, to benefit from greater pressure while remaining in the saddle. You soon get an impression of speed, all the greater because you've got practically nothing [''deux fois rien''] between your hands. Two other things I noticed after a few hundred metres: I certainly didn't have the impression of turning 53 \u00d7 13, and the Obree position is no obstruction to breathing. But I wasn't pedalling at 55kmh, 100 turns of the pedals a minute, yet my arms already hurt.''<ref name=\"VeloOct93\" />\n\n=== Taking the record ===\nObree attacked Moser's record, on 16 July 1993, at the [[Vikingskipet]] [[velodrome]] in Norway.<ref group=\"n\">The track, 250m round, was built of Siberian pine in three and a half weeks to convert the indoor speed skating arena to a velodrome for the cycling world championships, and was removed shortly afterwards.</ref> He failed by nearly a kilometre.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://cyclinginfo.co.uk/cyclists/british/graeme-obree/| title=Graeme Obree| publisher=Cycling Info| date=17 June 2008}}</ref> He had booked the track for 24 hours and decided to come back the next day.<ref name=\"Tel2007\" /><ref name=Grdn>{{cite news|last1=Clemitson|first1=Suze|title=Why Jens Voigt and a new group of cyclists want to break the Hour record|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/100-tours-100-tales/2014/sep/19/why-jens-voigt-and-a-new-group-of-cyclists-want-to-break-the-hour-record|accessdate=19 September 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=19 September 2014}}</ref> The writer Nicholas Roe said:\n\n:To stop his aching body seizing up, Obree then took the unusual measure of drinking pint upon pint of water so that he had to wake up to go to the lavatory every couple of hours through the night. Each time he got up, he stretched his muscles. On the next weary day, he was up and out within minutes, at the deserted velodrome by 7:55 am and on the track ready to start just five minutes after that. He had barely slept. He had punished his body hugely the previous day. Surely this was a waste of time?<ref name=\"Tel2007\" />\n\nObree said:\n\n:I was [[Butch Cassidy]] in terms of swagger. I didn't want any negativity. This was [[blitzkrieg]]. I'm going in there. Let me do it. I'm not going to be the timorous guy from Scotland. That's what the difference was. Purely mental state. The day before, I had been a mouse. Now I was a lion.<ref name=\"Tel2007\" />\n\nOn 17 July 1993, Obree set a new record of 51.596&nbsp;kilometres, beating Moser's record of 51.151&nbsp;kilometres by 445 metres.<ref name=\"Indy06\" />\n\n===Losing the record===\nObree's triumph lasted less than a week. On 23 July 1993, the British Olympic champion, [[Chris Boardman]] broke Obree's record by 674 metres, riding 52.270&nbsp;km at [[Bordeaux]] during the rest day of the [[Tour de France]]. His bike had a carbon monocoque frame, carbon wheels, and a [[Triathlon bars#Triathlon or aero bars|triathlon handlebar]]. Their rivalry grew: a few months later Obree knocked Boardman out of the world championship pursuit to take the title himself.<ref>Cycling Weekly, 23 September 1995, p22</ref>\n\n===Regaining the record===\nFrancesco Moser, whose record Obree had beaten, adopted Obree's riding position\u2014adding a chest pad\u2014and established not an outright world record but a veterans' record of 51.84&nbsp;kilometres.{{clarify|date=June 2016}} He did it on 15 January 1994, riding in the thin air of [[Mexico City]] as he had for his outright record, whereas Obree and Boardman had ridden at close to sea level.\n\nObree retook the record on 27 April 1994, using the track that Boardman had used at Bordeaux. He had bolted his shoes to his pedals, to avoid what had happened in the final of the national pursuit championship, when he pulled his foot off the pedal during his starting effort.<ref group=\"n\">Bolting shoes to the pedals was pioneered by the Australian sprinter John Nicholson at the world championship in Leicester in 1970. Riders today use cleats on the soles of their shoes, which combined with specially designed pedals, make the accidental separation of the shoe from the pedal highly unlikely when the tension is properly adjusted.</ref>\n\nHe rode 52.713&nbsp;kilometres, a distance beaten on 2 September 1994 by the Spanish Tour de France winner, [[Miguel Indur\u00e1in]].\n\n===Old Faithful banned===\nThe world governing body, the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]], grew concerned that changes to bicycles were making a disproportionate influence to track records. Among other measures, it banned his riding position: he did not find out until one hour before he began the world championship pursuit in Italy.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cycling-no-daylight-for-obree-as-riding-position-falls-foul-of-rules-cyclings-world-pursuit-champion-has-ridden-into-trouble-again-robin-nichol-reports-from-palermo-1376851.html \"Cycling's world pursuit champion has ridden into trouble again\"], The Independent</ref> Judges disqualified him when he refused to comply.<ref name=\"CW19Aug95\">{{cite magazine| title=Article title unknown| magazine=Cycling Weekly| location=UK| date=19 August 1995| pp=26}}</ref> The magazine ''[[Cycling Weekly]]'' blamed \"petty-minded officialdom.\"<ref name=\"CW23Sep95p20\">{{cite magazine| title=Article title unknown| magazine=Cycling Weekly| location=UK| date=23 September 1995| pp=20}}</ref>\n\nObree developed another riding position, the \"Superman\" style, his arms fully extended in front, and he won the individual pursuit at the [[UCI Track Cycling World Championships|world championships]] with this and Old Faithful in 1995.<ref name=\"CW23Sep95p20\" /> That position was also banned.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/obrees-riding-position-banned-1357714.html \"Obree's riding position banned\"], The Independent</ref> However, in May 2014 the UCI relented, acknowledging that fixing the kind of equipment to be used was hindering technical progress. It restored previous banned world records, from 2000, now to be described as \"Best hour performance\".\n\nThe original Old Faithful bike is on display at the [[National Museum of Scotland]] in Edinburgh, while two near-replicas built for use in the ''Flying Scotsman'' film are displayed in the [[Riverside Transport Museum]] in Glasgow.<ref name=DRecord>{{cite web|last=McIver|first=Brian|title=Scots cycling legend Graeme Obree & stuntman Danny MacAskill race into Riverside Museum ahead of opening|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/scots-cycling-legend-graeme-obree-1104360|work=Daily Record, 31 May 2011|accessdate=5 September 2012}}</ref> In March 2018, Obree tested another replica of Old Faithful in the [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes-Benz F1 team]]'s wind tunnel to gauge the aerodynamic efficiency of his various riding positions on the bike, having never previously participated in wind-tunnel testing before. It was found that the {{CdA}} ([[drag coefficient]]) of Obree's initial \"tuck\" or \"crouch\" position was 0.17, compared to a conventional 1990s bike position of 0.20 and a modern conventional position of 0.188, leading to an estimated gain in speed of about 2-2.5 km/h over his rivals in the nineties and a gain of 1.5 km/h over contemporary track cyclists: meanwhile the \"Superman\" position was found only to be marginally more efficient than the 1990s conventional position, and less efficient than the modern conventional position. Obree however noted that the discomfort of the \"crouch\" position takes a lot of energy out of the rider through holding the hands and shoulders in place, whilst the \"Superman\" position was much more manageable.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/latest-news/graeme-obree-old-faithful-bike-put-test-wind-tunnel-heres-373769|title=Graeme Obree and his Old Faithful bike put to the test in a wind tunnel: Here\u2019s how they did |last=Hutchinson |first=Michael Hutchinson|author-link=Michael Hutchinson (cyclist) |date=21 March 2018 |website=[[Cycling Weekly]]|access-date=26 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Other achievements===\nObree was [[individual pursuit]] world champion in 1993 and 1995. He broke the British 10-mile [[individual time trial]] record in 1993, won the [[Cycling Time Trials|RTTC]] 50-mile championship the same year (a record 1h 39m 1s), and won the 25-mile championship in 1996. In 1997 he joined forces with coach Joe Beer and clocked 18m 36s in a 10-mile time trial (V718 Hull) and next day won the [[British Cycling Federation]] 25-mile championship - this was part of building towards an hour record attempt that was to be eventually shelved.\n\nThe writer Peter Bryan, of ''[[The Times]]'', said:\n\n<blockquote>''To see Obree in full flight, shoulders hunched and elbows tucked into his ribs, is a memorable sight. His face contorted with pain illustrates the effort he is putting in. And yet, not too many minutes after he has finished a ride the champion is sufficiently relaxed to talk with a queue of pressmen.<ref name=\"PCi\" /></blockquote>\n\n===Professional career===\nObree rode his hour records as an amateur. He took a professional licence after winning his first world championship, telling Bryan: \"I reckon I can make more money on the bike than I get from unemployment benefit.\"<ref name=\"PCi\" />\n\nHe joined [[Le Groupement (cycling team)|Le Groupement]], a French team but did not attend a meeting in [[Les Carroz d'Ar\u00e2ches]] ([[:fr:Les Carroz d'Ar\u00e2ches|fr]])<ref name=\"CW19Aug95\" /> and was fired for \"lack of professionalism.\"<ref name=\"CWsacked\">{{cite magazine| title=Obree sacked by French team| magazine=Cycling Weekly| location=UK|date=January 1995}}</ref> Obree had been racing in Florida when the team first met. But he was on holiday there when the team met again for publicity photographs. He got to the next get-together but flew to Paris instead of [[Lille]], where the meeting was held.<ref name=\"CWsacked\" />\n\nThe team manager, Patrick Valcke, said:\n\n:\"If a rider has that attitude, it's best to stop working together as soon as possible. We paid for his tickets [to fly from [[Glasgow]] to [[Geneva]]] and he didn't even turn up, didn't even phone to explain why he was not coming. He said that he did not want to leave his family so soon after the death of his brother (''see below'') but he could have phoned to tell us that. I don't want any more to do with him.\"<ref name=\"CWsacked\" />\n\nObree said: \"I was too ill to attend the get-together and had no success when I attempted to contact team officials on 1 January. My wife, Anne, who is a nurse, insisted I was not well enough to travel to France.\"<ref name=\"CW19Aug95\" /><ref name=\"CWsacked\" />\n\nThe Le Groupement team fell apart after a short time, when the sponsoring company was involved in scandal, with accusations that it was nothing but a pyramid selling scheme. Some of the team members claimed that they were owed money, and their wages had not been paid.\n\n===Attitude to doping===\nObree said of his short professional career:\n\n:\"I still feel I was robbed of part of my career. I was signed up to ride in the prologue of the Tour back in 1995, but it was made very obvious to me I would have to take drugs. I said no, no way, and I was sacked by my team. So there I was, 11 years later, sitting there waiting for the Tour cyclists to come by, and something welled up in me. I feel I was robbed by a lot of these bastards taking drugs. I also hate the way that people think anyone who has ever achieved anything on a bike must have been taking drugs. I was surprised how resentful I felt when I was in Paris. It had obviously been simmering away in there for years. That's something new I'll have to talk to my therapist about.\"<ref name=\"Indy06\" />\n\nIn 1996, he told the magazine ''[[L'\u00c9quipe]]'':\n\n:\"In my opinion, 99 percent of riders at \u00e9lite level take [[Erythropoietin|EPO]] or a similar drug, not particularly to dope themselves but to be at the same level as the others. And that's rather sad.\"<ref>L'Equipe Magazine, France 19 October 1996</ref><ref group=\"n\">\"A mon avis, 99% des coureurs de l'\u00e9lite prennent aujourd'hui de l'EPO ou une drogue similaire. Pas forc\u00e9ment pour se doper, mais pour \u00eatre au m\u00eame niveau que les autres. Et c'est plut\u00f4t navrant.\"</ref>\n\nHis web site says:\n\n:\"AND by the way, I never took drugs to improve my performance at any time as has been happening in the sport for a long time. I will be willing to stick my finger into a polygraph test if anyone with big media pull wants to take issue. In other words, if you buy a signed poster now it will not be tarnished later.\"<ref>{{Official website|http://www.obree.com/}}</ref>\n\n=== Further suicide attempt ===\nObree's brother, Gordon,<!-- his only sibling? --> died in a car crash in October 1994,<ref name=\"BikebizJan02\" /> and Graeme Obree again slid in and out of depression. In 2001 he was found unconscious at Bellsland Farm in [[Kilmaurs]], 12&nbsp;km from his Ayrshire home.

In May 2005, he crashed in the rain in the national 10-mile time trial championship near [[Nantwich]] in Cheshire.

His younger brothers were [[Arthur Vivian]] (who would become an industrialist and MP), [[Richard Glynn Vivian]] (afterwards an art collector and philanthropist) and Graham Vivian. His uncle was [[Richard Hussey Vivian]], first baron Vivian.<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Vivian, Henry Hussey}}</ref> He was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] and studied metallurgy in Germany and France from 1838 before entering Trinity College, [[Cambridge]] in 1839.<ref>{{acad|id=VVN838HH|name=Vivian, Henry Hussey}}</ref>\n\nAfter two years he became manager of the [[Liverpool]] branch of the copper-smelting business founded by his grandfather, [[Vivian & Sons]].  Three years later he became a partner of the firm before coming to Swansea to manage the [[Hafod]] Works during the last ten years of his father's life (1845\u20131855).  He developed a range of by-products from copper-smelting and diversified into other metallurgical activities.

However, most buyers chose an optional 1.9&nbsp;L [[Opel cam-in-head engine|camshaft in head]] engine, which produced 102&nbsp;hp (SAE) at 5200 to 5400&nbsp;rpm. Some of the early 1968 models also came with a slightly higher compression \"H\" code cylinder head. In 1971, due to emissions regulations, Opel reduced the [[compression ratio]] of the 1.9&nbsp;L engine used in the US and output fell to 83&nbsp;hp (SAE). There was also a GT/J model, which was a less expensive version of the 1900-engined GT which was sold only in Europe. Standard transmission was a manual four-speed. A three-speed automatic was available with the 1.9&nbsp;L engine. The model run of the Opel GT was from 1968 to 1973.\n\nThe Opel GT uses a steel unibody and a [[Mid-engine design#FMR layout \u2013 Front Mid-engine / Rear-wheel drive|front mid-engined, rear-wheel drive]] layout. The engine is mounted far back in the chassis to improve weight distribution. Front [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] consists of upper [[Control arm|A-arms]] and a lower transverse leaf spring \u2014 aside from the Opel's styling, the unusual use of a transverse leaf-spring in the suspension was another remarkable commonality with Chevrolet's Corvette. A live axle and coil springs are used in the rear. The power-assisted braking system uses discs in the front, drums in the rear. Steering is unassisted.\n\nOne unusual feature of the Opel GT is the operation of the [[Hidden headlamps|pop-up up and down headlights]]. They are manually operated, by way of a large lever along the center console next to the shifter. Unlike most pop-up headlights, they both rotate in the same direction (counterclockwise from inside the car) about a longitudinal axis.\n\nDesigned by Opel stylist Erhard Schnell,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://opelpost.com/06/2014/opel-design-studio-first-of-its-kind-in-europe/ |title= Opel GT designend by Stylist Erhard Schnell}}</ref> the GT is a [[fastback]], that has neither an externally accessible trunk nor a conventional [[hatchback]]. There is a parcel shelf behind the seats that can only be accessed through the main doors. Behind the parcel shelf is a fold-up panel that conceals a spare tire and jack.\n\nDuring 1968 to 1973, a total of 103,463 cars were sold. The most [[collectible]] GTs are probably the first few hundred cars hand-assembled in 1968 and the 1968\u20131970 models with the 1.1&nbsp;L engine, which totaled 3,573 cars. Of the later cars, 10,760 were the cheaper model (GT/J), which lacked nearly all chrome parts and offered fewer standard features. In some markets, items like a [[limited slip differential]], front and rear anti-sway bars, heated rear window, and engine bay light were standard, although most cars were shipped without them.\n\nIn North America, the GT was sold at Buick dealerships. Reasons for ending production were the need to redesign the car to remain competitive with up-and-coming sports models, such as the Datsun 240Z, as well as the termination of [[Brissonneau and Lotz]]' bodybuilding contract.

However, most buyers chose an optional 1.9&nbsp;L [[Opel cam-in-head engine|camshaft in head]] engine, which produced 102&nbsp;hp (SAE) at 5200 to 5400&nbsp;rpm. Some of the early 1968 models also came with a slightly higher compression \"H\" code cylinder head. In 1971, due to emissions regulations, Opel reduced the [[compression ratio]] of the 1.9&nbsp;L engine used in the US and output fell to 83&nbsp;hp (SAE). There was also a GT/J model, which was a less expensive version of the 1900-engined GT which was sold only in Europe. Standard transmission was a manual four-speed. A three-speed automatic was available with the 1.9&nbsp;L engine. The model run of the Opel GT was from 1968 to 1973.\n\nThe Opel GT uses a steel unibody and a [[Mid-engine design#FMR layout \u2013 Front Mid-engine / Rear-wheel drive|front mid-engined, rear-wheel drive]] layout. The engine is mounted far back in the chassis to improve weight distribution. Front [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] consists of upper [[Control arm|A-arms]] and a lower transverse leaf spring \u2014 aside from the Opel's styling, the unusual use of a transverse leaf-spring in the suspension was another remarkable commonality with Chevrolet's Corvette. A live axle and coil springs are used in the rear. The power-assisted braking system uses discs in the front, drums in the rear. Steering is unassisted.\n\nOne unusual feature of the Opel GT is the operation of the [[Hidden headlamps|pop-up up and down headlights]]. They are manually operated, by way of a large lever along the center console next to the shifter. Unlike most pop-up headlights, they both rotate in the same direction (counterclockwise from inside the car) about a longitudinal axis.\n\nDesigned by Opel stylist Erhard Schnell,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://opelpost.com/06/2014/opel-design-studio-first-of-its-kind-in-europe/ |title= Opel GT designend by Stylist Erhard Schnell}}</ref> the GT is a [[fastback]], that has neither an externally accessible trunk nor a conventional [[hatchback]]. There is a parcel shelf behind the seats that can only be accessed through the main doors. Behind the parcel shelf is a fold-up panel that conceals a spare tire and jack.\n\nDuring 1968 to 1973, a total of 103,463 cars were sold. The most [[collectible]] GTs are probably the first few hundred cars hand-assembled in 1968 and the 1968\u20131970 models with the 1.1&nbsp;L engine, which totaled 3,573 cars. Of the later cars, 10,760 were the cheaper model (GT/J), which lacked nearly all chrome parts and offered fewer standard features. In some markets, items like a [[limited slip differential]], front and rear anti-sway bars, heated rear window, and engine bay light were standard, although most cars were shipped without them.\n\nIn North America, the GT was sold at Buick dealerships. Reasons for ending production were the need to redesign the car to remain competitive with up-and-coming sports models, such as the Datsun 240Z, as well as the termination of [[Brissonneau and Lotz]]' bodybuilding contract.  Unusually for the period, there was no [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] equivalent model to the GT sold in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Opel GT was also used by Italian coachbuilder [[Sergio Coggiola]] to create the '''Opel Sylvia GT''', an angular design of the folded-paper school.
