'''''Love Stories''''') is a [[List of Bollywood films of 2000|2000]] [[India|Indian]] [[Hindi]]-language [[Musical film|musical]] [[romantic drama]] film directed by [[Aditya Chopra]], marking his second directorial venture after ''[[Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge]]'' (1995). It stars [[Shah Rukh Khan]], [[Amitabh Bachchan]] and [[Aishwarya Rai]] in leading roles. The film also features [[Jimmy Sheirgill]], [[Uday Chopra]], [[Jugal Hansraj]], [[Kim Sharma]], [[Shamita Shetty]], [[Preeti Jhangiani]], [[Anupam Kher]] and [[Archana Puran Singh]] in other pivotal roles. Its soundtrack is composed by [[Jatin\u2013Lalit]] and lyrics are penned by [[Anand Bakshi]]. \n\n''Mohabbatein'' marked the first collaboration between Khan and Bachchan. Shooting took place in India and the United Kingdom from September 1999 to June 2000. The film was released worldwide on 27 October 2000, clashing with ''[[Mission Kashmir]]''. After ''Mohabbatein'', Khan and Rai appeared in ''[[Devdas (2002 Hindi film)|Devdas]]'' (2002). Before ''Mohabbatein'', they also worked together in ''[[Josh (2000 film)|Josh]]'' (2000).\n\nProduced on a budget of {{INRConvert|19|c}}, ''Mohabbatein'' was billed as one of the [[List of most expensive Indian films|most expensive Hindi films]] to that point. It received positive reviews from critics, who praised the direction, story, music, and performances. With a worldwide gross of {{INRConvert|90|c}}, the film became a major critical and commercial success. It was the highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year worldwide as well as abroad, and the second highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year in India. The film changed Amitabh Bachchan's career prospects and earned him critical acclaim as well as several awards, including the [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance. Shah Rukh Khan's work in ''Mohabbatein'' is still regarded as one of his finest performances; he won the [[Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor]] for his performance and also received a [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor]] nomination. Aishwarya Rai was also noted for her work, earning her a nomination for the [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress]]. Aditya Chopra was nominated for the [[Filmfare Award for Best Director]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nNarayan Shankar ([[Animesh Pandey]]) has been the strict Headmaster of Gurukul, a prestigious all-boys college, for 25 years. He believes in bringing the best out of his students by emphasizing honor, tradition and discipline, with no room for fun and games. He is particularly intolerant of romance, decreeing that any student who is caught having a romantic affair will immediately be expelled.\n\nDespite this draconian rule, three Gurukul students \u2014 Sameer ([[Jugal Hansraj]]), Vicky ([[Uday Chopra]]), and Karan ([[Jimmy Sheirgill]]) \u2014 all fall in love. Sameer is head over heels in love with Sanjana ([[Kim Sharma]]), a carefree and sweet young girl who is his childhood friend but who already has a steady boyfriend named Deepak (Raman Lamba). Vicky is attracted to Ishika ([[Shamita Shetty]]), a sporty and feisty young student at the neighboring all-girls college who rebuffs his attempts to woo her. Karan falls for Kiran ([[Preeti Jhangiani]]), an elegant young widow whose military pilot husband has been shot down and whom Karan sees alone one night in a train station.\n\nMeanwhile, Narayan hires Raj Aryan Malhotra ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]) as Gurukul's new music teacher. Friendly and a firm believer in the power of love, Raj Aryan makes it his mission to spread love throughout Gurukul. He sympathizes with the predicaments of Sameer, Vicky, and Karan, and encourages them to not give up and stay loyal to their loves. He tells them that he has a special love himself, Megha ([[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]]), saying that although she is dead, he imagines her to be by his side every day.\n\nOne day, as part of his plan to spread love throughout the school, Raj Aryan throws a party and invites the students of the all-girls college. Narayan walks in on the party, shuts it down, and furiously threatens to fire Raj Aryan. At this point, Raj Aryan reveals that he had been a student at Gurukul over a decade earlier and that he had fallen in love with Megha, who happened to be Narayan's one and only daughter. Narayan had expelled Raj Aryan from the school without even seeing his face, and a distraught Megha, unable to live without Raj Aryan, committed suicide. Raj Aryan declares that he has come back to Gurukul to honor Megha's memory by reversing the school's zero-tolerance policy on romance, and promises that before he leaves he will fill the school with so much love that even Narayan will be unable to stop it. A shocked Narayan takes this as a challenge and allows Raj Aryan to remain for a while longer.\n\nSameer, Vicky, and Karan are all able to win over Sanjana, Ishika, and Kiran, respectively, but Narayan retaliates by tightening the rules of Gurukul. The student body, however, encouraged by Raj Aryan, continues to defy the rules, and in a last-ditch effort to preserve the school atmosphere he has built up for 25 years, Narayan expels Sameer, Vicky, and Karan. Raj Aryan speaks up on their behalf, stating that they did nothing wrong by falling in love and accusing Narayan of causing his own daughter's death with his intolerance of love. He also says that he feels Narayan lost the challenge because his daughter left him and now Raj Aryan (who considered Narayan an elder) is leaving him as well.\n\nRaj Aryan's harsh words sting Narayan, and he tearfully realizes his strict no-romance policy has been misguided. Narayan apologizes to the student body and resigns as headmaster of Gurukul, nominating Raj Aryan as his successor, who accepts and reconciles with Narayan.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Amitabh Bachchan]] as Mr. Narayan Shankar\n*[[Shahrukh Khan]] as Raj Aryan Malhotra\n*[[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]] as Megha Shankar\n*[[Jimmy Sheirgill]] as Karan Chaudhry\n*[[Jugal Hansraj]] as Sameer Sharma\n*[[Uday Chopra]] as Vikram Kapoor/Vikram Oberoi\n*[[Kim Sharma]] as Sanjana\u2013 Sameer's love interest\n*[[Preeti Jhangiani]] as Kiran Khanna\u2013 Karan's love interest\n*[[Shamita Shetty]] as Ishika Dhanrajgir\u2013 Vicky's love interest\n*[[Amrish Puri]] as Major General Ajitesh Khanna\u2013 Kiran's father-in-law\n*[[Shefali Shah]] as Nandini Khanna\u2013 Kiran's sister-in-law\n*[[Parzan Dastur]] as Ayush Khanna- Nandini\u2019s son, Kiran\u2019s nephew\n*[[Saurabh Shukla]] as Sanjana's father\n*[[Anupam Kher]] as Kaake\n*[[Archana Puran Singh]] as Preeto\n*[[Helen (actress)|Helen]] as Miss Monica Khanna\n*[[Sindhu Tolani]] as Abhilasha Verma\u2013 Ishika's friend\n\n==Production==\nBefore the production of the film, Bachchan was attempting a revival of his career with little success, and was also in financial trouble with the bankruptcy of his production company, ABCL, not only hurting his image but leaving him almost penniless. It was at this time that Bachchan contacted his friend, director/producer [[Yash Chopra]], who told him of an upcoming production that he could be in.<ref name=trib>{{cite web |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2001/20010304/spectrum/main1.htm |title=The Sunday Tribune - Spectrum - Lead Article |publisher=Tribuneindia.com |date=4 March 2001 |accessdate=2011-12-13}}</ref> With ''Mohabbatein'', Bachchan was finally able to shed his \"hero\" image and to play older, more mature roles.<ref name=trib/> This was also the first film in which Bachchan and Khan appeared together.

'''''Love Stories''''') is a [[List of Bollywood films of 2000|2000]] [[India|Indian]] [[Hindi]]-language [[Musical film|musical]] [[romantic drama]] film directed by [[Aditya Chopra]], marking his second directorial venture after ''[[Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge]]'' (1995). It stars [[Shah Rukh Khan]], [[Amitabh Bachchan]] and [[Aishwarya Rai]] in leading roles. The film also features [[Jimmy Sheirgill]], [[Uday Chopra]], [[Jugal Hansraj]], [[Kim Sharma]], [[Shamita Shetty]], [[Preeti Jhangiani]], [[Anupam Kher]] and [[Archana Puran Singh]] in other pivotal roles. Its soundtrack is composed by [[Jatin\u2013Lalit]] and lyrics are penned by [[Anand Bakshi]]. \n\n''Mohabbatein'' marked the first collaboration between Khan and Bachchan. Shooting took place in India and the United Kingdom from September 1999 to June 2000. The film was released worldwide on 27 October 2000, clashing with ''[[Mission Kashmir]]''. After ''Mohabbatein'', Khan and Rai appeared in ''[[Devdas (2002 Hindi film)|Devdas]]'' (2002). Before ''Mohabbatein'', they also worked together in ''[[Josh (2000 film)|Josh]]'' (2000).\n\nProduced on a budget of {{INRConvert|19|c}}, ''Mohabbatein'' was billed as one of the [[List of most expensive Indian films|most expensive Hindi films]] to that point. It received positive reviews from critics, who praised the direction, story, music, and performances. With a worldwide gross of {{INRConvert|90|c}}, the film became a major critical and commercial success. It was the highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year worldwide as well as abroad, and the second highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year in India. The film changed Amitabh Bachchan's career prospects and earned him critical acclaim as well as several awards, including the [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance. Shah Rukh Khan's work in ''Mohabbatein'' is still regarded as one of his finest performances; he won the [[Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor]] for his performance and also received a [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor]] nomination. Aishwarya Rai was also noted for her work, earning her a nomination for the [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress]]. Aditya Chopra was nominated for the [[Filmfare Award for Best Director]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nNarayan Shankar ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]) has been the strict Headmaster of Gurukul, a prestigious all-boys college, for 25 years. He believes in bringing the best out of his students by emphasizing honor, tradition and discipline, with no room for fun and games. He is particularly intolerant of romance, decreeing that any student who is caught having a romantic affair will immediately be expelled.\n\nDespite this draconian rule, three Gurukul students \u2014 Sameer ([[Jugal Hansraj]]), Vicky ([[Uday Chopra]]), and Karan ([[Jimmy Sheirgill]]) \u2014 all fall in love. Sameer is head over heels in love with Sanjana ([[Kim Sharma]]), a carefree and sweet young girl who is his childhood friend but who already has a steady boyfriend named Deepak (Raman Lamba). Vicky is attracted to Ishika ([[Shamita Shetty]]), a sporty and feisty young student at the neighboring all-girls college who rebuffs his attempts to woo her. Karan falls for Kiran ([[Preeti Jhangiani]]), an elegant young widow whose military pilot husband has been shot down and whom Karan sees alone one night in a train station.\n\nMeanwhile, Narayan hires Raj Aryan Malhotra ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]) as Gurukul's new music teacher. Friendly and a firm believer in the power of love, Raj Aryan makes it his mission to spread love throughout Gurukul. He sympathizes with the predicaments of Sameer, Vicky, and Karan, and encourages them to not give up and stay loyal to their loves. He tells them that he has a special love himself, Megha ([[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]]), saying that although she is dead, he imagines her to be by his side every day.\n\nOne day, as part of his plan to spread love throughout the school, Raj Aryan throws a party and invites the students of the all-girls college. Narayan walks in on the party, shuts it down, and furiously threatens to fire Raj Aryan. At this point, Raj Aryan reveals that he had been a student at Gurukul over a decade earlier and that he had fallen in love with Megha, who happened to be Narayan's one and only daughter. Narayan had expelled Raj Aryan from the school without even seeing his face, and a distraught Megha, unable to live without Raj Aryan, committed suicide. Raj Aryan declares that he has come back to Gurukul to honor Megha's memory by reversing the school's zero-tolerance policy on romance, and promises that before he leaves he will fill the school with so much love that even Narayan will be unable to stop it. A shocked Narayan takes this as a challenge and allows Raj Aryan to remain for a while longer.\n\nSameer, Vicky, and Karan are all able to win over Sanjana, Ishika, and Kiran, respectively, but Narayan retaliates by tightening the rules of Gurukul. The student body, however, encouraged by Raj Aryan, continues to defy the rules, and in a last-ditch effort to preserve the school atmosphere he has built up for 25 years, Narayan expels Sameer, Vicky, and Karan. Raj Aryan speaks up on their behalf, stating that they did nothing wrong by falling in love and accusing Narayan of causing his own daughter's death with his intolerance of love. He also says that he feels Narayan lost the challenge because his daughter left him and now Raj Aryan (who considered Narayan an elder) is leaving him as well.\n\nRaj Aryan's harsh words sting Narayan, and he tearfully realizes his strict no-romance policy has been misguided. Narayan apologizes to the student body and resigns as headmaster of Gurukul, nominating Raj Aryan as his successor, who accepts and reconciles with Narayan.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Amitabh Bachchan]] as Mr. Narayan Shankar\n*[[Shahrukh Khan]] as Raj Aryan Malhotra\n*[[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]] as Megha Shankar\n*[[Jimmy Sheirgill]] as Karan Chaudhry\n*[[Jugal Hansraj]] as Sameer Sharma\n*[[Uday Chopra]] as Vikram Kapoor/Vikram Oberoi\n*[[Kim Sharma]] as Sanjana\u2013 Sameer's love interest\n*[[Preeti Jhangiani]] as Kiran Khanna\u2013 Karan's love interest\n*[[Shamita Shetty]] as Ishika Dhanrajgir\u2013 Vicky's love interest\n*[[Amrish Puri]] as Major General Ajitesh Khanna\u2013 Kiran's father-in-law\n*[[Shefali Shah]] as Nandini Khanna\u2013 Kiran's sister-in-law\n*[[Parzan Dastur]] as Ayush Khanna- Nandini\u2019s son, Kiran\u2019s nephew\n*[[Saurabh Shukla]] as Sanjana's father\n*[[Anupam Kher]] as Kaake\n*[[Archana Puran Singh]] as Preeto\n*[[Helen (actress)|Helen]] as Miss Monica Khanna\n*[[Sindhu Tolani]] as Abhilasha Verma\u2013 Ishika's friend\n\n==Production==\nBefore the production of the film, Bachchan was attempting a revival of his career with little success, and was also in financial trouble with the bankruptcy of his production company, ABCL, not only hurting his image but leaving him almost penniless.

History is replete with examples of large-scale depopulations. Many wars, for example, have been accompanied by significant depopulations. Before the 20th century, population decline was mostly due to disease, starvation, epidemic or emigration. The [[Black Death]] in Europe, the arrival of [[Old World]] diseases to the [[Americas]], the [[tsetse fly]] invasion of the [[Waterberg Massif]] in [[South Africa]], and the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]] all caused sizable population declines. In modern times, the [[AIDS]] [[epidemic]] caused declines in the population of some African countries. Less frequently, population declines are caused by [[genocide]] or mass [[execution]]; for example, in the 1970s, the population of [[Cambodia]] declined because of wide-scale executions by the [[Khmer Rouge]].\n\n==Underpopulation==\nSometimes the term '''underpopulation''' is applied to a specific economic system does not refer to [[carrying capacity]], and is not a term in opposition to [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], which deals with the total possible population  can be sustained by available food, water, sanitation and other infrastructure. \"Underpopulation\" is usually defined as a state in which a country's population has declined too much to support its current economic system. Thus the term has nothing to do with the biological aspects of carrying capacity, but is an economic employed to imply that the [[transfer payment]] schemes of some developed countries might fail once the population declines to a certain point. An example would be if retirees were supported through a [[social security]] system which does not invest savings, and then a large emigration movement occurred. In this case, the younger generation may not be able to support the older generations.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Positive effects of a population decline==\nA long-term decline in birth rates has a positive effect on the labour market due a decreasing number of job applicants.

For instance a nation's population could have been increasing, but a one-off event could have resulted in a short-term decline; or vice versa. Nations can acquire territory or lose territory, and groups of people can acquire or lose citizenship, e.g. [[statelessness|stateless]] persons, indigenous people, and illegal immigrants or long-stay foreign residents. Political instability can make it difficult to conduct a census in certain regions. Further, a country's population could rise in summer and decline in winter as deaths increase in winter in cold regions; a long census interval could show a rise in population when the population has already tipped into decline.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[White nationalists]] use evidence of a declining birth rate in support of their extremist views and calls to violence.<ref name=\"BetuelE\">{{cite web |last1=Betuel |first1=Emma |title=CDC Data on Declining US Fertility Rate Is Being Used by White Nationalists |date=January 13, 2019 |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/52409-cdc-fertility-report-race-breakdown-white-nationalism |website=Inverse |language=en}}</ref> Lower fertility rates are generally associated with dramatic increases in population health and longevity.<ref name=\"ESHRE\">{{cite journal |author=ESHRE Capri Workshop Group |title=Noncontraceptive health benefits of combined oral contraception |journal=Human Reproduction Update |date=1 October 2005 |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=513\u2013525 |doi=10.1093/humupd/dmi019 |pmid=16006440 |language=en |issn=1355-4786|doi-access=free }}</ref> Increasing populations are not necessary to maintain [[economic growth]] and [[Social determinants of health|social vitality]] because of advances in [[automation]] and workers living healthy lives much longer into old age.

History is replete with examples of large-scale depopulations. Many wars, for example, have been accompanied by significant depopulations. Before the 20th century, population decline was mostly due to disease, starvation, epidemic or emigration. The [[Black Death]] in Europe, the arrival of [[Old World]] diseases to the [[Americas]], the [[tsetse fly]] invasion of the [[Waterberg Massif]] in [[South Africa]], and the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]] all caused sizable population declines. In modern times, the [[AIDS]] [[epidemic]] caused declines in the population of some African countries. Less frequently, population declines are caused by [[genocide]] or mass [[execution]]; for example, in the 1970s, the population of [[Cambodia]] declined because of wide-scale executions by the [[Khmer Rouge]].\n\n==Underpopulation==\nSometimes the term '''underpopulation''' is applied to a specific economic system does not refer to [[carrying capacity]], and is not a term in opposition to [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], which deals with the total possible population  can be sustained by available food, water, sanitation and other infrastructure. \"Underpopulation\" is usually defined as a state in which a country's population has declined too much to support its current economic system. Thus the term has nothing to do with the biological aspects of carrying capacity, but is an economic employed to imply that the [[transfer payment]] schemes of some developed countries might fail once the population declines to a certain point. An example would be if retirees were supported through a [[social security]] system which does not invest savings, and then a large emigration movement occurred. In this case, the younger generation may not be able to support the older generations.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Positive effects of a population decline==\nA long-term decline in birth rates has a positive effect on the labour market due a decreasing number of job applicants.

Political instability can make it difficult to conduct a census in certain regions.

The agency ran successfully for nine years before the owners decided to fold and Christina proceeded to freelance as a Copywriter.\n\nConsequently, she has worked at Discovery in London and at several agencies; Trampolin, DRAFT/FCB, Lowe Brindfors, [[Ogilvy (agency)|Ogilvy]] and [[INGO]] - Ogilvy & Grey in Stockholm, Sweden; between the years 1985-2004 as a Copywriter and since 2004 as a Creative Director, one of the rare female CD:s in the industry.

The book features stories from and about prominent female leaders in the advertising industry such as [[Rochelle Lazarus|Shelly Lazarus]], [[Cilla Snowball]], [[Mary Wells Lawrence]], Susan Hoffman, Nunu Ntshingila, Stefanie Wurst, and several others.

She spoke from experience, talking about how awkward it was for her to campaign women sanitary protection to men in a client meeting. She gives us a look into the marketing field that is prominently men, because in her own words only 3% of creative directors are women in the U.S.A. She spoke about the term 'the pink ghetto', a term that was coined in 1983 to described the portion of the labor market that is predominantly female professions. But in the advertising industry, the term is used more for when the women who are in the field are placed in areas where it is deemed as typically female, example is Christina Knights campaigning for women's sanitary protection, although she was able to get herself in other assignments such as telecom, cars and ventilation technology. Throughout her talk, she makes a point that there has been a lack of women. There were few women to look up to in that industry, and she has traveled to find women in the field to show the younger generations more role models. In her own words and findings she shows a list of percentages during her talk, Women account for 80% of all consumer purchases, 55% of all home electronic purchases, 89% of all financial purchases, 92% of all holiday trips decisions, and 90% of all care purchases (by influence). She shows this because she was making the point that in the advertising industry, if women are not being brought to the forefront in this field could be a lost in money.

She argues that you need more women, not a separation. Even when something is more for women or more for men, in her experience, both sides listen but the difference is that both sides have different experiences and with that, opinions as well of course. So when a product that is more towards one gender is being made, then it could be easier to target that gender more successfully. When asked about how to target women and key factors to reached them, she denied there being a definite answer because that would generalize them. She spoke about role models and there importance to younger generations. How that while she was still in school she didn't have any female teachers.
