The extended play was released in two physical versions, named after the two singles and contained six tracks which introduced both the group's [[Red Velvet (group)#Artistry|\"Red\" and \"Velvet\" sonic concept]]. The duality was further demonstrated by its two [[Single (music)|singles]] (marketed as double title tracks), \"[[Automatic (Red Velvet song)|Automatic]]\" and \"[[Ice Cream Cake (Red Velvet song)|Ice Cream Cake]]\", with the latter becoming the group's breakthrough commercial success.

The EP also attained commercial success, becoming Red Velvet's first chart-topper on the [[Gaon Album Chart]] in South Korea and number two on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' World Albums Chart for the first time, while peaking at number twenty-four on ''Billboard''<nowiki/>'s [[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers Albums chart]].

Yeri was then introduced by [[S.M.

Produced by [[Hayley Aitken]] and producing team Trinity Music, the song original title was \"Ice Cream Truck\" before the lyrics was rewritten in Korean by songwriter Jo Yoon-kyung and Kim Dong-hyun. In addition, it also features \"haunted\" [[harmony]] which can be heard during the intro of the song, while being accompanied by the sound of a [[music box]]. The lyrics tell the excitement of a girl being attracted to her boyfriend, using \"ice cream cake\" as a [[metaphor]] to the girl's feelings. Along with the electro-pop \"Stupid Cupid\" and the bright, poppy \"Take It Slow\", the three tracks represented the \"Red\" concept, with \"Stupid Cupid\" offers a different \"aura\" through the electric riffs, and \"Take It Slow\" highlights the group's harmonization and soft vocals that recalls \"the perfection\" from fellow labelmate [[Girls' Generation-TTS]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://izm.co.kr/contentRead.asp?idx=26679&bigcateidx=1&subcateidx=3&view_tp=1&view_sort=1|title=Neo Music Communication IZM|website=izm.co.kr |url-status=live |accessdate=2020-04-29}}</ref>{{Listen|filename=Automatic (song sample).ogg|title=\"Automatic\"|format=[[Ogg]]|pos=right|description=\"Automatic\" is a [[contemporary R&B]] song with influence from [[neo soul]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://izm.co.kr/contentRead.asp?idx=26679&bigcateidx=1&subcateidx=3&view_tp=1&view_sort=1|first=Do-hyun|last=Kim|title=Ice Cream Cake - 2015 - Red Velvet|website=izm.co.kr|publisher=IZM |url-status=live ||accessdate=2020-04-29}}</ref> The song represents the \"Velvet\" sonic concept of the group.}}On the other hand, the second track \"Automatic\" is \"a surely implemented R&B track\" with influence from neo soul, thus represents the \"Velvet\" sonic concept. Produced by [[Deekay|Daniel \"Obi\" Klein]] and British singer-songwriter [[Charli Taft]], the song marks the first work from the duo with Red Velvet and they would later participate in the group's upcoming releases. Lyrically, the song tells how \"natural\" and \"automatic\" the senses and feelings of a girl come just by the touch of her lover, with the opening monologue \"How do you like this beat?/Natural and automatic for you.\" Charli Taft also co-produced the third track \"Something Kinda Crazy\", a modern-R&B track with synth-pop influence that sings about the starstruck feelings of a girl when she falls in a relationship. The lyrics was written by songwriter [[Kenzie (songwriter)|Kenzie]], with [[American]] [[Record producer|producer]] [[Teddy Riley]] joined in the production. The closing track \"Candy\" is a \"smoothing, popping\" R&B track that sings about the wishes of a long-lasting relationship. \n\n== Promotion ==\nSM Entertainment announced a program where in the group will be promoting their new album, called ''Ice Cream TV''.

The extended play was released in two physical versions, named after the two singles and contained six tracks which introduced both the group's [[Red Velvet (group)#Artistry|\"Red\" and \"Velvet\" sonic concept]]. The duality was further demonstrated by its two [[Single (music)|singles]] (marketed as double title tracks), \"[[Automatic (Red Velvet song)|Automatic]]\" and \"[[Ice Cream Cake (Red Velvet song)|Ice Cream Cake]]\", with the latter becoming the group's breakthrough commercial success. S.M. founder Lee Soo-man served as the EP's [[executive producer]], with [[Hayley Aitken]], Trinity Music, [[Deekay|Daniel \"Obi\" Klein]], [[Charli Taft]], [[Jam Factory]], [[Kenzie (songwriter)|Kenzie]], [[Teddy Riley]], [[Cha Cha Malone]], MonoTree and others contributed lyrics and production.\n\nUpon its release, ''Ice Cream Cake'' received positive reviews from music critics for its \"impressive effort\" of establishing the two sides of their musical identity. The EP also attained commercial success, becoming Red Velvet's first chart-topper on the [[Gaon Album Chart]] in South Korea and number two on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' World Albums Chart for the first time, while peaking at number twenty-four on ''Billboard''<nowiki/>'s [[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers Albums chart]]. It has since sold a cumulative sales of over 88,000 copies, as of September 2018.\n\n==Background and release==\n\n=== Background ===\nFollowing the end of \"Be Natural\" promotion in late October 2014, it was announced that Red Velvet would return with an [[extended play]], marking their first proper release since the group's debut in last August. In February 2015, Red Velvet was spotted filming in a [[desert]] just outside of [[Palmdale, California]] with then [[SM Rookies]]-member [[Yeri (singer)|Yeri]], with the then-rumored song title to be \"Blonde Girl\". Yeri was then introduced by [[S.M. Entertainment]] as the fifth member of Red Velvet through two videos uploaded on the label's [[YouTube]] channel on March 11 and March 12, which contained audio previews of then-unknown album track \"Somethin Kinda Crazy\".<ref>{{cite web |title=[Video] Red Velvet Welcomes New Member Yeri in Time for Comeback |last=Hong |first=Grace Danbi |website=enewsWorld |url=http://mwave.interest.me/enewsworld/en/article/88938/video-red-velvet-welcomes-new-member-yeri-in-time-for-comeback |accessdate=March 16, 2015 |date=March 11, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165837/http://mwave.interest.me/enewsworld/en/article/88938/video-red-velvet-welcomes-new-member-yeri-in-time-for-comeback |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On the same day, they revealed the title of the group's first album, ''Ice Cream Cake''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.mk.co.kr/news/headline/2015/232805 |accessdate=March 16, 2015 |website=MK News |date=March 11, 2015|title=\ub808\ub4dc\ubca8\ubcb3, \uc0c8 \uba64\ubc84 '\uc608\ub9ac' \ud569\ub958 5\uc778\uc870 \ubcc0\uc2e0\u202618\uc77c \ucef4\ubc31|language=ko}}</ref> On March 14, the music video for \"Automatic\" was released days prior to the EP's release, with title track \"Ice Cream Cake\" followed suit on March 16.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nate.com/view/20150315n05007 |accessdate=March 16, 2015 |author=Yoon Sang-geun |website=Nate |date=March 15, 2015|title=\ucef4\ubc31 \ub808\ub4dc\ubca8\ubcb3, \ub354\ube14 \ud0c0\uc774\ud2c0\uace1 \ud65c\ub3d9\u2026\ubba4\ube44 \uae30\uc2b5 \uacf5\uac1c|language=ko}}</ref> SM Entertainment confirmed that the group would be promoting both \"Ice Cream Cake\" and \"Automatic\".<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://sports.hankooki.com/lpage/entv/201503/sp20150315101948136690.htm |accessdate=March 16, 2015 |author=Lee Jong-hyun |website=Hankooki |date=March 15, 2015|title='\ucef4\ubc31' \ub808\ub4dc\ubca8\ubcb3, \ubc18\uc804 \ub9e4\ub825 \uc120\uc0ac!

Produced by [[Hayley Aitken]] and producing team Trinity Music, the song original title was \"Ice Cream Truck\" before the lyrics was rewritten in Korean by songwriter Jo Yoon-kyung and Kim Dong-hyun. In addition, it also features \"haunted\" [[harmony]] which can be heard during the intro of the song, while being accompanied by the sound of a [[music box]]. The lyrics tell the excitement of a girl being attracted to her boyfriend, using \"ice cream cake\" as a [[metaphor]] to the girl's feelings. Along with the electro-pop \"Stupid Cupid\" and the bright, poppy \"Take It Slow\", the three tracks represented the \"Red\" concept, with \"Stupid Cupid\" offers a different \"aura\" through the electric riffs, and \"Take It Slow\" highlights the group's harmonization and soft vocals that recalls \"the perfection\" from fellow labelmate [[Girls' Generation-TTS]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://izm.co.kr/contentRead.asp?idx=26679&bigcateidx=1&subcateidx=3&view_tp=1&view_sort=1|title=Neo Music Communication IZM|website=izm.co.kr |url-status=live |accessdate=2020-04-29}}</ref>{{Listen|filename=Automatic (song sample).ogg|title=\"Automatic\"|format=[[Ogg]]|pos=right|description=\"Automatic\" is a [[contemporary R&B]] song with influence from [[neo soul]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://izm.co.kr/contentRead.asp?idx=26679&bigcateidx=1&subcateidx=3&view_tp=1&view_sort=1|first=Do-hyun|last=Kim|title=Ice Cream Cake - 2015 - Red Velvet|website=izm.co.kr|publisher=IZM|accessdate=December 6, 2017}}</ref> The song represents the \"Velvet\" sonic concept of the group.}}On the other hand, the second track \"Automatic\" is \"a surely implemented R&B track\" with influence from neo soul, thus represents the \"Velvet\" sonic concept. Produced by [[Deekay|Daniel \"Obi\" Klein]] and British singer-songwriter [[Charli Taft]], the song marks the first work from the duo with Red Velvet and they would later participate in the group's upcoming releases. Lyrically, the song tells how \"natural\" and \"automatic\" the senses and feelings of a girl come just by the touch of her lover, with the opening monologue \"How do you like this beat?/Natural and automatic for you.\" Charli Taft also co-produced the third track \"Something Kinda Crazy\", a modern-R&B track with synth-pop influence that sings about the starstruck feelings of a girl when she falls in a relationship. The lyrics was written by songwriter [[Kenzie (songwriter)|Kenzie]], with [[American]] [[Record producer|producer]] [[Teddy Riley]] joined in the production. The closing track \"Candy\" is a \"smoothing, popping\" R&B track that sings about the wishes of a long-lasting relationship. \n\n== Promotion ==\nSM Entertainment announced a program where in the group will be promoting their new album, called ''Ice Cream TV''.

He was the ruling Duke of [[Wielu\u0144]] during 1313\u20131326, Duke of [[Niemodlin]] from 1313 and ruler over [[Prudnik]] from 1336 until his death.\n\nHe was the eldest son of Duke [[Bolko I of Opole]] by his wife Agnes, probably a daughter of Margrave [[Otto III, Margrave of Brandenburg|Otto III of Brandenburg]]. Boles\u0142aw was nicknamed \"the Elder\" or \"First-born\" (''Pierworodny'') in order to distinguish him from his younger brother, who, for unknown reasons, was also named Boles\u0142aw (Bolko).\n\n==Life==\nAfter his father's death in 1313, Boles\u0142aw inherited the Duchies of [[Wielu\u0144]] and [[Niemodlin]]. Until 1323, he exercised the guardianship on behalf of his younger brothers, then too youngs for rule by their own. His political career was strongly connected with the [[House of Luxembourg]], rulers of [[Bohemia]]. This alliance with the Bohemian Kingdom caused a war between him and [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high]], which ended with the loss of Wielu\u0144 in 1326.\n\nOn 18 February 1327, together with the other Silesian Dukes, Boles\u0142aw paid homage to [[John I of Bohemia|King John of Bohemia]] in [[Opawa]].

He was the ruling Duke of [[Wielu\u0144]] during 1313\u20131326, Duke of [[Niemodlin]] from 1313 and ruler over [[Prudnik]] from 1336 until his death.\n\nHe was the eldest son of Duke [[Bolko I of Opole]] by his wife Agnes, probably a daughter of Margrave [[Otto III, Margrave of Brandenburg|Otto III of Brandenburg]]. Boles\u0142aw was nicknamed \"the Elder\" or \"First-born\" (''Pierworodny'') in order to distinguish him from his younger brother, who, for unknown reasons, was also named Boles\u0142aw (Bolko).\n\n==Life==\nAfter his father's death in 1313, Boles\u0142aw inherited the Duchies of [[Wielu\u0144]] and [[Niemodlin]]. Until 1323, he exercised the guardianship on behalf of his younger brothers, then too youngs for rule by their own. His political career was strongly connected with the [[House of Luxembourg]], rulers of [[Bohemia]]. This alliance with the Bohemian Kingdom caused a war between him and [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high]], which ended with the loss of Wielu\u0144 in 1326.\n\nOn 18 February 1327, together with the other Silesian Dukes, Boles\u0142aw paid homage to [[John I of Bohemia|King John of Bohemia]] in [[Opawa]]. One year later (in 1328) in order to fulfill his new responsibilities as vassal of Bohemian, he took part in the Crusade against the pagan [[Lithuania]]. After returning from this expedition, Boles\u0142aw follow his sovereign to [[Prague]], where he spent much time.\n\nIn 1336, as a reward for his faithful services, the King authorized Boles\u0142aw to buy the town of [[Prudnik]] with the surroundings villages by the amount of 2,000 fines.\n\nIn 1355 Boles\u0142aw took part in the trip of [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles of Bohemia]] to [[Rome]], where the latter was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\nBoles\u0142aw died between 1362 and 1365.

The sketch was created by show writers Kenny Solms and [[Gail Parent]].<ref>{{cite interview |last=Burnett |first=Carol |subjectlink= |interviewer=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) |title=Featurette: Fabulous Firsts |url= |date= |work=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) }}</ref> ''The Carol Burnett Show'' introduced the series during its first season in 1967\u201368 and continued to air new installments for the remainder of its 11-season run, through its final season in 1977\u201378. However, the final installment of \"As the Stomach Turns\" would not air until September 8, 1979, on a different four-week summer series titled ''Carol Burnett & Company''. This was the only installment of \"As the Stomach Turns\" that did not air on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which had completed its run almost a year and a half earlier on March 29, 1978.\n\n==Premise==\nThe sketch's premise was to describe, in great detail, the problems of a woman in her 30s named Marion Clayton (played by [[Carol Burnett]]), who lived in the fictional town of Canoga Falls. The first installment aired on the 21st episode of the first season on February 12, 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0536556|title=The Carol Burnett Show (1967\u20131978) Episode #1.21 |author= IMDB|date=|website=|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}</ref> As introduced by [[Lyle Waggoner]], it was supposed to be the final episode of a 15-year long soap opera.<ref>{{cite episode |title=022 |series=The Carol Burnett Show |network=[[CBS]] |date=February 12, 1968}}</ref>\n\nThe sketch dealt with problems that were more likely to be seen on a soap opera than in real life, although many skits were inspired by popular television shows or movies. An example of the latter is a spoof of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' when Marion's niece Raven (played by guest [[Bernadette Peters]]) came to visit her and was possessed by a devil, Marion assumed, because Raven was such a nice girl normally. Otto Blackflag, the town exterminator, now styling himself as a freelance exorcist (played by [[Tim Conway]] and  using the same faux-Swedish dialect that he would use to play the character [[Mrs. Wiggins|Mr. Tudball]]) exorcised the demon from Raven's body. This same sort of plot was eventually done, in all seriousness, on ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' decades later.\n\nAnother movie parody saw Marion meet the bedraggled \"Richard Dryface,\" played by guest [[Steve Martin]] in a spoof of ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', complete with a grey, bulbous-headed alien played by Conway.\n\nThe sketch also touched on stereotypical aspects of production values in American soaps. Many times, Marion forgot what she wanted to say, reminiscent of the times when soap operas were broadcast live and actors routinely forgot their next line. Marion also answered the door either too soon or too late when someone rang her doorbell. Other times, she would miss the correct time to answer the phone, saying \"Hello\" before the sound effect came for it to ring. On live soap opera productions, these were big problems; due to the live nature of the show, they happened fairly frequently, and were subsequently spoofed at length on ''The Carol Burnett Show''.\n\nIn addition to the missed cues, the sketch was notorious for overusing loud and plangent [[Organ (music)|organ music]], a reference to a time when soap operas would have in-house organists play dramatic music as well as the show's theme song (when this skit first ran, organ music was still in wide use on the serials). Organ music was eventually discontinued in the mid-1970s, around the time ''The Carol Burnett Show'' wrapped up its run, so when the sketch is seen in syndication today, it brings back a sense of production technique that is now seen by many younger soap viewers as archaic and outdated.\n\nOne of the sketch's recurring characters is Marion's \"ne'er-do-well\" daughter (played by [[Vicki Lawrence]]) who arrives at the door holding a baby (a doll), usually says \"Don't you recognize me mother? I'm your daughter,\" then leaves after giving the baby to Marion who immediately stashes it in the umbrella stand.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref> This was a parody of the fact that traditional soap operas have little use for child characters, either dropping them from the plot line shortly after they are introduced or [[Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome|unnaturally aging]] them into adulthood or, more recently, into the teenage years (for example, a young character might be sent upstairs to put on his or her shoes and never be referred to again).\n\nThe sketch also marks the first appearances of [[Harvey Korman]]'s Mother Marcus character, who had also become a recurring resident of Canoga Falls, as well as [[Tim Conway]]'s [[The Oldest Man (character)|Oldest Man character]], who within the confines of the series played several characters, including Marion's grandfather, her Uncle Waldo, insurance agent Duane Toddleberry, and obscene phone caller Marvin Peterson Jr.<ref>{{cite interview |last=Burnett |first=Carol |subjectlink= |interviewer=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) |title=Featurette: Fabulous Firsts |url= |date= |work=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) }}</ref>\n\nThe sketch was famous for the parody ending in which the announcer would ask foreboding, progressively nonsensical questions about the characters while focusing on their puzzled reactions.\n\n==Trivia==\n* In her 1996 memoir, \"As My World Still Turns\", actress [[Eileen Fulton]], who has starred on the [[CBS]] soap ''[[As the World Turns]]'' for over four decades, claimed credit for coming up with the concept for \"As the Stomach Turns\".  Fulton stated that when she was contacted to be a guest star on the ''Burnett'' show, she suggested a parody of a soap called \"As the Stomach Turns\".  Ultimately Fulton ended up not appearing on the ''Burnett'' show, but the \"Stomach Turns\" sketch did.<ref>{{cite book|title= As My World Still Turns|last= Fulton|first= Eileen|authorlink= |author2= Atholl, Desmond|author3= Cherkinian, Michael|year= 1996|publisher= [[St. Martin's Press]]|location= [[New York City|New York]]|isbn= 1-55972-274-6|oclc= 31606927|pages= |url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/asmyworldstilltu00fult}}</ref>\n* [[Cher]] appeared on an episode of \"As the Stomach Turns\" as Pocahontas Pirelli, \"the town half-breed: half-Indian, and half-dressed,\" which was a play on her hit song of the time, \"[[Half-Breed (song)|Half-Breed]].\" She came in wearing a Native American headdress and a bikini top.\n* In an early sketch, Carol Burnett opens the door to find Harvey Korman as Mother Marcus for the character's first appearance on the show. When rehearsing the sketch, Korman never appeared in costume but spoke in the voice. When Burnett opened the door in dress rehearsal it was the first time she had actually seen him dressed up as the character. Burnett's reaction (pausing, struggling to regain her composure before slamming the door in his face, then cracking up when she opened the door again to move the script along) was completely genuine.\n\n==Sketches==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n!

This same sort of plot was eventually done, in all seriousness, on ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' decades later.\n\nAnother movie parody saw Marion meet the bedraggled \"Richard Dryface,\" played by guest [[Steve Martin]] in a spoof of ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', complete with a grey, bulbous-headed alien played by Conway.\n\nThe sketch also touched on stereotypical aspects of production values in American soaps. Many times, Marion forgot what she wanted to say, reminiscent of the times when soap operas were broadcast live and actors routinely forgot their next line. Marion also answered the door either too soon or too late when someone rang her doorbell. Other times, she would miss the correct time to answer the phone, saying \"Hello\" before the sound effect came for it to ring. On live soap opera productions, these were big problems; due to the live nature of the show, they happened fairly frequently, and were subsequently spoofed at length on ''The Carol Burnett Show''.\n\nIn addition to the missed cues, the sketch was notorious for overusing loud and plangent [[Organ (music)|organ music]], a reference to a time when soap operas would have in-house organists play dramatic music as well as the show's theme song (when this skit first ran, organ music was still in wide use on the serials). Organ music was eventually discontinued in the mid-1970s, around the time ''The Carol Burnett Show'' wrapped up its run, so when the sketch is seen in syndication today, it brings back a sense of production technique that is now seen by many younger soap viewers as archaic and outdated.\n\nOne of the sketch's recurring characters is Marion's \"ne'er-do-well\" daughter (played by [[Vicki Lawrence]]) who arrives at the door holding a baby (a doll), usually says \"Don't you recognize me mother? I'm your daughter,\" then leaves after giving the baby to Marion who immediately stashes it in the umbrella stand.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref> This was a parody of the fact that traditional soap operas have little use for child characters, either dropping them from the plot line shortly after they are introduced or [[Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome|unnaturally aging]] them into adulthood or, more recently, into the teenage years (for example, a young character might be sent upstairs to put on his or her shoes and never be referred to again).\n\nThe sketch also marks the first appearances of [[Harvey Korman]]'s Mother Marcus character, who had also become a recurring resident of Canoga Falls, as well as [[Tim Conway]]'s [[The Oldest Man (character)|Oldest Man character]], who within the confines of the series played several characters, including Marion's grandfather, her Uncle Waldo, insurance agent Duane Toddleberry, and obscene phone caller Marvin Peterson Jr.<ref>{{cite interview |last=Burnett |first=Carol |subjectlink= |interviewer=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) |title=Featurette: Fabulous Firsts |url= |date= |work=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) }}</ref>\n\nThe sketch was famous for the parody ending in which the announcer would ask foreboding, progressively nonsensical questions about the characters while focusing on their puzzled reactions.\n\n==Trivia==\n* In her 1996 memoir, \"As My World Still Turns\", actress [[Eileen Fulton]], who has starred on the [[CBS]] soap ''[[As the World Turns]]'' for over four decades, claimed credit for coming up with the concept for \"As the Stomach Turns\".  Fulton stated that when she was contacted to be a guest star on the ''Burnett'' show, she suggested a parody of a soap called \"As the Stomach Turns\".  Ultimately Fulton ended up not appearing on the ''Burnett'' show, but the \"Stomach Turns\" sketch did.<ref>{{cite book|title= As My World Still Turns|last= Fulton|first= Eileen|authorlink= |author2= Atholl, Desmond|author3= Cherkinian, Michael|year= 1996|publisher= [[St. Martin's Press]]|location= [[New York City|New York]]|isbn= 1-55972-274-6|oclc= 31606927|pages= |url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/asmyworldstilltu00fult}}</ref>\n* [[Cher]] appeared on an episode of \"As the Stomach Turns\" as Pocahontas Pirelli, \"the town half-breed: half-Indian, and half-dressed,\" which was a play on her hit song of the time, \"[[Half-Breed (song)|Half-Breed]].\" She came in wearing a Native American headdress and a bikini top.\n* In an early sketch, Carol Burnett opens the door to find Harvey Korman as Mother Marcus for the character's first appearance on the show. When rehearsing the sketch, Korman never appeared in costume but spoke in the voice. When Burnett opened the door in dress rehearsal it was the first time she had actually seen him dressed up as the character. Burnett's reaction (pausing, struggling to regain her composure before slamming the door in his face, then cracking up when she opened the door again to move the script along) was completely genuine.\n\n==Sketches==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n!
