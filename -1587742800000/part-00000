It first aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the [[United States]] on October 26, 2011. In the episode, Randy discovers that musicals contain subtext that encourage women to give [[oral sex]], meanwhile Shelly starts dating the [[vegan]] kid.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Trey Parker]] and [[Robert Lopez]] as an uncredited writer, who previously worked with Parker and [[Matt Stone]] on the [[Tony Award]]-winning musical,  ''[[The Book of Mormon (musical)|The Book of Mormon]]''. This episode is rated [[TV-MA-LS]] in the United States.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Randy Marsh (South Park)|Randy]] hears from his male co-workers that taking women to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] shows sexually arouses them into performing [[oral sex]]. Randy takes Sharon to [[Denver]] to see ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'', but is confused and unimpressed with the lack of overt sexuality. He is informed by a fellow theatergoer at the theater's bar that women are aroused not by the production's explicit sexuality, but by its [[subtext]]. When Randy returns to the auditorium, he now hears the actors underhandedly referencing [[fellatio|blowjobs]] frequently in the songs' lyrics. On the ride home Sharon performs fellatio on him, and as a result, Randy decides to take her to [[New York City]] to see all the Broadway shows, leaving Stan and Shelly with the Feegans, South Park's resident life-preserver wearing [[vegan]]s. During their dinner with the Feegans, Shelly gets into a confrontation with Mr. Feegan over letting his son Larry decide for himself if he wants to be a vegan. This results in Larry developing greater confidence, falling in love with Shelly, and abandoning his life preserver.\n\nUpon returning to South Park, Randy laments the fact that he does not live closer to a major theater venue like Broadway, as the Denver production of ''Wicked'', to which he has already taken Sharon 23 times, will soon move to [[Seattle]]. He decides to produce a local play, though he discards subtext by naming it ''Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen'', and not only makes the show about women giving oral sex, but includes direct commands to Sharon in it. This attracts the attention of [[Stephen Sondheim]], [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]], [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], and [[Elton John]]. The four are depicted as [[Hypermasculinity|hypermasculine]], beer drinking heterosexuals who hang out at [[Hooters]], and are called \"Bros\" (Sondheim and John are openly gay in real life). They chastise Randy for the overt use of sexuality in his play, explaining to him that the lack of any real subtext would expose the truth behind Broadway shows. Randy dismisses their criticisms, insisting that his play is filled with subtext, but after a \"[[bro (subculture)|bro]]-down\" with Sondheim in a parking lot, in which they confront each other with verbal challenges, Randy agrees to accept their assistance, and renames his play ''[[The Woman in White (musical)|The Woman in White]]''.\n\nWhen Randy returns home and learns that Sharon gave Shelly two tickets to see ''Wicked'' with Larry, Randy is horrified, and races to Denver with Sharon, revealing to her the truth about Broadway shows, much to her own horror. Initially thrown out of the theater for being disruptive, Randy dons a [[Spider-Man]] costume and swings through the auditorium, knocking out several patrons and production personnel, before breaking open a [[Water supply network|water main]], forcing the play into an intermission and fatally drowning Larry, much to Shelly's grief. Shelly's grief is accentuated by the fact that Larry drowned because his budding self-confidence \u2013 borne of his new relationship with Shelly \u2013 had caused Larry to abandon his life-preserver. Randy apologizes to Sharon for taking her to the theater to get oral sex in return, though she expresses difficulty in faulting him for doing what all other men also do, pointing out that musicals must have value if they brought them closer together. When Sharon asks which show is coming to Denver next, an advertisement for Trey Parker, Matt Stone and Robert Lopez's musical ''[[The Book of Mormon (musical)|The Book of Mormon]]'' plays, with the narrator quickly muttering, \"You'll get a blowjob!\"\n\n==Production==\nTrey Parker and Matt Stone had just finished working with composer Robert Lopez in the Broadway musical ''[[The Book of Mormon (musical)|The Book of Mormon]]'' before this season of ''South Park'' commenced. During the collaboration, the duo offered Lopez a chance to come to their studio to create an episode with them and workshop ideas. He arrived on a Thursday at Halloween-time, so the notion of a generic Halloween-themed episode was tossed around. Broadway and musicals were never explicitly on the table until the idea of \"trying to make Broadway cool for dudes\" came up. They were anxious about the number of songs - albeit short ones - that they had to write. They kept on putting this off as they needed time to hash out the story. They ended up frantically writing songs on the following Tuesday.

It first aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the [[United States]] on October 26, 2011. In the episode, Randy discovers that musicals contain subtext that encourage women to give [[oral sex]], meanwhile Shelly starts dating the [[vegan]] kid.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Trey Parker]] and [[Robert Lopez]] as an uncredited writer, who previously worked with Parker and [[Matt Stone]] on the [[Tony Award]]-winning musical,  ''[[The Book of Mormon (musical)|The Book of Mormon]]''. This episode is rated [[TV-MA-LS]] in the United States.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Randy Marsh (South Park)|Randy]] hears from his male co-workers that taking women to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] shows sexually arouses them into performing [[oral sex]]. Randy takes Sharon to [[Denver]] to see ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'', but is confused and unimpressed with the lack of overt sexuality. He is informed by a fellow theatergoer at the theater's bar that women are aroused not by the production's explicit sexuality, but by its [[subtext]]. When Randy returns to the auditorium, he now hears the actors underhandedly referencing [[fellatio|blowjobs]] frequently in the songs' lyrics. On the ride home Sharon performs fellatio on him, and as a result, Randy decides to take her to [[New York City]] to see all the Broadway shows, leaving Stan and Shelly with the Feegans, South Park's resident life-preserver wearing [[vegan]]s. During their dinner with the Feegans, Shelly gets into a confrontation with Mr. Feegan over letting his son Larry decide for himself if he wants to be a vegan. This results in Larry developing greater confidence, falling in love with Shelly, and abandoning his life preserver.\n\nUpon returning to South Park, Randy laments the fact that he does not live closer to a major theater venue like Broadway, as the Denver production of ''Wicked'', to which he has already taken Sharon 23 times, will soon move to [[Seattle]]. He decides to produce a local play, though he discards subtext by naming it ''Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen'', and not only makes the show about women giving oral sex, but includes direct commands to Sharon in it. This attracts the attention of [[Stephen Sondheim]], [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]], [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], and [[Elton John]]. The four are depicted as [[Hypermasculinity|hypermasculine]], beer drinking heterosexuals who hang out at [[Hooters]], and are called \"Bros\" (Sondheim and John are openly gay in real life). They chastise Randy for the overt use of sexuality in his play, explaining to him that the lack of any real subtext would expose the truth behind Broadway shows. Randy dismisses their criticisms, insisting that his play is filled with subtext, but after a \"[[bro (subculture)|bro]]-down\" with Sondheim in a parking lot, in which they confront each other with verbal challenges, Randy agrees to accept their assistance, and renames his play ''[[The Woman in White (musical)|The Woman in White]]''.\n\nWhen Randy returns home and learns that Sharon gave Shelly two tickets to see ''Wicked'' with Larry, Randy is horrified, and races to Denver with Sharon, revealing to her the truth about Broadway shows, much to her own horror. Initially thrown out of the theater for being disruptive, Randy dons a [[Spider-Man]] costume and swings through the auditorium, knocking out several patrons and production personnel, before breaking open a [[Water supply network|water main]], forcing the play into an intermission and fatally drowning Larry, much to Shelly's grief. Shelly's grief is accentuated by the fact that Larry drowned because his budding self-confidence \u2013 borne of his new relationship with Shelly \u2013 had caused Larry to abandon his life-preserver. Randy apologizes to Sharon for taking her to the theater to get oral sex in return, though she expresses difficulty in faulting him for doing what all other men also do, pointing out that musicals must have value if they brought them closer together. When Sharon asks which show is coming to Denver next, an advertisement for Trey Parker, Matt Stone and Robert Lopez's musical ''[[The Book of Mormon (musical)|The Book of Mormon]]'' plays, with the narrator quickly muttering, \"You'll get a blowjob!\"\n\n==Production==\nTrey Parker and Matt Stone had just finished working with composer Robert Lopez in the Broadway musical ''[[The Book of Mormon (musical)|The Book of Mormon]]'' before this season of ''South Park'' commenced. During the collaboration, the duo offered Lopez a chance to come to their studio to create an episode with them and workshop ideas. He arrived on a Thursday at Halloween-time, so the notion of a generic Halloween-themed episode was tossed around. Broadway and musicals were never explicitly on the table until the idea of \"trying to make Broadway cool for dudes\" came up. They were anxious about the number of songs - albeit short ones - that they had to write. They kept on putting this off as they needed time to hash out the story. They ended up frantically writing songs on the following Tuesday. Trey and Matt thoroughly enjoyed the one-off experience and expressed an interest in collaborating with Lopez again, not necessarily in the context of a musical episode.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE1eMdyQzXw Broadway Bro Down commentary]</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe episode received positive reviews.\n\nRamsey Isler of IGN gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10, writing, \"When it comes down to it, it's the one-liners and the strength of the A-plot that make this episode work.

The film stars [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]], [[Revathi]], [[Urvashi (actress)|Urvashi]] and [[Rohini (actress)|Rohini]]. Inspired by the American film ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]'' (1980), it revolves around three women deciding to gang up against their lecherous office boss who constantly [[Workplace harassment|harasses them]].\n\n''Magalir Mattum'' was released on 25 February 1994 and became a commercial success, running for over 175 days in theatres. For her performance, Urvashi won the [[Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize]] for Best Actress. The film is also regarded as an early example of the [[Me Too movement (India)|Me Too movement]] in India.\n\n== Plot ==\nJanaki, Pappamma and Satya are three women employed at a fashion export company. Janaki works as a typist to support herself, her husband and their child as her husband lost his job in a factory. Pappamma is a housekeeper who lives with her drunkard [[rickshaw]]-puller husband and earns for both their living and her husband's drinking expense. Sathya, a computer graduate and designer, joined the fashion company as a fashion designer. All the women in the company face a common threat in the form of manager G. K. Pandian, a womaniser. He harasses his female employees in one way or other, but the women tolerate his torture due to their family circumstances.\n\nPandian tries to move close with Satya and unaware of Pandian's intention, Satya at first dines with him. This isolates her from other employees. Pandian tries to impress her by presenting a silk saree, but Satya insults him by saying that only a father or husband should present a saree to a woman and what he has done is purely idiotic. This gains her the friendship of Janaki and Pappamma and Satya understands about Pandian. A small daily clash occurs between Pappamma and Janaki whenever Pappamma misplaces rat poison besides sugar and Janaki almost mixes rat poison by mistake in the coffee of Pandian's as both sugar and poison look alike. Due to Satya's friendship, Janaki becomes bold enough to face her supervisor and she insults her in front of everyone. Hence the supervisor tries to take revenge by hiding an important file which is under Janaki's custody. But Pappamma helps her by revealing the truth to Pandian. All the three women are frustrated by Pandian's attitude and are finding some way to stop his misdeeds towards them.\n\nJanaki mixes rat poison unknowingly in Pandian's coffee and gives it to him and goes to work. Pandian falls from his chair and becomes unconscious. Satya finds his state and admits him in hospital. Janaki finds that she has mixed rat poison in the coffee and Pandian drank it and reveals the truth to her friends, which shocks them. All three rush to hospital and hear that the patient is dead due to strong dosage of poison. But actually they don't know that the dead man is a terrorist who died by drinking cyanide and Pandian has actually fainted due to a minor injury and has recovered. They kidnap the corpse and take it to Satya's room only to find that they have kidnapped corpse of the terrorist. Hence they decide to place it back in the hospital. But Pappamma's husband misunderstands that his wife and the dead man have a relationship and fights with him. Finally police find out the missed corpse and all three leave silently. Pandian returns to the office and this shocks the three women. The supervisor overhears their conversation and informs Pandian.\n\nPandian blackmails them that he would report the murder attempt to the police if they did not obey what he says. He demands to spend each night with all the three women in his private house. All three come to a decision and pretend to accept his demands. In his private house, they initially act to romance, but finally trap him and tie him. Satya takes charge of acting manager and with the help of Janaki, Pappamma and other employees she brings many changes in the office. In the evening, all the three go to the private house. One day, Satya receives information from the head office about the boss' visit and get tense as they have kidnapped the manager. All three decide to confess about what happened in the office and rush to the airport to receive the boss. The supervisor overhears them and she rescues Pandian. Both Satya and Pandian try to rush to the airport before the other. They miss the boss, who leaves with Pandian. The trio is shocked and chase him to the office.\n\nIn the office, the young boss finds differences and Pandian says that he is not responsible for anything that happened here. But the boss looks like he is aware about what happened there and appreciates all three for their innovative ideas. He decides to leave the charge of the office to the trio and transfers Pandian to Andaman. He also gives remedy for Janaki's husband's job in his friend's factory and Pappamma's husband's job as watchman in their school. When he inquires about Satya's marriage, Janaki says that she has a dream boy drawn in the computer. Satya shows her dream boy to him and all are surprised that Satya's dream boy is their boss. The boss asks Satya to marry him, and she accepts his proposal.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]] as G. K.

The film stars [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]], [[Revathi]], [[Urvashi (actress)|Urvashi]] and [[Rohini (actress)|Rohini]]. Inspired by the American film ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]'' (1980), it revolves around three women deciding to gang up against their lecherous office boss who constantly [[Workplace harassment|harasses them]].\n\n''Magalir Mattum'' was released on 25 February 1994 and became a commercial success, running for over 175 days in theatres. For her performance, Urvashi won the [[Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize]] for Best Actress. The film is also regarded as an early example of the [[Me Too movement (India)|Me Too movement]] in India.\n\n== Plot ==\nJanaki, Pappamma and Satya are three women employed at a fashion export company. Janaki works as a typist to support herself, her husband and their child as her husband lost his job in a factory. Pappamma is a housekeeper who lives with her drunkard [[rickshaw]]-puller husband and earns for both their living and her husband's drinking expense. Sathya, a computer graduate and designer, joined the fashion company as a fashion designer. All the women in the company face a common threat in the form of manager G. K. Pandian, a womaniser. He harasses his female employees in one way or other, but the women tolerate his torture due to their family circumstances.\n\nPandian tries to move close with Satya and unaware of Pandian's intention, Satya at first dines with him. This isolates her from other employees. Pandian tries to impress her by presenting a silk saree, but Satya insults him by saying that only a father or husband should present a saree to a woman and what he has done is purely idiotic. This gains her the friendship of Janaki and Pappamma and Satya understands about Pandian. A small daily clash occurs between Pappamma and Janaki whenever Pappamma misplaces rat poison besides sugar and Janaki almost mixes rat poison by mistake in the coffee of Pandian's as both sugar and poison look alike. Due to Satya's friendship, Janaki becomes bold enough to face her supervisor and she insults her in front of everyone. Hence the supervisor tries to take revenge by hiding an important file which is under Janaki's custody. But Pappamma helps her by revealing the truth to Pandian. All the three women are frustrated by Pandian's attitude and are finding some way to stop his misdeeds towards them.\n\nJanaki mixes rat poison unknowingly in Pandian's coffee and gives it to him and goes to work. Pandian falls from his chair and becomes unconscious. Satya finds his state and admits him in hospital. Janaki finds that she has mixed rat poison in the coffee and Pandian drank it and reveals the truth to her friends, which shocks them. All three rush to hospital and hear that the patient is dead due to strong dosage of poison. But actually they don't know that the dead man is a terrorist who died by drinking cyanide and Pandian has actually fainted due to a minor injury and has recovered. They kidnap the corpse and take it to Satya's room only to find that they have kidnapped corpse of the terrorist. Hence they decide to place it back in the hospital. But Pappamma's husband misunderstands that his wife and the dead man have a relationship and fights with him. Finally police find out the missed corpse and all three leave silently. Pandian returns to the office and this shocks the three women. The supervisor overhears their conversation and informs Pandian.\n\nPandian blackmails them that he would report the murder attempt to the police if they did not obey what he says. He demands to spend each night with all the three women in his private house. All three come to a decision and pretend to accept his demands. In his private house, they initially act to romance, but finally trap him and tie him. Satya takes charge of acting manager and with the help of Janaki, Pappamma and other employees she brings many changes in the office. In the evening, all the three go to the private house. One day, Satya receives information from the head office about the boss' visit and get tense as they have kidnapped the manager. All three decide to confess about what happened in the office and rush to the airport to receive the boss. The supervisor overhears them and she rescues Pandian. Both Satya and Pandian try to rush to the airport before the other. They miss the boss, who leaves with Pandian. The trio is shocked and chase him to the office.\n\nIn the office, the young boss finds differences and Pandian says that he is not responsible for anything that happened here. But the boss looks like he is aware about what happened there and appreciates all three for their innovative ideas. He decides to leave the charge of the office to the trio and transfers Pandian to Andaman. He also gives remedy for Janaki's husband's job in his friend's factory and Pappamma's husband's job as watchman in their school. When he inquires about Satya's marriage, Janaki says that she has a dream boy drawn in the computer. Satya shows her dream boy to him and all are surprised that Satya's dream boy is their boss. The boss asks Satya to marry him, and she accepts his proposal.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]] as G. K.

When the detectives are led to a video of the event, they discover that four people in the video may be in league with a surprising collaborator.  This later leads to evidence of corruption by the school's principal. [[Debra Winger]] guest stars.\n\n==Production==\n\"Boy on Fire\" was written by Douglas Shaluas, Ed Zuckerman, and Matthew McGough, and directed by [[Rose Troche]].\n\n==Trivia==\nThis episode was partially inspired by the events surrounding the [[murder of Derrion Albert]] and the attack on Michael Brewer.  Further, this episode references the [[Houston Independent School District]], where the district's schools were widely praised for lowering dropout rates and improving test scores; this achievement was used to promote President [[George W.

In 2003, he became a permanent faculty member at [[ESSEC Business School|ESSEC]] Business School (Paris-Singapore).

Plunging into the heart of this universal grammar, Katz criticizes the linguistic metaphors used in biology and their [[anthropomorphism]]. He formulates the hypothesis of a genetic [[protolanguage]] that existed before all human conscience, and whose gradual evolution enabled the emergence of verbal languages and their various forms.<ref>https://springerlink3.metapress.com/content/b53m77v60347760h/resource-secured/?target=fulltext.pdf&sid=myilkpyxqlsabas5ungwevmz&sh=www.springerlink.com</ref> \"''Behind the biochemical signs, is there a signature? If there is a program, is there a Programmer?''\" In light of the most recent scientific advances in genomics, Katz re-visits the debate on the origin of life, from biblical biology to the philosophical traditions of the great book of Nature. He analyzes the very idea of \"creative chance\" as a modern reformulation of the spontaneous generation theory. Beyond the current controversies, he demonstrates why the concepts of creation and evolution can be reconciled through the Bergsonian concept of \"creative evolution\".\n\n\"''But in this program, where do we put free will?''\" the author asks. Biological code, linguistic code, ethological code, ethical code\u2026 From ''bios'' to ''ethos'', does the genome contain the Code of Codes at the root of our physical and psychological traits, including habits and behaviors such as addiction, appetite for risk, maternal instinct, aggressiveness or pair bonding? Science is only beginning to discover the subtlety of the program, yet Man is already seeking to reprogram it in an attempt to control its determinism. The final chapter of the book anticipates the [[eugenistic]] temptation that would reduce Man to the raw score of his genetic quotient. Katz anticipates the emergence of a genomic hygienism based on the public health costs generated by individuals with predispositions for certain diseases. Through concrete illustrations from the medtech and biotech industries, he analyzes the expansion of human screening, where \"the concept of prevention no longer means avoiding the appearance of the disease, but rather the appearance of the diseased individual.\" Breaking with the transhumanist currents, he identifies the narrow path through which stem cells and genomics could succeed in healing Man without alienating his moral status.\n\n== Expert panels ==\nGregory Katz is regularly invited on expert panels by institutions such as the OECD, the [[French Senate]],<ref>http://www.senat.fr/rap/r08-079/r08-0791.pdf</ref> the [[Conseil d\u2019Etat]],<ref>http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/var/storage/rapports-publics/094000288/0000.pdf</ref> the [[European Parliament]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/bepa/european-group-ethics/welcome/index_en.htm|title=EPSC - European Commission|date=12 January 2014|work=europa.eu|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref> (''European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies'') and [[UNESCO]] (''[[Human Variome Project]])''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/events/5th-biennial-meeting-human-variome-project|title=5th Biennial Meeting of the Human Variome Project|work=UNESCO|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref>''.''\n\n== Contributions to the French debate on bioethics laws ==\nAs part of the 2011 debate on French bioethics laws, Gregory Katz was involved in the drafting of a bill sponsored by Senator Hermange on stem cells contained in umbilical cord blood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/notice-rapport/2007/lc187-notice.html|title=La conservation du sang placentaire|work=senat.fr|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref> Considered \"biological waste\", the legal status of these stem cells was not clearly defined by [[French law]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.em-consulte.com/article/256755|title=Quel statut pour les banques de sang de cordon ombilical&nbsp;?|author=Elsevier Masson|work=EM-Consulte|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref> The purpose of the bill was to establish their status as a \"therapeutic resource\" much as for other hematopoietic cells, implying the principles of consent, anonymity and donation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/propositions-de-loi/hermange_marie_therese04075m.html|title=Propositions de loi ou de r\u00e9solution d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par Mme Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se HERMANGE : session 2010-2011 - S\u00e9nat|work=senat.fr|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref> Passed in 2011 by the French Senate and National Assembly as part of a general review of bioethical laws (article 7 of the government\u2019s bill), this bill have since been transposed into the French Public Health Code.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006072665&dateTexte=20110825|title=Code de la sant\u00e9 publique - Legifrance|work=legifrance.gouv.fr|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Awards & Distinctions ==\n* Special Jury Trophy in 2012 awarded by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de l\u2019Hospitalisation Priv\u00e9e.<ref name=\"fhp.fr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fhp.fr/1-fhp/7-presse-evenements/1351-communiques-de-presse-2012/6149-mai-2012-trophees-2012-de-l-hospitalisation-privee-des-initiatives-remarquables-primees.aspx|title=Communiqu\u00e9s de presse 2012|work=fhp.fr|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref>\n* San Benedetto international prize awarded in 2008 for his achievements in bioethics and humanism.

Plunging into the heart of this universal grammar, Katz criticizes the linguistic metaphors used in biology and their [[anthropomorphism]]. He formulates the hypothesis of a genetic [[protolanguage]] that existed before all human conscience, and whose gradual evolution enabled the emergence of verbal languages and their various forms.<ref>https://springerlink3.metapress.com/content/b53m77v60347760h/resource-secured/?target=fulltext.pdf&sid=myilkpyxqlsabas5ungwevmz&sh=www.springerlink.com</ref> \"''Behind the biochemical signs, is there a signature? If there is a program, is there a Programmer?''\" In light of the most recent scientific advances in genomics, Katz re-visits the debate on the origin of life, from biblical biology to the philosophical traditions of the great book of Nature. He analyzes the very idea of \"creative chance\" as a modern reformulation of the spontaneous generation theory. Beyond the current controversies, he demonstrates why the concepts of creation and evolution can be reconciled through the Bergsonian concept of \"creative evolution\".\n\n\"''But in this program, where do we put free will?''\" the author asks. Biological code, linguistic code, ethological code, ethical code\u2026 From ''bios'' to ''ethos'', does the genome contain the Code of Codes at the root of our physical and psychological traits, including habits and behaviors such as addiction, appetite for risk, maternal instinct, aggressiveness or pair bonding? Science is only beginning to discover the subtlety of the program, yet Man is already seeking to reprogram it in an attempt to control its determinism. The final chapter of the book anticipates the [[eugenistic]] temptation that would reduce Man to the raw score of his genetic quotient. Katz anticipates the emergence of a genomic hygienism based on the public health costs generated by individuals with predispositions for certain diseases. Through concrete illustrations from the medtech and biotech industries, he analyzes the expansion of human screening, where \"the concept of prevention no longer means avoiding the appearance of the disease, but rather the appearance of the diseased individual.\" Breaking with the transhumanist currents, he identifies the narrow path through which stem cells and genomics could succeed in healing Man without alienating his moral status.\n\n== Expert panels ==\nGregory Katz is regularly invited on expert panels by institutions such as the OECD, the [[French Senate]],<ref>http://www.senat.fr/rap/r08-079/r08-0791.pdf</ref> the [[Conseil d\u2019Etat]],<ref>http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/var/storage/rapports-publics/094000288/0000.pdf</ref> the [[European Parliament]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/bepa/european-group-ethics/welcome/index_en.htm|title=EPSC - European Commission|date=12 January 2014|work=europa.eu|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref> (''European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies'') and [[UNESCO]] (''[[Human Variome Project]])''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/events/5th-biennial-meeting-human-variome-project|title=5th Biennial Meeting of the Human Variome Project|work=UNESCO|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref>''.''\n\n== Contributions to the French debate on bioethics laws ==\nAs part of the 2011 debate on French bioethics laws, Gregory Katz was involved in the drafting of a bill sponsored by Senator Hermange on stem cells contained in umbilical cord blood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/notice-rapport/2007/lc187-notice.html|title=La conservation du sang placentaire|work=senat.fr|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref> Considered \"biological waste\", the legal status of these stem cells was not clearly defined by [[French law]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.em-consulte.com/article/256755|title=Quel statut pour les banques de sang de cordon ombilical&nbsp;?|author=Elsevier Masson|work=EM-Consulte|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref> The purpose of the bill was to establish their status as a \"therapeutic resource\" much as for other hematopoietic cells, implying the principles of consent, anonymity and donation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/propositions-de-loi/hermange_marie_therese04075m.html|title=Propositions de loi ou de r\u00e9solution d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par Mme Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se HERMANGE : session 2010-2011 - S\u00e9nat|work=senat.fr|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref> Passed in 2011 by the French Senate and National Assembly as part of a general review of bioethical laws (article 7 of the government\u2019s bill), this bill have since been transposed into the French Public Health Code.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006072665&dateTexte=20110825|title=Code de la sant\u00e9 publique - Legifrance|work=legifrance.gouv.fr|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Awards & Distinctions ==\n* Special Jury Trophy in 2012 awarded by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de l\u2019Hospitalisation Priv\u00e9e.<ref name=\"fhp.fr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fhp.fr/1-fhp/7-presse-evenements/1351-communiques-de-presse-2012/6149-mai-2012-trophees-2012-de-l-hospitalisation-privee-des-initiatives-remarquables-primees.aspx|title=Communiqu\u00e9s de presse 2012|work=fhp.fr|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref>\n* San Benedetto international prize awarded in 2008 for his achievements in bioethics and humanism.

Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Power===\n[[File:WIlliam L.

The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine. Whereas sailing yachts continued to be steered from the after portion of the vessel, power yachts adopted the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in a forward cabin structure that afforded better forward and sideways visibility.<ref name=\":02\" />\n==== Steam ====\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UmMx9ixu90kC|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n==== External combustion ====\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century. In the 1880s the [[naphtha engine]] made its appearance in boats. The naphtha engine is an [[external combustion engine]], where the [[working fluid]] and fuel are both [[naphtha]], which unusually is also used as a liquid fuel to power the boiler. As with a steam engine, the naphtha boils into a gas to drive a piston and then is recovered as a liquid through condensing coils.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Nehemiah|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aI5RAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover|title=New Catechism of the Steam Engine: With Chapters on Gas, Oil and Hot Air Engines|date=1904|publisher=T.

Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique.

Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat.

More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]].<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Gear ====\nSailboats employ [[standing rigging]] to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Engine ====\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails.

Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]].

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Power===\n[[File:WIlliam L.

The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine. Whereas sailing yachts continued to be steered from the after portion of the vessel, power yachts adopted the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in a forward cabin structure that afforded better forward and sideways visibility.<ref name=\":02\" />\n==== Steam ====\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UmMx9ixu90kC|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n==== External combustion ====\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century. In the 1880s the [[naphtha engine]] made its appearance in boats.

Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n== Accommodations ==\n[[File:Babainterior.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht interior with fold-down table in main salon, galley (kitchen) on left, and navigation station on right and forward cabin visible beyond.

In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]].
