He was then defeated by Roode, who pinned him while holding his tights. Right after that, Ziggler attacked Roode from behind with a ''Zig Zag''. On the October 17 edition of ''SmackDown Live'', Ziggler defeated Roode in a rematch by pinfall while holding his tights, similar to how Roode defeated him. On the October 31 edition of ''SmackDown'', Ziggler failed to earn a spot on Team SmackDown for the [[Survivor Series (2017)|Survivor Series]] five-on-five elimination match against ''Raw'' after being defeated by Roode in a two-out-of-three falls match. Ziggler was involved in a verbal backstage confrontation with both Roode and United States Champion Baron Corbin on the December 5 episode of ''SmackDown'', where Roode defeated Corbin via disqualification after being attacked by Ziggler. The following week, Roode interfered in a match between Ziggler and Corbin in similar fashion, resulting in a disqualification victory for Ziggler. At [[Clash of Champions (2017)|Clash of Champions]], Ziggler defeated Corbin and Roode in a triple threat match to win his second United States Championship.<ref name=\"COC2017\">{{cite web|last=Powell|first=Jason|title=Powell's WWE Clash of Champions 2017 live review: AJ Styles vs. Jinder Mahal for the WWE Championship, Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn put their WWE careers on the line vs. Randy Orton and Shinsuke Nakamura with Shane McMahon and Daniel Bryan as referees|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2017/12/17/powells-wwe-clash-champions-2017-live-review-aj-styles-vs-jinder-mahal-wwe-championship-kevin-owens-sami-zayn-put-wwe-careers-line-vs-randy-orton-shinsuke-nak/|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=December 17, 2017}}</ref> On the following episode of ''SmackDown'' on December 19, Ziggler held a celebration that was a retrospective of his WWE career; he said that the fans did not deserve him and placed the title belt in the ring before leaving.<ref name=\"SmackDown12192017\">{{cite web|last1=Barnett|first1=Jake|title=12/19 Barnett's WWE Smackdown Live TV Review: AJ Styles, Shinsuke Nakaura, and Randy Orton vs. Jinder Mahal, Kevin Owens, and Sami Zayn, The Usos vs. Chad Gable and Shelton Benjamin in a non-title match, Shane McMahon and Daniel Bryan fallout from Clash of Champions|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2017/12/19/12-19-barnetts-wwe-smackdown-live-tv-review-aj-styles-shinsuke-nakaura-randy-orton-vs-jinder-mahal-kevin-owens-sami-zayn-usos-vs-chad-gable-shelton-benjamin-non-title-mat/|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}</ref> A week later, general manager [[Daniel Bryan]] said that Ziggler was nowhere to be found and had indeed vacated his title, so that a tournament to crown a new champion would be held (which was won by Bobby Roode).<ref name=\"SmackDown01162018\">{{cite web|last=Keller|first=Wade|title=KELLER'S WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT 1/16: U.S. Title Tournament semi-finals with Xavier vs. Jinder, Roode vs. Mojo, Shane-Bryan drama continues|url=https://www.pwtorch.com/site/2018/01/16/kellers-wwe-smackdown-report-1-16/|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=January 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\nZiggler returned at the [[Royal Rumble (2018)|Royal Rumble]] on January 28, 2018, as the surprise #30 entrant in the men's Royal Rumble match.

Australia is one of the most biologically diverse countries in the world, with a large portion of species endemic to Australia. Preserving this wealth of [[biodiversity]] is important for future generations.\n\nA key conservation issue is the preservation of biodiversity, especially by protecting the remaining rainforests. The destruction of habitat by human activities, including land clearing, remains the major cause of [[biodiversity loss]] in Australia. The importance of the Australian rainforests to the conservation movement is very high. Australia is the only western country to have large areas of rainforest intact. Forests provide timber, drugs, and food and should be managed to maximize the possible uses. Currently, there are a number of environmental movements and campaigners advocating for action on saving the environment, one such campaign is the Big Switch.\n\nLand management issues including clearance of native vegetation, reafforestation of once-cleared areas, control of exotic weeds and pests, expansion of dryland salinity, and changed fire regimes. Intensification of resource use in sectors such as forestry, fisheries, and agriculture are widely reported to contribute to biodiversity loss in Australia. Coastal and marine environments also have reduced biodiversity from reduced water quality caused by pollution and sediments arising from human settlements and agriculture. In central New South Wales where there are large plains of grassland, problems have risen from\u2014unusual to say\u2014lack of land clearing.\n\nThe [[Daintree Rainforest]], a tropical rainforest near [[Daintree, Queensland]] covering around 1200 square kilometres, is threatened by logging, development, mining and the effects of the high tourist numbers.\n\nThere are some government programs in Australia which are the opposite of conservation (such as killing wildlife); an example of this is [[shark culling]], which currently occurs in [[New South Wales]] and [[Queensland]].<ref name=\"Decline\"/><ref name=\"marineconservationDec22\"/>\n\n===Native fauna===\n[[File:Tasdevil large.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Tasmanian devil, officially listed as an endangered species in 2008.]]\n{{Main|Threatened fauna of Australia}}\nOver a hundred species of fauna are currently under serious threat of extinction.

The extinction of [[Australian megafauna]] is attributed to the arrival of humans and since European settlement, 23 birds, 4 frogs, and 27 mammal species are also known to have become extinct.\n\n{{See also|Extinct Australian animals}}\n\n===Marine conservation===\n[[File:GBReef TempChlorophyll 200602.jpg|thumb|right|Recent climate change reports have highlighted the threat of higher water temperatures to the Great Barrier Reef]]\n{{See also|Environmental threats to the Great Barrier Reef|Whaling in Australia}}\nOne of the notable issues with [[marine conservation]] in Australia is the protection of the [[Great Barrier Reef]]. The Great Barrier Reef's environmental pressures include water quality from runoff, climate change and mass coral bleaching, cyclic outbreaks of the crown-of-thorns starfish, overfishing, and shipping accidents.

Introduced plants that have caused widespread problems are [[lantana]] and the [[prickly pears in Australia|prickly pear]] bush.  The introduction and spread of animals such as the [[cane toad]] or [[rabbit]] can disrupt the existing balances between populations and develop into environmental problems.  The introduction of [[cattle]] into Australia and to a lesser extent the [[dingo]], are other examples of species that have changed the landscape. In some cases the introduction of new species can lead to [[pandemic|plague]]s and the extinction of endemic species.\n\nThe introduced species [[red fox]] has single-handedly caused the extinction of several species.  Tasmania takes the threat of [[red fox]] introduction so seriously that it has a government sponsored taskforce to prevent fox populations from taking hold on the island.\n\n== Land degradation ==\n\nAccording to [[Jared Diamond]], \"Australia's number-one environmental problem [is] [[land degradation]]\".<ref name=Diamond>[[Jared Diamond]], ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'', [[Penguin Books]], 2005 and 2011 ({{ISBN|9780241958681}}). See chapter 13 entitled \" \"Mining\" Australia \" (pages 378\u2013416).</ref> Land degradation results from nine types of damaging environmental impacts:<ref name=Diamond/>\n* [[Land clearing in Australia|Clearance]] of native vegetation\n* [[Overgrazing]] by sheep\n* [[Rabbits in Australia|Rabbits]]\n* Soil nutrient exhaustion\n* [[Soil erosion]]\n* Man-made [[drought]]s\n* Weeds\n* Misguided governmental policies\n* [[Salinity in Australia|Salinization]]\n\n=== Logging and woodchopping ===\n{{See also|Deforestation in Australia|Forestry in Australia|Woodchipping in Australia}}\n\nClearcutting of [[old growth forest]]s is continuing in parts of Australia. <!-- Tassie, Gippland?, Western Aussie? -->  This often involves the destruction of natural ecosystems and the replacement with monoculture plantations.\n\n=== Land clearing ===\n{{Main|Land clearing in Australia}}\n\nIn the [[prehistory of Australia]] the [[Indigenous Australians]] used [[fire-stick farming]] which was an early form of land clearing which caused long term changes to the ecology. With European colonisation land clearing continued on a larger scale for agriculture \u2013 particularly for cattle, cotton and wheat production. Since European settlement a total of 13% of native vegetation cover has been lost. The extinction of 20 different mammals, 9 bird and 97 plant species have been partially attributed to land clearing. Land clearing is a major source of Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, and contributed to approximately 12 percent of Australia\u2019s total emissions in 1998.\n\nThe consequences of land clearing include [[dryland salinity]] and [[soil erosion]]. These are a major concern to the [[landcare movement in Australia]].\n\nThe clearing of native vegetation is controlled by Federal laws (indirectly), State law and local planning instruments. The precise details of regulation of vegetation clearing differ according to the location where clearing is proposed.\n\n=== Soil salinity ===\n{{Main|Salinity in Australia}}\n[[Soil salinity]] affects 50,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 of Australia and is predominantly due to land clearance.\n\n==Waterway health==\n[[File:Litter trap.jpg|thumb|right|A Parks Victoria litter trap on the river catches floating rubbish on the Yarra at Birrarung Marr]]\nThe protection of waterways in Australia is a major concern for various reasons including habitat and biodiversity, but also due to use of the waterways by humans.\n\nThe [[Murray-Darling Basin]] is under threat due to [[irrigation in Australia]], causing high levels of salinity which affect agriculture and biodiversity in [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] and [[South Australia]].  These rivers are also affected by pesticide run-off and drought.\n\n===Australian waterways facing environmental issues===\nRivers and creeks in urban areas also face [[environmental issue]]s, particularly pollution.\n\n====Victoria====\n* [[Port Phillip]] (contamination \u2013 [[silt]]; sediment; toxins; [[household chemicals]]; garden chemicals; E. coli; litter; [[flotsam and jetsam]])<ref>Ryan, Kellie.

Many Australian cities have large urban footprints and are characterised by an unsustainable low density [[urban sprawl]].  This places demand on infrastructure and services which contributes to the problems of land clearing, pollution, transport related emissions, energy consumption, invasive species, [[automobile dependency]] and [[urban heat island]]s.\n[[File:Beach on the Gold Coast.jpg|thumb|left|A Queensland beach with the skyline of the heavily developed [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in the background.

There are also population [[decentralisation]] programs at state and federal levels aimed at shifting populations out of the major centres and stemming the drivers to rapid urbanisation.  [[Albury-Wodonga]] was part of the federal government's program of decentralisation begun in the 1970s, which has at times had relocation policies for immigration.  The Victorian government has run a decentralisation program since the 1960s, having had a ministerial position appointed and ongoing promotional and investment programs for stimulating growth in Regional Victoria.  However policy has swung over the decades, primarily due to local development priorities and agendas and a lack of federal co-ordination to the problem.\n\nIssues include large quantities of e-waste and toxic waste going into [[landfill]].  Australia does not have restrictions on the dumping of toxic materials that are common in other countries, such as dumping [[Cathode Ray Tube]]s which leach heavy metals into water catchments.  Due to the lack of sufficient sites for toxic waste disposal large quantities of toxic waste are trucked between states to remote dumping grounds or exported overseas in ships.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/clampdown-on-toxic-waste-20080726-3lf3.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Clampdown on toxic waste | first=Carmel | last=Egan | date=27 July 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Mining issues==\nAustralia has the largest reserves of [[uranium]] in the world and there has been a number of [[List of Australian Inquiries into Uranium Mining|enquiries on uranium mining]].

Australia is one of the most biologically diverse countries in the world, with a large portion of species endemic to Australia. Preserving this wealth of [[biodiversity]] is important for future generations.\n\nA key conservation issue is the preservation of biodiversity, especially by protecting the remaining rainforests. The destruction of habitat by human activities, including land clearing, remains the major cause of [[biodiversity loss]] in Australia. The importance of the Australian rainforests to the conservation movement is very high. Australia is the only western country to have large areas of rainforest intact. Forests provide timber, drugs, and food and should be managed to maximize the possible uses. Currently, there are a number of environmental movements and campaigners advocating for action on saving the environment, one such campaign is the Big Switch.\n\nLand management issues including clearance of native vegetation, reafforestation of once-cleared areas, control of exotic weeds and pests, expansion of dryland salinity, and changed fire regimes. Intensification of resource use in sectors such as forestry, fisheries, and agriculture are widely reported to contribute to biodiversity loss in Australia. Coastal and marine environments also have reduced biodiversity from reduced water quality caused by pollution and sediments arising from human settlements and agriculture. In central New South Wales where there are large plains of grassland, problems have risen from\u2014unusual to say\u2014lack of land clearing.\n\nThe [[Daintree Rainforest]], a tropical rainforest near [[Daintree, Queensland]] covering around 1200 square kilometres, is threatened by logging, development, mining and the effects of the high tourist numbers.\n\nThere are some government programs in Australia which are the opposite of conservation (such as killing wildlife); an example of this is [[shark culling]], which currently occurs in [[New South Wales]] and [[Queensland]].<ref name=\"Decline\"/><ref name=\"marineconservationDec22\"/>\n\n===Native fauna===\n[[File:Tasdevil large.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Tasmanian devil, officially listed as an endangered species in 2008.]]\n{{Main|Threatened fauna of Australia}}\nOver a hundred species of fauna are currently under serious threat of extinction.

Introduced plants that have caused widespread problems are [[lantana]] and the [[prickly pears in Australia|prickly pear]] bush.  The introduction and spread of animals such as the [[cane toad]] or [[rabbit]] can disrupt the existing balances between populations and develop into environmental problems.  The introduction of [[cattle]] into Australia and to a lesser extent the [[dingo]], are other examples of species that have changed the landscape. In some cases the introduction of new species can lead to [[pandemic|plague]]s and the extinction of endemic species.\n\nThe introduced species [[red fox]] has single-handedly caused the extinction of several species.  Tasmania takes the threat of [[red fox]] introduction so seriously that it has a government sponsored taskforce to prevent fox populations from taking hold on the island.\n\n== Land degradation ==\n\nAccording to [[Jared Diamond]], \"Australia's number-one environmental problem [is] [[land degradation]]\".<ref name=Diamond>[[Jared Diamond]], ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'', [[Penguin Books]], 2005 and 2011 ({{ISBN|9780241958681}}).

With European colonisation land clearing continued on a larger scale for agriculture - particularly for cattle, cotton and wheat production. Since European settlement a total of 13% of native vegetation cover has been lost. The extinction of 20 different mammals, 9 bird and 97 plant species have been partially attributed to land clearing. Land clearing is a major source of Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, and contributed to approximately 12 percent of Australia\u2019s total emissions in 1998.\n\nThe consequences of land clearing include [[dryland salinity]] and [[soil erosion]]. These are a major concern to the [[landcare movement in Australia]].\n\nThe clearing of native vegetation is controlled by Federal laws (indirectly), State law and local planning instruments. The precise details of regulation of vegetation clearing differ according to the location where clearing is proposed.\n\n=== Soil salinity ===\n{{Main|Salinity in Australia}}\n[[Soil salinity]] affects 50,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 of Australia and is predominantly due to land clearance.\n\n==Waterway health==\n[[File:Litter trap.jpg|thumb|right|A Parks Victoria litter trap on the river catches floating rubbish on the Yarra at Birrarung Marr]]\nThe protection of waterways in Australia is a major concern for various reasons including habitat and biodiversity, but also due to use of the waterways by humans.\n\nThe [[Murray-Darling Basin]] is under threat due to [[irrigation in Australia]], causing high levels of salinity which affect agriculture and biodiversity in [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] and [[South Australia]].

Water is becoming a very very big problem for not only Australia but worldwide as where there are droughts occurring more often and only having limited use of the water and then there are even places that don\u2019t have any water at all such as Africa etc, we need conserve our water for the future and get more access to the water since we only have roughly 5% access to it.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Urbanisation==\n[[File:Melbourne2.jpg|thumb|right|The urban sprawl of [[Melbourne]].]]\n\nAustralia is one of the most urbanised countries in the world.  Many Australian cities have large urban footprints and are characterised by an unsustainable low density [[urban sprawl]].  This places demand on infrastructure and services which contributes to the problems of land clearing, pollution, transport related emissions, energy consumption, invasive species, [[automobile dependency]] and [[urban heat island]]s.\n[[File:Beach on the Gold Coast.jpg|thumb|left|A Queensland beach with the skyline of the heavily developed [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in the background. Formerly swamplands, the city was urbanised on a coastal strip between waterways and the sea and now contains many high rises.]]\nThe urban sprawl continues to increase at a rapid rate in most Australian cities, particularly the state capital cities, all of which (with the exception of [[Hobart]]) are [[metropoleis]].  In some centres, such as [[Sydney]] and [[Greater Western Sydney]],<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSSYD33935420070606 | work=Reuters | title=Sydney needs a future plan to be sustainable: mayor | date=6 June 2007}}</ref> [[Greater Melbourne]]<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/urban-sprawl-is-killing-us-but-theres-another-way-20090416-a8xo.html?page=-1 Urban sprawl is killing us, but there's another way] from The Age</ref> and [[South East Queensland]]<ref>[http://www.wildlife.org.au/news-seqrp.html Plan now for the future of South-East Queensland - January 2005].

Retrieved on 22 March 2012.</ref> large metropolitan [[conurbation]]s threaten to extend for hundreds of kilometres and based on current population growth rates are expected to become [[Megacity|megacities]] in the 21st century.  Most Australian cities population growth is a result of [[human migration|migration]] in contrast to the [[Birth rate and fertility rate in Australia]], which is contributing to the ongoing trend of [[urbanisation]].\n\nIn recent years, some cities have implemented [[transit-oriented development]] strategies to curb the urban sprawl.  Notable examples include [[Melbourne 2030]],<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/lib-planning-policy-under-attack-as-groups-support-2030/2006/05/02/1146335732531.html |title=Lib planning policy under attack as groups support 2030 |author=Rachel Kleinman |accessdate=22 March 2012 |date=3 May 2006 |newspaper=The Age |publisher=The Age Company }}</ref> [[South East Queensland Regional Plan]] and the [[Sydney Metropolitan Strategy]]. There are also population [[decentralisation]] programs at state and federal levels aimed at shifting populations out of the major centres and stemming the drivers to rapid urbanisation.  [[Albury-Wodonga]] was part of the federal government's program of decentralisation begun in the 1970s, which has at times had relocation policies for immigration.  The Victorian government has run a decentralisation program since the 1960s, having had a ministerial position appointed and ongoing promotional and investment programs for stimulating growth in Regional Victoria.  However policy has swung over the decades, primarily due to local development priorities and agendas and a lack of federal co-ordination to the problem.\n\nIssues include large quantities of e-waste and toxic waste going into [[landfill]].  Australia does not have restrictions on the dumping of toxic materials that are common in other countries, such as dumping [[Cathode Ray Tube]]s which leach heavy metals into water catchments.  Due to the lack of sufficient sites for toxic waste disposal large quantities of toxic waste are trucked between states to remote dumping grounds or exported overseas in ships.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/clampdown-on-toxic-waste-20080726-3lf3.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Clampdown on toxic waste | first=Carmel | last=Egan | date=27 July 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Mining issues==\nAustralia has the largest reserves of [[uranium]] in the world and there has been a number of [[List of Australian Inquiries into Uranium Mining|enquiries on uranium mining]].

At the time, her marriage to Strindberg was considered a scandal because although von Essen's first husband had committed adultery, Strindberg was blamed for the dissolution of their marriage.

Her debut was considered a moderate success, and she took up an engagement as an actor at the Royal Dramatic Theatre that lasted until 1881. She also performed at the Swedish theater in Helsinki, Finland, during the period 1882\u201393.
