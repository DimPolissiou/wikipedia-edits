Shortly after her appointment in May 2017, Beck rewrote, among others, the regulations covering the chemical, [[perfluorooctanoic acid]], or PFOA, which has been linked to many serious health problems.

The draft plan  includes requirements that water utilities disclose inventories of lead service pipes and requires that daycare centers and schools report elevated lead levels within 24 hours rather than the current standard of 30 days.  However, environmental activists are critical of the relaxation of other standards that have been proposed that slow the timetable for the replacement of lead pipes found to contain high levels of lead, extending the replacement time from 7 percent of lead service lines each year to just 3 percent.

In January 2020, Trump proposed changes in the [[Environmental impact statement]] process (EIS) as required by the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA), which was passed in 1969.  NEPA changed environmental oversight in the U.S. by requiring federal agencies  to consider whether a project would harm the air, land, water or wildlife.  Thus, NEPA has prevented federal agencies from dividing large projects into smaller chunks to make the environmental impact appear to be insignificant.  For example, the proposal for a forest road would require that the  impact of logging that it was built to accommodate be evaluated as well. NEPA also requires that the public be allowed to review and provide input on proposals. Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups have voiced concerns that Trump's proposals would gut environmental protections and remove the public's right to know and make comments of project's potential harms to the environment.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Blitzer |first1=Ronn |title=Trump proposes rollback of 'dysfunctional' environmental rules |url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-proposes-environmental-law |website=Fox News |accessdate=January 9, 2920 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200109213404/https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-proposes-environmental-law |archive-date=January 9, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{YouTube|id=DX0MweF8JWo|title=Trump seeks to relax environmental regulation of some infrastructure projects}} January 9, 2020 [[PBS NewsHour]]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-administration-moves-to-limit-climate-reviews-for-federal-projects |title=Trump Administration Moves to Limit Climate Reviews for Federal Projects; The changes would underestimate the true contributions to global warming of fossil fuel infrastructure and other projects |author=[[E&E News]] |date=January 9, 2020 |website=[[Scientific American]] |access-date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200113225652/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-administration-moves-to-limit-climate-reviews-for-federal-projects/ |archive-date=January 13, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== Climate change ==\nAlthough in the [[scientific literature]] there is overwhelming [[scientific consensus]] that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases, neither Trump nor any of the department heads he has appointed believe that [[global warming]] is human-related.

Shortly after her appointment in May 2017, Beck rewrote, among others, the regulations covering the chemical, [[perfluorooctanoic acid]], or PFOA, which has been linked to many serious health problems.

The draft plan  includes requirements that water utilities disclose inventories of lead service pipes and requires that daycare centers and schools report elevated lead levels within 24 hours rather than the current standard of 30 days.  However, environmental activists are critical of the relaxation of other standards that have been proposed that slow the timetable for the replacement of lead pipes found to contain high levels of lead, extending the replacement time from 7 percent of lead service lines each year to just 3 percent.

In January 2020, Trump proposed changes in the [[Environmental impact statement]] process (EIS) as required by the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA), which was passed in 1969.  NEPA changed environmental oversight in the U.S. by requiring federal agencies  to consider whether a project would harm the air, land, water or wildlife.  Thus, NEPA has prevented federal agencies from dividing large projects into smaller chunks to make the environmental impact appear to be insignificant.  For example, the proposal for a forest road would require that the  impact of logging that it was built to accommodate be evaluated as well. NEPA also requires that the public be allowed to review and provide input on proposals. Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups have voiced concerns that Trump's proposals would gut environmental protections and remove the public's right to know and make comments of project's potential harms to the environment.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Blitzer |first1=Ronn |title=Trump proposes rollback of 'dysfunctional' environmental rules |url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-proposes-environmental-law |website=Fox News |accessdate=January 9, 2920 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200109213404/https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-proposes-environmental-law |archive-date=January 9, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{YouTube|id=DX0MweF8JWo|title=Trump seeks to relax environmental regulation of some infrastructure projects}} January 9, 2020 [[PBS NewsHour]]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-administration-moves-to-limit-climate-reviews-for-federal-projects |title=Trump Administration Moves to Limit Climate Reviews for Federal Projects; The changes would underestimate the true contributions to global warming of fossil fuel infrastructure and other projects |author=[[E&E News]] |date=January 9, 2020 |website=[[Scientific American]] |access-date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200113225652/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-administration-moves-to-limit-climate-reviews-for-federal-projects/ |archive-date=January 13, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== Climate change ==\nAlthough in the [[scientific literature]] there is overwhelming [[scientific consensus]] that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases, neither Trump nor any of the department heads he has appointed believe that [[global warming]] is human-related.

The plan's goal was to move away from coal and instead use renewable energy or gas to generate electricity, which would reduce particulate matter in the environment. \nOn March 1, 2017 [[Murray Energy|Murray Energy Corporation]] sent a letter to the Trump administration wherein they submitted an Action Plan [https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4345546/Murray-Energy-s-Action-Plan-for-the-Trump.pdf] \"which will help getting America's coal miners back to work.\"  They listed their suggestions in the order of priority, with doing away with Obama's Clean Power Plan at the top of the list.  Second was doing away with the \"endangerment finding\" in the Clean Air Act. \n[https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/epa-endangerment-finding-fs.pdf] The endangerment finding is the legal and scientific foundation for climate action.

Other suggestions included cutting back of EPA staffing to at least half.<ref name=\"documentcloud.org\"/>  On March 28, 2017, Trump signed an executive order to officially withdraw and rewrite Obama's Clean Power Plan in what he believes will revive the coal mining industry and remove what he considers to be a needless burden on the U.S. automotive industry.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/28/climate/trump-executive-order-climate-change.html|title=Trump Signs Executive Order Unwinding Obama Climate Policies|last=Davenport|first=Coral|date=March 28, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 30, 2017|last2=Rubin|first2=Alissa J.|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190426083756/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/28/climate/trump-executive-order-climate-change.html|archive-date=April 26, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/28/climate/trumps-executive-order-pushes-the-us-climate-pledge-further-out-of-reach.html|title=Trump's Executive Order Pushes the U.S. Climate Pledge Further Out of Reach|last=Popovich|first=Nadja|date=March 28, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 30, 2017|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329231151/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/28/climate/trumps-executive-order-pushes-the-us-climate-pledge-further-out-of-reach.html|archive-date=March 29, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> EPA staff emails obtained through a [[Freedom of Information Act]] request submitted by the [[Environmental Defense Fund]] in 2018 show that within days of Trump's announcement EPA director Scott Pruitt directed EPA staff to remove much of the climate change information from the agency's website and \"[modify] search results for 'Clean Power Plan' to feature a page touting Trump's executive order featuring a photo of the president posing with smiling coal miners, Pruitt and other members of his cabinet.\"\n<ref name=\"auto12\"/>\n\nIn May 2019, Administrator Andrew Wheeler announced plans to change the way the EPA calculates health risks of air pollution, resulting in the reporting of far fewer health-related deaths and making it easier to roll back the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan.

Administrator Wheeler defended the change as a way to rectify inconsistencies in the current cost-benefit analyses used by the agency. The new plan is known as the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule.

He designed \"SpongeBob's grumpy next door neighbor\" as an octopus because he liked the species' large head; octopuses, he said, \"have such a large bulbous head, and Squidward thinks he's an intellectual, so of course he's gonna have a large bulbous head.\"<ref name=\"Case\">Hillenburg, Stephen.

Hillenburg named the character Squidward after the [[squid]], which is closely related to the octopus and has ten limbs.

published an editorial criticizing what it said was the use of excessive force by the Japanese police against Korean citizens. This was the first in a string of suspensions. On 5 September 1920, three days after the first suspension was lifted, the newspaper published an editorial, \"Did the Japanese central governing body shut down our newspaper?\" Then, ''Chosun Ilbo'' was given an indefinite suspension.\n\nIn 1927, the ''Chosun Ilbo''{{'}}s editor and publisher were arrested. The editor was also the chief staff writer. The alleged offense in this case was an editorial describing the mistreatment of prisoners by the colonial government.

The publisher and chief staff writer, An Jae-hong, were again imprisoned.\n\nAfter these events, the ''Chosun Ilbo'' remained at the forefront of events, trying to improve general public life and sponsoring collaborative events. This was a turbulent period; within the space of three years, the president was replaced three times. On 21 December 1935, in opposition to compulsory Japanese education and plans to assimilate the Korean people and language, the ''Chosun Ilbo'' published 100,000 Korean-language textbooks nationwide. \n\nOver the years, the ''Chosun Ilbo'' company also published many additional titles, including a monthly current affairs magazine, ''Youth Chosun'', the first of its kind in Korea. Others included its sister publication, ''Jogwang''.\n\nIn July 31, 1940, the newspaper published \"Lessons of American Realism\", the fourth part of an editorial series.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Kim|first=Choon-Hee|title=Jamesian Cultural Anxiety in the East and West: The Co-Constitutive Nature of the Cosmopolite Spirit|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2020|isbn=1-5275-4199-1|location=Newcastle upon Tyne|pages=140}}</ref> Ten days later<ref name=\":1\" /> - following issue 6,923 - the paper was declared officially discontinued by the Japanese ruling government.

She brought home a total of 54,483 barrels of sperm whale oil and 152,934 pounds of whalebone. She sailed in the Indian and South Atlantic Oceans, surviving ice and snow storms. Her crew survived a cannibal attack in the South Pacific. She was based in San Francisco between 1888 and 1904.\n\nThe ''Morgan'' had more than 1,000 whalemen of all races and nationalities in her lifetime. Her crew included sailors from Cape Verde, New Zealand, the [[Seychelles]], Guadeloupe, and [[Norfolk Island]].  The ship's crew averaged around 33 men per voyage. As with other whaleships in the 19th century, the ''Morgan'' was often home to the captain's family. She was owned and managed by the [[J. & W. R.

Even so, she was open to the public and was the centerpiece of a recreated 19th century maritime village museum inspired by [[Colonial Williamsburg]].  She is the only preserved 19th century whaling ship in the world.\n\nThe Mystic Seaport undertook a restoration and preservation project in 1968 to make her seaworthy, and the sand bed was removed.  Prior to the 1968 restoration, she had a wide white stripe painted on her sides with large black squares that resembled gun ports when viewed at a distance.  This \"camouflage\" was often employed by 19th century merchant ships to make them resemble warships so as to deter pirates and hostile navies.\n\nIn 2010, Mystic Seaport engaged in a multimillion-dollar project to restore the ship to seaworthy status. She was re-launched into the Mystic River on July 21, 2013, marking the 172nd anniversary of the vessel's initial launch.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/17/science/17ship.html?_r=1&hp|title=A Quest to Make the Morgan Seaworthy|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|department=Science|date=16 August 2010|last=Broad|first=William J.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mysticseaport.org/visit/explore/morgan|title=Charles W Morgan - Mystic Seaport|website=[[Mystic Seaport Museum]]|accessdate=2013-06-22}}</ref><ref name=nyt2013>{{cite news |last=Bond |first=Michaelle |title=Museum Relaunches Wooden Whaler Built in 1841 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/nyregion/museum-relaunches-wooden-whaler-built-in-1841.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |department=N.Y. / Region |date=21 July 2013}}</ref> During the summer of 2014, she sailed her 38th voyage on tour of New England seaports which included [[New London, Connecticut]], [[Newport, Rhode Island]], [[Boston]], and her home town of New Bedford, Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theday.com/section/NWScwmorgan2014 |title=The 38th Voyage: Morgan readies to sail again |newspaper=[[The Day (New London)|The Day]] |date=May 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ship CW Morgan.jpg|thumb|right|250px|1971 U.S. commemorative stamp honoring ''Charles W.

The album was released [[Independent record label|independently]] by Cicierega on April 27, 2014. Consisting of mashups pairing [[Top 40 Mainstream|Top 40]] hits of the 1980s and 1990s along with [[Smash Mouth]]'s \"[[All Star (song)|All Star]]\", ''Mouth Sounds'' received positive reviews from music critics. It received a second installment, ''[[Mouth Silence]]'', months later, which followed the same mashup format, and a third installment in ''[[Mouth Moods]]'' in 2017.\n\n==Background==\n{{Quote box\n| quote  = \"When I decided to mash up Smash Mouth with John Lennon, of course I was thinking, \u2018This is super blasphemous, this is designed to make people angry.\u2019\"\n| source = \u2014Neil Cicierega explains his thinking behind the creation of the track \"Imagine All Star People\"<ref name=fast />\n| width  = 23%\n| align  = left\n| style  = padding:10px;\n}}\nCicierega began work on the album after discovering multiple raw instrument tracks from songs featured on the [[music video game]] series ''[[Rock Band]]''.<ref name=fast /> Because ''Rock Band'' requires players to control individual instruments for each track, all artists featured in ''Rock Band'' must provide the [[Stem (audio)|stems]] of each song featured in the game. With access to these tracks, Cicierega was able to create mashups of the provided songs. The process was mostly trial and error, where he paired songs together randomly, and kept what sounded good.<ref name=fast /> Cicierega tried to only pull popular songs, explaining \"If you're doing a comedy album with mashups, then you definitely want to use songs that people will recognize.\"<ref name=fast /> The purpose of the album was to make Cicierega laugh, but also to offend fans of the songs and artists he used in the album.\n\n''Mouth Sounds''{{'}} development dates as far back as early 2013, when the song \"No Credit Card\" (a remix of [[Huey Lewis and the News]]' \"[[The Power of Love (Huey Lewis and the News song)|The Power of Love]]\") appeared on Neil Cicierega's [[SoundCloud]] account on February 6, 2013.<ref name=credit>{{cite AV media |people=[[Neil Cicierega]] |year=2013 |title=No Credit Card |medium=audio |url=https://soundcloud.com/neilcic/no-credit-card |accessdate=November 6, 2014 |format=streamed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112110930/https://soundcloud.com/neilcic/no-credit-card |archive-date=November 12, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=neilTwit1>{{cite web |title= Tweet Number 496909166783766528 |url= https://twitter.com/neilyourself/status/496909166783766528 |first= Neil |last= Cicierega |date= 6 August 2014 |accessdate= 13 September 2015 |quote= people forget that Mouth Sounds is mostly just a compilation of joke songs I posted on tumblr over a couple year span |work= [[Twitter]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151112213236/https://twitter.com/neilyourself/status/496909166783766528 |archive-date= 12 November 2015 |url-status= live }}</ref> Over the following year, rougher edits of the songs \"Vivid Memories Turn to Fantasies,\" \"The Sharpest Tool,\" \"Modest Mouth,\" \"Imma Let It Be,\" \"Like Tears in Chocolate Rain,\" \"Melt Everyone,\" and \"Smooth Flow,\" would be uploaded to the same SoundCloud, with the final track, \"Mullet with Butterfly Wings,\" dropping just over a week before Mouth Sounds itself was released.<ref name=mullet>{{cite AV media |people=[[Neil Cicierega]] |year=2013 |title=Mullet With Butterfly Wings |medium=audio |url=https://soundcloud.com/neilcic/mullet-with-butterfly-wings |accessdate=November 6, 2014 |format=streamed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112111054/https://soundcloud.com/neilcic/mullet-with-butterfly-wings |archive-date=November 12, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> In addition, Cicierega posted a [[Music Video]] for \"The Sharpest Tool\" (titled \"MOUTH\") to his main [[YouTube]] channel a year earlier on February 9, 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAsPeY8BsQU|title=MOUTH|last=Cicierega|first=Neil|date=2013-02-09|website=YouTube|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>   \n\nWhile developing the prequel to ''Mouth Sounds'', Cicierega created a setting for both albums, concerning the existence of [[multiverse|parallel universes]]. In the universe with which ''Mouth Sounds'' lies, the band Smash Mouth exists, but not in the parallel universe created for ''[[Mouth Silence]]'' (which lacks any overt Smash Mouth-related mixes). In both universes, Cicierega delineated that a \"war of music\" continues on, explaining the reasoning behind the mashups.\n\nNumerous [[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]] have been found in the digital files for ''Mouth Sounds'' and ''Mouth Silence'' that each relate to \"All Star\". For example, when the metadata of every track on the former is viewed, the creation date of all the files is May 4, 1999 which was the release date of \"All Star.\" On the cover of the album, [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] can be seen on the glasses of Cicierega, referencing how \"All Star\" was used at the beginning of [[Shrek]].\n\n==Reception==\n''Mouth Sounds'' received mostly positive reviews from critics. Katie Rife, writing for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', called the mixtape \"brilliant,\" citing its ability to toy with the listener's nostalgia held towards the songs included, and wrapped up her review by suggesting the album to those that enjoy the thought of \"dropping acid at a [[Media Play]] going-out-of-business sale.\"<ref name=avclub>{{cite news|first=Katie|last=Rife|date=April 29, 2014|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/mouth-sounds-punishing-90s-nostalgia-mixtape-world-203927|title=\"Mouth Sounds\" is the punishing \u201990s nostalgia mixtape the world deserves|newspaper=[[The A.V.

The album was released [[Independent record label|independently]] by Cicierega on April 27, 2014. Consisting of mashups pairing [[Top 40 Mainstream|Top 40]] hits of the 1980s and 1990s along with [[Smash Mouth]]'s \"[[All Star (song)|All Star]]\", ''Mouth Sounds'' received positive reviews from music critics. It received a second installment, ''[[Mouth Silence]]'', months later, which followed the same mashup format, and a third installment in ''[[Mouth Moods]]'' in 2017.\n\n==Background==\n{{Quote box\n| quote  = \"When I decided to mash up Smash Mouth with John Lennon, of course I was thinking, \u2018This is super blasphemous, this is designed to make people angry.\u2019\"\n| source = \u2014Neil Cicierega explains his thinking behind the creation of the track \"Imagine All Star People\"<ref name=fast />\n| width  = 23%\n| align  = left\n| style  = padding:10px;\n}}\nCicierega began work on the album after discovering multiple raw instrument tracks from songs featured on the [[music video game]] series ''[[Rock Band]]''.<ref name=fast /> Because ''Rock Band'' requires players to control individual instruments for each track, all artists featured in ''Rock Band'' must provide the [[Stem (audio)|stems]] of each song featured in the game. With access to these tracks, Cicierega was able to create mashups of the provided songs. The process was mostly trial and error, where he paired songs together randomly, and kept what sounded good.<ref name=fast /> Cicierega tried to only pull popular songs, explaining \"If you're doing a comedy album with mashups, then you definitely want to use songs that people will recognize.\"<ref name=fast /> The purpose of the album was to make Cicierega laugh, but also to offend fans of the songs and artists he used in the album.\n\n''Mouth Sounds''{{'}} development dates as far back as early 2013, when the song \"No Credit Card\" (a remix of [[Huey Lewis and the News]]' \"[[The Power of Love (Huey Lewis and the News song)|The Power of Love]]\") appeared on Neil Cicierega's [[SoundCloud]] account on February 6, 2013.<ref name=credit>{{cite AV media |people=[[Neil Cicierega]] |year=2013 |title=No Credit Card |medium=audio |url=https://soundcloud.com/neilcic/no-credit-card |accessdate=November 6, 2014 |format=streamed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112110930/https://soundcloud.com/neilcic/no-credit-card |archive-date=November 12, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=neilTwit1>{{cite web |title= Tweet Number 496909166783766528 |url= https://twitter.com/neilyourself/status/496909166783766528 |first= Neil |last= Cicierega |date= 6 August 2014 |accessdate= 13 September 2015 |quote= people forget that Mouth Sounds is mostly just a compilation of joke songs I posted on tumblr over a couple year span |work= [[Twitter]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151112213236/https://twitter.com/neilyourself/status/496909166783766528 |archive-date= 12 November 2015 |url-status= live }}</ref> Over the following year, rougher edits of the songs \"Vivid Memories Turn to Fantasies,\" \"The Sharpest Tool,\" \"Modest Mouth,\" \"Imma Let It Be,\" \"Like Tears in Chocolate Rain,\" \"Melt Everyone,\" and \"Smooth Flow,\" would be uploaded to the same SoundCloud, with the final track, \"Mullet with Butterfly Wings,\" dropping just over a week before Mouth Sounds itself was released.<ref name=mullet>{{cite AV media |people=[[Neil Cicierega]] |year=2013 |title=Mullet With Butterfly Wings |medium=audio |url=https://soundcloud.com/neilcic/mullet-with-butterfly-wings |accessdate=November 6, 2014 |format=streamed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112111054/https://soundcloud.com/neilcic/mullet-with-butterfly-wings |archive-date=November 12, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> In addition, Cicierega posted a [[Music Video]] for \"The Sharpest Tool\" (titled \"MOUTH\") to his main [[YouTube]] channel a year earlier on February 9, 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAsPeY8BsQU|title=MOUTH|last=Cicierega|first=Neil|date=2013-02-09|website=YouTube|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>   \n\nWhile developing the prequel to ''Mouth Sounds'', Cicierega created a setting for both albums, concerning the existence of [[multiverse|parallel universes]]. In the universe with which ''Mouth Sounds'' lies, the band Smash Mouth exists, but not in the parallel universe created for ''[[Mouth Silence]]'' (which lacks any overt Smash Mouth-related mixes). In both universes, Cicierega delineated that a \"war of music\" continues on, explaining the reasoning behind the mashups.\n\nNumerous [[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]] have been found in the digital files for ''Mouth Sounds'' and ''Mouth Silence'' that each relate to \"All Star\". For example, when the metadata of every track on the former is viewed, the creation date of all the files is May 4, 1999 which was the release date of \"All Star.\" On the cover of the album, [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] can be seen on the glasses of Cicierega, referencing how \"All Star\" was used at the beginning of [[Shrek]].\n\n==Reception==\n''Mouth Sounds'' received mostly positive reviews from critics. Katie Rife, writing for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', called the mixtape \"brilliant,\" citing its ability to toy with the listener's nostalgia held towards the songs included, and wrapped up her review by suggesting the album to those that enjoy the thought of \"dropping acid at a [[Media Play]] going-out-of-business sale.\"<ref name=avclub>{{cite news|first=Katie|last=Rife|date=April 29, 2014|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/mouth-sounds-punishing-90s-nostalgia-mixtape-world-203927|title=\"Mouth Sounds\" is the punishing \u201990s nostalgia mixtape the world deserves|newspaper=[[The A.V.

It is also connected with the concepts of [[Advice (opinion)|advice]], [[persuasion]], [[deliberation]], and [[Prohibitionism|prohibition]]. Traditionally, only actions that are freely [[Will (philosophy)|willed]] are seen as deserving credit or blame. There are numerous different concerns about threats to the possibility of free will, varying by how exactly it is conceived, which is a matter of some debate.\n\nSome conceive free will to be the capacity to make choices in which the outcome has not been determined by past events. [[Determinism]] suggests that only one course of events is possible, which is inconsistent with the existence of free will thus conceived.<ref name=\"Baumeister, R.F 2014. pp. 1-52\">Baumeister, R.F. and Monroe, A.E., 2014.

Academic Press.</ref> [[Ancient Greek philosophy]] identified this issue,<ref name=bobzien1998determinism /> which remains a major focus of philosophical debate. The view that conceives free will as incompatible with determinism is called ''[[incompatibilism]]'' and encompasses both [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|metaphysical libertarianism]] (the claim that determinism is false and thus free will is at least possible) and [[hard determinism]] (the claim that determinism is true and thus free will is not possible). Incompatibilism also encompasses [[hard incompatibilism]], which holds not only determinism but also its negation to be incompatible with free will and thus free will to be impossible whatever the case may be regarding determinism.\n\nIn contrast, [[compatibilism|compatibilists]] hold that free will ''is'' compatible with determinism. Some compatibilists even hold that determinism is ''necessary'' for free will, arguing that choice involves preference for one course of action over another, requiring a sense of ''how'' choices will turn out.<ref name=Carnap>An argument by [[Rudolph Carnap]] described by: {{cite book |title= Research In Psychology: Methods and Design |author= C.

Classical compatibilists considered free will nothing more than freedom of action, considering one free of will simply if, ''had'' one counterfactually wanted to do otherwise, one ''could'' have done otherwise without physical impediment. Contemporary compatibilists instead identify free will as a psychological capacity, such as to direct one's behavior in a way responsive to reason, and there are still further different conceptions of free will, each with their own concerns, sharing only the common feature of not finding the possibility of determinism a threat to the possibility of free will.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/compatibilism/\n|title= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n|first1= Michael|last1= McKenna|first2= D.

In contrast, \"[[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|metaphysical libertarians]]\", such as [[Thomas Reid]], [[Peter van Inwagen]], and [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]], are those incompatibilists who accept free will and deny determinism, holding the view that some form of indeterminism is true.<ref name=\"Wagen\">van Invagen, P. (1983) ''An Essay on Free Will''. Oxford: [[Clarendon Press]]. {{ISBN|0-19-824924-1}}</ref> Another view is that of hard incompatibilists, which state that free will is incompatible with both [[determinism]] and [[indeterminism]].<ref name=\"Derk1\">{{cite book |author=Pereboom, D. |year=2003 |title=Living without Free Will |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9sKZ1rAO2BwC&printsec=frontcover |isbn=978-0-521-79198-4}}</ref>\n\nTraditional arguments for incompatibilism are based on an \"[[intuition pump]]\": if a person is like other mechanical things that are determined in their behavior such as a wind-up toy, a billiard ball, a puppet, or a robot, then people must not have free will.<ref name=\"Wagen\"/><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Fischer | first1 = J.M. | year = 1983 | title = Incompatibilism | url = | journal = Philosophical Studies | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 121\u201337 | doi = 10.1007/BF01112527 }}</ref> This argument has been rejected by compatibilists such as Daniel Dennett on the grounds that, even if humans have something in common with these things, it remains possible and plausible that we are different from such objects in important ways.<ref name=\"DD1\"/>\n\nAnother argument for incompatibilism is that of the \"causal chain\". Incompatibilism is key to the idealist theory of free will. Most incompatibilists reject the idea that freedom of action consists simply in \"voluntary\" behavior. They insist, rather, that free will means that man must be the \"ultimate\" or \"originating\" cause of his actions. He must be ''[[causa sui]]'', in the traditional phrase. Being responsible for one's choices is the first cause of those choices, where first cause means that there is no antecedent cause of that cause. The argument, then, is that if man has free will, then man is the ultimate cause of his actions. If determinism is true, then all of man's choices are caused by events and facts outside his control. So, if everything man does is caused by events and facts outside his control, then he cannot be the ultimate cause of his actions. Therefore, he cannot have free will.<ref>Kane, R.

The simplified argument runs along these lines: if determinism is true, then we have no control over the events of the past that determined our present state and no control over the laws of nature. Since we can have no control over these matters, we also can have no control over the ''consequences'' of them. Since our present choices and acts, under determinism, are the necessary consequences of the past and the laws of nature, then we have no control over them and, hence, no free will. This is called the ''consequence argument''.<ref>Ginet, C. (1966) \"Might We Have No Choice?\" In Lehrer, 1966: 87\u2013104.</ref><ref name=\"Ving\">Van Inwagen, P. and Zimmerman, D. (1998) ''Metaphysics: The Big Questions''. Oxford: Blackwell</ref> Peter van Inwagen remarks that C.D. Broad had a version of the consequence argument as early as the 1930s.<ref>Inwagen, P. (n.d.) [http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/HowThinkFW.doc \"How to think about free will\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911064556/http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/HowThinkFW.doc |date=2008-09-11 }}, p. 15.</ref>\n\nThe difficulty of this argument for some compatibilists lies in the fact that it entails the impossibility that one could have chosen other than one has. For example, if Jane is a compatibilist and she has just sat down on the sofa, then she is committed to the claim that she could have remained standing, if she had so desired. But it [[Logical consequence|follows from]] the consequence argument that, if Jane had remained standing, she would have either generated a contradiction, violated the laws of nature or changed the past. Hence, compatibilists are committed to the existence of \"incredible abilities\", according to Ginet and van Inwagen. One response to this argument is that it equivocates on the notions of abilities and necessities, or that the free will evoked to make any given choice is really an illusion and the choice had been made all along, oblivious to its \"decider\".<ref name=\"Ving\"/> [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] suggests that compatibilists are only committed to the ability to do something otherwise if ''different circumstances'' had actually obtained in the past.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1755-2567.1981.tb00473.x | last1 = Lewis | first1 = D. | year = 2008| title = Are We Free to Break the Laws? | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1c8564b3a6ed399580cca8ffc2ae8ab6dd27d464| journal = Theoria | volume = 47 | issue = 3| pages = 113\u201321 }}</ref>\n\nUsing ''T'', ''F'' for \"true\" and \"false\" and ''?'' for undecided, there are exactly nine positions regarding determinism/free will that consist of any two of these three possibilities:<ref name=Strawson>\n{{cite book |title=Freedom and belief |author= Strawson, Galen|page=6 |isbn=978-0-19-924750-9 |edition=Revised |year=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}\n</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:50%;\"\n|+Galen Strawson's table<ref name=Strawson/>\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"col\" | 1\n! scope=\"col\" | 2\n! scope=\"col\" | 3\n! scope=\"col\" | 4\n! scope=\"col\" | 5\n! scope=\"col\" | 6\n! scope=\"col\" | 7\n! scope=\"col\" | 8\n! scope=\"col\" | 9\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Determinism ''D''\n|T\n|F\n|T\n|F\n|T\n|F\n|?\n|?\n|?\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Free will ''FW''\n|F\n|T\n|T\n|F\n|?\n|?\n|F\n|T\n|?\n|-\n|}\n''Incompatibilism'' may occupy any of the nine positions except (5), (8) or (3), which last corresponds to ''soft determinism''. Position (1) is ''hard determinism'', and position (2) is ''libertarianism''. The position (1) of hard determinism adds to the table the contention that ''D'' implies ''FW'' is untrue, and the position (2) of libertarianism adds the contention that ''FW'' implies ''D'' is untrue. Position (9) may be called ''hard incompatibilism'' if one interprets ''?'' as meaning both concepts are of dubious value. ''Compatibilism'' itself may occupy any of the nine positions, that is, there is no logical contradiction between determinism and free will, and either or both may be true or false in principle. However, the most common meaning attached to ''compatibilism'' is that some form of determinism is true and yet we have some form of free will, position (3).<ref name=FischerFour2009>{{cite book |pages=44 ''ff'' |author= Fischer, John Martin |title=Four Views on Free Will (Great Debates in Philosophy) |isbn=978-1-4051-3486-6 |year=2009 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |chapter=Chapter 2: Compatibilism}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Toppledominos.jpg|thumb|A [[domino effect|domino's movement]] is [[Determinism|determined]] completely by laws of physics.]]\n[[Alexander Rosenberg|Alex Rosenberg]] makes an extrapolation of physical determinism as inferred on the macroscopic scale by the behaviour of a set of dominoes to neural activity in the brain where; \"If the brain is nothing but a complex physical object whose states are as much governed by physical laws as any other physical object, then what goes on in our heads is as fixed and determined by prior events as what goes on when one domino topples another in a long row of them.\"<ref name=Rosenberg>\n{{cite book |title=Philosophy Of Science: A Contemporary Introduction |author=Alex Rosenberg |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OenUbcvgoi4C&pg=PA8 |page=8 |isbn=978-0-415-34317-6 |year=2005 |edition=2nd |publisher=Psychology Press}}\n</ref> [[Determinism#Quantum mechanics and classical physics|Physical determinism]] is currently disputed by prominent [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretations]] of [[quantum mechanics]], and while not necessarily representative of intrinsic [[indeterminism]] in nature, fundamental limits of precision in measurement are inherent in the [[uncertainty principle]].<ref name=\"Bohr1\"/> The relevance of such prospective indeterminate activity to free will is, however, contested,<ref name=\"Bohr\"/> even when chaos theory is introduced to magnify the effects of such microscopic events.<ref name=\"RKane1\"/><ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1142/S0219635206001112 | pmid=16783870 | last=Lewis | first=E.R. |author2=MacGregor, R.J. | year=2006 | title=On Indeterminism, Chaos, and Small Number Particle Systems in the Brain | journal=[[Journal of Integrative Neuroscience]] | volume=5 | issue=2 | pages=223\u201347 |url=http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~lewis/LewisMacGregor.pdf | citeseerx=10.1.1.361.7065 }}</ref>\n\nBelow these positions are examined in more detail.<ref name=Strawson/>\n\n====Hard determinism====\n{{main|Hard determinism}}\n[[File:FreeWillTaxonomy4.svg|thumb|A simplified [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of philosophical positions regarding free will and determinism.]]\n\nDeterminism can be divided into causal, logical and theological determinism.<ref name=\"Parkinson2012\">{{cite encyclopaedia|author=G.H.R.

Libertarianism holds onto a concept of free will that requires that the [[agency (philosophy)|agent]] be able to take more than one possible course of action under a given set of circumstances.\n\nAccounts of libertarianism subdivide into non-physical theories and physical or naturalistic theories. Non-physical theories hold that the events in the brain that lead to the performance of actions do not have an entirely physical explanation, which requires that the world is not closed under physics. This includes [[interactionist dualism]], which claims that some non-physical [[mind]], will, or [[soul]] overrides physical [[causality]]. Physical determinism implies there is only one possible future and is therefore not compatible with libertarian free will. As consequent of incompatibilism, metaphysical libertarian explanations that do not involve dispensing with [[physicalism]] require physical indeterminism, such as probabilistic subatomic particle behavior&nbsp;\u2013 theory unknown to many of the early writers on free will. Incompatibilist theories can be categorised based on the type of indeterminism they require; uncaused events, non-deterministically caused events, and agent/substance-caused events.<ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Randolph |first=Clarke |editor=Edward N.

They either rely upon a world that is not causally closed, or physical indeterminism. Non-causal accounts often claim that each intentional action requires a choice or volition&nbsp;\u2013 a willing, trying, or endeavoring on behalf of the agent (such as the cognitive component of lifting one's arm).<ref name=LumerNannini2007>{{cite book|author1=Christoph Lumer|author2=Sandro Nannini|title=Intentionality, Deliberation and Autonomy: The Action-Theoretic Basis of Practical Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4LzldxvSk4kC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-6058-3}}</ref><ref name=McCann1998>{{cite book|author=Hugh McCann|title=The Works of Agency: On Human Action, Will, and Freedom|url=https://archive.org/details/worksofagencyonh00mcca_0|url-access=registration|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1998|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8583-1}}</ref> Such intentional actions are interpreted as free actions. It has been suggested, however, that such acting cannot be said to exercise control over anything in particular. According to non-causal accounts, the causation by the agent cannot be analysed in terms of causation by mental states or events, including desire, belief, intention of something in particular, but rather is considered a matter of spontaneity and creativity. The exercise of intent in such intentional actions is not that which determines their freedom&nbsp;\u2013 intentional actions are rather self-generating. The \"actish feel\" of some intentional actions do not \"constitute that event's activeness, or the agent's exercise of active control\", rather they \"might be brought about by direct stimulation of someone's brain, in the absence of any relevant desire or intention on the part of that person\".<ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories /> Another question raised by such non-causal theory, is how an agent acts upon reason, if the said intentional actions are spontaneous.\n\nSome non-causal explanations involve invoking [[panpsychism]], the theory that a quality of [[mind]] is associated with all particles, and pervades the entire universe, in both animate and inanimate entities.\n\n====Event-causal theories====\nEvent-causal accounts of incompatibilist free will typically rely upon physicalist models of mind (like those of the compatibilist), yet they presuppose physical indeterminism, in which certain indeterministic events are said to be caused by the agent. A number of event-causal accounts of free will have been created, referenced here as ''deliberative indeterminism'', ''centred accounts'', and ''efforts of will theory''.<ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories /> The first two accounts do not require free will to be a fundamental constituent of the universe. Ordinary randomness is appealed to as supplying the \"elbow room\" that libertarians believe necessary. A first common objection to event-causal accounts is that the indeterminism could be destructive and could therefore diminish control by the agent rather than provide it (related to the problem of origination). A second common objection to these models is that it is questionable whether such indeterminism could add any value to deliberation over that which is already present in a deterministic world.\n\n''Deliberative indeterminism'' asserts that the indeterminism is confined to an earlier stage in the decision process.<ref name=Ekstrom2000>{{cite book|author=Laura Waddell Ekstrom|title=Free Will: A Philosophical Study|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oaOpa7qlz3kC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=2000|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-9093-2}}</ref><ref name=Mele2006>{{cite book|author=Alfred R.

Models of [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] have been constructed in which it is seen as a particular kind of complex, high-level process with an element of physical indeterminism.

It is also required that the agent's causing of that event is not causally determined by prior events. A number of problems have been identified with this view. Firstly, it is difficult to establish the reason for any given choice by the agent, which suggests they may be random or determined by ''luck'' (without an underlying basis for the free will decision). Secondly, it has been questioned whether physical events can be caused by an external substance or mind&nbsp;\u2013 a common problem associated with [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|interactionalist dualism]].\n\n====Hard incompatibilism====\nHard incompatibilism is the idea that free will cannot exist, whether the world is deterministic or not. [[Derk Pereboom (philosopher)|Derk Pereboom]] has defended hard incompatibilism, identifying a variety of positions where free will is irrelevant to indeterminism/determinism, among them the following:\n:#Determinism (D) is true, D does not imply we lack free will (F), but in fact we do lack F.\n:#D is true, D does not imply we lack F, but in fact we don't know if we have F.\n:#D is true, and we do have F.\n:#D is true, we have F, and F implies D.\n:#D is unproven, but we have F.\n:#D isn't true, we do have F, and would have F even if D were true.\n:#D isn't true, we don't have F, but F is compatible with D.\n::::::Derk Pereboom, ''Living without Free Will'',<ref name=\"Derk1\"/> p. xvi.\nPereboom calls positions 3 and 4 ''soft determinism'', position 1 a form of ''hard determinism'', position 6 a form of ''classical libertarianism'', and any position that includes having F as ''compatibilism''.\n\n[[John Locke]] denied that the phrase \"free will\" made any sense (compare with [[theological noncognitivism]], a similar stance on the [[existence of God]]). He also took the view that the truth of determinism was irrelevant. He believed that the defining feature of voluntary behavior was that individuals have the ability to ''postpone'' a decision long enough to reflect or deliberate upon the consequences of a choice: \"... the will in truth, signifies nothing but a power, or ability, to prefer or choose\".<ref>Locke, J. (1689). ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1998, ed). Book II, Chap. XXI, Sec. 17. Penguin Classics, Toronto.</ref>\n\nThe contemporary philosopher [[Galen Strawson]] agrees with Locke that the truth or falsity of determinism is irrelevant to the\nproblem.<ref name=\"GStraw\">Strawson, G. (1998, 2004). \"Free will\". In E. Craig (ed.), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. London: Routledge.

But it is impossible for one to be responsible for the way one is in any respect. This is because to be responsible in some situation ''S'', one must have been responsible for the way one was at ''S<sup>\u22121</sup>''. To be responsible for the way one was at ''S<sup>\u22121</sup>'', one must have been responsible for the way one was at ''S<sup>\u22122</sup>'', and so on. At some point in the chain, there must have been an act of origination of a new causal chain. But this is impossible. Man cannot create himself or his mental states ''[[ex nihilo]]''. This argument entails that free will itself is absurd, but not that it is incompatible with determinism. Strawson calls his own view \"pessimism\" but it can be classified as [[hard incompatibilism]].<ref name=\"GStraw\"/>\n\n===== Causal determinism =====\n{{Main|Determinism}}\n\nCausal determinism is the concept that [[Event (philosophy)|events]] within a given [[paradigm]] are bound by [[causality]] in such a way that any state (of an object or event) is completely determined by prior states. Causal determinism proposes that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe. Causal determinists believe that there is nothing uncaused or [[Causa sui|self-caused]]. The most common form of causal determinism is nomological determinism (or scientific determinism), the notion that the past and the present dictate the future entirely and necessarily by rigid natural laws, that every occurrence results inevitably from prior events. [[Quantum mechanics]] poses a serious challenge to this view.\n\nFundamental debate continues over whether the physical universe is likely to be [[causal determinism|deterministic]]. Although the scientific method cannot be used to rule out [[indeterminism]] with respect to violations of [[causal closure]], it can be used to identify indeterminism in natural law. [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics]] at present are both [[deterministic system|deterministic]] and [[indeterminism|indeterministic]], and are being constrained by ongoing experimentation.<ref name=GroblacherPaterek2007>{{cite journal|last1=Groblacher|first1=Simon|last2=Paterek|first2=Tomasz|last3=Kaltenbaek|first3=Rainer|last4=Brukner|first4=Caslav|last5=Zukowski|first5=Marek|last6=Aspelmeyer|first6=Markus|last7=Zeilinger|first7=Anton|title=An experimental test of non-local realism|journal=Nature|volume=446|issue=7138|year=2007|pages=871\u201375|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/nature05677|pmid=17443179|arxiv=0704.2529|bibcode=2007Natur.446..871G}}</ref>\n\n===== Destiny and fate =====\n{{Main|Destiny}}\n\nDestiny or fate is a predetermined course of events. It may be conceived as a predetermined future, whether in general or of an individual. It is a concept based on the belief that there is a fixed natural order to the cosmos.\n\nAlthough often used interchangeably, the words \"fate\" and \"destiny\" have distinct connotations.\n\n[[Fate]] generally implies there is a set course that cannot be deviated from, and over which one has no control. Fate is related to [[determinism]], but makes no specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be fated externally (see for instance [[theological determinism]]). Destiny likewise is related to determinism, but makes no specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be destined to occur.\n\n[[Destiny]] implies there is a set course that cannot be deviated from, but does not of itself make any claim with respect to the setting of that course (i.e., it does not necessarily conflict with [[incompatibilist]] free will). Free will if existent could be the mechanism by which that destined outcome is chosen (determined to represent destiny).<ref name=\"Blackwell2011\">{{cite book|author=Ben C.

Logical [[determinism]] or determinateness is the notion that all propositions, whether about the past, present, or future, are either true or false. This creates a unique problem for free will given that propositions about the future already have a truth value in the present (that is it is already determined as either true or false), and is referred to as the [[problem of future contingents]].\n\n===== Omniscience =====\n{{Main|Omniscience}}\n\n[[Omniscience]] is the capacity to know everything that there is to know (included in which are all future events), and is a property often attributed to a creator deity. Omniscience implies the existence of destiny. Some authors have claimed that free will cannot coexist with omniscience. One argument asserts that an omniscient creator not only implies destiny but a form of high level [[predeterminism]] such as hard [[theological determinism]] or [[predestination]]&nbsp;\u2013 that they have independently fixed all events and outcomes in the universe in advance. In such a case, even if an individual could have influence over their lower level physical system, their choices in regard to this cannot be their own, as is the case with libertarian free will. Omniscience features as an [[incompatible-properties argument]] for the existence of [[God]], known as the [[argument from free will]], and is closely related to other such arguments, for example the incompatibility of [[omnipotence]] with a good creator deity (i.e. if a deity knew what they were going to choose, then they are responsible for letting them choose it).\n\n=====Predeterminism=====\n{{Main|Predeterminism}}\n{{See also|Predestination}}\n\n[[Predeterminism]] is the idea that all events are determined in advance.<ref name=\"McKewan\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=McKewan |first=Jaclyn |editor=H.

The concept of predeterminism is often argued by invoking [[causal determinism]], implying that there is an unbroken [[chain of prior occurrences]] stretching back to the origin of the universe. In the case of predeterminism, this chain of events has been pre-established, and human actions cannot interfere with the outcomes of this pre-established chain. Predeterminism can be used to mean such pre-established causal determinism, in which case it is categorised as a specific type of [[determinism]].<ref name=\"McKewan\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/notes-determinism.html |title=Some Varieties of Free Will and Determinism |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=10 September 2009 <!-- date found by checking page's source code where format of date given as m.d.y -->|work=Philosophy 302: Ethics |publisher=philosophy.lander.edu |accessdate=19 December 2012| quote=Predeterminism: the philosophical and theological view that combines God with determinism.

It claims that free will does not exist, and ''God'' has absolute control over a person's actions. Hard theological determinism is similar in implication to [[hard determinism]], although it does not invalidate [[compatibilism|compatibilist]] free will.<ref name=stanfordforeknowledge /> Hard theological determinism is a form of theological incompatibilism (see figure, top left).\n* Weak theological determinism is either compatible or incompatible with metaphysical libertarian free will depending upon one's philosophical interpretation of [[omniscience]]&nbsp;\u2013 and as such is interpreted as either a form of hard theological determinism (known as [[theological fatalism]]), or as ''soft theological determinism'' (terminology used for clarity only). Soft theological determinism claims that humans have free will to choose their actions, holding that God, while [[omniscience|knowing their actions before they happen]], does not affect the outcome. God's providence is \"compatible\" with voluntary choice. Soft theological determinism is known as theological compatibilism (see figure, top right). A rejection of theological determinism (or [[omniscience|divine foreknowledge]]) is classified as theological incompatibilism also (see figure, bottom), and is relevant to a more general discussion of free will.<ref name=\"stanfordforeknowledge\"/>\n\nThe basic argument for theological fatalism in the case of weak theological determinism is as follows:\n# Assume divine foreknowledge or [[omniscience]]\n# [[infallibility|Infallible]] foreknowledge implies destiny (it is known for certain what one will do)\n# Destiny eliminates alternate possibility (one cannot do otherwise)\n# Assert incompatibility with metaphysical libertarian free will\n\nThis argument is very often accepted as a basis for theological incompatibilism: denying either libertarian free will or divine foreknowledge (omniscience) and therefore theological determinism. On the other hand, theological compatibilism must attempt to find problems with it. The formal version of the argument rests on a number of premises, many of which have received some degree of contention. Theological compatibilist responses have included:\n* Deny the truth value of [[Problem of future contingents|future contingents]], although this denies foreknowledge and therefore theological determinism.\n* Assert differences in non-temporal knowledge (space-time independence), an approach taken for example by [[Boethius]],<ref>{{cite book | author=Boethius | title=The Consolation of Philosophy | chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/theconsolationof14328gut | chapter=Book V, Prose vi}}</ref> [[Thomas Aquinas]],<ref>{{cite book | author=Aquinas, St. Thomas | title=Summa Theologica | chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.126741 | chapter=Ia, q. 14, art 13.}} See [[Summa Theologica]]</ref> and [[C.S.

By the same principle, metaphysical libertarianism (a form of incompatibilism with respect to physical determinism) might be classified as compatibilism with respect to theological determinism (if it was assumed such free will events were pre-ordained and therefore were destined to occur, but of which whose outcomes were not \"predestined\" or determined by God). If hard theological determinism is accepted (if it was assumed instead that such outcomes were predestined by God), then metaphysical libertarianism is not, however, possible, and would require reclassification (as hard incompatibilism for example, given that the universe is still assumed to be indeterministic&nbsp;\u2013 although the classification of hard determinism is technically valid also).<ref name=VanArragon2010 />\n\n=====Mind-body problem=====\n{{Main|Mind\u2013body problem}}\n{{See also|Philosophy of mind|Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Monism|Physicalism}}\n[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van Ren\u00e9 Descartes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]]]]\n\nThe idea of ''free will'' is one aspect of the [[Mind\u2013body problem|mind-body problem]], that is, consideration of the relation between [[mind]] (for example, consciousness, memory, and judgment) and body (for example, the [[human brain]] and [[nervous system]]). [[Philosophy of Mind|Philosophical models of mind]] are divided into [[Physicalism|physical]] and non-physical expositions.\n\n[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Substance dualism|Cartesian dualism]] holds that the mind is a nonphysical substance, the seat of consciousness and intelligence, and is not identical with physical states of the brain or body. It is suggested that although the two worlds do interact, each retains some measure of autonomy. Under cartesian dualism external mind is responsible for bodily action, although unconscious brain activity is often caused by external events (for example, the instantaneous reaction to being burned).<ref name=Peruzzi>See for example: {{cite book |title=Mind and Causality |chapter=Chapter 5: Mental causation and intentionality in a mind naturalizing theory |author=Sandro Nannini |editor=Alberto Peruzzi |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zYEPifPTQK4C&pg=PA75&lpg=PA77 |pages=69 ''ff'' |isbn=978-1-58811-475-4 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |year=2004}}</ref> Cartesian dualism implies that the physical world is not deterministic&nbsp;\u2013 and in which external mind controls (at least some) physical events, providing an interpretation of [[incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] free will. Stemming from Cartesian dualism, a formulation sometimes called ''[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Interactionism|interactionalist dualism]]'' suggests a two-way interaction, that some physical events cause some mental acts and some mental acts cause some physical events. One modern vision of the possible separation of mind and body is the [[Popper's three worlds|\"three-world\" formulation]] of [[Karl Popper|Popper]].<ref name=Popper>{{cite book |title=All Life is Problem Solving |chapter=Notes of a realist on the body-mind problem |author=Karl Raimund Popper |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pa3cZYwdq28C&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23 |pages=23 ''ff'' |isbn=978-0-415-17486-2 |year=1999 |publisher=Psychology Press |quote=The body-mind relationship...includes the problem of man's position in the physical world...'World 1'.

Other forms of epistemological pluralist dualism include [[psychophysical parallelism]] and [[epiphenomenalism]]. Epistemological pluralism is one view in which the mind-body problem is ''not'' reducible to the concepts of the natural sciences.\n\nA contrasting approach is called [[physicalism]]. Physicalism is a [[philosophical theory]] holding that everything that [[existence|exists]] is no more extensive than its [[physical properties]]; that is, that there are no non-physical substances (for example physically independent minds). Physicalism can be reductive or non-reductive. [[Reductive physicalism]] is grounded in the idea that everything in the world can actually be reduced analytically to its fundamental physical, or material, basis. Alternatively, [[non-reductive physicalism]] asserts that mental properties form a separate ontological class to physical properties: that mental states (such as [[qualia]]) are not ontologically reducible to physical states. Although one might suppose that mental states and neurological states are different in kind, that does not rule out the possibility that mental states are correlated with neurological states. In one such construction, [[anomalous monism]], mental events [[Supervenience|''supervene'']] on physical events, describing the [[emergence]] of mental properties correlated with physical properties&nbsp;\u2013 implying causal reducibility. Non-reductive physicalism is therefore often categorised as [[property dualism]] rather than [[monism]], yet other types of property dualism do not adhere to the causal reducibility of mental states (see epiphenomenalism).\n\n[[Incompatibilism]] requires a distinction between the mental and the physical, being a commentary on the incompatibility of (determined) physical reality and one's presumably distinct experience of will. Secondarily, [[metaphysical libertarianism|metaphysical libertarian]] free will must assert influence on physical reality, and where mind is responsible for such influence (as opposed to ordinary system randomness), it must be distinct from body to accomplish this. Both substance and property dualism offer such a distinction, and those particular models thereof that are not causally inert with respect to the physical world provide a basis for illustrating incompatibilist free will (i.e. interactionalist dualism and non-reductive physicalism).\n\nIt has been noted that the [[Physical law|laws of physics]] have yet to resolve the [[hard problem of consciousness]]:<ref name=Kalat>\nSee {{cite web |title=The hard problem of consciousness |author=Josh Weisberg |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hard-con/ |encyclopedia=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}} or {{cite book |title=Consciousness: \u00a79.9 Non-physical theories |chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness/#NonPhyThe |author=Robert Van Gulick |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2014 Edition) |editor=Edward N.

They believe freedom can be present or absent in a situation for reasons that have nothing to do with metaphysics. For instance, [[courts of law]] make judgments about whether individuals are acting under their own free will under certain circumstances without bringing in metaphysics. Similarly, [[political liberty]] is a non-metaphysical concept.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Likewise, some compatibilists define free will as freedom to act according to one's determined motives without hindrance from other individuals. So for example Aristotle in his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'',<ref>Susan Sauve Meyer, ''Aristotle on Moral Responsibility.'', Oxford 2012</ref> and the Stoic Chrysippus.<ref>[[Susanne Bobzien|Bobzien, Susanne]], ''Freedom and Determinism in Stoic Philosophy'', Oxford 1998, Chapter 6.</ref>\nIn contrast, the [[incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] positions are concerned with a sort of \"metaphysically free will\", which compatibilists claim has never been coherently defined. Compatibilists argue that determinism does not matter; though they disagree among themselves about what, in turn, ''does'' matter. To be a compatibilist, one need not endorse any particular conception of free will, but only deny that determinism is at odds with free will.<ref name=\"CompSEP\">McKenna, Michael, \"Compatibilism\", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2004 Edition), Edward N.

Freedom of choice (freedom to select one's will) is logically separate from freedom to ''implement'' that choice (freedom to enact one's will), although not all writers observe this distinction.<ref name=\"OConnor\"/> Nonetheless, some philosophers have defined free will as the absence of various impediments. Some \"modern compatibilists\", such as [[Harry Frankfurt]] and [[Daniel Dennett]], argue free will is simply freely choosing to do what constraints allow one to do.

The idea is that an individual can have conflicting desires at a first-order level and also have a desire about the various first-order desires (a second-order desire) to the effect that one of the desires prevails over the others. A person's will is identified with their effective first-order desire, that is, the one they act on, and this will is free if it was the desire the person wanted to act upon, that is, the person's second-order desire was effective. So, for example, there are \"wanton addicts\", \"unwilling addicts\" and \"willing addicts\". All three groups may have the conflicting first-order desires to want to take the drug they are addicted to and to not want to take it.\n\nThe first group, ''wanton addicts'', have no second-order desire not to take the drug. The second group, \"unwilling addicts\", have a second-order desire not to take the drug, while the third group, \"willing addicts\", have a second-order desire to take it. According to Frankfurt, the members of the first group are devoid of will and therefore are no longer persons. The members of the second group freely desire not to take the drug, but their will is overcome by the addiction. Finally, the members of the third group willingly take the drug they are addicted to. Frankfurt's theory can ramify to any number of levels. Critics of the theory point out that there is no certainty that conflicts will not arise even at the higher-order levels of desire and preference.<ref>Watson, D. (1982). ''Free Will''. New York: Oxford University Press.</ref> Others argue that Frankfurt offers no adequate explanation of how the various levels in the hierarchy mesh together.<ref>Fischer, John Martin, and Mark Ravizza.

(2003) ''Freedom Evolves''. Viking Books. {{ISBN|0-670-03186-0}}</ref> The basic reasoning is that, if one excludes God, an infinitely powerful [[demon]], and other such possibilities, then because of [[chaos theory|chaos]] and epistemic limits on the precision of our knowledge of the current state of the world, the future is ill-defined for all finite beings. The only well-defined things are \"expectations\". The ability to do \"otherwise\" only makes sense when dealing with these expectations, and not with some unknown and unknowable future.\n\nAccording to Dennett, because individuals have the ability to act differently from what anyone expects, free will can exist.<ref name=\"DD2\"/> Incompatibilists claim the problem with this idea is that we may be mere \"automata responding in predictable ways to stimuli in our environment\". Therefore, all of our actions are controlled by forces outside ourselves, or by random chance.<ref name=\"Kaney\">Kane, R. ''The Oxford Handbook to Free Will''.

[[Newcomb's paradox]] and other philosophical problems pose questions about free will and predictable outcomes of choices.\n\n====The physical mind====\n{{See also|Neuroscience of free will}}\n\n[[Compatibilist]] models of free will often consider deterministic relationships as discoverable in the physical world (including the brain).

Although compatibilism is generally aligned to (or is at least compatible with) physicalism, some compatibilist models describe the natural occurrences of deterministic deliberation in the brain in terms of the first person perspective of the conscious agent performing the deliberation.<ref name=Baumeister2 /> Such an approach has been considered a form of identity dualism. A description of \"how conscious experience might affect brains\" has been provided in which \"the experience of conscious free will is the first-person perspective of the neural correlates of choosing.\"<ref name=Baumeister2 />\n\nRecently{{when|date=August 2018}} [[Claudio Costa (philosopher)|Claudio Costa]] developed a neocompatibilist theory based on the causal theory of action that is complementary to classical compatibilism. According to him, physical, psychological and rational restrictions can interfere at different levels of the causal chain that would naturally lead to action. Correspondingly, there can be physical restrictions to the body, psychological restrictions to the decision, and rational restrictions to the formation of reasons (desires plus beliefs) that should lead to what we would call a reasonable action. The last two are usually called \"restrictions of free will\". The restriction at the level of reasons is particularly important since it can be motivated by external reasons that are insufficiently conscious to the agent. One example was the collective suicide led by [[Jim Jones]]. The suicidal agents were not conscious that their free will have been manipulated by external, even if ungrounded, reasons.<ref>Claudio Costa [http://www.example''Lines of Thought: Rethinking Philosophical Assumptions''] CSP, 2014, Ch. 7</ref>\n\n===Other views===\nSome philosophers' views are difficult to categorize as either compatibilist or incompatibilist, hard determinist or libertarian. For example, [[Ted Honderich]] holds the view that \"determinism is true, compatibilism and incompatibilism are both false\" and the real problem lies elsewhere. Honderich maintains that determinism is true because quantum phenomena are not events or things that can be located in space and time, but are [[Abstract object|abstract]] entities. Further, even if they were micro-level events, they do not seem to have any relevance to how the world is at the macroscopic level. He maintains that incompatibilism is false because, even if indeterminism is true, incompatibilists have not provided, and cannot provide, an adequate account of origination. He rejects compatibilism because it, like incompatibilism, assumes a single, fundamental notion of freedom. There are really two notions of freedom: voluntary action and origination. Both notions are required to explain freedom of will and responsibility. Both determinism and indeterminism are threats to such freedom. To abandon these notions of freedom would be to abandon moral responsibility. On the one side, we have our intuitions; on the other, the scientific facts. The \"new\" problem is how to resolve this conflict.<ref>Honderich, T.

He suggested that it might be accounted for by \"a false sensation or seeming experience\" (a ''velleity''), which is associated with many of our actions when we perform them. On reflection, we realize that they were necessary and determined all along.<ref>Hume, D. (1765). ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Indianapolis: Hacket Publishing Co.

But ''a posteriori'', through experience, he finds to his astonishment that he is not free, but subjected to necessity, that in spite of all his resolutions and reflections he does not change his conduct, and that from the beginning of his life to the end of it, he must carry out the very character which he himself condemns...<ref>Schopenhauer, Arthur, ''The Wisdom of Life'', p. 147</ref></blockquote>\nIn his essay ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Schopenhauer stated, \"You can do what you will, but in any given moment of your life you can ''will'' only one definite thing and absolutely nothing other than that one thing.\"<ref>[[Schopenhauer]], Arthur, ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Oxford: Basil Blackwell {{ISBN|0-631-14552-4}}</ref> According to Schopenhauer, [[phenomena]] do not have free will. However, [[Will (philosophy)|will]] [urging, craving, striving, wanting, and desiring] as [[Noumena|noumenon]] is free.\n\n====Free will as \"moral imagination\"====\n[[Rudolf Steiner]], who collaborated in a complete edition of Arthur Schopenhauer's work,<ref>{{cite web|title=Arthur Schopenhauers s\u00e4mtliche Werke in zw\u00f6lf B\u00e4nden.

Steiner (1861\u20131925) initially divides this into the two aspects of freedom: ''freedom of thought'' and ''freedom of action''. The controllable and uncontrollable aspects of decision making thereby are made logically separable, as pointed out in the introduction. This separation of ''will'' from ''action'' has a very long history, going back at least as far as [[Stoicism]] and the teachings of [[Chrysippus]] (279\u2013206 BCE), who separated external ''antecedent'' causes from the internal disposition receiving this cause.<ref name=Chrysippus>{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9lRD6feR3hEC&pg=PA529 |page=529 |chapter=Chapter VI: The Chyrsippean notion of fate: soft determinism |author=Keimpe Algra |isbn=978-0-521-25028-3 |year=1999}}</ref>\n\nSteiner then argues that inner freedom is achieved when we integrate our sensory impressions, which reflect the outer appearance of the world, with our thoughts, which lend coherence to these impressions and thereby disclose to us an understandable world. Acknowledging the many influences on our choices, he nevertheless points out that they do not preclude freedom unless we fail to recognise them. Steiner argues that outer freedom is attained by permeating our deeds with ''moral imagination.\u201d \u201cMoral\u201d in this case refers to action that is willed, while \u201cimagination\u201d refers to the mental capacity to envision conditions that do not already hold. Both of these functions are necessarily conditions for freedom. Steiner aims to show that these two aspects of inner and outer freedom are integral to one another, and that true freedom is only achieved when they are united.<ref>Steiner, R. (1964).

While he believed in free will on \"ethical grounds\", he did not believe that there was evidence for it on scientific grounds, nor did his own introspections support it.<ref>See Bricklin, Jonathan, \"A Variety of Religious Experience: William James and the Non-Reality of Free Will\", in Libet (1999), ''The Volitional Brain: Toward a Neuroscience of Free Will'' (Thorverton UK: Imprint Academic).</ref> Ultimately he believed that the problem of free will was a metaphysical issue and, therefore, could not be settled by science. Moreover, he did not accept incompatibilism as formulated below; he did not believe that the indeterminism of human actions was a prerequisite of moral responsibility. In his work ''[[Pragmatism]]'', he wrote that \"instinct and utility between them can safely be trusted to carry on the social business of punishment and praise\" regardless of metaphysical theories.<ref name=\"JW\">James, W. (1907) ''Pragmatism'' (1979 edition). Cambridge, MA: [[Harvard University Press]]</ref> He did believe that indeterminism is important as a \"doctrine of relief\"&nbsp;\u2013 it allows for the view that, although the world may be in many respects a bad place, it may, through individuals' actions, become a better one. Determinism, he argued, undermines [[meliorism]]&nbsp;\u2013 the idea that progress is a real concept leading to improvement in the world.<ref name=\"JW\"/>\n\n====Free will and views of causality====\n{{See also|Principle of sufficient reason}}\n\nIn 1739, [[David Hume]] in his ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' approached free will via the notion of causality. It was his position that causality was a mental construct used to explain the repeated association of events, and that one must examine more closely the relation between things ''regularly succeeding'' one another (descriptions of regularity in nature) and things that ''result'' in other things (things that cause or necessitate other things).<ref name=Kane>\n{{cite book |title=The significance of free will |author=Robert Kane |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dBlXH3FtwJIC&pg=PA226 |page= 226 |chapter=Notes to pages 74\u201381, note 22 |isbn=978-0-19-512656-3 |year=1998 |edition=Paperback}}\n</ref> According to Hume, 'causation' is on weak grounds: \"Once we realise that 'A must bring about B' is tantamount merely to 'Due to their constant conjunction, we are psychologically certain that B will follow A,' then we are left with a very weak notion of necessity.\"<ref name=Lorkowski>{{cite web |author=CM Lorkowski |date=November 7, 2010 |title=David Hume: Causation |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hume-cau/ |encyclopedia=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref>\n\nThis empiricist view was often denied by trying to prove the so-called [[apriority]] of causal law (i.e. that it precedes all experience and is rooted in the construction of the perceivable world):\n* [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s proof in ''Critique of Pure Reason'' (which referenced time and time ordering of causes and effects)<ref>Kant argued that, in order that human life is not just a \"dream\" (a random or projected by subjects juxtaposition of moments), the temporality of event A as before or after B must submit to a rule. An established order then implies the existence of some necessary conditions and causes, that is: sufficient bases (a so-called sufficient reason is the coincidence of all the necessary conditions). Without established causality, both [[Transcendental apperception|in subject]] and in the external world, the passing of time would be impossible, because it is essentially directional.

All changes take place according to the law of the connection of Cause and Effect.|online text of his proof]]</ref>\n* [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s proof from ''The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason'' (which referenced the so-called intellectuality of representations, that is, in other words, objects and [[qualia]] perceived with senses)<ref>Schopenhauer, who by the way continued and simplified Kant's system, argued (among others basing on optical illusions and the \"initial processing\") that it is the intellect or even the brain what generates the image of the world out of something else, by ''concluding from effects, e.g. optical, about appropriate causes'', e.g. concrete physical objects. Intellect in his works is strictly connected with recognizing causes and effects and associating them, it is somewhat close to the contemporary view of [[cerebral cortex]] and formation of associations.

But it does not of necessity belong to liberty that what is free should be the first cause of itself, as neither for one thing to be cause of another need it be the first cause. God, therefore, is the first cause, Who moves causes both natural and voluntary. And just as by moving natural causes He does not prevent their acts being natural, so by moving voluntary causes He does not deprive their actions of being voluntary: but rather is He the cause of this very thing in them; for He operates in each thing according to its own nature.\"<ref>Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa Theologiae'', Q83 A1.</ref><ref>Further discussion of this compatibilistic theory can be found in Thomas' ''Summa contra gentiles'', Book III about Providence, c. 88\u201391 (260\u2013267), where it is postulated that everything has its cause and it is again and again in detail referred also to all individual choices of man etc., even refuting opposite views.

In order to avoid, at least in concept, the absolution of man of any guilt he then notes the contingency of all that takes place, i.e. lack of ''direct'' necessity from God strictly with regard to a concrete (\"contingent\") act. A typical choice was not separately ordained to be so-and-so by God; St. Thomas says the choice is not necessary, but in fact that apparently means it was ''contingent'' with regard to God and the law of nature (as a specific case that could have not existed in other circumstances), and ''necessary'' with regard to its direct previous cause in will and intellect. (The contingency, or fortuity, is even intuitive under modern [[chaos theory]], where one can try to show that more and more developed products appearing in the evolution of a universe or, simpler, an automaton are [[chaos theory|chaotic]] with regard to its principles.)</ref>\n\n====Free will as a pseudo-problem====\nHistorically, most of the philosophical effort invested in resolving the dilemma has taken the form of close examination of definitions and ambiguities in the concepts designated by \"free\", \"freedom\", \"will\", \"choice\" and so forth.

The notion of compatibilist free will has been attributed to both [[Aristotle]] (fourth century BCE) and [[Epictetus]] (1st century CE); \"it was the fact that nothing hindered us from doing or choosing something that made us have control over them\".<ref name=bobzien1998determinism>{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| last = Bobzien| first = Susanne| title = Determinism and freedom in Stoic philosophy| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 1998| url = https://books.google.com/?id=7kmTeOjHIqkC&pg=PR12|quote=\"...Aristotle and Epictetus: In the latter authors it was the fact that nothing hindered us from doing or choosing something that made us have control over them.

It has traditionally meant (until the Enlightenment proposed its own meanings) lack of necessity in human will,<ref>A. Schopenhauer, ''On the Freedom of the Will'', c. 1, \"What is freedom?\"</ref> so that \"the will is free\" meant \"the will does not have to be such as it is\". This requirement was universally embraced by both incompatibilists and compatibilists.<ref>Hence the notion of contingency appeared as the very opposition of necessity, so that wherever a thing is considered dependent or relies upon another thing, it is contingent and thus not necessary.</ref>\n\n==Scientific approaches==\nScience has contributed to the free will problem in at least three ways. First, physics has addressed the question of whether nature is deterministic, which is viewed as crucial by incompatibilists (compatibilists, however, view it as irrelevant). Second, although free will can be defined in various ways, all of them involve aspects of the way people make decisions and initiate actions, which have been studied extensively by neuroscientists. Some of the experimental observations are widely viewed as implying that free will does not exist or is an illusion (but many philosophers see this as a misunderstanding). Third, psychologists have studied the beliefs that the majority of ordinary people hold about free will and its role in assigning moral responsibility.\n\n===Quantum physics===\nEarly scientific thought often portrayed the universe as deterministic&nbsp;\u2013 for example in the thought of [[Democritus]] or the [[C\u0101rv\u0101ka]]ns&nbsp;\u2013 and some thinkers claimed that the simple process of gathering sufficient [[physical information|information]] would allow them to predict future events with perfect accuracy. Modern science, on the other hand, is a mixture of deterministic and [[stochastic]] theories.<ref>Boniolo, G. and Vidali, P. (1999) ''Filosofia della Scienza'', Milan: Mondadori. {{ISBN|88-424-9359-7}}</ref> [[Quantum mechanics]] predicts events only in terms of probabilities, casting doubt on whether the universe is deterministic at all, although evolution of the universal state vector is completely deterministic. Current physical theories cannot resolve the question of whether determinism is true of the world, being very far from a potential [[Theory of Everything]], and open to many different [[Interpretation of quantum mechanics|interpretations]].<ref name=\"stanfordcausaldeterminism\">{{cite encyclopedia |first=Carl |last=Hoefer |title=Causal Determinism |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=2008 |accessdate=2008-11-01 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Is the Universe Deterministic? |first=Vlatko |last=Vedral |volume=192 |issue=2578 |date=2006-11-18 |journal=New Scientist |pages=52\u201355 |quote=Physics is simply unable to resolve the question of free will, although, if anything, it probably leans towards determinism.|doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(06)61122-6 }}</ref>\n\nAssuming that an indeterministic interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct, one may still object that such indeterminism is for all practical purposes confined to microscopic phenomena.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/dfwVariousHonderichKanebook.htm |author=Honderich, E.|title= Determinism as True, Compatibilism and Incompatibilism as Both False, and the Real Problem |publisher=Ucl.ac.uk |accessdate=2010-11-21}}</ref> This is not always the case: many macroscopic phenomena are based on quantum effects. For instance, some [[hardware random number generator]]s work by amplifying quantum effects into practically usable signals. A more significant question is whether the indeterminism of quantum mechanics allows for the traditional idea of free will (based on a perception of free will). If a person's action is, however, only a result of complete quantum randomness, mental processes as experienced have no influence on the probabilistic outcomes (such as volition).<ref name=\"RKane1\"/> According to many interpretations, non-determinism enables free will to exist,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/quantum-physics-free-will/ | title=The Quantum Physics of Free Will}}</ref> while others assert the opposite (because the action was not controllable by the physical being who claims to possess the free will).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/features/2000/lujan1.html |title=Infidels. \"Metaphysical Freedom\" |publisher=Infidels.org |accessdate=2010-11-21}}</ref>\n\n===Genetics===\nLike physicists, [[biology|biologists]] have frequently addressed questions related to free will.

A seminal experiment in this field was conducted by [[Benjamin Libet]] in the 1980s, in which he asked each subject to choose a random moment to flick their wrist while he measured the associated activity in their brain; in particular, the build-up of electrical signal called the [[readiness potential]] (after German [[Bereitschaftspotential]], which was discovered by [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] & [[L\u00fcder Deecke|Deecke]] in 1965.<ref>[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] & [[L\u00fcder Deecke|Deecke]], 1965.

Although it was well known that the readiness potential reliably preceded the physical action, Libet asked whether it could be recorded before the conscious intention to move. To determine when subjects felt the intention to move, he asked them to watch the second hand of a clock. After making a movement, the volunteer reported the time on the clock when they first felt the conscious intention to move; this became known as Libet's W time.<ref name=\"LGW\" />\n\nLibet found that the ''unconscious'' brain activity of the readiness potential leading up to subjects' movements began approximately half a second before the subject was aware of a conscious intention to move.<ref name=\"LGW\"/><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X00044903 | last1 = Libet | first1 = B. | year = 1985 | title = Unconscious cerebral initiative and the role of conscious will in voluntary action | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/91ac5be13863401a85d8165b1ca273fa82dfddde| journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 529\u201366 }}</ref>\n\nThese studies of the timing between actions and the conscious decision bear upon the role of the brain in understanding free will. A subject's declaration of intention to move a finger appears ''after'' the brain has begun to implement the action, suggesting to some that unconsciously the brain has made the decision ''before'' the conscious mental act to do so. Some believe the implication is that free will was not involved in the decision and is an illusion. The first of these experiments reported the brain registered activity related to the move about 0.2 s before movement onset.<ref name=Libet>\n{{cite journal|title=Time of conscious intention to act in relation to onset of cerebral activity (readiness-potential) |author=Benjamin Libet |display-authors=etal |journal=Brain |year=1983 |volume=106 |pages=623\u201342 |url=http://trans-techresearch.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Brain-1983-LIBET.pdf |doi=10.1093/brain/106.3.623 |pmid=6640273 |issue=3 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526054605/http://trans-techresearch.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Brain-1983-LIBET.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-26 |df= }}</ref> However, these authors also found that awareness of action was ''anticipatory'' to activity in the muscle underlying the movement; the entire process resulting in action involves more steps than just the ''onset'' of brain activity.

In ''[[Freedom Evolves]]'', [[Daniel Dennett]] argues that a no-free-will conclusion is based on dubious assumptions about the location of consciousness, as well as questioning the accuracy and interpretation of Libet's results. Kornhuber and Deecke underlined that absence of conscious will during the early Bereitschaftspotential (termed BP1) is not a proof of the non-existence of free will, as also unconscious agendas may be free and non-deterministic. According to their suggestion, man has relative freedom, i.e. freedom in degrees, that can be increased or decreased through deliberate choices that involve both conscious and unconscious (panencephalic) processes.<ref>[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] & [[L\u00fcder Deecke|Deecke]], 2012.

Neuroscientific studies are valuable tools in developing models of how humans experience free will.\n\nFor example, people with [[Tourette syndrome]] and related [[tic disorder]]s make involuntary movements and utterances (called [[tic]]s) despite the fact that they would prefer not to do so when it is socially inappropriate. Tics are described as semi-voluntary or ''unvoluntary'',<ref name=TSADef>Tourette Syndrome Association.

The affected limb effectively demonstrates 'a will of its own.' The [[sense of agency]] does not emerge in conjunction with the overt appearance of the purposeful act even though the sense of ownership in relationship to the body part is maintained. This phenomenon corresponds with an impairment in the premotor mechanism manifested temporally by the appearance of the readiness potential recordable on the scalp several hundred milliseconds before the overt appearance of a spontaneous willed movement. Using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] with specialized multivariate analyses to study the temporal dimension in the activation of the cortical network associated with voluntary movement in human subjects, an anterior-to-posterior sequential activation process beginning in the supplementary motor area on the medial surface of the frontal lobe and progressing to the primary motor cortex and then to parietal cortex has been observed.<ref name=Kayser>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/hbm.20771 | last1 = Kayser | first1 = A.S. | last2 = Sun | first2 = F.T. | last3 = D'Esposito | first3 = M. | year = 2009 | title = A comparison of Granger causality and coherency in fMRI-based analysis of the motor system | url = | journal = Human Brain Mapping | volume = 30 | issue = 11| pages = 3475\u201394 | pmid = 19387980 | pmc = 2767459 }}</ref> The sense of agency thus appears to normally emerge in conjunction with this orderly sequential network activation incorporating premotor association cortices together with primary motor cortex.

In his book, ''The Illusion of Conscious Will,''<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://zodml.org/sites/default/files/%5bDaniel_M._Wegner%5d_The_Illusion_of_Conscious_Will.pdf|title=The Illusion of Conscious Will|last=Wegener|first=Daniel Merton|publisher=MIT Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-262-23222-7|location=|pages=}}</ref> Wegner summarizes what he believes is [[empirical evidence]] supporting the view that human perception of conscious control is an illusion. Wegner summarizes some empirical evidence that may suggest that the perception of conscious control is open to modification (or even manipulation). Wegner observes that one event is inferred to have caused a second event when two requirements are met:\n# The first event immediately precedes the second event, and\n# The first event is consistent with having caused the second event.\nFor example, if a person hears an explosion and sees a tree fall down that person is likely to infer that the explosion caused the tree to fall over. However, if the explosion occurs after the tree falls down (that is, the first requirement is not met), or rather than an explosion, the person hears the ring of a telephone (that is, the second requirement is not met), then that person is not likely to infer that either noise caused the tree to fall down.\n\nWegner has applied this principle to the inferences people make about their own conscious will. People typically experience a thought that is consistent with a behavior, and then they observe themselves performing this behavior.

The theory implies that people will more readily attribute free will to themselves rather than others. This prediction has been confirmed by three of Pronin and Kugler's experiments. When college students were asked about personal decisions in their own and their roommate's lives, they regarded their own choices as less predictable. Staff at a restaurant described their co-workers' lives as more determined (having fewer future possibilities) than their own lives. When weighing up the influence of different factors on behavior, students gave desires and intentions the strongest weight for their own behavior, but rated personality traits as most predictive of other people.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pronin|first=Emily|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, Vol. 41|editor=Mark P.

It preaches a middle doctrine, named ''[[pratitya-samutpada]]'' in [[Sanskrit]], often translated as \"inter-dependent arising\". This theory is also called \"Conditioned Genesis\" or \"[[Dependent Origination]]\". It teaches that every volition is a conditioned action as a result of ignorance. In part, it states that free will is inherently conditioned and not \"free\" to begin with. It is also part of the theory of [[karma in Buddhism]]. The concept of karma in Buddhism is different from the notion of karma in Hinduism. In Buddhism, the idea of karma is much less deterministic. The Buddhist notion of karma is primarily focused on the cause and effect of moral actions in this life, while in Hinduism the concept of karma is more often connected with determining one's [[destiny]] in future lives.\n\nIn Buddhism it is taught that the idea of absolute freedom of choice (that is that any human being could be completely free to make any choice) is unwise, because it denies the reality of one's physical needs and circumstances. Equally incorrect is the idea that humans have no choice in life or that their lives are pre-determined. To deny freedom would be to deny the efforts of Buddhists to make moral progress (through our capacity to freely choose compassionate action). ''Pubbekatahetuvada'', the belief that all happiness and suffering arise from previous actions, is considered a wrong view according to Buddhist doctrines. Because Buddhists also reject [[agency (philosophy)|agenthood]], the traditional compatibilist strategies are closed to them as well. Instead, the Buddhist philosophical strategy is to examine the metaphysics of causality. Ancient India had many heated arguments about the nature of causality with [[Jain]]s, [[Nyaya|Nyayists]], [[Samkhya|Samkhyists]], [[C\u0101rv\u0101ka]]ns, and Buddhists all taking slightly different lines. In many ways, the Buddhist position is closer to a theory of \"conditionality\" than a theory of \"causality\", especially as it is expounded by [[Nagarjuna]] in the ''[[M\u016blamadhyamakak\u0101rik\u0101]]''.<ref name=\"Gier\"/>\n\n==In theology==\n{{Main|Free will in theology}}\n\n=== Christianity ===\n[[File:Antonio Rodr\u00edguez - Saint Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|Augustine's view of free will and predestination would go on to have a profound impact on Christian theology]]\n\nThe notions of free will and predestination are heavily debated among Christians. Free will in the Christian sense is the ability to choose between good or evil. Among Catholics, there are those holding to [[Thomism]], adopted from what [[Thomas Aquinas]] put forth in the ''[[Summa Theologica]].'' There are also some holding to [[Molinism]] which was put forth by Jesuit priest [[Luis de Molina]]. Among Protestants there is [[Arminianism]], held primarily by [[Methodist]] and some [[Baptist]], and formulated by Dutch theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]]; and there is also [[Calvinism]] held by most in the [[Reformed]] tradition which was formulated by the French Reformed theologian, [[John Calvin]]. John Calvin was heavily influenced by [[Augustine of Hippo]] views on predestination put forth in his work ''On the Predestination of the Saints.'' [[Martin Luther]] seems to hold views on predestination similar to Calvinism in his ''[[On the Bondage of the Will]],'' thus rejecting free will. In condemnation of Calvin and Luther views, the Council of Trent declared that \"the free will of man, moved and excited by God, can by its consent co-operate with God, Who excites and invites its action; and that it can thereby dispose and prepare itself to obtain the grace of justification. The will can resist grace if it chooses. It is not like a lifeless thing, which remains purely passive. Weakened and diminished by Adam's fall, free will is yet not destroyed in the race (Sess. VI, cap. i and v).\"\n\n[[Paul the Apostle]] discusses Predestination in some of his Epistles.\n\n\"''For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the first-born among many brethren; and whom He predestined, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.''\u201d \u2014[[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 8:29\u201330\n\n\u201c''He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will.''\u201d \u2014[[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 1:5\n\nThe exact meaning of these verses has been debated by Christian theologians throughout history.\n\n=== Judaism ===\n[[File:Flickr - USCapitol - Maimonides (1135-1204).jpg|thumb|right|[[Bas relief]] of Maimonides in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].]]\n[[Maimonides]] reasoned that human beings have free will (at least in the context of choosing to do good or evil).  Without free will, the demands of [[Nevi'im#Latter Prophets|the prophets]] would have been meaningless, there would be no need for the [[Torah]], and justice could not be administered.  In Maimonides's view, human free will is granted by God as part of the universe's design.<ref>Rambam Teshuvah 5:4</ref>\n\n=== Islam ===\n\nIn [[Islam]] the theological issue is not usually how to reconcile free will with God's foreknowledge, but with God's ''jabr'', or divine commanding power. [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari|al-Ash'ari]] developed an \"acquisition\" or \"dual-agency\" form of compatibilism, in which human free will and divine ''jabr'' were both asserted, and which became a cornerstone of the dominant [[Ash'ari]] position.<ref>[[William Montgomery Watt|Watt, Montgomery]].

It is also connected with the concepts of [[Advice (opinion)|advice]], [[persuasion]], [[deliberation]], and [[Prohibitionism|prohibition]]. Traditionally, only actions that are freely [[Will (philosophy)|willed]] are seen as deserving credit or blame. There are numerous different concerns about threats to the possibility of free will, varying by how exactly it is conceived, which is a matter of some debate.\n\nSome conceive free will to be the capacity to make choices in which the outcome has not been determined by past events. [[Determinism]] suggests that only one course of events is possible, which is inconsistent with the existence of free will thus conceived.<ref name=\"Baumeister, R.F 2014. pp. 1-52\">Baumeister, R.F. and Monroe, A.E., 2014.

Incompatibilism also encompasses [[hard incompatibilism]], which holds not only determinism but also its negation to be incompatible with free will and thus free will to be impossible whatever the case may be regarding determinism.\n\nIn contrast, [[compatibilism|compatibilists]] hold that free will ''is'' compatible with determinism. Some compatibilists even hold that determinism is ''necessary'' for free will, arguing that choice involves preference for one course of action over another, requiring a sense of ''how'' choices will turn out.<ref name=Carnap>An argument by [[Rudolph Carnap]] described by: {{cite book |title= Research In Psychology: Methods and Design |author= C.

In contrast, \"[[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|metaphysical libertarians]]\", such as [[Thomas Reid]], [[Peter van Inwagen]], and [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]], are those incompatibilists who accept free will and deny determinism, holding the view that some form of indeterminism is true.<ref name=\"Wagen\">van Invagen, P. (1983) ''An Essay on Free Will''. Oxford: [[Clarendon Press]]. {{ISBN|0-19-824924-1}}</ref> Another view is that of hard incompatibilists, which state that free will is incompatible with both [[determinism]] and [[indeterminism]].<ref name=\"Derk1\">{{cite book |author=Pereboom, D. |year=2003 |title=Living without Free Will |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9sKZ1rAO2BwC&printsec=frontcover |isbn=978-0-521-79198-4}}</ref>\n\nTraditional arguments for incompatibilism are based on an \"[[intuition pump]]\": if a person is like other mechanical things that are determined in their behavior such as a wind-up toy, a billiard ball, a puppet, or a robot, then people must not have free will.<ref name=\"Wagen\"/><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Fischer | first1 = J.M. | year = 1983 | title = Incompatibilism | url = | journal = Philosophical Studies | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 121\u201337 | doi = 10.1007/BF01112527 }}</ref> This argument has been rejected by compatibilists such as Daniel Dennett on the grounds that, even if humans have something in common with these things, it remains possible and plausible that we are different from such objects in important ways.<ref name=\"DD1\"/>\n\nAnother argument for incompatibilism is that of the \"causal chain\". Incompatibilism is key to the idealist theory of free will. Most incompatibilists reject the idea that freedom of action consists simply in \"voluntary\" behavior. They insist, rather, that free will means that man must be the \"ultimate\" or \"originating\" cause of his actions. He must be ''[[causa sui]]'', in the traditional phrase. Being responsible for one's choices is the first cause of those choices, where first cause means that there is no antecedent cause of that cause. The argument, then, is that if man has free will, then man is the ultimate cause of his actions. If determinism is true, then all of man's choices are caused by events and facts outside his control. So, if everything man does is caused by events and facts outside his control, then he cannot be the ultimate cause of his actions. Therefore, he cannot have free will.<ref>Kane, R.

The simplified argument runs along these lines: if determinism is true, then we have no control over the events of the past that determined our present state and no control over the laws of nature. Since we can have no control over these matters, we also can have no control over the ''consequences'' of them. Since our present choices and acts, under determinism, are the necessary consequences of the past and the laws of nature, then we have no control over them and, hence, no free will. This is called the ''consequence argument''.<ref>Ginet, C. (1966) \"Might We Have No Choice?\" In Lehrer, 1966: 87\u2013104.</ref><ref name=\"Ving\">Van Inwagen, P. and Zimmerman, D. (1998) ''Metaphysics: The Big Questions''. Oxford: Blackwell</ref> Peter van Inwagen remarks that C.D. Broad had a version of the consequence argument as early as the 1930s.<ref>Inwagen, P. (n.d.) [http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/HowThinkFW.doc \"How to think about free will\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911064556/http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/HowThinkFW.doc |date=2008-09-11 }}, p. 15.</ref>\n\nThe difficulty of this argument for some compatibilists lies in the fact that it entails the impossibility that one could have chosen other than one has. For example, if Jane is a compatibilist and she has just sat down on the sofa, then she is committed to the claim that she could have remained standing, if she had so desired. But it [[Logical consequence|follows from]] the consequence argument that, if Jane had remained standing, she would have either generated a contradiction, violated the laws of nature or changed the past. Hence, compatibilists are committed to the existence of \"incredible abilities\", according to Ginet and van Inwagen. One response to this argument is that it equivocates on the notions of abilities and necessities, or that the free will evoked to make any given choice is really an illusion and the choice had been made all along, oblivious to its \"decider\".<ref name=\"Ving\"/> [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] suggests that compatibilists are only committed to the ability to do something otherwise if ''different circumstances'' had actually obtained in the past.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1755-2567.1981.tb00473.x | last1 = Lewis | first1 = D. | year = 2008| title = Are We Free to Break the Laws? | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1c8564b3a6ed399580cca8ffc2ae8ab6dd27d464| journal = Theoria | volume = 47 | issue = 3| pages = 113\u201321 }}</ref>\n\nUsing ''T'', ''F'' for \"true\" and \"false\" and ''?'' for undecided, there are exactly nine positions regarding determinism/free will that consist of any two of these three possibilities:<ref name=Strawson>\n{{cite book |title=Freedom and belief |author= Strawson, Galen|page=6 |isbn=978-0-19-924750-9 |edition=Revised |year=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}\n</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:50%;\"\n|+Galen Strawson's table<ref name=Strawson/>\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"col\" | 1\n! scope=\"col\" | 2\n! scope=\"col\" | 3\n! scope=\"col\" | 4\n! scope=\"col\" | 5\n! scope=\"col\" | 6\n! scope=\"col\" | 7\n! scope=\"col\" | 8\n! scope=\"col\" | 9\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Determinism ''D''\n|T\n|F\n|T\n|F\n|T\n|F\n|?\n|?\n|?\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Free will ''FW''\n|F\n|T\n|T\n|F\n|?\n|?\n|F\n|T\n|?\n|-\n|}\n''Incompatibilism'' may occupy any of the nine positions except (5), (8) or (3), which last corresponds to ''soft determinism''. Position (1) is ''hard determinism'', and position (2) is ''libertarianism''. The position (1) of hard determinism adds to the table the contention that ''D'' implies ''FW'' is untrue, and the position (2) of libertarianism adds the contention that ''FW'' implies ''D'' is untrue. Position (9) may be called ''hard incompatibilism'' if one interprets ''?'' as meaning both concepts are of dubious value. ''Compatibilism'' itself may occupy any of the nine positions, that is, there is no logical contradiction between determinism and free will, and either or both may be true or false in principle. However, the most common meaning attached to ''compatibilism'' is that some form of determinism is true and yet we have some form of free will, position (3).<ref name=FischerFour2009>{{cite book |pages=44 ''ff'' |author= Fischer, John Martin |title=Four Views on Free Will (Great Debates in Philosophy) |isbn=978-1-4051-3486-6 |year=2009 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |chapter=Chapter 2: Compatibilism}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Toppledominos.jpg|thumb|A [[domino effect|domino's movement]] is [[Determinism|determined]] completely by laws of physics.]]\n[[Alexander Rosenberg|Alex Rosenberg]] makes an extrapolation of physical determinism as inferred on the macroscopic scale by the behaviour of a set of dominoes to neural activity in the brain where; \"If the brain is nothing but a complex physical object whose states are as much governed by physical laws as any other physical object, then what goes on in our heads is as fixed and determined by prior events as what goes on when one domino topples another in a long row of them.\"<ref name=Rosenberg>\n{{cite book |title=Philosophy Of Science: A Contemporary Introduction |author=Alex Rosenberg |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OenUbcvgoi4C&pg=PA8 |page=8 |isbn=978-0-415-34317-6 |year=2005 |edition=2nd |publisher=Psychology Press}}\n</ref> [[Determinism#Quantum mechanics and classical physics|Physical determinism]] is currently disputed by prominent [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretations]] of [[quantum mechanics]], and while not necessarily representative of intrinsic [[indeterminism]] in nature, fundamental limits of precision in measurement are inherent in the [[uncertainty principle]].<ref name=\"Bohr1\"/> The relevance of such prospective indeterminate activity to free will is, however, contested,<ref name=\"Bohr\"/> even when chaos theory is introduced to magnify the effects of such microscopic events.<ref name=\"RKane1\"/><ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1142/S0219635206001112 | pmid=16783870 | last=Lewis | first=E.R. |author2=MacGregor, R.J. | year=2006 | title=On Indeterminism, Chaos, and Small Number Particle Systems in the Brain | journal=[[Journal of Integrative Neuroscience]] | volume=5 | issue=2 | pages=223\u201347 |url=http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~lewis/LewisMacGregor.pdf | citeseerx=10.1.1.361.7065 }}</ref>\n\nBelow these positions are examined in more detail.<ref name=Strawson/>\n\n====Hard determinism====\n{{main|Hard determinism}}\n[[File:FreeWillTaxonomy4.svg|thumb|A simplified [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of philosophical positions regarding free will and determinism.]]\n\nDeterminism can be divided into causal, logical and theological determinism.<ref name=\"Parkinson2012\">{{cite encyclopaedia|author=G.H.R.

Libertarianism holds onto a concept of free will that requires that the [[agency (philosophy)|agent]] be able to take more than one possible course of action under a given set of circumstances.\n\nAccounts of libertarianism subdivide into non-physical theories and physical or naturalistic theories. Non-physical theories hold that the events in the brain that lead to the performance of actions do not have an entirely physical explanation, which requires that the world is not closed under physics. This includes [[interactionist dualism]], which claims that some non-physical [[mind]], will, or [[soul]] overrides physical [[causality]]. Physical determinism implies there is only one possible future and is therefore not compatible with libertarian free will. As consequent of incompatibilism, metaphysical libertarian explanations that do not involve dispensing with [[physicalism]] require physical indeterminism, such as probabilistic subatomic particle behavior&nbsp;\u2013 theory unknown to many of the early writers on free will. Incompatibilist theories can be categorised based on the type of indeterminism they require; uncaused events, non-deterministically caused events, and agent/substance-caused events.<ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Randolph |first=Clarke |editor=Edward N.

They either rely upon a world that is not causally closed, or physical indeterminism. Non-causal accounts often claim that each intentional action requires a choice or volition&nbsp;\u2013 a willing, trying, or endeavoring on behalf of the agent (such as the cognitive component of lifting one's arm).<ref name=LumerNannini2007>{{cite book|author1=Christoph Lumer|author2=Sandro Nannini|title=Intentionality, Deliberation and Autonomy: The Action-Theoretic Basis of Practical Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4LzldxvSk4kC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-6058-3}}</ref><ref name=McCann1998>{{cite book|author=Hugh McCann|title=The Works of Agency: On Human Action, Will, and Freedom|url=https://archive.org/details/worksofagencyonh00mcca_0|url-access=registration|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1998|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8583-1}}</ref> Such intentional actions are interpreted as free actions. It has been suggested, however, that such acting cannot be said to exercise control over anything in particular. According to non-causal accounts, the causation by the agent cannot be analysed in terms of causation by mental states or events, including desire, belief, intention of something in particular, but rather is considered a matter of spontaneity and creativity. The exercise of intent in such intentional actions is not that which determines their freedom&nbsp;\u2013 intentional actions are rather self-generating. The \"actish feel\" of some intentional actions do not \"constitute that event's activeness, or the agent's exercise of active control\", rather they \"might be brought about by direct stimulation of someone's brain, in the absence of any relevant desire or intention on the part of that person\".<ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories /> Another question raised by such non-causal theory, is how an agent acts upon reason, if the said intentional actions are spontaneous.\n\nSome non-causal explanations involve invoking [[panpsychism]], the theory that a quality of [[mind]] is associated with all particles, and pervades the entire universe, in both animate and inanimate entities.\n\n====Event-causal theories====\nEvent-causal accounts of incompatibilist free will typically rely upon physicalist models of mind (like those of the compatibilist), yet they presuppose physical indeterminism, in which certain indeterministic events are said to be caused by the agent. A number of event-causal accounts of free will have been created, referenced here as ''deliberative indeterminism'', ''centred accounts'', and ''efforts of will theory''.<ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories /> The first two accounts do not require free will to be a fundamental constituent of the universe. Ordinary randomness is appealed to as supplying the \"elbow room\" that libertarians believe necessary. A first common objection to event-causal accounts is that the indeterminism could be destructive and could therefore diminish control by the agent rather than provide it (related to the problem of origination). A second common objection to these models is that it is questionable whether such indeterminism could add any value to deliberation over that which is already present in a deterministic world.\n\n''Deliberative indeterminism'' asserts that the indeterminism is confined to an earlier stage in the decision process.<ref name=Ekstrom2000>{{cite book|author=Laura Waddell Ekstrom|title=Free Will: A Philosophical Study|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oaOpa7qlz3kC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=2000|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-9093-2}}</ref><ref name=Mele2006>{{cite book|author=Alfred R.

Models of [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] have been constructed in which it is seen as a particular kind of complex, high-level process with an element of physical indeterminism.

It is also required that the agent's causing of that event is not causally determined by prior events. A number of problems have been identified with this view. Firstly, it is difficult to establish the reason for any given choice by the agent, which suggests they may be random or determined by ''luck'' (without an underlying basis for the free will decision). Secondly, it has been questioned whether physical events can be caused by an external substance or mind&nbsp;\u2013 a common problem associated with [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|interactionalist dualism]].\n\n====Hard incompatibilism====\nHard incompatibilism is the idea that free will cannot exist, whether the world is deterministic or not. [[Derk Pereboom (philosopher)|Derk Pereboom]] has defended hard incompatibilism, identifying a variety of positions where free will is irrelevant to indeterminism/determinism, among them the following:\n:#Determinism (D) is true, D does not imply we lack free will (F), but in fact we do lack F.\n:#D is true, D does not imply we lack F, but in fact we don't know if we have F.\n:#D is true, and we do have F.\n:#D is true, we have F, and F implies D.\n:#D is unproven, but we have F.\n:#D isn't true, we do have F, and would have F even if D were true.\n:#D isn't true, we don't have F, but F is compatible with D.\n::::::Derk Pereboom, ''Living without Free Will'',<ref name=\"Derk1\"/> p. xvi.\nPereboom calls positions 3 and 4 ''soft determinism'', position 1 a form of ''hard determinism'', position 6 a form of ''classical libertarianism'', and any position that includes having F as ''compatibilism''.\n\n[[John Locke]] denied that the phrase \"free will\" made any sense (compare with [[theological noncognitivism]], a similar stance on the [[existence of God]]). He also took the view that the truth of determinism was irrelevant. He believed that the defining feature of voluntary behavior was that individuals have the ability to ''postpone'' a decision long enough to reflect or deliberate upon the consequences of a choice: \"... the will in truth, signifies nothing but a power, or ability, to prefer or choose\".<ref>Locke, J. (1689). ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1998, ed). Book II, Chap. XXI, Sec. 17. Penguin Classics, Toronto.</ref>\n\nThe contemporary philosopher [[Galen Strawson]] agrees with Locke that the truth or falsity of determinism is irrelevant to the\nproblem.<ref name=\"GStraw\">Strawson, G. (1998, 2004). \"Free will\". In E. Craig (ed.), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. London: Routledge.

But it is impossible for one to be responsible for the way one is in any respect. This is because to be responsible in some situation ''S'', one must have been responsible for the way one was at ''S<sup>\u22121</sup>''. To be responsible for the way one was at ''S<sup>\u22121</sup>'', one must have been responsible for the way one was at ''S<sup>\u22122</sup>'', and so on. At some point in the chain, there must have been an act of origination of a new causal chain. But this is impossible. Man cannot create himself or his mental states ''[[ex nihilo]]''. This argument entails that free will itself is absurd, but not that it is incompatible with determinism. Strawson calls his own view \"pessimism\" but it can be classified as [[hard incompatibilism]].<ref name=\"GStraw\"/>\n\n===== Causal determinism =====\n{{Main|Determinism}}\n\nCausal determinism is the concept that [[Event (philosophy)|events]] within a given [[paradigm]] are bound by [[causality]] in such a way that any state (of an object or event) is completely determined by prior states. Causal determinism proposes that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe. Causal determinists believe that there is nothing uncaused or [[Causa sui|self-caused]]. The most common form of causal determinism is nomological determinism (or scientific determinism), the notion that the past and the present dictate the future entirely and necessarily by rigid natural laws, that every occurrence results inevitably from prior events. [[Quantum mechanics]] poses a serious challenge to this view.\n\nFundamental debate continues over whether the physical universe is likely to be [[causal determinism|deterministic]]. Although the scientific method cannot be used to rule out [[indeterminism]] with respect to violations of [[causal closure]], it can be used to identify indeterminism in natural law. [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics]] at present are both [[deterministic system|deterministic]] and [[indeterminism|indeterministic]], and are being constrained by ongoing experimentation.<ref name=GroblacherPaterek2007>{{cite journal|last1=Groblacher|first1=Simon|last2=Paterek|first2=Tomasz|last3=Kaltenbaek|first3=Rainer|last4=Brukner|first4=Caslav|last5=Zukowski|first5=Marek|last6=Aspelmeyer|first6=Markus|last7=Zeilinger|first7=Anton|title=An experimental test of non-local realism|journal=Nature|volume=446|issue=7138|year=2007|pages=871\u201375|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/nature05677|pmid=17443179|arxiv=0704.2529|bibcode=2007Natur.446..871G}}</ref>\n\n===== Destiny and fate =====\n{{Main|Destiny}}\n\nDestiny or fate is a predetermined course of events. It may be conceived as a predetermined future, whether in general or of an individual. It is a concept based on the belief that there is a fixed natural order to the cosmos.\n\nAlthough often used interchangeably, the words \"fate\" and \"destiny\" have distinct connotations.\n\n[[Fate]] generally implies there is a set course that cannot be deviated from, and over which one has no control. Fate is related to [[determinism]], but makes no specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be fated externally (see for instance [[theological determinism]]). Destiny likewise is related to determinism, but makes no specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be destined to occur.\n\n[[Destiny]] implies there is a set course that cannot be deviated from, but does not of itself make any claim with respect to the setting of that course (i.e., it does not necessarily conflict with [[incompatibilist]] free will). Free will if existent could be the mechanism by which that destined outcome is chosen (determined to represent destiny).<ref name=\"Blackwell2011\">{{cite book|author=Ben C.

Logical [[determinism]] or determinateness is the notion that all propositions, whether about the past, present, or future, are either true or false. This creates a unique problem for free will given that propositions about the future already have a truth value in the present (that is it is already determined as either true or false), and is referred to as the [[problem of future contingents]].\n\n===== Omniscience =====\n{{Main|Omniscience}}\n\n[[Omniscience]] is the capacity to know everything that there is to know (included in which are all future events), and is a property often attributed to a creator deity. Omniscience implies the existence of destiny. Some authors have claimed that free will cannot coexist with omniscience. One argument asserts that an omniscient creator not only implies destiny but a form of high level [[predeterminism]] such as hard [[theological determinism]] or [[predestination]]&nbsp;\u2013 that they have independently fixed all events and outcomes in the universe in advance. In such a case, even if an individual could have influence over their lower level physical system, their choices in regard to this cannot be their own, as is the case with libertarian free will. Omniscience features as an [[incompatible-properties argument]] for the existence of [[God]], known as the [[argument from free will]], and is closely related to other such arguments, for example the incompatibility of [[omnipotence]] with a good creator deity (i.e. if a deity knew what they were going to choose, then they are responsible for letting them choose it).\n\n=====Predeterminism=====\n{{Main|Predeterminism}}\n{{See also|Predestination}}\n\n[[Predeterminism]] is the idea that all events are determined in advance.<ref name=\"McKewan\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=McKewan |first=Jaclyn |editor=H.

The concept of predeterminism is often argued by invoking [[causal determinism]], implying that there is an unbroken [[chain of prior occurrences]] stretching back to the origin of the universe. In the case of predeterminism, this chain of events has been pre-established, and human actions cannot interfere with the outcomes of this pre-established chain. Predeterminism can be used to mean such pre-established causal determinism, in which case it is categorised as a specific type of [[determinism]].<ref name=\"McKewan\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/notes-determinism.html |title=Some Varieties of Free Will and Determinism |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=10 September 2009 <!-- date found by checking page's source code where format of date given as m.d.y -->|work=Philosophy 302: Ethics |publisher=philosophy.lander.edu |accessdate=19 December 2012| quote=Predeterminism: the philosophical and theological view that combines God with determinism.

It claims that free will does not exist, and ''God'' has absolute control over a person's actions. Hard theological determinism is similar in implication to [[hard determinism]], although it does not invalidate [[compatibilism|compatibilist]] free will.<ref name=stanfordforeknowledge /> Hard theological determinism is a form of theological incompatibilism (see figure, top left).\n* Weak theological determinism is either compatible or incompatible with metaphysical libertarian free will depending upon one's philosophical interpretation of [[omniscience]]&nbsp;\u2013 and as such is interpreted as either a form of hard theological determinism (known as [[theological fatalism]]), or as ''soft theological determinism'' (terminology used for clarity only). Soft theological determinism claims that humans have free will to choose their actions, holding that God, while [[omniscience|knowing their actions before they happen]], does not affect the outcome. God's providence is \"compatible\" with voluntary choice. Soft theological determinism is known as theological compatibilism (see figure, top right). A rejection of theological determinism (or [[omniscience|divine foreknowledge]]) is classified as theological incompatibilism also (see figure, bottom), and is relevant to a more general discussion of free will.<ref name=\"stanfordforeknowledge\"/>\n\nThe basic argument for theological fatalism in the case of weak theological determinism is as follows:\n# Assume divine foreknowledge or [[omniscience]]\n# [[infallibility|Infallible]] foreknowledge implies destiny (it is known for certain what one will do)\n# Destiny eliminates alternate possibility (one cannot do otherwise)\n# Assert incompatibility with metaphysical libertarian free will\n\nThis argument is very often accepted as a basis for theological incompatibilism: denying either libertarian free will or divine foreknowledge (omniscience) and therefore theological determinism. On the other hand, theological compatibilism must attempt to find problems with it. The formal version of the argument rests on a number of premises, many of which have received some degree of contention. Theological compatibilist responses have included:\n* Deny the truth value of [[Problem of future contingents|future contingents]], although this denies foreknowledge and therefore theological determinism.\n* Assert differences in non-temporal knowledge (space-time independence), an approach taken for example by [[Boethius]],<ref>{{cite book | author=Boethius | title=The Consolation of Philosophy | chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/theconsolationof14328gut | chapter=Book V, Prose vi}}</ref> [[Thomas Aquinas]],<ref>{{cite book | author=Aquinas, St. Thomas | title=Summa Theologica | chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.126741 | chapter=Ia, q. 14, art 13.}} See [[Summa Theologica]]</ref> and [[C.S.

By the same principle, metaphysical libertarianism (a form of incompatibilism with respect to physical determinism) might be classified as compatibilism with respect to theological determinism (if it was assumed such free will events were pre-ordained and therefore were destined to occur, but of which whose outcomes were not \"predestined\" or determined by God). If hard theological determinism is accepted (if it was assumed instead that such outcomes were predestined by God), then metaphysical libertarianism is not, however, possible, and would require reclassification (as hard incompatibilism for example, given that the universe is still assumed to be indeterministic&nbsp;\u2013 although the classification of hard determinism is technically valid also).<ref name=VanArragon2010 />\n\n=====Mind-body problem=====\n{{Main|Mind\u2013body problem}}\n{{See also|Philosophy of mind|Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Monism|Physicalism}}\n[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van Ren\u00e9 Descartes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]]]]\n\nThe idea of ''free will'' is one aspect of the [[Mind\u2013body problem|mind-body problem]], that is, consideration of the relation between [[mind]] (for example, consciousness, memory, and judgment) and body (for example, the [[human brain]] and [[nervous system]]). [[Philosophy of Mind|Philosophical models of mind]] are divided into [[Physicalism|physical]] and non-physical expositions.\n\n[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Substance dualism|Cartesian dualism]] holds that the mind is a nonphysical substance, the seat of consciousness and intelligence, and is not identical with physical states of the brain or body. It is suggested that although the two worlds do interact, each retains some measure of autonomy. Under cartesian dualism external mind is responsible for bodily action, although unconscious brain activity is often caused by external events (for example, the instantaneous reaction to being burned).<ref name=Peruzzi>See for example: {{cite book |title=Mind and Causality |chapter=Chapter 5: Mental causation and intentionality in a mind naturalizing theory |author=Sandro Nannini |editor=Alberto Peruzzi |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zYEPifPTQK4C&pg=PA75&lpg=PA77 |pages=69 ''ff'' |isbn=978-1-58811-475-4 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |year=2004}}</ref> Cartesian dualism implies that the physical world is not deterministic&nbsp;\u2013 and in which external mind controls (at least some) physical events, providing an interpretation of [[incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] free will. Stemming from Cartesian dualism, a formulation sometimes called ''[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Interactionism|interactionalist dualism]]'' suggests a two-way interaction, that some physical events cause some mental acts and some mental acts cause some physical events. One modern vision of the possible separation of mind and body is the [[Popper's three worlds|\"three-world\" formulation]] of [[Karl Popper|Popper]].<ref name=Popper>{{cite book |title=All Life is Problem Solving |chapter=Notes of a realist on the body-mind problem |author=Karl Raimund Popper |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pa3cZYwdq28C&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23 |pages=23 ''ff'' |isbn=978-0-415-17486-2 |year=1999 |publisher=Psychology Press |quote=The body-mind relationship...includes the problem of man's position in the physical world...'World 1'.

Other forms of epistemological pluralist dualism include [[psychophysical parallelism]] and [[epiphenomenalism]]. Epistemological pluralism is one view in which the mind-body problem is ''not'' reducible to the concepts of the natural sciences.\n\nA contrasting approach is called [[physicalism]]. Physicalism is a [[philosophical theory]] holding that everything that [[existence|exists]] is no more extensive than its [[physical properties]]; that is, that there are no non-physical substances (for example physically independent minds). Physicalism can be reductive or non-reductive. [[Reductive physicalism]] is grounded in the idea that everything in the world can actually be reduced analytically to its fundamental physical, or material, basis. Alternatively, [[non-reductive physicalism]] asserts that mental properties form a separate ontological class to physical properties: that mental states (such as [[qualia]]) are not ontologically reducible to physical states. Although one might suppose that mental states and neurological states are different in kind, that does not rule out the possibility that mental states are correlated with neurological states. In one such construction, [[anomalous monism]], mental events [[Supervenience|''supervene'']] on physical events, describing the [[emergence]] of mental properties correlated with physical properties&nbsp;\u2013 implying causal reducibility. Non-reductive physicalism is therefore often categorised as [[property dualism]] rather than [[monism]], yet other types of property dualism do not adhere to the causal reducibility of mental states (see epiphenomenalism).\n\n[[Incompatibilism]] requires a distinction between the mental and the physical, being a commentary on the incompatibility of (determined) physical reality and one's presumably distinct experience of will. Secondarily, [[metaphysical libertarianism|metaphysical libertarian]] free will must assert influence on physical reality, and where mind is responsible for such influence (as opposed to ordinary system randomness), it must be distinct from body to accomplish this. Both substance and property dualism offer such a distinction, and those particular models thereof that are not causally inert with respect to the physical world provide a basis for illustrating incompatibilist free will (i.e. interactionalist dualism and non-reductive physicalism).\n\nIt has been noted that the [[Physical law|laws of physics]] have yet to resolve the [[hard problem of consciousness]]:<ref name=Kalat>\nSee {{cite web |title=The hard problem of consciousness |author=Josh Weisberg |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hard-con/ |encyclopedia=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}} or {{cite book |title=Consciousness: \u00a79.9 Non-physical theories |chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness/#NonPhyThe |author=Robert Van Gulick |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2014 Edition) |editor=Edward N.

They believe freedom can be present or absent in a situation for reasons that have nothing to do with metaphysics. For instance, [[courts of law]] make judgments about whether individuals are acting under their own free will under certain circumstances without bringing in metaphysics. Similarly, [[political liberty]] is a non-metaphysical concept.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Likewise, some compatibilists define free will as freedom to act according to one's determined motives without hindrance from other individuals. So for example Aristotle in his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'',<ref>Susan Sauve Meyer, ''Aristotle on Moral Responsibility.'', Oxford 2012</ref> and the Stoic Chrysippus.<ref>[[Susanne Bobzien|Bobzien, Susanne]], ''Freedom and Determinism in Stoic Philosophy'', Oxford 1998, Chapter 6.</ref>\nIn contrast, the [[incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] positions are concerned with a sort of \"metaphysically free will\", which compatibilists claim has never been coherently defined. Compatibilists argue that determinism does not matter; though they disagree among themselves about what, in turn, ''does'' matter. To be a compatibilist, one need not endorse any particular conception of free will, but only deny that determinism is at odds with free will.<ref name=\"CompSEP\">McKenna, Michael, \"Compatibilism\", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2004 Edition), Edward N.

Freedom of choice (freedom to select one's will) is logically separate from freedom to ''implement'' that choice (freedom to enact one's will), although not all writers observe this distinction.<ref name=\"OConnor\"/> Nonetheless, some philosophers have defined free will as the absence of various impediments. Some \"modern compatibilists\", such as [[Harry Frankfurt]] and [[Daniel Dennett]], argue free will is simply freely choosing to do what constraints allow one to do.

The idea is that an individual can have conflicting desires at a first-order level and also have a desire about the various first-order desires (a second-order desire) to the effect that one of the desires prevails over the others. A person's will is identified with their effective first-order desire, that is, the one they act on, and this will is free if it was the desire the person wanted to act upon, that is, the person's second-order desire was effective. So, for example, there are \"wanton addicts\", \"unwilling addicts\" and \"willing addicts\". All three groups may have the conflicting first-order desires to want to take the drug they are addicted to and to not want to take it.\n\nThe first group, ''wanton addicts'', have no second-order desire not to take the drug. The second group, \"unwilling addicts\", have a second-order desire not to take the drug, while the third group, \"willing addicts\", have a second-order desire to take it. According to Frankfurt, the members of the first group are devoid of will and therefore are no longer persons. The members of the second group freely desire not to take the drug, but their will is overcome by the addiction. Finally, the members of the third group willingly take the drug they are addicted to. Frankfurt's theory can ramify to any number of levels. Critics of the theory point out that there is no certainty that conflicts will not arise even at the higher-order levels of desire and preference.<ref>Watson, D. (1982). ''Free Will''. New York: Oxford University Press.</ref> Others argue that Frankfurt offers no adequate explanation of how the various levels in the hierarchy mesh together.<ref>Fischer, John Martin, and Mark Ravizza.

(2003) ''Freedom Evolves''. Viking Books. {{ISBN|0-670-03186-0}}</ref> The basic reasoning is that, if one excludes God, an infinitely powerful [[demon]], and other such possibilities, then because of [[chaos theory|chaos]] and epistemic limits on the precision of our knowledge of the current state of the world, the future is ill-defined for all finite beings. The only well-defined things are \"expectations\". The ability to do \"otherwise\" only makes sense when dealing with these expectations, and not with some unknown and unknowable future.\n\nAccording to Dennett, because individuals have the ability to act differently from what anyone expects, free will can exist.<ref name=\"DD2\"/> Incompatibilists claim the problem with this idea is that we may be mere \"automata responding in predictable ways to stimuli in our environment\". Therefore, all of our actions are controlled by forces outside ourselves, or by random chance.<ref name=\"Kaney\">Kane, R. ''The Oxford Handbook to Free Will''.

[[Newcomb's paradox]] and other philosophical problems pose questions about free will and predictable outcomes of choices.\n\n====The physical mind====\n{{See also|Neuroscience of free will}}\n\n[[Compatibilist]] models of free will often consider deterministic relationships as discoverable in the physical world (including the brain).

Although compatibilism is generally aligned to (or is at least compatible with) physicalism, some compatibilist models describe the natural occurrences of deterministic deliberation in the brain in terms of the first person perspective of the conscious agent performing the deliberation.<ref name=Baumeister2 /> Such an approach has been considered a form of identity dualism. A description of \"how conscious experience might affect brains\" has been provided in which \"the experience of conscious free will is the first-person perspective of the neural correlates of choosing.\"<ref name=Baumeister2 />\n\nRecently{{when|date=August 2018}} [[Claudio Costa (philosopher)|Claudio Costa]] developed a neocompatibilist theory based on the causal theory of action that is complementary to classical compatibilism. According to him, physical, psychological and rational restrictions can interfere at different levels of the causal chain that would naturally lead to action. Correspondingly, there can be physical restrictions to the body, psychological restrictions to the decision, and rational restrictions to the formation of reasons (desires plus beliefs) that should lead to what we would call a reasonable action. The last two are usually called \"restrictions of free will\". The restriction at the level of reasons is particularly important since it can be motivated by external reasons that are insufficiently conscious to the agent. One example was the collective suicide led by [[Jim Jones]]. The suicidal agents were not conscious that their free will have been manipulated by external, even if ungrounded, reasons.<ref>Claudio Costa [http://www.example''Lines of Thought: Rethinking Philosophical Assumptions''] CSP, 2014, Ch. 7</ref>\n\n===Other views===\nSome philosophers' views are difficult to categorize as either compatibilist or incompatibilist, hard determinist or libertarian. For example, [[Ted Honderich]] holds the view that \"determinism is true, compatibilism and incompatibilism are both false\" and the real problem lies elsewhere. Honderich maintains that determinism is true because quantum phenomena are not events or things that can be located in space and time, but are [[Abstract object|abstract]] entities. Further, even if they were micro-level events, they do not seem to have any relevance to how the world is at the macroscopic level. He maintains that incompatibilism is false because, even if indeterminism is true, incompatibilists have not provided, and cannot provide, an adequate account of origination. He rejects compatibilism because it, like incompatibilism, assumes a single, fundamental notion of freedom. There are really two notions of freedom: voluntary action and origination. Both notions are required to explain freedom of will and responsibility. Both determinism and indeterminism are threats to such freedom. To abandon these notions of freedom would be to abandon moral responsibility. On the one side, we have our intuitions; on the other, the scientific facts. The \"new\" problem is how to resolve this conflict.<ref>Honderich, T.

He suggested that it might be accounted for by \"a false sensation or seeming experience\" (a ''velleity''), which is associated with many of our actions when we perform them. On reflection, we realize that they were necessary and determined all along.<ref>Hume, D. (1765). ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Indianapolis: Hacket Publishing Co.

But ''a posteriori'', through experience, he finds to his astonishment that he is not free, but subjected to necessity, that in spite of all his resolutions and reflections he does not change his conduct, and that from the beginning of his life to the end of it, he must carry out the very character which he himself condemns...<ref>Schopenhauer, Arthur, ''The Wisdom of Life'', p. 147</ref></blockquote>\nIn his essay ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Schopenhauer stated, \"You can do what you will, but in any given moment of your life you can ''will'' only one definite thing and absolutely nothing other than that one thing.\"<ref>[[Schopenhauer]], Arthur, ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Oxford: Basil Blackwell {{ISBN|0-631-14552-4}}</ref> According to Schopenhauer, [[phenomena]] do not have free will. However, [[Will (philosophy)|will]] [urging, craving, striving, wanting, and desiring] as [[Noumena|noumenon]] is free.\n\n====Free will as \"moral imagination\"====\n[[Rudolf Steiner]], who collaborated in a complete edition of Arthur Schopenhauer's work,<ref>{{cite web|title=Arthur Schopenhauers s\u00e4mtliche Werke in zw\u00f6lf B\u00e4nden.

Steiner (1861\u20131925) initially divides this into the two aspects of freedom: ''freedom of thought'' and ''freedom of action''. The controllable and uncontrollable aspects of decision making thereby are made logically separable, as pointed out in the introduction. This separation of ''will'' from ''action'' has a very long history, going back at least as far as [[Stoicism]] and the teachings of [[Chrysippus]] (279\u2013206 BCE), who separated external ''antecedent'' causes from the internal disposition receiving this cause.<ref name=Chrysippus>{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9lRD6feR3hEC&pg=PA529 |page=529 |chapter=Chapter VI: The Chyrsippean notion of fate: soft determinism |author=Keimpe Algra |isbn=978-0-521-25028-3 |year=1999}}</ref>\n\nSteiner then argues that inner freedom is achieved when we integrate our sensory impressions, which reflect the outer appearance of the world, with our thoughts, which lend coherence to these impressions and thereby disclose to us an understandable world. Acknowledging the many influences on our choices, he nevertheless points out that they do not preclude freedom unless we fail to recognise them. Steiner argues that outer freedom is attained by permeating our deeds with ''moral imagination.\u201d \u201cMoral\u201d in this case refers to action that is willed, while \u201cimagination\u201d refers to the mental capacity to envision conditions that do not already hold. Both of these functions are necessarily conditions for freedom. Steiner aims to show that these two aspects of inner and outer freedom are integral to one another, and that true freedom is only achieved when they are united.<ref>Steiner, R. (1964).

While he believed in free will on \"ethical grounds\", he did not believe that there was evidence for it on scientific grounds, nor did his own introspections support it.<ref>See Bricklin, Jonathan, \"A Variety of Religious Experience: William James and the Non-Reality of Free Will\", in Libet (1999), ''The Volitional Brain: Toward a Neuroscience of Free Will'' (Thorverton UK: Imprint Academic).</ref> Ultimately he believed that the problem of free will was a metaphysical issue and, therefore, could not be settled by science. Moreover, he did not accept incompatibilism as formulated below; he did not believe that the indeterminism of human actions was a prerequisite of moral responsibility. In his work ''[[Pragmatism]]'', he wrote that \"instinct and utility between them can safely be trusted to carry on the social business of punishment and praise\" regardless of metaphysical theories.<ref name=\"JW\">James, W. (1907) ''Pragmatism'' (1979 edition). Cambridge, MA: [[Harvard University Press]]</ref> He did believe that indeterminism is important as a \"doctrine of relief\"&nbsp;\u2013 it allows for the view that, although the world may be in many respects a bad place, it may, through individuals' actions, become a better one. Determinism, he argued, undermines [[meliorism]]&nbsp;\u2013 the idea that progress is a real concept leading to improvement in the world.<ref name=\"JW\"/>\n\n====Free will and views of causality====\n{{See also|Principle of sufficient reason}}\n\nIn 1739, [[David Hume]] in his ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' approached free will via the notion of causality. It was his position that causality was a mental construct used to explain the repeated association of events, and that one must examine more closely the relation between things ''regularly succeeding'' one another (descriptions of regularity in nature) and things that ''result'' in other things (things that cause or necessitate other things).<ref name=Kane>\n{{cite book |title=The significance of free will |author=Robert Kane |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dBlXH3FtwJIC&pg=PA226 |page= 226 |chapter=Notes to pages 74\u201381, note 22 |isbn=978-0-19-512656-3 |year=1998 |edition=Paperback}}\n</ref> According to Hume, 'causation' is on weak grounds: \"Once we realise that 'A must bring about B' is tantamount merely to 'Due to their constant conjunction, we are psychologically certain that B will follow A,' then we are left with a very weak notion of necessity.\"<ref name=Lorkowski>{{cite web |author=CM Lorkowski |date=November 7, 2010 |title=David Hume: Causation |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hume-cau/ |encyclopedia=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref>\n\nThis empiricist view was often denied by trying to prove the so-called [[apriority]] of causal law (i.e. that it precedes all experience and is rooted in the construction of the perceivable world):\n* [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s proof in ''Critique of Pure Reason'' (which referenced time and time ordering of causes and effects)<ref>Kant argued that, in order that human life is not just a \"dream\" (a random or projected by subjects juxtaposition of moments), the temporality of event A as before or after B must submit to a rule. An established order then implies the existence of some necessary conditions and causes, that is: sufficient bases (a so-called sufficient reason is the coincidence of all the necessary conditions). Without established causality, both [[Transcendental apperception|in subject]] and in the external world, the passing of time would be impossible, because it is essentially directional.

All changes take place according to the law of the connection of Cause and Effect.|online text of his proof]]</ref>\n* [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s proof from ''The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason'' (which referenced the so-called intellectuality of representations, that is, in other words, objects and [[qualia]] perceived with senses)<ref>Schopenhauer, who by the way continued and simplified Kant's system, argued (among others basing on optical illusions and the \"initial processing\") that it is the intellect or even the brain what generates the image of the world out of something else, by ''concluding from effects, e.g. optical, about appropriate causes'', e.g. concrete physical objects. Intellect in his works is strictly connected with recognizing causes and effects and associating them, it is somewhat close to the contemporary view of [[cerebral cortex]] and formation of associations.

But it does not of necessity belong to liberty that what is free should be the first cause of itself, as neither for one thing to be cause of another need it be the first cause. God, therefore, is the first cause, Who moves causes both natural and voluntary. And just as by moving natural causes He does not prevent their acts being natural, so by moving voluntary causes He does not deprive their actions of being voluntary: but rather is He the cause of this very thing in them; for He operates in each thing according to its own nature.\"<ref>Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa Theologiae'', Q83 A1.</ref><ref>Further discussion of this compatibilistic theory can be found in Thomas' ''Summa contra gentiles'', Book III about Providence, c. 88\u201391 (260\u2013267), where it is postulated that everything has its cause and it is again and again in detail referred also to all individual choices of man etc., even refuting opposite views.

In order to avoid, at least in concept, the absolution of man of any guilt he then notes the contingency of all that takes place, i.e. lack of ''direct'' necessity from God strictly with regard to a concrete (\"contingent\") act. A typical choice was not separately ordained to be so-and-so by God; St. Thomas says the choice is not necessary, but in fact that apparently means it was ''contingent'' with regard to God and the law of nature (as a specific case that could have not existed in other circumstances), and ''necessary'' with regard to its direct previous cause in will and intellect. (The contingency, or fortuity, is even intuitive under modern [[chaos theory]], where one can try to show that more and more developed products appearing in the evolution of a universe or, simpler, an automaton are [[chaos theory|chaotic]] with regard to its principles.)</ref>\n\n====Free will as a pseudo-problem====\nHistorically, most of the philosophical effort invested in resolving the dilemma has taken the form of close examination of definitions and ambiguities in the concepts designated by \"free\", \"freedom\", \"will\", \"choice\" and so forth.

The notion of compatibilist free will has been attributed to both [[Aristotle]] (fourth century BCE) and [[Epictetus]] (1st century CE); \"it was the fact that nothing hindered us from doing or choosing something that made us have control over them\".<ref name=bobzien1998determinism>{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| last = Bobzien| first = Susanne| title = Determinism and freedom in Stoic philosophy| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 1998| url = https://books.google.com/?id=7kmTeOjHIqkC&pg=PR12|quote=\"...Aristotle and Epictetus: In the latter authors it was the fact that nothing hindered us from doing or choosing something that made us have control over them.

It has traditionally meant (until the Enlightenment proposed its own meanings) lack of necessity in human will,<ref>A. Schopenhauer, ''On the Freedom of the Will'', c. 1, \"What is freedom?\"</ref> so that \"the will is free\" meant \"the will does not have to be such as it is\". This requirement was universally embraced by both incompatibilists and compatibilists.<ref>Hence the notion of contingency appeared as the very opposition of necessity, so that wherever a thing is considered dependent or relies upon another thing, it is contingent and thus not necessary.</ref>\n\n==Scientific approaches==\nScience has contributed to the free will problem in at least three ways. First, physics has addressed the question of whether nature is deterministic, which is viewed as crucial by incompatibilists (compatibilists, however, view it as irrelevant). Second, although free will can be defined in various ways, all of them involve aspects of the way people make decisions and initiate actions, which have been studied extensively by neuroscientists. Some of the experimental observations are widely viewed as implying that free will does not exist or is an illusion (but many philosophers see this as a misunderstanding). Third, psychologists have studied the beliefs that the majority of ordinary people hold about free will and its role in assigning moral responsibility.\n\n===Quantum physics===\nEarly scientific thought often portrayed the universe as deterministic&nbsp;\u2013 for example in the thought of [[Democritus]] or the [[C\u0101rv\u0101ka]]ns&nbsp;\u2013 and some thinkers claimed that the simple process of gathering sufficient [[physical information|information]] would allow them to predict future events with perfect accuracy. Modern science, on the other hand, is a mixture of deterministic and [[stochastic]] theories.<ref>Boniolo, G. and Vidali, P. (1999) ''Filosofia della Scienza'', Milan: Mondadori. {{ISBN|88-424-9359-7}}</ref> [[Quantum mechanics]] predicts events only in terms of probabilities, casting doubt on whether the universe is deterministic at all, although evolution of the universal state vector is completely deterministic. Current physical theories cannot resolve the question of whether determinism is true of the world, being very far from a potential [[Theory of Everything]], and open to many different [[Interpretation of quantum mechanics|interpretations]].<ref name=\"stanfordcausaldeterminism\">{{cite encyclopedia |first=Carl |last=Hoefer |title=Causal Determinism |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=2008 |accessdate=2008-11-01 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Is the Universe Deterministic? |first=Vlatko |last=Vedral |volume=192 |issue=2578 |date=2006-11-18 |journal=New Scientist |pages=52\u201355 |quote=Physics is simply unable to resolve the question of free will, although, if anything, it probably leans towards determinism.|doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(06)61122-6 }}</ref>\n\nAssuming that an indeterministic interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct, one may still object that such indeterminism is for all practical purposes confined to microscopic phenomena.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/dfwVariousHonderichKanebook.htm |author=Honderich, E.|title= Determinism as True, Compatibilism and Incompatibilism as Both False, and the Real Problem |publisher=Ucl.ac.uk |accessdate=2010-11-21}}</ref> This is not always the case: many macroscopic phenomena are based on quantum effects. For instance, some [[hardware random number generator]]s work by amplifying quantum effects into practically usable signals. A more significant question is whether the indeterminism of quantum mechanics allows for the traditional idea of free will (based on a perception of free will). If a person's action is, however, only a result of complete quantum randomness, mental processes as experienced have no influence on the probabilistic outcomes (such as volition).<ref name=\"RKane1\"/> According to many interpretations, non-determinism enables free will to exist,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/quantum-physics-free-will/ | title=The Quantum Physics of Free Will}}</ref> while others assert the opposite (because the action was not controllable by the physical being who claims to possess the free will).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/features/2000/lujan1.html |title=Infidels. \"Metaphysical Freedom\" |publisher=Infidels.org |accessdate=2010-11-21}}</ref>\n\n===Genetics===\nLike physicists, [[biology|biologists]] have frequently addressed questions related to free will.

A seminal experiment in this field was conducted by [[Benjamin Libet]] in the 1980s, in which he asked each subject to choose a random moment to flick their wrist while he measured the associated activity in their brain; in particular, the build-up of electrical signal called the [[readiness potential]] (after German [[Bereitschaftspotential]], which was discovered by [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] & [[L\u00fcder Deecke|Deecke]] in 1965.<ref>[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] & [[L\u00fcder Deecke|Deecke]], 1965.

Pfl\u00fcgers Arch 284: 1\u201317.</ref>) Although it was well known that the readiness potential reliably preceded the physical action, Libet asked whether it could be recorded before the conscious intention to move. To determine when subjects felt the intention to move, he asked them to watch the second hand of a clock. After making a movement, the volunteer reported the time on the clock when they first felt the conscious intention to move; this became known as Libet's W time.<ref name=\"LGW\" />\n\nLibet found that the ''unconscious'' brain activity of the readiness potential leading up to subjects' movements began approximately half a second before the subject was aware of a conscious intention to move.<ref name=\"LGW\"/><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X00044903 | last1 = Libet | first1 = B. | year = 1985 | title = Unconscious cerebral initiative and the role of conscious will in voluntary action | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/91ac5be13863401a85d8165b1ca273fa82dfddde| journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 529\u201366 }}</ref>\n\nThese studies of the timing between actions and the conscious decision bear upon the role of the brain in understanding free will. A subject's declaration of intention to move a finger appears ''after'' the brain has begun to implement the action, suggesting to some that unconsciously the brain has made the decision ''before'' the conscious mental act to do so. Some believe the implication is that free will was not involved in the decision and is an illusion. The first of these experiments reported the brain registered activity related to the move about 0.2 s before movement onset.<ref name=Libet>\n{{cite journal|title=Time of conscious intention to act in relation to onset of cerebral activity (readiness-potential) |author=Benjamin Libet |display-authors=etal |journal=Brain |year=1983 |volume=106 |pages=623\u201342 |url=http://trans-techresearch.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Brain-1983-LIBET.pdf |doi=10.1093/brain/106.3.623 |pmid=6640273 |issue=3 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526054605/http://trans-techresearch.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Brain-1983-LIBET.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-26 |df= }}</ref> However, these authors also found that awareness of action was ''anticipatory'' to activity in the muscle underlying the movement; the entire process resulting in action involves more steps than just the ''onset'' of brain activity.

In ''[[Freedom Evolves]]'', [[Daniel Dennett]] argues that a no-free-will conclusion is based on dubious assumptions about the location of consciousness, as well as questioning the accuracy and interpretation of Libet's results. Kornhuber and Deecke underlined that absence of conscious will during the early Bereitschaftspotential (termed BP1) is not a proof of the non-existence of free will, as also unconscious agendas may be free and non-deterministic. According to their suggestion, man has relative freedom, i.e. freedom in degrees, that can be increased or decreased through deliberate choices that involve both conscious and unconscious (panencephalic) processes.<ref>[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] & [[L\u00fcder Deecke|Deecke]], 2012.

Neuroscientific studies are valuable tools in developing models of how humans experience free will.\n\nFor example, people with [[Tourette syndrome]] and related [[tic disorder]]s make involuntary movements and utterances (called [[tic]]s) despite the fact that they would prefer not to do so when it is socially inappropriate. Tics are described as semi-voluntary or ''unvoluntary'',<ref name=TSADef>Tourette Syndrome Association.

The affected limb effectively demonstrates 'a will of its own.' The [[sense of agency]] does not emerge in conjunction with the overt appearance of the purposeful act even though the sense of ownership in relationship to the body part is maintained. This phenomenon corresponds with an impairment in the premotor mechanism manifested temporally by the appearance of the readiness potential recordable on the scalp several hundred milliseconds before the overt appearance of a spontaneous willed movement. Using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] with specialized multivariate analyses to study the temporal dimension in the activation of the cortical network associated with voluntary movement in human subjects, an anterior-to-posterior sequential activation process beginning in the supplementary motor area on the medial surface of the frontal lobe and progressing to the primary motor cortex and then to parietal cortex has been observed.<ref name=Kayser>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/hbm.20771 | last1 = Kayser | first1 = A.S. | last2 = Sun | first2 = F.T. | last3 = D'Esposito | first3 = M. | year = 2009 | title = A comparison of Granger causality and coherency in fMRI-based analysis of the motor system | url = | journal = Human Brain Mapping | volume = 30 | issue = 11| pages = 3475\u201394 | pmid = 19387980 | pmc = 2767459 }}</ref> The sense of agency thus appears to normally emerge in conjunction with this orderly sequential network activation incorporating premotor association cortices together with primary motor cortex.

In his book, ''The Illusion of Conscious Will,''<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://zodml.org/sites/default/files/%5bDaniel_M._Wegner%5d_The_Illusion_of_Conscious_Will.pdf|title=The Illusion of Conscious Will|last=Wegener|first=Daniel Merton|publisher=MIT Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-262-23222-7|location=|pages=}}</ref> Wegner summarizes what he believes is [[empirical evidence]] supporting the view that human perception of conscious control is an illusion. Wegner summarizes some empirical evidence that may suggest that the perception of conscious control is open to modification (or even manipulation). Wegner observes that one event is inferred to have caused a second event when two requirements are met:\n# The first event immediately precedes the second event, and\n# The first event is consistent with having caused the second event.\nFor example, if a person hears an explosion and sees a tree fall down that person is likely to infer that the explosion caused the tree to fall over. However, if the explosion occurs after the tree falls down (that is, the first requirement is not met), or rather than an explosion, the person hears the ring of a telephone (that is, the second requirement is not met), then that person is not likely to infer that either noise caused the tree to fall down.\n\nWegner has applied this principle to the inferences people make about their own conscious will. People typically experience a thought that is consistent with a behavior, and then they observe themselves performing this behavior.

The theory implies that people will more readily attribute free will to themselves rather than others. This prediction has been confirmed by three of Pronin and Kugler's experiments. When college students were asked about personal decisions in their own and their roommate's lives, they regarded their own choices as less predictable. Staff at a restaurant described their co-workers' lives as more determined (having fewer future possibilities) than their own lives. When weighing up the influence of different factors on behavior, students gave desires and intentions the strongest weight for their own behavior, but rated personality traits as most predictive of other people.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pronin|first=Emily|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, Vol. 41|editor=Mark P.

It preaches a middle doctrine, named ''[[pratitya-samutpada]]'' in [[Sanskrit]], often translated as \"inter-dependent arising\". This theory is also called \"Conditioned Genesis\" or \"[[Dependent Origination]]\". It teaches that every volition is a conditioned action as a result of ignorance. In part, it states that free will is inherently conditioned and not \"free\" to begin with. It is also part of the theory of [[karma in Buddhism]]. The concept of karma in Buddhism is different from the notion of karma in Hinduism. In Buddhism, the idea of karma is much less deterministic. The Buddhist notion of karma is primarily focused on the cause and effect of moral actions in this life, while in Hinduism the concept of karma is more often connected with determining one's [[destiny]] in future lives.\n\nIn Buddhism it is taught that the idea of absolute freedom of choice (that is that any human being could be completely free to make any choice) is unwise, because it denies the reality of one's physical needs and circumstances. Equally incorrect is the idea that humans have no choice in life or that their lives are pre-determined. To deny freedom would be to deny the efforts of Buddhists to make moral progress (through our capacity to freely choose compassionate action). ''Pubbekatahetuvada'', the belief that all happiness and suffering arise from previous actions, is considered a wrong view according to Buddhist doctrines. Because Buddhists also reject [[agency (philosophy)|agenthood]], the traditional compatibilist strategies are closed to them as well. Instead, the Buddhist philosophical strategy is to examine the metaphysics of causality. Ancient India had many heated arguments about the nature of causality with [[Jain]]s, [[Nyaya|Nyayists]], [[Samkhya|Samkhyists]], [[C\u0101rv\u0101ka]]ns, and Buddhists all taking slightly different lines. In many ways, the Buddhist position is closer to a theory of \"conditionality\" than a theory of \"causality\", especially as it is expounded by [[Nagarjuna]] in the ''[[M\u016blamadhyamakak\u0101rik\u0101]]''.<ref name=\"Gier\"/>\n\n==In theology==\n{{Main|Free will in theology}}\n\n=== Christianity ===\n[[File:Antonio Rodr\u00edguez - Saint Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|Augustine's view of free will and predestination would go on to have a profound impact on Christian theology]]\n\nThe notions of free will and predestination are heavily debated among Christians. Free will in the Christian sense is the ability to choose between good or evil. Among Catholics, there are those holding to [[Thomism]], adopted from what [[Thomas Aquinas]] put forth in the ''[[Summa Theologica]].'' There are also some holding to [[Molinism]] which was put forth by Jesuit priest [[Luis de Molina]]. Among Protestants there is [[Arminianism]], held primarily by [[Methodist]] and some [[Baptist]], and formulated by Dutch theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]]; and there is also [[Calvinism]] held by most in the [[Reformed]] tradition which was formulated by the French Reformed theologian, [[John Calvin]]. John Calvin was heavily influenced by [[Augustine of Hippo]] views on predestination put forth in his work ''On the Predestination of the Saints.'' [[Martin Luther]] seems to hold views on predestination similar to Calvinism in his ''[[On the Bondage of the Will]],'' thus rejecting free will. In condemnation of Calvin and Luther views, the Council of Trent declared that \"the free will of man, moved and excited by God, can by its consent co-operate with God, Who excites and invites its action; and that it can thereby dispose and prepare itself to obtain the grace of justification. The will can resist grace if it chooses. It is not like a lifeless thing, which remains purely passive. Weakened and diminished by Adam's fall, free will is yet not destroyed in the race (Sess. VI, cap. i and v).\"\n\n[[Paul the Apostle]] discusses Predestination in some of his Epistles.\n\n\"''For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the first-born among many brethren; and whom He predestined, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.''\u201d \u2014[[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 8:29\u201330\n\n\u201c''He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will.''\u201d \u2014[[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 1:5\n\nThe exact meaning of these verses has been debated by Christian theologians throughout history.\n\n=== Judaism ===\n[[File:Flickr - USCapitol - Maimonides (1135-1204).jpg|thumb|right|[[Bas relief]] of Maimonides in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].]]\n[[Maimonides]] reasoned that human beings have free will (at least in the context of choosing to do good or evil).  Without free will, the demands of [[Nevi'im#Latter Prophets|the prophets]] would have been meaningless, there would be no need for the [[Torah]], and justice could not be administered.  In Maimonides's view, human free will is granted by God as part of the universe's design.<ref>Rambam Teshuvah 5:4</ref>\n\n=== Islam ===\n\nIn [[Islam]] the theological issue is not usually how to reconcile free will with God's foreknowledge, but with God's ''jabr'', or divine commanding power. [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari|al-Ash'ari]] developed an \"acquisition\" or \"dual-agency\" form of compatibilism, in which human free will and divine ''jabr'' were both asserted, and which became a cornerstone of the dominant [[Ash'ari]] position.<ref>[[William Montgomery Watt|Watt, Montgomery]]. Free-Will and Predestination in Early Islam. Luzac & Co.: London 1948; [[Harry Austryn Wolfson|Wolfson, Harry]]. The Philosophy of Kalam, Harvard University Press 1976</ref> In [[Shia]] Islam, Ash'aris understanding of a higher balance toward [[predestination]] is challenged by most theologians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/mananddestiny/3.htm |title=Man and His Destiny |publisher=Al-islam.org |accessdate=2010-11-21}}</ref> Free will, according to Islamic doctrine is the main factor for man's accountability in his/her actions throughout life. Actions taken by people exercising free will are counted on the [[Day of Judgement]] because they are their own; however, the free will happens with the permission of God.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tosun|first=Ender|title=Guide to Understanding Islam|year=2012|location=Istanbul|isbn=978-605-63198-1-5|url=http://www.islamicinformationcenter.info/understandingislam.pdf|page=209}}</ref>\n\n=== Others ===\n\nThe philosopher [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] claimed that divine omnipotence cannot be separated from divine goodness.<ref>Jackson, Timothy P. (1998) \"Arminian edification: Kierkegaard on grace and free will\" in ''Cambridge Companion to Kierkegaard'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1998.</ref> As a truly omnipotent and good being, God could create beings with true freedom over God. Furthermore, God would voluntarily do so because \"the greatest good ... which can be done for a being, greater than anything else that one can do for it, is to be truly free.\"<ref>Kierkegaard, S\u00f8ren. (1848) ''Journals and Papers'', vol. III. Reprinted in Indiana University Press, Bloomington, 1967\u201378.</ref> [[Alvin Plantinga's free-will defense]] is a contemporary expansion of this theme, adding how God, free will, and [[problem of evil|evil]] are consistent.<ref>Mackie, J.L. (1955) \"Evil and Omnipotence\", ''Mind'', new series, vol. 64, pp. 200\u201312.</ref>\n\nSome philosophers follow [[William of Ockham]] in holding that necessity and possibility are defined with respect to a given point in time and a given matrix of empirical circumstances, and so something that is merely possible from the perspective of one observer may be necessary from the perspective of an omniscient.<ref name=\"ockham\">Ockham, William.

He also lectured upon [[Hesiod]], [[Anacreon (poet)|Anacreon]] and [[Pindar]], if he did not publish editions of them. He is further called an epic poet by the ''[[Suda]],'' and three epigrams in the ''[[Greek Anthology]]'' are assigned to him.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=973}}\n\nIn addition to his other scholarly work, Zenodotus introduced an organization system on the materials in the [[Library of Alexandria]] whereby texts were assigned to different rooms based on their subject matter- verse or prose, literary or scientific, and the various sub-classifications within each. Within their subjects, Zenodotus organized the works [[Alphabetical order|alphabetically]] by the first letter of the name of their author. The principle of alphabetic organization was introduced by Zenodotus.<ref>Casson, L. (2001). Libraries in the Ancient World. Ann Arbor, MI: Edwards Brothers.</ref> In addition, library staff attached a small tag to the end of each scroll. These tags gave authors' names as well as other identification had been added during the accessions procedure but often no title; many a roll contained more than one work, and many works, such as compilations of poetry warranted more than a single title. When a title was lacking, Zenodotus had to enroll and pass an eye over the text. Such tags enabled the scrolls to be easily returned to the area in which they had been classified, but also ensured that library users did not have to unroll each scroll in order to see what it contained. This was the first recorded use of [[metadata]], a landmark in library history.{{sfn|Phillips|2010}} Not until the second century A.D. does fuller alphabetization make an appearance.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Homeric scholarship]]\n*[[Alexandrine grammarians]]\n*[[Library of Alexandria]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{noteslist|refs=\n{{efn|name=\"Two Others|There appear to have been at least two other grammarians of the same name:\n#''Zenodotus of Alexandria'', surnamed {{lang|grc|\u1f41 \u1f10\u03bd \u1f04\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9}} (''ho en astei'', \"the one from the city\", i.e. Alexandria)\n#''Zenodotus of Mallus'', the disciple of [[Crates of Mallus|Crates]], who like his master attacked [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]]}}\n}}\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite journal|last=Phillips |first=Heather A. |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/libphilprac/417/ |title=The Great Library of Alexandria? |journal=Library Philosophy and Practice |date=August 2010 |issn=1522-0222 |ref=harv}}\n\n'''Attribution:'''\n*{{EB1911|wstitle=Zenodotus |volume=28 |page=972}} Endnotes:\n** [[Friedrich August Wolf|F.
