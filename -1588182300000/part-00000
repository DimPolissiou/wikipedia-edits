Classified as a [[new religious movement]], its practitioners harken back to the [[Slavic paganism|historical belief systems]] of the [[Slavs|Slavic peoples]] of [[Central and Eastern Europe]]. \"Rodnovery\" is a widely accepted self-descriptor within the community, although there are Rodnover organisations which further characterise the religion as '''[[Vedism]]''', '''[[Orthodoxy]]''', and '''[[Old Believers|Old Belief]]'''.\n\n<!--Slavic Native Faith beliefs and practices-->  \nRodnovers typically regard their religion as a faithful continuation of ancient beliefs that survived as folk religion or as conscious \"double belief\" following the [[Christianisation of the Slavs]] in the Middle Ages.{{refn|group=note|The idea that indigenous Slavic religion was preserved in a conscious \"double belief\" following the Christianisation of the Slavs is put into question by some contemporary scholars.}} Rodnovery draws upon surviving historical and archaeological sources, folk religion and also non-Slavic sources such as [[Hinduism]] (as they are believed to be coming from the same [[Proto-Indo-European mythology|Proto-Indo-European]] source). [[Slavic Native Faith's theology and cosmology|Rodnover theology and cosmology]] may be described as [[pantheism]] and [[polytheism]]\u2014worship of the supreme God of the universe and of the multiple gods, ancestors and spirits of nature identified through Slavic culture. Adherents usually meet together in groups to conduct religious ceremonies. These typically entail the invocation of gods, sacrifices and the pouring of libations, dances and a communal meal.\n\n<!--Slavic Native Faith views on morality and Slavic identity-->  \nRodnover ethical thinking emphasises the good of the collective over the rights of the individual. The religion is [[patriarchy|patriarchal]], and attitudes towards sex and gender are generally conservative.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Rodnovery has developed distinctive strains of [[Slavic Native Faith's identity and political philosophy|political and identitary philosophy]]. Rodnover organisations often characterise themselves as [[ethnic religion]]s, emphasising that the religion is bound to Slavic ethnicity. This often manifests as [[ethnic nationalism]], opposition to [[miscegenation]] and the belief in the fundamental difference of racial groups. Rodnovers often glorify Slavic history, criticising the impact of Christianity in Slavic countries and arguing that these nations will play a central role in the world's future. Rodnovers share a strong feeling that their religion represents a paradigmatic shift which will overcome [[Slavic Native Faith and mono-ideologies|the mental constraints imposed through feudalism and the continuation of what they call \"mono-ideologies\"]].\n\n<!--History of the movement--> \nThe contemporary organised Rodnovery movement arose from a multiplicity of sources and charismatic leaders just at the brink of the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] and spread rapidly by the mid-1990s and the 2000s. Antecedents are to be found in late 18th- and 19th-century Slavic [[Romanticism]], which glorified the pre-Christian beliefs of Slavic societies. Active religious practitioners devoted to establishing Slavic Native Faith appeared in Poland and Ukraine in the 1930s and 1940s. Following the [[Second World War]] and the establishment of [[communist state]]s throughout the [[Eastern Bloc]], new variants were established by Slavic emigrants living in Western countries, being later introduced in Central and Eastern European countries after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

A. E. Musin, an academic and deacon of the Russian Orthodox Church published an article about the \"problem of double belief\" as recently as 1991. In this article he divides scholars between those who say that Russian Orthodoxy adapted to entrenched indigenous faith, continuing the Soviet idea of an \"undefeated paganism\", and those who say that Russian Orthodoxy is an out-and-out syncretic religion.{{sfn|Rock|2007|p=110}} Slavic Native Faith adherents, as far as they are concerned, believe that they can take traditional folk culture, remove the obviously Christian elements and be left with something that authentically reflects the historical beliefs of the Slavic peoples.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=134}}\n\nIvakhiv says that despite the intense efforts of Christian authorities, the Christianisation of the Slavs, and especially of Russians, was very slow and resulted in a \"thorough synthesis of Pagan and Christian elements\", reflected for instance in the refashioning of gods as Christian saints ([[Perun]] as [[Elijah|Saint Elias]], [[Veles (god)|Veles]] as [[Saint Blaise|Saint Blasius]] and [[Yarilo]] as [[Saint George]]) and in the overlapping of Christian festivals on Pagan ones.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|pp=212\u2013214}} The scholar of Russian folk religion Linda J.

The shared underpinning is a [[pantheism|pantheistic]] view that is [[holism|holistic]] in its understanding of the universe.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=102}} Similarly to the ancient Slavic religion, a common theological stance among Rodnovers is that of [[monism]], by which the many different gods (polytheism) are seen as manifestations of the single, universal God\u2014generally identified by the concept of ''[[Rod (Slavic religion)|Rod]]'',{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=65}} also known as ''Sud'' (\"Judge\") and ''Prabog'' (\"Pre-God\", \"First God\") among [[South Slavs]].{{sfn|Mathieu-Colas|2017}} In the Russian and Ukrainian centres of Rodnover theology, the concept of Rod has been emphasised as particularly important.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}}{{sfn|Lesiv|2017|p=142}}\n\nThe root *''rod'' is attested in sources about pre-Christian religion referring to divinity and ancestrality.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}}{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=288}} Mathieu-Colas defines Rod as the \"primordial God\", but the term also literally means the generative power of family and \"kin\", \"birth\", \"origin\" and \"fate\" as well.{{sfn|Mathieu-Colas|2017}} Its negative form, ''urod'', means something wrenched, deformed, degenerated, monstrous.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=65}} Sometimes, the meaning of the word is left deliberately obscure among Rodnovers, allowing for a variety of different interpretations.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}} Cosmologically speaking, Rod is conceived as the spring of universal [[emanationism|emanation]], which articulates in a cosmic hierarchy of gods; Rod expresses itself as ''Prav'' (literally \"Right\" or \"Order\"; cf. Greek ''[[Orthotes]]'', Sanskrit ''[[\u1e5ata]]'') in primordial undeterminacy ([[chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]]), through a dual dynamism, represented by [[Belobog]] (\"White God\") and [[Chernobog]] (\"Black God\"), the forces of waxing and waning, and then giving rise to the world in its three qualities, ''[[Prav-Yav-Nav]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Rabotkina|1y=2013|1p=240|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=1998|2p=8, note 35}} [[Triglav (mythology)|Triglav]] (\"Three-Headed One\") and [[Svetovid]] (\"Worldseer\") are concepts representing the ''[[axis mundi]]'' and, respectively, the three qualities of reality and their realisation in the four dimensions of space.{{sfn|Dynda|2014|loc=''passim''}}\n\nWhen emphasising this monism, Rodnovers may define themselves as ''rodnianin'', \"believers in God\"{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=269}} (or \"in nativity\", \"in genuinity\"). Already the pioneering Ukrainian leader Shaian argued that God manifests as a variety of different deities.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=130}} This theological explanation is called \"manifestationism\" by some contemporary Rodnovers and implies the idea of a spirit\u2013matter continuum; the different gods, who proceed from the supreme God, generate differing categories of things not as their external creations (as objects), but embodying themselves as these entities. In their view, beings are the progeny of gods; even phenomena such as the thunder are conceived in this way as embodiments of these gods (in this case, [[Perun]]).{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=66}} In the wake of this theology, it is common among Slavic Native Faith practitioners to say that \"we are not God's slaves, but God's sons\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}} Some Rodnover groups espouse the idea that specific Slavic populations are the sons of peculiar facets of God; for instance, groups who rely upon the tenth-century manuscript ''The Lay of Igor's Host'' may affirm the idea that Russians are the grandchildren of [[Dazhbog]] (the \"Giving God\", \"Day God\").{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}}\n\nPantheons of deities are not unified among practitioners of Slavic Native Faith.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|pp=289\u2013290}} Different Rodnover groups often have a preference for a particular deity over others.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=290}} The Union of Russian Rodnover Communities founded and led by Vadim Kazakov recognises a pantheon of over thirty deities emanated by the supreme Rod;<ref name=\"Adversus paganos\">{{cite magazine |last1=Belov |first1=Maxim |last2=Garanov |first2=Yuri |date=10 February 2015 |title=Adversus Paganos |publisher=Journal of the Ascension Cathedral of Astrakhan |website=astrsobor.ru |url=http://astrsobor.ru/adversus-paganos-novaya-istoriya-protiv-yazychnikov/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170523191143/http://astrsobor.ru/adversus-paganos-novaya-istoriya-protiv-yazychnikov/ |archive-date=23 May 2017 |access-date=7 July 2017}}</ref> these include attested deities from Slavic pre-Christian and folk traditions, Slavicised Hindu deities (such as ''Vyshen'', i.e. [[Vishnu]], and ''Intra'', i.e. [[Indra]]), Iranian deities (such as [[Simargl]] and Khors), deities from the ''Book of Veles'' (such as Pchelich) and figures from Slavic folk tales such as the wizard [[Koschei]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=95}} Another Russian Rodnover leader, Nikolai Speransky (''[[volkhv]]'' Velimir), emphasises a [[dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] eternal struggle between forces of [[good and evil]]; the former represented by Belobog, who created the human soul, and the latter by Chernobog, who created the human body.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=93}} Rodnovers also believe and worship [[tutelary deity|tutelary deities]] of specific elements, lands and environments,{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=204}} such as waters, forests and the household. Gods may be subject to functional changes among modern Rodnovers; for instance, the traditional god of livestock and poetry [[Veles (god)|Veles]] is called upon as the god of literature and communication.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=66}}\n\nIn Ukraine, there has been a debate as to whether the religion should be monotheistic or polytheistic.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013a|p=90}} In keeping with the pre-Christian belief systems of the region, the groups who inherit Volodymyr Shaian's tradition, among others, espouse polytheism.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013a|p=90}} Conversely, Sylenko's [[Native Ukrainian National Faith]] (RUNVira; also called \"Sylenkoism\") regards itself as monotheistic and focuses its worship upon a single God who they identify with the name Dazhbog.{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005c|1p=225|2a1=Lesiv|2y=2013a|2p=90|3a1=Lesiv|3y=2013b|3p=130}} For members of this group, Dazhbog is regarded as the life-giving energy of the cosmos.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=225}}\n\nSylenko characterised Dazhbog as \"light, endlessness, gravitation, eternity, movement, action, the energy of unconscious and conscious Being\".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=225}} Based on this description, Ivakhiv argued that Sylenkoite theology might better be regarded as [[pantheism|pantheistic]] or [[panentheism|panentheistic]] rather than monotheistic.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=225}} Sylenko acknowledged that the ancient Ukrainian-Rus were polytheists but believed that a monotheistic view reflected an evolution in human spiritual development and thus should be adopted.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013a|p=91}} A similar view is adopted by Russian [[Ynglism]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=66}} Lesiv recorded one RUNVira member who related that \"we cannot believe in various forest, field and water spirits today. Yes, our ancestors believed in these things but we should not any longer\".{{sfn|Lesiv|2013a|p=92}} For Native Ukrainian National Faith's members, polytheism is regarded as backward.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013a|p=92}} Some polytheist Rodnovers have regarded the approach adopted by Sylenko's followers as an inauthentic approach to the religion.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=223}}\n\n===Morality and ethics===\n[[File:Ukrainian Rodnovers worshipping Perun in Ternopil Oblast, Ukraine.png|thumb|upright|Ukrainian Rodnovers worshipping a ''kapy'' (pole) of [[Perun]], in [[Ternopil Oblast]], Ukraine.]]\n\nRodnovery emphasises the \"this-worldliness\" of morality and moral thinking, seen as a voluntary and thoughtful responsibility towards the others that sprouts from the awareness of the interconnectedness of all things and of the continuity of spirit\u2013matter and not as a strict set of rules. Although some Rodnovers believe in an afterlife, ''[[Vyraj|Iriy]]'' or ''Vyriy'', they argue that retribution is not deferred to such future; since gods manifest themselves as the natural phenomena, and in people as lineage descendants, Rodnovers believe that actions and their outcomes unfold and are to be dealt with in the present world.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=188}} People are viewed as having unique responsibilities towards their own contexts: for instance, the right of parents is to take care of their children, the right of ancestors is to be honoured, and the land deserves to be recked and cultivated.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=79}} Rodnovers blame Christianity for transferring personal responsibility into a transcendent future, when actions will be judged by God and people either smitten or forgiven for their sins, in fact exempting people from responsibility. According to Rodnovers, justice and truth have to be realised in this life, so that \"[[turning the other cheek]]\", waiving agency and intervention in the things of this world, is considered immoral and equivalent to welcoming wrongness.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=96}} In other words, fleeing from the commitment towards the forces at play in the present context is the same as denying the gods; it disrupts morality, impairing the individual, society and the world itself.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=79}}\n\n[[File:Rodnover wedding in Russia.jpg|thumb|left|Rodnover wedding ceremony.]]\n\nRodnovers value individual responsibility as the cornerstone for the further maturation of humanity, equating the conversion to Rodnovery with such maturation.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=142}} This emphasis on individuality is not at odds with the value of solidarity, since collective responsibility is seen as arising from the union of the right free decisions of reflexive individuals. By using terms of [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]], Aitamurto says that what Rodnovers reject is \"egoistic individualism\", not \"moral individualism\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=116}} Immediately related to the morality of a responsible community is the respect for the natural world in general, or what Aitamurto defines \"ecological responsibility\".{{sfnm|1a1=Aitamurto|1y=2016|1p=138|2a1=Simpson|2y=2013|2p=120}}\n\nRodnover ethics deal with a wide range of contemporary social issues.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2000|p=18}} Through the categories of contemporary sociology, Rodnover views are generally defined [[conservatism|conservative]]. Aitamurto summarised these views as: patriarchy, solidarity and homogeneity, with the latter two seen as intrinsically related.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|p=4}} Shnirelman observed that Rodnovers' calls for social justice tend to apply only to their own perceived ethnic community.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}} There have been difficulties with Rodnover involvement in the wider environmentalist movement as a result of many environmentalists' unease with the racial and anti-Christian themes that are prominent in the religion.{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=121}}\n\nWithin Rodnovery, gender roles are generally conservative.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Rodnovers often subscribe to the view that men and women are fundamentally different and thus their tasks also differ.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Men are seen as innately disposed towards \"public\" life and abstract thought, while women are seen as better realising themselves in the \"private\" administration of the family and the resources of the house.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=86}} Rodnovers therefore reinforce traditional values in Slavic countries rather than being [[counterculture|countercultural]], presenting themselves as a stabilising and responsible social force. They may even view their upholding of social traditionalism as a counterculture in itself, standing in the face of [[modernism]] and [[globalism]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=161}}\n\nIdeas and practices perceived as coming from Western liberal society\u2014which Rodnovers perceive as degenerate\u2014are denounced as threats to Slavic culture; for instance, alcohol and drug consumption, various sexual behaviours and [[miscegenation]] are commonly rejected by Rodnovers, while they emphasise healthy family life in harmonious environments.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=88}} Aitamurto and Gaidukov noted that \"hardly any women\" in Russian Rodnovery would call themselves [[feminism|feminists]], partly due to Rodnover beliefs on gender and partly due to the negative associations that the word \"feminism\" has in Russian culture.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} In adopting such a conservative stance to sexual ethics, practitioners of Rodnovery can adopt [[misogyny|misogynistic]] and [[homophobia|homophobic]] attitudes.{{sfn|Dost\u00e1lov\u00e1|2013|p=178}} Aitamurto and Gaidukov noted that it would be \"difficult to imagine that any Rodnover community would accept members who are openly homosexual\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Many groups in both Russia and Ukraine critique mixed-race unions;{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2013|1pp=72\u201373|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=2017|2p=98|3a1=Lesiv|3y=2017|3p=143}} for instance, the [[Ynglist Church]]'s doctrine articulates a condemnation of race mixing as unhealthy.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=88}}\n\nThe Russian-based Circle of Pagan Tradition distinguishes itself for its more accommodating positions\u2014compared to those of other organisations\u2014about the coexistence of different lifestyles, holding that tolerance should be a key value.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=201}} They reflect their stance in the slogan \"unity in diversity\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=201}} This organisation has also placed greater emphasis on environmentalist issues over nationalist ones, and has called on its members to vote for the [[Green Russia]] party.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=202}}\n\n==Identity and political philosophy==\n{{Main|Slavic Native Faith's identity and political philosophy}}\n[[File:Slavic europe.svg|thumb|upright|Map of countries in Central and Eastern Europe where Slavic languages predominate.

According to them, such criticism is an attempt to \"suppress knowledge\" carried forward either by Soviet-style [[scientism]] or by \"Judaic cosmopolitan\" forces.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005a|p=13}} Other modern literary works that have influenced the movement, albeit on a smaller scale, include ''The Songs of the Bird Gamayon'', ''Koliada's Book of Stars'', ''The Song of the Victory on the Jewish Khazaria of Sviatoslav the Brave'' or ''The Rigveda of Kiev''.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=291}} Some Rodnovers pejoratively dismiss movements such as that of the ''Vseyasvetnaya gramota'' as \"[[New Age]]\" and claim that reliance on them discredits the Slavic Native Faith movement.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=159}}\n\n[[File:Ukraine, outdoor Sylenkoite worship (0).png|thumb|left|Worship ceremony led by the priests of the General Fire of Slavic Native Faith.]]\n\nSome Rodnovers believe that Slavs constitute a race whose origin is distinct from that of other ethnic groups.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=187}} According to them, Slavs are the directest descendants of an ancient Aryan race, whom they equate with the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=90}} Some Rodnovers believe that the Aryans originated at the [[North Pole]] but moved south as a result of declining temperatures,{{sfnm|1a1=Aitamurto|1y=2006|1p=187|2a1=Laruelle|2y=2008|2p=292}} while others claim that the Aryans germinated in Russia's southern steppes.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=292}} In claiming an Aryan ancestry, Slavic Native Faith practitioners legitimise their cultural borrowing from other ethno-cultural groups who they claim are also Aryan descendants, such as the Germanic peoples or those of the Indian subcontinent.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=103}}\n\nSome Rodnovers regard Slavic countries as having a messianic role in humanity's future, for instance with the belief that Ukraine will be the world's future geopolitical centre,{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005a|p=15}} or that Russia will be the home of a post-apocalyptic civilisation which will survive the demise of the Western world.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=189}} Such racially eschatological beliefs are explicitly rejected by other Rodnovers, like the Circle of Pagan Tradition.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=202}}\n\nAlthough their understanding of the past is typically rooted in spiritual conviction rather than in arguments that would be acceptable within academia, many Rodnovers seek to promote their beliefs about the past among academics.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=155}} For instance, in 2002 Serbian Rodnovers established Svevlad, a research group devoted to historical Slavic religion which simulated academic discourse but was \"highly selective, unsystematic, and distorted\" in its examination of the evidence.{{sfn|Radulovic|2017|pp=60\u201361}} In several Slavic countries, many archaeologists and historians have been hesitant about giving credence to Rodnover interpretations of the past.{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=2013|1p=120|2a1=Aitamurto|2a2=Gaidukov|2y=2013|2p=155}} In turn, practitioners have accused academics of being part of a conspiracy to conceal the truth about the past.{{sfnm|1a1=Laruelle|1y=2008|1p=292|2a1=Radulovic|2y=2017|2pp=61\u201362}}\n\n===Views on Christianity===\n{{main|Slavic Native Faith and mono-ideologies}}\n[[File:Initiation of a woman into the Native Faith (Rodnovery), near Moscow.jpg|thumb|The initiation of a woman into Rodnovery, in [[Moscow]], Russia.]]\n\nMany Rodnovers actively reject Christianity or adopt anti-Christian views.{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005c|1p=223|2a1=Lesiv|2y=2013a|2p=7|3a1=Simpson|3y=2013|3p=121}} Practitioners generally regard [[Abrahamic religions]] as a destructive force that erodes what they view as organic peoples,{{sfn|Shnirelman|2007|pp=43\u201344}} with Christianity being perceived as a foreign force that is destroying Slavic culture.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=131}} Some Rodnovers also take a hostile stance toward [[Judaism]], which they regard as having spawned Christianity,{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=223}} or believe that Christianity has left Russia under the control of Jews.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=292}} Rodnovers often reject Christian ideas of humility, regarding them as antithetical to a Rodnover emphasis on courage and fighting spirit.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=73}} Christianity is considered as a system that destroys morality by casting human responsibility away from the present world and into a transcendent future,{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=96}} and it is also criticised as being anthropocentric, and thus responsible for ecological disruption.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=290}} In Russia, Rodnovers often criticise Christianity for its claim to have a monopoly on truth;

For instance, the Association of Sons and Daughters of Ukraine of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (OSIDU RUNVira), one of the churches of the Ukrainian [[Sylenkoite]] branch of Rodnovery, holds unique weekly \"Holy Hour of Self-Realisation\", in which practitioners read from Sylenko's ''Maha Vira'', sermons are given, the ancestors are commemorated, and prayers and hymns are given. The meeting ends with the singing of ''[[Shche ne vmerla Ukraina]]'', the [[national anthem]] of Ukraine.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=226}} The rival and near homonymous Association of Sons and Daughters of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (OSID RUNVira), also conducts weekly Holy Hours, but incorporates a wider selection of sources\u2014such as readings from the pan-Rodnover ''Book of Veles'' or the poetry of [[Taras Shevchenko]]\u2014into the proceedings.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=228}} The structure of these Syenkoite rites is modelled on those of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=128}}\n\n[[File:Koliada 2017 near Naro-Fominsk (1).jpg|thumb|left|Rodnovers engaged in a circle-dance around a bonfire, celebrating the [[Koliada]] festival in [[Naro-Fominsk]], [[Moscow Oblast]], Russia.]]\n\nAdherents of Slavic Native Faith often adopt elements from recorded folk culture. Lesiv described this process as one of \"Paganisation\", whereby Christian or otherwise non-Pagan elements are deliberately given a new meaning and purpose.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=136}} In turn, some of these \"Paganised\" folk practices have been transmitted through the wider population, who has regarded them as authentic traditional practices.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|pp=138\u2013139}} Some Rodnover groups also incorporate non-Slavic practices.{{sfnm|1a1=Lesiv|1y=2013b|1p=128|2a1=Simpson|2y=2017|2p=81}} For instance, a group of Polish Rodnovers has been documented to use the [[fire poi]] at their Midsummer festivities, a practice that originally developed in Pacific regions during the mid-20th century.{{sfn|Simpson|2017|p=80}} The Ukrainian organisation Ancestral Fire of the Native Orthodox Faith promotes a healing technique called ''Zhyva'' that has close similarities to the Japanese practice of [[reiki]].{{sfn|Lesiv|2017|p=142}} In another instance, Lesiv observed a Ukrainian Rodnover who legitimised the practice of [[yoga]] by claiming that this spiritual tradition had originally been developed by the ancestors of modern-day Ukrainians.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=137}} Another example are groups within [[Peterburgian Vedism]] which incorporate [[Ivanovism|Ivanovite]] healing techniques.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=35}}\n\nRituals take place at secluded, consecrated spaces, and generally include the invocation of gods, sacrifices and the pouring of [[libation]]s, circle-dances (''horovod'' or simply ''kolo'', \"circle\"), and usually end with a communal meal. Some Rodnover organisations require that participants wear traditional Slavic clothes for such gatherings, although there is much freedom in interpreting what constitutes \"traditional clothes\", this definition generally referring to folkloric needlecraft open to a wide range of artistic patterns.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=70}}{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=290}}\n\nBesides the rites of outgang from Christianity (''raskrestitsia''), Rodnovers practise rituals of initiation of the new members into the community of Slavic Native Faith. Central to this conversion is the \"renaming\", that is to say the adoption of a new Slavic name, symbolising the death and rebirth of the convert into the new community. Some groups, such as male brotherhoods, practise the cutting of a second \"life line\" on the palm of the hand of converts, symbolising the new \"blood bond\" that is formed with other members.{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=292}}\n\n===Communities, citadels and temples===\n[[File:\u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044c.jpg|thumb|A building of the Slavic Kremlin Vitalya Sundakova in the [[Podolsky District]], Moscow Oblast, Russia.]]\n\nRodnover organisations have inherited ideas of commonality and social governance from Slavic and Russian history.

Local Rodnover groups usually call themselves ''obshchina'' (the term for traditional peasant communities), while ''skhod'', ''sobor'' and ''mir'' are used for informal meetings or to refer to traditional Russian ideas of commonality. Another term for a community, though not frequently used, is ''artel''.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|p=4}} A form of organisation of Rodnover communities consists in the establishment of places for common living, such as fortresses (''[[kremlin]]'') or citadels (''gorodok''), in which temples are umbegone by buildings for various social uses.

They are those responsible for holding rites for worshipping the gods and leading communities and religious festivals. Volkhvs are the higher rank of the sacerdotal hierarchy, while zhrets are of a lower authority.{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=272, note 11}}\n\nThough the majority of Rodnover priests are males, Rodnover groups do not exclude women from the priesthood, so that a parallel female priesthood is constituted by the two ranks of ''zhritsa'' and ''vedunya'' (\"seeresses\"). Prestige is not limited to male priests; a priestess, [[Halyna Lozko]] from Ukraine, is an acknowledged authority within the Rodnover movement.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|p=4}} In 2012, a number of Rodnover organisations in Russia made an agreement for the mutual recognition of their priesthood and for the uniformisation of ordination policies.{{sfn|Skrylnikov|2016}}\n\n===Calendars and holidays===\n{{Main|Slavic Native Faith's calendars and holidays}}\n[[File:Ukrainian Rodnovers worshipping a goddess at Vodokres holiday.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian Rodnovers worshipping a goddess' pole on Vodokre\u0161 holiday in the countryside.]]\n\nAccording to Aitamurto, rituals play \"a central role in defining, learning and transmitting the religion\", and thus they constitute an important complement to theology within Rodnovery. Ceremonial accuracy is often considered essential for the efficacy of a ritual. Nevertheless, Rodnover rituals may be regarded as flexible frameworks, wherein there is room for elaboration and experimentation. The sources that Rodnovers rely upon are valued scholars like [[Vladimir Dal]] and [[Boris Rybakov]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=67}}\n\nThe common Rodnover ritual calendar is based on the Slavic folk tradition, whose crucial events are the four [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es set in the four phases of the year.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=67}} Slavic Native Faith has been described as following \"the cycles of nature\".{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|p=109}} A festival that is believed to be the most important by many Rodnovers is that of the summer solstice, the [[Kupala Night|''Kupala'' Night]] (June 23\u201324), although also important are the winter solstice festival ''Karachun'' and ''[[Koliada]]'' (December 24\u201325), and the spring equinox festival Shrovetide\u2014called ''Komoeditsa'' or ''[[Maslenitsa]]'' (March 24). Festivals celebrated in spring include the Day of Yarilo and the ''Krasnaya Gorka'' (literally \"Red Hill\", celebrated between April 30\u2013May 1), the latter dedicated to ancestor worship; while in autumn Rodnovers celebrate the Day of [[Marzanna]] and that of Mokosh (November 10). Other festivals include the Days of Veles (multiple, in January and February) and the Day of Perun (August 2), the latter considered to be the most important holiday of the year by some Rodnover organisations.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=67}}\n\nUsually, the organisation of festivals involves three layers of society: there is a patronising \"core\" of practitioners, who are often professionally affirmed people, usually belonging to the intellectual class; then there is the population of committed adherents; and then there is a loose \"periphery\" constituted by sympathisers, generally relatives and friends of the committed followers. Aitmurto notes that festivals are usually set in the evenings, the weekends and on public holidays, in order to allow everyone's participation.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=64}} Shizhenskii and Aitamurto described one Kupala festival, held over the course of three days outside [[Maloyaroslavets]] in Russia; at this event, weddings, purification rituals, and name-giving ceremonies took place, accompanied by musical performances, martial arts, and folkloric plays, while a market sold traditional handicrafts.{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|p=120}} The interplay with the gods and the cycle of nature which they represent is displayed through large-scale ceremonies which Aitamurto defines as \"aesthetically lavish\", vectors of a great deal of creativity. For instance, the end of winter is marked by burning straw images of Marzanna, the goddess of winter, while celebrating the victory of Yarilo, the god of the full swing of natural forces; the end of summer, instead, is marked by the burial of an image of Yarilo.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=69}}\n\nSome Slavic Native Faith organisations have appropriated or reappropriated Christian festivals.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|pp=138\u2013139}} The same Kupala Night is a reappropriation, being the day of the year when Christian churches set the [[Nativity of Saint John the Baptist]].{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|pp=138\u2013139}} The calendar of one of the organisations of the [[Native Ukrainian National Faith]] includes holidays that have been de-Christianised, such as a \"Christmas of Dazhboh's Light\" and an \"Easter of the Eternal Resurrection\".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=228}} The common Rodnover calendar leaves room for national and regional variations; for instance, the same Native Ukrainian National Faith's organisation observes holidays devoted to Ukrainian national heroes such as Shevchenko, [[Ivan Franko]], [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], and [[Hryhory Skovoroda]], as well as those devoted to more abstract concepts such as \"Ukrainian Ancient Literature\" and \"New Ukrainian Literature\".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=28}}\n\n===Artistic and other pursuits===\n[[File:Festival Ringing Cedars 2014 June 22 \u0418\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 60.jpg|thumb|Russian Rodnovers engaged in a martial arts dare.]]\n\nA number of Rodnovers have expressed their religion through visual arts; among practitioners, [[Svyatoslav I of Kiev]] is one of the most popular subjects.<ref name=Gizbrekht2016>{{cite article |last=Gizbrekht |first=Andrey Ivanovich |year=2016 |title=\u041e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u044b \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u0434\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0441\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \"\u042f\u0437\u044b\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\" (\u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430) |trans-title=The images of public figures of Russian history in the discourse of modern \"Pagan art\" (based on fine arts material) |url=https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/obrazy-deyateley-rossiyskoy-istorii-v-diskurse-sovremennogo-yazycheskogo-iskusstva-na-materiale-izobrazitelnogo-tvorchestva |publisher=\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440\u044b}} \u0423\u0414\u041a 298.9:7.044/.046.</ref> Rodnover rituals and festivals often include [[martial arts]] displays; these sometimes symbolise seasonal change, such as the victory of spring over winter, or can be regarded as manifestations of bravery, strength, and honesty.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=95}} Slavic-hill wrestling (\u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u043e-\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0446\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0431\u043e\u0440\u044c\u0431\u0430, ''Slavyano-goritskaya bor'ba'') was established by the Russian Rodnover Aleksandr Belov.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=69}}{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=39}} Other martial arts styles that are popular among Rodnovers are \"bench wrestling\" (''lavochki'') and \"wall against wall\" (''stenka na stenku'').{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=288}}\n\n==History==\nThe origins of Slavic Native Faith have been traced to the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement of late eighteenth and nineteenth-century Europe, which was a reaction against [[rationalism]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment]].{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=215}} This was accompanied by a growth in [[nationalism]] across Europe, as intellectuals began to assert their own national heritage.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=215}} Whereas calls to re-establish pre-Christian belief systems existed within the German and Austrian far-right nationalist movements during the early twentieth century, the same did not happen in its Russian counterpart.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=285}}\n\n[[File:O S\u0142awia\u0144szczy\u017anie przed chrze\u015bcija\u0144stwem.

The communities of Moscow and [[Obninsk]] later left the organisation for ideological differences.

By his own words: \"God's grace came upon me, and following the will of God I have proclaimed a new understanding of God\".

Classified as a [[new religious movement]], its practitioners harken back to the [[Slavic paganism|historical belief systems]] of the [[Slavs|Slavic peoples]] of [[Central and Eastern Europe]]. \"Rodnovery\" is a widely accepted self-descriptor within the community, although there are Rodnover organisations which further characterise the religion as '''[[Vedism]]''', '''[[Orthodoxy]]''', and '''[[Old Believers|Old Belief]]'''.\n\n<!--Slavic Native Faith beliefs and practices-->  \nRodnovers typically regard their religion as a faithful continuation of ancient beliefs that survived as folk religion or as conscious \"double belief\" following the [[Christianisation of the Slavs]] in the Middle Ages.{{refn|group=note|The idea that indigenous Slavic religion was preserved in a conscious \"double belief\" following the Christianisation of the Slavs is put into question by some contemporary scholars.}} Rodnovery draws upon surviving historical and archaeological sources, folk religion and also non-Slavic sources such as [[Hinduism]] (as they are believed to be coming from the same [[Proto-Indo-European mythology|Proto-Indo-European]] source). [[Slavic Native Faith's theology and cosmology|Rodnover theology and cosmology]] may be described as [[pantheism]] and [[polytheism]]\u2014worship of the supreme God of the universe and of the multiple gods, ancestors and spirits of nature identified through Slavic culture. Adherents usually meet together in groups to conduct religious ceremonies. These typically entail the invocation of gods, sacrifices and the pouring of libations, dances and a communal meal.\n\n<!--Slavic Native Faith views on morality and Slavic identity-->  \nRodnover ethical thinking emphasises the good of the collective over the rights of the individual. The religion is [[patriarchy|patriarchal]], and attitudes towards sex and gender are generally conservative.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Rodnovery has developed distinctive strains of [[Slavic Native Faith's identity and political philosophy|political and identitary philosophy]]. Rodnover organisations often characterise themselves as [[ethnic religion]]s, emphasising that the religion is bound to Slavic ethnicity. This often manifests as [[ethnic nationalism]], opposition to [[miscegenation]] and the belief in the fundamental difference of racial groups. Rodnovers often glorify Slavic history, criticising the impact of Christianity in Slavic countries and arguing that these nations will play a central role in the world's future. Rodnovers share a strong feeling that their religion represents a paradigmatic shift which will overcome [[Slavic Native Faith and mono-ideologies|the mental constraints imposed through feudalism and the continuation of what they call \"mono-ideologies\"]].\n\n<!--History of the movement--> \nThe contemporary organised Rodnovery movement arose from a multiplicity of sources and charismatic leaders just at the brink of the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] and spread rapidly by the mid-1990s and the 2000s. Antecedents are to be found in late 18th- and 19th-century Slavic [[Romanticism]], which glorified the pre-Christian beliefs of Slavic societies. Active religious practitioners devoted to establishing Slavic Native Faith appeared in Poland and Ukraine in the 1930s and 1940s. Following the [[Second World War]] and the establishment of [[communist state]]s throughout the [[Eastern Bloc]], new variants were established by Slavic emigrants living in Western countries, being later introduced in Central and Eastern European countries after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In recent times, the movement has been increasingly [[Pagan studies|studied in academic scholarship]].\n\n==Overview==\n{{See also|Slavic paganism}}\n[[File:Russian Rodnover women.jpg|thumb|Russian Rodnover women with child.]]\n\n[[Religious studies|Scholars of religion]] regard Slavic Native Faith as a [[Modern Paganism|modern Pagan]] religion.{{sfnm|1a1=Lesiv|1y=2013a|1pp=6\u20137|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=2013|2p=62|3a1=Skrylnikov|3y=2016|4a1=Shizhenskii|4a2=Aitamurto|4y=2017|4p=115}} They also characterise it as a [[new religious movement]].{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2002|1p=197|2a1=Laruelle|2y=2008|2p=284|3a1=Dost\u00e1lov\u00e1|3y=2013|3p=165|4a1=Gaidukov|4y=2013|4p=315|5a1=Shnirelman|5y=2013|5pp=62, 73}} The movement has no overarching structure,{{sfn|Gaidukov|2013|p=316}} or accepted religious authority,{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|p=120}} and contains much diversity in terms of belief and practice.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=65}} The sociologist of religion Kaarina Aitamurto suggests that Rodnovery is sufficiently heterogeneous that it could be regarded itself not as a singular religion but as \"an umbrella term that gathers together various forms of religiosity\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=65}}\n\n[[File:Szczodre Gody MIR 1.jpg|thumb|right|A Polish Rodnover outdoors altar.]]\n\nThe scholar of religion Alexey Gaidukov described \"Slavic Neopaganism\" as a term pertaining to \"all quasi-religious, political, ideological and philosophical systems which are based on the reconstruction and construction of pre-Christian Slavic traditions\".{{sfn|Gaidukov|2013|p=316}} The scholar of religion Adrian Ivakhiv describes the religion as a movement which \"harkens back to the pre-Christian beliefs and practices of ancient Slavic peoples\",{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=209}} while according to the historian and ethnologist [[Victor Schnirelmann|Victor A.

Rather, he describes the movement as having been \"built up artificially by urbanised intellectuals who use fragments of early pre-Christian local beliefs and rites in order to restore national spirituality\".{{sfn|Shnirelman|2000|p=19}} In this way, Slavic Native Faith has been understood\u2014at least in part\u2014as an [[invented tradition]],{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005c|1p=236|2a1=Laruelle|2y=2008|2p=284|3a1=Lesiv|3y=2013b|3p=136}} or a form of ''[[Folklorismus]]''.{{sfn|Radulovic|2017|p=69}} Simpson notes, studying the specific context of Poland, that unlike historical Slavic beliefs, which were integral to the everyday fabric of their society, modern Slavic Native Faith believers have to develop new forms of social organisation which set them apart from established society.{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=113}} Textual evidence for historical Slavic religion is scant, has been produced by Christian writers hostile to the systems being described and is usually open to multiple interpretations.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=89}}\n\nIn developing Slavic Native Faith, practitioners draw upon the primary sources about the historical religion of Slavic peoples, as well as elements drawn from later Slavic folklore, official and popular Christian belief and from non-Slavic societies.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=128}} Among these foreign influences have been beliefs and practices drawn from [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Germanic Heathenry]],{{sfnm|1a1=Laruelle|1y=2008|1p=289|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=2017|2p=90}} [[Siberian shamanism]],{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=32}} as well as ideas drawn from various forms of [[Western esotericism|esotericism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2017|1p=88|2a1=Radulovic|2y=2017|2p=71}} Other influences include documents like the ''[[Book of Veles]]'', which claim to be genuine accounts of historical Slavic religion but which academics recognise as later compositions.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=90}} According to the folklorist Mariya Lesiv, through this syncretic process, \"a ''new'' religion is being created on the basis of the synthesis of elements from various traditions\".{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=14}} Many Rodnovers do not acknowledge this practice of [[syncretism]] and instead profess an explicitly anti-syncretic attitude, emphasising the need to retain the \"purity\" of the religion and thus maintain its \"authenticity\".{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=141}}\n\n===Slavic folk religion and double belief===\n[[File:\u0418\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0411\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0446\u044b \u00ab\u041e\u0433\u043d\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u00bb .jpg|thumb|''The Fiery Chariot of the Word''\u201419th-century [[Russian icon]] of the ''[[Theotokos]]'' as [[Ognyena Maria]] (\"Fiery Mary\"), fire goddess sister of [[Perun]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Rou\u010dek |editor-first=Joseph Slabey |title=Ognyena Maria |encyclopedia=Slavonic Encyclopedia |year=1949 |publisher=Philosophical Library |location=New York}} p. 905</ref> Belief in a [[mother goddess]] as the receptacle of life, [[Mat Syra Zemlya]] (\"Damp Mother Earth\"), was preserved in Russian folk religion up to the 20th century, often disguised as the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] of Christianity.{{sfn|Ivanits|1989|pp=15, 16}} The fiery \"six-petaled roses\" that umbego the Ognyena are one of the variants of the whirling symbol of the supreme God (Rod) and of its sons.{{sfn|Ivanits|1989|p=17}}]]\n\nA different perspective is offered by [[Svetlana Chervonnaya]], who sees the return to folk beliefs among Slavs as part of a broader phenomenon that is happening to \"the mass religious mind\" not merely of Slavic or Eastern European peoples, but to peoples all over [[Asia]], and that expresses itself in new mythologemes endorsed by national elites.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Alybyna |first=Tatiana |year=2014 |title=Vernacular Beliefs and Official Traditional Religion |url=https://www.doria.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/134723/AR_Alybina.pdf?sequence=2 |journal=Approaching Religion |volume=4 |number=1 |pages=89\u2013100 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707181157/https://www.doria.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/134723/AR_Alybina.pdf?sequence=2 |archive-date=7 July 2017}} Cites: Chervonnaya, Svetlana (1998).

The shared underpinning is a [[pantheism|pantheistic]] view that is [[holism|holistic]] in its understanding of the universe.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=102}} Similarly to the ancient Slavic religion, a common theological stance among Rodnovers is that of [[monism]], by which the many different gods (polytheism) are seen as manifestations of the single, universal God\u2014generally identified by the concept of ''[[Rod (Slavic religion)|Rod]]'',{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=65}} also known as ''Sud'' (\"Judge\") and ''Prabog'' (\"Pre-God\", \"First God\") among [[South Slavs]].{{sfn|Mathieu-Colas|2017}} In the Russian and Ukrainian centres of Rodnover theology, the concept of Rod has been emphasised as particularly important.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}}{{sfn|Lesiv|2017|p=142}}\n\nThe root *''rod'' is attested in sources about pre-Christian religion referring to divinity and ancestrality.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}}{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=288}} Mathieu-Colas defines Rod as the \"primordial God\", but the term also literally means the generative power of family and \"kin\", \"birth\", \"origin\" and \"fate\" as well.{{sfn|Mathieu-Colas|2017}} Its negative form, ''urod'', means something wrenched, deformed, degenerated, monstrous.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=65}} Sometimes, the meaning of the word is left deliberately obscure among Rodnovers, allowing for a variety of different interpretations.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}} Cosmologically speaking, Rod is conceived as the spring of universal [[emanationism|emanation]], which articulates in a cosmic hierarchy of gods; Rod expresses itself as ''Prav'' (literally \"Right\" or \"Order\"; cf. Greek ''[[Orthotes]]'', Sanskrit ''[[\u1e5ata]]'') in primordial undeterminacy ([[chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]]), through a dual dynamism, represented by [[Belobog]] (\"White God\") and [[Chernobog]] (\"Black God\"), the forces of waxing and waning, and then giving rise to the world in its three qualities, ''[[Prav-Yav-Nav]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Rabotkina|1y=2013|1p=240|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=1998|2p=8, note 35}} [[Triglav (mythology)|Triglav]] (\"Three-Headed One\") and [[Svetovid]] (\"Worldseer\") are concepts representing the ''[[axis mundi]]'' and, respectively, the three qualities of reality and their realisation in the four dimensions of space.{{sfn|Dynda|2014|loc=''passim''}}\n\nWhen emphasising this monism, Rodnovers may define themselves as ''rodnianin'', \"believers in God\"{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=269}} (or \"in nativity\", \"in genuinity\"). Already the pioneering Ukrainian leader Shaian argued that God manifests as a variety of different deities.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=130}} This theological explanation is called \"manifestationism\" by some contemporary Rodnovers and implies the idea of a spirit\u2013matter continuum; the different gods, who proceed from the supreme God, generate differing categories of things not as their external creations (as objects), but embodying themselves as these entities. In their view, beings are the progeny of gods; even phenomena such as the thunder are conceived in this way as embodiments of these gods (in this case, [[Perun]]).{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=66}} In the wake of this theology, it is common among Slavic Native Faith practitioners to say that \"we are not God's slaves, but God's sons\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}} Some Rodnover groups espouse the idea that specific Slavic populations are the sons of peculiar facets of God; for instance, groups who rely upon the tenth-century manuscript ''The Lay of Igor's Host'' may affirm the idea that Russians are the grandchildren of [[Dazhbog]] (the \"Giving God\", \"Day God\").{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}}\n\nPantheons of deities are not unified among practitioners of Slavic Native Faith.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|pp=289\u2013290}} Different Rodnover groups often have a preference for a particular deity over others.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=290}} The Union of Russian Rodnover Communities founded and led by Vadim Kazakov recognises a pantheon of over thirty deities emanated by the supreme Rod;<ref name=\"Adversus paganos\">{{cite magazine |last1=Belov |first1=Maxim |last2=Garanov |first2=Yuri |date=10 February 2015 |title=Adversus Paganos |publisher=Journal of the Ascension Cathedral of Astrakhan |website=astrsobor.ru |url=http://astrsobor.ru/adversus-paganos-novaya-istoriya-protiv-yazychnikov/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170523191143/http://astrsobor.ru/adversus-paganos-novaya-istoriya-protiv-yazychnikov/ |archive-date=23 May 2017 |access-date=7 July 2017}}</ref> these include attested deities from Slavic pre-Christian and folk traditions, Slavicised Hindu deities (such as ''Vyshen'', i.e. [[Vishnu]], and ''Intra'', i.e. [[Indra]]), Iranian deities (such as [[Simargl]] and Khors), deities from the ''Book of Veles'' (such as Pchelich) and figures from Slavic folk tales such as the wizard [[Koschei]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=95}} Another Russian Rodnover leader, Nikolai Speransky (''[[volkhv]]'' Velimir), emphasises a [[dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] eternal struggle between forces of [[good and evil]]; the former represented by Belobog, who created the human soul, and the latter by Chernobog, who created the human body.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=93}} Rodnovers also believe and worship [[tutelary deity|tutelary deities]] of specific elements, lands and environments,{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=204}} such as waters, forests and the household.

Although some Rodnovers believe in an afterlife, ''[[Vyraj|Iriy]]'' or ''Vyriy'', they argue that retribution is not deferred to such future; since gods manifest themselves as the natural phenomena, and in people as lineage descendants, Rodnovers believe that actions and their outcomes unfold and are to be dealt with in the present world.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=188}} People are viewed as having unique responsibilities towards their own contexts: for instance, the right of parents is to take care of their children, the right of ancestors is to be honoured, and the land deserves to be recked and cultivated.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=79}} Rodnovers blame Christianity for transferring personal responsibility into a transcendent future, when actions will be judged by God and people either smitten or forgiven for their sins, in fact exempting people from responsibility. According to Rodnovers, justice and truth have to be realised in this life, so that \"[[turning the other cheek]]\", waiving agency and intervention in the things of this world, is considered immoral and equivalent to welcoming wrongness.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=96}} In other words, fleeing from the commitment towards the forces at play in the present context is the same as denying the gods; it disrupts morality, impairing the individual, society and the world itself.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=79}}\n\n[[File:Rodnover wedding in Russia.jpg|thumb|left|Rodnover wedding ceremony.]]\n\nRodnovers value individual responsibility as the cornerstone for the further maturation of humanity, equating the conversion to Rodnovery with such maturation.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=142}} This emphasis on individuality is not at odds with the value of solidarity, since collective responsibility is seen as arising from the union of the right free decisions of reflexive individuals. By using terms of [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]], Aitamurto says that what Rodnovers reject is \"egoistic individualism\", not \"moral individualism\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=116}} Immediately related to the morality of a responsible community is the respect for the natural world in general, or what Aitamurto defines \"ecological responsibility\".{{sfnm|1a1=Aitamurto|1y=2016|1p=138|2a1=Simpson|2y=2013|2p=120}}\n\nRodnover ethics deal with a wide range of contemporary social issues.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2000|p=18}} Through the categories of contemporary sociology, Rodnover views are generally defined [[conservatism|conservative]]. Aitamurto summarised these views as: patriarchy, solidarity and homogeneity, with the latter two seen as intrinsically related.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|p=4}} Shnirelman observed that Rodnovers' calls for social justice tend to apply only to their own perceived ethnic community.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}} There have been difficulties with Rodnover involvement in the wider environmentalist movement as a result of many environmentalists' unease with the racial and anti-Christian themes that are prominent in the religion.{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=121}}\n\nWithin Rodnovery, gender roles are generally conservative.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Rodnovers often subscribe to the view that men and women are fundamentally different and thus their tasks also differ.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Men are seen as innately disposed towards \"public\" life and abstract thought, while women are seen as better realising themselves in the \"private\" administration of the family and the resources of the house.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=86}} Rodnovers therefore reinforce traditional values in Slavic countries rather than being [[counterculture|countercultural]], presenting themselves as a stabilising and responsible social force. They may even view their upholding of social traditionalism as a counterculture in itself, standing in the face of [[modernism]] and [[globalism]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=161}}\n\nIdeas and practices perceived as coming from Western liberal society\u2014which Rodnovers perceive as degenerate\u2014are denounced as threats to Slavic culture; for instance, alcohol and drug consumption, various sexual behaviours and [[miscegenation]] are commonly rejected by Rodnovers, while they emphasise healthy family life in harmonious environments.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=88}} Aitamurto and Gaidukov noted that \"hardly any women\" in Russian Rodnovery would call themselves [[feminism|feminists]], partly due to Rodnover beliefs on gender and partly due to the negative associations that the word \"feminism\" has in Russian culture.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} In adopting such a conservative stance to sexual ethics, practitioners of Rodnovery can adopt [[misogyny|misogynistic]] and [[homophobia|homophobic]] attitudes.{{sfn|Dost\u00e1lov\u00e1|2013|p=178}} Aitamurto and Gaidukov noted that it would be \"difficult to imagine that any Rodnover community would accept members who are openly homosexual\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Many groups in both Russia and Ukraine critique mixed-race unions;{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2013|1pp=72\u201373|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=2017|2p=98|3a1=Lesiv|3y=2017|3p=143}} for instance, the [[Ynglist Church]]'s doctrine articulates a condemnation of race mixing as unhealthy.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=88}}\n\nThe Russian-based Circle of Pagan Tradition distinguishes itself for its more accommodating positions\u2014compared to those of other organisations\u2014about the coexistence of different lifestyles, holding that tolerance should be a key value.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=201}} They reflect their stance in the slogan \"unity in diversity\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=201}} This organisation has also placed greater emphasis on environmentalist issues over nationalist ones, and has called on its members to vote for the [[Green Russia]] party.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=202}}\n\n==Identity and political philosophy==\n{{Main|Slavic Native Faith's identity and political philosophy}}\n[[File:Slavic europe.svg|thumb|upright|Map of countries in Central and Eastern Europe where Slavic languages predominate.

[[Marija Gimbutas]], instead, found Slavic religion to be a clear result of the overlap of Indo-European patriarchism and pre-Indo-European matrifocal beliefs. [[Boris Rybakov]] emphasised the continuity and complexification of Slavic religion through the centuries.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=211}}\n\nThe scholar of religion Scott Simpson states that Slavic Native Faith is \"fundamentally concerned with questions of community and ethnic identity\",{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=118}} while folklorist Nemanja Radulovic described practitioners as placing \"great emphasis on their national or regional identity\".{{sfn|Radulovic|2017|pp=65\u201366}} Rodnovery typically displays greater concern for [[individual and group rights|collective rights than individual rights]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=63}} Most Rodnover groups will permit only Slavs as members, although there are a few exceptions.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}}\n\n===Ethnic nationalism===\n\n\nSlavic Native Faith's world-view is often [[ethnic nationalism|ethnic nationalist]] in basis.{{sfnm|1a1=Aitamurto|1y=2006|1p=195|2a1=Lesiv|2y=2013b|2p=131}} Aitamurto suggested that Russian Rodnovers' conceptions of nationalism encompass three main themes: that \"the Russian or Slavic people are a distinct group\", that they \"have\u2014or their heritage has\u2014some superior qualities\", and that \"this unique heritage or the existence of this ethnic group is now threatened, and, therefore, it is of vital importance to fight for it\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=187}}\n\nMany Rodnovers espouse socio-political views akin to those of the French ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]''.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=235}} Some blame many of the world's problems on the mixing of ethno-cultural groups,{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=229}} and emphasise the idea of ethnic purity.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=206}}{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=223}} Some Rodnovers promote [[racial segregation]],{{sfn|Shnirelman|2015|p=98}} and have demanded a prohibition on mixed-race marriages.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}} Some Rodnovers regard ethnic minorities living in Slavic countries as a cause of [[social injustice]],{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}} and encourage the removal of those regarded as \"aliens\" from Russia, namely those who are Jewish or have ethnic origins in the Caucasus,{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=190}} an approach that could require [[ethnic cleansing]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}} Other Rodnovers are openly anti-Semitic,{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005c|1p=234|2a1=Laruelle|2y=2008|2p=284}} for instance urging fellow Rodnovers not to get involved with Jews,{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=234}} and endorsing anti-Semitic conspiracy theories claiming that Jews control the economic and political elite.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=190}}\n\nMany Rodnovers oppose what they regard as \"culturally destructive\" phenomena such as [[cosmopolitanism]], [[liberalism]] and [[globalisation]],{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=223}} as well as [[Americanisation]] and [[consumerism]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=189}} The political models proposed by Rodnovers as based on their interpretation of the ancient Slavic community model of the ''[[veche]]'' (assembly), similar to the ancient Germanic \"[[thing (assembly)|thing]]\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|pp=2\u20133}} Western liberal ideas of freedom and democracy are traditionally perceived by Russian eyes as \"outer\" freedom, contrasting with Slavic \"inner\" freedom of the mind;

The meeting ends with the singing of ''[[Shche ne vmerla Ukraina]]'', the [[national anthem]] of Ukraine.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=226}} The rival and near homonymous Association of Sons and Daughters of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (OSID RUNVira), also conducts weekly Holy Hours, but incorporates a wider selection of sources\u2014such as readings from the pan-Rodnover ''Book of Veles'' or the poetry of [[Taras Shevchenko]]\u2014into the proceedings.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=228}} The structure of these Syenkoite rites is modelled on those of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=128}}\n\n[[File:Koliada 2017 near Naro-Fominsk (1).jpg|thumb|left|Rodnovers engaged in a circle-dance around a bonfire, celebrating the [[Koliada]] festival in [[Naro-Fominsk]], [[Moscow Oblast]], Russia.]]\n\nAdherents of Slavic Native Faith often adopt elements from recorded folk culture. Lesiv described this process as one of \"Paganisation\", whereby Christian or otherwise non-Pagan elements are deliberately given a new meaning and purpose.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=136}} In turn, some of these \"Paganised\" folk practices have been transmitted through the wider population, who has regarded them as authentic traditional practices.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|pp=138\u2013139}} Some Rodnover groups also incorporate non-Slavic practices.{{sfnm|1a1=Lesiv|1y=2013b|1p=128|2a1=Simpson|2y=2017|2p=81}} For instance, a group of Polish Rodnovers has been documented to use the [[fire poi]] at their Midsummer festivities, a practice that originally developed in Pacific regions during the mid-20th century.{{sfn|Simpson|2017|p=80}} The Ukrainian organisation Ancestral Fire of the Native Orthodox Faith promotes a healing technique called ''Zhyva'' that has close similarities to the Japanese practice of [[reiki]].{{sfn|Lesiv|2017|p=142}} In another instance, Lesiv observed a Ukrainian Rodnover who legitimised the practice of [[yoga]] by claiming that this spiritual tradition had originally been developed by the ancestors of modern-day Ukrainians.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=137}} Another example are groups within [[Peterburgian Vedism]] which incorporate [[Ivanovism|Ivanovite]] healing techniques.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=35}}\n\nRituals take place at secluded, consecrated spaces, and generally include the invocation of gods, sacrifices and the pouring of [[libation]]s, circle-dances (''horovod'' or simply ''kolo'', \"circle\"), and usually end with a communal meal. Some Rodnover organisations require that participants wear traditional Slavic clothes for such gatherings, although there is much freedom in interpreting what constitutes \"traditional clothes\", this definition generally referring to folkloric needlecraft open to a wide range of artistic patterns.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=70}}{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=290}}\n\nBesides the rites of outgang from Christianity (''raskrestitsia''), Rodnovers practise rituals of initiation of the new members into the community of Slavic Native Faith. Central to this conversion is the \"renaming\", that is to say the adoption of a new Slavic name, symbolising the death and rebirth of the convert into the new community. Some groups, such as male brotherhoods, practise the cutting of a second \"life line\" on the palm of the hand of converts, symbolising the new \"blood bond\" that is formed with other members.{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=292}}\n\n===Communities, citadels and temples===\n[[File:\u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044c.jpg|thumb|A building of the Slavic Kremlin Vitalya Sundakova in the [[Podolsky District]], Moscow Oblast, Russia.]]\n\nRodnover organisations have inherited ideas of commonality and social governance from Slavic and Russian history. They recover the pre-Christian social institution of the ''[[veche]]'' (assembly), which they also see as reflecting the concept of ''[[sobornost]]'' formulated in 20th-century Russian philosophy.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=191}} ''Veche'' is used as the name of many Rodnover overarching organisations, including the international \"Veche of Slavic Native Faith\", an assembly held each summer, to which adherents from Slavic countries take part. Aitamurto (2008) characterises the ''veche'' as a model of organisation \"from below and to the top\", following descriptions given by Rodnovers themselves\u2014that is to say a grassroots form of governance which matures into a consensual authority and/or decision-making. Local Rodnover groups usually call themselves ''obshchina'' (the term for traditional peasant communities), while ''skhod'', ''sobor'' and ''mir'' are used for informal meetings or to refer to traditional Russian ideas of commonality. Another term for a community, though not frequently used, is ''artel''.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|p=4}} A form of organisation of Rodnover communities consists in the establishment of places for common living, such as fortresses (''[[kremlin]]'') or citadels (''gorodok''), in which temples are umbegone by buildings for various social uses.

They are those responsible for holding rites for worshipping the gods and leading communities and religious festivals. Volkhvs are the higher rank of the sacerdotal hierarchy, while zhrets are of a lower authority.{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=272, note 11}}\n\nThough the majority of Rodnover priests are males, Rodnover groups do not exclude women from the priesthood, so that a parallel female priesthood is constituted by the two ranks of ''zhritsa'' and ''vedunya'' (\"seeresses\"). Prestige is not limited to male priests; a priestess, [[Halyna Lozko]] from Ukraine, is an acknowledged authority within the Rodnover movement.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|p=4}} In 2012, a number of Rodnover organisations in Russia made an agreement for the mutual recognition of their priesthood and for the uniformisation of ordination policies.{{sfn|Skrylnikov|2016}}\n\n===Calendars and holidays===\n{{Main|Slavic Native Faith's calendars and holidays}}\n[[File:Ukrainian Rodnovers worshipping a goddess at Vodokres holiday.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian Rodnovers worshipping a goddess' pole on Vodokre\u0161 holiday in the countryside.]]\n\nAccording to Aitamurto, rituals play \"a central role in defining, learning and transmitting the religion\", and thus they constitute an important complement to theology within Rodnovery. Ceremonial accuracy is often considered essential for the efficacy of a ritual. Nevertheless, Rodnover rituals may be regarded as flexible frameworks, wherein there is room for elaboration and experimentation. The sources that Rodnovers rely upon are valued scholars like [[Vladimir Dal]] and [[Boris Rybakov]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=67}}\n\nThe common Rodnover ritual calendar is based on the Slavic folk tradition, whose crucial events are the four [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es set in the four phases of the year.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=67}} Slavic Native Faith has been described as following \"the cycles of nature\".{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|p=109}} A festival that is believed to be the most important by many Rodnovers is that of the summer solstice, the [[Kupala Night|''Kupala'' Night]] (June 23\u201324), although also important are the winter solstice festival ''Karachun'' and ''[[Koliada]]'' (December 24\u201325), and the spring equinox festival Shrovetide\u2014called ''Komoeditsa'' or ''[[Maslenitsa]]'' (March 24). Festivals celebrated in spring include the Day of Yarilo and the ''Krasnaya Gorka'' (literally \"Red Hill\", celebrated between April 30\u2013May 1), the latter dedicated to ancestor worship; while in autumn Rodnovers celebrate the Day of [[Marzanna]] and that of Mokosh (November 10). Other festivals include the Days of Veles (multiple, in January and February) and the Day of Perun (August 2), the latter considered to be the most important holiday of the year by some Rodnover organisations.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=67}}\n\nUsually, the organisation of festivals involves three layers of society: there is a patronising \"core\" of practitioners, who are often professionally affirmed people, usually belonging to the intellectual class; then there is the population of committed adherents; and then there is a loose \"periphery\" constituted by sympathisers, generally relatives and friends of the committed followers. Aitmurto notes that festivals are usually set in the evenings, the weekends and on public holidays, in order to allow everyone's participation.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=64}} Shizhenskii and Aitamurto described one Kupala festival, held over the course of three days outside [[Maloyaroslavets]] in Russia; at this event, weddings, purification rituals, and name-giving ceremonies took place, accompanied by musical performances, martial arts, and folkloric plays, while a market sold traditional handicrafts.{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|p=120}} The interplay with the gods and the cycle of nature which they represent is displayed through large-scale ceremonies which Aitamurto defines as \"aesthetically lavish\", vectors of a great deal of creativity.

In doing so, pre-Christian belief systems underwent a rehabilitation.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|pp=285\u2013286}} Russian Native Faith originated in the [[Soviet dissidents]]' circles of the 1970s.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=185}} An intellectual circle that cultivated themes of Slavic indigenous religion formed as a wing of the predominantly Orthodox Christian [[samizdat]] nationalist journal ''Veche'' (1971\u20131974). Such group included Anatoly Ivanov, the artist [[Konstantin Vasilyev]] (1942\u20131974), and Nikolai Bogdanov, among others. Vasilyev's art is widely celebrated within the Rodnover community. Ivanov, who declared himself a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] and subscribed to \"Arism\" or \"Slavism\", published a fervently anti-Christian pamphlet entitled \"The Christian Plague\" (''Khristianskaya chuma''). Throughout the 1970s, the nationalist dissident movement split into two branches, an Orthodox Christian one and another one that developed [[National Bolshevism]], which eventually continued to harbour Pagan traditionalists.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|pp=26\u201327}} Other influential texts in this period were Valery Yemelyanov's ''Desionizatsiya'' (\"De-Sionisation\") and later Istarkhov's ''Udar russkikh bogov'' (\"The Strike of Russian Gods\").{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=186}}\n\nIn the Soviet Union, Slavic Native Faith groups had to operate in secret, although a few small groups were known to exist in Moscow and Leningrad.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=146}} These groups were closely linked to the nationalistic circles operating during the 1980s.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=146}} In Moscow, an [[occultism|occult]] circle was established by Yevgeny Golovin and Yuri Mamleyev;

Apollon Kuzmin did so in his 1988 book ''Padenie Peruna'' (\"The Fall of Perun\").{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=288}} In 1986, Viktor Bezverkhy established the Leningrad ([[Saint Petersburg]])-based Society of the Mages (''Obshchestvo Volkhvov''), an explicitly [[white supremacism|white supremacist]] and anti-Semitic organisation;

they formed the Association of Sons and Daughters of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (OSID RUNVira) and secured legal control of the temple in Spring Glen.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=227}} A second group, the Association of Sons and Daughters of Ukraine of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (OSIDU RUNVira), maintained links with Sylenko himself, whom it regards as a prophet, and adopted his ''Maha Vira'' as a sacred text.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=225}} Despite the animosity that existed between these rival Ukrainian groups, there was some collaboration between them.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=232}} In 2003, the First Forum of Rodnovers was held in the country, resulting in two public proclamations: the first urged the country's government to protect what the Rodnovers regarded as sacred sites and objects, and the second called on the government not to go ahead with the proposed privatisation of agricultural land.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=232}} That same year, a group called Ancestral Fire of the Native Orthodox Faith was established; in contrast to the anti-Russian slant taken by Sylenko, it embraced a Pan-Slavic perspective.{{sfn|Lesiv|2017|pp=139\u2013140}}\n\nThe social context of Slavic Native Faith's growth in Russia differed from that in other parts of Central and Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=161}} Russian nationalists had welcomed the collapse of the Soviet system but were disappointed with the arrival of [[capitalism]] and the dramatic economic downturn that Russia faced in that decade.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=147}} Large numbers became unemployed, and many turned to the past, including in ethnic terms.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|pp=87\u201388}} In this context, the growth of Rodnovery can be seen as a nationalistic project to regain national pride.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=161}} Many leaders of early post-Soviet Rodnovery were intellectuals that were already practising members of the movement in late Soviet times, for instance, Grigory Yakutovsky (Vseslav Svyatozar), Aleksei Dobrovolsky (Dobroslav) and Viktor Bezverkhy.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=32}} Other leaders that emerged in this period were Aleksandr Asov, publisher of numerous versions of the ''Book of Veles'', and Aleksei Belov, founder of the martial arts style known as \"Slavic-hill wrestling\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|pp=37\u201338}}\n\nRussian Rodnovers started to organise by the mid-1990s; in 1994 the Moscow Slavic Community was the first Rodnover group to be registered by the government.

The communities of Moscow and [[Obninsk]] later left the organisation for ideological differences.

Meryan Rodnovers also rely upon the uninterrupted traditions of [[Mari Native Faith]]; on 27 September 2015, they organised a joint Mari-Merya prayer in the Moscow region.

By his own words: \"God's grace came upon me, and following the will of God I have proclaimed a new understanding of God\".

{"title_page": "Kathasaritsagara", "text_new": "{{short description|Sanskrit 11th-century collection of Indian legends, fairy tales and folk tales}}\n{{italic title}}\n{{Infobox book\n| image = Folio from Kathasaritsagara.JPG\n| caption = A 16th century folio from an Indian retelling of the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara''\n}}\nThe '''''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara''''' (\"Ocean of the Streams of Stories\") is a famous 11th-century collection of Indian legends, fairy tales and folk tales as retold in [[Sanskrit]] by a [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] named [[Somadeva]].\n\n''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' contains multiple layers of [[story within a story]] and is said to have been adopted from [[Gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e0dhya]]'s ''[[Brihatkatha|B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101]]'', which was written in a poorly-understood language known as [[Pai\u015b\u0101c\u012b]]. The work is no longer extant but several later adaptations still exist \u2014 the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'', ''[[Brihatkathamanjari|B\u1e5bhatkathamanjari]]'' and ''[[B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101\u015blokasa\u1e43graha]]''. However, none of these recensions necessarily derives directly from Gunadhya, and each may have intermediate versions. Scholars compare [[Gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e0dhya]] with [[Vyasa]] and [[Valmiki]] even though he did not write the now long-lost ''[[Brihatkatha|B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101]]'' in Sanskrit. Presently available are its two Sanskrit [[recension]]s, the ''[[Brihatkathamanjari|B\u1e5bhatkathamanjari]]'' by [[Kshemendra|K\u1e63emendra]] and the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' by Somadeva.\n\n==Author and structure==\n[[File:Brhatkatha stemma.svg|thumb|upright=2.5|Probable relationship between versions of the [[Brihatkatha]]]]\n\nThe author of ''Kathasaritsagara'', or rather its compiler, was [[Somadeva]], the son of R\u0101ma, a \u015aaiva Br\u0101hman of Kashmir. He tells us that his ''magnum opus'' was written (sometime between 1063-81 CE) for the amusement of S\u016bryavat\u012b, wife of King Ananta of Kashmir, at whose court Somadeva was poet. The tragic history of Kashmir at this period - Ananta\u2019s two sons, Kala\u015ba and Har\u1e63a, the worthless degenerate life of the former, the brilliant but ruthless life of the latter, the suicide of Ananta himself, the self-immolation of S\u016bryavat\u012b on his funeral pyre, and the resulting chaos - forms as a dark and grim background for the setting of Somadeva\u2019s tales. The frame story is the narrative of the adventures of Naravahanadatta, son of the legendary king Udayana, his romances with damsels of great beauty and wars with enemies. As many as 350 tales are built around this central story, making it the largest existing collection of Indian tales.\n\nSomadeva declares that his work is a faithful though abridged translation of a much larger collection of stories known as the ''[[Brihatkatha|B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101]]'', or Great Tale written in the lost [[Paisaci]] dialect by [[Gunadhya|Gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e0dhya]]. But the Kashmirian (or \"Northwestern\") ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101'' that [[Somadeva]] adapted may be quite different from the Paisaci [[wikt:urtext|ur-text]], as at least 5 apparent descendants of Gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e0dhya's work exist \u2014 all quite different in form and content, the best-known (after the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' itself) probably being the ''[[B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101\u015blokasa\u1e43graha]]'' of [[Budhasvamin]] from [[Nepal]]. Like the ''Panchatantra'', tales from the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' (or its related versions) travelled to many parts of the world.\n\n''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' consists of 18 ''lambhakas'' (\"books\") of 124 ''taramgas'' (chapters called as \"waves\") and approximately 22,000 [[shloka|\u015bloka]]s (distichs) in addition to prose sections.<ref>Penzer 1924 Vol I, p xxxi.</ref> The \u015bloka consists of 2 half-verses of 16 syllables each. Thus, syllabically, the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' is approximately equal to 66,000 lines of iambic pentameter; by comparison, [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' weighs in at 10,565 lines. All this pales in comparison to the (presumably legendary) 700,000 \u015blokas of the lost original ''[[Brihatkatha]]''. \n\nSomadeva\u2019s narrative captivates both by its simple and clear, though very elegant, style and diction and by his skill in drawing with a few strokes pictures of types and characters taken from the real every-day life. Hence it is that even in the miraculous and fantastical facts and events that make up the bulk of the main story and of a great deal of the incidental tales the interest of the reader is uninterruptedly kept. His lively and pleasant art of story-telling \u2014 though now and then encumbered with inflatedness or vitiated by far-fetched false wit \u2014 is enhanced also by his native humor and the elegant and pointed sentences strewn about here and there with a good taste.<ref>J. S. Speyer, ''Studies about the Kathasaritsagara'' (Wiesbaden: M. Sandig, 1968)</ref>\n\n==Synopsis<ref>https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/kathasaritsagara-the-ocean-of-story/d/doc79557.html</ref>==\nThe ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' is a large work. Each book comprises a number of stories loosely strung together, by being narrated for the recreation or information of the same individuals, or arising out of their adventures. These are [[Udayana]], king of [[Kosambi]], and his son Naravahanadatta. The marriage of the latter with various damsels of terrestrial or celestial origin, and his elevation to the rank of king of the [[Vidyadhara]]s, a class of heavenly spirits, are the leading topics of most of the books; but they merely constitute the skeleton of the composition, the substance being made up of stories growing out of these circumstances, or springing from one another with an ingenuity of intricacy which is one of the great charms of all such collections.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: center;\" | ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara''\n|-\n!

One of the attendants of the god, Pushpadanta, took the liberty of listening, and he repeated them, under the seal of secrecy, to his wife, Jaya, a sort of lady\u2019s maid to the goddess. Jaya takes an opportunity of intimating to her mistress that she is acquainted with the stories narrated by Siva to the great mortification of Parvati who had flattered herself that they had been communicated to her alone. She accordingly complains to Siva of his having deceived her and he vindicates himself by discovering the truth. Parvati thereupon pronounces an imprecation upon Pushpadanta, condemning him to be born upon the earth as a man; and she sentences his friend Malyavan, who had ventured to intercede for him, to a like destination. Parvati tells the culprits that they shall resume their celestial condition when Pushpadanta, encountering a Yaksha, a follower of [[Kubera]], the god of wealth, doomed for a certain time to walk the earth, as a Pisacha or goblin, shall recollect his own former state, and shall repeat to the Pisacha the stories he overheard from Siva; and when Malyavan, falling in with the Pisacha, shall hear from him again the stories that his friend Pushpadanta had narrated. The recitation of the stories forms also the limit of the Pisacha\u2019s sojourn amongst mortals.\n\nThe two demigods, Pushpadanta and Malyavan, are born as two Brahmans, named [[Vararuchi]] and [[Gunadhya]], and their adventures as mortals constitute the subject of several tales. Some of these possess much local interest: we have in them literary anecdotes relating to celebrated works and authors, as to [[P\u0101\u1e47ini|Panini]] the grammarian; notices of historical persons and events, as of the accession of [[Chandragupta Maurya]]; and traditions of the origin of celebrated places, as of that of [[Pataliputra]]. One of the best-told stories in the whole work occurs here. Upakosha the wife of Vararuchi, becomes during the absence of her husband, the object of the addresses of the king's family priest, the commander of the guards, the prince's tutor, and her husband's banker. She makes assignations with them all: each as he arrives is quickly followed by his successor, and is secreted only to be finally exposed and punished. \n\nMalyavan, or Gunadhya, in consequence of a dispute with a rival Brahman, forgoes the use of the Sanskrit, Prakrit and Desya, or vernacular languages. He afterwards learns the Paisachi language, or that of the goblins, which enables him to receive the narrations as they are told him by the metamorphosed Yaksha or Pisacha. Gunadhya having heard the stories, extending to seven hundred thousand stanzas, wrote them with his blood, for there was no ink in the forest. He then offered the work to [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahana]], king of [[Pratishthan]], who rejected it with abhorrence, on which the author kindled a fire in the forest, and reading it aloud, to the great edification of spirits and goblins, and birds and beasts, he burned it leaf by leaf as he finished the perusal. The news of this proceeding at last reached the king, and he repented of what he had done, and repaired to Gunadhya to solicit the gift of the work. The sage consented to present the king with the hundred thousand verses that had not yet been consigned to the flames. Satavahana took it to his capital, and having received an explanation of it from two of Gunadhya's disciples, he translated it from the language of the Pisachas. \n\n===Books 2 to 5===\nThe second book (''Kathamukha'') commences that part of the original narrative which was supposedly not consumed, and records the adventures of [[Udayana]], king of Kosambi, a prince of great fame  in Sanskrit plays and poems, and his marriage with Vasavadatta, princess of [[Ujjain]]. The major sub-stories include the tales of Sridatta, Devasmita and Lohajangha. \n\nThe third book (''Lavanaka'') describes his marriage to the second wife, Padmavati, princess of [[Magadha]] and his subsequent conquests. This book is especially rich in mythological sub-stories like [[Durvasa]] and [[Kunti]], [[Urvashi]] and [[Pururavas]], [[Indra]] and [[Ahalya]], Sunda and Upasunda &c. \n\nThe fourth book (''Naravahanadattajanana'') narrates the birth of the son of Udayana, by Vasavadatta, Naravahanadatta; at the same time sons are born to the chief ministers of Udayana, and they become the companions and councilors of the young prince. The book contains the famous story of [[Jimutavahana]]. \n\nThe fifth book (''Caturdarika'') records the adventures of Saktivega who became king of the heavenly beings termed Vidyadharas, a class of spirits who reside upon the loftiest peaks of the Himalaya mountains. While a mortal, he possessed superhuman longevity and faculties including [[clairvoyance]] and [[extrasensory perception]]. Naravahanadatta, is prophecised to be a king of the Vidyadharas. \n\n=== Book 6 ===\n[[File:BK relations.svg|thumb|upright=2.5|Relationships of chief characters in the ''Brihatkatha'' (as evidenced by the derived texts ''Brihatkathashlokasamgraha'', ''Brihatkathamanjari'', and ''Kathasaritsagara'').]]\nThe main focus of the sixth book (''Madanamanchuka'') is the marriage of the young prince Naravahanadatta with Madanamanchuka the daughter of Kalingasena, a princess whose mother is a celestial nymph. Kalingasena had been enamoured of Udayana, and desires to wed him. Udayana wants to marry her; but as he has two wives already, his chief minister argues aginst it. A friend of the princess, a nymph of air, is also opposed to the match, and a variety of tales are recited on either side in support of the reasoning for and against the union. In the end, a spirit of air, in love with the princess, assumes the form of Udayana, and in this identity weds her. She reconciles without remedy, and has a daughter, Madanamanchuka who is the bride of Udayana's son. The book features the famous story of Usha and [[Aniruddha]].\n\n===Book 7 ===\nIn the next book (''Ratnaprabha'') Naravahanadatta marries Ratnaprabh\u0101 a Vidyadhari who was prophesized to be his bride; the wedding is celebrated at the palace of her father Hemaprabha, on one of the snow-crowned summits of the Himalaya. When the married couple return to Kosambi the young bride persuades her husband to throw open the doors of the inner quarters, and allow free access to his friends and associates. \u201cThe honour of women,\u201d she affirms, \u201cis protected by their own principles alone; and where these are corrupt, all precautions are vain.\u201d This arrangement not only emancipates the women from jealous restraint, but also triggers a subsequent series of tales, with the prince's companions as narrators. The stories that then ensue (for e.g. Somasvamin, Sringabhuja and Rupasikha) are about the conduct of women; some are tales of revenge. \n\n=== Books 8 and 9 ===\nThe eighth book (''Suryaprabha'') is devoted to  the adventures of a prince named Suryaprabha, who became king of the Vidyadharas. The scene of action is mostly in the [[Loka]]s beyond earth, and the [[dramatis personae]] are the [[N\u0101ga|Nagas]] or snake-gods of [[Patala]] and the Vidyadharas. This is further illustration of the mode in which Naravahanadatta may fulfil the prophecy.\n\nIn the ninth book (''Alamkaravati''), Naravahanadatta is distraught on the disappearance of his favorite bride Madanamanchuka after throwing open the doors of the inner quarters. He is consoled by the narration of a number of stories about the temporary separation and final reunion of faithful couples. They consist of a compendious recital of the adventures of [[Nala]] and [[Damayanti]]. The stories continue till the thirteenth book.\n\n=== Book 10 ===\nThe next book (''Saktiyasas''), the tenth, is important in the [[history of literature]], as it includes the whole of the ''[[Panchatantra]]''. We also have in this book a possible inspiration of another well-known story, that of King Shahryar and His Brother in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''. Two young Brahmins travelling are benighted in a forest, and take up their lodging in a tree near a lake. Early in the night a number of people come from the water, and having made preparation for an entertainment retire; a Yaksha, a genie, then comes out of the lake with his two wives, and spends the night there; when he and one of his wives are asleep, the other, seeing the youths, invites them to approach her, and to encourage them, shows them a hundred rings received from former gallants, notwithstanding her husband's precautions, who keeps her locked up in a chest at the bottom of the lake. The youths reject her advances; she wakes the genie who is going to put them to death, but the rings are produced in evidence against the unfaithful wife, and she is cast away with the loss of her nose.\n\n=== Books 11 to 13 ===\nThe eleventh book (''Vela'') is one huge story, that of Vela, a damsel married to a merchant's son focusing on their shipwreck, separation and re-union.\n\nThe twelfth book (''Sasankavati'') narrates the huge tale of Mrigankadatta, prince of Ayodhya. The narrative is similar to [[Da\u1e47\u1e0din]]'s [[Dashakumaracharita]], the Tale of the Ten Princes, in which a prince and his nine companions are separated for a season, and recount what has happened to each when they meet again. The exact stories, however, are different. This book also contains an earlier version of a popular collection of tales called the [[Vetala Panchavimshati]]: twenty-five tales of a [[Vetala]] being related to Trivikramasena, king of [[Pratishthan]], on the Godavari.\n\nThe thirteenth book (''Madiravati'') is short and recounts the adventures of two young Brahmans, who have secret marriages with a princess and her friend. The incidents are curious and diverting and similar to the contrivances by which Madhava and Makaranda obtain their mistresses in the drama entitled ''Malatimadhava'' by [[Bhavabhuti]]. \n\n{{multiple image\n| total_width = 440\n| header = Illustrations from an edition of the Kathasaritsagara, c.1590\n| image1 = Tale of the Cunning Siddhikari.jpg\n| width1      = 520\n| height1     = 640\n| caption1 = ''Tale of the Cunning Siddhikari''\n| image2 = Somaprabha and a Celestial Nymph Listening to Music.jpg\n| width2      = 640\n| height2     = 610\n| caption2 = ''Somaprabha and a Celestial Nymph Listening to Music''\n}}\n\n=== Book 14 and 15 ===\nThe two next books, the fourteenth (''Panca'') and fifteenth (''Mahabhisheka''), the scene of action is the fabulous region of the Vidyadharas. In the first, the prince Naravahanadatta, realises that  his queen Madanamanchuka was abducted by ''Manasavega'' the Vidyadhara , marries additional five women of Vidhyadhara (''Vidhyadhari'') and finally kills Manasavega to regain his queen. \n\nIn Mahabhisheka, Naravahanadatta is crowned emperor of the Vidyadhara people.\n\n=== Book 16 ===\nIn (''Suratamanjari''), the sixteenth book, Udayana, resigns his throne to Gopalaka, the brother of his wife Vasavadatta, and, accompanied by his wives and ministers, goes to Mount Kalanjana. A heavenly chariot descends, and conveys them all to heaven. Gopalaka, inconsolable for the loss of his brother-in-law, soon relinquishes his regal state of Kosambi to his younger brother, Palaka, retires to the White Mountain, and spends the rest of his days in the hermitage of [[Kashyapa]]. We have then an account of the son of Palaka falling in love with a young girl of low caste, a [[Chandala|Chandali]], and different stories illustrative of odd couples. Palaka's ministers argue that the very circumstance of the prince's being enamoured of the Chandali is a proof that she must be a princess or goddess in disguise; otherwise it were impossible that she should have attracted the affections of any noble individual. They therefore counsel the king to demand her hand from Matanga, her father . Matanga consents on condition that the [[Brahmins]] of Ujjain eat in his house. Palaka issues orders that eighteen thousand Brahmins, shall dine with the Chandala. The Brahmins are in great alarm, as this is a degradation and loss of caste, and they pray to [[Mahakala]], the form of Siva especially worshipped in Ujjain, to know what to do. He commands them in a dream to comply, as Matanga is in truth a Vidyadhara. He had conspired against the life of Naravahanadatta, in order to prevent his becoming emperor of the Vidyadharas, and had been therefore condemned by Siva to live in Ujjain with his family as Chandalas. The curse was to terminate when eighteen thousand Brahmins should eat in his house; and this being accomplished, Matanga is restored to his rank, and his daughter is judged a fit bride for the son of the king. \n\n=== Books 17 and 18 ===\nThe two last books are composed of narratives told by Naravahanadatta, when on a visit to his uncle Gopalaka at the hermitage of Kashyapa. He repeats those stories which were communicated to him when he was separated from Madanamanchuka, to console him under the anguish of separation. (''Padmavati'') is the love story of Muktaphalaketu, a prince of the Vidyadharas, and Padmavati, daughter of the king of the Gandharvas. The former is condemned by a holy person to become a man, and he is thus for a season separated from the latter. He is, after a short time, restored to his station and his wife. \n\nThe last book (''Visamasila'') has Vikramaditya or Vikramasila, son of Mahendraditya, king of Ujjain, for its hero, and describes his victories over hostile princes, and his acquirement of various princesses. These are interspersed with love adventures, some of which reiterate the calumnies against women, and with stories relating the tricks of professed cheats.\n\n==Historiography: versions and translations==\n=== Sanskrit antecedents: ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101ma\u00f1jar\u012b'' and ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101\u015blokasa\u1e43graha'' ===\n==== ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101ma\u00f1jar\u012b'' ====\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: center;\" | ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101ma\u00f1jar\u012b''\n|-\n!

K\u1e63emendra, the Sanskrit aesthete from Kashmir, had written his ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101ma\u00f1jar\u012b'', a summary of the ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101'' twenty or thirty years previously. The ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' and the ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101ma\u00f1jar\u012b'' agree in the number and the titles of the different ''lambhakas'' but, after ''lambhaka'' 5, disagree in the order of them. However, all the books of the same name in both versions overlap with each other exactly (excluding a few minor details), except for two. Book 8 (''Vela'') in K\u1e63emendra is a combination of Book 11 (''Vela'') and the beginning of Book 14 (''Panca'') in ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara''. Considering that K\u1e63emendra composed two near faithful extracts of the celebrated epics: the ''Bharatamanjari'' and the ''Ramayanamanjari'', it is more probable that it was K\u1e63emendra, and not Somadeva, who drew up the faithful reproduction of the old Paisaci poem. ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' is considered to have better charm of language, elegance of style, masterly arrangement and metrical skill.<ref>https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/kathasaritsagara-the-ocean-of-story/d/doc64287.html</ref> Also, K\u1e63emendra\u2019s collection is a third the length of the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'', the printed text amounting to a little more than 7,561 slokas. \n\nIn 1871 Professor B\u00fchler (''Indian Antiquary'', p. 302 et seq.) proved two important facts: firstly, that Somadeva and K\u1e63emendra used the same text, and secondly, that they worked entirely independently from one another. A ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101'' such as the two writers reproduced, a prose work in the Pai\u015b\u0101c\u012b dialect, existed, therefore, in Kashmir. But it was no longer the book which Gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e0dhya had composed. It was a huge compilation, incorporating not only many particular stories from heterogeneous sources, but even whole books such as the ''Pa\u00f1catantra'', the ''Vet\u0101lapa\u00f1cavi\u1e43\u015bati'' and the story of [[Nala]]. The charge of abridging, obscuring and dislocating the main narrative is valid, not against Somadeva and K\u1e63emendra, but against predecessors, whose work of amplification had been completed, so far as completion can be predicated, perhaps two or three centuries earlier.<ref>J. S. Speyer, ''Studies about the Kathasaritsagara'' (Wiesbaden: M. Sandig, 1968)</ref> \n\n==== ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101\u015blokasa\u1e43graha'' ====\nApart from the Kashmir redactions there exists a Sanskrit version of Gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e0dhya\u2019s work, bearing the title ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101\u015blokasa\u1e43graha,'' i.e. the \u201cGreat Tale: Verse Epitome.\u201d Only about six of the twenty-six l\u0101bhas are currently available. Its discoverer and editor, M. F\u00e9lix Lac\u00f4te, had published (''Essai sur Gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e0dhya et la B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101'', Paris, 1908) along with the text an elaborate discussion of all the questions of higher criticism relating to the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' and the other recensions. M. Lac\u00f4te\u2019s conclusions, which are developed with great perspicacity, may be summarised as follows.<ref>Lac\u00f4te, F\u00e9lix, ''Essai s\u00fbr Gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e0dhya et la B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101'' (Paris: Ernest Leroux, 1908)</ref> The manuscript came from Nepal, the work of a Nepalese writer, by name Budhasv\u0101min. It is dated to the eighth to the ninth century CE and is based upon the Pai\u015b\u0101ci original. It lacks many of the subsidiary tales in the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'', and thus the main narrative stands out concerned predominantly with the actual adventures of Narav\u0101hanadatta, a hero of Gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e0dhya\u2019s own invention.\n\n=== Persian adaptations: ''Bahr al-asmar'' and ''Darya-yi asmar'' ===\n''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' was translated into Persian in Kashmir during the reign of [[Zain-ul-Abidin|Zayn al-\u2018Abidin]] (r. 1418/20-1470) under the name of ''Bahr al-asmar'' (\u201cOcean of Stories\u201d). Nowadays this version is not extant; it is known solely through the evidence from other sources. A likely reference to it can be found in the ''[[Rajatarangini]]'' by \u015ar\u012bvara (fl. 1459-1505). \u015ar\u012bvara, the poet laureate at the court, refers to the commissioning of the translation of Sanskrit works into Persian and vice versa by his patron Zayn al-\u2018Abidin, among them a translation of \u201ca digest of the ''[[B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101]]''\u201d (''b\u1e5bhatkath\u0101s\u0101ra'') which may refer to the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara''.<ref>Walter Slaje,\u201cKaschmir im Mittelalter und die Quellen der Geschichtswissenschaft,\u201d ''Indo-Iranian Journal'' 48, 1 (2005): 23.</ref>\n\nAnother Persian version was commissioned in the second half of the 16th century during [[Akbar]]\u2019s reign and accomplished by a certain Mustafa Khaliqdad \u2018Abbasi also known as the translator of other works. This work was presumably carried out after 1590 following the military annexation of Kashmir.<ref>Heike Franke, \u201cAkbar\u2019s Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara: The Translator and Illustrations of an Imperial Manuscript,\u201d ''Muqarnas'' 27 (2010): 313\u2013356, 321-322.</ref> Abbasi named it ''Darya-yi asmar'' (\u201cRiver of Stories\u201d) to distinguish it from the Kashmirian translation. In its preface, \u02bfAbbasi mentions that he was assigned to rewrite an earlier version \u201cof the book ''barhatkata'' [\u2026] which the Kashmirian Brahmin Sumdevbat [\u2026] had shortened\u201d and which \u201csomeone had undertaken during Zayn al-\u2018Abidin\u2019s reign\u201d, being fraught with Arabic expressions, in a more readable style.\u201d In conformity with the Sanskrit text, the Persian adaptation is likewise divided into eighteen main chapters, called ''nahr'' (rivers), each subdivided into several ''mauj'' (waves).<ref>Khaliqdad \u2018Abbasi, Mustafa, ''Darya-yi asmar tarjuma-yi katasaritsagar'', ed. Tara Chand, Sayyid Amir Hasan \u2018Abidi (New Delhi: Aligarh Muslim University and Markaz-i tahqiqat-i farsi, Rayzan-i farhangi-yi sifarat-i jumhuri-yi islami-yi Iran, 1997).</ref> This translation was discovered around 1968-9 (National Museum, New Delhi no. 62.1005). It was edited by Dr. Tara Chand and Prof. Syed Amir Hasan Abidi. It is worth mentioning that today only two manuscripts of the Persian version are available; both are incomplete and contain only 8 out of the original 18 chapters of the Sanskrit version each, which Chand and \u2018Abidi based their edition upon.<ref>The Manuscripts are stored in the State Central Library of Hyderabad and the India Office Collection, London. See Khaliqdad \u2018Abbasi, ''Darya-yi asmar tarjuma-yi katasaritsagar'', Introduction, 8.</ref> \n\nIn contrast to other examples from similar kind of literature like Abu al-Ma\u02bfali Nasrullah Munshi\u2019s ''Kalila va Dimna'', the ''Darya-yi asmar'' was retold not in artificial prose (''nasr-i musajja\u2018'') aimed at connoisseurs but rather in simple prose with features that remind of an oral recital. In the Persian narrative we encounter a mix of adaptation techniques: some sections display a transfer close to the Indian version, whereas most parts indicate a more narrative approach. This means that special attention was given to the transmission of the narrated story and not to the preservation of as many textual features as possible. One of the adaptation techniques applied in the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' is the use of explanations and glosses to single words that refer to persons, objects or concepts. The translator-compiler \u2018Abb\u0101s\u012b remarks, for example, that \u201cthis story is elaborated upon in [other] Indian books\u201d, or comments on certain passages by adding: \u201c[\u2026] according to the sayings of the people of India [\u2026].\u201d The second type of strategy encountered is that of inserting poetic quotations from the pool of Persian poetry such as ''[[Gulistan (book)|Gulistan]]'', ''[[Hafez|Divan-i Hafiz]]'', ''Divan-i Salman-i Savaji'', ''Manzumat-i Sharaf al-Din Yazdi'', [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]]\u2019s ''Khusrau-u-Shirin'', ''Makhzan al-asrar'', ''Haft paykar'', and various others.<ref>Anna Martin, \u201c\u2018Translator\u2019s Invisibility\u2019: Strategies of Adaptation in Persian Versions of Indian Tales from the Mughal Period,\u201d ''Iran Namag'', Volume 2, Number 2 (Summer 2017), XXIV-XXXVII.</ref>\n\n=== Printed editions and modern translations ===\nProfessor H. H. Wilson was the first European scholar who drew the attention of the Western world to this storehouse of fables. In 1824, he gave a summary of the first five books in the ''Oriental Quarterly Magazine''. The first edition of the work was undertaken by Professor Brockhaus. In 1839 he issued the first five chapters only, and it was not till 1862 that the remaining thirteen appeared. Both publications formed part of the ''Abhandlungen der Deutschen Morgenl\u00e4ndischen Gesellschaft''.\n\nIt was this text which C. H. Tawney used for his excellent translation (''Ocean of the River of Streams'') published by the Asiatic Society of Bengal in the ''Bibliotheca Indica'', 1880-1884 (the index not appearing till 1887). Brockhaus\u2019 edition was based primarily on six MSS., though in the second part of the work he apparently had not so many at his disposal. Tawney was not satisfied with several of Brockhaus\u2019 readings, and consequently made numerous fresh renderings or suggestions largely taken from MSS. borrowed from the Calcutta College and from three India Office MSS. lent him by Dr Rost.\n\nIn 1889 Durg\u0101pras\u0101d issued the Bombay edition, printed at the Nir\u1e47ayas\u0101gara Press, which was produced from Brockhaus\u2019 edition and two Bombay MSS. This is the latest text now available.\n\nIn 1919, N. M. Penzer first approached Tawney with the suggestion of reissuing his ''Ocean of the River of Streams''. But he revised and published Tawney\u2019s 2 volumes in 10 volumes in 1924. The first volume gave an introduction of Hindu fiction and the other famous story-collections like ''Panchatantra'', ''Hitopadesha'' etc. Volumes 2 to 10 published the original translation with extensive comments. Penzer invited different scholars to write forewords to each volume resulting in nine excellent essays dealing with all aspects of the great collection.\n\nA project to translate the full work into modern English prose, translated by Sir James Mallinson, began to appear in 2007 from the Clay Sanskrit Library, published by New York University Press. The translation was based on the Nirnaya Press\u2019s 1915 edition of the Sanskrit text, the edition favored by Sanskritists today. Currently available are 2 volumes of the projected 7-volume edition.\n\n==== Printed editions ====\n\n* {{citation | year=1889 | title = The Kath\u00e2sarits\u00e2gara of Somadevabhatta | editor1=Pandit Durg\u0101pras\u0101da | editor2=K\u0101\u015b\u012bn\u0101tha P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dura\u1e45ga Paraba | publisher=The Nirnaya-S\u00e2gara Press | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OKlDAAAAYAAJ}}\n* {{citation | year=1915 | title = The Kath\u00e2sarits\u00e2gara of Somadevabhatta | editor1=Pandit Durg\u0101pras\u0101da | editor2=K\u0101\u015b\u012bn\u0101tha P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dura\u1e45ga Paraba | publisher=The Nirnaya-S\u00e2gara Press | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OKlDAAAAYAAJ|last=|first=|volume=|pages=|edition=3rd|editor3-last=Wasudev Laxman Shastri Pansikar}}\n\n==== Translations ====\n\n*[[Charles Henry Tawney|C.

The work is no longer extant but several later adaptations still exist \u2014 the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'', ''[[Brihatkathamanjari|B\u1e5bhatkathamanjari]]'' and ''[[B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101\u015blokasa\u1e43graha]]''. However, none of these recensions necessarily derives directly from Gunadhya, and each may have intermediate versions. Scholars compare [[Gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e0dhya]] with [[Vyasa]] and [[Valmiki]] even though he did not write the now long-lost ''[[Brihatkatha|B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101]]'' in Sanskrit. Presently available are its two Sanskrit [[recension]]s, the ''[[Brihatkathamanjari|B\u1e5bhatkathamanjari]]'' by [[Kshemendra|K\u1e63emendra]] and the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' by Somadeva.\n\n==Author and structure==\n[[File:Brhatkatha stemma.svg|thumb|upright=2.5|Probable relationship between versions of the [[Brihatkatha]]]]\n\nThe author of ''Kathasaritsagara'', or rather its compiler, was [[Somadeva]], the son of R\u0101ma, a \u015aaiva Br\u0101hman of Kashmir. He tells us that his ''magnum opus'' was written (sometime between 1063-81 CE) for the amusement of S\u016bryavat\u012b, wife of King Ananta of Kashmir, at whose court Somadeva was poet. The tragic history of Kashmir at this period - Ananta\u2019s two sons, Kala\u015ba and Har\u1e63a, the worthless degenerate life of the former, the brilliant but ruthless life of the latter, the suicide of Ananta himself, the self-immolation of S\u016bryavat\u012b on his funeral pyre, and the resulting chaos - forms as a dark and grim background for the setting of Somadeva\u2019s tales. The frame story is the narrative of the adventures of Naravahanadatta, son of the legendary king Udayana, his romances with damsels of great beauty and wars with enemies. As many as 350 tales are built around this central story, making it the largest existing collection of Indian tales.\n\nSomadeva declares that his work is a faithful though abridged translation of a much larger collection of stories known as the ''[[Brihatkatha|B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101]]'', or Great Tale written in the lost [[Paisaci]] dialect by [[Gunadhya|Gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e0dhya]]. But the Kashmirian (or \"Northwestern\") ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101'' that [[Somadeva]] adapted may be quite different from the Paisaci [[wikt:urtext|ur-text]], as at least 5 apparent descendants of Gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e0dhya's work exist \u2014 all quite different in form and content, the best-known (after the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' itself) probably being the ''[[B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101\u015blokasa\u1e43graha]]'' of [[Budhasvamin]] from [[Nepal]]. Like the ''Panchatantra'', tales from the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' (or its related versions) travelled to many parts of the world.\n\n''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' consists of 18 ''lambhakas'' (\"books\") of 124 ''taramgas'' (chapters called as \"waves\") and approximately 22,000 [[shloka|\u015bloka]]s (distichs) in addition to prose sections.<ref>Penzer 1924 Vol I, p xxxi.</ref> The \u015bloka consists of 2 half-verses of 16 syllables each. Thus, syllabically, the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' is approximately equal to 66,000 lines of iambic pentameter; by comparison, [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' weighs in at 10,565 lines. All this pales in comparison to the (presumably legendary) 700,000 \u015blokas of the lost original ''[[Brihatkatha]]''. \n\nSomadeva\u2019s narrative captivates both by its simple and clear, though very elegant, style and diction and by his skill in drawing with a few strokes pictures of types and characters taken from the real every-day life. Hence it is that even in the miraculous and fantastical facts and events that make up the bulk of the main story and of a great deal of the incidental tales the interest of the reader is uninterruptedly kept. His lively and pleasant art of story-telling \u2014 though now and then encumbered with inflatedness or vitiated by far-fetched false wit \u2014 is enhanced also by his native humor and the elegant and pointed sentences strewn about here and there with a good taste.<ref>J. S. Speyer, ''Studies about the Kathasaritsagara'' (Wiesbaden: M. Sandig, 1968)</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==<ref>https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/kathasaritsagara-the-ocean-of-story/d/doc79557.html</ref>\nThe ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' is a large work. Each book comprises a number of stories loosely strung together, by being narrated for the recreation or information of the same individuals, or arising out of their adventures. These are [[Udayana]], king of [[Kosambi]], and his son Naravahanadatta. The marriage of the latter with various damsels of terrestrial or celestial origin, and his elevation to the rank of king of the [[Vidyadhara]]s, a class of heavenly spirits, are the leading topics of most of the books; but they merely constitute the skeleton of the composition, the substance being made up of stories growing out of these circumstances, or springing from one another with an ingenuity of intricacy which is one of the great charms of all such collections.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: center;\" | ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara''\n|-\n!

One of the attendants of the god, Pushpadanta, took the liberty of listening, and he repeated them, under the seal of secrecy, to his wife, Jaya, a sort of lady\u2019s maid to the goddess. Jaya takes an opportunity of intimating to her mistress that she is acquainted with the stories narrated by Siva to the great mortification of Parvati who had flattered herself that they had been communicated to her alone. She accordingly complains to Siva of his having deceived her and he vindicates himself by discovering the truth. Parvati thereupon pronounces an imprecation upon Pushpadanta, condemning him to be born upon the earth as a man; and she sentences his friend Malyavan, who had ventured to intercede for him, to a like destination. Parvati tells the culprits that they shall resume their celestial condition when Pushpadanta, encountering a Yaksha, a follower of [[Kubera]], the god of wealth, doomed for a certain time to walk the earth, as a Pisacha or goblin, shall recollect his own former state, and shall repeat to the Pisacha the stories he overheard from Siva; and when Malyavan, falling in with the Pisacha, shall hear from him again the stories that his friend Pushpadanta had narrated. The recitation of the stories forms also the limit of the Pisacha\u2019s sojourn amongst mortals.\n\nThe two demigods, Pushpadanta and Malyavan, are born as two Brahmans, named [[Vararuchi]] and [[Gunadhya]], and their adventures as mortals constitute the subject of several tales. Some of these possess much local interest: we have in them literary anecdotes relating to celebrated works and authors, as to [[P\u0101\u1e47ini|Panini]] the grammarian; notices of historical persons and events, as of the accession of [[Chandragupta Maurya]]; and traditions of the origin of celebrated places, as of that of [[Pataliputra]]. One of the best-told stories in the whole work occurs here. Upakosha the wife of Vararuchi, becomes during the absence of her husband, the object of the addresses of the king's family priest, the commander of the guards, the prince's tutor, and her husband's banker. She makes assignations with them all: each as he arrives is quickly followed by his successor, and is secreted only to be finally exposed and punished. \n\nMalyavan, or Gunadhya, in consequence of a dispute with a rival Brahman, forgoes the use of the Sanskrit, Prakrit and Desya, or vernacular languages. He afterwards learns the Paisachi language, or that of the goblins, which enables him to receive the narrations as they are told him by the metamorphosed Yaksha or Pisacha. Gunadhya having heard the stories, extending to seven hundred thousand stanzas, wrote them with his blood, for there was no ink in the forest. He then offered the work to [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahana]], king of [[Pratishthan]], who rejected it with abhorrence, on which the author kindled a fire in the forest, and reading it aloud, to the great edification of spirits and goblins, and birds and beasts, he burned it leaf by leaf as he finished the perusal. The news of this proceeding at last reached the king, and he repented of what he had done, and repaired to Gunadhya to solicit the gift of the work. The sage consented to present the king with the hundred thousand verses that had not yet been consigned to the flames. Satavahana took it to his capital, and having received an explanation of it from two of Gunadhya's disciples, he translated it from the language of the Pisachas. \n\n===Books 2 to 5===\nThe second book (''Kathamukha'') commences that part of the original narrative which was supposedly not consumed, and records the adventures of [[Udayana]], king of Kosambi, a prince of great fame  in Sanskrit plays and poems, and his marriage with Vasavadatta, princess of [[Ujjain]]. The major sub-stories include the tales of Sridatta, Devasmita and Lohajangha. \n\nThe third book (''Lavanaka'') describes his marriage to the second wife, Padmavati, princess of [[Magadha]] and his subsequent conquests. This book is especially rich in mythological sub-stories like [[Durvasa]] and [[Kunti]], [[Urvashi]] and [[Pururavas]], [[Indra]] and [[Ahalya]], Sunda and Upasunda &c. \n\nThe fourth book (''Naravahanadattajanana'') narrates the birth of the son of Udayana, by Vasavadatta, Naravahanadatta; at the same time sons are born to the chief ministers of Udayana, and they become the companions and councilors of the young prince. The book contains the famous story of [[Jimutavahana]]. \n\nThe fifth book (''Caturdarika'') records the adventures of Saktivega who became king of the heavenly beings termed Vidyadharas, a class of spirits who reside upon the loftiest peaks of the Himalaya mountains. While a mortal, he possessed superhuman longevity and faculties including [[clairvoyance]] and [[extrasensory perception]]. Naravahanadatta, is prophecised to be a king of the Vidyadharas. \n\n=== Book 6 ===\n[[File:BK relations.svg|thumb|upright=2.5|Relationships of chief characters in the ''Brihatkatha'' (as evidenced by the derived texts ''Brihatkathashlokasamgraha'', ''Brihatkathamanjari'', and ''Kathasaritsagara'').]]\nThe main focus of the sixth book (''Madanamanchuka'') is the marriage of the young prince Naravahanadatta with Madanamanchuka the daughter of Kalingasena, a princess whose mother is a celestial nymph. Kalingasena had been enamoured of Udayana, and desires to wed him. Udayana wants to marry her; but as he has two wives already, his chief minister argues aginst it. A friend of the princess, a nymph of air, is also opposed to the match, and a variety of tales are recited on either side in support of the reasoning for and against the union. In the end, a spirit of air, in love with the princess, assumes the form of Udayana, and in this identity weds her. She reconciles without remedy, and has a daughter, Madanamanchuka who is the bride of Udayana's son. The book features the famous story of Usha and [[Aniruddha]].\n\n===Book 7 ===\nIn the next book (''Ratnaprabha'') Naravahanadatta marries Ratnaprabh\u0101 a Vidyadhari who was prophesized to be his bride; the wedding is celebrated at the palace of her father Hemaprabha, on one of the snow-crowned summits of the Himalaya. When the married couple return to Kosambi the young bride persuades her husband to throw open the doors of the inner quarters, and allow free access to his friends and associates. \u201cThe honour of women,\u201d she affirms, \u201cis protected by their own principles alone; and where these are corrupt, all precautions are vain.\u201d This arrangement not only emancipates the women from jealous restraint, but also triggers a subsequent series of tales, with the prince's companions as narrators. The stories that then ensue (for e.g. Somasvamin, Sringabhuja and Rupasikha) are about the conduct of women; some are tales of revenge. \n\n=== Books 8 and 9 ===\nThe eighth book (''Suryaprabha'') is devoted to  the adventures of a prince named Suryaprabha, who became king of the Vidyadharas. The scene of action is mostly in the [[Loka]]s beyond earth, and the [[dramatis personae]] are the [[N\u0101ga|Nagas]] or snake-gods of [[Patala]] and the Vidyadharas. This is further illustration of the mode in which Naravahanadatta may fulfil the prophecy.\n\nIn the ninth book (''Alamkaravati''), Naravahanadatta is distraught on the disappearance of his favorite bride Madanamanchuka after throwing open the doors of the inner quarters. He is consoled by the narration of a number of stories about the temporary separation and final reunion of faithful couples. They consist of a compendious recital of the adventures of [[Nala]] and [[Damayanti]]. The stories continue till the thirteenth book.\n\n=== Book 10 ===\nThe next book (''Saktiyasas''), the tenth, is important in the [[history of literature]], as it includes the whole of the ''[[Panchatantra]]''. We also have in this book a possible inspiration of another well-known story, that of King Shahryar and His Brother in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''. Two young Brahmins travelling are benighted in a forest, and take up their lodging in a tree near a lake. Early in the night a number of people come from the water, and having made preparation for an entertainment retire; a Yaksha, a genie, then comes out of the lake with his two wives, and spends the night there; when he and one of his wives are asleep, the other, seeing the youths, invites them to approach her, and to encourage them, shows them a hundred rings received from former gallants, notwithstanding her husband's precautions, who keeps her locked up in a chest at the bottom of the lake. The youths reject her advances; she wakes the genie who is going to put them to death, but the rings are produced in evidence against the unfaithful wife, and she is cast away with the loss of her nose.\n\n=== Books 11 to 13 ===\nThe eleventh book (''Vela'') is one huge story, that of Vela, a damsel married to a merchant's son focusing on their shipwreck, separation and re-union.\n\nThe twelfth book (''Sasankavati'') narrates the huge tale of Mrigankadatta, prince of Ayodhya. The narrative is similar to [[Da\u1e47\u1e0din]]'s [[Dashakumaracharita]], the Tale of the Ten Princes, in which a prince and his nine companions are separated for a season, and recount what has happened to each when they meet again. The exact stories, however, are different. This book also contains an earlier version of a popular collection of tales called the [[Vetala Panchavimshati]]: twenty-five tales of a [[Vetala]] being related to Trivikramasena, king of [[Pratishthan]], on the Godavari.\n\nThe thirteenth book (''Madiravati'') is short and recounts the adventures of two young Brahmans, who have secret marriages with a princess and her friend. The incidents are curious and diverting and similar to the contrivances by which Madhava and Makaranda obtain their mistresses in the drama entitled ''Malatimadhava'' by [[Bhavabhuti]]. \n\n{{multiple image\n| total_width = 440\n| header = Illustrations from an edition of the Kathasaritsagara, c.1590\n| image1 = Tale of the Cunning Siddhikari.jpg\n| width1      = 520\n| height1     = 640\n| caption1 = ''Tale of the Cunning Siddhikari''\n| image2 = Somaprabha and a Celestial Nymph Listening to Music.jpg\n| width2      = 640\n| height2     = 610\n| caption2 = ''Somaprabha and a Celestial Nymph Listening to Music''\n}}\n\n=== Book 14 and 15 ===\nThe two next books, the fourteenth (''Panca'') and fifteenth (''Mahabhisheka''), the scene of action is the fabulous region of the Vidyadharas. In the first, the prince Naravahanadatta, realises that  his queen Madanamanchuka was abducted by ''Manasavega'' the Vidyadhara , marries additional five women of Vidhyadhara (''Vidhyadhari'') and finally kills Manasavega to regain his queen. \n\nIn Mahabhisheka, Naravahanadatta is crowned emperor of the Vidyadhara people.\n\n=== Book 16 ===\nIn (''Suratamanjari''), the sixteenth book, Udayana, resigns his throne to Gopalaka, the brother of his wife Vasavadatta, and, accompanied by his wives and ministers, goes to Mount Kalanjana. A heavenly chariot descends, and conveys them all to heaven. Gopalaka, inconsolable for the loss of his brother-in-law, soon relinquishes his regal state of Kosambi to his younger brother, Palaka, retires to the White Mountain, and spends the rest of his days in the hermitage of [[Kashyapa]]. We have then an account of the son of Palaka falling in love with a young girl of low caste, a [[Chandala|Chandali]], and different stories illustrative of odd couples. Palaka's ministers argue that the very circumstance of the prince's being enamoured of the Chandali is a proof that she must be a princess or goddess in disguise; otherwise it were impossible that she should have attracted the affections of any noble individual. They therefore counsel the king to demand her hand from Matanga, her father . Matanga consents on condition that the [[Brahmins]] of Ujjain eat in his house. Palaka issues orders that eighteen thousand Brahmins, shall dine with the Chandala. The Brahmins are in great alarm, as this is a degradation and loss of caste, and they pray to [[Mahakala]], the form of Siva especially worshipped in Ujjain, to know what to do. He commands them in a dream to comply, as Matanga is in truth a Vidyadhara. He had conspired against the life of Naravahanadatta, in order to prevent his becoming emperor of the Vidyadharas, and had been therefore condemned by Siva to live in Ujjain with his family as Chandalas. The curse was to terminate when eighteen thousand Brahmins should eat in his house; and this being accomplished, Matanga is restored to his rank, and his daughter is judged a fit bride for the son of the king. \n\n=== Books 17 and 18 ===\nThe two last books are composed of narratives told by Naravahanadatta, when on a visit to his uncle Gopalaka at the hermitage of Kashyapa. He repeats those stories which were communicated to him when he was separated from Madanamanchuka, to console him under the anguish of separation. (''Padmavati'') is the love story of Muktaphalaketu, a prince of the Vidyadharas, and Padmavati, daughter of the king of the Gandharvas. The former is condemned by a holy person to become a man, and he is thus for a season separated from the latter. He is, after a short time, restored to his station and his wife. \n\nThe last book (''Visamasila'') has Vikramaditya or Vikramasila, son of Mahendraditya, king of Ujjain, for its hero, and describes his victories over hostile princes, and his acquirement of various princesses. These are interspersed with love adventures, some of which reiterate the calumnies against women, and with stories relating the tricks of professed cheats.\n\n==Historiography: versions and translations==\n=== Sanskrit antecedents: ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101ma\u00f1jar\u012b'' and ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101\u015blokasa\u1e43graha'' ===\n==== ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101ma\u00f1jar\u012b'' ====\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: center;\" | ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101ma\u00f1jar\u012b''\n|-\n!

K\u1e63emendra, the Sanskrit aesthete from Kashmir, had written his ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101ma\u00f1jar\u012b'', a summary of the ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101'' twenty or thirty years previously. The ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' and the ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101ma\u00f1jar\u012b'' agree in the number and the titles of the different ''lambhakas'' but, after ''lambhaka'' 5, disagree in the order of them. However, all the books of the same name in both versions overlap with each other exactly (excluding a few minor details), except for two. Book 8 (''Vela'') in K\u1e63emendra is a combination of Book 11 (''Vela'') and the beginning of Book 14 (''Panca'') in ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara''. Considering that K\u1e63emendra composed two near faithful extracts of the celebrated epics: the ''Bharatamanjari'' and the ''Ramayanamanjari'', it is more probable that it was K\u1e63emendra, and not Somadeva, who drew up the faithful reproduction of the old Paisaci poem. ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' is considered to have better charm of language, elegance of style, masterly arrangement and metrical skill.<ref>https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/kathasaritsagara-the-ocean-of-story/d/doc64287.html</ref> Also, K\u1e63emendra\u2019s collection is a third the length of the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'', the printed text amounting to a little more than 7,561 slokas. \n\nIn 1871 Professor B\u00fchler (''Indian Antiquary'', p. 302 et seq.) proved two important facts: firstly, that Somadeva and K\u1e63emendra used the same text, and secondly, that they worked entirely independently from one another. A ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101'' such as the two writers reproduced, a prose work in the Pai\u015b\u0101c\u012b dialect, existed, therefore, in Kashmir. But it was no longer the book which Gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e0dhya had composed. It was a huge compilation, incorporating not only many particular stories from heterogeneous sources, but even whole books such as the ''Pa\u00f1catantra'', the ''Vet\u0101lapa\u00f1cavi\u1e43\u015bati'' and the story of [[Nala]]. The charge of abridging, obscuring and dislocating the main narrative is valid, not against Somadeva and K\u1e63emendra, but against predecessors, whose work of amplification had been completed, so far as completion can be predicated, perhaps two or three centuries earlier.<ref>J. S. Speyer, ''Studies about the Kathasaritsagara'' (Wiesbaden: M. Sandig, 1968)</ref> \n\n==== ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101\u015blokasa\u1e43graha'' ====\nApart from the Kashmir redactions there exists a Sanskrit version of Gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e0dhya\u2019s work, bearing the title ''B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101\u015blokasa\u1e43graha,'' i.e. the \u201cGreat Tale: Verse Epitome.\u201d Only about six of the twenty-six l\u0101bhas are currently available. Its discoverer and editor, M. F\u00e9lix Lac\u00f4te, had published (''Essai sur Gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e0dhya et la B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101'', Paris, 1908) along with the text an elaborate discussion of all the questions of higher criticism relating to the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' and the other recensions. M. Lac\u00f4te\u2019s conclusions, which are developed with great perspicacity, may be summarised as follows.<ref>Lac\u00f4te, F\u00e9lix, ''Essai s\u00fbr Gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e0dhya et la B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101'' (Paris: Ernest Leroux, 1908)</ref> The manuscript came from Nepal, the work of a Nepalese writer, by name Budhasv\u0101min. It is dated to the eighth to the ninth century CE and is based upon the Pai\u015b\u0101ci original. It lacks many of the subsidiary tales in the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'', and thus the main narrative stands out concerned predominantly with the actual adventures of Narav\u0101hanadatta, a hero of Gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e0dhya\u2019s own invention.\n\n=== Persian adaptations: ''Bahr al-asmar'' and ''Darya-yi asmar'' ===\n''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' was translated into Persian in Kashmir during the reign of [[Zain-ul-Abidin|Zayn al-\u2018Abidin]] (r. 1418/20-1470) under the name of ''Bahr al-asmar'' (\u201cOcean of Stories\u201d). Nowadays this version is not extant; it is known solely through the evidence from other sources. A likely reference to it can be found in the ''[[Rajatarangini]]'' by \u015ar\u012bvara (fl. 1459-1505). \u015ar\u012bvara, the poet laureate at the court, refers to the commissioning of the translation of Sanskrit works into Persian and vice versa by his patron Zayn al-\u2018Abidin, among them a translation of \u201ca digest of the ''[[B\u1e5bhatkath\u0101]]''\u201d (''b\u1e5bhatkath\u0101s\u0101ra'') which may refer to the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara''.<ref>Walter Slaje,\u201cKaschmir im Mittelalter und die Quellen der Geschichtswissenschaft,\u201d ''Indo-Iranian Journal'' 48, 1 (2005): 23.</ref>\n\nAnother Persian version was commissioned in the second half of the 16th century during [[Akbar]]\u2019s reign and accomplished by a certain Mustafa Khaliqdad \u2018Abbasi also known as the translator of other works. This work was presumably carried out after 1590 following the military annexation of Kashmir.<ref>Heike Franke, \u201cAkbar\u2019s Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara: The Translator and Illustrations of an Imperial Manuscript,\u201d ''Muqarnas'' 27 (2010): 313\u2013356, 321-322.</ref> Abbasi named it ''Darya-yi asmar'' (\u201cRiver of Stories\u201d) to distinguish it from the Kashmirian translation. In its preface, \u02bfAbbasi mentions that he was assigned to rewrite an earlier version \u201cof the book ''barhatkata'' [\u2026] which the Kashmirian Brahmin Sumdevbat [\u2026] had shortened\u201d and which \u201csomeone had undertaken during Zayn al-\u2018Abidin\u2019s reign\u201d, being fraught with Arabic expressions, in a more readable style.\u201d In conformity with the Sanskrit text, the Persian adaptation is likewise divided into eighteen main chapters, called ''nahr'' (rivers), each subdivided into several ''mauj'' (waves).<ref>Khaliqdad \u2018Abbasi, Mustafa, ''Darya-yi asmar tarjuma-yi katasaritsagar'', ed. Tara Chand, Sayyid Amir Hasan \u2018Abidi (New Delhi: Aligarh Muslim University and Markaz-i tahqiqat-i farsi, Rayzan-i farhangi-yi sifarat-i jumhuri-yi islami-yi Iran, 1997).</ref> This translation was discovered around 1968-9 (National Museum, New Delhi no. 62.1005). It was edited by Dr. Tara Chand and Prof. Syed Amir Hasan Abidi. It is worth mentioning that today only two manuscripts of the Persian version are available; both are incomplete and contain only 8 out of the original 18 chapters of the Sanskrit version each, which Chand and \u2018Abidi based their edition upon.<ref>The Manuscripts are stored in the State Central Library of Hyderabad and the India Office Collection, London. See Khaliqdad \u2018Abbasi, ''Darya-yi asmar tarjuma-yi katasaritsagar'', Introduction, 8.</ref> \n\nIn contrast to other examples from similar kind of literature like Abu al-Ma\u02bfali Nasrullah Munshi\u2019s ''Kalila va Dimna'', the ''Darya-yi asmar'' was retold not in artificial prose (''nasr-i musajja\u2018'') aimed at connoisseurs but rather in simple prose with features that remind of an oral recital. In the Persian narrative we encounter a mix of adaptation techniques: some sections display a transfer close to the Indian version, whereas most parts indicate a more narrative approach. This means that special attention was given to the transmission of the narrated story and not to the preservation of as many textual features as possible. One of the adaptation techniques applied in the ''Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara'' is the use of explanations and glosses to single words that refer to persons, objects or concepts. The translator-compiler \u2018Abb\u0101s\u012b remarks, for example, that \u201cthis story is elaborated upon in [other] Indian books\u201d, or comments on certain passages by adding: \u201c[\u2026] according to the sayings of the people of India [\u2026].\u201d The second type of strategy encountered is that of inserting poetic quotations from the pool of Persian poetry such as ''[[Gulistan (book)|Gulistan]]'', ''[[Hafez|Divan-i Hafiz]]'', ''Divan-i Salman-i Savaji'', ''Manzumat-i Sharaf al-Din Yazdi'', [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]]\u2019s ''Khusrau-u-Shirin'', ''Makhzan al-asrar'', ''Haft paykar'', and various others.<ref>Anna Martin, \u201c\u2018Translator\u2019s Invisibility\u2019: Strategies of Adaptation in Persian Versions of Indian Tales from the Mughal Period,\u201d ''Iran Namag'', Volume 2, Number 2 (Summer 2017), XXIV-XXXVII.</ref>\n\n=== Printed editions and modern translations ===\nProfessor H. H. Wilson was the first European scholar who drew the attention of the Western world to this storehouse of fables. In 1824, he gave a summary of the first five books in the ''Oriental Quarterly Magazine''. The first edition of the work was undertaken by Professor Brockhaus. In 1839 he issued the first five chapters only, and it was not till 1862 that the remaining thirteen appeared. Both publications formed part of the ''Abhandlungen der Deutschen Morgenl\u00e4ndischen Gesellschaft''.\n\nIt was this text which C. H. Tawney used for his excellent translation (''Ocean of the River of Streams'') published by the Asiatic Society of Bengal in the ''Bibliotheca Indica'', 1880-1884 (the index not appearing till 1887). Brockhaus\u2019 edition was based primarily on six MSS., though in the second part of the work he apparently had not so many at his disposal. Tawney was not satisfied with several of Brockhaus\u2019 readings, and consequently made numerous fresh renderings or suggestions largely taken from MSS. borrowed from the Calcutta College and from three India Office MSS. lent him by Dr Rost.\n\nIn 1889 Durg\u0101pras\u0101d issued the Bombay edition, printed at the Nir\u1e47ayas\u0101gara Press, which was produced from Brockhaus\u2019 edition and two Bombay MSS. This is the latest text now available.\n\nIn 1919, N. M. Penzer first approached Tawney with the suggestion of reissuing his ''Ocean of the River of Streams''. But he revised and published Tawney\u2019s 2 volumes in 10 volumes in 1924. The first volume gave an introduction of Hindu fiction and the other famous story-collections like ''Panchatantra'', ''Hitopadesha'' etc. Volumes 2 to 10 published the original translation with extensive comments. Penzer invited different scholars to write forewords to each volume resulting in nine excellent essays dealing with all aspects of the great collection.\n\nA project to translate the full work into modern English prose, translated by Sir James Mallinson, began to appear in 2007 from the Clay Sanskrit Library, published by New York University Press. The translation was based on the Nirnaya Press\u2019s 1915 edition of the Sanskrit text, the edition favored by Sanskritists today. Currently available are 2 volumes of the projected 7-volume edition.\n\n==== Printed editions ====\n\n* {{citation | year=1889 | title = The Kath\u00e2sarits\u00e2gara of Somadevabhatta | editor1=Pandit Durg\u0101pras\u0101da | editor2=K\u0101\u015b\u012bn\u0101tha P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dura\u1e45ga Paraba | publisher=The Nirnaya-S\u00e2gara Press | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OKlDAAAAYAAJ}}\n* {{citation | year=1915 | title = The Kath\u00e2sarits\u00e2gara of Somadevabhatta | editor1=Pandit Durg\u0101pras\u0101da | editor2=K\u0101\u015b\u012bn\u0101tha P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dura\u1e45ga Paraba | publisher=The Nirnaya-S\u00e2gara Press | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OKlDAAAAYAAJ|last=|first=|volume=|pages=|edition=3rd|editor3-last=Wasudev Laxman Shastri Pansikar}}\n\n==== Translations ====\n\n*[[Charles Henry Tawney|C.
