The song was to be on Busta Rhymes's eighth studio album ''[[Back on My B.S.]]'', but was then cancelled off the track list because the album was released on a different label as \"We Made It\" was Busta Rhymes's last song on Interscope. The song was produced by [[Cool & Dre]], with additional production by Linkin Park's [[Mike Shinoda]] and [[Brad Delson]]. The song was released on April 29, 2011. It was Busta Rhymes's final release on [[Aftermath Entertainment]].\n\nThe track debuted and peaked on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] charts at number 65.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/2008-05-17/hot-100|title=Music: Top 100 Songs - Billboard Hot 100 Chart|publisher=}}</ref> The song debuted at number 14 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming Rhymes' 12th and Linkin Park's 10th top 20 hit in the United Kingdom. The single peaked at number 10 and remained there after the physical release. The single also had significant success in Germany peaking at number 11 on the German Singles Chart.\n\n==Background==\n[[Busta Rhymes]] said that the inspiration for this song was from what happened to [[T.I.]] after the [[BET Awards]]: {{quote|The record was inspired by the situation that transpired with [[T.I.]] right after the BET Hip-Hop Awards. My legal situations were current, and his legal situations were current, and [[Akon]] had his, you know, history of legal situations in the past ... We wanted people to \u2014 as bad as things might look for us sometimes \u2014 just know that it ain't over until you say it's over at the end of the day. 'Cause nobody can really dictate what the outcome of your destiny, what your life is going to end up becoming, unless you let it happen that way.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.7021/title.busta-rhymes-comments-on-star-studded-remix-album|title=Busta Rhymes Comments On Star-Studded Remix, Album|first=HipHopDX -|last=http://hiphopdx.com|publisher=}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Cool & Dre|Dre]] originally sang the hook, until Rhymes listened to the beat and Linkin Park kept \"popping up in his head\".\n\nThe song was first performed on May 2, 2011 during Busta's concert at Club Index in Germany. However, he was more or less introducing the song to them, as the studio version was played and Busta occasionally sang over the song, or lip synced to it while holding his microphone down. The first performance with Linkin Park was at their rehearsal studio Third Encore on May 25, 2011, to an audience of 14 members of the Linkin Park fan club who were brought there by surprise. During the [[Projekt Revolution]] 2011 tour the song's performance featured Adam Monroe of [[Ashes Divide]] on the keyboard and [[Spliff Star]] on backing vocals and was played during Linkin Park's set. During Busta Rhymes' concerts, where Linkin Park isn't present, the studio instrumental is played and Busta usually tells the audience to move their arms up and down during [[Mike Shinoda]]'s verse.\n\nThe song appears on the soundtrack of ''[[Madden NFL 09]]'' and it is used as the theme song for its coverage of the 2011 [[NBA Conference Finals|NBA Western Conference Finals]]. This marked the second time a Shinoda song was used during the NBA play-offs, the first being \"[[Remember the Name]]\" by [[Fort Minor]]. The song was also used in the 2011 [[Philadelphia Phillies]] home World Series game before the team took the field in Games 3, 4, and 5 and as part of a video reel of highlights for the team leading up to the World Series, with a road in the background as the team took their playoff run \"on the road\".\n\nUpon watching [[Barack Obama]]'s [[2011 United States presidential election|2011 Presidential election]] victory, Busta began cheering and singing the chorus of \"We Made It\".<ref>{{YouTube|aURko3YoJ2I|Busta Rhymes Reaction To Obama Win}}</ref>\n\n[[Chamillionaire]] created his own version of the song called \"The Real Thang\" with a similar theme.

The song was to be on Busta Rhymes's eighth studio album ''[[Back on My B.S.]]'', but was then cancelled off the track list because the album was released on a different label as \"We Made It\" was Busta Rhymes's last song on Interscope. The song was produced by [[Cool & Dre]], with additional production by Linkin Park's [[Mike Shinoda]] and [[Brad Delson]]. The song was released on April 29, 2008. It was Busta Rhymes's final release on [[Aftermath Entertainment]].\n\nThe track debuted and peaked on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] charts at number 65.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/2008-05-17/hot-100|title=Music: Top 100 Songs - Billboard Hot 100 Chart|publisher=}}</ref> The song debuted at number 14 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming Rhymes' 12th and Linkin Park's 10th top 20 hit in the United Kingdom. The single peaked at number 10 and remained there after the physical release. The single also had significant success in Germany peaking at number 11 on the German Singles Chart.\n\n==Background==\n[[Busta Rhymes]] said that the inspiration for this song was from what happened to [[T.I.]] after the [[BET Awards]]: {{quote|The record was inspired by the situation that transpired with [[T.I.]] right after the BET Hip-Hop Awards. My legal situations were current, and his legal situations were current, and [[Akon]] had his, you know, history of legal situations in the past ... We wanted people to \u2014 as bad as things might look for us sometimes \u2014 just know that it ain't over until you say it's over at the end of the day.

However, he was more or less introducing the song to them, as the studio version was played and Busta occasionally sang over the song, or lip synced to it while holding his microphone down. The first performance with Linkin Park was at their rehearsal studio Third Encore on May 25, 2008, to an audience of 14 members of the Linkin Park fan club who were brought there by surprise. During the [[Projekt Revolution]] 2008 tour the song's performance featured Adam Monroe of [[Ashes Divide]] on the keyboard and [[Spliff Star]] on backing vocals and was played during Linkin Park's set. During Busta Rhymes' concerts, where Linkin Park isn't present, the studio instrumental is played and Busta usually tells the audience to move their arms up and down during [[Mike Shinoda]]'s verse.\n\nThe song appears on the soundtrack of ''[[Madden NFL 09]]'' and it is used as the theme song for its coverage of the 2008 [[NBA Conference Finals|NBA Western Conference Finals]]. This marked the second time a Shinoda song was used during the NBA play-offs, the first being \"[[Remember the Name]]\" by [[Fort Minor]].

The song is a duet with American singer [[Mariah Carey]], and was co-written by Rah Digga, Rampage, Rick Rock and [[Spliff Star]]. It also includes a rap from Rhymes' group, the [[The Conglomerate (American group)|Flipmode Squad]]: Spliff Star, Baby Sham, [[Rah Digga]], and [[Rampage (rapper)|Rampage]].\n\nIt was released as the second single from ''It Ain't Safe No More'' in 2007 and was a hit across the world, peaking at number 3 in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom.

It takes place in [[Harlem]] in the 1980s. The title of the film is taken from the [[Paid in Full (album)|1987 album]] and [[Paid in Full (Eric B. & Rakim song)|1987 song]] by [[Eric B. & Rakim]]. \"Paid in Full\" is based on three friends [[Azie Faison|Azie \"AZ\" Faison]], [[Rich Porter]], and [[Alpo Martinez]] and their professional criminal exploits. The characters Ace ([[Wood Harris]]), Mitch ([[Mekhi Phifer]]), and Rico ([[Cam'ron]]), respectively, are based on these three drug dealers.\n\n==Plot==\nAce ([[Wood Harris]]) is a young man in the [[Harlem]] ghetto stuck in a [[Dead-end job|dead-end job]] at a dry cleaning shop. His sister's boyfriend, Calvin (Kevin Carroll), is a local cocaine dealer who tries to lure Ace into the drug trade with promises of fast money and women. Ace resists Calvin's temptations, not caring for his unsophisticated ways. Likewise, Ace's close friend Mitch ([[Mekhi Phifer]]) is a flashy, popular drug dealer who impresses Ace with his expensive automobiles and jewelry. \n\nWhile at work, Ace finds some cocaine in one of his customers' pants. The customer, Lulu, is a cocaine supplier who lets Ace keep the cocaine. When Calvin gets arrested on drug charges, Ace runs into one of his customers and easily sells him the cocaine for $100. Impressed, Ace goes back to Lulu and gets more product to sell.\n\nLulu has a top-quality supply of cocaine which Ace sells on the street at a cheap price, quickly luring away customers from other drug dealers. Ace starts wholesaling his product to other dealers in the neighborhood, believing everyone can make money and be happy. Meanwhile, Mitch is arrested for killing a stickup man who robbed one of his workers. When a fight breaks out between Mitch and another inmate, Mitch is aided by East Harlem inmate Rico ([[Cam'ron]]) who impresses Mitch by his ferocity and show of support. \n\nMitch is able to beat his murder charge and both him and Rico join Ace's drug empire. The trio become extremely wealthy, buying foreign cars, jewelry and expensive champagne. Ace continues to more or less stay behind the scenes, while Mitch returns to his lifestyle as a popular hustler. Rico is a ruthless enforcer who worries Ace with his overzealous, high-profile behavior.\n\nOne day Ace finds Lulu dead in his apartment. He collects what remains of Lulu's supply and finds some diamonds hidden in Lulu's closet. He takes these to Lulu's drug partners to convince them to keep doing business with Ace. When Calvin is released from prison, Ace gives him a job overseeing his old drug spot, but Calvin feels dissatisfied with his marginal position. \n\nWhen Ace refuses to let Calvin run his old block, Calvin retaliates by attempting to rob Ace at his Aunt June's ([[Elise Neal]]) apartment, holding June and Dora hostage. When Ace is unable to open the safe, June and Dora are executed by Calvin as another associate shoots Ace in the head, leaving him for dead. Despite his wounds, Ace survives as his baby is born the same night. Feeling the physical and psychological effects of the shooting, Ace decides to quit the drug trade. \n\nRico tries to assuage Ace's concerns by revealing that he killed Calvin in retaliation as a show of strength of the organization to potential enemies. Ace strongly disagrees with Rico's decision. Mitch understands Ace's perspective that the drug game does not reciprocate any love or generosity.

Mitch goes to Ace for help, as Ace provides him with enough cocaine to pay Sonny's ransom and allow Mitch and Rico to resume business. When Mitch brings the cocaine to Rico, he kills Mitch and robs him out of greed. When Ace asks Rico about his whereabouts that night, Rico lies, not knowing that Mitch had told Ace they were going to meet up the night of his death. \n\nAce settles the issue by giving him the contact to a pair of undercover FBI agents Ace had spoken to and avoided previously. Rico is arrested and is last seen in custody giving up information on his out-of-town drug connections in [[Washington D.C.]] in order to avoid a 25-to-life sentence.

It takes place in [[Harlem]] in the 1980s. The title of the film is taken from the [[Paid in Full (album)|1987 album]] and [[Paid in Full (Eric B. & Rakim song)|1987 song]] by [[Eric B. & Rakim]]. \"Paid in Full\" is based on three friends [[Azie Faison|Azie \"AZ\" Faison]], [[Rich Porter]], and [[Alpo Martinez]] and their professional criminal exploits. The characters Ace ([[Wood Harris]]), Mitch ([[Mekhi Phifer]]), and Rico ([[Cam'ron]]), respectively, are based on these three drug dealers.\n\n==Plot==\nAce ([[Wood Harris]]) is a young man in the [[Harlem]] ghetto stuck in a [[Dead-end job|dead-end job]] at a dry cleaning shop. His sister's boyfriend, Calvin (Kevin Carroll), is a local cocaine dealer who tries to lure Ace into the drug trade with promises of fast money and women. Ace resists Calvin's temptations, not caring for his unsophisticated ways. Likewise, Ace's close friend Mitch ([[Mekhi Phifer]]) is a flashy, popular drug dealer who impresses Ace with his expensive automobiles and jewelry. \n\nWhile at work, Ace finds some cocaine in one of his customers' pants. The customer, Lulu, is a cocaine supplier who lets Ace keep the cocaine. When Calvin gets arrested on drug charges, Ace runs into one of his customers and easily sells him the cocaine for $100. Impressed, Ace goes back to Lulu and gets more product to sell.\n\nLulu has a top-quality supply of cocaine which Ace sells on the street at a cheap price, quickly luring away customers from other drug dealers. Ace starts wholesaling his product to other dealers in the neighborhood, believing everyone can make money and be happy. Meanwhile, Mitch is arrested for killing a stickup man who robbed one of his workers. When a fight breaks out between Mitch and another inmate, Mitch is aided by East Harlem inmate Rico ([[Cam'ron]]) who impresses Mitch by his ferocity and show of support. \n\nMitch is able to beat his murder charge and both him and Rico join Ace's drug empire. The trio become extremely wealthy, buying foreign cars, jewelry and expensive champagne. Ace continues to more or less stay behind the scenes, while Mitch returns to his lifestyle as a popular hustler. Rico is a ruthless enforcer who worries Ace with his overzealous, high-profile behavior.\n\nOne day Ace finds Lulu dead in his apartment. He collects what remains of Lulu's supply and finds some diamonds hidden in Lulu's closet. He takes these to Lulu's drug partners to convince them to keep doing business with Ace. When Calvin is released from prison, Ace gives him a job overseeing his old drug spot, but Calvin feels dissatisfied with his marginal position. \n\nWhen Ace refuses to let Calvin run his old block, Calvin retaliates by attempting to rob Ace at his Aunt June's ([[Elise Neal]]) apartment, holding June and Dora hostage. When Ace is unable to open the safe, June and Dora are executed by Calvin as another associate shoots Ace in the head, leaving him for dead. Despite his wounds, Ace survives as his baby is born the same night. Feeling the physical and psychological effects of the shooting, Ace decides to quit the drug trade. \n\nRico tries to assuage Ace's concerns by revealing that he killed Calvin in retaliation as a show of strength of the organization to potential enemies. Ace strongly disagrees with Rico's decision. Mitch understands Ace's perspective that the drug game does not reciprocate any love or generosity. Mitch decides to stay in the drug game because he loves the hustle, comparing himself to professional basketball players that continue to chase glory despite having enough money to retire.

The album comes eight years after the rapper's critically acclaimed solo debut, ''[[Internal Affairs (Pharoahe Monch album)|Internal Affairs]]'', which followed the break-up of Monch's former group [[Organized Konfusion]]. After a short stint on [[Geffen Records]], a number of labels began a bidding war for the rapper, including [[Eminem]]'s [[Shady Records]], [[Denaun Porter]]'s Runyon Ave. Records, [[Bad Boy Records]] and [[Sony Records]]. In early 2006, it was announced that Pharoahe had signed a deal with Steve Rifkind's [[Street Records Corporation]] for the release of his second album.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://allhiphop.com/hiphopnews/?ID=5391 |title=AllHipHop.com: Where Were You In '92?<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2006-08-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630104945/http://www.allhiphop.com/hiphopnews/?ID=5391 |archive-date=2006-06-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The first song released from the album was \"Let's Go\", produced by [[Black Milk]]. \"Let's Go\" was featured as the [[B-side]] on the album's first proper single, \"Push\", released in September 2006. A music video for \"Push\" was also released in late September 2006, and has received play on [[MTV Base]]. The video is set in the [[New York City blackout of 1977]]. A ten-minute internet-only video for the track \"When the Gun Draws\" was released exclusively to AllHipHop.com on January 3, 2007. ''Desire'' features production from Monch, longtime collaborator Lee Stone, [[The Alchemist (producer)|The Alchemist]], [[Denaun Porter]], [[Black Milk]] and Sean C. Album guests include [[Erykah Badu]] and Denaun Porter. The single Desire is featured in the video game [[NBA Live 08]].\n\nThe album received critical acclaim, just like ''Internal Affairs''.

It was released in the United States in 2006 and features [[The D.E.Y.]], and was written by [[Ne-Yo]] and [[Christina Milian]] together with producers [[Stargate (production team)|Stargate]]. The song is about feelings from an old relationship that have resurfaced once the protagonist has seen her ex's new girlfriend.\n\n\"Walk Away\" reached number 18 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the second week of January 2007 and number four on the [[Mainstream Top 40|Pop Songs]] chart, becoming DeAnda's first top-twenty single on the Hot 100 and her biggest hit to date. It spent a total of 22 weeks on that chart. The song also found moderate success in Australia, peaking at number 60 on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Singles Chart]] in March 2007.\n\n==Music video==\nIn the music video, DeAnda is with her friends when she sees her old boyfriend with his new girlfriend. Then DeAnda and her old boyfriend make eye contact, and start to walk towards each other. As they are slowly walking, there are flashbacks to various moments in the past of DeAnda and her old boyfriend relating to the lyrics of the song. Once they finally reach each other, he touches her waist, DeAnda has a flashback of him flirting with another girl, implying to the viewers that they broke up because he cheated on her. Then DeAnda kisses him on the cheek and walks away with her friends.\n\n==Chart==\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (2006\u20132007)\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia ([[ARIA Charts|ARIA]])<ref>{{cite book|last=Ryan|first=Gavin|title=Australia's Music Charts 1988\u20132010|year=2011|publisher=Moonlight Publishing|location=Mt.
