[[Sunrise Animation]]. Retrieved on January 20, 2009.</ref> The series employs a kinetic visual gag style, often employing characters running with their feet over their shoulders derived from Sunrise's previous Super Robot anime series ''[[Choriki Robo Galatt]]''.\n\n==Story==\nThe story is about a 9-year-old boy named {{nihongo|Wataru Ikusabe|\u6226\u90e8 \u30ef\u30bf\u30eb|Ikusabe Wataru}} who is magically transported to a magical realm by a dragon. This realm is called {{nihongo|Soukaizan|\u5275\u754c\u5c71|S\u014dkaizan}}, which he is supposed to save from an evil, demonic ruler.\n\nThe series incorporates many elements of RPG games including dungeon levels and quests for mystical objects. Soukaizan itself is represented as a series of tiered platforms each floating above the one beneath it in a rough pyramid shape. In order to progress to the next tier where he will meet the series' ultimate villain, the show's heroes must complete some task on the one beneath. In addition to these, he has to defeat the ruler of each level along with his many henchmen. Each level he completes, rejuvenates one color of the gray rainbow over Soukaizan.\n\nIn his quest to save the realm, Wataru manages to transform a clay sculpture into a somewhat autonomous and small Super Robot. He also befriends many of the Soukaizan natives, and forms some very strong friendship bonds.  The term Sou-kai-zan can be broken down to its three parts: \"Sou\" (creation), \"Kai\" (realm, space, world, or universe), and \"Zan\" (hill or mountain), representing the pyramid shape of the world's level.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Mayumi Tanaka]] as Wataru Ikusabe (\u6226\u90e8 \u30ef\u30bf\u30eb ''Ikusabe Wataru'') (In ''Keith Courage in Alpha Zones'', he is known as ''Keith Courage'')\n*[[Megumi Hayashibara]] as Himiko Shinobibe (\u5fcd\u90e8 \u30d2\u30df\u30b3 ''Shinobibe Himiko'') (In ''Keith Courage in Alpha Zones'', she is known as ''Nurse Nancy'')\n*[[Tomomichi Nishimura]] as Shibaraku Tsurugibe (\u5263\u90e8 \u30b7\u30d0\u30e9\u30af ''Tsurugibe Shibaraku'') (In ''Keith Courage in Alpha Zones'', he is known as the ''Weapons Master'')\n*[[K\u014dichi Yamadera]] as Kurama Wataribe (\u6e21\u90e8 \u30af\u30e9\u30de ''Wataribe Kurama'')\n*[[Kenichi Ogata (voice actor)|Kenichi Ogata]] as Genry\u016bsai Shinobibe (\u5fcd\u90e8 \u5e7b\u9f8d\u658e ''Shinobibe Genry\u016bsai'')\n*[[Tessh\u014d Genda]] as ''Ry\u016bjinmaru''\n*[[Kazue Ikura]] as Toraoh (\u864e\u738b ''Tora\u014d'')\n*[[Urara Takano]] as ''Umihiko''\n\n==Episode list==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:80%; margin:auto; background:#FFF;\"\n|- style=\"border-bottom: 3px solid #575757;\"\n! style=\"width:5%;\"  | No.\n!

They are saved by Himiko when she transforms into a slot machine and releases small balls causing the two Mashins to slip and fall. Kurama sees this and plants a fake sign pointing to the legendary sword and shield. Before he goes through with this plans though, Wataru, Himiko and Shibaraku catch up to him. They journey together to the first hill and discover it to be a full sized football stadium. There they are ambushed by even more football themed Mashins.

After playing a game of tag, Toraoh makes her his bride, but has to run off when the search party for him flies overhead. The waters of life happen to only be extracted from flowers that haven't bloomed in awhile due to lack of sunlight. Soujinmaru attempts to break through the clouds to have a few rays shine downwards but instead runs into Cydorona and his Buruki 2. Guruman sacrifices himself to give Wataru enough time to resurrect Ryujinmaru. Ryujinmaru re-materializes and suggests that he can bond with the soul of Soujinmaru to become an even stronger mashin, Ryuomaru. With the new Ryuomaru, Buruki 2 is defeated easily.

The super-deformed mecha of the series are called \"mashin\". While written with the [[kanji]] for \"demon\" and \"god\", \"mashin\" is also a Japanese loanword for \"machine\".\n\nWataru and his friends Shibaraku and Himiko each represent different elements of ancient Japan: Wataru with his [[magatama]] and association with dragons represents the pre-[[Yamato period|Yamato]] Watari clan. Shibaraku represents [[samurai]]. Himiko represents [[ninja]].\n\nOn the contrary, the enemies along the way all have western looks and refer to many elements of American culture. The work can be perceived as having nationalist sentiments against the backdrop of the Japan-US trade war.\n\n==Cultural impact==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\nThe [[anime]] series was a huge hit in Japan, later being imported into Taiwan, Mainland China, and Hong Kong (the latter was shown on [[TVB Jade]]). Chinese translations were provided. The show became one of the most famous Japanese anime shows in China during the mid-1990s. The series is have said to of inspire the anime adaption of ''[[One Piece (manga)|One Piece]]'' seeing how the voice cast of Waturu have made appearances on the show.\n\n==Spinoffs==\nThe franchise has spawned three TV series (Mashin Eiyuuden Wataru, Mashin Eiyuuden Wataru 2, Chou Mashin Eiyuuden Wataru), four radio shows, five OVAs, five novels, five video games, and assorted other merchandise. One of the video games was the original pack-in game for the [[TurboGrafx-16]], and was renamed in the U.S as ''[[Keith Courage in Alpha Zones]]''.\n\nThe latest anime Mashin Hero Wataru: The Seven Spirits Of Ryujinmaru was released online on April 10, 2020. On April 24, 2020, it was announced that anime will be on a hiatus due to COVID-19.<ref>https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-04-24/new-mashin-eiyuden-wataru-net-anime-3rd-4th-episodes-delayed/.158946</ref>\n\nWataru's success prompted Bandai to copy the super-deformed mecha and multi-tiered world concepts in a science fiction setting with Sunrise's 1989 ''[[Mad\u014d King Granzort]]'' TV series.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nIn the premise of the Japanese anime, ''[[Brave Story]]'' is a [[novel]] created more than a decade later featuring a young boy named Wataru, who is transported to an RPG-like mystical realm. However that novel is not based on nor to be confused with this series.\n\n==Staff==\nDirector: [[Hideharu Iuchi]]\n\nAdditional Directors: [[Michio Fukuda]], [[Masamitsu Hidaka]], [[Nobuhiro Kondo]],

The first series aired on April 15, 1988, replacing the 17:00\u201317:30 timeslot used for ''[[Transformers: The Headmasters]]''.

[[Sunrise Animation]]. Retrieved on January 20, 2009.</ref> The series employs a kinetic visual gag style, often employing characters running with their feet over their shoulders derived from Sunrise's previous Super Robot anime series ''[[Choriki Robo Galatt]]''.\n\n==Story==\nThe story is about a 9-year-old boy named {{nihongo|Wataru Ikusabe|\u6226\u90e8 \u30ef\u30bf\u30eb|Ikusabe Wataru}} who is magically transported to a magical realm by a dragon. This realm is called {{nihongo|Soukaizan|\u5275\u754c\u5c71|S\u014dkaizan}}, which he is supposed to save from an evil, demonic ruler.\n\nThe series incorporates many elements of RPG games including dungeon levels and quests for mystical objects. Soukaizan itself is represented as a series of tiered platforms each floating above the one beneath it in a rough pyramid shape. In order to progress to the next tier where he will meet the series' ultimate villain, the show's heroes must complete some task on the one beneath. In addition to these, he has to defeat the ruler of each level along with his many henchmen. Each level he completes, rejuvenates one color of the gray rainbow over Soukaizan.\n\nIn his quest to save the realm, Wataru manages to transform a clay sculpture into a somewhat autonomous and small Super Robot. He also befriends many of the Soukaizan natives, and forms some very strong friendship bonds.  The term Sou-kai-zan can be broken down to its three parts: \"Sou\" (creation), \"Kai\" (realm, space, world, or universe), and \"Zan\" (hill or mountain), representing the pyramid shape of the world's level.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Mayumi Tanaka]] as Wataru Ikusabe (\u6226\u90e8 \u30ef\u30bf\u30eb ''Ikusabe Wataru'') (In ''Keith Courage in Alpha Zones'', he is known as ''Keith Courage'')\n*[[Megumi Hayashibara]] as Himiko Shinobibe (\u5fcd\u90e8 \u30d2\u30df\u30b3 ''Shinobibe Himiko'') (In ''Keith Courage in Alpha Zones'', she is known as ''Nurse Nancy'')\n*[[Tomomichi Nishimura]] as Shibaraku Tsurugibe (\u5263\u90e8 \u30b7\u30d0\u30e9\u30af ''Tsurugibe Shibaraku'') (In ''Keith Courage in Alpha Zones'', he is known as the ''Weapons Master'')\n*[[K\u014dichi Yamadera]] as Kurama Wataribe (\u6e21\u90e8 \u30af\u30e9\u30de ''Wataribe Kurama'')\n*[[Kenichi Ogata (voice actor)|Kenichi Ogata]] as Genry\u016bsai Shinobibe (\u5fcd\u90e8 \u5e7b\u9f8d\u658e ''Shinobibe Genry\u016bsai'')\n*[[Tessh\u014d Genda]] as ''Ry\u016bjinmaru''\n*[[Kazue Ikura]] as Toraoh (\u864e\u738b ''Tora\u014d'')\n*[[Urara Takano]] as ''Umihiko''\n\n==Episode list==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:80%; margin:auto; background:#FFF;\"\n|- style=\"border-bottom: 3px solid #575757;\"\n! style=\"width:5%;\"  | No.\n!

The super-deformed mecha of the series are called \"mashin\". While written with the [[kanji]] for \"demon\" and \"god\", \"mashin\" is also a Japanese loanword for \"machine\".\n\nWataru and his friends Shibaraku and Himiko each represent different elements of ancient Japan: Wataru with his [[magatama]] and association with dragons represents the pre-[[Yamato period|Yamato]] Watari clan. Shibaraku represents [[samurai]]. Himiko represents [[ninja]].\n\nOn the contrary, the enemies along the way all have western looks and refer to many elements of American culture. The work can be perceived as having nationalist sentiments against the backdrop of the Japan-US trade war.\n\n==Cultural impact==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\nThe [[anime]] series was a huge hit in Japan, later being imported into Taiwan, Mainland China, and Hong Kong (the latter was shown on [[TVB Jade]]). Chinese translations were provided. The show became one of the most famous Japanese anime shows in China during the mid-1990s. The series is have said to of inspire the anime adaption of ''[[One Piece (manga)|One Piece]]'' seeing how the voice cast of Waturu have made appearances on the show.\n\n==Spinoffs==\nThe franchise has spawned three TV series (Mashin Eiyuuden Wataru, Mashin Eiyuuden Wataru 2, Chou Mashin Eiyuuden Wataru), four radio shows, five OVAs, five novels, five video games, and assorted other merchandise. One of the video games was the original pack-in game for the [[TurboGrafx-16]], and was renamed in the U.S as ''[[Keith Courage in Alpha Zones]]''.\n\nThe latest anime Mashin Hero Wataru: The Seven Spirits Of Ryujinmaru was released online on April 10, 2020. \nWataru's success prompted Bandai to copy the super-deformed mecha and multi-tiered world concepts in a science fiction setting with Sunrise's 1989 ''[[Mad\u014d King Granzort]]'' TV series.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nIn the premise of the Japanese anime, ''[[Brave Story]]'' is a [[novel]] created more than a decade later featuring a young boy named Wataru, who is transported to an RPG-like mystical realm.
