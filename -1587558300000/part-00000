It is the only high school in Bexley City School system.\n\n==Athletics==\n\nBexley runs a comprehensive athletics program, including teams in the following: Football, Basketball, Baseball, Cheerleading, Cross Country, Field Hockey, Lacrosse, Soccer, Softball, Swimming, Tennis, Track, Volleyball and Wrestling. Bexley purchased [[artificial grass]] for athletes to perform on in the winter of 2003. Teams have won [[Ohio High School Athletic Association]] State Championships<ref name=\"Ohio High School Athletic Association\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ohsaa.org/|title=Ohio High School Athletic Association Web site|accessdate=2006-12-31|author=OHSAA}}</ref> in:\n* Boys [[Golf]] - 2015\n* Girls [[Association football|Soccer]] - 2009\n* Boys [[Basketball]] - 1983\n* Boys Soccer - 2003, 2005\n* Girls [[Volleyball]] - 1977\n* Girls [[Tennis]] (OTCA)- 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978\n* Boys Tennis (OTCA)- 1975, 2017\n\n===Football program===\nIn 2016 the program earned its first home playoff game and first playoff win and went 11-1.  The program also earned a playoff spot in the 2008, 2013, 2014, and 2015 seasons, all under Coach John Smith.\n\nAfter the 2016 season Coach Smith resigned, citing the need to spend more time with his family. As his replacement, Nathan Castorena took over the Lions and served for two seasons.<ref>http://www.thisweeknews.com/sports/20170317/football-castorena-eager-to-lead-lions</ref> In March 2019, Bexley announced the hiring of long-time Central Ohio coach Mike Golden.<ref>https://bexleyathletics.com/2019/03/13/bexley-seizes-golden-opportunity/</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Volleyball program===\nAfter setting a school record for wins in the 2007 season, going 25-2, and ending the season as Regional runners-up, Bexley has had few successful seasons since. Reasons for this include lack of a consistent coaching staff, and a competitive league. Bexley has continued to improve over the past few years and expects to do well in the near future.\n\n===Soccer program===\nBoth the Men's and Women's soccer programs are outstanding, and are widely known around the state and region. Between the men and the women they have combined for 12 State Final Fours since 1999.\n\nThe men's team has won two state championships in its history (2003 and 2005) and have had multiple Final Four and Regional Final finishes. They have also had a flurry of All District, All State, and two All-Americans selection (Daniel Broidy '08 and Jacob Hodge '12). The Men's program won their league championship for 15 straight seasons, until the streak was ended in 2008. The team was formerly coached by former Bexley player and OWU graduate Greg Kullman and is currently coached by Brian Stoddard.\n\nThe women have been one of the most consistent teams, regardless of sport (in the state) since coach Scott Dempsey took over. They were state finalists in 1999 through 2003, 2005, 2006, state runners-up in 1999, and State Champions in 2009 (although they were defeated in the championship game, the opposing team was playing with an ineligible player, forcing them to forfeit the championship). The women have also had multiple All District, All State, and All American recipients. The team is currently coached by Scott James.\n\n===Wrestling program===\n\nThe wrestling program has had individual successes throughout the school's history. There have been numerous state qualifiers, 10 state placers and one state champion. As a team there has not been a great deal of success until recently when they earned a Mid-State League Title in 2017 for first time since 1998. A team dual record of 17-2 was also set in 2017 breaking the previous season record of 16-3. The program currently has successful youth and junior high teams as well. The head wrestling coach of the program is Chris Bragg. He was the 2017 MSL-Ohio coach of the year and 2017 Division 2 District Coach of the year.\n\n===Softball program===\nThe 2018 season was one of the most successful in program history with the team going 14-9 and winning two games in the state tournament (defeating Licking Valley and London). The Lions advanced to the district semi-finals and fell to Hebron Lakewood. Coach Jessica Sciacca took over the program for the 2019 season after long-time coach Rick Wemlinger resigned after nine seasons.<ref>https://www.thisweeknews.com/sports/20180402/bexley-roundup-pitching-growth-key-for-baseball-team</ref>\n\n===Rivals===\nBexley's rival is the [[Columbus Academy]] Vikings. This competition stems from Columbus Academy being just two miles from Bexley High School before Academy's move to [[Gahanna, Ohio]]. Other rivals of Bexley include the [[Grandview Heights High School|Grandview Heights]] Bobcats, the [[Bishop Hartley High School (Columbus, Ohio)|Bishop Hartley]] Hawks, the [[Whitehall-Yearling High School]] Rams and the [[Saint Charles Preparatory School|St. Charles]] Cardinals.\n\n==Clubs==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*Conservative Club\n*Art Club\n*Bexleo ([[Yearbook]])\n*Ski Club\n*Environmental Club\n*Book Club\n*[[Key Club]]\n*The Lamplight\n*In The Know\n*Latin Club - functions as a local chapter of both the [[Junior Classical League state chapters#Ohio JCL|Ohio Junior Classical League]] (OJCL)<ref>{{cite web|title=Executive Board Pre-File Application|url=http://ohiojcl.org/prefile.shtml |year=2010|work=OhioJCL.org - June 2007|publisher=Internet Archive: Wayback Machine|accessdate=August 16, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070617024347/http://ohiojcl.org/prefile.shtml |archivedate = June 17, 2007}}</ref> and the [[National Junior Classical League]] (NJCL).<ref>{{cite web|title=OJCL Constitution|url=http://www.ohiojcl.org/resources/constitution.html#c31 |year=2010|work=OhioJCL.org - July 2002|publisher=Internet Archive: Wayback Machine|accessdate=August 16, 2010|quote=... by paying both OJCL annual chapter dues and any annual chapter membership dues required by NJCL. |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20020721140258/http://www.ohiojcl.org/resources/constitution.html#c31 |archivedate = July 21, 2002}}</ref>\n*[[Student council|Student Council]]\n*Band\n*Choirs: Men's [[Glee club|Glee]], Women's Glee, Men's Chorus, Women's Chorale, and Vocal Ensemble\n*Orchestra: Concert Orchestra, Bexley Sinfonia\n*[[Chess club|Chess Club]]\n*[[Ultimate (sport)|Ultimate]]\n*Engineering Club\n*eSports Club\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Choral Program==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}\nThe Choral program at the school has been extremely successful for the past decade.

It is the only high school in Bexley City School system.\n\n==Athletics==\n\nBexley runs a comprehensive athletics program, including teams in the following: Football, Basketball, Baseball, Cheerleading, Cross Country, Field Hockey, Lacrosse, Soccer, Softball, Swimming, Tennis, Track, Volleyball and Wrestling. Bexley purchased [[artificial grass]] for athletes to perform on in the winter of 2003. Teams have won [[Ohio High School Athletic Association]] State Championships<ref name=\"Ohio High School Athletic Association\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ohsaa.org/|title=Ohio High School Athletic Association Web site|accessdate=2006-12-31|author=OHSAA}}</ref> in:\n* Boys [[Golf]] - 2015\n* Girls [[Association football|Soccer]] - 2009\n* Boys [[Basketball]] - 1983\n* Boys Soccer - 2003, 2005\n* Girls [[Volleyball]] - 1977\n* Girls [[Tennis]] (OTCA)- 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978\n* Boys Tennis (OTCA)- 1975, 2017\n\n===Football program===\nIn 2016 the program earned its first home playoff game and first playoff win and went 11-1.  The program also earned a playoff spot in the 2008, 2013, 2014, and 2015 seasons, all under Coach John Smith.\n\nAfter the 2016 season Coach Smith resigned, citing the need to spend more time with his family. As his replacement, Nathan Castorena took over the Lions and served for two seasons.<ref>http://www.thisweeknews.com/sports/20170317/football-castorena-eager-to-lead-lions</ref> In March 2019, Bexley announced the hiring of long-time Central Ohio coach Mike Golden.<ref>https://bexleyathletics.com/2019/03/13/bexley-seizes-golden-opportunity/</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Volleyball program===\nAfter setting a school record for wins in the 2007 season, going 25-2, and ending the season as Regional runners-up, Bexley has had few successful seasons since. Reasons for this include lack of a consistent coaching staff, and a competitive league. Bexley has continued to improve over the past few years and expects to do well in the near future.\n\n===Soccer program===\nBoth the Men's and Women's soccer programs are outstanding, and are widely known around the state and region. Between the men and the women they have combined for 12 State Final Fours since 1999.\n\nThe men's team has won two state championships in its history (2003 and 2005) and have had multiple Final Four and Regional Final finishes. They have also had a flurry of All District, All State, and two All-Americans selection (Daniel Broidy '08 and Jacob Hodge '12). The Men's program won their league championship for 15 straight seasons, until the streak was ended in 2008. The team was formerly coached by former Bexley player and OWU graduate Greg Kullman and is currently coached by Brian Stoddard.\n\nThe women have been one of the most consistent teams, regardless of sport (in the state) since coach Scott Dempsey took over. They were state finalists in 1999 through 2003, 2005, 2006, state runners-up in 1999, and State Champions in 2009 (although they were defeated in the championship game, the opposing team was playing with an ineligible player, forcing them to forfeit the championship). The women have also had multiple All District, All State, and All American recipients. The team is currently coached by Scott James.\n\n===Wrestling program===\n\nThe wrestling program has had individual successes throughout the school's history. There have been numerous state qualifiers, 10 state placers and one state champion. As a team there has not been a great deal of success until recently when they earned a Mid-State League Title in 2017 for first time since 1998. A team dual record of 17-2 was also set in 2017 breaking the previous season record of 16-3. The program currently has successful youth and junior high teams as well. The head wrestling coach of the program is Chris Bragg. He was the 2017 MSL-Ohio coach of the year and 2017 Division 2 District Coach of the year.\n\n===Softball program===\nThe 2018 season was one of the most successful in program history with the team going 14-9 and winning two games in the state tournament (defeating Licking Valley and London). The Lions advanced to the district semi-finals and fell to Hebron Lakewood.

Through her travels and studies, Condon has become deeply influenced by ancient Chinese painting and philosophy, as well as the experience of living in modern Asian cities.\u00a0 In 2004, on a residency in Taiwan, she began to practice Chinese painting techniques, which emphasize variety in texture and inflection, as well as improvisation.<ref name=\"Church\"/>\u00a0\n\nShe draws from [[Yuan Dynasty]] scrolls the philosophy that a landscape painting is a portrait of an artist's inner life. She also borrows a complex sense of space and perspective, where different points of view are forged into one multi-layer and time-compressed experience. The resulting compositions have a real sense of space, but they are also puzzles, impossible to make sense of.<ref name=\"Hoffman\">{{cite news\n | last = Hoffman\n | first = Rachel\n | title = Elisabeth Condon\n | newspaper = M Magazine\n | location = Miami\n | date = December 2006\n | url = https://www.elisabethcondon.com/info/press/view/983371/2/983419}}</ref>\n\nCondon learned [[Ink wash painting|sumi-e brush painting]], which is as much a mediation practice as it is a painting technique, where form and gesture are united in a single stroke: \u201cthe form is created from gesture.

She translates this ancient method into her modern take on paint pouring.<ref name=\"Hyperallergic\"/>\n\n===Paint pouring and direct experience===\nCondon often begins a composition with pouring acrylic or oil paint, so that the kinetic quality of the material creates unexpected forms and effects. Her use of paint has been compared to [[Jackson Pollock]]<ref name=\"Weinberg\"/>\u00a0and [[Helen Frankenthaler]] (of whom Condon is a great admirer). Critic Franklin Einspruch comments on the essentialness of the paint pour to Condon's practice: \u201cPours are structural necessities in her work. They provide the primal soup from which her pictures emerge. Condon\u2019s pours are at the intersection of crossed axes, one between image and shape, the other between pattern and gesture, offering the potential in subsequent layers to transform into any of them.\u201d<ref name=\"MIA\">{{cite magazine\n | last = Einspruch\n | first = Franklin\n | title = Near and Distant Views\n | url = https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.icompendium.com/sites/elisabe2/sup/1147784-Condon-2018-Near-and-Distant-Views-FINAL-brochure.pdf\n | magazine = Essay published for the exhibition Near and Distant Views\n | location = Miami\n | publisher  = Miami International Airport Division of Fine Arts and Cultural Affairs}}</ref>\n\nShe pairs uncontrolled blobs and trails of paint with her detailed renderings of buildings, trees, and flowers.\u00a0 Since she does not plan out compositions beforehand, forms seems emerge organically out of the accident of the pour and materiality of paint.\u00a0 Says Condon, \u201cI\u2019m completely spontaneous. I start with pours of paint, so that painting becomes like taking a trip, with contingencies and unexpected outcomes.\u201d<ref name=\"Provk\"/>\n\nThis accidental, transformational, action-based method contributes to a sense energy and directness to her work: \u201cThe dynamism of Condon\u2019s all-over compositions feels self-propelled, and it\u2019s easy to imagine them stretching far beyond their borders into an endless, gyrating flow of birds, plants and streams of luscious, electric, energized color.\u201d<ref name=\"Hyperallergic\"/>\n\nThe pours make the materiality of paint central to the finished work. As one critic puts it: the paint is a \u201ctorrent of material\u2026[creating] a visual parallel to an unstoppable flood of water. This is what happens when paint is allowed to be just that, paint; it is thick, unwieldy and beautifully itself.\u201d<ref name=\"ArtPulse\"/>\n\nThe energy in her paintings connects back to her fascination with Chinese art and the belief that a painting must have qi, or a vital life force.<ref name=\"pretty lady\">{{cite web\n |url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.icompendium.com/sites/elisabe2/sup/988144-download.pdf\n |title= The Consciousness Painter\n |last=Jackson\n |first= Stephanie Lee\n |date= April 19, 2010\n |website= Pretty Lady\n |publisher= Blogspot\n |access-date=November 15, 2019\n |quote= }}</ref>\n\n===Travel===\n[[File:Elephant Path by Elisabeth Condon.jpg|thumb|Painting Elephant Path by Elisabeth Condon]]\nThe theme of place is crucial to her work. Condon travels frequently for artist residencies, and her globetrotting is evident in her paintings. Each new place works its way into her psyche and becomes a new layer or reference. \u201cThe idea of the pour as violent and sudden and the reconstruction out of that shock echoes the concept of modern travel,\u201d Condon said. \u201cYour whole ethos is impacted by where you are.\u201d<ref name= \"Kenyon\"/>\n\nHer landscapes feature references to places as far away as Taiwan, Beijing, and Australia, as well as her native California and homes in Florida and Manhattan.<ref name=\"Church\">{{cite magazine\n | last = Church\n | first = Amanda\n | date = Summer 2010\n | title = Review\n | url = https://www.elisabethcondon.com/info/press/view/983371/2/983413\n | magazine = ArtPapers\n | location = Atlanta\n | publisher  = }}</ref> She incorporates imagery from environments as diverse as the Everglades to the Grand Canyon to dense urban spaces.\n\nOne painting can contain myriad spaces or timelines layered over one another: \u201cPaintings hide beneath paintings in each painting.

In Shanghai she recognized the importance of decoration to the urban landscape and classical Chinese painting.\u00a0\n\nReexamining her experience from a feminist perspective, she began drawing inspiration from suburban home decor.<ref name=\"Into\">{{cite news\n | last = Fishman\n | first = George\n | title = Art review: \u2018Into the Wild\u2019 exhibit at MDC Kendall Campus explores forces of nature\n | newspaper = Miami Herald\n | location = Miami\n | date = October 25, 2015\n | url = https://www.miamiherald.com/entertainment/visual-arts/article41377077.html}}</ref>\u00a0 She reconsidered her mother's \u201cobsessive decorating\u201d of her childhood home, an aesthetic that had at one time been only a symbol of her family's stifling conservatism, and transformed it into an important element of her work.

The plum blossom in particular is not only of central importance to Chinese art, it also appeared on the wallpaper of her childhood bedroom.<ref name=\"Church\"/>\n\nWith their domestic references, sumptuous colors, floral imagery,<ref name=\"DL\">{{cite web\n |url=https://deliciousline.org/review/1\n |title= Review Elisabeth Condon: Bird and Flower at Lesley Heller Gallery\n |last= Einspruch\n |first= Franklin\n |date= November 3, 2016\n |website= Delicious Line\n |publisher= \n |access-date=November 15, 2019\n |quote= }}</ref> and use of pretty materials like glitter, her paintings engage with the world's disdain for a certain gender, class, and aesthetic taste.\u00a0 Like other [[Pattern and Decoration]] Artists, Condon reclaims her personal experience and love of beauty, asserting the importance and potential for intellectual rigor in such work. It is particularly powerful to use such imagery in large-scale, abstract work, a painting tradition that is dominated by men, expressing the feminist emphasis on personal experience, rather than a pure vision of an overarching narrative that is the project of [[abstract expressionism]].<ref name=\"Ando\">{{cite book\n |last=Ando\n |first=Erica\n |date=2017\n |title= Elisabeth Condon's Unnatural Life (exhibition catalog)\n |url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.icompendium.com/sites/elisabe2/sup/1147789-EmersonDorsch-ElisabethCondonBrochure-v04.pdf\n |location=Miami\n |publisher=Emerson Dorsch\n |page= \n |isbn=\n |author-link=\n}}</ref>\n\nIn the current political climate and in the wake of the [[Me Too movement|#metoo Movement]], \u201cthese are also deceptively political paintings.

Flowers are sexual, feminine, autonomous, and dismissed as minor. As such they dwell in the margins, free from scrutiny. My flowers are fissured, on the brink of collapse; glowing with internal light, like fire, before they curdle and die.\u201d<ref name=\"Provk\"/>\n\n==Early work==\nIn her earliest professional work, Condon made dolls portraits- as she describes it, as a method of recreating her childhood. However, the paintings were about more than nostalgia for a time of innocence. The paintings are described as both funny and unsettling: \u201cambiguity and conflict are recurring themes\u2026 Elisabeth Condon's deceptively decorative paintings are hardly distinguishable from the children she depicts, blurring the distinction between reality and fantasy.\u201d<ref name=\"Harrison\">{{cite news\n | last = Harrison\n | first = Helen\n | title = ART REVIEWS Defining a Century Through the Use of Color\n | newspaper = The New York Times\n | location = New York\n | date = October 14, 2001\n | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/14/nyregion/art-reviews-defining-a-century-through-the-use-of-color.html}}</ref>\n\n==Public work==\n[[File:Urban Idyll at Astoria\u2013Ditmars Boulevard station.jpg|thumb|Urban Idyll at Astoria\u2013Ditmars Boulevard station]]\nCondon's first major public commission was at the Tampa Airport in 2017.

Through her travels and studies, Condon has become deeply influenced by ancient Chinese painting and philosophy, as well as the experience of living in modern Asian cities.\u00a0 In 2004, on a residency in Taiwan, she began to practice Chinese painting techniques, which emphasize variety in texture and inflection, as well as improvisation.<ref name=\"Church\"/>\u00a0\n\nShe draws from [[Yuan Dynasty]] scrolls the philosophy that a landscape painting is a portrait of an artist's inner life. She also borrows a complex sense of space and perspective, where different points of view are forged into one multi-layer and time-compressed experience.

She translates this ancient method into her modern take on paint pouring.<ref name=\"Hyperallergic\"/>\n\n===''Paint Pouring and Direct Experience''===\nCondon often begins a composition with pouring acrylic or oil paint, so that the kinetic quality of the material creates unexpected forms and effects. Her use of paint has been compared to [[Jackson Pollock]]<ref name=\"Weinberg\"/>\u00a0and [[Helen Frankenthaler]] (of whom Condon is a great admirer). Critic Franklin Einspruch comments on the essentialness of the paint pour to Condon's practice: \u201cPours are structural necessities in her work. They provide the primal soup from which her pictures emerge. Condon\u2019s pours are at the intersection of crossed axes, one between image and shape, the other between pattern and gesture, offering the potential in subsequent layers to transform into any of them.\u201d<ref name=\"MIA\">{{cite magazine\n | last = Einspruch\n | first = Franklin\n | title = Near and Distant Views\n | url = https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.icompendium.com/sites/elisabe2/sup/1147784-Condon-2018-Near-and-Distant-Views-FINAL-brochure.pdf\n | magazine = Essay published for the exhibition Near and Distant Views\n | location = Miami\n | publisher  = Miami International Airport Division of Fine Arts and Cultural Affairs}}</ref>\n\nShe pairs uncontrolled blobs and trails of paint with her detailed renderings of buildings, trees, and flowers.\u00a0 Since she does not plan out compositions beforehand, forms seems emerge organically out of the accident of the pour and materiality of paint.\u00a0 Says Condon, \u201cI\u2019m completely spontaneous. I start with pours of paint, so that painting becomes like taking a trip, with contingencies and unexpected outcomes.\u201d<ref name=\"Provk\"/>\n\nThis accidental, transformational, action-based method contributes to a sense energy and directness to her work: \u201cThe dynamism of Condon\u2019s all-over compositions feels self-propelled, and it\u2019s easy to imagine them stretching far beyond their borders into an endless, gyrating flow of birds, plants and streams of luscious, electric, energized color.\u201d<ref name=\"Hyperallergic\"/>\n\nThe pours make the materiality of paint central to the finished work. As one critic puts it: the paint is a \u201ctorrent of material\u2026[creating] a visual parallel to an unstoppable flood of water. This is what happens when paint is allowed to be just that, paint; it is thick, unwieldy and beautifully itself.\u201d<ref name=\"ArtPulse\"/>\n\nThe energy in her paintings connects back to her fascination with Chinese art and the belief that a painting must have qi, or a vital life force.<ref name=\"pretty lady\">{{cite web\n |url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.icompendium.com/sites/elisabe2/sup/988144-download.pdf\n |title= The Consciousness Painter\n |last=Jackson\n |first= Stephanie Lee\n |date= April 19, 2010\n |website= Pretty Lady\n |publisher= Blogspot\n |access-date=November 15, 2019\n |quote= }}</ref>\n\n===''Travel''===\n[[File:Elephant Path by Elisabeth Condon.jpg|thumb|Painting Elephant Path by Elisabeth Condon]]\nThe theme of place is crucial to her work.

In the later Middle Ages, [[Catalan literature]] flourished. During the last Medieval centuries natural disasters, social turmoils and military conflicts affected the Principality. Between 1469 and 1516, the [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|king]] of [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] and the [[Isabella I of Castile|queen]] of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] were married and ruled their realms together, retaining all of their distinct institutions and legislation.\n\nDuring the [[Franco-Spanish War (1635\u201359)|Franco-Spanish War]] (1635\u20131659), [[Reapers' War|Catalonia revolted]] (1640\u20131652) against a large and burdensome presence of the royal army in its territory, being briefly proclaimed a [[Catalan Republic (1641)|republic]] under French protection. Within a brief period France took full control of Catalonia, until it was largely reconquered by the Spanish army. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] in 1659, the [[Spanish Crown]] ceded the northern parts of Catalonia, mostly the [[County of Roussillon]], to France. During the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701\u20131714), the Crown of Aragon sided against the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] [[Philip V of Spain]]; following Catalan defeat on 11 September 1714, Philip V, inspired by the model of France imposed a unifying administration across Spain, enacting the [[Nueva Planta decrees]], suppressing the main Catalan institutions and rights like in the other realms of the Crown of Aragon. This led to the eclipse of Catalan as a language of government and literature, replaced by Spanish. Throughout the 18th century, Catalonia experienced economic growth, reinforced in the late quarter of the century when the Castile's trade monopoly with American colonies ended.\n\nIn the 19th century, Catalonia was severely affected by the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic]] and [[Carlist Wars]]. In the second third of the century, Catalonia experienced significant industrialisation. As wealth from the industrial expansion grew, Catalonia saw a [[Renaixen\u00e7a|cultural renaissance]] coupled with incipient [[Catalan nationalism|nationalism]] while several workers movements appeared. In 1914, the four Catalan provinces formed a [[Commonwealth of Catalonia|commonwealth]], and with the return of democracy during the [[Second Spanish Republic]] (1931\u20131939), the [[Generalitat de Catalunya|Generalitat of Catalonia]] was restored as an autonomous government. After the [[Spanish Civil War]], the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist]] dictatorship enacted repressive measures, abolishing Catalan self-government and banning the official use of the Catalan language again. After a first period of [[autarky]], from the late 1950s through to the 1970s Catalonia saw [[Spanish miracle|rapid economic growth]], drawing many workers from across Spain, making Barcelona one of Europe's largest industrial metropolitan areas and turning Catalonia into a major tourist destination. Since the [[Spanish transition to democracy]] (1975\u20131982), Catalonia has regained considerable autonomy in political, educational, environmental, and cultural affairs and is now one of the most economically dynamic communities of Spain. In the 2010s there has been growing support for [[Catalan independence movement|Catalan independence]]. On 27 October 2017, the Catalan Parliament declared unilaterally independence from Spain following a [[2017 Catalan independence referendum|disputed referendum]]. The Spanish Senate voted in favour of enforcing direct rule by removing the entire Catalan government and calling [[2017 Catalan regional election|a snap regional election for 21 December]]. On 2 November of the same year, the Spanish Supreme Court imprisoned seven former ministers of the Catalan government on charges of rebellion and misuse of public funds, while several others\u2014including then-President of Catalonia, [[Carles Puigdemont]]\u2014fled to other European countries (such as Belgium, in Puigdemont's case).\n\n== Etymology and pronunciation ==\nThe name Catalonia\u2014''Catalunya'' in Catalan, spelled ''Cathalonia'', or ''Cathalaunia'' in [[Medieval Latin]]\u2014began to be used for the homeland of the [[Catalans]] (''Cathalanenses'') in the late 11th century and was probably used before as a territorial reference to the group of counties that comprised part of the March of Gothia and [[Marca Hispanica|March of Hispania]] under the control of the [[Count of Barcelona]] and his relatives.<ref>[http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0016436 Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana online: Catalunya (\"Geral de Cataluign, Raimundi Catalan and Arnal Catalan appear in 1107/1112\")] (in Catalan) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206211826/http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0016436 |date=6 February 2012 }}</ref> The origin of the name ''Catalunya'' is subject to diverse interpretations because of a lack of evidence.\n\nOne theory suggests that ''Catalunya'' derives from the name ''Gothia'' (or ''Gauthia'') ''Launia'' (\"Land of the [[Goths]]\"), since the origins of the Catalan counts, lords and people were found in the March of Gothia, known as ''Gothia'', whence ''Gothland'' > ''Gothlandia'' > ''Gothalania'' > ''Cathalaunia'' > ''Catalonia'' theoretically derived.<ref name=\"Books.google.com\"/><ref>{{cite book| author = Ulick Ralph Burke| title = A history of Spain from the earliest times to the death of Ferdinand the Catholic| url = https://archive.org/details/ahistoryspainfr02burkgoog| year = 1900| publisher = Longmans, Green, and co.| page = [https://archive.org/details/ahistoryspainfr02burkgoog/page/n187 154]}}</ref> During the [[Middle Ages]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] chroniclers claimed that ''Catalania'' derives from the local medley of [[Goths]] with [[Alans]], initially constituting a ''Goth-Alania''.<ref>The Sarmatians: 600 BC-AD 450 (Men-at-Arms) by Richard Brzezinski and Gerry Embleton, 19 August 2002.</ref>\n\nOther less plausible or recent theories suggest:\n\n* ''Catalunya'' derives from the term \"land of castles\", having evolved from the term ''castl\u00e0'' or ''castlan'', the medieval term for a [[castellan]] (a ruler of a [[castle]]).<ref name=\"Books.google.com\">{{cite book| author = Maximiano Garc\u00eda Venero| title = Historia del nacionalismo catal\u00e1n: 2a edici\u00f3n| url = https://books.google.com/?id=nUABAAAAMAAJ| accessdate = 25 April 2010| date = 7 July 2006| publisher = Ed.

The Iberians of this area \u2013 the [[Ilergetes]], [[Indigetes]] and [[Lacetani]] (Cerretains) \u2013 also maintained relations with the peoples of the Mediterranean. Some urban agglomerations became relevant, including Ilerda (Lleida) inland, Hibera (perhaps [[Amposta]] or [[Tortosa]]) or Indika ([[Ullastret]]). Coastal trading colonies were established by the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], who settled around the [[Gulf of Roses]], in Emporion ([[Emp\u00faries]]) and [[Roses, Girona|Roses]] in the [[Colonies in antiquity|8th century BC]]. The [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] briefly ruled the territory in the course of the [[Second Punic War]] and traded with [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|the surrounding Iberian population]].\n\nAfter the Carthaginian defeat by the [[Roman Republic]], the north-east of Iberia became the first to come under Roman rule and became part of [[Hispania]], the westernmost part of the [[Roman Empire]]. [[Tarraco (Tarragona)|Tarraco]] (modern [[Tarragona]]) was one of the most important Roman cities in Hispania and the capital of the [[Roman province|province]] of [[Tarraconensis]]. Other important cities of the Roman period are Ilerda (Lleida), Dertosa (Tortosa), Gerunda (Girona) as well as the ports of Empuri\u00e6 (former Emporion) and Barcino (Barcelona). As for the rest of Hispania, [[Latin law]] was granted to all cities under the reign of [[Vespasian]] (69-79 AD), while [[Roman citizenship]] was granted to all free men of the empire by the [[Edict of Caracalla|Edict of]] [[Caracalla]] in 212 AD (Tarraco, the capital, was already a colony of [[Roman law]] since 45 BC). It was a rich agricultural province (olive oil, vine, [[wheat]]), and the first centuries of the Empire saw the construction of roads (the most important being the [[Via Augusta]], parallel to Mediterranean coastline) and infrastructure like [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueducts]].\n\nConversion to [[Christianity]], attested in the 3rd century, was completed in urban areas in the 4th century. Although Hispania remained under Roman rule and did not fall under the rule of [[Vandals]], [[Swabians]] and [[Alans]] in the 5th century, the main cities suffered frequent sacking and some [[deurbanization]].\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\n[[File:Origen de l'escut del comtat de Barcelona de Lorenzale.jpg|thumb|left|''Origins of the blason of the County of Barcelona'', by [[Claudi Lorenzale]] ]]\nAfter the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the area was conquered by the [[Visigoths]] and was ruled as part of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] for almost two and a half centuries. In 718, it came under [[Muslim]] control and became part of [[Al-Andalus]], a province of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. From the conquest of Roussillon in 760, to the conquest of Barcelona in 801, the [[Frankish empire]] took control of the area between Septimania and the [[Llobregat]] river from the Muslims and created heavily militarised, self-governing [[county|counties]]. These counties formed part of the [[Septimania|Gothic]] and [[Spanish March|Hispanic]] marches, a [[buffer zone]] in the south of the Frankish empire in the former province of Septimania and in the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula, to act as a defensive barrier for the Frankish empire against further Muslim invasions from Al-Andalus.\n[[File:Petronila Ramon Berenguer.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Petronilla of Aragon]] and [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona]], dynastic union of the [[Crown of Aragon]]]]\nThese counties came under the rule of the [[Count of Barcelona|counts of Barcelona]], who were Frankish [[vassal]]s nominated by the emperor of the Franks, to whom they were [[feudatory|feudatories]] (801\u2013987). The earliest known use of the name \"[[Principality of Catalonia|Catalonia]]\" for these counties dates to 1117.

In 1137, [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona]] decided to accept [[Ramiro II of Aragon|King Ramiro II of Aragon]]'s proposal to marry Queen [[Petronilla of Aragon|Petronila]], establishing the dynastic union of the County of Barcelona with the [[Kingdom of Aragon]], joining the [[Crown of Aragon]] and making the Catalan counties that were united under the county of Barcelona into a [[principality]] of the Aragonese Crown.\n\nIn 1258, by means of the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1258)|Treaty of Corbeil]], [[James I of Aragon]] King of Aragon and [[Count of Barcelona]] , of Mallorca and of Valencia, renounced his family rights and dominions in [[Occitania]] and recognised the king of France as heir of the [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian Dynasty]]. The king of France formally relinquished his nominal feudal lordship over all the Catalan counties, except the [[County of Foix]], despite the opposition of the king of Aragon and count of Barcelona. This treaty transformed the principality's ''[[de facto]]'' union with Aragon into a ''[[de jure]]'' one and was the origin of the definitive separation between the geographical areas of Catalonia and [[Languedoc]].\n\nAs a coastal territory, Catalonia became the base of the Aragonese Crown's maritime forces, which spread the power of the Aragonese Crown in the Mediterranean, and made Barcelona into a powerful and wealthy city. In the period of 1164\u20131410, new territories, the [[Kingdom of Valencia]], the [[Kingdom of Majorca]], [[Sardinia]], the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], [[Corsica]], and (briefly) the [[Duchy|Duchies]] of [[Duchy of Athens|Athens]] and [[Duchy of Neopatras|Neopatras]], were incorporated into the dynastic domains of the [[House of Aragon]].\n\nAt the same time, the Principality of Catalonia developed a complex institutional and political system based in the concept of a pact between the [[estates of the realm]] and the king.

Charles II had chosen [[Philip V of Spain]] from the French [[House of Bourbon]]. Catalonia, like other territories that formed the Crown of Aragon, rose up in support of the Austrian Habsburg pretender [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor]], in his claim for the Spanish throne as Charles III of Spain. The fight between the houses of Bourbon and Habsburg for the Spanish Crown split Spain and Europe.\n\nThe [[Siege of Barcelona (1713\u201314)|fall of Barcelona]] on 11 September 1714 to the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] king [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] militarily ended the Habsburg claim to the Spanish Crown, which became legal fact in the [[Treaty of Utrecht]]. Philip felt that he had been betrayed by the Catalan Courts, as it had initially sworn its loyalty to him when he had presided over it in 1701. In retaliation for the betrayal, the first Bourbon king introduced the [[Nueva Planta decrees]] that incorporated the territories of the Crown of Aragon, including Catalonia, as provinces under the Crown of Castile in 1716, terminating their separate institutions, laws and rights, within a united kingdom of Spain.<ref>Mercader, J. ''Felip V i Catalunya''.

In 1808 it was occupied by the French troops, the resistance against the occupation eventually developed into the [[Peninsular War]]. The rejection to French dominion was institutionalized with the creation of \"juntas\" (councils) who, remaining loyal to the Bourbons, exercised the sovereignty and representation of the territory due to the disappearance of the old institutions. Napoleon took direct control of Catalonia to establish order, creating the Government of Catalonia under the rule of [[Marshall Augereau]], and making Catalan briefly an official language again. Between 1812 and 1814 Catalonia was annexed to France and organized as four [[French departments of Spain|d\u00e9partements]].<ref>''[http://www.histoire-empire.org/departements/france_modifications.htm Les modifications int\u00e9rieures de la France]''</ref> The French troops evacuated Catalan territory at the end of 1814. After the Bourbon restoration in Spain and the death of the abolutist king [[Ferdinand VII]], [[Carlist Wars]] erupted against the new born [[Liberalism|liberal state]] of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]]. Catalonia was divided, the coast and most industrialized areas support liberalism, while many inland areas were in the hands of [[Carlism|Carlists]], as the last ones proposed to reestablish the institutional systems suppressed in the Nueva Planta decrees in all the ancient realms of the Crown of Aragon.\n\n[[File:Semana tragica.jpg|thumb|left|Demonstration after the [[Tragic Week (Catalonia)|Tragic Week]], 1909]]\nIn the second third of the 19th century, it became an industrial center.

Along the century, textile industry flourished in urban areas and in the countryside, usually in the form of [[company towns]]. To this day it remains one of the most industrialised areas of Spain. In 1832 it was inaugurated in Barcelona the factory Bonaplata, the first of the country which worked with [[steam engine]]. During those years, Barcelona was the focus of important revolutionary uprisings, called \"bullangues\", causing a difficult relation between many sectors of Catalan society and the central government and, in Catalonia, a [[republicanism|republican]] current began to develop; also, inevitably, many Catalans favored a more federal Spain. Meanwhile, the Catalan language saw a cultural renaissance (the ''[[Renaixen\u00e7a]]'') at popular and bourgeois level.

Catalonia, like many other parts of Spain, had been devastated by the war. Recovery from the war damage was slow and made more difficult by the international trade embargo and the [[Autarky|autarkic]] politics of Franco's regime. By the late 1950s the region had recovered its pre-war economic levels and in the 1960s was the second fastest growing economy in the world in what became known as the [[Spanish miracle]]. During this period there was a spectacular growth of industry and tourism in Catalonia that drew large numbers of workers to the region from across Spain and made the area around Barcelona into one of Europe's largest industrial metropolitan areas.\n\n=== Transition and democratic period (1975\u2013present) ===\n\n[[File:Barcelona AUGUST 1992 the Olympic Games (Juegos Ol\u00edmpicos de Barcelona 1992) - panoramio.jpg|thumb|200px|The Olympic flame in the [[Estadi Ol\u00edmpic Llu\u00eds Companys|Olympic Stadium Llu\u00eds Companys]] of [[Barcelona]] during the [[1992 Summer Olympics]]]]\nAfter Franco's death in 1975, Catalonia voted for the adoption of a democratic Spanish Constitution in 1978, in which Catalonia recovered political and cultural autonomy, restoring the Generalitat (exiled since the end of the Civil War in 1939) in 1977 and adopting a [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 1979|new Statute of Autonomy]] in 1979. [[1980 Catalan regional election|First election]] to the Parliament of Catalonia under this Statute gave the Catalan presidency to [[Jordi Pujol]], a position he would hold until 2003. During this time, he also led [[Convergence and Unity|Converg\u00e8ncia i Uni\u00f3]] (CiU), a center-right Catalan nationalist electoral coalition. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the institutions of Catalan autonomy continued to develop, among them an autonomous police force (''[[Mossos d'Esquadra]]'', in 1983),<ref>[https://mossos.gencat.cat/ca/els_mossos_desquadra/historia_de_la_pg-me/ History of the Mossos d'Esquadra] mossos.gencat.cat</ref> and the broadcasting network [[Televisi\u00f3 de Catalunya]] and its first channel [[TV3 (Catalonia)|TV3]], created in 1983.<ref>[http://www.ccma.cat/corporatiu/en/historia/ History of Televisi\u00f3 de Catalunya] ccma.cat</ref> Today, Catalonia is one of the most economically dynamic communities of Spain. The Catalan capital and largest city, Barcelona, is a major international cultural centre and a major tourist destination. In 1992, [[1992 Summer Olympics|Barcelona hosted]] the [[Summer Olympic Games]].\n\nIn November 2003, elections to the Parliament of Catalonia gave the government to a left-wing catalanist coalition formed by the [[Socialists' Party of Catalonia]] (PSC-PSOE), [[Republican Left of Catalonia]] (ERC) and [[Initiative for Catalonia Greens]] (ICV), and the socialist [[Pasqual Maragall]] was appointed President. The new government redacted a [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia|new version of the Statute of Autonomy]], which consolidated and extended certain aspects of self-government.\n\nThe new Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia, approved after a referendum in 2006, was contested by important sectors of the Spanish society, especially by the conservative [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]], which sent the law to the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]]. In 2010, the Court declared non-valid some of the articles that established an autonomous Catalan system of Justice, better aspects of the financing, a new territorial division, the status of Catalan language or the symbolical declaration of Catalonia as a nation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/3748884/20100629/sentencia-lestatut-obre-nova-era-politica-catalunya.html|title=An\u00e0lisi de les retallades a l'estatut de Catalunya|last=associats|first=Partal, Maresma i|access-date=13 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913152842/http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/3748884/20100629/sentencia-lestatut-obre-nova-era-politica-catalunya.html|archive-date=13 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> This decision was severely contested by large sectors of Catalan society, which increased the demands of independence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ara.cat/especials/gentada-centre-Barcelona-mitja-manifestacio_0_772122901.html|title=Un mili\u00f3 i mig de manifestants per la independ\u00e8ncia de Catalunya|access-date=13 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918025513/http://www.ara.cat/especials/gentada-centre-Barcelona-mitja-manifestacio_0_772122901.html|archive-date=18 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==== Independence movement ====\n{{Main|Catalan independence movement|2017\u201318 Spanish constitutional crisis}}\n[[File:President_Puigdemont,_\"Ciutadans_de_Catalunya,_v\u00e9nen_hores_en_qu\u00e8_a_tots_ens_pertocar\u00e0_de_mantenir_el_pols_del_nostre_pa\u00eds\"_02.jpg|thumb|[[President of the Generalitat of Catalonia|Catalan president]], [[Carles Puigdemont]], addresses to the crowd following the unilateral declaration of independence on 27 October]]\nA controversial [[2017 Catalan independence referendum|independence referendum]] was held in Catalonia on 1 October 2017, using a disputed voting process.<ref name=\"ElPais03102017\">{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/elpais/2017/10/01/inenglish/1506858911_482600.html|title=Did the referendum comply with basic voting regulations?|date=3 October 2017|work=[[El Pa\u00eds]]|accessdate=5 October 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/happened-catalonias-vote-independence-whats-next/|title=What happened with Catalonia's vote for independence -- and what's next|last=Epatko |first=Larisa|date=4 October 2017|work=[[PBS NewsHour]]|accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref> It was declared illegal and suspended by the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]], because it breached the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|1978 Constitution]].<ref name=\"boe2162017\">{{cite web|url=https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2017/09/08/pdfs/BOE-A-2017-10287.pdf|title=Recurso de inconstitucionalidad n.\u00ba 4334-2017, contra la Ley del Parlamento de Catalu\u00f1a 19/2017, de 6 de septiembre, del Refer\u00e9ndum de Autodeterminaci\u00f3n.|publisher=Agencia Estatal Bolet\u00edn Oficial del Estado|date=6 September 2017|accessdate=5 October 2017|language=es}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-10/catalan-separatists-plot-show-of-strength-in-battle-with-madrid|title=Catalan Separatists Plot Show of Force in Battle With Madrid|last=Duarte|first=Esteban|date=11 September 2017|publisher=Bloomberg|access-date=13 September 2017|language=en}}</ref> Subsequent developments saw, on 27 October 2017, a symbolic [[Catalan declaration of independence|declaration of independence]] by the Parliament of Catalonia, the enforcement of [[Direct rule over Catalonia|direct rule]] by the Spanish government through the use of Article 155 of the Constitution,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2017/oct/22/protests-in-barcelona-against-suspension-of-catalan-autonomy-in-pictures|title=Protests in Barcelona against suspension of Catalan autonomy \u2013 in pictures|last=Fidler|first=Matt|date=22 October 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=2 August 2018|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-41780116|title=Catalans declare independence from Spain|date=27 October 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=27 October 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Sam|last2=Burgen|first2=Stephen|last3=Graham-Harrison|first3=Emma|title=Spain dissolves Catalan parliament and calls fresh elections|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/27/spanish-pm-mariano-rajoy-asks-senate-powers-dismiss-catalonia-president|work=[[the Guardian]]|date=28 October 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.es/2017/10/27/directo-el-senado-vota-la-aplicacion-del-155-y-el-parlament-catalan-su-respuesta-al-mismo_a_23257831/|title=DIRECTO: El Senado aprueba la aplicaci\u00f3n del 155|date=27 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/cataluna/2017/10/27/59f2d55aca4741a0668b4646.html|title=En vivo -

The populated areas lying by the coast in Tarragona, Barcelona and Girona provinces feature a [[Hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Csa'').

Winter is cool or slightly cold depending on the location. It snows frequently in the Pyrenees, and it occasionally snows at lower altitudes, even by the coastline. Spring and autumn are typically the rainiest seasons, except for the Pyrenean valleys, where summer is typically stormy.\n\nThe inland part of Catalonia is hotter and drier in summer. Temperature may reach {{convert|35|\u00b0C}}, some days even {{convert|40|\u00b0C}}. Nights are cooler there than at the coast, with the temperature of around {{convert|14|-|17|\u00b0C}}.

The [[geography]] is conditioned by the Mediterranean coast, with {{convert|580|km|mi|abbr=off}} of coastline, and large relief units of the Pyrenees to the north. The Catalan territory is divided into three main geomorphological units:<ref>{{cite web|title=Geological map of Catalonia|url=http://www.icgc.cat/en/Public-Administration-and-Enterprises/Downloads/Geological-and-geothematic-cartography/Geological-mapping/Geological-map-of-Catalonia-1-50.000|publisher=Institut Cartogr\u00e0fic i Geol\u00f2gic de Catalunya|accessdate=11 October 2017|date=2016}}</ref>\n\n* The Pyrenees: mountainous formation that connects the Iberian Peninsula with the [[Continental Europe|European continental territory]], and located in the north of Catalonia;\n* The Catalan Coastal mountain ranges or the Catalan Mediterranean System: an alternating delevacions and planes parallel to the Mediterranean coast;\n* The [[Catalan Central Depression]]: structural unit which forms the eastern sector of the Valley of the Ebro.\n\n[[File:2012 Montserrat.jpg|thumb|left|Mountain of [[Montserrat (mountain)|Montserrat]] and the [[Santa Maria de Montserrat Abbey|monastery]]]]\nThe Catalan Pyrenees represent almost half in length of the Pyrenees, as it extends more than {{convert|200|km|abbr=off}}. Traditionally differentiated the Axial Pyrenees (the main part) and the [[Pre-Pyrenees]] (southern from the Axial) which are mountainous formations parallel to the main mountain ranges but with lower altitudes, less steep and a different geological formation. The highest mountain of Catalonia, located north of the comarca of Pallars Sobir\u00e0 is the Pica d'Estats (3,143&nbsp;m), followed by the Puigpedr\u00f3s (2,914&nbsp;m). On the Pre-Pyrenees is located the [[Serra del Cad\u00ed]], that separates the valley of [[Cerdanya]] from the Central Depression.\n\nCentral Catalan Depression is a plain located between the Pyrenees and Pre-Coastal Mountains. The Depression lands are located between {{convert|200|and|600|m|ft|abbr=off}}. The plains and the water that descend from the Pyrenees have made it fertile territory for [[agriculture]] and there are built numerous irrigation canals. Other important plain is the [[Empord\u00e0]], located on the northeast.\n\nThe Catalan Mediterranean system is based on two (more or less) parallel ranges to the coast, in a Northwest direction towards the Southwest. These two mountain ranges are the Coastal and the Pre-Coastal. The Coastal Range is minor extent and it has lower altitudes, while the Pre-Coastal is larger in both length and height. The most relevant mountains of this area are [[Montserrat (mountain)|Montserrat]], [[Montseny Massif|Montseny]] and [[Ports de Tortosa-Beseit|Ports]]. Within the ranges are a series of plains, the entities over which form the Coastal and the Pre-Coastal Depressions. The Coastal Depression is located on the East of the Coastal Range towards the coast. The Pre-Coastal, on the other hand, is located in the interior, between the two mountain ranges, and constitutes the basis of the plains of [[Vall\u00e8s]] and [[Pened\u00e8s]].\n\n=== Flora and fauna ===\n[[File:BennyTrapp Montseny-Gebirgsmolch Calotriton arnoldi Montseny-Gebirge Spanien.jpg|thumb|Montseny brook newt (''[[Calotriton arnoldi]]''), [[endemic]] to the [[Montseny Massif]]]]\nCatalonia is a showcase of European [[landscapes]] on a small scale.

The area is of great ecological diversity and a remarkable wealth of landscapes, habitats and species.\n\nThe fauna of Catalonia comprises a minority of animals endemic to the region and a majority of non-native animals. Much of Catalonia enjoys a Mediterranean climate (except mountain areas), which makes many of the animals that live there adapted to Mediterranean ecosystems. Of mammals, there are plentiful [[wild boar]], red foxes, as well as [[roe deer]] and in the Pyrenees, the [[Pyrenean chamois]]. Other large species such as the [[bear]] have been recently reintroduced.\n\nWaters of [[Balearic Sea]] are rich in biodiversity, and even the [[megafauna]]s of ocean; various type of whales (such as [[fin whale|fin]], [[sperm whale|sperm]], and [[long-finned pilot whale|pilot]]) and [[dolphin]]s live within the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edmaktub.org/en/home-2/|title=EDMAKTUB I Estudio de cet\u00e1ceos|website=www.edmaktub.org}}</ref><ref>Casinos A.

The Catalan hydrographic network consists of two important basins, the one of the [[Ebro]] and the one that comprises the internal basins of Catalonia (respectively covering 46.84% and 51.43% of the territory), all of them flow to the [[Mediterranean]]. Furthermore, there is the [[Garona]] river basin that flows to the [[Atlantic Ocean]], but it only covers 1.73% of the Catalan territory.\n\nThe hydrographic network can be divided in two sectors, an occidental slope or Ebro river slope and one oriental slope constituted by minor rivers that flow to the Mediterranean along the Catalan coast. The first slope provides an average of {{convert|18700|hm3|cumi|lk=on|abbr=off}} per year, while the second only provides an average of {{convert|2020|hm3|cumi|abbr=on}}/year. The difference is due to the big contribution of the Ebro river, from which the [[Segre (river)|Segre]] is an important tributary. Moreover, in Catalonia there is a relative wealth of groundwaters, although there is inequality between ''[[comarca|comarques]]'', given the complex geological structure of the territory.<ref name=\"GEC clima\">{{cite web |url=http://www.enciclopedia.cat/enciclop%C3%A8dies/gran-enciclop%C3%A8dia-catalana/EC-GEC-0016439.xml |title=Catalunya: El clima i la hidrografia |language=Catalan|work=l'Enciclop\u00e8dia |location=Barcelona |editor=Gran Enciclopedia Catalana}}{{dead link|date=January 2014}}</ref> In the Pyrenees there are many small lakes, remnants of the [[Quaternary glaciation|ice age]]. The biggest are the [[lake of Banyoles]] and the recently recovered [[lake of Ivars]].\n\nThe Catalan coast is almost rectilinear, with a length of {{convert|580|km}} and few [[landform]]s\u2014the most relevant are the [[Cap de Creus]] and the [[Gulf of Roses]] to the north and the [[Ebro Delta]] to the south. The [[Catalan Coastal Range]] hugs the coastline, and it is split into two segments, one between [[L'Estartit]] and the town of [[Blanes]] (the [[Costa Brava]]), and the other at the south, at the Costes del [[Garraf]].\n\nThe principal [[List of rivers of Catalonia|rivers in Catalonia]] are the [[Ter (river)|Ter]], [[Llobregat]], and the [[Ebro]] (Catalan: {{lang|ca|Ebre}}), all of which run into the [[Mediterranean]].\n\n===Anthropic pressure and protection of nature===\nThe majority of Catalan population is concentrated in 30% of the territory, mainly in the coastal plains. Intensive agriculture, livestock farming and industrial activities have been accompanied by a massive [[Mass tourism|tourist]] influx (more than 20&nbsp;million annual visitors), a rate of urbanization and even of major metropolisation which has led to a strong urban sprawl: a third of Catalans live in the urban area of Barcelona, while the proportion of urbanized soils increased from 4.2% in 1993 to 6.2% in 2009, a growth of 48.6% in sixteen years, complemented with a dense network of transport infrastructure. This is accompanied by a certain agricultural abandonment (decrease of 15% of all areas cultivated in Catalonia between 1993 and 2009) and a global threat to [[natural environment]]. Human activities have also put some animal species at risk, or even led to their disappearance from the territory, like the [[gray wolf]] and probably the [[brown bear]] of the Pyrenees.

The current regional division has its roots in a decree of the Generalitat de Catalunya of 1936, in effect until 1939, when it was suppressed by Franco. In 1987 the Government adopted the territorial division again and in 1988 three new comarques were added ([[Alta Ribagor\u00e7a]], [[Pla d'Urgell]] and [[Pla de l'Estany]]), and in 2015 was created another comarca, the [[Moian\u00e8s]].

A ''El llibre d'or de l'art catal\u00e0''.</ref> (the best examples of which are located in the northern half of the territory) and [[Gothic style]]s. The Gothic developed in Barcelona and its area of influence is known as [[Catalan Gothic]], with some particular characteristics. The church of [[Santa Maria del Mar, Barcelona|Santa Maria del Mar]] is an example of this kind of style. During the Middle Ages, many fortified castles were built by feudal nobles to mark their powers.\n\nThere are some examples of [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] (such as the Palau de la Generalitat), [[Baroque]] and [[Neoclassical architecture]]s. In the late nineteenth century [[Modernisme|Modernism]] ([[Art Nouveau]]) appeared as the national art. The world-renowned Catalan architects of this style are [[Antoni Gaud\u00ed]], [[Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner]] and [[Josep Puig i Cadafalch]]. Thanks to the urban expansion of Barcelona during the last decades of the century and the first ones of the next, many buildings of the [[Eixample]] are modernists.

The first begins with the historiographic chronicles of the 13th century (chronicles written between the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries narrating the deeds of the monarchs and leading figures of the Crown of Aragon) and the subsequent Golden Age of the 14th and 15th centuries. After that period, between the 16th and 19th centuries the Romantic [[historiography]] defined this era as the {{lang|ca|[[Decad\u00e8ncia]]}}, considered as the \"decadent\" period in Catalan literature because of a general falling into disuse of the vernacular language in cultural contexts and lack of patronage among the nobility.\n\n[[File:Rodoreda.jpg|upright=0.6|thumb|left|[[Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda]] ]]\nThe second moment of splendor began in the 19th century with the cultural and political {{lang|ca|[[Renaixen\u00e7a]]}} (Renaissance) represented by writers and poets such as [[Jacint Verdaguer]], [[V\u00edctor Catal\u00e0]] (pseudonym of [[Caterina Albert i Parad\u00eds]]), [[Narc\u00eds Oller]], [[Joan Maragall]] and [[\u00c0ngel Guimer\u00e0]]. During the 20th century, avant-garde movements developed, initiated by the Generation of '14 (called [[Noucentisme]] in Catalonia), represented by [[Eugeni d'Ors]], [[Joan Salvat-Papasseit]], [[Josep Carner]], [[Carles Riba]], [[Josep Vicen\u00e7 Foix i Mas|J.V. Foix]] and others. During the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, the Civil War ([[Generation of '36]]) and the Francoist period, Catalan literature was maintained despite the repression against the Catalan language, being often produced in exile. [[File:Ana Mar\u00eda Matute.jpg|upright=0.6|thumb|[[Ana Mar\u00eda Matute]] ]] The most outstanding authors of this period are [[Salvador Espriu]], [[Josep Pla]], [[Josep Maria de Sagarra]] (the latter three being considered as the main responsible of the renewal of Catalan prose), [[Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda]], Joan Oliver Sallar\u00e8s or \"[[Pere Quart]]\", [[Pere Calders]], [[Gabriel Ferrater]], [[Manuel de Pedrolo]], [[Agust\u00ed Bartra]] or [[Miquel Mart\u00ed i Pol]]. In addition, several foreign writers who fought in the framework of the [[International Brigades]] then recount their experiences of fighting in their works, historical or fictional, with for example ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' of the British [[George Orwell]] in 1938 or {{lang|fr|[[Le Palace (Claude Simon)|Le Palace]]}} in 1962 and ''[[The Georgics (Claude Simon)|The Georgics]]'' in 1981 by Frenchman [[Claude Simon]].\n\nAfter the transition to democracy (1975\u20131978) and the restoration of the Generalitat (1977), literary life and the editorial market have returned to normality and literary production in Catalan is being bolstered with a number of language policies intended to protect Catalan culture. Besides the aforementioned authors, other relevant 20th-century writers of the Francoist and democracy periods include [[Joan Brossa]], [[Agust\u00ed Bartra]], [[Manuel de Pedrolo]], [[Pere Calders]] or [[Quim Monz\u00f3]].\n\n[[Ana Mar\u00eda Matute]], [[Jaime Gil de Biedma]], [[Manuel V\u00e1zquez Montalb\u00e1n]] and [[Juan Goytisolo]] are among the most prominent Catalan writers in the Spanish language since the democratic restoration in Spain.\n\n=== Festivals and public holidays ===\n{{Main|Traditions of Catalonia}}\n[[File:4 de 9 amb folre i pilar.jpg|thumb|Castell 4 de 9 amb folre i pilar by Colla Vella de Valls]]\n\n[[Castell]]s are one of the main manifestations of Catalan popular culture. The activity consists in constructing human towers by competing {{lang|ca|colles castelleres}} (teams). This practice originated in [[Valls]], on the region of the Camp de Tarragona, during the 18th century, and later it was extended along the next two centuries to the rest of the territory. The tradition of [[Castell|els Castells i els Castellers]] was declared Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by [[UNESCO]] in 2010.\n\nIn main celebrations, other elements of the Catalan popular culture are also usually present: parades with {{lang|ca|[[Gegants i capgrossos|gegants]]}} (giants), bigheads, stick-dancers and musicians, and the {{lang|ca|[[correfoc]]}}, where devils and monsters dance and spray showers of sparks using firecrackers. Another traditional celebration in Catalonia is {{lang|ca|[[Patum de Berga|La Patum de Berga]]}}, declared a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by the [[UNESCO]] on 25 November 2005.<ref>[http://www.bergueda.com/lapatum/festa.asp Patum de Berga]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227050231/http://www.bergueda.com/lapatum/festa.asp |date=27 February 2009 }}</ref>\n[[File:Festa major de la Seu d'Urgell.JPG|thumb|left|{{lang|ca|[[Gigantes y cabezudos|Gegants i capgrossos]]}} during the festa major of [[La Seu d'Urgell]] ]]\n\n[[Christmas]] in Catalonia lasts two days, plus [[Christmas Eve]]. On the 25th, Christmas is celebrated, followed by a similar feast on the 26, called Sant Esteve (Saint Steve's Day). This allows families to visit and dine with different sectors of the extended family, or get together with friends on the second day.\n\nOne of the most deeply-rooted and curious [[Christmas traditions]] is the popular figure of the {{lang|ca|[[Ti\u00f3 de Nadal]]}}, consisting of an (often hollow) log with a face painted on it and often two little front legs appended, usually wearing a Catalan hat and scarf. Note that the word has nothing to do with the Spanish word ''t\u00edo'', meaning uncle. ''Ti\u00f3'' means log in Catalan. The log is sometimes \"found in the woods\" (in an event staged for children) and then adopted and taken home, where it is fed and cared for during a month or so. On [[Christmas Day]] or on [[Christmas Eve]], a game is played where children march around the house singing a song requesting the log to poop, then they tap the log gently with a stick, as if a magic wand, to make it poop, and lo and behold, as if through magic, it poops candy, and sometimes other small gifts. Usually the larger or main gifts are brought by the Three Kings on 6 January, and the ti\u00f3 only brings small things.\n \n[[File:Ti\u00f3 de Nadal.jpg|thumb|A ti\u00f3 exhibited at Pla\u00e7a Sant Jaume in Barcelona in the 2010\u20132011 Christmas season.]]\n\nAnother custom is to make a {{lang|ca|pessebre}} (nativity scene) in the home or in shop windows, the latter sometimes competing in originality or shear size and detail. Churches often host exhibits of numerous dioramas by nativity scene makers, or a single nativity scene they put out, and town halls generally put out a nativity scene in the central square. In Barcelona, every year, the main nativity scene is designed by different artists, and often ends up being an interesting, post-modern or conceptual and strange creation. In the home, the nativity scene often consists of strips of cork bark to represent cliffs or mountains in the background, moss as grass in the foreground, some wood chips or other as dirt, and aluminum foil for rivers and lakes. The traditional figurines often included are the three wise men on camels or horses, which are moved every day or so to go closer to the manger, a star with a long tail in the background to lead people to the spot, the annunciation with shepherds having a meal and an angel appearing (hanging from something), a washer lady washing clothes in the pond, sheep, ducks, people carrying packages on their backs, a donkey driver with a load of twigs, and atrezzo such as a starry sky, miniature towns placed in the distance, either Oriental-styled or local-looking, a bridge over the river, trees, etc.\n\nOne of the most astonishing and sui-generis figurines traditionally placed in the nativity scene, to the great glee of children, is the {{lang|ca|[[caganer]]}}, a person depicted in the act of defecating.<ref name=\"BBC News\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12059969|title=A traditional Nativity scene, Catalan-style|work=BBC News |date=23 December 2010|accessdate=23 December 2010}}</ref> This figurine is hidden in some corner of the nativity scene and the game is to detect it. Of course, churches forgo this figurine, and the main nativity scene of Barcelona, for instance, likewise does not feature it. The caganer is so popular it has, together with the ti\u00f3, long been a major part of the Christmas markets, where they come in the guise of your favorite politicians or other famous people, as well as the traditional figures of a Catalan farmer. People often buy a figurine of a caganer in the guise of a famous person they are actually fond of, contrary to what one would imagine, though sometimes people buy a caganer in the guise of someone they dislike, although this means they have to look at them in the home...\n\nAnother (extended) Christmas tradition is the celebration of the Epiphany on 6 January, which is called ''Reis'', meaning Three Kings Day. This is every important in Catalonia and the Catalan-speaking areas, and families go to watch major parades on the eve of the Epiphany, where they can greet the kings and watch them pass by in pomp and circumstance, on floats and preceded and followed by pages, musicians, dancers, etc. They often give the kings letters with their gift requests, which are collected by the pages. On the next day, the children find the gifts the three kings brought for them.\n\nIn addition to traditional local Catalan culture, traditions from other parts of Spain can be found as a result of migration from other regions, for instance the celebration of the Andalusian {{lang|es|[[Seville Fair|Feria de Abril]]}} in Catalonia.\n\nOn 28 July 2010, second only after the [[Canary Islands]], [[Ban on bullfighting in Catalonia|Catalonia became another Spanish territory to forbid bullfighting]]. The ban, which went into effect on 1 January 2012, had originated in a popular petition supported by over 180,000 signatures.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Tremlett|first1=Giles|title=Catalonia votes to ban bullfighting|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/28/bullfighting-ban-spain-catalonia|accessdate=11 October 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=28 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Music and dance ===\n{{Main|Music of Catalonia}}\n[[File:Sardanes.jpg|thumb|[[Sardana]]]]\n\nThe [[sardana]] is considered to be the most characteristic Catalan folk dance, interpreted to the rhythm of [[Tambori|tambor\u00ed]], [[tible]] and [[tenora]] (from the oboe family), [[trumpet]], tromb\u00f3 ([[trombone]]), fiscorn (family of bugles) and contrabaix with three strings played by a [[cobla]], and are danced in a circle dance. Other tunes and dances of the traditional music are the contrap\u00e0s (obsolete today), [[ball de bastons]] (the \"dance of sticks\"), the moixiganga, the goigs (popular songs), the [[galop]]s or the [[Jota (music)|jota]] in the southern part. The [[Habanera (music)|havaneres]] are characteristic in some marine localities of the Costa Brava, especially during the summer months when these songs are sung outdoors accompanied by a {{lang|ca|cremat}} of burned rum.\n\nArt music was first developed, up to the nineteenth century and, as in much of Europe, in a liturgical setting, particularly marked by the Escolania de Montserrat. The main Western musical trends have marked these productions, medieval monodies or polyphonies, with the work of [[Abbot Oliba]] in the eleventh century or the compilation [[Llibre Vermell de Montserrat]] (\"Red Book of Montserrat\") from the fourteenth century. Through the Renaissance there were authors such as [[Pere Albert Vila]], [[Joan Brudieu]] or the two [[Mateu Fletxa]] (\"The Old\" and \"The Young\"). Baroque had composers like [[Joan Cererols]]. The Romantic music was represented by composers such as [[Fernando Sor]], [[Josep Anselm Clav\u00e9]] (father of choir movement in Catalonia and responsible of the music folk reviving) or [[Felip Pedrell]].\n\nModernisme also expressed in musical terms from the end of the 19th century onwards, mixing folkloric and post-romantic influences, through the works of [[Isaac Alb\u00e9niz]] and [[Enric Granados]]. The avant-garde spirit initiated by the modernists is prolonged throughout the twentieth century, thanks to the activities of the [[Orfe\u00f3 Catal\u00e0]], a choral society founded in 1891, with its monumental concert hall, the [[Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana]] in Catalan, built by Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner from 1905 to 1908, the [[Barcelona Symphony Orchestra]] created in 1944 and composers, conductors and musicians engaged against the Francoism like [[Robert Gerhard]], [[Eduard Toldr\u00e0]] and [[Pau Casals]].\n\nPerformances of [[opera]], mostly imported from Italy, began in the 18th century, but some native operas were written as well, including the ones by [[Dom\u00e8nec Terradellas]], [[Carles Baguer]], [[Ramon Carles]], Isaac Alb\u00e9niz and Enric Granados. The Barcelona main opera house, [[Gran Teatre del Liceu]] (opened in 1847), remains one of the most important in Spain, hosting one of the most prestigious music schools in Barcelona, the [[Conservatori Superior de M\u00fasica del Liceu]]. Several lyrical artists trained by this institution gained international renown during the 20th century, such as [[Victoria de los \u00c1ngeles]], [[Montserrat Caball\u00e9]], [[Giacomo Aragall]] and [[Josep Carreras]].\n\nCellist [[Pau Casals]] is admired as an outstanding player.

In Catalonia there is a wide variety of local and comarcal media. With the restoration of democracy, many newspapers and magazines, until then in the hands of the Franco government, were recovered in order to convert them into free and democratic media, while local radios and televisions were implemented.\n\n[[Televisi\u00f3 de Catalunya]], which broadcasts entirely in the Catalan language, is the main Catalan public TV. It has five channels: [[TV3 (Catalonia)|TV3]], [[El 33]]/[[Super3]], [[3/24]], [[Esport3]] and [[TV3CAT]].

First, auteur cinema, in the continuity of the [[Barcelona School of Film|Barcelona School]], emphasizes experimentation and form, while focusing on developing social and political themes. Worn first by [[Josep Maria Forn]] or [[Bigas Luna]], then by [[Marc Recha]], [[Jaime Rosales]] and [[Albert Serra]], this genre has achieved some international recognition. Then, the [[documentary]] became another genre particularly representative of contemporary Catalan cinema, boosted by [[Joaquim Jord\u00e0 i Catal\u00e0]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Guer\u00edn]]. Later, horror films and thrillers have also emerged as a specialty of the Catalan film industry, thanks in particular to the vitality of the [[Sitges Film Festival]], created in 1968. Several directors have gained worldwide renown thanks to this genre, starting with Jaume Balaguer\u00f3 and his series ''[[REC (film)|REC]]'' (co-directed with Valencian Paco Plaza), [[Juan Antonio Bayona]] and ''[[El orfanato|El Orfanato]]'' or [[Jaume Collet-Serra]] with ''[[Orphan (2009 film)|Orphan]]'', ''[[Unknown (2011 film)|Unknown]]'' and ''[[Non-Stop (film)|Non-Stop]]''.\n\nCatalan actors have shot for Spanish and international productions, such as [[Sergi L\u00f3pez (actor)|Sergi L\u00f3pez]].\n\nThe [[Museum of Cinema - Tom\u00e0s Mallol Collection]] (Museu del Cinema - Col.lecci\u00f3 Tom\u00e0s Mallol in Catalan) of Girona is home of important permanent exhibitions of cinema and pre-cinema objects. Other important institutions for the promotion of cinema are the [[Gaud\u00ed Awards]] (Premis Gaud\u00ed in Catalan, which replaced from 2009 Barcelona Film Awards themselves created in 2002), serving as equivalent for Catalonia to the Spanish [[Goya Awards|Goya]] or French [[C\u00e9sar Award|C\u00e9sar]].\n\n=== Philosophy ===\n{{See also|Seny}}\n{{lang|ca|Seny}} is a form of ancestral Catalan wisdom or sensibleness. It involves well-pondered perception of situations, level-headedness, awareness, integrity, and right action.

The [[Circuit de Catalunya]], built in 1991, is one of the main motorsport venues, holding the Catalan motorcycle Grand Prix, the Spanish F1 Grand Prix, a DTM race, and several other races.\n\nCatalonia hosted many relevant international sport events, such as the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in Barcelona, and also the [[1955 Mediterranean Games]], the [[2013 World Aquatics Championships]] or the [[2018 Mediterranean Games]].

In the later Middle Ages, [[Catalan literature]] flourished. During the last Medieval centuries natural disasters, social turmoils and military conflicts affected the Principality. Between 1469 and 1516, the [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|king]] of [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] and the [[Isabella I of Castile|queen]] of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] were married and ruled their realms together, retaining all of their distinct institutions and legislation.\n\nDuring the [[Franco-Spanish War (1635\u201359)|Franco-Spanish War]] (1635\u20131659), [[Reapers' War|Catalonia revolted]] (1640\u20131652) against a large and burdensome presence of the royal army in its territory, being briefly proclaimed a [[Catalan Republic (1641)|republic]] under French protection. Within a brief period France took full control of Catalonia, until it was largely reconquered by the Spanish army. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] in 1659, the [[Spanish Crown]] ceded the northern parts of Catalonia, mostly the [[County of Roussillon]], to France. During the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701\u20131714), the Crown of Aragon sided against the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] [[Philip V of Spain]]; following Catalan defeat on 11 September 1714, Philip V, inspired by the model of France imposed a unifying administration across Spain, enacting the [[Nueva Planta decrees]], suppressing the main Catalan institutions and rights like in the other realms of the Crown of Aragon. This led to the eclipse of Catalan as a language of government and literature, replaced by Spanish. Throughout the 18th century, Catalonia experienced economic growth, reinforced in the late quarter of the century when the Castile's trade monopoly with American colonies ended.\n\nIn the 19th century, Catalonia was severely affected by the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic]] and [[Carlist Wars]]. In the second third of the century, Catalonia experienced significant industrialisation. As wealth from the industrial expansion grew, Catalonia saw a [[Renaixen\u00e7a|cultural renaissance]] coupled with incipient [[Catalan nationalism|nationalism]] while several workers movements appeared. In 1914, the four Catalan provinces formed a [[Commonwealth of Catalonia|commonwealth]], and with the return of democracy during the [[Second Spanish Republic]] (1931\u20131939), the [[Generalitat de Catalunya|Generalitat of Catalonia]] was restored as an autonomous government. After the [[Spanish Civil War]], the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist]] dictatorship enacted repressive measures, abolishing Catalan self-government and banning the official use of the Catalan language again. After a first period of [[autarky]], from the late 1950s through to the 1970s Catalonia saw [[Spanish miracle|rapid economic growth]], drawing many workers from across Spain, making Barcelona one of Europe's largest industrial metropolitan areas and turning Catalonia into a major tourist destination. Since the [[Spanish transition to democracy]] (1975\u20131982), Catalonia has regained considerable autonomy in political, educational, environmental, and cultural affairs and is now one of the most economically dynamic communities of Spain. In the 2010s there has been growing support for [[Catalan independence movement|Catalan independence]]. On 27 October 2017, the Catalan Parliament declared unilaterally independence from Spain following a [[2017 Catalan independence referendum|disputed referendum]]. The Spanish Senate voted in favour of enforcing direct rule by removing the entire Catalan government and calling [[2017 Catalan regional election|a snap regional election for 21 December]]. On 2 November of the same year, the Spanish Supreme Court imprisoned seven former ministers of the Catalan government on charges of rebellion and misuse of public funds, while several others\u2014including then-President of Catalonia, [[Carles Puigdemont]]\u2014fled to other European countries (such as Belgium, in Puigdemont's case).\n\n== Etymology and pronunciation ==\nThe name Catalonia\u2014''Catalunya'' in Catalan, spelled ''Cathalonia'', or ''Cathalaunia'' in [[Medieval Latin]]\u2014began to be used for the homeland of the [[Catalans]] (''Cathalanenses'') in the late 11th century and was probably used before as a territorial reference to the group of counties that comprised part of the March of Gothia and [[Marca Hispanica|March of Hispania]] under the control of the [[Count of Barcelona]] and his relatives.<ref>[http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0016436 Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana online: Catalunya (\"Geral de Cataluign, Raimundi Catalan and Arnal Catalan appear in 1107/1112\")] (in Catalan) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206211826/http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0016436 |date=6 February 2012 }}</ref> The origin of the name ''Catalunya'' is subject to diverse interpretations because of a lack of evidence.\n\nOne theory suggests that ''Catalunya'' derives from the name ''Gothia'' (or ''Gauthia'') ''Launia'' (\"Land of the [[Goths]]\"), since the origins of the Catalan counts, lords and people were found in the March of Gothia, known as ''Gothia'', whence ''Gothland'' > ''Gothlandia'' > ''Gothalania'' > ''Cathalaunia'' > ''Catalonia'' theoretically derived.<ref name=\"Books.google.com\"/><ref>{{cite book| author = Ulick Ralph Burke| title = A history of Spain from the earliest times to the death of Ferdinand the Catholic| url = https://archive.org/details/ahistoryspainfr02burkgoog| year = 1900| publisher = Longmans, Green, and co.| page = [https://archive.org/details/ahistoryspainfr02burkgoog/page/n187 154]}}</ref> During the [[Middle Ages]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] chroniclers claimed that ''Catalania'' derives from the local medley of [[Goths]] with [[Alans]], initially constituting a ''Goth-Alania''.<ref>The Sarmatians: 600 BC-AD 450 (Men-at-Arms) by Richard Brzezinski and Gerry Embleton, 19 August 2002.</ref>\n\nOther less plausible or recent theories suggest:\n\n* ''Catalunya'' derives from the term \"land of castles\", having evolved from the term ''castl\u00e0'' or ''castlan'', the medieval term for a [[castellan]] (a ruler of a [[castle]]).<ref name=\"Books.google.com\">{{cite book| author = Maximiano Garc\u00eda Venero| title = Historia del nacionalismo catal\u00e1n: 2a edici\u00f3n| url = https://books.google.com/?id=nUABAAAAMAAJ| accessdate = 25 April 2010| date = 7 July 2006| publisher = Ed.

The Iberians of this area \u2013 the [[Ilergetes]], [[Indigetes]] and [[Lacetani]] (Cerretains) \u2013 also maintained relations with the peoples of the Mediterranean. Some urban agglomerations became relevant, including Ilerda (Lleida) inland, Hibera (perhaps [[Amposta]] or [[Tortosa]]) or Indika ([[Ullastret]]). Coastal trading colonies were established by the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], who settled around the [[Gulf of Roses]], in Emporion ([[Emp\u00faries]]) and [[Roses, Girona|Roses]] in the [[Colonies in antiquity|8th century BC]]. The [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] briefly ruled the territory in the course of the [[Second Punic War]] and traded with [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|the surrounding Iberian population]].\n\nAfter the Carthaginian defeat by the [[Roman Republic]], the north-east of Iberia became the first to come under Roman rule and became part of [[Hispania]], the westernmost part of the [[Roman Empire]]. [[Tarraco (Tarragona)|Tarraco]] (modern [[Tarragona]]) was one of the most important Roman cities in Hispania and the capital of the [[Roman province|province]] of [[Tarraconensis]]. Other important cities of the Roman period are Ilerda (Lleida), Dertosa (Tortosa), Gerunda (Girona) as well as the ports of Empuri\u00e6 (former Emporion) and Barcino (Barcelona). As for the rest of Hispania, [[Latin law]] was granted to all cities under the reign of [[Vespasian]] (69-79 AD), while [[Roman citizenship]] was granted to all free men of the empire by the [[Edict of Caracalla|Edict of]] [[Caracalla]] in 212 AD (Tarraco, the capital, was already a colony of [[Roman law]] since 45 BC). It was a rich agricultural province (olive oil, vine, [[wheat]]), and the first centuries of the Empire saw the construction of roads (the most important being the [[Via Augusta]], parallel to Mediterranean coastline) and infrastructure like [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueducts]].\n\nConversion to [[Christianity]], attested in the 3rd century, was completed in urban areas in the 4th century. Although Hispania remained under Roman rule and did not fall under the rule of [[Vandals]], [[Swabians]] and [[Alans]] in the 5th century, the main cities suffered frequent sacking and some [[deurbanization]].\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\n[[File:Origen de l'escut del comtat de Barcelona de Lorenzale.jpg|thumb|left|''Origins of the blason of the County of Barcelona'', by [[Claudi Lorenzale]] ]]\nAfter the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the area was conquered by the [[Visigoths]] and was ruled as part of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] for almost two and a half centuries. In 718, it came under [[Muslim]] control and became part of [[Al-Andalus]], a province of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. From the conquest of Roussillon in 760, to the conquest of Barcelona in 801, the [[Frankish empire]] took control of the area between Septimania and the [[Llobregat]] river from the Muslims and created heavily militarised, self-governing [[county|counties]]. These counties formed part of the [[Septimania|Gothic]] and [[Spanish March|Hispanic]] marches, a [[buffer zone]] in the south of the Frankish empire in the former province of Septimania and in the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula, to act as a defensive barrier for the Frankish empire against further Muslim invasions from Al-Andalus.\n[[File:Petronila Ramon Berenguer.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Petronilla of Aragon]] and [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona]], dynastic union of the [[Crown of Aragon]]]]\nThese counties came under the rule of the [[Count of Barcelona|counts of Barcelona]], who were Frankish [[vassal]]s nominated by the emperor of the Franks, to whom they were [[feudatory|feudatories]] (801\u2013987). The earliest known use of the name \"[[Principality of Catalonia|Catalonia]]\" for these counties dates to 1117.

In 1137, [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona]] decided to accept [[Ramiro II of Aragon|King Ramiro II of Aragon]]'s proposal to marry Queen [[Petronilla of Aragon|Petronila]], establishing the dynastic union of the County of Barcelona with the [[Kingdom of Aragon]], joining the [[Crown of Aragon]] and making the Catalan counties that were united under the county of Barcelona into a [[principality]] of the Aragonese Crown.\n\nIn 1258, by means of the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1258)|Treaty of Corbeil]], [[James I of Aragon]] King of Aragon and [[Count of Barcelona]] , of Mallorca and of Valencia, renounced his family rights and dominions in [[Occitania]] and recognised the king of France as heir of the [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian Dynasty]]. The king of France formally relinquished his nominal feudal lordship over all the Catalan counties, except the [[County of Foix]], despite the opposition of the king of Aragon and count of Barcelona. This treaty transformed the principality's ''[[de facto]]'' union with Aragon into a ''[[de jure]]'' one and was the origin of the definitive separation between the geographical areas of Catalonia and [[Languedoc]].\n\nAs a coastal territory, Catalonia became the base of the Aragonese Crown's maritime forces, which spread the power of the Aragonese Crown in the Mediterranean, and made Barcelona into a powerful and wealthy city. In the period of 1164\u20131410, new territories, the [[Kingdom of Valencia]], the [[Kingdom of Majorca]], [[Sardinia]], the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], [[Corsica]], and (briefly) the [[Duchy|Duchies]] of [[Duchy of Athens|Athens]] and [[Duchy of Neopatras|Neopatras]], were incorporated into the dynastic domains of the [[House of Aragon]].\n\nAt the same time, the Principality of Catalonia developed a complex institutional and political system based in the concept of a pact between the [[estates of the realm]] and the king.

Charles II had chosen [[Philip V of Spain]] from the French [[House of Bourbon]]. Catalonia, like other territories that formed the Crown of Aragon, rose up in support of the Austrian Habsburg pretender [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor]], in his claim for the Spanish throne as Charles III of Spain. The fight between the houses of Bourbon and Habsburg for the Spanish Crown split Spain and Europe.\n\nThe [[Siege of Barcelona (1713\u201314)|fall of Barcelona]] on 11 September 1714 to the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] king [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] militarily ended the Habsburg claim to the Spanish Crown, which became legal fact in the [[Treaty of Utrecht]]. Philip felt that he had been betrayed by the Catalan Courts, as it had initially sworn its loyalty to him when he had presided over it in 1701. In retaliation for the betrayal, the first Bourbon king introduced the [[Nueva Planta decrees]] that incorporated the territories of the Crown of Aragon, including Catalonia, as provinces under the Crown of Castile in 1716, terminating their separate institutions, laws and rights, within a united kingdom of Spain.<ref>Mercader, J. ''Felip V i Catalunya''.

In 1808 it was occupied by the French troops, the resistance against the occupation eventually developed into the [[Peninsular War]]. The rejection to French dominion was institutionalized with the creation of \"juntas\" (councils) who, remaining loyal to the Bourbons, exercised the sovereignty and representation of the territory due to the disappearance of the old institutions. Napoleon took direct control of Catalonia to establish order, creating the Government of Catalonia under the rule of [[Marshall Augereau]], and making Catalan briefly an official language again. Between 1812 and 1814 Catalonia was annexed to France and organized as four [[French departments of Spain|d\u00e9partements]].<ref>''[http://www.histoire-empire.org/departements/france_modifications.htm Les modifications int\u00e9rieures de la France]''</ref> The French troops evacuated Catalan territory at the end of 1814. After the Bourbon restoration in Spain and the death of the abolutist king [[Ferdinand VII]], [[Carlist Wars]] erupted against the new born [[Liberalism|liberal state]] of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]]. Catalonia was divided, the coast and most industrialized areas support liberalism, while many inland areas were in the hands of [[Carlism|Carlists]], as the last ones proposed to reestablish the institutional systems suppressed in the Nueva Planta decrees in all the ancient realms of the Crown of Aragon.\n\n[[File:Semana tragica.jpg|thumb|left|Demonstration after the [[Tragic Week (Catalonia)|Tragic Week]], 1909]]\nIn the second third of the 19th century, it became an industrial center. This process was boosted by, amongst other things, national {{ill|protectionist laws|es|Ley de Relaciones Comerciales con las Antillas|vertical-align=sup}} (although the policy of the Spanish government during those times changed many times between free trade and protectionism) and the conditions of proto-industrialization of the prior two centuries of the Catalan urban areas and its countryside. Along the century, textile industry flourished in urban areas and in the countryside, usually in the form of [[company towns]]. To this day it remains one of the most industrialised areas of Spain. In 1832 it was inaugurated in Barcelona the factory Bonaplata, the first of the country which worked with [[steam engine]]. During those years, Barcelona was the focus of important revolutionary uprisings, called \"bullangues\", causing a difficult relation between many sectors of Catalan society and the central government and, in Catalonia, a [[republicanism|republican]] current began to develop; also, inevitably, many Catalans favored a more federal Spain. Meanwhile, the Catalan language saw a cultural renaissance (the ''[[Renaixen\u00e7a]]'') at popular and bourgeois level. After the fall of the [[First Spanish Republic]] and the restoration of the Bourbon dynasty (1874), Catalan nationalism grew in importance.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-11543, Madrid, Ausrufung der Zweiten Spanischen Republik.jpg|thumb|Proclamation of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] on 14 April 1931 in Barcelona]]\nThe Anarchists had been active throughout the early 20th century, founding the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] trade union and achieving one of the first [[eight-hour day|eight-hour workday]] in Europe in 1919.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Revolutionary Left in Spain, 1914-1923|last=Meaker|first=Gerald H.|date=1974|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RM6rAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA158&ei=pM08S_DvJJe2NIXjnL4B&cd=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false 159] ff|isbn=0-8047-0845-2}}</ref> Growing resentment of conscription and of the military culminated in the [[Tragic Week (Catalonia)|Tragic Week]] in Barcelona in 1909.

The populated areas lying by the coast in Tarragona, Barcelona and Girona provinces feature a [[Hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Csa''). The inland part (including the Lleida province and the inner part of Barcelona province) show a mostly [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Csa'').

Winter is cool or slightly cold depending on the location. It snows frequently in the Pyrenees, and it occasionally snows at lower altitudes, even by the coastline. Spring and autumn are typically the rainiest seasons, except for the Pyrenean valleys, where summer is typically stormy.\n\nThe inland part of Catalonia is hotter and drier in summer. Temperature may reach {{convert|35|\u00b0C}}, some days even {{convert|40|\u00b0C}}. Nights are cooler there than at the coast, with the temperature of around {{convert|14|-|17|\u00b0C}}.

The [[geography]] is conditioned by the Mediterranean coast, with {{convert|580|km|mi|abbr=off}} of coastline, and large relief units of the Pyrenees to the north. The Catalan territory is divided into three main geomorphological units:<ref>{{cite web|title=Geological map of Catalonia|url=http://www.icgc.cat/en/Public-Administration-and-Enterprises/Downloads/Geological-and-geothematic-cartography/Geological-mapping/Geological-map-of-Catalonia-1-50.000|publisher=Institut Cartogr\u00e0fic i Geol\u00f2gic de Catalunya|accessdate=11 October 2017|date=2016}}</ref>\n\n* The Pyrenees: mountainous formation that connects the Iberian Peninsula with the [[Continental Europe|European continental territory]], and located in the north of Catalonia;\n* The Catalan Coastal mountain ranges or the Catalan Mediterranean System: an alternating delevacions and planes parallel to the Mediterranean coast;\n* The [[Catalan Central Depression]]: structural unit which forms the eastern sector of the Valley of the Ebro.\n\n[[File:2012 Montserrat.jpg|thumb|left|Mountain of [[Montserrat (mountain)|Montserrat]] and the [[Santa Maria de Montserrat Abbey|monastery]]]]\nThe Catalan Pyrenees represent almost half in length of the Pyrenees, as it extends more than {{convert|200|km|abbr=off}}. Traditionally differentiated the Axial Pyrenees (the main part) and the [[Pre-Pyrenees]] (southern from the Axial) which are mountainous formations parallel to the main mountain ranges but with lower altitudes, less steep and a different geological formation. The highest mountain of Catalonia, located north of the comarca of Pallars Sobir\u00e0 is the Pica d'Estats (3,143&nbsp;m), followed by the Puigpedr\u00f3s (2,914&nbsp;m). On the Pre-Pyrenees is located the [[Serra del Cad\u00ed]], that separates the valley of [[Cerdanya]] from the Central Depression.\n\nCentral Catalan Depression is a plain located between the Pyrenees and Pre-Coastal Mountains. The Depression lands are located between {{convert|200|and|600|m|ft|abbr=off}}. The plains and the water that descend from the Pyrenees have made it fertile territory for [[agriculture]] and there are built numerous irrigation canals. Other important plain is the [[Empord\u00e0]], located on the northeast.\n\nThe Catalan Mediterranean system is based on two (more or less) parallel ranges to the coast, in a Northwest direction towards the Southwest. These two mountain ranges are the Coastal and the Pre-Coastal. The Coastal Range is minor extent and it has lower altitudes, while the Pre-Coastal is larger in both length and height. The most relevant mountains of this area are [[Montserrat (mountain)|Montserrat]], [[Montseny Massif|Montseny]] and [[Ports de Tortosa-Beseit|Ports]]. Within the ranges are a series of plains, the entities over which form the Coastal and the Pre-Coastal Depressions. The Coastal Depression is located on the East of the Coastal Range towards the coast. The Pre-Coastal, on the other hand, is located in the interior, between the two mountain ranges, and constitutes the basis of the plains of [[Vall\u00e8s]] and [[Pened\u00e8s]].\n\n=== Flora and fauna ===\n[[File:BennyTrapp Montseny-Gebirgsmolch Calotriton arnoldi Montseny-Gebirge Spanien.jpg|thumb|Montseny brook newt (''[[Calotriton arnoldi]]''), [[endemic]] to the [[Montseny Massif]]]]\nCatalonia is a showcase of European [[landscapes]] on a small scale.

The area is of great ecological diversity and a remarkable wealth of landscapes, habitats and species.\n\nThe fauna of Catalonia comprises a minority of animals endemic to the region and a majority of non-native animals. Much of Catalonia enjoys a Mediterranean climate (except mountain areas), which makes many of the animals that live there adapted to Mediterranean ecosystems. Of mammals, there are plentiful [[wild boar]], red foxes, as well as [[roe deer]] and in the Pyrenees, the [[Pyrenean chamois]]. Other large species such as the [[bear]] have been recently reintroduced.\n\nWaters of [[Balearic Sea]] are rich in biodiversity, and even the [[megafauna]]s of ocean; various type of whales (such as [[fin whale|fin]], [[sperm whale|sperm]], and [[long-finned pilot whale|pilot]]) and [[dolphin]]s live within the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edmaktub.org/en/home-2/|title=EDMAKTUB I Estudio de cet\u00e1ceos|website=www.edmaktub.org}}</ref><ref>Casinos A.

The Catalan hydrographic network consists of two important basins, the one of the [[Ebro]] and the one that comprises the internal basins of Catalonia (respectively covering 46.84% and 51.43% of the territory), all of them flow to the [[Mediterranean]]. Furthermore, there is the [[Garona]] river basin that flows to the [[Atlantic Ocean]], but it only covers 1.73% of the Catalan territory.\n\nThe hydrographic network can be divided in two sectors, an occidental slope or Ebro river slope and one oriental slope constituted by minor rivers that flow to the Mediterranean along the Catalan coast. The first slope provides an average of {{convert|18700|hm3|cumi|lk=on|abbr=off}} per year, while the second only provides an average of {{convert|2020|hm3|cumi|abbr=on}}/year. The difference is due to the big contribution of the Ebro river, from which the [[Segre (river)|Segre]] is an important tributary. Moreover, in Catalonia there is a relative wealth of groundwaters, although there is inequality between ''[[comarca|comarques]]'', given the complex geological structure of the territory.<ref name=\"GEC clima\">{{cite web |url=http://www.enciclopedia.cat/enciclop%C3%A8dies/gran-enciclop%C3%A8dia-catalana/EC-GEC-0016439.xml |title=Catalunya: El clima i la hidrografia |language=Catalan|work=l'Enciclop\u00e8dia |location=Barcelona |editor=Gran Enciclopedia Catalana}}{{dead link|date=January 2014}}</ref> In the Pyrenees there are many small lakes, remnants of the [[Quaternary glaciation|ice age]]. The biggest are the [[lake of Banyoles]] and the recently recovered [[lake of Ivars]].\n\nThe Catalan coast is almost rectilinear, with a length of {{convert|580|km}} and few [[landform]]s\u2014the most relevant are the [[Cap de Creus]] and the [[Gulf of Roses]] to the north and the [[Ebro Delta]] to the south. The [[Catalan Coastal Range]] hugs the coastline, and it is split into two segments, one between [[L'Estartit]] and the town of [[Blanes]] (the [[Costa Brava]]), and the other at the south, at the Costes del [[Garraf]].\n\nThe principal [[List of rivers of Catalonia|rivers in Catalonia]] are the [[Ter (river)|Ter]], [[Llobregat]], and the [[Ebro]] (Catalan: {{lang|ca|Ebre}}), all of which run into the [[Mediterranean]].\n\n===Anthropic pressure and protection of nature===\nThe majority of Catalan population is concentrated in 30% of the territory, mainly in the coastal plains. Intensive agriculture, livestock farming and industrial activities have been accompanied by a massive [[Mass tourism|tourist]] influx (more than 20 million annual visitors), a rate of urbanization and even of major metropolisation which has led to a strong urban sprawl: a third of Catalans live in the urban area of Barcelona, while the proportion of urbanized soils increased from 4.2% in 1993 to 6.2% in 2009, a growth of 48.6% in sixteen years, complemented with a dense network of transport infrastructure. This is accompanied by a certain agricultural abandonment (decrease of 15% of all areas cultivated in Catalonia between 1993 and 2009) and a global threat to [[natural environment]]. Human activities have also put some animal species at risk, or even led to their disappearance from the territory, like the [[gray wolf]] and probably the [[brown bear]] of the Pyrenees. The pressure created by this model of life means that the country's [[ecological footprint]] exceeds its administrative area.<ref>{{in lang|ca}} [http://www.gencat.cat/mediamb/publicacions/monografies/bd_conservacio/bd_catalunya_ca_basic.pdf ''Biodiversitat a Catalunya'', Generalitat de Catalunya] Retrieved 29 July 2017.</ref>\n\nFaced with this problems, Catalan authorities initiated several measures whose purpose is to protect natural ecosystems. Thus, in 1990, the Catalan government created the Nature Conservation Council (Catalan: {{lang|ca|Consell de Protecci\u00f3 de la Natura}}), an advisory body with the aim to study, protect and manage the natural environments and landscapes of Catalonia.

The current regional division has its roots in a decree of the Generalitat de Catalunya of 1936, in effect until 1939, when it was suppressed by Franco. In 1987 the Government adopted the territorial division again and in 1988 three new comarques were added ([[Alta Ribagor\u00e7a]], [[Pla d'Urgell]] and [[Pla de l'Estany]]), and in 2015 was created another comarca, the [[Moian\u00e8s]].

A ''El llibre d'or de l'art catal\u00e0''.</ref> (the best examples of which are located in the northern half of the territory) and [[Gothic style]]s. The Gothic developed in Barcelona and its area of influence is known as [[Catalan Gothic]], with some particular characteristics. The church of [[Santa Maria del Mar, Barcelona|Santa Maria del Mar]] is an example of this kind of style. During the Middle Ages, many fortified castles were built by feudal nobles to mark their powers.\n\nThere are some examples of [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] (such as the Palau de la Generalitat), [[Baroque]] and [[Neoclassical architecture]]s. In the late nineteenth century [[Modernisme|Modernism]] ([[Art Nouveau]]) appeared as the national art. The world-renowned Catalan architects of this style are [[Antoni Gaud\u00ed]], [[Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner]] and [[Josep Puig i Cadafalch]]. Thanks to the urban expansion of Barcelona during the last decades of the century and the first ones of the next, many buildings of the [[Eixample]] are modernists.

The first begins with the historiographic chronicles of the 13th century (chronicles written between the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries narrating the deeds of the monarchs and leading figures of the Crown of Aragon) and the subsequent Golden Age of the 14th and 15th centuries. After that period, between the 16th and 19th centuries the Romantic [[historiography]] defined this era as the {{lang|ca|[[Decad\u00e8ncia]]}}, considered as the \"decadent\" period in Catalan literature because of a general falling into disuse of the vernacular language in cultural contexts and lack of patronage among the nobility.\n\n[[File:Rodoreda.jpg|upright=0.6|thumb|left|[[Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda]] ]]\nThe second moment of splendor began in the 19th century with the cultural and political {{lang|ca|[[Renaixen\u00e7a]]}} (Renaissance) represented by writers and poets such as [[Jacint Verdaguer]], [[V\u00edctor Catal\u00e0]] (pseudonym of [[Caterina Albert i Parad\u00eds]]), [[Narc\u00eds Oller]], [[Joan Maragall]] and [[\u00c0ngel Guimer\u00e0]]. During the 20th century, avant-garde movements developed, initiated by the Generation of '14 (called [[Noucentisme]] in Catalonia), represented by [[Eugeni d'Ors]], [[Joan Salvat-Papasseit]], [[Josep Carner]], [[Carles Riba]], [[Josep Vicen\u00e7 Foix i Mas|J.V. Foix]] and others. During the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, the Civil War ([[Generation of '36]]) and the Francoist period, Catalan literature was maintained despite the repression against the Catalan language, being often produced in exile. [[File:Ana Mar\u00eda Matute.jpg|upright=0.6|thumb|[[Ana Mar\u00eda Matute]] ]] The most outstanding authors of this period are [[Salvador Espriu]], [[Josep Pla]], [[Josep Maria de Sagarra]] (the latter three being considered as the main responsible of the renewal of Catalan prose), [[Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda]], Joan Oliver Sallar\u00e8s or \"[[Pere Quart]]\", [[Pere Calders]], [[Gabriel Ferrater]], [[Manuel de Pedrolo]], [[Agust\u00ed Bartra]] or [[Miquel Mart\u00ed i Pol]]. In addition, several foreign writers who fought in the framework of the [[International Brigades]] then recount their experiences of fighting in their works, historical or fictional, with for example ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' of the British [[George Orwell]] in 1938 or {{lang|fr|[[Le Palace (Claude Simon)|Le Palace]]}} in 1962 and ''[[The Georgics (Claude Simon)|The Georgics]]'' in 1981 by Frenchman [[Claude Simon]].\n\nAfter the transition to democracy (1975\u20131978) and the restoration of the Generalitat (1977), literary life and the editorial market have returned to normality and literary production in Catalan is being bolstered with a number of language policies intended to protect Catalan culture. Besides the aforementioned authors, other relevant 20th-century writers of the Francoist and democracy periods include [[Joan Brossa]], [[Agust\u00ed Bartra]], [[Manuel de Pedrolo]], [[Pere Calders]] or [[Quim Monz\u00f3]].\n\n[[Ana Mar\u00eda Matute]], [[Jaime Gil de Biedma]], [[Manuel V\u00e1zquez Montalb\u00e1n]] and [[Juan Goytisolo]] are among the most prominent Catalan writers in the Spanish language since the democratic restoration in Spain.\n\n=== Festivals and public holidays ===\n{{Main|Traditions of Catalonia}}\n[[File:4 de 9 amb folre i pilar.jpg|thumb|Castell 4 de 9 amb folre i pilar by Colla Vella de Valls]]\n\n[[Castell]]s are one of the main manifestations of Catalan popular culture. The activity consists in constructing human towers by competing {{lang|ca|colles castelleres}} (teams). This practice originated in [[Valls]], on the region of the Camp de Tarragona, during the 18th century, and later it was extended along the next two centuries to the rest of the territory. The tradition of [[Castell|els Castells i els Castellers]] was declared Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by [[UNESCO]] in 2010.\n\nIn main celebrations, other elements of the Catalan popular culture are also usually present: parades with {{lang|ca|[[Gegants i capgrossos|gegants]]}} (giants), bigheads, stick-dancers and musicians, and the {{lang|ca|[[correfoc]]}}, where devils and monsters dance and spray showers of sparks using firecrackers. Another traditional celebration in Catalonia is {{lang|ca|[[Patum de Berga|La Patum de Berga]]}}, declared a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by the [[UNESCO]] on 25 November 2005.<ref>[http://www.bergueda.com/lapatum/festa.asp Patum de Berga]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227050231/http://www.bergueda.com/lapatum/festa.asp |date=27 February 2009 }}</ref>\n[[File:Festa major de la Seu d'Urgell.JPG|thumb|left|{{lang|ca|[[Gigantes y cabezudos|Gegants i capgrossos]]}} during the festa major of [[La Seu d'Urgell]] ]]\n\n[[Christmas]] in Catalonia lasts two days, plus [[Christmas Eve]]. On the 25th, Christmas is celebrated, followed by a similar feast on the 26, called Sant Esteve (Saint Steve's Day). This allows families to visit and dine with different sectors of the extended family, or get together with friends on the second day.\n\nOne of the most deeply-rooted and curious [[Christmas traditions]] is the popular figure of the {{lang|ca|[[Ti\u00f3 de Nadal]]}}, consisting of an (often hollow) log with a face painted on it and often two little front legs appended, usually wearing a Catalan hat and scarf. Note that the word has nothing to do with the Spanish word ''t\u00edo'', meaning uncle. ''Ti\u00f3'' means log in Catalan. The log is sometimes \"found in the woods\" (in an event staged for children) and then adopted and taken home, where it is fed and cared for during a month or so. On [[Christmas Day]] or on [[Christmas Eve]], a game is played where children march around the house singing a song requesting the log to poop, then they tap the log gently with a stick, as if a magic wand, to make it poop, and lo and behold, as if through magic, it poops candy, and sometimes other small gifts. Usually the larger or main gifts are brought by the Three Kings on 6 January, and the ti\u00f3 only brings small things.\n \n[[File:Ti\u00f3 de Nadal.jpg|thumb|A ti\u00f3 exhibited at Pla\u00e7a Sant Jaume in Barcelona in the 2010\u20132011 Christmas season.]]\n\nAnother custom is to make a {{lang|ca|pessebre}} (nativity scene) in the home or in shop windows, the latter sometimes competing in originality or shear size and detail. Churches often host exhibits of numerous dioramas by nativity scene makers, or a single nativity scene they put out, and town halls generally put out a nativity scene in the central square. In Barcelona, every year, the main nativity scene is designed by different artists, and often ends up being an interesting, post-modern or conceptual and strange creation. In the home, the nativity scene often consists of strips of cork bark to represent cliffs or mountains in the background, moss as grass in the foreground, some wood chips or other as dirt, and aluminum foil for rivers and lakes. The traditional figurines often included are the three wise men on camels or horses, which are moved every day or so to go closer to the manger, a star with a long tail in the background to lead people to the spot, the annunciation with shepherds having a meal and an angel appearing (hanging from something), a washer lady washing clothes in the pond, sheep, ducks, people carrying packages on their backs, a donkey driver with a load of twigs, and atrezzo such as a starry sky, miniature towns placed in the distance, either Oriental-styled or local-looking, a bridge over the river, trees, etc.\n\nOne of the most astonishing and sui-generis figurines traditionally placed in the nativity scene, to the great glee of children, is the {{lang|ca|[[caganer]]}}, a person depicted in the act of defecating.<ref name=\"BBC News\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12059969|title=A traditional Nativity scene, Catalan-style|work=BBC News |date=23 December 2010|accessdate=23 December 2010}}</ref> This figurine is hidden in some corner of the nativity scene and the game is to detect it. Of course, churches forgo this figurine, and the main nativity scene of Barcelona, for instance, likewise does not feature it. The caganer is so popular it has, together with the ti\u00f3, long been a major part of the Christmas markets, where they come in the guise of your favorite politicians or other famous people, as well as the traditional figures of a Catalan farmer. People often buy a figurine of a caganer in the guise of a famous person they are actually fond of, contrary to what one would imagine, though sometimes people buy a caganer in the guise of someone they dislike, although this means they have to look at them in the home...\n\nAnother (extended) Christmas tradition is the celebration of the Epiphany on 6 January, which is called ''Reis'', meaning Three Kings Day. This is every important in Catalonia and the Catalan-speaking areas, and families go to watch major parades on the eve of the Epiphany, where they can greet the kings and watch them pass by in pomp and circumstance, on floats and preceded and followed by pages, musicians, dancers, etc. They often give the kings letters with their gift requests, which are collected by the pages. On the next day, the children find the gifts the three kings brought for them.\n\nIn addition to traditional local Catalan culture, traditions from other parts of Spain can be found as a result of migration from other regions, for instance the celebration of the Andalusian {{lang|es|[[Seville Fair|Feria de Abril]]}} in Catalonia.\n\nOn 28 July 2010, second only after the [[Canary Islands]], [[Ban on bullfighting in Catalonia|Catalonia became another Spanish territory to forbid bullfighting]]. The ban, which went into effect on 1 January 2012, had originated in a popular petition supported by over 180,000 signatures.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Tremlett|first1=Giles|title=Catalonia votes to ban bullfighting|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/28/bullfighting-ban-spain-catalonia|accessdate=11 October 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=28 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Music and dance ===\n{{Main|Music of Catalonia}}\n[[File:Sardanes.jpg|thumb|[[Sardana]]]]\n\nThe [[sardana]] is considered to be the most characteristic Catalan folk dance, interpreted to the rhythm of [[Tambori|tambor\u00ed]], [[tible]] and [[tenora]] (from the oboe family), [[trumpet]], tromb\u00f3 ([[trombone]]), fiscorn (family of bugles) and contrabaix with three strings played by a [[cobla]], and are danced in a circle dance. Other tunes and dances of the traditional music are the contrap\u00e0s (obsolete today), [[ball de bastons]] (the \"dance of sticks\"), the moixiganga, the goigs (popular songs), the [[galop]]s or the [[Jota (music)|jota]] in the southern part. The [[Habanera (music)|havaneres]] are characteristic in some marine localities of the Costa Brava, especially during the summer months when these songs are sung outdoors accompanied by a {{lang|ca|cremat}} of burned rum.\n\nArt music was first developed, up to the nineteenth century and, as in much of Europe, in a liturgical setting, particularly marked by the Escolania de Montserrat. The main Western musical trends have marked these productions, medieval monodies or polyphonies, with the work of [[Abbot Oliba]] in the eleventh century or the compilation [[Llibre Vermell de Montserrat]] (\"Red Book of Montserrat\") from the fourteenth century. Through the Renaissance there were authors such as [[Pere Albert Vila]], [[Joan Brudieu]] or the two [[Mateu Fletxa]] (\"The Old\" and \"The Young\"). Baroque had composers like [[Joan Cererols]]. The Romantic music was represented by composers such as [[Fernando Sor]], [[Josep Anselm Clav\u00e9]] (father of choir movement in Catalonia and responsible of the music folk reviving) or [[Felip Pedrell]].\n\nModernisme also expressed in musical terms from the end of the 19th century onwards, mixing folkloric and post-romantic influences, through the works of [[Isaac Alb\u00e9niz]] and [[Enric Granados]]. The avant-garde spirit initiated by the modernists is prolonged throughout the twentieth century, thanks to the activities of the [[Orfe\u00f3 Catal\u00e0]], a choral society founded in 1891, with its monumental concert hall, the [[Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana]] in Catalan, built by Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner from 1905 to 1908, the [[Barcelona Symphony Orchestra]] created in 1944 and composers, conductors and musicians engaged against the Francoism like [[Robert Gerhard]], [[Eduard Toldr\u00e0]] and [[Pau Casals]].\n\nPerformances of [[opera]], mostly imported from Italy, began in the 18th century, but some native operas were written as well, including the ones by [[Dom\u00e8nec Terradellas]], [[Carles Baguer]], [[Ramon Carles]], Isaac Alb\u00e9niz and Enric Granados. The Barcelona main opera house, [[Gran Teatre del Liceu]] (opened in 1847), remains one of the most important in Spain, hosting one of the most prestigious music schools in Barcelona, the [[Conservatori Superior de M\u00fasica del Liceu]]. Several lyrical artists trained by this institution gained international renown during the 20th century, such as [[Victoria de los \u00c1ngeles]], [[Montserrat Caball\u00e9]], [[Giacomo Aragall]] and [[Josep Carreras]].\n\nCellist [[Pau Casals]] is admired as an outstanding player.

In Catalonia there is a wide variety of local and comarcal media. With the restoration of democracy, many newspapers and magazines, until then in the hands of the Franco government, were recovered in order to convert them into free and democratic media, while local radios and televisions were implemented.\n\n[[Televisi\u00f3 de Catalunya]], which broadcasts entirely in the Catalan language, is the main Catalan public TV. It has five channels: [[TV3 (Catalonia)|TV3]], [[El 33]]/[[Super3]], [[3/24]], [[Esport3]] and [[TV3CAT]].

First, auteur cinema, in the continuity of the [[Barcelona School of Film|Barcelona School]], emphasizes experimentation and form, while focusing on developing social and political themes. Worn first by [[Josep Maria Forn]] or [[Bigas Luna]], then by [[Marc Recha]], [[Jaime Rosales]] and [[Albert Serra]], this genre has achieved some international recognition. Then, the [[documentary]] became another genre particularly representative of contemporary Catalan cinema, boosted by [[Joaquim Jord\u00e0 i Catal\u00e0]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Guer\u00edn]]. Later, horror films and thrillers have also emerged as a specialty of the Catalan film industry, thanks in particular to the vitality of the [[Sitges Film Festival]], created in 1968. Several directors have gained worldwide renown thanks to this genre, starting with Jaume Balaguer\u00f3 and his series ''[[REC (film)|REC]]'' (co-directed with Valencian Paco Plaza), [[Juan Antonio Bayona]] and ''[[El orfanato|El Orfanato]]'' or [[Jaume Collet-Serra]] with ''[[Orphan (2009 film)|Orphan]]'', ''[[Unknown (2011 film)|Unknown]]'' and ''[[Non-Stop (film)|Non-Stop]]''.\n\nCatalan actors have shot for Spanish and international productions, such as [[Sergi L\u00f3pez (actor)|Sergi L\u00f3pez]].\n\nThe [[Museum of Cinema - Tom\u00e0s Mallol Collection]] (Museu del Cinema - Col.lecci\u00f3 Tom\u00e0s Mallol in Catalan) of Girona is home of important permanent exhibitions of cinema and pre-cinema objects. Other important institutions for the promotion of cinema are the [[Gaud\u00ed Awards]] (Premis Gaud\u00ed in Catalan, which replaced from 2009 Barcelona Film Awards themselves created in 2002), serving as equivalent for Catalonia to the Spanish [[Goya Awards|Goya]] or French [[C\u00e9sar Award|C\u00e9sar]].\n\n=== Philosophy ===\n{{See also|Seny}}\n{{lang|ca|Seny}} is a form of ancestral Catalan wisdom or sensibleness. It involves well-pondered perception of situations, level-headedness, awareness, integrity, and right action. Many Catalans consider seny something unique to their culture, is based on a set of ancestral local customs stemming from the scale of values and social norms of their society.\n\n=== Sport ===\n{{Main|Sport in Catalonia}}\nSport has a distinct importance in Catalan life and culture since the beginning of the 20th century and consequently, has a well developed sport infrastructure. The main sports are [[association football|football]], [[basketball]], [[handball]], [[rink hockey]], [[tennis]] and [[motorsport]].\n\nDespite the fact that the most popular sports are represented outside by the Spanish national teams, Catalonia can officially play as itself in some others, like [[korfball]], [[futsal]] or [[rugby league]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.seleccions.cat/index.php/seleccions-reconegudes/esports-reconeguts|title=Esports reconeguts|website=www.seleccions.cat|access-date=13 September 2016}}</ref> Most of Catalan Sports Federations have a long tradition and some of them participated in the foundation of international sports federations, as the Catalan Federation of Rugby, that was one of the founder members of the [[FIRA \u2013 Association of European Rugby|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Rugby Amateur]] (FIRA) in 1934.<ref name=\"fira-aer-rugby.com\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.fira-aer-rugby.com/article_detail.php?article=33 |title=Archived copy |access-date=19 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216142416/http://www.fira-aer-rugby.com/article_detail.php?article=33 |archive-date=16 February 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The majority of Catalan sport federations are part of the [[Sports Federation Union of Catalonia]] (Catalan: {{lang|ca|Uni\u00f3 de Federacions Esportives de Catalunya}}), founded in 1933.\n\nThe [[Catalan Football Federation]] also periodically fields a [[Catalonia national football team|national team]] against international opposition, organizing friendly matches. In the recent years they have played with Bulgaria, Argentina, Brazil, Basque Country, Colombia, Nigeria, Cape Verde and Tunisia. The biggest football clubs are [[FC Barcelona]] (also known as Bar\u00e7a), who have won five European Cups ([[UEFA Champions League]]), and [[RCD Espanyol]], who have twice been runner-up of the [[UEFA Cup]]. Both play in [[La Liga]].\n\nThe Catalan [[waterpolo]] is one of the main powers of the Iberian Peninsula. The Catalans won triumphs in waterpolo competitions at European and world level by club (the Barcelona was champion of Europe in 1981/82 and the Catalonia in 1994/95) and national team (one gold and one silver in Olympic Games and World Championships). It also has many international [[synchronized swimming]] champions.\n\nMotorsport has a long tradition in Catalonia, which involving many people, with some world champions and several competitions organized since the beginning of the 20th century. The [[Circuit de Catalunya]], built in 1991, is one of the main motorsport venues, holding the Catalan motorcycle Grand Prix, the Spanish F1 Grand Prix, a DTM race, and several other races.\n\nCatalonia hosted many relevant international sport events, such as the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in Barcelona, and also the [[1955 Mediterranean Games]], the [[2013 World Aquatics Championships]] or the [[2018 Mediterranean Games]].
