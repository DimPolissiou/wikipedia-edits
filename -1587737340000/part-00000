Therefore, Burnett decided to end the series on her own rather than be canceled later.\n\nThe celebrities in the audience for the final episode included [[Bernadette Peters]], [[Betty White]] and then-husband [[Allen Ludden]], [[Roddy McDowall]], [[Jim Nabors]] and screen legend [[Lillian Gish]].\n\n''The Carol Burnett Show'' was one of the longest-running variety shows in television history; its conclusion marked the closing of another chapter in television as Burnett was the last of the great comedic talents heading a variety show, and hers was the last offering live entertainment before an audience.\n\n==Featured segments==\n*Introduction: [[FAQ|Q&A]] (Carol Burnett)\n*Duets: [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Perry Como]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Steve Lawrence]] and [[Eydie Gorm\u00e9]]\n*\"[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]]\" ([[Burt Reynolds]])\n*\"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\" \u2013 ''Flashbacks'' (Carol Burnett and Tim Conway): Mr. Tudball is moving his office and has a flashback to when he first interviewed Mrs. Wiggins. \n*\"[[Ragtime Cowboy Joe]]\" ([[James Stewart]])\n*Water Gimmicks:\n**\"[[They Call the Wind Maria]]\" (Harvey Korman)\n**\"[[Come Rain or Come Shine]]\" (Carol Burnett)\n*Solo Montage:\n**\"[[The Lady Is a Tramp]]\" (Carol Burnett)\n**\"[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]]\" (Carol Burnett)\n*Movie Parodies:\n**''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' (Carol Burnett and Steve Lawrence)\n**''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'' (Carol Burnett, Harvey Korman and Steve Lawrence)\n*\"The Doily Sisters\" (Carol Burnett and Vicki Lawrence)\n*Favorite Moments:\n**\"[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]\" / \"S-P-L-I-T\" (Vicki Lawrence)\n**\"The Brown Derby\" (Carol Burnett, [[Bob Hope]] and Bing Crosby)\n**\"Newscaster\" (Tim Conway)\n**\"Cobumble\" \u2013 a spoof of ''[[Columbo]]'' (Tim Conway)\n**\"Hand Insurance\" (Carol Burnett and [[Dick Van Dyke]])\n*\"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" \u2013 ''The Psychiatrist'' (Carol Burnett, Vicki Lawrence and [[Craig Richard Nelson]]): Eunice consults a psychiatrist trying to figure out what went wrong with her life.\n*Scrapbook: \"[[Salsoul Orchestra|Magic Bird of Fire]]\" (The Ernie Flatt Dancers)\n*Bloopers and Outtakes\n*Finale: The Charwoman: \"I'm So Glad We Had This Time Together\" (Carol Burnett)\n\n==DVD release==\nOn October 3, 2017, [[Time Life]] released ''The Best of The Carol Burnett Show \u2013 The Final Show'' as a single disc [[DVD]] in Region 1 to commemorate the show's 50th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Carol Burnett Show - The Final Show|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/Carol-Burnett-Volume-Release/17604}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{imdb episode|0536584}}\n*[https://www.paleycenter.org/collection/item/?q=liza+minnelli+&f=all&c=tv&advanced=1&p=4&item=T80:0730 \"A Special Evening with Carol Burnett\"] at the [[Paley Center for Media]]\n\n{{The Carol Burnett Show}} \n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Special Evening with Carol Burnett, A}}\n[[Category:1978 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:American television series finales]]\n[[Category:Carol Burnett]]\n", "name_user": "Moe1810", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFeatured segments", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Special_Evening_with_Carol_Burnett"}

The ratio of blocking activity to stimulating activity determines a portion of its clinical effects. Brexpiprazole has more blocking and less stimulating activity at the dopamine receptors than its predecessor, aripiprazole, which may decrease its risk for agitation and restlessness.<ref name=\"pmid24947465\" /> Specifically, where aripiprazole has an intrinsic activity or agonist effect at the [[D2 receptor|D<sub>2</sub>]] receptor of 60%+, brexpiprazole has an intrinsic activity at the same receptor of about 45%. For aripiprazole, this means more dopamine receptor activation at lower doses, with blockade being reached at higher doses, whereas brexpiprazole is the opposite. By contrast, brexpiprazole has a much higher affinity for the [[5-HT1A receptor|5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor]] than aripiprazole as well as a much higher intrinsic activity. In vivo characterization of brexpiprazole shows that it may act as a near-full agonist of the [[5-HT1A receptor|5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor]]. This may further underlie a lower potential than aripiprazole to cause treatment-emergent, movement-related disorders such as akathisia due to the downstream dopamine release that is triggered by [[5-HT1A receptor|5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor]] agonism. It is also an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of the serotonin [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]], [[5-HT2B receptor|5-HT<sub>2B</sub>]], and [[5-HT7 receptor|5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor]]s, which may contribute to antidepressant effect.

The ratio of blocking activity to stimulating activity determines a portion of its clinical effects. Brexpiprazole has more blocking and less stimulating activity at the dopamine receptors than its predecessor, aripiprazole, which may decrease its risk for agitation and restlessness.<ref name=\"pmid24947465\" /> Specifically, where aripiprazole has an intrinsic activity or agonist effect at the [[D2 receptor|D<sub>2</sub>]] receptor of 60%+, brexpiprazole has an intrinsic activity at the same receptor of about 45%. For aripiprazole, this means more dopamine receptor activation at lower doses, with blockade being reached at higher doses, whereas brexpiprazole is the opposite. By contrast, brexpiprazole has a much higher affinity for the [[5-HT1A receptor|5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor]] than aripiprazole as well as a much higher intrinsic activity. In vivo characterization of brexpiprazole shows that it may act as a near-full agonist of the [[5-HT1A receptor|5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor]]. This may further underlie a lower potential than aripiprazole to cause treatment-emergent, movement-related disorders such as akathisia due to the downstream dopamine release that is triggered by [[5-HT1A receptor|5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor]] agonism. It is also an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of the serotonin [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]], [[5-HT2B receptor|5-HT<sub>2B</sub>]], and [[5-HT7 receptor|5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor]]s, which may contribute to antidepressant effect.

Historically, a merchant is anyone who is involved in [[commerce|business]] or trade. Merchants have operated for as long as industry, commerce, and trade have existed. In 16th-century Europe, two different terms for merchants emerged: ''meerseniers'' referred to local traders (such as bakers and grocers) and ''koopman'' ({{lang-nl|koopman}}) referred to merchants who operated on a global stage, importing and exporting goods over vast distances and offering added-value services such as credit and finance.\n\nThe status of the merchant has varied during different periods of history and among different societies. In [[ancient Rome]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] merchants could become wealthy, but lacked high social status. In contrast, in the Middle East, where markets were an integral part of the city, merchants enjoyed high status. In modern times, the term ''merchant'' has occasionally been used to refer to a [[businessperson]] or someone undertaking activities (commercial or industrial) for the purpose of generating profit, cash flow, sales, and revenue utilizing a combination of human, financial, intellectual and physical [[Capital (economics)|capital]] with a view to fueling economic development and growth.\n\n[[File:BritLibAddMS35166ApocalypseUnkFolio3SealBlackHorse.jpg|thumb|A scale or balance is often used to symbolise a merchant]]\n\nMerchants have been known for as long as humans have engaged in trade and commerce. Merchants and merchant networks operated in ancient [[Babylonia]] and [[Assyria]], [[Ancient China|China]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], Greece, [[Ancient India|India]], [[Ancient Persia|Persia]], [[Phoenicia]], and Rome. During the European [[medieval period]], a rapid expansion in trade and commerce led to the rise of a wealthy and powerful [[merchant class]]. The European [[age of discovery]] opened up new trading routes and gave European consumers access to a much broader range of goods. From the 1600s, goods began to travel much further distances as they found their way into geographically dispersed market-places.  Following the opening of Asia to European trade and the discovery of the New World, merchants imported goods over very long distances: calico cloth from India, porcelain, silk and tea from China, spices from India and South-East Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum and coffee from the New World. By the eighteenth century, a new type of manufacturer-merchant had started to emerge and modern [[business practices]] were becoming evident.\n\n===\n[[File:16th century costumes of merchants from Brabant and Antwerp.jpg|thumb|Costumes of merchants from Brabant and Antwerp, engraving by [[Abraham de Bruyn]], 1577]]\nThe English term, ''merchant'' comes from the Middle English, ''marchant'', which itself originated from the Vulgar Latin ''mercatant'' or ''mercatans'', formed from present participle of ''mercatare'' ('to trade, to traffic or to deal in').<ref>''Merriam-Webster Dictionary'', https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/merchant</ref> The term refers to any type of reseller, but can also be used with a specific qualifier to suggest a person who deals in a given characteristic such as ''speed merchant'', which refer to someone who enjoys fast driving; ''noise merchant'', which refers to a group of musical performers;<ref>''Online Dictionary of Etymology,'' http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=merchant</ref> ''dream merchant'', which refers to someone who peddles idealistic visionary scenarios; ''merchant of war'', which refers disparagingly to proponents of war.\n\nElizabeth Honig has argued that concepts relating to the role of a merchant began to change in the mid-16th century. The Dutch term, ''koopman'', became rather more fluid during the 16th century when Antwerp was the most global market town in Europe. Two different terms, for a merchant, began to be used, ''meerseniers'' referred to local merchants including bakers, grocers, sellers of dairy products and stall-holders, while the alternate term, ''koopman,'' referred to those who traded in goods or credit on a large scale. This distinction was necessary to separate the daily trade that the general population understood from the rising ranks of traders who took up their places on a world stage and were seen as quite distant from everyday experience.<ref>Honig, E.A., ''Painting & the Market in Early Modern Antwerp,'' Yale University Press, 1998, pp 4-10</ref>\n\n==Types of merchant==\n\nBroadly, merchants can be classified into two categories:\n\n* A [[wholesale]] merchant operates in the chain between the producer and retail merchant, typically dealing in large quantities of goods.<ref>Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, 2013. [http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/merchant mer\u2027chant]</ref> In other words, a wholesaler does not sell directly to end-users. Some wholesale merchants only organize the movement of goods rather than move the goods themselves.\n* A [[retail]] merchant or [[retailer]] sells merchandise to end-users or consumers (including businesses), usually in small quantities. A shop-keeper is a retail merchant.\n\nHowever, the term 'merchant' is often used in a variety of specialised contexts such as in ''merchant banker'', ''merchant navy'' or ''[[merchant services]]''.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Retail#history|Market (place)|History of marketing}}\n\n===Merchants in antiquity===\n[[File:PhoenicianTrade EN.svg|thumb|Phoenician trade route map]]\nMerchants have existed as long as humans have conducted business, [[trade]] or [[commerce]].<ref>Demirdjian, Z.

While the local peasantry, who were generally poor, relied on open-air market places to buy and sell produce and wares, major producers such as the great estates were sufficiently attractive for merchants to call directly at their farm-gates. The very wealthy landowners managed their own distribution, which may have involved exporting.<ref>Bintliff, J., \"Going to Market in Antiquity,\" In ''Stuttgarter Kolloquium zur Historischen Geographie des Altertums,'' Eckart Olshausen and Holger Sonnabend (eds), Stuttgart, Franz Steiner, 2002, p. 229, https://books.google.com/books?id=IAMK1952av4C : \"The kind of model that Morley and other specialists in Greco-Roman marketing have been developing [...] sees the local market-town as primarily serving local peasantry. Here they unload their small surplus and purchase minor amounts of farm equipment and luxuries for their barns and homes; some of their needs are already met through travelling pedlars and non-urban periodic fairs held at long intervals. Major producers - the great estates - would be attractive enough foci for merchants to consider travelling directly to purchase commercially-focussed harvests 'at the farm gate', and some landowners were wealthy enough to handle their own distribution to urban markets in the country of production and even to other countries.

Blintiff has investigated the early Medieval networks of market towns and suggests that by the 12th century there was an upsurge in the number of market towns and the emergence of merchant circuits as traders bulked up surpluses from smaller regional, different day markets and resold them at the larger centralised market towns. Peddlers or itinerant merchants filled any gaps in the distribution system.<ref>Bintliff, J., \"Going to Market in Antiquity\", In ''Stuttgarter Kolloquium zur Historischen Geographie des Altertums'', Eckart Olshausen and Holger Sonnabend (eds), Stuttgart, Franz Steiner, 2002, p. 224</ref> From the 11th century, the [[Crusades]] helped to open up new trade routes in the Near East, while the adventurer and merchant, [[Marco Polo]] stimulated interest in the far East in the 12th and 13th centuries. Medieval merchants began to trade in exotic goods imported from distant shores including spices, wine, food, furs, fine cloth (notably silk), glass, jewellery and many other [[luxury goods]]. Market towns began to spread across the landscape during the medieval period.\n\nMerchant [[guild]]s began to form during the Medieval period. A fraternity formed by the merchants of Tiel in Gelderland (in present-day Netherlands) in 1020 is believed to be the first example of a guild. The term, ''guild'' was first used for ''gilda mercatoria'' and referred to body of merchants operating out of St. Omer, France in the 11th century. Similarly, London's ''[[Hanseatic League|Hanse]]'' was formed in the 12th century.<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online: https://www.britannica.com/topic/merchant-guild</ref> These guilds controlled the way that trade was to be conducted and codified rules governing the conditions of trade. Rules established by merchant guilds were often incorporated into the charters granted to [[market town]]s. In the early 12th century, a confederation of merchant guilds, formed out the German cities of Lubeck and Hamburg, known as \"The [[Hanseatic League]]\" came to dominate trade around the Baltic Sea. By the 13th and 14th centuries, merchant guilds had sufficient resources to have erected [[guildhall|guild halls]] in many major market towns.<ref>Epstein, S.A, ''Wage Labor and Guilds in Medieval Europe,'' University of North Carolina Press, 1991, pp 50-100</ref>\n\n[[File:Adriaen van der Kabel 1682 Mediterraneon port with Turkish merchants.jpg|thumb|Mediterranean port with Turkish merchants by [[Adriaen van der Kabel]], 1682]]\n \nDuring the thirteenth century, European businesses became more permanent and were able to maintain sedentary merchants and a system of agents. Merchants specialised in financing, organisation and transport while agents were domiciled overseas and acted on behalf of a principal. These arrangements first appeared on the route from Italy to the Levant, but by the end of the thirteenth century merchant colonies could be found from Paris, London, Bruges, Seville, Barcelona and Montpellier. Over time these partnerships became more commonplace and led to the development of large trading companies. These developments also triggered innovations such as double-entry book-keeping, commercial accountancy, international banking including access to lines of credit, marine insurance and commercial courier services. These developments are sometimes known as the ''commercial revolution.''<ref>Casson, M. and Lee, J., \"The Origin and Development of Markets: A Business History Perspective,\" ''Business History Review,'' Vol 85, Spring, 2011, doi:10.1017/S0007680511000018, pp 22\u201326</ref>\n\nLuca Clerici has made a detailed study of Vicenza's food market during the sixteenth century. He found that there were many different types of merchants operating out of the markets. For example, in the dairy trade, cheese and butter was sold by the members of two craft guilds (i.e., cheesemongers who were shopkeepers) and that of the so-called \u2018resellers\u2019 (hucksters selling a wide range of foodstuffs), and by other sellers who were not enrolled in any guild.  Cheesemongers\u2019 shops were situated at the town hall and were very lucrative. Resellers and direct sellers increased the number of sellers, thus increasing competition, to the benefit of consumers. Direct sellers, who brought produce from the surrounding countryside, sold their wares through the central market place and priced their goods at considerably lower rates than cheesemongers.<ref>Clerici, L., \"Le prix du bien commun.

The [[Company of Merchant Adventurers of London]], chartered in 1407, controlled most of the fine cloth imports<ref>[http://library.eb.co.uk/eb/article-9052088 \"Merchant Adventurers\"] in [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], Online Library Edition, 2013.

A detailed study of European trade between the thirteenth and fifteenth century demonstrates that the European age of discovery acted as a major driver of change. In 1600, goods travelled relatively short distances: grain 5\u201310 miles; cattle 40\u201370 miles; wool and wollen cloth 20\u201340 miles. However, in the years following the opening up of Asia and the discovery of the New World, goods were imported from very long distances: calico cloth from India, porcelain, silk and tea from China, spices from India and South-East Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum and coffee from the New World.<ref>Braudel, F. and Reynold, S., ''The Wheels of Commerce: Civilization and Capitalism, 15th to 18th Century'', Berkeley CA, University of California Press, 1992</ref>\n\nIn Mesoamerica, a tiered system of traders developed independently. The local markets, where people purchased their daily needs were known as ''[[tianguis]]'' while ''[[pochteca]]'' referred to long-distance, professional merchants traders who obtained rare goods and luxury items desired by the nobility. This trading system supported various levels of pochteca \u2013 from very high status merchants through to minor traders who acted as a type of peddler to fill in gaps in the distribution system.<ref>Salom\u00f3n, F., \"Pochteca and mindal\u00e1: a comparison of long-distance traders in Ecuador and Mesoamerica,\" ''Journal of the Steward Anthropological Society, '' Vol. 1-2, 1978, pp 231-246</ref> The Spanish conquerors commented on the impressive nature of the local and regional markets in the 15th century.

The historian, Vannneste, has argued that a new ''cosmopolitan merchant mentality'' based on trust, reciprosity and a culture of communal support developed and helped to unify the early modern world. Given that these cosmopolitan merchants were embedded within their societies and participated in the highest level of exchange, they transferred a more outward-looking mindset and system of values to their commercial exchange transactions, and also helped to disseminate a more global awareness to broader society and therefore acted as agents of change for local society. Successful, open-minded cosmopolitan merchants began to acquire a more esteemed social position with the political elites. They were often sought as advisors for high-level political agents<ref>Vanneste, R., ''Global Trade and Commercial Networks: Eighteenth-Century Diamond Merchants,'' London, Pickering and Chatto, 2011, {{ISBN|9781848930872}}</ref>\n\nBy the eighteenth century, a new type of manufacturer-merchant was emerging and modern business practices were becoming evident.

He also inferred that selling at lower prices would lead to higher demand and recognised the value of achieving [[Economies of scale|scale economies]] in production. By cutting costs and lowering prices, Wedgewood was able to generate higher overall profits.<ref>Drake, D., \"Dinnerware & Cost Accounting?

He also practiced planned obsolescence and understood the importance of \"celebrity marketing\" \u2013 that is supplying the nobility, often at prices below cost and of obtaining royal patronage, for the sake of the publicity and kudos generated.<ref>Applbaum, K., ''The Marketing Era: From Professional Practice to Global Provisioning,'' Routledge, 2004, p. 126-127</ref> Both Wedgewood and Boulton staged expansive showcases of their wares in their private residences or in rented halls.<ref>McKendrick, N., Brewer, J. and Plumb .

They tended not to specialise in particular types of merchandise, often trading as general merchants, selling a diverse range of product types. These merchants were concentrated in the larger cities. They often provided high levels of credit financing for retail transactions.<ref>Savitt, R., \"Looking Back to See Ahead: Writing the History of American Retailing\", in ''Retailing: The Evolution and Development of Retailing'', A.

At this time, the economy was undergoing profound changes \u2013 capitalism emerged as the dominant social organisation replacing earlier modes of production. Merchants were importing produce from afar \u2013 grain from the Baltic, textiles from England, wine from Germany and metals from various countries. Antwerp was the centre of this new commercial world. The public began to distinguish between two types of merchant, the ''meerseniers'' which were local merchants including bakers, grocers, sellers of dairy products and stall-holders, and the ''koopman,'' which were a new, emergent class of trader who dealt in goods or credit on a large scale. With the rise of a European merchant class, this distinction was necessary to separate the daily trade that the general population understood from the rising ranks of traders who operated on a world stage and were seen as quite distant from everyday experience.<ref>Honig, E.A., ''Painting & the Market in Early Modern Antwerp,'' Yale University Press, 1998, pp 6-10</ref> The wealthier merchants also had the means to commission artworks with the result that individual merchants and their families became important subject matter for artists. For instance, Hans Holbein, the younger painted a series of portraits of Hanseatic merchants working out of London's Steelyard in the 1530s.<ref>Fudge, J.F., ''Commerce and Print in the Early Reformation,'' Brill, 2007, p.110</ref> These included including Georg Giese of Danzig; Hillebrant Wedigh of Cologne; Dirk Tybis of Duisburg; Hans of Antwerp, Hermann Wedigh, Johann Schwarzwald, Cyriacus Kale, Derich Born and Derick Berck.<ref>Holman, T.S., \"Holbein's Portraits of the Steelyard Merchants: An Investigation,\" Metropolitan Museum Journal, vol. 14, 1980, pp 139-158</ref> Paintings of groups of merchants, notably officers of the merchant guilds, also became subject matter for artists and documented the rise of important mercantile organisations.\n\nIn recent art: Dutch photographer Loes Heerink spend [https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/gallery/2016/nov/04/view-from-bridge-vietnams-street-vendors-in-pictures hours on bridges] in Hanoi to take pictures of Vietnamese street Merchants.

Historically, a merchant is anyone who is involved in [[commerce|business]] or trade. Merchants have operated for as long as industry, commerce, and trade have existed. In 16th-century Europe, two different terms for merchants emerged: ''meerseniers'' referred to local traders (such as bakers and grocers) and ''koopman'' ({{lang-nl|koopman}}) referred to merchants who operated on a global stage, importing and exporting goods over vast distances and offering added-value services such as credit and finance.\n\nThe status of the merchant has varied during different periods of history and among different societies. In [[ancient Rome]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] merchants could become wealthy, but lacked high social status. In contrast, in the Middle East, where markets were an integral part of the city, merchants enjoyed high status. In modern times, the term ''merchant'' has occasionally been used to refer to a [[businessperson]] or someone undertaking activities (commercial or industrial) for the purpose of generating profit, cash flow, sales, and revenue utilizing a combination of human, financial, intellectual and physical [[Capital (economics)|capital]] with a view to fueling economic development and growth.\n\n[[File:BritLibAddMS35166ApocalypseUnkFolio3SealBlackHorse.jpg|thumb|A scale or balance is often used to symbolise a merchant]]\n\nMerchants have been known for as long as humans have engaged in trade and commerce. Merchants and merchant networks operated in ancient [[Babylonia]] and [[Assyria]], [[Ancient China|China]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], Greece, [[Ancient India|India]], [[Ancient Persia|Persia]], [[Phoenicia]], and Rome. During the European [[medieval period]], a rapid expansion in trade and commerce led to the rise of a wealthy and powerful [[merchant class]]. The European [[age of discovery]] opened up new trading routes and gave European consumers access to a much broader range of goods. From the 1600s, goods began to travel much further distances as they found their way into geographically dispersed market-places.  Following the opening of Asia to European trade and the discovery of the New World, merchants imported goods over very long distances: calico cloth from India, porcelain, silk and tea from China, spices from India and South-East Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum and coffee from the New World. By the eighteenth century, a new type of manufacturer-merchant had started to emerge and modern [[business practices]] were becoming evident.\n\n==Etymology and usage==\n[[File:16th century costumes of merchants from Brabant and Antwerp.jpg|thumb|Costumes of merchants from Brabant and Antwerp, engraving by [[Abraham de Bruyn]], 1577]]\nThe English term, ''merchant'' comes from the Middle English, ''marchant'', which itself originated from the Vulgar Latin ''mercatant'' or ''mercatans'', formed from present participle of ''mercatare'' ('to trade, to traffic or to deal in').<ref>''Merriam-Webster Dictionary'', https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/merchant</ref> The term refers to any type of reseller, but can also be used with a specific qualifier to suggest a person who deals in a given characteristic such as ''speed merchant'', which refer to someone who enjoys fast driving; ''noise merchant'', which refers to a group of musical performers;<ref>''Online Dictionary of Etymology,'' http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=merchant</ref> ''dream merchant'', which refers to someone who peddles idealistic visionary scenarios; ''merchant of war'', which refers disparagingly to proponents of war.\n\nElizabeth Honig has argued that concepts relating to the role of a merchant began to change in the mid-16th century. The Dutch term, ''koopman'', became rather more fluid during the 16th century when Antwerp was the most global market town in Europe. Two different terms, for a merchant, began to be used, ''meerseniers'' referred to local merchants including bakers, grocers, sellers of dairy products and stall-holders, while the alternate term, ''koopman,'' referred to those who traded in goods or credit on a large scale. This distinction was necessary to separate the daily trade that the general population understood from the rising ranks of traders who took up their places on a world stage and were seen as quite distant from everyday experience.<ref>Honig, E.A., ''Painting & the Market in Early Modern Antwerp,'' Yale University Press, 1998, pp 4-10</ref>\n\n==Types of merchant==\n\nBroadly, merchants can be classified into two categories:\n\n* A [[wholesale]] merchant operates in the chain between the producer and retail merchant, typically dealing in large quantities of goods.<ref>Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, 2013. [http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/merchant mer\u2027chant]</ref> In other words, a wholesaler does not sell directly to end-users. Some wholesale merchants only organize the movement of goods rather than move the goods themselves.\n* A [[retail]] merchant or [[retailer]] sells merchandise to end-users or consumers (including businesses), usually in small quantities. A shop-keeper is a retail merchant.\n\nHowever, the term 'merchant' is often used in a variety of specialised contexts such as in ''merchant banker'', ''merchant navy'' or ''[[merchant services]]''.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Retail#history|Market (place)|History of marketing}}\n\n===Merchants in antiquity===\n[[File:PhoenicianTrade EN.svg|thumb|Phoenician trade route map]]\nMerchants have existed as long as humans have conducted business, [[trade]] or [[commerce]].<ref>Demirdjian, Z.

While the local peasantry, who were generally poor, relied on open-air market places to buy and sell produce and wares, major producers such as the great estates were sufficiently attractive for merchants to call directly at their farm-gates. The very wealthy landowners managed their own distribution, which may have involved exporting.<ref>Bintliff, J., \"Going to Market in Antiquity,\" In ''Stuttgarter Kolloquium zur Historischen Geographie des Altertums,'' Eckart Olshausen and Holger Sonnabend (eds), Stuttgart, Franz Steiner, 2002, p. 229, https://books.google.com/books?id=IAMK1952av4C : \"The kind of model that Morley and other specialists in Greco-Roman marketing have been developing [...] sees the local market-town as primarily serving local peasantry.

Major producers - the great estates - would be attractive enough foci for merchants to consider travelling directly to purchase commercially-focussed harvests 'at the farm gate', and some landowners were wealthy enough to handle their own distribution to urban markets in the country of production and even to other countries. These latter processes are documented both in the ancient sources and archaeological case-studies.\"</ref>  Markets were also important centres of social life, and merchants helped to spread news and gossip.<ref>Millar, F., \"The World of the Golden Ass\", ''Journal of Roman Studies'', Vol. 71, 1981, pp. 63\u201367</ref>\n\nThe nature of export markets in antiquity is well documented in ancient sources and in archaeological case-studies.

Blintiff has investigated the early Medieval networks of market towns and suggests that by the 12th century there was an upsurge in the number of market towns and the emergence of merchant circuits as traders bulked up surpluses from smaller regional, different day markets and resold them at the larger centralised market towns. Peddlers or itinerant merchants filled any gaps in the distribution system.<ref>Bintliff, J., \"Going to Market in Antiquity\", In ''Stuttgarter Kolloquium zur Historischen Geographie des Altertums'', Eckart Olshausen and Holger Sonnabend (eds), Stuttgart, Franz Steiner, 2002, p. 224</ref> From the 11th century, the [[Crusades]] helped to open up new trade routes in the Near East, while the adventurer and merchant, [[Marco Polo]] stimulated interest in the far East in the 12th and 13th centuries. Medieval merchants began to trade in exotic goods imported from distant shores including spices, wine, food, furs, fine cloth (notably silk), glass, jewellery and many other [[luxury goods]]. Market towns began to spread across the landscape during the medieval period.\n\nMerchant [[guild]]s began to form during the Medieval period. A fraternity formed by the merchants of Tiel in Gelderland (in present-day Netherlands) in 1020 is believed to be the first example of a guild. The term, ''guild'' was first used for ''gilda mercatoria'' and referred to body of merchants operating out of St. Omer, France in the 11th century. Similarly, London's ''[[Hanseatic League|Hanse]]'' was formed in the 12th century.<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online: https://www.britannica.com/topic/merchant-guild</ref> These guilds controlled the way that trade was to be conducted and codified rules governing the conditions of trade. Rules established by merchant guilds were often incorporated into the charters granted to [[market town]]s. In the early 12th century, a confederation of merchant guilds, formed out the German cities of Lubeck and Hamburg, known as \"The [[Hanseatic League]]\" came to dominate trade around the Baltic Sea. By the 13th and 14th centuries, merchant guilds had sufficient resources to have erected [[guildhall|guild halls]] in many major market towns.<ref>Epstein, S.A, ''Wage Labor and Guilds in Medieval Europe,'' University of North Carolina Press, 1991, pp 50-100</ref>\n\n[[File:Adriaen van der Kabel 1682 Mediterraneon port with Turkish merchants.jpg|thumb|Mediterranean port with Turkish merchants by [[Adriaen van der Kabel]], 1682]]\n \nDuring the thirteenth century, European businesses became more permanent and were able to maintain sedentary merchants and a system of agents. Merchants specialised in financing, organisation and transport while agents were domiciled overseas and acted on behalf of a principal. These arrangements first appeared on the route from Italy to the Levant, but by the end of the thirteenth century merchant colonies could be found from Paris, London, Bruges, Seville, Barcelona and Montpellier. Over time these partnerships became more commonplace and led to the development of large trading companies. These developments also triggered innovations such as double-entry book-keeping, commercial accountancy, international banking including access to lines of credit, marine insurance and commercial courier services. These developments are sometimes known as the ''commercial revolution.''<ref>Casson, M. and Lee, J., \"The Origin and Development of Markets: A Business History Perspective,\" ''Business History Review,'' Vol 85, Spring, 2011, doi:10.1017/S0007680511000018, pp 22\u201326</ref>\n\nLuca Clerici has made a detailed study of Vicenza's food market during the sixteenth century. He found that there were many different types of merchants operating out of the markets. For example, in the dairy trade, cheese and butter was sold by the members of two craft guilds (i.e., cheesemongers who were shopkeepers) and that of the so-called \u2018resellers\u2019 (hucksters selling a wide range of foodstuffs), and by other sellers who were not enrolled in any guild.  Cheesemongers\u2019 shops were situated at the town hall and were very lucrative. Resellers and direct sellers increased the number of sellers, thus increasing competition, to the benefit of consumers. Direct sellers, who brought produce from the surrounding countryside, sold their wares through the central market place and priced their goods at considerably lower rates than cheesemongers.<ref>Clerici, L., \"Le prix du bien commun.

A detailed study of European trade between the thirteenth and fifteenth century demonstrates that the European age of discovery acted as a major driver of change. In 1600, goods travelled relatively short distances: grain 5\u201310 miles; cattle 40\u201370 miles; wool and wollen cloth 20\u201340 miles. However, in the years following the opening up of Asia and the discovery of the New World, goods were imported from very long distances: calico cloth from India, porcelain, silk and tea from China, spices from India and South-East Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum and coffee from the New World.<ref>Braudel, F. and Reynold, S., ''The Wheels of Commerce: Civilization and Capitalism, 15th to 18th Century'', Berkeley CA, University of California Press, 1992</ref>\n\nIn Mesoamerica, a tiered system of traders developed independently. The local markets, where people purchased their daily needs were known as ''[[tianguis]]'' while ''[[pochteca]]'' referred to long-distance, professional merchants traders who obtained rare goods and luxury items desired by the nobility.

The historian, Vannneste, has argued that a new ''cosmopolitan merchant mentality'' based on trust, reciprosity and a culture of communal support developed and helped to unify the early modern world. Given that these cosmopolitan merchants were embedded within their societies and participated in the highest level of exchange, they transferred a more outward-looking mindset and system of values to their commercial exchange transactions, and also helped to disseminate a more global awareness to broader society and therefore acted as agents of change for local society. Successful, open-minded cosmopolitan merchants began to acquire a more esteemed social position with the political elites. They were often sought as advisors for high-level political agents<ref>Vanneste, R., ''Global Trade and Commercial Networks: Eighteenth-Century Diamond Merchants,'' London, Pickering and Chatto, 2011, {{ISBN|9781848930872}}</ref>\n\nBy the eighteenth century, a new type of manufacturer-merchant was emerging and modern business practices were becoming evident.

He also practiced planned obsolescence and understood the importance of \"celebrity marketing\" \u2013 that is supplying the nobility, often at prices below cost and of obtaining royal patronage, for the sake of the publicity and kudos generated.<ref>Applbaum, K., ''The Marketing Era: From Professional Practice to Global Provisioning,'' Routledge, 2004, p. 126-127</ref> Both Wedgewood and Boulton staged expansive showcases of their wares in their private residences or in rented halls.<ref>McKendrick, N., Brewer, J. and Plumb . J.H., ''The Birth of a Consumer Society: The Commercialization of Eighteenth Century England,'' London, 1982.</ref>\n\nEighteenth-century American merchants, who had been operating as importers and exporters, began to specialise in either wholesale or retail roles. They tended not to specialise in particular types of merchandise, often trading as general merchants, selling a diverse range of product types. These merchants were concentrated in the larger cities. They often provided high levels of credit financing for retail transactions.<ref>Savitt, R., \"Looking Back to See Ahead: Writing the History of American Retailing\", in ''Retailing: The Evolution and Development of Retailing'', A. M. Findlay, Leigh Sparks (eds), pp 138\u201339</ref>\n\n==In art==\n\nElizabeth Honig has argued that artists, especially the Dutch painters of Antwerp, developed a fascination with merchants from the mid-16th century. At this time, the economy was undergoing profound changes \u2013 capitalism emerged as the dominant social organisation replacing earlier modes of production. Merchants were importing produce from afar \u2013 grain from the Baltic, textiles from England, wine from Germany and metals from various countries. Antwerp was the centre of this new commercial world. The public began to distinguish between two types of merchant, the ''meerseniers'' which were local merchants including bakers, grocers, sellers of dairy products and stall-holders, and the ''koopman,'' which were a new, emergent class of trader who dealt in goods or credit on a large scale. With the rise of a European merchant class, this distinction was necessary to separate the daily trade that the general population understood from the rising ranks of traders who operated on a world stage and were seen as quite distant from everyday experience.<ref>Honig, E.A., ''Painting & the Market in Early Modern Antwerp,'' Yale University Press, 1998, pp 6-10</ref> The wealthier merchants also had the means to commission artworks with the result that individual merchants and their families became important subject matter for artists. For instance, Hans Holbein, the younger painted a series of portraits of Hanseatic merchants working out of London's Steelyard in the 1530s.<ref>Fudge, J.F., ''Commerce and Print in the Early Reformation,'' Brill, 2007, p.110</ref> These included including Georg Giese of Danzig; Hillebrant Wedigh of Cologne; Dirk Tybis of Duisburg; Hans of Antwerp, Hermann Wedigh, Johann Schwarzwald, Cyriacus Kale, Derich Born and Derick Berck.<ref>Holman, T.S., \"Holbein's Portraits of the Steelyard Merchants: An Investigation,\" Metropolitan Museum Journal, vol. 14, 1980, pp 139-158</ref> Paintings of groups of merchants, notably officers of the merchant guilds, also became subject matter for artists and documented the rise of important mercantile organisations.\n\nIn recent art: Dutch photographer Loes Heerink spend [https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/gallery/2016/nov/04/view-from-bridge-vietnams-street-vendors-in-pictures hours on bridges] in Hanoi to take pictures of Vietnamese street Merchants.
