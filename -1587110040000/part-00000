The single had success in the United States (where it was released by [[EMI]]), with the single remaining on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart for six months and ultimately peaking at number 13 in early 1986.\n\n==Track listing and formats==\n===Original version===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;7\" single\n# \"Tarzan Boy\" \u2013 3:48\n# \"Tarzan Boy\" (DJ version) \u2013 3:36\n\n;12\" single\n# \"Tarzan Boy\" (extended version) \u2013 6:15\n# \"Tarzan Boy\" (DJ version) \u2013 5:09 \n{{col-2}}\n;12\" maxi\n# \"Tarzan Boy\" (extended dance version) \u2013 6:16\n# \"Tarzan Boy\" (single version) \u2013 3:49\n# \"Tarzan Boy\" (extended dub version) \u2013 5:10\n\n;12\" maxi \u2013 Summer version\n# \"Tarzan Boy\" (Summer version) \u2013 6:40\n# \"Tarzan Boy\" (reprise) \u2013 6:00\n{{col-end}}\n\n===1993 version===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;CD single\n# \"Tarzan Boy\" (original version) \u2013 3:49\n# \"Tarzan Boy\" (1993 remix) \u2013 3:49\n\n;12\" single\n# \"Tarzan Boy\" (original version) \u2013 3:49\n# \"Tarzan Boy\" (UK swing mix) \u2013 3:18\n# \"Tarzan Boy\" (extended dub) \u2013 5:10\n\n;CD maxi\n# \"Tarzan Boy\" (1993 remix) \u2013 3:49\n# \"Tarzan Boy\" (extended 1993 remix) \u2013 5:33\n# \"Tarzan Boy\" (extended dub mix) \u2013 5:10\n{{col-2}}\n;Cassette\n# \"Tarzan Boy\" (original version) \u2013 3:49\n# \"Tarzan Boy\" (1993 remix) \u2013 3:49\n# \"Tarzan Boy\" (original version) \u2013 3:49\n# \"Tarzan Boy\" (1993 remix) \u2013 3:49\n\n;CD maxi \u2013 Promo\n# \"Tarzan Boy\" (original version) \u2013 3:45\n# \"Tarzan Boy\" (1993 remix) \u2013 3:46\n# \"Tarzan Boy\" (extended 1993 remix) \u2013 5:35\n# \"Tarzan Boy\" (UK swing mix) \u2013 3:21\n# \"Tarzan Boy\" (extended dub) \u2013 5:01\n{{col-end}}\n\n===2010 version===\n;Streaming single\n# \"Tarzan Boy\" (Digital Remaster) \u2013 3:49\n\n==Personnel==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Original version\n*Mixing by Jurgen Coppers\n*Recording by Paolo Mescoli\n*Composed by Maurizio Bassi and Naimy Hackett\n*Produced and arranged by Maurizio Bassi\n*Recorded at Il Cortile, [[Milan]]\n*Mixed at Paradise Studios, [[Monaco]]\n*Cover artwork by EMI Creative Services\n*Illustration by Michele Bernardi\n{{col-2}}\n;1993 version\n*Mixed by Daniel Abraham\n*Produced and arranged by Maurizio Bassi\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Charts and certifications==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1985\u20131986)\n!Peak<br/>position\n|-\n|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])<ref>{{Cite book|title=[[Kent Music Report|Australian Chart Book 1970\u20131992]] |last=Kent |first=David |authorlink=David Kent (historian) |publisher=Australian Chart Book |location=[[St Ives, New South Wales|St Ives, NSW]] |year=1993 |isbn=0-646-11917-6}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|16\n|-\n{{singlechart|Austria|2|artist=Baltimora|song=Tarzan Boy|accessdate=27 July 2013}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Flanders|1|artist=Baltimora|song=Tarzan Boy|accessdate=27 July 2013}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Canadatopsingles|5|chartid=0614|accessdate=27 July 2013}}\n|-\n|Europe ([[European Hot 100 Singles|Eurochart Hot 100]])<ref>{{cite web|url= http://musicseek.info/no1hits/1985.htm |title= MusicSeek.info \u2013 UK, Eurochart, Billboard & Cashbox No.1 Hits |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060614052216/http://musicseek.info/no1hits/1985.htm |archivedate= 14 June 2006}}.

In 1850, he sold his stake in the company to his erstwhile partner, [[Charles Morgan (businessman)|Charles Morgan]], in order to go into partnership with [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]] in the purchase of another leading New York marine engineering facility, the [[Allaire Iron Works]]. \n\nUnder Secor's management, T.

The Allaire Works under his leadership also built the engines for many oceangoing vessels, and during the [[American Civil War]], built the engines for seven [[United States Navy]] warships. Secor continued as manager of the Allaire Works until its closure in 1867 during the long postwar slump, when he retired from business.

The Allaire Works under his leadership also built the engines for many oceangoing vessels, and during the [[American Civil War]], built the engines for seven [[United States Navy]] warships. Secor continued as manager of the Allaire Works until its closure in 1867 during the long postwar slump, when he retired from business.

Not wanting to let it go to waste, West decided to keep the beat for himself and add lyrics expressed from a male's point-of-view.<ref name=Gold/>\n\nThe second verse of \"Gold Digger\" was the first to be written, as West used to rap the verse in early 2004 while on tour promoting his debut album, ''[[The College Dropout]]''. The first verse was made later in the year while West was on [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]]'s Evolution Tour. Lastly, the original third verse was taken from an unreleased song called \"Drop Dead Gorgeous,\" which West had produced and rapped on for [[Murphy Lee]] of [[St. Lunatics]]. About a year later, right before \"Gold Digger\" was set to be released as a single, West decided to write a different third verse and in a week the new song was recorded and mastered at [[Sony Music Studios]] in [[New York City]].<ref name=Gold/>\n\nThe idea of employing Jamie Foxx specifically to sing an [[Interpolation (music)|interpolation]] of Ray Charles' \"[[I Got a Woman]]\" in place of its initial [[Sampling (music)|sample]] did in fact arise from West seeing ''Ray'' with his friend [[John Mayer]].<ref name=Gold/> Foxx's vocals were recorded over many takes; in one version he sang from start to finish, but the track was retracted as his performance didn't coincide well with the song's instrumentation. After recording another version, Foxx decided to re-record it once more as he felt it contained too many explicit lyrics.<ref name=Gold/> Once the track was finally in place, it was layered with additional instruments provided by American [[film score]] composer [[Jon Brion]] and individually selected by West. By the end of their very first studio session together, the pair had completed the basic tracks for the final version of \"Gold Digger\".<ref name=Pilot>{{cite web |author=Perez, Rodrigo |title=Kanye's Co-Pilot, Jon Brion, Talks About The Making Of Late Registration|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1507538/20050812/west_kanye.jhtml|work=[[MTV]] |publisher=[[MTV Networks]] |date=2005-08-12 |accessdate=2006-03-02}}</ref> Despite being a featured singer, Foxx's part only appears in the intro and the rest of the song uses West's vocals and samples of Charles.\n\n==Music and lyrics==\n\"Gold Digger\" contains samples (as well as an [[Interpolation (music)|interpolation]] during the introduction) of \"[[I Got a Woman]]\" by [[Ray Charles]], and a bouncy beat formed from handclaps and [[scratching|scratches]] by DJ [[A-Trak]].

Not wanting to let it go to waste, West decided to keep the beat for himself and add lyrics expressed from a male's point-of-view.<ref name=Gold/>\n\nThe second verse of \"Gold Digger\" was the first to be written, as West used to rap the verse in early 2004 while on tour promoting his debut album, ''[[The College Dropout]]''. The first verse was made later in the year while West was on [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]]'s Evolution Tour. Lastly, the original third verse was taken from an unreleased song called \"Drop Dead Gorgeous,\" which West had produced and rapped on for [[Murphy Lee]] of [[St. Lunatics]]. About a year later, right before \"Gold Digger\" was set to be released as a single, West decided to write a different third verse and in a week the new song was recorded and mastered at [[Sony Music Studios]] in [[New York City]].<ref name=Gold/>\n\nThe idea of employing Jamie Foxx specifically to sing an [[Interpolation (music)|interpolation]] of Ray Charles' \"[[I Got a Woman]]\" in place of its initial [[Sampling (music)|sample]] did in fact arise from West seeing ''Ray'' with his friend [[John Mayer]].<ref name=Gold/> Foxx's vocals were recorded over many takes; in one version he sang from start to finish, but the track was retracted as his performance didn't coincide well with the song's instrumentation. After recording another version, Foxx decided to re-record it once more as he felt it contained too many explicit lyrics.<ref name=Gold/> Once the track was finally in place, it was layered with additional instruments provided by American [[film score]] composer [[Jon Brion]] and individually selected by West. By the end of their very first studio session together, the pair had completed the basic tracks for the final version of \"Gold Digger\".<ref name=Pilot>{{cite web |author=Perez, Rodrigo |title=Kanye's Co-Pilot, Jon Brion, Talks About The Making Of Late Registration|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1507538/20050812/west_kanye.jhtml|work=[[MTV]] |publisher=[[MTV Networks]] |date=2005-08-12 |accessdate=2006-03-02}}</ref> Despite being a featured singer, Foxx's part only appears in the intro and the rest of the song uses West's vocals and samples of Charles.\n\n==Music and lyrics==\n\"Gold Digger\" contains samples (as well as an [[Interpolation (music)|interpolation]] during the introduction) of \"[[I Got a Woman]]\" by [[Ray Charles]], and a bouncy beat formed from handclaps and [[scratching|scratches]] by DJ [[A-Trak]].

It was filmed and produced at locations in France and Switzerland, and bases on the 1985 novel ''Sweetheart'' by [[Andrew Coburn (author)|Andrew Coburn]].\n\n== Plot ==\nThe French detective superintendent Christophe Vade (Patrick Bruel) investigates the murder of an elderly French couple in the [[French Alps]]. In the course of his investigation he encounters Jeanne Gardella (Mathilda May), the wife of the businessman Antoine Gardella (Jacques Dutronc), a member of organized crime, and the son of the murdered couple. Antoine Gardella and his wife Jeanne live harmoniously, but Jeanne Gardella was forced by Thurson (Vernon Dobtcheff), a dubious agent of [[Interpol]] to her \"role as wife\" in the context of an undercover action against the European [[organized crime]]. Despite his criminal background, Jeanne loves her husband. Thurson also urges Christophe Vade to investigate Gardella and his wife in connection with the murder of those parents, and to get an additional pressure medium to gouge Jeanne Gardella to continue that farce. Thurson does not explain that plan either to inspector Vade or Jeanne Gardella, who fell in love, finally tolerated by Antoine Gardella who accepts that his wife was forced to that undercover action by Thurson. Tightly interwoven with the main story, the subplot plays in the ''milieu'' of the Swiss city of Z\u00fcrich, and the advances of the brutal and corrupt city police officer Scatamacchia (Hans Heinz Moser) against a hostess allow a very personal view on Scandurat (Bruce Myers), Gardella's business partner and close friend. Finally, Vadella is forced to kill Vade and Jeanne, but refuses and choices suicide, to meet the unwritten rules within the organized crime.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Patrick Bruel]] as Christophe Vade \n* [[Jacques Dutronc]] as Antoine Gardella\n* [[Mathilda May]] as Jeanne Gardella \n* [[Sophie Broustal]] as Laura \n* [[Vernon Dobtcheff]] as Thurston \n* [[Bruce Myers (actor)|Bruce Myers]] as Scandurat \n* [[Jo\u00ebl Barbouth]] as Husquin \n* [[Christophe Brault]] as Blodgett \n* [[Eric Da Silva]] as Roselli \n* [[Jean Dautremay]] as Deckler \n* [[Jocelyn-Clair Durvel]] as Blue \n* [[Hans Heinz Moser]] as Scatamacchia \n* [[Michael Pas]] as Nordixen \n* [[Bernard Waver]] as Roger Silas \n* [[J\u00fcrgen Zwingel]] as Kimbler\n* [[Joseph Malerba]] as Inspector Nolo\n\n== Background and production ==\nThe film bases on the 1985 novel ''Sweetheart'' by [[Andrew Coburn (author)|Andrew Coburn]].

The single peaked at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Outside the United Kingdom, \"I'm Too Sexy\" topped the charts in six countries, including Australia, Ireland, and the United States.\n\n==Composition and recording==\nThe idea for the song came about when the Fairbrass brothers were running a gym in London where, according to Richard, there was \"lots of narcissism and posing\". One day, he took his shirt off and started singing \"I'm too sexy for my shirt\" in front of a mirror as a joke. The band originally recorded it as an [[indie rock]] song.\n\nIt was rejected by multiple record companies before they played it to [[Song plugger|radio plugger]] Guy Holmes. He was initially unimpressed after playing it on his car stereo, but his passengers latched onto the song's \"I'm a model, you know what I mean\" hook and Holmes asked the band if they could rework it as a dance track.\n\nDJ [[TommyD]], an acquaintance of Richard Fairbrass, programmed electronics around the original vocal, whilst guitarist Rob Manzoli added a riff borrowed from the [[Jimi Hendrix]] song \"[[Third Stone from the Sun]]\".<ref>{{cite news|first= Dave |last= Simpson |title= How we made Right Said Fred's I'm Too Sexy |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |date= 4 April 2017 |accessdate= 4 April 2017 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/apr/04/how-we-made-right-said-fred-im-too-sexy-interview}}</ref>\n\nIn the clubs, everyone imitated their \"catwalk\" dance as seen on the video clip by January 1992.<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Spotlight: Right Said Fred |magazine= [[Music & Media]] |volume= 9 |issue= 3 |page= 21 |date= 18 January 1992 |accessdate= 20 February 2020 |url= https://www.americanradiohistory.com/UK/Music-and-Media/90s/1992/MM-1992-01-18.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe single equalled the record for the most weeks at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]] without ever topping the chart, staying at number two for six weeks in a row while held back by [[Bryan Adams]]' \"[[(Everything I Do) I Do It for You]]\" (this equaled the previous record set by [[Pierre Kartner|Father Abraham]]'s hit of 1978 \"[[The Smurf Song]]\").\n\nIn May 1992, the song was nominated for an Ivor Novello Award for Best Selling 'A' Side.<ref>{{cite web|title= The Ivors 1992 > Best Selling 'A' Side |website= Theivors.com |accessdate= 9 September 2018 |url= http://theivors.com/archive/1990-1999/the-ivors-1992/ |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180104013937/http://theivors.com/archive/1990-1999/the-ivors-1992/ |archivedate= 4 January 2018 |url-status= dead}}</ref> \"I'm Too Sexy\" was the act's first of several hits, particularly in the United Kingdom.

The single peaked at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Outside the United Kingdom, \"I'm Too Sexy\" topped the charts in six countries, including Australia, Ireland, and the United States.\n\n==Composition and recording==\nThe idea for the song came about when the Fairbrass brothers were running a gym in London where, according to Richard, there was \"lots of narcissism and posing\". One day, he took his shirt off and started singing \"I'm too sexy for my shirt\" in front of a mirror as a joke. The band originally recorded it as an [[indie rock]] song.\n\nIt was rejected by multiple record companies before they played it to [[Song plugger|radio plugger]] Guy Holmes. He was initially unimpressed after playing it on his car stereo, but his passengers latched onto the song's \"I'm a model, you know what I mean\" hook and Holmes asked the band if they could rework it as a dance track.\n\nDJ [[TommyD]], an acquaintance of Richard Fairbrass, programmed electronics around the original vocal, whilst guitarist Rob Manzoli added a riff borrowed from the [[Jimi Hendrix]] song \"[[Third Stone from the Sun]]\".<ref>{{cite news|first= Dave |last= Simpson |title= How we made Right Said Fred's I'm Too Sexy |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |date= 4 April 2017 |accessdate= 4 April 2017 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/apr/04/how-we-made-right-said-fred-im-too-sexy-interview}}</ref>\n\nIn the clubs, everyone imitated their \"catwalk\" dance as seen on the video clip by January 1992.<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Spotlight: Right Said Fred |magazine= [[Music & Media]] |volume= 9 |issue= 3 |page= 21 |date= 18 January 1992 |accessdate= 20 February 2020 |url= https://www.americanradiohistory.com/UK/Music-and-Media/90s/1992/MM-1992-01-18.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe single equalled the record for the most weeks at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]] without ever topping the chart, staying at number two for six weeks in a row while held back by [[Bryan Adams]]' \"[[(Everything I Do) I Do It for You]]\" (this equaled the previous record set by [[Pierre Kartner|Father Abraham]]'s hit of 1978 \"[[The Smurf Song]]\").\n\nIn May 1992, the song was nominated for an Ivor Novello Award for Best Selling 'A' Side.<ref>{{cite web|title= The Ivors 1992 > Best Selling 'A' Side |website= Theivors.com |accessdate= 9 September 2018 |url= http://theivors.com/archive/1990-1999/the-ivors-1992/ |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180104013937/http://theivors.com/archive/1990-1999/the-ivors-1992/ |archivedate= 4 January 2018 |url-status= dead}}</ref> \"I'm Too Sexy\" was the act's first of several hits, particularly in the United Kingdom.

It is a [[new wave music|new wave]] and [[synth-pop]] song that features a synthesizer, electric guitar, bass guitar, and drums in its instrumentation. The apparently nonsensical lyrics have a common theme revolving around the ability to deal with one's problems by \"whipping it\". Co-written by bassist [[Gerald Casale]] and singer [[Mark Mothersbaugh]], Devo recorded \"Whip It\" with producer [[Robert Margouleff]] at the [[Record Plant]] in Los Angeles.\n\nAlthough \"Whip It\" was released as the second [[single (music)|single]] from ''Freedom of Choice'', [[Warner Bros. Records]] did not expect it to be a hit, due to its nonstandard [[tempo]] and strange lyrics. The [[disc jockey]] [[Kal Rudman]] took an interest in the song and it was soon being played on several radio stations in the [[Southeastern United States]]. Peaking at number fourteen on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], \"Whip It\" became a [[hit single]] and found chart success in several countries. Mothersbaugh believes the song sold well because some people assumed the lyrics are about [[masturbation]] or [[sadomasochism]].\n\nAn accompanying [[music video]] depicts these sexual themes; it features Mothersbaugh whipping clothing from a woman on a [[guest ranch|dude ranch]]. Despite some claims of misogynistic undertones, the video became popular on the fledgling television channel [[MTV]].\n\n==Background and recording==\n\nDevo's 1979 album ''[[Duty Now for the Future]]'' was considered a disappointment by critics and band members; critics regarded it as a formulaic repeat of the band's 1978 debut ''[[Are We Not Men? We Are Devo!|Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!]]'' and the band members primarily blamed the formulaic sound on the album's producer [[Ken Scott]].<ref name=\"Moskowitz\">{{cite book|first= David V. |last= Moskowitz |year= 2015 |title= The 100 Greatest Bands of All Time: A Guide to the Legends Who Rocked the World |publisher= [[ABC-CLIO]] |isbn= 978-1-4408-0340-6 |page= 215}}</ref>{{sfn|Nagy|2015|pp=19\u201320}} [[Warner Bros.

Mothersbaugh composed what became the song's [[break (music)|break]] in his bedroom; the break was originally much slower and had a [[classical music|classical]] sound.

Shortly into the tour, disc jockey [[Kal Rudman]] began playing \"Whip It\", and the song was soon being played on several radio stations in the Southeastern U.S. Within a week, \"Whip It\" had become so popular that Devo was forced to temporarily stop its tour to book larger venues because the concerts were selling out too quickly.{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=37}}\n\n\"Whip It\" debuted at number eighty-five on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] on August 30, 1980.<ref>{{cite web|title= The Hot 100 |magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= August 30, 1980 |accessdate= September 7, 2017 |url= http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1980-08-30}}</ref> It spent twenty-five weeks on the chart, peaked at number fourteen on November 15, 1980, and finished the year at number ninety-four on the [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1981|''Billboard'' Year-End singles chart]] for 1981.<ref name=\"US\"/><ref name=\"Year End\"/> In the U.S., the song also reached number thirteen on the [[Cashbox (magazine)|''Cash Box'' Top 100]],<ref name=\"CashBox\"/> number fourteen on the [[Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance Club Play]] chart,<ref name=\"Hot Dance\"/>{{efn|name=HD|group=upper-alpha}} and number seventeen on the [[Record World|''Record World'' Singles]] chart.<ref name=\"Record World\"/> \"Whip It\" found international success, peaking at number seventy-seven on the Australian [[Kent Music Report]],<ref name=\"Kent\"/> number eleven on the Canadian ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Top Singles chart,<ref name=\"CAN\"/> number eleven on the [[Official New Zealand Music Chart]],<ref name=\"NZ\"/> and number fifty-one on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"Thompson\"/> The song was [[Music recording sales certification|certified]] gold in the U.S. and Canada, denoting shipments of 1,000,000 and 75,000 copies respectively.<ref name=\"RIAA\"/><ref name=\"MC\"/>\n\nIn a retrospective review, Huey said the song has \"an irresistibly odd novelty appeal\" and that it was \"one of the best arguments that punk ideology didn't necessarily lose its bite when placed in the more pop-oriented musical context of new wave\".<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/> ''[[PopMatters]]''{{'}} Chris Gerard noted the song's originality and described it as \"a bold and provocative recording that still sounds fantastic blasted out of a good set of speakers\".<ref name=\"Gerard\">{{cite web|first= Chris |last= Gerard |title= The 100 Greatest Alternative Singles of the '80s: Part 3: 60 \u2013 41 |website= [[PopMatters]] |date= September 30, 2015 |accessdate= September 11, 2017 |url= https://www.popmatters.com/the-100-greatest-alternative-singles-of-the-80s-part-3-60-41-2495485637.html?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1}}</ref> The website subsequently ranked \"Whip It\" as the fifty-first best [[alternative rock|alternative]] song of the 1980s.<ref name=\"Gerard\"/>\n\nWhen \"Whip It\" was released, some listeners assumed the lyrics were [[double entendre]]s for [[masturbation]] or [[sadomasochism]].{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=33}} Devo's previous material often included sexual innuendos or blatant references to sex in the lyrics, which made \"Whip It\" appear consistent with this style of songwriting.{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=33}} Mothersbaugh said many disc jockeys would make masturbation jokes to him before interviews.{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=34}} At first, the band members attempted to dissuade them of this assumption but they eventually gave in and helped reinforce these misinterpretations.{{sfn|Majewski|Bernstein|2014|p=77}} Mothersbaugh believed a song about taboo subjects would receive more radio airplay and sell more copies.<ref>{{cite book|first= Deanna R. |last= Adams |year= 2002 |title= Rock 'n' Roll and the Cleveland Connection |publisher= [[Kent State University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-8733-8691-3 |page= 386}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\n[[File:Whip It Music Video.png|thumb|A screenshot from the \"Whip It\" music video in which Mothersbaugh uses a whip to remove a woman's  clothing while the other band members play in a cattle-pen.|alt=A  man wearing a black turtleneck and a red hat holds a whip while a woman in a black dress smoking a cigarette with a holder stands in front of him.

This was before the making of music videos had become standard industry practice, which confused label executives. When \"Whip It\" started to receive radio airplay, the record company embraced the concept and asked the band to produce a video for \"Whip It\" with a $15,000 budget.{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=37}} The idea for the video came from an article in a 1962 issue of ''[[The Dude (magazine)|The Dude]]'' magazine, which revolved around a former stuntman who marries a stripper and moves to a dude ranch in Arizona. For entertainment, the man would use a whip to remove the clothes from his wife, who would remain unhurt. Mothersbaugh stated; \"That's the kind of stuff that fed us creatively. It was just so stupid and so low, and yet so great.\"{{sfnm|1a1=Majewski|1a2=Bernstein|1y=2014|1p=77|2a1=Nagy|2y=2015|2p=38}}\n\nThe video was partially a reaction to Reagan's previous career as a [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] actor; Devo wanted to make a video that satirized both the cowboy mythos and \"right-wing racist values\".<ref name=\"Rip It Up\"/>{{sfn|Majewski|Bernstein|2014|p=78}} In the video, the whip does not strike the woman's clothes; they were tied to a fishing line and pulled away after each whip crack. The whip did, however, strike the cigarette holder to knock it out of her mouth.{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=39}} For the first few months after its release, the video was seen by a limited audience, primarily on late-night talk shows. The American television channel [[MTV]], which was  launched in 1981, gave the video so much exposure that it temporarily revived the song's popularity, shortly before the release of Devo's next album ''[[New Traditionalists]]'' (1981).{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=39}}\n\nThe video attracted  some controversy, particularly for its perceived misogynistic undertones. Casale said the band members intended the video to appear tasteless and demeaning but also funny.<ref name=\"Flavorwire\"/> The claims of misogyny increased when Devo was cut from a live performance on an episode of ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' hosted by [[Lily Tomlin]]. After watching the video, Tomlin refused to host the show unless Devo was cut.<ref name=\"Rhino\"/> There were also claims that MTV banned the video but these claims were ultimately proven false.<ref name=\"Moskowitz\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nSeveral journalists view \"Whip It\" as a cornerstone of the development of new wave music in the early 1980s.{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=34}}<ref name=\"Chiu\"/><ref name=\"Harrison\">{{cite book|first= Thomas |last= Harrison |year= 2017 |title= Pop Goes the Decade: The Eighties |publisher= [[ABC-CLIO]] |isbn= 978-1-4408-3667-1 |page= 87}}</ref> In his book ''Pop Goes the Decade: The Eighties'', Thomas Harrison wrote that the song introduced heavily synthesized music to a mainstream audience while music critic Evie Nagy called it a \"defining anthem of new wave's rise\".{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=34}}<ref name=\"Harrison\"/> The majority of new wave music in the early 1980s was produced by British bands.

Undoubtedly the band's most recognizable song, 'Whip It' elevated Devo from an underground art-rock outfit to a (briefly) mainstream pop act, albeit one that still retained its pointed and satirical view of society. And, of course, who can forget the song's surrealist and now-iconic video that was a staple of MTV during the then-fledgling channel's early years?

Devo, however, eventually developed a troubled relationship with the channel. Most of the band's subsequent videos were censored for controversial content or were rejected because the song was not a hit single.

It is a [[new wave music|new wave]] and [[synth-pop]] song that features a synthesizer, electric guitar, bass guitar, and drums in its instrumentation. The apparently nonsensical lyrics have a common theme revolving around the ability to deal with one's problems by \"whipping it\". Co-written by bassist [[Gerald Casale]] and singer [[Mark Mothersbaugh]], Devo recorded \"Whip It\" with producer [[Robert Margouleff]] at the [[Record Plant]] in Los Angeles.\n\nAlthough \"Whip It\" was released as the second [[single (music)|single]] from ''Freedom of Choice'', [[Warner Bros. Records]] did not expect it to be a hit, due to its nonstandard [[tempo]] and strange lyrics. The [[disc jockey]] [[Kal Rudman]] took an interest in the song and it was soon being played on several radio stations in the [[Southeastern United States]]. Peaking at number fourteen on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], \"Whip It\" became a [[hit single]] and found chart success in several countries. Mothersbaugh believes the song sold well because some people assumed the lyrics are about [[masturbation]] or [[sadomasochism]].\n\nAn accompanying [[music video]] depicts these sexual themes; it features Mothersbaugh whipping clothing from a woman on a [[guest ranch|dude ranch]]. Despite some claims of misogynistic undertones, the video became popular on the fledgling television channel [[MTV]].\n\n==Background and recording==\n\nDevo's 1979 album ''[[Duty Now for the Future]]'' was considered a disappointment by critics and band members; critics regarded it as a formulaic repeat of the band's 1978 debut ''[[Are We Not Men? We Are Devo!|Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!]]'' and the band members primarily blamed the formulaic sound on the album's producer [[Ken Scott]].<ref name=\"Moskowitz\">{{cite book|first= David V. |last= Moskowitz |year= 2015 |title= The 100 Greatest Bands of All Time: A Guide to the Legends Who Rocked the World |publisher= [[ABC-CLIO]] |isbn= 978-1-4408-0340-6 |page= 215}}</ref>{{sfn|Nagy|2015|pp=19\u201320}} [[Warner Bros.

Warner Bros. heavily favored the commercial viability of the first single \"[[Girl U Want]]\" because its music and lyrics were more radio-friendly and akin to \"[[My Sharona]]\" by [[the Knack]].<ref name=\"Chiu\">{{cite web|first= David |last= Chiu |title= 'Freedom of Choice' Is What You Got: A New Look at Devo's 1980 Hit Album |website= [[PopMatters]] |date= May 21, 2015 |accessdate= September 11, 2017 |url= https://www.popmatters.com/193489-freedom-of-choice-is-what-you-got-new-book-looks-at-devos-1980-hit-a-2495529894.html}}</ref> \"Girl U Want\" failed to reach any record chart and was considered a failure.{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=36}} Despite this initial failure, Devo decided to tour in support of the album without a hit single. Shortly into the tour, disc jockey [[Kal Rudman]] began playing \"Whip It\", and the song was soon being played on several radio stations in the Southeastern U.S. Within a week, \"Whip It\" had become so popular that Devo was forced to temporarily stop its tour to book larger venues because the concerts were selling out too quickly.{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=37}}\n\n\"Whip It\" debuted at number eighty-five on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] on August 30, 1980.<ref>{{cite web|title= The Hot 100 |magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= August 30, 1980 |accessdate= September 7, 2017 |url= http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1980-08-30}}</ref> It spent twenty-five weeks on the chart, peaked at number fourteen on November 15, 1980, and finished the year at number ninety-four on the [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1981|''Billboard'' Year-End singles chart]] for 1981.<ref name=\"US\"/><ref name=\"Year End\"/> In the U.S., the song also reached number thirteen on the [[Cashbox (magazine)|''Cash Box'' Top 100]],<ref name=\"CashBox\"/> number fourteen on the [[Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance Club Play]] chart,<ref name=\"Hot Dance\"/>{{efn|name=HD|group=upper-alpha}} and number seventeen on the [[Record World|''Record World'' Singles]] chart.<ref name=\"Record World\"/> \"Whip It\" found international success, peaking at number seventy-seven on the Australian [[Kent Music Report]],<ref name=\"Kent\"/> number eleven on the Canadian ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Top Singles chart,<ref name=\"CAN\"/> number eleven on the [[Official New Zealand Music Chart]],<ref name=\"NZ\"/> and number fifty-one on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"Thompson\"/> The song was [[Music recording sales certification|certified]] gold in the U.S. and Canada, denoting shipments of 1,000,000 and 75,000 copies respectively.<ref name=\"RIAA\"/><ref name=\"MC\"/>\n\nIn a retrospective review, Huey said the song has \"an irresistibly odd novelty appeal\" and that it was \"one of the best arguments that punk ideology didn't necessarily lose its bite when placed in the more pop-oriented musical context of new wave\".<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/> ''[[PopMatters]]''{{'}} Chris Gerard noted the song's originality and described it as \"a bold and provocative recording that still sounds fantastic blasted out of a good set of speakers\".<ref name=\"Gerard\">{{cite web|first= Chris |last= Gerard |title= The 100 Greatest Alternative Singles of the '80s: Part 3: 60 \u2013 41 |website= [[PopMatters]] |date= September 30, 2015 |accessdate= September 11, 2017 |url= https://www.popmatters.com/the-100-greatest-alternative-singles-of-the-80s-part-3-60-41-2495485637.html?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1}}</ref> The website subsequently ranked \"Whip It\" as the fifty-first best [[alternative rock|alternative]] song of the 1980s.<ref name=\"Gerard\"/>\n\nWhen \"Whip It\" was released, some listeners assumed the lyrics were [[double entendre]]s for [[masturbation]] or [[sadomasochism]].{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=33}} Devo's previous material often included sexual innuendos or blatant references to sex in the lyrics, which made \"Whip It\" appear consistent with this style of songwriting.{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=33}} Mothersbaugh said many disc jockeys would make masturbation jokes to him before interviews.{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=34}} At first, the band members attempted to dissuade them of this assumption but they eventually gave in and helped reinforce these misinterpretations.{{sfn|Majewski|Bernstein|2014|p=77}} Mothersbaugh believed a song about taboo subjects would receive more radio airplay and sell more copies.<ref>{{cite book|first= Deanna R. |last= Adams |year= 2002 |title= Rock 'n' Roll and the Cleveland Connection |publisher= [[Kent State University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-8733-8691-3 |page= 386}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\n[[File:Whip It Music Video.png|thumb|A screenshot from the \"Whip It\" music video in which Mothersbaugh uses a whip to remove a woman's  clothing while the other band members play in a cattle-pen.|alt=A  man wearing a black turtleneck and a red hat holds a whip while a woman in a black dress smoking a cigarette with a holder stands in front of him.

This was before the making of music videos had become standard industry practice, which confused label executives. When \"Whip It\" started to receive radio airplay, the record company embraced the concept and asked the band to produce a video for \"Whip It\" with a $15,000 budget.{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=37}} The idea for the video came from an article in a 1962 issue of ''[[The Dude (magazine)|The Dude]]'' magazine, which revolved around a former stuntman who marries a stripper and moves to a dude ranch in Arizona. For entertainment, the man would use a whip to remove the clothes from his wife, who would remain unhurt. Mothersbaugh stated; \"That's the kind of stuff that fed us creatively. It was just so stupid and so low, and yet so great.\"{{sfnm|1a1=Majewski|1a2=Bernstein|1y=2014|1p=77|2a1=Nagy|2y=2015|2p=38}}\n\nThe video was partially a reaction to Reagan's previous career as a [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] actor; Devo wanted to make a video that satirized both the cowboy mythos and \"right-wing racist values\".<ref name=\"Rip It Up\"/>{{sfn|Majewski|Bernstein|2014|p=78}} In the video, the whip does not strike the woman's clothes; they were tied to a fishing line and pulled away after each whip crack. The whip did, however, strike the cigarette holder to knock it out of her mouth.{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=39}} For the first few months after its release, the video was seen by a limited audience, primarily on late-night talk shows. The American television channel [[MTV]], which was  launched in 1981, gave the video so much exposure that it temporarily revived the song's popularity, shortly before the release of Devo's next album ''[[New Traditionalists]]'' (1981).{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=39}}\n\nThe video attracted  some controversy, particularly for its perceived misogynistic undertones. Casale said the band members intended the video to appear tasteless and demeaning but also funny.<ref name=\"Flavorwire\"/> The claims of misogyny increased when Devo was cut from a live performance on an episode of ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' hosted by [[Lily Tomlin]]. After watching the video, Tomlin refused to host the show unless Devo was cut.<ref name=\"Rhino\"/> There were also claims that MTV banned the video but these claims were ultimately proven false.<ref name=\"Moskowitz\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nSeveral journalists view \"Whip It\" as a cornerstone of the development of new wave music in the early 1980s.{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=34}}<ref name=\"Chiu\"/><ref name=\"Harrison\">{{cite book|first= Thomas |last= Harrison |year= 2017 |title= Pop Goes the Decade: The Eighties |publisher= [[ABC-CLIO]] |isbn= 978-1-4408-3667-1 |page= 87}}</ref> In his book ''Pop Goes the Decade: The Eighties'', Thomas Harrison wrote that the song introduced heavily synthesized music to a mainstream audience while music critic Evie Nagy called it a \"defining anthem of new wave's rise\".{{sfn|Nagy|2015|p=34}}<ref name=\"Harrison\"/> The majority of new wave music in the early 1980s was produced by British bands.

Undoubtedly the band's most recognizable song, 'Whip It' elevated Devo from an underground art-rock outfit to a (briefly) mainstream pop act, albeit one that still retained its pointed and satirical view of society. And, of course, who can forget the song's surrealist and now-iconic video that was a staple of MTV during the then-fledgling channel's early years? The fact that ''[[The Simpsons]]'' even paid homage to both the song and the video in an episode demonstrates how much 'Whip It' has transcended pop culture.|source=David Chiu of ''[[PopMatters]]'', discussing the song's legacy.<ref name=\"Chiu\"/>|width=30em|quoted=1}}\n\nThe song's popularity can be largely attributed to its distinct originality.

Devo, however, eventually developed a troubled relationship with the channel. Most of the band's subsequent videos were censored for controversial content or were rejected because the song was not a hit single.

They discover the body of [[Polynices]], a warlord in the recently ended civil war and brother of Antigone and Ismene. Meanwhile, Ismene and the new female president of Thebes, Eurydice, widow of [[Creon]] and head of an all-female cabinet (except for the minister of Education, who is a '[[tokenism|token]] man'), get ready for the arrival of Theseus, first citizen of the powerful democratic state of Athens. He is on his way for talks with Eurydice regarding aid to rebuild Thebes after the civil war. The cabinet's Justice Minister spends the same time gathering testimonies from victims of the civil war, such as Polykleitos, whose son died in the war. The champion athlete, war criminal and warlord Tydeus ran against Eurydice in the election and is now leader of the opposition, but he spends the time before Theseus' arrival plotting to take back power with his lover, Polynices' widow Pargeia. The Justice Minister then arrives to accuse Tydeus of war crimes, and Pargeia of embezzling charity funds.\n\nEurydice is informed of the body's discovery and goes to see it. Theseus arrives by helicopter and is irked by Eurydice's late arrival and the mysterious warnings of the blind hermaphrodite Tiresias. He puts up a friendly front, however, and goes with Eurydice to her public inauguration. There she announces that she will refuse Polynices' body burial and Tydeus suffers or feigns possession by the god [[Dionysus]]. The following night Theseus makes a pass at Eurydice and is rebuffed, and also keeps up to date with his wife [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]] and his son [[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolytus]]. In the meantime Antigone makes an attempt to bury her brother but is stopped and captured by Miletus and his soldiers.\n\nThe following morning sees the start of aid talks between Theseus and Eurydice. Miletus and his soldiers arrive at the senate with Antigone and Theseus's white aide Talthybia comes out to see what is going on, only to be mistaken for a ghost by Scud, who pulls a gun on her. Theseus rushes out with Phaex and his other bodyguards to see what is going on, but only exacerbates the situation, with Megeara pulling a gun on them. In the ensuing stand-off, Scud is accidentally shot dead by Phaex and the aid talks break down. Tydeus and Pargeia see their chance and begin to win over Theseus to their side, whilst Eurydice decides that her refusal to bury Polynices has brought the disaster on herself. She has Scud and Polynices buried in one grave and goes back to Theseus.\n\nTheseus seems to have almost gone over to Tydeus' side when Eurydice's justice minister produces Polykleitos, who gives evidence against Tydeus as a war criminal and speaks about how Tydeus killed his son. Tydeus plans to cause an uprising, but is then knifed to death by Megeara, whose fellow villagers had been killed by his troops. Theseus then receives news of Phaedra's suicide and curses his son, who he thinks has brought about the suicide. Antigone in the meantime accepts a proposal of marriage from Eurydice's blinded son Haemon. In a state of shock at news of the suicide, Theseus agrees to invite Eurydice to Athens and resume the talks there. Miletus and Megeara then decide to travel to Athens to try their fortunes there.\n\n==Literary references==\n*The play draws its plot on Polynices' burial from Sophocles' ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'', though it substitutes Creon's widow Eurydice for Creon.\n*Theseus receives news by mobile phone of his wife [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]], her incestuous love for his son by a previous marriage [[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolytus]] and its aftermath, all drawing on Euripides' ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]''.\n*The women of Thebes are mentioned to have held a 'sex strike' to bring an end to the civil war, drawing on Aristophanes' ''[[Lysistrata]]''.\n\n==Cast (premiere production)==\n<!---Only link characters based on mythological ones--->\n* [[Eurydice of Thebes|Eurydice]] \u2013 [[Nikki Amuka-Bird]]\n* Megeara \u2013 [[Madeline Appiah]]\n* Pargeia, widow of [[Polynices]] \u2013 [[Rakie Ayola]]\n* Junior Lieutenant Scud \u2013 [[Omar Brown (actor)|Omar Brown]] / [[Rene Gray]]\n* Talthybia \u2013 [[Jacqueline Defferary]]\n* [[Theseus]] \u2013 [[David Harewood]]\n* [[Ismene]] \u2013 [[Tracy Ifeachor]]\n* [[Tydeus|Prince Tydeus]] \u2013 [[Chuk Iwuji]]\n* Harmonia \u2013 [[Alexia Khadime]]\n* Phaeax \u2013 [[Ferdinand Kingsley]]\n* Aglaea \u2013 [[Aicha Kossoko]]\n* [[Haemon]] \u2013 [[Simon Manyonda]]\n* [[Tiresias]] \u2013 [[Bruce Myers (actor)|Bruce Myers]]\n* Euphrosyne \u2013 [[Pamela Nomvete]]\n* Polykleitos \u2013 [[Daniel Poyser]]\n* Thalia \u2013 [[Joy Richardson]]\n* [[Antigone]] \u2013 [[Vinette Robinson]]\n* Sergeant Miletus \u2013 [[Michael Wildman]]\n* Ensemble \u2013 [[Jessie Burton]], [[Daniel Fine]], [[Karlina Grace]], [[Irma Inniss]], [[Cornelius Macarthy]], [[Clare Perkins]], [[Victor Power (actor)|Victor Power]], [[Zara Tempest Walters]]\n\n==Reception==\n\n{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/57271/productions/welcome-to-thebes.html National Theatre site]\n\n[[Category:2010 plays]]\n[[Category:Plays by Moira Buffini]]\n[[Category:Theban mythology]]\n[[Category:Plays based on Greek and Roman plays]]\n[[Category:British plays]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=July 2010}}\n{{EngvarB|date=September 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2013}}\n{{Infobox play\n| name       = Welcome to Thebes\n| image      = Welcome to thebes.jpg\n| image_size =\n| caption    = Welcome to Thebes promotional poster\n| writer     = [[Moira Buffini]]\n| chorus     =\n| characters = [[Welcome to Thebes#Cast (premiere production)|See below]]\n| mute       =\n| setting    =\n| premiere   =\n| place      =\n| orig_lang  = English\n| series     =\n| subject    =\n| genre      = Tragedy\n| web        =\n}}\n:''For the novel of this title by [[Glendon Swarthout]], see [[Welcome to Thebes (novel)]].''\n\n'''''Welcome to Thebes''''' is a 2010 play by [[Moira Buffini]].
