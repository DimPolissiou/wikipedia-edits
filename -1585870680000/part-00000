He continues:\n\n<blockquote>\n\nThe more closely we look into history, the more clearly shall we perceive that the system of chivalry is an invention almost entirely poetical. It is impossible to distinguish the countries in which it is said to have prevailed. It is always represented as distant from us both in time and place, and whilst the contemporary historians give us a clear, detailed, and complete account of the vices of the court and the great, of the ferocity or corruption of the nobles, and of the servility of the people, we are astonished to find the poets, after a long lapse of time, adorning the very same ages with the most splendid fictions of grace, virtue, and loyalty. The romance writers of the twelfth century placed the age of chivalry in the time of Charlemagne. The period when these writers existed, is the time pointed out by [[Francis I of France|Francis I]]. At the present day [about 1810], we imagine we can still see chivalry flourishing in the persons of [[Du Guesclin]] and [[Pierre Terrail, seigneur de Bayard|Bayard]], under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and Francis I. But when we come to examine either the one period or the other, although we find in each some heroic spirits, we are forced to confess that it is necessary to antedate the age of chivalry, at least three or four centuries before any period of authentic history.<ref name=Sismondi/>{{rp|I, 79}}\n\n</blockquote>\n\n==History==\n{{Further|Knight|Orders of knighthood}}\nHistorian of chivalry Richard W. Kaeuper, saw chivalry as a central focus in the study of the European Middle Ages that was too often presented as a civilizing and stabilizing influence in the turbulent Middle Ages. On the contrary, Kaueper argues \"that in the problem of public order the knights themselves played an ambivalent, problematic role and that the guides to their conduct that chivalry provided were in themselves complex and problematic.\"<ref>Richard W. Kaeuper, ''Chivalry and Violence in Medieval Europe'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), 3</ref> Many of the codes and ideals of chivalry were of course contradictory, however, when knights did live up to them, they did not lead to a more \"ordered and peaceful society\". The tripartite conception of medieval European society (those who pray, those who fight, and those who work) along with other linked subcategories of monarchy and aristocracy, worked in congruence with knighthood to reform the institution in an effort \"to secure public order in a society just coming into its mature formation.\"<ref>Kaeuper, ''Chivalry and Violence in Medieval Europe'',4</ref> \n\nKaeuper makes clear that knighthood and the worldview of \"those who fight\" was pre-Christian in many ways and outside the purview of the church, at least initially. The church saw it as a duty to reform and guide knights in a way that weathered the disorderly, martial, and chauvinistic elements of chivalry.<ref>Ibid, 62-83</ref> Royalty was a similar story, with knighthood at many points clashing with the sovereignty of the king over the conduct of warfare and personal disputes between knights and other knights (and even between knights and aristocracy).<ref>Ibid, 93-97</ref> While the worldview of \"those who work\" (the burgeoning merchant class and bourgeoisie) was still in incubation, Kaeuper makes clear that the social and economic class that would end up defining modernity was fundamentally at odds with knights, and those with chivalrous valor saw the values of commerce as beneath them. Those who engaged in commerce and derived their value system from it could be confronted with violence by knights, if need be.<ref>Ibid, 121-139</ref>\n\nAccording to [[David Crouch (historian)|Crouch]], many early writers on medieval chivalry cannot be trusted as historians, because they sometimes have \"polemical purpose which colours their prose\".<ref name=\"Crouch_7\">{{harvp|Crouch|2005|p=7}}</ref> As for [[Kenelm Henry Digby]] and [[L\u00e9on Gautier]], chivalry was a means to transform their corrupt and secular worlds.<ref name=\"Crouch_8\">{{harvp|Crouch|2005|p=8}}</ref> Gautier also emphasized that chivalry originated from the Teutonic forests and was brought up into civilization by the [[Catholic]] Church.<ref>{{harvp|Crouch|2005|p=12}}</ref> Charles Mills used chivalry \"to demonstrate that the Regency gentleman was the ethical heir of a great moral estate, and to provide an inventory of its treasure\".<ref name=\"Crouch_8\" /> Mills also stated that chivalry was a social, not a military phenomenon, with its key features: generosity, fidelity, liberality, and courtesy.<ref>{{harvp|Crouch|2005|pp=10\u201311}}</ref>\n\n=== Europe before 1170: the noble ''habitus'' ===\nAccording to Crouch, prior to codified chivalry there was the uncodified code of noble conduct that focused on the ''preudomme''.{{explain|date=November 2018}} This uncodified code&nbsp;\u2013 referred to as the noble ''habitus''&nbsp;\u2013 is a term for the environment of behavioural and material expectations generated by all societies and classes.<ref>{{harvp|Crouch|2005|p=52}}</ref> As a modern idea, it was pioneered by the French philosopher/sociologists [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], even though a precedent exists for the concept as far back as the works of Aristotle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minerva.mic.ul.ie//vol7/moral.html|title=MORAL CHARACTER: HEXIS, HABITUS AND 'HABIT'}}</ref> Crouch argues that the ''habitus'' on which \"the superstructure of chivalry\" was built and the ''preudomme'' was a part, had existed long before 1100, while the codified medieval noble conduct only began between 1170 and 1220.<ref>{{harvp|Crouch|2005|p=53}}</ref>\n\nThe pre-chivalric noble ''habitus'' as discovered by Mills and Gautier are as follows:\n# '''Loyalty''': It is a practical utility in a warrior nobility. [[Richard Kaeuper]] associates loyalty with ''prowess''.<ref name=\"Crouch_56\">{{harvp|Crouch|2005|p=56}}</ref> The importance of reputation for loyalty in noble conduct is demonstrated in William Marshal biography.<ref name=\"Crouch_56\"/>\n# '''Forbearance''': knights' self-control towards other warriors and at the courts of their lords was a part of the early noble ''habitus'' as shown in the ''Conventum'' of [[Hugh IV of Lusignan|Hugh de Lusignan]] in the 1020s.<ref name=\"auto\">{{harvp|Crouch|2005|p=63}}</ref> The nobility of mercy and forbearance was well established by the second half of the 12th century long before there was any code of chivalry.<ref>{{harvp|Crouch|2005|p=65}}</ref>\n# '''Hardihood''': Historians and social anthropologists{{who?|date=March 2020}} have documented the fact physical resilience and aptitude in warfare in the earliest formative period of \"proto-chivalry,\" was, to contemporary warriors, almost essential of chivalry-defined knighthood (saving the implicit Christian-Davidic ethical framework) and for a warrior of any origin, even the lowliest, to demonstrate outstanding physicality-based prowess on the battlefield was seen as near certainty of noble-knightly status or grounds for immediate nobilitation. To deliver a powerful blow in Arthurian literature almost always certifies of the warrior's nobility. Formal chivalric authorities and commentators were hardly in dispute: the anonymous author of ''La vraye noblesse'', states if the prince or civic authority incarnate sees a man of \"low degree\" but of noble (i.e., martially imposing in the medieval context) bearing, he should promote him to nobility \"even though he be not rich or of noble lineage\": the \"poor companion\" who distinguishes themselves in worldly, incarnadine valor should be \"publicly rewarded.\" As the erudite scholastic analyst modernly viewing these matters, Richard Kaeuper summarizes the matter: \"A knight's nobility or worth is proved by his hearty strokes in battle\" (''Chivalry and Violence in Medieval Europe'', p.&nbsp;131). The quality of sheer hardihood aligns itself with forbearance and loyalty in being one of the military virtues of the ''preudomme''. According to Philip de Navarra, a mature nobleman should have acquired hardiness as part of his moral virtues. Geoffrey de Charny also stressed on the masculine respectability of hardiness in the light of religious feeling of the [[contemptus mundi]].<ref>{{harvp|Crouch|2005|p=67}}</ref>\n# '''''Largesse''''' or '''Liberality''': generosity was part of a noble quantity. According to [[Alan of Lille]], ''largesse'' was not just a simple matter of giving away what he had, but \"Largitas in a man caused him to set no store on greed or gifts, and to have nothing but contempt for bribes.\"<ref>{{harvp|Crouch|2005|pp=69\u201370}}</ref>\n# '''The Davidic ethic''': It is the strongest qualities of ''preudomme'' derived by clerics from [[Bible|Biblical tradition]]. The classical-Aristotelian concept of the \"magnanimous personality\" in the conceptual formulation of the notion here is not without relevance, additionally, nor likewise the early-Germanic and Norse tradition of the war-band leader as the heroic, anti-materialistic \"enemy of gold\". Formally, the Christian-Davidic guardian-protector role concept of warrior-leadership was extensively articulated initially by the [[Franks|Frankish]] church which involved legitimizing rightful authority, first and foremost, on the basis of any would-be warrior-headman being ethically committed to the protection of the weak and helpless (pointedly, the Church and affiliated organizations are here implied primarily if not exclusively), respect and provisioning of justice for widows and orphans, and a Christian idealism-inspired, no-nonsense, principle-based militant opposition to the encroachments of overweening cruel and unjust personages wielding power, whether in the form of unruly, \"black knight\" or \"robber-baron\"-like local sub-princely magistrates, or even in the context of conceiving the hypothetical overthrow of a monarch who had usurped and violated the ''lex primordialis'' or ''lex naturae'' of God in his domain by decreeing or permitting immoral customs or laws and thus self-dethroning themselves meta-ethically, inviting tyrannicidal treatment.<ref>{{harvp|Crouch|2005|pp=71\u201372}}</ref> The core of Davidic ethic is benevolence of the strong toward the weak.<ref>{{harvp|Crouch|2005|p=78}}</ref> Although a somewhat later authority in this specific context, John of Salisbury imbibed this lineage of philosophico-clerical, chivalric justifications of power, and excellently describes the ideal enforcer of the Davidic ethic here: \"The [warrior-]prince accordingly is the minister of the common interest and the bond-servant of equity, and he bears the public person in the sense that he punishes the wrongs and injuries of all, and all crimes, with even-handed equity. His rod and staff also, administered with wise moderation, restore irregularities and false departures to the straight path of equity, so that deservedly may the Spirit congratulate the power of the prince with the words, 'Thy rod and thy staff, they have comforted me.' [Psalm 23:4] His shield, too, is strong, but it is a shield for the protection of the weak, and one which wards off powerfully the darts of the wicked from the innocent. Those who derive the greatest advantage from his performance of the duties of his office are those who can do least for themselves, and his power is chiefly exercised against those who desire to do harm. Therefore not without reason he bears a sword, wherewith he sheds blood blamelessly, without becoming thereby a man of blood, and frequently puts men to death without incurring the name or guilt of homicide.\"{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n# '''Honour''': [[honour]] was what was achieved by living up to the ideal of the ''preudomme'' and pursuing the qualities and behaviour listed above.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{harvp|Crouch|2005|p=79}}</ref> [[Maurice Keen]] notes the most damning, irreversible mode of \"demoting\" one's honorific status, again humanly through contemporary eyes, consisted in displaying pusillanimous conduct on the battlefield.

[[Bertran de Born]] said: \"For myself I prefer to hold a little piece of land in ''onor'', than to hold a great empire with dishonor\".<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nThe code of chivalry, as it was known during the late Medieval age, developed between 1170 and 1220.<ref>{{harvp|Crouch|2005|p=80}}</ref>\n\n===Origins in military ethos===\n[[File:Roman Museum 007.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of a [[Roman cavalry]]man (''[[Equites|eques]]'')]]\nChivalry was developed in the north of France around the mid-12th century but adopted its structure in a European context.

Related to chivalry was the practice of [[heraldry]] and its elaborate rules of displaying coats of arms as it emerged in the [[High Middle Ages]].\n\n===Chivalry and Christianity===\n{{Further|Knightly Piety}}\n\nChristianity and church had a modifying influence on the classical concept of heroism and virtue, nowadays identified with the virtues of chivalry.<ref>{{harvp|Corr\u00eaa de Oliveira|1993|p=10}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Keen|2005|p=56}}</ref> The [[Peace and Truce of God]] in the 10th century was one such example, with limits placed on knights to protect and honour the weaker members of society and also help the church maintain peace. At the same time the church became more tolerant of war in the defence of faith, espousing theories of the [[just war]]; and [[liturgies]] were introduced which blessed a knight's sword, and a bath of chivalric purification. In the story of the [[Grail]] romances and ''Chevalier au Cygne'', it was the confidence of the Christian knighthood that its way of life was to please God, and chivalry was an order of God.<ref>{{harvp|Keen|2005|p=62}}</ref> Thus, chivalry as a Christian vocation was a result of marriage between [[Teutons|Teutonic]] heroic values with the militant tradition of [[Old Testament]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe first noted support for chivalric vocation, or the establishment of knightly class to ensure the sanctity and legitimacy of Christianity, was written in 930 by [[Odo of Cluny|Odo]], abbot of [[Cluny]], in the ''Vita of St. Gerald of Aurillac'', which argued that the sanctity of Christ and Christian doctrine can be demonstrated through the legitimate unsheathing of the \"sword against the enemy\".<ref>{{cite book|title=\"The Life of St. Gerald, by Odo\".|year=1954|publisher=Penn State Press|page=371}}</ref> In the 11th century the concept of a \"knight of Christ\" (''miles Christi'') gained currency in France, Spain and Italy.<ref name=sweeney/> These concepts of \"religious chivalry\" were further elaborated in the era of the [[Crusades]], with the Crusades themselves often being seen as a chivalrous enterprise.<ref name=sweeney/> Their ideas of chivalry were also further influenced by [[Saladin]], who was viewed as a chivalrous knight by medieval Christian writers. The [[Military order (society)|military order]]s of the crusades which developed in this period came to be seen as the earliest flowering of chivalry,<ref>Chivalry, Britannica Encyclopedia</ref> although it remains unclear to what extent the notable knights of this period\u2014such as [[Saladin]], [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], [[William Marshal]] or [[Bertrand du Guesclin]]\u2014actually did set new standards of knightly behaviour, or to what extent they merely behaved according to existing models of conduct which came in retrospect to be interpreted along the lines of the \"chivalry\" ideal of the Late Middle Ages.<ref name=sweeney/> Nevertheless, chivalry and crusades were not the same thing. While the crusading ideology had largely influenced the ethic of chivalry during its formative times, chivalry itself was related to a whole range of martial activities and aristocratic values which had no necessary linkage with crusading.<ref>{{harvp|Keen|2005|pp=44\u201345}}</ref>\n\n===Medieval literature and the influence of the Moors and Romans===\nFrom the 12th century onward chivalry came to be understood as a moral, religious and social code of knightly conduct. The particulars of the code varied, but codes would emphasise the virtues of courage, honour, and service. Chivalry also came to refer to an idealisation of the life and manners of the knight at home in his castle and with his court.\n\nEuropean chivalry owed much to the chivalry of the [[Moors]] (Muslims) in Spain, or [[al-Andalus]] as they called it. were greatly influenced by Arabic literature. \"Chivalry was the most prominent characteristic of the Muslim 'Moors' who conquered the [[Iberian Peninsula]]...beginning in 711 AD. In classical Arab culture, to become a genuine Knight (F\u00e1ris) (\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633), one had to master the virtues of dignity, eloquence, gentleness, horsemanship and artistic talents, as well as strength and skill with weaponry. These ancient chivalric virtues were promoted by the Moors, who comprised the majority population of the Iberian Peninsula by 1100 AD, and their ancient Arabian contributions to Chivalry quickly spread throughout Europe.\"<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Muslim Saracen Chivalry as Templar Heritage.

The famous Spanish author [[Vicente Blasco Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez|Blasco Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez]]  says: \"Europe did not know chivalry, or its adopted literature or sense of honour before the arrival of Arabs in Andalusia and the wide presence of their knights and heroes in the countries of the south.\"\n\nThe Andalusian [[Ibn Hazm]] and his famous book ''[[The Ring of the Dove]]'' (''Tawq al-\u1e24am\u0101mah'') had a great impact on poets in Spain and southern France after the Islamic community blended with the Christian community.{{dubious|date=June 2019}} The [[Arabic]] language was the language of the country and the language of the high-class people. In many Christian Spanish provinces, [[Christians|Christian]] and [[Muslim]] poets used to meet at the court of the governor. The European poets at the time were good at composing Arabic poetry. For this reason, [[Henry Maro]] says: \"The Arab impact on the civilization of the Roman peoples did not stop at fine arts only, but extended to music and poetry as well.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe influence of Arabic literature on European writers is proven by what [[Reinhart Dozy]] quoted on his book ''Spanish Islam: History of Moslems in Spain'', of the Spanish writer AlGharo,{{who|date=June 2019}} who deeply regretted the neglect of Latin and Greek and the acceptance of the language of the Muslims, he said, \"The intelligent and eloquent people are bewitched by the sound of Arabic and they look down on Latin. They have started to write in the language of those who defeated them.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nA contemporary of his, who was more influenced by nationalistic feelings, expressed his bitterness when he{{who|date=June 2019}} said:\n\n<blockquote>My Christian brothers admire the poetry and'' chivalry ''stories of the [[Arabs]], and they study the books written by the philosophies and scholars of the Muslims. They do not do that in order to refute them, but rather to learn the eloquent Arabic style. Where today \u2013 apart from the clergy \u2013 are those who read the religious commentaries on the Old and New Testaments? Where are those who read [[the Gospels]] and the words of the Prophets? Alas, the new generation of intelligent Christians do not know any literature and language well apart from Arabic literature and the Arabic language. They avidly read the books of the Arabs and amass huge libraries of these books at great expense; they look upon these Arabic treasures with great pride, at the time when they refrain from reading Christian books on the basis that they are not worth paying attention to. How unfortunate it is that the Christians have forgotten their language, and nowadays you cannot find among them one in a thousand who could write a letter to a friend in his own language. But with regard to the language of the Arabs, how many there are who express themselves fluently in it with the most eloquent style, and they write poetry of the Arabs themselves in its eloquence and correct usage.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}</blockquote>\n\nMedieval courtly literature glorifies the valour, tactics, and ideals of both [[Moors]] and ancient Romans.<ref name=\"sweeney\" /> For example, the ancient hand-book of warfare written by [[Vegetius]] called ''[[De re militari]]'' was translated into French in the 13th century as ''L'Art de chevalerie'' by [[Jean de Meun]]. Later writers also drew from Vegetius, such as Honor\u00e9 Bonet, who wrote the 14th century ''L'Arbes des batailles'', which discussed the morals and laws of war. In the 15th century [[Christine de Pizan]] combined themes from Vegetius, Bonet, and Frontinus in ''Livre des faits d'armes et de chevalerie''.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nIn the later Middle Ages, wealthy merchants strove to adopt chivalric attitudes - the sons of the bourgeoisie were educated at aristocratic courts where they were trained in the manners of the knightly class.<ref name=sweeney/> This was a democratisation of chivalry, leading to a new genre called the [[courtesy book]], which were guides to the behaviour of \"gentlemen\". Thus, the post-medieval gentlemanly code of the value of a man's honour, respect for women, and a concern for those less fortunate, is directly derived from earlier ideals of chivalry and historical forces which created it.<ref name=sweeney/>\n\nThe medieval development of chivalry, with the concept of the honour of a lady and the ensuing knightly devotion to it, not only derived from the thinking about the [[Virgin Mary]], but also contributed to it.<ref>{{harvp|Bromiley|1994|p=272}}</ref> The medieval veneration of the Virgin Mary was contrasted by the fact that ordinary women, especially those outside aristocratic circles, were looked down upon.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Although women were at times viewed as the source of evil, it was Mary who as mediator to God was a source of refuge for man. The development of medieval [[Mariology]] and the changing attitudes towards women paralleled each other and can best be understood in a common context.<ref>{{harvp|Tucker|1987|p=168}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ghent Altarpiece E - Knights of Christ.jpg|thumb|upright|''Knights of Christ'' by [[Jan van Eyck]]]]\nWhen examining [[medieval literature]], chivalry can be classified into three basic but overlapping areas:\n#Duties to countrymen and fellow Christians: this contains virtues such as mercy, courage, valour, fairness, protection of the weak and the poor, and in the servant-hood of the knight to his lord. This also brings with it the idea of being willing to give one's life for another's; whether he would be giving his life for a poor man or his lord.\n#Duties to God: this would contain being faithful to God, protecting the innocent, being faithful to the church, being the champion of good against evil, being generous and obeying God above the feudal lord.\n#Duties to women: this is probably the most familiar aspect of chivalry. This would contain what is often called courtly love, the idea that the knight is to serve a lady, and after her all other ladies. Most especially in this category is a general gentleness and graciousness to all women.\nThese three areas obviously overlap quite frequently in chivalry, and are often indistinguishable.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nDifferent weight given to different areas produced different strands of chivalry:\n#warrior chivalry, in which a knight's chief duty is to his lord, as exemplified by Sir [[Gawain]] in ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'' and ''[[The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnelle]]''\n#religious chivalry, in which a knight's chief duty is to protect the innocent and serve God, as exemplified by Sir [[Galahad]] or Sir [[Percival]] in the [[Holy Grail|Grail legends]].\n#courtly love chivalry, in which a knight's chief duty is to his own lady, and after her, all ladies, as exemplified by Sir [[Lancelot]] in his love for Queen [[Guinevere]] or Sir [[Tristan]] in his love for [[Iseult]]\n\n===Late Middle Ages===\nChivalry underwent a revival and elaboration of chivalric ceremonial and rules of [[etiquette]] in the 14th century that was examined by [[Johan Huizinga]], in ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages|The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'', in which he dedicates a full chapter to \"The idea of chivalry\". In contrasting the literary standards of chivalry with the actual warfare of the age, the historian finds the imitation of an ideal past illusory; in an aristocratic culture such as Burgundy and France at the close of the Middle Ages, \"to be representative of true culture means to produce by conduct, by customs, by manners, by costume, by deportment, the illusion of a heroic being, full of dignity and honour, of wisdom, and, at all events, of courtesy. ...The dream of past perfection ennobles life and its forms, fills them with beauty and fashions them anew as forms of art\".<ref>{{harvp|Huizinga|1924|p=\"Pessimism and the ideal of the sublime life\": 30}}</ref>\n\n===The end of chivalry===\nChivalry was dynamic and it transformed and adjusted in response to local situation and this is what probably led to its demise. There were many chivalric groups in [[England]] as imagined by [[Sir Thomas Malory]] when he wrote ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' in the late 15th century;<ref>{{harvp|Hodges|2005|p=5}}</ref> perhaps each group created each chivalric ideology. And Malory's perspective reflects the condition of 15th-century chivalry.<ref>{{harvp|Hodges|2005|p=7}}</ref> When [[Le Morte d'Arthur|''Le Morte Darthur'']] was printed, [[William Caxton]] urged knights to read the romance with an expectation that reading about chivalry could unite a community of knights already divided by the [[Wars of the Roses]].<ref>{{harvp|Hodges|2005|p=11}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor rule]] in [[England]], some knights still fought according to the ethos. Fewer knights were engaged in active warfare because battlefields during this century were generally the area of professional infantrymen, with less opportunity for knights to show chivalry.<ref>{{harvp|Gravett|2008|p=260}}</ref> It was the beginning of the demise of the knight. The rank of knight never faded, but it was [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] who ended the tradition that any knight could create another and made it exclusively the preserve of the monarch.<ref>{{harvp|Gravett|2008|p=267}}</ref> Christopher Wilkins contends that [[Edward Woodville|Sir Edward Woodville]], who rode from battle to battle across Europe and died in 1488 in [[Brittany]], was the last knight errant who witnessed the fall of the Age of Chivalry and the rise of modern European warfare.

The custom of foundation of [[chivalric order]]s by Europe's monarchs and high nobility peaked in the late medieval period, but it persisted during the Renaissance and well into the Baroque and early modern period, with e.g. the Tuscan [[Order of Saint Stephen]] (1561), the French [[Order of Saint Louis]] (1693) or the [[Anglo-Irish]] [[Order of St. Patrick]] (1783), and numerous [[Dynastic order of knighthood|dynastic orders of knighthood]] remain active in countries that retain a tradition of monarchy.\n\nAt the same time, with the change of courtly ideas during the [[Baroque period]], the ideals of chivalry began to be seen as dated, or \"medieval\". ''[[Don Quixote]]'', published in 1605\u201315, burlesqued the medieval chivalric novel or ''[[romance (heroic literature)|romance]]'' by ridiculing the stubborn adherence to the chivalric code in the face of the then-modern world as anachronistic, giving rise to the term [[Quixotism]]. Conversely, elements of [[Romanticism]] sought to revive such \"medieval\" ideals or aesthetics in the late 18th and early 19th century.\n\nThe behavioural code of military officers down to the [[Napoleonic era]], the [[American Civil War]] (especially as idealised in the \"[[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]]\" movement), and to some extent even to [[World War I]], was still strongly modelled on the historical ideals, resulting in a pronounced [[duel]]ling culture, which in some parts of Europe also held sway over the civilian life of the upper classes. With the [[decline of the Ottoman Empire]], however, the military threat from the \"infidel\" disappeared. The [[European wars of religion]] spanned much of the early modern period and consisted of infighting between factions of various Christian denominations. This process of [[confessionalization]] ultimately gave rise to a new military ethos based in [[nationalism]] rather than \"defending the faith against the infidel\".\n\nIn the American South in mid-19th century, [[John C. Breckinridge]] of Kentucky was hailed as the epitome of chivalry. He enjoyed a reputation for dignity and integrity, and especially his tall, graceful and handsome appearance, with piercing blue eyes and noble -looking expression, with cordial manner,  pleasing voice and eloquent address that was highly appreciated by voters, soldiers, and women alike.<ref> Grady  McWhiney, \"Breckenridge, John  Cabell\" in John  A. Garrity,  ed., ''Encyclopedia of American Biography '' (1975) pp 130-131. </ref>\n\nFrom the [[early modern period]], the term ''gallantry'' (from ''[[galant]]'', the [[Baroque period|Baroque]] ideal of refined elegance) rather than ''chivalry'' became used for the proper behaviour and acting of upper-class men towards upper-class women.\n\nIn the 19th century, there were attempts to revive chivalry for the purposes of the [[gentleman]] of that time.\n\n[[Kenelm Henry Digby]] wrote his ''[[The Broad-Stone of Honour]]'' for this purpose, offering the definition: 'Chivalry is only a name for that general spirit or state of mind which disposes men to heroic actions, and keeps them conversant with all that is beautiful and sublime in the intellectual and moral world'.\n\nThe pronouncedly masculine virtues of chivalry came under attack on the parts of the upper-class [[suffragettes]] campaigning for [[gender equality]] in the early 20th century,{{refn|\"The idea that men were to act and live deferentially on behalf of women and children, though an ancient principle, was already under attack by 1911 from militant suffragettes intent on leveling the political playing field by removing from the public mindset the notion that women were a 'weaker sex' in need of saving.\"<ref>[http://www.visionforumministries.org/issues/women_in_the_military/multigenerational_manhood.aspx ''The Birkenhead Drill''] by [[Doug Phillips]]</ref>|group=Note}} and with the decline of the military ideals of duelling culture and of European aristocracies in general following the catastrophe of [[World War I]], the ideals of chivalry became widely seen as outmoded by the mid-20th century.  As a material reflection of this process, the [[dress sword]] lost its position as an indispensable part of a gentleman's wardrobe, a development described as an \"archaeological terminus\" by [[Ewart Oakeshott]], as it concluded the long period during which the [[sword]] had been a visible attribute of the free man, beginning as early as three millennia ago with the [[Bronze Age sword]].<ref>{{harvp|Oakeshott|1980|p=255}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 20th century, the chivalrous ideal of protecting women came to be seen as a trope of melodrama (\"[[damsel in distress]]\"). The term ''chivalry'' retains a certain currency in sociology, in reference to the general tendency of men, and of society in general, to lend more attention offering protection from harm to women than to men, or in noting [[Sex ratio|gender gaps]] in [[Life expectancy#Gender differences|life expectancy]], [[Gender disparities in health|health]], etc., also expressed in [[media bias]] giving significantly more attention to female than to male victims.{{refn|For example, criminologist [[Richard Felson]] writes \"An attack on a woman is a more serious transgression than an attack on a man because it violates a special norm protecting women from harm.

He continues:\n\n<blockquote>\n\nThe more closely we look into history, the more clearly shall we perceive that the system of chivalry is an invention almost entirely poetical. It is impossible to distinguish the countries in which it is said to have prevailed. It is always represented as distant from us both in time and place, and whilst the contemporary historians give us a clear, detailed, and complete account of the vices of the court and the great, of the ferocity or corruption of the nobles, and of the servility of the people, we are astonished to find the poets, after a long lapse of time, adorning the very same ages with the most splendid fictions of grace, virtue, and loyalty. The romance writers of the twelfth century placed the age of chivalry in the time of Charlemagne. The period when these writers existed, is the time pointed out by [[Francis I of France|Francis I]]. At the present day [about 1810], we imagine we can still see chivalry flourishing in the persons of [[Du Guesclin]] and [[Pierre Terrail, seigneur de Bayard|Bayard]], under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and Francis I. But when we come to examine either the one period or the other, although we find in each some heroic spirits, we are forced to confess that it is necessary to antedate the age of chivalry, at least three or four centuries before any period of authentic history.<ref name=Sismondi/>{{rp|I, 79}}\n\n</blockquote>\n\n==History==\n{{Further|Knight|Orders of knighthood}}\nHistorian of chivalry Richard W. Kaeuper, saw chivalry as a central focus in the study of the European Middle Ages that was too often presented as a civilizing and stabilizing influence in the turbulent Middle Ages. On the contrary, Kaueper argues \"that in the problem of public order the knights themselves played an ambivalent, problematic role and that the guides to their conduct that chivalry provided were in themselves complex and problematic.\"<ref>Richard W. Kaeuper, ''Chivalry and Violence in Medieval Europe'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), 3</ref> Many of the codes and ideals of chivalry were of course contradictory, however, when knights did live up to them, they did not lead to a more \"ordered and peaceful society\". The tripartite conception of medieval European society (those who pray, those who fight, and those who work) along with other linked subcategories of monarchy and aristocracy, worked in congruence with knighthood to reform the institution in an effort \"to secure public order in a society just coming into its mature formation.\"<ref>Kaeuper, ''Chivalry and Violence in Medieval Europe'',4</ref> \n\nKaeuper makes clear that knighthood and the worldview of \"those who fight\" was pre-Christian in many ways and outside the purview of the church, at least initially. The church saw it as a duty to reform and guide knights in a way that weathered the disorderly, martial, and chauvinistic elements of chivalry.<ref>Ibid, 62-83</ref> Royalty was a similar story, with knighthood at many points clashing with the sovereignty of the king over the conduct of warfare and personal disputes between knights and other knights (and even between knights and aristocracy).<ref>Ibid, 93-97</ref> While the worldview of \"those who work\" (the burgeoning merchant class and bourgeoisie) was still in incubation, Kaeuper makes clear that the social and economic class that would end up defining modernity was fundamentally at odds with knights, and those with chivalrous valor saw the values of commerce as beneath them. Those who engaged in commerce and derived their value system from it could be confronted with violence by knights, if need be.<ref>Ibid, 121-139</ref>\n\nAccording to [[David Crouch (historian)|Crouch]], many early writers on medieval chivalry cannot be trusted as historians, because they sometimes have \"polemical purpose which colours their prose\".<ref name=\"Crouch_7\">{{harvp|Crouch|2005|p=7}}</ref> As for [[Kenelm Henry Digby]] and [[L\u00e9on Gautier]], chivalry was a means to transform their corrupt and secular worlds.<ref name=\"Crouch_8\">{{harvp|Crouch|2005|p=8}}</ref> Gautier also emphasized that chivalry originated from the Teutonic forests and was brought up into civilization by the [[Catholic]] Church.<ref>{{harvp|Crouch|2005|p=12}}</ref> Charles Mills used chivalry \"to demonstrate that the Regency gentleman was the ethical heir of a great moral estate, and to provide an inventory of its treasure\".<ref name=\"Crouch_8\" /> Mills also stated that chivalry was a social, not a military phenomenon, with its key features: generosity, fidelity, liberality, and courtesy.<ref>{{harvp|Crouch|2005|pp=10\u201311}}</ref>\n\n=== Europe before 1170: the noble ''habitus'' ===\nAccording to Crouch, prior to codified chivalry there was the uncodified code of noble conduct that focused on the ''preudomme''.{{explain|date=November 2018}} This uncodified code&nbsp;\u2013 referred to as the noble ''habitus''&nbsp;\u2013 is a term for the environment of behavioural and material expectations generated by all societies and classes.<ref>{{harvp|Crouch|2005|p=52}}</ref> As a modern idea, it was pioneered by the French philosopher/sociologists [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], even though a precedent exists for the concept as far back as the works of Aristotle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minerva.mic.ul.ie//vol7/moral.html|title=MORAL CHARACTER: HEXIS, HABITUS AND 'HABIT'}}</ref> Crouch argues that the ''habitus'' on which \"the superstructure of chivalry\" was built and the ''preudomme'' was a part, had existed long before 1100, while the codified medieval noble conduct only began between 1170 and 1220.<ref>{{harvp|Crouch|2005|p=53}}</ref>\n\nThe pre-chivalric noble ''habitus'' as discovered by Mills and Gautier are as follows:\n# '''Loyalty''': It is a practical utility in a warrior nobility. [[Richard Kaeuper]] associates loyalty with ''prowess''.<ref name=\"Crouch_56\">{{harvp|Crouch|2005|p=56}}</ref> The importance of reputation for loyalty in noble conduct is demonstrated in William Marshal biography.<ref name=\"Crouch_56\"/>\n# '''Forbearance''': knights' self-control towards other warriors and at the courts of their lords was a part of the early noble ''habitus'' as shown in the ''Conventum'' of [[Hugh IV of Lusignan|Hugh de Lusignan]] in the 1020s.<ref name=\"auto\">{{harvp|Crouch|2005|p=63}}</ref> The nobility of mercy and forbearance was well established by the second half of the 12th century long before there was any code of chivalry.<ref>{{harvp|Crouch|2005|p=65}}</ref>\n# '''Hardihood''': Historians and social anthropologists{{who?|date=March 2020}} have documented the fact physical resilience and aptitude in warfare in the earliest formative period of \"proto-chivalry,\" was, to contemporary warriors, almost essential of chivalry-defined knighthood (saving the implicit Christian-Davidic ethical framework) and for a warrior of any origin, even the lowliest, to demonstrate outstanding physicality-based prowess on the battlefield was seen as near certainty of noble-knightly status or grounds for immediate nobilitation. To deliver a powerful blow in Arthurian literature almost always certifies of the warrior's nobility. Formal chivalric authorities and commentators were hardly in dispute: the anonymous author of ''La vraye noblesse'', states if the prince or civic authority incarnate sees a man of \"low degree\" but of noble (i.e., martially imposing in the medieval context) bearing, he should promote him to nobility \"even though he be not rich or of noble lineage\": the \"poor companion\" who distinguishes themselves in worldly, incarnadine valor should be \"publicly rewarded.\" As the erudite scholastic analyst modernly viewing these matters, Richard Kaeuper summarizes the matter: \"A knight's nobility or worth is proved by his hearty strokes in battle\" (''Chivalry and Violence in Medieval Europe'', p.&nbsp;131). The quality of sheer hardihood aligns itself with forbearance and loyalty in being one of the military virtues of the ''preudomme''. According to Philip de Navarra, a mature nobleman should have acquired hardiness as part of his moral virtues. Geoffrey de Charny also stressed on the masculine respectability of hardiness in the light of religious feeling of the [[contemptus mundi]].<ref>{{harvp|Crouch|2005|p=67}}</ref>\n# '''''Largesse''''' or '''Liberality''': generosity was part of a noble quantity. According to [[Alan of Lille]], ''largesse'' was not just a simple matter of giving away what he had, but \"Largitas in a man caused him to set no store on greed or gifts, and to have nothing but contempt for bribes.\"<ref>{{harvp|Crouch|2005|pp=69\u201370}}</ref>\n# '''The Davidic ethic''': It is the strongest qualities of ''preudomme'' derived by clerics from [[Bible|Biblical tradition]]. The classical-Aristotelian concept of the \"magnanimous personality\" in the conceptual formulation of the notion here is not without relevance, additionally, nor likewise the early-Germanic and Norse tradition of the war-band leader as the heroic, anti-materialistic \"enemy of gold\". Formally, the Christian-Davidic guardian-protector role concept of warrior-leadership was extensively articulated initially by the [[Franks|Frankish]] church which involved legitimizing rightful authority, first and foremost, on the basis of any would-be warrior-headman being ethically committed to the protection of the weak and helpless (pointedly, the Church and affiliated organizations are here implied primarily if not exclusively), respect and provisioning of justice for widows and orphans, and a Christian idealism-inspired, no-nonsense, principle-based militant opposition to the encroachments of overweening cruel and unjust personages wielding power, whether in the form of unruly, \"black knight\" or \"robber-baron\"-like local sub-princely magistrates, or even in the context of conceiving the hypothetical overthrow of a monarch who had usurped and violated the ''lex primordialis'' or ''lex naturae'' of God in his domain by decreeing or permitting immoral customs or laws and thus self-dethroning themselves meta-ethically, inviting tyrannicidal treatment.<ref>{{harvp|Crouch|2005|pp=71\u201372}}</ref> The core of Davidic ethic is benevolence of the strong toward the weak.<ref>{{harvp|Crouch|2005|p=78}}</ref> Although a somewhat later authority in this specific context, John of Salisbury imbibed this lineage of philosophico-clerical, chivalric justifications of power, and excellently describes the ideal enforcer of the Davidic ethic here: \"The [warrior-]prince accordingly is the minister of the common interest and the bond-servant of equity, and he bears the public person in the sense that he punishes the wrongs and injuries of all, and all crimes, with even-handed equity. His rod and staff also, administered with wise moderation, restore irregularities and false departures to the straight path of equity, so that deservedly may the Spirit congratulate the power of the prince with the words, 'Thy rod and thy staff, they have comforted me.' [Psalm 23:4] His shield, too, is strong, but it is a shield for the protection of the weak, and one which wards off powerfully the darts of the wicked from the innocent. Those who derive the greatest advantage from his performance of the duties of his office are those who can do least for themselves, and his power is chiefly exercised against those who desire to do harm. Therefore not without reason he bears a sword, wherewith he sheds blood blamelessly, without becoming thereby a man of blood, and frequently puts men to death without incurring the name or guilt of homicide.\"{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n# '''Honour''': [[honour]] was what was achieved by living up to the ideal of the ''preudomme'' and pursuing the qualities and behaviour listed above.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{harvp|Crouch|2005|p=79}}</ref> [[Maurice Keen]] notes the most damning, irreversible mode of \"demoting\" one's honorific status, again humanly through contemporary eyes, consisted in displaying pusillanimous conduct on the battlefield. The loss of honour is a humiliation to a man's standing and is worse than death. [[Bertran de Born]] said: \"For myself I prefer to hold a little piece of land in ''onor'', than to hold a great empire with dishonor\".<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nThe code of chivalry, as it was known during the late Medieval age, developed between 1170 and 1220.<ref>{{harvp|Crouch|2005|p=80}}</ref>\n\n===Origins in military ethos===\n[[File:Roman Museum 007.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of a [[Roman cavalry]]man (''[[Equites|eques]]'')]]\nChivalry was developed in the north of France around the mid-12th century but adopted its structure in a European context.

The [[joust]] remained the primary example of knightly display of martial skill throughout the [[Renaissance]] (the last Elizabethan [[Accession Day tilt]] was held in 1602).\n\nThe martial skills of the knight carried over to the practice of [[Medieval hunting|the hunt]], and hunting expertise became an important aspect of courtly life in the later medieval period (see [[terms of venery]]).  Related to chivalry was the practice of [[heraldry]] and its elaborate rules of displaying coats of arms as it emerged in the [[High Middle Ages]].\n\n===Chivalry and Christianity===\n{{Further|Knightly Piety}}\n\nChristianity and church had a modifying influence on the classical concept of heroism and virtue, nowadays identified with the virtues of chivalry.<ref>{{harvp|Corr\u00eaa de Oliveira|1993|p=10}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Keen|2005|p=56}}</ref> The [[Peace and Truce of God]] in the 10th century was one such example, with limits placed on knights to protect and honour the weaker members of society and also help the church maintain peace. At the same time the church became more tolerant of war in the defence of faith, espousing theories of the [[just war]]; and [[liturgies]] were introduced which blessed a knight's sword, and a bath of chivalric purification. In the story of the [[Grail]] romances and ''Chevalier au Cygne'', it was the confidence of the Christian knighthood that its way of life was to please God, and chivalry was an order of God.<ref>{{harvp|Keen|2005|p=62}}</ref> Thus, chivalry as a Christian vocation was a result of marriage between [[Teutons|Teutonic]] heroic values with the militant tradition of [[Old Testament]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe first noted support for chivalric vocation, or the establishment of knightly class to ensure the sanctity and legitimacy of Christianity, was written in 930 by [[Odo of Cluny|Odo]], abbot of [[Cluny]], in the ''Vita of St. Gerald of Aurillac'', which argued that the sanctity of Christ and Christian doctrine can be demonstrated through the legitimate unsheathing of the \"sword against the enemy\".<ref>{{cite book|title=\"The Life of St. Gerald, by Odo\".|year=1954|publisher=Penn State Press|page=371}}</ref> In the 11th century the concept of a \"knight of Christ\" (''miles Christi'') gained currency in France, Spain and Italy.<ref name=sweeney/> These concepts of \"religious chivalry\" were further elaborated in the era of the [[Crusades]], with the Crusades themselves often being seen as a chivalrous enterprise.<ref name=sweeney/> Their ideas of chivalry were also further influenced by [[Saladin]], who was viewed as a chivalrous knight by medieval Christian writers. The [[Military order (society)|military order]]s of the crusades which developed in this period came to be seen as the earliest flowering of chivalry,<ref>Chivalry, Britannica Encyclopedia</ref> although it remains unclear to what extent the notable knights of this period\u2014such as [[Saladin]], [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], [[William Marshal]] or [[Bertrand du Guesclin]]\u2014actually did set new standards of knightly behaviour, or to what extent they merely behaved according to existing models of conduct which came in retrospect to be interpreted along the lines of the \"chivalry\" ideal of the Late Middle Ages.<ref name=sweeney/> Nevertheless, chivalry and crusades were not the same thing. While the crusading ideology had largely influenced the ethic of chivalry during its formative times, chivalry itself was related to a whole range of martial activities and aristocratic values which had no necessary linkage with crusading.<ref>{{harvp|Keen|2005|pp=44\u201345}}</ref>\n\n===Medieval literature and the influence of the Moors and Romans===\nFrom the 12th century onward chivalry came to be understood as a moral, religious and social code of knightly conduct. The particulars of the code varied, but codes would emphasise the virtues of courage, honour, and service. Chivalry also came to refer to an idealisation of the life and manners of the knight at home in his castle and with his court.\n\nEuropean chivalry owed much to the chivalry of the [[Moors]] (Muslims) in Spain, or [[al-Andalus]] as they called it. were greatly influenced by Arabic literature. \"Chivalry was the most prominent characteristic of the Muslim 'Moors' who conquered the [[Iberian Peninsula]]...beginning in 711 AD. In classical Arab culture, to become a genuine Knight (F\u00e1ris) (\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633), one had to master the virtues of dignity, eloquence, gentleness, horsemanship and artistic talents, as well as strength and skill with weaponry. These ancient chivalric virtues were promoted by the Moors, who comprised the majority population of the Iberian Peninsula by 1100 AD, and their ancient Arabian contributions to Chivalry quickly spread throughout Europe.\"<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Muslim Saracen Chivalry as Templar Heritage.

The famous Spanish author [[Vicente Blasco Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez|Blasco Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez]]  says: \"Europe did not know chivalry, or its adopted literature or sense of honour before the arrival of Arabs in Andalusia and the wide presence of their knights and heroes in the countries of the south.\"\n\nThe Andalusian [[Ibn Hazm]] and his famous book ''[[The Ring of the Dove]]'' (''Tawq al-\u1e24am\u0101mah'') had a great impact on poets in Spain and southern France after the Islamic community blended with the Christian community.{{dubious|date=June 2019}} The [[Arabic]] language was the language of the country and the language of the high-class people. In many Christian Spanish provinces, [[Christians|Christian]] and [[Muslim]] poets used to meet at the court of the governor. The European poets at the time were good at composing Arabic poetry. For this reason, [[Henry Maro]] says: \"The Arab impact on the civilization of the Roman peoples did not stop at fine arts only, but extended to music and poetry as well.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe influence of Arabic literature on European writers is proven by what [[Reinhart Dozy]] quoted on his book ''Spanish Islam: History of Moslems in Spain'', of the Spanish writer AlGharo,{{who|date=June 2019}} who deeply regretted the neglect of Latin and Greek and the acceptance of the language of the Muslims, he said, \"The intelligent and eloquent people are bewitched by the sound of Arabic and they look down on Latin. They have started to write in the language of those who defeated them.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nA contemporary of his, who was more influenced by nationalistic feelings, expressed his bitterness when he{{who|date=June 2019}} said:\n\n<blockquote>My Christian brothers admire the poetry and'' chivalry ''stories of the [[Arabs]], and they study the books written by the philosophies and scholars of the Muslims. They do not do that in order to refute them, but rather to learn the eloquent Arabic style. Where today \u2013 apart from the clergy \u2013 are those who read the religious commentaries on the Old and New Testaments? Where are those who read [[the Gospels]] and the words of the Prophets? Alas, the new generation of intelligent Christians do not know any literature and language well apart from Arabic literature and the Arabic language. They avidly read the books of the Arabs and amass huge libraries of these books at great expense; they look upon these Arabic treasures with great pride, at the time when they refrain from reading Christian books on the basis that they are not worth paying attention to. How unfortunate it is that the Christians have forgotten their language, and nowadays you cannot find among them one in a thousand who could write a letter to a friend in his own language. But with regard to the language of the Arabs, how many there are who express themselves fluently in it with the most eloquent style, and they write poetry of the Arabs themselves in its eloquence and correct usage.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}</blockquote>\n\nMedieval courtly literature glorifies the valour, tactics, and ideals of both [[Moors]] and ancient Romans.<ref name=\"sweeney\" /> For example, the ancient hand-book of warfare written by [[Vegetius]] called ''[[De re militari]]'' was translated into French in the 13th century as ''L'Art de chevalerie'' by [[Jean de Meun]]. Later writers also drew from Vegetius, such as Honor\u00e9 Bonet, who wrote the 14th century ''L'Arbes des batailles'', which discussed the morals and laws of war. In the 15th century [[Christine de Pizan]] combined themes from Vegetius, Bonet, and Frontinus in ''Livre des faits d'armes et de chevalerie''.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nIn the later Middle Ages, wealthy merchants strove to adopt chivalric attitudes - the sons of the bourgeoisie were educated at aristocratic courts where they were trained in the manners of the knightly class.<ref name=sweeney/> This was a democratisation of chivalry, leading to a new genre called the [[courtesy book]], which were guides to the behaviour of \"gentlemen\". Thus, the post-medieval gentlemanly code of the value of a man's honour, respect for women, and a concern for those less fortunate, is directly derived from earlier ideals of chivalry and historical forces which created it.<ref name=sweeney/>\n\nThe medieval development of chivalry, with the concept of the honour of a lady and the ensuing knightly devotion to it, not only derived from the thinking about the [[Virgin Mary]], but also contributed to it.<ref>{{harvp|Bromiley|1994|p=272}}</ref> The medieval veneration of the Virgin Mary was contrasted by the fact that ordinary women, especially those outside aristocratic circles, were looked down upon.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Although women were at times viewed as the source of evil, it was Mary who as mediator to God was a source of refuge for man. The development of medieval [[Mariology]] and the changing attitudes towards women paralleled each other and can best be understood in a common context.<ref>{{harvp|Tucker|1987|p=168}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ghent Altarpiece E - Knights of Christ.jpg|thumb|upright|''Knights of Christ'' by [[Jan van Eyck]]]]\nWhen examining [[medieval literature]], chivalry can be classified into three basic but overlapping areas:\n#Duties to countrymen and fellow Christians: this contains virtues such as mercy, courage, valour, fairness, protection of the weak and the poor, and in the servant-hood of the knight to his lord. This also brings with it the idea of being willing to give one's life for another's; whether he would be giving his life for a poor man or his lord.\n#Duties to God: this would contain being faithful to God, protecting the innocent, being faithful to the church, being the champion of good against evil, being generous and obeying God above the feudal lord.\n#Duties to women: this is probably the most familiar aspect of chivalry. This would contain what is often called courtly love, the idea that the knight is to serve a lady, and after her all other ladies. Most especially in this category is a general gentleness and graciousness to all women.\nThese three areas obviously overlap quite frequently in chivalry, and are often indistinguishable.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nDifferent weight given to different areas produced different strands of chivalry:\n#warrior chivalry, in which a knight's chief duty is to his lord, as exemplified by Sir [[Gawain]] in ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'' and ''[[The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnelle]]''\n#religious chivalry, in which a knight's chief duty is to protect the innocent and serve God, as exemplified by Sir [[Galahad]] or Sir [[Percival]] in the [[Holy Grail|Grail legends]].\n#courtly love chivalry, in which a knight's chief duty is to his own lady, and after her, all ladies, as exemplified by Sir [[Lancelot]] in his love for Queen [[Guinevere]] or Sir [[Tristan]] in his love for [[Iseult]]\n\n===Late Middle Ages===\nChivalry underwent a revival and elaboration of chivalric ceremonial and rules of [[etiquette]] in the 14th century that was examined by [[Johan Huizinga]], in ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages|The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'', in which he dedicates a full chapter to \"The idea of chivalry\". In contrasting the literary standards of chivalry with the actual warfare of the age, the historian finds the imitation of an ideal past illusory; in an aristocratic culture such as Burgundy and France at the close of the Middle Ages, \"to be representative of true culture means to produce by conduct, by customs, by manners, by costume, by deportment, the illusion of a heroic being, full of dignity and honour, of wisdom, and, at all events, of courtesy. ...The dream of past perfection ennobles life and its forms, fills them with beauty and fashions them anew as forms of art\".<ref>{{harvp|Huizinga|1924|p=\"Pessimism and the ideal of the sublime life\": 30}}</ref>\n\n===The end of chivalry===\nChivalry was dynamic and it transformed and adjusted in response to local situation and this is what probably led to its demise. There were many chivalric groups in [[England]] as imagined by [[Sir Thomas Malory]] when he wrote ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' in the late 15th century;<ref>{{harvp|Hodges|2005|p=5}}</ref> perhaps each group created each chivalric ideology. And Malory's perspective reflects the condition of 15th-century chivalry.<ref>{{harvp|Hodges|2005|p=7}}</ref> When [[Le Morte d'Arthur|''Le Morte Darthur'']] was printed, [[William Caxton]] urged knights to read the romance with an expectation that reading about chivalry could unite a community of knights already divided by the [[Wars of the Roses]].<ref>{{harvp|Hodges|2005|p=11}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor rule]] in [[England]], some knights still fought according to the ethos. Fewer knights were engaged in active warfare because battlefields during this century were generally the area of professional infantrymen, with less opportunity for knights to show chivalry.<ref>{{harvp|Gravett|2008|p=260}}</ref> It was the beginning of the demise of the knight. The rank of knight never faded, but it was [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] who ended the tradition that any knight could create another and made it exclusively the preserve of the monarch.<ref>{{harvp|Gravett|2008|p=267}}</ref> Christopher Wilkins contends that [[Edward Woodville|Sir Edward Woodville]], who rode from battle to battle across Europe and died in 1488 in [[Brittany]], was the last knight errant who witnessed the fall of the Age of Chivalry and the rise of modern European warfare.

The custom of foundation of [[chivalric order]]s by Europe's monarchs and high nobility peaked in the late medieval period, but it persisted during the Renaissance and well into the Baroque and early modern period, with e.g. the Tuscan [[Order of Saint Stephen]] (1561), the French [[Order of Saint Louis]] (1693) or the [[Anglo-Irish]] [[Order of St. Patrick]] (1783), and numerous [[Dynastic order of knighthood|dynastic orders of knighthood]] remain active in countries that retain a tradition of monarchy.\n\nAt the same time, with the change of courtly ideas during the [[Baroque period]], the ideals of chivalry began to be seen as dated, or \"medieval\". ''[[Don Quixote]]'', published in 1605\u201315, burlesqued the medieval chivalric novel or ''[[romance (heroic literature)|romance]]'' by ridiculing the stubborn adherence to the chivalric code in the face of the then-modern world as anachronistic, giving rise to the term [[Quixotism]]. Conversely, elements of [[Romanticism]] sought to revive such \"medieval\" ideals or aesthetics in the late 18th and early 19th century.\n\nThe behavioural code of military officers down to the [[Napoleonic era]], the [[American Civil War]] (especially as idealised in the \"[[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]]\" movement), and to some extent even to [[World War I]], was still strongly modelled on the historical ideals, resulting in a pronounced [[duel]]ling culture, which in some parts of Europe also held sway over the civilian life of the upper classes. With the [[decline of the Ottoman Empire]], however, the military threat from the \"infidel\" disappeared. The [[European wars of religion]] spanned much of the early modern period and consisted of infighting between factions of various Christian denominations. This process of [[confessionalization]] ultimately gave rise to a new military ethos based in [[nationalism]] rather than \"defending the faith against the infidel\".\n\nIn the American South in mid-19th century, [[John C. Breckinridge]] of Kentucky was hailed as the epitome of chivalry. He enjoyed a reputation for dignity and integrity, and especially his tall, graceful and handsome appearance, with piercing blue eyes and noble -looking expression, with cordial manner,  pleasing voice and eloquent address that was highly appreciated by voters, soldiers, and women alike.<ref> Grady  McWhiney, \"Breckenridge, John  Cabell\" in John  A. Garrity,  ed., ''Encyclopedia of American Biography '' (1975) pp 130-131. </ref>\n\nFrom the [[early modern period]], the term ''gallantry'' (from ''[[galant]]'', the [[Baroque period|Baroque]] ideal of refined elegance) rather than ''chivalry'' became used for the proper behaviour and acting of upper-class men towards upper-class women.\n\nIn the 19th century, there were attempts to revive chivalry for the purposes of the [[gentleman]] of that time.\n\n[[Kenelm Henry Digby]] wrote his ''[[The Broad-Stone of Honour]]'' for this purpose, offering the definition: 'Chivalry is only a name for that general spirit or state of mind which disposes men to heroic actions, and keeps them conversant with all that is beautiful and sublime in the intellectual and moral world'.\n\nThe pronouncedly masculine virtues of chivalry came under attack on the parts of the upper-class [[suffragettes]] campaigning for [[gender equality]] in the early 20th century,{{refn|\"The idea that men were to act and live deferentially on behalf of women and children, though an ancient principle, was already under attack by 1911 from militant suffragettes intent on leveling the political playing field by removing from the public mindset the notion that women were a 'weaker sex' in need of saving.\"<ref>[http://www.visionforumministries.org/issues/women_in_the_military/multigenerational_manhood.aspx ''The Birkenhead Drill''] by [[Doug Phillips]]</ref>|group=Note}} and with the decline of the military ideals of duelling culture and of European aristocracies in general following the catastrophe of [[World War I]], the ideals of chivalry became widely seen as outmoded by the mid-20th century.  As a material reflection of this process, the [[dress sword]] lost its position as an indispensable part of a gentleman's wardrobe, a development described as an \"archaeological terminus\" by [[Ewart Oakeshott]], as it concluded the long period during which the [[sword]] had been a visible attribute of the free man, beginning as early as three millennia ago with the [[Bronze Age sword]].<ref>{{harvp|Oakeshott|1980|p=255}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 20th century, the chivalrous ideal of protecting women came to be seen as a trope of melodrama (\"[[damsel in distress]]\"). The term ''chivalry'' retains a certain currency in sociology, in reference to the general tendency of men, and of society in general, to lend more attention offering protection from harm to women than to men, or in noting [[Sex ratio|gender gaps]] in [[Life expectancy#Gender differences|life expectancy]], [[Gender disparities in health|health]], etc., also expressed in [[media bias]] giving significantly more attention to female than to male victims.{{refn|For example, criminologist [[Richard Felson]] writes \"An attack on a woman is a more serious transgression than an attack on a man because it violates a special norm protecting women from harm. This norm \u2013 ''chivalry'' \u2013 discourages would-be attackers and encourages third parties to protect women.\"<ref>{{harvp|Felson|2002}}</ref>|group=Note}}\n\nFormed in 1907, the world's first [[Scouting|Scout]] camp, the [[Brownsea Island Scout camp]], began as a boys' camping event on [[Brownsea Island]] in [[Poole Harbour]], southern England, organised by [[British Army]] [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Lieutenant-General Robert Baden-Powell]] to test his ideas for the book ''[[Scouting for Boys]]''.

One prominent model of his chivalrous conduct was in World War II and his treatment of the Japanese at the end of the war. MacArthur's model provides a way to win a war with as few casualties as possible and how to get the respect of the former enemy after the occupation of their homeland.<ref>{{harvp|Manchester|1978}}</ref> On May 12, 1962, MacArthur gave a famous speech in front of the cadets of United States Military Academy at [[West Point]] by referring to a great moral code, the code of conduct and chivalry, when emphasizing duty, honour, and country.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/douglasmacarthurthayeraward.html|title=American Rhetoric: General Douglas MacArthur -- Sylvanus Thayer Award Address (Duty, Honor, Country)|work=americanrhetoric.com}}</ref>\n\n== Criticism of chivalry ==\n[[Miguel de Cervantes]], in Part I of ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (1605), attacks [[chivalric romance|chivalric literature]] as historically inaccurate and therefore harmful (see [[Novel#Dubious and scandalous histories|history of the novel]]), though \nhe was quite in agreement with many so-called chivalric principles and guides to behavior.

The word ''owarai'' is the [[Honorific speech in Japanese#Honorific prefixes|honorific]] form of the word ''warai'', meaning \"a laugh\" or \"a smile\". ''Owarai'' is most common on [[Japanese variety show]]s and the comedians are referred to as ''owarai'' [[Glossary of owarai terms#geinin|''geinin'']] or ''owarai [[tarento]]''. Presently{{when|date=September 2016}} Japan is considered to be in an \"''owarai'' boom\", and many minor talents have been finding sudden fame after a [[Glossary of owarai terms#gag|gag]] or skit became popular.\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{see also|Glossary of owarai terms}}\n[[Manzai]] ({{lang|ja|\u6f2b\u624d}}), a traditional form of Japanese comedy that became the basis of many modern acts today, is characterized by a pair of usually older male comedians acting certain roles in a constant comedic battle against themselves.

While there are many women talents, they are largely outnumbered by the men, and they tend to take more minor roles.\n\nWhereas ''manzai'' performers traditionally wore [[kimono]] (traditional Japanese dress), these days a western [[Suit (clothing)|suit]] is the outfit of choice for many ''owarai [[Glossary of owarai terms#kombi|kombi]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u30b3\u30f3\u30d3}}, combination; referring to a pair of comedians in a unit) and many talents who begin their careers performing in a style very similar to [[stand-up comedy]], usually including aspects of ''manzai'' and [[Glossary of owarai terms#conte|conte]].\n\nSome minor characteristics include frequently used [[sound effect]]s (cheap, old-fashioned sound effects are used intentionally for comic effect), [[dajare]] ({{lang|ja|\u30c0\u30b8\u30e3\u30ec}}, a Japanese-style [[pun]]), and [[Glossary of owarai terms#dokkiri|''dokkiri'']] ({{lang|ja|\u30c9\u30c3\u30ad\u30ea}}, a hidden-camera prank like those seen in the popular [[United States|American]] show ''[[Candid Camera]]'').\n\n==Owarai geinin==\n\n{{main|List of Japanese comedians}}\nOn television, most ''owarai geinin'' are introduced using their ''kombi'' name (e.g. ''Yoiko Hamaguchi'') and some ''geinin'' even retain the name of their former groups after they have parted ways.\n\nA few popular ''kombi'' include:\n*{{lang|ja|\u3068\u3093\u306d\u308b\u305a}} [[Tunnels (owarai)|Tunnels]]\n*{{lang|ja|\u30c0\u30a6\u30f3\u30bf\u30a6\u30f3}} [[Downtown (owarai)|Downtown]]\n*{{lang|ja|\u6975\u697d\u3068\u3093\u307c}} [[Gokuraku Tombo]] \n*{{lang|ja|\u30b3\u30b3\u30ea\u30b3}} [[Cocorico (comedy duo)|Cocorico]]\n*{{lang|ja|\u30ad\u30e3\u30a4\u301c\u30f3}} [[Kyaeen]]\n*{{lang|ja|\u30aa\u30fc\u30c9\u30ea\u30fc}} [[Audrey (owarai)|Audrey]]\n*{{lang|ja|\u30a2\u30f3\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30e3\u30d6\u30eb}} Untouchable \n*{{lang|ja|\u30a4\u30f3\u30d1\u30eb\u30b9}} Impulse\n*{{lang|ja|\u30aa\u30bb\u30ed}} [[Othello (Owarai)|Othello]], a rare female ''kombi''\n*{{lang|ja|\u304f\u308a\u3043\u3080\u3057\u3061\u3085\u30fc}} [[Cream Stew (comedy duo)|Cream Stew]]\n*{{lang|ja|\u3055\u307e\u3041\uff5e\u305a}} [[Summers (Owarai)|Summers]]\n*{{lang|ja|\u30cd\u30d7\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30f3}} [[Neptune (owarai)|Neptune]]\n*{{lang|ja|\u6b21\u9577\u8ab2\u9577}} [[Jicho Kacho|Jich\u014d Kach\u014d]]\n*{{lang|ja|\u30b5\u30f3\u30c9\u30a6\u30a3\u30c3\u30c1\u30de\u30f3}} Sandwichman\n*{{lang|ja|\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u30ef\u30b4\u30f3}} Speed Wagon\n*{{lang|ja|TIM}} [[TIM (Owarai)|TIM]]\n*{{lang|ja|\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb}} [[Tutorial (comedy duo)|Tutorial]]\n*{{lang|ja|\u30ca\u30a4\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30ca\u30a4\u30f3}} [[Ninety-nine (owarai)|Ninety-nine]]\n*{{lang|ja|\u7206\u7b11\u554f\u984c}} [[Bakusho Mondai|Bakush\u014d Mondai]]\n*{{lang|ja|\u30da\u30ca\u30eb\u30c6\u30a3}} Penalty\n*{{lang|ja|\u3088\u3090\u3053}} [[Yoiko]]\n*{{lang|ja|\u30e9\u30fc\u30e1\u30f3\u30ba}} [[Rahmens]]\n*{{lang|ja|\u30ec\u30ae\u30e5\u30e9\u30fc}} Regular\n\nMany owarai units have names based on English words or phrases.

Talents such as these often act as hosts for shows, or perform together in small or large groups, something almost unimaginable for most western comedians.\n\n==Variety shows==\nJapanese variety shows are the main outlet for most ''owarai geinin'' and along with [[Japanese television drama|drama]] and [[anime]] they are some of the most popular shows on Japanese television.\n\nAs a general term in Japan, \"variety show\" can refer to \"straight\" variety shows with an appropriate myriad of topics, segments, and games. It is also  used for comedy oriented shows that focus more on stand-up and skits, and quiz/trivia type shows featuring comic elements. It is not to be expected that a variety show will always follow the same format, and guests from Japanese music and talent pools are frequent.\n\nThe variety style shows generally divided into segments of games, features,  and \"corners\", some very short and some shows focusing (for a special episode) solely on one game or feature. [[Trivia]], [[quiz]], or [[game show]]s in Japan are often considered ''owarai'' as the contestants of such shows are often a mix of ''owarai geinin'' and other Japanese talents of various descriptions. Game shows without any famous characters playing the role of contestants are rare.\n\nOf these sections and games, many can be seen recurring on a variety of shows all across Japan. It may even be possible to classify Japanese variety shows (or at least the individual sections of the shows) according to the following formats:\n*[[Quiz]]zes or [[trivia]] (with subjects as varied as {{lang|ja|\u96d1\u5b66}} (''zatsugaku'', general or useless knowledge), [[Mathematics|math]], [[science]], [[history]] and other school subjects, [[kanji]] (testing peoples' knowledge of difficult or rare characters), [[English language|English]], and a mishmash of typical quiz-style trick questions\n*Food judgement/tasting/making (various types of food are also commonly used as prizes for the winner of a game)\n*Travel (often travelling within Japan to view someones estate or around the world producing short, documentary-style segments about world culture, with a comic twist)\n*Physical challenges, tests of strength/endurance etc.\n*Tests of improvised comic skill (for example, a ''dajare'' contest)\n*Obstacle courses/collections of strange games or activities\n*[[Music]] (Either with real [[Japanese music]]ians, or with ''owarai geinin'' trying their hands at music (often [[karaoke]] style), covering popular songs or showing off their own)\n\nSome concepts of variety shows are consistent over most of Japanese television, though they may be considered quite different from those seen in the western world. Many shows are made up of what are called [[VTR]]s, or video segments, and are usually introduced with a hand gesture and the word ''[[d\u014dzo]]'' (the implied meaning is \"let's have a look\"), though this procedure is usually made into a joke with strange gestures instead of the usual wave.\n\nA few popular variety/comedy shows of varying contents are:\n\n* {{lang|ja|\u7b11\u3044\u306e\u91d1\u30e1\u30c0\u30eb}} ''[[King of Comedy (variety show)|King of Comedy]]'' (showcasing the stand-up acts and skits of new and popular talent, often featuring VTR segments of the activities of various talents)\n* {{lang|ja|\u30a8\u30f3\u30bf\u306e\u795e\u69d8}} ''[[The God of Entertainment]]'' (similar to King of Comedy, though focusing on stand-up acts)\n* {{lang|ja|\u611b\u306e\u30a8\u30d7\u30ed\u30f3}} ''[[Apron of Love]]'' (talents lacking cooking skill are asked to cook difficult dishes and are given harsh, though honest, judgements)\n* {{lang|ja|SMAP\u00d7SMAP}} ''[[SMAP\u00d7SMAP]]'' (the five members of the immensely popular group [[SMAP]] host many different shows, presenting segments such as music, cooking, and news)\n* {{lang|ja|\u92ad\u5f62\u91d1\u592a\u90ce}} ''[[Zenigata Kintar\u014d]]'' (this show's segment ''bimb\u014d batoru'' (battle of the poor) showcases the life of two or more people living in Japan who support interesting life styles on minimum amounts of money; the funniest, or most inspiring ''bimb\u014d'' wins)\n* ''[[Matthew's Best Hit TV+]]'' (hosted by the comedian [[Takashi Fujii (comedian)|Takashi Fujii]], this show features musical guests and a strange variety of games and unrelated segments)\n* {{lang|ja|\u30c8\u30ea\u30d3\u30a2\u306e\u6cc9}} ''[[Hey!

Talents such as these often act as hosts for shows, or perform together in small or large groups, something almost unimaginable for most western comedians.\n\n==Variety shows==\nJapanese variety shows are the main outlet for most ''owarai geinin'' and along with [[Japanese television drama|drama]] and [[anime]] they are some of the most popular shows on Japanese television.\n\nAs a general term in Japan, \"variety show\" can refer to \"straight\" variety shows with an appropriate myriad of topics, segments, and games. It is also  used for comedy oriented shows that focus more on stand-up and skits, and quiz/trivia type shows featuring comic elements. It is not to be expected that a variety show will always follow the same format, and guests from Japanese music and talent pools are frequent.\n\nThe variety style shows generally divided into segments of games, features,  and \"corners\", some very short and some shows focusing (for a special episode) solely on one game or feature. [[Trivia]], [[quiz]], or [[game show]]s in Japan are often considered ''owarai'' as the contestants of such shows are often a mix of ''owarai geinin'' and other Japanese talents of various descriptions. Game shows without any famous characters playing the role of contestants are rare.\n\nOf these sections and games, many can be seen recurring on a variety of shows all across Japan. It may even be possible to classify Japanese variety shows (or at least the individual sections of the shows) according to the following formats:\n*[[Quiz]]zes or [[trivia]] (with subjects as varied as {{lang|ja|\u96d1\u5b66}} (''zatsugaku'', general or useless knowledge), [[Mathematics|math]], [[science]], [[history]] and other school subjects, [[kanji]] (testing peoples' knowledge of difficult or rare characters), [[English language|English]], and a mishmash of typical quiz-style trick questions\n*Food judgement/tasting/making (various types of food are also commonly used as prizes for the winner of a game)\n*Travel (often travelling within Japan to view someones estate or around the world producing short, documentary-style segments about world culture, with a comic twist)\n*Physical challenges, tests of strength/endurance etc.\n*Tests of improvised comic skill (for example, a ''dajare'' contest)\n*Obstacle courses/collections of strange games or activities\n*[[Music]] (Either with real [[Japanese music]]ians, or with ''owarai geinin'' trying their hands at music (often [[karaoke]] style), covering popular songs or showing off their own)\n\nSome concepts of variety shows are consistent over most of Japanese television, though they may be considered quite different from those seen in the western world. Many shows are made up of what are called [[VTR]]s, or video segments, and are usually introduced with a hand gesture and the word ''[[d\u014dzo]]'' (the implied meaning is \"let's have a look\"), though this procedure is usually made into a joke with strange gestures instead of the usual wave.\n\nA few popular variety/comedy shows of varying contents are:\n\n* {{lang|ja|\u7b11\u3044\u306e\u91d1\u30e1\u30c0\u30eb}} ''[[King of Comedy (variety show)|King of Comedy]]'' (showcasing the stand-up acts and skits of new and popular talent, often featuring VTR segments of the activities of various talents)\n* {{lang|ja|\u30a8\u30f3\u30bf\u306e\u795e\u69d8}} ''[[The God of Entertainment]]'' (similar to King of Comedy, though focusing on stand-up acts)\n* {{lang|ja|\u611b\u306e\u30a8\u30d7\u30ed\u30f3}} ''[[Apron of Love]]'' (talents lacking cooking skill are asked to cook difficult dishes and are given harsh, though honest, judgements)\n* {{lang|ja|SMAP\u00d7SMAP}} ''[[SMAP\u00d7SMAP]]'' (the five members of the immensely popular group [[SMAP]] host many different shows, presenting segments such as music, cooking, and news)\n* {{lang|ja|\u92ad\u5f62\u91d1\u592a\u90ce}} ''[[Zenigata Kintar\u014d]]'' (this show's segment ''bimb\u014d batoru'' (battle of the poor) showcases the life of two or more people living in Japan who support interesting life styles on minimum amounts of money; the funniest, or most inspiring ''bimb\u014d'' wins)\n* ''[[Matthew's Best Hit TV+]]'' (hosted by the comedian [[Takashi Fujii (comedian)|Takashi Fujii]], this show features musical guests and a strange variety of games and unrelated segments)\n* {{lang|ja|\u30c8\u30ea\u30d3\u30a2\u306e\u6cc9}} ''[[Hey!

Specifically, the game is most similar to later entries in the series such as ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour|World Tour]]'' and ''[[Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock|Warriors of Rock]]''. Gameplay involves pressing colored buttons on a [[guitar]]-shaped controller to play along to songs, although in ''Clone Hero'' these inputs can be mapped to a keyboard or any other input device. Players must hold specific buttons that line up with colored notes that appear on the screen on a \"highway\"; when the notes hit the bottom of the highway, the player must strum to hit the notes in time with the music. There is also an \"open strum\" note, represented with a purple bar, which requires the player to strum without pressing any other buttons. In addition to normal notes, there are \"HOPO\"s (\"[[Hammer-on|Hammer-ons]]\" and \"[[Pull-off|Pull-offs]]\") and \"tap notes\", which both do not require the player to strum them to hit them, with the difference between the two being that a string of HOPOs must begin with a strum, and the player must re-strum if they miss a note. Unlike the ''Guitar Hero'' series, by default there is no penalty for missing notes, aside from breaking a combo, making it impossible to fail a song. The game also contains a mode which emulates the gameplay of ''[[Guitar Hero Live]]'', which is notably different from other games in the series.\n\n=== Community-made charts ===\n''Clone Hero'' has the ability to play community-made songs, called \"charts\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-05-01-meet-the-community-reviving-classic-guitar-hero-gameplay-in-their-own-clone|title=The spirit of Guitar Hero lives on in a bizarre community-made clone|last=Stubbs|first=Mike|date=2018-05-01|website=Eurogamer|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.avclub.com/guitar-heroes-never-die-they-just-start-playing-clone-1828254899|title=Guitar Heroes never die, they just start playing Clone Hero|last=Neilan|first=Dan|date=August 10, 2018|website=AV Club|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> However, unlike games in the ''Guitar Hero'' series, these songs do not need to be original compositions, and can instead be any audio file a member of the community wishes to turn into a playable chart.

{"title_page": "Senakhaskhel", "text_new": "{{Copy edit|for=grammar, style, and usage|date=March 2020}}\n'''Senakhaskhel''' is the title of nobility in the [[Maratha Empire]]. The title, which is the most important one after [[Senapati]] title, was created at the end of the [[17th century]] by [[Rajaram I|Rajaram]]. ''Senakhaskhel'' means Upasenapati (Sub-commander).
