Most of the section between Birmingham and Nuneaton is now classified as the [[B4114 road|B4114]].\n\n==Details==\n[[File:Route of A47.png|left|thumb|''Route of A47'', OpenStreetMap]]\n*It is the only A road in Zone 4 to enter [[Norfolk]] and [[Suffolk]]. No roads from [[Great Britain road numbering scheme|Zones]] 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 enter the counties, which lie exclusively in Zone 1.\n*Between the Clickers Way roundabout in [[Earl Shilton]] and the B582 junction near [[Leicester]], the A47 runs through a [[Leicester Forest|forest]].\n*Between [[Birmingham]] and [[Nuneaton]] is the B4114 road.\n*The A47 road is partly a holiday road, through [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], [[Warwickshire]], [[Leicestershire]], [[Rutland]], [[Cambridgeshire]], [[Norfolk]], and [[Suffolk]], since it ends in [[Lowestoft]], a tourist destination with a beach. On the way it passes the city of [[Norwich]] and the [[Norfolk Broads]], both popular tourist destinations in their own right. Its other main function is the transport of goods by road to and from the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] into Norfolk, north [[Suffolk]] and the ports at [[Great Yarmouth]] and [[Lowestoft]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sentinel sculpture TimTolkien.jpg|right|thumb|''Sentinel'' by [[Tim Tolkien]] near the wartime [[Spitfire]] factory at [[Castle Bromwich]]]]\nThe original (1923) route of the A47 was Birmingham to Great Yarmouth, but there were some changes made to its route in the early years. At its eastern end, the A47 originally ran through Filby and Caister, with the [[Acle Straight]] bearing the number B1140. The A47 was rerouted along the Acle Straight in 1935, with the old route being renumbered as the A1064 (Acle to Caister) and part of the A149 (Caister to Great Yarmouth).\n\nThe second change also dates from 1935. The A47 originally ran via Downham Market, not King's Lynn. In 1935,{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} it was rerouted via King's Lynn, replacing part of the A141 (Wisbech to King's Lynn) and part of the A17 (King's Lynn to Swaffham). The old route via Downham Market was renumbered as the A1122 (Outwell to Swaffham) and part of the A1101 (Wisbech to Outwell).\n\nThe third change took place some time before 1932. The original route of the A47 between Guyhirn and Wisbech was via Wisbech St Mary, with the direct route being part of the A141. This is because there was no road bridge over the River Nene at Guyhirn, and hence no junction between the A47 and the A141. Some time between 1923 and 1932 a bridge was built, and the A47 and the A141 swapped routes between Guyhirn and Wisbech.\n\nMajor improvements were made from the late 1970s until early in the 1990s. The 7 mile (11.3&nbsp;km) \u00a35&nbsp;million part-dual-carriageway East Dereham Bypass built on part of the disused railway line was opened in spring 1978 followed by a five-mile (8&nbsp;km) part-dual-carriageway Swaffham Bypass, costing \u00a35&nbsp;million which was opened in June 1981. Bypasses for Uppingham (\u00a31.4&nbsp;million) and Blofield (\u00a34&nbsp;million) were opened in 1982 and 1983 respectively. The southern section of the Great Yarmouth Western Bypass was opened in May 1985 and the northern section in March 1986 at a cost of \u00a319&nbsp;million followed by improvements to the one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) Postwick-Blofield section (\u00a31.2&nbsp;million) which was opened in November 1987. In 1989 Acle Bypass was completed as a cost of \u00a37.1&nbsp;million and the \u00a31.2&nbsp;million East Norton Bypass was opened in December 1990. The three mile (4.8&nbsp;km) \u00a39&nbsp;million East Dereham-North Tuddenham Improvement opened in August 1992 and the \u00a362&nbsp;million Norwich southern Bypass in September 1992.\n\nEscalating [[Road protest (UK)|road protests]] starting with [[Twyford Down]] in 1992 and culminating with the [[Newbury bypass]] in 1996 (at which over 1,000 people were arrested)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk/stories/the_age_of_ambivalence/02.ST.06/?scene=4&tv=true|title=Environmental protest groups|publisher=The Making for the Modern World|accessdate=16 January 2008}}</ref> led to over 300 road schemes being cancelled in November 1995<ref name=PCh>{{cite web|url=http://protestculture.org/history.html|title=Protest Culture - history|publisher=Protest Culture|accessdate=17 January 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071013213726/http://www.protestculture.org/history.html |archivedate = 13 October 2007}}</ref> and to the cancellation of further schemes including the Thorney bypass<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.malcmoss.easynet.co.uk/speeches/thorneybypass.htm |title=Thorney bypass |accessdate=6 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201192205/http://www.malcmoss.easynet.co.uk/speeches/thorneybypass.htm |archivedate=1 December 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }} </ref> by the new Labour government in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/about/strategy/whitepapers/previous/anewdealfortransportbetterfo5695 |title=A new deal for transport: better for everyone |publisher=Department for Transport |accessdate=1 February 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080130042950/http://www.dft.gov.uk/about/strategy/whitepapers/previous/anewdealfortransportbetterfo5695 |archivedate=30 January 2008 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n |title=A New Deal for Transport: The UK's Struggle with the Sustainable Transport Agenda\n |author=Iain Docherty (ed.), Jon Shaw (ed.)\n |date=August 2003\n |publisher=Blackwell\n |isbn=1-4051-0631-X\n |url-access=registration\n |url=https://archive.org/details/newdealfortransp0000unse\n }}</ref>\n\nIn 2002 the government announced a new road building programme<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmselect/cmtlgr/558/55808.htm#a27|title=Select Committee on Transport, Local Government and the Regions Eighth Report|publisher=House of Commons|accessdate=16 January 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080118022801/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmselect/cmtlgr/558/55808.htm| archivedate= 18 January 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> which included the three mile (4.8&nbsp;km) dual-carriageway Thorney bypass which opened on 14 December 2005.\n\nIn February 2017 the Highways Agency redesignated the stretch of the A12 road between Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft as the A47.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hewett|first1=Emily|title=Why has the A12 between Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft become the A47?|url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/crime/why_has_the_a12_between_great_yarmouth_and_lowestoft_become_the_a47_1_4879496|website=Eastern Daily Press|accessdate=7 February 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Proposed improvements==\n\n===Acle Straight (New Road)===\n{{Infobox Future Infrastructure Project\n|property_name = A47 Acle Straight (New Road)\n|image_name = Proposed_Acle_Straight_development.png\n|image_size = 250px\n|caption = Route of the proposed A47 Acle Straight scheme\n|location = [[Norfolk]]\n|proposer = [[Norfolk County Council]]\n|estimated cost = \n|stakeholders = \n|geometry = [http://umapper.s3.amazonaws.com/maps/kml/45889.kml KML]\n}}\n\nA study on the A47 which concluded in 2001 looked at improving New Road, i.e. the section of the A47 between [[Acle]] and [[Great Yarmouth]] known as the [[Acle Straight]].<ref name=\"HA3\">\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/4175.aspx \n |title=A47 Acle Straight \n |publisher=[[Highways Agency]] \n |accessdate=14 November 2008 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704212114/http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/4175.aspx \n |archivedate=4 July 2008 \n |df=dmy \n}}</ref> The improvement of the Acle Straight has become a point of contention between interested parties due to its passage through [[The Broads|the Norfolk Broads]], an area of important ecological and conservation significance that limits development.

Dualling was however strongly opposed by the [[Environment Agency]], the [[Council for National Parks|Council for National Parks (CNP)]] and the [[Broads Authority]] due to its impact on biodiversity and internationally important wildlife sites.

Its other main function is the transport of goods by road to and from the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] into Norfolk, north [[Suffolk]] and the ports at [[Great Yarmouth]] and [[Lowestoft]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sentinel sculpture TimTolkien.jpg|right|thumb|''Sentinel'' by [[Tim Tolkien]] near the wartime [[Spitfire]] factory at [[Castle Bromwich]]]]\nThe original (1923) route of the A47 was Birmingham to Great Yarmouth, but there were some changes made to its route in the early years. At its eastern end, the A47 originally ran through Filby and Caister, with the [[Acle Straight]] bearing the number B1140. The A47 was rerouted along the Acle Straight in 1935, with the old route being renumbered as the A1064 (Acle to Caister) and part of the A149 (Caister to Great Yarmouth).\n\nThe second change also dates from 1935. The A47 originally ran via Downham Market, not King's Lynn. In 1935,{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} it was rerouted via King's Lynn, replacing part of the A141 (Wisbech to King's Lynn) and part of the A17 (King's Lynn to Swaffham). The old route via Downham Market was renumbered as the A1122 (Outwell to Swaffham) and part of the A1101 (Wisbech to Outwell).\n\nThe third change took place some time before 1932. The original route of the A47 between Guyhirn and Wisbech was via Wisbech St Mary, with the direct route being part of the A141. This is because there was no road bridge over the River Nene at Guyhirn, and hence no junction between the A47 and the A141. Some time between 1923 and 1932 a bridge was built, and the A47 and the A141 swapped routes between Guyhirn and Wisbech.\n\nMajor improvements were made from the late 1970s until early in the 1990s.

When this was first built, in the mid-1970s, the A47 followed what is now the A15 ''Paston Parkway''.\n\nIt crosses the [[East Coast Main Line]] and meets the [[A15 road (England)|A15]] at [[New England, Peterborough|New England]] near to a [[Morrisons]] (former [[Safeway (UK)|Safeway]]), and Boulevard and Brotherhood retail parks at [[Walton, Peterborough|Walton]] to the north and [[New England, Peterborough|New England]] to the south. There is another GSJ near [[Paston, Peterborough|Paston]] to the north and it [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/322311 meets] the other strand of the A15 at a GSJ near [[Gunthorpe, Peterborough|Gunthorpe]]. It meets the southern terminus of the new [[A16 road (England)#Spalding-Peterborough route change|A16]] alignment before meeting the A1139 at a roundabout and crossing the [[Car Dyke]]. The {{convert|3|mi|km|adj=on}} \u00a37.2&nbsp;million [[Eye, Cambridgeshire|Eye]] Bypass opened as ''Eye Road'' in October 1991, diverting traffic from the ''Paston Parkway'', and partly built on the former [[Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway|Peterborough to Wisbech railway]]. There is a local access roundabout at [[Eye Green]] near the [[Esso]] ''Eye Green Service Station'', a [[Travelodge UK|Travelodge]] and the Peterborough Eye [[Little Chef]] on the right, where it becomes ''Thorney Road'', ''The Causeway''.

The {{convert|1/2|mi|km|adj=on}} \u00a33.7&nbsp;million [[Guyhirn]] Diversion opened in October 1990. The road heads north-east, following the east bank of the River Nene. The {{convert|5|mi|km|adj=on}} \u00a36&nbsp;million [[Wisbech]]/West Walton Bypass opened in autumn 1984. The former route leaves as the B198 at a roundabout. It meets a [[level crossing]], and it enters [[Norfolk]] and the district of [[King's Lynn and West Norfolk]] just before a roundabout with the A1101 for [[Elm, Cambridgeshire|Elm]] and [[Emneth]] at the Elme Hall Hotel. It passes the [[Total S.A.|Total]] ''Wisbech Services'' and the Wisbech [[Little Chef]] then meets the old route (B198) at a roundabout and becomes the {{convert|6|mi|km|adj=on}} \u00a323&nbsp;million dual-carriageway [[Walpole Highway]]/Tilney High End Bypass which opened in summer 1996. There is an [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/283621 exit] for Walpole Highway, and [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/283724 another] for [[Terrington St John]]. It [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/279119 passes] near [[Tilney High End]]. Near [[Tilney All Saints]], it meets the old route at a roundabout, becoming the single carriageway ''Main Road'', then ''Pullover Road''.

It meets the A148 at a GSJ. The [[A10 road (England)|A10]] and the [[A149 road|A149]] have their terminus here, at the ''Hardwick Flyover'' (opened on 30 October 2003<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080906092225/http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/2845.aspx ]</ref>) near the large Hardwick Industrial Estate (formerly home of [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/466907 Campbell's Soup]) and a Ramada Hotel. It becomes ''[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/674041 Constitution Hill]'', passing [[North Runcton]] then [[Middleton, Norfolk|Middleton]], where it passes the Crown public house and St Mary's church as \"Lynn Road\".\n\nNext is [[East Winch]], where it passes All Saints's church, then [[West Bilney]] where it passes St Cecilia's church. The former King's Lynn-Swaffham railway crossed at this point. There is a right-turn for [[Pentney]] and it meets the B1153 for [[East Walton]]. The half-mile \u00a32.8&nbsp;million [[Narborough, Norfolk|Narborough]] Bypass, opened in November 1992, where the road crosses the [[River Nar]] and enters the district of [[Breckland (district)|Breckland]]. There is a straight section to where it meets the A1122 (for [[RAF Marham]]) at a roundabout at the start of the five-mile \u00a35&nbsp;million part-dual-carriageway [[Swaffham]] Bypass, which opened in June 1981. There is an exit for Swaffham, and a GSJ with the [[A1065 road|A1065]] (for [[Fakenham]]).\n\nIt passes some wind turbines and there is a roundabout where it joins the former route just before it is crossed by the [[Peddars Way]]. There is a left turn for [[Sporle]] and it passes [[Necton]] then heads north-west through [[Little Fransham]], [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/478180 passing] the ''[http://www.thecanaryandlinnet.co.uk Canary and Linnet]'', with a left [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/522906 turn] for [[Crane's Corner]].

The B1147 leaves for [[Swanton Morley]]. The three-mile \u00a39&nbsp;million East Dereham-North Tuddenham Improvement opened in August 1992, which [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/275240 passes] [[North Tuddenham]].

It crosses the [[Wherry Lines|Wherry Line]] and meets the A1042 at a GSJ. The section from the end of this bypass to [[Blofield]], the one-mile \u00a31.2&nbsp;million [[Postwick with Witton|Postwick]]-Blofield Dualling, was opened in November 1987. There is a left turn to [[Great Plumstead]]. The one-mile \u00a34&nbsp;million dual-carriageway Blofield Bypass opened in February 1983, which starts at a roundabout for [[Brundall]] near the [[Total S.A.|Total]] ''Broadlands Services'' and the Broadlands [[Little Chef]]. It becomes single carriageway and passes [[North Burlingham]] near the staggered ''White House]'' crossroads with the B1140. The three-mile \u00a37.1&nbsp;million dual-carriageway [[Acle]] Bypass opened in March 1989, which ends at a roundabout with the A1048 near a [[Travelodge UK|Travelodge]] and the Acle [[Little Chef]], becoming the single carriageway ''New Road''. From Acle, the road enters the [[Acle Straight]] which is nearly seven miles of straight and level single carriageway to Great Yarmouth, with just one curve at Road House Diner. The road is notorious for congestion, especially during the holiday season, and also for the number of accidents, which due to the drainage ditches on either side of the road are often fatal, and demands for dualling have been heard for many years, although there are no current plans to go ahead with this. It enters the district of [[Great Yarmouth (borough)|Great Yarmouth]], then passes close to [[Breydon Water]]. The northern section of the two-mile \u00a319&nbsp;million Great Yarmouth Western Bypass ([[A47 road (England)|A47]]) opened in March 1986, and the southern section opened in May 1995.\n\n===Route Extension: Great Yarmouth-Lowestoft===\n[[File:Breydon Bridge - geograph.org.uk - 467090.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The Breydon Bridge to the west of Great Yarmouth now carries the A47.]]\n[[File:Gorleston roundabout and site of Gorleston on sea railway station - geograph.org.uk - 995929.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The Gorleston Relief Bypass, which used to be the A12]]\nIn February 2017, [[Highways England]] announced that the A47 would be extended by around 10 miles by renumbering the section of the [[A12 road (England)|A12]], which runs from [[Great Yarmouth]]'s Western Bypass/Vauxhall Roundabout which intersects with the A47/A12 and [[A1064 road|A1064]] at the moment, continuing through the Gorleston Relief Bypass, passing the [[James Paget University Hospital]] and then continuing through to [[Lowestoft]] where it then intersects with the A12 where the road will terminate and the A12 starts to continue on to [[London]].\n\nAs of 11 February 2017, around half of the A12 has been renumbered in [[Lowestoft]] up to [[Hopton-on-Sea]] where visible signage of the A12 had been recovered with the A47, but the section  between [[Hopton-on-Sea]] and [[Great Yarmouth]] has only had yellow signs notifying of the renumbering change but the A12 signage has not been removed.\n\nImprovement works are expected to be made in Great Yarmouth on especially the Western Bypass section spanning over the [[Breydon Bridge]], where safety improvements are expected to be made to the Vauxhall Roundabout, Gapton Hall Roundabout, [[James Paget University Hospital]] and also the Acle Straight (Acle New Road).\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|A47 road (England)}}\n* [http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=A47 SABRE First 99 - A47]\n\n{{GB A road zone 4}}\n{{Streets in Birmingham}}\n\n{{coord|52.59366|N|0.65257|W|type:landmark_region:GB_dim:90000|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:4-0047}}\n[[Category:Roads in England]]\n[[Category:Transport in Birmingham, West Midlands]]\n[[Category:Roads in Cambridgeshire]]\n[[Category:Transport in Leicestershire]]\n[[Category:Transport in Leicester]]\n[[Category:Transport in Norfolk]]\n[[Category:Transport in Rutland]]\n[[Category:Roads in the West Midlands (county)]]\n[[Category:Roads in Warwickshire]]\n", "name_user": "Rschen7754", "label": "safe", "comment": "(GR)File:UK road A594.PNG\u2192File:UK road A594.svgsvg", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A47_road"}

It currently runs from [[Luton]] in [[Bedfordshire]] to [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] in [[Cumbria]], although it formerly started at a junction with the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] at [[Chipping Barnet|Barnet]]. It is the fourth longest numbered road in Britain, behind only the A1, [[A38 road|A38]] and [[A30 road|A30]].\n\nRunning north-west from Luton, the road travels through [[Bedford, Bedfordshire|Bedford]], bypasses [[Rushden]], [[Kettering]] and [[Market Harborough]], continues through [[Leicester]], [[Loughborough]], [[Derby]] and [[Matlock, Derbyshire|Matlock]] before going through the [[Peak District]] to [[Bakewell]], [[Buxton]], [[Stockport]], [[Manchester]], [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], [[Pendleton, Greater Manchester|Pendleton]], [[Irlams o' th' Height]], [[Pendlebury]], [[Swinton, Greater Manchester|Swinton]], [[Wardley, Greater Manchester|Wardley]], [[Linnyshaw]], [[Walkden]], [[Little Hulton]], [[Bolton]], [[Chorley]], [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], [[Kendal]] and [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]] before reaching [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]].\n\nSouth of Derby, the road is paralleled by the [[M1 motorway]], between Manchester and Preston the [[M6 motorway|M6]] and [[M61 motorway|M61]] motorways approximate its course, and from Preston to its northern terminus in Carlisle it is paralleled by the M6 only. Between Derby and Manchester the A6 follows a completely different routing to the motorway network, crossing the [[Peak District]] rather than going around it. Because of these duplications, the A6 is less important than it was formerly.\n\n==Route==\n\n===Luton\u2013Kettering===\nThe A6 begins as St Mary's Road at an elongated roundabout with the [[A505 road]]{{spaced ndash}}part of the Luton inner [[ring road]]. The A6 follows Guildford Street{{spaced ndash}}near the [[Luton railway station|railway station]]{{spaced ndash}}and into New Bedford Road. It meets the A5228 outer ring road at a roundabout. On the outskirts of Luton, now Barton Road, it meets the [[Icknield Way Path]]. Leaving Luton, it enters [[Central Bedfordshire]] after a roundabout with Quantock Rise.\n\n[[File:Roundabout on the A6 - geograph.org.uk - 420.jpg|thumb|left|Start of Barton-le-Clay bypass near [[Streatley, Bedfordshire|Streatley]] ]]\nThere is a roundabout at [[Streatley, Bedfordshire|Streatley]], where the road becomes the dual-carriageway Luton Road, passing through the Bartonhill Cutting. The road becomes single carriageway at the roundabout with the B655 at the other end of the [[Barton-le-Clay]] bypass. It meets the [[A507 road|A507]] at a roundabout at [[Clophill]], crossing the [[River Flit]]. It passes by Maulden Wood as the dual-carriage up Deadman's Hill then passes Haynes West End. It enters the district of [[Bedford]] and bypasses [[Wilstead]]. It meets the [[A421 road|A421]] at the Elstow Interchange [[grade separation|grade-separated junction]] (GSJ). The A6 meets the [[A5134 road|A5134]] at a large signal-controlled junction.\n\nThe road crosses the [[Marston Vale Line]], then enters Bedford as Ampthill Road. There is a roundabout with the [[A5141 road|A5141]], then it crosses the railway again near [[Bedford St Johns railway station]]. It meets the [[A600 road|A600]] and [[A5140 road|A5140]] at a roundabout, then passes [[Bedford College (Bedford)|Bedford College]] and crosses the [[River Great Ouse]] as King Street. It takes two one-way routes (Tavistock Street\u2013High Street and Horne Lane\u2013Union Street) through the town centre, which meet at a roundabout, then continues for around 700 yards. It meets the A5141 again at a roundabout near [[Bedford Modern School]] and a large [[Sainsbury's]] supermarket and becomes the dual-carriageway Paula Radcliffe Way; it formerly passed through Clapham itself before the construction of the Paula Radcliffe Way Bypass in 2001.\n\n[[File:Oakley, A6 Clapham Bypass - geograph.org.uk - 91316.jpg|thumb|right|Clapham bypass near Oakley]]\n[[File:Irthlingborough Viaduct - geograph.org.uk - 90947.jpg|thumb|right|Irthlingborough Viaduct built over the Nene in 1936]]\nThe A6 crosses the [[River Great Ouse]] twice more, and is crossed by the [[John Bunyan Trail]], near a GSJ for Clapham and [[Oakley, Bedfordshire|Oakley]]. There is another GSJ for Highfield Parc Industrial Estate. At the end of the bypass, the road suddenly loses the broad expanse of tarmac and looks like a minor [[B roads in Great Britain|B road]] and becomes Bedford Road; there are speed cameras here. It passes through Milton Ernest, passing the Queen's Head pub and the exit for the notorious [[Yarl's Wood Immigration Removal Centre]]. It then carries on for around three miles, passing the Falcon pub near [[Bletsoe]] then passes [[Sharnbrook]] at a Roundabout. Around a mile later it crosses the border into [[Northamptonshire]] and enters the district of [[East Northamptonshire]]. It passes through the village of Wymington, and passes the exit to the well known [[Santa Pod Raceway]], bypasses the towns of [[Rushden]] and [[Higham Ferrers]], arriving at the Chown's Mill roundabout with the [[A45 road|A45]]. From here the road bridges the [[River Nene]] and the [[Nene Way]] before bypassing [[Irthlingborough]]. The A6 then passes through the town of [[Finedon]] and intersects the [[A510 road|A510]] at a roundabout. Leaving Finedon, the road then passes the [[Burton Wold Wind Farm]] and bypasses the town of [[Burton Latimer]], finally arriving at Junction 10 of the [[A14 road (England)|A14]] at [[Barton Seagrave]].\n\n===Kettering\u2013Leicester===\nKettering was bypassed when sections of the east-west corridor [[A14 road (Great Britain)|A14]] were built. The road enters [[Leicestershire]] and the district of [[Harborough District|Harborough]] as Harborough Road at the start of the five-mile (8&nbsp;km) Market Harborough Bypass. It briefly re-enters Northamptonshire again, and at this point there is a roundabout with the [[A427 road|A427]] (for [[Stoke Albany]]) and A4304 (former A427), and an exit for [[Great Bowden]].\n\n[[File:A6 towards Market Harborough - geograph.org.uk - 203584.jpg|thumb|right|Southern end of the Great Glen bypass looking south]]\nIt is crossed by the Leicestershire Round. There is a turn for [[Foxton, Leicestershire|Foxton]] and [[Foxton Locks]]. It is crossed by the Midland Main Line. The A6 still passes through [[Kibworth]]. The road becomes Leicester Road. It crosses the [[River Sence]] and there is a roundabout. The bypass ends with a roundabout, just before the road enters the district of [[Oadby and Wigston]].\n\n===Leicester\u2013Peak District===\nOn the outskirts of Leicester the road becomes London Road. There is a roundabout with Florence Wragg Way, where the road becomes Glen Road It then becomes Leicester Road before reaching the outer ring-road ([[A563 road|A563]]), next to [[Leicester Racecourse]].  It becomes London Road, where the dual-carriageway ends, and it enters the city of Leicester, passing the Leicester High School for Girls. There is a crossroads, for Stoughton Road ([[A6030 road|A6030]]) at [[Stoneygate]], and a roundabout with the [[Victoria Park, Leicester|Victoria Park]] Road (B568). It passes close to [[University of Leicester|Leicester University]] and many take-away shops. It crosses the [[Midland Main Line]] near [[Leicester railway station]]. In the centre of Leicester, it is subsumed into Leicester's inner ring-road, the [[A594 road (Leicester)|A594]].\n\n[[File:A6 towards Leicester - geograph.org.uk - 187690.jpg|thumb|left|Quorn-Mountsorrel bypass north of Leicester]]\nIt crosses the [[Grand Union Canal]] and the [[River Soar]] as St Margarets Way. It becomes dual-carriageway on the northern outskirts of Leicester, and passes the [[National Space Centre]] in [[Belgrave, Leicestershire|Belgrave]] as Abbey Lane. Later, it meets a roundabout with the A563 outer ring-road entering the borough of [[Charnwood (borough)|Charnwood]]. North of Leicester, as Loughborough Road, it meets the A46 [[Leicester Western Bypass]] just south of [[Rothley, Leicestershire|Rothley]] and the start of the four-mile (6.4&nbsp;km) dual-carriageway [[Quorndon|Quorn]]-[[Mountsorrel]] Bypass. The road at this point follows the [[Soar Valley]], and is mostly on embankment or viaduct, crossing the river four times. From here the road goes through Loughborough. North of [[Hathern]], there is a dual-carriageway section which skirts the Leicestershire\u2013[[Nottinghamshire]] border (the River Soar). The road becomes London Road and enters the district of [[North West Leicestershire]]. It passes through [[Kegworth]], and becomes Derby Road. It joins the [[M1 motorway|M1]] and [[A453 road|A453]] at the extremely busy roundabout of junction 24, which is where the [[A50 road|A50]] Derby to Stoke-on-Trent Link begins. The road follows one of the former A6 dual-carriageway sections, passing [[Lockington, Leicestershire|Lockington]], before meeting traffic from the south-bound M1 at junction 24a. South-bound traffic on the A6 here has to negotiate a roundabout and a set of traffic lights, which has numerous and lengthy hold-ups at peak times. The three-laned A6 overlaps the A50 for a couple of miles, and there is a junction with the B6540 (former [[A453 road|A453]]). The road crosses the [[Trent and Mersey Canal]] and [[River Trent]], where it enters [[Derbyshire]] and the district of [[South Derbyshire]].\n\n[[Elvaston Castle]] is to the right. The road enters Derby initially along London Road, then at [[Alvaston]] it meets the [[A5111 road|A5111]] Derby Ring Road ('Raynesway). It enters [[Crewton]] and just after a hump-backed bridge, it passes [[St Osmund's Church, Derby|St Osmund's church]]. There is a roundabout with Ascot Drive near the [[Derby Conference Centre]], and the road exits as Pride Parkway, which is related to the adjacent [[Pride Park]] Business Park and [[Pride Park Stadium]], home of [[Derby County F.C.]]. It eventually reaches [[Litchurch]] near Derby College's new Roundhouse site; the land on which it was built was a former gas works. This section from the first roundabout to Station Approach (B6000) includes a {{convert|900|ft|m|adj=on}} viaduct, with {{convert|180|ft|m|adj=on}} spans, that crosses the Midland Main Line. The A6 meets a former route beside [[Intu Derby]], a former roundabout that was replaced with traffic lights with a [[multi-storey car park]] in the centre. The road overlaps the A601, Derby's inner ring-road and the [[A52 road|A52]], crossing the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|River Derwent]], then leaving as King Street at an intersection on St Alkmund's Way near the former site of [[Alcmund of Derby|St Alkmund]]'s Church. This section to the A38 has a weight limit. As Garden Street, it splits in two at an elongated roundabout surrounding a service station and a pub. At a roundabout known locally as the Five Lamps, it becomes Duffield Road. North of Derby, there is the Palm Court roundabout (named after the former Palm Court caf\u00e9 which closed in 2005), a junction with the [[A38 road|A38]]. It follows the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|Derwent]] Valley, entering the district of [[Amber Valley]] through [[Duffield, Derbyshire|Duffield]] and [[Belper]].  At [[Whatstandwell]] it meets the B5035 (for [[Crich]] and [[Wirksworth]]), then enters the district of [[Derbyshire Dales]].

Entering [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], it crosses the [[River Petteril]] (near a large radio mast) then the [[Tyne Valley Line|Tyne Valley railway line]]. The A6 travels through south-eastern Carlisle as London Road, before finishing at Botchergate in the centre of Carlisle where it transforms seamlessly into the [[A7 road (Great Britain)|A7]] which runs out of Carlisle and across the Anglo-Scottish border terminating eventually at [[Scotland]]'s capital city of [[Edinburgh]].\n\n==Former route south of Luton==\nThe route of the old A6 south of Luton is now the [[A1081 road|A1081]] for most of its length. In the initial road numbering scheme, the A6 started in [[Chipping Barnet|Barnet]] where it joined what was then the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]]. From Barnet the road went to [[London Colney]], [[St Albans]], [[Harpenden]] to join the current start of the road at [[Luton]].  At [[St Albans]], the road met the then [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]] at a crossroads: going north on both roads, the A5 arriving from the south-west, and leaving the crossroads north-west, and the A6 arriving from the south-east and leaving to the north-east. Nowadays that stretch of the A5 has ''also'' been renumbered so that the crossroads in St Albans is now [[A5183 road|A5183]] and A1081.\n\n==See also==\n* [[A6 murder]] \u2013 the August 1961 murder of Michael Gregsten at a lay-by on the A6 in [[Bedfordshire]], and the controversial trial and execution of [[James Hanratty]] for the crime.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Attached KML|display=inline,title}}\n{{commons category|A6 road (England)}}\n* [http://www.route6.co.uk/index.html The A6 and M6 website]\n* [http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/roadlists/f99/6.shtml Society for All British Road Enthusiasts entry for the A6]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071027174239/http://www.road-to-nowhere.co.uk/route-guides/A6/ Road to Nowhere: A6]\n* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/northamptonshire/3185941.stm Badgers on the Rothwell-Desborough Bypass]\n* [http://alvaston-bypass.i8.com Road Protest Alvaston Improvement Site.]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050930231959/http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/a_roads/a6/alvaston/ Highways Agency Alvaston Improvement.]\n* [http://www.cbrd.co.uk/futures/completed/a6.shtml CBRD Alvaston Bypass.]\n* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/derbyshire/3326969.stm Alvaston Bypass opens.]\n* [http://www.cbrd.co.uk/futures/bin/a555.shtml CBRD A555 (former A6(M)).]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051025095740/http://www.u-to-us.com/semmmsp1/ Stockport bypass.]\n\n{{GB A road zone 6}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:6-0006a}}\n[[Category:Roads in Cheshire]]\n[[Category:Roads in Cumbria]]\n[[Category:Roads in England]]\n[[Category:Transport in Bedfordshire]]\n[[Category:Transport in Derby]]\n[[Category:Roads in Derbyshire]]\n[[Category:Roads in Greater Manchester]]\n[[Category:Roads in Lancashire]]\n[[Category:Transport in Leicestershire]]\n[[Category:Transport in Manchester]]\n[[Category:Transport in Northamptonshire]]\n[[Category:Transport in Nottinghamshire]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the A6 road in England|other roads of the same name|List of A6 roads}}\n{{more citations needed|date=August 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2013}}\n{{Use British English|date=February 2013}}\n\n{{Infobox road\n| country=GBR\n| type=A\n| route=6\n| map=[[File:A6 road map.jpg|195px]]|map_custom=yes\n| direction_a= South\n| direction_b=North\n| length_mi= 282\n| terminus_a= [[Luton]]<br>{{coord|51.8782|-0.4080|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A6 road (southern end)}}\n| destinations= <br>[[Bedford]]<br>[[Kettering]]<br>[[Market Harborough]]<br>[[Leicester]]<br>[[Loughborough]]<br>[[Derby]]<br>[[Matlock, Derbyshire|Matlock]]<br>[[Buxton]]<br>[[Stockport]]<br>[[Manchester]]<br>[[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]]<br>[[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]]<br>[[Kendal]]<br>[[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]]\n| terminus_b= [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]]<br>{{coord|54.8954|-2.9311|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A6 road (northern end)}}\n| junction= <div>\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|421|name1= }}<br>\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|45|name1= }}<br>\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|14|name1= }}\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|427|name1= }}<br>\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|563|name1= }}<br>\n<span class=\"nowrap\">[[Image:UK road A594.PNG|x19px|alt=A594|link=]] [[A594 road (Leicester)|A594 road]]</span>\n<br>\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|46|name1= }}<br>\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|50|name1= }}<br>\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|38|name1= }}<br>\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|53|name1= }}<br>\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|624|name1= }}<br>\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|57|name1= }}<br>\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|580|name1= }}<br>\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|58|name1= }}<br>\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|49|name1= }}<br>\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|59|name1= }}<br>\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|683|name1= }}<br>\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|590|name1= }}<br>\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|65|name1= }}<br>\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|684|name1= }}<br>\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|66|name1= }}<br>\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|69|name1= }}<br>\n{{jct|country=GBR|A|7|name1= }}\n</div>\n}}\n\nThe '''A6''' is one of the main historic north\u2013south roads in [[England]]. It currently runs from [[Luton]] in [[Bedfordshire]] to [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] in [[Cumbria]], although it formerly started at a junction with the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] at [[Chipping Barnet|Barnet]]. It is the fourth longest numbered road in Britain, behind only the A1, [[A38 road|A38]] and [[A30 road|A30]].\n\nRunning north-west from Luton, the road travels through [[Bedford, Bedfordshire|Bedford]], bypasses [[Rushden]], [[Kettering]] and [[Market Harborough]], continues through [[Leicester]], [[Loughborough]], [[Derby]] and [[Matlock, Derbyshire|Matlock]] before going through the [[Peak District]] to [[Bakewell]], [[Buxton]], [[Stockport]], [[Manchester]], [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], [[Pendleton, Greater Manchester|Pendleton]], [[Irlams o' th' Height]], [[Pendlebury]], [[Swinton, Greater Manchester|Swinton]], [[Wardley, Greater Manchester|Wardley]], [[Linnyshaw]], [[Walkden]], [[Little Hulton]], [[Bolton]], [[Chorley]], [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], [[Kendal]] and [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]] before reaching [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]].\n\nSouth of Derby, the road is paralleled by the [[M1 motorway]], between Manchester and Preston the [[M6 motorway|M6]] and [[M61 motorway|M61]] motorways approximate its course, and from Preston to its northern terminus in Carlisle it is paralleled by the M6 only. Between Derby and Manchester the A6 follows a completely different routing to the motorway network, crossing the [[Peak District]] rather than going around it. Because of these duplications, the A6 is less important than it was formerly.\n\n==Route==\n\n===Luton\u2013Kettering===\nThe A6 begins as St Mary's Road at an elongated roundabout with the [[A505 road]]{{spaced ndash}}part of the Luton inner [[ring road]]. The A6 follows Guildford Street{{spaced ndash}}near the [[Luton railway station|railway station]]{{spaced ndash}}and into New Bedford Road. It meets the A5228 outer ring road at a roundabout. On the outskirts of Luton, now Barton Road, it meets the [[Icknield Way Path]]. Leaving Luton, it enters [[Central Bedfordshire]] after a roundabout with Quantock Rise.\n\n[[File:Roundabout on the A6 - geograph.org.uk - 420.jpg|thumb|left|Start of Barton-le-Clay bypass near [[Streatley, Bedfordshire|Streatley]] ]]\nThere is a roundabout at [[Streatley, Bedfordshire|Streatley]], where the road becomes the dual-carriageway Luton Road, passing through the Bartonhill Cutting. The road becomes single carriageway at the roundabout with the B655 at the other end of the [[Barton-le-Clay]] bypass. It meets the [[A507 road|A507]] at a roundabout at [[Clophill]], crossing the [[River Flit]]. It passes by Maulden Wood as the dual-carriage up Deadman's Hill then passes Haynes West End.

It meets the A5141 again at a roundabout near [[Bedford Modern School]] and a large [[Sainsbury's]] supermarket and becomes the dual-carriageway Paula Radcliffe Way; it formerly passed through Clapham itself before the construction of the Paula Radcliffe Way Bypass in 2001.\n\n[[File:Oakley, A6 Clapham Bypass - geograph.org.uk - 91316.jpg|thumb|right|Clapham bypass near Oakley]]\n[[File:Irthlingborough Viaduct - geograph.org.uk - 90947.jpg|thumb|right|Irthlingborough Viaduct built over the Nene in 1936]]\nThe A6 crosses the [[River Great Ouse]] twice more, and is crossed by the [[John Bunyan Trail]], near a GSJ for Clapham and [[Oakley, Bedfordshire|Oakley]]. There is another GSJ for Highfield Parc Industrial Estate. At the end of the bypass, the road suddenly loses the broad expanse of tarmac and looks like a minor [[B roads in Great Britain|B road]] and becomes Bedford Road; there are speed cameras here. It passes through Milton Ernest, passing the Queen's Head pub and the exit for the notorious [[Yarl's Wood Immigration Removal Centre]]. It then carries on for around three miles, passing the Falcon pub near [[Bletsoe]] then passes [[Sharnbrook]] at a Roundabout.

It passes through the village of Wymington, and passes the exit to the well known [[Santa Pod Raceway]], bypasses the towns of [[Rushden]] and [[Higham Ferrers]], arriving at the Chown's Mill roundabout with the [[A45 road|A45]]. From here the road bridges the [[River Nene]] and the [[Nene Way]] before bypassing [[Irthlingborough]]. The A6 then passes through the town of [[Finedon]] and intersects the [[A510 road|A510]] at a roundabout. Leaving Finedon, the road then passes the [[Burton Wold Wind Farm]] and bypasses the town of [[Burton Latimer]], finally arriving at Junction 10 of the [[A14 road (England)|A14]] at [[Barton Seagrave]].\n\n===Kettering\u2013Leicester===\nKettering was bypassed when sections of the east-west corridor [[A14 road (Great Britain)|A14]] were built. The road enters [[Leicestershire]] and the district of [[Harborough District|Harborough]] as Harborough Road at the start of the five-mile (8&nbsp;km) Market Harborough Bypass. It briefly re-enters Northamptonshire again, and at this point there is a roundabout with the [[A427 road|A427]] (for [[Stoke Albany]]) and A4304 (former A427), and an exit for [[Great Bowden]].\n\n[[File:A6 towards Market Harborough - geograph.org.uk - 203584.jpg|thumb|right|Southern end of the Great Glen bypass looking south]]\nIt is crossed by the Leicestershire Round. There is a turn for [[Foxton, Leicestershire|Foxton]] and [[Foxton Locks]]. It is crossed by the Midland Main Line. The A6 still passes through [[Kibworth]]. The road becomes Leicester Road. It crosses the [[River Sence]] and there is a roundabout. The bypass ends with a roundabout, just before the road enters the district of [[Oadby and Wigston]].\n\n===Leicester\u2013Peak District===\nOn the outskirts of Leicester the road becomes London Road. There is a roundabout with Florence Wragg Way, where the road becomes Glen Road It then becomes Leicester Road before reaching the outer ring-road ([[A563 road|A563]]), next to [[Leicester Racecourse]].  It becomes London Road, where the dual-carriageway ends, and it enters the city of Leicester, passing the Leicester High School for Girls. There is a crossroads, for Stoughton Road ([[A6030 road|A6030]]) at [[Stoneygate]], and a roundabout with the [[Victoria Park, Leicester|Victoria Park]] Road (B568).

The road becomes London Road and enters the district of [[North West Leicestershire]]. It passes through [[Kegworth]], and becomes Derby Road. It joins the [[M1 motorway|M1]] and [[A453 road|A453]] at the extremely busy roundabout of junction 24, which is where the [[A50 road|A50]] Derby to Stoke-on-Trent Link begins. The road follows one of the former A6 dual-carriageway sections, passing [[Lockington, Leicestershire|Lockington]], before meeting traffic from the south-bound M1 at junction 24a. South-bound traffic on the A6 here has to negotiate a roundabout and a set of traffic lights, which has numerous and lengthy hold-ups at peak times. The three-laned A6 overlaps the A50 for a couple of miles, and there is a junction with the B6540 (former [[A453 road|A453]]). The road crosses the [[Trent and Mersey Canal]] and [[River Trent]], where it enters [[Derbyshire]] and the district of [[South Derbyshire]].\n\n[[Elvaston Castle]] is to the right.

This section from the first roundabout to Station Approach (B6000) includes a {{convert|900|ft|m|adj=on}} viaduct, with {{convert|180|ft|m|adj=on}} spans, that crosses the Midland Main Line. The A6 meets a former route beside [[Intu Derby]], a former roundabout that was replaced with traffic lights with a [[multi-storey car park]] in the centre. The road overlaps the A601, Derby's inner ring-road and the [[A52 road|A52]], crossing the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|River Derwent]], then leaving as King Street at an intersection on St Alkmund's Way near the former site of [[Alcmund of Derby|St Alkmund]]'s Church. This section to the A38 has a weight limit. As Garden Street, it splits in two at an elongated roundabout surrounding a service station and a pub. At a roundabout known locally as the Five Lamps, it becomes Duffield Road. North of Derby, there is the Palm Court roundabout (named after the former Palm Court caf\u00e9 which closed in 2005), a junction with the [[A38 road|A38]].

A first is the elimination of [[bleed air]] systems using high temperature/high pressure air from the propulsion engines to power aircraft systems such as the starting, air-conditioning and anti-ice systems. Both engines enable the move towards the ''More Electric Aircraft'', that is, the concept of replacing previously hydraulic and pneumatic systems with electrical ones to reduce weight, increase efficiency, and reduce maintenance requirements.\n\nThe GEnx was expected to produce thrust from {{convert|53000|to|75000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} with first tests commencing in 2006 and service entry by 2008 (delayed by 787 deliveries). Boeing predicts reduced fuel consumption of up to 20% and significantly quieter engines than current turbofans. A {{cvt|66500|lbf|kN}} thrust version (GEnx-2B67) will be used on the 747-8. Unlike the initial version, for the 787, this version has a traditional bleed air system to power internal pneumatic and ventilation systems. It will also have a smaller overall diameter than the initial model to accommodate installation on the 747.\n\nGeneral Electric began initial test runs of the bleedless GEnx variant on 19 March 2006.<ref name=\"fi_20060321\">\"[http://www.flightglobal.com/Articles/2006/03/21/Navigation/177/205589/General+Electric+performs+first+run+of+new+GENx+engine.html General Electric Performs First Run of New GEnx Engine].\" ''[[Flight International]]''. 21 March 2006.</ref> The first flight with one of these engines took place on 22 February 2007, using a [[Boeing 747-100]], fitted with one GEnx engine in the number 2 (inboard left hand side) position.\n\nBy Fall 2019, General Electric was offering the GEnx-2B, developed for the 747-8, for the revised [[Boeing_767#Re-engined_767-XF|767-XF]] variant based on the 767-400ER, but needed enough volume to cover the new product certification.<ref name=AvWeek15nov2019>{{Cite news |url= https://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/ge-talks-airbus-over-potential-a350neo |title= GE In Talks With Airbus Over Potential A350neo |date= Nov 15, 2019 |author= Guy Norris |work= Aviation Week}}</ref>\n\n==Operational history==\nIntroduced in late 2011 on a 747-8 freighter, [[Cargolux]] surpassed one million flight hours in early 2017.<ref name=MRO31aug2017/>  In the summer of 2012, three engines suffered Low Pressure Turbine (LPT) failures.

A first is the elimination of [[bleed air]] systems using high temperature/high pressure air from the propulsion engines to power aircraft systems such as the starting, air-conditioning and anti-ice systems. Both engines enable the move towards the ''More Electric Aircraft'', that is, the concept of replacing previously hydraulic and pneumatic systems with electrical ones to reduce weight, increase efficiency, and reduce maintenance requirements.\n\nThe GEnx was expected to produce thrust from {{convert|53000|to|75000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} with first tests commencing in 2006 and service entry by 2008 (delayed by 787 deliveries). Boeing predicts reduced fuel consumption of up to 20% and significantly quieter engines than current turbofans. A {{cvt|66500|lbf|kN}} thrust version (GEnx-2B67) will be used on the 747-8. Unlike the initial version, for the 787, this version has a traditional bleed air system to power internal pneumatic and ventilation systems. It will also have a smaller overall diameter than the initial model to accommodate installation on the 747.\n\nGeneral Electric began initial test runs of the bleedless GEnx variant on 19 March 2006.<ref name=\"fi_20060321\">\"[http://www.flightglobal.com/Articles/2006/03/21/Navigation/177/205589/General+Electric+performs+first+run+of+new+GENx+engine.html General Electric Performs First Run of New GEnx Engine].\" ''[[Flight International]]''. 21 March 2006.</ref> The first flight with one of these engines took place on 22 February 2007, using a [[Boeing 747-100]], fitted with one GEnx engine in the number 2 (inboard left hand side) position.\n\nBy Fall 2019, General Electric was offering the GEnx-2B, developed for the 747-8, for the revised [[Boeing_767#Re-engined_767-XF|767-XF]] variant based on the 767-400ER, but needed enough volume to cover the new product certification.<ref name=AvWeek15nov2019>{{Cite news |url= https://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/ge-talks-airbus-over-potential-a350neo |title= GE In Talks With Airbus Over Potential A350neo |date= Nov 15, 2019 |author= Guy Norris |work= Aviation Week}}</ref>\n\n==Operational history==\nIntroduced in late 2011 on a 747-8 freighter, [[Cargolux]] surpassed one million flight hours in early 2017.<ref name=MRO31aug2017/>  In the summer of 2012, three engines suffered Low Pressure Turbine (LPT) failures.

A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor.

It is possible that dysfunction within the respiratory centre further exarcebates the [[ARDS]] seen in COVID-19 patients.

A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor.

Much later in the movie, Sally and Brian become lovers, concluding that his previous failures with women were because they were \"the wrong three girls\".\n\nMaximilian von Heune, a rich playboy baron, befriends Sally and takes her and Brian to his country estate where they are both spoiled and courted. After an unexplained off-screen experience with Brian, Max drops his pursuit of the pair in anger. During an argument, Sally tells Brian that she has been having sex with Max, and Brian reveals that he has as well. Brian and Sally later reconcile, and Sally reveals that Max left them 300 marks and mockingly compares the sum with what a professional prostitute gets.\n\nSally learns that she is pregnant but is unsure of the father. Brian offers to marry her and take her back to his university life in Cambridge. At first, they celebrate their resolution to start this new life together, but after a picnic between Sally and Brian, in which Brian acts distant and uninterested, Sally becomes disheartened by the vision of herself as a bored faculty wife washing dirty diapers. Ultimately, she has an abortion, without informing Brian in advance. When he confronts her, she shares her fears, and the two reach an understanding. Brian departs for England, and Sally continues her life in Berlin, embedding herself in the Kit Kat Club.\n \nA subplot concerns Fritz Wendel, a German Jew passing as a Protestant, who is in love with Natalia Landauer, a wealthy German Jewish heiress who holds him in contempt and suspects his motives. Sally advises him to be more aggressive, which eventually enables Fritz to win her love. However, to gain her parents' consent for their marriage, Fritz must reveal his religion, which he does and the two are married by a rabbi.\n\nThe rise of fascism is an ever-present undercurrent throughout the film. Their progress can be tracked through the characters' changing actions and attitudes. While in the beginning of the film, a Nazi is kicked out of the Kit Kat Klub, the final shot of the film shows the cabaret's audience is dominated by uniformed Nazis. The rise of the Nazis is also demonstrated in a rural [[beer garden]] scene. A blonde boy\u2014only his face is seen initially\u2014sings to an audience of all ages (\"Tomorrow Belongs To Me\") about the beauties of nature and youth. The camera shifts to show that the singer is wearing the black shorts and tan shirt of the [[Hitler Youth]] uniform. The ballad transforms into a militant Nazi anthem, and one by one nearly all the adults and young people watching rise and join in the singing. \"Do you still think you can control them?\" Brian asks Max. Later, Brian's confrontation with a Nazi in the streets of Berlin leads to nothing but him being beaten.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Liza Minnelli]] as [[Sally Bowles]]\n* [[Michael York]] as Brian Roberts\n* [[Helmut Griem]] as Baron Maximilian von Heune\n* [[Joel Grey]] as Master of Ceremonies\n* [[Fritz Wepper]] as Fritz Wendel\n* [[Marisa Berenson]] as Natalia Landauer\n* [[Elisabeth Neumann-Viertel]] as Fr\u00e4ulein Schneider\n* [[Helen Vita]] as Fr\u00e4ulein Kost\n* Sigrid von Richthofen as Fr\u00e4ulein Mayr\n* [[Gerd Vespermann]] as Bobby\n* [[Ralf Wolter]] as Herr Ludwig\n* Georg Hartmann as Willi\n* [[Ricky Ren\u00e9e]] as Elke, transvestite in Kit Kat Club\n* Estrongo Nachama as Cantor\n\n=== Kit-Kat Dancers ===\n* [[Kathryn Doby]]\n* Inge Jaeger\n* Angelika Koch\n* Helen Velkovorska\n* Gitta Schmidt\n* Louise Quick\n}}\n\nIn addition, in a joint uncredited role, Oliver Collignon plays the [[Hitler Youth|Nazi youth]], with his singing voice for \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\" [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] by [[Mark Lambert (American actor)|Mark Lambert]].<ref name=\"Legge 2008\"/><ref name=\"TCM Notes\"/>\n\n== Production ==\n=== Historical basis ===\n{{Further|Christopher Isherwood|Jean Ross}}\n{{CSS image crop|Image = Jean ross.jpg|bSize = 310|cWidth = 200|cHeight = 190|oTop = 25|oLeft = 50|Location = right|Description = The character of [[Sally Bowles]] was based upon [[Jean Ross]], a British cabaret singer with whom Isherwood lived as a room-mate in Weimar-era Berlin.|Link=Jean Ross}}\n\nThe 1972 film was based upon Christopher Isherwood's semi-autobiographical stories.<ref name=\"Frost 2013\"/> In 1929\u20131930, Isherwood relocated to [[Weimar culture|Weimar Berlin]] in order to pursue life as an openly gay man and to enjoy the city's gay nightlife.<ref name=\"Moss 1979\"/> Members of Isherwood's Berlin social circle included authors [[W.H.

Fosse ultimately was hired. Over the next months, Fosse met with previously hired screenwriter [[Jay Allen|Jay Presson Allen]] to discuss the screenplay.{{r|Garebian 2011|pp=136-139}}\n\n=== Screenplay revisions ===\nAs production neared, Fosse became increasingly dissatisfied with Allen's script which was based on [[Joe Masteroff]]'s original book of the stage version. Fosse hired [[Hugh Wheeler]] to rewrite and revise Allen's work.{{r|Garebian 2011|pp=136-139}} Wheeler was referred to as a \"research consultant,\" while Allen retained screenwriting credit. Wheeler, a friend of Christopher Isherwood,<ref name=\"Day 1974\"/> knew that Isherwood had been critical of the stage musical due to its bowdlerizations of his material.<ref name=\"Day 1974\"/> Wheeler went back to Isherwood's original stories in order to ensure a more faithful adaptation of the source material. In particular, Wheeler restored the subplot about the gigolo and the Jewish heiress. Wheeler also drew on gay author Christopher Isherwood's openness about his homosexuality to make the leading male character a [[bisexual]] man \"rather than the heterosexual as he had been in the stage musical.\"{{r|Garebian 2011|p=139}}\n\nFosse decided to increase the focus on the Kit Kat Klub, where Sally performs, as a metaphor for the decadence of Germany in the 1930s by eliminating all but one of the musical numbers performed outside the club.

Minnelli modeled the character's appearance upon [[Louise Brooks]] (right), an American actress who was famous in 1930s [[Weimar Germany]].{{r|Garebian 2011|p=142}}\n}}\nFeuer had cast [[Liza Minnelli]] as [[Sally Bowles]] and [[Joel Grey]] (reprising his stage role) long before Fosse was attached to the project. Fosse was given the option of using Grey as Master of Ceremonies or walking away from the production.{{r|Garebian 2011|p=147-148}} Fosse hired [[Michael York]] as Sally Bowles's bisexual love interest, a casting choice which Minnelli initially believed was incorrect until she performed with him.{{r|Garebian 2011|p=146}} Several smaller roles, as well as the remaining four dancers in the film, eventually were cast in Germany.\n\nMinnelli had auditioned to play Sally in the original Broadway production but was deemed too inexperienced at the time, even though she had already won Broadway's [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical]]. By the time ''Cabaret'' reached the screen, however, Minnelli was a film star having won an Oscar nomination as the emotionally damaged college student in ''[[The Sterile Cuckoo]]'' (1969).\n\nFor her performance as Sally in the film, Minnelli reinterpreted the character and\u2014at the explicit suggestion of her father [[Theatre director|stage director]] [[Vincente Minnelli]]<ref name=\"Minnelli 2006\"/>\u2014she deliberately imitated film actress [[Louise Brooks]], a [[flapper|flapper icon]] and [[sex symbol]] of the [[Jazz Age]].<ref name=\"Minnelli 2006\"/>{{r|Garebian 2011|p=142}} Brooks, much like the character of Sally Bowles in the film, was an aspiring actress and American [[Expatriate|expat]] who temporarily moved to Weimar Berlin in search of international stardom.{{r|Garebian 2011|p=139}} Minnelli later recalled: \n\n{{Quote|\"I went to my father and asked him, 'What can you tell me about 1930s glamour? Should I be emulating [[Marlene Dietrich]] or something?' And he said 'No, study everything you can about [[Louise Brooks]].'\"<ref name=\"Minnelli 2006\"/>}}\n\nIn particular, Minnelli drew upon Brooks' \"[[Pandora's Box (1929 film)|Lulu makeup]] and [[Shingle bob|helmet-like coiffure]].\"{{r|Garebian 2011|p=142}} For the meeting between Sally Bowles and Brian Roberts, Minnelli modeled her movements and demeanor upon Brooks; in particular, the scene in ''[[Pandora's Box (1929 film)|Pandora's Box]]'' (1929) where Brooks' carefree character of Lulu is first introduced.<ref name=\"Garebian 2011\"/> Ultimately, Minnelli would win the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her portrayal of Sally Bowles.<ref name=\"Buck 1973\"/>\n\n=== Filming ===\nFosse and Feuer traveled to West Germany, where producers chose to shoot the film, in order to finish assembling the film crew. During this time, Fosse highly recommended [[Robert Surtees (cinematographer)|Robert L. Surtees]] for cinematographer, but Feuer and the top executives saw Surtees's work on ''Sweet Charity'' as one of the film's many artistic problems. Producers eventually chose British cinematographer [[Geoffrey Unsworth]].{{r|Garebian 2011|pp=138, 149}} Designers [[Rolf Zehetbauer]], [[Hans J\u00fcrgen Kiebach]] and [[Herbert Strabel]] served as production designers. Charlotte Flemming designed costumes.{{r|Garebian 2011|p=205}} Fosse dancer [[Kathryn Doby]], Louise Quick and John Sharpe were brought on as Fosse's dance aides.\n\nRehearsals and filming took place entirely in West Germany. For reasons of economy, indoor scenes were shot at the [[Bavaria Studios|Bavaria Film Studios]] in [[Gr\u00fcnwald, Bavaria|Gr\u00fcnwald]],{{r|Garebian 2011|p=143}} outside Munich.<ref name=\"TCM Notes\"/>{{r|Garebian 2011|p=146}} Location shooting took place in and around Munich and [[West Berlin]], and in [[Schleswig-Holstein]] and [[Saxony]] {{Citation needed|reason=needs confirmation, filming in East Germany unlikely|date=June 2019}}. Editing was done in Los Angeles before the eventual theatrical release in February 1972.\n\n=== Narrative and news reading ===\nAlthough the songs throughout the film allude to and advance the narrative, every song except \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\" is executed in the context of a Kit Kat Klub performance.<ref name=\"Russell 2002\"/><ref name=\"Benedict 2002\"/> The voice heard on the radio reading the news throughout the film in German was that of associate producer Harold Nebenzal, whose father [[Seymour Nebenzahl]] produced such notable [[Weimar]] films as ''[[M (1931 film)|M]]'' (1931), ''[[Testament of Dr. Mabuse]]'' (1933), and ''[[Threepenny Opera (film)|Threepenny Opera]]'' (1931).\n\n== Differences between film and stage version ==\nThe film is significantly different from the Broadway musical. In the stage version, [[Sally Bowles]] is English (as she was in Christopher Isherwood's \"[[Goodbye to Berlin]]\"). In the film version, she is American.<ref name=\"Greenspun 1972\"/> The character of Cliff Bradshaw was renamed Brian Roberts and made British (as was Isherwood, upon whom the character was based) rather than American as in the stage version.<ref name=\"Greenspun 1972\"/>{{r|Garebian 2011|p=139}} The characters and plot lines involving Fritz, Natalia and Max were pulled from ''[[I Am a Camera]]'' and did not appear in the stage version of ''Cabaret'' (or in \"Goodbye to Berlin\").<ref name=\"Day 1974\"/>\n\nThe most significant change from the original stage version of ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'' involves the cutting of the two main characters: Fraulein Schneider, who runs a boarding house, and her love interest, Herr Schultz, a German grocer.{{r|Garebian 2011|p=34}} The plot line of their doomed romance, and the consequences of a German falling in love with a Jew during the rise of antisemitism was cut. Also cut were the joyous \"So What?\" and the heart-wrenching \"What Would You Do\", sung by Schneider, the song \"Meeskite\", sung by Schultz,{{r|Garebian 2011|p=83}} and their two duets \"It Couldn't Please Me More (The Pineapple Song)\" (cut) and \"Married\" (reset as a piano instrumental, and a phonograph record), as well as a short reprise of \"Married\", sung alone by Schultz.<ref name=\"Internet Broadway Database\"/>{{r|Garebian 2011|pp=34, 83}}\n\nKander and Ebb wrote several new songs for the film and removed others.<ref name=\"Greenspun 1972\"/><ref name=\"TCM Notes\"/> \"Don't Tell Mama\" was replaced by \"Mein Herr\",{{r|Garebian 2011|p=143}} and \"The Money Song\" (retained in an instrumental version as \"Sitting Pretty\") was replaced by \"Money, Money.\"{{r|Garebian 2011|pp=141-43}} \"Mein Herr\" and \"Money, Money\", which were composed for the film version, were added to performances of the stage musical alongside the original numbers.{{r|Garebian 2011|pp=141-43}} The song \"[[Maybe This Time (song)|Maybe This Time]]\", which Sally performs at the cabaret, was not written for the film.{{r|Garebian 2011|pp=141-43}} Although \"Don't Tell Mama\" and \"Married\" were removed as performed musical numbers, both were used in the film. The former's bridge section appears as instrumental music played on Sally's gramophone; the latter is initially played on the piano in Fraulein Schneider's parlor and later heard on Sally's gramophone in a German translation (\"Heiraten\") sung by cabaret singer [[Greta Keller]].{{r|Garebian 2011|p=155}} Additionally, the song \"[[If You Could See Her]],\" performed by the Emcee, originally concluded with the line \"She wouldn't be meeskite at all\" in the Broadway production. In the film, the song concludes with the line \"She wouldn't look Jewish at all,\" a return to the original lyrics by [[Fred Ebb]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Belletto|first=Steven|date=2008|title=\"CABARET\" AND ANTIFASCIST AESTHETICS|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/23130878|journal=Criticism|volume=50|issue=4|pages=609\u2013630|issn=0011-1589}}</ref>\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = Cabaret: Original Soundtrack Recording<ref name=\"Cabaret Soundtrack\"/><ref name=\"Original Recording\"/>\n| total_length    = 38:14\n| all_writing     = [[Kander and Ebb|John Kander and Fred Ebb]]\n| extra_column    = Performer\n\n| title1          = [[Willkommen]]\n| extra1          = [[Joel Grey]]\n| length1         = 4:29\n\n| title2          = Mein Herr\n| extra2          = [[Liza Minnelli]]\n| length2         = 3:36\n\n| title3          = [[Maybe This Time (song)|Maybe This Time]]\n| extra3          = Liza Minnelli\n| length3         = 3:11\n\n| title4          = Money, Money\n| extra4          = Joel Grey, Liza Minnelli\n| length4         = 3:04\n\n| title5          = Two Ladies\n| extra5          = Joel Grey\n| length5         = 3:11\n\n| title6          = Sitting Pretty\n| extra6          = Instrumental\n| length6         = 2:27\n\n| title7          = Tomorrow Belongs to Me\n| extra7          = [[Mark Lambert (American actor)|Mark Lambert]]<ref name=\"TCM Notes\"/>\n| length7         = 3:06\n\n| title8          = Tiller Girls\n| extra8          = Joel Grey\n| length8         = 1:41\n\n| title9          = Heiraten (Married)\n| extra9          = [[Greta Keller]]\n| length9         = 3:45\n\n| title10         = If You Could See Her\n| extra10         = Joel Grey\n| length10        = 3:54\n\n| title11         = [[Cabaret (Cabaret song)|Cabaret]]\n| extra11         = Liza Minnelli\n| length11        = 3:34\n\n| title12         = Finale\n| extra12         = Joel Grey\n| length12        = 2:28\n}}\n\n=== Certifications ===\n{{Certification Table Top}}\n{{Certification Table Entry|type=album|region=United States|artist=Liza Minnelli|title=Cabaret (soundtrack)|award=Gold|relyear=1972|certyear=1973|salesamount=500,000|refname=riaa}}\n{{Certification Table Bottom}}\n\n== Release and reaction ==\n[[Image:1972 - Capri Theater Ad - 12 May MC - Allentown PA.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Newspaper ad for the film]]\nThe film was immediately successful at the box office.

Part of its success comes because it doesn't fall for the old clich\u00e9 that musicals have to make you happy. Instead of cheapening the movie version by lightening its load of despair, director Bob Fosse has gone right to the bleak heart of the material and stayed there well enough to win an [[Academy Award for Best Director]].\"<ref name=\"Ebert 1972\"/> \n\nA ''Variety'' staff critic appraised the film in December 1971: \"The film version of the 1966 John Kander-Fred Ebb Broadway musical ''Cabaret'' is most unusual: it is literate, bawdy, sophisticated, sensual, cynical, heart-warming, and disturbingly thought-provoking. Liza Minnelli heads a strong cast. Bob Fosse's generally excellent direction recreates the milieu of Germany some 40 years ago.\"<ref name=\"Variety 1971\"/>\n\n[[Roger Greenspun]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote in February 1972 that \"''Cabaret'' is one of those immensely gratifying imperfect works in which from beginning to end you can literally feel a movie coming to life.\"<ref name=\"Greenspun 1972\"/> Likewise, [[Pauline Kael]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote a review that same month in which she applauded the film: {{Quote|\"A great movie musical. Taking its form from political cabaret, it's a satire of temptations. In a prodigious balancing act, Bob Fosse, the choreographer-director, keeps the period\u2014Berlin, 1931\u2014at a cool distance. We see the decadence as garish and sleazy; yet we also see the animal energy in it\u2014everything seems to become sexualized. The movie does not exploit decadence; rather, it gives it its due. With Joel Grey as our devil-doll host\u2014the master of ceremonies\u2014and Liza Minnelli (in her first singing role on the screen) as exuberant, corruptible [[Sally Bowles]], chasing after the life of a headliner no matter what; Minnelli has such gaiety and electricity that she becomes a star before our eyes.\"<ref name=\"Kael 1972\"/>}}\n\n==== Reaction of Isherwood and others ====\n{{Annotated image|image=W.

He is a bisexual Englishman; he has an affair with Sally and, later, with one of Sally's lovers, a German baron.... Brian's homosexual tendency is treated as an indecent but comic weakness to be snickered at, like [[bed-wetting]].\"{{r|Isherwood 1976|p=63}}}}\n\nSimilarly, Isherwood's friend [[Jean Ross]]\u2014upon whom the character of Sally Bowles was based{{r|Bletchly 2013|p=26}}\u2014was ambivalent about the film.{{r|Isherwood 2012|p=70}} She felt the depiction of 1930s Berlin \"was quite, quite different\" from reality.{{r|Johnstone 1975|pp=33\u201334}} Nevertheless, she conceded that the depiction of their social circle of British expatriates as pleasure-seeking libertines was accurate: \"We were all utterly against the ''[[bourgeois]]'' standards of our parents' generation. That's what took us to [Weimar-era] Berlin. The climate was freer there.\"{{r|Johnstone 1975|pp=33\u201334}} Such ambivalence towards ''Cabaret'' (1972) was not unique among Isherwood's circle.<ref name=\"Spender 1977\"/> The poet [[Stephen Spender]] lamented how ''Cabaret'' (1972) glossed over Weimar Berlin's crushing poverty:\n{{Quote|\"There is not a single meal, or club, in the movie ''Cabaret,'' that Christopher [Isherwood] and I could have afforded [in 1931]. What we mostly knew was the Berlin of poverty, unemployment, political demonstrations and street fighting between forces of the extreme left and the extreme right.\"<ref name=\"Spender 1977\"/>}} Both Spender and Ross contended that the 1972 film and 1966 Broadway musical deleteriously glamorized the harsh realities of the 1930s Weimar era.<ref name=\"Spender 1977\"/>{{r|Johnstone 1975|pp=33\u201334}} \n\n==== Retrospective reviews ====\nIn 2002, Jamie Russell of the [[BBC]] wrote that the film was \"the first musical ever to be given an [[X certificate]], Bob Fosse's ''Cabaret'' launched Liza Minnelli into Hollywood superstardom and re-invented the musical for the Age of Aquarius.\"<ref name=\"Russell 2002\"/> In 2013, film critic [[Peter Bradshaw]] listed ''Cabaret'' at number one on his list of \"Top 10 musicals\", describing it as \"satanically catchy, terrifyingly seductive ... directed and choreographed with electric style by Bob Fosse ... ''Cabaret'' is drenched in the sexiest kind of cynicism and decadent despair.\"<ref name=\"Bradshaw 2013\"/>\n\n==== Controversies ====\nAlthough less explicit compared with other films made in the 1970s, ''Cabaret'' dealt explicitly with topics like corruption, sexual ambiguity, false dreams, and Nazism. Tim Dirks at [[Filmsite.org]] notes: \"The sexually-charged, semi-controversial, kinky musical was the first one ever to be given an X rating (although later re-rated) with its numerous sexual flings and hedonistic club life. There was considerable sexual innuendo, profanity, casual sex talk (homosexual and heterosexual), some evidence of anti-Semitism, and even an abortion in the film.\"<ref name=\"Dirks 2013\"/> It was also rated [[History of British film certificates|X in the UK]] and later re-rated as 15.<ref name=\"Russell 2002\"/><ref name=\"BBFC\"/>\n\nOn the topic of Nazism, there was little consensus among critics about the possibly fascist implications of the film and play. However, critic Steven Belletto wrote a critique of ''Cabaret'' in the Criticism journal, published by [[Wayne State University Press]], in which he highlighted the anti-fascist themes in the film present both within and outside of the musical acts. According to Belletto, \"despite the ways that the film has been understood by a variety of critics, [''Cabaret''] rejects the logic of fascist certainty by staging various numbers committed to irony and ambiguity.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Belletto|first=Steven|date=2008|title=\"CABARET\" AND ANTIFASCIST AESTHETICS|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/23130878|journal=Criticism|volume=50|issue=4|pages=609\u2013630|issn=0011-1589}}</ref>\n\nThe \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\" scene was controversial, with Kander and Ebb, both of whom were Jews, sometimes being wrongly accused of using a [[Nazi songs|historical Nazi song]].<ref name=\"Steyn 1997\"/> According to a November 1976 ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' article, the film was censored in [[West Berlin]] when it was first released there theatrically, with the sequence featuring the Hitler Youth singing \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\" having been deleted.<ref name=\"TCM Notes\"/> This elimination was made \"because of the feeling that it might stir up resentments in the audience by showing the sympathizers for the Nazi movement during the '30s.\"<ref name=\"TCM Notes\"/> The sequence was restored, however, when the film was shown on West German television on November 7, 1976.<ref name=\"TCM Notes\"/>\n\nAnother topic of discussion was the song \"If You Could See Her\",{{r|Belletto 2008|p=610}} which closed with the line: \"If you could see her through my eyes, she wouldn't look Jewish at all.\" The point of the song was showing anti-Semitism as it begins to run rampant in Berlin, but there were a number of Jewish groups who interpreted the lyrics differently.<ref name=\"McLaughlin 2013\"/>{{r|Belletto 2008|p=625}}\n\n=== Accolades ===\n''Cabaret'' earned a total of 10 [[Academy Award]] nominations (winning 8 of them) and holds the [[List of Academy Award records#Film records|record for most Academy Awards won by a film which did not win the Academy Award for Best Picture]].<ref name=\"TCM Notes\"/><ref name=\"Academy Awards\"/>\n\nShortly before the [[45th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], [[Bob Fosse]] won 2 [[Tony Award|Tony Awards]] for directing and choreographing ''[[Pippin (musical)|Pippin]]'', his biggest stage hit to date. Months later, he won the [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for choreographing and directing [[Liza Minnelli]]'s television special ''[[Liza with a Z]]'', he became the first director to win all three awards in one year.\n\n[[Image:Liza Minnelli 1973 Special.JPG|thumb|Minnelli reprised the character of Sally Bowles for an encore performance in the 1973 television special, ''[[Liza with a Z]]'', also directed by [[Bob Fosse]].]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

has been cited by ''[[TV Guide]]'' as among the greatest films ever made,<ref name=\"TV Guide\"/> and in [[Movieline]] magazine as one of the \"100 Best Movies Ever\".<ref name=\"Movieline Magazine\"/> It was included in [[Film4|FilmFour]]'s \"100 Greatest Films of All Time\" at #78<ref name=\"Filmsite.org\"/> and in ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]''{{'}}s \"Hot 100 Films of the Past\", being hailed as \"the last great musical. Liza Minnelli plays Sally Bowles, an American adrift in pre-Nazi Berlin, in Bob Fosse's stylish, near-perfect film.\"<ref name=\"San Francisco Chronicle Film Critics\"/>\n\nDavid Benedict has written in ''[[The Guardian]]'' about ''Cabaret'''s influence in musical films: \"Back then, musicals were already low on film-goers' lists, so how come it was such a success? Simple: ''Cabaret'' is the musical for people who hate them. Given the vibrancy of its now iconic numbers \u2013 Liza Minnelli in [[bowler hat|bowler]] and black suspenders astride a bentwood chair belting out 'Mein Herr' or shimmying and shivering with pleasure over 'Money' with Joel Grey \u2013 it sounds strange to say it, but one of the chief reasons why ''Cabaret'' is so popular is that it's not shot like a musical.\"<ref name=\"Benedict 2002\"/>\n\nThe film has been listed as one of the most important for [[queer cinema]] for its depictions of bisexuality,<ref name=\"Greenspun 1972\"/> arguably transgressive at the time of its 1972 [[Motion Picture Production Code|post-Code]] release and has been credited with turning Liza Minnelli into a [[gay icon]]. Film blogs have selected it as \"the gayest winner in the history of the Academy.\"<ref name=\"Baines 2012\"/><ref name=\"St. James 2017\"/><ref name=\"Out.com\"/>\n\n=== Home media ===\nThe film was first released to DVD in 1998. There have been subsequent releases in 2003, 2008, and 2012. The film's international ancillary distribution rights are owned by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (now part of [[The Walt Disney Company]]), while [[Warner Bros.]] (which acquired the film as part of its purchase of [[Lorimar Productions]], which had previously acquired the film library of [[Monogram Pictures|Allied Artists]]) has domestic distribution rights.\n\nIn April 2012, Warner unveiled a new restoration of the film at the [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM Classic Film Festival]].<ref name=\"McNary 2012\"/><ref name=\"TCM Festival\"/><ref name=\"Elber 2012\"/> A Blu-ray edition was later released in February 2013.<ref name=\"Reuben 2013\"/> Before this restoration, ''Cabaret'' had been sold on a [[standard-definition]] DVD from Warner Bros., but the film was unavailable in [[High-definition video|high-definition]] or for [[Digital cinema|digital projections]] in cinemas.<ref name=\"Elber 2012\"/> The original camera negative is lost, and a surviving [[interpositive]] had a vertical scratch that ran through 1,000 feet, or 10 minutes, of one of its reels, as confirmed by Ned Price, vice president of mastering and restoration for Warner Bros..<ref name=\"Elber 2012\"/> The damage ostensibly was inflicted by a grain of dirt that had rolled through the length of the reel, beginning with a scene in which Michael York's character confronts a pro-Nazi boarding house resident, and had cut into the emulsion.<ref name=\"Elber 2012\"/> The marred frames were digitally restored, but \"the difficult part was matching the grain structure so the fix was invisible.\" After automated digital repair attempts failed, the 1,000 feet<!-- article said 1.4&nbsp;million frames, but that does not calculate. 10 minutes x 60 seconds/minute = 600 seconds x 24

As with \"Ol' Man River\", when Cabaret called for an ostensibly innocent pastoral hymn to German nationalism, John Kander and Fred Ebb turned in such a plausible doppelganger that it was immediately denounced as a grossly offensive Nazi anthem. \"The accusations against Tomorrow Belongs To Me' made me very angry\", says Fred Ebb. \"'I knew that song as a child', one man had the audacity to tell me. A rabbinical person wrote to me saying he had absolute proof it was a Nazi song.\" It wasn't: it was written in the mid-Sixties for a Broadway musical. But today, it's the only Nazi song we all know: On election night 1987, when Spitting Image decided to draw some crass parallels between Mrs Thatcher and another strong leader, they opted to show the Tories singing not the Horst Wessel song, but \"Tomorrow Belongs To Me\" \u2013 secure in the knowledge that we'd all get the joke.\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"TCM Festival\">{{cite web\n | title =

In 1995, ''Cabaret'' was the ninth [[Live action|live-action]] musical film selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"National Film Registry\"/>\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1931 Berlin, young American [[Sally Bowles]] performs at the Kit Kat Klub. A new British arrival in the city, Brian Roberts, moves into the boarding house where Sally lives. A reserved academic and writer, Brian wants to give English lessons to earn a living while completing his doctorate. Sally tries to seduce Brian, but he tells her that on three previous occasions he has tried to have sexual relationships with women, all of which failed. They become friends, and Brian witnesses Sally's bohemian life in the last days of the [[Weimar Republic]]. Much later in the movie, Sally and Brian become lovers, concluding that his previous failures with women were because they were \"the wrong three girls\".\n\nMaximilian von Heune, a rich playboy baron, befriends Sally and takes her and Brian to his country estate where they are both spoiled and courted. After an unexplained off-screen experience with Brian, Max drops his pursuit of the pair in anger. During an argument, Sally tells Brian that she has been having sex with Max, and Brian reveals that he has as well. Brian and Sally later reconcile, and Sally reveals that Max left them 300 marks and mockingly compares the sum with what a professional prostitute gets.\n\nSally learns that she is pregnant but is unsure of the father. Brian offers to marry her and take her back to his university life in Cambridge. At first, they celebrate their resolution to start this new life together, but after a picnic between Sally and Brian, in which Brian acts distant and uninterested, Sally becomes disheartened by the vision of herself as a bored faculty wife washing dirty diapers. Ultimately, she has an abortion, without informing Brian in advance. When he confronts her, she shares her fears, and the two reach an understanding. Brian departs for England, and Sally continues her life in Berlin, embedding herself in the Kit Kat Club.\n \nA subplot concerns Fritz Wendel, a German Jew passing as a Protestant, who is in love with Natalia Landauer, a wealthy German Jewish heiress who holds him in contempt and suspects his motives. Sally advises him to be more aggressive, which eventually enables Fritz to win her love. However, to gain her parents' consent for their marriage, Fritz must reveal his religion, which he does and the two are married by a rabbi.\n\nThe rise of fascism is an ever-present undercurrent throughout the film. Their progress can be tracked through the characters' changing actions and attitudes. While in the beginning of the film, a Nazi is kicked out of the Kit Kat Klub, the final shot of the film shows the cabaret's audience is dominated by uniformed Nazis. The rise of the Nazis is also demonstrated in a rural [[beer garden]] scene. A blonde boy\u2014only his face is seen initially\u2014sings to an audience of all ages (\"Tomorrow Belongs To Me\") about the beauties of nature and youth. The camera shifts to show that the singer is wearing the black shorts and tan shirt of the [[Hitler Youth]] uniform.

Over the next months, Fosse met with previously hired screenwriter [[Jay Allen|Jay Presson Allen]] to discuss the screenplay.{{r|Garebian 2011|pp=136-139}}\n\n=== Screenplay revisions ===\nAs production neared, Fosse became increasingly dissatisfied with Allen's script which was based on [[Joe Masteroff]]'s original book of the stage version.

Fosse was given the option of using Grey as Master of Ceremonies or walking away from the production.{{r|Garebian 2011|p=147-148}} Fosse hired [[Michael York]] as Sally Bowles's bisexual love interest, a casting choice which Minnelli initially believed was incorrect until she performed with him.{{r|Garebian 2011|p=146}} Several smaller roles, as well as the remaining four dancers in the film, eventually were cast in Germany.\n\nMinnelli had auditioned to play Sally in the original Broadway production but was deemed too inexperienced at the time, even though she had already won Broadway's [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical]]. By the time ''Cabaret'' reached the screen, however, Minnelli was a film star having won an Oscar nomination as the emotionally damaged college student in ''[[The Sterile Cuckoo]]'' (1969).\n\nFor her performance as Sally in the film, Minnelli reinterpreted the character and\u2014at the explicit suggestion of her father [[Theatre director|stage director]] [[Vincente Minnelli]]<ref name=\"Minnelli 2006\"/>\u2014she deliberately imitated film actress [[Louise Brooks]], a [[flapper|flapper icon]] and [[sex symbol]] of the [[Jazz Age]].<ref name=\"Minnelli 2006\"/>{{r|Garebian 2011|p=142}} Brooks, much like the character of Sally Bowles in the film, was an aspiring actress and American [[Expatriate|expat]] who temporarily moved to Weimar Berlin in search of international stardom.{{r|Garebian 2011|p=139}} Minnelli later recalled: \n\n{{Quote|\"I went to my father and asked him, 'What can you tell me about 1930s glamour? Should I be emulating [[Marlene Dietrich]] or something?' And he said 'No, study everything you can about [[Louise Brooks]].'\"<ref name=\"Minnelli 2006\"/>}}\n\nIn particular, Minnelli drew upon Brooks' \"[[Pandora's Box (1929 film)|Lulu makeup]] and [[Shingle bob|helmet-like coiffure]].\"{{r|Garebian 2011|p=142}} For the meeting between Sally Bowles and Brian Roberts, Minnelli modeled her movements and demeanor upon Brooks; in particular, the scene in ''[[Pandora's Box (1929 film)|Pandora's Box]]'' (1929) where Brooks' carefree character of Lulu is first introduced.<ref name=\"Garebian 2011\"/> Ultimately, Minnelli would win the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her portrayal of Sally Bowles.<ref name=\"Buck 1973\"/>\n\n=== Filming ===\nFosse and Feuer traveled to West Germany, where producers chose to shoot the film, in order to finish assembling the film crew. During this time, Fosse highly recommended [[Robert Surtees (cinematographer)|Robert L. Surtees]] for cinematographer, but Feuer and the top executives saw Surtees's work on ''Sweet Charity'' as one of the film's many artistic problems. Producers eventually chose British cinematographer [[Geoffrey Unsworth]].{{r|Garebian 2011|pp=138, 149}} Designers [[Rolf Zehetbauer]], [[Hans J\u00fcrgen Kiebach]] and [[Herbert Strabel]] served as production designers. Charlotte Flemming designed costumes.{{r|Garebian 2011|p=205}} Fosse dancer [[Kathryn Doby]], Louise Quick and John Sharpe were brought on as Fosse's dance aides.\n\nRehearsals and filming took place entirely in West Germany. For reasons of economy, indoor scenes were shot at the [[Bavaria Studios|Bavaria Film Studios]] in [[Gr\u00fcnwald, Bavaria|Gr\u00fcnwald]],{{r|Garebian 2011|p=143}} outside Munich.<ref name=\"TCM Notes\"/>{{r|Garebian 2011|p=146}} Location shooting took place in and around Munich and [[West Berlin]], and in [[Schleswig-Holstein]] and [[Saxony]] {{Citation needed|reason=needs confirmation, filming in East Germany unlikely|date=June 2019}}. Editing was done in Los Angeles before the eventual theatrical release in February 1972.\n\n=== Narrative and news reading ===\nAlthough the songs throughout the film allude to and advance the narrative, every song except \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\" is executed in the context of a Kit Kat Klub performance.<ref name=\"Russell 2002\"/><ref name=\"Benedict 2002\"/> The voice heard on the radio reading the news throughout the film in German was that of associate producer Harold Nebenzal, whose father [[Seymour Nebenzahl]] produced such notable [[Weimar]] films as ''[[M (1931 film)|M]]'' (1931), ''[[Testament of Dr. Mabuse]]'' (1933), and ''[[Threepenny Opera (film)|Threepenny Opera]]'' (1931).\n\n== Differences between film and stage version ==\nThe film is significantly different from the Broadway musical. In the stage version, [[Sally Bowles]] is English (as she was in Christopher Isherwood's \"[[Goodbye to Berlin]]\"). In the film version, she is American.<ref name=\"Greenspun 1972\"/> The character of Cliff Bradshaw was renamed Brian Roberts and made British (as was Isherwood, upon whom the character was based) rather than American as in the stage version.<ref name=\"Greenspun 1972\"/>{{r|Garebian 2011|p=139}} The characters and plot lines involving Fritz, Natalia and Max were pulled from ''[[I Am a Camera]]'' and did not appear in the stage version of ''Cabaret'' (or in \"Goodbye to Berlin\").<ref name=\"Day 1974\"/>\n\nThe most significant change from the original stage version of ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'' involves the cutting of the two main characters: Fraulein Schneider, who runs a boarding house, and her love interest, Herr Schultz, a German grocer.{{r|Garebian 2011|p=34}} The plot line of their doomed romance, and the consequences of a German falling in love with a Jew during the rise of antisemitism was cut. Also cut were the joyous \"So What?\" and the heart-wrenching \"What Would You Do\", sung by Schneider, the song \"Meeskite\", sung by Schultz,{{r|Garebian 2011|p=83}} and their two duets \"It Couldn't Please Me More (The Pineapple Song)\" (cut) and \"Married\" (reset as a piano instrumental, and a phonograph record), as well as a short reprise of \"Married\", sung alone by Schultz.<ref name=\"Internet Broadway Database\"/>{{r|Garebian 2011|pp=34, 83}}\n\nKander and Ebb wrote several new songs for the film and removed others.<ref name=\"Greenspun 1972\"/><ref name=\"TCM Notes\"/> \"Don't Tell Mama\" was replaced by \"Mein Herr\",{{r|Garebian 2011|p=143}} and \"The Money Song\" (retained in an instrumental version as \"Sitting Pretty\") was replaced by \"Money, Money.\"{{r|Garebian 2011|pp=141-43}} \"Mein Herr\" and \"Money, Money\", which were composed for the film version, were added to performances of the stage musical alongside the original numbers.{{r|Garebian 2011|pp=141-43}} The song \"[[Maybe This Time (song)|Maybe This Time]]\", which Sally performs at the cabaret, was not written for the film.{{r|Garebian 2011|pp=141-43}} Although \"Don't Tell Mama\" and \"Married\" were removed as performed musical numbers, both were used in the film. The former's bridge section appears as instrumental music played on Sally's gramophone; the latter is initially played on the piano in Fraulein Schneider's parlor and later heard on Sally's gramophone in a German translation (\"Heiraten\") sung by cabaret singer [[Greta Keller]].{{r|Garebian 2011|p=155}} Additionally, the song \"[[If You Could See Her]],\" performed by the Emcee, originally concluded with the line \"She wouldn't be meeskite at all\" in the Broadway production. In the film, the song concludes with the line \"She wouldn't look Jewish at all,\" a return to the original lyrics by [[Fred Ebb]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Belletto|first=Steven|date=2008|title=\"CABARET\" AND ANTIFASCIST AESTHETICS|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/23130878|journal=Criticism|volume=50|issue=4|pages=609\u2013630|issn=0011-1589}}</ref>\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = Cabaret: Original Soundtrack Recording<ref name=\"Cabaret Soundtrack\"/><ref name=\"Original Recording\"/>\n| total_length    = 38:14\n| all_writing     = [[Kander and Ebb|John Kander and Fred Ebb]]\n| extra_column    = Performer\n\n| title1          = [[Willkommen]]\n| extra1          = [[Joel Grey]]\n| length1         = 4:29\n\n| title2          = Mein Herr\n| extra2          = [[Liza Minnelli]]\n| length2         = 3:36\n\n| title3          = [[Maybe This Time (song)|Maybe This Time]]\n| extra3          = Liza Minnelli\n| length3         = 3:11\n\n| title4          = Money, Money\n| extra4          = Joel Grey, Liza Minnelli\n| length4         = 3:04\n\n| title5          = Two Ladies\n| extra5          = Joel Grey\n| length5         = 3:11\n\n| title6          = Sitting Pretty\n| extra6          = Instrumental\n| length6         = 2:27\n\n| title7          = Tomorrow Belongs to Me\n| extra7          = [[Mark Lambert (American actor)|Mark Lambert]]<ref name=\"TCM Notes\"/>\n| length7         = 3:06\n\n| title8          = Tiller Girls\n| extra8          = Joel Grey\n| length8         = 1:41\n\n| title9          = Heiraten (Married)\n| extra9          = [[Greta Keller]]\n| length9         = 3:45\n\n| title10         = If You Could See Her\n| extra10         = Joel Grey\n| length10        = 3:54\n\n| title11         = [[Cabaret (Cabaret song)|Cabaret]]\n| extra11         = Liza Minnelli\n| length11        = 3:34\n\n| title12         = Finale\n| extra12         = Joel Grey\n| length12        = 2:28\n}}\n\n=== Certifications ===\n{{Certification Table Top}}\n{{Certification Table Entry|type=album|region=United States|artist=Liza Minnelli|title=Cabaret (soundtrack)|award=Gold|relyear=1972|certyear=1973|salesamount=500,000|refname=riaa}}\n{{Certification Table Bottom}}\n\n== Release and reaction ==\n[[Image:1972 - Capri Theater Ad - 12 May MC - Allentown PA.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Newspaper ad for the film]]\nThe film was immediately successful at the box office.

Part of its success comes because it doesn't fall for the old clich\u00e9 that musicals have to make you happy. Instead of cheapening the movie version by lightening its load of despair, director Bob Fosse has gone right to the bleak heart of the material and stayed there well enough to win an [[Academy Award for Best Director]].\"<ref name=\"Ebert 1972\"/> \n\nA ''Variety'' staff critic appraised the film in December 1971: \"The film version of the 1966 John Kander-Fred Ebb Broadway musical ''Cabaret'' is most unusual: it is literate, bawdy, sophisticated, sensual, cynical, heart-warming, and disturbingly thought-provoking. Liza Minnelli heads a strong cast. Bob Fosse's generally excellent direction recreates the milieu of Germany some 40 years ago.\"<ref name=\"Variety 1971\"/>\n\n[[Roger Greenspun]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote in February 1972 that \"''Cabaret'' is one of those immensely gratifying imperfect works in which from beginning to end you can literally feel a movie coming to life.\"<ref name=\"Greenspun 1972\"/> Likewise, [[Pauline Kael]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote a review that same month in which she applauded the film: {{Quote|\"A great movie musical. Taking its form from political cabaret, it's a satire of temptations. In a prodigious balancing act, Bob Fosse, the choreographer-director, keeps the period\u2014Berlin, 1931\u2014at a cool distance. We see the decadence as garish and sleazy; yet we also see the animal energy in it\u2014everything seems to become sexualized. The movie does not exploit decadence; rather, it gives it its due.

He is a bisexual Englishman; he has an affair with Sally and, later, with one of Sally's lovers, a German baron.... Brian's homosexual tendency is treated as an indecent but comic weakness to be snickered at, like [[bed-wetting]].\"{{r|Isherwood 1976|p=63}}}}\n\nSimilarly, Isherwood's friend [[Jean Ross]]\u2014upon whom the character of Sally Bowles was based{{r|Bletchly 2013|p=26}}\u2014was ambivalent about the film.{{r|Isherwood 2012|p=70}} She felt the depiction of 1930s Berlin \"was quite, quite different\" from reality.{{r|Johnstone 1975|pp=33\u201334}} Nevertheless, she conceded that the depiction of their social circle of British expatriates as pleasure-seeking libertines was accurate: \"We were all utterly against the ''[[bourgeois]]'' standards of our parents' generation. That's what took us to [Weimar-era] Berlin. The climate was freer there.\"{{r|Johnstone 1975|pp=33\u201334}} Such ambivalence towards ''Cabaret'' (1972) was not unique among Isherwood's circle.<ref name=\"Spender 1977\"/> The poet [[Stephen Spender]] lamented how ''Cabaret'' (1972) glossed over Weimar Berlin's crushing poverty:\n{{Quote|\"There is not a single meal, or club, in the movie ''Cabaret,'' that Christopher [Isherwood] and I could have afforded [in 1931].

''Cabaret'' is drenched in the sexiest kind of cynicism and decadent despair.\"<ref name=\"Bradshaw 2013\"/>\n\n==== Controversies ====\nAlthough less explicit compared with other films made in the 1970s, ''Cabaret'' dealt explicitly with topics like corruption, sexual ambiguity, false dreams, and Nazism. Tim Dirks at [[Filmsite.org]] notes: \"The sexually-charged, semi-controversial, kinky musical was the first one ever to be given an X rating (although later re-rated) with its numerous sexual flings and hedonistic club life. There was considerable sexual innuendo, profanity, casual sex talk (homosexual and heterosexual), some evidence of anti-Semitism, and even an abortion in the film.\"<ref name=\"Dirks 2013\"/> It was also rated [[History of British film certificates|X in the UK]] and later re-rated as 15.<ref name=\"Russell 2002\"/><ref name=\"BBFC\"/>\n\nOn the topic of Nazism, there was little consensus among critics about the possibly fascist implications of the film and play. However, critic Steven Belletto wrote a critique of ''Cabaret'' in the Criticism journal, published by [[Wayne State University Press]], in which he highlighted the anti-fascist themes in the film present both within and outside of the musical acts. According to Belletto, \"despite the ways that the film has been understood by a variety of critics, [''Cabaret''] rejects the logic of fascist certainty by staging various numbers committed to irony and ambiguity.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Belletto|first=Steven|date=2008|title=\"CABARET\" AND ANTIFASCIST AESTHETICS|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/23130878|journal=Criticism|volume=50|issue=4|pages=609\u2013630|issn=0011-1589}}</ref>\n\nThe \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\" scene was controversial, with Kander and Ebb, both of whom were Jews, sometimes being wrongly accused of using a [[Nazi songs|historical Nazi song]].<ref name=\"Steyn 1997\"/> According to a November 1976 ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' article, the film was censored in [[West Berlin]] when it was first released there theatrically, with the sequence featuring the Hitler Youth singing \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\" having been deleted.<ref name=\"TCM Notes\"/> This elimination was made \"because of the feeling that it might stir up resentments in the audience by showing the sympathizers for the Nazi movement during the '30s.\"<ref name=\"TCM Notes\"/> The sequence was restored, however, when the film was shown on West German television on November 7, 1976.<ref name=\"TCM Notes\"/>\n\nAnother topic of discussion was the song \"If You Could See Her\",{{r|Belletto 2008|p=610}} which closed with the line: \"If you could see her through my eyes, she wouldn't look Jewish at all.\" The point of the song was showing anti-Semitism as it begins to run rampant in Berlin, but there were a number of Jewish groups who interpreted the lyrics differently.<ref name=\"McLaughlin 2013\"/>{{r|Belletto 2008|p=625}}\n\n=== Accolades ===\n''Cabaret'' earned a total of 10 [[Academy Award]] nominations (winning 8 of them) and holds the [[List of Academy Award records#Film records|record for most Academy Awards won by a film which did not win the Academy Award for Best Picture]].<ref name=\"TCM Notes\"/><ref name=\"Academy Awards\"/>\n\nShortly before the [[45th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], [[Bob Fosse]] won 2 [[Tony Award|Tony Awards]] for directing and choreographing ''[[Pippin (musical)|Pippin]]'', his biggest stage hit to date. Months later, he won the [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for choreographing and directing [[Liza Minnelli]]'s television special ''[[Liza with a Z]]'', he became the first director to win all three awards in one year.\n\n[[Image:Liza Minnelli 1973 Special.JPG|thumb|Minnelli reprised the character of Sally Bowles for an encore performance in the 1973 television special, ''[[Liza with a Z]]'', also directed by [[Bob Fosse]].]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

has been cited by ''[[TV Guide]]'' as among the greatest films ever made,<ref name=\"TV Guide\"/> and in [[Movieline]] magazine as one of the \"100 Best Movies Ever\".<ref name=\"Movieline Magazine\"/> It was included in [[Film4|FilmFour]]'s \"100 Greatest Films of All Time\" at #78<ref name=\"Filmsite.org\"/> and in ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]''{{'}}s \"Hot 100 Films of the Past\", being hailed as \"the last great musical. Liza Minnelli plays Sally Bowles, an American adrift in pre-Nazi Berlin, in Bob Fosse's stylish, near-perfect film.\"<ref name=\"San Francisco Chronicle Film Critics\"/>\n\nDavid Benedict has written in ''[[The Guardian]]'' about ''Cabaret'''s influence in musical films: \"Back then, musicals were already low on film-goers' lists, so how come it was such a success? Simple: ''Cabaret'' is the musical for people who hate them. Given the vibrancy of its now iconic numbers \u2013 Liza Minnelli in [[bowler hat|bowler]] and black suspenders astride a bentwood chair belting out 'Mein Herr' or shimmying and shivering with pleasure over 'Money' with Joel Grey \u2013 it sounds strange to say it, but one of the chief reasons why ''Cabaret'' is so popular is that it's not shot like a musical.\"<ref name=\"Benedict 2002\"/>\n\nThe film has been listed as one of the most important for [[queer cinema]] for its depictions of bisexuality,<ref name=\"Greenspun 1972\"/> arguably transgressive at the time of its 1972 [[Motion Picture Production Code|post-Code]] release and has been credited with turning Liza Minnelli into a [[gay icon]]. Film blogs have selected it as \"the gayest winner in the history of the Academy.\"<ref name=\"Baines 2012\"/><ref name=\"St. James 2017\"/><ref name=\"Out.com\"/>\n\n=== Home media ===\nThe film was first released to DVD in 1998. There have been subsequent releases in 2003, 2008, and 2012. The film's international ancillary distribution rights are owned by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (now part of [[The Walt Disney Company]]), while [[Warner Bros.]] (which acquired the film as part of its purchase of [[Lorimar Productions]], which had previously acquired the film library of [[Monogram Pictures|Allied Artists]]) has domestic distribution rights.\n\nIn April 2012, Warner unveiled a new restoration of the film at the [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM Classic Film Festival]].<ref name=\"McNary 2012\"/><ref name=\"TCM Festival\"/><ref name=\"Elber 2012\"/> A Blu-ray edition was later released in February 2013.<ref name=\"Reuben 2013\"/> Before this restoration, ''Cabaret'' had been sold on a [[standard-definition]] DVD from Warner Bros., but the film was unavailable in [[High-definition video|high-definition]] or for [[Digital cinema|digital projections]] in cinemas.<ref name=\"Elber 2012\"/> The original camera negative is lost, and a surviving [[interpositive]] had a vertical scratch that ran through 1,000 feet, or 10 minutes, of one of its reels, as confirmed by Ned Price, vice president of mastering and restoration for Warner Bros..<ref name=\"Elber 2012\"/> The damage ostensibly was inflicted by a grain of dirt that had rolled through the length of the reel, beginning with a scene in which Michael York's character confronts a pro-Nazi boarding house resident, and had cut into the emulsion.<ref name=\"Elber 2012\"/> The marred frames were digitally restored, but \"the difficult part was matching the grain structure so the fix was invisible.\" After automated digital repair attempts failed, the 1,000 feet<!-- article said 1.4&nbsp;million frames, but that does not calculate. 10 minutes x 60 seconds/minute = 600 seconds x 24

A rabbinical person wrote to me saying he had absolute proof it was a Nazi song.\" It wasn't: it was written in the mid-Sixties for a Broadway musical. But today, it's the only Nazi song we all know: On election night 1987, when Spitting Image decided to draw some crass parallels between Mrs Thatcher and another strong leader, they opted to show the Tories singing not the Horst Wessel song, but \"Tomorrow Belongs To Me\" \u2013 secure in the knowledge that we'd all get the joke.\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"TCM Festival\">{{cite web\n | title = Cabaret (1972)\n | url = http://www.tcm.com/festival/programs/458081/index.html \n | publisher = [[TCM Classic Film Festival]]\n | year = 2012\n | url-status = bot: unknown \n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120424182448/http://www.tcm.com/festival/programs/458081/index.html \n | archive-date = April 24, 2012\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"TCM Notes\">{{cite web\n | title = Cabaret (1972) \u2013 Notes \u2013 TCM.com \n | url = http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/21780/Cabaret/notes.html\n | website = [[Turner Classic Movies]]\n | access-date = February 8, 2016\n | url-status = dead\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171021035856/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/21780/Cabaret/notes.html\n | archive-date = October 21, 2017\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Thomson 2005\">{{cite magazine\n | last = Thomson\n | first = David\n | author-link = David Thomson (film critic)\n | title = The Observer as Hero\n | date = March 21, 2005\n | access-date = October 2, 2019\n | url = https://newrepublic.com/article/68111/the-observer-hero\n | magazine = [[The New Republic]]\n | location = [[New York City]]\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"TV Guide\">{{cite web\n | last = Dirks\n | first = Tim\n | title = 50 Greatest Movies from TV Guide\n | url = http://www.filmsite.org/tvguide.html\n | website = [[Filmsite.org]]\n | access-date = February 6, 2016\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Variety 1969\">{{cite magazine\n | title = 'Cabaret' Film Rights At AA's Peak $1.5-Mil\n | date = May 28, 1969\n | page = 1\n | magazine = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Variety 1971\">{{cite magazine\n | title = Cabaret\n | url = https://variety.com/1971/film/reviews/cabaret-2-1200422826/\n | magazine = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]\n | date = December 31, 1971\n | access-date = December 7, 2015\n}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n[http://www.mismirigo.ch Francesco Mismirigo], Cabaret, un film allemand, Universit\u00e9 de Gen\u00e8ve, 1984\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikiquote|Cabaret (film)}}\n{{commons category|Cabaret (film)}}\n* {{IMDb title|0068327|Cabaret}}\n* {{tcmdb title|21780|Cabaret}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|cabaret|Cabaret}}\n* {{metacritic film|cabaret|Cabaret}}\n* {{AFI film|54427|Cabaret}}\n\n{{Cabaret}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title = Awards for ''Cabaret''\n|list =\n{{BAFTA Best Film 1961-1980}}\n{{GoldenGlobeBestMotionPictureMusicalComedy 1961-1980}}\n{{National Board of Review Award for Best Film}}\n}}\n{{Isherwood}}\n{{Bob Fosse}}\n{{Liza Minnelli}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cabaret}}\n[[Category:1970s musical drama films]]\n[[Category:1972 films]]\n[[Category:Allied Artists films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:American musical drama films]]\n[[Category:Best Musical or Comedy Picture Golden Globe winners]]\n[[Category:Films that won the Best Original Score Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Bisexuality-related films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about writers]]\n[[Category:Films based on musicals]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Bob Fosse]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Actress Academy Award-winning performance]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Musical or Comedy Actress Golden Globe winning performance]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award-winning performance]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Supporting Actor Golden Globe winning performance]]\n[[Category:Films set in Berlin]]\n[[Category:Films set in cabarets]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1931]]\n[[Category:Films that won the Best Sound Mixing Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Films whose art director won the Best Art Direction Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Films whose cinematographer won the Best Cinematography Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Films whose director won the Best Directing Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Films whose editor won the Best Film Editing Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Gay-related films]]\n[[Category:German-language films]]\n[[Category:Liza Minnelli soundtracks]]\n[[Category:United States National Film Registry films]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related musical films]]\n[[Category:Best Film BAFTA Award winners]]\n[[Category:Films whose director won the Best Direction BAFTA Award]]\n[[Category:1970s LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Films based on adaptations]]\n[[Category:Films shot at Bavaria Studios]]\n[[Category:Censored films]]\n[[Category:Male bisexuality in film]]\n", "name_user": "49.146.46.219", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabaret_(1972_film)"}

The first reform in particular, which at the time was summed up in the slogan that being good at one thing was enough to get into college, was criticised for allegedly lowering dramatically the scholastic competence of the so-called \"Lee Hae-chan generation\" of then-high school students.\n\nHis nomination as prime minister met some resistance due to his record as minister of education, which many consider a failure. Since taking office, however, Lee has proved an able prime minister, being described by some as the most powerful prime minister South Korea has seen.\n\nOn March 1, 2006, the Korean Railroad Workers Union and Seoul Subway Union entered a strike together. The strike of railroad and subway at the same time proved to be a fatal blow at the nation's economic activity, especially [[Seoul]] area, where traffic heavily depend on subway, which is controlled by these two unions. Prime Minister Lee was supposed to command the situation and mediate the strike; however, he was playing golf at [[Busan]] area with local businessmen, and this caused massive distaste among Korean people against Lee for not taking care of the government and people.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Politics of South Korea]]\n*[[Roh Moo-hyun]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-par|kr}}\n{{s-bef|before=Yim Churl-soon<br>Kim Soo-han|as=Members of the Assembly<br>for Gwanak-gu}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Member of the Assembly for [[Gwanak-gu|Gwanak-eul]]|years=1988\u20132008}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Kim Hui-chul]]}}\n|-\n{{s-new|constituency}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Member of the Assembly for [[Sejong City|Sejong]]|years=2012\u2013present}}\n{{s-inc}}\n|-\n{{s-off}}\n{{Succession box\n|before=[[Goh Kun]]\n|after=[[Han Myung-Sook]]\n|title=[[Prime Minister of South Korea]]\n|years=2004\u20132006\n}}\n{{S-end}}\n{{Prime Ministers of South Korea}}\n\n{{2007 South Korean presidential candidates}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lee, Hae Chan}}\n[[Category:1952 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Minjoo Party of Korea politicians]]\n[[Category:Uri Party politicians]]\n[[Category:United New Democratic Party politicians]]\n[[Category:Members of the National Assembly (South Korea)]]\n[[Category:Yi clan of Jeonju]]\n[[Category:Seoul National University alumni]]\n[[Category:People from South Chungcheong Province]]\n\n\n{{SouthKorea-politician-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Korean name|[[Lee (Korean name)|Lee]]}}\n{{expand language|topic=|langcode=KO|otherarticle=\uc774\ud574\ucc2c|date=March 2017}}{{BLP sources|date=January 2010}}\n{{Infobox officeholder\n|image       = Lee hae-chan.jpg\n| honorific-prefix = [[Excellency|His Excellency]]\n|name        = Lee Hae-chan\n|native_name = {{nobold|\uc774\ud574\ucc2c}}\n|native_name_lang = ko\n|office1      = Leader of the [[Democratic Party of Korea|Democratic Party]]\n|term_start1  = 25 August 2018\n|term_end1    = \n|predecessor1 = [[Choo Mi-ae]]\n|successor1   = \n|office2      = 32nd [[Prime Minister of South Korea]]\n|term_start2  = 30 July 2004\n|term_end2    = 15 March 2006\n|president2   = [[Roh Moo-hyun]]\n|deputy2       =\n|predecessor2 = [[Goh Kun]]\n|successor2   = [[Han Myeong-sook]]\n|office3      = Member of the [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly]]\n|term_start3  = 30 May 2012\n|term_end3    = \n|constituency3= [[Sejong City|Sejong]]\n|successor3   = ''New constituency''\n|term_start4  = 30 May 1996\n|term_end4    = 29 May 2008\n|predecessor4 = Lee Hae-chan\n|successor4   = [[Kim Hui-chul]]\n|constituency4= [[Gwanak District|Gwanak]] B ([[Seoul]])\n|term_start5  = 30 May 1988\n|term_end5    = 30 June 1995\n|predecessor5 = Yim Churl-soon,  Kim Soo-han\n|successor5   = Lee Hae-chan\n|constituency5= [[Gwanak District|Gwanak]] B ([[Seoul]])\n|office6      = [[Ministry of Education (South Korea)|Minister of Education]]\n|term_start6  = 3 March 1998\n|term_end6    = 24 May 1999\n|president6   = [[Kim Dae-jung]]\n|predecessor6 = Lee Myung-hyun\n|successor6   = Kim Duk-choong\n|birth_date  = {{Birth date and age|1952|7|10|mf=y}}\n|birth_place = [[:ko:\uc7a5\ud3c9\uba74 (\uccad\uc591\uad70)|Jangpyeong]], [[South Chungcheong Province|South Chungcheong]], [[South Korea]]\n|death_date  =\n|death_place =\n|religion    =\n|spouse      =\n|children    =\n|party       = [[Democratic Party of Korea|Democratic]]\n|alma_mater  = [[Seoul National University]]\n|website     = [http://www.hopechan.kr/ www.hopechan.kr]\n}}\n{{Infobox Korean name\n|title=[[Korean name]]\n|hangul={{linktext|\uc774|\ud574|\ucc2c}}\n|hanja={{linktext|\u674e|\u6d77|\u74da}}\n|rr=I Haechan\n|mr=I Haech'an\n|tablewidth=265\n|color=lavender\n}}\n'''Lee Hae-chan''' (born July 10, 1952) is a South Korean politician currently serving his seventh term in the National Assembly.

The first reform in particular, which at the time was summed up in the slogan that being good at one thing was enough to get into college, was criticised for allegedly lowering dramatically the scholastic competence of the so-called \"Lee Hae-chan generation\" of then-high school students.\n\nHis nomination as prime minister met some resistance due to his record as minister of education, which many consider a failure. Since taking office, however, Lee has proved an able prime minister, being described by some as the most powerful prime minister South Korea has seen.\n\nOn March 1, 2006, the Korean Railroad Workers Union and Seoul Subway Union entered a strike together. The strike of railroad and subway at the same time proved to be a fatal blow at the nation's economic activity, especially [[Seoul]] area, where traffic heavily depend on subway, which is controlled by these two unions. Prime Minister Lee was supposed to command the situation and mediate the strike; however, he was playing golf at [[Busan]] area with local businessmen, and this caused massive distaste among Korean people against Lee for not taking care of the government and people.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Politics of South Korea]]\n*[[Roh Moo-hyun]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-par|kr}}\n{{s-bef|before=Yim Churl-soon<br>Kim Soo-han|as=Members of the Assembly<br>for Gwanak-gu}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Member of the Assembly for [[Gwanak-gu|Gwanak-eul]]|years=1988\u20132008}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Kim Hui-chul]]}}\n|-\n{{s-new|constituency}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Member of the Assembly for [[Sejong City|Sejong]]|years=2012\u2013present}}\n{{s-inc}}\n|-\n{{s-off}}\n{{Succession box\n|before=[[Goh Kun]]\n|after=[[Han Myung-Sook]]\n|title=[[Prime Minister of South Korea]]\n|years=2004\u20132006\n}}\n{{S-end}}\n{{Prime Ministers of South Korea}}\n\n{{2007 South Korean presidential candidates}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lee, Hae Chan}}\n[[Category:1952 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Minjoo Party of Korea politicians]]\n[[Category:Uri Party politicians]]\n[[Category:United New Democratic Party politicians]]\n[[Category:Members of the National Assembly (South Korea)]]\n[[Category:Yi clan of Jeonju]]\n\n\n{{SouthKorea-politician-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Inter&anthro", "label": "safe", "comment": "says it in the article", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Hae-chan"}
