However, a separate [[Women's Cricket World Cup]] had been held two years before the first men's tournament, and a tournament involving multiple international teams had been held as early as 1912, when a [[1912 Triangular Tournament|triangular tournament]] of [[Test cricket|Test matches]] was played between [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]], [[England national cricket team|England]] and [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]]. The first three World Cups were held in England. From the [[1987 Cricket World Cup|1987 tournament]] onwards, hosting has been shared between countries under an [[Cricket World Cup hosts#Unofficial rotation system|unofficial rotation system]], with fourteen ICC members having hosted at least one match in the tournament.\n\nThe World Cup is open to all members of the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC), although the highest-ranking teams receive automatic qualification. The remaining teams are determined via the [[World Cricket League]] and the [[ICC World Cup Qualifier]]. A total of [[#Overview|twenty teams]] have competed in the eleven editions of the tournament, with fourteen teams competing in 2015; the [[2019 Cricket World Cup|recent 2019 tournament]] only had ten teams. Australia has won the tournament five times, [[India national cricket team|India]] and [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] twice each, while [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] and [[England national cricket team|England]] have won it once each. The best performance by a non-full-member team came when [[Kenya national cricket team|Kenya]] made the semi-finals of the [[2003 Cricket World Cup|2003 tournament]].\n\n[[England national cricket team|England]] are the current champions after winning the 2019 edition.

The remaining teams are determined via the [[World Cricket League]] and the [[ICC World Cup Qualifier]]. A total of [[#Overview|twenty teams]] have competed in the eleven editions of the tournament, with fourteen teams competing in 2015; the [[2019 Cricket World Cup|recent 2019 tournament]] only had ten teams. Australia has won the tournament five times, [[India national cricket team|India]] and [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] twice each, while [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] and [[England national cricket team|England]] have won it once each. The best performance by a non-full-member team came when [[Kenya national cricket team|Kenya]] made the semi-finals of the [[2003 Cricket World Cup|2003 tournament]].\n\n[[England national cricket team|England]] are the current champions after winning the 2019 edition.

O'Connor, a devout [[Roman Catholic]], often used religious themes in her work and examined the depth of human nature. As O\u2019Connor once revealed in an interview, \"All fiction is about human nature. What kind of human nature you write about depends on the amount and kind of your talent, not on what you may consider correct behavior to be. The best forms of behavior are not more desirable than the worst for fiction, if the writer sees the situation he is creating under the aspect of Truth and follows the necessities of his art.\"<ref name=\"Magee 1\">{{cite book|last=Magee|first=Rosemary M|title=Conversations with Flannery O'Connor|url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00ocon|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson}}</ref>\n\nHolding this belief, O\u2019Connor would many times use seemingly shocking methods to get her messages across, as her characters all experience brokenness and pain in various ways. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" provides one of those such characters, who moves from a hedonistic, painless lifestyle to a life of true sacrifice and pain for God.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\"Parker\u2019s Back\" takes place in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the early 1960's following the life of protagonist, O. E. Parker, a religiously estranged man.<ref>This sentence is phrased awkwardly.\n\n1. \"Parker's Back\" doesn't take place in Georgia. The setting of \"Parker's Back\" is in Georgia. (This adds clarity to the sentence).\n\n<br /></ref>Later, he developes a tenuous interest in religion, motivated by the lack of shared priorities with his wife. The story starts with Parker and his Biblically-named wife, [[Sarah]] [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], on the front porch of their country house. Sarah Ruth is \"snapping beans\" on the front porch and Parker, lost in thought, occasionally makes sharp comments to her. The reader is given insight into the attitude and thoughts of Parker. Parker does not think highly of Sarah Ruth and questions why he continues to stay with her. Parker dislikes Sarah Ruth\u2019s [[fundamentalist Christian]] attitudes, for she disapproves of his smoking, drinking, and tattoos.\n\nThe [[protagonist]] begins to contemplate his relationship with Sarah Ruth and how his life has developed. As a young boy, Parker is described as being less-than-ordinary and quite earnest. One day, he saw a man at a fair who was layered with tattoos. For the first time in his life, Parker felt the wonder and awe he desired; he recognized a greater sense of purpose. Parker then proceeded to get his first tattoo, and decided that they were worth it so he began working to pay for more. He fell into a bad crowd and began to drink, smoke, and sleep around. His mother was upset by his lifestyle and she tried to interfere religiously to make him change his ways. Finally reaching her limit, his mother dragged him to a revival, and upon arrival at the church, Parker runs away.\n\nParker then lies about his age and joins the Navy. As he comes into the ports during his Naval service, Parker begins to acquire more tattoos: He obtains an eagle, along with several other animals, royalty, and even some obscenities in places that are not visible. Parker departs from the Navy without official leave, but they chase him down, imprison him for nine months, and give him a dishonorable discharge. Afterwards, Parker settles down in the country and begins to pick up odd jobs, only keeping them for as long as he feels like working.\n\nOne day, as Parker is selling apples in the countryside, his truck breaks down. He senses that someone is watching him; he loudly curses and pretends to hurt himself. The next thing he knows, a young woman is hitting him with a broom. Parker meets this woman, who happens to be his future wife, Sarah Ruth. He returns over the next few days finding himself attracted to Sarah, yet he does not know why. Despite her constant back-and-forth attitude, Parker continues to pursue Sarah Ruth, going as far as to tell her his full name so that he could learn hers. Ultimately, in order to bed Sarah Ruth, Parker marries her. However, this improved nothing in their relationship. Sarah Ruth was constantly judging Parker for having too many tattoos, and Parker was constantly deciding that he would not return home to her, but he always found himself returning.\n\nWhen Parker finishes contemplating his relationship with Sarah Ruth, he thinks about getting a new tattoo. The only bare area for a tattoo was on his back. Even though Parker did not wish to get a tattoo any place he could not see it, he desires to obtain one in order to win Sarah Ruth over, and to cease her constant nagging. While at work, Parker rides a tractor in a field, however, he is so busy contemplating what tattoo to get that he pays no attention to where he is going and crashes into a tree his boss explicitly told him to not hit. The tractor is destroyed, In the resulting fire that destroys both machine and tree, Parker's tension comes to a head and he runs to his truck, driving the 50 miles it takes to get into the city. He runs into the tattoo salon and demands to see the book of tattoos pertaining to God, feeling that when he found the right one there would be a sign. As he flips through the book of tattoos, one particular image of Christ catches Parker's attention so much so that he turns back to it after flipping past it.\n\nGoing against the tattoo artist's suggestion for the image, Parker asks to have the tattoo of the [[Byzantine]] Christ put on his back, exactly as it is done in the book. While reluctant at first, the tattoo artist begins the procedure of putting this tattoo on Parker\u2019s back. That night, Parker sleeps in the city's homeless shelter and returns to the tattoo shop the next morning to have the image finished. The tattoo artist mocks Parker about the possibility of being \"saved\", and Parker explains that he is getting the tattoo in order to make his wife back off about how he is a sinner. After the tattoo is finished, Parker originally refuses to look at it; however, the tattoo artist ultimately forces him to look at it. Parker is unhappy with the way the tattoo looks. While the artist reminds him that it was Parker's choice and that he would have recommended something different, Parker goes to a pool hall he has frequently visited in the past. After the men figure out that Parker has a new tattoo, they lift up his shirt to look at it. After seeing it, they begin to mock Parker for his \"new-found faith\". Parker is thrown out of the bar for starting a fight, and after laying in the dirt for some time afterwards, drives back to his house out in the country.\n\nWhen he arrives home, Parker knocks on the door and begs for Sarah Ruth to let him in. At first, Sarah Ruth refuses, but she opens the door after Parker refers to himself by his full given name, [[Obadiah]] [[Elihu (Job)|Elihue]]. Once inside, Parker shows Sarah Ruth his tattoo, hoping for a positive reaction\u2014that she will be glad to hear that he has supposedly accepted Christ. However, Sarah Ruth flies into a fury, claiming that God doesn't \"look\" like anything because he has no corporeal form. She then begins screaming that Parker is committing idolatry, and that she will not tolerate that in her house. Sarah Ruth begins beating Parker's back with a broom, until he is bruised and left with welts on his back. She then proceeds to shake the broom out of the window to \"get the taint of him off it\". The story ends with Parker crying up against the tree in the front yard as Sarah Ruth watches dispassionately.\n\n== Byzantine Christ ==\nWhen Parker sought a tattoo for his back, he knew that he wanted to procure a tattoo of Christ. As he flipped through the book of tattoo designs, the tattoo of Christ with piercing eyes stopped him. As Parker continued to look at the picture, the eyes of Christ looked into him, and Parker felt compelled to choose that tattoo. The tattoo that Parker obtained was one of the Byzantine Christ, the [[Pantocrator]]. The Pantocrator was glorified by the Byzantine Empire through its literal definition as \"all-powerful or Almighty Christ\". This image is a popular [[icon]] among the Eastern Catholic and Orthodox Churches.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Homik|first=Heidi|last2=Parsons|first2=Mikeal|year=2015|title=Christ Pantocrator, Alpha and Omega, surrounded by angels, the elect, and Mary, Mother of God, Dome of Paradise, by Giusto de' Menabuoi (1320-1391)|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/archives/Vol132-Issue23|journal=Christian Century|volume=132|pages=47|via=}}</ref> The Christ Pantocrator is a wooden panel that dates back to the 6th century and from St. Catherine's monastery from Egypt.

When he looks at the image of Christ, he looks through the \u201cwindow\u201d of the iconic image and sees the depth of God\u2019s love, as he gives his life to Christ. Parker sees that his previous, hedonistic views in life are false, and that suffering\u2014at the hands of Sarah Ruth\u2014for Christ is the way to fulfillment.\n\n\"But Parker\u2019s back is now Christ\u2019s face and the welts, rising redly on one, also disfigure the other. The bond between the two is irrevocable and Parker\u2019s only comfort now is the supreme comfort\u2014that he has a tree, a cross, to lean on, that in his suffering he experiences only what Christ himself felt. The spirit of utter mutuality and unity, what his tattoos have always up to now lacked, descends on him and he realizes the terrible cost. The Word has become flesh on his own flesh.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Baumgaertner|first=Jill|title=Flannery O'Connor: A Proper Scaring|year=1999|publisher=Cornerstone Press|location=Chicago}}</ref>\n\nThe reason that Sarah Ruth does not accept his tattoo is because, her faith does not approve of idolatry. She believes that Christ is a \"spirit\", and that \"he has no face\". Sarah Ruth follows the God of the Hebrew people, who have established that God cannot be seen, which differs from other branches of faith.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Writing on the Flesh: Tattoos and Taboos in \"Parker's Back\"|journal = The Southern Literary Journal|volume = 14|issue = 2|pages = 8\u201318|last=Bleikasten|first=Andr\u00e9|date=1982|jstor = 20077673}}</ref>\n\n== Literary technique ==\nO'Connor uses a variety of literary techniques. In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring. She thinks every story must be built according to the pattern of the Roman arch and she would enlarge the beginning and the end, but I\u2019m letting it lay. I did well to write it at all.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Flannery|title=The Habit of Being|year=1979|publisher=The Noonday Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThis story is narrated in [[Third-person narrative|Third-person]] through the viewpoint of Parker. A strictly objective third person narration would not be conducive to having an intimate tie with Parker. By looking through the lens of Parker's experience, the reader is able to empathize with Parker; the reader can see the extent to which Parker is struggling. The viewpoint of this story helps to create a very strong protagonist in Parker.\n\nThe story also uses [[irony]] as an effective element. In \"Parker's Back,\" O'Connor presents one ironic situation after another. The situational irony is effective at catching the reader by surprise, so that the story is more riveting. O'Connor is known to use irony throughout her stories. For example, Parker's marriage to Sarah Ruth is ironic. Parker, with his hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, cursing, tattoos, and apathy toward religion was the antithesis of Sarah Ruth. And yet Sarah Ruth marries Parker, and their marriage\u2014though rocky\u2014does not end in divorce within the story.\n\nO'Connor continues this irony with Parker beginning a relationship with God through his experience of getting a tattoo. The reader may expect\u2014with the negativity surrounding Parker's tattoos\u2014that he would not find God through them. And yet, ironically, Parker's encountering the tattoo image of Christ proves to be a profound experience.  There is also irony also at the end of the story when Parker returns home to display his tattoo for Sarah Ruth. He expects her to approve of his new-found relationship with Christ, but she denounces his tattoo and throws him out of the house.\n\nThe story uses [[symbols]] to help tell Parker's life story. The tattoos he receives are reflections of his life. O'Connor suggests that they are major symbols of his most important things in life, however, they are all linked to something he did wrong in the past. Parker has tattoos all over his body, except for his back. The tattoo that fills his back shows that Parker had a troubled life before he was able to finally find peace.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Works by Flannery O'Connor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker's Back}}\n[[Category:Short stories by Flannery O'Connor]]\n[[Category:1964 short stories]]\n", "text_old": "{{essay-like|date=November 2017}}\n{{Infobox short story | <!-- See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels]] or [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Books]] -->\n| name          = Parker's Back\n| title_orig    =\n| translator    =\n| author        = [[Flannery O'Connor]]\n| country       = [[United States]]\n| language      = [[English language|English]]\n| series        =\n| genre         = [[Southern Gothic]]\n| published_in  = ''[[Everything That Rises Must Converge]]''\n| publication_type = single author anthology\n| publisher     =\n| media_type    =\n| pub_date      = 1965\n| english_pub_date =\n| preceded_by   =\n| followed_by   =\n}}\n\n\"'''Parker's Back'''\" is a short story by American author [[Flannery O'Connor]]. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" was published in 1965, in her final short story collection, ''Everything That Rises Must Converge''.

The bond between the two is irrevocable and Parker\u2019s only comfort now is the supreme comfort\u2014that he has a tree, a cross, to lean on, that in his suffering he experiences only what Christ himself felt. The spirit of utter mutuality and unity, what his tattoos have always up to now lacked, descends on him and he realizes the terrible cost. The Word has become flesh on his own flesh.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Baumgaertner|first=Jill|title=Flannery O'Connor: A Proper Scaring|year=1999|publisher=Cornerstone Press|location=Chicago}}</ref>\n\nThe reason that Sarah Ruth does not accept his tattoo is because, her faith does not approve of idolatry. She believes that Christ is a \"spirit\", and that \"he has no face\". Sarah Ruth follows the God of the Hebrew people, who have established that God cannot be seen, which differs from other branches of faith.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Writing on the Flesh: Tattoos and Taboos in \"Parker's Back\"|journal = The Southern Literary Journal|volume = 14|issue = 2|pages = 8\u201318|last=Bleikasten|first=Andr\u00e9|date=1982|jstor = 20077673}}</ref>\n\n== Literary technique ==\nO'Connor uses a variety of literary techniques. In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring. She thinks every story must be built according to the pattern of the Roman arch and she would enlarge the beginning and the end, but I\u2019m letting it lay. I did well to write it at all.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Flannery|title=The Habit of Being|year=1979|publisher=The Noonday Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThis story is narrated in [[Third-person narrative|Third-person]] through the viewpoint of Parker. A strictly objective third person narration would not be conducive to having an intimate tie with Parker. By looking through the lens of Parker's experience, the reader is able to empathize with Parker; the reader can see the extent to which Parker is struggling. The viewpoint of this story helps to create a very strong protagonist in Parker.\n\nThe story also uses [[irony]] as an effective element. In \"Parker's Back,\" O'Connor presents one ironic situation after another. The situational irony is effective at catching the reader by surprise, so that the story is more riveting. O'Connor is known to use irony throughout her stories. For example, Parker's marriage to Sarah Ruth is ironic. Parker, with his hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, cursing, tattoos, and apathy toward religion was the antithesis of Sarah Ruth. And yet Sarah Ruth marries Parker, and their marriage\u2014though rocky\u2014does not end in divorce within the story.\n\nO'Connor continues this irony with Parker beginning a relationship with God through his experience of getting a tattoo. The reader may expect\u2014with the negativity surrounding Parker's tattoos\u2014that he would not find God through them. And yet, ironically, Parker's encountering the tattoo image of Christ proves to be a profound experience.  There is also irony also at the end of the story when Parker returns home to display his tattoo for Sarah Ruth. He expects her to approve of his new-found relationship with Christ, but she denounces his tattoo and throws him out of the house.\n\nThe story uses [[symbols]] to help tell Parker's life story. The tattoos he receives are reflections of his life. O'Connor suggests that they are major symbols of his most important things in life, however, they are all linked to something he did wrong in the past. Parker has tattoos all over his body, except for his back. The tattoo that fills his back shows that Parker had a troubled life before he was able to finally find peace.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Works by Flannery O'Connor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker's Back}}\n[[Category:Short stories by Flannery O'Connor]]\n[[Category:1964 short stories]]\n", "name_user": "GinaleeJimenez", "label": "safe", "comment": "added a coma", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker%27s_Back"}

''''' is a 2019 American [[superhero film]] based on the [[DC Comics]] [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|character]]. Produced by [[New Line Cinema]] and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], it is the seventh installment in the [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU). Directed by [[David F. Sandberg]] from a screenplay by Henry Gayden, and a story by Gayden and [[Darren Lemke]], the film stars [[Asher Angel]] as Billy Batson, a teenage boy who can transform into an adult superhero, played by [[Zachary Levi]]. [[Mark Strong]], [[Jack Dylan Grazer]], [[Adam Brody]], and [[Djimon Hounsou]] also star. The plot follows Billy Batson, who is chosen by the ancient wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]] as his new champion and receives various superpowers. Billy and his best friend [[Captain Marvel, Jr.|Freddy Freeman]] (Grazer) must discover Billy's new powers in order to stop the evil [[Doctor Sivana|Dr. Thaddeus Sivana]] (Strong) and the [[Seven Deadly Enemies of Man]].\n\nDevelopment of a live-action ''Shazam!'' film began at New Line in the early 2000s but was delayed for many years. The film went into pre-production in 2009 with director [[Peter Segal]] and writer [[John August]] and [[Dwayne Johnson]] considered to star as the villain [[Black Adam]], but the project fell through; Dwayne Johnson acts as an executive producer on ''Shazam!''. [[William Goldman]], [[Alec Sokolow]], [[Joel Cohen (writer)|Joel Cohen]], Bill Birch, and [[Geoff Johns]], among others, were all attached to the project as writers at various points. The film was officially announced in 2014, with Johnson attached to star as either Shazam or Black Adam. He would later be cast in January 2017 to lead a solo ''Black Adam'' development project, currently targeted for a December 2021 release.<ref name=\"BlackAdamRelease\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/black-adam-release-date-set-2021-1254807 |title=Dwayne Johnson's 'Black Adam' Sets 2021 Release Date |website=The Hollywood Reporter |language=en |access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref> Sandberg signed on to direct ''Shazam!'' in February 2017 and Levi was cast that October, with Angel joining the following month. [[Principal photography]] began in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada on January 29, 2018, with most of the film shot at [[Pinewood Toronto Studios]], and [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on May 11, 2018.\n\n''Shazam!'' was released in the United States by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] in [[RealD 3D]], [[Dolby Cinema]], [[IMAX 3D]], [[4DX]] and [[ScreenX]] <!--no IMAX 2D prints--> on April 5, 2019. The film grossed $366 million worldwide, making it  a box office success. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for Sandberg's direction and the performances of Levi, Grazer, and Angel, as well as its light tone and sense of fun.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/shazam-reviews-what-critics-are-saying-1196688|title='Shazam!': What the Critics Are Saying|author=Katie Kilkenny|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=March 23, 2019|accessdate=March 23, 2019}}</ref> A sequel is set for release on November 4, 2022.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the word count in this section should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1974 [[Upstate New York]], young [[Doctor Sivana|Thaddeus Sivana]] is riding in a car with his father and brother when he is suddenly transported to the [[Rock of Eternity]], a magical temple in another dimension. There, the ancient wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]] has spent centuries searching for someone pure of heart on whom to bestow his power and name as champion, after the previous champion released the [[Seven Deadly Enemies of Man|Seven Deadly Sins]] which killed the rest of the Council of Wizards. Thaddeus is tempted by the Eye of Sin, through which he hears the voices of the Sins, trapped in stone statues, promising him power if he will free them. The wizard deems Thaddeus unworthy and magically returns him to the car, where he makes a scene causing a car crash, crippling his father. The Sins send Thaddeus a message telling him to find them.\n\nIn present-day [[Philadelphia]], 14-year-old foster child [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Billy Batson]] continually runs away from foster homes to search for his birth mother, from whom he became separated while at a carnival ten years prior. He is placed in a group home run by Victor and Rosa Vasquez, with five other foster children: [[Mary Marvel|Mary Bromfield]], Pedro Pe\u00f1a, Eugene Choi, Darla Dudley, and superhero enthusiast [[Captain Marvel Jr.|Freddy Freeman]]. Meanwhile, the embittered Sivana succeeds in his lifelong quest to find a way back to the Rock of Eternity. He steals the Eye of Sin, becoming the Sins' vessel, bests the wizard, and uses his newfound power to kill his father, brother, and Sivana Industries' board of directors.\n\nAt school, Billy defends Freddy from bullies and is chased into a subway, where he is transported to the Rock of Eternity. The wizard chooses Billy to be his new champion: By saying the name \"Shazam\", Billy is transformed into an adult superhero. The wizard turns to dust, leaving his magical staff behind. At home, Freddy is taken into Billy's confidence and helps him explore his newfound powers, which include super strength, speed, near-invulnerability, and electricity manipulation. By saying \"Shazam\" again, he can transform back into his normal body. Freddy posts [[viral video]]s of the new superhero, and Billy starts skipping school to use his powers to [[street performance|busk]] for money and fame, straining his friendship with Freddy. When Billy accidentally endangers and then saves a bus full of people, Sivana confronts him, demanding that he surrender his powers. Billy discovers that he can fly, and manages to escape. His foster siblings deduce that he is the superhero, and complete his search for his mother, who lives nearby. Billy rushes to see her, but is disheartened to learn that she abandoned him, having felt inadequate to raise him as a single teenage mother.\n\nSivana deduces Billy's identity and takes his foster siblings hostage. Billy agrees to transfer his powers to Sivana in exchange for their safety. They go to the Rock of Eternity to use the wizard's staff to effect the transfer, but the children follow and attack Sivana. Billy observes that Sivana becomes vulnerable when all seven Sins leave his body. Sivana pursues them to a winter carnival and unleashes the Sins upon the crowd. Remembering the wizard's words, Billy uses the staff to share his powers with his siblings, transforming them into [[Marvel Family|adult superheroes like him]]. He then breaks the staff, and his siblings battle the Sins while Billy faces down Sivana. By luring out the final Sin, Envy, Billy makes Sivana vulnerable and yanks the Eye of Sin out of his head, recapturing all the Sins.\n\nBilly and his siblings are hailed as heroes, return the Eye and the Sins to their prison, and realize they can use the Rock of Eternity as their superhero lair. Billy finally accepts his foster parents and siblings as his \"real\" family. In his superhero form, he has lunch with his siblings at school, revealing to Freddy's surprise that he has also invited [[Superman]]. In a [[post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], the imprisoned Sivana is approached by [[Mister Mind|a talking caterpillar]], who proposes [[Monster Society of Evil|an alliance]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|Marvel Family}}\n* [[Asher Angel]] as [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Billy Batson]], a troubled orphan searching for his biological mother, who is chosen by the ancient wizard Shazam as his champion.

Four major sequences take place here, including the opening scene when a young Thad enters and is rejected as the new hero; when he returns as the older Dr. Sivana; when Billy enters and becomes Shazam; and the final showdown between Shazam and Sivana. VFX Supervisor Aaron Weintraub and the team at Mr. X were brought on board three months before shooting began in Toronto \u2013 where the town was abuzz with this exciting project and the mayor talked it up frequently. Weintraub found working with Sandberg and the filmmaking team to be an open, inviting, and collaborative experience.\n\nWhile the first level of the Rock of Eternity was an elaborately built set, everything above 20 feet was a digital environment extension, and within that was every type of visual effect \u2013 from bringing Shazam's chest bolt to life; to stunts with digi-doubles, people melting and statues crumbling; to the Orb and the Seven Deadly Sins flying in and out of it. the final showdown between Shazam and Sivana, in which the latter lets loose his gang of monsters, a 360 shot where seven creatures form from smoke unleashed from within.\n\nRodeo FX team deliver more than 130 shots to DC's latest entry, Shazam!. RodeoFX team recreate the city backdrop for the boardroom sequence. Using photographs of Pittsburgh, They built matte paintings of the city as seen from the boardroom, adding buildings and bustlings streets.\n\nFor the title sequence, They delivered the compositing of the company logos in the opening credits and built and animated the magic 8 ball in CG, adding frost and rays of light beam along matching the effects from the key subway scene from the film.\n\nDigital Domain worked on 26 VFX shots for the movie.

''''' is a 2019 American [[superhero film]] based on the [[DC Comics]] [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|character]]. Produced by [[New Line Cinema]] and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], it is the seventh installment in the [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU). Directed by [[David F. Sandberg]] from a screenplay by Henry Gayden, and a story by Gayden and [[Darren Lemke]], the film stars [[Asher Angel]] as Billy Batson, a teenage boy who can transform into an adult superhero, played by [[Zachary Levi]]. [[Mark Strong]], [[Jack Dylan Grazer]], [[Adam Brody]], and [[Djimon Hounsou]] also star. The plot follows Billy Batson, who is chosen by the ancient wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]] as his new champion and receives various superpowers. Billy and his best friend [[Captain Marvel, Jr.|Freddy Freeman]] (Grazer) must discover Billy's new powers in order to stop the evil [[Doctor Sivana|Dr. Thaddeus Sivana]] (Strong) and the [[Seven Deadly Enemies of Man]].\n\nDevelopment of a live-action ''Shazam!'' film began at New Line in the early 2000s but was delayed for many years. The film went into pre-production in 2009 with director [[Peter Segal]] and writer [[John August]] and [[Dwayne Johnson]] considered to star as the villain [[Black Adam]], but the project fell through; Dwayne Johnson acts as an executive producer on ''Shazam!''. [[William Goldman]], [[Alec Sokolow]], [[Joel Cohen (writer)|Joel Cohen]], Bill Birch, and [[Geoff Johns]], among others, were all attached to the project as writers at various points. The film was officially announced in 2014, with Johnson attached to star as either Shazam or Black Adam. He would later be cast in January 2017 to lead a solo ''Black Adam'' development project, currently targeted for a December 2021 release.<ref name=\"BlackAdamRelease\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/black-adam-release-date-set-2021-1254807 |title=Dwayne Johnson's 'Black Adam' Sets 2021 Release Date |website=The Hollywood Reporter |language=en |access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref> Sandberg signed on to direct ''Shazam!'' in February 2017 and Levi was cast that October, with Angel joining the following month. [[Principal photography]] began in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada on January 29, 2018, with most of the film shot at [[Pinewood Toronto Studios]], and [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on May 11, 2018.\n\n''Shazam!'' was released in the United States by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] in [[RealD 3D]], [[Dolby Cinema]], [[IMAX 3D]], [[4DX]] and [[ScreenX]] <!--no IMAX 2D prints--> on April 5, 2019. The film grossed $366 million worldwide, making it  a box office success. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for Sandberg's direction and the performances of Levi, Grazer, and Angel, as well as its light tone and sense of fun.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/shazam-reviews-what-critics-are-saying-1196688|title='Shazam!': What the Critics Are Saying|author=Katie Kilkenny|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=March 23, 2019|accessdate=March 23, 2019}}</ref> A sequel is set for release on November 4, 2022.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the word count in this section should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1974 [[Upstate New York]], young [[Doctor Sivana|Thaddeus Sivana]] is riding in a car with his father and brother when he is suddenly transported to the [[Rock of Eternity]], a magical temple in another dimension. There, the ancient wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]] has spent centuries searching for someone pure of heart on whom to bestow his power and name as champion, after the previous champion released the [[Seven Deadly Enemies of Man|Seven Deadly Sins]] which killed the rest of the Council of Wizards. Thaddeus is tempted by the Eye of Sin, through which he hears the voices of the Sins, trapped in stone statues, promising him power if he will free them. The wizard deems Thaddeus unworthy and magically returns him to the car, where he makes a scene causing a car crash, crippling his father. The Sins send Thaddeus a message telling him to find them.\n\nIn present-day [[Philadelphia]], 14-year-old foster child [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Billy Batson]] continually runs away from foster homes to search for his birth mother, from whom he became separated while at a carnival ten years prior. He is placed in a group home run by Victor and Rosa Vasquez, with five other foster children: [[Mary Marvel|Mary Bromfield]], Pedro Pe\u00f1a, Eugene Choi, Darla Dudley, and superhero enthusiast [[Captain Marvel Jr.|Freddy Freeman]]. Meanwhile, the embittered Sivana succeeds in his lifelong quest to find a way back to the Rock of Eternity. He steals the Eye of Sin, becoming the Sins' vessel, bests the wizard, and uses his newfound power to kill his father, brother, and Sivana Industries' board of directors.\n\nAt school, Billy defends Freddy from bullies and is chased into a subway, where he is transported to the Rock of Eternity. The wizard chooses Billy to be his new champion: By saying the name \"Shazam\", Billy is transformed into an adult superhero. The wizard turns to dust, leaving his magical staff behind. At home, Freddy is taken into Billy's confidence and helps him explore his newfound powers, which include super strength, speed, near-invulnerability, and electricity manipulation. By saying \"Shazam\" again, he can transform back into his normal body. Freddy posts [[viral video]]s of the new superhero, and Billy starts skipping school to use his powers to [[street performance|busk]] for money and fame, straining his friendship with Freddy. When Billy accidentally endangers and then saves a bus full of people, Sivana confronts him, demanding that he surrender his powers. Billy discovers that he can fly, and manages to escape. His foster siblings deduce that he is the superhero, and complete his search for his mother, who lives nearby. Billy rushes to see her, but is disheartened to learn that she abandoned him, having felt inadequate to raise him as a single teenage mother.\n\nSivana deduces Billy's identity and takes his foster siblings hostage. Billy agrees to transfer his powers to Sivana in exchange for their safety. They go to the Rock of Eternity to use the wizard's staff to effect the transfer, but the children follow and attack Sivana. Billy observes that Sivana becomes vulnerable when all seven Sins leave his body. Sivana pursues them to a winter carnival and unleashes the Sins upon the crowd. Remembering the wizard's words, Billy uses the staff to share his powers with his siblings, transforming them into [[Marvel Family|adult superheroes like him]]. He then breaks the staff, and his siblings battle the Sins while Billy faces down Sivana. By luring out the final Sin, Envy, Billy makes Sivana vulnerable and yanks the Eye of Sin out of his head, recapturing all the Sins.\n\nBilly and his siblings are hailed as heroes, return the Eye and the Sins to their prison, and realize they can use the Rock of Eternity as their superhero lair. Billy finally accepts his foster parents and siblings as his \"real\" family. In his superhero form, he has lunch with his siblings at school, revealing to Freddy's surprise that he has also invited [[Superman]]. In a [[post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], the imprisoned Sivana is approached by [[Mister Mind|a talking caterpillar]], who proposes [[Monster Society of Evil|an alliance]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|Marvel Family}}\n* [[Asher Angel]] as [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Billy Batson]], a troubled orphan searching for his biological mother, who is chosen by the ancient wizard Shazam as his champion.

Four major sequences take place here, including the opening scene when a young Thad enters and is rejected as the new hero; when he returns as the older Dr. Sivana; when Billy enters and becomes Shazam; and the final showdown between Shazam and Sivana. VFX Supervisor Aaron Weintraub and the team at Mr. X were brought on board three months before shooting began in Toronto \u2013 where the town was abuzz with this exciting project and the mayor talked it up frequently. Weintraub found working with Sandberg and the filmmaking team to be an open, inviting, and collaborative experience.\n\nWhile the first level of the Rock of Eternity was an elaborately built set, everything above 20 feet was a digital environment extension, and within that was every type of visual effect \u2013 from bringing Shazam's chest bolt to life; to stunts with digi-doubles, people melting and statues crumbling; to the Orb and the Seven Deadly Sins flying in and out of it. the final showdown between Shazam and Sivana, in which the latter lets loose his gang of monsters, a 360 shot where seven creatures form from smoke unleashed from within.\n\nRodeo FX team deliver more than 130 shots to DC's latest entry, Shazam!. RodeoFX team recreate the city backdrop for the boardroom sequence. Using photographs of Pittsburgh, They built matte paintings of the city as seen from the boardroom, adding buildings and bustlings streets.\n\nFor the title sequence, They delivered the compositing of the company logos in the opening credits and built and animated the magic 8 ball in CG, adding frost and rays of light beam along matching the effects from the key subway scene from the film.\n\nDigital Domain worked on 26 VFX shots for the movie. Additionally Rise FX and DNEG provide visual effects for the film and the 3D conversion.\n\n==Music==\n{{main|Shazam!

Arminius himself and the original Remonstrants avoided a clear conclusion on this matter. But they raised the question. And the natural implications of the views at the heart of Arminianism, even in its early stages as a formal movement, tended to question whether Calvinism's assumptions of necessary perseverance was truly Biblical. Those tendencies indicated by the questions raised did not take long to reach fruition, and thus Calvinism and Arminianism have come to be traditionally divided on this issue.<ref>''Grace, Faith, Free Will'', 183.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nPrior to the time of the debate between Calvinists and the Arminians at the [[Synod of Dort]] (1618\u20131619), the view in the early church appears to be on the side of conditional security. From his research of the writings of the early church fathers (AD 90\u2013313), patristic scholar David W. Bercot arrived at this conclusion: \"Since the early Christians believed that our continued faith and obedience are necessary for salvation, it naturally follows that they believed that a 'saved' person could still end up being lost.\"<ref>''Will the Real Heretics Please Stand Up: A New Look at Today's Evangelical Church in the Light of Early Christianity'', 65. For quotes that appear to support his conclusions see \"Salvation,\" in ''A Dictionary of Early Christian Beliefs'', edited by David Bercot, 574\u2013585, 586\u2013591. See also the article in the External Links by Calvinist John Jefferson Davis titled: \"The Perseverance of the Saints: A History of the Doctrine,\" ''Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society'' 34:2 (June 1991), 213\u2013228. He covers the key people and groups that have discussed this topic from Augustine (354\u2013430) to 1981. For a helpful overview see B. J. Oropeza's \"Apostasy and Perseverance in Church History\" in ''Paul and Apostasy: Eschatology, Perseverance, and Falling Away in the Corinthian Congregation'', 1\u201333. From his research Oropeza makes three observations concerning apostasy and perseverance in Pre-Reformation Church History. First, there were three basic venues which could lead a Christian to apostatize: theological heresies; vices (i.e., temptations to fall back into pre-conversion practices like idolatry, immorality, etc.); and persecution. Second, those who apostatized were excommunicated from the church. Third, \"the notion of perseverance involved patient endurance through persecutions and temptations\" (''Paul and Apostasy'', 12).</ref>\n\n[[File:James Arminius 3.jpg|175px|thumb|Arminius in his study]]\n\n===Arminius and conditional security===\n[[Jacobus Arminius]] (1560\u20131609) arrived at the same conclusion in his own readings of the early church fathers. In responding to Calvinist William Perkins arguments for the perseverance of the saints, he wrote: \"In reference to the sentiments of the [early church] fathers, you doubtless know that almost all antiquity is of the opinion, that believers can fall away and perish.\"<ref>''Works of Arminius'', 3:438.</ref> On another occasion he notes that such a view was never \"reckoned as a heretical opinion,\" but \"has always had more supporters in the church of Christ, than that which denies its possibility.\"<ref>''Works of Arminius'', 2:472\u2013473.</ref> Arminius' opinion on the subject is clearly communicated in this relatively brief statement:\n\n<blockquote>\nMy sentiments respecting the perseverance of the Saints are, that those persons who have been grafted into Christ by true faith, and have thus been made partakers of his life-giving Spirit, possess sufficient powers [or strength] to fight against Satan, sin, the world and their own flesh, and to gain the victory over these enemies\u2014yet not without the assistance of the grace of the same Holy Spirit. Jesus Christ also by his Spirit assists them in all their temptations, and affords them the ready aid of his hand; and, provided they stand prepared for the battle, implore his help, and be not wanting to themselves, Christ preserves them from falling. So that it is not possible for them, by any of the cunning craftiness or power of Satan, to be either seduced or dragged out of the hands of Christ. But I think it is useful and will be quite necessary in our first convention, [or Synod] to institute a diligent inquiry from the Scriptures, whether it is not possible for some individuals through negligence to desert the commencement of their existence in Christ, to cleave again to the present evil world, to decline from the sound doctrine which was once delivered to them, to lose a good conscience, and to cause Divine grace to be ineffectual. Though I here openly and ingenuously affirm, I never taught that a ''true believer can, either totally or finally fall away from the faith, and perish''; yet I will not conceal, that there are passages of scripture which seem to me to wear this aspect; and those answers to them which I have been permitted to see, are not of such a kind as to approve themselves on all points to my understanding. On the other hand, certain passages are produced for the contrary doctrine [of unconditional perseverance] which are worthy of much consideration.<ref>''Works of Arminius,'' 2:219\u2013220. William Nichols notes: \"Arminius spoke nearly the same modest words when interrogated on this subject in the last Conference which he had with Gomarus [a Calvinist], before the states of Holland, on the 12th of Aug. 1609, only two months prior to his decease\" (''Works of Arminius'', 1:665). Oropeza says, \"Although Arminius denied having taught final apostasy in his ''Declaration of Sentiments'', in the ''Examination of the Treatise of Perkins on the Order and Mode of Predestination'' he writes that a person who is being 'built' into the church of Christ may resist the continuation of this process. Concerning the believers, 'It may suffice to encourage them, if they know that no power or prudence can dislodge them from the rock, unless they of their own will forsake their position.' [''Works of Arminius'', 3:455, cf. 1:667] A believing member of Christ may become slothful, give place to sin, and gradually die altogether, ceasing to be a member. [''Works of Arminius'', 3:458] The covenant of God (Jeremiah 23) 'does not contain in itself an impossibility of defection from God, but a promise of the gift of fear, whereby they shall be hindered from going away from God so long as that shall flourish in their hearts.' If there is any consistency in Arminius' position, he did not seem to deny the possibility of falling away\" (''Paul and Apostasy'', 16).</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nFor Arminius the believer's security is conditional\u2014\"provided they stand prepared for the battle, implore his help, and be not wanting to themselves.\" This complements what Arminius says elsewhere in his writings: \"God resolves to receive into favor those who repent and believe, and to save in Christ, on account of Christ, and through Christ, those who persevere [in faith], but to leave under sin and wrath those who are impenitent and unbelievers, and to condemn them as aliens from Christ.\"<ref>''Works of Arminius'', 2:465; cf. 2:466.</ref> In another place he writes: \"[God] wills that they, who believe and persevere in faith, shall be saved, but that those, who are unbelieving and impenitent, shall remain under condemnation.\"<ref>''Works of Arminius'', 3:412; cf. 3:413.

This is evidenced in the fifth article drafted by its leaders in 1610:\n\n<blockquote>\nThat those who are incorporated into Christ by a true faith, and have thereby become partakers of his life-giving Spirit, have thereby full power to strive against Satan, sin, the world, and their own flesh, and to win the victory; it being well understood that it is ever through the assisting grace of the Holy Ghost; and that Jesus Christ assists them through his Spirit in all temptations, extends to them his hand, and if only they are ready for the conflict, and desire his help, and are not inactive, keeps them from falling, so that they, by not craft or power of Satan, can be misled nor plucked out of Christ's hand, according to the Word of Christ, John 10:28: 'Neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.'  But whether they are capable, through negligence, of forsaking again the first beginnings of their life in Christ, of again returning to this present evil world, of turning away from the holy doctrine which was delivered them, of losing a good conscience, of becoming devoid of grace, that must be more particularly determined out of the Holy Scripture, before we ourselves can teach it with full persuasion of our minds.<ref>Philip Schaff, editor. ''The Creeds of Christendom Volume III: The Evangelical Protestant Creeds'', \"The Articles of the Remonstrants,\" 3:548\u2013549.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSometime between 1610, and the official proceeding of the Synod of Dort (1618), the [[Remonstrants]] became fully persuaded in their minds that the Scriptures taught that a true believer was capable of falling away from faith and perishing eternally as an unbeliever. They formalized their views in \"The Opinion of the Remonstrants\" (1618). Points three and four in the fifth article read:\n\n<blockquote>\nTrue believers can fall from true faith and can fall into such sins as cannot be consistent with true and justifying faith; not only is it possible for this to happen, but it even happens frequently. True believers are able to fall through their own fault into shameful and atrocious deeds, to persevere and to die in them; and therefore finally to fall and to perish.<ref>Peter Y.

Harrison) \"Apostasy,\" Robert Winston Ross [Baker Book House, 1976], 57.</ref> Arminian scholar Robert Shank writes,\n\n<blockquote>\nThe English word ''apostasy'' is derived from the Greek noun, ''apostasia''. Thayer defines ''apostasia'' as 'a falling away, defection, apostasy; in the Bible sc. from the true religion.' The word appears twice in the New Testament (Acts 21:21, 2 Thessalonians 2:3). Its meaning is well illustrated in its use in Acts 21:21, ... \"you are teaching apostasy (defection) from Moses.\" ... A kindred word is the synonym ''apostasion''. Thayer defines ''apostasion'', as used in the Bible, as \"divorce, repudiation.\" He cites {{bibleverse|Matthew|19:7|9}} and {{bibleverse|Mark|10:4|9}}, ... \"a bill of divorce [''apostasion''].\" He also cites [[Matthew 5:31]], ... \"let him give her a bill of divorce [''apostasion''].\" He cites the use of ''apostasion'' by Demosthenes as \"defection, of a freedman from his patron.\" Moulton and Milligan cite the use of [''apostasion''] as a \"bond of relinquishing (of property sold) ... a contract of renunciation ... the renunciation of rights of ownership.\" They also cite the use of ''apostasion'' \"with reference to 'a deed of divorce.'\" The meaning of the [related] verb ''aphist\u0113mi'' ... is, of course, consonant with the meaning of the nouns. It is used transitively in Acts 5:37, ... \"drew away people after him.\" Intransitively, it means to ''depart, go away, desert, withdraw, fall away, become faithless'', etc.<ref>''Life in the Son'', 157-158. Richard A. Muller offers this definition of apostasy (Greek ''apostasia''): \"a willful falling away from, or rebellion against, Christian truth. Apostasy is the rejection of Christ by one who has been a Christian ...\" (''Dictionary of Greek and Latin Theological Terms: Drawn Principally from Protestant Scholastic Theology'', 41). In ''The New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology'', Wolfgang Bauder had this to say on ''aphist\u0113mi'' (Fall, Fall Away): \"Of theological importance is falling away in the religious sense... 1 Timothy 4:1 describes 'falling away from the faith' in the last days in terms of falling into false, heretical beliefs. Luke 8:13 probably refers to apostasy as a result of eschatological temptation. Here are people who have come to believe, who have received the gospel 'with joy.' But under the pressure of persecution and tribulation arising because of the faith, they break off the relationship with God into which they have entered. According to Hebrews 3:12, apostasy consists in an unbelieving and self-willed movement away from God (in contrast to Hebrews 3:14), which must be prevented at all costs. ''aphist\u0113mi'' thus connotes in the passages just mentioned the serious situation of becoming separated from the living God after a previous turning towards him, by falling away from the faith. It is a movement of unbelief and sin, which can also be expressed by other words (cf. the par. to Luke 8:13 in Matthew 13:21; Mark 4:17; [see] Offence, art. ''skandalon''). Expressions equivalent in meaning to the warning in 1 Timothy 4:1 include ''nauage\u014d'', suffer shipwreck, 1:19; ''astoche\u014d'' miss the mark, 1:6; 6:21; 2 Timothy 2:18; cf. also ''aperchomai'', go away, John 6:66; ''apostreph\u014d'', turn away; arneomai, deny; ''metatith\u0113mi'', change, alter; ''m\u0113 menein'', do not abide, John 15:6; [see] art. ''pipt\u014d''; Lead Astray, art. ''plana\u014d''; and the pictures of defection in Matthew 24:9-12, and Revelation 13.\" (3:607\u2013608)</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nI. Howard Marshall notes that ''aphistemi'' \"is used of giving up the faith in Luke 8:13; 1 Timothy 4:1 and Hebrews 3:12, and is used of departure from God in the LXX [i.e., Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament].\"<ref>''Kept by the Power'', 217, note 5; cf. Williams, ''Renewal Theology'', 2:131\u2013135.</ref> Marshall also notes that \"the failure to persist in faith is expressed by [other Greek] words which mean falling away, drifting and stumbling.\"<ref>''Kept by the Power'', 23; These are the other Greek words connected to apostasy: \"[''pipt\u014d''], 'to fall' (Romans 11:11, 22; 14:4; 1 Corinthians 10:12; 13:8; Hebrews 4:11; Revelation 2:5); [''parapipt\u014d''], 'to fall away, transgress' (Hebrews 6:6), [''pararrhe\u014d''], 'to drift away' (Hebrews 2:1); the root [''skandal-''], 'to stumble, offend' is also important\" (Marshall, ''Kept by the Power'', 217, note 4).</ref> Of particular theological significance<ref>I. Howard Marshall, ''Kept by the Power of God: A Study of Perseverance and Falling Away'', 217.</ref> are the verb ''skandaliz\u014d'' (\"fall away from faith\")<ref>Heinz Giesen, ''Exegetical Dictionary of the New Testament'', 3:248.</ref> and the noun ''skandalon'' (\"enticement to unbelief, cause of salvation's loss, seduction\").<ref>Heinz Giesen, ''Exegetical Dictionary of the New Testament'', 3:249. Heinz Giesen writes: In the passive voice \u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b6\u03c9 [''skandaliz\u014d''] more often means ... \"fall away from faith.\" In the interpretation of the parable of the sower (Mark 4:13-20 par. Matt 13:18\u201323) those identified with the seeds sown on rocky ground, i.e., those \"with no root in themselves,\" the inconstant ones, go astray to their own ruin when persecuted on account of the word, i.e., they fall away from faith (Mark 4:17 par. Matt 13:21). The Lukan parallel reads appropriately \u1f00\u03c6\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9 [''aphist\u0113mi'', fall away] (8:13). In Matt 24:10 Jesus predicts that in the end time many will fall away [''skandaliz\u014d'']. The result is that they will hate one another, wickedness will be multiplied, and love will grow cold. Yet whoever endures in love until the end will be saved (vv. 11, 13). ... In the Johannine farewell address (John 16:1) \u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b6\u03c9 [''skandaliz\u014d''] does not only imply an \"endangering of faith\" ... but rather \"falling away from faith\" entirely, from which the disciples and Christians are to be kept. ... In the active voice \u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b6\u03c9 [''skandaliz\u014d''] means \"cause someone to fall away from (or reject) faith,\" as in the saying of Jesus about the person who \"''causes'' one of these little ones who believe in me ''to sin [stumble]''\" (Mark 9:42 par. Matt 18:6/Luke 17:2). The Christian is enjoined to reject anything that might be an obstacle to faith, as emphasized in Mark 9:43, 45, 47 in metaphorical, hyperbolic language: Hand, foot, and eye\u2014in Jewish understanding the loci of lust or sinful desires\u2014must be given up if they threaten to become the cause of loss of faith and thus of salvation. This ... underscores the seriousness of conviction within which one must persevere if one wishes to enter (eternal) life or the kingdom of God. ... Matt 5:29, 30 also issues an exhortation to decisive action [cf. Matt 18:8, 9]. ... According to 1 Cor 8:9 a Christian's freedom regarding eating food offered to idols reaches its limit when it becomes a stumbling block to one's brother (\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1 [''proskomma'']). Hence Paul emphasizes that he will never again eat meat if by doing so he causes his brother to fall and thus to lose salvation (\u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b6\u03c9 [''skandaliz\u014d''], v. 13a, b), since otherwise that weaker brother is destroyed by the knowledge of the \"stronger\" (v. 11). Whoever sins against his brothers sins also against Christ (v. 12). ... Within the context of the protection of the \"little ones\" in the Church, i.e., probably the \"weak ones\" ([Matthew] 18:6\u201310), Jesus utters an eschatological threat (\"woe!\") against the world (alienated from God) because of ''temptations to sin'' (v. 7a); though he allows that such ''temptations'' must come (v. 7b), he finally hurls an eschatological \"woe!\" against the person by whom the ''temptation'' comes (v. 7c). \u03c3\u03ba\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd [''skandalon''] used here of the temptation to fall away from faith. The parallel, Luke 17:1, like Matt 18:7b, also underscores that such temptations are unavoidable; nonetheless, the person by whom they come receives the eschatological \"woe!\" that already places him under divine judgment. ... In Rom 14:13 Paul admonishes the \"strong,\" whose position he fundamentally shares (v. 14), not to cause the \"weak\" any ''stumbling block to faith'' through eating habits . ... In Rom 16:17 the \u03c3\u03ba\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd [''skandalon''] are the various satanic activities of the false teachers who endanger the salvation of Church members, who are being seduced into falling away from correct teaching; such teachers also threaten both the unity and very existence of the Church. Similarly, in Rev 2:14 \u03c3\u03ba\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd [''skandalon''] refers to a ''stumbling block'' to faith in the context of false teaching. According to 1 John 2:10 there is no cause for stumbling or sin in a believer who loves his brother ... i.e., no cause for unbelief and thus a loss of salvation. (Heinz Giesen, ''Exegetical Dictionary of the New Testament'', 3:248-250)</ref>\n\nShank concluded: \"An apostate, according to the New Testament definition, is one who has severed his union with Christ by withdrawing from an actual saving relationship with Him. Apostasy is impossible for men who have not entered into a saving relationship with God... The warnings against succumbing to the ugly peril of apostasy are directed ... to men who obviously are true believers.\"<ref>''Life in the Son'', 158. William Lane comes to identical conclusions in his short commentary on the book of Hebrews. He writes: \"The sin [in Hebrews 6] that the preacher warns his friends to avoid is commonly called 'apostasy.' It is a sin that only a Christian can commit. ''Apostasy consists in a deliberate, planned, intelligent decision to renounce publicly association with Jesus Christ''. It signifies a choice not to believe God, not to listen to God, not to obey God. It is the decision to be disobedient and to deny all that Christ has done for you\" (''Hebrews: A Call to Commitment'' [Peabody: Hendrickson Publishers, 1985], 94).</ref> J. Rodman Williams adds,\n<blockquote>\nOne of the mistakes made by those who affirm the invariable continuance of salvation is the viewing of salvation too much as a \"state.\" From this perspective, to be saved is to enter into \"a state of grace.\" However true it is that one moves into a new realm\u2014whether it is called the kingdom of God, eternal life, or other like expression\u2014the heart of the matter is the establishment of a new relationship with God. Prior to salvation, one was \"without God\" or \"against God,\" cut off from His presence. Now through Jesus Christ reconciliation\u2014\"at-one-ment with God\"\u2014has occurred. Moreover, the Holy Spirit, who becomes present, is not merely some force or energy but God Himself in a new and intimate relationship. Hence, if a person begins to \"drift away,\" it is not from some static condition or \"state\" but ''from a Person''. It is a personal relationship that thereby is betrayed, broken, forfeited; this is the tragic meaning of apostasy. It is not so much giving up something, even so marvellous as salvation, but the forsaking of a Person. Surely through such an action salvation too is forfeited. But the critical matter is the severing of a relationship with the personal God.<ref>''Renewal Theology'', 2:135.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===The dangers of apostasy===\nMarshall finds four biblical dangers that could serve as precursors to committing apostasy:<ref>''Kept by the Power'', 197; see also Arrington, ''Unconditional Eternal Security: Myth or Truth?'' 178\u2013179.</ref>\n\n{{quotation|\n: '''1.

Temptation to Sin''' \u2013 \"The significance of this form of temptation is that it causes the believer to deny the power of God to preserve him from sinning, to return to the very things from which he was saved by belief in Christ (and which by their nature exclude a man from the kingdom of God), and to perform those acts which are expressly forbidden by the Lord ... In other words, sin is an act and attitude which is incompatible with the obedience of faith, and hence constitutes a denial of faith.\"\n: '''4. Weariness in Faith''' \u2013 This is where \"the believer gradually drifts away from his faith and passes into a state of apostasy.\"|}}\n\nMarshall concludes: \"The New Testament contains too many warnings about the danger of sin and apostasy for us to be complacent about these possibilities. ...

Arrington, ''Unconditional Eternal Security: Myth or Truth?'' 179.</ref> Methodist scholar Ben Witherington would add: \"The New Testament suggests that one is not eternally secure until one is securely in eternity. Short of that, there is the possibility of apostasy or rebellion against God by one who has believed in Christ. Apostasy, however, is not to be confused with the notion of accidentally or unconsciously \"falling away.\" Apostasy is a conscious, wilful rebellion against God ... Unless one commits such an act of apostasy or rebellion, one need not worry about one's salvation, for God has a firm grip on the believer.\"<ref>''John's Wisdom: A Commentary on the Fourth Gospel'', 386, fn. 28).</ref>\n\nWith apostasy being a real possibility for Christians, Arminians seek to follow the example that New Testament writer's provide in urging Christians to persevere.<ref>Picirilli, ''Grace, Faith, Free Will'', 207; Arrington, ''Unconditional Eternal Security: Myth or Truth?'' 184\u2013185.</ref> Scot McKnight clarifies what perseverance means and doesn't mean for Arminians:\n<blockquote>\nIt doesn't mean sinlessness; it doesn't mean that we are on some steady and never-failing incline up into pure sanctification; it does not deny stumbling or messy spirituality; it doesn't deny doubt and problems. It simply means that the person continues to walk with Jesus and doesn't walk away from him in a resolute manner. ... What it means is continuing trust in God.<ref>''A Long Faithfulness: A Case for Christian Perseverance'', 50-51.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSince Arminians view sin as \"an act and attitude which ... constitutes a denial of faith\",<ref>''Kept by the Power'', 197; Robert Picirilli says, \"Sin persisted in, on the part of a Christian, can lead to a retraction of faith in Christ and thus to apostasy and eternal destruction\" (''1, 2 Corinthians'', Randall House Bible Commentary, 120). Frederick Claybrook, Jr., writes: \"Practicing sin is an act of unbelief\" (''Once Saved, Always Salved? A New Testament Study of Apostasy'', 20). Johannes Bauer says, \"Sin is directly opposed to perseverance (10:36; 12:1f, 7). ... The gravity of sin consists in the fact that it constitutes mistrust and unbelief in God ([Heb] 3:12, 19; 12:25)\" (\"Sin,\" in ''Bauer Encyclopedia of Biblical Theology'', 862).

What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine and go to the mountains to seek the one that is straying? And if he should find it, assuredly, I say to you, he rejoices more over that sheep than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray. Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.\" (NKJV)\n<blockquote>\nHaving warned about sinning against humble believers (v. 6), Jesus next warned against looking down on His little ones, the humble, as if they have no value in God's economy. \"Take heed\" suggests warning and responsibility. \"Despise\" ... means \"to feel contempt for someone or something because it is thought to be bad or without value\" (Louw and Nida 1:763). The more powerful . . . believers must respect Christ's humble servants. ... [I]f God and His angels have such [high] concern for His little ones, all believers should have that same concern for each other (Hagner 33B:527). ... So intent is the Father on locating the one wandering sheep that for a time\u2014and this is the first point of this parable\u2014the one sheep receives more attention and effort than the ninety-nine (Nolland 742). ... This sheep had gone astray\u2014that is, wandered away (Greek ''plana\u014d'') from the rest of the flock. As this applies to believers, this means they can wander off into sin or false belief [cf. 18:6-9]. ... The Shepherd's excitement when he finds the lost sheep shows the high value the shepherd placed on each sheep. ... The second and overarching point of this parable in Matthew is stated in verse 14: God the Father does not\u2014literally, it is not the will of the Father\u2014to lose even one child. The concern is for sheep who yield to sin's temptation and head for apostasy. The possibility of a sheep becoming lost and perishing teaches that believers can be lost and apostatize [i.e., become an unbeliever] ([So] Gundry 365). The possibility of finding the sheep before it perishes teaches that straying little ones can be rescued before they commit apostasy (Jas. 5:19-20). The possibility of apostasy (perish, v. 14) is what motivated the shepherd to \"persistently\" (Hill 274) [search] for the sheep and then to rejoice greatly when the sheep was found.<ref>Jeffrey Crabtree, ''Matthew'', Randall House Publishers, 307-308)</ref>\n</blockquote>\n* '''Matthew 24:9\u201314''' \u2013 [Jesus said to his disciples] \"Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake.

They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you remain only because of faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid! For if God did not spare the natural branches, he certainly will not spare you either. Consider, then, the kindness and severity of God: his severity toward those who fell, but God's kindness toward you\u2014if you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you too will be cut off. (ISV)\n<blockquote>\nverses 20\u201422 involve clearly an emphatic contradiction of the teaching, by Calvin and others, that all who have been justified will ultimately be saved. For Paul assumes throughout that his readers are already justified, are adopted as sons and heirs of God, and possess the Spirit of God as a firstfruit of their inheritance: see chapters 5:9-11; 6:18, 22; 8:2, 15, 16, 23. Yet he solemnly and emphatically warns them that unless they continue in the kindness of God they will be cut off. This last can be no less than the punishment already inflicted on the unbelieving Jews who have been broken off, and who are held up in verse 20, 21 as a warning to the believing Gentiles. For Paul's deep sorrow for the unbelieving Jews proves clearly that in his view they are on the way to the destruction (chapter 2:12) awaiting unrepentant sinners. His warning to Gentiles who now stand by faith implies clearly that unless they continue in faith they will experience a similar fate. We therefore accept the words before us in their simple and full meaning. Although salvation, from the earliest good desire to final victory, is entirely a work of God, a gift of His undeserved favor, and a realisation of His eternal purpose, it is nevertheless, both in its commencement and in its continuance, altogether conditional on man's faith.<ref>Joseph Agar Beet, Obtained from the Wesleyan Heritage Collection CD [Rio: Ages Software Inc., 2002].</ref>\n</blockquote>\n* '''Romans 14:13\u201323''' \u2013 Therefore, let us stop passing judgment on one another. Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in your brother's way. As one who is in the Lord Jesus, I am fully convinced that no food is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for him it is unclean. If your brother is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not by your eating destroy your brother for whom Christ died. Do not allow what you consider good to be spoken of as evil. For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit, because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and approved by men. Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification. Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a man to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble. It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother to fall. So whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the man who does not condemn himself by what he approves. But the man who has doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating is not from faith; and everything that does not come from faith is sin. (NIV, 1984)\n<blockquote>\nThe strong Christian is warned not to place a stumbling block (. . . ''proskomma'') or an obstacle (... ''skandalon'') in a brother's path\u2026. The stumbling in this verse is spiritual \u2026 it refers to stumbling and falling into sin\u2026. It refers to ... a true \"spiritual downfall\" (Moo, 851). The cause for such spiritual stumbling would be an act on the part of the strong brother that is not wrong in itself, but which is perceived as wrong by a weak brother. Such an act becomes a stumbling block when the weak brother observes it and is influenced there by to do the same thing, ''even though in his heart he believes it is wrong'', which is sin (v. 23). In this way the strong brother has inadvertently influenced the weak brother to \"fall into sin and potential spiritual ruin\" (Moo, 852), just by exercising his Christian liberty. The point is that we must be sensitive to how our conduct is affecting others, and we must be willing to forgo perfectly legitimate behavior if it has the potential of causing someone to sin against his conscience\u2026. In v. 13 Paul urges the strong Christian to not put a stumbling block in the way of the weak; here in v. 15 he gives one reason for this, i.e., it is not consistent with love. ... To the one who loves, a weak brother's spiritual well-being is always more important than indulging the right to eat whatever one likes\u2026. [O]ne is not acting in love if his exercise of liberty influences a weak brother to follow his example and thus fall into sin by violating his own conscience. [Paul goes on to write:] '''Do not by your eating destroy your brother for whom Christ died.''' The Greek word for \"destroy\" is ... (''apollymi''), a very strong word \u2026.  Just how serious is this destruction? Is Paul referring to a loss of salvation, and condemnation to hell? \u2026 I must conclude \u2026 that this strong warning does imply that the careless and unloving exercise of Christian liberty can lead to actual loss of salvation for a weak brother. ''Apollymi'' is frequently used in the sense of eternal destruction in hell (e.g., Matt 10:28; Luke 13:3; John 3:16; Rom 2:12). The reference to the fact that Christ died for these weak brethren supports this meaning here. I.e., the destruction in view would negate the very purpose of Christ's death, which is to save them from eternal condemnation\u2026. The verse cannot be reconciled with \"once saved, always saved.\"<ref>Jack Cottrell, ''The College Press NIV Commentary: Romans'', 2:406\u2013408. Cottrell says: \"Stott is correct to point out that a weak Christian's single sin against his conscience does not in itself bring him under eternal punishment (365\u2013366), but here Paul is not referring to a single act of stumbling. He has in mind the ultimate outcome to which a single act of this kind could potentially lead. By violating his conscience the weak brother is weakened even further and could ultimately give up his faith altogether\" (Ibid, 408).</ref>\n </blockquote>\n* '''Romans 16:17\u201320''' \u2013 I urge you, brothers, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned.

While some builders may do a lousy job of building on the foundation and their work will be consumed, some work moves beyond mere shoddiness and becomes destructive.

He has real destruction in mind, and those who destroy God's temple will also be destroyed\u2026. Paul does not describe how the temple is destroyed, but it is undoubtedly relates in some way to their boastful arrogance, their eagerness to appraise others, and their competitive partisanship\u2014all the things that divide Christ... Paul allows the readers to imagine that their petty jealousies (3:3), boasting (1:29; 3:21; 4:7), arrogance (4:6, 18, 19), and quarrels (1:11; 3:3) might qualify for this bleak judgment.

Paul's point in all this it to warn \"the saints,\" \u2026 that if they persist in the same evils as the \"wicked\" they are in the same danger of not inheriting the kingdom. Some theologies have great difficulty with such warnings, implying that they are essentially hypothetical since God's children cannot be \"disinherited.\" But such a theology fails to take seriously the genuine tension of texts like this one. The warning is real; the wicked will not inherit the kingdom\u2026. Paul's concern is that the Corinthians must \"stop deceiving themselves\" or \"allowing themselves to be deceived.\" By persisting in the same behavior as those already destined for judgment they are placing themselves in the very real danger of that same judgment.

But now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation\u2014if you continue in your faith, established and firm, and do not move from the hope held out in the gospel. (NIV)\n<blockquote>\nIn the first half of verse 23 Paul breaks with tradition to address his readers in a more intimate way. His exhortation to them expresses a condition of their reconciliation, which includes both a positive and a negative element. This exhortation has caused problems for those who think of Paul's idea of salvation in terms of God's unconditional grace. However, Paul's understanding of God's salvation is profoundly Jewish and therefore covenantal. The promise of the community's final justification is part of a covenant between God and the \"true\" Israel. Even the idea of God's faithfulness to a promise made is modified by the ideals of a covenantal relationship: God's fulfillment is conditioned upon a particular response. According to Paul's gospel, getting into the faith community, which has covenanted with God for salvation, requires the believer's confidence in the redemptive merit of Christ's death (as defined in vv. 21\u201322). And staying in that community requires the believer to keep the faith. Paul does not teach a \"once saved, always saved\" kind of religion; nor does he understand faith as a \"once for all\" decision for Christ. In fact, apostasy (loss of faith) imperils one's relationship with God and with the community that has covenanted with God for salvation. So he writes that the community's eschatological fitness holds ''if you continue in your faith''... The negative ingredient of the passage envisions the very real possibility that the community may indeed ''[move] from the hope held out in the gospel'', risking God's negative verdict at Christ's parousia.<ref> Robert W.

You know quite well that we were destined for them. In fact, when we were with you, we kept telling you that we would be persecuted. And it turned out that way, as you well know.

(NIV, 1984)\n<blockquote>\nThe possibility of apostasy is expressed in the final part of the verse: ''I was afraid that in some way the tempter might have tempted you and our efforts might have been useless''. ... Paul expresses apprehension, which was rooted in his knowledge of Satanic activity. Although the Thessalonians' contemporaries were driving the persecution forward, the power of the tempter orchestrated this battle for their souls (cf. Eph. 6:11\u201312). ... The temptation of the tempter was ... to commit the sin of apostasy (Luke 8:12; 1 Pet. 5:8), which is implied in this context by the references to their stability and continuance in the faith (3:3, 6, 8). The issue is not moral lapse but continuance in faith. What was at stake was the salvation of the Thessalonians. Paul knew the machination of Satan (2 Cor. 2:11), ''the tempter'', but he was unsure whether he had met success in Thessalonica (''and out efforts might have been useless''). The temptation, while inevitable, was resistible.

Some of the believers will fall away by following the opponents' teachings that have been influenced by anti-god powers (1 Tim 4:1-3). It is affirmed here that more apostasies of those who possessed faith will take place similar to the defections of Hymenaeus and Alexander (1 Tim 1:19; cf. 1:6).

It is true that [''didaskalia'', teaching] does deliver from error and bring to truth, but that seems to be included in the ultimate goal expressed in [''s\u014dz\u014d'', save] (cf. 2:4; so also Oosterzee). The salvation of the hearers is elsewhere depicted by Paul as the central goal of the ministry (cf. especially 1 Cor. 15:1, 2; 9:22; 2 Ti. 2:10; 4:5), and it is that hope in the living God who is the Savior of all believers that Paul has presented as the centerpiece of encouragement for Timothy in this section.\"<ref> Knight, Ibid., 211-212.

For since the message spoken through angels was binding, and every violation and disobedience received its just punishment, how shall we escape if we ignore so great a salvation? This salvation, which was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him. God also testified to it by signs, wonders and various miracles, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will. (NIV)\n<blockquote>\nThis is ... where the author combines urgent exhortation and solemn warning in order to move his readers to a place of renewed confidence, hope, and persevering faith in Christ. ... The close connection between this paragraph [Heb 2:1\u20134] and the exposition in 1:5\u201314 demonstrates that scriptural exposition for our author was not an end in itself but rooted out of his concern for his readers and their perilous situation. ... The Greek construction of 2:1\u20134 consists of two sentences: a direct statement (2:1), followed by a long explanatory sentence (2:2\u20134), which includes a rhetorical question (\"how shall we escape\") with a condition (\"if we ignore [or neglect] such a great salvation\") (2:3a). The word \"therefore\" (2:1) connects this paragraph to the Son's incomparable splendor and supremacy in chapter 1. Because the Son to is superior to the prophets and the angels, what God \"has spoken to us by his Son\" (1:2), if neglected, makes one that much more culpable: \"We must pay more careful attention, therefore, to what we have heard\" lest we \"drift away.\" The expression \"what we have heard\" refers to God's revelation in his Son about salvation (cf. 2:3a). Here the danger of drifting away is due not to a rebellious refusal to heed the gospel, but to a carelessness about the commitment to Christ that it requires. The verb ''prosecho'' (lit., \"to give heed\") means not only \"pay attention\" with the mind to what one hears, but also \"to act upon what one perceives\" (Morris, 1981, 21). This verb is analogous to ''katecho'' in 3:6, 14; 10:23, where the readers are admonished to \"hold fast to their confession of faith, without which the goal of salvation cannot be reached\" (Lane, 1991, 37). The Greek word translated \"drift away\" (''pararreo'') has nautical overtones, as when a ship drifts past a harbor to shipwreck. The picture thus conveyed in 2:1 is that of Christians who are \"in peril of being carried downstream past a fixed landing place and so failing to gain its security\" (Bruce, 1990, 66). The result of drifting from Christ is a worse end than that experienced by those who disobeyed the law of Moses under the old covenant (vv. 2\u20133; cf. 10:28). As Bruce notes, \"our author is warning Christian readers, who have heard and accepted the gospel, that if they yield to the temptation to abandon their profession, their plight is hopeless\" (1990, 66). \"The message spoken by angels\" (2:2) refers to the law given at Sinai. Here we begin to see the primary reason why the Son's superiority to the angels was emphasized in 1:5\u201314. The author makes an a fortiori argument (i.e., arguing from a lesser, well-accepted truth to a greater truth, for which there is even stronger evidence) from angels to the Son, from law to gospel (cf. 7:21\u201322; 9:13\u201314; 10:28\u201329). The angels were of instrumental importance in the lesser matter of the law; the Son is of supreme importance in the greater matter of the gospel (Hagner, 1983, 21). If the law accompanied by angels was honored, how much more should we respect God\u2019s word that came in his Son! If \"every violation and disobedience\" of the law had inescapable consequences, how can we hope to escape the consequences of ignoring the gospel of Christ? Our author writes \"to awaken the conscience to the grave consequences of neglecting\" God's message in his Son (Guthrie, 1983, 80). The answer to the rhetorical question in verse 3\u2014\"How shall we escape if we ignore such a great salvation?\"\u2014is obvious: No escape is possible. In Hebrews \"salvation\" (''soteria'') was promised by the Old Testament prophets (1:1), is fulfilled by Jesus in the present time (2:3, 10; 5:9), and will be consummated in his future coming (cf. 1:14; 6:9; 9:28; see ''TDNT'', 7:989\u20131012). ... The emphasis here and elsewhere in Hebrews [with the phrase \"how shall we escape\"] is on the inescapable, terrible, and eternal consequences for apostasy (cf. 6:4\u20136; 10:26\u201331). The first steps in that catastrophic direction occur when Christians drift away from Christ (2:1) and ignore God's glorious salvation in his Son (2:3a). The author identifies his readers as fellow believers by using the pronoun \"we\" in 2:1, 3a and \"us\" in 2:3. As I. Howard Marshall points out, the warning addresses \"people who have heard the gospel and responded to it. At no point in the Epistle is it warrantable to assume that the readers originally addressed by the author are not Christians\" (1969, 139). By using the preacher's \"we,\" our author not only identifies the readers as believers, but also includes himself and all other believers in the same warning (cf. 3:6, 14; 10:26\u201327; 12:25).<ref> J. Wesley Adams, \"Hebrews,\" ''Life in the Spirit New Testament Commentary'', [Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1999], 1312\u20131313. See also Scot McKnight's article \"A Synthetic Look at the Warning Passages in Hebrews\" in External Link.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n* '''Hebrews 3:7\u201319''' \u2013 So, as the Holy Spirit says: \"Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion, during the time of testing in the desert, where your fathers tested and tried me and for forty years saw what I did. That is why I was angry with that generation, and I said, 'Their hearts are always going astray, and they have not known my ways.' So I declared on oath in my anger, 'They shall never enter my rest.'\" See to it, brothers, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away [\"falls away,\" NASB]  from the living God. But encourage [\"exhort,\" ESV] one another daily, as long as it is called Today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness. We have come to share in Christ if we hold firmly till the end the confidence we had at first. As has just been said: \"Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion.\" Who were they who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt? And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the desert? And to whom did God swear that they would never enter his rest if not to those who disobeyed? So we see that they were not able to enter, because of their unbelief. (Heb. 3:7-19, NIV 1984)\n<blockquote>\nHebrews views the possibility of remaining steadfast in faith or abandoning faith as a real choice facing the readers; the author illustrates the consequences of the latter by referring to the destruction of the rebellious Hebrews in the desert after their glorious deliverance from Egypt (3:7\u201319). The final statement in 3:6 [\"And we are God's house, if indeed we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope in which we glory\"] serves as a transition to the solemn warning and exhortation in 3:7\u201319. As a comparison was drawn between Moses and Jesus in 3:1\u20136, so now a parallel is drawn between (1) the response of unbelief and disobedience by the Hebrews who were redeemed out of Egypt under Moses' leadership (3:7\u201311), and (2) the possibility of the same response by the Hebrews who were redeemed by Christ under the new covenant provisions of salvation (3:12\u201319). Moses had been faithful to the end (3:2, 5), but most of those who left Egypt with him were unfaithful. They all shared by faith in the first great Passover deliverance but afterward because of unbelief hardened their hearts against God and perished in the desert (cf. Num. 13:26\u201314:38). Likewise, Christ, who is far superior to Moses, is also faithful (Heb. 3:2, 6), but the author of Hebrews was deeply concerned that the community of Hebrew Christians he is addressing, who had experienced the deliverance of the cross, were now in danger of hardening their hearts and of perishing because of unbelief . ... This section reveals the progressive nature of unbelief: (1) The seed of unbelief is sown and allowed to sprout; (2) unbelief leads to hardness of heart; (3) hardness leads to disobedience and rebellion; and (4) rebellion leads to apostasy and forfeiting forever God's promised rest. The powerful warning and exhortation in this section begins with a quotation from Psalm 95:7\u201311 (Heb. 3:7\u201311) and follows with the author's application for his readers (3:12\u201319). The application is framed by the repetition of the verb ''blepo'' (\"see to it,\" 3:12; \"so we see,\" 3:19) and the noun ''apistia'' (\"unbelieving,\" 3:12; \"unbelief,\" 3:19). Lane observes: \"The warning against unbelief in vv. 12 and 19 provides a literary and theological frame for the admonition to maintain the basic position of faith, which is centrally placed in v. 14\" (1991, 83). ... The warning of Hebrews 3:7\u201319 is that \"those who have experienced the redemption of the cross may find themselves in a similar situation\" (Hagner, 1983, 43) to the desert generation who perished, if they harden their hearts in unbelief and turn back from Christ to their former way of life. The passage represents a serious exhortation to persevering discipleship and unwavering faith. ... In Hebrews 3:12, the author applies the Psalm 95 warning to his fellow believers. That his readers are genuine Christians is again indicated by the word \"brothers\" (cf. 3:1). He is concerned that none of them be lost: \"Be careful,\" he exhorts, \"that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away [''apostenai'', lit., departs] from the living God\" (pers. trans.). Like the Hebrews mentioned in Psalm 95:7\u201311, God's people under the new covenant \"sometimes turn away from God in apostasy . ... This may be provoked by suffering or persecution or by the pressures of temptation, but the root cause is always unbelief\" (Peterson, 1994, 1330). Apostasy refers to abandoning what one has previously believed, in this case, a disowning of Jesus as the Son of God a departing from the fellowship of believers. Our author calls it a turning \"away from the living God.\" . . . As with the desert generation, apostasy is not so much a decision of the moment as it is the culmination of a process of hardening the heart (3:8, 13, 15) in unbelief (3:12, 19; cf. 4:2), resulting in the end in rebellion against God (3:8, 15, 16), disobedience (3:18; cf. 4:6), and finally turning away from God (3:12; cf. 3:10). An important safeguard against apostasy is a loving, nurturing community of true believers, who \"encourage one another daily\" in the Lord (3:13). Isolation from other believers particularly makes one vulnerable to the world's wisdom and lies, to the many temptations of the devil, and to \"sin's deceitfulness.\" . . . \"Today\" carries with it both a note of urgency and an inherent warning that windows of opportunity do not last forever. . . . Believers are sharers (''metochoi'', plural) \"in Christ\" (3:14, NIV), \"partakers of Christ\" (NASB, NKJV), \"partners of Christ\" (NRSV). As Christ came to share our humanity, so \"in Christ\" we share his life, grace (4:16), salvation (2:10), kingdom (12:28), suffering (13:12\u201313), and glory (2:10). To begin well is commendable, but we must \"hold firmly till the end the confidence we had at first\" (3:14b).... We must persevere until Jesus comes the second time (cf. 9:28) or until we go to him through death (cf. 2 Cor. 5:8).<ref> J.

NASB, HCSB] that none of you be found to have fallen short of it. For we also have had the gospel preached to us, just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, because those who heard did not combine it with faith. Now we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said, \"So I declared on oath in my anger, 'They shall never enter my rest.'\" And yet his work has been finished since the creation of the world. For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in these words: \"And on the seventh day God rested from all his work.\" And again in the passage above he says, \"They shall never enter my rest.\" It still remains that some will enter that rest, and those who formerly had the gospel preached to them did not go in, because of their disobedience. Therefore, God again set a certain day, calling it Today, when a long time later he spoke through David, as was said before: \"Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.\" For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day. There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God; for anyone who enters God's rest also rests from his own work, just as God did from his. Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following their example of disobedience.

Admission to this new dimension of 'rest' is solely determined by one's saving faith in Christ, who is depicted in the New Testament as the sole vehicle by which ultimate, spiritual rest is granted to the believer by God. This perspective emerges most clearly in the book of Hebrews, and also in John's Revelation\" (''Expository Dictionary of Bible Words'', 335, 817).</ref> Furthermore, many commentators and scholars mention how\n<blockquote>\n\"Rest\" correlates with other images of salvation described as future (\"to come\") or transcendent (\"heavenly\") in Hebrews. There are future realities such as \"the world to come\" (2:5), powers of the age to come (6:5), good things to come (10:1), and the city to come (13:14). Their transcendent character is expressed in references to the heavenly call (3:1), \"heavenly gift\" (6:4), heavenly sanctuary (8:5), \"heavenly things\" (9:23), heavenly homeland (11:16), and \"heavenly Jerusalem\" (12:22).\nThe rest may be compared with \"the promised eternal inheritance\" (9:15; see 6:12; 10:36) or salvation (1:14; see 9:28). It is an entrance into glory (2:10) or into \"the inner sanctuary behind the curtain\" (6:19), where Jesus has already entered as our forerunner (6:20) and champion (2:9-10; 12:2). The rest fulfilled in the unshakable kingdom (12:28), that \"enduring city\" (13:14) with solid foundations, whose \"architect and builder is God\" (11:10).

For, \"Yet a little while, and the coming one will come and will not delay; but my righteous one shall live by faith, and if he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him.\" But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and preserve their souls. (ESV)\n<blockquote>\nThe preacher presents another set of reasons ('''For''' \u2026) why the community must \"persevere\" (v. 36) in a composite biblical quotation. The quotation supplies further scriptural support for the eschatological urgency punctuating the transitional section (10:25, 27, 30\u201331, 34, 35, 36). \"The Day\" is fast approaching (10:25) because Christ is coming soon (10:37). The quote also introduces the topic of living by faith (v. 38a), illustrated at length in ch. 11. The introductory line, '''in just a very little while''', comes from Isa 26:20. Its original context accounts for the distinctly eschatological resonance of the phrase: the promise of resurrection (Isa 26:19), the gracious opportunity given to God's people to hide from divine wrath (26:20\u201321), and the broader themes of God's righteous judgment and salvation (26:1\u201318). The phrase fits perfectly with the following quote from Hab 2:3b\u20134 (Heb 10:37b\u201338). It reinforces the promise that the Coming One '''will come and will not delay''' (v. 37b). The author adapts the text from Habakkuk in several ways in order to drive home his points. ... First, he cements the messianic interpretation of the passage (already present in the LXX) by adding ''the'' to the word for '''coming''': ''ho erchomenos'', '''He who is coming''' or \"the Coming One\" (ESV, HCSB, NLT, RSV). This leaves no doubt that the prophecy in Habakkuk concerns Christ's second coming. Second, he transposes the two clauses in Hab 2:4 (LXX) and adds an adversative '''and''' ... between them. So in Hebrews the subject of the phrase '''if he shrinks back''' is not the coming deliverer (as in the LXX) but is '''my righteous one''' (i.e., the person of faith). The inversion sets up two contrasting courses of action for believers: living by faith or shrinking back. Third, he alters the LXX by attaching '''my''' to '''righteous one''' instead of '''faith'''. This (along with the inversion of clauses noted above) unambiguously identifies the '''righteous one''' as the believer. It switches the focus from God's faithfulness (as in the LXX) to the imperative for God's righteous people to live '''by faith'''. Hebrews embraces the assurance found in God's faithfulness (Heb 6:13\u201320; 10:23). But here the emphasis is upon the responsibility of God's people to live in accord with divine faithfulness\u2014'''by faith'''. ... The preacher sets an encouraging pastoral tone in his application of the Habakkuk text (v. 39). He does this by using the first person plural we (''h\u0113meis''; 10:19\u201325; 12:1). Providing reassurance on the heels of a strong warning about divine judgment is an effective method of exhortation he has used before (6:9 and 10:32\u201334). In effect, our author invites his audience to acknowledge with him that '''we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed'''. To '''shrink back''' (''hypostol\u0113s'') is to be timid (BDAG, 1041). It is the opposite of having \"confidence\" (10:19, 35), but it also plays phonetically with another antonym, '''endurance''' (''hypomon\u0113s'' [10:36]). Fortitude is necessary, because slinking away from God's people (10:25) and abandoning one's confession (10:23) inevitably lead to '''destruction''' (''ap\u014dleian''). This is connected with the \"eternal judgment\" (6:2), described as the dreadful and fiery execution of divine justice (6:8; 10:27, 30\u201331; 12:26\u201329). It is falling under God's curse (6:8) and displeasure (10:38), rather than doing what is pleasing to God by aligning one's actions with his will (10:36; 13:21). The readers must count themselves among '''those who believe''' (''piste\u014ds'') or \"those who have faith\" (ESV, HCSB, NASB, NET, NRSV). '''Faith''' is directly opposed to '''shrink'''ing '''back'''. Lack of faith characterized the apostasy of the wilderness generation (3:12, 19; 4:2) and led to their destruction (3:16\u201318; 4:11). Readers must instead follow the example of those who through faith and perseverance inherit God's promise (6:12; 10:36). '''Faith''' is here more than a mental assent to the truth or a mere profession of one's belief. It entails drawing near to God in \"absolute trust\" (10:22 NAB) and \"confidence\" (10:19, 35). It means holding on to the confession of hope (10:23) and committing oneself to the Christian community and its vital practices of love and well-doing (10:24\u201325). Such ''faithfulness'' involves courage and \"perseverance\" (10:32, 36). A long list of people who model this follows in ch. 11. The result of faithfulness is that we '''are saved'''. The expression is literally \"preserving of the soul\" (NASB). ... In the NT it refers to attaining eternal life (Luke 17:33; compare \"receive salvation [''peripoi\u0113sin s\u014dterias''] [1 Thess 5:9]; . ... From the beginning, the preacher has warned his audience not to ignore \"such a great salvation\" (2:3; see 1:14) or the Great High Priest who has procured it (2:10; 5:9; 9:28). Now, as earlier, though he must warn them about the dire consequences of apostasy, he is convinced \"of better things\" in their case\u2014\"things that accompany salvation\" (6:9).<ref> Kevin Anderson, ''Hebrews: A Commentary in the Wesleyan Tradition'', [Kansas City: Beacon Hill Press, 2013], 289\u2013291.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n* '''Hebrews 12:1\u201313''' \u2013 Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God. Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted. In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. And have you forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons? \"My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor be weary when reproved by him. For the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and chastises every son whom he receives.\" It is for discipline that you have to endure. God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline? If you are left without discipline, in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons. Besides this, we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we respected them. Shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live? For they disciplined us for a short time as it seemed best to them, but he disciplines us for our good, that we may share his holiness. For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it. Therefore, lift your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees, and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put out of joint but rather be healed. (ESV)<ref>B. J. Oropeza: Since the believers have so many previous examples of faith who stand as a cluster of spectators or \"cloud of witnesses,\" they are encouraged to run their metaphoric footrace of life with endurance (Heb 12:1; cf. ch. 11; 1 Cor 9:24\u201327). Hebrews uses the imagery of a footrace as one more example of God's people \"moving\" towards the goal of eschatological completion, similar to the wilderness generation journeying to the place of \"rest\" (Heb 3\u20134). The race metaphor, in any case, eventually breaks down when we realize that our author is not concerned about who gets first prize but just that all the contestants run until reaching the finish line. Once that has been achieved, the location is transformed from a stadium to the heavenly Jerusalem (12:22). Hence, the footrace concerns the participants' endurance, and apostasy would seem to be the outcome for those who do not finish the race. The runners are to mimic the attitude of the faithful champions who are now watching them in the stadium as the runners participate in the contest. In this race they must not return once they have gone out (cf. 11:15\u201316a). If they continue the race God will not be ashamed of them but will grant them entrance into the heavenly city (cf. Heb 11:16b; contrast Mark 8:38). ''The point for our author is not that some in the congregation will not start the race, but that some will not finish it''. To run this race appropriately they should lay aside every impediment and easily obstructing sin, similar to a runner who loses excess body weight and sets aside heavy clothes or anything else that would hinder the athlete's speed (cf. Philostratus, ''Gymnasticus'' 48; Philo, ''Sacrifices'' 63). The sin is unspecified, and some exegetes surmise it as the sin of apostasy (cf. Heb 3:13; 10:26). The closest prior mention of sin is in 11:25, which speaks of Moses choosing mistreatment with God's people over the temporary pleasures of sin. That sin also has been understood as apostasy. But its connection with pleasure (\u1f00\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2/cf. \u1f00\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1\u03cd\u03c9), when used in a negative sense, often refers to enticements related to forbidden foods and sensual vices, and this comes close to the meaning of sin in 12:16. The imagery of laying aside excess impediments in 12:1 is something normally done before the race starts, which tend to make the \"sin\" relevant to pre-conversion impediments that would hinder the participants during their new course of life if they are not discarded. The sin in 12:1 therefore refers to pre-converted sins or sin in general (cf. 9:26). It is not referring to apostasy per se. Interestingly, disrobing before baptism was practiced in Christian circles in the second century, and a similar practice may be operating in Asia Minor in the first century, which uses the same word in 12:1 (\u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03af\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9) to describe disrobing. In any event, post-baptismal sins could always resemble pre-baptismal ones that do lead to apostasy, and sin would seem to ensnare easily any runner (cf. 12:1, 14\u201316). As runners focus their eyes down the track at a person \"seated in the place of honor,\" so the believers are to keep their eyes on Jesus. He has already run the race of faith and finished his course having endured great suffering to the shedding of blood, something the believers have not yet experienced (12:2\u20134). Jesus is thus the ultimate exemplar of faithfulness as well as the object of faith for the runners. He endured crucifixion and despised \"shame,\" affirming the societal honor system and public opinion as unreliable regarding its evaluation of crucifixion as dishonorable. Our author deems Jesus' death to be noble, voluntarily allowed in obedience to God, dedicated to virtue, and for the benefit of others (cf. 2:9\u201310, 14f; 4:14\u201316; 5:7\u201310; chs. 7\u201310). By setting their eyes on Jesus and his accomplishment on the cross, the believers will be encouraged not to grow fatigued and \"give up\" on the race (\u1f10\u03ba\u03bb\u03cd\u03c9: 12:3, 5). The believers, as good athletes, are to endure \"discipline\" (\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1), rigorous training conducive for running a good race (12:5\u201311). The author reconfigures the idea of \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 from a loving yet punitive and correcting discipline the LORD gives to children in Prov 3:11\u201312 to a non-punitive discipline in Heb 12. The discipline and suffering the believers experience, in other words, are not the result of divine punishment. Rather, the training and suffering fosters virtuous living with the special qualities of holiness and righteousness (12:10\u201311). Children who are without this training from the Father, something all God's children participate in, are \"illegitimate and not sons\" (Heb 12:8; cf. Wis 4:3). These words do not accuse some of the audience as false believers. The author gives us no clear indication of such a problem within this community. The homily suggests instead that the members have in fact experienced suffering and are currently enduring the struggle of salvation, and this is why he encourages them to press on\u2014they are legitimate children belonging to Christ (Heb 2:13; 3:1; cf. 10:32\u201334). Their training and suffering should be considered as badges of honor; being illegitimate is a mark of dishonor. The argument probably aims to counter their supposing that discipline and suffering brings shame. David deSilva rightly argues in 12:8: \"The author thus makes the experience of reproach and loss suffered for the sake of Christ a sign of favor and honor, and, more astounding, the lack of such hardship a sign of disfavor and dishonor! Those who shrink back so as to avoid these experiences find themselves shamed because they no longer experience what all children of God share in common.\" Moreover, ''the thought of illegitimacy also stresses the reality of a person being denied the right of inheritance as a legal child'' (cf. Gen 21:10; 25:5\u20136; Gal 4:30). In this homily such an inheritance ends with everlasting salvation (Heb 1:14; 6:12; 9:15; 11:8), and ''if one is without discipline, one could anticipate a fate similar to Esau who sold his birthright and lost his rightful inheritance'' (Heb 12:16\u201317; cf. v. 23). Esau's profane act nullified his rightful privileges as the firstborn son; and if the believers fall away from their spiritual footrace they will become illegitimate children by losing their place in the family of God and Christ (cf. 2:13b; 3:1, 6; 12:23). The imagery turns to a fatigued or crippled runner who needs reviving so as to continue advancing: \"Therefore strengthen your drooping hands and your feeble knees and make straight paths for your feet so that what is crippled may not be dislocated [\u1f10\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03ad\u03c0\u03c9] but rather be healed\" (Heb 12:12\u201313/Prov 4:26). In this passage \u1f10\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03ad\u03c0\u03c9 is sometimes interpreted as a turning aside from the course, suggesting apostasy. Or it may have a medical meaning, referring to the dislocation of a joint. A dislocation would cause the runner to fall or not be able to continue the race, so in either case it seems that the runner would not be able to make it to the finish line. Thus committing apostasy is implied as a negative outcome of what might happen if the runner is not healed and strengthened once again. The author's exhortation intends to bring about the audience's strengthening and renewing; the congregants are presumed to be spiritually fatigued and about to give up the metaphoric race that leads to eternal inheritance. (''Churches Under Siege of Persecution and Assimilation: The General Epistles and Revelation'', Apostasy in the New Testament Communities, Volume 3:57\u201360).</ref>\n* '''Hebrews 12:14\u201317''' \u2013 Make every effort to live in peace with everyone and to be holy; without holiness no one will see the Lord. See to it that no one falls short of the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many. See that no one is sexually immoral, or is godless like Esau, who for a single meal sold his inheritance rights as the oldest son. Afterward, as you know, when he wanted to inherit this blessing, he was rejected. Even though he sought the blessing with tears, he could not change what he had done. (NIV)\n<blockquote>\nAs holiness belongs to the essence of God and is his highest glory, so it is to characterize God's people. We were chosen in Christ to be holy (Eph. 1:4), and God disciplines us as his children so \"that we may share in his holiness\" (12:10). ... Lane observes that \"in Hebrews 'pure' and 'holy' are interchangeable terms because those who have been made holy are those for whom Christ has made purification. ... Christians have within their reach the holiness that is indispensable for seeing God\" (1991, 451). Holiness \"is not an optional extra in the Christian life but something which belongs to its essence. It is the pure in heart, and none but they, who shall see God Matt. 5:8). Here [Heb. 12:14], as in v. 10, practical holiness of life is meant\" (Bruce, 1990, 348). Thus 12:14 begins by exhorting believers to earnestly pursue peace and holiness as a way of life. \"Make every effort\" (''dioko'') conveys diligence in the pursuit of peace and holiness. ... Peace is viewed as an objective reality tied to Christ and his redemptive death on the cross, which makes possible harmony and solidarity in Christian community (cf. Col. 1:20). Similarly, \"holiness\" is essential to Christian community (cf. 12:15). Sin divides and defiles the body of Christ, just as cancer does a human body. To pursue holiness suggests a process of sanctification in which our life and manner of living are set apart for God as holy and God-honoring. Verse 14 concludes that \"without holiness no one will see the Lord.\" To \"see\" the Lord and \"know\" him intimately are closely related. To see the Lord \"is the highest and most glorious blessing mortals can enjoy, but the beatific vision is reserved for those who are holy in heart and life\" (Bruce, 1990, 349). Things that are unholy effectively block seeing and knowing God and in the end keep the person from inheriting the kingdom of God (cf. 1 Cor. 6:9\u201310). Believers must be vigilantly watchful over the spiritual well-being of each member of the church. The verb translated \"see to it\" (''episkopeo''; 12:15a) conveys the idea of spiritual oversight and is related to the function of \"overseers\" or elders. This verb is a present active participle with the force of an imperative and carries the sense of \"watching continually.\" Three subordinate clauses of warning follow this verb, each one introduced by the words \"that no one\" (''me tis''): Watch continually\u2014\"that no one misses the grace of God\" (12:15a) \"that no bitter root grows up ...\" (12:15b) \"that no one is sexually immoral or ... godless\" (12:16a). This appeal to spiritual watchfulness is a call to the church as a whole. The exhortation \"see to it that no one misses the grace of God\" (12:15a) is a key statement. Remaining steadfast in faith (10:19\u201311:40), enduring discipline as children (12:1\u201313), and pursuing peace and holiness (12:14) are all related to the grace of God, as is everything involving our salvation. If entrance into the Christian life is by the grace of God, even so the continuance and completion of it is by the grace of God. The dreadful possibility of missing God's grace is not because his grace is inaccessible, but because some may choose not to avail themselves of it. For this reason it is possible for a person (though once a believer) not to reach the goal that is attainable only by his grace operating through faith (cf. 3:12; Bruce, 1990, 349). Marshall makes several observations concerning this warning passage (1969, 149\u201351). (1) It is possible for a believer to draw back from the grace of God (12:15a; cf. 2 Cor. 6:1; Gal. 5:4). The context of the warning here, as elsewhere in Hebrews (e.g., Heb. 2:1\u20134; 6:4\u20138; 10:26\u201331), indicates that a true believer is meant. (2) Where the grace of God is missed, bitterness will take root and potentially defile other members in the church (12:15b). The deadly sins of unbelief and a poisonous root of bitterness function like a fatally contagious disease that can \"defile many\" in the community. (3) No one should be \"sexually immoral [''pornos''; lit., fornicator] or ... godless like Esau.\" Esau was a sensual man rather than a spiritual man\u2014entirely earthly-minded rather than heavenly-minded\u2014who traded away \"his inheritance rights as the oldest son\" (12:16b) for the momentary gratification of his physical senses. He represents those who would make the unthinkable exchange of long-range spiritual inheritance (i.e., things hoped for but not yet seen, 11:1) for present tangible and visible benefits, momentary though they be. Afterwards, when Esau realized the foolishness of his choice, he wanted to inherit his blessing but could not since \"he was rejected\" by God (12:17a). Attridge notes that the comment on Esau \"conveys the sharpest warning\" of this passage (1989, 369). Though some have understood verse 17b to mean that Esau could not change Isaac's mind, the more likely sense is that of rejection by God\u2014that is, repentance was not granted by God. \"God did not give Esau the opportunity of changing his mind and gaining what he had forfeited. The author intends his readers to apply this story to themselves and their salvation. Just as Esau was rejected by God, so can they be rejected if they spurn their spiritual birthright\" (Marshall, 1969, 150). Bruce concurs that this example of Esau \"is a reinforcement of the warning given at an earlier stage in the argument, that after apostasy no second repentance is possible\" (1990, 352). Esau's \"tears\" represent regret for having lost his birthright, not repentance for having despised and shown contempt for God's gift of a birthright and for the covenant by which it was secured. This is all immediately applicable to the readers of this book, for Esau represents \"apostate persons who are ready to turn their backs on God and the divine promises, in reckless disregard of the blessings secured by the sacrificial death of Jesus\" (Lane, 1991, 455). In other words, a person may miss the grace of God and the spiritual inheritance of eternal life that he or she might have received. In such cases \"God may not permit ... an opportunity of repentance. Not all sinners go this far; but an apostate may well find that he has stretched the mercy of God to its limit, so that he cannot return\" (Marshall, 1969, 150\u201351).<ref> J. Wesley Adams, \"Hebrews,\" ''Life in the Spirit New Testament Commentary'', 1382\u20131384.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n* '''Hebrews 12:18\u201329''' \u2013 For you have not come to what may be touched, a blazing fire and darkness and gloom and a tempest and the sound of a trumpet and a voice whose words made the hearers beg that no further messages be spoken to them. For they could not endure the order that was given, \"If even a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned.\" Indeed, so terrifying was the sight that Moses said, \"I tremble with fear.\" But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable angels in festal gathering, and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect, and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel. See that you do not refuse him who is speaking. For if they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, much less will we escape if we reject him who warns from heaven. At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, \"Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens.\" This phrase, \"Yet once more,\" indicates the removal of things that are shaken\u2014that is, things that have been made\u2014in order that the things that cannot be shaken may remain. Therefore, let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, and thus let us offer to God acceptable worship, with reverence and awe, for our God is a consuming fire. (ESV)<ref>B. J. Oropeza: In 12:18\u201329 thoughts about divine judgment merge with the finishing line of the runner and the place of \"rest\" for the moving people of God portrayed in the earlier portion of the homily (Heb 3\u20134). The end of the race is met with a festival gathering (\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03ae\u03b3\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2) appropriate for the end of a competition. The scene in Hebrews is primarily eschatological with the believers having arrived in Zion, and the heavenly Jerusalem (12:22). The city is paradoxically yet \"to come\" (13:14; cf. 11:10). In 12:18\u201324 our author seems to be stripping away the curtain that hides the presently unseen reality so that the audience could get a magnificent glimpse or sneak preview of the heavenly city awaiting them at the culmination of the race. The scene depicts a location where the blessings of God's promises are fully realized: the faithful enter into a final state of rest and receive their reward of inheritance.\nIn heavenly Zion, God is the judge, Jesus is enthroned, the firstborn assembly is registered as its citizens, and both angels and perfected \"spirits\" reside there. If our author is primarily fast\u2013forwarding the recipient community's race so that they could see in advance the final scene, then the \"church\" and firstborn in Zion might include the recipients who have persevered. If so, then the \"spirits\" of the righteous ones are probably those who had already died by the time the author presented this homily. This group might be identified as the heroes of faith in chapter 11 (cf. 10:38a) or early Christian leaders and martyrs (cf. 13:7), or both. 11:39\u201340 claims that the people of faith from bygone eras could not be perfected \"without us,\" that is, they could not be completed without believers who presently live in the new covenant era (cf. 7:19; 10:10, 14). This group, it seems, will be perfected when Zion is fully realized to all the firstborn at the end of time. A final comparison from lesser to greater is given in 12:18\u201329. God speaking in the past from Mount Sinai is compared with God speaking in the present from the heavenly city. At Sinai when the old covenant was established Moses trembled exceedingly and the people were terrified at God's voice. Even beasts were to be destroyed if they touched the mountain of divine presence (cf. 12:18\u201321). Fearful as Israel's past experience with the divine presence might have been, the future heavenly Zion is intended to be even more fearful and operates on the new covenant of Jesus with God as judge (12:22\u201324). God's voice shook the earth when his presence was manifest at Sinai, but now a promise remains that at the end of the age God will also shake \"the heaven\" (12:25\u201326). The shaking of heaven and earth resembles apocalyptic imagery and destruction that must take place before the end (Rev 6:12\u201314; 16:18\u201321; 21:1\u20132; 2 Pet 3:5\u20137; Isa 59:3; Joel 2:10\u201311; cf. Isa 33:20). Such shaking communicates the fearful presence and intervention of God (cf. Nah 1:5; Joel 3:16; Isa 13:13; Jer 10:10; Ezek 39:20). ... An echo from Hag 2:6\u20137 (cf. 2:21) is felt here which was originally addressed to Zerubbabel of Judah and \"Jesus the high priest.\" In the prophetic book the day of the Lord was soon approaching, and at that time everything would be affected by it. A shaking would take place horizontally on sea and dry land and vertically on earth and in the heaven. Then all the nations would surrender their treasures and submit to Jerusalem and its temple so that that latter house of God would be greater than the former temple (Hag 2:6\u20139). Our author in Hebrews relates the shaking from Haggai to the final eschatological visitation in which the temporal and unholy things will be removed and only that which is permanent and holy will remain for the coming kingdom of God. The implication for believers seems clear enough. The author essentially warns that if the fearful presence and voice of God from the heavenly city is greater than the theophany at Sinai, then how much greater and terrifying will be the judgment of God on those who reject God's voice in the new covenant era? The author's final warning resembles the first one in Heb 2:1\u20134. The audience is to take heed (\u03b2\u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5) and not to refuse God who now speaks from heaven. The author and the community to whom he writes (\"we\") will not be able to escape the final judgment if they ''turn away'' (\u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03ad\u03c6\u03c9) from the one who warns from heaven (12:25, 29). God is viewed as a consuming fire, a thought that alludes to his judgment against enemies and those who violate his covenant (cf. Deut 4:23\u201324; 9:3; Isa 33:14). Our author has in mind a burning judgment and picture of final destruction akin with early apocalyptic traditions (Isa 66:16, 24; Zeph 1:18; 1 En. 91.9; 4 Ezra 7.38; 2 Bar. 44.15). Put differently, ''if the malaise Christian community that suffers from dullness of hearing commit apostasy by rejecting God's message, then God will consume them with a fiery punishment at the eschaton''. Given that the audience is in the process of inheriting an unshakable kingdom, the appropriate way to worship God, then, is for all believers to show gratitude (Heb 12:28), which is the proper response beneficiaries are to show to the benefactor who gives them a gift. In this case the benefactor is God. They are also to offer service pleasing to God with \"godly fear\" (\u03b5\u1f50\u03bb\u03ac\u03b2\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1) and \"dread\" (\u03b4\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2). Again the author uses fear as a strategy in his warning (4:1; 10:27, 31; 12:21; cf. 11:7). The believers are exhorted to worship God acceptably and not commit apostasy but inherit instead the promised blessing of rest in heavenly Zion.

(ESV)\n<blockquote>\nIt was customary to end such a letter with a summary (James 5:7\u201311), an oath (James 5:12), a health wish (James 5:13\u201318) and a purpose statement (James 5:19\u201320). This verse, then, should be part of the statement of the purpose of the whole letter. That in itself is reason enough to assign it great importance. The condition this verse speaks to is described in James 5:19. A Christian (\"one of you\") has erred. James gives us plenty of illustrations of this in the letter. The errors he addresses are those of partiality and greed, of anger and jealousy. All of them are found within the church. Such error calls for another Christian (\"someone\") to point it out so that the person can repent and be restored (\"bring him back\"). That, of course, is what the entire letter is about, bringing the Christians he addresses back to proper Christian behavior. This is indeed the purpose statement of James. Therefore the sinner in this verse is a Christian who has fallen into sin, such as greed or criticism of others. This Christian brother or sister has erred or gone the wrong way\u2014the text is not talking about an individual sin, however \"serious\" we may consider it, from which the believer quickly repents. As Jesus points out in Matthew 7:13\u201314 . . . there are two ways. The way that leads to life is narrow and difficult, while the one leading to death is broad and easy. Unfortunately there are many ways to get from the narrow to the broad way. This Christian (the sinner) has taken one of them and is observed by another, whom we shall call the rescuer. The question is, Who is saved from death\u2014the sinner or the rescuer? . . . It seems to me that James's message is that the sinner is the one rescued from death by the rescuer's efforts. There are four reasons for this. First, the fact that sins are covered (an adaptation of Proverbs 10:12: \"Love covers all wrongs\") seems to refer to the sinner's sins, not the potential sin of the rescuer. Only the sinner has erred in the context. Second, the word order in the Greek text makes it more likely that it is the sinner who is delivered from death. Third, the very picture of turning a person from his wandering way . . . suggests that it is the error that is putting the individual in danger of death. . . . What, then, is the death that the person is saved from?<ref> Peter Davids, in ''Hard Sayings of the Bible'', 706-707.</ref>\n</blockquote>\nA few commentators suggest that this death refers to \"physical death,\"<ref> ''So'' Zane Hodges, ''James'', 1142, in ''The Grace New Testament Commentary'', Volume 2.</ref> But most commentators see death in James 5:20 as referring to ''spiritual'' or ''eternal death''.<ref> ''So'' Douglas Moo, ''James'', 250; Scot McKnight, ''James'', 458; Grant Osborne, ''James'', 173; Ralph Martin, ''James'', 220; David Nystrom, ''James'', 320; Dan McCartney, ''James'', 264; Peter Davids, ''James'', 126; Paul Harrison, ''James'', 80; Richard Lenski, ''James'', 672; C.

James has already mentioned this in James 1:15: desire gives birth to sin, which results in death. That death is contrasted with the life that God gives (James 1:18). Since death and life are parallel ideas, it is likely that they are not physical but eternal . . . . This parallel, plus the seriousness of the tone in James 5, indicates that it is this sort of death, the ultimate death that sin brings about, which is in view. What James is saying, then, is that a Christian may err from the way of life. When another Christian attempts to rescue him or her, it is not a hopeless action. Such a rescue effort, if successful, will deliver [i.e., ''save'', ''s\u014dz\u014d''] that erring person from eternal death.<ref> Reference works consistently see \"save\" (''s\u014dz\u014d'') here in James 5:20 as referring to being saved from eternal death.

For whoever lacks these qualities is so nearsighted that he is blind, having forgotten that he was cleansed from his former sins. Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to make your calling and election sure, for if you practice these qualities you will never fall. For in this way there will be richly provided for you an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.<ref>Peter Davids: What does the author mean in 2 Peter 1:10 in exhorting us to make our \"calling and election sure\"? ... The passage is certainly calling for moral effort. The call for zeal in the phrase \"be all the more eager [or diligent]\" tips us off to that fact. If that were not enough, this verse comes right after another exhortation to moral living. In 2 Peter 1:5\u20137 we discover a chain of virtues that Christians are strongly encouraged (using a phrase similar to \"be all the more eager\") to develop. Developing them will make us effective and productive in our relationship to Christ, while the failure to develop them means that we are blind and have forgotten the cleansing from past sins that we have experienced. We are not surprised at this encouragement to moral effort, for the false teachers in 2 Peter are false precisely in that they are not living morally (false teaching in 2 Peter and in many other New Testament writings is false because it sets a wrong moral example, not just because it teaches wrong doctrine). They apparently claim to see, but in Peter's eyes they are blind. To make one's \"calling and election sure,\" then, is to guarantee or confirm or ratify (the term has those meanings in various contexts) the calling one has received. The calling, of course, is the calling to Christ referred to in [2 Peter] 1:3. The ideas of calling and election are closely associated. ... The point is that this word pair ... indicates God's action in bringing a person to Christ. This is what needs to be confirmed or ratified by the ethical obedience of the Christian. However, the author is not saying that moral effort can produce election to Christ's kingdom. The calling and election are first (the grace of God appears in [2 Peter] 1:3), just as faith comes first in his list of virtues in 1:5. Everything else is to be a fruit of faith. What Peter does believe is that without moral living one will not enter the kingdom, which is precisely what Paul also believed (1 Cor 6:9\u201310; Gal 5:21). Peter makes his point clear in the second half of the verse. To confirm one's calling is not to \"stumble.\" This term can mean to sin, as in James 2:10, 3:2. But if this were all Peter had in mind, the sentence would be so obvious as to be meaningless: If you live ethically (do these things), you will not sin (fall). Therefore Peter is using the term as it is used in Romans 11:11, to \"fall\" in the sense of \"come to grief\" or \"fall disastrously.\" In Jude 24 a related term refers to God's grace in keeping people from falling in this way, meaning \"leaving the faith.\" The opposite of falling, then, is to \"receive a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ\" (2 Peter 1:11). In other words, the author pictures Christians on a journey begun with the calling and election of God. If they fall on the way, they will never reach the goal of the kingdom (salvation). But if they do not stumble, and instead develop the virtues he has already listed, they will in the end arrive at the kingdom and be warmly welcomed into it. This teaching is important within the context of 2 Peter. As noted above, the false teachers in the church were not living according to Christian standards, yet they were claiming to be elect and on their way to Christ's kingdom. The author is denying this claim. While the whole New Testament witnesses to forgiveness of sin for all who repent, and acknowledges that Christians do sin from time to time, no author in the New Testament, whether Paul or James or Peter or John, believed that a person could be living in disregard of Christian standards and still be \"saved\" (or still inherit the kingdom). (''More Hard Sayings of the New Testament'', [Downers Grove: InterVarsity Press, 1991], 184\u2013186. Richard Bauckham: Through the knowledge of Christ he has given Christians everything necessary for godly life (verse 3); if they exercise the virtues, this knowledge will be fruit... The \"knowledge Jesus Christ,\" received at conversion, came as illumination to those who were blind in their pagan ignorance (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Christians who do not carry through the moral implications of this knowledge have effectively become blind to it again... \"Therefore, my brothers, make all the more effort.\" ... (\"to be zealous, to make an effort\") is a natural word for moral effort (Ephesians 4:3; Hebrews 4:11 ...) and is something of a favorite word in 2 Peter (also 1:15; 3:14)... \"to confirm your call and election.\" ... Christ has called the Christian into his kingdom (v. 3), promising him immortality (v. 4), but an appropriate moral response is required if his final salvation is to be guaranteed... This passage does not mean that moral progress provides the Christian with a subjective assurance of his election (the sense it was given by Luther and Calvin, and especially in seventeenth-century Calvinism), but that the ethical fruits of Christian faith are objectively necessary for the attainment of final salvation. Although we should not obscure the variety of New Testament teaching about justification by faith as it is supposed. (1) The author of 2 Peter is concerned with the ethical fruits ''of faith'' (1:5) and with moral effort which is only possible ''through grace'' (1:3: \"his divine power has bestowed on us everything necessary for a godly life\"). (2) Paul can also regard the ethical fruits of faith as necessary for salvation, even in Galatians (5:21), when countering the dangers of libertinism. (3) If our author seems to ''emphasize'' man\u2019s role in salvation, the context should be remembered. His readers were in danger of moral apostasy, under the influence of teachers who evidently held that immorality incurred no danger of judgment... [\"If you do these things, you will never stumble\"] Many commentators think that because this metaphor means \"sin\" in James 2:10; 3:2 it must do so here ... but this makes the sentence virtually tautologous: \"if you lead a virtuous life (or: if you confirm your calling by leading a virtuous life), you will never sin.\" The metaphor must rather be given the same sense as in Jude 24: it refers to the disaster of not reaching final salvation (so Bigg, James, Kelly, Grundmann, Senior)... Verse 11 holds out the prospect of entry into Christ's kingdom for those whose faith is effective in virtuous living. [Bauckham notes on page 192 that: \"In view of the eschatology of chapter 3, the eternal kingdom here is not simply 'heaven,' but looks forward to the cosmic reign of God in righteousness in the new heaven and new earth (3:13)\".] (''Word Biblical Commentary: Jude, 2 Peter'' [Waco: Word Books, 1983], 189\u2013193)</ref>\n* '''2 Peter 2:20\u201322''' \u2013 For if, after escaping the world's corruptions through a full knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus, the Messiah, they are again entangled and conquered by those corruptions, then their last condition is worse than their former one. It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than to know it and turn their backs on the holy commandment that was committed to them. The proverb is true that describes what has happened to them: \"A dog returns to its vomit,\" and \"A pig that is washed goes back to wallow in the mud.\" (ISV)<ref>Robert Picirilli: A preliminary question concerns the identity of the \"they\" in verse 20, who are identified as the apostates: Are these the false teachers, or their intended victims? In view of the fact that Peter will deal with this as an apostasy that has already occurred, I am satisfied that he is identifying the false teachers as the apostates. However, as Bauckham observes, \"The false teachers are in the state of definite apostasy described in verses 20\u201322; their followers are doubtless in severe danger of joining them.\" For our purposes here, however, it makes no difference which group Peter regards as apostates or in danger of apostasy. The main \"movements\" of the passage can be indicated in a relatively simple outline: verses 18, 19 [deals with] the attempts of the false teachers to lure believers astray; verses 20, 21 [deals with] the apostasy which they exemplify; verse 22 [is] an illustrative analogy. The key verses to consider, in discussing apostasy, therefore, are verses 20, 21. Without taking time to analyze everything leading up to them, then, I will proceed to the major questions involved. 1. That these whom Peter regards as apostates had a genuine Christian experience is seen in at least three ways. First, they \"got clean away\" from the pollutions of the world, which recalls 1:4. The aorist ''apophugontes'' (verse 20 and in 1:4) harks back to the time of their conversion. Second, they accomplished this escape \"by the knowledge of the Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\" ... Peter's use of ''epign\u014dsis'' leaves me in no doubt that he uses this compound for knowledge consciously as a way of representing the saving knowledge of Christ one gains at conversion. Third, they \"have come to know the way of righteousness.\" The verb \"have come to know\" is cognate to the noun ''epign\u014dsis'' just referred to, and is used with the same meaning. That it is perfect tense focuses on the state of the knowledge that followed the initiation therein. The \"way of righteousness\" is obviously the same as \"the way of truth\" in verse 2 and \"the straight way\" in verse 15... It would be hard to find a better description of what it means to become a Christian... 2. The apostasy which Peter ascribes to these and warns his readers against is found in two expressions, each standing in sharp contrast to the experience just described. First, they \"have been overcome by being again entangled with these (pollutions).\" And this after their escape from those very pollutions! In light of verse 19b, this being overcome is being re-enslaved. Clearly, these apostates have returned to the practice of the fleshly wickedness that previously defiled them. Nor does the fact that this is introduced with an \"if\" mitigate this conclusion... Even [Simon J.] [[Simon Kistemaker|Kistemaker]], a thorough-going Calvinist, acknowledges that the ones referred to were once \"orthodox Christians\" who \"escaped the world's defilements\"\u2014and then hurries to make these \"orthodox Christians\" orthodox in external profession and lifestyle only. He apparently does not realize how self-contradictory this sounds, or how unlike Peter's more obvious meaning. Second, they have come to the place where they \"turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them.\" And this after having come to know the way of righteousness! The \"holy commandment\" ... [is] \"Christianity as a whole way of life.\" [J. N. D. Kelly] It was \"delivered to them\" when the gospel was preached to them and its implications taught. It is a holy commandment because it sets people apart as God's and teaches them a way of life appropriated for saints. 3. The seriousness of this apostasy Peter indicates in two expressions and a proverb. First, \"the last things have come to be worse for them than the first.\" No doubt Peter is alluding to Jesus' words in Matthew 12:45 and sees that principle fulfilled in the experience of these apostates. They are in worse condition than before they came to the saving knowledge described above. Second, \"it were better for them not to have come to know the way of righteousness.\" This is incredibly startling thing: can anything be worse than never having come to the saving knowledge of the way of the Lord? As Kelly notes, apostates are worse off than unconverted believers \"because they have rejected the light.\" ... An apostate cannot be recovered; a never converted unbeliever can. Third, Peter illustrates with a two-fold proverbial saying (or with two proverbial sayings). That the idea proverbially represented \"has happened\" to the apostates means that the proverbs fit their situation. Like a dog that comes back to lick up the spoiled vomit that sickened him in the first place, like a sow that gets a bath and goes back to the mud from which she had been cleansed, these apostates return to the enslaving, polluting wickedness from which they had been delivered. Those who attempt to mitigate Peter's teaching by suggesting that the real nature of the sow or the dog had not been changed, and that this implies that these apostate false teachers were never regenerated, are pressing the illustration beyond what they are intended to convey. Indeed, the proverbs must be interpreted by the clearer words that precede them and not the other way around. The previous paragraph expresses precisely what the proverbs are intended to convey. In conclusion, it is clear that Peter is describing a real apostasy from genuine Christianity. (''Grace Faith Free Will'', 229\u2013232)</ref>\n* '''2 Peter 3:16\u201317''' \u2013 Some things in them [Paul's letters] are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, leading to their own destruction, as they do the rest of the Scriptures. And so, dear friends, since you already know these things, continually be on your guard not to be carried away by the deception of lawless people. Otherwise, you may fall from your secure position. (ISV)<ref>Gene L. Green: Instead of being faithful to Paul and his presentation of the gospel, the false teachers have distorted his message... These people \"twist\" Paul's teaching, wrenching and distorting it in such a way that the true is tuned into the false (BDAG 948; MM 593). From Paul's own writings we are aware that some in his audience distorted his preaching concerning grace (Rom 3:8), misunderstanding various declarations (e.g., Rom 3:21\u201327; 4:15; 5:20; 8:1; 1 Cor 6:12; Gal 5:13) as support of antinomianism (cf. Jude 4). Others also perverted his teaching regarding eschatological events (2 Thess 2:2\u20133; 2 Tim 2:17\u201318). The Pauline doctrines that the \"ignorant and unstable\" have distorted have to do with precisely these two points (2:19; 3:4). The false teachers and those who follow them do not solely target Paul's teaching. They twist his teaching ... as even the other Scriptures. During Peter's era, the term \"Scriptures\" referred specifically to the divinely inspired writings of the Old Testament (2 Peter 1:20\u201321; Luke 24:27, 32, 45; John 5:39; Rom 1:2; 1 Cor 15:3\u20134; Gal 3:8, 22; 1 Tim 5:18; 2 Tim 3:16; 1 Pet 2:6). But early in the life of the church, the concept of \"Scripture\" was expanded to include the teachings of Jesus (1 Tim 5:18; cf. Matt 10:10; Luke 10:7)... In the final clause, Peter underscores the seriousness of distorting the teaching of the Scriptures, whether that of Paul, Jesus, or the Old Testament. The heretics and those who follow them distort this teaching ... to their own destruction [''ap\u014dleian'']; see the comments at 2:1, 3; 3:7 regarding ''ap\u014dleia''. [At 2 Peter 2:1 Green writes: \"In the New Testament this word refers to final and ultimate destruction of those who oppose God and his purposes (Matt 7:13; Rom 9:22; Phil 1:28; 3:19; Heb 10:39; 2 Peter 3:7; Rev 17:8, 11; BDAG 127; A. Oepke, TDNT 1:396\u2013397; H. C. Hahn NIDNTT 1:462-66). It is, therefore, the opposite of salvation (Phil 1:28; Heb 10:39) and is the result of the execution of God's wrath (Rom 9:22).\"] The result of their error, which includes their embrace of immorality on the basis of their distorted teaching, is condemnation before God. The problem of the false teachers is not that they have poorly understood portions of divine revelation but that they use their twisted interpretation to justify their immorality (e.g., 2:19; 3:3-4). Twisted teaching and twisted practice go hand in hand. Heretical teaching has led to moral decadence. Before the final doxology of the letter, Peter gives his last call that his readers not fall into the error of the false teachers... He exhorts ... Therefore you, beloved, since you know these things beforehand, be on your guard... Since the recipients of this letter have not yet succumbed to the error and since they already have in hand the apostolic argument against the error via this letter as well as the prophetic and apostolic teaching regarding the coming error (3:2-3), they are advised in advance and can guard themselves from heresy... they are to be on their guard against the error of the false teachers lest they succumb to the error (3:17b). ... The apostle recognizes that the best antidote against apostasy is a Christian life that is growing. Therefore, in this the final exhortation ... of the letter, Peter urges ... but grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. ... Increase in 'grace' ... suggests advances in the appropriation or experience of the benefits of salvation (1 Peter 1:10; 3:7; 4:10; 5:5, 12; see 2 Pet 1:2; Jude 4). ... The increase in \"knowledge\" ... is not theoretical but rather personal knowledge ... whose object is 'our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ' (1:1, 11; 2:20; 3:2). Such knowledge, which marked the believers' conversion, also continues and increases throughout the life of the Christian. Along with grace, such knowledge is the strongest antidote against the destructive lures of the false teachers. (''Baker Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament: Jude and Peter'' [Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2008], 340\u2013343).</ref>\n* '''Jude 20\u201321''' \u2013 But you, beloved, building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life. (ESV)<ref>Gene L. Green: As in verse 17, the emphatic \"but you\" places the believers in sharp contrast with the heretics whom Jude has denounced in verse 19. These infiltrators are devoid of the Spirit and are trying to cause a division in the church by their teaching. Jude exhorts the beloved members of the Christian family not to be swayed by their teaching but to build themselves up on the foundation of the faith (v. 20a); pray in the Spirit, which they have as the true people of God (v. 20b); and keep themselves in the love of God (v. 21)... One of the issues that Jude has consistently raised in this epistle is the way the heretics, like their ancient prototypes, did not keep their proper place but crossed the line to participate in things outside their allotted domain. Certain angels did not remain in their proper domain but engaged in illicit relations (v. 6). These violated God's order, as had the exodus generation (v. 5) and the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah (v. 7). The heretics were trying to divert the church down a similar path (v. 4a) by altering the gospel (v. 4b) and persuading members of the congregation to follow their lifestyle (vv. 22\u201323). Jude therefore calls the church both to \"contend for the faith\" (v. 3) and to hold on securely to what they have received (v. 21). Jude previously affirmed that they, as the elect of God, were \"kept\" for Jesus Christ and his return (v. 1 ...). But in the present verse he turns the indicative of their existence into an imperative as he calls them to \"keep\" themselves \"in the love of God.\" ... In the face of the persuasive tactics of the heretics, Jude calls the church to keep themselves \"in the Love of God.\" They should not move away from God but remain faithful. Keeping themselves \"in the love of God\" echoes the thought of verse 1, where Jude identifies the Christians as those who are the beloved of God and kept for Jesus Christ. God's love was the cause of their election, and now Jude exhorts them to stay within this state of grace. This principle imperative is a powerful call to flee from apostasy... Jude adds one final (participial) imperative: ... eagerly await the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life... Jude exhorts the church not only to maintain their faith but also to anxiously await the coming of \"the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ\" (cf. 1 Thess. 1:9\u201310). The vivid hope of the parousia ... is linked with Christian ethics. Jude remains the church of the end so that they may live godly lives in the present... The mercy of the Lord Jesus Christ, shown to them upon his coming, will bring eternal life... The hope of eternal life was linked with the expectation of the coming kingdom of God... While John is able to speak about eternal life as a present possession of the believer (John 3:15\u201316, 36; 5:24; 6:47, 54), this life anticipates the final day with the righteous will be raised (John 6:40, 54). Much of the discussion of eternal life in the New Testament understands it as the future hope of the resurrection (Matt. 19:29; Mark 10:30; Luke 18:30; Rom. 2:7; Titus 1:2; 3:7). This the final act of salvation and, as such, is in contrast with the final judgment and condemnation of the unrighteous (Matt. 25:46; John 3:36; 10:28; 1 John 3:15 ...)... Jude's concern is not simply to inform them about a bright future. His call to await this event also implies that in the hope of eternal life, they should continue to avoid the way of the heretics.

Instead, His anointing teaches you about all things and is true and is not a lie; just as He has taught you, remain in Him. (HCSB)<ref>Daniel R. Streett: The \"leavers\" [i.e., \"Jewish-Christian Apostates\"] of 1 John 2:19 were individuals who participated in the community and confessed that Jesus was the messianic redeemer foretold in the Scriptures. At some point, for reasons unstated in the text, they turned back on their confession of Jesus and on the community, leaving both behind to (most likely) return to the Jewish communities they had been part of prior to their confession of Jesus. ... The readers all know about the nature of the antichrists\u2019 apostasy and they are able to discern between those who are \"of us\" and those who are not. The readers' ability to discern friend from foe comes from their knowledge of the truth, which they already possess (v. 21). The \"truth\" here is nothing other than the basic message (\u1f00\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03b1) disputed by the \u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03c7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 [antichrists\u2019], namely that \u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 \u1f14\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u1f41 \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 [Jesus is the Messiah]. The author emphasizes that the audience knows this, has confessed it, has received God's testimony to it, and therefore has no need to be taught it again by the author or by anyone else (see v. 27). The truth, in the form of the message and confession, forms the foundation of the community's existence as well as the line which divides the community from the world in the eschatological struggle. ... The readers' knowledge of the truth and ability to discern between the truth and a lie comes from their \"anointing,\" which they have \"from the Holy One\" (\u03c7\u03c1\u1fd6\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1 \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f01\u03b3\u03af\u03bf\u03c5). ... From the context, the following characteristics of the \u03c7\u03c1\u1fd6\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1 [anointing] may be noted: 1) Its reception was a past event that has continuing effects (v. 27). 2) It is pictured as teaching the readers the knowledge of the truth and eliminating the need for teaching (vv. 20\u201321, 27). 3) It is probably to be associated with the message the readers \"heard from the beginning,\" and would therefore have been received at the readers' initiation into the community (v. 24). 4) It unites the audience with Jesus, the \"anointed one\" (\u1f41 \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2, v. 22) in a relationship likely characterized as \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 [fellowship] (1:3). 5) It sets the audience in opposition to the \u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03c7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9, or \"anti-anointed-ones.\" 6) The function of the \u03c7\u03c1\u1fd6\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1 is similar to the activity of the Spirit in the rest of the letter. Both prompt confession of Jesus, provide saving knowledge, and unite the recipient to God and his Son (3:24; 4:2, 6, 13; 5:6). While v. 21 establishes a strong antithesis between the Truth, known and confessed by the audience, and the Lie, vv. 22\u201323 specify what these terms are referring to. Both have to do with the central confession of the community that Jesus is the Messiah. In v. 22, the author identifies the \"liar\" (\u03c8\u03b5\u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2) with the \"antichrist\" and specifies his defining mark: the lie or falsehood (\u03c8\u03b5\u1fe6\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2) of the liar is his denial that Jesus is the Messiah. . . . In 2:22b the author elaborates upon the antichrists\u2019 denial. The liars and antichrists deny both the Father and the Son. From 2:23 it is clear that this claim is disputed; the author must argue for it. The antichrists themselves almost certainly would not have admitted to denying the Father. In their mind, they denied only that Jesus is the Christ, God\u2019s Son. The author reasons that the opponents\u2019 denial of the Son logically entails their denial of the Father, since in Johannine theology, it is the Father who has declared Jesus to be the Son and has set his seal upon Jesus, signifying this very fact (John 3:33; cf. 6:27). To deny that Jesus is the Son is therefore to declare the Father a liar (1 John 5:10), and even to \"hate\" the Father (John 15:24). Verse 23 continues this logic: if someone denies the Son, he does not \"have\" the Father either, and vice versa. The language of \"having\" (\u1f14\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd) has been shown by E. Malatesta to derive from Jewish covenantal thinking. The author is thus saying that a proper covenantal relationship with God depends upon acceptance and acknowledgement of his messenger. Verses 22\u201323 provide numerous reasons for believing that the central issue in the antichrist secession was Jesus\u2019 messiahship. If this is the case, then the Johannine Epistles address substantially the same context and set of issues as the Fourth Gospel. The following points are especially significant: First, the confession in 1 John 2:22 that serves as the dividing line between the antichrist secessionists and the anointed believers contains exactly the same wording as the confession in John 20:31. There the author of the Fourth Gospel announces that his purpose in writing is to convince his readers that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God. . . . Thus, the phrase \"to confess/deny the Son\" in 22b\u201323 is a shorthand summary of the lengthier form in 22a: \"to confess/deny that Jesus is the Christ.\" Likewise, the child of God\u2019s most basic confession may be stated in terms of believing that \"Jesus is the Messiah\" (1 John 5:1), and only a few verses later restated in terms of believing that \"Jesus is the Son of God\" (5:5). By shifting from one title to the other the author emphasizes the filial relationship between God and the Messiah and thereby demonstrates that confessing Jesus as the Messiah is a sine qua non for a relationship with God. . . . The dramatic way the confession is presented in 1 John 2:18\u201327 as the crucial issue in the apocalyptic-eschatological struggle between truth and falsehood, believers and antichrists, shows that what is at stake is the community\u2019s most central belief, not a peripheral issue dealing with the details of the hypostatic union. At the heart of the controversy is the very confession that has created and presently defines the community. The very fact that our passage uses the language of confessing and denying (\u1f41\u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03ad\u03c9/\u1f00\u03c1\u03bd\u03ad\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9) suggests that it preserves a fixed traditional formula, a succinct summary of the faith, which one might be required to affirm publicly for membership in the community, or be asked to deny in the context of persecution. In short, the confession is the boundary marker of the Johannine community and its litmus test for teachers. As such, it is unlikely that it would take on a meaning in 1 John different from that which it carried in the Fourth Gospel. ... The argument of 1 John 2:22b\u201323 implies that the \"antichrists\" who deny that Jesus is the Messiah would claim to \"have the Father.\" This would suggest that such \"antichrists\" are Jews who understand themselves to be in a proper relationship with God, despite their rejection of Jesus as Messiah. The same argument is used by Jesus in his dispute with Jews who claim to \"have God\" as their Father (John 8:41). Jesus replies that if they had God as their Father, they would love the one sent by God, namely Jesus (John 8:42; cf. 15:23). By virtue of their rejection of Jesus, they are shown to be \"liars\" (\u03c8\u03b5\u1fe6\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, cf. John 8:44, 55) who have believed the \"lie\" of the Devil. These are the same terms (\u03c8\u03b5\u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2/\u03c8\u03b5\u1fe6\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2) 1 John 2:21\u201322 uses to describe the \"antichrists\" and their denial of Jesus' messiahship. The same type of logic is used frequently throughout the Fourth Gospel to show that the Jewish claim of faithfulness to God is disproved by rejection of Jesus, God\u2019s Son. Thus, Jesus tells the Jews that because they do not acknowledge him, they do not know the Father (John 8:19). Because they do not honor him, they do not honor the Father (5:23). He is the only way to the Father (John 14:6). ... In v. 24, the author urges the audience to do the opposite of the antichrist secessionists. While the antichrists renounced their initial confession and departed from the community, the audience must ensure that the message they heard from the beginning continues to be at the center of its communal existence. [fn. 128 reads here: The third person imperative \u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03ad\u03c4\u03c9 [be remaining] is to be taken as an instruction to the audience to hold onto the message and not to forsake it.] ... If believers maintain their participation in the community, and correlatively maintain the presence of and obedience to the original message in/among themselves, it will ensure their relationship with the Son and the Father, which will in turn ensure that they will remain, or live, forever and not be ashamed at Jesus\u2019 coming.

This is the deceiver and the antichrist. Watch yourselves so you don't lose what we have worked for, but that you may receive a full reward. Anyone who does not remain in Christ's teaching but goes beyond it, does not have God. The one who remains in that teaching, this one has both the Father and the Son. If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your home, and don't say, \"Welcome,\" to him; for the one who says, \"Welcome,\" to him shares in his evil works. (HCSB)<ref>Daniel R. Streett: The material in 2 John that addresses the problem of the secessionists is limited to verses 7\u201311. Much of the material repeats the themes and language of the key passages in 1 John. For example, the apocalyptic rhetoric of \"antichrists\" and \"deceivers\" who have \"gone out into the world\" echoes the warnings of 1 John 2:18\u201327 and 1 John 4:1\u20136, as does the emphasis on the confession of Jesus as the dividing line between friend and foe. ... Verse 7 provides the reason (\u1f45\u03c4\u03b9) the author feels it necessary and helpful to reiterate the centrality of obedient love. Obeying the commandments, loving God, and loving the brothers\u2014all of these take on heightened importance in light of the eschatological events unfolding around the community. If possible, even greater vigilance is needed if the community is going to survive the onslaught of the eschatological deception. ... The \"many deceivers\" are said to \"have gone out into the world\" (\u1f10\u03be\u1fc6\u03bb\u03b8\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd). This is the same language used of the false prophets in 1 John 4:1. While it is possible that \u1f10\u03be\u03ad\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 is being used to describe secession or apostasy, as it was in 1 John 2:19, there is no clear indication in 2 John that the \"deceivers\" have come from the Johannine community. The better parallel, then, is 1 John 4:1, which, as I argued above in Chapter 4, has in view an itinerant ministry. ... This passage, then, is less a warning about enemies within than about predators without. It is stock apocalyptic paraenesis of the type found throughout the NT. As in 1 John 4:2, the defining quality of the deceivers, or \"antichrists\" as they are called at the end of the verse, is their failure to confess \"Jesus Christ coming in the flesh.\"16 Here it will suffice to reiterate briefly what was argued above in Chapter 4: the confession of 2 John 7, like that of 1 John 4:2, has as its focus the messiahship of Jesus who has come \"into the world,\" or come \"in flesh,\" as these passages put it. The focus is not on the mode of Jesus' coming, but on the identity of Jesus as the Messiah. This is suggested both by the grammar of the confession, as well as by the numerous similar early Christian confessions which speak of Jesus or the Messiah coming in flesh without any hint of anti-docetic intent. ... The description of the eschatological opponents in v. 7 flows naturally into the warning in v. 8. In view of the many antichrists and deceivers who have embarked on their Satanically-inspired mission, the audience must \"be on guard.\" If they fall prey to the deception of the antichrists, all previous labor will be for naught. If, however, they are vigilant and repel the antichrists' offensive, they can expect to receive a \"full reward,\" presumably on the eschatological day of reckoning. [In fn. 45, Streett asks: What is \"the nature of the \u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03b8\u03cc\u03c2 [reward]? Does the author have in mind different levels or degrees of reward, so that one\u2019s unfaithfulness would result in a decreased reward? Or, does \u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03b8\u1f78\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bb\u03ae\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2 [full reward] simply refer to salvation itself, conceived of as an \"abundant\" reward? In favor of the latter is the parallel in Ruth 2:12, where the phrase does not appear to carry any connotation of degrees of reward.] This thought is amplified in v. 9, as the author further explains the necessity of holding on to the confession. The first half of the verse describes the person who falls prey to the antichrists\u2019 deception. The antichrists\u2019 message is fundamentally opposed to the basic beliefs of the community, so that to accept their message is by necessity not to remain in the \"teaching of Christ,\" and therefore not to \"have God.\" Conversely, the second half of the verse states, to remain in the teaching of Christ is to \"have\" both the Father and the Son. The same language of \"having\" God and the Son also appeared in 1 John 2:23, where, as I argued, it speaks of being in a proper covenantal relationship with God. There, \"having\" God was conditioned upon confessing the Son. Here, the condition is remaining in the \"teaching of Christ.\" ... The flow of the author\u2019s argument in 2 John 8\u20139 makes it clear that \u1f41 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03ac\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd [the one going forth or departing] refers not to the antichrists and deceivers of v. 7, as most exegetes assume, but rather to members of the audience who might fall under the spell of the deceivers and be led to leave the community. While v. 8 warns the audience against forfeiting their reward, v. 9 provides the reason that following the \"deceivers\" would result in forfeiture: such an action would sever the individual from God and his Son. In these verses, then, the same kind of situation is envisioned as in 1 John 2:18\u201327 and 4:1\u20136. The audience is told of antichrists and false prophets who are on the move, and they are warned not to give heed to them because to do so is to join the eschatological rebellion and to be cut off from the only source of eternal life. The term \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03ac\u03b3\u03c9 [going forth or departing], then must denote a course of action that the author wishes to prevent his audience from taking, much like \u1f00\u03c1\u03bd\u03ad\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 in 1 John 2:23. . . . The author warns that everyone who does not remain \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u1fc7 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b4\u03b1\u03c7\u1fc7 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 [in the teachings of Christ] does not have God. The phrase may be taken either a) as a subjective genitive, referring to the teaching that Christ himself propagated during his earthly ministry, or b) as an objective genitive, referring to the teaching about Christ. ... The context of 2 John 9 also favors the objective reading. Only two verses before, the author has spoken of the confession of Jesus as Messiah as the dividing line between truth and deception. This, then, is the teaching about the Messiah that the author refers to in v. 9. To \"remain\" in the teaching is to maintain one\u2019s confession that the expected Messiah is indeed Jesus. Verse 10 confirms this by warning the audience not to welcome anyone who does not bring this \"teaching\"\u2014an injunction that makes perfect sense in light of the way v. 7 declares anyone who does not confess Jesus\u2019 messiahship to be a \"deceiver\" and \"antichrist.\" Similarly in 1 John 4:2\u20133, the confession of Jesus as Messiah is what distinguishes the true visiting prophet from the false. ... The parallel in 1 John 2:22\u201323 is also illuminating. That passage states that the one who denies that Jesus is the messianic Son, does not \"have\" the Father. In 2 John 9, the condition for \"having\" the Father is remaining in \u1f21 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b4\u03b1\u03c7\u1f74 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 [remaining in the teaching of Christ/Messiah]. Proper confession is thus functionally equivalent to remaining in the teaching. This suggests that the content of the \"teaching\" is the identification of Jesus as the Messiah, the Son of God. ... Having announced the existence of the antichrists\u2019 mission of deception in v. 7, and having warned his audience in vv. 8\u20139 not to give up their promised reward but to maintain faithfulness to the basic teaching of Jesus' messiahship, the author now instructs his audience how to deal with visitors to the congregation. Specifically, these visitors appear to be itinerant teachers or prophets, since v. 10 refers to the teaching they carry. In the synagogue setting, visiting rabbis were often invited to provide a \"word of exhortation,\" and there is no reason to think that the Johannine house churches would not have held to the same custom. The author, however, wants to make sure that his audience does not fall prey to the \"antichrists,\" so he warns his audience to apply the key Christological criterion: does the visitor carry the teaching that Jesus is the Messiah? If so, then he may be welcomed and heeded, but if not he must be spurned and the right hand of fellowship must not be extended to him. In a first-century setting, to welcome him (\u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1ff7 \u03c7\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd) would be to provide him hospitality and support, and thus to participate in his rebellion and to take part in the propagation of the lie. A situation involving visiting teachers is probably also envisioned in 1 John 4:1\u20133, which provides the same criterion for discerning true prophets from false. It is easy to imagine that in a situation where normal Jewish synagogues were not outwardly or visibly differentiated from Jewish-Christian synagogues or \u1f10\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03b9, 2 John\u2019s Jewish-Christian audience might not hesitate to welcome an esteemed scribe or rabbi who was able to teach the Scriptures but did not hold to Jesus\u2019 messiahship. Perhaps, the \"elder\" writes to head off such openness, which could conceivably lead to some of the members abandoning their faith. In good Johannine fashion he holds that the coming of the Messiah has introduced a rift in the Jewish nation, and that those who do not accept Jesus as Messiah are not to be received as brothers and sisters, since they have rejected the Son and therefore the Father. (Streett, ''They Went Out From Us: The Identity of the Opponents in First John'', 338\u2013357). ''So'' Gerard S. Sloyan: The usual phrase, \"having\" God, both the Father and the Son (v. 9), has already occurred in 1 John 2:23 with respect to the Father and 5:12 as regards the Son. It is a stark way of saying that denial of the community's traditional position on Christology will mean loss of the intimate relation with the two that adhering to the tradition ensured. All in all, v. 9 closely resembles 1 John 2:22\u201323 in saying that apostasy from a once held faith stance means loss of the abiding divine presence.

They were not to fear, however, because Christ will reward the faithful with eternal life (\"crown of life\"; cf. 1 Cor 9:25; Jas 1:12). Those so rewarded will escape \"the second death\" (2:11), that is, exclusion from participation in God's final kingdom (cf. 20:6, 14).

They are the faint heartbeats in the nearly dead body of the Sardis church. Apart from their steadfastness and endurance in faith, the church would have been completely lifeless, only a corpse. Since they have not \"soiled their clothes\" (v. 4), they will be allowed to walk with Christ dressed in white robes, the symbol of purity, celebration, and victory. If the others in the church at Sardis heed the warning and repent, they too will become conquerors and will receive the white robe as a sign of their righteousness. Additionally, those who conquer will not have their names removed from the Book of Life, that is, the registry of those who belong to the people of God. The converse of this assurance to the faithful, though not stated, is certainly implied\u2014those who are not faithful will have their names expunged from the Book of Life and will lose their place in God's fellowship. This is a sobering wake-up call to those who take their relationship to God for granted. As Wilfrid Harrington has noted, \"While one cannot earn the right to have one's name in this book, one can forfeit it.\" Furthermore, Christ will personally acknowledge and claim as true children of God those who are faithful (cf. Matt 10:32\u201333; Luke 12:8\u20139). (''Smyth and Helwys Bible Commentary: Revelation'', 72) Stanley M. Horton: To all who overcome, who keep on winning victories through Christ, is made the promise of being clothed like the few in Sardis. They will be counted worthy to walk with Christ, their garment having been made \"white in the blood of the Lamb.\" Furthermore, their names will not be blotted out of the Book of Life, and Jesus will confess their names before the Father and before the angels of God. That is, Jesus will confess them as belonging to Him. The plain meaning here is also that those who do not overcome or keep on winning victories for Christ will have their names blotted out of the Book of Life. Some well-meaning Christians today say that this cannot be, because this would make the continuance of our salvation depend on works, a terrible denial of the grace of God. But we must recognize that our overcoming, our winning of victories, is not a matter of our works. The victory that overcomes the world is our faith (1 John 5:4). We have our victory because God gives it to us through Christ (1 Corinthians 15:57). We are saved by grace through faith (Ephesians 2:8). We continue by grace through faith, obedient faith (1 John 1:7; 2:3\u20136). The Greek tenses in 1 John 5:5 indicate continuous, or characteristic, action. That is, the person who keeps on overcoming is the one who keeps on believing with active, trusting, obedient faith. The same sort of continuous, characteristic believing causes one to keep on having the witness in himself (1 John 5:10; Romans 8:16). Because eternal life is Christ's life and is only in Christ, only those who keep on having (or holding to) the Son keep on having eternal life, while those who do not keep having (or holding to) God's Son do not keep on having that life (1 John 5:11\u201312; see also John 3:16; 6:47; the one who keeps believing keeps on having eternal life).

I am coming quickly; hold fast what you have, so that no one will take your crown.\" (NASB)<ref>Homer Hailey: \"Hold fast that which thou hast,\" which is an open door, His Word, a little power, steadfast endurance, and an assuring promise from the Lord. Hold each of these fast; keep hold of what you have. The promise of keeping these safe (v. 10) implies and imposes continuous steadfastness by the saints. \"That no one take thy crown\" (the crown of life, 2:10) away from you. The thought does not concern itself with gain to the taker, but with loss to the loser. The crown may be forfeited by any individual who grows careless, complacent, self-satisfied, overconfident, or who neglects opportunity and duty... To forfeit the crown is to lose eternal life. The doctrine that a redeemed child of God cannot so act as to be lost is here clearly denied. (''Revelation: An Introduction and Commentary'', [Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, 1979], 153). Craig S. Keener writes: Despite Jesus' praises for the Philadelphian Christians' perseverance to this point, however, \"it's not over till it's over.\" They must continue to hold fast what they have (3:11), that is, to continue to keep the message that demands their perseverance (3:10), lest their persecutors seize from them their crown (3:11; cf. 2:25). The \"crown\" is a victor's wreath appropriate to overcomers (see comments on 2:10, where the crown of life contrasts with the second death in 2:11), and losing it means roughly the same as the warning to the preceding church: exclusion from the kingdom (3:5).

(NASB)<ref>Ben Witherington: Scholars have often pondered over the reason for the list in verse 8, but when one remembers that John's audience is Christians under pressure and threat of persecution, cowardice and faithlessness to the Lord, either spiritually or ethically, must be censured... The intended rhetorical effect of this verse was not to castigate the lost or gloat over their demise, but rather to warn the faithful of the dangers of spiritual and moral apostasy. (''Revelation'', New Cambridge Bible Commentary [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003], 256) Grant R. Osborne: The section [21:1\u20138] concludes with a challenge to the readers to recognize the difference between those who are faithful and those who are not, that is, decide whether to be a \"conqueror\" (21:7) or a \"coward\" (21:8)... The first of the [vice] list ... (''deilois'', cowards), is worthy of special consideration. The ... (''de'', but) that connects 21:8 should have its full adversative force and may well especially be contrasting ... (\"the conqueror\") with ... (\"the cowards\"). While the rest of the list describes the unchurched and wicked who were the enemies of Christianity, this first term probably describes those in the church who fail to persevere but give in to the pressures of the world. Whatever one's position concerning the \"eternal security\" issue, these would be those who fit the description of passages like Hebrews 6:4\u20136; 10:26\u201331; James 5:19\u201320; 2 Peter 2:20\u201321; and 1 John 5:16, namely, those in the church who are overcome with sin and leave their \"faith.\" The reader is being asked to make a choice whether to \"overcome\" the pressure of the world and refuse to succumb to it or to be a \"coward\" and surrender to sin. Those who do so will join the unbelieving world in eternal damnation. (''Baker Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament: Revelation'', 739, 741\u201342) Craig Keener: In the context of Revelation, overcoming addresses such varied tests as compromise with the world's values (2:14, 20), dependence on our own strength (3:17), and persecution (2:10); but persecution is the test Revelation particularly emphasizes for the end-time witnesses of Jesus (12:11; 13:7). Jewish texts often speak of inheriting the world to come (21:7), a common figure of speech among early Christians as well (e.g., Matt. 25:34; Rom. 8:17; 1 Cor. 6:9). Here the overcomers inherit \"all this,\" that is, the new and sorrowless world God has prepared for them (21:1\u20136). The promise that God will be his people's God and they will be his people is the most basic component of the ancient covenant formula (Gen. 17:8; Ex. 6;7; 29:45; Lev. 11:45; 22:33; 25:38; 26:12, 45; Num. 15:41; Deut. 29:13). The prophets rehearse the same covenant formula (Jer. 7:23; 11:4; 24:7; 30:22; 31:33; 32:38; Ezek. 11:20; 14:11; 36:28; 37:23, 27; Zech. 8:8). But Revelation slightly adapts it: He will be the overcomer's God, and the overcomer will be his own child (Rev. 21:7)... All these promises culminate, however, in a warning: Those who fail to overcome, who prove disobedient, will be damned (21:8). The NIV's \"their place will be\" is more literally, \"they will have their part [or share] in\"; this is the language of inheritance, a deliberate contrast with the inheritance of the overcomers in 21:7. The \"fiery lake\" is the destination for all who will not inherit the new Jerusalem and the new creation of 21:1\u20136. \"The second death\" (21:8) contrasts with the abolition of death in new Jerusalem (21:4). Those who begin as believers must \"overcome\"; apostates, like those who never professed Christ to begin with, will be lost.

(ESV)<ref>Grant Osborne: As in Deuteronomy [4:2, \"Do not add to what I command you, and do not subtract from it, but keep the commands of the Lord your God that I give you\"], Christ is warning against false teachers who distort the meaning of the prophecies by adding their own teaching to it or removing the meaning God intended. ... The difficulty for us is how to apply this ban. It can hardly restrict differing interpretations regarding the meaning of the book. The key is to apply carefully the meaning of a \"false teacher\" or heretic. ... It refers to someone who uses Revelation to restructure the Christian faith . ... At the same time, the use of ... everyone who hears ... demonstrates that it is directed to every reader. In John's day it was especially meant for the seven churches for whom the visions were intended. For our day it must be directed to every person in the church who \"hears\" this message. ... We are all responsible to make certain that we interpret the book in accordance with the message God intended. For such people Christ provided a severe warning. ... Those who twist the divinely inspired prophecies to their own ends will suffer the consequences that fits their sin: (1) If they \"add\" their own meanings, \"God will add to that person the plagues written in this book.\" ... They will be treated as unbelievers and suffer the punishments to be inflicted on the wicked. (2) If they \"take away\" God's meaning, \"God will take away that person's share in the tree of life.\" This is more extreme, because it means they will suffer the \"second death\" (2:11; 20:6) or the lake of fire. The \"tree of life\" is found in 2:7 and 22:2 and stands for the gift of eternal life. ... Since it is said that God will \"take away\" their \"share,\" scholars often debate whether this implies the apostasy of the believer. ... There is a strong sense of warning against apostasy throughout [the book of Revelation] . . . . Thus, the reader is warned here that distorting God's message in these prophecies is tantamount to apostasy, and the person guilty of it will become an apostate unbeliever in God's eyes.

Daniel Steele, ''Mile-Stone Papers: Doctrinal, Ethical, and Experimental on Christian Progress'', 53\u201365.</ref> Greek scholars and commentators (both Calvinist and non-Calvinist) have noted that Greek present tense verbs generally refer to ''continuous action'', especially present participles.<ref>For extensive documentation of Greek Scholars and commentators (Calvinist and non-Calvinist) who note the significance of the Greek present tense verb \"believes\" in salvation contexts, please see the following External Links: \"Saving Faith: Is it Simply the Act of a Moment or the Attitude of a Life?\" \"Saving Faith is the Attitude of a Life\u2014the Scholarly Evidence;\" and \"Saving Faith in the Greek New Testament.\"</ref> For example, In his textbook, ''Basics of Biblical Greek Grammar'', Calvinist William D. Mounce writes: \"The present participle is built on the present tense stem of the verb. It describes a continuous action. It will often be difficult to carry this 'on-going' nuance into your translation, but this must be the foremost consideration in your mind.\"<ref>William Mounce, ''Basics of Biblical Greek Grammar'', 246.</ref> Calvinist Daniel Wallace brings out this \"on-going\" nuance for the present participle \"believes\" in John 3:16, \"Everyone who [continually] believes in him should not perish. ... In this Gospel, there seems to be a qualitative distinction between the ongoing act of believing and the simple fact of believing.\"<ref>Daniel Wallace, ''Greek Grammar Beyond the Basics: An Exegetical Syntax of the New Testament'', 522, brackets are from Wallace.</ref> He argues for this understanding not simply because ''believes'' is in the present tense, \"but to the use of the present participle of \u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03c9\u03bd [''pisteu\u014dn'', believing], especially in soteriological [i.e., salvation] contexts in the NT.\"<ref>Wallace, ''Greek Grammar'', 620\u2013621.</ref> Wallace goes on to elaborate,\n<blockquote>\nThe aspectual force of the present [participle] \u1f41 \u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03c9\u03bd [the one believing] seems to be in contrast with [the aorist participle] \u1f41 \u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03c3\u03b1\u03c2 [the one having believed]. ... The present [participle for the one believing] occurs six times as often (43 times) [in comparison to the aorist], most often in soteriological contexts (cf. John 1:12; 3:15, 16, 18; 3:36; 6:35, 47, 64; 7:38; 11:25; 12:46; Acts 2:44; 10:43; 13:39; Rom 1:16; 3:22; 4:11, 24; 9:33; 10:4, 11; 1 Cor 1:21; 1 Cor 14:22 [bis]; Gal 3:22; Eph 1:19; 1 Thess 1:7; 2:10, 13; 1 Pet 2:6, 7; 1 John 5:1, 5, 10, 13). Thus, it seems that since the aorist participle was a live option to describe a \"believer,\" it is unlikely that when the present was used, it was aspectually flat. The present was the tense of choice most likely because the New Testament writers by and large saw continual belief as a necessary condition of salvation. Along these lines, it seems significant that the promise of salvation is almost always given to \u1f41 \u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03c9\u03bd [the one believing] (cf. several of the above cited texts), almost never to \u1f41 \u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03c3\u03b1\u03c2 [the one having believed] (apart from Mark 16:16, John 7:39 and Heb 4:3 come the closest . . .).<ref>Wallace, ''Greek Grammar'', 621, fn. 22.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nArminian Greek scholar J.

[Thus, the one believing shall] keep on having life\" (''Words from the Word'', \"John 3:16,\" 70).</ref> It is this type of evidence which leads Arminians to conclude that \"''eternal security is firmly promised to 'the one believing'\u2014the person who continues to believe in Christ\u2014but not to \"the one having believed,\"\u2014the person who has merely exercised one single act of faith some time in the past.''\"<ref>Greenlee, ''Words from the Word'', 52. Similarily, Purkiser says, \"True security rests in the fact that saving faith is not a single historical act, but a present-tense, up-to-date, continuing process\" (''Security: The False and the True'', 32\u201333).</ref> Indeed, \"Just as ''becoming'' saved is conditioned upon faith, ''staying'' saved is conditioned upon continuing to believe.\"<ref>Cottrell (''The College Press NIV Commentary: Romans'', 2:260).</ref>\n\n===Scriptures that appear to contradict conditional security===\nThose who hold to perseverance of the saints cite a number of verses to support their view. The following are some of the most commonly cited:\n* '''John 5:24''' \u2013 Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life. (ESV)\n* '''John 6:35, 37\u201340''' \u2013 Jesus said to them, \"I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst. . . . All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out. For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me. And this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up on the last day. For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day. (ESV)\n* '''John 10:27\u201329''' \u2013 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand. (ESV)\n* '''John 17:12''' \u2013 While I was with them, I kept them in your name, which you have given me. I have guarded them, and not one of them has been lost except the son of destruction, that the Scripture might be fulfilled. (ESV)\n* '''Romans 8:1''' \u2013 There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. (ESV)\n* '''Romans 8:35, 37\u201339''' \u2013 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? ... No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord. (ESV)\n* '''1 Corinthians 1:8\u20139''' \u2013 [God] who will sustain you to the end, guiltless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. (ESV)\n* '''1 Corinthians 10:13''' \u2013 No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it. (ESV)\n* '''Ephesians 1:13\u201314''' \u2013 In him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it, to the praise of his glory. (ESV)\n* '''Philippians 1:6''' \u2013 And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ. (ESV)\n* '''2 Timothy 4:18''' \u2013 The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed and bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen. (ESV)\n* '''Hebrews 7:25''' \u2013 Therefore, He is able also to save forever those who draw near to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them. (NASB)\n* '''1 Peter 1:5''' \u2013 ... who are protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. (NASB)\n* '''1 John 3:9''' \u2013 No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God's seed remains in him; he cannot go on sinning, because he has been born of God. (NIV)\n* '''Jude 24\u201325''' \u2013 To him who is able to keep you from falling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy\u2014to the only God our Savior be glory, majesty, power and authority, through Jesus Christ our Lord, before all ages, now and forevermore! Amen.

An accurate example of a Calvinist definition of apostasy is provided by Bruce Demarest and Keith Matthews: \"Apostasy constitutes a serious turning away and repudiation of core Christian beliefs and practices. The Greek verb, ''aphist\u0113mi'' (Luke 8:13; 1 Timothy 4:1; Hebrews 3:12) means 'to fall away' or 'become apostate.' An apostate [i.e., an unbeliever] is a professing Christian who renounces Christian faith previously held [in profession only] and who often opposes and assaults the faith. Someone [i.e., an unbeliever] who professes Christianity but who then turns aside from the faith [he or she professed but never actually embraced by faith] commits apostasy, or in the words of Jesus, commits 'blasphemy against the Spirit' (Matthew 12:31). An apostate (unbeliever) can\u2019t be said to fall from grace because he never was truly in a state of grace [i.e., they were never saved to begin with].\" (Demarest and Matthews, ''The Dictionary of Everyday Theology and Culture'', [NavPress, 2010], 15).\n</ref> As noted earlier, Arminians understand that apostasy refers to a believer who has departed from a genuine saving relationship with God by developing \"an evil, unbelieving heart.\" (Hebrews 3:12)\n\nIn traditional Calvinism the doctrine of the [[perseverance of the saints]] \"does not stand alone but is a necessary part of the Calvinistic system of theology.\"<ref>Boettner, ''The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination'', 104.</ref> The Calvinist doctrines of Unconditional Election and Irresistible Grace \"logically imply the certain salvation of those who receive these blessings.\"<ref>Boettner, ''The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination'', 104.</ref> If God has eternally and unconditionally elected (chosen) some men to eternal life, and if His Spirit irresistibly applies to them the benefits of salvation, then the inescapable conclusion is that these persons will be saved forever.<ref>Boettner, ''The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination'', 104.</ref> Arminians acknowledge that the Calvinistic system is logically consistent if certain presuppositions are true, but they do not agree with these presuppositions, which include the Calvinist doctrines of unconditional election and irresistible grace.<ref>Ashby, \"Reformed Arminianism,\" 155\u2013156.</ref>\n\n===Traditional Calvinists agree with Arminians on the need for persevering in faith===\nBaptist scholar James Leo Garrett says it is important for people recognize that traditional Calvinist and Arminians \"do not differ as to whether continuing faith in Jesus Christ will be necessary for final or eschatological salvation. Both agree that it is so. Rather, they differ as to whether all Christians or all true believers ''will'' continue in faith to the end.\"<ref>Garrett, ''Systematic Theology: Biblical, Historical, and Theological'', Volume 2, 430.</ref> For example, Anthony Hoekema, longtime Professor of Calvin Theological Seminary, stated: \"Peter puts it vividly: We are kept by the power of God ''through faith'' [1 Peter 1:5]\u2014a living faith, which expresses itself through love (Galatians 5:6). In other words, we may never simply rest on the comfort of God's preservation apart from the continuing exercise of faith.\"<ref>''Saved by Grace'', 244. Hoekema goes on to write: \"As we have noted, the Bible teaches that God does not preserve us apart from our watchfulness, prayer, and persevering faith\" (''Saved by Grace'', 245). Traditional Calvinist John Murray said: \"Let us appreciate the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints and recognize that we may entertain the faith of our security in Christ only as we persevere in faith and holiness to the end\" (''Redemption Accomplished and Applied'', 155).</ref> Hoekema even writes that he agrees with Arminian writer Robert Shank when he says,\n\n<blockquote>\nThere is no warrant in the New Testament for that strange at-ease-in-Zion definition of perseverance which assures Christians that perseverance is inevitable and relieves them of the necessity of deliberately persevering in faith, encouraging them to place confidence in some past act or experience.<ref>''Saved by Grace'', 245.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nReformed Presbyterian James Denney stated:\n<blockquote>\nAnd there is nothing superficial in what the New Testament calls faith . . . it is [man's] absolute committal of himself for ever to the sin-bearing love of God for salvation. It is not simply the act of an instant, ''it is the attitude of a life''; it is the one right thing at the moment when a man abandons himself to Christ, and it is the one thing which keeps him right with God for ever. . . . Grace is the attitude of God to man which is revealed and made sure in Christ, and the only way in which it becomes effective in us for new life is when it wins [from] us the response of faith. And just as grace is the whole attitude of God in Christ to sinful men, so faith is the whole attitude of the sinful soul as it surrenders itself to that grace. Whether we call it the life of the justified, or the life of the reconciled, or the life of the regenerate, or the life of grace or of love, the new life is the life of faith and nothing else. To maintain the original attitude of welcoming God's love as it is revealed in Christ bearing our sins\u2014not only to trust it, but ''to go on trusting''\u2014not merely to believe in it as a mode of transition from the old to the new, but ''to keep on believing''\u2014to say with every breath we draw, \"Thou, O Christ, art all I want; more than all in Thee I find\"\u2014is not a part of the Christian life, but the whole of it.<ref>''The Christian Doctrine of Reconciliation'', 291, 301-302, emphasis added.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Free Grace or non-traditional Calvinist view===\nThe non-traditional Calvinist or [[Free Grace theology|Free Grace]] view disagrees with Traditional Calvinists and Arminians in holding that saving faith in Christ ''must'' continue in order for a person to remain in their saving relationship with God. For example, Zane Hodges says: \"... We miss the point to insist that true saving faith must necessarily continue. Of course, our faith in Christ should continue. But the claim that it absolutely must ... has no support at all in the Bible\"<ref>Hodges, ''Absolutely Free! A Biblical Reply to Lordship Salvation'', 63. ''So'' Norman Geisler believes that \"Continued belief is not a condition for keeping one's salvation\" (\"Moderate Calvinism,\" ''Four Views on Eternal Security'', 109).</ref> Joseph Dillow writes:\n\n<blockquote>\nEven though Robert Shank would not agree, it is definitely true that saving faith is \"the act of a single moment whereby all the benefits of Christ's life, death, and resurrection suddenly become the irrevocable possession of the individual, per se, despite any and all eventualities.\"<ref>''The Reign of the Servant Kings: A Study of Eternal Security and the Final Significance of Man'', 202.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAny and all eventualities would include apostasy\u2014falling away or walking away from the Christian faith and to \"cease believing.\"<ref>Dillow, ''The Reign of the Servant Kings'', 199. Charles Stanley writes: \"The Bible clearly teaches that God's love for His people is of such magnitude that even those who walk away from the faith have not the slightest chance of slipping from His hand\" (''Eternal Security: Can You Be Sure?'', 74). Stanley also writes, \"To say that our salvation can be taken from us for any reason, whether it be sin or disbelief, is to ignore the plain meaning of this text [Ephesians 2:8\u20139]\" (''Eternal Security'', 81).</ref> What a Christian forfeits when he falls away is not his saving relationship with God but the opportunity to reign with Christ in his coming kingdom.<ref>Dillow, ''The Reign of the Servant Kings'', 202. Based on 2 Timothy 2:11\u201313, Stanley holds that \"The unfaithful believer will not receive a special place in the kingdom of Christ like those who are fortunate enough to be allowed to reign with him. But the unfaithful believer will not lose his salvation. The apostle's meaning is evident. Even if a believer for all practical purposes becomes an unbeliever, his salvation is not in jeopardy\" (''Eternal Security'', 93).</ref>\n\nLewis Sperry Chafer, in his book ''Salvation'', provides a concise summary of the Free Grace position: \"Saving faith is an act: not an attitude. Its work is accomplished when its object has been gained.\"<ref>Chafer, ''Salvation'', 112.</ref>\n\n===Traditional Calvinists agree with Arminians against the Free Grace view===\nTraditional Calvinists and Arminians disagree with the Free Grace view on biblical and theological grounds.<ref>For a Traditional Calvinist critique of Moderate Calvinism as presented by Zane Hodges, see Kim Riddlebarger, \"What is Faith?\" in ''Christ the Lord: The Reformation and Lordship Salvation'', editor Michael Horton (Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, 1992), 81\u2013105. See also John MacArthur, ''The Gospel According to Jesus'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1988, 2008). For an Arminian critique see Ashby, \"Reformed Arminianism,\" 156\u2013167; and Robert E. Picirilli, ''Discipleship: The Expression of Saving Faith'' (Nashville: Randall House Publications, 2013).</ref> For example, Calvinist Tony Lane writes:\n\n<blockquote>The two historic views discussed so far [Traditional Calvinism and Arminianism] are agreed that salvation requires perseverance [in faith]. More recently, however, a third view has emerged [i.e., non-traditional Calvinist or Free Grace], according to which ''all who are converted will be saved regardless of how they then live''. They will be saved even if they immediately renounce their faith and lead a life of debauched atheism. Many people today find this view attractive, but it is blatantly unbiblical. There is much in the New Testament that makes it clear that discipleship is not an optional extra and that remaining faithful is a condition of salvation. The whole letter to the Hebrews focuses on warning Jewish believers not to forsake Christ ''and so lose their salvation''. Also, much of the teaching of Jesus warns against thinking that a profession of faith is of use if it is not backed up by our lives. Apart from being unbiblical, this approach is dangerous, for a number of reasons. It encourages a false complacency, the idea that there can be salvation without discipleship. ... Also it encourages a 'tip and run' approach to evangelism which is concerned only to lead people to make a 'decision', with scant concern about how these 'converts' will subsequently live. This is in marked contrast to the attitude of the apostle Paul, who was deeply concerned about his converts' lifestyle and discipleship. One only needs to read Galatians or 1 Corinthians to see that he did not hold to this recent view. The author of Hebrews was desperately concerned that his readers might lose their salvation by abandoning Christ. ... These three letters make no sense if salvation is guaranteed by one single 'decision for Christ'. This view is pastorally disastrous.<ref>''Exploring Christian Doctrine: A Guide to What Christians Believe'',(Downer's Grove: InterVarsity Press, 2014), 216.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nScot McKnight and J. Rodman Williams represent the opinion of Arminians on this view:\n<blockquote> \"Christians of all sorts tend to agree on this point: to be finally saved, to enter eternally into the presence of God, the new heavens and the new earth, and into the [final eternal] 'rest,' a person needs to persevere. The oddest thing has happened in evangelicalism though. It [i.e., non-traditional Calvinism] has taught ... the idea of 'once saved, always saved' as if perseverance were not needed. This is neither Calvinism nor Arminianism but a strange and unbiblical hybrid of both. ... [Non-traditional Calvinists] have taught that if a person has crossed the threshold by receiving Christ, but then decides to abandon living for him, that person is eternally secure. This is rubbish theology because the New Testament does not hold such cavalier notions of security.\"<ref>McKnight, ''A Long Faithfulness: A Case for Christian Perseverance'', 49.</ref>\n\n\"Any claim to security by virtue of the great salvation we have in Christ without regard to the need for continuing in faith is totally mistaken and possibly tragic in its results. ... A doctrine of 'perseverance of the saints' that does not affirm its occurrence through faith is foreign to Scripture, a serious theological misunderstanding, and a liability to Christian existence.\"<ref>Williams, ''Renewal Theology'', 2:133\u201334. Baptist scholar Dale Moody wrote: \"we dare not teach that believers can lose their . . . [confident faith, Heb 3:14], even become atheists and unbelievers and live like reprobates, and still be eternally secure in their salvation . . .\" (''Apostasy: A Study in the Epistle to the Hebrews and in Baptist History'', 28).</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nHarry Jessop succinctly states the Arminian position: \"Salvation, while in its initial stages made real in the soul through ''an act of faith'', is maintained within the soul by ''a life of faith'', manifested in faithfulness.\"<ref>''That Burning Question of Final Perseverance'', 56. Kenneth Schenck writes: \"All the gifts bestowed on humanity by God entail an obligation to 'keep faith' with the giver. Faith thus involves not only a trust and belief in God as the giver but also faithfulness to him. It is thus possible to 'break faith' with God, which would nullify the relationship\" (''Understanding the Book of Hebrews'', 65).</ref>\n\n==Denominations that affirm the possibility of apostasy==\nThe following [[Christian denomination|denominations]] or groups affirm their belief in the possibility of apostasy in either their articles or statements of faith, or by way of a position paper.\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Anabaptism|Anabaptist Churches]]<ref>See J.

Against this pernicious delusion the following true, immutable, divine threats and severe punishments and admonitions should be often repeated and impressed upon Christians who are justified by faith: 1 Cor. 6:9: Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, etc., shall inherit the kingdom of God. Gal. 5:21; Eph. 5:5: They which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. Rom. 8:13: If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die.

Everts, 1882): \"Arminian churches . . . do not believe that those who are converted will necessarily be [finally] saved. They ground their belief further on the warnings which are given by our Savior and his apostles, in teaching the necessity of watchfulness and prayer, in the warnings against falling away contained in many passages of Scripture, and the express declaration that some had been made 'shipwreck of faith' and had fallen away. . . . The Methodist Churches, being Arminian in theology, totally reject the doctrine of the necessary perseverance of the saints, while at the same time they teach that the prayerful and obedient, while they remain in that condition, can never be separated from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus. They believe it, however, to be necessary to use all diligence to make their 'calling and election sure'\" (\"Perseverance, Final,\" 708\u2013709). Leland Scott, in ''Encyclopedia of World Methodism'', (Nashville: The United Methodist Publishing House, 1974): [John Wesley says] \"Arminians hold, that a true believer may 'make shipwreck of faith and a good conscience;' that he may fall, not only foully, but finally, so as to perish forever.\" (The Question, \"What is an Arminian?\" Answered. 1770). ... [According to Wesley] \"a man may forfeit the free gift of God, either by sins of omission or commission.\" (\"What is an Arminian?\" question 11) How important, therefore, for every believer to beware, \"lest his heart be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin;' ... lest he should sink lower and lower, till he wholly fall away, till he become as salt that hath lost its savor: for if he thus sin willfully, after we have received the experimental 'knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins' ...\" (Sermon on the Mount, IV, i, 8, 1747). ... Perseverance in grace, therefore, was conditioned upon the believer's persevering! Although the believer continued dependent upon atoning, redeeming grace throughout the course of his salvation, nevertheless\u2014for Wesley\u2014such grace (as seen through Scripture) must be considered finally resistible, the Spirit could finally be quenched. Thus the believer is \"saved from the fear, though not from the possibility, of falling away from the grace of God\" (Sermon 1. ii. 4.) (\"Perseverance, Final,\" 1888\u20131889). Mark B. Stokes says: \"Other people say, 'once in grace always in grace.' ... But we United Methodist believe that we are still free to turn away from Christ even while we are Christians. ... The Bible is filled with examples of people who started out well and ended up tragically. ... We experience no state of grace which is beyond the possibility of falling\" (''Major United Methodist Beliefs'', Revised and Enlarged [Nashville: Abingdon Press, 1990], 117\u2013118). '''Article XII\u2014Of Sin After Justification:''' \"Not every sin willingly committed after justification is the sin against the Holy Ghost, and unpardonable. Wherefore, the grant of repentance is not to be denied to such as fall into sin after justification. After we have received the Holy Ghost, we may depart from grace given, and fall into sin, and, by the grace of God, rise again and amend our lives. And therefore they are to be condemned who say they can no more sin as long as they live here; or deny the place of forgiveness to such as truly repent.

After justification, any of us 'may depart from grace given, and fall into sin, and, by the grace of God, rise again and amend our lives.' In this Article there is a plain denial of what some call 'eternal security' or 'once saved, always saved,' which claims that once people have received the saving grace of God, they cannot lose their salvation\" (''Belief Matters: United Methodism's Doctrinal Standards'' [Nashville: Abingdon Press, 2001], 85).</ref>\n** [[Free Methodist Church]]<ref>See \"Does Doctrine Matter?\" By Donald N.

Arminius himself and the original Remonstrants avoided a clear conclusion on this matter. But they raised the question. And the natural implications of the views at the heart of Arminianism, even in its early stages as a formal movement, tended to question whether Calvinism's assumptions of necessary perseverance was truly Biblical. Those tendencies indicated by the questions raised did not take long to reach fruition, and thus Calvinism and Arminianism have come to be traditionally divided on this issue.<ref>''Grace, Faith, Free Will'', 183.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nPrior to the time of the debate between Calvinists and the Arminians at the [[Synod of Dort]] (1618\u20131619), the view in the early church appears to be on the side of conditional security. From his research of the writings of the early church fathers (AD 90\u2013313), patristic scholar David W. Bercot arrived at this conclusion: \"Since the early Christians believed that our continued faith and obedience are necessary for salvation, it naturally follows that they believed that a 'saved' person could still end up being lost.\"<ref>''Will the Real Heretics Please Stand Up: A New Look at Today's Evangelical Church in the Light of Early Christianity'', 65. For quotes that appear to support his conclusions see \"Salvation,\" in ''A Dictionary of Early Christian Beliefs'', edited by David Bercot, 574\u2013585, 586\u2013591. See also the article in the External Links by Calvinist John Jefferson Davis titled: \"The Perseverance of the Saints: A History of the Doctrine,\" ''Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society'' 34:2 (June 1991), 213\u2013228. He covers the key people and groups that have discussed this topic from Augustine (354\u2013430) to 1981. For a helpful overview see B. J. Oropeza's \"Apostasy and Perseverance in Church History\" in ''Paul and Apostasy: Eschatology, Perseverance, and Falling Away in the Corinthian Congregation'', 1\u201333. From his research Oropeza makes three observations concerning apostasy and perseverance in Pre-Reformation Church History. First, there were three basic venues which could lead a Christian to apostatize: theological heresies; vices (i.e., temptations to fall back into pre-conversion practices like idolatry, immorality, etc.); and persecution. Second, those who apostatized were excommunicated from the church. Third, \"the notion of perseverance involved patient endurance through persecutions and temptations\" (''Paul and Apostasy'', 12).</ref>\n\n[[File:James Arminius 3.jpg|175px|thumb|Arminius in his study]]\n\n===Arminius and conditional security===\n[[Jacobus Arminius]] (1560\u20131609) arrived at the same conclusion in his own readings of the early church fathers. In responding to Calvinist William Perkins arguments for the perseverance of the saints, he wrote: \"In reference to the sentiments of the [early church] fathers, you doubtless know that almost all antiquity is of the opinion, that believers can fall away and perish.\"<ref>''Works of Arminius'', 3:438.</ref> On another occasion he notes that such a view was never \"reckoned as a heretical opinion,\" but \"has always had more supporters in the church of Christ, than that which denies its possibility.\"<ref>''Works of Arminius'', 2:472\u2013473.</ref> Arminius' opinion on the subject is clearly communicated in this relatively brief statement:\n\n<blockquote>\nMy sentiments respecting the perseverance of the Saints are, that those persons who have been grafted into Christ by true faith, and have thus been made partakers of his life-giving Spirit, possess sufficient powers [or strength] to fight against Satan, sin, the world and their own flesh, and to gain the victory over these enemies\u2014yet not without the assistance of the grace of the same Holy Spirit. Jesus Christ also by his Spirit assists them in all their temptations, and affords them the ready aid of his hand; and, provided they stand prepared for the battle, implore his help, and be not wanting to themselves, Christ preserves them from falling. So that it is not possible for them, by any of the cunning craftiness or power of Satan, to be either seduced or dragged out of the hands of Christ. But I think it is useful and will be quite necessary in our first convention, [or Synod] to institute a diligent inquiry from the Scriptures, whether it is not possible for some individuals through negligence to desert the commencement of their existence in Christ, to cleave again to the present evil world, to decline from the sound doctrine which was once delivered to them, to lose a good conscience, and to cause Divine grace to be ineffectual. Though I here openly and ingenuously affirm, I never taught that a ''true believer can, either totally or finally fall away from the faith, and perish''; yet I will not conceal, that there are passages of scripture which seem to me to wear this aspect; and those answers to them which I have been permitted to see, are not of such a kind as to approve themselves on all points to my understanding. On the other hand, certain passages are produced for the contrary doctrine [of unconditional perseverance] which are worthy of much consideration.<ref>''Works of Arminius,'' 2:219\u2013220. William Nichols notes: \"Arminius spoke nearly the same modest words when interrogated on this subject in the last Conference which he had with Gomarus [a Calvinist], before the states of Holland, on the 12th of Aug. 1609, only two months prior to his decease\" (''Works of Arminius'', 1:665). Oropeza says, \"Although Arminius denied having taught final apostasy in his ''Declaration of Sentiments'', in the ''Examination of the Treatise of Perkins on the Order and Mode of Predestination'' he writes that a person who is being 'built' into the church of Christ may resist the continuation of this process. Concerning the believers, 'It may suffice to encourage them, if they know that no power or prudence can dislodge them from the rock, unless they of their own will forsake their position.' [''Works of Arminius'', 3:455, cf. 1:667] A believing member of Christ may become slothful, give place to sin, and gradually die altogether, ceasing to be a member. [''Works of Arminius'', 3:458] The covenant of God (Jeremiah 23) 'does not contain in itself an impossibility of defection from God, but a promise of the gift of fear, whereby they shall be hindered from going away from God so long as that shall flourish in their hearts.' If there is any consistency in Arminius' position, he did not seem to deny the possibility of falling away\" (''Paul and Apostasy'', 16).</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nFor Arminius the believer's security is conditional\u2014\"provided they stand prepared for the battle, implore his help, and be not wanting to themselves.\" This complements what Arminius says elsewhere in his writings: \"God resolves to receive into favor those who repent and believe, and to save in Christ, on account of Christ, and through Christ, those who persevere [in faith], but to leave under sin and wrath those who are impenitent and unbelievers, and to condemn them as aliens from Christ.\"<ref>''Works of Arminius'', 2:465; cf. 2:466.</ref> In another place he writes: \"[God] wills that they, who believe and persevere in faith, shall be saved, but that those, who are unbelieving and impenitent, shall remain under condemnation.\"<ref>''Works of Arminius'', 3:412; cf. 3:413.

This is evidenced in the fifth article drafted by its leaders in 1610:\n\n<blockquote>\nThat those who are incorporated into Christ by a true faith, and have thereby become partakers of his life-giving Spirit, have thereby full power to strive against Satan, sin, the world, and their own flesh, and to win the victory; it being well understood that it is ever through the assisting grace of the Holy Ghost; and that Jesus Christ assists them through his Spirit in all temptations, extends to them his hand, and if only they are ready for the conflict, and desire his help, and are not inactive, keeps them from falling, so that they, by not craft or power of Satan, can be misled nor plucked out of Christ's hand, according to the Word of Christ, John 10:28: 'Neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.'  But whether they are capable, through negligence, of forsaking again the first beginnings of their life in Christ, of again returning to this present evil world, of turning away from the holy doctrine which was delivered them, of losing a good conscience, of becoming devoid of grace, that must be more particularly determined out of the Holy Scripture, before we ourselves can teach it with full persuasion of our minds.<ref>Philip Schaff, editor. ''The Creeds of Christendom Volume III: The Evangelical Protestant Creeds'', \"The Articles of the Remonstrants,\" 3:548\u2013549.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSometime between 1610, and the official proceeding of the Synod of Dort (1618), the [[Remonstrants]] became fully persuaded in their minds that the Scriptures taught that a true believer was capable of falling away from faith and perishing eternally as an unbeliever. They formalized their views in \"The Opinion of the Remonstrants\" (1618). Points three and four in the fifth article read:\n\n<blockquote>\nTrue believers can fall from true faith and can fall into such sins as cannot be consistent with true and justifying faith; not only is it possible for this to happen, but it even happens frequently. True believers are able to fall through their own fault into shameful and atrocious deeds, to persevere and to die in them; and therefore finally to fall and to perish.<ref>Peter Y.

Harrison) \"Apostasy,\" Robert Winston Ross [Baker Book House, 1976], 57.</ref> Arminian scholar Robert Shank writes,\n\n<blockquote>\nThe English word ''apostasy'' is derived from the Greek noun, ''apostasia''. Thayer defines ''apostasia'' as 'a falling away, defection, apostasy; in the Bible sc. from the true religion.' The word appears twice in the New Testament (Acts 21:21, 2 Thessalonians 2:3). Its meaning is well illustrated in its use in Acts 21:21, ... \"you are teaching apostasy (defection) from Moses.\" ... A kindred word is the synonym ''apostasion''. Thayer defines ''apostasion'', as used in the Bible, as \"divorce, repudiation.\" He cites {{bibleverse|Matthew|19:7|9}} and {{bibleverse|Mark|10:4|9}}, ... \"a bill of divorce [''apostasion''].\" He also cites [[Matthew 5:31]], ... \"let him give her a bill of divorce [''apostasion''].\" He cites the use of ''apostasion'' by Demosthenes as \"defection, of a freedman from his patron.\" Moulton and Milligan cite the use of [''apostasion''] as a \"bond of relinquishing (of property sold) ... a contract of renunciation ... the renunciation of rights of ownership.\" They also cite the use of ''apostasion'' \"with reference to 'a deed of divorce.'\" The meaning of the [related] verb ''aphist\u0113mi'' ... is, of course, consonant with the meaning of the nouns. It is used transitively in Acts 5:37, ... \"drew away people after him.\" Intransitively, it means to ''depart, go away, desert, withdraw, fall away, become faithless'', etc.<ref>''Life in the Son'', 157-158. Richard A. Muller offers this definition of apostasy (Greek ''apostasia''): \"a willful falling away from, or rebellion against, Christian truth. Apostasy is the rejection of Christ by one who has been a Christian ...\" (''Dictionary of Greek and Latin Theological Terms: Drawn Principally from Protestant Scholastic Theology'', 41). In ''The New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology'', Wolfgang Bauder had this to say on ''aphist\u0113mi'' (Fall, Fall Away): \"Of theological importance is falling away in the religious sense... 1 Timothy 4:1 describes 'falling away from the faith' in the last days in terms of falling into false, heretical beliefs. Luke 8:13 probably refers to apostasy as a result of eschatological temptation. Here are people who have come to believe, who have received the gospel 'with joy.' But under the pressure of persecution and tribulation arising because of the faith, they break off the relationship with God into which they have entered. According to Hebrews 3:12, apostasy consists in an unbelieving and self-willed movement away from God (in contrast to Hebrews 3:14), which must be prevented at all costs. ''aphist\u0113mi'' thus connotes in the passages just mentioned the serious situation of becoming separated from the living God after a previous turning towards him, by falling away from the faith. It is a movement of unbelief and sin, which can also be expressed by other words (cf. the par. to Luke 8:13 in Matthew 13:21; Mark 4:17; [see] Offence, art. ''skandalon''). Expressions equivalent in meaning to the warning in 1 Timothy 4:1 include ''nauage\u014d'', suffer shipwreck, 1:19; ''astoche\u014d'' miss the mark, 1:6; 6:21; 2 Timothy 2:18; cf. also ''aperchomai'', go away, John 6:66; ''apostreph\u014d'', turn away; arneomai, deny; ''metatith\u0113mi'', change, alter; ''m\u0113 menein'', do not abide, John 15:6; [see] art. ''pipt\u014d''; Lead Astray, art. ''plana\u014d''; and the pictures of defection in Matthew 24:9-12, and Revelation 13.\" (3:607\u2013608)</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nI. Howard Marshall notes that ''aphistemi'' \"is used of giving up the faith in Luke 8:13; 1 Timothy 4:1 and Hebrews 3:12, and is used of departure from God in the LXX [i.e., Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament].\"<ref>''Kept by the Power'', 217, note 5; cf. Williams, ''Renewal Theology'', 2:131\u2013135.</ref> Marshall also notes that \"the failure to persist in faith is expressed by [other Greek] words which mean falling away, drifting and stumbling.\"<ref>''Kept by the Power'', 23; These are the other Greek words connected to apostasy: \"[''pipt\u014d''], 'to fall' (Romans 11:11, 22; 14:4; 1 Corinthians 10:12; 13:8; Hebrews 4:11; Revelation 2:5); [''parapipt\u014d''], 'to fall away, transgress' (Hebrews 6:6), [''pararrhe\u014d''], 'to drift away' (Hebrews 2:1); the root [''skandal-''], 'to stumble, offend' is also important\" (Marshall, ''Kept by the Power'', 217, note 4).</ref> Of particular theological significance<ref>I. Howard Marshall, ''Kept by the Power of God: A Study of Perseverance and Falling Away'', 217.</ref> are the verb ''skandaliz\u014d'' (\"fall away from faith\")<ref>Heinz Giesen, ''Exegetical Dictionary of the New Testament'', 3:248.</ref> and the noun ''skandalon'' (\"enticement to unbelief, cause of salvation's loss, seduction\").<ref>Heinz Giesen, ''Exegetical Dictionary of the New Testament'', 3:249. Heinz Giesen writes: In the passive voice \u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b6\u03c9 [''skandaliz\u014d''] more often means ... \"fall away from faith.\" In the interpretation of the parable of the sower (Mark 4:13-20 par. Matt 13:18\u201323) those identified with the seeds sown on rocky ground, i.e., those \"with no root in themselves,\" the inconstant ones, go astray to their own ruin when persecuted on account of the word, i.e., they fall away from faith (Mark 4:17 par. Matt 13:21). The Lukan parallel reads appropriately \u1f00\u03c6\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9 [''aphist\u0113mi'', fall away] (8:13). In Matt 24:10 Jesus predicts that in the end time many will fall away [''skandaliz\u014d'']. The result is that they will hate one another, wickedness will be multiplied, and love will grow cold. Yet whoever endures in love until the end will be saved (vv. 11, 13). ... In the Johannine farewell address (John 16:1) \u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b6\u03c9 [''skandaliz\u014d''] does not only imply an \"endangering of faith\" ... but rather \"falling away from faith\" entirely, from which the disciples and Christians are to be kept. ... In the active voice \u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b6\u03c9 [''skandaliz\u014d''] means \"cause someone to fall away from (or reject) faith,\" as in the saying of Jesus about the person who \"''causes'' one of these little ones who believe in me ''to sin [stumble]''\" (Mark 9:42 par. Matt 18:6/Luke 17:2). The Christian is enjoined to reject anything that might be an obstacle to faith, as emphasized in Mark 9:43, 45, 47 in metaphorical, hyperbolic language: Hand, foot, and eye\u2014in Jewish understanding the loci of lust or sinful desires\u2014must be given up if they threaten to become the cause of loss of faith and thus of salvation. This ... underscores the seriousness of conviction within which one must persevere if one wishes to enter (eternal) life or the kingdom of God. ... Matt 5:29, 30 also issues an exhortation to decisive action [cf. Matt 18:8, 9]. ... According to 1 Cor 8:9 a Christian's freedom regarding eating food offered to idols reaches its limit when it becomes a stumbling block to one's brother (\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1 [''proskomma'']). Hence Paul emphasizes that he will never again eat meat if by doing so he causes his brother to fall and thus to lose salvation (\u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b6\u03c9 [''skandaliz\u014d''], v. 13a, b), since otherwise that weaker brother is destroyed by the knowledge of the \"stronger\" (v. 11). Whoever sins against his brothers sins also against Christ (v. 12). ... Within the context of the protection of the \"little ones\" in the Church, i.e., probably the \"weak ones\" ([Matthew] 18:6\u201310), Jesus utters an eschatological threat (\"woe!\") against the world (alienated from God) because of ''temptations to sin'' (v. 7a); though he allows that such ''temptations'' must come (v. 7b), he finally hurls an eschatological \"woe!\" against the person by whom the ''temptation'' comes (v. 7c). \u03c3\u03ba\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd [''skandalon''] used here of the temptation to fall away from faith. The parallel, Luke 17:1, like Matt 18:7b, also underscores that such temptations are unavoidable; nonetheless, the person by whom they come receives the eschatological \"woe!\" that already places him under divine judgment. ... In Rom 14:13 Paul admonishes the \"strong,\" whose position he fundamentally shares (v. 14), not to cause the \"weak\" any ''stumbling block to faith'' through eating habits . ... In Rom 16:17 the \u03c3\u03ba\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd [''skandalon''] are the various satanic activities of the false teachers who endanger the salvation of Church members, who are being seduced into falling away from correct teaching; such teachers also threaten both the unity and very existence of the Church. Similarly, in Rev 2:14 \u03c3\u03ba\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd [''skandalon''] refers to a ''stumbling block'' to faith in the context of false teaching. According to 1 John 2:10 there is no cause for stumbling or sin in a believer who loves his brother ... i.e., no cause for unbelief and thus a loss of salvation. (Heinz Giesen, ''Exegetical Dictionary of the New Testament'', 3:248-250)</ref>\n\nShank concluded: \"An apostate, according to the New Testament definition, is one who has severed his union with Christ by withdrawing from an actual saving relationship with Him. Apostasy is impossible for men who have not entered into a saving relationship with God... The warnings against succumbing to the ugly peril of apostasy are directed ... to men who obviously are true believers.\"<ref>''Life in the Son'', 158. William Lane comes to identical conclusions in his short commentary on the book of Hebrews. He writes: \"The sin [in Hebrews 6] that the preacher warns his friends to avoid is commonly called 'apostasy.' It is a sin that only a Christian can commit. ''Apostasy consists in a deliberate, planned, intelligent decision to renounce publicly association with Jesus Christ''. It signifies a choice not to believe God, not to listen to God, not to obey God. It is the decision to be disobedient and to deny all that Christ has done for you\" (''Hebrews: A Call to Commitment'' [Peabody: Hendrickson Publishers, 1985], 94).</ref> J. Rodman Williams adds,\n<blockquote>\nOne of the mistakes made by those who affirm the invariable continuance of salvation is the viewing of salvation too much as a \"state.\" From this perspective, to be saved is to enter into \"a state of grace.\" However true it is that one moves into a new realm\u2014whether it is called the kingdom of God, eternal life, or other like expression\u2014the heart of the matter is the establishment of a new relationship with God. Prior to salvation, one was \"without God\" or \"against God,\" cut off from His presence. Now through Jesus Christ reconciliation\u2014\"at-one-ment with God\"\u2014has occurred. Moreover, the Holy Spirit, who becomes present, is not merely some force or energy but God Himself in a new and intimate relationship. Hence, if a person begins to \"drift away,\" it is not from some static condition or \"state\" but ''from a Person''. It is a personal relationship that thereby is betrayed, broken, forfeited; this is the tragic meaning of apostasy. It is not so much giving up something, even so marvellous as salvation, but the forsaking of a Person. Surely through such an action salvation too is forfeited. But the critical matter is the severing of a relationship with the personal God.<ref>''Renewal Theology'', 2:135.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===The dangers of apostasy===\nMarshall finds four biblical dangers that could serve as precursors to committing apostasy:<ref>''Kept by the Power'', 197; see also Arrington, ''Unconditional Eternal Security: Myth or Truth?'' 178\u2013179.</ref>\n\n{{quotation|\n: '''1.

In other words, sin is an act and attitude which is incompatible with the obedience of faith, and hence constitutes a denial of faith.\"\n: '''4. Weariness in Faith''' \u2013 This is where \"the believer gradually drifts away from his faith and passes into a state of apostasy.\"|}}\n\nMarshall concludes: \"The New Testament contains too many warnings about the danger of sin and apostasy for us to be complacent about these possibilities. ...

Arrington, ''Unconditional Eternal Security: Myth or Truth?'' 179.</ref> Methodist scholar Ben Witherington would add: \"The New Testament suggests that one is not eternally secure until one is securely in eternity. Short of that, there is the possibility of apostasy or rebellion against God by one who has believed in Christ. Apostasy, however, is not to be confused with the notion of accidentally or unconsciously \"falling away.\" Apostasy is a conscious, wilful rebellion against God ...

It simply means that the person continues to walk with Jesus and doesn't walk away from him in a resolute manner. ... What it means is continuing trust in God.<ref>''A Long Faithfulness: A Case for Christian Perseverance'', 50-51.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSince Arminians view sin as \"an act and attitude which ... constitutes a denial of faith\",<ref>''Kept by the Power'', 197; Robert Picirilli says, \"Sin persisted in, on the part of a Christian, can lead to a retraction of faith in Christ and thus to apostasy and eternal destruction\" (''1, 2 Corinthians'', Randall House Bible Commentary, 120). Frederick Claybrook, Jr., writes: \"Practicing sin is an act of unbelief\" (''Once Saved, Always Salved? A New Testament Study of Apostasy'', 20). Johannes Bauer says, \"Sin is directly opposed to perseverance (10:36; 12:1f, 7). ... The gravity of sin consists in the fact that it constitutes mistrust and unbelief in God ([Heb] 3:12, 19; 12:25)\" (\"Sin,\" in ''Bauer Encyclopedia of Biblical Theology'', 862).

No hint is given concerning whether the ''skandalon'' (stumbling block) of verse 7 is laid before the humble believers by an outsider or an insider. Presumably both possibilities are in view; a vulnerable Christian can be drawn away by a non-Christian or driven away by a fellow believer. . . . Believers are here warned [in verses 8-9] to exercise proper self-discipline, since the end result of continually yielding to various temptations may well be turning away from Christ.<ref>Douglas Hare, ''Matthew'', [Westminster John Knox Press, 2009], 210-211.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n* '''Matthew 18:10-14''' \u2013 [Jesus is speaking to his disciples] \"Take heed that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that in heaven their angels always see the face of My Father who is in heaven. What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine and go to the mountains to seek the one that is straying? And if he should find it, assuredly, I say to you, he rejoices more over that sheep than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray. Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.\" (NKJV)\n<blockquote>\nHaving warned about sinning against humble believers (v. 6), Jesus next warned against looking down on His little ones, the humble, as if they have no value in God's economy. \"Take heed\" suggests warning and responsibility. \"Despise\" ... means \"to feel contempt for someone or something because it is thought to be bad or without value\" (Louw and Nida 1:763). The more powerful . . . believers must respect Christ's humble servants. ... [I]f God and His angels have such [high] concern for His little ones, all believers should have that same concern for each other (Hagner 33B:527). ... So intent is the Father on locating the one wandering sheep that for a time\u2014and this is the first point of this parable\u2014the one sheep receives more attention and effort than the ninety-nine (Nolland 742). ... This sheep had gone astray\u2014that is, wandered away (Greek ''plana\u014d'') from the rest of the flock. As this applies to believers, this means they can wander off into sin or false belief [cf. 18:6-9]. ... The Shepherd's excitement when he finds the lost sheep shows the high value the shepherd placed on each sheep. ... The second and overarching point of this parable in Matthew is stated in verse 14: God the Father does not\u2014literally, it is not the will of the Father\u2014to lose even one child. The concern is for sheep who yield to sin's temptation and head for apostasy. The possibility of a sheep becoming lost and perishing teaches that believers can be lost and apostatize [i.e., become an unbeliever] ([So] Gundry 365). The possibility of finding the sheep before it perishes teaches that straying little ones can be rescued before they commit apostasy (Jas. 5:19-20). The possibility of apostasy (perish, v. 14) is what motivated the shepherd to \"persistently\" (Hill 274) [search] for the sheep and then to rejoice greatly when the sheep was found.<ref>Jeffrey Crabtree, ''Matthew'', Randall House Publishers, 307-308)</ref>\n</blockquote>\n* '''Matthew 24:9\u201314''' \u2013 [Jesus said to his disciples] \"Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake.

They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you remain only because of faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid! For if God did not spare the natural branches, he certainly will not spare you either. Consider, then, the kindness and severity of God: his severity toward those who fell, but God's kindness toward you\u2014if you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you too will be cut off. (ISV)\n<blockquote>\nverses 20\u201422 involve clearly an emphatic contradiction of the teaching, by Calvin and others, that all who have been justified will ultimately be saved. For Paul assumes throughout that his readers are already justified, are adopted as sons and heirs of God, and possess the Spirit of God as a firstfruit of their inheritance: see chapters 5:9-11; 6:18, 22; 8:2, 15, 16, 23. Yet he solemnly and emphatically warns them that unless they continue in the kindness of God they will be cut off. This last can be no less than the punishment already inflicted on the unbelieving Jews who have been broken off, and who are held up in verse 20, 21 as a warning to the believing Gentiles. For Paul's deep sorrow for the unbelieving Jews proves clearly that in his view they are on the way to the destruction (chapter 2:12) awaiting unrepentant sinners. His warning to Gentiles who now stand by faith implies clearly that unless they continue in faith they will experience a similar fate. We therefore accept the words before us in their simple and full meaning. Although salvation, from the earliest good desire to final victory, is entirely a work of God, a gift of His undeserved favor, and a realisation of His eternal purpose, it is nevertheless, both in its commencement and in its continuance, altogether conditional on man's faith.<ref>Joseph Agar Beet, Obtained from the Wesleyan Heritage Collection CD [Rio: Ages Software Inc., 2002].</ref>\n</blockquote>\n* '''Romans 14:13\u201323''' \u2013 Therefore, let us stop passing judgment on one another. Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in your brother's way. As one who is in the Lord Jesus, I am fully convinced that no food is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for him it is unclean. If your brother is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not by your eating destroy your brother for whom Christ died. Do not allow what you consider good to be spoken of as evil. For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit, because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and approved by men. Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification. Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a man to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble. It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother to fall. So whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the man who does not condemn himself by what he approves. But the man who has doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating is not from faith; and everything that does not come from faith is sin. (NIV, 1984)\n<blockquote>\nThe strong Christian is warned not to place a stumbling block (. . . ''proskomma'') or an obstacle (... ''skandalon'') in a brother's path\u2026. The stumbling in this verse is spiritual \u2026 it refers to stumbling and falling into sin\u2026. It refers to ... a true \"spiritual downfall\" (Moo, 851). The cause for such spiritual stumbling would be an act on the part of the strong brother that is not wrong in itself, but which is perceived as wrong by a weak brother. Such an act becomes a stumbling block when the weak brother observes it and is influenced there by to do the same thing, ''even though in his heart he believes it is wrong'', which is sin (v. 23). In this way the strong brother has inadvertently influenced the weak brother to \"fall into sin and potential spiritual ruin\" (Moo, 852), just by exercising his Christian liberty. The point is that we must be sensitive to how our conduct is affecting others, and we must be willing to forgo perfectly legitimate behavior if it has the potential of causing someone to sin against his conscience\u2026. In v. 13 Paul urges the strong Christian to not put a stumbling block in the way of the weak; here in v. 15 he gives one reason for this, i.e., it is not consistent with love. ... To the one who loves, a weak brother's spiritual well-being is always more important than indulging the right to eat whatever one likes\u2026. [O]ne is not acting in love if his exercise of liberty influences a weak brother to follow his example and thus fall into sin by violating his own conscience. [Paul goes on to write:] '''Do not by your eating destroy your brother for whom Christ died.''' The Greek word for \"destroy\" is ... (''apollymi''), a very strong word \u2026.  Just how serious is this destruction? Is Paul referring to a loss of salvation, and condemnation to hell? \u2026 I must conclude \u2026 that this strong warning does imply that the careless and unloving exercise of Christian liberty can lead to actual loss of salvation for a weak brother. ''Apollymi'' is frequently used in the sense of eternal destruction in hell (e.g., Matt 10:28; Luke 13:3; John 3:16; Rom 2:12). The reference to the fact that Christ died for these weak brethren supports this meaning here. I.e., the destruction in view would negate the very purpose of Christ's death, which is to save them from eternal condemnation\u2026. The verse cannot be reconciled with \"once saved, always saved.\"<ref>Jack Cottrell, ''The College Press NIV Commentary: Romans'', 2:406\u2013408. Cottrell says: \"Stott is correct to point out that a weak Christian's single sin against his conscience does not in itself bring him under eternal punishment (365\u2013366), but here Paul is not referring to a single act of stumbling. He has in mind the ultimate outcome to which a single act of this kind could potentially lead. By violating his conscience the weak brother is weakened even further and could ultimately give up his faith altogether\" (Ibid, 408).</ref>\n </blockquote>\n* '''Romans 16:17\u201320''' \u2013 I urge you, brothers, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned.

While some builders may do a lousy job of building on the foundation and their work will be consumed, some work moves beyond mere shoddiness and becomes destructive.

He has real destruction in mind, and those who destroy God's temple will also be destroyed\u2026. Paul does not describe how the temple is destroyed, but it is undoubtedly relates in some way to their boastful arrogance, their eagerness to appraise others, and their competitive partisanship\u2014all the things that divide Christ... Paul allows the readers to imagine that their petty jealousies (3:3), boasting (1:29; 3:21; 4:7), arrogance (4:6, 18, 19), and quarrels (1:11; 3:3) might qualify for this bleak judgment.

Paul's point in all this it to warn \"the saints,\" \u2026 that if they persist in the same evils as the \"wicked\" they are in the same danger of not inheriting the kingdom. Some theologies have great difficulty with such warnings, implying that they are essentially hypothetical since God's children cannot be \"disinherited.\" But such a theology fails to take seriously the genuine tension of texts like this one. The warning is real; the wicked will not inherit the kingdom\u2026. Paul's concern is that the Corinthians must \"stop deceiving themselves\" or \"allowing themselves to be deceived.\" By persisting in the same behavior as those already destined for judgment they are placing themselves in the very real danger of that same judgment.

But now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation\u2014if you continue in your faith, established and firm, and do not move from the hope held out in the gospel. (NIV)\n<blockquote>\nIn the first half of verse 23 Paul breaks with tradition to address his readers in a more intimate way. His exhortation to them expresses a condition of their reconciliation, which includes both a positive and a negative element. This exhortation has caused problems for those who think of Paul's idea of salvation in terms of God's unconditional grace. However, Paul's understanding of God's salvation is profoundly Jewish and therefore covenantal. The promise of the community's final justification is part of a covenant between God and the \"true\" Israel. Even the idea of God's faithfulness to a promise made is modified by the ideals of a covenantal relationship: God's fulfillment is conditioned upon a particular response. According to Paul's gospel, getting into the faith community, which has covenanted with God for salvation, requires the believer's confidence in the redemptive merit of Christ's death (as defined in vv. 21\u201322). And staying in that community requires the believer to keep the faith. Paul does not teach a \"once saved, always saved\" kind of religion; nor does he understand faith as a \"once for all\" decision for Christ. In fact, apostasy (loss of faith) imperils one's relationship with God and with the community that has covenanted with God for salvation. So he writes that the community's eschatological fitness holds ''if you continue in your faith''... The negative ingredient of the passage envisions the very real possibility that the community may indeed ''[move] from the hope held out in the gospel'', risking God's negative verdict at Christ's parousia.<ref> Robert W.

You know quite well that we were destined for them. In fact, when we were with you, we kept telling you that we would be persecuted. And it turned out that way, as you well know.

(NIV, 1984)\n<blockquote>\nThe possibility of apostasy is expressed in the final part of the verse: ''I was afraid that in some way the tempter might have tempted you and our efforts might have been useless''. ... Paul expresses apprehension, which was rooted in his knowledge of Satanic activity. Although the Thessalonians' contemporaries were driving the persecution forward, the power of the tempter orchestrated this battle for their souls (cf. Eph. 6:11\u201312). ... The temptation of the tempter was ... to commit the sin of apostasy (Luke 8:12; 1 Pet. 5:8), which is implied in this context by the references to their stability and continuance in the faith (3:3, 6, 8). The issue is not moral lapse but continuance in faith. What was at stake was the salvation of the Thessalonians. Paul knew the machination of Satan (2 Cor. 2:11), ''the tempter'', but he was unsure whether he had met success in Thessalonica (''and out efforts might have been useless''). The temptation, while inevitable, was resistible.

Some of the believers will fall away by following the opponents' teachings that have been influenced by anti-god powers (1 Tim 4:1-3). It is affirmed here that more apostasies of those who possessed faith will take place similar to the defections of Hymenaeus and Alexander (1 Tim 1:19; cf. 1:6).

It is true that [''didaskalia'', teaching] does deliver from error and bring to truth, but that seems to be included in the ultimate goal expressed in [''s\u014dz\u014d'', save] (cf. 2:4; so also Oosterzee). The salvation of the hearers is elsewhere depicted by Paul as the central goal of the ministry (cf. especially 1 Cor. 15:1, 2; 9:22; 2 Ti. 2:10; 4:5), and it is that hope in the living God who is the Savior of all believers that Paul has presented as the centerpiece of encouragement for Timothy in this section.\"<ref> Knight, Ibid., 211-212.

For since the message spoken through angels was binding, and every violation and disobedience received its just punishment, how shall we escape if we ignore so great a salvation? This salvation, which was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him. God also testified to it by signs, wonders and various miracles, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will. (NIV)\n<blockquote>\nThis is ... where the author combines urgent exhortation and solemn warning in order to move his readers to a place of renewed confidence, hope, and persevering faith in Christ. ... The close connection between this paragraph [Heb 2:1\u20134] and the exposition in 1:5\u201314 demonstrates that scriptural exposition for our author was not an end in itself but rooted out of his concern for his readers and their perilous situation. ... The Greek construction of 2:1\u20134 consists of two sentences: a direct statement (2:1), followed by a long explanatory sentence (2:2\u20134), which includes a rhetorical question (\"how shall we escape\") with a condition (\"if we ignore [or neglect] such a great salvation\") (2:3a). The word \"therefore\" (2:1) connects this paragraph to the Son's incomparable splendor and supremacy in chapter 1. Because the Son to is superior to the prophets and the angels, what God \"has spoken to us by his Son\" (1:2), if neglected, makes one that much more culpable: \"We must pay more careful attention, therefore, to what we have heard\" lest we \"drift away.\" The expression \"what we have heard\" refers to God's revelation in his Son about salvation (cf. 2:3a). Here the danger of drifting away is due not to a rebellious refusal to heed the gospel, but to a carelessness about the commitment to Christ that it requires. The verb ''prosecho'' (lit., \"to give heed\") means not only \"pay attention\" with the mind to what one hears, but also \"to act upon what one perceives\" (Morris, 1981, 21). This verb is analogous to ''katecho'' in 3:6, 14; 10:23, where the readers are admonished to \"hold fast to their confession of faith, without which the goal of salvation cannot be reached\" (Lane, 1991, 37). The Greek word translated \"drift away\" (''pararreo'') has nautical overtones, as when a ship drifts past a harbor to shipwreck. The picture thus conveyed in 2:1 is that of Christians who are \"in peril of being carried downstream past a fixed landing place and so failing to gain its security\" (Bruce, 1990, 66). The result of drifting from Christ is a worse end than that experienced by those who disobeyed the law of Moses under the old covenant (vv. 2\u20133; cf. 10:28). As Bruce notes, \"our author is warning Christian readers, who have heard and accepted the gospel, that if they yield to the temptation to abandon their profession, their plight is hopeless\" (1990, 66). \"The message spoken by angels\" (2:2) refers to the law given at Sinai. Here we begin to see the primary reason why the Son's superiority to the angels was emphasized in 1:5\u201314. The author makes an a fortiori argument (i.e., arguing from a lesser, well-accepted truth to a greater truth, for which there is even stronger evidence) from angels to the Son, from law to gospel (cf. 7:21\u201322; 9:13\u201314; 10:28\u201329). The angels were of instrumental importance in the lesser matter of the law; the Son is of supreme importance in the greater matter of the gospel (Hagner, 1983, 21). If the law accompanied by angels was honored, how much more should we respect God\u2019s word that came in his Son! If \"every violation and disobedience\" of the law had inescapable consequences, how can we hope to escape the consequences of ignoring the gospel of Christ? Our author writes \"to awaken the conscience to the grave consequences of neglecting\" God's message in his Son (Guthrie, 1983, 80). The answer to the rhetorical question in verse 3\u2014\"How shall we escape if we ignore such a great salvation?\"\u2014is obvious: No escape is possible. In Hebrews \"salvation\" (''soteria'') was promised by the Old Testament prophets (1:1), is fulfilled by Jesus in the present time (2:3, 10; 5:9), and will be consummated in his future coming (cf. 1:14; 6:9; 9:28; see ''TDNT'', 7:989\u20131012). ... The emphasis here and elsewhere in Hebrews [with the phrase \"how shall we escape\"] is on the inescapable, terrible, and eternal consequences for apostasy (cf. 6:4\u20136; 10:26\u201331). The first steps in that catastrophic direction occur when Christians drift away from Christ (2:1) and ignore God's glorious salvation in his Son (2:3a). The author identifies his readers as fellow believers by using the pronoun \"we\" in 2:1, 3a and \"us\" in 2:3. As I. Howard Marshall points out, the warning addresses \"people who have heard the gospel and responded to it. At no point in the Epistle is it warrantable to assume that the readers originally addressed by the author are not Christians\" (1969, 139). By using the preacher's \"we,\" our author not only identifies the readers as believers, but also includes himself and all other believers in the same warning (cf. 3:6, 14; 10:26\u201327; 12:25).<ref> J. Wesley Adams, \"Hebrews,\" ''Life in the Spirit New Testament Commentary'', [Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1999], 1312\u20131313. See also Scot McKnight's article \"A Synthetic Look at the Warning Passages in Hebrews\" in External Link.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n* '''Hebrews 3:7\u201319''' \u2013 So, as the Holy Spirit says: \"Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion, during the time of testing in the desert, where your fathers tested and tried me and for forty years saw what I did. That is why I was angry with that generation, and I said, 'Their hearts are always going astray, and they have not known my ways.' So I declared on oath in my anger, 'They shall never enter my rest.'\" See to it, brothers, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away [\"falls away,\" NASB]  from the living God. But encourage [\"exhort,\" ESV] one another daily, as long as it is called Today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness. We have come to share in Christ if we hold firmly till the end the confidence we had at first. As has just been said: \"Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion.\" Who were they who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt? And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the desert? And to whom did God swear that they would never enter his rest if not to those who disobeyed? So we see that they were not able to enter, because of their unbelief. (Heb. 3:7-19, NIV 1984)\n<blockquote>\nHebrews views the possibility of remaining steadfast in faith or abandoning faith as a real choice facing the readers; the author illustrates the consequences of the latter by referring to the destruction of the rebellious Hebrews in the desert after their glorious deliverance from Egypt (3:7\u201319). The final statement in 3:6 [\"And we are God's house, if indeed we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope in which we glory\"] serves as a transition to the solemn warning and exhortation in 3:7\u201319. As a comparison was drawn between Moses and Jesus in 3:1\u20136, so now a parallel is drawn between (1) the response of unbelief and disobedience by the Hebrews who were redeemed out of Egypt under Moses' leadership (3:7\u201311), and (2) the possibility of the same response by the Hebrews who were redeemed by Christ under the new covenant provisions of salvation (3:12\u201319). Moses had been faithful to the end (3:2, 5), but most of those who left Egypt with him were unfaithful. They all shared by faith in the first great Passover deliverance but afterward because of unbelief hardened their hearts against God and perished in the desert (cf. Num. 13:26\u201314:38). Likewise, Christ, who is far superior to Moses, is also faithful (Heb. 3:2, 6), but the author of Hebrews was deeply concerned that the community of Hebrew Christians he is addressing, who had experienced the deliverance of the cross, were now in danger of hardening their hearts and of perishing because of unbelief . ... This section reveals the progressive nature of unbelief: (1) The seed of unbelief is sown and allowed to sprout; (2) unbelief leads to hardness of heart; (3) hardness leads to disobedience and rebellion; and (4) rebellion leads to apostasy and forfeiting forever God's promised rest. The powerful warning and exhortation in this section begins with a quotation from Psalm 95:7\u201311 (Heb. 3:7\u201311) and follows with the author's application for his readers (3:12\u201319). The application is framed by the repetition of the verb ''blepo'' (\"see to it,\" 3:12; \"so we see,\" 3:19) and the noun ''apistia'' (\"unbelieving,\" 3:12; \"unbelief,\" 3:19). Lane observes: \"The warning against unbelief in vv. 12 and 19 provides a literary and theological frame for the admonition to maintain the basic position of faith, which is centrally placed in v. 14\" (1991, 83). ... The warning of Hebrews 3:7\u201319 is that \"those who have experienced the redemption of the cross may find themselves in a similar situation\" (Hagner, 1983, 43) to the desert generation who perished, if they harden their hearts in unbelief and turn back from Christ to their former way of life. The passage represents a serious exhortation to persevering discipleship and unwavering faith. ... In Hebrews 3:12, the author applies the Psalm 95 warning to his fellow believers. That his readers are genuine Christians is again indicated by the word \"brothers\" (cf. 3:1). He is concerned that none of them be lost: \"Be careful,\" he exhorts, \"that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away [''apostenai'', lit., departs] from the living God\" (pers. trans.). Like the Hebrews mentioned in Psalm 95:7\u201311, God's people under the new covenant \"sometimes turn away from God in apostasy . ... This may be provoked by suffering or persecution or by the pressures of temptation, but the root cause is always unbelief\" (Peterson, 1994, 1330). Apostasy refers to abandoning what one has previously believed, in this case, a disowning of Jesus as the Son of God a departing from the fellowship of believers. Our author calls it a turning \"away from the living God.\" . . . As with the desert generation, apostasy is not so much a decision of the moment as it is the culmination of a process of hardening the heart (3:8, 13, 15) in unbelief (3:12, 19; cf. 4:2), resulting in the end in rebellion against God (3:8, 15, 16), disobedience (3:18; cf. 4:6), and finally turning away from God (3:12; cf. 3:10). An important safeguard against apostasy is a loving, nurturing community of true believers, who \"encourage one another daily\" in the Lord (3:13). Isolation from other believers particularly makes one vulnerable to the world's wisdom and lies, to the many temptations of the devil, and to \"sin's deceitfulness.\" . . . \"Today\" carries with it both a note of urgency and an inherent warning that windows of opportunity do not last forever. . . . Believers are sharers (''metochoi'', plural) \"in Christ\" (3:14, NIV), \"partakers of Christ\" (NASB, NKJV), \"partners of Christ\" (NRSV). As Christ came to share our humanity, so \"in Christ\" we share his life, grace (4:16), salvation (2:10), kingdom (12:28), suffering (13:12\u201313), and glory (2:10). To begin well is commendable, but we must \"hold firmly till the end the confidence we had at first\" (3:14b).... We must persevere until Jesus comes the second time (cf. 9:28) or until we go to him through death (cf. 2 Cor. 5:8).<ref> J.

NASB, HCSB] that none of you be found to have fallen short of it. For we also have had the gospel preached to us, just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, because those who heard did not combine it with faith. Now we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said, \"So I declared on oath in my anger, 'They shall never enter my rest.'\" And yet his work has been finished since the creation of the world. For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in these words: \"And on the seventh day God rested from all his work.\" And again in the passage above he says, \"They shall never enter my rest.\" It still remains that some will enter that rest, and those who formerly had the gospel preached to them did not go in, because of their disobedience. Therefore, God again set a certain day, calling it Today, when a long time later he spoke through David, as was said before: \"Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.\" For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day. There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God; for anyone who enters God's rest also rests from his own work, just as God did from his. Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following their example of disobedience.

Admission to this new dimension of 'rest' is solely determined by one's saving faith in Christ, who is depicted in the New Testament as the sole vehicle by which ultimate, spiritual rest is granted to the believer by God. This perspective emerges most clearly in the book of Hebrews, and also in John's Revelation\" (''Expository Dictionary of Bible Words'', 335, 817).</ref> Furthermore, many commentators and scholars mention how\n<blockquote>\n\"Rest\" correlates with other images of salvation described as future (\"to come\") or transcendent (\"heavenly\") in Hebrews. There are future realities such as \"the world to come\" (2:5), powers of the age to come (6:5), good things to come (10:1), and the city to come (13:14). Their transcendent character is expressed in references to the heavenly call (3:1), \"heavenly gift\" (6:4), heavenly sanctuary (8:5), \"heavenly things\" (9:23), heavenly homeland (11:16), and \"heavenly Jerusalem\" (12:22).\nThe rest may be compared with \"the promised eternal inheritance\" (9:15; see 6:12; 10:36) or salvation (1:14; see 9:28). It is an entrance into glory (2:10) or into \"the inner sanctuary behind the curtain\" (6:19), where Jesus has already entered as our forerunner (6:20) and champion (2:9-10; 12:2). The rest fulfilled in the unshakable kingdom (12:28), that \"enduring city\" (13:14) with solid foundations, whose \"architect and builder is God\" (11:10).

For, \"Yet a little while, and the coming one will come and will not delay; but my righteous one shall live by faith, and if he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him.\" But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and preserve their souls. (ESV)\n\n<blockquote>\nThe preacher presents another set of reasons ('''For''' \u2026) why the community must \"persevere\" (v. 36) in a composite biblical quotation. The quotation supplies further scriptural support for the eschatological urgency punctuating the transitional section (10:25, 27, 30\u201331, 34, 35, 36). \"The Day\" is fast approaching (10:25) because Christ is coming soon (10:37). The quote also introduces the topic of living by faith (v. 38a), illustrated at length in ch. 11. The introductory line, '''in just a very little while''', comes from Isa 26:20. Its original context accounts for the distinctly eschatological resonance of the phrase: the promise of resurrection (Isa 26:19), the gracious opportunity given to God's people to hide from divine wrath (26:20\u201321), and the broader themes of God's righteous judgment and salvation (26:1\u201318). The phrase fits perfectly with the following quote from Hab 2:3b\u20134 (Heb 10:37b\u201338). It reinforces the promise that the Coming One '''will come and will not delay''' (v. 37b). The author adapts the text from Habakkuk in several ways in order to drive home his points. ... First, he cements the messianic interpretation of the passage (already present in the LXX) by adding ''the'' to the word for '''coming''': ''ho erchomenos'', '''He who is coming''' or \"the Coming One\" (ESV, HCSB, NLT, RSV). This leaves no doubt that the prophecy in Habakkuk concerns Christ's second coming. Second, he transposes the two clauses in Hab 2:4 (LXX) and adds an adversative '''and''' ... between them. So in Hebrews the subject of the phrase '''if he shrinks back''' is not the coming deliverer (as in the LXX) but is '''my righteous one''' (i.e., the person of faith). The inversion sets up two contrasting courses of action for believers: living by faith or shrinking back. Third, he alters the LXX by attaching '''my''' to '''righteous one''' instead of '''faith'''. This (along with the inversion of clauses noted above) unambiguously identifies the '''righteous one''' as the believer. It switches the focus from God's faithfulness (as in the LXX) to the imperative for God's righteous people to live '''by faith'''. Hebrews embraces the assurance found in God's faithfulness (Heb 6:13\u201320; 10:23). But here the emphasis is upon the responsibility of God's people to live in accord with divine faithfulness\u2014'''by faith'''. ... The preacher sets an encouraging pastoral tone in his application of the Habakkuk text (v. 39). He does this by using the first person plural we (''h\u0113meis''; 10:19\u201325; 12:1). Providing reassurance on the heels of a strong warning about divine judgment is an effective method of exhortation he has used before (6:9 and 10:32\u201334). In effect, our author invites his audience to acknowledge with him that '''we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed'''. To '''shrink back''' (''hypostol\u0113s'') is to be timid (BDAG, 1041). It is the opposite of having \"confidence\" (10:19, 35), but it also plays phonetically with another antonym, '''endurance''' (''hypomon\u0113s'' [10:36]). Fortitude is necessary, because slinking away from God's people (10:25) and abandoning one's confession (10:23) inevitably lead to '''destruction''' (''ap\u014dleian''). This is connected with the \"eternal judgment\" (6:2), described as the dreadful and fiery execution of divine justice (6:8; 10:27, 30\u201331; 12:26\u201329). It is falling under God's curse (6:8) and displeasure (10:38), rather than doing what is pleasing to God by aligning one's actions with his will (10:36; 13:21). The readers must count themselves among '''those who believe''' (''piste\u014ds'') or \"those who have faith\" (ESV, HCSB, NASB, NET, NRSV). '''Faith''' is directly opposed to '''shrink'''ing '''back'''. Lack of faith characterized the apostasy of the wilderness generation (3:12, 19; 4:2) and led to their destruction (3:16\u201318; 4:11). Readers must instead follow the example of those who through faith and perseverance inherit God's promise (6:12; 10:36). '''Faith''' is here more than a mental assent to the truth or a mere profession of one's belief. It entails drawing near to God in \"absolute trust\" (10:22 NAB) and \"confidence\" (10:19, 35). It means holding on to the confession of hope (10:23) and committing oneself to the Christian community and its vital practices of love and well-doing (10:24\u201325). Such ''faithfulness'' involves courage and \"perseverance\" (10:32, 36). A long list of people who model this follows in ch. 11. The result of faithfulness is that we '''are saved'''. The expression is literally \"preserving of the soul\" (NASB). ... In the NT it refers to attaining eternal life (Luke 17:33; compare \"receive salvation [''peripoi\u0113sin s\u014dterias''] [1 Thess 5:9]; . ... From the beginning, the preacher has warned his audience not to ignore \"such a great salvation\" (2:3; see 1:14) or the Great High Priest who has procured it (2:10; 5:9; 9:28). Now, as earlier, though he must warn them about the dire consequences of apostasy, he is convinced \"of better things\" in their case\u2014\"things that accompany salvation\" (6:9).<ref> Kevin Anderson, ''Hebrews: A Commentary in the Wesleyan Tradition'', [Kansas City: Beacon Hill Press, 2013], 289\u2013291.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n* '''Hebrews 12:1\u201313''' \u2013 Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God. Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted. In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. And have you forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons? \"My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor be weary when reproved by him. For the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and chastises every son whom he receives.\" It is for discipline that you have to endure. God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline? If you are left without discipline, in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons. Besides this, we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we respected them. Shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live? For they disciplined us for a short time as it seemed best to them, but he disciplines us for our good, that we may share his holiness. For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it. Therefore, lift your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees, and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put out of joint but rather be healed. (ESV)<ref>B. J. Oropeza: Since the believers have so many previous examples of faith who stand as a cluster of spectators or \"cloud of witnesses,\" they are encouraged to run their metaphoric footrace of life with endurance (Heb 12:1; cf. ch. 11; 1 Cor 9:24\u201327). Hebrews uses the imagery of a footrace as one more example of God's people \"moving\" towards the goal of eschatological completion, similar to the wilderness generation journeying to the place of \"rest\" (Heb 3\u20134). The race metaphor, in any case, eventually breaks down when we realize that our author is not concerned about who gets first prize but just that all the contestants run until reaching the finish line. Once that has been achieved, the location is transformed from a stadium to the heavenly Jerusalem (12:22). Hence, the footrace concerns the participants' endurance, and apostasy would seem to be the outcome for those who do not finish the race. The runners are to mimic the attitude of the faithful champions who are now watching them in the stadium as the runners participate in the contest. In this race they must not return once they have gone out (cf. 11:15\u201316a). If they continue the race God will not be ashamed of them but will grant them entrance into the heavenly city (cf. Heb 11:16b; contrast Mark 8:38). ''The point for our author is not that some in the congregation will not start the race, but that some will not finish it''. To run this race appropriately they should lay aside every impediment and easily obstructing sin, similar to a runner who loses excess body weight and sets aside heavy clothes or anything else that would hinder the athlete's speed (cf. Philostratus, ''Gymnasticus'' 48; Philo, ''Sacrifices'' 63). The sin is unspecified, and some exegetes surmise it as the sin of apostasy (cf. Heb 3:13; 10:26). The closest prior mention of sin is in 11:25, which speaks of Moses choosing mistreatment with God's people over the temporary pleasures of sin. That sin also has been understood as apostasy. But its connection with pleasure (\u1f00\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2/cf. \u1f00\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1\u03cd\u03c9), when used in a negative sense, often refers to enticements related to forbidden foods and sensual vices, and this comes close to the meaning of sin in 12:16. The imagery of laying aside excess impediments in 12:1 is something normally done before the race starts, which tend to make the \"sin\" relevant to pre-conversion impediments that would hinder the participants during their new course of life if they are not discarded. The sin in 12:1 therefore refers to pre-converted sins or sin in general (cf. 9:26). It is not referring to apostasy per se. Interestingly, disrobing before baptism was practiced in Christian circles in the second century, and a similar practice may be operating in Asia Minor in the first century, which uses the same word in 12:1 (\u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03af\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9) to describe disrobing. In any event, post-baptismal sins could always resemble pre-baptismal ones that do lead to apostasy, and sin would seem to ensnare easily any runner (cf. 12:1, 14\u201316). As runners focus their eyes down the track at a person \"seated in the place of honor,\" so the believers are to keep their eyes on Jesus. He has already run the race of faith and finished his course having endured great suffering to the shedding of blood, something the believers have not yet experienced (12:2\u20134). Jesus is thus the ultimate exemplar of faithfulness as well as the object of faith for the runners. He endured crucifixion and despised \"shame,\" affirming the societal honor system and public opinion as unreliable regarding its evaluation of crucifixion as dishonorable. Our author deems Jesus' death to be noble, voluntarily allowed in obedience to God, dedicated to virtue, and for the benefit of others (cf. 2:9\u201310, 14f; 4:14\u201316; 5:7\u201310; chs. 7\u201310). By setting their eyes on Jesus and his accomplishment on the cross, the believers will be encouraged not to grow fatigued and \"give up\" on the race (\u1f10\u03ba\u03bb\u03cd\u03c9: 12:3, 5). The believers, as good athletes, are to endure \"discipline\" (\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1), rigorous training conducive for running a good race (12:5\u201311). The author reconfigures the idea of \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 from a loving yet punitive and correcting discipline the LORD gives to children in Prov 3:11\u201312 to a non-punitive discipline in Heb 12. The discipline and suffering the believers experience, in other words, are not the result of divine punishment. Rather, the training and suffering fosters virtuous living with the special qualities of holiness and righteousness (12:10\u201311). Children who are without this training from the Father, something all God's children participate in, are \"illegitimate and not sons\" (Heb 12:8; cf. Wis 4:3). These words do not accuse some of the audience as false believers. The author gives us no clear indication of such a problem within this community. The homily suggests instead that the members have in fact experienced suffering and are currently enduring the struggle of salvation, and this is why he encourages them to press on\u2014they are legitimate children belonging to Christ (Heb 2:13; 3:1; cf. 10:32\u201334). Their training and suffering should be considered as badges of honor; being illegitimate is a mark of dishonor. The argument probably aims to counter their supposing that discipline and suffering brings shame. David deSilva rightly argues in 12:8: \"The author thus makes the experience of reproach and loss suffered for the sake of Christ a sign of favor and honor, and, more astounding, the lack of such hardship a sign of disfavor and dishonor! Those who shrink back so as to avoid these experiences find themselves shamed because they no longer experience what all children of God share in common.\" Moreover, ''the thought of illegitimacy also stresses the reality of a person being denied the right of inheritance as a legal child'' (cf. Gen 21:10; 25:5\u20136; Gal 4:30). In this homily such an inheritance ends with everlasting salvation (Heb 1:14; 6:12; 9:15; 11:8), and ''if one is without discipline, one could anticipate a fate similar to Esau who sold his birthright and lost his rightful inheritance'' (Heb 12:16\u201317; cf. v. 23). Esau's profane act nullified his rightful privileges as the firstborn son; and if the believers fall away from their spiritual footrace they will become illegitimate children by losing their place in the family of God and Christ (cf. 2:13b; 3:1, 6; 12:23). The imagery turns to a fatigued or crippled runner who needs reviving so as to continue advancing: \"Therefore strengthen your drooping hands and your feeble knees and make straight paths for your feet so that what is crippled may not be dislocated [\u1f10\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03ad\u03c0\u03c9] but rather be healed\" (Heb 12:12\u201313/Prov 4:26). In this passage \u1f10\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03ad\u03c0\u03c9 is sometimes interpreted as a turning aside from the course, suggesting apostasy. Or it may have a medical meaning, referring to the dislocation of a joint. A dislocation would cause the runner to fall or not be able to continue the race, so in either case it seems that the runner would not be able to make it to the finish line. Thus committing apostasy is implied as a negative outcome of what might happen if the runner is not healed and strengthened once again. The author's exhortation intends to bring about the audience's strengthening and renewing; the congregants are presumed to be spiritually fatigued and about to give up the metaphoric race that leads to eternal inheritance. (''Churches Under Siege of Persecution and Assimilation: The General Epistles and Revelation'', Apostasy in the New Testament Communities, Volume 3:57\u201360).</ref>\n* '''Hebrews 12:14\u201317''' \u2013 Make every effort to live in peace with everyone and to be holy; without holiness no one will see the Lord. See to it that no one falls short of the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many. See that no one is sexually immoral, or is godless like Esau, who for a single meal sold his inheritance rights as the oldest son. Afterward, as you know, when he wanted to inherit this blessing, he was rejected. Even though he sought the blessing with tears, he could not change what he had done. (NIV)<ref>\n<blockquote>\nAs holiness belongs to the essence of God and is his highest glory, so it is to characterize God's people. We were chosen in Christ to be holy (Eph. 1:4), and God disciplines us as his children so \"that we may share in his holiness\" (12:10). ... Lane observes that \"in Hebrews 'pure' and 'holy' are interchangeable terms because those who have been made holy are those for whom Christ has made purification. ... Christians have within their reach the holiness that is indispensable for seeing God\" (1991, 451). Holiness \"is not an optional extra in the Christian life but something which belongs to its essence. It is the pure in heart, and none but they, who shall see God Matt. 5:8). Here [Heb. 12:14], as in v. 10, practical holiness of life is meant\" (Bruce, 1990, 348). Thus 12:14 begins by exhorting believers to earnestly pursue peace and holiness as a way of life. \"Make every effort\" (''dioko'') conveys diligence in the pursuit of peace and holiness. ... Peace is viewed as an objective reality tied to Christ and his redemptive death on the cross, which makes possible harmony and solidarity in Christian community (cf. Col. 1:20). Similarly, \"holiness\" is essential to Christian community (cf. 12:15). Sin divides and defiles the body of Christ, just as cancer does a human body. To pursue holiness suggests a process of sanctification in which our life and manner of living are set apart for God as holy and God-honoring. Verse 14 concludes that \"without holiness no one will see the Lord.\" To \"see\" the Lord and \"know\" him intimately are closely related. To see the Lord \"is the highest and most glorious blessing mortals can enjoy, but the beatific vision is reserved for those who are holy in heart and life\" (Bruce, 1990, 349). Things that are unholy effectively block seeing and knowing God and in the end keep the person from inheriting the kingdom of God (cf. 1 Cor. 6:9\u201310). Believers must be vigilantly watchful over the spiritual well-being of each member of the church. The verb translated \"see to it\" (''episkopeo''; 12:15a) conveys the idea of spiritual oversight and is related to the function of \"overseers\" or elders. This verb is a present active participle with the force of an imperative and carries the sense of \"watching continually.\" Three subordinate clauses of warning follow this verb, each one introduced by the words \"that no one\" (''me tis''): Watch continually\u2014\"that no one misses the grace of God\" (12:15a) \"that no bitter root grows up ...\" (12:15b) \"that no one is sexually immoral or ... godless\" (12:16a). This appeal to spiritual watchfulness is a call to the church as a whole. The exhortation \"see to it that no one misses the grace of God\" (12:15a) is a key statement. Remaining steadfast in faith (10:19\u201311:40), enduring discipline as children (12:1\u201313), and pursuing peace and holiness (12:14) are all related to the grace of God, as is everything involving our salvation. If entrance into the Christian life is by the grace of God, even so the continuance and completion of it is by the grace of God. The dreadful possibility of missing God's grace is not because his grace is inaccessible, but because some may choose not to avail themselves of it. For this reason it is possible for a person (though once a believer) not to reach the goal that is attainable only by his grace operating through faith (cf. 3:12; Bruce, 1990, 349). Marshall makes several observations concerning this warning passage (1969, 149\u201351). (1) It is possible for a believer to draw back from the grace of God (12:15a; cf. 2 Cor. 6:1; Gal. 5:4). The context of the warning here, as elsewhere in Hebrews (e.g., Heb. 2:1\u20134; 6:4\u20138; 10:26\u201331), indicates that a true believer is meant. (2) Where the grace of God is missed, bitterness will take root and potentially defile other members in the church (12:15b). The deadly sins of unbelief and a poisonous root of bitterness function like a fatally contagious disease that can \"defile many\" in the community. (3) No one should be \"sexually immoral [''pornos''; lit., fornicator] or ... godless like Esau.\" Esau was a sensual man rather than a spiritual man\u2014entirely earthly-minded rather than heavenly-minded\u2014who traded away \"his inheritance rights as the oldest son\" (12:16b) for the momentary gratification of his physical senses. He represents those who would make the unthinkable exchange of long-range spiritual inheritance (i.e., things hoped for but not yet seen, 11:1) for present tangible and visible benefits, momentary though they be. Afterwards, when Esau realized the foolishness of his choice, he wanted to inherit his blessing but could not since \"he was rejected\" by God (12:17a). Attridge notes that the comment on Esau \"conveys the sharpest warning\" of this passage (1989, 369). Though some have understood verse 17b to mean that Esau could not change Isaac's mind, the more likely sense is that of rejection by God\u2014that is, repentance was not granted by God. \"God did not give Esau the opportunity of changing his mind and gaining what he had forfeited. The author intends his readers to apply this story to themselves and their salvation. Just as Esau was rejected by God, so can they be rejected if they spurn their spiritual birthright\" (Marshall, 1969, 150). Bruce concurs that this example of Esau \"is a reinforcement of the warning given at an earlier stage in the argument, that after apostasy no second repentance is possible\" (1990, 352). Esau's \"tears\" represent regret for having lost his birthright, not repentance for having despised and shown contempt for God's gift of a birthright and for the covenant by which it was secured. This is all immediately applicable to the readers of this book, for Esau represents \"apostate persons who are ready to turn their backs on God and the divine promises, in reckless disregard of the blessings secured by the sacrificial death of Jesus\" (Lane, 1991, 455). In other words, a person may miss the grace of God and the spiritual inheritance of eternal life that he or she might have received. In such cases \"God may not permit ... an opportunity of repentance. Not all sinners go this far; but an apostate may well find that he has stretched the mercy of God to its limit, so that he cannot return\" (Marshall, 1969, 150\u201351).<ref> J. Wesley Adams, \"Hebrews,\" ''Life in the Spirit New Testament Commentary'', 1382\u20131384.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n* '''Hebrews 12:18\u201329''' \u2013 For you have not come to what may be touched, a blazing fire and darkness and gloom and a tempest and the sound of a trumpet and a voice whose words made the hearers beg that no further messages be spoken to them. For they could not endure the order that was given, \"If even a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned.\" Indeed, so terrifying was the sight that Moses said, \"I tremble with fear.\" But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable angels in festal gathering, and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect, and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel. See that you do not refuse him who is speaking. For if they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, much less will we escape if we reject him who warns from heaven. At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, \"Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens.\" This phrase, \"Yet once more,\" indicates the removal of things that are shaken\u2014that is, things that have been made\u2014in order that the things that cannot be shaken may remain. Therefore, let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, and thus let us offer to God acceptable worship, with reverence and awe, for our God is a consuming fire. (ESV)<ref>B. J. Oropeza: In 12:18\u201329 thoughts about divine judgment merge with the finishing line of the runner and the place of \"rest\" for the moving people of God portrayed in the earlier portion of the homily (Heb 3\u20134). The end of the race is met with a festival gathering (\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03ae\u03b3\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2) appropriate for the end of a competition. The scene in Hebrews is primarily eschatological with the believers having arrived in Zion, and the heavenly Jerusalem (12:22). The city is paradoxically yet \"to come\" (13:14; cf. 11:10). In 12:18\u201324 our author seems to be stripping away the curtain that hides the presently unseen reality so that the audience could get a magnificent glimpse or sneak preview of the heavenly city awaiting them at the culmination of the race. The scene depicts a location where the blessings of God's promises are fully realized: the faithful enter into a final state of rest and receive their reward of inheritance.\nIn heavenly Zion, God is the judge, Jesus is enthroned, the firstborn assembly is registered as its citizens, and both angels and perfected \"spirits\" reside there. If our author is primarily fast\u2013forwarding the recipient community's race so that they could see in advance the final scene, then the \"church\" and firstborn in Zion might include the recipients who have persevered. If so, then the \"spirits\" of the righteous ones are probably those who had already died by the time the author presented this homily. This group might be identified as the heroes of faith in chapter 11 (cf. 10:38a) or early Christian leaders and martyrs (cf. 13:7), or both. 11:39\u201340 claims that the people of faith from bygone eras could not be perfected \"without us,\" that is, they could not be completed without believers who presently live in the new covenant era (cf. 7:19; 10:10, 14). This group, it seems, will be perfected when Zion is fully realized to all the firstborn at the end of time. A final comparison from lesser to greater is given in 12:18\u201329. God speaking in the past from Mount Sinai is compared with God speaking in the present from the heavenly city. At Sinai when the old covenant was established Moses trembled exceedingly and the people were terrified at God's voice. Even beasts were to be destroyed if they touched the mountain of divine presence (cf. 12:18\u201321). Fearful as Israel's past experience with the divine presence might have been, the future heavenly Zion is intended to be even more fearful and operates on the new covenant of Jesus with God as judge (12:22\u201324). God's voice shook the earth when his presence was manifest at Sinai, but now a promise remains that at the end of the age God will also shake \"the heaven\" (12:25\u201326). The shaking of heaven and earth resembles apocalyptic imagery and destruction that must take place before the end (Rev 6:12\u201314; 16:18\u201321; 21:1\u20132; 2 Pet 3:5\u20137; Isa 59:3; Joel 2:10\u201311; cf. Isa 33:20). Such shaking communicates the fearful presence and intervention of God (cf. Nah 1:5; Joel 3:16; Isa 13:13; Jer 10:10; Ezek 39:20). ... An echo from Hag 2:6\u20137 (cf. 2:21) is felt here which was originally addressed to Zerubbabel of Judah and \"Jesus the high priest.\" In the prophetic book the day of the Lord was soon approaching, and at that time everything would be affected by it. A shaking would take place horizontally on sea and dry land and vertically on earth and in the heaven. Then all the nations would surrender their treasures and submit to Jerusalem and its temple so that that latter house of God would be greater than the former temple (Hag 2:6\u20139). Our author in Hebrews relates the shaking from Haggai to the final eschatological visitation in which the temporal and unholy things will be removed and only that which is permanent and holy will remain for the coming kingdom of God. The implication for believers seems clear enough. The author essentially warns that if the fearful presence and voice of God from the heavenly city is greater than the theophany at Sinai, then how much greater and terrifying will be the judgment of God on those who reject God's voice in the new covenant era? The author's final warning resembles the first one in Heb 2:1\u20134. The audience is to take heed (\u03b2\u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5) and not to refuse God who now speaks from heaven. The author and the community to whom he writes (\"we\") will not be able to escape the final judgment if they ''turn away'' (\u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03ad\u03c6\u03c9) from the one who warns from heaven (12:25, 29). God is viewed as a consuming fire, a thought that alludes to his judgment against enemies and those who violate his covenant (cf. Deut 4:23\u201324; 9:3; Isa 33:14). Our author has in mind a burning judgment and picture of final destruction akin with early apocalyptic traditions (Isa 66:16, 24; Zeph 1:18; 1 En. 91.9; 4 Ezra 7.38; 2 Bar. 44.15). Put differently, ''if the malaise Christian community that suffers from dullness of hearing commit apostasy by rejecting God's message, then God will consume them with a fiery punishment at the eschaton''. Given that the audience is in the process of inheriting an unshakable kingdom, the appropriate way to worship God, then, is for all believers to show gratitude (Heb 12:28), which is the proper response beneficiaries are to show to the benefactor who gives them a gift. In this case the benefactor is God. They are also to offer service pleasing to God with \"godly fear\" (\u03b5\u1f50\u03bb\u03ac\u03b2\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1) and \"dread\" (\u03b4\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2). Again the author uses fear as a strategy in his warning (4:1; 10:27, 31; 12:21; cf. 11:7). The believers are exhorted to worship God acceptably and not commit apostasy but inherit instead the promised blessing of rest in heavenly Zion.

(ESV)\n<blockquote>\nIt was customary to end such a letter with a summary (James 5:7\u201311), an oath (James 5:12), a health wish (James 5:13\u201318) and a purpose statement (James 5:19\u201320). This verse, then, should be part of the statement of the purpose of the whole letter. That in itself is reason enough to assign it great importance. The condition this verse speaks to is described in James 5:19. A Christian (\"one of you\") has erred. James gives us plenty of illustrations of this in the letter. The errors he addresses are those of partiality and greed, of anger and jealousy. All of them are found within the church. Such error calls for another Christian (\"someone\") to point it out so that the person can repent and be restored (\"bring him back\"). That, of course, is what the entire letter is about, bringing the Christians he addresses back to proper Christian behavior. This is indeed the purpose statement of James. Therefore the sinner in this verse is a Christian who has fallen into sin, such as greed or criticism of others. This Christian brother or sister has erred or gone the wrong way\u2014the text is not talking about an individual sin, however \"serious\" we may consider it, from which the believer quickly repents. As Jesus points out in Matthew 7:13\u201314 . . . there are two ways. The way that leads to life is narrow and difficult, while the one leading to death is broad and easy. Unfortunately there are many ways to get from the narrow to the broad way. This Christian (the sinner) has taken one of them and is observed by another, whom we shall call the rescuer. The question is, Who is saved from death\u2014the sinner or the rescuer? . . . It seems to me that James's message is that the sinner is the one rescued from death by the rescuer's efforts. There are four reasons for this. First, the fact that sins are covered (an adaptation of Proverbs 10:12: \"Love covers all wrongs\") seems to refer to the sinner's sins, not the potential sin of the rescuer. Only the sinner has erred in the context. Second, the word order in the Greek text makes it more likely that it is the sinner who is delivered from death. Third, the very picture of turning a person from his wandering way . . . suggests that it is the error that is putting the individual in danger of death. . . . What, then, is the death that the person is saved from?<ref> Peter Davids, in ''Hard Sayings of the Bible'', 706-707.</ref>\n</blockquote>\nA few commentators suggest that this death refers to \"physical death,\"<ref> ''So'' Zane Hodges, ''James'', 1142, in ''The Grace New Testament Commentary'', Volume 2.</ref> But most commentators see death in James 5:20 as referring to ''spiritual'' or ''eternal death''.<ref> ''So'' Douglas Moo, ''James'', 250; Scot McKnight, ''James'', 458; Grant Osborne, ''James'', 173; Ralph Martin, ''James'', 220; David Nystrom, ''James'', 320; Dan McCartney, ''James'', 264; Peter Davids, ''James'', 126; Paul Harrison, ''James'', 80; Richard Lenski, ''James'', 672; C.

James has already mentioned this in James 1:15: desire gives birth to sin, which results in death. That death is contrasted with the life that God gives (James 1:18). Since death and life are parallel ideas, it is likely that they are not physical but eternal . . . . This parallel, plus the seriousness of the tone in James 5, indicates that it is this sort of death, the ultimate death that sin brings about, which is in view. What James is saying, then, is that a Christian may err from the way of life. When another Christian attempts to rescue him or her, it is not a hopeless action. Such a rescue effort, if successful, will deliver [i.e., ''save'', ''s\u014dz\u014d''] that erring person from eternal death.<ref> Reference works consistently see \"save\" (''s\u014dz\u014d'') here in James 5:20 as referring to being saved from eternal death.

For whoever lacks these qualities is so nearsighted that he is blind, having forgotten that he was cleansed from his former sins. Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to make your calling and election sure, for if you practice these qualities you will never fall. For in this way there will be richly provided for you an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.<ref>Peter Davids: What does the author mean in 2 Peter 1:10 in exhorting us to make our \"calling and election sure\"? ... The passage is certainly calling for moral effort. The call for zeal in the phrase \"be all the more eager [or diligent]\" tips us off to that fact. If that were not enough, this verse comes right after another exhortation to moral living. In 2 Peter 1:5\u20137 we discover a chain of virtues that Christians are strongly encouraged (using a phrase similar to \"be all the more eager\") to develop. Developing them will make us effective and productive in our relationship to Christ, while the failure to develop them means that we are blind and have forgotten the cleansing from past sins that we have experienced. We are not surprised at this encouragement to moral effort, for the false teachers in 2 Peter are false precisely in that they are not living morally (false teaching in 2 Peter and in many other New Testament writings is false because it sets a wrong moral example, not just because it teaches wrong doctrine). They apparently claim to see, but in Peter's eyes they are blind. To make one's \"calling and election sure,\" then, is to guarantee or confirm or ratify (the term has those meanings in various contexts) the calling one has received. The calling, of course, is the calling to Christ referred to in [2 Peter] 1:3. The ideas of calling and election are closely associated. ... The point is that this word pair ... indicates God's action in bringing a person to Christ. This is what needs to be confirmed or ratified by the ethical obedience of the Christian. However, the author is not saying that moral effort can produce election to Christ's kingdom. The calling and election are first (the grace of God appears in [2 Peter] 1:3), just as faith comes first in his list of virtues in 1:5. Everything else is to be a fruit of faith. What Peter does believe is that without moral living one will not enter the kingdom, which is precisely what Paul also believed (1 Cor 6:9\u201310; Gal 5:21). Peter makes his point clear in the second half of the verse. To confirm one's calling is not to \"stumble.\" This term can mean to sin, as in James 2:10, 3:2. But if this were all Peter had in mind, the sentence would be so obvious as to be meaningless: If you live ethically (do these things), you will not sin (fall). Therefore Peter is using the term as it is used in Romans 11:11, to \"fall\" in the sense of \"come to grief\" or \"fall disastrously.\" In Jude 24 a related term refers to God's grace in keeping people from falling in this way, meaning \"leaving the faith.\" The opposite of falling, then, is to \"receive a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ\" (2 Peter 1:11). In other words, the author pictures Christians on a journey begun with the calling and election of God. If they fall on the way, they will never reach the goal of the kingdom (salvation). But if they do not stumble, and instead develop the virtues he has already listed, they will in the end arrive at the kingdom and be warmly welcomed into it. This teaching is important within the context of 2 Peter. As noted above, the false teachers in the church were not living according to Christian standards, yet they were claiming to be elect and on their way to Christ's kingdom. The author is denying this claim. While the whole New Testament witnesses to forgiveness of sin for all who repent, and acknowledges that Christians do sin from time to time, no author in the New Testament, whether Paul or James or Peter or John, believed that a person could be living in disregard of Christian standards and still be \"saved\" (or still inherit the kingdom). (''More Hard Sayings of the New Testament'', [Downers Grove: InterVarsity Press, 1991], 184\u2013186. Richard Bauckham: Through the knowledge of Christ he has given Christians everything necessary for godly life (verse 3); if they exercise the virtues, this knowledge will be fruit... The \"knowledge Jesus Christ,\" received at conversion, came as illumination to those who were blind in their pagan ignorance (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Christians who do not carry through the moral implications of this knowledge have effectively become blind to it again... \"Therefore, my brothers, make all the more effort.\" ... (\"to be zealous, to make an effort\") is a natural word for moral effort (Ephesians 4:3; Hebrews 4:11 ...) and is something of a favorite word in 2 Peter (also 1:15; 3:14)... \"to confirm your call and election.\" ... Christ has called the Christian into his kingdom (v. 3), promising him immortality (v. 4), but an appropriate moral response is required if his final salvation is to be guaranteed... This passage does not mean that moral progress provides the Christian with a subjective assurance of his election (the sense it was given by Luther and Calvin, and especially in seventeenth-century Calvinism), but that the ethical fruits of Christian faith are objectively necessary for the attainment of final salvation. Although we should not obscure the variety of New Testament teaching about justification by faith as it is supposed. (1) The author of 2 Peter is concerned with the ethical fruits ''of faith'' (1:5) and with moral effort which is only possible ''through grace'' (1:3: \"his divine power has bestowed on us everything necessary for a godly life\"). (2) Paul can also regard the ethical fruits of faith as necessary for salvation, even in Galatians (5:21), when countering the dangers of libertinism. (3) If our author seems to ''emphasize'' man\u2019s role in salvation, the context should be remembered. His readers were in danger of moral apostasy, under the influence of teachers who evidently held that immorality incurred no danger of judgment... [\"If you do these things, you will never stumble\"] Many commentators think that because this metaphor means \"sin\" in James 2:10; 3:2 it must do so here ... but this makes the sentence virtually tautologous: \"if you lead a virtuous life (or: if you confirm your calling by leading a virtuous life), you will never sin.\" The metaphor must rather be given the same sense as in Jude 24: it refers to the disaster of not reaching final salvation (so Bigg, James, Kelly, Grundmann, Senior)... Verse 11 holds out the prospect of entry into Christ's kingdom for those whose faith is effective in virtuous living. [Bauckham notes on page 192 that: \"In view of the eschatology of chapter 3, the eternal kingdom here is not simply 'heaven,' but looks forward to the cosmic reign of God in righteousness in the new heaven and new earth (3:13)\".] (''Word Biblical Commentary: Jude, 2 Peter'' [Waco: Word Books, 1983], 189\u2013193)</ref>\n* '''2 Peter 2:20\u201322''' \u2013 For if, after escaping the world's corruptions through a full knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus, the Messiah, they are again entangled and conquered by those corruptions, then their last condition is worse than their former one. It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than to know it and turn their backs on the holy commandment that was committed to them. The proverb is true that describes what has happened to them: \"A dog returns to its vomit,\" and \"A pig that is washed goes back to wallow in the mud.\" (ISV)<ref>Robert Picirilli: A preliminary question concerns the identity of the \"they\" in verse 20, who are identified as the apostates: Are these the false teachers, or their intended victims? In view of the fact that Peter will deal with this as an apostasy that has already occurred, I am satisfied that he is identifying the false teachers as the apostates. However, as Bauckham observes, \"The false teachers are in the state of definite apostasy described in verses 20\u201322; their followers are doubtless in severe danger of joining them.\" For our purposes here, however, it makes no difference which group Peter regards as apostates or in danger of apostasy. The main \"movements\" of the passage can be indicated in a relatively simple outline: verses 18, 19 [deals with] the attempts of the false teachers to lure believers astray; verses 20, 21 [deals with] the apostasy which they exemplify; verse 22 [is] an illustrative analogy. The key verses to consider, in discussing apostasy, therefore, are verses 20, 21. Without taking time to analyze everything leading up to them, then, I will proceed to the major questions involved. 1. That these whom Peter regards as apostates had a genuine Christian experience is seen in at least three ways. First, they \"got clean away\" from the pollutions of the world, which recalls 1:4. The aorist ''apophugontes'' (verse 20 and in 1:4) harks back to the time of their conversion. Second, they accomplished this escape \"by the knowledge of the Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\" ... Peter's use of ''epign\u014dsis'' leaves me in no doubt that he uses this compound for knowledge consciously as a way of representing the saving knowledge of Christ one gains at conversion. Third, they \"have come to know the way of righteousness.\" The verb \"have come to know\" is cognate to the noun ''epign\u014dsis'' just referred to, and is used with the same meaning. That it is perfect tense focuses on the state of the knowledge that followed the initiation therein. The \"way of righteousness\" is obviously the same as \"the way of truth\" in verse 2 and \"the straight way\" in verse 15... It would be hard to find a better description of what it means to become a Christian... 2. The apostasy which Peter ascribes to these and warns his readers against is found in two expressions, each standing in sharp contrast to the experience just described. First, they \"have been overcome by being again entangled with these (pollutions).\" And this after their escape from those very pollutions! In light of verse 19b, this being overcome is being re-enslaved. Clearly, these apostates have returned to the practice of the fleshly wickedness that previously defiled them. Nor does the fact that this is introduced with an \"if\" mitigate this conclusion... Even [Simon J.] [[Simon Kistemaker|Kistemaker]], a thorough-going Calvinist, acknowledges that the ones referred to were once \"orthodox Christians\" who \"escaped the world's defilements\"\u2014and then hurries to make these \"orthodox Christians\" orthodox in external profession and lifestyle only. He apparently does not realize how self-contradictory this sounds, or how unlike Peter's more obvious meaning. Second, they have come to the place where they \"turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them.\" And this after having come to know the way of righteousness! The \"holy commandment\" ... [is] \"Christianity as a whole way of life.\" [J. N. D. Kelly] It was \"delivered to them\" when the gospel was preached to them and its implications taught. It is a holy commandment because it sets people apart as God's and teaches them a way of life appropriated for saints. 3. The seriousness of this apostasy Peter indicates in two expressions and a proverb. First, \"the last things have come to be worse for them than the first.\" No doubt Peter is alluding to Jesus' words in Matthew 12:45 and sees that principle fulfilled in the experience of these apostates. They are in worse condition than before they came to the saving knowledge described above. Second, \"it were better for them not to have come to know the way of righteousness.\" This is incredibly startling thing: can anything be worse than never having come to the saving knowledge of the way of the Lord? As Kelly notes, apostates are worse off than unconverted believers \"because they have rejected the light.\" ... An apostate cannot be recovered; a never converted unbeliever can. Third, Peter illustrates with a two-fold proverbial saying (or with two proverbial sayings). That the idea proverbially represented \"has happened\" to the apostates means that the proverbs fit their situation. Like a dog that comes back to lick up the spoiled vomit that sickened him in the first place, like a sow that gets a bath and goes back to the mud from which she had been cleansed, these apostates return to the enslaving, polluting wickedness from which they had been delivered. Those who attempt to mitigate Peter's teaching by suggesting that the real nature of the sow or the dog had not been changed, and that this implies that these apostate false teachers were never regenerated, are pressing the illustration beyond what they are intended to convey. Indeed, the proverbs must be interpreted by the clearer words that precede them and not the other way around. The previous paragraph expresses precisely what the proverbs are intended to convey. In conclusion, it is clear that Peter is describing a real apostasy from genuine Christianity. (''Grace Faith Free Will'', 229\u2013232)</ref>\n* '''2 Peter 3:16\u201317''' \u2013 Some things in them [Paul's letters] are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, leading to their own destruction, as they do the rest of the Scriptures. And so, dear friends, since you already know these things, continually be on your guard not to be carried away by the deception of lawless people. Otherwise, you may fall from your secure position. (ISV)<ref>Gene L. Green: Instead of being faithful to Paul and his presentation of the gospel, the false teachers have distorted his message... These people \"twist\" Paul's teaching, wrenching and distorting it in such a way that the true is tuned into the false (BDAG 948; MM 593). From Paul's own writings we are aware that some in his audience distorted his preaching concerning grace (Rom 3:8), misunderstanding various declarations (e.g., Rom 3:21\u201327; 4:15; 5:20; 8:1; 1 Cor 6:12; Gal 5:13) as support of antinomianism (cf. Jude 4). Others also perverted his teaching regarding eschatological events (2 Thess 2:2\u20133; 2 Tim 2:17\u201318). The Pauline doctrines that the \"ignorant and unstable\" have distorted have to do with precisely these two points (2:19; 3:4). The false teachers and those who follow them do not solely target Paul's teaching. They twist his teaching ... as even the other Scriptures. During Peter's era, the term \"Scriptures\" referred specifically to the divinely inspired writings of the Old Testament (2 Peter 1:20\u201321; Luke 24:27, 32, 45; John 5:39; Rom 1:2; 1 Cor 15:3\u20134; Gal 3:8, 22; 1 Tim 5:18; 2 Tim 3:16; 1 Pet 2:6). But early in the life of the church, the concept of \"Scripture\" was expanded to include the teachings of Jesus (1 Tim 5:18; cf. Matt 10:10; Luke 10:7)... In the final clause, Peter underscores the seriousness of distorting the teaching of the Scriptures, whether that of Paul, Jesus, or the Old Testament. The heretics and those who follow them distort this teaching ... to their own destruction [''ap\u014dleian'']; see the comments at 2:1, 3; 3:7 regarding ''ap\u014dleia''. [At 2 Peter 2:1 Green writes: \"In the New Testament this word refers to final and ultimate destruction of those who oppose God and his purposes (Matt 7:13; Rom 9:22; Phil 1:28; 3:19; Heb 10:39; 2 Peter 3:7; Rev 17:8, 11; BDAG 127; A. Oepke, TDNT 1:396\u2013397; H. C. Hahn NIDNTT 1:462-66). It is, therefore, the opposite of salvation (Phil 1:28; Heb 10:39) and is the result of the execution of God's wrath (Rom 9:22).\"] The result of their error, which includes their embrace of immorality on the basis of their distorted teaching, is condemnation before God. The problem of the false teachers is not that they have poorly understood portions of divine revelation but that they use their twisted interpretation to justify their immorality (e.g., 2:19; 3:3-4). Twisted teaching and twisted practice go hand in hand. Heretical teaching has led to moral decadence. Before the final doxology of the letter, Peter gives his last call that his readers not fall into the error of the false teachers... He exhorts ... Therefore you, beloved, since you know these things beforehand, be on your guard... Since the recipients of this letter have not yet succumbed to the error and since they already have in hand the apostolic argument against the error via this letter as well as the prophetic and apostolic teaching regarding the coming error (3:2-3), they are advised in advance and can guard themselves from heresy... they are to be on their guard against the error of the false teachers lest they succumb to the error (3:17b). ... The apostle recognizes that the best antidote against apostasy is a Christian life that is growing. Therefore, in this the final exhortation ... of the letter, Peter urges ... but grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. ... Increase in 'grace' ... suggests advances in the appropriation or experience of the benefits of salvation (1 Peter 1:10; 3:7; 4:10; 5:5, 12; see 2 Pet 1:2; Jude 4). ... The increase in \"knowledge\" ... is not theoretical but rather personal knowledge ... whose object is 'our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ' (1:1, 11; 2:20; 3:2). Such knowledge, which marked the believers' conversion, also continues and increases throughout the life of the Christian. Along with grace, such knowledge is the strongest antidote against the destructive lures of the false teachers. (''Baker Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament: Jude and Peter'' [Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2008], 340\u2013343).</ref>\n* '''Jude 20\u201321''' \u2013 But you, beloved, building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life. (ESV)<ref>Gene L. Green: As in verse 17, the emphatic \"but you\" places the believers in sharp contrast with the heretics whom Jude has denounced in verse 19. These infiltrators are devoid of the Spirit and are trying to cause a division in the church by their teaching. Jude exhorts the beloved members of the Christian family not to be swayed by their teaching but to build themselves up on the foundation of the faith (v. 20a); pray in the Spirit, which they have as the true people of God (v. 20b); and keep themselves in the love of God (v. 21)... One of the issues that Jude has consistently raised in this epistle is the way the heretics, like their ancient prototypes, did not keep their proper place but crossed the line to participate in things outside their allotted domain. Certain angels did not remain in their proper domain but engaged in illicit relations (v. 6). These violated God's order, as had the exodus generation (v. 5) and the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah (v. 7). The heretics were trying to divert the church down a similar path (v. 4a) by altering the gospel (v. 4b) and persuading members of the congregation to follow their lifestyle (vv. 22\u201323). Jude therefore calls the church both to \"contend for the faith\" (v. 3) and to hold on securely to what they have received (v. 21). Jude previously affirmed that they, as the elect of God, were \"kept\" for Jesus Christ and his return (v. 1 ...). But in the present verse he turns the indicative of their existence into an imperative as he calls them to \"keep\" themselves \"in the love of God.\" ... In the face of the persuasive tactics of the heretics, Jude calls the church to keep themselves \"in the Love of God.\" They should not move away from God but remain faithful. Keeping themselves \"in the love of God\" echoes the thought of verse 1, where Jude identifies the Christians as those who are the beloved of God and kept for Jesus Christ. God's love was the cause of their election, and now Jude exhorts them to stay within this state of grace. This principle imperative is a powerful call to flee from apostasy... Jude adds one final (participial) imperative: ... eagerly await the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life... Jude exhorts the church not only to maintain their faith but also to anxiously await the coming of \"the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ\" (cf. 1 Thess. 1:9\u201310). The vivid hope of the parousia ... is linked with Christian ethics. Jude remains the church of the end so that they may live godly lives in the present... The mercy of the Lord Jesus Christ, shown to them upon his coming, will bring eternal life... The hope of eternal life was linked with the expectation of the coming kingdom of God... While John is able to speak about eternal life as a present possession of the believer (John 3:15\u201316, 36; 5:24; 6:47, 54), this life anticipates the final day with the righteous will be raised (John 6:40, 54). Much of the discussion of eternal life in the New Testament understands it as the future hope of the resurrection (Matt. 19:29; Mark 10:30; Luke 18:30; Rom. 2:7; Titus 1:2; 3:7). This the final act of salvation and, as such, is in contrast with the final judgment and condemnation of the unrighteous (Matt. 25:46; John 3:36; 10:28; 1 John 3:15 ...)... Jude's concern is not simply to inform them about a bright future. His call to await this event also implies that in the hope of eternal life, they should continue to avoid the way of the heretics.

Instead, His anointing teaches you about all things and is true and is not a lie; just as He has taught you, remain in Him. (HCSB)<ref>Daniel R. Streett: The \"leavers\" [i.e., \"Jewish-Christian Apostates\"] of 1 John 2:19 were individuals who participated in the community and confessed that Jesus was the messianic redeemer foretold in the Scriptures. At some point, for reasons unstated in the text, they turned back on their confession of Jesus and on the community, leaving both behind to (most likely) return to the Jewish communities they had been part of prior to their confession of Jesus. ... The readers all know about the nature of the antichrists\u2019 apostasy and they are able to discern between those who are \"of us\" and those who are not. The readers' ability to discern friend from foe comes from their knowledge of the truth, which they already possess (v. 21). The \"truth\" here is nothing other than the basic message (\u1f00\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03b1) disputed by the \u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03c7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 [antichrists\u2019], namely that \u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 \u1f14\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u1f41 \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 [Jesus is the Messiah]. The author emphasizes that the audience knows this, has confessed it, has received God's testimony to it, and therefore has no need to be taught it again by the author or by anyone else (see v. 27). The truth, in the form of the message and confession, forms the foundation of the community's existence as well as the line which divides the community from the world in the eschatological struggle. ... The readers' knowledge of the truth and ability to discern between the truth and a lie comes from their \"anointing,\" which they have \"from the Holy One\" (\u03c7\u03c1\u1fd6\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1 \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f01\u03b3\u03af\u03bf\u03c5). ... From the context, the following characteristics of the \u03c7\u03c1\u1fd6\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1 [anointing] may be noted: 1) Its reception was a past event that has continuing effects (v. 27). 2) It is pictured as teaching the readers the knowledge of the truth and eliminating the need for teaching (vv. 20\u201321, 27). 3) It is probably to be associated with the message the readers \"heard from the beginning,\" and would therefore have been received at the readers' initiation into the community (v. 24). 4) It unites the audience with Jesus, the \"anointed one\" (\u1f41 \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2, v. 22) in a relationship likely characterized as \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 [fellowship] (1:3). 5) It sets the audience in opposition to the \u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03c7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9, or \"anti-anointed-ones.\" 6) The function of the \u03c7\u03c1\u1fd6\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1 is similar to the activity of the Spirit in the rest of the letter. Both prompt confession of Jesus, provide saving knowledge, and unite the recipient to God and his Son (3:24; 4:2, 6, 13; 5:6). While v. 21 establishes a strong antithesis between the Truth, known and confessed by the audience, and the Lie, vv. 22\u201323 specify what these terms are referring to. Both have to do with the central confession of the community that Jesus is the Messiah. In v. 22, the author identifies the \"liar\" (\u03c8\u03b5\u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2) with the \"antichrist\" and specifies his defining mark: the lie or falsehood (\u03c8\u03b5\u1fe6\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2) of the liar is his denial that Jesus is the Messiah. . . . In 2:22b the author elaborates upon the antichrists\u2019 denial. The liars and antichrists deny both the Father and the Son. From 2:23 it is clear that this claim is disputed; the author must argue for it. The antichrists themselves almost certainly would not have admitted to denying the Father. In their mind, they denied only that Jesus is the Christ, God\u2019s Son. The author reasons that the opponents\u2019 denial of the Son logically entails their denial of the Father, since in Johannine theology, it is the Father who has declared Jesus to be the Son and has set his seal upon Jesus, signifying this very fact (John 3:33; cf. 6:27). To deny that Jesus is the Son is therefore to declare the Father a liar (1 John 5:10), and even to \"hate\" the Father (John 15:24). Verse 23 continues this logic: if someone denies the Son, he does not \"have\" the Father either, and vice versa. The language of \"having\" (\u1f14\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd) has been shown by E. Malatesta to derive from Jewish covenantal thinking. The author is thus saying that a proper covenantal relationship with God depends upon acceptance and acknowledgement of his messenger. Verses 22\u201323 provide numerous reasons for believing that the central issue in the antichrist secession was Jesus\u2019 messiahship. If this is the case, then the Johannine Epistles address substantially the same context and set of issues as the Fourth Gospel. The following points are especially significant: First, the confession in 1 John 2:22 that serves as the dividing line between the antichrist secessionists and the anointed believers contains exactly the same wording as the confession in John 20:31. There the author of the Fourth Gospel announces that his purpose in writing is to convince his readers that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God. . . . Thus, the phrase \"to confess/deny the Son\" in 22b\u201323 is a shorthand summary of the lengthier form in 22a: \"to confess/deny that Jesus is the Christ.\" Likewise, the child of God\u2019s most basic confession may be stated in terms of believing that \"Jesus is the Messiah\" (1 John 5:1), and only a few verses later restated in terms of believing that \"Jesus is the Son of God\" (5:5). By shifting from one title to the other the author emphasizes the filial relationship between God and the Messiah and thereby demonstrates that confessing Jesus as the Messiah is a sine qua non for a relationship with God. . . . The dramatic way the confession is presented in 1 John 2:18\u201327 as the crucial issue in the apocalyptic-eschatological struggle between truth and falsehood, believers and antichrists, shows that what is at stake is the community\u2019s most central belief, not a peripheral issue dealing with the details of the hypostatic union. At the heart of the controversy is the very confession that has created and presently defines the community. The very fact that our passage uses the language of confessing and denying (\u1f41\u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03ad\u03c9/\u1f00\u03c1\u03bd\u03ad\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9) suggests that it preserves a fixed traditional formula, a succinct summary of the faith, which one might be required to affirm publicly for membership in the community, or be asked to deny in the context of persecution. In short, the confession is the boundary marker of the Johannine community and its litmus test for teachers. As such, it is unlikely that it would take on a meaning in 1 John different from that which it carried in the Fourth Gospel. ... The argument of 1 John 2:22b\u201323 implies that the \"antichrists\" who deny that Jesus is the Messiah would claim to \"have the Father.\" This would suggest that such \"antichrists\" are Jews who understand themselves to be in a proper relationship with God, despite their rejection of Jesus as Messiah. The same argument is used by Jesus in his dispute with Jews who claim to \"have God\" as their Father (John 8:41). Jesus replies that if they had God as their Father, they would love the one sent by God, namely Jesus (John 8:42; cf. 15:23). By virtue of their rejection of Jesus, they are shown to be \"liars\" (\u03c8\u03b5\u1fe6\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, cf. John 8:44, 55) who have believed the \"lie\" of the Devil. These are the same terms (\u03c8\u03b5\u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2/\u03c8\u03b5\u1fe6\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2) 1 John 2:21\u201322 uses to describe the \"antichrists\" and their denial of Jesus' messiahship. The same type of logic is used frequently throughout the Fourth Gospel to show that the Jewish claim of faithfulness to God is disproved by rejection of Jesus, God\u2019s Son. Thus, Jesus tells the Jews that because they do not acknowledge him, they do not know the Father (John 8:19). Because they do not honor him, they do not honor the Father (5:23). He is the only way to the Father (John 14:6). ... In v. 24, the author urges the audience to do the opposite of the antichrist secessionists. While the antichrists renounced their initial confession and departed from the community, the audience must ensure that the message they heard from the beginning continues to be at the center of its communal existence. [fn. 128 reads here: The third person imperative \u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03ad\u03c4\u03c9 [be remaining] is to be taken as an instruction to the audience to hold onto the message and not to forsake it.] ... If believers maintain their participation in the community, and correlatively maintain the presence of and obedience to the original message in/among themselves, it will ensure their relationship with the Son and the Father, which will in turn ensure that they will remain, or live, forever and not be ashamed at Jesus\u2019 coming.

This is the deceiver and the antichrist. Watch yourselves so you don't lose what we have worked for, but that you may receive a full reward. Anyone who does not remain in Christ's teaching but goes beyond it, does not have God. The one who remains in that teaching, this one has both the Father and the Son. If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your home, and don't say, \"Welcome,\" to him; for the one who says, \"Welcome,\" to him shares in his evil works. (HCSB)<ref>Daniel R. Streett: The material in 2 John that addresses the problem of the secessionists is limited to verses 7\u201311. Much of the material repeats the themes and language of the key passages in 1 John. For example, the apocalyptic rhetoric of \"antichrists\" and \"deceivers\" who have \"gone out into the world\" echoes the warnings of 1 John 2:18\u201327 and 1 John 4:1\u20136, as does the emphasis on the confession of Jesus as the dividing line between friend and foe. ... Verse 7 provides the reason (\u1f45\u03c4\u03b9) the author feels it necessary and helpful to reiterate the centrality of obedient love. Obeying the commandments, loving God, and loving the brothers\u2014all of these take on heightened importance in light of the eschatological events unfolding around the community. If possible, even greater vigilance is needed if the community is going to survive the onslaught of the eschatological deception. ... The \"many deceivers\" are said to \"have gone out into the world\" (\u1f10\u03be\u1fc6\u03bb\u03b8\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd). This is the same language used of the false prophets in 1 John 4:1. While it is possible that \u1f10\u03be\u03ad\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 is being used to describe secession or apostasy, as it was in 1 John 2:19, there is no clear indication in 2 John that the \"deceivers\" have come from the Johannine community. The better parallel, then, is 1 John 4:1, which, as I argued above in Chapter 4, has in view an itinerant ministry. ... This passage, then, is less a warning about enemies within than about predators without. It is stock apocalyptic paraenesis of the type found throughout the NT. As in 1 John 4:2, the defining quality of the deceivers, or \"antichrists\" as they are called at the end of the verse, is their failure to confess \"Jesus Christ coming in the flesh.\"16 Here it will suffice to reiterate briefly what was argued above in Chapter 4: the confession of 2 John 7, like that of 1 John 4:2, has as its focus the messiahship of Jesus who has come \"into the world,\" or come \"in flesh,\" as these passages put it. The focus is not on the mode of Jesus' coming, but on the identity of Jesus as the Messiah. This is suggested both by the grammar of the confession, as well as by the numerous similar early Christian confessions which speak of Jesus or the Messiah coming in flesh without any hint of anti-docetic intent. ... The description of the eschatological opponents in v. 7 flows naturally into the warning in v. 8. In view of the many antichrists and deceivers who have embarked on their Satanically-inspired mission, the audience must \"be on guard.\" If they fall prey to the deception of the antichrists, all previous labor will be for naught. If, however, they are vigilant and repel the antichrists' offensive, they can expect to receive a \"full reward,\" presumably on the eschatological day of reckoning. [In fn. 45, Streett asks: What is \"the nature of the \u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03b8\u03cc\u03c2 [reward]? Does the author have in mind different levels or degrees of reward, so that one\u2019s unfaithfulness would result in a decreased reward? Or, does \u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03b8\u1f78\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bb\u03ae\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2 [full reward] simply refer to salvation itself, conceived of as an \"abundant\" reward? In favor of the latter is the parallel in Ruth 2:12, where the phrase does not appear to carry any connotation of degrees of reward.] This thought is amplified in v. 9, as the author further explains the necessity of holding on to the confession. The first half of the verse describes the person who falls prey to the antichrists\u2019 deception. The antichrists\u2019 message is fundamentally opposed to the basic beliefs of the community, so that to accept their message is by necessity not to remain in the \"teaching of Christ,\" and therefore not to \"have God.\" Conversely, the second half of the verse states, to remain in the teaching of Christ is to \"have\" both the Father and the Son. The same language of \"having\" God and the Son also appeared in 1 John 2:23, where, as I argued, it speaks of being in a proper covenantal relationship with God. There, \"having\" God was conditioned upon confessing the Son. Here, the condition is remaining in the \"teaching of Christ.\" ... The flow of the author\u2019s argument in 2 John 8\u20139 makes it clear that \u1f41 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03ac\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd [the one going forth or departing] refers not to the antichrists and deceivers of v. 7, as most exegetes assume, but rather to members of the audience who might fall under the spell of the deceivers and be led to leave the community. While v. 8 warns the audience against forfeiting their reward, v. 9 provides the reason that following the \"deceivers\" would result in forfeiture: such an action would sever the individual from God and his Son. In these verses, then, the same kind of situation is envisioned as in 1 John 2:18\u201327 and 4:1\u20136. The audience is told of antichrists and false prophets who are on the move, and they are warned not to give heed to them because to do so is to join the eschatological rebellion and to be cut off from the only source of eternal life. The term \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03ac\u03b3\u03c9 [going forth or departing], then must denote a course of action that the author wishes to prevent his audience from taking, much like \u1f00\u03c1\u03bd\u03ad\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 in 1 John 2:23. . . . The author warns that everyone who does not remain \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u1fc7 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b4\u03b1\u03c7\u1fc7 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 [in the teachings of Christ] does not have God. The phrase may be taken either a) as a subjective genitive, referring to the teaching that Christ himself propagated during his earthly ministry, or b) as an objective genitive, referring to the teaching about Christ. ... The context of 2 John 9 also favors the objective reading. Only two verses before, the author has spoken of the confession of Jesus as Messiah as the dividing line between truth and deception. This, then, is the teaching about the Messiah that the author refers to in v. 9. To \"remain\" in the teaching is to maintain one\u2019s confession that the expected Messiah is indeed Jesus. Verse 10 confirms this by warning the audience not to welcome anyone who does not bring this \"teaching\"\u2014an injunction that makes perfect sense in light of the way v. 7 declares anyone who does not confess Jesus\u2019 messiahship to be a \"deceiver\" and \"antichrist.\" Similarly in 1 John 4:2\u20133, the confession of Jesus as Messiah is what distinguishes the true visiting prophet from the false. ... The parallel in 1 John 2:22\u201323 is also illuminating. That passage states that the one who denies that Jesus is the messianic Son, does not \"have\" the Father. In 2 John 9, the condition for \"having\" the Father is remaining in \u1f21 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b4\u03b1\u03c7\u1f74 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 [remaining in the teaching of Christ/Messiah]. Proper confession is thus functionally equivalent to remaining in the teaching. This suggests that the content of the \"teaching\" is the identification of Jesus as the Messiah, the Son of God. ... Having announced the existence of the antichrists\u2019 mission of deception in v. 7, and having warned his audience in vv. 8\u20139 not to give up their promised reward but to maintain faithfulness to the basic teaching of Jesus' messiahship, the author now instructs his audience how to deal with visitors to the congregation. Specifically, these visitors appear to be itinerant teachers or prophets, since v. 10 refers to the teaching they carry. In the synagogue setting, visiting rabbis were often invited to provide a \"word of exhortation,\" and there is no reason to think that the Johannine house churches would not have held to the same custom. The author, however, wants to make sure that his audience does not fall prey to the \"antichrists,\" so he warns his audience to apply the key Christological criterion: does the visitor carry the teaching that Jesus is the Messiah? If so, then he may be welcomed and heeded, but if not he must be spurned and the right hand of fellowship must not be extended to him. In a first-century setting, to welcome him (\u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1ff7 \u03c7\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd) would be to provide him hospitality and support, and thus to participate in his rebellion and to take part in the propagation of the lie. A situation involving visiting teachers is probably also envisioned in 1 John 4:1\u20133, which provides the same criterion for discerning true prophets from false. It is easy to imagine that in a situation where normal Jewish synagogues were not outwardly or visibly differentiated from Jewish-Christian synagogues or \u1f10\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03b9, 2 John\u2019s Jewish-Christian audience might not hesitate to welcome an esteemed scribe or rabbi who was able to teach the Scriptures but did not hold to Jesus\u2019 messiahship. Perhaps, the \"elder\" writes to head off such openness, which could conceivably lead to some of the members abandoning their faith. In good Johannine fashion he holds that the coming of the Messiah has introduced a rift in the Jewish nation, and that those who do not accept Jesus as Messiah are not to be received as brothers and sisters, since they have rejected the Son and therefore the Father. (Streett, ''They Went Out From Us: The Identity of the Opponents in First John'', 338\u2013357). ''So'' Gerard S. Sloyan: The usual phrase, \"having\" God, both the Father and the Son (v. 9), has already occurred in 1 John 2:23 with respect to the Father and 5:12 as regards the Son. It is a stark way of saying that denial of the community's traditional position on Christology will mean loss of the intimate relation with the two that adhering to the tradition ensured. All in all, v. 9 closely resembles 1 John 2:22\u201323 in saying that apostasy from a once held faith stance means loss of the abiding divine presence.

They were not to fear, however, because Christ will reward the faithful with eternal life (\"crown of life\"; cf. 1 Cor 9:25; Jas 1:12). Those so rewarded will escape \"the second death\" (2:11), that is, exclusion from participation in God's final kingdom (cf. 20:6, 14).

They are the faint heartbeats in the nearly dead body of the Sardis church. Apart from their steadfastness and endurance in faith, the church would have been completely lifeless, only a corpse. Since they have not \"soiled their clothes\" (v. 4), they will be allowed to walk with Christ dressed in white robes, the symbol of purity, celebration, and victory. If the others in the church at Sardis heed the warning and repent, they too will become conquerors and will receive the white robe as a sign of their righteousness. Additionally, those who conquer will not have their names removed from the Book of Life, that is, the registry of those who belong to the people of God. The converse of this assurance to the faithful, though not stated, is certainly implied\u2014those who are not faithful will have their names expunged from the Book of Life and will lose their place in God's fellowship. This is a sobering wake-up call to those who take their relationship to God for granted. As Wilfrid Harrington has noted, \"While one cannot earn the right to have one's name in this book, one can forfeit it.\" Furthermore, Christ will personally acknowledge and claim as true children of God those who are faithful (cf. Matt 10:32\u201333; Luke 12:8\u20139). (''Smyth and Helwys Bible Commentary: Revelation'', 72) Stanley M. Horton: To all who overcome, who keep on winning victories through Christ, is made the promise of being clothed like the few in Sardis. They will be counted worthy to walk with Christ, their garment having been made \"white in the blood of the Lamb.\" Furthermore, their names will not be blotted out of the Book of Life, and Jesus will confess their names before the Father and before the angels of God. That is, Jesus will confess them as belonging to Him. The plain meaning here is also that those who do not overcome or keep on winning victories for Christ will have their names blotted out of the Book of Life. Some well-meaning Christians today say that this cannot be, because this would make the continuance of our salvation depend on works, a terrible denial of the grace of God. But we must recognize that our overcoming, our winning of victories, is not a matter of our works. The victory that overcomes the world is our faith (1 John 5:4). We have our victory because God gives it to us through Christ (1 Corinthians 15:57). We are saved by grace through faith (Ephesians 2:8). We continue by grace through faith, obedient faith (1 John 1:7; 2:3\u20136). The Greek tenses in 1 John 5:5 indicate continuous, or characteristic, action. That is, the person who keeps on overcoming is the one who keeps on believing with active, trusting, obedient faith. The same sort of continuous, characteristic believing causes one to keep on having the witness in himself (1 John 5:10; Romans 8:16). Because eternal life is Christ's life and is only in Christ, only those who keep on having (or holding to) the Son keep on having eternal life, while those who do not keep having (or holding to) God's Son do not keep on having that life (1 John 5:11\u201312; see also John 3:16; 6:47; the one who keeps believing keeps on having eternal life).

I am coming quickly; hold fast what you have, so that no one will take your crown.\" (NASB)<ref>Homer Hailey: \"Hold fast that which thou hast,\" which is an open door, His Word, a little power, steadfast endurance, and an assuring promise from the Lord. Hold each of these fast; keep hold of what you have. The promise of keeping these safe (v. 10) implies and imposes continuous steadfastness by the saints. \"That no one take thy crown\" (the crown of life, 2:10) away from you. The thought does not concern itself with gain to the taker, but with loss to the loser. The crown may be forfeited by any individual who grows careless, complacent, self-satisfied, overconfident, or who neglects opportunity and duty... To forfeit the crown is to lose eternal life. The doctrine that a redeemed child of God cannot so act as to be lost is here clearly denied. (''Revelation: An Introduction and Commentary'', [Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, 1979], 153). Craig S. Keener writes: Despite Jesus' praises for the Philadelphian Christians' perseverance to this point, however, \"it's not over till it's over.\" They must continue to hold fast what they have (3:11), that is, to continue to keep the message that demands their perseverance (3:10), lest their persecutors seize from them their crown (3:11; cf. 2:25). The \"crown\" is a victor's wreath appropriate to overcomers (see comments on 2:10, where the crown of life contrasts with the second death in 2:11), and losing it means roughly the same as the warning to the preceding church: exclusion from the kingdom (3:5).

(NASB)<ref>Ben Witherington: Scholars have often pondered over the reason for the list in verse 8, but when one remembers that John's audience is Christians under pressure and threat of persecution, cowardice and faithlessness to the Lord, either spiritually or ethically, must be censured... The intended rhetorical effect of this verse was not to castigate the lost or gloat over their demise, but rather to warn the faithful of the dangers of spiritual and moral apostasy. (''Revelation'', New Cambridge Bible Commentary [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003], 256) Grant R. Osborne: The section [21:1\u20138] concludes with a challenge to the readers to recognize the difference between those who are faithful and those who are not, that is, decide whether to be a \"conqueror\" (21:7) or a \"coward\" (21:8)... The first of the [vice] list ... (''deilois'', cowards), is worthy of special consideration. The ... (''de'', but) that connects 21:8 should have its full adversative force and may well especially be contrasting ... (\"the conqueror\") with ... (\"the cowards\"). While the rest of the list describes the unchurched and wicked who were the enemies of Christianity, this first term probably describes those in the church who fail to persevere but give in to the pressures of the world. Whatever one's position concerning the \"eternal security\" issue, these would be those who fit the description of passages like Hebrews 6:4\u20136; 10:26\u201331; James 5:19\u201320; 2 Peter 2:20\u201321; and 1 John 5:16, namely, those in the church who are overcome with sin and leave their \"faith.\" The reader is being asked to make a choice whether to \"overcome\" the pressure of the world and refuse to succumb to it or to be a \"coward\" and surrender to sin. Those who do so will join the unbelieving world in eternal damnation. (''Baker Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament: Revelation'', 739, 741\u201342) Craig Keener: In the context of Revelation, overcoming addresses such varied tests as compromise with the world's values (2:14, 20), dependence on our own strength (3:17), and persecution (2:10); but persecution is the test Revelation particularly emphasizes for the end-time witnesses of Jesus (12:11; 13:7). Jewish texts often speak of inheriting the world to come (21:7), a common figure of speech among early Christians as well (e.g., Matt. 25:34; Rom. 8:17; 1 Cor. 6:9). Here the overcomers inherit \"all this,\" that is, the new and sorrowless world God has prepared for them (21:1\u20136). The promise that God will be his people's God and they will be his people is the most basic component of the ancient covenant formula (Gen. 17:8; Ex. 6;7; 29:45; Lev. 11:45; 22:33; 25:38; 26:12, 45; Num. 15:41; Deut. 29:13). The prophets rehearse the same covenant formula (Jer. 7:23; 11:4; 24:7; 30:22; 31:33; 32:38; Ezek. 11:20; 14:11; 36:28; 37:23, 27; Zech. 8:8). But Revelation slightly adapts it: He will be the overcomer's God, and the overcomer will be his own child (Rev. 21:7)... All these promises culminate, however, in a warning: Those who fail to overcome, who prove disobedient, will be damned (21:8). The NIV's \"their place will be\" is more literally, \"they will have their part [or share] in\"; this is the language of inheritance, a deliberate contrast with the inheritance of the overcomers in 21:7. The \"fiery lake\" is the destination for all who will not inherit the new Jerusalem and the new creation of 21:1\u20136. \"The second death\" (21:8) contrasts with the abolition of death in new Jerusalem (21:4). Those who begin as believers must \"overcome\"; apostates, like those who never professed Christ to begin with, will be lost.

(ESV)<ref>Grant Osborne: As in Deuteronomy [4:2, \"Do not add to what I command you, and do not subtract from it, but keep the commands of the Lord your God that I give you\"], Christ is warning against false teachers who distort the meaning of the prophecies by adding their own teaching to it or removing the meaning God intended. ... The difficulty for us is how to apply this ban. It can hardly restrict differing interpretations regarding the meaning of the book. The key is to apply carefully the meaning of a \"false teacher\" or heretic. ... It refers to someone who uses Revelation to restructure the Christian faith . ... At the same time, the use of ... everyone who hears ... demonstrates that it is directed to every reader. In John's day it was especially meant for the seven churches for whom the visions were intended. For our day it must be directed to every person in the church who \"hears\" this message. ... We are all responsible to make certain that we interpret the book in accordance with the message God intended. For such people Christ provided a severe warning. ... Those who twist the divinely inspired prophecies to their own ends will suffer the consequences that fits their sin: (1) If they \"add\" their own meanings, \"God will add to that person the plagues written in this book.\" ... They will be treated as unbelievers and suffer the punishments to be inflicted on the wicked. (2) If they \"take away\" God's meaning, \"God will take away that person's share in the tree of life.\" This is more extreme, because it means they will suffer the \"second death\" (2:11; 20:6) or the lake of fire. The \"tree of life\" is found in 2:7 and 22:2 and stands for the gift of eternal life. ... Since it is said that God will \"take away\" their \"share,\" scholars often debate whether this implies the apostasy of the believer. ... There is a strong sense of warning against apostasy throughout [the book of Revelation] . . . . Thus, the reader is warned here that distorting God's message in these prophecies is tantamount to apostasy, and the person guilty of it will become an apostate unbeliever in God's eyes.

Daniel Steele, ''Mile-Stone Papers: Doctrinal, Ethical, and Experimental on Christian Progress'', 53\u201365.</ref> Greek scholars and commentators (both Calvinist and non-Calvinist) have noted that Greek present tense verbs generally refer to ''continuous action'', especially present participles.<ref>For extensive documentation of Greek Scholars and commentators (Calvinist and non-Calvinist) who note the significance of the Greek present tense verb \"believes\" in salvation contexts, please see the following External Links: \"Saving Faith: Is it Simply the Act of a Moment or the Attitude of a Life?\" \"Saving Faith is the Attitude of a Life\u2014the Scholarly Evidence;\" and \"Saving Faith in the Greek New Testament.\"</ref> For example, In his textbook, ''Basics of Biblical Greek Grammar'', Calvinist William D. Mounce writes: \"The present participle is built on the present tense stem of the verb. It describes a continuous action. It will often be difficult to carry this 'on-going' nuance into your translation, but this must be the foremost consideration in your mind.\"<ref>William Mounce, ''Basics of Biblical Greek Grammar'', 246.</ref> Calvinist Daniel Wallace brings out this \"on-going\" nuance for the present participle \"believes\" in John 3:16, \"Everyone who [continually] believes in him should not perish. ... In this Gospel, there seems to be a qualitative distinction between the ongoing act of believing and the simple fact of believing.\"<ref>Daniel Wallace, ''Greek Grammar Beyond the Basics: An Exegetical Syntax of the New Testament'', 522, brackets are from Wallace.</ref> He argues for this understanding not simply because ''believes'' is in the present tense, \"but to the use of the present participle of \u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03c9\u03bd [''pisteu\u014dn'', believing], especially in soteriological [i.e., salvation] contexts in the NT.\"<ref>Wallace, ''Greek Grammar'', 620\u2013621.</ref> Wallace goes on to elaborate,\n<blockquote>\nThe aspectual force of the present [participle] \u1f41 \u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03c9\u03bd [the one believing] seems to be in contrast with [the aorist participle] \u1f41 \u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03c3\u03b1\u03c2 [the one having believed]. ... The present [participle for the one believing] occurs six times as often (43 times) [in comparison to the aorist], most often in soteriological contexts (cf. John 1:12; 3:15, 16, 18; 3:36; 6:35, 47, 64; 7:38; 11:25; 12:46; Acts 2:44; 10:43; 13:39; Rom 1:16; 3:22; 4:11, 24; 9:33; 10:4, 11; 1 Cor 1:21; 1 Cor 14:22 [bis]; Gal 3:22; Eph 1:19; 1 Thess 1:7; 2:10, 13; 1 Pet 2:6, 7; 1 John 5:1, 5, 10, 13). Thus, it seems that since the aorist participle was a live option to describe a \"believer,\" it is unlikely that when the present was used, it was aspectually flat. The present was the tense of choice most likely because the New Testament writers by and large saw continual belief as a necessary condition of salvation. Along these lines, it seems significant that the promise of salvation is almost always given to \u1f41 \u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03c9\u03bd [the one believing] (cf. several of the above cited texts), almost never to \u1f41 \u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03c3\u03b1\u03c2 [the one having believed] (apart from Mark 16:16, John 7:39 and Heb 4:3 come the closest . . .).<ref>Wallace, ''Greek Grammar'', 621, fn. 22.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nArminian Greek scholar J.

[Thus, the one believing shall] keep on having life\" (''Words from the Word'', \"John 3:16,\" 70).</ref> It is this type of evidence which leads Arminians to conclude that \"''eternal security is firmly promised to 'the one believing'\u2014the person who continues to believe in Christ\u2014but not to \"the one having believed,\"\u2014the person who has merely exercised one single act of faith some time in the past.''\"<ref>Greenlee, ''Words from the Word'', 52. Similarily, Purkiser says, \"True security rests in the fact that saving faith is not a single historical act, but a present-tense, up-to-date, continuing process\" (''Security: The False and the True'', 32\u201333).</ref> Indeed, \"Just as ''becoming'' saved is conditioned upon faith, ''staying'' saved is conditioned upon continuing to believe.\"<ref>Cottrell (''The College Press NIV Commentary: Romans'', 2:260).</ref>\n\n===Scriptures that appear to contradict conditional security===\nThose who hold to perseverance of the saints cite a number of verses to support their view. The following are some of the most commonly cited:\n* '''John 5:24''' \u2013 Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life. (ESV)\n* '''John 6:35, 37\u201340''' \u2013 Jesus said to them, \"I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst. . . . All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out. For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me. And this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up on the last day. For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day. (ESV)\n* '''John 10:27\u201329''' \u2013 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand. (ESV)\n* '''John 17:12''' \u2013 While I was with them, I kept them in your name, which you have given me. I have guarded them, and not one of them has been lost except the son of destruction, that the Scripture might be fulfilled. (ESV)\n* '''Romans 8:1''' \u2013 There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. (ESV)\n* '''Romans 8:35, 37\u201339''' \u2013 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? ... No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord. (ESV)\n* '''1 Corinthians 1:8\u20139''' \u2013 [God] who will sustain you to the end, guiltless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. (ESV)\n* '''1 Corinthians 10:13''' \u2013 No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it. (ESV)\n* '''Ephesians 1:13\u201314''' \u2013 In him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it, to the praise of his glory. (ESV)\n* '''Philippians 1:6''' \u2013 And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ. (ESV)\n* '''2 Timothy 4:18''' \u2013 The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed and bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen. (ESV)\n* '''Hebrews 7:25''' \u2013 Therefore, He is able also to save forever those who draw near to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them. (NASB)\n* '''1 Peter 1:5''' \u2013 ... who are protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. (NASB)\n* '''1 John 3:9''' \u2013 No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God's seed remains in him; he cannot go on sinning, because he has been born of God. (NIV)\n* '''Jude 24\u201325''' \u2013 To him who is able to keep you from falling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy\u2014to the only God our Savior be glory, majesty, power and authority, through Jesus Christ our Lord, before all ages, now and forevermore! Amen.

An accurate example of a Calvinist definition of apostasy is provided by Bruce Demarest and Keith Matthews: \"Apostasy constitutes a serious turning away and repudiation of core Christian beliefs and practices. The Greek verb, ''aphist\u0113mi'' (Luke 8:13; 1 Timothy 4:1; Hebrews 3:12) means 'to fall away' or 'become apostate.' An apostate [i.e., an unbeliever] is a professing Christian who renounces Christian faith previously held [in profession only] and who often opposes and assaults the faith. Someone [i.e., an unbeliever] who professes Christianity but who then turns aside from the faith [he or she professed but never actually embraced by faith] commits apostasy, or in the words of Jesus, commits 'blasphemy against the Spirit' (Matthew 12:31). An apostate (unbeliever) can\u2019t be said to fall from grace because he never was truly in a state of grace [i.e., they were never saved to begin with].\" (Demarest and Matthews, ''The Dictionary of Everyday Theology and Culture'', [NavPress, 2010], 15).\n</ref> As noted earlier, Arminians understand that apostasy refers to a believer who has departed from a genuine saving relationship with God by developing \"an evil, unbelieving heart.\" (Hebrews 3:12)\n\nIn traditional Calvinism the doctrine of the [[perseverance of the saints]] \"does not stand alone but is a necessary part of the Calvinistic system of theology.\"<ref>Boettner, ''The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination'', 104.</ref> The Calvinist doctrines of Unconditional Election and Irresistible Grace \"logically imply the certain salvation of those who receive these blessings.\"<ref>Boettner, ''The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination'', 104.</ref> If God has eternally and unconditionally elected (chosen) some men to eternal life, and if His Spirit irresistibly applies to them the benefits of salvation, then the inescapable conclusion is that these persons will be saved forever.<ref>Boettner, ''The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination'', 104.</ref> Arminians acknowledge that the Calvinistic system is logically consistent if certain presuppositions are true, but they do not agree with these presuppositions, which include the Calvinist doctrines of unconditional election and irresistible grace.<ref>Ashby, \"Reformed Arminianism,\" 155\u2013156.</ref>\n\n===Traditional Calvinists agree with Arminians on the need for persevering in faith===\nBaptist scholar James Leo Garrett says it is important for people recognize that traditional Calvinist and Arminians \"do not differ as to whether continuing faith in Jesus Christ will be necessary for final or eschatological salvation. Both agree that it is so. Rather, they differ as to whether all Christians or all true believers ''will'' continue in faith to the end.\"<ref>Garrett, ''Systematic Theology: Biblical, Historical, and Theological'', Volume 2, 430.</ref> For example, Anthony Hoekema, longtime Professor of Calvin Theological Seminary, stated: \"Peter puts it vividly: We are kept by the power of God ''through faith'' [1 Peter 1:5]\u2014a living faith, which expresses itself through love (Galatians 5:6). In other words, we may never simply rest on the comfort of God's preservation apart from the continuing exercise of faith.\"<ref>''Saved by Grace'', 244. Hoekema goes on to write: \"As we have noted, the Bible teaches that God does not preserve us apart from our watchfulness, prayer, and persevering faith\" (''Saved by Grace'', 245). Traditional Calvinist John Murray said: \"Let us appreciate the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints and recognize that we may entertain the faith of our security in Christ only as we persevere in faith and holiness to the end\" (''Redemption Accomplished and Applied'', 155).</ref> Hoekema even writes that he agrees with Arminian writer Robert Shank when he says,\n\n<blockquote>\nThere is no warrant in the New Testament for that strange at-ease-in-Zion definition of perseverance which assures Christians that perseverance is inevitable and relieves them of the necessity of deliberately persevering in faith, encouraging them to place confidence in some past act or experience.<ref>''Saved by Grace'', 245.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nReformed Presbyterian James Denney stated:\n<blockquote>\nAnd there is nothing superficial in what the New Testament calls faith . . . it is [man's] absolute committal of himself for ever to the sin-bearing love of God for salvation. It is not simply the act of an instant, ''it is the attitude of a life''; it is the one right thing at the moment when a man abandons himself to Christ, and it is the one thing which keeps him right with God for ever. . . . Grace is the attitude of God to man which is revealed and made sure in Christ, and the only way in which it becomes effective in us for new life is when it wins [from] us the response of faith. And just as grace is the whole attitude of God in Christ to sinful men, so faith is the whole attitude of the sinful soul as it surrenders itself to that grace. Whether we call it the life of the justified, or the life of the reconciled, or the life of the regenerate, or the life of grace or of love, the new life is the life of faith and nothing else. To maintain the original attitude of welcoming God's love as it is revealed in Christ bearing our sins\u2014not only to trust it, but ''to go on trusting''\u2014not merely to believe in it as a mode of transition from the old to the new, but ''to keep on believing''\u2014to say with every breath we draw, \"Thou, O Christ, art all I want; more than all in Thee I find\"\u2014is not a part of the Christian life, but the whole of it.<ref>''The Christian Doctrine of Reconciliation'', 291, 301-302, emphasis added.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Free Grace or non-traditional Calvinist view===\nThe non-traditional Calvinist or [[Free Grace theology|Free Grace]] view disagrees with Traditional Calvinists and Arminians in holding that saving faith in Christ ''must'' continue in order for a person to remain in their saving relationship with God. For example, Zane Hodges says: \"... We miss the point to insist that true saving faith must necessarily continue. Of course, our faith in Christ should continue. But the claim that it absolutely must ... has no support at all in the Bible\"<ref>Hodges, ''Absolutely Free! A Biblical Reply to Lordship Salvation'', 63. ''So'' Norman Geisler believes that \"Continued belief is not a condition for keeping one's salvation\" (\"Moderate Calvinism,\" ''Four Views on Eternal Security'', 109).</ref> Joseph Dillow writes:\n\n<blockquote>\nEven though Robert Shank would not agree, it is definitely true that saving faith is \"the act of a single moment whereby all the benefits of Christ's life, death, and resurrection suddenly become the irrevocable possession of the individual, per se, despite any and all eventualities.\"<ref>''The Reign of the Servant Kings: A Study of Eternal Security and the Final Significance of Man'', 202.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAny and all eventualities would include apostasy\u2014falling away or walking away from the Christian faith and to \"cease believing.\"<ref>Dillow, ''The Reign of the Servant Kings'', 199. Charles Stanley writes: \"The Bible clearly teaches that God's love for His people is of such magnitude that even those who walk away from the faith have not the slightest chance of slipping from His hand\" (''Eternal Security: Can You Be Sure?'', 74). Stanley also writes, \"To say that our salvation can be taken from us for any reason, whether it be sin or disbelief, is to ignore the plain meaning of this text [Ephesians 2:8\u20139]\" (''Eternal Security'', 81).</ref> What a Christian forfeits when he falls away is not his saving relationship with God but the opportunity to reign with Christ in his coming kingdom.<ref>Dillow, ''The Reign of the Servant Kings'', 202. Based on 2 Timothy 2:11\u201313, Stanley holds that \"The unfaithful believer will not receive a special place in the kingdom of Christ like those who are fortunate enough to be allowed to reign with him. But the unfaithful believer will not lose his salvation. The apostle's meaning is evident. Even if a believer for all practical purposes becomes an unbeliever, his salvation is not in jeopardy\" (''Eternal Security'', 93).</ref>\n\nLewis Sperry Chafer, in his book ''Salvation'', provides a concise summary of the Free Grace position: \"Saving faith is an act: not an attitude. Its work is accomplished when its object has been gained.\"<ref>Chafer, ''Salvation'', 112.</ref>\n\n===Traditional Calvinists agree with Arminians against the Free Grace view===\nTraditional Calvinists and Arminians disagree with the Free Grace view on biblical and theological grounds.<ref>For a Traditional Calvinist critique of Moderate Calvinism as presented by Zane Hodges, see Kim Riddlebarger, \"What is Faith?\" in ''Christ the Lord: The Reformation and Lordship Salvation'', editor Michael Horton (Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, 1992), 81\u2013105. See also John MacArthur, ''The Gospel According to Jesus'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1988, 2008). For an Arminian critique see Ashby, \"Reformed Arminianism,\" 156\u2013167; and Robert E. Picirilli, ''Discipleship: The Expression of Saving Faith'' (Nashville: Randall House Publications, 2013).</ref> For example, Calvinist Tony Lane writes:\n\n<blockquote>The two historic views discussed so far [Traditional Calvinism and Arminianism] are agreed that salvation requires perseverance [in faith]. More recently, however, a third view has emerged [i.e., non-traditional Calvinist or Free Grace], according to which ''all who are converted will be saved regardless of how they then live''. They will be saved even if they immediately renounce their faith and lead a life of debauched atheism. Many people today find this view attractive, but it is blatantly unbiblical. There is much in the New Testament that makes it clear that discipleship is not an optional extra and that remaining faithful is a condition of salvation. The whole letter to the Hebrews focuses on warning Jewish believers not to forsake Christ ''and so lose their salvation''. Also, much of the teaching of Jesus warns against thinking that a profession of faith is of use if it is not backed up by our lives. Apart from being unbiblical, this approach is dangerous, for a number of reasons. It encourages a false complacency, the idea that there can be salvation without discipleship. ... Also it encourages a 'tip and run' approach to evangelism which is concerned only to lead people to make a 'decision', with scant concern about how these 'converts' will subsequently live. This is in marked contrast to the attitude of the apostle Paul, who was deeply concerned about his converts' lifestyle and discipleship. One only needs to read Galatians or 1 Corinthians to see that he did not hold to this recent view. The author of Hebrews was desperately concerned that his readers might lose their salvation by abandoning Christ. ... These three letters make no sense if salvation is guaranteed by one single 'decision for Christ'. This view is pastorally disastrous.<ref>''Exploring Christian Doctrine: A Guide to What Christians Believe'',(Downer's Grove: InterVarsity Press, 2014), 216.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nScot McKnight and J. Rodman Williams represent the opinion of Arminians on this view:\n<blockquote> \"Christians of all sorts tend to agree on this point: to be finally saved, to enter eternally into the presence of God, the new heavens and the new earth, and into the [final eternal] 'rest,' a person needs to persevere. The oddest thing has happened in evangelicalism though. It [i.e., non-traditional Calvinism] has taught ... the idea of 'once saved, always saved' as if perseverance were not needed. This is neither Calvinism nor Arminianism but a strange and unbiblical hybrid of both. ... [Non-traditional Calvinists] have taught that if a person has crossed the threshold by receiving Christ, but then decides to abandon living for him, that person is eternally secure. This is rubbish theology because the New Testament does not hold such cavalier notions of security.\"<ref>McKnight, ''A Long Faithfulness: A Case for Christian Perseverance'', 49.</ref>\n\n\"Any claim to security by virtue of the great salvation we have in Christ without regard to the need for continuing in faith is totally mistaken and possibly tragic in its results. ... A doctrine of 'perseverance of the saints' that does not affirm its occurrence through faith is foreign to Scripture, a serious theological misunderstanding, and a liability to Christian existence.\"<ref>Williams, ''Renewal Theology'', 2:133\u201334. Baptist scholar Dale Moody wrote: \"we dare not teach that believers can lose their . . . [confident faith, Heb 3:14], even become atheists and unbelievers and live like reprobates, and still be eternally secure in their salvation . . .\" (''Apostasy: A Study in the Epistle to the Hebrews and in Baptist History'', 28).</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nHarry Jessop succinctly states the Arminian position: \"Salvation, while in its initial stages made real in the soul through ''an act of faith'', is maintained within the soul by ''a life of faith'', manifested in faithfulness.\"<ref>''That Burning Question of Final Perseverance'', 56. Kenneth Schenck writes: \"All the gifts bestowed on humanity by God entail an obligation to 'keep faith' with the giver. Faith thus involves not only a trust and belief in God as the giver but also faithfulness to him. It is thus possible to 'break faith' with God, which would nullify the relationship\" (''Understanding the Book of Hebrews'', 65).</ref>\n\n==Denominations that affirm the possibility of apostasy==\nThe following [[Christian denomination|denominations]] or groups affirm their belief in the possibility of apostasy in either their articles or statements of faith, or by way of a position paper.\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Anabaptism|Anabaptist Churches]]<ref>See J.

Against this pernicious delusion the following true, immutable, divine threats and severe punishments and admonitions should be often repeated and impressed upon Christians who are justified by faith: 1 Cor. 6:9: Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, etc., shall inherit the kingdom of God. Gal. 5:21; Eph. 5:5: They which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. Rom. 8:13: If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die. Col. 3:6: For which thing's sake the wrath of God cometh upon the children of disobedience\" (IV.

Everts, 1882): \"Arminian churches . . . do not believe that those who are converted will necessarily be [finally] saved. They ground their belief further on the warnings which are given by our Savior and his apostles, in teaching the necessity of watchfulness and prayer, in the warnings against falling away contained in many passages of Scripture, and the express declaration that some had been made 'shipwreck of faith' and had fallen away. . . . The Methodist Churches, being Arminian in theology, totally reject the doctrine of the necessary perseverance of the saints, while at the same time they teach that the prayerful and obedient, while they remain in that condition, can never be separated from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus. They believe it, however, to be necessary to use all diligence to make their 'calling and election sure'\" (\"Perseverance, Final,\" 708\u2013709). Leland Scott, in ''Encyclopedia of World Methodism'', (Nashville: The United Methodist Publishing House, 1974): [John Wesley says] \"Arminians hold, that a true believer may 'make shipwreck of faith and a good conscience;' that he may fall, not only foully, but finally, so as to perish forever.\" (The Question, \"What is an Arminian?\" Answered. 1770). ... [According to Wesley] \"a man may forfeit the free gift of God, either by sins of omission or commission.\" (\"What is an Arminian?\" question 11) How important, therefore, for every believer to beware, \"lest his heart be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin;' ... lest he should sink lower and lower, till he wholly fall away, till he become as salt that hath lost its savor: for if he thus sin willfully, after we have received the experimental 'knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins' ...\" (Sermon on the Mount, IV, i, 8, 1747). ... Perseverance in grace, therefore, was conditioned upon the believer's persevering! Although the believer continued dependent upon atoning, redeeming grace throughout the course of his salvation, nevertheless\u2014for Wesley\u2014such grace (as seen through Scripture) must be considered finally resistible, the Spirit could finally be quenched. Thus the believer is \"saved from the fear, though not from the possibility, of falling away from the grace of God\" (Sermon 1. ii. 4.) (\"Perseverance, Final,\" 1888\u20131889). Mark B. Stokes says: \"Other people say, 'once in grace always in grace.' ... But we United Methodist believe that we are still free to turn away from Christ even while we are Christians. ... The Bible is filled with examples of people who started out well and ended up tragically. ... We experience no state of grace which is beyond the possibility of falling\" (''Major United Methodist Beliefs'', Revised and Enlarged [Nashville: Abingdon Press, 1990], 117\u2013118). '''Article XII\u2014Of Sin After Justification:''' \"Not every sin willingly committed after justification is the sin against the Holy Ghost, and unpardonable. Wherefore, the grant of repentance is not to be denied to such as fall into sin after justification. After we have received the Holy Ghost, we may depart from grace given, and fall into sin, and, by the grace of God, rise again and amend our lives. And therefore they are to be condemned who say they can no more sin as long as they live here; or deny the place of forgiveness to such as truly repent.

After justification, any of us 'may depart from grace given, and fall into sin, and, by the grace of God, rise again and amend our lives.' In this Article there is a plain denial of what some call 'eternal security' or 'once saved, always saved,' which claims that once people have received the saving grace of God, they cannot lose their salvation\" (''Belief Matters: United Methodism's Doctrinal Standards'' [Nashville: Abingdon Press, 2001], 85).</ref>\n** [[Free Methodist Church]]<ref>See \"Does Doctrine Matter?\" By Donald N.
