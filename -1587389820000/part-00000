The show relates the main events that happened in Colombia during this period and Escobar's relationship with them. The show is told from the perspective of [[Stephen Murphy (civil servant)|Steve Murphy]], an American DEA agent working in Colombia. The series depicts how Escobar first became involved in the cocaine trade in Colombia. He was an established [[black market]]eer in [[Medell\u00edn]], moving trucks of illegal goods (alcohol, cigarettes, and household appliances) into Colombia during a time when this was strictly forbidden, when he was introduced to Mateo \"Cockroach\" Moreno, a [[Chile]]an exile and underground chemist, who pitched the idea that they go into business together, with Moreno producing and Escobar distributing a new, profitable drug\u2014cocaine. \n\nThey expand beyond Moreno's small cocaine processing lab by building additional, larger labs in the rainforest and, using the expertise of [[Carlos Lehder]], transport their product in bulk to Miami, where it gains notoriety amongst the rich and famous. Soon enough, Pablo develops larger labs and more extensive distribution routes into the United States to supply growing demand. With cocaine's growth into a drug of importance in the American market, one that accounts for a large flow of U.S. dollars to Colombia and escalating drug-related violence in the United States, the Americans send a task force from the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] to Colombia to address the issue. Murphy is partnered with [[Javier Pe\u00f1a]]. The purpose of Murphy's task force is to work with the Colombian authorities, led by Colonel Carrillo, to put an end to the flow of cocaine into the United States. The season ends with Escobar's escape from prison.\n\n===Season 2 (2016)===\n{{main|Narcos (season 2)}}\n\nSeason 2 continues where season 1 ended. Soldiers find Escobar and his entourage right outside the perimeter of '[[La Catedral]]' prison but are too petrified of Escobar to make an arrest. At the embassy, the United States sends a new ambassador who brings the CIA into play. In the beginning, little change occurs for Escobar, as he still has the loyalty of his cartel. This loyalty, however, starts to slip as Escobar needs more time and resources to hide from the government. Among the tricks he uses to avoid being seen are riding around town in the trunk of a taxi cab and using young lookouts to report police movements to him.\n\nInitially, Escobar easily adapts to his new life, giving money to the community while ruthlessly killing those who try to break away from his empire. The Colombian police and Escobar engage in massive battles, resulting in high tension and unrest in Colombia. Escobar's rivals in the [[Cali Cartel|Cali cartel]] form an unlikely alliance with ousted members of his own cartel, as well as with a CIA-backed anticommunist paramilitary group. Agent Pe\u00f1a secretly works with this group, who kill members of Pablo's organization and claim responsibility as \"[[Los Pepes]]\". \n\nAfter two of Escobar's top cartel members are caught and betray him, Escobar goes on the run. He and his bodyguard hide in a safehouse, where he celebrates his 44th birthday. When Pablo tries to make contact with his family, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] and military track him down via radio triangulation and corner him on the rooftops. Pablo is hit twice in the ensuing shootout, and although he might have survived his injuries, a Colombian policeman named Trujillo executes him, amidst shouts of \"Viva Colombia!\" \n\nEscobar's wife Tata goes to the Cali cartel for their help in leaving the country. Pe\u00f1a returns to the United States, in expectation of being reprimanded by the disciplinary committee for his associations with Los Pepes, but is surprised when asked to provide intelligence against the Cali cartel, implying his future involvement with the DEA.\n\n===Season 3 (2017)===\n{{main|Narcos (season 3)}}\nSeason 3 was released on September 1, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|website=Netflix|title=Narcos {{!}} Season 3 Teaser [HD] |date=July 14, 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j73-IvTvNN0|accessdate=August 2, 2017}}</ref> The story continues after Pablo Escobar's death and shows the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]]'s fight against the [[Cali Cartel|Cali cartel]]. With Escobar out of the way, business for the cartel is booming, with new markets in the United States and elsewhere.

The show relates the main events that happened in Colombia during this period and Escobar's relationship to them. It is told through the perspective of [[Stephen Murphy (civil servant)|Steve Murphy]], an American DEA agent working in Colombia. The series depicts how Escobar first became involved in the cocaine trade in Colombia. He was an established [[black market]]eer in [[Medell\u00edn]], moving trucks worth of illegal goods (alcohol, cigarettes, and household appliances) into Colombia during a time when this was strictly forbidden, when introduced to Mateo \"Cockroach\" Moreno, a [[Chile]]an exile and underground chemist, who pitched the idea that they go into business together, with Moreno producing and Escobar distributing a new, profitable drug\u2014cocaine. \n\nThey expand beyond Moreno's small cocaine processing lab by building additional, larger labs in the rainforest and, using the expertise of [[Carlos Lehder]], transport their product in bulk to Miami, where it gains notoriety amongst the rich and famous. Soon enough, Pablo develops larger labs and more extensive distribution routes into the United States to supply growing demand. With cocaine's growth into a drug of importance in the American market, one that accounts for a large flow of U.S. dollars to Colombia and escalating drug-related violence in the United States, the Americans send a task force from the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] to Colombia to address the issue. Murphy is partnered with [[Javier Pe\u00f1a]]. The purpose of Murphy's task force is to work with the Colombian authorities, led by Colonel Carrillo, to put an end to the flow of cocaine into the United States. The season ends with Escobar's escape from prison.\n\n===Season 2 (2016)===\n{{main|Narcos (season 2)}}\n\nSeason 2 continues where season 1 ended. Soldiers find Escobar and his entourage right outside the perimeter of '[[La Catedral]]' prison but are too petrified of Escobar to make an arrest. At the embassy, the United States sends a new ambassador who brings the CIA into play. In the beginning, little change occurs for Escobar, as he still has the loyalty of his cartel. This loyalty, however, starts to slip as Escobar needs more time and resources to hide from the government. Among the tricks he uses to avoid being seen are riding around town in the trunk of a taxi cab and using young lookouts to report police movements to him.\n\nInitially, Escobar easily adapts to his new life, giving money to the community while ruthlessly killing those who try to break away from his empire. The Colombian police and Escobar engage in massive battles, resulting in high tension and unrest in Colombia. Escobar's rivals in the [[Cali Cartel|Cali cartel]] form an unlikely alliance with ousted members of his own cartel, as well as with a CIA-backed anticommunist paramilitary group. Agent Pe\u00f1a secretly works with this group, who kill members of Pablo's organization and claim responsibility as \"[[Los Pepes]]\". \n\nAfter two of Escobar's top cartel members are caught and betray him, Escobar goes on the run. His bodyguard and he hide in a safehouse, where he celebrates his 44th birthday. When Pablo tries to make contact with his family, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] and military track him down via radio triangulation and corner him on the rooftops. Pablo is hit twice in the ensuing shootout, and although he might have survived his injuries, a Colombian policeman named Trujillo executes him, amidst shouts of \"Viva Colombia!\" \n\nEscobar's wife Tata goes to the Cali cartel for their help in leaving the country. Pe\u00f1a returns to the United States, in expectation of being reprimanded by the disciplinary committee for his associations with Los Pepes, but is surprised when asked to provide intelligence against the Cali cartel, implying his future involvement with the DEA.\n\n===Season 3 (2017)===\n{{main|Narcos (season 3)}}\nSeason 3 was released on September 1, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|website=Netflix|title=Narcos {{!}} Season 3 Teaser [HD] |date=July 14, 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j73-IvTvNN0|accessdate=August 2, 2017}}</ref> The story continues after Pablo Escobar's death and shows the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]]'s fight against the [[Cali Cartel|Cali cartel]]. With Escobar out of the way, business for the cartel is booming, with new markets in the United States and elsewhere. To everyone's surprise, Gilberto Rodr\u00edguez Orejuela, the leader of the Cali cartel, announces that within 6 months, the cartel will leave the cocaine business entirely to focus on legal business interests. The decision is met with mixed reactions within the cartel.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main cast===\n* [[Wagner Moura]] as [[Pablo Escobar]] \u2013 a Colombian drug lord and the leader of the [[Medell\u00edn Cartel]] (seasons 1\u20132)\n* [[Boyd Holbrook]] as [[Stephen Murphy (civil servant)|Steve Murphy]] \u2013 a DEA agent tasked to bring down Escobar (seasons 1\u20132)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wegotthiscovered.com/tv/boyd-holbrook-wont-return-narcos-season-3/ |title=Boyd Holbrook Won't Return For Narcos Season 3 |accessdate=March 7, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Pedro Pascal]] as [[Javier Pe\u00f1a]] \u2013 a DEA agent given the task to bringing down Escobar and in season 3 the Cali Cartel (seasons 1\u20133) \n* [[Joanna Christie]] as Connie Murphy \u2013 Steve's wife, a nurse who works in the local hospital (seasons 1\u20132)\n* [[Maurice Compte]] as Colonel Horacio Carrillo \u2013 a Colombian police chief and commander of Search Bloc<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/11776380/The-terrible-reign-of-cocaine-king-Pablo-Escobar.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=November 19, 2015|title=The terrible reign of cocaine king Pablo Escobar|first=Chris|last=Harvey|date=August 1, 2015}}</ref><ref name=pascal2>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/news/a602504/maurice-compte-boards-the-netflix-series-narcos.html#~oVxdhlMLYwDF3q|title=Maurice Compte boards the Netflix series Narcos|website=Digital Spy|date=October 10, 2014}}</ref> (main season 1, recurring season 2)\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Mattos]] as [[Jorge Luis Ochoa V\u00e1squez|Jorge Ochoa]] \u2013 founding member and former leader of the Medell\u00edn cartel (season 1)\n* Roberto Urbina as [[Fabio Ochoa V\u00e1squez|Fabio Ochoa]] \u2013 a high-ranking member of the Medell\u00edn cartel (season 1)\n* Diego Cata\u00f1o as Juan Diego \"La Quica\" D\u00edaz \u2013 an assassin routinely hired by the Medell\u00edn, based on [[Dandeny Mu\u00f1oz Mosquera]] (main season 1, recurring season 2)\n* Jorge A.

Liz Shannon Miller of ''IndieWire'' said, \u201cOutside of the overhanging threat of [Pablo] Escobar, \u201cNarcos\u201d proves its ability to excel as an ongoing drama by not just introducing new members of these syndicates, but giving them real, fleshed-out lives beyond basic confrontations.\u201d<ref>{{cite web |last1=Miller |first1=Liz Shannon |title=Narcos' Season 3 Review: The Drug War Might Be Lost, but the Best Version of This Show Is Found |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2017/08/narcos-season-3-review-netflix-pedro-pascal-1201868042/ |website=IndieWire |accessdate=21 Aug 2017}}</ref> Writing for ''The Telegraph'', Ed Power called the show \u201cA sweltering thrill ride you\u2019ll want to stay with all the way until the end.\u201d<ref>{{cite web |last1=Power |first1=Ed |title=Narcos, Season 3 Review: the Drugs Drama Manages to Outlive Pablo Escobar |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/on-demand/2017/09/01/narcos-season-three-review-drugs-drama-manages-outlive-pablo/ |website=The Telegraph |accessdate=1 Sep 2017}}</ref> Critics praised Pedro Pascal's performance of DEA agent Javier Pe\u00f1a, who became the main protagonist after the departure of Boyd Holbrook, who played Steve Murphy.

Near the end, he did score three goals, making his season total 5 goals in 20 games. One of these goals was against former club Bayern Munich in a 1\u20132 victory which left Bayern with no possibilities of making it to the [[UEFA Champions League]]. In the 2007\u201308 season, his second at Hamburg, Guerrero played 29 of 34 games in the [[Bundesliga]], scoring nine goals and getting four assists, as well as becoming an undisputed starter and a vital part of the side; he was the third top scorer, behind [[Rafael van der Vaart]] (12 goals) and [[Ivica Oli\u0107]] (14 goals). In the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] and qualification, he played nine games, scoring five goals and getting three assists. His first [[hat-trick]] in his professional career was against [[Karlsruher SC]], in the last game of the Bundesliga, scoring the second, third, and fourth goals in a 7\u20130 victory.

[[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] for Brazilian club [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]] and the [[Peru national football team|Peru national team]].\n\nGuerrero spent his early career in Germany, formed at [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], and later playing at [[Hamburger SV]], amassing [[Bundesliga]] totals of 161 games and 47 goals across eight seasons. He later played in Brazil, scoring the goal which won the [[2012 FIFA Club World Cup Final]] for [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]].\n\nSince his international debut in 2004, Guerrero has earned over 100 caps for Peru and is the nation's all-time top goalscorer with 39 goals, representing them at five [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]] tournaments. He helped them to third place in the [[2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica|2011]] and [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica|2015]] editions, and to runners-up in [[2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica|2019]], finishing as top scorer in all three of these tournaments.<ref name=\"NB-2019CA\"/> He is also the current all time top scorer in the history of the [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]] among active players.

In 2003, he signed a contract with [[Bavaria]]n giants [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]. During 2003\u201304, Guerrero played in the [[Regionalliga S\u00fcd (1994\u20132012)|Regionalliga S\u00fcd]] where he scored 21 goals in 23 games. During the [[2004\u201305 FC Bayern Munich season|2004\u201305 season]], he joined fellow countryman [[Claudio Pizarro]] on the Bayern first team.\n\n===Hamburger SV===\n[[File:Guerrero-Paolo.JPG|thumb|Guerrero with Hamburger SV.]]\nIn June 2006, it was announced that Guerrero had transferred to [[Hamburger SV]] and signed a contract with the club through 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kicker.de/fussball/bundesliga/startseite/artikel/350967/ |title=Guerrero wechselt zum HSV |accessdate=11 May 2008 |date=14 June 2006 |language=German |publisher=kicker.de}}</ref> His first season was marred by an injury, which took away half his season, and his low productivity, being a sub most of the season. Near the end, he did score three goals, making his season total 5 goals in 20 games. One of these goals was against former club Bayern Munich in a 1\u20132 victory which left Bayern with no possibilities of making it to the [[UEFA Champions League]]. In the 2007\u201308 season, his second at Hamburg, Guerrero played 29 of 34 games in the [[Bundesliga]], scoring nine goals and getting four assists, as well as becoming an undisputed starter and a vital part of the side; he was the third top scorer, behind [[Rafael van der Vaart]] (12 goals) and [[Ivica Oli\u0107]] (14 goals). In the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] and qualification, he played nine games, scoring five goals and getting three assists. His first [[hat-trick]] in his professional career was against [[Karlsruher SC]], in the last game of the Bundesliga, scoring the second, third, and fourth goals in a 7\u20130 victory. This victory secured them fourth place and a UEFA Cup spot for next season.\n\nBy the beginning of the [[2008\u201309 Bundesliga|2008\u201309 season]], Guerrero had become first choice striker for Hamburger SV. Coach [[Martin Jol]] even went as far as saying that Guerrero better not catch even a cold during the season. Guerrero was fined a club record (somewhere in the region of \u20ac50,000\u2013100,000), in April 2010 for an incident at the end of a league game with [[Hannover 96]], where after apparently having been abused by a Hamburg fan, Guerrero threw his drink bottle into the crowd, striking that fan in the face.<ref name=\"zdf1\">{{cite web |url=http://fussball.zdf.de/ZDFsport/inhalt/30/0,5676,8061342,00.html |title=Rekordgeldstrafe f\u00fcr Guerrero |publisher=[[ZDF]] |date=5 April 2010 |accessdate=5 April 2010 |language=German | url-status = dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007083419/http://fussball.zdf.de/ZDFsport/inhalt/30/0,5676,8061342,00.html?dr=1 |archivedate=7 October 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The [[German Football Association]] (DFB) suspended Guerrero for five league games and fined him \u20ac20,000.<ref name=\"zdf2\">{{cite web |url=http://fussball.zdf.de/ZDFsport/inhalt/27/0,5676,8061915,00.html |title=F\u00fcnf Spiele Sperre f\u00fcr den Flaschenwerfer |publisher=[[ZDF]] |date=8 April 2010 |accessdate=8 April 2010 |language=German | url-status = dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007083502/http://fussball.zdf.de/ZDFsport/inhalt/27/0,5676,8061915,00.html?dr=1 |archivedate=7 October 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Corinthians===\n[[File:Paulo Guerrero 2012 FIFA Club World Cup.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Guerrero for Corinthians against Chelsea.]]\n[[File:David Luiz, Cassio, Paolo Guerrero, FIFA Club World Cup 2012.jpg|thumb|right|255px|[[David Luiz]], [[C\u00e1ssio Ramos|C\u00e1ssio]] and Guerrero (right) accepting their [[FIFA Club World Cup awards#Golden Ball|individual awards]] after the [[2012 FIFA Club World Cup Final]].]]\nGuerrero joined Brazilian club [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]] on 13 July 2012, on a three-year deal for a fee of [[Brazilian real|R$]]7.5 million.<ref>{{cite news |date=13 July 2012 |url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/times/corinthians/noticia/2012/07/timao-anuncia-acordo-com-guerrero-apresentacao-sera-segunda-feira.html |title=Tim\u00e3o anuncia acordo com Guerrero.

However, the fishing is very difficult to monitor, since Cobb lies outside of the U.S. [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] and therefore fishing vessels are not regulated. It is known that it has been the site of trawling, gill net, and long-line fishing for some time, mostly by the [[Fishing industry in Japan|Japanese]] and [[Oregon]]ian fleets. In 1993, the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] sponsored a study on the seamount, which concluded that concerns about overfishing at the seamount have some merit. The study also notes that fishermen there have different fishing patterns, because of different physical conditions at the seamount.<ref name=fish-1993 />\n\n== Expeditions ==\nSince its discovery in August 1950 by [[NOAAS John N.

Some endemism to the seamount has also been noted.<ref name=\"ns\"/>\n\nThe seamount's abundant sea life has made it a target for heavy fishing since the 1960s. However, the fishing is very difficult to monitor, since Cobb lies outside of the U.S. [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] and therefore fishing vessels are not regulated. It is known that it has been the site of trawling, gill net, and long-line fishing for some time, mostly by the [[Fishing industry in Japan|Japanese]] and [[Oregon]]ian fleets. In 1993, the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] sponsored a study on the seamount, which concluded that concerns about overfishing at the seamount have some merit. The study also notes that fishermen there have different fishing patterns, because of different physical conditions at the seamount.<ref name=fish-1993 />\n\n== Expeditions ==\nSince its discovery in August 1950 by [[NOAAS John N.

In addition to Etobicoke Creek and the Rouge River, the city is trisected by two minor rivers and their tributaries, the [[Humber River (Ontario)|Humber River]] in the west end and the [[Don River (Ontario)|Don River]] east of downtown. Both flow southward to Lake Ontario at Humber Bay and [[Toronto Harbour]] respectively, which are part of the longer [[Toronto waterfront|Waterfront]], as well as Etobicoke Creek and the Rouge River.\n\nThe concentration and protection of [[Toronto ravine system|Toronto's ravines]] allows for large tracts of densely forested valleys with recreational trails within the city. Approximately 26\u201328% of Toronto is covered with over 10 million trees,<ref>{{cite web|title=Every Tree Counts A Portrait of Toronto\u2019s Urban Forest|url=http://www1.toronto.ca/City%20Of%20Toronto/Parks%20Forestry%20&%20Recreation/Urban%20Forestry/Files/pdf/E/every_tree_counts.pdf|publisher=City of Toronto|accessdate=February 7, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151226020757/https://www1.toronto.ca/City%20Of%20Toronto/Parks%20Forestry%20%26%20Recreation/Urban%20Forestry/Files/pdf/E/every_tree_counts.pdf|archivedate=December 26, 2015|pages=8|date=2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> a fairly high percentage within a large city in North America and there are ambitious proposals to double the coverage. Toronto is on the northern edge of the Carolinian forest.\n\nThe shoreline of the former [[Glacial Lake Iroquois|Lake Iroquois]] is a major west\u2212east geological feature, which was formed at the end of the [[Last Glacial Period]]. In the west end, [[Davenport Road]] follows the ancient shoreline with [[Baldwin Steps|the steps]] to [[Casa Loma]] rising above and downtown skyscrapers clearly visible to the southeast. It merges with the current Lake Ontario shoreline at the [[Scarborough Bluffs]] promontory.\n\nThe [[Toronto Islands]] are the only group of islands located on the western shores of Lake Ontario and were formed from the erosion of the Scarborough Bluffs. The Toronto Islands were originally a sand spit until a major storm separated them from the mainland during the 19th century.\n\nToronto's immediate neighbours are [[Mississauga]] and [[Brampton]] within the [[Regional Municipality of Peel]], [[Vaughan]] and [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]] within the [[Regional Municipality of York]], and [[Pickering, Ontario|Pickering]] within the [[Regional Municipality of Durham]]. The [[Greater Toronto Area]] (GTA) includes the [[Regional municipality|regional municipalities]] of [[Regional Municipality of Halton|Halton]], Peel, York and Durham.\n\nThe GTA is part of a larger, natural [[ecosystem]] known as the [[Greater Toronto Bioregion]]. This ecosystem is bounded by Lake Ontario, the [[Niagara Escarpment]], and the [[Oak Ridges Moraine]], and includes many [[Drainage basin|watersheds]] that drain into Lake Ontario. Some parts of Toronto, such as [[High Park]] and the lower Humber River, are located in the northernmost parts of the [[Carolinian forest]] zone found in North America.\n\nIn March 2005, the [[Government of Ontario]] unveiled the boundaries of a [[Greenbelt (Golden Horseshoe)|greenbelt around the Greater Toronto Area]], a {{convert|7200|km2|abbr=on}} area stretching from [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]] to [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]]. The [[green belt]] is designed to curb [[urban sprawl]] and to preserve valuable natural areas and [[Arable land|farmland]] surrounding the city. However, some types of development including detached single residential, quarries and commercial facilities continue to get approved, exerting pressure and population growth on the Greenbelt. Toronto is among the latest in a line of cities that have implemented [[Urban growth boundary|growth boundaries]] of some kind as a method of restricting urban growth, including [[Ottawa]]; [[Portland, Oregon]]; [[Frankfurt]]; [[Melbourne]]; [[Seoul]] and [[London]].\n\n==Climate==\n{{climate chart\n| Toronto\n| \u22126.7 | -0.7 | 62\n| \u22125.6 |  0.4 | 55\n| \u22121.9 |  4.7 | 54\n|  4.1 | 11.5 | 68\n|  9.9 | 18.4 | 82\n| 14.9 | 23.9 | 71\n| 18.0 | 26.6 | 64\n| 17.4 | 25.5 | 81\n| 13.4 | 21.0 | 85\n|  7.4 | 14.0 | 64\n|  2.3 |  7.5 | 84\n| \u22123.1 |  2.1 | 61\n|float=right\n|source= Environment Canada }}\n\nToronto's [[continental climate]] is moderated by Lake Ontario; its climate is among the mildest in Canada east of the [[Rocky Mountains]], given Toronto's southerly latitude within the country. Downtown Toronto sits in a pocket of the humid continental climate ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfa'') zone found at the southwestern end of Lake Ontario covering the southern part of the city \u2014 including downtown (but excluding the Toronto Islands), where the annual average temperature exceeds {{convert|9|C|0}}. Some of Toronto, outside of [[Old Toronto|the pre-1998 city limits]] and some suburban areas, fall within the  ''Dfb'' climate regimen. This difference partly results from the [[urban heat island]] effect. Toronto is located in [[hardiness zone]] 7a, with increasing hardiness further away from the downtown core (5b in the suburbs).<ref name= \"planthardiness\">{{cite web | url = http://www.planthardiness.gc.ca/?m=22&lang=en&prov=Ontario&val=T |title = Plant Hardiness Data | publisher = Natural Resources Canada |date = January 14, 2015 |accessdate = May 18, 2015}}</ref> There is a high degree of variability from year to year and sometimes over a period of days, particularly during the [[winter]] months.\n[[File:Downtown from Ward's Island (11741567236).jpg|thumb|left|Toronto's [[Toronto Harbour|Inner Harbour]] frozen over. Contrasting deeper areas of the lake, situated further away from the [[Toronto waterfront|waterfront]], waters near the shoreline may occasionally [[freezing|freeze]] over.]]\nLake Ontario's water temperature varies due to [[upwelling]] of colder water or warmer pools of [[surface water]] creating very localized thermal contrast; the deeper waters of the lake, far from the shore, remain at a near-constant water temperature of {{convert|4|C|0}}, the effect of which is either cooling or warming (in winter). This creates generally warmer nights through the colder season than would otherwise occur. When offshore winds blow in summer, they warm as they near the lakeshore in the evening; conversely, the cooling effect by the lake is most pronounced on [[Spring (season)|spring]] afternoons, which can affect Toronto even more than other cities on the Great Lakes due its exposure to onshore winds from the east to south-east, on some days, the temperatures can be as much as 10&nbsp;\u00b0C (18&nbsp;\u00b0F) cooler than areas located far enough away from the Lake Ontario, an effect that wanes by summer when the dominant windflow becomes more southwesterly and the lake surface temperature warms.\n\nSprings and [[autumn]]s are shorter seasons than summers and winters, and they feature varied weather with alternating periods of dry, sunny weather and rain. Many days in these seasons are sunny with pleasant rather than warm or cold temperatures. Nights are generally cool, but frosts are rare. Snow can fall in early spring or late fall but usually melt quickly after contact with the ground. At these changeable times of the year, temperature contrasts (up to {{convert|30|C-change|0}} in extreme cases) can occur within a short time frames due to rapidly changing air masses that sweep across the continent, often accompanied by high winds. Due to these airmass changes, temperatures of {{convert|30|C|0}} or above have been recorded as early as April 16 and as late as October 8. Conversely, temperatures of {{convert|-10|C|0}} or below at night have been recorded as early as November 6 and as late as April 18. Accumulating snowfall has been reported as early as October 1 and as late as May 16.  Toronto's weather is affected by the relative position of the polar [[jet stream]] and continental storm track, both of which pass over the area with some frequency. The subtropical jet can move well north of the area in the midsummer. There is no \"dry season\" precipitation falls in all months with regularity (mainly snow during the winter), but heavier summer rains make higher average amounts as a general rule with occasional dry periods.

Despite this, there are usually two or more heavy snowfalls each winter which deposit at least {{convert|15|cm|abbr=on|2}} accumulation, usually from powerful [[winter storm]]s known as Alberta clippers, \"[[Panhandle hook#Colorado low|Colorado Lows]]\" or [[panhandle hook]]s that pick up moisture en route to the Great Lakes. These storms can produce strong easterly driven winds that fetch additional [[moisture]] from Lake Ontario. They frequently come with a volatile mix of snow, [[ice pellets]], [[freezing rain]] and sometimes just ordinary rain, all of which can disrupt transportation, and in severe cases, interrupt power supply. A sustained freezing rain event occurred on December 22, 2013 plunging 30% of the city into darkness, some until after Christmas Day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/12/22/toronto-power-down-outage-ice-storm-2013_n_4488773.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 26, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304082635/http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/12/22/toronto-power-down-outage-ice-storm-2013_n_4488773.html |archivedate=March 4, 2016 }}</ref>\n[[File:The City of Toronto snowplough.jpg|thumb|left|Toronto snowploughs clearing the highway of snow during a [[winter storm]].]]\nSuch storms can also produce large snowfall amounts, higher totals found in areas closer to Lake Ontario, sometimes falling over a series of days or weeks creating havoc.

Within twelve days, the downtown Toronto weather station at the [[University of Toronto]] ([[Trinity College, Toronto|Trinity College]] near [[Queen's Park (Toronto)|Queens Park]]) recorded an average season's worth of {{convert|118.4|cm|abbr=on|1}} of snow, much of it lake effect from Lake Ontario and a monthly record for January, but fell short of the snowiest month overall March 1870, with {{convert|158.5|cm|abbr=on|1}}, of which {{convert|89|cm|abbr=on|1}} fell over a 5-day span. February 2008 set a record a snowfall record for the month with {{convert|76.8|cm|abbr=on|1}} falling at the airport.

[[El Ni\u00f1o]] winters are generally mild and dry, with decreased snowfall (such as the winters of 2009\u20132010 and 2015\u20132016), while [[La Ni\u00f1a]] winters tend have more precipitation (the aforementioned winters of 1999 and 2008 are both La Ni\u00f1a). ENSO Neutral years are more unpredictable.\n\n===Summer===\n[[File:Boating in the Toronto Islands.jpg|thumb|Boating around the [[Toronto Islands]]. Excursions to the island are a popular summer activity in the city.]]\nMaximum temperatures typically range from {{convert|23|to|31|C|F|0}} with moderate to high humidity, proximity to Lake Ontario and the other lakes contribute to summer moisture content but far away sources like the Gulf of Mexico also factor in. The cooling influence of the lake exists but can be very localized to the immediate shoreline or move further inland, but this depends on windspeed and airmass. The influence of the lake also increases humidity & night time minimums in built-up areas. Temperatures over {{convert|32|C|0}} occur about 7 days each year but usually lasts no longer than a few days at a time (3 consecutive days of such temperatures is defined as a heat wave, which occur in most summers but maximums rarely exceed {{convert|38|C|0}}, which last occurred on July 21, 2011). However, coupled with high humidity the [[humidex]] value can rise well into the 40s during these heat events, creating great discomfort. Nighttime temperatures generally hover close to {{convert|20|C|0}} in the city but during hotter spells can remain closer to {{convert|25|C|0}}. Summer heat episodes are usually broken by cooler, drier periods not experienced further south on the continent. But intense heat episodes pose a health risk to some as they often arrive with high humidity and dangerous levels of airborne [[smog]], as a result, Environment Canada has begun posting heat warnings in recent years to bring awareness. Thunderstorms are also a regular occurrence and can pop up quickly, especially west and north of the city in areas more prone to the \"lake breeze front\" or \"lake breeze thunderstorms\" phenomenon, in which intense, sharply defined squall lines develop quickly on summer afternoons amplified by localized wind patterns between the Great Lakes.<ref>[http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/elements/lakebreezewx.htm Lake Breeze Weather] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050322/http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/elements/lakebreezewx.htm |date=March 4, 2016 }}</ref> These storms sometimes move into the city causing localized flooding resulting from downpours, intense lightning but less often severe winds knocking down trees and powerlines.\n\n===Severe weather and records===\n\nIn addition to snowstorms, ice storms, windstorms, heavy rainfall events associated with [[Tropical cyclone|tropical storms]] or very severe [[thunderstorm]]s, [[Tornado]]es are [[List of tornadoes striking downtown areas of large cities|rare but do occur]].

Just a few weeks later, record-breaking intense rainfall, the worst since Hazel, deluged north-central sections of the city within a couple of hours and destroying a section of [[Finch Avenue|a major arterial road]] in North York resulting in record insurance claims. Some rain gauges recorded 175&nbsp;mm (7\") of rain, over 100&nbsp;mm (4\") in just one hour. Another large rainstorm with intense, record rainfall amounts struck a wide swath of the city during the afternoon rush hour on July 8, 2013 flooding city streets, subway tunnels, basements and knocking out power for over two million residents, stranding commuters, some having to be rescued from a submerged train.

The coldest temperature recorded at Toronto Pearson International Airport was {{convert|\u221231.3|C|1}} on January 4, 1981, and the coldest windchill recorded was {{convert|\u221244.7|C|0}} on the same day.<ref name=\"airport\"/><ref name=\"windchill\"/> The coldest month overall was {{convert|\u221212.6|C|0}} at the airport in [[February 2015 North American cold wave|February 2015]] and at downtown in February 1875.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.thestar.com/news/starweather/2015/03/it-s-official-february-was-toronto-s-coldest-month-ever.html\n| title = It's official: February was Toronto's coldest month ever | last = Colbert | first = Sam | publisher = Toronto Star | date = March 1, 2015 | accessdate = March 4, 2015}}</ref> Winter cold snaps pose a danger as they often come with high winds, leaving the city's homeless population very prone to [[frostbite]] and [[hypothermia]].\n\n===Upward temperature trend===\nBased on public records provided by Environment Canada, the average annual temperature has increased {{convert|1.4|C-change|1}} at Pearson Airport since 2000. If compared with the thirty-year normals from 1971 to 2000, more of this increase occurred at night: the average minimum temperature has been  {{convert|1.8|C-change|1}} higher. Average precipitation during the same period was close to the average of the previous period, snowfall totals down only marginally with slightly higher rainfall. September and January have seen the highest average temperature increases. Part of this warming is likely attributed to [[Urban heat island|increased urban growth surrounding the airport]].\n\nAn older study conducted in the 1990s analysed the heat island effect comparing data from selected regional stations, including both Downtown Toronto and Pearson Airport, enough for Downtown Toronto to have a different K\u00f6ppen climate classification from its surrounding area.<ref>[http://www.cleanairpartnership.org/pdf/uhis_gough.pdf Impact of urbanization on the climate of Toronto, Ontario, Canada] {{webarchive

Little Rouge Creek5.jpg|thumb|The [[Rouge River (Ontario)|Rouge River]] and its valley at [[Rouge National Urban Park]]. The Rouge Valley is one of many hills and valleys in the area that was carved out during the [[Last Glacial Period]].]]\n{{main|Toronto ravine system}}\nToronto has numerous hills and valleys that were carved out during the [[Last Glacial Period|last Ice Age]]; The ravines are largely undeveloped, primarily as the result of [[Hurricane Hazel]] in 1954.\n\nBoth [[Dufferin Street]] and Caledonia Road between [[Davenport Road]] and [[Eglinton Avenue]] run across numerous steep hills and valleys.

Toronto is on the northern edge of the Carolinian forest.\n\nThe shoreline of the former [[Glacial Lake Iroquois|Lake Iroquois]] is a major west\u2212east geological feature, which was formed at the end of the [[Last Glacial Period]]. In the west end, [[Davenport Road]] follows the ancient shoreline with [[Baldwin Steps|the steps]] to [[Casa Loma]] rising above and downtown skyscrapers clearly visible to the southeast. It merges with the current Lake Ontario shoreline at the [[Scarborough Bluffs]] promontory.\n\nThe [[Toronto Islands]] are the only group of islands located on the western shores of Lake Ontario and were formed from the erosion of the Scarborough Bluffs. The Toronto Islands were originally a sand spit until a major storm separated them from the mainland during the 19th century.\n\nToronto's immediate neighbours are [[Mississauga]] and [[Brampton]] within the [[Regional Municipality of Peel]], [[Vaughan]] and [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]] within the [[Regional Municipality of York]], and [[Pickering, Ontario|Pickering]] within the [[Regional Municipality of Durham]]. The [[Greater Toronto Area]] (GTA) includes the [[Regional municipality|regional municipalities]] of [[Regional Municipality of Halton|Halton]], Peel, York and Durham.\n\nThe GTA is part of a larger, natural [[ecosystem]] known as the [[Greater Toronto Bioregion]]. This ecosystem is bounded by Lake Ontario, the [[Niagara Escarpment]], and the [[Oak Ridges Moraine]], and includes many [[Drainage basin|watersheds]] that drain into Lake Ontario. Some parts of Toronto, such as [[High Park]] and the lower Humber River, are located in the northernmost parts of the [[Carolinian forest]] zone found in North America.\n\nIn March 2005, the [[Government of Ontario]] unveiled the boundaries of a [[Greenbelt (Golden Horseshoe)|greenbelt around the Greater Toronto Area]], a {{convert|7200|km2|abbr=on}} area stretching from [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]] to [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]]. The [[green belt]] is designed to curb [[urban sprawl]] and to preserve valuable natural areas and [[Arable land|farmland]] surrounding the city. However, some types of development including detached single residential, quarries and commercial facilities continue to get approved, exerting pressure and population growth on the Greenbelt. Toronto is among the latest in a line of cities that have implemented [[Urban growth boundary|growth boundaries]] of some kind as a method of restricting urban growth, including [[Ottawa]]; [[Portland, Oregon]]; [[Frankfurt]]; [[Melbourne]]; [[Seoul]] and [[London]].\n\n==Climate==\n{{climate chart\n| Toronto\n| \u22126.7 | -0.7 | 62\n| \u22125.6 |  0.4 | 55\n| \u22121.9 |  4.7 | 54\n|  4.1 | 11.5 | 68\n|  9.9 | 18.4 | 82\n| 14.9 | 23.9 | 71\n| 18.0 | 26.6 | 64\n| 17.4 | 25.5 | 81\n| 13.4 | 21.0 | 85\n|  7.4 | 14.0 | 64\n|  2.3 |  7.5 | 84\n| \u22123.1 |  2.1 | 61\n|float=right\n|source= Environment Canada }}\n\nToronto's [[continental climate]] is moderated by Lake Ontario; its climate is among the mildest in Canada east of the [[Rocky Mountains]], given Toronto's southerly latitude within the country. Downtown Toronto sits in a pocket of the humid continental climate ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfa'') zone found at the southwestern end of Lake Ontario covering the southern part of the city \u2014 including downtown (but excluding the Toronto Islands), where the annual average temperature exceeds {{convert|9|C|0}}. Some of Toronto, outside of [[Old Toronto|the pre-1998 city limits]] and some suburban areas, fall within the  ''Dfb'' climate regimen. This difference partly results from the [[urban heat island]] effect. Toronto is located in [[hardiness zone]] 7a, with increasing hardiness further away from the downtown core (5b in the suburbs).<ref name= \"planthardiness\">{{cite web | url = http://www.planthardiness.gc.ca/?m=22&lang=en&prov=Ontario&val=T |title = Plant Hardiness Data | publisher = Natural Resources Canada |date = January 14, 2015 |accessdate = May 18, 2015}}</ref> There is a high degree of variability from year to year and sometimes over a period of days, particularly during the [[winter]] months.\n[[File:Downtown from Ward's Island (11741567236).jpg|thumb|left|Toronto's [[Toronto Harbour|Inner Harbour]] frozen over. Contrasting deeper areas of the lake, situated further away from the [[Toronto waterfront|waterfront]], waters near the shoreline may occasionally [[freezing|freeze]] over.]]\nLake Ontario's water temperature varies due to [[upwelling]] of colder water or warmer pools of [[surface water]] creating very localized thermal contrast; the deeper waters of the lake, far from the shore, remain at a near-constant water temperature of {{convert|4|C|0}}, the effect of which is either cooling or warming (in winter). This creates generally warmer nights through the colder season than would otherwise occur. When offshore winds blow in summer, they warm as they near the lakeshore in the evening; conversely, the cooling effect by the lake is most pronounced on [[Spring (season)|spring]] afternoons, which can affect Toronto even more than other cities on the Great Lakes due its exposure to onshore winds from the east to south-east, on some days, the temperatures can be as much as 10&nbsp;\u00b0C (18&nbsp;\u00b0F) cooler than areas located far enough away from the Lake Ontario, an effect that wanes by summer when the dominant windflow becomes more southwesterly and the lake surface temperature warms.\n\nSprings and [[autumn]]s are shorter seasons than summers and winters, and they feature varied weather with alternating periods of dry, sunny weather and rain. Many days in these seasons are sunny with pleasant rather than warm or cold temperatures. Nights are generally cool, but frosts are rare. Snow can fall in early spring or late fall but usually melt quickly after contact with the ground. At these changeable times of the year, temperature contrasts (up to {{convert|30|C-change|0}} in extreme cases) can occur within a short time frames due to rapidly changing air masses that sweep across the continent, often accompanied by high winds. Due to these airmass changes, temperatures of {{convert|30|C|0}} or above have been recorded as early as April 16 and as late as October 8. Conversely, temperatures of {{convert|-10|C|0}} or below at night have been recorded as early as November 6 and as late as April 18. Accumulating snowfall has been reported as early as October 1 and as late as May 16.  Toronto's weather is affected by the relative position of the polar [[jet stream]] and continental storm track, both of which pass over the area with some frequency. The subtropical jet can move well north of the area in the midsummer. There is no \"dry season\" precipitation falls in all months with regularity (mainly snow during the winter), but heavier summer rains make higher average amounts as a general rule with occasional dry periods.

Despite this, there are usually two or more heavy snowfalls each winter which deposit at least {{convert|15|cm|abbr=on|2}} accumulation, usually from powerful [[winter storm]]s known as Alberta clippers, \"[[Panhandle hook#Colorado low|Colorado Lows]]\" or [[panhandle hook]]s that pick up moisture en route to the Great Lakes.

The cooling influence of the lake exists but can be very localized to the immediate shoreline or move further inland, but this depends on windspeed and airmass. The influence of the lake also increases humidity & night time minimums in built-up areas. Temperatures over {{convert|32|C|0}} occur about 7 days each year but usually lasts no longer than a few days at a time (3 consecutive days of such temperatures is defined as a heat wave, which occur in most summers but maximums rarely exceed {{convert|38|C|0}}, which last occurred on July 21, 2011). However, coupled with high humidity the [[humidex]] value can rise well into the 40s during these heat events, creating great discomfort. Nighttime temperatures generally hover close to {{convert|20|C|0}} in the city but during hotter spells can remain closer to {{convert|25|C|0}}. Summer heat episodes are usually broken by cooler, drier periods not experienced further south on the continent. But intense heat episodes pose a health risk to some as they often arrive with high humidity and dangerous levels of airborne [[smog]], as a result Environment Canada has begun posting heat warnings in recent years to bring awareness. Thunderstorms are also a regular occurrence and can pop up quickly, especially west and north of the city in areas more prone to the \"lake breeze front\" or \"lake breeze thunderstorms\" phenomenon, in which intense, sharply defined squall lines develop quickly on summer afternoons amplified by localized wind patterns between the Great Lakes.<ref>[http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/elements/lakebreezewx.htm Lake Breeze Weather] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050322/http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/elements/lakebreezewx.htm |date=March 4, 2016 }}</ref> These storms sometimes move into the city causing localized flooding resulting from downpours, intense lightning but less often severe winds knocking down trees and powerlines.\n\n===Severe weather and records===\n\nIn addition to snowstorms, ice storms, windstorms, heavy rainfall events associated with [[Tropical cyclone|tropical storms]] or very severe [[thunderstorm]]s, [[Tornado]]es are [[List of tornadoes striking downtown areas of large cities|rare but do occur]].
