The primacy of the underlying geometric structure, rooted in the abstract, controls practically all of the elements of the artwork.<ref name=\"Green, 1987\">Christopher Green, ''Cubism and its Enemies, Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916&ndash;1928'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1987, pp. 13-47, 215</ref>\n\nThis range of [[Style (visual arts)|styles]] of painting and sculpture, especially significant between 1917 and 1920 (referred to alternatively as the ''Crystal Period'', ''classical Cubism'', ''pure Cubism'', ''advanced Cubism'', ''late Cubism'', ''synthetic Cubism'', or the ''second phase of Cubism''), was practiced in varying degrees by a multitude of artists; particularly those under contract with the art dealer and collector [[L\u00e9once Rosenberg]]\u2014[[Jean Metzinger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Henri Laurens]], and [[Jacques Lipchitz]] most noticeably of all. The tightening of the compositions, the clarity and sense of order reflected in these works, led to its being referred to by the French poet and art critic [[Maurice Raynal]] as 'crystal' Cubism.<ref name=\"MoMA\">[https://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&section_id=T020545 Christopher Green, ''Late Cubism'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009]</ref> Considerations manifested by Cubists prior to the outset of [[World War I]]\u2014such as the [[Fourth dimension in art|fourth dimension]], dynamism of modern life, the occult, and [[Henri Bergson]]'s concept of [[Duration (philosophy)|duration]]\u2014had now been vacated, replaced by a purely formal frame of reference that proceeded from a cohesive stance toward art and life.\n\nAs post-war reconstruction began, so too did a series of exhibitions at L\u00e9once Rosenberg's [[L\u00e9once Rosenberg#Galerie de L'Effort Moderne|Galerie de L'Effort Moderne]]: order and the allegiance to the aesthetically pure remained the prevailing tendency. The collective phenomenon of Cubism once again\u2014now in its advanced revisionist form\u2014became part of a widely discussed development in French culture. Crystal Cubism was the culmination of a continuous narrowing of scope in the name of a [[return to order]]; based upon the observation of the artists relation to nature, rather than on the nature of reality itself.<ref name=\"Inside Modernism\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=gpPDpEYRA90C&pg=PA88&lpg=PA88&dq=%22Crystal+Cubism%22&source=bl&ots=HsCDYfw3KE&sig=nw_h8YuUu7Q9HjoPJIFfwCbTsgE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=pKpiVZiMGszcUfGjgKgN&ved=0CDYQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22Crystal%20Cubism%22&f=false Thomas Vargish, Delo E.

The purifying of Cubism from 1914 through the mid-1920s, with its cohesive unity and voluntary constraints, has been linked to a much broader [[Ideology|ideological]] transformation towards [[conservatism]] in both French society and [[Culture of France|French culture]]. In terms of the separation of culture and life, the Crystal Cubist period emerges as the most important in the history of [[Modernism]].<ref name=\"Green, 1987\" />\n\n==Background==\n\n===Beginnings: C\u00e9zanne===\n[[File:Paul C\u00e9zanne, 1888, Mardi gras (Pierrot et Arlequin), oil on canvas, 102 x 81 cm, Pushkin Museum.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], 1888, ''Mardi gras (Pierrot et Arlequin)'', oil on canvas, 102 x 81 cm, [[Pushkin Museum]], Moscow]]\nCubism, from its inception, stems from the dissatisfaction with the ''idea of form'' that had been in practiced since the [[Renaissance]].<ref name=\"Gleizes, Epic\">[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&r/gltexts/epic Albert Gleizes, ''L'Epop\u00e9e'', written in 1925, published in ''Le Rouge et le Noir'', 1929.

[[Paul C\u00e9zanne]] was instrumental, as his work marked a shift from a more representational art form to one that was increasingly abstract, with a strong emphasis on the simplification of geometric structure. In a letter addressed to [[\u00c9mile Bernard]] dated 15 April 1904, C\u00e9zanne writes: \"Interpret nature in terms of the cylinder, the sphere, the cone; put everything in perspective, so that each side of an object, of a plane, recedes toward a central point.\"<ref name=\"Erle Lora\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=vpbEHESVx9cC&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9&dq=C\u00e9zanne,+le+cylindres,+sph\u00e8res,+et+le+c\u00f4nes&source=bl&ots=VWN2A52aTk&sig=kFqKvxXeu6Q_DgjHn2GAb6TDbFE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=VpsqUenwBom3hAfVvIGADg&ved=0CEMQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&q=cylinder%2C%20sphere%2C%20cone&f=false Erle Lora, ''C\u00e9zannes Composition: Analysis of His Form with Diagrams and Photographs of His Motifs''], Foreword by Richard Shiff, University of California Press, 30 April 2006</ref>\n\nC\u00e9zanne was preoccupied by the means of rendering volume and space, surface variations (or modulations) with overlapped shifting planes. Increasingly in his later works, C\u00e9zanne achieves a greater freedom. His work became bolder, more arbitrary, more dynamic and increasingly nonrepresentational. As his color planes acquired greater formal independence, defined objects and structures began to lose their identity.<ref name=\"Erle Lora\" />\n\n===The first phase===\n{{main|Proto-Cubism}}\n[[File:Georges Braque, 1908, Maisons et arbre, oil on canvas, 40.5 x 32.5 cm, Lille M\u00e9tropole Museum of Modern, Contemporary and Outsider Art.jpg|thumb|Georges Braque, 1908, ''Maisons et arbre'' (''[[Houses at l'Estaque]]''), oil on canvas, 40.5 x 32.5 cm, [[Lille M\u00e9tropole Museum of Modern, Contemporary and Outsider Art]]]]\nArtists at the forefront of the Parisian art scene at the outset of the 20th century would not fail to notice the tendencies toward abstraction inherent in the work of C\u00e9zanne, and ventured still further.<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\">Robert L.

Where before, the foundational pillars of academicism had been shaken, now they had been toppled.<ref name=\"Gleizes, Epic\" /> \"It was a total regeneration\", writes Gleizes, \"indicating the emergence of a wholly new cast of mind.

Despite the brutal interruption, each found the time to continue making art, sustaining differing types of Cubism. Yet they discovered a ubiquitous link between the Cubist syntax (beyond pre-war attitudes) and that of the anonymity and novelty of mechanized warfare. Cubism evolved as much a result of an ''evasion'' of the inconceivable atrocities of war as of nationalistic pressures. Along with the evasion came the need to diverge further and further away from the depiction of things. As the rift between art and life grew, so too came the burgeoning need for a process of distillation.<ref name=\"Green, 1987\" />\n\n[[File:Portrait of Josette 1916 Juan Gris.jpg|thumb|[[Juan Gris]], October 1916, ''Portrait of Josette Gris'', 116 x 73 cm, [[Museo Reina Sofia]]]]\nThis period of profound reflection contributed to the constitution of a new [[mindset]]; a prerequisite for fundamental change.

It is not the materialist perspective of Gris, nor the romantic perspective of Picasso. It is rather a metaphysical perspective\u2014I take full responsibility for the word. You can't begin to imagine what I've found out since the beginning of the war, working outside painting but for painting. The geometry of the fourth space has no more secret for me. Previously I had only intuitions, now I have certainty. I have made a whole series of theorems on the laws of displacement [''d\u00e9placement''], of reversal [''retournement''] etc. I have read [[Pieter Hendrik Schoute|Schoute]], [[Bernhard Riemann|Rieman]] (sic), [[Jean-Robert Argand|Argand]], [[Victor Schlegel|Schlegel]] etc.\n\nThe actual result? A new harmony. Don't take this word harmony in its ordinary [''banal''] everyday sense, take it in its original [''primitif''] sense. Everything is number. The mind [''esprit''] hates what cannot be measured: it must be reduced and made comprehensible.\n\nThat is the secret. There in nothing more to it [''pas de reste \u00e0 l'op\u00e9ration'']. Painting, sculpture, music, architecture, ''lasting art'' is never anything more than a mathematical expression of the relations that exist between the internal and the external, the self [''le moi''] and the world.

No. Painting is a language\u2014and it has its syntax and its laws. To shake up that framework a bit to give more strength or life to what you want to say, that isn't just a right, it's a duty; but you must never lose sight of the End. The End, however, isn't the subject, nor the object, nor even the picture\u2014the End, it is the idea. (Metzinger, 26 July 1916)<ref name=\"Daniel Robbins\" /></blockquote>\n\nContinuing, Metzinger mentions the differences between himself and Juan Gris:\n<blockquote>Someone from whom I feel ever more distant is Juan Gris.

Metzinger's radical geometrization of form as an underlying architectural basis for his 1915-16 compositions is already visible in his work circa 1912-13, in paintings such as ''[[Au V\u00e9lodrome]]'' (1912) and ''[[Le Fumeur]]'' (c.1913). Where before, the perception of depth had been greatly reduced, now, the depth of field was no greater than a bas-relief.<ref name=\"Green, 1987\" />\n\nMetzinger's evolution toward synthesis has its origins in the configuration of flat squares, trapezoidal and rectangular planes that overlap and interweave, a \"new perspective\" in accord with the \"laws of displacement\". In the case of ''[[Le Fumeur]]'' Metzinger filled in these simple shapes with gradations of color, wallpaper-like patterns and rhythmic curves. So too in ''[[Au V\u00e9lodrome]]''. But the underlying armature upon which all is built is palpable. Vacating these non-essential features would lead Metzinger on a path towards ''[[Soldier at a Game of Chess]]'' (1914\u201315), and a host of other works created after the artist's demobilization as a medical orderly during the war, such as ''L'infirmi\u00e8re'' (''The Nurse'') location unknown, and ''[[Femme au miroir]]'', private collection.\n\n<blockquote>If the beauty of a painting solely depends on its pictorial qualities: only retaining certain elements, those that seem to suit our need for expression, then with these elements, building a new object, an object which we can adapt to the surface of the painting without subterfuge. If that object looks like something known, I take it increasingly for something of no use. For me it is enough for it to be \"well done\", to have a perfect accord between the parts and the whole.

Cohesion in space (composition) and cohesion in time (Corot ''in'' Gris) were presented as a single, fundamental truth\".<ref name=\"Gris\" /> Gris himself stressed the relativity and ephemerality of \"truth\" in his paintings (as a function of him) as in the world itself (as a function of society, culture and time); always susceptible to change.<ref name=\"Gris\" />\n\nFrom 1915 to late 1916, Gris transited through three different styles of Cubism, writes Green: \"starting with a solid extrapolation of the structures and materials of objects, moving into the placement of brilliant coloured dots drifting across flat signs for still-life objects, and culminating in a flattened 'chiaroscoro' realised in planar contrasts of a monochromatic palette\".<ref name=\"Gris\" />\n\nGris's works from late 1916 through 1917, more so than before, exhibit a simplification of geometric structure, a blurring of the distinction between objects and setting, between subject matter and background. The oblique overlapping planar constructions, tending away from equilibrium, can best be seen in the artists ''Woman with Mandolin, after Corot'' (September 1916) and in its epilogue ''Portrait of Josette Gris'' (October 1916).<ref name=\"Green, 1987\" />\n\n[[File:27.

Though Gris certainly had planned the representation of his chosen subject matter, the abstract armature serves as the starting point. The geometric structure of Juan Gris's Crystal period is already palpable in ''Still Life before an Open Window, Place Ravignan'' (June 1915). The overlapping elemental planar structure of the composition serves as a foundation to flatten the individual elements onto a unifying surface, foretelling the shape of things to come. In 1919 and particularly 1920, artists and critics began to write conspicuously about this 'synthetic' approach, and asserting its importance in the overall scheme of advanced Cubism.<ref name=\"Green, 1987\" />\n\nIn April 1919, following exhibitions by Laurens, Metzinger, L\u00e9ger and Braque, Gris present nearly fifty works at Rosenberg's Galerie de l'Effort moderne.<ref name=\"Gris\" /> This first [[Solo show (art exhibition)|solo exhibition]] by Gris<ref>[http://www.museothyssen.org/en/thyssen/ficha_artista/248 Juan Gris, Biography and Works, Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza]</ref><ref>[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artists/bios/1076 Juan Gris, Collection Online, Solomon R.

Returning to Paris in 1918, Csaky began a series of [[Cubist sculpture]]s derived in part from a machine-like aesthetic; streamlined with geometric and mechanical affinities. By this time Csaky's artistic vocabulary had evolved considerably from his pre-war Cubism: it was distinctly mature, showing a new, refined sculptural quality. Few works of early modern sculpture are comparable to the work Csaky produced in the years directly succeeding World War I. These were nonrepresentational freely-standing objects, i.e., abstract three-dimensional constructions combining organic and geometric elements. \"Csaky derived from nature forms which were in concordance with his passion for architecture, simple, pure, and psychologically convincing.\" (Maurice Raynal, 1929)<ref name=\"Edith Balas, 1998\">[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_0T8LAAAAIAAJ Edith Balas, 1998, ''Joseph Csaky: A Pioneer of Modern Sculpture''], Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society</ref>\n\nThe scholar Edith Balas writes of Csaky's sculpture following the war years:\n\n<blockquote>\"Cs\u00e1ky, more than anyone else working in sculpture, took Pierre Reverdy's theoretical writings on art and cubist doctrine to heart. \"Cubism is an eminently plastic art; but an art of creation, not of reproduction and interpretation.\" The artist was to take no more than \"elements\" from the external world, and intuitively arrive at the \"idea\" of objects made up of what for him constant in value. Objects were not to be analyzed; neither were the experiences they evoked. They were to be re-created in the mind, and thereby purified. By some unexplained miracle the \"pure\" forms of the mind, an entirely autonomous vocabulary, of (usual geometric) forms, would make contact with the external world.\" (Balas, 1998, p. 27)<ref name=\"Edith Balas, 1998\" /></blockquote>\n\nThese 1919 works (e.g., ''Cones and Spheres, Abstract Sculpture'', Balas, pp.&nbsp;30\u201341)<ref name=\"Edith Balas, 1998\" /> are made of juxtaposing sequences of rhythmic geometric forms, where light and shadow, mass and the void, play a key role. Though almost entirely abstract, they allude, occasionally, to the structure of the human body or modern machines, but the semblance functions only as \"elements\" (Reverdy) and are deprived of descriptive narrative.

In June 1918, Vauxcelles, writing under the pseudonym Pinturrichio, continued his attack:<ref name=\"Vauxcelles\">[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6544512p/f11.image Louis Vauxcelles (Pinturrichio), Le Carnet des ateliers, ''Le Carnet de la Semaine'', 9 June 1918, p. 9]</ref>\n<blockquote>Integral Cubism is crumbling, vanishing, evaporating.

Vauxcelles even went as far as organizing a small exhibition at the galerie Blot (late 1918) of artists that appeared to be anti-Cubist; Lhote, Rivera and Favory among them. Allies in Vauxcelles ongoing battle against Cubism included Jean-Gabriel Lemoine (''L'Intransigeant''), Roland Chavenon (''L'Information''), [[Gustave Kahn]] (''L'Heure''), and Waldemar George ({{Interlanguage link multi|Jerzy Waldemar Jarocinski|fr}}), who would soon become one of the leading post-war supporters of Cubism.<ref name=\"Green, 1987\" />\n\nInversely, once a steadfast supporter of Cubism, [[Andr\u00e9 Salmon]] in 1917-18 predicted too its demise; claiming it to have been merely a phase leading to a new art-form more closely attuned with nature. Two more former advocates of Cubism had also defected, {{Interlanguage link multi|Roger Allard|fr}} and [[Blaise Cendrars]], joining the ranks of Vauxcelles in frontline attacks on Cubism. Allard reproached the visible distancing of Cubism from the dynamism and diversity of lived experience toward a universe of purified objects.

His defense of Cubism would prove to be longer-lasting and wider-ranging than Reverdy's. His first tactical maneuver was to address a letter to ''Le Carnet de la Semaine'' denying the chimerical claim made by Vauxcelles that both Picasso and Gris had defected. Much more poignant and difficult to combat, however, was his second tactical maneuver: a succession of prominent Cubist exhibitions held at the [[L\u00e9once Rosenberg#Galerie de L'Effort Moderne|Galerie de L'Effort Moderne]], in Rosenber's [[H\u00f4tel particulier]], 19, rue de la Baume, located in the elegant and stylishly fashionable [[8th arrondissement of Paris]].<ref name=\"Green, 1987\" />\n\nThis series of large exhibitions\u2014including works created between 1914 and 1918 by almost all the major Cubists\u2014began 18 December with Cubist sculptures by Henri Laurens, followed in January 1919 with an exhibition of Cubist paintings by Jean Metzinger, Fernand L\u00e9ger in February, Georges Braque in March, Juan Gris April, Gino Severini May, and Pablo Picasso in June, marking the climax of the campaign. This well-orchestrated program showed that Cubism was still very much alive,<ref name=\"Gris\" /> and it would remain so for at least a half-decade. Missing from this sequence of exhibitions were Jacques Lipchitz (who would exhibit in 1920), and those who had left France during the Great War: Robert Delaunay and Albert Gleizes most obviously. Nonetheless, according to Christopher Green, \"this was an astonishingly complete demonstration that Cubism had not only continued between 1914 and 1917, having survived the war, but was still developing in 1918 and 1919 in its \"new collective form\" marked by \"intellectual rigor\".

These works seem to approach our current needs. The crystal is, in nature, a phenomenon that affects us most because it clearly shows the path to geometric organization. Nature sometimes shows us how forms are built through a reciprocal interplay of internal and external forces... following the theoretical forms of geometry; and man delights in these arrangements because he finds in them justification for his abstract conceptions of geometry: the spirit of man and nature find a factor of common ground, in the crystal... In true Cubism, there something organic that proceeds from the inside to the outside... The universality of the work depends on its plastic purity.

They will arrive more or less strongly depending on the oscillations of their nature, their tenacity or their concessions and analysis [''t\u00e2tonnement''] that are characteristic of artistic creation, to search for a state of clarification, condensation, firmness, intensity, synthesis; they will arrive at a true virtuosity of the game of shapes and colors, as well as a highly developed science of the composition. Overall and despite the personal coefficients, one can discern a tendency towards what might be imaged in saying: ''tendency toward the crystal''.<ref name=\"La peinture moderne\" /></blockquote>\n\nThe Crystal Cubists embraced the stability of everyday life, the enduring and the pure, but too the classical, with all that it signified respecting art and ideal. Order and clarity, right to the core of its Latin roots, was a dominant factor within the circle of Rosenberg's L'Effort moderne. While Lhote, Rivera, Ozenfant and Le Corbusier attempted to attain a compromise between the abstract and nature in their search for another Cubism, all of the Cubists shared common goals. The first, writes Green: \"that art should not be concerned with the description of nature... The rejection of [[Realism (arts)|Naturalism]] was intimately bound up with the second basic principle shared by them all: that the work of art, being not an interpretation of anything else, was something in its own right with its own laws\". These same sentiments observable from the outset of Cubism were now essential and prevailing to an extent never before seen. There was a third principle that followed from the former that came to light during the Crystal period, again according to Green: \"the principle that nature should be approached as no more than the supplier of 'elements' to be pictorially or sculpturally developed and then freely manipulated according to the laws of the medium alone\".<ref name=\"Green, 1987\" />\n\n==Gleizes==\n[[File:Albert Gleizes, 1914-15, Portrait of an Army Doctor (Portrait d'un m\u00e9decin militaire), oil on canvas, 119.8 x 95.1 cm, Solomon R.

Gleizes outlines what he perceives as the 'decadence' inherent in the modern art.</ref>\n\nContinuing, Gleizes states that the 'reality' of a painting is not that of a mirror, but of the object... issue of imminent logic (p.&nbsp;62). \"The subject-pretext tending toward numeration, inscribed following the nature of the plane, attains a tangent intersections between known images of the natural world and unknown images that reside within intuition\" (p.&nbsp;63).<ref name=\"Alibert\" /><ref name=\"La Peinture et ses lois\" />\n\n'''Defining the laws:'''<br />\nRhythm and space are for Gleizes the two vital conditions. Rhythm is a consequence of the continuity of certain phenomena, variable or invariable, following from mathematical relations. Space is a conception of the human psyche that follows from quantitative comparisons (pp.&nbsp;35, 38, 51). This mechanism  is the foundation for artistic expression. It is therefore both a philosophical and scientific synthesis. For Gleizes, Cubism was a means to arrive not only at a new mode of expression but above all a new way of thinking. This was, according to art historian {{Interlanguage link multi|Pierre Alibert (art historian)|fr|Pierre Alibert|lt=Pierre Alibert}}, the foundation of both a new species of painting and an alternative relationship with the world; hence another principle of civilization.<ref name=\"Alibert\" /><ref name=\"La Peinture et ses lois\" />\n\nThe problem set out by Gleizes was to replace ''anecdote'' as a starting point for the work of art, by the sole means of using the elements of the painting itself: line, form and color.<ref name=\"Alibert\" /><ref name=\"La Peinture et ses lois\" />\n\nBeginning with a central rectangle, taken as an example of elementary form, Gleizes points out two mechanical ways of juxtaposing form to create a painting: (1) either by reproducing the initial form (employing various [[Symmetry (geometry)|symmetries]] such as reflectional, rotational or translational), or by modifying (or not) its dimensions.<ref name=\"Alibert\" /> (2) By displacement of the initial form; pivoting around an imaginary axis in one direction or another.<ref name=\"Alibert\" /><ref name=\"La Peinture et ses lois\" />\n\nThe choice of position (through translation and/or rotation), though based on the inspiration of the artist, is no longer attributed to the anecdotal. An objective and rigorous method, independent of the painter, replaces emotion or sensibility in the determination the placement of form, that is through ''translation'' and ''rotation''.<ref name=\"Alibert\" /><ref name=\"La Peinture et ses lois\" />\n\n'''Schematic illustrations:'''<br />\n\n[[File:Albert Gleizes (after) 1.

Movements of translation of the plane to one side</div>]]\n\nSpace and rhythm, according to Gleizes, are perceptible by the extent of movement (displacement) of planar surfaces. These elemental transformations modify the position and importance of the initial plane, whether they converge or diverge ('recede' or 'advance') from the eye, creating a series of new and separate spatial planes appreciable physiologically by the observer.<ref name=\"Alibert\" /><ref name=\"La Peinture et ses lois\" />\n\n[[File:Albert Gleizes (after) 2.

Fig II and Fig. III represent the simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the rectangle, inclined to the right and to the left.

The planar surfaces of Fig. VIII are filled with hatching espousing the 'direction' of the planes. What emerges in the inert plane, according to Gleizes, through the movement followed by the eye of the observer, is \"a visible imprint of successive stages of which the initial rhythmic cadence coordinated a succession of differing states\". These successive stages permit the perception of space. The initial state, by consequence of the transformation, has become a spatial and rhythmic organism.<ref name=\"Alibert\" /><ref name=\"La Peinture et ses lois\" />\n\n[[File:Albert Gleizes (after) 4.

It is not surprising, therefore, to find a continuity in the development of Cubist art as the transition was made from war to peace, an unbroken commitment to the Latin virtues along with an unbroken commitment to the aesthetically pure. The new Cubism that emerged, the Cubism of Picasso, Laurens, Gris, Metzinger and Lipchitz most obviously of all, has come to be known as \"crystal Cubism\". It was indeed the end-product of a progressive closing down of possibilities in the name of a \"call to order\". (Christopher Green, 1987, p. 37)<ref name=\"Green, 1987\" /><ref name=\"Inside Modernism\" /></blockquote>\n\nMore so than the pre-war Cubist period, the Crystal Cubist period has been described by Green as the most important in the history of [[Modernism]]:\n<blockquote>In terms of a Modernist will to aesthetic isolation and of the broad theme of the separation of culture and society, it is actually Cubism ''after'' 1914 that emerges as most important to the history of Modernism, and especially... Cubism between around 1916 and around 1924... Only after 1914 did Cubism come almost exclusively to be identified with a single-minded insistence on the isolation of the art-object in a special category with its own laws and its own experience to offer, a category considered above life. It is Cubism in this later period that has most to tell anyone concerned with the problems of Modernism and post-modernism now, because it was only then that issues emerged with real clarity in and around Cubism which are closely comparable with those that emerged in and around Anglo-American Modernism in the sixties and after. (Green, 1987, Introduction, p. 1)<ref name=\"Green, 1987\" /></blockquote>\n\nArt historian Peter Brooke has commented on Crystal Cubism, and more generally on the Salon Cubists: \n:\"A general history of Salon Cubism, however, still needs to be written, a history that could be extended to include the wonderful collective phenomenon which Christopher Green has called 'Crystal Cubism' \u2014 the highly structured work of the Cubist painters... who remained in Paris during the war, most notably Metzinger and Gris. An opening up of this early Cubism in all its intellectual fullness would... reveal it as being not only the most radical movement in painting of the past century but, still, the most rich in possibilities for the future\".

Yet they discovered a ubiquitous link between the Cubist syntax (beyond pre-war attitudes) and that of the anonymity and novelty of mechanized warfare. Cubism evolved as much a result of an ''evasion'' of the inconceivable atrocities of war as of nationalistic pressures.

It is not the materialist perspective of Gris, nor the romantic perspective of Picasso. It is rather a metaphysical perspective\u2014I take full responsibility for the word. You can't begin to imagine what I've found out since the beginning of the war, working outside painting but for painting. The geometry of the fourth space has no more secret for me. Previously I had only intuitions, now I have certainty. I have made a whole series of theorems on the laws of displacement [''d\u00e9placement''], of reversal [''retournement''] etc. I have read [[Pieter Hendrik Schoute|Schoute]], [[Bernhard Riemann|Rieman]] (sic), [[Jean-Robert Argand|Argand]], [[Victor Schlegel|Schlegel]] etc.\n\nThe actual result? A new harmony. Don't take this word harmony in its ordinary [''banal''] everyday sense, take it in its original [''primitif''] sense. Everything is number. The mind [''esprit''] hates what cannot be measured: it must be reduced and made comprehensible.\n\nThat is the secret. There in nothing more to it [''pas de reste \u00e0 l'op\u00e9ration''].

No. Painting is a language\u2014and it has its syntax and its laws. To shake up that framework a bit to give more strength or life to what you want to say, that isn't just a right, it's a duty; but you must never lose sight of the End. The End, however, isn't the subject, nor the object, nor even the picture\u2014the End, it is the idea.

Metzinger's radical geometrization of form as an underlying architectural basis for his 1915-16 compositions is already visible in his work circa 1912-13, in paintings such as ''[[Au V\u00e9lodrome]]'' (1912) and ''[[Le Fumeur]]'' (c.1913). Where before, the perception of depth had been greatly reduced, now, the depth of field was no greater than a bas-relief.<ref name=\"Green, 1987\" />\n\nMetzinger's evolution toward synthesis has its origins in the configuration of flat squares, trapezoidal and rectangular planes that overlap and interweave, a \"new perspective\" in accord with the \"laws of displacement\". In the case of ''[[Le Fumeur]]'' Metzinger filled in these simple shapes with gradations of color, wallpaper-like patterns and rhythmic curves. So too in ''[[Au V\u00e9lodrome]]''. But the underlying armature upon which all is built is palpable. Vacating these non-essential features would lead Metzinger on a path towards ''[[Soldier at a Game of Chess]]'' (1914\u201315), and a host of other works created after the artist's demobilization as a medical orderly during the war, such as ''L'infirmi\u00e8re'' (''The Nurse'') location unknown, and ''[[Femme au miroir]]'', private collection.\n\n<blockquote>If the beauty of a painting solely depends on its pictorial qualities: only retaining certain elements, those that seem to suit our need for expression, then with these elements, building a new object, an object which we can adapt to the surface of the painting without subterfuge. If that object looks like something known, I take it increasingly for something of no use. For me it is enough for it to be \"well done\", to have a perfect accord between the parts and the whole.

These works set the tone for his quest of an ideal unity for the next five years.<ref name=\"Gris\" />\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header    =\n | header_horizontal = left/right/center\n | header_background =\n | footer    =\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width     = \n| image1    = Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, 1860\u201365, Girl with Mandolin, oil on canvas, 51.4 x 40.3 cm, Saint Louis Art Museum (cropped).jpg\n | width1    = 180\n | caption1  = [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]], 1860-65, ''Girl with Mandolin'' (''Femme \u00e0 la mandoline''), oil on canvas, 51.4 x 40.3 cm, [[Saint Louis Art Museum]] (detail)\n | alt1      =\n | image2    =Juan Gris, 1916, Woman with Mandolin, after Corot (La femme \u00e0 la mandoline, d'apr\u00e8s Corot), oil on canvas, 92 x 60 cm, Kunstmuseum Basel.jpg\n | width2    = 180\n | caption2  = [[Juan Gris]], September 1916, ''Woman with Mandolin, after Corot'' (''La femme \u00e0 la mandoline, d'apr\u00e8s Corot''), oil on canvas, 92 x 60 cm, [[Kunstmuseum Basel]]\n | alt2      =\n}}\n\"These themes of pictorial architecture and the \"constants\" of tradition were consolidated and integrated\", writes Green ''et al''; \"The inference was there to be drawn: to restore tradition was to restore not only an old subject-matter in new terms, but to find the unchanging principles of structure in painting. Cohesion in space (composition) and cohesion in time (Corot ''in'' Gris) were presented as a single, fundamental truth\".<ref name=\"Gris\" /> Gris himself stressed the relativity and ephemerality of \"truth\" in his paintings (as a function of him) as in the world itself (as a function of society, culture and time); always susceptible to change.<ref name=\"Gris\" />\n\nFrom 1915 to late 1916, Gris transited through three different styles of Cubism, writes Green: \"starting with a solid extrapolation of the structures and materials of objects, moving into the placement of brilliant coloured dots drifting across flat signs for still-life objects, and culminating in a flattened 'chiaroscoro' realised in planar contrasts of a monochromatic palette\".<ref name=\"Gris\" />\n\nGris's works from late 1916 through 1917, more so than before, exhibit a simplification of geometric structure, a blurring of the distinction between objects and setting, between subject matter and background. The oblique overlapping planar constructions, tending away from equilibrium, can best be seen in the artists ''Woman with Mandolin, after Corot'' (September 1916) and in its epilogue ''Portrait of Josette Gris'' (October 1916).<ref name=\"Green, 1987\" />\n\n[[File:27.

Though Gris certainly had planned the representation of his chosen subject matter, the abstract armature serves as the starting point. The geometric structure of Juan Gris's Crystal period is already palpable in ''Still Life before an Open Window, Place Ravignan'' (June 1915). The overlapping elemental planar structure of the composition serves as a foundation to flatten the individual elements onto a unifying surface, foretelling the shape of things to come. In 1919 and particularly 1920, artists and critics began to write conspicuously about this 'synthetic' approach, and asserting its importance in the overall scheme of advanced Cubism.<ref name=\"Green, 1987\" />\n\nIn April 1919, following exhibitions by Laurens, Metzinger, L\u00e9ger and Braque, Gris present nearly fifty works at Rosenberg's Galerie de l'Effort moderne.<ref name=\"Gris\" /> This first [[Solo show (art exhibition)|solo exhibition]] by Gris<ref>[http://www.museothyssen.org/en/thyssen/ficha_artista/248 Juan Gris, Biography and Works, Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza]</ref><ref>[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artists/bios/1076 Juan Gris, Collection Online, Solomon R.

Returning to Paris in 1918, Csaky began a series of [[Cubist sculpture]]s derived in part from a machine-like aesthetic; streamlined with geometric and mechanical affinities. By this time Csaky's artistic vocabulary had evolved considerably from his pre-war Cubism: it was distinctly mature, showing a new, refined sculptural quality. Few works of early modern sculpture are comparable to the work Csaky produced in the years directly succeeding World War I. These were nonrepresentational freely-standing objects, i.e., abstract three-dimensional constructions combining organic and geometric elements. \"Csaky derived from nature forms which were in concordance with his passion for architecture, simple, pure, and psychologically convincing.\" (Maurice Raynal, 1929)<ref name=\"Edith Balas, 1998\">[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_0T8LAAAAIAAJ Edith Balas, 1998, ''Joseph Csaky: A Pioneer of Modern Sculpture''], Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society</ref>\n\nThe scholar Edith Balas writes of Csaky's sculpture following the war years:\n\n<blockquote>\"Cs\u00e1ky, more than anyone else working in sculpture, took Pierre Reverdy's theoretical writings on art and cubist doctrine to heart. \"Cubism is an eminently plastic art; but an art of creation, not of reproduction and interpretation.\" The artist was to take no more than \"elements\" from the external world, and intuitively arrive at the \"idea\" of objects made up of what for him constant in value. Objects were not to be analyzed; neither were the experiences they evoked. They were to be re-created in the mind, and thereby purified. By some unexplained miracle the \"pure\" forms of the mind, an entirely autonomous vocabulary, of (usual geometric) forms, would make contact with the external world.\" (Balas, 1998, p. 27)<ref name=\"Edith Balas, 1998\" /></blockquote>\n\nThese 1919 works (e.g., ''Cones and Spheres, Abstract Sculpture'', Balas, pp.&nbsp;30\u201341)<ref name=\"Edith Balas, 1998\" /> are made of juxtaposing sequences of rhythmic geometric forms, where light and shadow, mass and the void, play a key role. Though almost entirely abstract, they allude, occasionally, to the structure of the human body or modern machines, but the semblance functions only as \"elements\" (Reverdy) and are deprived of descriptive narrative. Csaky's polychrome reliefs of the early 1920s display an affinity with [[Purism (arts)|Purism]]\u2014an extreme form of the Cubism aesthetic developing at the time\u2014in their rigorous economy of architectonic symbols and the use of crystalline geometric structures.<ref name=\"Edith Balas, 1998\" />\n\nCsaky's ''Deux figures'', 1920, [[Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller Museum]], employs broad planar surfaces accented by descriptive linear elements comparable to Georges Valmier's work of the following year (''Figure'' 1921).<ref>[http://jpdubs.hautetfort.com/archive/2007/04/04/cubisme.html Georges Valmier, ''Figure'', 1921, oil on canvas, 97.1 x 74.9 cm]</ref> Csaky's influences were drawn more from the [[art of ancient Egypt]] rather than from French [[Neoclassicism]].<ref name=\"Green, 1987\" />\n\n[[File:Jacques Lipchitz, 1918, Le Guitariste (The Guitar Player).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jacques Lipchitz]], 1918, ''Le Guitariste'' (''The Guitar Player'')]]\nWith this intense flurry of activity, Csaky was taken on by [[L\u00e9once Rosenberg]], and exhibited regularly at the Galerie l'Effort Moderne.

Allies in Vauxcelles ongoing battle against Cubism included Jean-Gabriel Lemoine (''L'Intransigeant''), Roland Chavenon (''L'Information''), [[Gustave Kahn]] (''L'Heure''), and Waldemar George ({{Interlanguage link multi|Jerzy Waldemar Jarocinski|fr}}), who would soon become one of the leading post-war supporters of Cubism.<ref name=\"Green, 1987\" />\n\nInversely, once a steadfast supporter of Cubism, [[Andr\u00e9 Salmon]] in 1917-18 predicted too its demise; claiming it to have been merely a phase leading to a new art-form more closely attuned with nature. Two more former advocates of Cubism had also defected, {{Interlanguage link multi|Roger Allard|fr}} and [[Blaise Cendrars]], joining the ranks of Vauxcelles in frontline attacks on Cubism. Allard reproached the visible distancing of Cubism from the dynamism and diversity of lived experience toward a universe of purified objects.

His defense of Cubism would prove to be longer-lasting and wider-ranging than Reverdy's. His first tactical maneuver was to address a letter to ''Le Carnet de la Semaine'' denying the chimerical claim made by Vauxcelles that both Picasso and Gris had defected. Much more poignant and difficult to combat, however, was his second tactical maneuver: a succession of prominent Cubist exhibitions held at the [[L\u00e9once Rosenberg#Galerie de L'Effort Moderne|Galerie de L'Effort Moderne]], in Rosenber's [[H\u00f4tel particulier]], 19, rue de la Baume, located in the elegant and stylishly fashionable [[8th arrondissement of Paris]].<ref name=\"Green, 1987\" />\n\nThis series of large exhibitions\u2014including works created between 1914 and 1918 by almost all the major Cubists\u2014began 18 December with Cubist sculptures by Henri Laurens, followed in January 1919 with an exhibition of Cubist paintings by Jean Metzinger, Fernand L\u00e9ger in February, Georges Braque in March, Juan Gris April, Gino Severini May, and Pablo Picasso in June, marking the climax of the campaign. This well-orchestrated program showed that Cubism was still very much alive,<ref name=\"Gris\" /> and it would remain so for at least a half-decade. Missing from this sequence of exhibitions were Jacques Lipchitz (who would exhibit in 1920), and those who had left France during the Great War: Robert Delaunay and Albert Gleizes most obviously. Nonetheless, according to Christopher Green, \"this was an astonishingly complete demonstration that Cubism had not only continued between 1914 and 1917, having survived the war, but was still developing in 1918 and 1919 in its \"new collective form\" marked by \"intellectual rigor\". In the face of such a display of vigour, it really was difficult to maintain convincingly that Cubism was even close to extinction\".<ref name=\"Green, 1987\" />\n\n<gallery widths=\"145px\" heights=\"110px\">\nFile:Auguste Herbin, invitation, Galerie de L\u2019Effort Moderne, March 1918.jpg|Auguste Herbin, Galerie de L\u2019Effort Moderne, March 1918\nFile:Jean Metzinger, invitation card, L\u00e9once Rosenberg, Galerie de L'Effort Moderne, January 1919.jpg|Jean Metzinger, Galerie de L\u2019Effort Moderne, January 1919\nFile:Fernand L\u00e9ger, invitation, Galerie de L\u2019Effort Moderne, February 1919.jpg|Fernand L\u00e9ger, Galerie de L\u2019Effort Moderne, February 1919\nFile:Georges Braque, invitation, Galerie de L'Effort Moderne, March 1919.jpg|Georges Braque, Galerie de L'Effort Moderne, March 1919\nFile:Juan Gris, invitation, galerie L'Effort Moderne, L\u00e9once Rosenberg, April 1919.jpg|Juan Gris, Galerie L'Effort Moderne, April 1919\nFile:L\u00e9opold Survage, invitation, Galerie de L\u2019Effort Moderne, November 1920.jpg|L\u00e9opold Survage, Galerie de L\u2019Effort Moderne, November 1920\nFile:Joseph Csaky, Exhibition poster, Galerie L\u00e9once Rosenberg, 1920.jpg|Joseph Csaky, Galerie de L'Effort Moderne, December 1920\nFile:Georges Valmier, invitation, Galerie de L\u2019Effort Moderne, January 1921.jpg|Georges Valmier, Galerie de L\u2019Effort Moderne, January 1921\n</gallery>\n\n{{centered pull quote|Cubism has not ended, in humanizing itself it holds its promises.

These works seem to approach our current needs. The crystal is, in nature, a phenomenon that affects us most because it clearly shows the path to geometric organization. Nature sometimes shows us how forms are built through a reciprocal interplay of internal and external forces... following the theoretical forms of geometry; and man delights in these arrangements because he finds in them justification for his abstract conceptions of geometry: the spirit of man and nature find a factor of common ground, in the crystal... In true Cubism, there something organic that proceeds from the inside to the outside... The universality of the work depends on its plastic purity.

They will arrive more or less strongly depending on the oscillations of their nature, their tenacity or their concessions and analysis [''t\u00e2tonnement''] that are characteristic of artistic creation, to search for a state of clarification, condensation, firmness, intensity, synthesis; they will arrive at a true virtuosity of the game of shapes and colors, as well as a highly developed science of the composition. Overall and despite the personal coefficients, one can discern a tendency towards what might be imaged in saying: ''tendency toward the crystal''.<ref name=\"La peinture moderne\" /></blockquote>\n\nThe Crystal Cubists embraced the stability of everyday life, the enduring and the pure, but too the classical, with all that it signified respecting art and ideal. Order and clarity, right to the core of its Latin roots, was a dominant factor within the circle of Rosenberg's L'Effort moderne. While Lhote, Rivera, Ozenfant and Le Corbusier attempted to attain a compromise between the abstract and nature in their search for another Cubism, all of the Cubists shared common goals. The first, writes Green: \"that art should not be concerned with the description of nature... The rejection of [[Realism (arts)|Naturalism]] was intimately bound up with the second basic principle shared by them all: that the work of art, being not an interpretation of anything else, was something in its own right with its own laws\". These same sentiments observable from the outset of Cubism were now essential and prevailing to an extent never before seen. There was a third principle that followed from the former that came to light during the Crystal period, again according to Green: \"the principle that nature should be approached as no more than the supplier of 'elements' to be pictorially or sculpturally developed and then freely manipulated according to the laws of the medium alone\".<ref name=\"Green, 1987\" />\n\n==Gleizes==\n[[File:Albert Gleizes, 1914-15, Portrait of an Army Doctor (Portrait d'un m\u00e9decin militaire), oil on canvas, 119.8 x 95.1 cm, Solomon R.

Gleizes outlines what he perceives as the 'decadence' inherent in the modern art.</ref>\n\nContinuing, Gleizes states that the 'reality' of a painting is not that of a mirror, but of the object... issue of imminent logic (p.&nbsp;62). \"The subject-pretext tending toward numeration, inscribed following the nature of the plane, attains a tangent intersections between known images of the natural world and unknown images that reside within intuition\" (p.&nbsp;63).<ref name=\"Alibert\" /><ref name=\"La Peinture et ses lois\" />\n\n'''Defining the laws:'''<br />\nRhythm and space are for Gleizes the two vital conditions. Rhythm is a consequence of the continuity of certain phenomena, variable or invariable, following from mathematical relations. Space is a conception of the human psyche that follows from quantitative comparisons (pp.&nbsp;35, 38, 51). This mechanism  is the foundation for artistic expression. It is therefor both a philosophical and scientific synthesis. For Gleizes, Cubism was a means to arrive not only at a new mode of expression but above all a new way of thinking. This was, according to art historian {{Interlanguage link multi|Pierre Alibert (art historian)|fr|Pierre Alibert|lt=Pierre Alibert}}, the foundation of both a new species of painting and an alternative relationship with the world; hence another principle of civilization.<ref name=\"Alibert\" /><ref name=\"La Peinture et ses lois\" />\n\nThe problem set out by Gleizes was to replace ''anecdote'' as a starting point for the work of art, by the sole means of using the elements of the painting itself: line, form and color.<ref name=\"Alibert\" /><ref name=\"La Peinture et ses lois\" />\n\nBeginning with a central rectangle, taken as an example of elementary form, Gleizes points out two mechanical ways of juxtaposing form to create a painting: (1) either by reproducing the initial form (employing various [[Symmetry (geometry)|symmetries]] such as reflectional, rotational or translational), or by modifying (or not) its dimensions.<ref name=\"Alibert\" /> (2) By displacement of the initial form; pivoting around an imaginary axis in one direction or another.<ref name=\"Alibert\" /><ref name=\"La Peinture et ses lois\" />\n\nThe choice of position (through translation and/or rotation), though based on the inspiration of the artist, is no longer attributed to the anecdotal. An objective and rigorous method, independent of the painter, replaces emotion or sensibility in the determination the placement of form, that is through ''translation'' and ''rotation''.<ref name=\"Alibert\" /><ref name=\"La Peinture et ses lois\" />\n\n'''Schematic illustrations:'''<br />\n\n[[File:Albert Gleizes (after) 1.

These elemental transformations modify the position and importance of the initial plane, whether they converge or diverge ('recede' or 'advance') from the eye, creating a series of new and separate spatial planes appreciable physiologically by the observer.<ref name=\"Alibert\" /><ref name=\"La Peinture et ses lois\" />\n\n[[File:Albert Gleizes (after) 2.

The axis point at which movement is realized is established by the observer. Fig. IV represents the simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the rectangle plane, with the position of the eye of the observed displaced left of the axis. Displacement toward the right (though not represented) is straightforward enough to imagine.<ref name=\"Alibert\" /><ref name=\"La Peinture et ses lois\" />\n\n[[File:Albert Gleizes (after) 3.

Simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane resulting in the creation of a spatial and rhythmic plastic organism</div>]]\n\nWith these figures Gleizes attempts to present, under the most simple conditions possible (simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane), the creation of a spatial and rhythmic organism (Fig. VIII), with practically no initiative taken on the part of the artist who controls the evolutionary process. The planar surfaces of Fig. VIII are filled with hatching espousing the 'direction' of the planes. What emerges in the inert plane, according to Gleizes, through the movement followed by the eye of the observer, is \"a visible imprint of successive stages of which the initial rhythmic cadence coordinated a succession of differing states\". These successive stages permit the perception of space. The initial state, by consequence of the transformation, has become a spatial and rhythmic organism.<ref name=\"Alibert\" /><ref name=\"La Peinture et ses lois\" />\n\n[[File:Albert Gleizes (after) 4.

The result is a spatial and rhythmic organism more ''complex'' than shown in Fig. VIII; demonstrating through mechanical, purely plastic means, the realization of a material universe independent of intentional intervention by the artist.

It is not surprising, therefore, to find a continuity in the development of Cubist art as the transition was made from war to peace, an unbroken commitment to the Latin virtues along with an unbroken commitment to the aesthetically pure. The new Cubism that emerged, the Cubism of Picasso, Laurens, Gris, Metzinger and Lipchitz most obviously of all, has come to be known as \"crystal Cubism\". It was indeed the end-product of a progressive closing down of possibilities in the name of a \"call to order\". (Christopher Green, 1987, p. 37)<ref name=\"Green, 1987\" /><ref name=\"Inside Modernism\" /></blockquote>\n\nMore so than the pre-war Cubist period, the Crystal Cubist period has been described by Green as the most important in the history of [[Modernism]]:\n<blockquote>In terms of a Modernist will to aesthetic isolation and of the broad theme of the separation of culture and society, it is actually Cubism ''after'' 1914 that emerges as most important to the history of Modernism, and especially... Cubism between around 1916 and around 1924... Only after 1914 did Cubism come almost exclusively to be identified with a single-minded insistence on the isolation of the art-object in a special category with its own laws and its own experience to offer, a category considered above life. It is Cubism in this later period that has most to tell anyone concerned with the problems of Modernism and post-modernism now, because it was only then that issues emerged with real clarity in and around Cubism which are closely comparable with those that emerged in and around Anglo-American Modernism in the sixties and after. (Green, 1987, Introduction, p. 1)<ref name=\"Green, 1987\" /></blockquote>\n\nArt historian Peter Brooke has commented on Crystal Cubism, and more generally on the Salon Cubists: \n:\"A general history of Salon Cubism, however, still needs to be written, a history that could be extended to include the wonderful collective phenomenon which Christopher Green has called 'Crystal Cubism' \u2014 the highly structured work of the Cubist painters... who remained in Paris during the war, most notably Metzinger and Gris. An opening up of this early Cubism in all its intellectual fullness would... reveal it as being not only the most radical movement in painting of the past century but, still, the most rich in possibilities for the future\".

It runs from [[Bowdoin (MBTA station)|Bowdoin station]] in downtown Boston under [[Boston Harbor]] to [[East Boston]] and [[Revere, Massachusetts|Revere]] on the inner North Shore, where it terminates at [[Wonderland (MBTA station)|Wonderland]]. The stop at [[Airport Station (MBTA)|Airport Station]], by way of a free shuttle bus, is one of two rapid transit connections to [[Logan International Airport]]. In 1967, during a systemwide rebranding, the line was assigned the blue color because it passes under the [[Boston Harbor]].<ref name=netransit /><ref name=chronicle/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mbta.com/uploadedfiles/Smart_Forms/News,_Events_and_Press_Releases/Curiosity_Carcard-opt9a-FINAL.pdf |title=Curiosity Carcards |publisher=Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority}}</ref> With an end-to-end travel time of less than twenty minutes, the Blue Line is the shortest of Boston's heavy-rail lines and the only line to have both third rail and overhead catenary sections.\n\nThe East Boston Tunnel was built as a streetcar tunnel in 1904 with [[Howard Adams Carson|Howard A. Carson]] as chief engineer; after an extension to Bowdoin in 1916, it was converted to heavy rail metro rolling stock in 1924. In 1952 and 1954 the line was extended along the former route of the [[Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad]], in a project intended to reach [[Lynn (MBTA station)|Lynn]] but ultimately cut short to Wonderland. Further extensions to Lynn and [[Charles/MGH (MBTA station)|Charles/MGH]] downtown are long-planned but not yet funded. From approximately 1998-2011, the MBTA made most Blue Line stations fully accessible as part of a larger effort to accommodate 6-car trains on the line. {{As of|2018}}, the only station in service on the Blue Line which is not fully accessible is the downtown Boston terminus Bowdoin.\n\n==History==\n{{anchor|History}}\n[[File:PostcardBostonMAEastBostonTunnel1906.jpg|left|thumb|A streetcar at Atlantic Avenue (now Aquarium) station in 1906]]\n[[File:East Boston Tunnel - Cambridge Street Portal.jpg|thumb|left|Joy Street Portal in 1915, looking eastwards]]\n{{see also|History of the MBTA}}\nThe '''East Boston Tunnel''' under [[Boston Harbor]] was the first North American subway tunnel to run beneath a body of water when it opened in 1904.<ref name=nycsubway>{{cite web |url=http://world.nycsubway.org/us/boston/blue.html |title=MBTA Blue Line|accessdate=February 21, 2008 |work=NYCsubway.org}}</ref> and the second underwater vehicular tunnel of significant length built in the United States.<ref name=\"Cudahy\" />{{rp|30}} The tunnel was constructed using a modified version of the [[Tunnelling shield|Greathead Shield]]; {{convert|2700|ft|m}} of the {{convert|1|mi|km}} tunnel is actually under water.<ref name=\"Cudahy\" />{{rp|30}} The excavation took two-and-a-half years, and cost $3 million and the lives of four workmen.<ref name=\"Cudahy\" />{{rp|30}}\n\nInitially designed to carry [[Light rail|streetcar]]s, the tunnel ran from Maverick Square in East Boston to downtown Boston's Court Street station, with an intermediate stop at Devonshire (now State).

Court Street proved to be a problematic terminus as its single-track design limited frequent service.\n\nThe [[Boston Elevated Railway]] (BERy) began an extension towards Beacon Hill in 1912.<ref name=century>{{cite book |title=Tremont Street Subway: A Century of Public Service |last1=Clarke |first1=Bradley H. |last2=Cummings |first2=O.R. |year=1997 |publisher=Boston Street Railway Association |isbn=0938315048 |pages= }}</ref>{{rp|39}} This downtown extension was opened to Bowdoin, with an intermediate stop at [[Scollay Under (BERy station)|Scollay Under]] (now Government Center), on March 18, 1916.<ref name=nycsubway/> Immediately west of the new Bowdoin station platforms, a tight turnaround loop track underground allowed trains to quickly reverse direction for the return trip.

A new, four track station and two loops were constructed under Maverick Square in East Boston.{{when|date=October 2019}} The station was constructed while passenger service through the East Boston Tunnel was maintained. The new Maverick station would have the local East Boston streetcars enter the incline as always, but would stop inside the new station. All of the passengers would disembark the trolleys and cross the platform to the waiting rapid transit trains. A loop was provided west of the station for the trolleys to turn around and return to the outbound side of the station. The rapid transit trains would return to Boston via a loop on the eastern side of the station. A short extension of the tunnel beyond the east loop provided train storage and a couple of inspection pits for light maintenance.\n\nOver the weekend of April 18 to 21, 1924, the East Boston Tunnel was converted from streetcar use to [[railway platform height|high platform]] [[rapid transit]], a tightly-staged changeover which had been in planning for three years, requiring 1500 men to complete.<ref name=\"Cudahy\" />{{rp|30}} Rather than modify the narrow tunnel, the BERy elected to replace the streetcars with brand-new smaller-than-usual high-platform rapid transit cars which could operate in tight clearances\u2014particularly around the tight loop at Bowdoin.<ref name=\"Cudahy\" />{{rp|32}} Blue Line cars are thus {{convert|48.5|feet}} long, substantially shorter than the {{convert|65|feet|adj=on}} [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]] cars and the {{convert|69.5|feet|adj=on}} [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] cars.<ref name=roster>{{cite web|url=http://www.transithistory.org/roster/ |title=The MBTA Vehicle Inventory Page |publisher=NETransit |date=February 12, 2016 |accessdate=February 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1952 to 1954, a surface-level extension was constructed along the recently-defunct [[Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad]], from Maverick to the current terminus at Wonderland.

However, these transfers require passengers to navigate multiple passages and staircases and increase rush-hour congestion on subway lines in the Downtown subway stations, contributing to delays in subway service. \n\nAs part of a lawsuit settlement relating to air quality mitigation for the [[Big Dig]] highway tunnel project, the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] agreed to build a direct transfer connection between the Blue and Red Lines. The Blue Line would be extended beyond [[Bowdoin (MBTA station)|Bowdoin]] station, continuing {{convert|1500|ft|m}} beneath Cambridge Street to a new underground terminal at [[Charles/MGH (MBTA station)|Charles/MGH]], connecting to the existing elevated Red Line station. In addition to providing a direct transfer between the Red and Blue Lines, this would allow passengers from the North Shore of Boston to reach the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] area without needing to transfer.

Railcars from what is today the Blue Line could emerge from a ramp portal surfacing between Joy Street and Russell Street, just beyond [[Bowdoin (MBTA station)|Bowdoin]] station. The railcars would run on former streetcar track down Cambridge Street and then most of the distance to the western end of the [[Longfellow Bridge]], connecting to what is now the Red Line just east of its Cambridge Subway portal, near what is now [[Kendall/MIT (MBTA station)|Kendall/MIT]] station. Because the tracks were unpowered, individual cars had to be towed along the street at night. This connection was never used in [[Passenger train|passenger]] service, but was used to transport Blue Line cars to the Eliot Street Yard maintenance shops then located near [[Harvard Square (MBTA station)|Harvard Square]] station.<ref name=\"Cudahy\"/>{{rp|32}} When the Blue Line eventually got its own maintenance shops, the connection was removed and the ramp portal was permanently covered in 1952.<ref name=\"nycsubway\"/><ref name= Cudahy >{{cite book|last=Cudahy|first=Brian J.|title=Change at Park Street Under; the story of Boston's subways|year=1972|publisher=S.

It runs from [[Bowdoin (MBTA station)|Bowdoin station]] in downtown Boston under [[Boston Harbor]] to [[East Boston]] and [[Revere, Massachusetts|Revere]] on the inner North Shore, where it terminates at [[Wonderland (MBTA station)|Wonderland]]. The stop at [[Airport Station (MBTA)|Airport Station]], by way of a free shuttle bus, is one of two rapid transit connections to [[Logan International Airport]]. In 1967, during a systemwide rebranding, the line was assigned the blue color because it passes under the [[Boston Harbor]].<ref name=netransit /><ref name=chronicle/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mbta.com/uploadedfiles/Smart_Forms/News,_Events_and_Press_Releases/Curiosity_Carcard-opt9a-FINAL.pdf |title=Curiosity Carcards |publisher=Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority}}</ref> With an end-to-end travel time of less than twenty minutes, the Blue Line is the shortest of Boston's heavy-rail lines and the only line to have both third rail and overhead catenary sections.\n\nThe East Boston Tunnel was built as a streetcar tunnel in 1904 with [[Howard Adams Carson|Howard A. Carson]] as chief engineer; after an extension to Bowdoin in 1916, it was converted to heavy rail metro rolling stock in 1924. In 1952 and 1954 the line was extended along the former route of the [[Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad]], in a project intended to reach [[Lynn (MBTA station)|Lynn]] but ultimately cut short to Wonderland. Further extensions to Lynn and [[Charles/MGH (MBTA station)|Charles/MGH]] downtown are long-planned but not yet funded. From approximately 1998-2011, the MBTA made most Blue Line stations fully accessible as part of a larger effort to accommodate 6-car trains on the line. {{As of|2018}}, the only station in service on the Blue Line which is not fully accessible is the downtown Boston terminus Bowdoin.\n\n==History==\n{{anchor|History}}\n[[File:PostcardBostonMAEastBostonTunnel1906.jpg|left|thumb|A streetcar at Atlantic Avenue (now Aquarium) station in 1906]]\n[[File:East Boston Tunnel - Cambridge Street Portal.jpg|thumb|left|Joy Street Portal in 1915, looking eastwards]]\n{{see also|History of the MBTA}}\nThe '''East Boston Tunnel''' under [[Boston Harbor]] was the first North American subway tunnel to run beneath a body of water when it opened in 1904.<ref name=nycsubway>{{cite web |url=http://world.nycsubway.org/us/boston/blue.html |title=MBTA Blue Line|accessdate=February 21, 2008 |work=NYCsubway.org}}</ref> and the second underwater vehicular tunnel of significant length built in the United States.<ref name=\"Cudahy\" />{{rp|30}} The tunnel was constructed using a modified version of the [[Tunnelling shield|Greathead Shield]]; {{convert|2700|ft|m}} of the {{convert|1|mi|km}} tunnel is actually under water.<ref name=\"Cudahy\" />{{rp|30}} The excavation took two-and-a-half years, and cost $3 million and the lives of four workmen.<ref name=\"Cudahy\" />{{rp|30}}\n\nInitially designed to carry [[Light rail|streetcar]]s, the tunnel ran from Maverick Square in East Boston to downtown Boston's Court Street station, with an intermediate stop at Devonshire (now State). Court Street had pedestrian access to Scollay Square station (now Government Center) but transfers to the East Boston Tunnel required an additional fare of 1 cent.<ref name=nycsubway/> In 1906, Atlantic Station (now Aquarium) was opened, with a connection to the [[Atlantic Avenue Elevated]]. Court Street proved to be a problematic terminus as its single-track design limited frequent service.\n\nThe [[Boston Elevated Railway]] (BERy) began an extension towards Beacon Hill in 1912.<ref name=century>{{cite book |title=Tremont Street Subway: A Century of Public Service |last1=Clarke |first1=Bradley H. |last2=Cummings |first2=O.R. |year=1997 |publisher=Boston Street Railway Association |isbn=0938315048 |pages= }}</ref>{{rp|39}} This downtown extension was opened to Bowdoin, with an intermediate stop at [[Scollay Under (BERy station)|Scollay Under]] (now Government Center), on March 18, 1916.<ref name=nycsubway/> Immediately west of the new Bowdoin station platforms, a tight turnaround loop track underground allowed trains to quickly reverse direction for the return trip. An incline leading to a new portal at Joy Street was also installed at this time.<ref name=\"Cudahy\" />{{rp|31}} The total cost of this extension was $2.3 million.<ref name=\"Cudahy\" />{{rp|31}}\n\nIncreasing passenger loads soon required a further expansion of the carrying capacity of the harbor crossing. A new, four track station and two loops were constructed under Maverick Square in East Boston.{{when|date=October 2019}} The station was constructed while passenger service through the East Boston Tunnel was maintained. The new Maverick station would have the local East Boston streetcars enter the incline as always, but would stop inside the new station. All of the passengers would disembark the trolleys and cross the platform to the waiting rapid transit trains. A loop was provided west of the station for the trolleys to turn around and return to the outbound side of the station. The rapid transit trains would return to Boston via a loop on the eastern side of the station. A short extension of the tunnel beyond the east loop provided train storage and a couple of inspection pits for light maintenance.\n\nOver the weekend of April 18 to 21, 1924, the East Boston Tunnel was converted from streetcar use to [[railway platform height|high platform]] [[rapid transit]], a tightly-staged changeover which had been in planning for three years, requiring 1500 men to complete.<ref name=\"Cudahy\" />{{rp|30}} Rather than modify the narrow tunnel, the BERy elected to replace the streetcars with brand-new smaller-than-usual high-platform rapid transit cars which could operate in tight clearances\u2014particularly around the tight loop at Bowdoin.<ref name=\"Cudahy\" />{{rp|32}} Blue Line cars are thus {{convert|48.5|feet}} long, substantially shorter than the {{convert|65|feet|adj=on}} [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]] cars and the {{convert|69.5|feet|adj=on}} [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] cars.<ref name=roster>{{cite web|url=http://www.transithistory.org/roster/ |title=The MBTA Vehicle Inventory Page |publisher=NETransit |date=February 12, 2016 |accessdate=February 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1952 to 1954, a surface-level extension was constructed along the recently-defunct [[Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad]], from Maverick to the current terminus at Wonderland.

However, these transfers require passengers to navigate multiple passages and staircases and increase rush-hour congestion on subway lines in the Downtown subway stations, contributing to delays in subway service. \n\nAs part of a lawsuit settlement relating to air quality mitigation for the [[Big Dig]] highway tunnel project, the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] agreed to build a direct transfer connection between the Blue and Red Lines. The Blue Line would be extended beyond [[Bowdoin (MBTA station)|Bowdoin]] station, continuing {{convert|1500|ft|m}} beneath Cambridge Street to a new underground terminal at [[Charles/MGH (MBTA station)|Charles/MGH]], connecting to the existing elevated Red Line station. In addition to providing a direct transfer between the Red and Blue Lines, this would allow passengers from the North Shore of Boston to reach the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] area without needing to transfer. The MBTA estimated this connection would induce 12,000 new daily boardings at Charles/MGH station, reducing vehicle miles traveled by 5,250 per day.<ref name=\"RedBlueFact\"/> \n\nAfter failing to take any action for over a decade, and under threat of further lawsuits, the state finally agreed to start detailed engineering design for such an extension.

Railcars from what is today the Blue Line could emerge from a ramp portal surfacing between Joy Street and Russell Street, just beyond [[Bowdoin (MBTA station)|Bowdoin]] station. The railcars would run on former streetcar track down Cambridge Street and then most of the distance to the western end of the [[Longfellow Bridge]], connecting to what is now the Red Line just east of its Cambridge Subway portal, near what is now [[Kendall/MIT (MBTA station)|Kendall/MIT]] station. Because the tracks were unpowered, individual cars had to be towed along the street at night. This connection was never used in [[Passenger train|passenger]] service, but was used to transport Blue Line cars to the Eliot Street Yard maintenance shops then located near [[Harvard Square (MBTA station)|Harvard Square]] station.<ref name=\"Cudahy\"/>{{rp|32}} When the Blue Line eventually got its own maintenance shops, the connection was removed and the ramp portal was permanently covered in 1952.<ref name=\"nycsubway\"/><ref name= Cudahy >{{cite book|last=Cudahy|first=Brian J.|title=Change at Park Street Under; the story of Boston's subways|year=1972|publisher=S.

It is part of New England, although portions of it are often grouped with New York and [[New Jersey]] as the [[tri-state area]]. The state is named for the [[Connecticut River]] which approximately bisects the state.

Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River]]s, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which rejected British rule in the [[American Revolution]].\n\nConnecticut is the third smallest state by area,<ref name=\"census table 18\">{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 18, Area Measurements: 2010; and Population and Housing Unit Density: 1990 to 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=41 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> the 29th most populous,<ref>{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 19, Population by Urban and Rural and Type of Urban Area: 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=42 |access-date=May 16, 2014 }}</ref> and the fourth most densely populated<ref name=\"census table 18\" /> of the fifty states.

The state capital and fourth largest city is [[Hartford]], and other major cities and towns (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of [[Montenegro]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.\n[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|upright=1.25|thumb| ]]\n\nThe highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42\u00b03\u2032 N, 73\u00b029\u2032 W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}</ref> At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet (6 m) above sea level.\n\nConnecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history\u2014yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on [[Long Island Sound]], which is an [[estuary]]. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the \"race\" near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when [[tropical cyclones]] pass off the upper East Coast.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.\n\n{{further|List of Connecticut rivers}}\n\nConnecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[Village green|green]], such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in New England), Milford Green (second largest in New England) and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or [[inn]], several [[American colonial architecture|colonial houses]], and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.\n\nThe northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately {{convert|2.5|mile|km}} square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick's]] residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/SouthwickMA_WebDocs/southwick_jog.pdf |title=The Southwick Jog |last=Dodge |first=Edward R. |website=Town of Southwick, Massachusetts |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929023040/http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog |publisher=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024224307/http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |archivedate=October 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], and parts of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]].

Northern Connecticut generally experiences a climate with cold winters with moderate snowfall and hot, humid summers. Far southern and coastal Connecticut has a climate with cool winters with a mix or rain and infrequent snow, and the long hot and humid summers typical of the middle and lower [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].\n\nConnecticut sees a fairly even precipitation pattern with rainfall/snowfall spread throughout the 12 months. Connecticut averages 56% of possible sunshine (higher than the U.S. national average), averaging 2,400 hours of [[sunshine]] annually.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |title=United States Annual Sunshine Map |website=HowStuffWorks |access-date=March 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110429042722/http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |archive-date=April 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nEarly spring (April) can range from slightly cool (40s to low 50s F) to warm (65 to 70 F), while mid and late spring (late April/May) is warm. By late May, the building [[Bermuda High]] creates a southerly flow of warm and humid tropical air, bringing hot weather conditions throughout the state, with average highs in New London of {{convert|81|F|C}} and {{convert|85|F|C}} in Windsor Locks at the peak of summer in late July. On occasion, heat waves with highs from 90 to {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} occur across Connecticut. Although summers are sunny in Connecticut, quick moving summer thunderstorms can bring brief downpours with thunder and lightning. Occasionally these thunderstorms can be severe, and the state usually averages one tornado per year.<ref name=\"tornadoes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|title=Annual average number of tornadoes|publisher=NOAA National Climatic Data Center|format=[[GIF]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030012752/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|archive-date=October 30, 2008|url-status=|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> During hurricane season, the remains of tropical cyclones occasionally affect the region, though a direct hit is rare.\n\nWeather commonly associated with the fall season typically begins in October and lasts to the first days of December. Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s \u00baF for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing.\n\nWinters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from {{convert|38|F|C}} in the coastal lowlands to {{convert|33|F|C}} in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about {{convert|60|in|mm}} in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only {{convert|20-25|in|mm}} along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton). Generally, any locale north or west of [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 84]] receives the most snow, during a storm, and throughout the season. Most of Connecticut has less than 60 days of snow cover. Snow usually falls from late November to late March in the northern part of the state, and from early December to mid-March in the southern and coastal parts of the state.\n\nConnecticut's record high temperature is {{convert|106|F|C}} which occurred in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] on July 15, 1995; the record low is {{convert|-32|F|C}} which occurred in the Northwest Hills [[Falls Village, Connecticut|Falls Village]] on February 16, 1943, and [[Coventry, Connecticut|Coventry]] on January 22, 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/getextreme.php?elem=ALL&state=CT| title = All-Time Climate Extremes for CT|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|Monthly normal high and low temperatures for various Connecticut cities (\u00b0F)\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000; height:17px;\"| City\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jan\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Feb\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Mar\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Apr\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| May\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jun\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jul\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Aug\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Sep\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Oct\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Nov\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Dec\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f8f3ca; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Bridgeport\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0ff; color:#000;\"| 37/23\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0fe; color:#000;\"| 40/25\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffae; color:#000;\"| 47/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff5e; color:#000;\"| 58/41\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f1; color:#000;\"| 68/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 77/60\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#7f0; color:#000;\"| 82/66\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#6eff00; color:#000;\"| 81/65\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#3f0; color:#000;\"| 74/58\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff2f; color:#000;\"| 63/46\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff7b; color:#000;\"| 53/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffd4; color:#000;\"| 42/28\n|-\n! style=\"background:#c5dfe1; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Hartford\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00d9ff; color:#000;\"| 35/16\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00f7ff; color:#000;\"| 39/19\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffc3; color:#000;\"| 47/27\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff62; color:#000;\"| 59/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff08; color:#000;\"| 70/48\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 79/57\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#73ff00; color:#000;\"| 84/63\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#62ff00; color:#000;\"| 82/61\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#1aff00; color:#000;\"| 74/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff48; color:#000;\"| 63/40\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f9; color:#000;\"| 52/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00fff7; color:#000;\"| 40/22\n|-\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Bridgeport, CT |publisher = [[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Hartford, CT |publisher=[[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref>\n|}\n\n===Flora===\n\n{{main|Flora of Connecticut}}\n{{see also|List of Connecticut tree species}}\n\nForests consist of a mix of [[Northeastern coastal forests]] of Oak in southern areas of the state, to the upland [[New England-Acadian forests]] in the northwestern parts of the state.

The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.\n\nThe nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638\u201339. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.\n\nSeparate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.\n\n===Executive===\n\nThe governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2019}}, [[Ned Lamont]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Portal.CT.gov | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref> and [[Susan Bysiewicz]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.<ref name=Pumont/>\n\nThere are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, [[Connecticut Department of Developmental Services|Developmental Services]], Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs.

All executive officers are elected to four-year terms.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Legislative===\n\nThe legislature is the [[Connecticut General Assembly|General Assembly]]. The General Assembly is a [[bicameral]] body consisting of an upper body, the [[Connecticut Senate|State Senate]] (36 senators); and a lower body, the [[Connecticut House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (151 representatives).<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/> Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years. There also must always be between 30 and 50 senators and 125 to 225 representatives. The Lieutenant Governor presides over the Senate, except when absent from the chamber, when the [[Presidents pro tempore of the Connecticut Senate|President pro tempore]] presides.

It is part of New England, although portions of it are often grouped with New York and [[New Jersey]] as the [[tri-state area]]. The state is named for the [[Connecticut River]] which approximately bisects the state. The word \"Connecticut\" is derived from various anglicized spellings of an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] word for \"long tidal river\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Trumbull|first=James Hammond|title=Indian Names of Places, Etc., in and on the Borders of Connecticut: With Interpretations of Some of Them|year=1881 |location=Harford, Connecticut |publisher=Press of the Case, Lockwood & Brainard Company |url={{google books|JS8TAAAAYAAJ|plainurl=yes|page=60}} |page=60}}</ref>\n\nConnecticut's first European settlers were Dutchmen who established a small, short-lived settlement called [[Fort Hoop]] in Hartford at the confluence of the [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park]] and Connecticut Rivers. Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River]]s, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which rejected British rule in the [[American Revolution]].\n\nConnecticut is the third smallest state by area,<ref name=\"census table 18\">{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 18, Area Measurements: 2010; and Population and Housing Unit Density: 1990 to 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=41 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> the 29th most populous,<ref>{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 19, Population by Urban and Rural and Type of Urban Area: 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=42 |access-date=May 16, 2014 }}</ref> and the fourth most densely populated<ref name=\"census table 18\" /> of the fifty states.

The state capital and fourth largest city is [[Hartford]], and other major cities and towns (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of [[Montenegro]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.\n[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|upright=1.25|thumb| ]]\n\nThe highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42\u00b03\u2032 N, 73\u00b029\u2032 W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}</ref> At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet (6 m) above sea level.\n\nConnecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history\u2014yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on [[Long Island Sound]], which is an [[estuary]]. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the \"race\" near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when [[tropical cyclones]] pass off the upper East Coast.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.\n\n{{further|List of Connecticut rivers}}\n\nConnecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[Village green|green]], such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in New England), Milford Green (second largest in New England) and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or [[inn]], several [[American colonial architecture|colonial houses]], and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.\n\nThe northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately {{convert|2.5|mile|km}} square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick's]] residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/SouthwickMA_WebDocs/southwick_jog.pdf |title=The Southwick Jog |last=Dodge |first=Edward R. |website=Town of Southwick, Massachusetts |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929023040/http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog |publisher=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024224307/http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |archivedate=October 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], and parts of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]]. This irregularity in the boundary is the result of [[History of Connecticut#Territorial disputes|territorial disputes]] in the late 17th century, culminating with New York giving up its claim to the area, whose residents considered themselves part of Connecticut, in exchange for an equivalent area extending northwards from [[Ridgefield, Connecticut|Ridgefield]] to the Massachusetts border, as well as undisputed claim to [[Rye (town), New York|Rye, New York]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |title=Connecticut's \"Panhandle\" |website=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314055555/http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |archivedate=March 14, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n{{further|Connecticut panhandle}}\n\nAreas maintained by the [[National Park Service]] include [[Appalachian National Scenic Trail]], [[Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor]], and [[Weir Farm National Historic Site]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Connecticut |website=National Park Service |accessdate=July 15, 2008 |url=http://www.nps.gov/state/ct/index.htm}}</ref>\n\n{{Rivers of Connecticut}}\n{{Mountains of Connecticut}}\n{{Waterbodies of Connecticut}}\n{{Islands and Peninsulas of Connecticut}}\n\n===Climate===\n\n[[File:Connecticut K\u00f6ppen.png|upright=1.35|thumb|left|K\u00f6ppen climate types in Connecticut]]\n[[File:Barndoor Hills original.JPG|thumb|Scenery upon [[Barndoor Hills]] in [[Granby, Connecticut|Granby]] in autumn]]\n[[File:Stamford Harbor Point Marina.jpg|thumb|350x350px|Harbor Point Marina in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] during summer]]\n\nConnecticut lies at the rough transition zone between the southern end of the [[humid continental climate]], and the northern portion of the temperate zone (or [[subtropical]] in some climate classifications). Northern Connecticut generally experiences a climate with cold winters with moderate snowfall and hot, humid summers. Far southern and coastal Connecticut has a climate with cool winters with a mix or rain and infrequent snow, and the long hot and humid summers typical of the middle and lower [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].\n\nConnecticut sees a fairly even precipitation pattern with rainfall/snowfall spread throughout the 12 months. Connecticut averages 56% of possible sunshine (higher than the U.S. national average), averaging 2,400 hours of [[sunshine]] annually.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |title=United States Annual Sunshine Map |website=HowStuffWorks |access-date=March 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110429042722/http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |archive-date=April 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nEarly spring (April) can range from slightly cool (40s to low 50s F) to warm (65 to 70 F), while mid and late spring (late April/May) is warm. By late May, the building [[Bermuda High]] creates a southerly flow of warm and humid tropical air, bringing hot weather conditions throughout the state, with average highs in New London of {{convert|81|F|C}} and {{convert|85|F|C}} in Windsor Locks at the peak of summer in late July. On occasion, heat waves with highs from 90 to {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} occur across Connecticut. Although summers are sunny in Connecticut, quick moving summer thunderstorms can bring brief downpours with thunder and lightning. Occasionally these thunderstorms can be severe, and the state usually averages one tornado per year.<ref name=\"tornadoes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|title=Annual average number of tornadoes|publisher=NOAA National Climatic Data Center|format=[[GIF]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030012752/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|archive-date=October 30, 2008|url-status=|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> During hurricane season, the remains of tropical cyclones occasionally affect the region, though a direct hit is rare.\n\nWeather commonly associated with the fall season typically begins in October and lasts to the first days of December. Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s \u00baF for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing.\n\nWinters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from {{convert|38|F|C}} in the coastal lowlands to {{convert|33|F|C}} in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about {{convert|60|in|mm}} in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only {{convert|20-25|in|mm}} along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton). Generally, any locale north or west of [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 84]] receives the most snow, during a storm, and throughout the season. Most of Connecticut has less than 60 days of snow cover. Snow usually falls from late November to late March in the northern part of the state, and from early December to mid-March in the southern and coastal parts of the state.\n\nConnecticut's record high temperature is {{convert|106|F|C}} which occurred in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] on July 15, 1995; the record low is {{convert|-32|F|C}} which occurred in the Northwest Hills [[Falls Village, Connecticut|Falls Village]] on February 16, 1943, and [[Coventry, Connecticut|Coventry]] on January 22, 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/getextreme.php?elem=ALL&state=CT| title = All-Time Climate Extremes for CT|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|Monthly normal high and low temperatures for various Connecticut cities (\u00b0F)\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000; height:17px;\"| City\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jan\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Feb\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Mar\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Apr\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| May\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jun\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jul\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Aug\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Sep\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Oct\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Nov\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Dec\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f8f3ca; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Bridgeport\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0ff; color:#000;\"| 37/23\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0fe; color:#000;\"| 40/25\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffae; color:#000;\"| 47/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff5e; color:#000;\"| 58/41\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f1; color:#000;\"| 68/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 77/60\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#7f0; color:#000;\"| 82/66\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#6eff00; color:#000;\"| 81/65\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#3f0; color:#000;\"| 74/58\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff2f; color:#000;\"| 63/46\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff7b; color:#000;\"| 53/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffd4; color:#000;\"| 42/28\n|-\n! style=\"background:#c5dfe1; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Hartford\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00d9ff; color:#000;\"| 35/16\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00f7ff; color:#000;\"| 39/19\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffc3; color:#000;\"| 47/27\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff62; color:#000;\"| 59/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff08; color:#000;\"| 70/48\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 79/57\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#73ff00; color:#000;\"| 84/63\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#62ff00; color:#000;\"| 82/61\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#1aff00; color:#000;\"| 74/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff48; color:#000;\"| 63/40\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f9; color:#000;\"| 52/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00fff7; color:#000;\"| 40/22\n|-\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Bridgeport, CT |publisher = [[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Hartford, CT |publisher=[[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref>\n|}\n\n===Flora===\n\n{{main|Flora of Connecticut}}\n{{see also|List of Connecticut tree species}}\n\nForests consist of a mix of [[Northeastern coastal forests]] of Oak in southern areas of the state, to the upland [[New England-Acadian forests]] in the northwestern parts of the state.

The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.\n\nThe nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638\u201339. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.\n\nSeparate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.\n\n===Executive===\n\nThe governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2019}}, [[Ned Lamont]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Portal.CT.gov | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref> and [[Susan Bysiewicz]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.<ref name=Pumont/>\n\nThere are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, [[Connecticut Department of Developmental Services|Developmental Services]], Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs.

All executive officers are elected to four-year terms.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Legislative===\n\nThe legislature is the [[Connecticut General Assembly|General Assembly]]. The General Assembly is a [[bicameral]] body consisting of an upper body, the [[Connecticut Senate|State Senate]] (36 senators); and a lower body, the [[Connecticut House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (151 representatives).<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/> Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years. There also must always be between 30 and 50 senators and 125 to 225 representatives. The Lieutenant Governor presides over the Senate, except when absent from the chamber, when the [[Presidents pro tempore of the Connecticut Senate|President pro tempore]] presides.

Then, for the patient to exhale, the air inside the cylinder is compressed slightly (or allowed to equalize to ambient room pressure), causing the patient's chest and abdomen to partially collapse, forcing air out of the lungs, as the patient exhales the breath through their exposed mouth and nose, outside the cylinder.<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"what_is_the_background_2019_04_11medscape\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" /><ref name=\"how_does_iron_lung_work_2018_08_21_newsweek\" />\n\nExamples of the device include the Drinker respirator, the Emerson respirator, and the Both respirator.

Then, for the patient to exhale, the air inside the cylinder is compressed slightly (or allowed to equalize to ambient room pressure), causing the patient's chest and abdomen to partially collapse, forcing air out of the lungs, as the patient exhales the breath through their exposed mouth and nose, outside the cylinder.<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"what_is_the_background_2019_04_11medscape\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" /><ref name=\"how_does_iron_lung_work_2018_08_21_newsweek\" />\n\nExamples of the device include the Drinker respirator, the Emerson respirator, and the Both respirator.

Emerson won the case, and Drinker's patents were declared invalid.\n\nThe United Kingdom's first iron lung was designed in 1934 by Robert Henderson, an Aberdeen doctor. Henderson had seen a demonstration of the Drinker respirator in the early 1930s, and built a device of his own upon his return to Scotland. Four weeks after its construction, the Henderson respirator was used to save the life of a 10-year-old boy from New Deer, Aberdeenshire, who was suffering from poliomyelitis.

Although the Drinker model was effective and saved lives, its widespread use was hindered by the fact that the machines were very large, heavy (about 750 lbs), bulky, and expensive. In the US, an adult machine cost about $2000 in 1930, and \u00a32000 delivered to Melbourne in 1936. The cost in Europe in the mid-1950s was around \u00a31500.

Two other Atlas machines were built: one for [[BP|British Petroleum]] and the [[University of London]], and one for the [[Atlas Computer Laboratory]] at Chilton near [[Oxford]].\n\nA derivative system was built by Ferranti for [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]. Called the [[Titan (1963 computer)|Titan]], or Atlas 2,<ref>{{cite journal |title=COMPUTERS AND CENTERS, OVERSEAS: 2.

Two further Atlas 2s were delivered: one to the [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] Centre in Cambridge (later called CADCentre, then [[AVEVA]]), and the other to the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment|Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] (AWRE), Aldermaston.\n\nThe University of Manchester's Atlas was decommissioned in 1971.{{sfn|Lavington|1998|p=43|ps=}} The final Atlas, the CADCentre machine, was switched off in late 1976.{{sfn|Lavington|1998|p=44|ps=}} Parts of the Chilton Atlas are preserved by [[National Museums Scotland]] in Edinburgh; the main console itself was rediscovered in July 2014 and is at [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] in Chilton, near [[Oxford]].\n\n==History==\n===Background===\nThrough 1956 there was a growing awareness that the UK was falling behind the US in computer development. In April, B.W. Pollard of Ferranti told a computer conference that \"there is in this country a range of medium-speed computers, and the only two machines which are really fast are the Cambridge EDSAC 2 and the Manchester Mark 2, although both are still very slow compared with the fastest American machines.\"{{sfn|Lavington|1975|pp=30-31}} This was followed by similar concerns expressed in May report to the [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]] Advisory Committee on High Speed Calculating Machines, better known as the Brunt Committee.{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=30}}\n\nThrough this period, [[Tom Kilburn]]'s team at [[Manchester University]] had been experimenting with [[transistor]]-based systems, building two small machines to test various techniques. This was clearly the way forward, and in the fall of 1956, Kilburn began canvassing possible customers on what features they would want in a new transistor-based machine. Most commercial customers pointed out the need to support a wide variety of peripheral devices, while the [[Atomic Energy Authority]] suggested a machine able to perform an instruction every microsecond,{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=31}} or as it would be known today, 1 MFLOP of performance. This later request led to the name of the prospective design, Muse, for MicroSecond Engine.<ref>{{citation |title=The Atlas |url=http://www.computer50.org/kgill/atlas/atlas.html |publisher=University of Manchester |accessdate=21 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728105352/http://www.computer50.org/kgill/atlas/atlas.html |archive-date=28 July 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe need to support many peripherals as well as run fast are naturally at odds. A program that processes data from a [[card reader]], for instance, will spend the vast majority of its time waiting for the reader to send in the next bit of data. To support these devices while still making efficient use of the [[central processing unit]] (CPU), the new system would need to have additional memory to buffer data and have an [[operating system]] that could coordinate the flow of data around the system.{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=32}}\n\n===Muse becomes Atlas===\nWhen the Brunt Committee heard of new and much faster US designs, the [[Univac LARC]] and [[IBM STRETCH]], they were able to gain the attention of the [[National Research Development Corporation]] (NDRC, responsible for moving technologies from war-era research groups into the market. Over the next eighteen months, they held numerous meetings with prospective customers, engineering teams at Ferranti an [[EMI]], and design teams at Manchester and the [[Royal Radar Establishment]].{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=32}}\n\nIn spite of all this effort, by the summer of 1958, there was still no funding available from the NDRC. Kilburn decided to move things along by building a smaller Muse to experiment with various concepts. This was paid for using funding from the Mark 1 Computer Earnings Fund, which collected funds by renting out time on the University's Mark 1. Soon after the project started, in October 1958, Ferranti decided to become involved. In May 1959 they received a grant of \u00a3300,000 from the NDRC to build the system, which would be returned from the proceeds of sales. At some point during this process, the machine was renamed Atlas.{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=32}}\n\nThe detailed design was completed by the end of 1959, and the construction of the [[compiler]]s was proceeding. However, the Supervisor operating system was already well behind.{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=33}} This led to David Howarth, newly hired at Ferranti, expanding the operating system team from two to six programmers. In what is described as a herculean effort, led by the tireless and energetic Howarth,{{efn|Howarth completed his Ph.D. in physics at age 22.}} the team eventually delivered a Supervisor consisting of 35,000 lines of [[assembler language]] which had support for [[multiprogramming]] to solve the problem of peripheral handling.{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=34}}\n\n===Atlas installations===\nThe first Atlas was built up at the university throughout 1962. The schedule was further constrained by the planned shutdown of the [[Ferranti Mercury]] machine at the end of December. Atlas met this goal, and was officially commissioned on 7 December by [[John Cockroft]], director of the AEA.{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=34}} This system had only an early version of Supervisor, and the only compiler was for [[Autocode]].

The AEA machine was later moved to the Atlas Computer Laboratory at Chilton, a few yards outside the boundary fence of Harwell, which placed it on civilian lands and thus much easier to access. This installation grew to be the largest Atlas, containing 48&nbsp;kWords of 48-bit [[core memory]] and 32 tape drives. Time was made available to all UK universities. It was shut down in March 1974.{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=37}}\n\n===Titan and Atlas 2===\n{{main|Titan (1963 computer)}}\n\nIn February 1962, Ferranti gave some parts of an Atlas machine to [[Cambridge University]], and in return, the University would use these to develop a cheaper version of the system. The result was the Titan machine, which became operational in the summer of 1963.

Both ultimately beat Atlas into official use, LARC in 1961, and STRETCH a few months before Atlas. Atlas was much faster than LARC, about four times, and ran slightly slower than STRETCH - Atlas added two [[floating-point]] numbers in about 1.59 microseconds,{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=35}} while STRETCH did the same in 1.38 to 1.5 microseconds. No further sales of LARC were attempted,{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=38}} although it is not clear how many STRETCH machines were ultimately produced.\n\nIt was not until 1964's arrival of the [[CDC 6600]] that the Atlas was significantly bested. CDC later stated that it was a 1959 description of Muse that gave CDC ideas that significantly accelerated the development of the 6600 and allowed it to be delivered earlier than originally estimated.{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=38}} This led to it winning a contract for the [[CSIRO]] in Australia, which had originally been in discussions to buy an Atlas.{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=38}}\n\nFerranti was having serious financial difficulties in the early 1960s, and decided to sell the computer division to [[International Computers and Tabulators]] (ICT) in 1963.

A word could hold one floating-point number, one instruction, two 24-bit addresses or signed integers, or eight 6-bit characters.\n* A fast [[Adder (electronics)|adder]] that used novel circuitry to minimise carry propagation time.\n* 24-bit (2&nbsp;million words, 16 million characters) [[address space]] that embraced supervisor ('sacred') store, V-store, fixed store and the user store\n* 16[[Kibi-|K]] words of [[magnetic core memory|core store]] (equivalent to 96 [[kibibyte|KB]]), featuring interleaving of odd/even addresses\n* 8[[Kibi-|K]] words of read-only memory (referred to as the fixed store). This contained the supervisor and extracode routines.\n* 96K words of [[drum memory|drum store]] (eqv. to 576 KB), split across four drums but integrated with the core store using [[virtual memory]]\n* 128 high-speed [[index register]]s (B-lines) that could be used for address modification in the mostly double-modified instructions. The register address space also included special registers such as the extracode operand address and the exponent of the [[floating-point]] [[accumulator (computing)|accumulator]]. Three of the 128 registers were [[program counter]] registers: 125 was supervisor (interrupt) control, 126 was extracode control, and 127 was user control. Register 0 always held value 0.\n* Capability for the addition of (for the time) sophisticated new [[peripheral]]s such as [[magnetic tape]], including [[Direct memory access|direct memory access (DMA)]] facilities\n* Peripheral control through V-store addresses ([[memory-mapped I/O]]), [[interrupts]] and extracode routines, by reading and writing special wired-in store addresses.\n* An associative memory ([[content-addressable memory]]) to determine whether the desired virtual memory location was in core store\n* [[Instruction pipeline|Instruction pipelining]]\n\nAtlas did not use a synchronous clocking mechanism\u2014it was an [[asynchronous Processor]]\u2014so performance measurements were not easy but as an example:\n* [[Fixed-point arithmetic|Fixed-point]] [[processor register|register]] add&nbsp;\u2013 1.59 [[microsecond]]s\n* [[Floating-point]] add, no modification&nbsp;\u2013 1.61 microseconds\n* Floating-point add, double modify&nbsp;\u2013 2.61 microseconds\n* Floating-point multiply, double modify&nbsp;\u2013 4.97 microseconds\n\n===Extracode===\n\nOne feature of the Atlas was \"Extracode\", a technique that allowed complex instructions to be implemented in software.\n\nThe uppermost ten [[bit]]s of a 48-bit Atlas machine instruction denoted which operation should be performed. If the [[most significant bit]] was set to zero, this was an ordinary machine instruction executed directly by the hardware. If the uppermost bit was set to one, this was an Extracode and was implemented as a special kind of [[subroutine]] jump to a location in the fixed store ([[Read-only memory|ROM]]), its [[memory address|address]] being determined by the other nine bits.  About 250&nbsp;extracodes were implemented, of the 512 possible.\n\nExtracode mode had its own [[program counter|program address counter]], and easy access to the instruction operands.\n\nExtracodes were what would be called [[Interrupt|software interrupt]] or [[trap (computing)|trap]] today. They were used to call mathematical [[Procedure (computer science)|procedures]] which would have been too inefficient to implement in [[computer hardware|hardware]], for example [[sine]], [[logarithm]], and [[square root]]. But about half of the codes were designated as Supervisor functions, which invoked [[operating system]] procedures. Typical examples would be \"Print the specified character on the specified stream\" or \"Read a block of 512 words from logical tape N\". Extracodes were the only means by which a [[computer program|program]] could communicate with the Supervisor. Other UK machines of the era, such as the [[Ferranti Orion]], had similar mechanisms for calling on the services of their operating systems.\n\n===Software===\nAtlas pioneered many software concepts still in common use today, including the [[Atlas Supervisor]], \"considered by many to be the first recognisable modern operating system\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Lavington|1980|pp=50\u201352}}</ref>\n\nOne of the first [[high-level language]]s available on Atlas was named [[Atlas Autocode]], which was contemporary to Algol60 and created specifically to address what Tony Brooker perceived to be some defects in Algol60. The Atlas did however support [[Algol 60]], as well as [[Fortran]] and [[COBOL]], and ABL (Atlas machine code). Being a university computer it was patronised by a large number of the student population, who had access to a protected [[machine code]] development environment.\n<!-- What other [[operating system]]s and [[programming language]]s were available on the Atlas? [[CPL]] was intended to be made available. -->\n\nIt also had a programming language called SPG = System Program Generator. At run time an SPG program could compile more program for itself. It could define and use [[Macro (computer science)|macros]]. Its variables were in <angle brackets> and it had a text parser, giving SPG program text a resemblance to [[Backus\u2013Naur form]].\n\n===Hardware/software integration===\n\nFrom the outset, Atlas was conceived as a supercomputer that would include a comprehensive operating system. The hardware included specific features that facilitated the work of the operating system. For example, the extracode routines and the interrupt routines each had dedicated storage, registers and program counters; a [[context switch]] from user mode to extracode mode or executive mode, or from extracode mode to executive mode, was therefore very fast.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Manchester computers]]\n\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Citation | last = Edwards | first = Dai | title = Designing and Building Atlas | journal = Resurrection: The Bulletin of the Computer Conservation Society | volume = 62 | pages = 9\u201318 | date = Summer 2013  | url = http://www.computerconservationsociety.org/resurrection.htm | issn =0958-7403 }}\n*{{citation |last=Lavington |first=Simon |title=Early British Computers |year=1980 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=0-7190-0803-4}}\n*{{citation |last=Lavington |first=Simon |title=A History of Manchester Computers |year=1975 |publisher=The British Computer Society |location=Swindon |isbn=978-1-902505-01-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/HistoryOfManchesterComputers}}\n*{{citation |last=Lavington |first=Simon |title=A History of Manchester Computers |year=1998 |publisher=The British Computer Society |location=Swindon |edition=2 |isbn=978-1-902505-01-5}}\n\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*''Parallel addition in digital computers: A new fast 'carry' circuit, T.

Two other Atlas machines were built: one for [[BP|British Petroleum]] and the [[University of London]], and one for the [[Atlas Computer Laboratory]] at Chilton near [[Oxford]].\n\nA derivative system was built by Ferranti for [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]. Called the [[Titan (1963 computer)|Titan]], or Atlas 2,<ref>{{cite journal |title=COMPUTERS AND CENTERS, OVERSEAS: 2. Ferranti Ltd., Atlas 2 Computer, London Wl, England |journal=Digital Computer Newsletter |date=1964 |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=13\u201315 |url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/AD0694639 |language=en}}</ref> it had a different memory organisation and ran a [[time-sharing]] operating system developed by Cambridge University Computer Laboratory.  Two further Atlas 2s were delivered: one to the [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] Centre in Cambridge (later called CADCentre, then [[AVEVA]]), and the other to the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment|Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] (AWRE), Aldermaston.\n\nThe University of Manchester's Atlas was decommissioned in 1971.{{sfn|Lavington|1998|p=43|ps=}} The final Atlas, the CADCentre machine, was switched off in late 1976.{{sfn|Lavington|1998|p=44|ps=}} Parts of the Chilton Atlas are preserved by [[National Museums Scotland]] in Edinburgh; the main console itself was rediscovered in July 2014 and is at [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] in Chilton, near [[Oxford]].\n\n==History==\n===Background===\nThrough 1956 there was a growing awareness that the UK was falling behind the US in computer development. In April, B.W. Pollard of Ferranti told a computer conference that \"there is in this country a range of medium-speed computers, and the only two machines which are really fast are the Cambridge EDSAC 2 and the Manchester Mark 2, although both are still very slow compared with the fastest American machines.\"{{sfn|Lavington|1975|pp=30-31}} This was followed by similar concerns expressed in May report to the [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]] Advisory Committee on High Speed Calculating Machines, better known as the Brunt Committee.{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=30}}\n\nThrough this period, [[Tom Kilburn]]'s team at [[Manchester University]] had been experimenting with [[transistor]]-based systems, building two small machines to test various techniques. This was clearly the way forward, and in the fall of 1956, Kilburn began canvassing possible customers on what features they would want in a new transistor-based machine. Most commercial customers pointed out the need to support a wide variety of peripheral devices, while the [[Atomic Energy Authority]] suggested a machine able to perform an instruction every microsecond,{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=31}} or as it would be known today, 1 MFLOP of performance. This later request led to the name of the prospective design, Muse, for MicroSecond Engine.<ref>{{citation |title=The Atlas |url=http://www.computer50.org/kgill/atlas/atlas.html |publisher=University of Manchester |accessdate=21 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728105352/http://www.computer50.org/kgill/atlas/atlas.html |archive-date=28 July 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe need to support many peripherals as well as run fast are naturally at odds. A program that processes data from a [[card reader]], for instance, will spend the vast majority of its time waiting for the reader to send in the next bit of data. To support these devices while still making efficient use of the [[central processing unit]] (CPU), the new system would need to have additional memory to buffer data and have an [[operating system]] that could coordinate the flow of data around the system.{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=32}}\n\n===Muse becomes Atlas===\nWhen the Brunt Committee heard of new and much faster US designs, the [[Univac LARC]] and [[IBM STRETCH]], they were able to gain the attention of the [[National Research Development Corporation]] (NDRC, responsible for moving technologies from war-era research groups into the market. Over the next eighteen months, they held numerous meetings with prospective customers, engineering teams at Ferranti an [[EMI]], and design teams at Manchester and the [[Royal Radar Establishment]].{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=32}}\n\nIn spite of all this effort, by the summer of 1958, there was still no funding available from the NDRC. Kilburn decided to move things along by building a smaller Muse to experiment with various concepts. This was paid for using funding from the Mark 1 Computer Earnings Fund, which collected funds by renting out time on the University's Mark 1. Soon after the project started, in October 1958, Ferranti decided to become involved. In May 1959 they received a grant of \u00a3300,000 from the NDRC to build the system, which would be returned from the proceeds of sales. At some point during this process, the machine was renamed Atlas.{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=32}}\n\nThe detailed design was completed by the end of 1959, and the construction of the [[compiler]]s was proceeding. However, the Supervisor operating system was already well behind.{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=33}} This led to David Howarth, newly hired at Ferranti, expanding the operating system team from two to six programmers. In what is described as a herculean effort, led by the tireless and energetic Howarth,{{efn|Howarth completed his Ph.D. in physics at age 22.}} the team eventually delivered a Supervisor consisting of 35,000 lines of [[assembler language]] which had support for [[multiprogramming]] to solve the problem of peripheral handling.{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=34}}\n\n===Atlas installations===\nThe first Atlas was built up at the university throughout 1962. The schedule was further constrained by the planned shutdown of the [[Ferranti Mercury]] machine at the end of December. Atlas met this goal, and was officially commissioned on 7 December by [[John Cockroft]], director of the AEA.{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=34}} This system had only an early version of Supervisor, and the only compiler was for [[Autocode]].

A portion of this was returned to the University Computer Earnings Fund.{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=35}} In 1969, it was estimated that the computer time received by the University would cost 720,000 if it had been leased on the open market. The machine was shut down on 30 November 1971.{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=36}}\n\nFerranti sold two other Atlas installations, one to a joint consortium of [[London University]] and [[British Petroleum]] in 1963, and another to the [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]] (Harwell) in December 1964.

[[CPL]] was intended to be made available. -->\n\nIt also had a programming language called SPG = System Program Generator. At run time an SPG program could compile more program for itself. It could define and use [[Macro (computer science)|macros]]. Its variables were in <angle brackets> and it had a text parser, giving SPG program text a resemblance to [[Backus\u2013Naur form]].\n\n===Hardware/software integration===\n\nFrom the outset, Atlas was conceived as a supercomputer that would include a comprehensive operating system. The hardware included specific features that facilitated the work of the operating system. For example, the extracode routines and the interrupt routines each had dedicated storage, registers and program counters; a [[context switch]] from user mode to extracode mode or executive mode, or from extracode mode to executive mode, was therefore very fast.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Manchester computers]]\n\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Citation | last = Edwards | first = Dai | title = Designing and Building Atlas | journal = Resurrection: The Bulletin of the Computer Conservation Society | volume = 62 | pages = 9\u201318 | date = Summer 2013  | url = http://www.computerconservationsociety.org/resurrection.htm | issn =0958-7403 }}\n*{{citation |last=Lavington |first=Simon |title=Early British Computers |year=1980 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=0-7190-0803-4}}\n*{{citation |last=Lavington |first=Simon |title=A History of Manchester Computers |year=1975 |publisher=The British Computer Society |location=Swindon |isbn=978-1-902505-01-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/HistoryOfManchesterComputers}}\n*{{citation |last=Lavington |first=Simon |title=A History of Manchester Computers |year=1998 |publisher=The British Computer Society |location=Swindon |edition=2 |isbn=978-1-902505-01-5}}\n\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*''Parallel addition in digital computers: A new fast 'carry' circuit, T.

It was released in [[Arcade game|arcade]]s in August [[1995 in video gaming|1995]], and later for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in [[1996 in video gaming|1996]]. The original arcade version of the game was released in ''[[Tekken 5]]''{{'}}s Arcade History mode for the [[PlayStation 2]], in 2007 for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation Portable]] via the [[PlayStation Network]], and in 2009 for [[Zeebo]].\n\nThere are ten playable characters in the game's arcade version and up to twenty-five fighters, including eight new ones in the console version. The home version also introduced new, now-staple game modes to the series. ''Tekken 2'' was a critical as well as commercial success. It was followed by ''[[Tekken 3]]'' in March 1997.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe [[gameplay]] in ''Tekken 2'' is much like [[Tekken (video game)|its predecessor]] with a few additions. It continues to use [[2D computer graphics|2D]] backgrounds in its stages, an infinite playing field, and a fighting system that utilizes four buttons: left punch, right punch, left kick, and right kick. Distinct additions included attack reversals for some characters, back throws, chain-throws, and a sidestep unique to two characters, [[Kazuya Mishima]] and [[Heihachi Mishima]]. However, [[Yoshimitsu]] has a spinning sidestep move that lowers his health. Tackles were also modified to inflict damage when running from a greater distance. Each time the game is beaten with one of the default available characters in arcade mode, the associated sub-boss character becomes selectable.\n\n''Tekken 2'' also introduced various modes that would become staples to the series. These include [[Survival mode]], Team Battle mode, and Time Attack mode. Survival mode takes the player through an endless number of matches to see how many opponent they can defeat without being defeated themselves. In addition, any health lost during a match will carry over to the next match, but the player would regain a little bit more health. Team Battle mode is a [[Two-player video game|two-player]] mode which up to eight characters can be selected by each player. Like Survival mode, any health lost during a match will carry over to the next match, but the player will regain a small amount. Time Attack mode is similar to Arcade mode, except it is played to see how fast the player can go through it and beat records.\n\n==Characters==\n{{see also|List of Tekken characters}}\n\nThe game features 16 characters from the previous game: [[Anna Williams (Tekken)|Anna Williams]], [[List of Tekken characters#Armor King|Armor King I]], [[Ganryu (Tekken)|Ganryu]], [[Heihachi Mishima]], [[Kazuya Mishima]], [[King (Tekken)|King I]], [[Kuma and Panda|Kuma I]], [[Kunimitsu]], [[Lee Chaolan]], [[Marshall Law (Tekken)|Marshall Law]], [[Michelle Chang (Tekken)|Michelle Chang]], [[Nina Williams]], [[Paul Phoenix (Tekken)|Paul Phoenix]], [[Jack (Tekken)|Prototype Jack]], [[Wang Jinrei]], and [[Yoshimitsu]] while removing Jack. Characters previously appearing as sub-bosses (such as Anna being Nina's sub-boss for example) are made into playable characters and given more distinct move sets, although they still share many moves with the originals. [[Kazuya Mishima|Devil Kazuya]], originally a bonus palette swap of Kazuya reserved for the home console version of the first game, is also made as a full playable character and serves as this game's final boss.\n\n===New characters===\n* [[#Roger/Roger Jr. and Alex|Alex]] {{ref|a|a}} {{ref|b|b}}: A genetically-altered boxing dinosaur.\n* [[List of Tekken characters#Angel|Angel]] {{ref|a|a}} {{ref|b|b}}: a mysterious entity connected to Kazuya.\n* [[List of Tekken characters#Baek Doo San|Baek Doo San]] {{ref|a|a}}: A [[Tae Kwon Do]] practitioner who participates in the tournament to challenge Marshall Law.\n* [[List of Tekken characters#Bruce Irvin|Bruce Irvin]] {{ref|a|a}}: A [[Muay Thai]] kickboxer who suffers from amnesia and is now serving as one of Kazuya's personal bodyguards.\n* [[Jack (Tekken)|Jack-2]]: An updated Jack model who replaces the previous Jack and is sent to battle P.

While his father [[Heihachi Mishima]] was rather ruthless in his endeavors, Kazuya acts completely without a conscience. He hires assassins to eliminate any of his critics and rivals, attempts to extort money from several businesses and organizations, and smuggles endangered species to conduct genetic experiments on them. The reason for his evil deeds is because he has allowed the Devil Gene within him to consume him as a result of his hatred towards Heihachi.\n\nMeanwhile, Kazuya is sentenced to being arrested by animal rights activist and operative [[Jun Kazama]] for his experiments. Heihachi on the other hand, whom Kazuya had defeated and thrown off a cliff two years ago, has climbed back up and is training himself, plotting to overthrow Kazuya. In an attempt to rid himself of Heihachi and his enemies once and for all, Kazuya announces the King of Iron Fist Tournament 2, with a large cash prize of one trillion dollars, knowing that Heihachi will appear.\n\nWhen Jun eventually comes face to face with Kazuya, she tries to arrest him, but instead the both of them can not help being drawn to one another, propelled by a mystic force beyond Jun's control. She later gets pregnant with Kazuya's child, resulting in her leaving everything behind to raise their child. Meanwhile, Heihachi arrives at the tournament, winning against the opposing fighters and eventually reaching Kazuya.\n\nIn the final round, Heihachi confronts Kazuya and they battle once again. The Devil Gene takes over Kazuya's body, resulting in Kazuya becoming a Devil creature. However, despite this, Kazuya is not strong enough to overpower Heihachi because of the internal conflict within him, between his evil side - represented by Devil within him - and his good side - represented by an unknown entity called Angel, which was brought forth after his meeting with Jun. Heihachi takes Kazuya's unconscious body to a volcano, and throws him into it before escaping on a helicopter just as the volcano erupts behind him, having taken his revenge and regained the Mishima Zaibatsu. In the meantime, Jun gives birth to Kazuya's [[Jin Kazama|illegitimate son]].\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/B_FCU_AApNU/\n\n==Development and release==\nEach of the characters in ''Tekken 2'' is composed of roughly 800 polygons and took between three days and a week to model.<ref name=\"Max7\">{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Last Minute Namco News Extra!

It was released in [[Arcade game|arcade]]s in August [[1995 in video gaming|1995]], and later for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in [[1996 in video gaming|1996]]. The original arcade version of the game was released in ''[[Tekken 5]]''{{'}}s Arcade History mode for the [[PlayStation 2]], in 2007 for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation Portable]] via the [[PlayStation Network]], and in 2009 for [[Zeebo]].\n\nThere are ten playable characters in the game's arcade version and up to twenty-five fighters, including eight new ones in the console version. The home version also introduced new, now-staple game modes to the series. ''Tekken 2'' was a critical as well as commercial success. It was followed by ''[[Tekken 3]]'' in March 1997.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe [[gameplay]] in ''Tekken 2'' is much like [[Tekken (video game)|its predecessor]] with a few additions. It continues to use [[2D computer graphics|2D]] backgrounds in its stages, an infinite playing field, and a fighting system that utilizes four buttons: left punch, right punch, left kick, and right kick. Distinct additions included attack reversals for some characters, back throws, chain-throws, and a sidestep unique to two characters, [[Kazuya Mishima]] and [[Heihachi Mishima]]. However, [[Yoshimitsu]] has a spinning sidestep move that lowers his health. Tackles were also modified to inflict damage when running from a greater distance. Each time the game is beaten with one of the default available characters in arcade mode, the associated sub-boss character becomes selectable.\n\n''Tekken 2'' also introduced various modes that would become staples to the series. These include [[Survival mode]], Team Battle mode, and Time Attack mode. Survival mode takes the player through an endless number of matches to see how many opponent they can defeat without being defeated themselves. In addition, any health lost during a match will carry over to the next match, but the player would regain a little bit more health. Team Battle mode is a [[Two-player video game|two-player]] mode which up to eight characters can be selected by each player. Like Survival mode, any health lost during a match will carry over to the next match, but the player will regain a small amount. Time Attack mode is similar to Arcade mode, except it is played to see how fast the player can go through it and beat records.\n\n==Characters==\n{{see also|List of Tekken characters}}\n\nThe game features 16 characters from the previous game: [[Anna Williams (Tekken)|Anna Williams]], [[List of Tekken characters#Armor King|Armor King I]], [[Ganryu (Tekken)|Ganryu]], [[Heihachi Mishima]], [[Kazuya Mishima]], [[King (Tekken)|King I]], [[Kuma and Panda|Kuma I]], [[Kunimitsu]], [[Lee Chaolan]], [[Marshall Law (Tekken)|Marshall Law]], [[Michelle Chang (Tekken)|Michelle Chang]], [[Nina Williams]], [[Paul Phoenix (Tekken)|Paul Phoenix]], [[Jack (Tekken)|Prototype Jack]], [[Wang Jinrei]], and [[Yoshimitsu]] while removing Jack. Characters previously appearing as sub-bosses (such as Anna being Nina's sub-boss for example) are made into playable characters and given more distinct move sets, although they still share many moves with the originals. [[Kazuya Mishima|Devil Kazuya]], originally a bonus palette swap of Kazuya reserved for the home console version of the first game, is also made as a full playable character and serves as this game's final boss.\n\n===New characters===\n* [[#Roger/Roger Jr. and Alex|Alex]] {{ref|a|a}} {{ref|b|b}}: A genetically-altered boxing dinosaur.\n* [[List of Tekken characters#Angel|Angel]] {{ref|a|a}} {{ref|b|b}}: a mysterious entity connected to Kazuya.\n* [[List of Tekken characters#Baek Doo San|Baek Doo San]] {{ref|a|a}}: A [[Tae Kwon Do]] practitioner who participates in the tournament to challenge Marshall Law.\n* [[List of Tekken characters#Bruce Irvin|Bruce Irvin]] {{ref|a|a}}: A [[Muay Thai]] kickboxer who suffers from amnesia and is now serving as one of Kazuya's personal bodyguards.\n* [[Jack (Tekken)|Jack-2]]: An updated Jack model who replaces the previous Jack and is sent to battle P.

While his father [[Heihachi Mishima]] was rather ruthless in his endeavors, Kazuya acts completely without a conscience. He hires assassins to eliminate any of his critics and rivals, attempts to extort money from several businesses and organizations, and smuggles endangered species to conduct genetic experiments on them. The reason for his evil deeds is because he has allowed the Devil Gene within him to consume him as a result of his hatred towards Heihachi.\n\nMeanwhile, Kazuya is sentenced to being arrested by animal rights activist and operative [[Jun Kazama]] for his experiments. Heihachi on the other hand, whom Kazuya had defeated and thrown off a cliff two years ago, has climbed back up and is training himself, plotting to overthrow Kazuya. In an attempt to rid himself of Heihachi and his enemies once and for all, Kazuya announces the King of Iron Fist Tournament 2, with a large cash prize of one trillion dollars, knowing that Heihachi will appear.\n\nWhen Jun eventually comes face to face with Kazuya, she tries to arrest him, but instead the both of them can not help being drawn to one another, propelled by a mystic force beyond Jun's control. She later gets pregnant with Kazuya's child, resulting in her leaving everything behind to raise their child. Meanwhile, Heihachi arrives at the tournament, winning against the opposing fighters and eventually reaching Kazuya.\n\nIn the final round, Heihachi confronts Kazuya and they battle once again. The Devil Gene takes over Kazuya's body, resulting in Kazuya becoming a Devil creature. However, despite this, Kazuya is not strong enough to overpower Heihachi because of the internal conflict within him, between his evil side - represented by Devil within him - and his good side - represented by an unknown entity called Angel, which was brought forth after his meeting with Jun. Heihachi takes Kazuya's unconscious body to a volcano, and throws him into it before escaping on a helicopter just as the volcano erupts behind him, having taken his revenge and regained the Mishima Zaibatsu. In the meantime, Jun gives birth to Kazuya's [[Jin Kazama|illegitimate son]].\n\n==Development and release==\nEach of the characters in ''Tekken 2'' is composed of roughly 800 polygons and took between three days and a week to model.<ref name=\"Max7\">{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Last Minute Namco News Extra!

It also contains arranged music, like the port of the first game. The arrangements were handled by a large team consisting of original composer Yoshie Arakawa, [[Shinji Hosoe]], Ayako Saso, [[Nobuyoshi Sano]], Takayuki Aihara, Hiroto Sasaki, and [[Keiichi Okabe]], while additional music was composed by Akira Nishizaki, Takashi Furukawa, and Hideaki Mitsui.<ref>{{Cite video game|title=Tekken 2|platform=Sony PlayStation|date=1996|developer=Namco|scene=Credits}}</ref>\n\nThe [[PlayStation 2]] version of ''[[Tekken 5]]'' features the arcade version of ''Tekken 2'' (''Ver.
