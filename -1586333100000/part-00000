He meets Hema ([[Samyuktha Varma]]) during a trip arranged when Hema, who works as a drama artist, got held up midway in late night due to the troupe bus breaking down. A friendship grows between them. Later Mukundan shifts his residence to the area where Hema lives due to his roommate's bad behaviour. One day when Mukundan reaches to pick a trip from a lodge he finds his client ([[Biju Menon]]) in a serious condition after a suicide attempt  and Mukundan save his life by the prompt action of calling emergency medical services. There he meets the family of Biju Menon which reflects a wonder in him and  finally goes through a flashback in which Mukudan's ([[Dileep (actor)|Dileep]]) past as a Bank Field Officer in a remote Karnataka village is narrated.\n\nThrough a series of events he meets and falls in love with Radha ([[Kavya Madhavan]]) and plans to get married. But her brother ([[Lal (actor)|Lal]]) without knowing the relationship, plans for marriage of Radha with Biju Menon, who is her Lecturer in  College. Mukundan falls  in a trap conspired by a local goon and money lender, Mukundan's bose (who is on suspension for misappropriation of bank money) and Radha's father gets arrested by the police on charges of cheating the bank. Without knowing the truth and the fact that Mukundan is innocent, Radha is forced to marry Biju Menon. In a fight, it occcured that Mukundan comes back to the village when he gets bail, the local goon, Thimmaiah, (acted by Meghanathan) is killed and Radha's brother goes to jail taking the responsibility. Mukundan loses his job and works as a cab driver for a living. We meet Radha again at hospital as a guilt-stricken wife who cannot transform as a wife in full and true sense as she still longs for Mukundan deeply. Due to this negligent behaviour of Radha, Biju Menon tries to commit suicide and is brought back to life by Mukundan during the start of the movie.\n\nComing to know the miserable condition of Biju Menon, Mukundan decides to fake a marriage with Hema and asks Radha to forget him and start a new life as a responsible wife admitting the change in their lives made by fate. A heartbroken Radha understands the situation and goes into the arms of Biju Menon. After Radha's parting, Mukundan asks Hema to give back the Thali (nuptial pendant), Hema becomes emotional and Mukundan and Hema decide to enter into family life and walk down the temple on a hilltop where the marriage was set as a drama, which turned to a real commitment, hand in hand.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dileep (actor)|Dileep]] as Mukundan\n* [[Kavya Madhavan]] as Radha (voice dubbed by [[Sreeja Ravi|Sreeja]])\n* [[Samyuktha Varma]] as Hema (voice dubbed by [[Bhagyalakshmi]])\n* [[Biju Menon]] as Radha's husband\n* [[Lal (actor)|Lal]] as Parthan (Radha's brother)\n* [[Rani (Tamil actress)]] as Partham's Love interest (Special appearance in the song Maya Devakikku Makan Piranne)\n* [[Jagadish]] as Sashi (Peon of bank)\n* [[Indrans]] as Chandrappan \n* [[Innocent (actor)|Innocent]] as Anthony (Bank Manager, Mukundan's boss)\n* [[Sukumari]] as Mother of Biju Menon\n* [[Meghanathan]] as Thimmaiah (Local goon)\n* [[N.

[[Spencer Walpole|Sir Spencer Walpole]], a historian of contemporary Britain and a senior government official, had not attended any university. He says, \"few medical men, few solicitors, few persons intended for commerce or trade, ever dreamed of passing through a university career.\" He quotes the Oxford University Commissioners in 1852 stating: \"The education imparted at Oxford was not such as to conduce to the advancement in life of many persons, except those intended for the ministry.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Sir Spencer Walpole|title=History of Twenty-Five Years: vol 4: 1870\u20131875|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dmQ4AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA137|year=1903|pages=136\u201337|access-date=3 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304050530/https://books.google.com/books?id=dmQ4AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA137|archive-date=4 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Nevertheless, Walpole argued: \n{{Quote | style=font-size:100%; | Among the many deficiencies attending a university education there was, however, one good thing about it, and that was the education which the undergraduates gave themselves. It was impossible to collect some thousand or twelve hundred of the best young men in England, to give them the opportunity of making acquaintance with one another, and full liberty to live their lives in their own way, without evolving in the best among them, some admirable qualities of loyalty, independence, and self-control. If the average undergraduate carried from University little or no learning, which was of any service to him, he carried from it a knowledge of men and respect for his fellows and himself, a reverence for the past, a code of honour for the present, which could not but be serviceable. He had enjoyed opportunities... of intercourse with men, some of whom were certain to rise to the highest places in the Senate, in the Church, or at the Bar. He might have mixed with them in his sports, in his studies, and perhaps in his debating society; and any associations which he had this formed had been useful to him at the time, and might be a source of satisfaction to him in after life.<ref>Walpole [https://archive.org/details/cu31924088010115/page/n163 ''History of Twenty-Five Years: vol 3: 1870\u20131875'' p.140]</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nOut of the students who matriculated in 1840, 65% were sons of professionals (34% were Anglican ministers).

[[Science]] students found this particularly burdensome and supported a separate science degree with [[Greek language]] study removed from their required courses. This concept of a [[bachelor of science]] had been adopted at other European universities ([[London University]] had implemented it in 1860) but an 1880 proposal at Oxford to replace the classical requirement with a modern language (like German or French) was unsuccessful. After considerable internal wrangling over the structure of the arts curriculum, in 1886 the \"natural science preliminary\" was recognized as a qualifying part of the first year examination.<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3bDAWHbXgi4C&pg=PA355 The history of the University of Oxford: Nineteenth-century Oxford, Volumes 6\u20137]'', page 355.</ref>\n\nAt the start of 1914 the university housed about 3,000 undergraduates and about 100 postgraduate students.

[[Archibald Campbell Tait]], former headmaster of Rugby School, was a key member of the Oxford Commission; he wanted Oxford to follow the German and Scottish model in which the professorship was paramount. The Commission's report envisioned a centralised university run predominantly by professors and faculties, with a much stronger emphasis on research. The professional staff should be strengthened and better paid. For students, restrictions on entry should be dropped, and more opportunity given to poorer families. It called for an enlargement of the curriculum, with honours to be awarded in many new fields. Undergraduate scholarships should be open to all Britons. Graduate fellowships should be opened up to all members of the university. It recommended that fellows be released from an obligation for ordination. Students were to be allowed to save money by boarding in the city, instead of in a college.<ref>{{cite book|author=Sir Spencer Walpole|title=History of Twenty-Five Years: vol 4: 1870\u20131875|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dmQ4AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA151|year=1903|pages=145\u201351|access-date=4 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305090139/https://books.google.com/books?id=dmQ4AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA151|archive-date=5 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 4127167|title = Oxford and the Idea of a University in Nineteenth Century Britain|journal = Oxford Review of Education|volume = 30|issue = 4|pages = 575\u2013592|last1 = Goldman|first1 = Lawrence|year = 2004}}</ref>\n\nThe system of separate [[Honour Moderations|honour schools]] for different subjects began in 1802, with Mathematics and [[Literae Humaniores]].<ref name=\"boase\"/> Schools of \"Natural Sciences\" and \"Law, and Modern History\" were added in 1853.<ref name=\"boase\">{{cite book |pages=208\u2013209 |last=Boase |first=Charles William |authorlink=Charles William Boase |year=1887 |title=Oxford |edition=2nd |url=http://purl.ox.ac.uk/uuid/743404c6bb6c4b16880e9dfce4000622 |accessdate=3 February 2013}}</ref> By 1872, the last of these had split into \"Jurisprudence\" and \"Modern History\".

Privy Council decisions in the 20th century (e.g. the abolition of compulsory daily worship, dissociation of the Regius Professorship of Hebrew from clerical status, diversion of colleges' theological bequests to other purposes) loosened the link with traditional belief and practice. Furthermore, although the university's emphasis had historically been on classical knowledge, its curriculum expanded during the 19th century to include scientific and medical studies. Knowledge of [[Ancient Greek]] was required for admission until 1920, and Latin until 1960.\n\nThe University of Oxford began to award doctorates for research in the first third of the 20th century.

The [[Science Area, Oxford|Science Area]], in which most science departments are located, is the area that bears closest resemblance to a campus. The ten-acre (4-hectare) [[Radcliffe Observatory Quarter]] in the northwest of the city is currently under development. However, the larger colleges' sites are of similar size to these areas.\n\nIconic university buildings include the [[Radcliffe Camera]], the [[Sheldonian Theatre]] used for music concerts, lectures, and university ceremonies, and the [[Examination Schools]], where examinations and some lectures take place. The [[University Church of St Mary the Virgin]] was used for university ceremonies before the construction of the Sheldonian.

It is open to the public during daylight hours. As well as providing gardens and exotic plants, the Parks contains numerous sports fields, used for official and unofficial fixtures, and also contains sites of special interest including the Genetic Garden, an experimental garden to elucidate and investigate evolutionary processes.\n\nThe [[University of Oxford Botanic Garden|Botanic Garden]] on the [[High Street, Oxford|High Street]] is the oldest [[botanical garden|botanic garden]] in the UK. It contains over 8,000 different plant species on {{convert|1.8|ha|acre|frac=2|abbr=on}}.

The {{convert|1000|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Wytham Woods]] are owned by the university and used for research in [[zoology]] and [[climate change]].\n\nThere are also various collegiate-owned open spaces open to the public, including [[Bagley Wood]] and most notably [[Christ Church Meadow, Oxford|Christ Church Meadow]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk/395-732/Biological-Sciences-.html |title=Biological Sciences \u2013 St John's College Oxford |publisher=Sjc.ox.ac.uk |accessdate=16 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018072117/http://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk/395-732/Biological-Sciences-.html |archive-date=18 October 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Organisation== <!-- \"s\" spelling per talk page consensus on 20 April 2009 -->\n{{See also|Category:Departments of the University of Oxford}}\nAs a [[collegiate university]], Oxford's structure can be confusing to those unfamiliar with it. The university is a federation, comprising over forty self-governing [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|colleges]] and [[Permanent Private Hall|halls]], along with a central administration headed by the [[List of Vice-Chancellors of the University of Oxford|Vice-Chancellor]].\n\nAcademic departments are located centrally within the structure of the federation; they are not affiliated with any particular college. Departments provide facilities for teaching and research, determine the syllabi and guidelines for the teaching of students, perform research, and deliver lectures and seminars.\n\nColleges arrange the tutorial teaching for their undergraduates, and the members of an academic department are spread around many colleges. Though certain colleges do have subject alignments (e.g., [[Nuffield College]] as a centre for the social sciences), these are exceptions, and most colleges will have a broad mix of academics and students from a diverse range of subjects. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the central university (the [[Bodleian]]), by the departments (individual departmental libraries, such as the English Faculty Library), and by colleges (each of which maintains a multi-discipline library for the use of its members).\n\n===Central governance===\nThe university's formal head is the [[List of Chancellors of the University of Oxford|Chancellor]]{{anchor|Chancellor of the University of Oxford}}, currently [[Chris Patten|Lord Patten of Barnes]], though as at most British universities, the Chancellor is a titular figure and is not involved with the day-to-day running of the university. The Chancellor is elected by the members of [[Convocation]], a body comprising all graduates of the university, and holds office until death.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B7kUAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA24#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Oxford University Calendar 1817|date=24 June 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Wellington Square Oxford 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wellington Square, Oxford|Wellington Square]], the name of which has become synonymous with the university's central administration]]\nThe [[List of Vice-Chancellors of the University of Oxford|Vice-Chancellor]], currently [[Louise Richardson]],<ref name=\"VCapproval\"/><ref name=\"NewVCLouiseRichardson\"/> is the ''de facto'' head of the university. Five pro-vice-chancellors have specific responsibilities for education; research; planning and resources; development and external affairs; and personnel and equal opportunities. The University Council is the executive policy-forming body, which consists of the vice-chancellor as well as heads of departments and other members elected by [[Congregation (university)|Congregation]], in addition to observers from the [[OUSU|students' union]]. Congregation, the \"parliament of the dons\", comprises over 3,700 members of the university's academic and administrative staff, and has ultimate responsibility for legislative matters: it discusses and pronounces on policies proposed by the University Council.\n\nTwo university [[Proctor of the University of Oxford|proctors]], elected annually on a rotating basis from two of the colleges, are the internal ombudsmen who make sure that the university and its members adhere to its statutes. This role incorporates student welfare and discipline, as well as oversight of the university's proceedings. The university's professors are collectively referred to as the [[List of professorships at the University of Oxford|Statutory Professors of the University of Oxford]]. They are particularly influential in the running of the university's graduate programmes. Examples of statutory professors are the [[Chichele Professorship]]s and the [[Drummond Professor of Political Economy]]. The various academic faculties, departments, and institutes are organised into four [[Divisions of the University of Oxford|divisions]], each with its own head and elected board. They are the Humanities Division; the Social Sciences Division; the Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences Division; and the Medical Sciences Division.\n\nThe University of Oxford is a \"public university\" in the sense that it receives some public money from the government, but it is a \"private university\" in the sense that it is entirely self-governing and, in theory, could choose to become entirely private by rejecting public funds.<ref name=\"OXCHEPS39\">{{cite web | url = http://oxcheps.new.ox.ac.uk/MainSite%20pages/Resources/OxCHEPS_OP39.pdf | title = OFFA and \u00a36000\u20139000 tuition fees | accessdate = 20 March 2011 | last = Dennis | first = Farrington | first2 = David | last2 = Palfreyman | date = 21 February 2011 | work = OxCHEPS Occasional Paper No. 39 | publisher = Oxford Centre for Higher Education Policy Studies | quote = Note, however, that any university which does not want funding from HEFCE can, as a private corporation, charge whatever tuition fees it likes (exactly as does, say, the University of Buckingham or BPP University College).

For example, some colleges have [[formal hall]] six times a week, but in others this only happens occasionally. At most colleges these formal meals require gowns to be worn, and a Latin grace is said.\n\n''Balls'' are major events held by colleges; the largest, held triennially in 9th week of Trinity Term, are called [[commemoration ball]]s; the dress code is usually [[white tie]]. Many other colleges hold smaller events during the year that they call summer balls or parties. These are usually held on an annual or irregular basis, and are usually [[black tie]].\n\n[[Punt (boat)|Punting]] is a common summer leisure activity.\n\nThere are several more or less quirky traditions peculiar to individual colleges, for example the [[All Souls College, Oxford#Customs|All Souls mallard song]].\n<!-- Ought here to explain Matriculation, make reference to [[May Morning]], and briefly mention Merton's time ceremony, Corpus' tortoise race, etc -->\n\n===Clubs and societies===\n{{See also|Category:Clubs and societies of the University of Oxford}}\n[[File:Eights 2005.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Rowing at Summer Eights, an annual intercollegiate [[bumps race]]]]\nSport is played between college teams, in tournaments known as [[cuppers]] (the term is also used for some non-sporting competitions). In addition to these there are higher standard [[:Category:Oxford student sports clubs|university wide groups]]. Significant focus is given to annual [[Varsity match|varsity]] matches played against Cambridge, the most famous of which is [[The Boat Race]], watched by a TV audience of between five and ten million viewers. This outside interest reflects the importance of rowing to many of those within the university. Much attention is given to the termly intercollegiate rowing regattas: Christ Church Regatta, [[Torpids]] and [[Summer Eights]]. A [[Blue (university sport)|blue]] is an award given to those who compete at the university team level in certain sports. As well as traditional sports, there are teams for activities such as [[Octopush]] and [[Quidditch (sport)|quidditch]].\n\nThere are two weekly student newspapers: the independent ''[[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]]'' and OUSU's ''[[The Oxford Student]]''. Other publications include the [[Isis magazine|''Isis'' magazine]], the satirical ''[[The Oxymoron|Oxymoron]]'', and the graduate ''[[The Oxonian Review of Books|Oxonian Review]]''. The [[Campus radio|student radio]] station is [[Oxide Radio]]. Most colleges have chapel choirs. Music, drama, and other arts societies exist both at collegiate level and as university-wide groups, such as [[Oxford University Dramatic Society]] and the [[Oxford Revue]]. Unlike most other collegiate societies, musical ensembles actively encourage players from other colleges.\n\n[[File:UnionBuildingsDebateChamber.jpg|thumb|The [[Oxford Union]]'s debating chamber]]\nMost academic areas have student societies of some form which are open to students studying all courses, for example the [[Oxford University Scientific Society|Scientific Society]]. There are groups for almost all faiths, political parties, countries and cultures.\n\nThe [[Oxford Union]] (not to be confused with the [[Oxford University Student Union]]) hosts weekly debates and high-profile speakers. There have historically been elite invite-only societies such as the [[Bullingdon Club]].\n\n===Student union and common rooms===\n\nThe [[Oxford University Student Union]], formerly better known by its acronym OUSU and now rebranded as Oxford SU,<ref name=\"OxfordSU\">{{cite news |url=http://cherwell.org/2017/08/17/dnp-ousu-is-dead-long-live-the-oxford-su/ |title=\"Oxford SU\" to replace OUSU brand |work=[[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]] |date=2017-08-17 |accessdate=2018-10-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181026222839/http://cherwell.org/2017/08/17/dnp-ousu-is-dead-long-live-the-oxford-su/ |archive-date=26 October 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> exists to represent students in the university's decision-making, to act as the voice for students in the national higher education policy debate, and to provide direct services to the student body. Reflecting the collegiate nature of the University of Oxford itself, OUSU is both an association of Oxford's more than 21,000 individual students and a federation of the affiliated college common rooms, and other affiliated organisations that represent subsets of the undergraduate and graduate students. The OUSU Executive Committee includes six full-time salaried sabbatical officers, who generally serve in the year following completion of their Final Examinations.\n\nThe importance of collegiate life is such that for many students their college JCR (Junior Common Room, for undergraduates) or MCR (Middle Common Room, for graduates) is seen as more important than OUSU. JCRs and MCRs each have a committee, with a president and other elected students representing their peers to college authorities. Additionally, they organise events and often have significant budgets to spend as they wish (money coming from their colleges and sometimes other sources such as student-run bars). (It is worth noting that JCR and MCR are terms that are used to refer to rooms for use by members, as well as the student bodies.) Not all colleges use this JCR/MCR structure, for example [[Wadham College]]'s entire student population is represented by a combined Students' Union and purely graduate colleges have different arrangements.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{Main|List of University of Oxford people}}\nThroughout its history, a sizeable number of Oxford alumni, known as Oxonians, have become notable in many varied fields, both academic and otherwise. A total of [[List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation|69 Nobel prize-winners]] have studied or taught at Oxford, with prizes won in all six categories.<ref name=\"Famous\"/>\nMore information on notable members of the university can be found in the [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|individual college]] articles.

He says, \"few medical men, few solicitors, few persons intended for commerce or trade, ever dreamed of passing through a university career.\" He quotes the Oxford University Commissioners in 1852 stating: \"The education imparted at Oxford was not such as to conduce to the advancement in life of many persons, except those intended for the ministry.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Sir Spencer Walpole|title=History of Twenty-Five Years: vol 4: 1870\u20131875|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dmQ4AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA137|year=1903|pages=136\u201337|access-date=3 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304050530/https://books.google.com/books?id=dmQ4AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA137|archive-date=4 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Nevertheless, Walpole argued: \n{{Quote | style=font-size:100%; | Among the many deficiencies attending a university education there was, however, one good thing about it, and that was the education which the undergraduates gave themselves. It was impossible to collect some thousand or twelve hundred of the best young men in England, to give them the opportunity of making acquaintance with one another, and full liberty to live their lives in their own way, without evolving in the best among them, some admirable qualities of loyalty, independence, and self-control. If the average undergraduate carried from University little or no learning, which was of any service to him, he carried from it a knowledge of men and respect for his fellows and himself, a reverence for the past, a code of honour for the present, which could not but be serviceable. He had enjoyed opportunities... of intercourse with men, some of whom were certain to rise to the highest places in the Senate, in the Church, or at the Bar. He might have mixed with them in his sports, in his studies, and perhaps in his debating society; and any associations which he had this formed had been useful to him at the time, and might be a source of satisfaction to him in after life.<ref>Walpole [https://archive.org/details/cu31924088010115/page/n163 ''History of Twenty-Five Years: vol 3: 1870\u20131875'' p.140]</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nOut of the students who matriculated in 1840, 65% were sons of professionals (34% were Anglican ministers).

[[Science]] students found this particularly burdensome and supported a separate science degree with [[Greek language]] study removed from their required courses. This concept of a [[bachelor of science]] had been adopted at other European universities ([[London University]] had implemented it in 1860) but an 1880 proposal at Oxford to replace the classical requirement with a modern language (like German or French) was unsuccessful. After considerable internal wrangling over the structure of the arts curriculum, in 1886 the \"natural science preliminary\" was recognized as a qualifying part of the first year examination.<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3bDAWHbXgi4C&pg=PA355 The history of the University of Oxford: Nineteenth-century Oxford, Volumes 6\u20137]'', page 355.</ref>\n\nAt the start of 1914 the university housed about 3,000 undergraduates and about 100 postgraduate students.

[[Archibald Campbell Tait]], former headmaster of Rugby School, was a key member of the Oxford Commission; he wanted Oxford to follow the German and Scottish model in which the professorship was paramount. The Commission's report envisioned a centralised university run predominantly by professors and faculties, with a much stronger emphasis on research. The professional staff should be strengthened and better paid. For students, restrictions on entry should be dropped, and more opportunity given to poorer families. It called for an enlargement of the curriculum, with honours to be awarded in many new fields. Undergraduate scholarships should be open to all Britons. Graduate fellowships should be opened up to all members of the university. It recommended that fellows be released from an obligation for ordination. Students were to be allowed to save money by boarding in the city, instead of in a college.<ref>{{cite book|author=Sir Spencer Walpole|title=History of Twenty-Five Years: vol 4: 1870\u20131875|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dmQ4AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA151|year=1903|pages=145\u201351|access-date=4 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305090139/https://books.google.com/books?id=dmQ4AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA151|archive-date=5 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 4127167|title = Oxford and the Idea of a University in Nineteenth Century Britain|journal = Oxford Review of Education|volume = 30|issue = 4|pages = 575\u2013592|last1 = Goldman|first1 = Lawrence|year = 2004}}</ref>\n\nThe system of separate [[Honour Moderations|honour schools]] for different subjects began in 1802, with Mathematics and [[Literae Humaniores]].<ref name=\"boase\"/> Schools of \"Natural Sciences\" and \"Law, and Modern History\" were added in 1853.<ref name=\"boase\">{{cite book |pages=208\u2013209 |last=Boase |first=Charles William |authorlink=Charles William Boase |year=1887 |title=Oxford |edition=2nd |url=http://purl.ox.ac.uk/uuid/743404c6bb6c4b16880e9dfce4000622 |accessdate=3 February 2013}}</ref> By 1872, the last of these had split into \"Jurisprudence\" and \"Modern History\".

Privy Council decisions in the 20th century (e.g. the abolition of compulsory daily worship, dissociation of the Regius Professorship of Hebrew from clerical status, diversion of colleges' theological bequests to other purposes) loosened the link with traditional belief and practice. Furthermore, although the university's emphasis had historically been on classical knowledge, its curriculum expanded during the 19th century to include scientific and medical studies.

The [[Science Area, Oxford|Science Area]], in which most science departments are located, is the area that bears closest resemblance to a campus. The ten-acre (4-hectare) [[Radcliffe Observatory Quarter]] in the northwest of the city is currently under development. However, the larger colleges' sites are of similar size to these areas.\n\nIconic university buildings include the [[Radcliffe Camera]], the [[Sheldonian Theatre]] used for music concerts, lectures, and university ceremonies, and the [[Examination Schools]], where examinations and some lectures take place.

It is open to the public during daylight hours. As well as providing gardens and exotic plants, the Parks contains numerous sports fields, used for official and unofficial fixtures, and also contains sites of special interest including the Genetic Garden, an experimental garden to elucidate and investigate evolutionary processes.\n\nThe [[University of Oxford Botanic Garden|Botanic Garden]] on the [[High Street, Oxford|High Street]] is the oldest [[botanical garden|botanic garden]] in the UK. It contains over 8,000 different plant species on {{convert|1.8|ha|acre|frac=2|abbr=on}}.

The {{convert|1000|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Wytham Woods]] are owned by the university and used for research in [[zoology]] and [[climate change]].\n\nThere are also various collegiate-owned open spaces open to the public, including [[Bagley Wood]] and most notably [[Christ Church Meadow, Oxford|Christ Church Meadow]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk/395-732/Biological-Sciences-.html |title=Biological Sciences \u2013 St John's College Oxford |publisher=Sjc.ox.ac.uk |accessdate=16 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018072117/http://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk/395-732/Biological-Sciences-.html |archive-date=18 October 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Organisation== <!-- \"s\" spelling per talk page consensus on 20 April 2009 -->\n{{See also|Category:Departments of the University of Oxford}}\nAs a [[collegiate university]], Oxford's structure can be confusing to those unfamiliar with it. The university is a federation, comprising over forty self-governing [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|colleges]] and [[Permanent Private Hall|halls]], along with a central administration headed by the [[List of Vice-Chancellors of the University of Oxford|Vice-Chancellor]].\n\nAcademic departments are located centrally within the structure of the federation; they are not affiliated with any particular college. Departments provide facilities for teaching and research, determine the syllabi and guidelines for the teaching of students, perform research, and deliver lectures and seminars.\n\nColleges arrange the tutorial teaching for their undergraduates, and the members of an academic department are spread around many colleges. Though certain colleges do have subject alignments (e.g., [[Nuffield College]] as a centre for the social sciences), these are exceptions, and most colleges will have a broad mix of academics and students from a diverse range of subjects. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the central university (the [[Bodleian]]), by the departments (individual departmental libraries, such as the English Faculty Library), and by colleges (each of which maintains a multi-discipline library for the use of its members).\n\n===Central governance===\nThe university's formal head is the [[List of Chancellors of the University of Oxford|Chancellor]]{{anchor|Chancellor of the University of Oxford}}, currently [[Chris Patten|Lord Patten of Barnes]], though as at most British universities, the Chancellor is a titular figure and is not involved with the day-to-day running of the university. The Chancellor is elected by the members of [[Convocation]], a body comprising all graduates of the university, and holds office until death.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B7kUAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA24#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Oxford University Calendar 1817|date=24 June 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Wellington Square Oxford 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wellington Square, Oxford|Wellington Square]], the name of which has become synonymous with the university's central administration]]\nThe [[List of Vice-Chancellors of the University of Oxford|Vice-Chancellor]], currently [[Louise Richardson]],<ref name=\"VCapproval\"/><ref name=\"NewVCLouiseRichardson\"/> is the ''de facto'' head of the university. Five pro-vice-chancellors have specific responsibilities for education; research; planning and resources; development and external affairs; and personnel and equal opportunities. The University Council is the executive policy-forming body, which consists of the vice-chancellor as well as heads of departments and other members elected by [[Congregation (university)|Congregation]], in addition to observers from the [[OUSU|students' union]]. Congregation, the \"parliament of the dons\", comprises over 3,700 members of the university's academic and administrative staff, and has ultimate responsibility for legislative matters: it discusses and pronounces on policies proposed by the University Council.\n\nTwo university [[Proctor of the University of Oxford|proctors]], elected annually on a rotating basis from two of the colleges, are the internal ombudsmen who make sure that the university and its members adhere to its statutes. This role incorporates student welfare and discipline, as well as oversight of the university's proceedings. The university's professors are collectively referred to as the [[List of professorships at the University of Oxford|Statutory Professors of the University of Oxford]]. They are particularly influential in the running of the university's graduate programmes. Examples of statutory professors are the [[Chichele Professorship]]s and the [[Drummond Professor of Political Economy]]. The various academic faculties, departments, and institutes are organised into four [[Divisions of the University of Oxford|divisions]], each with its own head and elected board. They are the Humanities Division; the Social Sciences Division; the Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences Division; and the Medical Sciences Division.\n\nThe University of Oxford is a \"public university\" in the sense that it receives some public money from the government, but it is a \"private university\" in the sense that it is entirely self-governing and, in theory, could choose to become entirely private by rejecting public funds.<ref name=\"OXCHEPS39\">{{cite web | url = http://oxcheps.new.ox.ac.uk/MainSite%20pages/Resources/OxCHEPS_OP39.pdf | title = OFFA and \u00a36000\u20139000 tuition fees | accessdate = 20 March 2011 | last = Dennis | first = Farrington | first2 = David | last2 = Palfreyman | date = 21 February 2011 | work = OxCHEPS Occasional Paper No. 39 | publisher = Oxford Centre for Higher Education Policy Studies | quote = Note, however, that any university which does not want funding from HEFCE can, as a private corporation, charge whatever tuition fees it likes (exactly as does, say, the University of Buckingham or BPP University College).

Scholars, and exhibitioners in some colleges, are entitled to wear a more voluminous undergraduate gown; \"commoners\" (originally those who had to pay for their \"commons\", or food and lodging) are restricted to a short, sleeveless garment.

For example, some colleges have [[formal hall]] six times a week, but in others this only happens occasionally. At most colleges these formal meals require gowns to be worn, and a Latin grace is said.\n\n''Balls'' are major events held by colleges; the largest, held triennially in 9th week of Trinity Term, are called [[commemoration ball]]s; the dress code is usually [[white tie]]. Many other colleges hold smaller events during the year that they call summer balls or parties. These are usually held on an annual or irregular basis, and are usually [[black tie]].\n\n[[Punt (boat)|Punting]] is a common summer leisure activity.\n\nThere are several more or less quirky traditions peculiar to individual colleges, for example the [[All Souls College, Oxford#Customs|All Souls mallard song]].\n<!-- Ought here to explain Matriculation, make reference to [[May Morning]], and briefly mention Merton's time ceremony, Corpus' tortoise race, etc -->\n\n===Clubs and societies===\n{{See also|Category:Clubs and societies of the University of Oxford}}\n[[File:Eights 2005.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Rowing at Summer Eights, an annual intercollegiate [[bumps race]]]]\nSport is played between college teams, in tournaments known as [[cuppers]] (the term is also used for some non-sporting competitions). In addition to these there are higher standard [[:Category:Oxford student sports clubs|university wide groups]]. Significant focus is given to annual [[Varsity match|varsity]] matches played against Cambridge, the most famous of which is [[The Boat Race]], watched by a TV audience of between five and ten million viewers. This outside interest reflects the importance of rowing to many of those within the university. Much attention is given to the termly intercollegiate rowing regattas: Christ Church Regatta, [[Torpids]] and [[Summer Eights]]. A [[Blue (university sport)|blue]] is an award given to those who compete at the university team level in certain sports. As well as traditional sports, there are teams for activities such as [[Octopush]] and [[Quidditch (sport)|quidditch]].\n\nThere are two weekly student newspapers: the independent ''[[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]]'' and OUSU's ''[[The Oxford Student]]''. Other publications include the [[Isis magazine|''Isis'' magazine]], the satirical ''[[The Oxymoron|Oxymoron]]'', and the graduate ''[[The Oxonian Review of Books|Oxonian Review]]''. The [[Campus radio|student radio]] station is [[Oxide Radio]]. Most colleges have chapel choirs. Music, drama, and other arts societies exist both at collegiate level and as university-wide groups, such as [[Oxford University Dramatic Society]] and the [[Oxford Revue]]. Unlike most other collegiate societies, musical ensembles actively encourage players from other colleges.\n\n[[File:UnionBuildingsDebateChamber.jpg|thumb|The [[Oxford Union]]'s debating chamber]]\nMost academic areas have student societies of some form which are open to students studying all courses, for example the [[Oxford University Scientific Society|Scientific Society]]. There are groups for almost all faiths, political parties, countries and cultures.\n\nThe [[Oxford Union]] (not to be confused with the [[Oxford University Student Union]]) hosts weekly debates and high-profile speakers. There have historically been elite invite-only societies such as the [[Bullingdon Club]].\n\n===Student union and common rooms===\n\nThe [[Oxford University Student Union]], formerly better known by its acronym OUSU and now rebranded as Oxford SU,<ref name=\"OxfordSU\">{{cite news |url=http://cherwell.org/2017/08/17/dnp-ousu-is-dead-long-live-the-oxford-su/ |title=\"Oxford SU\" to replace OUSU brand |work=[[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]] |date=2017-08-17 |accessdate=2018-10-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181026222839/http://cherwell.org/2017/08/17/dnp-ousu-is-dead-long-live-the-oxford-su/ |archive-date=26 October 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> exists to represent students in the university's decision-making, to act as the voice for students in the national higher education policy debate, and to provide direct services to the student body. Reflecting the collegiate nature of the University of Oxford itself, OUSU is both an association of Oxford's more than 21,000 individual students and a federation of the affiliated college common rooms, and other affiliated organisations that represent subsets of the undergraduate and graduate students. The OUSU Executive Committee includes six full-time salaried sabbatical officers, who generally serve in the year following completion of their Final Examinations.\n\nThe importance of collegiate life is such that for many students their college JCR (Junior Common Room, for undergraduates) or MCR (Middle Common Room, for graduates) is seen as more important than OUSU. JCRs and MCRs each have a committee, with a president and other elected students representing their peers to college authorities. Additionally, they organise events and often have significant budgets to spend as they wish (money coming from their colleges and sometimes other sources such as student-run bars). (It is worth noting that JCR and MCR are terms that are used to refer to rooms for use by members, as well as the student bodies.) Not all colleges use this JCR/MCR structure, for example [[Wadham College]]'s entire student population is represented by a combined Students' Union and purely graduate colleges have different arrangements.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{Main|List of University of Oxford people}}\nThroughout its history, a sizeable number of Oxford alumni, known as Oxonians, have become notable in many varied fields, both academic and otherwise. A total of [[List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation|69 Nobel prize-winners]] have studied or taught at Oxford, with prizes won in all six categories.<ref name=\"Famous\"/>\nMore information on notable members of the university can be found in the [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|individual college]] articles.

There was a core of NCSY from two early founded regions Midwest Region (founded 1951) and Southern Region (founded in 1952 by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Rosenberg and Mr. Abe Rabhan of B'nai B'rith Jacob synagogue in Savannah, Georgia).\nIn 1954, Harold and Enid Boxer donated the money to create a national organization from the already-existing Southern and Midwest Regions.<ref name=\"cbaj-albany.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cbaj-albany.org/ncsy/members.htm |title=About us |publisher=Cbaj-albany.org |accessdate=2012-07-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219111538/http://www.cbaj-albany.org/ncsy/members.htm |archivedate=2012-02-19 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1959, NCSY hired Rabbi [[Pinchas Stolper]] as the first National Director.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dEgcAAAAMAAJ |title=Saul Bernstein, '&#39;The Renaissance of the Torah Jew'&#39; (KTAV Publishing, 1985), pp. 274, 339 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s there was an emphasis on NCSY Publications with many volumes written by Pinchas Stolper and then later the Aryeh Kaplan Series.

It was originally known as \"NCSY Goes to Yeshiva,\" and later changed its name to \"Camp NCSY Sports\".<ref name=\"cbaj-albany.org\"/>\n\nIn 1970, the Israel Summer Institute for Jewish teens was founded. Rabbi Stolper assisted NCSY in expanding internationally into Canada, Israel, Australia, Chile, and Ukraine.\n\nBy 2015, NCSY Summer Programs included The Anne Samson Jerusalem (TJJ), NCSY Kollel, NCSY Michlelet, NCSY GIVE (Girls Israel Volunteer Experience), NCSY JOLT (Jewish Overseas Leadership Training), NCSY BILT (Boys Israel Leadership Training), and other summer programs. There were 1097 participants in NCSY Summer in 2015.\n\nThe organization has produced many Jewish children's entertainers who have remained in outreach work, including [[Uncle Moishy and the Mitzvah Men]] and Zale Newman.\n\nAccording to the Orthodox sociologist Chaim Waxman, there has been an increase in [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] influence on NCSY.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/cjc/cjc-waxman-f05.htm |title=Winners and Losers in Denominational Memberships in the United States - Chaim I.

They are [[New England]], Upper New York, [[New York (state)|New York]]-[[Long Island]], [[New Jersey]], Atlantic Seaboard, Central East, Southern, South [[Florida]], Greater Midwest, Southwest, [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], Northwest, and [[Canada]]. Additionally, NCSY runs programming branches in [[Israel]] and now [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]]. Each Region is divided into chapters. A chapter is typically a city, or a group of surrounding towns. In heavily populated Jewish areas like [[New Jersey]], counties may have several chapters.\n\nMany chapters in NCSY appoint or elect a group of NCSYers to serve on a chapter board, who work with the advisors or city directors to assist with programming or outreach. Many regions do the same thing, and have a regional board, who do similar things for the region. The International Board consists of representatives from many different regions.\n\nNCSY's programming is divided into two age groups, \"junior\" and \"senior\"; these generally encompass 5th\u20138th grades and 9th\u201312th grades, respectively. Some programs span both age groups, but most programming is unique for each.\n\n==Programming==\nNCSY's original model was to create the regional [[Shabbaton]], a weekend-long social and educational [[Shabbat]] experience based on learning sessions, following in the model of Abraham Stern of Torah Leadership Seminar.\n\nCurrently, while on [[Shabbaton]]s kids are treated to skits, learning sessions and ebbing, where participants sit in a circle around the \"circle guy\" where they sing songs and do \"funny\" routines.  They are housed either in hotels, camps, or grouped with sponsor families who take them in for the weekend.\n\n<br />\n\n== NCSY Summer ==\nNCSY Summer runs 18 different trips to Israel, Europe, and North America. The trips have fluctuated every year, with new programs released and other programs cut.\n\nBoys Trips:\n\n* Camp Sports - \"Camp Sports enables participants to hone their athletic skills while learning Torah with their friends and advisors in a fun and relaxed atmosphere.

There was a core of NCSY from two early founded regions Midwest Region (founded 1951) and Southern Region (founded in 1952 by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Rosenberg and Mr. Abe Rabhan of B'nai B'rith Jacob synagogue in Savannah, Georgia).\nIn 1954, Harold and Enid Boxer donated the money to create a national organization from the already-existing Southern and Midwest Regions.<ref name=\"cbaj-albany.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cbaj-albany.org/ncsy/members.htm |title=About us |publisher=Cbaj-albany.org |accessdate=2012-07-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219111538/http://www.cbaj-albany.org/ncsy/members.htm |archivedate=2012-02-19 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1959, NCSY hired Rabbi [[Pinchas Stolper]] as the first National Director.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dEgcAAAAMAAJ |title=Saul Bernstein, '&#39;The Renaissance of the Torah Jew'&#39; (KTAV Publishing, 1985), pp. 274, 339 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s there was an emphasis on NCSY Publications with many volumes written by Pinchas Stolper and then later the Aryeh Kaplan Series.

It was originally known as \"NCSY Goes to Yeshiva,\" and later changed its name to \"Camp NCSY Sports\".<ref name=\"cbaj-albany.org\"/>\n\nIn 1970, the Israel Summer Institute for Jewish teens was founded. Rabbi Stolper assisted NCSY in expanding internationally into Canada, Israel, Australia, Chile, and Ukraine.\n\nBy 2015, NCSY Summer Programs included The Anne Samson Jerusalem (TJJ), NCSY Kollel, NCSY Michlelet, NCSY GIVE (Girls Israel Volunteer Experience), NCSY JOLT (Jewish Overseas Leadership Training), NCSY BILT (Boys Israel Leadership Training), and other summer programs. There were 1097 participants in NCSY Summer in 2015.\n\nThe organization has produced many Jewish children's entertainers who have remained in outreach work, including [[Uncle Moishy and the Mitzvah Men]] and Zale Newman.\n\nAccording to the Orthodox sociologist Chaim Waxman, there has been an increase in [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] influence on NCSY.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/cjc/cjc-waxman-f05.htm |title=Winners and Losers in Denominational Memberships in the United States - Chaim I.

They are [[New England]], Upper New York, [[New York (state)|New York]]-[[Long Island]], [[New Jersey]], Atlantic Seaboard, Central East, Southern, South [[Florida]], Greater Midwest, Southwest, [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], Northwest, and [[Canada]]. Additionally, NCSY runs programming branches in [[Israel]] and now [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]]. Each Region is divided into chapters. A chapter is typically a city, or a group of surrounding towns. In heavily populated Jewish areas like [[New Jersey]], counties may have several chapters.\n\nMany chapters in NCSY appoint or elect a group of NCSYers to serve on a chapter board, who work with the advisors or city directors to assist with programming or outreach. Many regions do the same thing, and have a regional board, who do similar things for the region. The International Board consists of representatives from many different regions.\n\nNCSY's programming is divided into two age groups, \"junior\" and \"senior\"; these generally encompass 5th\u20138th grades and 9th\u201312th grades, respectively. Some programs span both age groups, but most programming is unique for each.\n\n==Programming==\nNCSY's original model was to create the regional [[Shabbaton]], a weekend-long social and educational [[Shabbat]] experience based on learning sessions, following in the model of Abraham Stern of Torah Leadership Seminar.\n\nCurrently, while on [[Shabbaton]]s kids are treated to skits, learning sessions and ebbing, where participants sit in a circle around the \"circle guy\" where they sing songs and do \"funny\" routines.  They are housed either in hotels, camps, or grouped with sponsor families who take them in for the weekend.\n\n<br />\n\n== NCSY Summer ==\nNCSY Summer runs 18 different trips to Israel, Europe, and North America. The trips have fluctuated every year, with new programs released and other programs cut.\n\nBoys Trips:\n\n* Camp Sports- \"Camp Sports enables participants to hone their athletic skills while learning Torah with their friends and advisors in a fun and relaxed atmosphere.

The investigation began on July 12, 2000, he was indicted in March of that same year and surrendered to authorities and entered a plea of \"not-guilty\" on April 20, 2000. Lanner was convicted on one account of fondling a student on June 27 of 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theawarenesscenter.org/lanner_baruch.html|title=Case of Rabbi Baruch Lanner (AKA: Bernard S.

It also sometimes tends to a charismatic quality.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb5092/is_200008/ai_n18524887 The Dark Side of Outreach: Does NCSY value religious observance over family harmony?

A 54-page public report summarizing a much longer document of investigation, found the following.\n\n<blockquote>The report cited \"profound errors of judgment\" in the way OU leaders dealt with Lanner and also noted a larger problem of \"poor management practices\" in the OU, including a lack of accountability by professionals to volunteer leadership, lack of involvement by lay leaders in matters of governance, lack of financial controls and a \"total absence of any policies regarding basic ethical issues\" in both the OU and NCSY.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=6318|title=News report 2001|date=|publisher=Jewishjournal.com|accessdate=2012-07-04}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs a result of the Lanner scandal, NCSY conducted a thoroughgoing internal review and reformed its structures and running.

Another tradition from Malik transmitted through other chains of narrations, mentions that the [[Jabal al-Nour|mount Nur]] was visible between the two parts of the moon (Mount Nur is located in [[Hijaz]]. Muslims believe that Muhammad received his first revelations from God in a cave on this mountain, [[Cave of Hira']]). A tradition narrated on the authority of [[Jubayr ibn Mut'im]] with a single chain of transmission says that the two parts of the moon stood on two mountains. This tradition further states that the Meccan responded by saying \"Muhammad has taken us by his magic... If he was able to take us by magic, he will not be able to do so with all people.\" Traditions transmitted on the authority of [[Ibn Abbas]] briefly mention the incident and do not provide much details.<ref name=\"kathir\">[[Ibn Kathir]], ''Tafsir ibn Kathir'', Sura Qamar, verses 54:1\u20132</ref> Traditions transmitted on the authority of [[Abdullah bin Masud]] describe the incident as follows:<ref name=\"kathir\"/><ref>[[Sahih Muslim]], ''The Book Giving Description of the Day of Judgement, Paradise and Hell'', Book 039, Number 6725</ref>\n\n<blockquote>We were along with God's Messenger at Mina, that moon was split up into two. One of its parts was behind the mountain and the other one was on this side of the mountain. God's Messenger said to us: Bear witness to this {{Hadith-usc|muslim|039|6725}}</blockquote>\n\nThe narrative was used by some later Muslims to convince others of the prophethood of Muhammad. [[Annemarie Schimmel]] for example quotes the following from Muslim scholar [[Qadi Iyad]] who worked in the 12th century:<ref name=\"Annemarie Schimmel\"/>\n\n<blockquote>It has not been said of any people on the earth that the moon was observed that night such that it could be stated that it was ''not'' split. Even if this had been reported from many different places, so that one would have to exclude the possibility that all agreed upon a lie, yet, we would not accept this as proof to the contrary, for the moon is not seen in the same way by different people... An eclipse is visible in one country but not in the other one; in one place it is total, in the other one only partial.</blockquote>\n\n== Other perspectives ==\n[[Al-Zamakhshari]], a commentator of the Qur'an, acknowledged the splitting of the moon as one of Muhammad's miracles. But he also suggested that the splitting might take place only on the [[Islamic view of the Last Judgment|day of judgment]].<ref name=\"Mourison\"/> The Muslim scholar [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali|Yusuf Ali]] provides three different interpretations of the verse. He holds that perhaps all three are applicable to the verse: Moon once appeared cleft asunder at the time of Muhammad in order to convince the unbelievers. It will split again when the day of judgment approaches (here the prophetic past tense is taken to indicate the future). Yusuf Ali connects this incident with the disruption of the solar system mentioned in {{cite quran|75|8-9|style=nosup|expand=no}}. Lastly, he says that the verses can be metaphorical, meaning that the matter has become clear as the moon.<ref name=\"Yusuf Ali\">Yusuf Ali, ''Meaning of The Noble Qur\u2019an'', Sura 54, v.1</ref>\n\nSome dissenting commentators who do not accept the miracle narration believe that the verse only refers to the splitting of the moon at the [[Islamic view of the Last Judgment|day of judgment]].<ref name=\"Allameh\">[[Allameh Tabatabaei]], [[Tafsir al-Mizan]], Verse 54:1-2</ref><ref>[http://holyquran.net/cgi-bin/majma.pl Majma Ul-Bayan]</ref> Likewise, [[M. A. S. Abdel Haleem]] writes:\n\n<blockquote>The Arabic uses the past tense, as if that Day were already here, to help the reader/listener imagine how it will be. Some traditional commentators hold the view that this describes an actual event at the time of the Prophet, but it clearly refers to the end of the world.<ref>M. A. S. Abdel Haleem: ''The Qur'an, a new translation'', note to 54:1</ref></blockquote>\n\nSome Muslim scholars argue that an astronomical event must have happened at that time, which made it appear as if the Moon had been split in two, because the phenomenon was seen at least in India as well.<ref>http://www.cyberistan.org/islamic/farmas.html</ref> One such possible lunar event could be a large asteroid hitting the Moon, and the plume and debris from the strike blocking enough lunar view to make it appear as if the Moon had split in two. A second possibility could be a celestial body passing between Earth and the Moon and blocking some part of lunar surface for short time. Moreover, in the light of the verse that was revealed at that time, the word \"Saa'at\" also means spiritual revolution, so the event also symbolized the end of the Pagan Arab culture and religions which used Moon as their symbol or worshipped moon gods.\n\nWestern historians such as A .J. Wensinck and Denis Gril, reject the historicity of the miracle arguing that the Qur'an itself denies miracles, in their traditional sense, in connection with Muhammad.<ref name=\"EoI-Muhammad\">Wensinck, A.J. \"Mu\u02bfd\u0332j\u0332iza\".

The philosophers held that nature was composed of four fundamental elements: earth, air, fire, and water. These philosophers however held that the composition of heavenly bodies were different. This belief was based on the observation that the motion of heavenly bodies, unlike that of terrestrial bodies, was circular and without any beginnings or ends. This appearance of eternity in the heavenly bodies, led the philosophers to conclude that the heavens were inviolable. Theologians on the other hand proposed their own conception of the terrestrial matter: the nature was composed of uniform atoms that were re-created at every instant by God (the latter idea was added to defend God's omnipotence against the encroachment of the independent secondary causes). According to this conception, the heavenly bodies were essentially the same as the terrestrial bodies, and thus could be pierced.<ref name=\"Mourison\"/>\n\nIn order to deal with implication of the traditional understanding of the Quranic verse {{cite quran|54|1\u20132|style=nosup|expand=no}}, some philosophers argued that the verse should be interpreted metaphorically (e.g. the verse could have referred to a partial lunar eclipse in which then Earth obscured part of the Moon).<ref name=\"Mourison\">Robert G. Mourison, ''The Portrayal of Nature in a Medieval Qur\u2019an Commentary'', Studia Islamica, 2002</ref>\n\n== Literature ==\nThis tradition has inspired many Muslim poets, especially in India.<ref name=\"EoI-Muhammad\"/> In poetical language Muhammad is sometimes equated with the Sun or the morning light. As such, part of a poem from [[Sana'i]], a renowned early twelfth century [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Sufi]] poet, reads: \"the sun should split the moon in two\".<ref name=\"Annemarie Schimmel\"/> [[Rumi|Jalal ad-Din Rumi]], a renowned Persian-writing poet and mystic, in one of his poems conveys the idea that to be split by the Muhammad's finger is the greatest bliss the lowly moon can hope for and a devoted believer splits the moon with Muhammad's finger.<ref name=\"Annemarie Schimmel\"/> Elaborating on this idea, [[Jami|Abd ar-Rahman Jami]], one of the classical poets and mystics of Persia, plays with the shapes and numerical values of [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic letters]] in a complicated way: The full moon, Jami says, resembles the Arabic letter for a circular m with the numerical value 40. When Muhammad split the moon, it became like two crescent-shaped n's (the Arabic letter for \"n\") whose numerical value is 50 each. This would mean that, thanks for the miracle, the value of moon had increased.<ref name=\"Annemarie Schimmel\"/>\n\nIn another place [[Rumi]], according to Schimmel, alludes to two miracles attributed to Muhammad in tradition, i.e. the splitting of the moon (which shows the futility of man's scientific approach to nature), and the other that Muhammad was illiterate.<ref name=\"Annemarie Schimmel\"/>\n\n{{anchor|Modern claims of evidence}}\n==NASA photograph==\n[[File:Rima Ariadaeus-1.jpg|thumb|upright|NASA photograph from [[Apollo 10]] in 1969.

Another tradition from Malik transmitted through other chains of narrations, mentions that the [[Jabal al-Nour|mount Nur]] was visible between the two parts of the moon (Mount Nur is located in [[Hijaz]]. Muslims believe that Muhammad received his first revelations from God in a cave on this mountain, [[Cave of Hira']]). A tradition narrated on the authority of [[Jubayr ibn Mut'im]] with a single chain of transmission says that the two parts of the moon stood on two mountains. This tradition further states that the Meccan responded by saying \"Muhammad has taken us by his magic... If he was able to take us by magic, he will not be able to do so with all people.\" Traditions transmitted on the authority of [[Ibn Abbas]] briefly mention the incident and do not provide much details.<ref name=\"kathir\">[[Ibn Kathir]], ''Tafsir ibn Kathir'', Sura Qamar, verses 54:1\u20132</ref> Traditions transmitted on the authority of [[Abdullah bin Masud]] describe the incident as follows:<ref name=\"kathir\"/><ref>[[Sahih Muslim]], ''The Book Giving Description of the Day of Judgement, Paradise and Hell'', Book 039, Number 6725</ref>\n\n<blockquote>We were along with God's Messenger at Mina, that moon was split up into two. One of its parts was behind the mountain and the other one was on this side of the mountain. God's Messenger said to us: Bear witness to this {{Hadith-usc|muslim|039|6725}}</blockquote>\n\nThe narrative was used by some later Muslims to convince others of the prophethood of Muhammad. [[Annemarie Schimmel]] for example quotes the following from Muslim scholar [[Qadi Iyad]] who worked in the 12th century:<ref name=\"Annemarie Schimmel\"/>\n\n<blockquote>It has not been said of any people on the earth that the moon was observed that night such that it could be stated that it was ''not'' split. Even if this had been reported from many different places, so that one would have to exclude the possibility that all agreed upon a lie, yet, we would not accept this as proof to the contrary, for the moon is not seen in the same way by different people... An eclipse is visible in one country but not in the other one; in one place it is total, in the other one only partial.</blockquote>\n\n== Other perspectives ==\n[[Al-Zamakhshari]], a commentator of the Qur'an, acknowledged the splitting of the moon as one of Muhammad's miracles. But he also suggested that the splitting might take place only on the [[Islamic view of the Last Judgment|day of judgment]].<ref name=\"Mourison\"/> The Muslim scholar [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali|Yusuf Ali]] provides three different interpretations of the verse. He holds that perhaps all three are applicable to the verse: Moon once appeared cleft asunder at the time of Muhammad in order to convince the unbelievers. It will split again when the day of judgment approaches (here the prophetic past tense is taken to indicate the future). Yusuf Ali connects this incident with the disruption of the solar system mentioned in {{cite quran|75|8-9|style=nosup|expand=no}}. Lastly, he says that the verses can be metaphorical, meaning that the matter has become clear as the moon.<ref name=\"Yusuf Ali\">Yusuf Ali, ''Meaning of The Noble Qur\u2019an'', Sura 54, v.1</ref>\n\nSome dissenting commentators who do not accept the miracle narration believe that the verse only refers to the splitting of the moon at the [[Islamic view of the Last Judgment|day of judgment]].<ref name=\"Allameh\">[[Allameh Tabatabaei]], [[Tafsir al-Mizan]], Verse 54:1-2</ref><ref>[http://holyquran.net/cgi-bin/majma.pl Majma Ul-Bayan]</ref> Likewise, [[M. A. S. Abdel Haleem]] writes:\n\n<blockquote>The Arabic uses the past tense, as if that Day were already here, to help the reader/listener imagine how it will be. Some traditional commentators hold the view that this describes an actual event at the time of the Prophet, but it clearly refers to the end of the world.<ref>M. A. S. Abdel Haleem: ''The Qur'an, a new translation'', note to 54:1</ref></blockquote>\n\nSome Muslim scholars argue that an astronomical event must have happened at that time, which made it appear as if the Moon had been split in two, because the phenomenon was seen at least in India as well.<ref>http://www.cyberistan.org/islamic/farmas.html</ref> One such possible lunar event could be a large asteroid hitting the Moon, and the plume and debris from the strike blocking enough lunar view to make it appear as if the Moon had split in two. A second possibility could be a celestial body passing between Earth and the Moon and blocking some part of lunar surface for short time. Moreover, in the light of the verse that was revealed at that time, the word \"Saa'at\" also means spiritual revolution, so the event also symbolized the end of the Pagan Arab culture and religions which used Moon as their symbol or worshipped moon gods.\n\nWestern historians such as A .J. Wensinck and Denis Gril, reject the historicity of the miracle arguing that the Qur'an itself denies miracles, in their traditional sense, in connection with Muhammad.<ref name=\"EoI-Muhammad\">Wensinck, A.J. \"Mu\u02bfd\u0332j\u0332iza\".

The philosophers held that nature was composed of four fundamental elements: earth, air, fire, and water. These philosophers however held that the composition of heavenly bodies were different. This belief was based on the observation that the motion of heavenly bodies, unlike that of terrestrial bodies, was circular and without any beginnings or ends. This appearance of eternity in the heavenly bodies, led the philosophers to conclude that the heavens were inviolable. Theologians on the other hand proposed their own conception of the terrestrial matter: the nature was composed of uniform atoms that were re-created at every instant by God (the latter idea was added to defend God's omnipotence against the encroachment of the independent secondary causes). According to this conception, the heavenly bodies were essentially the same as the terrestrial bodies, and thus could be pierced.<ref name=\"Mourison\"/>\n\nIn order to deal with implication of the traditional understanding of the Quranic verse {{cite quran|54|1\u20132|style=nosup|expand=no}}, some philosophers argued that the verse should be interpreted metaphorically (e.g. the verse could have referred to a partial lunar eclipse in which then Earth obscured part of the Moon).<ref name=\"Mourison\">Robert G. Mourison, ''The Portrayal of Nature in a Medieval Qur\u2019an Commentary'', Studia Islamica, 2002</ref>\n\n== Literature ==\nThis tradition has inspired many Muslim poets, especially in India.<ref name=\"EoI-Muhammad\"/> In poetical language Muhammad is sometimes equated with the Sun or the morning light. As such, part of a poem from [[Sana'i]], a renowned early twelfth century [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Sufi]] poet, reads: \"the sun should split the moon in two\".<ref name=\"Annemarie Schimmel\"/> [[Rumi|Jalal ad-Din Rumi]], a renowned Persian-writing poet and mystic, in one of his poems conveys the idea that to be split by the Muhammad's finger is the greatest bliss the lowly moon can hope for and a devoted believer splits the moon with Muhammad's finger.<ref name=\"Annemarie Schimmel\"/> Elaborating on this idea, [[Jami|Abd ar-Rahman Jami]], one of the classical poets and mystics of Persia, plays with the shapes and numerical values of [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic letters]] in a complicated way: The full moon, Jami says, resembles the Arabic letter for a circular m with the numerical value 40. When Muhammad split the moon, it became like two crescent-shaped n's (the Arabic letter for \"n\") whose numerical value is 50 each. This would mean that, thanks for the miracle, the value of moon had increased.<ref name=\"Annemarie Schimmel\"/>\n\nIn another place [[Rumi]], according to Schimmel, alludes to two miracles attributed to Muhammad in tradition, i.e. the splitting of the moon (which shows the futility of man's scientific approach to nature), and the other that Muhammad was illiterate.<ref name=\"Annemarie Schimmel\"/>\n\n{{anchor|Modern claims of evidence}}\n==NASA photograph==\n[[File:Rima Ariadaeus-1.jpg|thumb|upright|NASA photograph from [[Apollo 10]] in 1969.
