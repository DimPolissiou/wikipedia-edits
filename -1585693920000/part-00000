{"title_page": "History of the United States Coast Guard", "text_new": "{{Use American English|date=October 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2013}}\nThe '''history of the [[United States Coast Guard]]''' goes back to the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]], which was founded on 4 August 1790 as part of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]].  The Revenue Cutter Service and the [[United States Life-Saving Service]] were merged to become the Coast Guard per {{USC|14|1}} which states: \"The Coast Guard as established January 28, 1915, shall be a military service and a branch of the armed forces of the United States at all times.\"  In 1939, the [[United States Lighthouse Service]] was merged into the Coast Guard.  The Coast Guard itself was moved to the [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] in 1967, and on 25 February 2003 it became part of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]. However, under {{USC|14|3}} as amended by section 211 of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006, upon the declaration of war and when [[United States Congress|Congress]] so directs in the declaration, or when the [[President of the United States|President]] directs, the Coast Guard operates as a service in the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]].\n\n==Early history==\n===The Revenue-Marine===\nThe modern Coast Guard was created in 1915 by the merger of the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]] and the [[United States Lifesaving Service]], but its roots go back to the early days of the Republic. [[Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Alexander Hamilton]] lobbied Congress to authorize a [[First ten Revenue Service cutters|\"system of cutters\"]] to enforce tariffs, which was major source of revenue for the new nation. On 4 August 1790 (now recognized as the Coast Guard's official birthday), Congress passed the Tariff Act, permitting the construction of ten cutters and the recruitment of 40 revenue officers. Each cutter was assigned one master and three mates who were commissioned officers. In addition each cutter was allowed four mariners and two boys. <ref name=Evans5>Evans, p.5</ref> The cutters were collectively referred to as the \"Revenue-Marine,\" and later officially organized as the \"Revenue Cutter Service.\" Initially, the  was not an organized service. Each revenue cutter operated independently, with each assigned to patrol a section of the east coast and reporting directly to the [[Customs House]] in a major port. From 1790, when the [[Continental Navy]] was disbanded, to 1798, when the [[United States Navy]] was created, these \"revenue cutters\" were the country's only naval force.<ref name=Evans14>Evans, p. 14</ref> As such, the cutters and their crews took on a wide variety of duties beyond the enforcement of tariffs, including combating piracy, rescuing mariners in distress, ferrying government officials, and even carrying mail. In 1794, the Revenue-Marine was given the mission of preventing trading in slaves from Africa to the United States. Between 1794 and 1865, the Service captured approximately 500 slave ships. In 1808, the Service was responsible for enforcing President [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s embargo closing U.S. ports to European trade. The 1822 Timber Act tasked the Revenue Cutter Service with protecting government timber from poachers (this is viewed as the beginning of the Coast Guard's environmental protection mission).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-cp/comrel/factfile/Factcards/Resources.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=31 July 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720081519/http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-cp/comrel/factfile/Factcards/Resources.html |archive-date=20 July 2006 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> During times of war or crisis, the revenue cutters and their crews were put at the disposal of the Navy. The Revenue-Marine involved in the [[Quasi-War]] with France from 1798 to 1799, the [[War of 1812]], and the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].\n\n===United States Revenue Cutter Service===\n[[File:Seal of the United States Revenue Cutter Service.png|thumb|Seal of the United States Revenue Cutter Service]] \nDuring the [[American Civil War]], USRC ''[[USS Harriet Lane (1857)|Harriet Lane]]'' fired the first naval shots of the war, engaging the steamer ''Nashville'' during the siege of [[Fort Sumter]].<ref name=Evans75>Evans, p. 75</ref> Upon the order of President Lincoln to the Secretary of the Treasury on 14 June 1863, cutters were assigned to the [[North Atlantic Blockading Squadron]]. A [[Confederate Revenue-Marine]] was also formed by crewmen who left the Revenue Cutter Service.\n\nAfter the purchase of Alaska in 1867, {{USRC|Lincoln}}, commanded by First Lieutenant George W. Moore was dispatched to [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] to establish United States sovereignty and make a reconnaissance of the coastline.<ref name=Noble(1990)49>Noble (1990), p. 49</ref><ref name=Evans107>Evans, p. 107</ref> In the 1880s through the 1890s, the Revenue Cutter Service was instrumental in the development of [[Alaska]].

Congress awarded the three men [[Congressional Gold Medal]]s for \"heroic service rendered\" on 28 June 1902.<ref name=Evans134-139>Evans, pp. 134\u2013139</ref> During the [[Snake River gold rush]] of 1900, the Revenue Cutter Service returned destitute miners to Seattle from Alaska.\n\n===United States Lifesaving Service===\n[[File:Seal of the United States Life-Saving Service.png|thumb|Seal of the United States Life-Saving Service]]\nA number of voluntary organizations had formed in coastal communities in the 1700s and early 1800s to assist shipwrecked mariners by means of small boats at shore-based stations, notably the [[Massachusetts Humane Society]] (est. 1758). These stations were normally unoccupied \u2013 essentially storehouses for boats and equipment to be used by volunteers. With the signing of the Newell Act on August 14, 1848, Congress appropriated $10,000 to fund lifesaving stations along the east coast. These were loosely administered by the Revenue-Marine, but still dependent on volunteers (like many fire departments of the time).\n\nThis system continued until 1871 when [[Sumner Kimball]] was appointed Chief of the Revenue Marine Division of the Treasury Department. Kimball convinced Congress to appropriate $200,000 to construct new stations, repair old ones, and provide full-time crews. Shortly thereafter, in 1878, the U.S. Lifesaving Service was officially born and so-named.\n\nAlthough the Revenue Cutter Service is perhaps more recognized as ''the'' predecessor of the Coast Guard, the Lifesaving Service's legacy is apparent in many ways, not the least of which is the prominence of the Coast Guard's search and rescue mission in the eyes of the public. The Coast Guard takes its unofficial search and rescue motto, \"You have to go out, but you don't have to come back,\" from the 1899 regulations of the [[United States Life Saving Service]], which stated:\n\n<blockquote>In attempting a rescue the keeper will select either the boat, breeches buoy, or life car, as in his judgment is best suited to effectively cope with the existing conditions. If the device first selected fails after such trial as satisfies him that no further attempt with it is feasible, he will resort to one of the others, and if that fails, then to the remaining one, and he will not desist from his efforts until by actual trial the impossibility of effecting a rescue is demonstrated. The statement of the keeper that he did not try to use the boat because the sea or surf was too heavy will not be accepted unless attempts to launch it were actually made and failed [underlining added], or unless the conformation of the coast\u2014as bluffs, precipitous banks, etc.\u2014is such as to unquestionably preclude the use of a boat.</blockquote>\n\nThese regulations were repeated in the 1934 Coast Guard regulations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nA number of Coast Guard traditions survive from, or pay homage to, the Lifesaving Service as well. For example, members of the Lifesaving Service were referred to as \"surfmen,\" and today the [[Surfman Badge]] it awarded to [[coxswains]] who qualify to operate motor lifeboats in heavy surf conditions. The badge's design is similar to the Lifesaving Service's seal.\n\n===Coast Guard Academy===\nThe School of Instruction of the Revenue Cutter Service was established in 1876, near New Bedford, Massachusetts. It used the [[USRC James C. Dobbin (1853)|USRC ''Dobbin'']] for its training exercises.  It moved to Curtis Bay, Maryland in 1900 and then again in 1910 to Fort Trumbull, near New London, Connecticut. The school provided a two-year premise to ship supplemented by some class work and tutoring in technical subjects.  In 1903, the third year of instruction was added.  The school was oriented to line officers, as engineers were hired directly from civilian life.  In 1906, an engineering program for cadets began. Nevertheless, the school remained small, with 5 to 10 cadets per class. In 1914 the School became the Revenue Cutter Academy and with the merger of the Revenue Cutter Service and the Life Saving Service in 1915, it became the [[United States Coast Guard Academy]]. In February 1929, Congress appropriated $1,750,000 for construction of buildings to be used for the academy. The city of New London purchased the land on the Thames River and donated it to the government for use as a Coast Guard facility. Construction began in 1931 and the first cadets began occupying the new facilities in 1932.<ref name=Johnson109>Johnson, p 109</ref>\n\n===Creation of the modern Coast Guard===\nOn 28 January 1915, the United States Revenue Cutter Service and the United States Lifesaving Service were merged by act of Congress to form the United States Coast Guard.<ref name=Johnson32>Johnson, p. 32</ref>  The [[United States Lighthouse Service]] was absorbed by the Coast Guard in 1939.

All cutters were to report to the nearest Naval District commander and stand by for further orders.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)7>Larzelere (2003), p. 7</ref> All normal operations were suspended with the exception of rescues pending orders from the Navy. [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Josephus Daniels]] directed that although the Coast Guard was then a part of the Navy, that most of the administrative details handled by Coast Guard Headquarters would not be changed.  At the outset of the war the Coast Guard consisted of less than 4000 officers and men, had 23 cruising cutters, 21 harbor cutters, 272 rescue stations and 21 cadets at the Coast Guard Academy.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)11-16>Larzelere (2003), pp. 11\u201416</ref><ref name=Larzelere(2003)21>Larzelere (2003), p.21</ref> The Coast Guard was still in a formative stage of development from the merger of the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service and the U.S. Lifesaving Service.  Because of this fact, there was not much interaction between the two former entities during the war.  A qualified Lifesaving Service surfman who wished to transfer to a cutter had to be reduced to ordinary seaman upon reporting because of a lack of shipboard skills. Because of this transfers were infrequent.  There were no chief petty officers in the Coast Guard at this time and Coast Guard petty officers assigned to Navy ships often served under less experienced supervisors for less pay.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)19>Larzelere (2003), p. 19</ref>\n\n\nCoast Guard cutters were seen by the Navy as ready assets and were used to fill in for a rapidly expanding Navy.  The Navy recognized Coast Guard officers and petty officers as the experienced mariners that they were and often put them on Navy ships to fill in for crew shortages and lack of experience.\n\n=== Sinking of USCGC Tampa ===\nDuring the late afternoon of 26 September 1918, ''Tampa'' parted company with convoy HG-107, which she had just escorted into the [[Irish Sea]] from Gibraltar. Ordered to put into [[Milford Haven]], [[Wales]], she proceeded independently toward her destination.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)47>Larzelere (2003), p. 47</ref> At 1930 that evening, as she transited the [[Bristol Channel]], the warship was spotted by {{SMU|UB-91||2}}. According to the submarine war diary entry, the U-boat dived and maneuvered into an attack position, firing one torpedo out of the stern tube at 2015 from a range of about 550 meters. Minutes later, the torpedo hit ''Tampa'' and exploded portside amidships, throwing up a huge, luminous column of water.<ref name=Johnson55>Johnson, p 55</ref> The cutter sank with all hands: 111 Coast Guardsmen, 4 U.S. Navy sailors, and 16 passengers consisting of 11 [[Royal Navy]] sailors and 5 [[United States Maritime Service|Maritime Service Merchant Marines]].<ref name=Larzelere(2003)49>Larzelere (2003), p. 49</ref> The sinking of ''Tampa'' was the largest single loss of Coast Guard personnel in the war.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)50>Larzelere (2003), p. 50</ref> She sank in the [[Bristol Channel]] at roughly {{coord|50|40|N|6|19|W}}.<ref name=DANFS>''Tampa'', Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, U.S. Navy Naval History & Heritage Command</ref>\n\n\nDuring the war, in 1918, twin sisters Genevieve and Lucille Baker of the Naval Coastal Defense Reserve became the first uniformed women to serve in the Coast Guard.<ref name=\"cbc.ca\">{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/military-international/ | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130328085505/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/military-international |archivedate=28 March 2013 |title=Women in the military \u2013 international |date=30 May 2006 |work=CBC News | url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=WHC>\"Women's History Chronology\", Women & the U.

The effort was not entirely successful, due to the slowness of the destroyers.  However, the mission provided many Coast Guard officers and [[petty officer]]s with operational experience which proved invaluable in [[World War II]]. The Navy's epithet of \"Hooligan Navy\" dates from this era, due to the Coast Guard's flexibility in enlisting men discharged from other services to rapidly expand; it has endured due to the high proportion of prior-other-service enlisteds, and become a term of pride within the service.\n\n===1927 Mississippi River flood===\n\nDuring the disastrous [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927|1927 Mississippi River flood]], the Coast Guard rescued a total of 43,853 persons who they \"removed from perilous positions to places of safety\".  Additionally, they saved 11,313 head of livestock and furnished transportation for 72 persons in need of hospitalization.  In all 674 Coast Guardsmen and 128 Coast Guard vessels and boats served in the relief operations.<ref name=Johnson99>Johnson, p 99</ref>\n\n==The 1930s==\n\n===Increasing regulation of merchant shipping===\nThe Steamboat Inspection Service was merged with the Bureau of Navigation, created in 1884, to oversee the regulation of merchant seamen, on 30 June 1932.\n\nIn 1934, the passenger vessel [[SS Morro Castle (1930)|SS ''Morro Castle'']] suffered a serious fire off the coast of New Jersey, which ultimately claimed the lives of 124 passenger and crew.  The casualty prompted new [[fire protection]] standards for vessels and paved the way for the \"Act of May 27, 1936\", which reorganized and changed the name of the Bureau of Navigation and Steamboat Inspection Service to the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation.\n\nMarine inspection and navigation duties under the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation were temporarily transferred to the Coast Guard by executive order on 28 February 1942. This transfer of duties fit well with the Coast Guard's port safety and security missions, and was made permanent in 1946.\n<ref>[https://www.piersystem.com/go/doc/786/166737/ \"Statement of Admiral Thad w.

The [[Greenland Patrol]] was maintained by the Coast Guard for the duration of the war.\n\n[[File:These Negro members of a Coast Guard Horse Patrol unit patrol beaches in the New Jersey area in all kinds of weather. - NARA - 535853.jpg|thumb|US Coast Guard Horse Patrol, circa 1941-45]]\n\n[[File:Attack on Pearl Harbor Japanese planes view.jpg|thumb|Attack on Pearl Harbor Japanese planes view]]\nThe Coast Guard became directly involved in the first WW2 attack on America in the 1941 [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Supporting U.S. naval forces on December 7, were the Coast Guard cutters, patrol boats, bases, stations, lighthouses and personnel assigned to the 14th Naval District. These units included high-endurance cutter Taney and patrol cutters Tiger and Reliance; buoy tenders Kukui and Walnut; patrol boats CG-400, CG-403, CG-27, and CG-8; a buoy boat and the former Lighthouse Service launch Lehua all participated in the battle shooting at several aircraft. Coast Guard aviator, Lt. Frank Erickson, who later pioneered search and rescue helicopter flight, was standing watch at Ford Island before the attack then took command of an anti-aircraft battery to fight off multiple enemy aircraft.\n\nThe {{USCGC|Taney|WHEC-37|}}, a notable [[World War II]] era high endurance cutter, is the only warship still afloat today (as a [[museum ship]] in [[Baltimore]]) that was present for the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, although she was actually stationed in nearby Honolulu.\n\n\nDuring World War II, there was great concern about enemy vessels nearing U.S. shores, allowing adversarial forces to invade the nation. The beach patrols gained increased importance as security forces with three basic functions: to look for and report on any suspicious vessels operating in the area; to report and prevent attempts of landings by the enemy; and to prevent communication between persons on shore and the enemy at sea.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Young |first1=Stephanie |title=Mounted beach patrol: When the service saddled up |url=https://coastguard.dodlive.mil/2012/08/mounted-beach-patrol-when-the-service-saddled-up |website=Coast Guard Compass |publisher=US Coast Guard |accessdate=13 September 2019 |date=August 28, 2012}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nThe {{USCGC|Modoc|WPG-46|}}, was peripherally involved in the chase and sinking of the German [[battleship]] [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']].\n\nShortly after Germany declared war on the United States, German [[submarine]]s began [[Second happy time|Operation Drumbeat]] ''(\"Paukenschlag\"),'' <!-- was (\"Kesselpauke\"),--> sinking ships off the American coast.  Many Coast Guard cutters were involved in rescue operations following German attacks on American shipping.  The {{USCGC|Icarus|WPC-110|}}, a 165-foot (50 m) cutter that previously had been a rumrunner chaser during [[Prohibition]], sank [[German submarine U-352|''U-352'']] on 9 May 1942, off the coast of [[Cape Lookout, North Carolina]], and took 33 prisoners, the first Germans taken in combat by any U.S. force.\n\nThe {{USCGC|Thetis|WPC-115|}} sank [[German submarine U-157 (1941)|''U-157'']] on 10 June 1942.  During the war, Coast Guard units sank 12 German and two Japanese submarines and captured two German surface vessels.\n\nWhen the {{USCGC|Campbell|WPG-32|}} rammed and sank the German U-606, her enlisted mascot [[Sinbad (USCG)|Sinbad]] became a public hero at home and brought attention to the role of the Coast Guard in convoy protection.\n\nCoast Guardsmen also patrolled the shores of the United States during the war. On 13 June 1942 Seaman 2nd Class John Cullen, patrolling the beach in [[Amagansett, New York]], discovered the first landing of German saboteurs in [[Operation Pastorius]].  Cullen was the first American who actually came in contact with the enemy on the shores of the United States during the war and his report led to the capture of the German sabotage team. For this, Cullen received the [[Legion of Merit]].<ref>http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-cp/cb/PDFs/Sept_2005.pdf</ref>\n\nThe Coast Guard had 30 [[Edsall class destroyer escort]]s under its command that were used primarily for [[Convoy#World War II|convoy]] escort duty in the [[Battle of the Atlantic|Atlantic]].<ref>{{cite web|title=US Navy Destroyer Escorts|url=http://www.pxarchive.de/home/navy/des.html|accessdate=12 December 2011}}</ref> Other United States Navy ships under Coast Guard command included:<ref name=mfw>{{cite book |last=Willoughby |first=Malcolm F. |authorlink = |title =The U.S. Coast Guard in World War II |url=https://archive.org/details/uscoastguardinw00will |url-access=registration |publisher =[[United States Naval Institute]] |volume = |edition = |date =1957 |location =[[Annapolis, Maryland]] |pages=169&170 |isbn =}}</ref>\n* 75 [[Tacoma-class frigate|patrol frigates]]\n*  8 [[Flower-class corvette]]s\n* 22 [[Troopship]]s\n* 20 [[Amphibious cargo ship]]s\n*  9 [[Attack transport]]s\n* 76 [[Landing Ship, Tank]]\n* 28 [[Landing Craft Infantry]]\n* 18 [[Mettawee class gasoline tanker|gasoline tankers]]\n* 10 [[Submarine chaser]]s\n* 40 [[Yard patrol boat]]s\n\nIn addition to antisubmarine operations,<ref>{{cite video\n | year =1945\n | title =Video: Santo Tomas Prisoners Liberated, 1945/03/01 (1945)\n | url =https://archive.org/details/1945-03-01_Santo_Tomas_Prisoners_Liberated\n | publisher =[[Universal Newsreel]]\n | accessdate =21 February 2012\n}}</ref> the Coast Guard worked closely with the U.S. Navy and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]].

Coast Guard cutters and ships partially crewed by Coast Guardsmen were used in the North African invasion of November 1942 ([[Operation Torch]]) and the invasion of [[Sicily]] in 1943 ([[Operation Husky]]).

Gale-force winds had slowed her progress and she was running low on fuel.  Too far from Newfoundland and unable to make it back to Ireland, the captain, Charles Martin, twenty-six-year-old ex-Navy pilot, decided to fly toward  {{USCGC|Bibb|WPG-31|}} which was on [[Ocean Station Charlie]] in the North Atlantic.  The plane's captain decided to ditch and have his passengers and crew picked up by ''Bibb''.  In 30-foot (10 m) seas, the transfer was both difficult and dangerous.  Initially the ''Bibb's'' captain, Capt. Paul B. Cronk, tried to pass a line to the plane which taxied to the lee side of the cutter.  A collision with the cutter ended this attempt to save the passengers.  With worsening weather, a fifteen-man rubber raft and a small boat were deployed from the ship.  The raft was guided to the escape door of the aircraft.  Passengers jumped into the raft which was then pulled to the boat.  After rescuing 47 of the passengers, worsening conditions and the approach of darkness forced the rescue's suspension.  By dawn, improved weather allowed the rescue to resume and the remaining passengers and crew were transferred to the ''Bibb''.  The rescue made headlines throughout the country and upon their arrival in Boston, ''Bibb'' and her crew received a hero's welcome for having saved all those aboard the ditched ''Bermuda Sky Queen''.<ref name=CGN /><ref>{{British pathe|13803| Newsreel footage of 1947 Bermuda Sky Queen incident}}.

This act charged the Coast Guard with ensuring the security of the United States' ports and harbors on a permanent basis.  In addition, the Coast Guard established a series of weather ships in the north Pacific Ocean and assisted civilian and military aircraft and ships in distress, and established a string of [[LORAN]] stations in Japan and Korea that assisted the United Nations forces.\n\n===''Pendleton'' rescue===\n{{main|SS Pendleton}}\n[[File:Pendleton Sinking Ship.jpg|thumb|Bow section of the ''Pendleton'', 19 February 1952]]\nOn 18 February 1952, during a severe \"[[nor'easter]]\" off the New England coast, the [[T2 tanker]]s [[SS Fort Mercer|SS ''Fort Mercer'']] and [[SS Pendleton|SS ''Pendleton'']] broke in half.

Squadron One assisted in [[Operation Market Time]] by interdicting resupply by sea of [[Viet Cong]] and North Vietnamese forces. The Coast Guard developed a \"piggyback\" weapon that proved highly useful; an [[M2 Browning machine gun]] placed over a [[M29 mortar|81mm mortar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcf45.com/misfire/81-50.html|title=Coast Guard Piggyback Weapon|publisher=}}</ref> Seventeen [[Point class cutter|''Point class'']] 82-foot WPB cutters were transferred to coastal waters off Vietnam with their Coast Guard crews under the operational control of the [[U.S. Navy]] [[U.S. Seventh Fleet|Seventh Fleet]].

They were involved in combat search and rescue operations in both Vietnam and Laos.<ref>http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/KaliszThomasCGAviationVTN.pdf</ref>\n\nThe Coast Guard provided Explosive Loading Detachments (ELD) to the [[U.S. Army]] [[1st Logistics Command]] in several locations in Vietnam.  The ELD's were responsible for the supervision of Army stevedores in the unloading of explosives and ammunition from U.S. Merchant Marine ships. The ELD's were also responsible for assisting the Army in port security operations at each port and eventually were made a part of a Port Security and Waterways Detail (PS&WD) reporting to the Commanding General, United States Army, Vietnam ([[USARV]]). They earned the Army [[Meritorious Unit Commendation]] for their efforts.\n\nOn 13 December 1965 [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] requested Coast Guard assistance in constructing a chain of [[LORAN-C]] stations for use by naval vessels and combat aircraft for operations in Southeast Asia.<ref name=Larzelere(1997)193>Larzelere (1997), p. 193</ref> Construction started almost immediately at five locations in Thailand and Vietnam and they were fully operational on 28 October 1966.<ref name=Larzelere(1997)203>Larzelere (1997), p. 203</ref>\n\nOn 22 April 1966, {{USCGC|Planetree|WLB-307|}} arrived in [[Cam Ranh Bay]] to commence [[Aids to Navigation]] (ATON) operations in the coastal waters of South Vietnam. She was responsible for the marking of freshly cut channels and harbors with buoys and daymarks so that merchant and naval ships could safely navigate the waters. This direct support mission ended on 17 May 1971 with the departure of the last buoy tender, {{USCGC|Blackhaw|WLB-390|}}. The buoy tender crews were tasked with training South Vietnamese crews in the ATON effort prior to the departure of the ''Blackhaw'' as a part of the '[[Vietnamization]]' policy of the Nixon Administration.  After May 1971 ATON was serviced on a 'as needed' basis by {{USCGC|Basswood|WLB-388|}} homeported in Guam.\n\nIn August 1970 the Coast Guard finished turning over to the South Vietnamese Navy the patrol boats of Squadron One. The training of South Vietnamese crews had started in February 1969 and continued through to the end of operations for Squadron One. {{USCGC|Yakutat|WHEC-380|}} and {{USCGC|Bering Strait|WHEC-382|}} were turned over to the South Vietnamese Navy on 1 January 1971. Eventually three other WHECs were turned over to the South Vietnamese Navy. The Coast Guard's involvement in the Vietnam War ended at 1246 local time 29 April 1975 when LORAN Station [[Con Son Island#LORAN Station Con Son|Con Son]] went off the air for good.

The stylish new women's uniform was created by Hollywood costume designer [[Edith Head]], upon the request of Capt.

However, the [[Magnuson\u2013Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act of 1976]] brought an increase in offshore fisheries patrols, to which the newer WHECs (the 378s) were redeployed, as the aging boiler-powered World War II-vintage wooden-deckers were gradually retired.\n\n===The Kudirka incident===\n{{wikisource|President Ford\u2013Henry Kissinger\u2013Jerrold Schecter memcon (5 September 1974)#A1|President Ford memcon (5 September 1974)}}\nOn 23 November 1970, Simonas \"Simas\" Kudirka, a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] seaman of [[Lithuania]]n nationality, leapt from the 400-foot (120&nbsp;m) mother ship ''Sovetskaya Litva'', anchored in American waters (near [[Aquinnah]], [[Massachusetts]] on [[Martha's Vineyard]] Island), aboard the [[USCGC Vigilant (WMEC-617)|USCGC ''Vigilant'']], sailing from [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]].  The Soviets accused Kudirka of theft of 3,000 rubles from the ship's safe.  Ten hours passed; communications difficulties contributed to the delay, as the ship was unfortunately in a \"blind spot\" of Boston Radio's (Marshfield) receivers, resulting in an awkward resort to using the public marine operator.\n\nAfter attempts to get the [[U.S. State Department]] to provide guidance failed, Rear Admiral William B. Ellis, commander of the First Coast Guard District, ordered Commander Ralph E. Eustis to permit a [[KGB]] detachment to board the ''Vigilant'' to return Kudirka to the Soviet ship.  This led to a change in asylum policy by the U.S. Coast Guard. Admiral Ellis and his chief of staff were given administrative punishment under Article 15 of the [[UCMJ]].  Commander Eustis was given a non-punitive [[letter of reprimand]] and assigned to shore duty. Kudirka himself was tried for treason by the Soviet Union and given a ten-year sentence in prison. Subsequent investigations revealed that Kudirka could claim American citizenship through his mother and he was allowed to go to the United States in 1974.\n\nThe incident, known for several years as the Coast Guard's \"Day of Shame,\" was portrayed in a 1978 television movie, ''[[The Defection of Simas Kudirka]]'', with [[Alan Arkin]] playing Kudirka and [[Donald Pleasence]] playing the captain of the Soviet ship and USCGC ''Decisive'' playing the part of USCGC ''Vigilant''. It was also portrayed in the 1973 book ''Day of Shame: The truth about the murderous happenings aboard the Cutter Vigilant during the Russian-American confrontation off Martha's Vineyard'' by Algis Ruksenas.<ref>{{Cite web\n |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zCcdAAAAMAAJ\n |title=Day of shame: the truth about the ... \u2013 Google Books\n |work=books.google.com\n |accessdate=25 November 2010\n}}</ref>\n\n===The Rescue of AF586===\n\nAt 1430 on 26 October 1978, \"Alfa Foxtrot 586\", a Navy P-3C flying with a crew of fifteen on a reconnaissance mission from the VP-9 detachment at Naval Station Adak, Alaska, ditched near position {{coord|52|39|N|167|24|E}} (approximately 290 miles west of [[Shemya|Shemya Island]] in the Aleutians) following a propeller malfunction and succession of engine fires in its number one engine. VP 9's Aircraft Accident Report recorded conditions at the time of ditching as \"1500 foot ceiling, one and one-half to three miles visibility in rain showers, wave height 12-20 feet, winds 223 degrees at 43 knots.\" Water temperature was approximately 40 degrees.

Arriving on scene after dark in turbulent weather, CG 1500 marked the reported position of the survivors' rafts with a buoy and smoke floats, proceeded to and established communications with a Soviet fishing vessel, Mys Sinyavin, located approximately 25 miles west of datum, and then directed that vessel to both rafts, ultimately resulting in the rescue of ten survivors and the recovery of three dead crewmembers from AF 586. The latter died from exposure after approximately ten - twelve hours in the water-laden rafts, and it is unlikely that the other ten crewmembers could have survived in their rafts much longer as they were all in the advanced stages of hypothermia when rescued by Mys Sinyavin.<ref>https://www.uscg.mil/history/aviation/docs/SAR_1978_CG1500.pdf</ref>\n\n==The 1980s==\n\n===The ''Blackthorn'' Tragedy===\nOn 28 January 1980, the 180-foot buoy tender {{USCGC|Blackthorn|WLB-391}} collided with the 605-foot oil tanker SS ''Capricorn'' and capsized when the ''Capricorn'''s anchor entangled the cutter. Twenty-three Coast Guardsmen were drowned. Coming close behind the loss of 11 men in the collision/sinking of the OCS training ship [[USCGC Cuyahoga (WIX-157)|USCGC ''Cuyahoga'']], the impact of this disaster upon morale in the close-knit service was magnified.<ref>Coast Guard Reserve Magazine, March 2000. \"The 20th Anniversary of the CGC Blackthorn Tragedy\" http://www.uscg.mil/RESERVE/magazine/mag2000/mar2000/blackthorn.htm</ref>\n\n===''Prinsendam'' rescue===\nOn 4 October 1980, the Coast Guard and [[Canadian Coast Guard]] were involved in the rescue of the passengers and crew of the Dutch cruise vessel {{MS|Prinsendam|1973|6}} in the Gulf of Alaska.\n\nA fire broke out on the ''Prinsendam'' off Yakutat, Alaska on 4 October 1980.  The ''Prinsendam'' was {{convert|130|mi|km|sigfig=2}} from the nearest airstrip.  The cruise ship's captain ordered the ship abandoned and the passengers, many elderly, left the ship in the lifeboats.  Coast Guard and Canadian helicopters and the cutters ''[[USCGC Boutwell (WHEC-719)|Boutwell]]'', ''[[USCGC Mellon (WHEC-717)|Mellon]]'', and ''[[USCGC Woodrush (WLB-407)|Woodrush]]'' responded in concert with other vessels in the area. The passenger vessel later capsized and sank.  The rescue is particularly important because of the distance traveled by the rescuers, the coordination of independent organizations and the fact that all 520 passengers and crew were rescued without loss of life or serious injury.<ref name=CGN />\n\n===''Marine Electric'' sinking===\n\nOn February 12, 1983, the cargo ship  ''[[SS Marine Electric]]'' sank in a storm off the coast of [[Virginia]]. Despite efforts by multiple Coast Guard and Navy vessels, most of the crew were lost. As a result of this, the Coast Guard undertook massive review of its rescue procedures, its ship inspection procedures, and its requirements for safety equipment aboard ships. <ref name=\"marine electric\"> [https://www.maritime-executive.com/features/marine-electric-the-wreck-that-changed-the-coast-guard-forever Marine Electric: The Wreck that Changed the Coast Guard Forever], By Corinne Zilnicki 2019-02-11 maritime-executive.com website. </ref> \n\nSome of the reforms that resulted included the items below. <ref name=\"marine electric\"/> \n\n* greater attention to inspection of deck hatch covers during ship inspections. \n* requirement for all ships to provide equipment for survival in cold water for all ship's crew personnel. \n* the establishment of the [[Coast Guard rescue swimmer]] program in 1984, in order to greatly improve readiness and training for all rescue swimmers.\n\n===The Mariel boatlift===\n\nIn April 1980, the government of [[Cuba]] began to allow any person who wanted to leave Cuba to assemble in [[Mariel, Cuba|Mariel]] Harbor and take their own transport.  The U.S. Coast Guard, working out of Seventh District Headquarters in Miami, Florida, rescued boats in difficulty, inspected vessels for adequate safety equipment, and processed refugees.  This task was made even more difficult by a hurricane which swamped many vessels in mid-ocean and by the lack of cooperation by Cuban Border Guard officials.  By May, 600 reservists had been called up, the U.S. Navy provided assistance between Cuba and [[Key West, Florida|Key West]], and the Auxiliary was heavily involved.  125,000 refugees were processed between April and May 1980. (See [[Mariel boatlift]].)\n\n===The end of the lightships===\nThe number of lightships steadily decreased during the 20th century, some replaced by \"Texas Tower\" type structures (e.g., Chesapeake, Buzzards Bay, both now automated) [http://www.uscg.mil/history/h_lightships.html] [http://www.uscg.mil/history/Lightship_Index.html], and others by buoys. However, the Columbia River and Nantucket Shoals Lightships were not replaced by large navigational buoys (LNBs) until 1979 and 1983, respectively, due to the difficulty of anchoring buoys securely at their heavy-weather locations. [http://www.uscg.mil/history/h_lightships.html] [http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=554].\n\nThe technology of all aids to navigation evolved dramatically during this era, reducing manning and maintenance requirements. The Coast Guard also managed the worldwide VLF [[OMEGA Navigation System]] and operated two of its stations from the early 1970s until its termination in 1997 (having been superseded, though not truly obsoleted, by GPS).\n\n=== Drug War at sea escalates ===\nDuring the 1980s, Coast Guard cutters and aircraft were increasingly deployed to intervene drugs far offshore. While the service has interdicted contraband since its inception, the \"Drug War\" was the biggest effort since Prohibition. Though the Drug War began before the 1980s and continues to this day, it was during the 1980s that the Coast Guard, working with the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] and other law enforcement agencies, used a blend of new and old laws to interdict far from the shores of the United States. Formerly, it was more difficult to prosecute cases involving seizures made beyond 24 nautical miles from shore. President Ronald Reagan's efforts to secure funding for federal agencies and courts to prosecute cases got the Coast Guard's attention.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The Coast Guard instituted a \"no tolerance\" policy toward drugs, began testing its own employees for drug use, and required that all boardings be carried out by trained and armed boarding officers and petty officers. The Caribbean was the focus of efforts in the 1980s, but in recent years the major drug busts at sea have been occurring more in the waters of the Pacific Ocean between California and Peru.\n\n===Libyan attack on LORAN Station Lampedusa===\nOn 15 April 1986, [[Libya]] fired two [[Scud]]s at the U.S. Coast Guard [[LORAN|radio navigation]] station on the Italian island of [[Lampedusa]], in retaliation for the American bombing of [[Tripoli]] and [[Benghazi]]. However, the missiles passed over the island, landing in the sea, and caused no damage. As a result of the attack, the Coast Guard station was commissioned as a NATO base, including security hardening and an armory, as well as an Italian security detail stationed nearby.\n\n===Exxon Valdez oil spill===\nIn March 1989, the oil tanker ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'' struck [[Prince William Sound]]'s [[Bligh Reef]] and spilled 260,000 to 750,000 barrels (41,000 to 119,000 m3) of crude oil. Because the incident took place in navigational waters, the Coast Guard had authority for all activities relating to the cleanup effort. The Coast Guard largely served as the [[Federal On Scene Coordinator|Federal On-Scene Coordinator]] between [[ExxonMobil|Exxon Mobil]] and all of these organizations, acting within authority under the [[Clean Water Act]].\n\nCoast Guard cutters were one of the first to respond to the spill, quickly establishing a safety zone around the stricken ''Exxon Valdez''. At least eleven cutters were present in April 1989, the majority of them overseeing booming and skimming operations. Early that month, Coast Guard vessel activity went through a rapid buildup phase. The Coast Guard maintained a heavy cutter presence for two weeks in mid-April and then reduced it towards the end of the month. Four or five cutters were on hand in early May and that number was reduced to two or three by the end of the month. Three cutters were assigned to cleanup operations by the beginning of June, but only one remained two weeks later \u2013 and it stayed that way for the remainder of the 1989 response.\n\nSeveral [[C-130]]s from [[Coast Guard Air Station Kodiak]] airlifted more than 11 \u00bc tons of cleanup equipment by 10 April 1989. [[Dassault Falcon 20|HU-25 Falcon]] jets from [[Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod]] flew twice a day tracking oil with side-looking radar equipment. Five Coast Guard helicopters also assisted thirty-nine skimmers working in Prince William Sound.[http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/EV.pdf]\n\n==The 1990s==\n\n==='90 Operation Desert Shield===\n[[File:Harbor patrol during Operation Desert Shield.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|Members of Port Security Unit 302 patrol the harbor aboard a Navy harbor patrol boat during Operation Desert Shield.]]\nOn 17 August 1990, at the request of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Secretary of Transportation and the Commandant of the Coast Guard committed Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachments (LEDET) to [[Operation Desert Shield]].  A total of 10 four-person teams served in-theater to support the enforcement of UN sanctions by the Maritime Interdiction Forces.  Approximately 60 percent of the 600 boardings carried out by U.S. forces were either led by or supported with the LEDETs.  Additionally, a 7-man liaison staff was designated by the Commandant as Operational Commander for the Coast Guard forces deployed in theater.  The first boarding of an Iraqi vessel in the theater of operations conducted by a LEDET occurred on 30 August 1990. President George H. W. Bush, on 22 August 1990, authorized the call up of members of the selected reserve to active duty in support of Operation Desert Shield.  Three Port Security Units (PSU), consisting of 550 Coast Guard reservists are ordered to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Desert Shield. This was the first involuntary overseas mobilization of Coast Guard Reserve PSUs in the Coast Guard Reserve's 50-year history.  A total of 950 Coast Guard reservists were called to active duty.<ref name=\"uscg.mil\">http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/PersianGulfChron.asp</ref>\n\n==='91 Operation Desert Storm===\nPrior to the launch of Operation Desert Storm, Coast Guard LEDET personnel aboard the {{USS|Nicholas|FFG-47|}} assisted when the frigate cleared eleven Iraqi oil platforms and took 23 prisoners on 18 January 1991.  On 21 April 1991, a Tactical Port Security Boat (TPSB) of PSU 301, stationed in [[Al Jubayl]], Saudi Arabia, was the first boat in the newly reopened harbor of [[Mina Ash Shuwaikh]] in Kuwait City.  Because of certain security concerns, a determination was made to send one of the 22-foot Raider boats belonging to PSU 301 and armed with [[M2 machine gun|M2]] and [[M60 machine gun]]s, to lead the procession into the harbor and provide security for the operation.<ref name=\"uscg.mil\"/>\n\nDuring the war, Saddam Hussein's Iraqi army was seeking to pollute the Persian Gulf by pouring oil into in an effort only partly stymied when Air Force F-111F Aardvarks bombed the source of the deliberate spill. A giant slick was spreading rapidly, wreaking environmental havoc and threatening Saudi desalinization plants that supplied potable water for coalition troops. Two HU-25B Guardians from Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod, Mass., were dispatched 13 Feb 1991, supported by two HC-130H Hercules from CGAS Clearwater Florida, Operating from Saudi and Bahraini airfields. The HC-130s brought in supplies and returned to the United States 25 Feb.. The HU-25Bs flew over the oil spill to monitor dispersion, rate of flow, the effects of weather and currents, and other data essential for preparing a response plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/gulf-war-20th-coast-guard-aviators-battled-saddam-husseins-oil-spill/|title=Gulf War 20th: Coast Guard Aviators Battled Saddam Hussein's Oil Spill \u2013 Defense Media Network|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Operation Buckshot, \"The Great Flood of '93\"===\nDuring April and again in June 1993, Coast Guard Forces St. Louis (CGF)was activated for flooding on the Mississippi, Missouri and Illinois River basins. The '500 year' flooding closed over {{convert|1250|mi|km|sigfig=2}} of river to navigation and claimed 47 lives. Historic levels of rainfall in the river tributaries caused many levee breaks along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers displacing thousands of people from their homes and businesses. The commander of CGF St. Louis set into motion a preconceived operations plan to deal with the many requests for assistance from state and local governments for law enforcement assistance, help with sandbagging, water rescues, evacuation of flood victims, and aerial surveillance of levee conditions. The unprecedented duration of the flood also caused Coast Guard personnel to assume some humanitarian services not normally a part of flood operations. Food, water and sandbags were transported to work sites to assist sandbagging efforts by local governments. Red Cross and Salvation Army relief workers were given transportation assistance. Many homeless animals displaced by the flood waters were rescued and turned over to local animal shelters. Utility repair crews were assisted with transportation of personnel and repair parts. Disaster Response Units (DRU) were formed from active duty and reserve units throughout the Second Coast Guard District and consisted of eight members equipped with three 16-foot flood punts powered by 25 horsepower outboard motors. The DRU's accounted for 1517 boat sorties and 3342 hours of underway operations. Coast Guard helicopters from CG Air Stations in Traverse City and Detroit, Michigan; Chicago, Illinois; Elizabeth City, North Carolina; and Mobile, Alabama provided search and rescue, logistical support and aerial survey intelligence. The Coast Guard Auxiliary provided three fixed wing aircraft. There were 473 aircraft sorties with 570 hours of aircraft operations. CGF St. Louis stood down from the alert phase of operations on 27 August. A total of 380 Active Duty, 352 Reserve, 179 Auxiliary, and 5 Coast Guard civilians were involved in the operation.<ref>After Action Report for Operation Buckshot, Commander, Coast Guard Forces St. Louis, 2nd Coast Guard District, 15 August 1993</ref>\n\n===1994 Cuban boat rescues===\n[[File:USCGC Tamaroa WUEC-166 1990.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[USCGC Tamaroa|USCGC ''Tamaroa'']] (WMEC-166), best known for her rescues during the \"[[1991 Halloween Nor'easter|Perfect Storm]]\" of 1991.]]\nIn 1994, about 38,000 Cubans attempted to sail from Cuba to Florida, many on homemade rafts.  The Coast Guard and Navy performed intensive search and rescue efforts to rescue rafters at sea.

The Revenue Cutter Service and the [[United States Life-Saving Service]] were merged to become the Coast Guard per {{USC|14|1}} which states: \"The Coast Guard as established January 28, 1915, shall be a military service and a branch of the armed forces of the United States at all times.\"  In 1939, the [[United States Lighthouse Service]] was merged into the Coast Guard.  The Coast Guard itself was moved to the [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] in 1967, and on 25 February 2003 it became part of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]. However, under {{USC|14|3}} as amended by section 211 of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006, upon the declaration of war and when [[United States Congress|Congress]] so directs in the declaration, or when the [[President of the United States|President]] directs, the Coast Guard operates as a service in the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]].\n\n==Early history==\n===The Revenue-Marine===\nThe modern Coast Guard was created in 1915 by the merger of the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]] and the [[United States Lifesaving Service]], but its roots go back to the early days of the Republic. [[Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Alexander Hamilton]] lobbied Congress to authorize a [[First ten Revenue Service cutters|\"system of cutters\"]] to enforce tariffs, which was major source of revenue for the new nation. On 4 August 1790 (now recognized as the Coast Guard's official birthday), Congress passed the Tariff Act, permitting the construction of ten cutters and the recruitment of 40 revenue officers. Each cutter was assigned one master and three mates who were commissioned officers. In addition each cutter was allowed four mariners and two boys. <ref name=Evans5>Evans, p.5</ref> The cutters were collectively referred to as the \"Revenue-Marine,\" and later officially organized as the \"Revenue Cutter Service.\" Initially, the  was not an organized service. Each revenue cutter operated independently, with each assigned to patrol a section of the east coast and reporting directly to the [[Customs House]] in a major port. From 1790, when the [[Continental Navy]] was disbanded, to 1798, when the [[United States Navy]] was created, these \"revenue cutters\" were the country's only naval force.<ref name=Evans14>Evans, p. 14</ref> As such, the cutters and their crews took on a wide variety of duties beyond the enforcement of tariffs, including combating piracy, rescuing mariners in distress, ferrying government officials, and even carrying mail. In 1794, the Revenue-Marine was given the mission of preventing trading in slaves from Africa to the United States. Between 1794 and 1865, the Service captured approximately 500 slave ships. In 1808, the Service was responsible for enforcing President [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s embargo closing U.S. ports to European trade. The 1822 Timber Act tasked the Revenue Cutter Service with protecting government timber from poachers (this is viewed as the beginning of the Coast Guard's environmental protection mission).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-cp/comrel/factfile/Factcards/Resources.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=31 July 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720081519/http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-cp/comrel/factfile/Factcards/Resources.html |archive-date=20 July 2006 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> During times of war or crisis, the revenue cutters and their crews were put at the disposal of the Navy.

These stations were normally unoccupied \u2013 essentially storehouses for boats and equipment to be used by volunteers. With the signing of the Newell Act on August 14, 1848, Congress appropriated $10,000 to fund lifesaving stations along the east coast. These were loosely administered by the Revenue-Marine, but still dependent on volunteers (like many fire departments of the time).\n\nThis system continued until 1871 when [[Sumner Kimball]] was appointed Chief of the Revenue Marine Division of the Treasury Department. Kimball convinced Congress to appropriate $200,000 to construct new stations, repair old ones, and provide full-time crews. Shortly thereafter, in 1878, the U.S. Lifesaving Service was officially born and so-named.\n\nAlthough the Revenue Cutter Service is perhaps more recognized as ''the'' predecessor of the Coast Guard, the Lifesaving Service's legacy is apparent in many ways, not the least of which is the prominence of the Coast Guard's search and rescue mission in the eyes of the public. The Coast Guard takes its unofficial search and rescue motto, \"You have to go out, but you don't have to come back,\" from the 1899 regulations of the [[United States Life Saving Service]], which stated:\n\n<blockquote>In attempting a rescue the keeper will select either the boat, breeches buoy, or life car, as in his judgment is best suited to effectively cope with the existing conditions. If the device first selected fails after such trial as satisfies him that no further attempt with it is feasible, he will resort to one of the others, and if that fails, then to the remaining one, and he will not desist from his efforts until by actual trial the impossibility of effecting a rescue is demonstrated. The statement of the keeper that he did not try to use the boat because the sea or surf was too heavy will not be accepted unless attempts to launch it were actually made and failed [underlining added], or unless the conformation of the coast\u2014as bluffs, precipitous banks, etc.\u2014is such as to unquestionably preclude the use of a boat.</blockquote>\n\nThese regulations were repeated in the 1934 Coast Guard regulations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nA number of Coast Guard traditions survive from, or pay homage to, the Lifesaving Service as well. For example, members of the Lifesaving Service were referred to as \"surfmen,\" and today the [[Surfman Badge]] it awarded to [[coxswains]] who qualify to operate motor lifeboats in heavy surf conditions. The badge's design is similar to the Lifesaving Service's seal.\n\n===Coast Guard Academy===\nThe School of Instruction of the Revenue Cutter Service was established in 1876, near New Bedford, Massachusetts. It used the [[USRC James C. Dobbin (1853)|USRC ''Dobbin'']] for its training exercises.  It moved to Curtis Bay, Maryland in 1900 and then again in 1910 to Fort Trumbull, near New London, Connecticut. The school provided a two-year premise to ship supplemented by some class work and tutoring in technical subjects.  In 1903, the third year of instruction was added.  The school was oriented to line officers, as engineers were hired directly from civilian life.  In 1906, an engineering program for cadets began. Nevertheless, the school remained small, with 5 to 10 cadets per class. In 1914 the School became the Revenue Cutter Academy and with the merger of the Revenue Cutter Service and the Life Saving Service in 1915, it became the [[United States Coast Guard Academy]]. In February 1929, Congress appropriated $1,750,000 for construction of buildings to be used for the academy. The city of New London purchased the land on the Thames River and donated it to the government for use as a Coast Guard facility. Construction began in 1931 and the first cadets began occupying the new facilities in 1932.<ref name=Johnson109>Johnson, p 109</ref>\n\n===Creation of the modern Coast Guard===\nOn 28 January 1915, the United States Revenue Cutter Service and the United States Lifesaving Service were merged by act of Congress to form the United States Coast Guard.<ref name=Johnson32>Johnson, p. 32</ref>  The [[United States Lighthouse Service]] was absorbed by the Coast Guard in 1939.

All cutters were to report to the nearest Naval District commander and stand by for further orders.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)7>Larzelere (2003), p. 7</ref> All normal operations were suspended with the exception of rescues pending orders from the Navy. [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Josephus Daniels]] directed that although the Coast Guard was then a part of the Navy, that most of the administrative details handled by Coast Guard Headquarters would not be changed.  At the outset of the war the Coast Guard consisted of less than 4000 officers and men, had 23 cruising cutters, 21 harbor cutters, 272 rescue stations and 21 cadets at the Coast Guard Academy.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)11-16>Larzelere (2003), pp. 11\u201416</ref><ref name=Larzelere(2003)21>Larzelere (2003), p.21</ref> The Coast Guard was still in a formative stage of development from the merger of the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service and the U.S. Lifesaving Service.  Because of this fact, there was not much interaction between the two former entities during the war.  A qualified Lifesaving Service surfman who wished to transfer to a cutter had to be reduced to ordinary seaman upon reporting because of a lack of shipboard skills. Because of this transfers were infrequent.  There were no chief petty officers in the Coast Guard at this time and Coast Guard petty officers assigned to Navy ships often served under less experienced supervisors for less pay.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)19>Larzelere (2003), p. 19</ref>\n\n\nCoast Guard cutters were seen by the Navy as ready assets and were used to fill in for a rapidly expanding Navy.  The Navy recognized Coast Guard officers and petty officers as the experienced mariners that they were and often put them on Navy ships to fill in for crew shortages and lack of experience.\n\n=== Sinking of USCGC Tampa ===\nDuring the late afternoon of 26 September 1918, ''Tampa'' parted company with convoy HG-107, which she had just escorted into the [[Irish Sea]] from Gibraltar.

According to the submarine war diary entry, the U-boat dived and maneuvered into an attack position, firing one torpedo out of the stern tube at 2015 from a range of about 550 meters. Minutes later, the torpedo hit ''Tampa'' and exploded portside amidships, throwing up a huge, luminous column of water.<ref name=Johnson55>Johnson, p 55</ref> The cutter sank with all hands: 111 Coast Guardsmen, 4 U.S. Navy sailors, and 16 passengers consisting of 11 [[Royal Navy]] sailors and 5 [[United States Maritime Service|Maritime Service Merchant Marines]].<ref name=Larzelere(2003)49>Larzelere (2003), p. 49</ref> The sinking of ''Tampa'' was the largest single loss of Coast Guard personnel in the war.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)50>Larzelere (2003), p. 50</ref> She sank in the [[Bristol Channel]] at roughly {{coord|50|40|N|6|19|W}}.<ref name=DANFS>''Tampa'', Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, U.S. Navy Naval History & Heritage Command</ref>\n\n\nDuring the war, in 1918, twin sisters Genevieve and Lucille Baker of the Naval Coastal Defense Reserve became the first uniformed women to serve in the Coast Guard.<ref name=\"cbc.ca\">{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/military-international/ | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130328085505/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/military-international |archivedate=28 March 2013 |title=Women in the military \u2013 international |date=30 May 2006 |work=CBC News | url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=WHC>\"Women's History Chronology\", Women & the U.

The effort was not entirely successful, due to the slowness of the destroyers.  However, the mission provided many Coast Guard officers and [[petty officer]]s with operational experience which proved invaluable in [[World War II]]. The Navy's epithet of \"Hooligan Navy\" dates from this era, due to the Coast Guard's flexibility in enlisting men discharged from other services to rapidly expand; it has endured due to the high proportion of prior-other-service enlisteds, and become a term of pride within the service.\n\n===1927 Mississippi River flood===\n\nDuring the disastrous [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927|1927 Mississippi River flood]], the Coast Guard rescued a total of 43,853 persons who they \"removed from perilous positions to places of safety\".  Additionally, they saved 11,313 head of livestock and furnished transportation for 72 persons in need of hospitalization.  In all 674 Coast Guardsmen and 128 Coast Guard vessels and boats served in the relief operations.<ref name=Johnson99>Johnson, p 99</ref>\n\n==The 1930s==\n\n===Increasing regulation of merchant shipping===\nThe Steamboat Inspection Service was merged with the Bureau of Navigation, created in 1884, to oversee the regulation of merchant seamen, on 30 June 1932.\n\nIn 1934, the passenger vessel [[SS Morro Castle (1930)|SS ''Morro Castle'']] suffered a serious fire off the coast of New Jersey, which ultimately claimed the lives of 124 passenger and crew.  The casualty prompted new [[fire protection]] standards for vessels and paved the way for the \"Act of May 27, 1936\", which reorganized and changed the name of the Bureau of Navigation and Steamboat Inspection Service to the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation.\n\nMarine inspection and navigation duties under the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation were temporarily transferred to the Coast Guard by executive order on 28 February 1942. This transfer of duties fit well with the Coast Guard's port safety and security missions, and was made permanent in 1946.\n<ref>[https://www.piersystem.com/go/doc/786/166737/ \"Statement of Admiral Thad w.

The [[Greenland Patrol]] was maintained by the Coast Guard for the duration of the war.\n\n[[File:These Negro members of a Coast Guard Horse Patrol unit patrol beaches in the New Jersey area in all kinds of weather. - NARA - 535853.jpg|thumb|US Coast Guard Horse Patrol, circa 1941-45]]\n\n[[File:Attack on Pearl Harbor Japanese planes view.jpg|thumb|Attack on Pearl Harbor Japanese planes view]]\nThe Coast Guard became directly involved in the first WW2 attack on America in the 1941 [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Supporting U.S. naval forces on December 7, were the Coast Guard cutters, patrol boats, bases, stations, lighthouses and personnel assigned to the 14th Naval District. These units included high-endurance cutter Taney and patrol cutters Tiger and Reliance; buoy tenders Kukui and Walnut; patrol boats CG-400, CG-403, CG-27, and CG-8; a buoy boat and the former Lighthouse Service launch Lehua all participated in the battle shooting at several aircraft. Coast Guard aviator, Lt. Frank Erickson, who later pioneered search and rescue helicopter flight, was standing watch at Ford Island before the attack then took command of an anti-aircraft battery to fight off multiple enemy aircraft.\n\nThe {{USCGC|Taney|WHEC-37|}}, a notable [[World War II]] era high endurance cutter, is the only warship still afloat today (as a [[museum ship]] in [[Baltimore]]) that was present for the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, although she was actually stationed in nearby Honolulu.\n\n\nDuring World War II, there was great concern about enemy vessels nearing U.S. shores, allowing adversarial forces to invade the nation. The beach patrols gained increased importance as security forces with three basic functions: to look for and report on any suspicious vessels operating in the area; to report and prevent attempts of landings by the enemy; and to prevent communication between persons on shore and the enemy at sea.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Young |first1=Stephanie |title=Mounted beach patrol: When the service saddled up |url=https://coastguard.dodlive.mil/2012/08/mounted-beach-patrol-when-the-service-saddled-up |website=Coast Guard Compass |publisher=US Coast Guard |accessdate=13 September 2019 |date=August 28, 2012}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nThe {{USCGC|Modoc|WPG-46|}}, was peripherally involved in the chase and sinking of the German [[battleship]] [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']].\n\nShortly after Germany declared war on the United States, German [[submarine]]s began [[Second happy time|Operation Drumbeat]] ''(\"Paukenschlag\"),'' <!-- was (\"Kesselpauke\"),--> sinking ships off the American coast.

A Navy [[destroyer escort]], {{USS|Douglas A. Munro|DE-422|}}, was named in his honor in 1944. The cutter {{USCGC|Douglas Munro|WHEC-724|}} was commissioned in 1971, and is still on active service.  The cutter {{USCGC|Munro|WMSL-755}} was commissioned in 2017 and is on active service.\n\n===Bermuda Sky Queen rescue===\n\nOn 14 October 1947, the American-owned [[Boeing 314|Boeing 314 flying boat]] ''[[Bermuda Sky Queen]]'', carrying sixty-nine passengers was flying from [[Foynes]], Ireland to [[Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador|Gander]], [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]].  Gale-force winds had slowed her progress and she was running low on fuel.  Too far from Newfoundland and unable to make it back to Ireland, the captain, Charles Martin, twenty-six-year-old ex-Navy pilot, decided to fly toward  {{USCGC|Bibb|WPG-31|}} which was on [[Ocean Station Charlie]] in the North Atlantic.  The plane's captain decided to ditch and have his passengers and crew picked up by ''Bibb''.  In 30-foot (10 m) seas, the transfer was both difficult and dangerous.  Initially the ''Bibb's'' captain, Capt. Paul B. Cronk, tried to pass a line to the plane which taxied to the lee side of the cutter.  A collision with the cutter ended this attempt to save the passengers.  With worsening weather, a fifteen-man rubber raft and a small boat were deployed from the ship.  The raft was guided to the escape door of the aircraft.  Passengers jumped into the raft which was then pulled to the boat.  After rescuing 47 of the passengers, worsening conditions and the approach of darkness forced the rescue's suspension.  By dawn, improved weather allowed the rescue to resume and the remaining passengers and crew were transferred to the ''Bibb''.  The rescue made headlines throughout the country and upon their arrival in Boston, ''Bibb'' and her crew received a hero's welcome for having saved all those aboard the ditched ''Bermuda Sky Queen''.<ref name=CGN /><ref>{{British pathe|13803| Newsreel footage of 1947 Bermuda Sky Queen incident}}.

(See [[Coast Guard Island]]).\n\n==The 1950s==\n\n===Korean War===\nDuring the [[Korean War]], Coast Guard officers helped arrange the evacuation of the [[Korea]]n Peninsula during the initial [[North Korea]]n attack.  On 9 August 1950, Congress enacted Public Law 679, known as the [[Magnuson Act]].  This act charged the Coast Guard with ensuring the security of the United States' ports and harbors on a permanent basis.  In addition, the Coast Guard established a series of weather ships in the north Pacific Ocean and assisted civilian and military aircraft and ships in distress, and established a string of [[LORAN]] stations in Japan and Korea that assisted the United Nations forces.\n\n===''Pendleton'' rescue===\n{{main|SS Pendleton}}\n[[File:Pendleton Sinking Ship.jpg|thumb|Bow section of the ''Pendleton'', 19 February 1952]]\nOn 18 February 1952, during a severe \"[[nor'easter]]\" off the New England coast, the [[T2 tanker]]s [[SS Fort Mercer|SS ''Fort Mercer'']] and [[SS Pendleton|SS ''Pendleton'']] broke in half.

Squadron One assisted in [[Operation Market Time]] by interdicting resupply by sea of [[Viet Cong]] and North Vietnamese forces. The Coast Guard developed a \"piggyback\" weapon that proved highly useful; an [[M2 Browning machine gun]] placed over a [[M29 mortar|81mm mortar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcf45.com/misfire/81-50.html|title=Coast Guard Piggyback Weapon|publisher=}}</ref> Seventeen [[Point class cutter|''Point class'']] 82-foot WPB cutters were transferred to coastal waters off Vietnam with their Coast Guard crews under the operational control of the [[U.S. Navy]] [[U.S. Seventh Fleet|Seventh Fleet]].

The first five cutters arrived on 4 May<ref name=Larzelerexxi>Larzelere, p xxi</ref> \n\nSeveral Coast Guard aviators served with the [[U.S. Air Force]] [[37th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron]] and [[40th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron]] in Southeast Asia from 1968 to 1972. They were involved in combat search and rescue operations in both Vietnam and Laos.<ref>http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/KaliszThomasCGAviationVTN.pdf</ref>\n\nThe Coast Guard provided Explosive Loading Detachments (ELD) to the [[U.S. Army]] [[1st Logistics Command]] in several locations in Vietnam.  The ELD's were responsible for the supervision of Army stevedores in the unloading of explosives and ammunition from U.S. Merchant Marine ships. The ELD's were also responsible for assisting the Army in port security operations at each port and eventually were made a part of a Port Security and Waterways Detail (PS&WD) reporting to the Commanding General, United States Army, Vietnam ([[USARV]]). They earned the Army [[Meritorious Unit Commendation]] for their efforts.\n\nOn 13 December 1965 [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] requested Coast Guard assistance in constructing a chain of [[LORAN-C]] stations for use by naval vessels and combat aircraft for operations in Southeast Asia.<ref name=Larzelere(1997)193>Larzelere (1997), p. 193</ref> Construction started almost immediately at five locations in Thailand and Vietnam and they were fully operational on 28 October 1966.<ref name=Larzelere(1997)203>Larzelere (1997), p. 203</ref>\n\nOn 22 April 1966, {{USCGC|Planetree|WLB-307|}} arrived in [[Cam Ranh Bay]] to commence [[Aids to Navigation]] (ATON) operations in the coastal waters of South Vietnam. She was responsible for the marking of freshly cut channels and harbors with buoys and daymarks so that merchant and naval ships could safely navigate the waters. This direct support mission ended on 17 May 1971 with the departure of the last buoy tender, {{USCGC|Blackhaw|WLB-390|}}. The buoy tender crews were tasked with training South Vietnamese crews in the ATON effort prior to the departure of the ''Blackhaw'' as a part of the '[[Vietnamization]]' policy of the Nixon Administration.  After May 1971 ATON was serviced on a 'as needed' basis by {{USCGC|Basswood|WLB-388|}} homeported in Guam.\n\nIn August 1970 the Coast Guard finished turning over to the South Vietnamese Navy the patrol boats of Squadron One. The training of South Vietnamese crews had started in February 1969 and continued through to the end of operations for Squadron One. {{USCGC|Yakutat|WHEC-380|}} and {{USCGC|Bering Strait|WHEC-382|}} were turned over to the South Vietnamese Navy on 1 January 1971. Eventually three other WHECs were turned over to the South Vietnamese Navy. The Coast Guard's involvement in the Vietnam War ended at 1246 local time 29 April 1975 when LORAN Station [[Con Son Island#LORAN Station Con Son|Con Son]] went off the air for good.

However, the [[Magnuson\u2013Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act of 1976]] brought an increase in offshore fisheries patrols, to which the newer WHECs (the 378s) were redeployed, as the aging boiler-powered World War II-vintage wooden-deckers were gradually retired.\n\n===The Kudirka incident===\n{{wikisource|President Ford\u2013Henry Kissinger\u2013Jerrold Schecter memcon (5 September 1974)#A1|President Ford memcon (5 September 1974)}}\nOn 23 November 1970, Simonas \"Simas\" Kudirka, a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] seaman of [[Lithuania]]n nationality, leapt from the 400-foot (120&nbsp;m) mother ship ''Sovetskaya Litva'', anchored in American waters (near [[Aquinnah]], [[Massachusetts]] on [[Martha's Vineyard]] Island), aboard the [[USCGC Vigilant (WMEC-617)|USCGC ''Vigilant'']], sailing from [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]].  The Soviets accused Kudirka of theft of 3,000 rubles from the ship's safe.  Ten hours passed; communications difficulties contributed to the delay, as the ship was unfortunately in a \"blind spot\" of Boston Radio's (Marshfield) receivers, resulting in an awkward resort to using the public marine operator.\n\nAfter attempts to get the [[U.S. State Department]] to provide guidance failed, Rear Admiral William B. Ellis, commander of the First Coast Guard District, ordered Commander Ralph E. Eustis to permit a [[KGB]] detachment to board the ''Vigilant'' to return Kudirka to the Soviet ship.  This led to a change in asylum policy by the U.S. Coast Guard. Admiral Ellis and his chief of staff were given administrative punishment under Article 15 of the [[UCMJ]].  Commander Eustis was given a non-punitive [[letter of reprimand]] and assigned to shore duty. Kudirka himself was tried for treason by the Soviet Union and given a ten-year sentence in prison. Subsequent investigations revealed that Kudirka could claim American citizenship through his mother and he was allowed to go to the United States in 1974.\n\nThe incident, known for several years as the Coast Guard's \"Day of Shame,\" was portrayed in a 1978 television movie, ''[[The Defection of Simas Kudirka]]'', with [[Alan Arkin]] playing Kudirka and [[Donald Pleasence]] playing the captain of the Soviet ship and USCGC ''Decisive'' playing the part of USCGC ''Vigilant''. It was also portrayed in the 1973 book ''Day of Shame: The truth about the murderous happenings aboard the Cutter Vigilant during the Russian-American confrontation off Martha's Vineyard'' by Algis Ruksenas.<ref>{{Cite web\n |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zCcdAAAAMAAJ\n |title=Day of shame: the truth about the ... \u2013 Google Books\n |work=books.google.com\n |accessdate=25 November 2010\n}}</ref>\n\n===The Rescue of AF586===\n\nAt 1430 on 26 October 1978, \"Alfa Foxtrot 586\", a Navy P-3C flying with a crew of fifteen on a reconnaissance mission from the VP-9 detachment at Naval Station Adak, Alaska, ditched near position {{coord|52|39|N|167|24|E}} (approximately 290 miles west of [[Shemya|Shemya Island]] in the Aleutians) following a propeller malfunction and succession of engine fires in its number one engine.

Arriving on scene after dark in turbulent weather, CG 1500 marked the reported position of the survivors' rafts with a buoy and smoke floats, proceeded to and established communications with a Soviet fishing vessel, Mys Sinyavin, located approximately 25 miles west of datum, and then directed that vessel to both rafts, ultimately resulting in the rescue of ten survivors and the recovery of three dead crewmembers from AF 586. The latter died from exposure after approximately ten - twelve hours in the water-laden rafts, and it is unlikely that the other ten crewmembers could have survived in their rafts much longer as they were all in the advanced stages of hypothermia when rescued by Mys Sinyavin.<ref>https://www.uscg.mil/history/aviation/docs/SAR_1978_CG1500.pdf</ref>\n\n==The 1980s==\n\n===The ''Blackthorn'' Tragedy===\nOn 28 January 1980, the 180-foot buoy tender {{USCGC|Blackthorn|WLB-391}} collided with the 605-foot oil tanker SS ''Capricorn'' and capsized when the ''Capricorn'''s anchor entangled the cutter. Twenty-three Coast Guardsmen were drowned. Coming close behind the loss of 11 men in the collision/sinking of the OCS training ship [[USCGC Cuyahoga (WIX-157)|USCGC ''Cuyahoga'']], the impact of this disaster upon morale in the close-knit service was magnified.<ref>Coast Guard Reserve Magazine, March 2000. \"The 20th Anniversary of the CGC Blackthorn Tragedy\" http://www.uscg.mil/RESERVE/magazine/mag2000/mar2000/blackthorn.htm</ref>\n\n===''Prinsendam'' rescue===\nOn 4 October 1980, the Coast Guard and [[Canadian Coast Guard]] were involved in the rescue of the passengers and crew of the Dutch cruise vessel {{MS|Prinsendam|1973|6}} in the Gulf of Alaska.\n\nA fire broke out on the ''Prinsendam'' off Yakutat, Alaska on 4 October 1980.  The ''Prinsendam'' was {{convert|130|mi|km|sigfig=2}} from the nearest airstrip.  The cruise ship's captain ordered the ship abandoned and the passengers, many elderly, left the ship in the lifeboats.  Coast Guard and Canadian helicopters and the cutters ''[[USCGC Boutwell (WHEC-719)|Boutwell]]'', ''[[USCGC Mellon (WHEC-717)|Mellon]]'', and ''[[USCGC Woodrush (WLB-407)|Woodrush]]'' responded in concert with other vessels in the area. The passenger vessel later capsized and sank.  The rescue is particularly important because of the distance traveled by the rescuers, the coordination of independent organizations and the fact that all 520 passengers and crew were rescued without loss of life or serious injury.<ref name=CGN />\n\n===''Marine Electric'' sinking===\n\nOn February 12, 1983, the cargo ship  ''[[SS Marine Electric]]'' sank in a storm off the coast of [[Virginia]]. Despite efforts by multiple Coast Guard and Navy vessels, most of the crew were lost. As a result of this, the Coast Guard undertook massive review of its rescue procedures, its ship inspection procedures, and its requirements for safety equipment aboard ships. <ref name=\"marine electric\"> [https://www.maritime-executive.com/features/marine-electric-the-wreck-that-changed-the-coast-guard-forever Marine Electric: The Wreck that Changed the Coast Guard Forever], By Corinne Zilnicki 2019-02-11 maritime-executive.com website. </ref> \n\nSome of the reforms that resulted included the items below. <ref name=\"marine electric\"/> \n\n* greater attention to inspection of deck hatch covers during ship inspections. \n* requirement for all ships to provide equipment for survival in cold water for all ship's crew personnel. \n* the establishment of the [[Coast Guard rescue swimmer]] program in 1984, in order to greatly improve readiness and training for all rescue swimmers.\n\n===The Mariel boatlift===\n\nIn April 1980, the government of [[Cuba]] began to allow any person who wanted to leave Cuba to assemble in [[Mariel, Cuba|Mariel]] Harbor and take their own transport.  The U.S. Coast Guard, working out of Seventh District Headquarters in Miami, Florida, rescued boats in difficulty, inspected vessels for adequate safety equipment, and processed refugees.  This task was made even more difficult by a hurricane which swamped many vessels in mid-ocean and by the lack of cooperation by Cuban Border Guard officials.  By May, 600 reservists had been called up, the U.S. Navy provided assistance between Cuba and [[Key West, Florida|Key West]], and the Auxiliary was heavily involved.  125,000 refugees were processed between April and May 1980. (See [[Mariel boatlift]].)\n\n===The end of the lightships===\nThe number of lightships steadily decreased during the 20th century, some replaced by \"Texas Tower\" type structures (e.g., Chesapeake, Buzzards Bay, both now automated) [http://www.uscg.mil/history/h_lightships.html] [http://www.uscg.mil/history/Lightship_Index.html], and others by buoys. However, the Columbia River and Nantucket Shoals Lightships were not replaced by large navigational buoys (LNBs) until 1979 and 1983, respectively, due to the difficulty of anchoring buoys securely at their heavy-weather locations. [http://www.uscg.mil/history/h_lightships.html] [http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=554].\n\nThe technology of all aids to navigation evolved dramatically during this era, reducing manning and maintenance requirements. The Coast Guard also managed the worldwide VLF [[OMEGA Navigation System]] and operated two of its stations from the early 1970s until its termination in 1997 (having been superseded, though not truly obsoleted, by GPS).\n\n=== Drug War at sea escalates ===\nDuring the 1980s, Coast Guard cutters and aircraft were increasingly deployed to intervene drugs far offshore. While the service has interdicted contraband since its inception, the \"Drug War\" was the biggest effort since Prohibition. Though the Drug War began before the 1980s and continues to this day, it was during the 1980s that the Coast Guard, working with the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] and other law enforcement agencies, used a blend of new and old laws to interdict far from the shores of the United States. Formerly, it was more difficult to prosecute cases involving seizures made beyond 24 nautical miles from shore. President Ronald Reagan's efforts to secure funding for federal agencies and courts to prosecute cases got the Coast Guard's attention.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The Coast Guard instituted a \"no tolerance\" policy toward drugs, began testing its own employees for drug use, and required that all boardings be carried out by trained and armed boarding officers and petty officers. The Caribbean was the focus of efforts in the 1980s, but in recent years the major drug busts at sea have been occurring more in the waters of the Pacific Ocean between California and Peru.\n\n===Libyan attack on LORAN Station Lampedusa===\nOn 15 April 1986, [[Libya]] fired two [[Scud]]s at the U.S. Coast Guard [[LORAN|radio navigation]] station on the Italian island of [[Lampedusa]], in retaliation for the American bombing of [[Tripoli]] and [[Benghazi]]. However, the missiles passed over the island, landing in the sea, and caused no damage. As a result of the attack, the Coast Guard station was commissioned as a NATO base, including security hardening and an armory, as well as an Italian security detail stationed nearby.\n\n===Exxon Valdez oil spill===\nIn March 1989, the oil tanker ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'' struck [[Prince William Sound]]'s [[Bligh Reef]] and spilled 260,000 to 750,000 barrels (41,000 to 119,000 m3) of crude oil. Because the incident took place in navigational waters, the Coast Guard had authority for all activities relating to the cleanup effort. The Coast Guard largely served as the [[Federal On Scene Coordinator|Federal On-Scene Coordinator]] between [[ExxonMobil|Exxon Mobil]] and all of these organizations, acting within authority under the [[Clean Water Act]].\n\nCoast Guard cutters were one of the first to respond to the spill, quickly establishing a safety zone around the stricken ''Exxon Valdez''. At least eleven cutters were present in April 1989, the majority of them overseeing booming and skimming operations. Early that month, Coast Guard vessel activity went through a rapid buildup phase. The Coast Guard maintained a heavy cutter presence for two weeks in mid-April and then reduced it towards the end of the month. Four or five cutters were on hand in early May and that number was reduced to two or three by the end of the month. Three cutters were assigned to cleanup operations by the beginning of June, but only one remained two weeks later \u2013 and it stayed that way for the remainder of the 1989 response.\n\nSeveral [[C-130]]s from [[Coast Guard Air Station Kodiak]] airlifted more than 11 \u00bc tons of cleanup equipment by 10 April 1989. [[Dassault Falcon 20|HU-25 Falcon]] jets from [[Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod]] flew twice a day tracking oil with side-looking radar equipment. Five Coast Guard helicopters also assisted thirty-nine skimmers working in Prince William Sound.[http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/EV.pdf]\n\n==The 1990s==\n\n==='90 Operation Desert Shield===\n[[File:Harbor patrol during Operation Desert Shield.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|Members of Port Security Unit 302 patrol the harbor aboard a Navy harbor patrol boat during Operation Desert Shield.]]\nOn 17 August 1990, at the request of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Secretary of Transportation and the Commandant of the Coast Guard committed Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachments (LEDET) to [[Operation Desert Shield]].  A total of 10 four-person teams served in-theater to support the enforcement of UN sanctions by the Maritime Interdiction Forces.  Approximately 60 percent of the 600 boardings carried out by U.S. forces were either led by or supported with the LEDETs.  Additionally, a 7-man liaison staff was designated by the Commandant as Operational Commander for the Coast Guard forces deployed in theater.  The first boarding of an Iraqi vessel in the theater of operations conducted by a LEDET occurred on 30 August 1990. President George H. W. Bush, on 22 August 1990, authorized the call up of members of the selected reserve to active duty in support of Operation Desert Shield.  Three Port Security Units (PSU), consisting of 550 Coast Guard reservists are ordered to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Desert Shield. This was the first involuntary overseas mobilization of Coast Guard Reserve PSUs in the Coast Guard Reserve's 50-year history.  A total of 950 Coast Guard reservists were called to active duty.<ref name=\"uscg.mil\">http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/PersianGulfChron.asp</ref>\n\n==='91 Operation Desert Storm===\nPrior to the launch of Operation Desert Storm, Coast Guard LEDET personnel aboard the {{USS|Nicholas|FFG-47|}} assisted when the frigate cleared eleven Iraqi oil platforms and took 23 prisoners on 18 January 1991.  On 21 April 1991, a Tactical Port Security Boat (TPSB) of PSU 301, stationed in [[Al Jubayl]], Saudi Arabia, was the first boat in the newly reopened harbor of [[Mina Ash Shuwaikh]] in Kuwait City.  Because of certain security concerns, a determination was made to send one of the 22-foot Raider boats belonging to PSU 301 and armed with [[M2 machine gun|M2]] and [[M60 machine gun]]s, to lead the procession into the harbor and provide security for the operation.<ref name=\"uscg.mil\"/>\n\nDuring the war, Saddam Hussein's Iraqi army was seeking to pollute the Persian Gulf by pouring oil into in an effort only partly stymied when Air Force F-111F Aardvarks bombed the source of the deliberate spill. A giant slick was spreading rapidly, wreaking environmental havoc and threatening Saudi desalinization plants that supplied potable water for coalition troops. Two HU-25B Guardians from Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod, Mass., were dispatched 13 Feb 1991, supported by two HC-130H Hercules from CGAS Clearwater Florida, Operating from Saudi and Bahraini airfields. The HC-130s brought in supplies and returned to the United States 25 Feb.. The HU-25Bs flew over the oil spill to monitor dispersion, rate of flow, the effects of weather and currents, and other data essential for preparing a response plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/gulf-war-20th-coast-guard-aviators-battled-saddam-husseins-oil-spill/|title=Gulf War 20th: Coast Guard Aviators Battled Saddam Hussein's Oil Spill \u2013 Defense Media Network|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Operation Buckshot, \"The Great Flood of '93\"===\nDuring April and again in June 1993, Coast Guard Forces St. Louis (CGF)was activated for flooding on the Mississippi, Missouri and Illinois River basins. The '500 year' flooding closed over {{convert|1250|mi|km|sigfig=2}} of river to navigation and claimed 47 lives. Historic levels of rainfall in the river tributaries caused many levee breaks along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers displacing thousands of people from their homes and businesses. The commander of CGF St. Louis set into motion a preconceived operations plan to deal with the many requests for assistance from state and local governments for law enforcement assistance, help with sandbagging, water rescues, evacuation of flood victims, and aerial surveillance of levee conditions. The unprecedented duration of the flood also caused Coast Guard personnel to assume some humanitarian services not normally a part of flood operations. Food, water and sandbags were transported to work sites to assist sandbagging efforts by local governments. Red Cross and Salvation Army relief workers were given transportation assistance. Many homeless animals displaced by the flood waters were rescued and turned over to local animal shelters. Utility repair crews were assisted with transportation of personnel and repair parts. Disaster Response Units (DRU) were formed from active duty and reserve units throughout the Second Coast Guard District and consisted of eight members equipped with three 16-foot flood punts powered by 25 horsepower outboard motors. The DRU's accounted for 1517 boat sorties and 3342 hours of underway operations. Coast Guard helicopters from CG Air Stations in Traverse City and Detroit, Michigan; Chicago, Illinois; Elizabeth City, North Carolina; and Mobile, Alabama provided search and rescue, logistical support and aerial survey intelligence. The Coast Guard Auxiliary provided three fixed wing aircraft. There were 473 aircraft sorties with 570 hours of aircraft operations. CGF St. Louis stood down from the alert phase of operations on 27 August. A total of 380 Active Duty, 352 Reserve, 179 Auxiliary, and 5 Coast Guard civilians were involved in the operation.<ref>After Action Report for Operation Buckshot, Commander, Coast Guard Forces St. Louis, 2nd Coast Guard District, 15 August 1993</ref>\n\n===1994 Cuban boat rescues===\n[[File:USCGC Tamaroa WUEC-166 1990.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[USCGC Tamaroa|USCGC ''Tamaroa'']] (WMEC-166), best known for her rescues during the \"[[1991 Halloween Nor'easter|Perfect Storm]]\" of 1991.]]\nIn 1994, about 38,000 Cubans attempted to sail from Cuba to Florida, many on homemade rafts.  The Coast Guard and Navy performed intensive search and rescue efforts to rescue rafters at sea. Sixteen 110-foot (34 m) cutters\u2014half the complement of the Coast Guard\u2014were involved in this operation, as well as buoy tenders not normally assigned to high seas duty. Due to a change in Presidential policy, rescued Cubans were sent to the U.S. Naval Station at [[Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba|Guantanamo Bay]], Cuba.\n\n===1999 Kosovo===\nIn the summer of 1999, {{USCGC|Bear|WMEC-901}} deployed to the Adriatic Sea in support of [[Operation Allied Force]] and [[Operation Noble Anvil]] with the {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71}} Battle Group providing surface surveillance and SAR response for the Sea Combat Commander, and force protection for the Amphibious Ready Group operating near Albania. The ''Bear'' also provided security to the US Army vessels transporting military cargo between Italy and Albania. This escort operation took ''Bear'' up to the Albanian coastline, well within enemy surface-to-surface missile range. ''Bear'' earned the [[Kosovo Campaign Medal]] and the [[NATO Kosovo Medal]].[http://www.uscg.mil/history/uscghist/KosovoBear.pdf]\n\n==The 2000s==\n:''For details on the Coast Guard's response to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], see [[Missions of the United States Coast Guard]] above.''\n\n===Transfer to the Department of Homeland Security===\nThe Coast Guard was transferred from the Department of Transportation to the [[Department of Homeland Security]] on 1 March 2003 under the [[Homeland Security Act]] (Public Law No. 107-296).\n\nIn 2002, the Coast Guard sent several 110-foot (34 m) cutters to the [[Persian Gulf]] to enforce the U.N. embargo on goods to and from [[Iraq]]. [[Port Security Unit]]s and [[Naval Coastal Warfare]] units also accompanied the U.S. military buildup.\n\n===Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan===\n[[File:US Coast Guard Transportable Port Security Unit.jpg|thumb|US Coast Guard Port Security Unit patrols Umm Qasr]]\nDuring [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], the Coast Guard had deployed its largest contingent of Coast Guardsmen and assets overseas since the Vietnam War.

This change is coordinate invariant and therefore the Lie derivative is defined on any  [[differentiable manifold]].\n\nFunctions, tensor fields and forms can be differentiated with respect to a vector field. If ''T'' is a tensor field and ''X'' is a vector field, then the Lie derivative of ''T'' with respect to ''X'' is denoted <math> \\mathcal{L}_X(T)</math>. The [[differential operator]] <math> T \\mapsto \\mathcal{L}_X(T)</math> is a [[derivation (differential algebra)|derivation]] of the algebra of [[tensor fields]] of the underlying manifold.\n\nThe Lie derivative commutes with [[Tensor contraction|contraction]] and the [[exterior derivative]] on [[differential forms]].\n\nAlthough there are many concepts of taking a derivative in differential geometry, they all agree when the expression being differentiated is a function or [[scalar field]]. Thus in this case the word \"Lie\" is dropped, and one simply speaks of the derivative of a function.\n\nThe Lie derivative of a vector field ''Y'' with respect to another vector field ''X'' is known as the \"[[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]]\"  of ''X'' and ''Y'', and is often denoted [''X'',''Y''] instead of <math> \\mathcal{L}_X(Y)</math>. The space of vector fields forms a [[Lie algebra]] with respect to this Lie bracket. The Lie derivative constitutes an infinite-dimensional [[Lie algebra representation]] of this Lie algebra, due to the identity\n\n:<math> \\mathcal{L}_{[X,Y]} T = \\mathcal{L}_X \\mathcal{L}_{Y} T - \\mathcal{L}_Y \\mathcal{L}_X T,</math>\n\nvalid for any vector fields ''X'' and ''Y'' and any tensor field ''T''.\n\nConsidering vector fields as [[Lie algebra|infinitesimal generator]]s of [[Flow (mathematics)|flows]] (i.e. one-dimensional [[Group (mathematics)|groups]] of [[diffeomorphism]]s) on ''M'', the Lie derivative is the [[Lie_algebra_representation#Infinitesimal_Lie_group_representations|differential]] of the representation of the [[Diffeomorphism#Diffeomorphism group|diffeomorphism group]] on tensor fields, analogous to Lie algebra representations as [[Lie algebra representation#Infinitesimal Lie group representations|infinitesimal representations]] associated to [[group representation]] in [[Lie group]] theory.\n\nGeneralisations exist for [[spinor]] fields, [[fibre bundle]]s with [[Connection (mathematics)|connection]] and vector-valued [[differential forms]].\n\n==Motivation==\nA 'na\u00efve' attempt to define the derivative of a [[tensor field]] with respect to a [[vector field]] would be to take the [[Tensor#As multidimensional arrays|components]] of the tensor field and take the [[directional derivative]] with respect to the vector field of each component. However, this definition is undesirable because it is not invariant under [[Manifold#Transition map|changes of coordinate system]], e.g. the naive derivative expressed in polar or spherical coordinates differs from the naive derivative of the components in polar or spherical coordinates. On an abstract [[manifold]] such a definition is meaningless and ill defined. In [[differential geometry]], there are  three main coordinate independent notions of differentiation of tensor fields: Lie derivatives, derivatives with respect to [[Connection_(differential_geometry)|connections]], and the [[exterior derivative]] of completely anti symmetric (covariant) tensors or [[differential forms]]. The main difference between the Lie derivative and a derivative with respect to a connection is that the latter derivative of a tensor field with respect to a [[tangent space|tangent vector]] is well-defined even if it is not specified how to extend that tangent vector to a vector field. However a connection requires the choice of an additional geometric structure (e.g. a [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian metric]] or just an abstract [[Connection_(differential_geometry)|connection]]) on the manifold. In contrast, when taking a Lie derivative, no additional structure on the manifold is needed, but it is impossible to talk about the Lie derivative of a tensor field with respect to a single tangent vector, since the value of the Lie derivative of a tensor field with respect to a vector field ''X'' at a point ''p'' depends on the value of ''X'' in a neighborhood of ''p'', not just at ''p'' itself. Finally, the exterior derivative of differential forms does not require any additional choices, but is only a well defined derivative of differential forms (including functions).\n\n==Definition==\nThe Lie derivative may be defined in several equivalent ways. To keep things simple, we begin by defining the Lie derivative acting on scalar functions and vector fields, before moving on to the definition for general tensors.\n\n===The (Lie) derivative of a function===\nThe problem with generalizing the derivative of a function when we consider functions over manifolds is that the usual [[difference quotient]] requires we define addition on the function's inputs but it is meaningless to add points on a manifold which is not a vector space.  The critical issue, however, is to consider how the function changes relative to smooth displacements of the points.  The Lie derivative of a scalar function can be thought of as a definition of the derivative where we are using the flows defined by vector fields to displace the points:\n\n:The Lie derivative of a function ''f'' with respect to a [[vector field]] ''X'' at a point ''p'' of the manifold ''M'' is the value\n::<math>\\mathcal{L}_X f (p) = \\lim_{t\\to 0} \\frac{f(P(t;p)) - f(p)}{t}</math>\nwhere <math>P(t; p)</math> is the point to which the [[flow (mathematics)|flow]] defined by the vector field <math>X</math> maps the point <math>p</math> as follows: in a coordinate neighbourhood with coordinates <math> x^1,..., x^n</math>we can express the vector field (which we consider as a first order differential operator) as <math>X = X^\\mu(x)\\partial_\\mu = X^\\mu \\frac\\partial{\\partial x^\\mu}</math>. Locally, the flow is then defined by <math> x^\\mu(P(t; p)) = P^\\mu(t, p^1,..., p^n)</math> where <math>p^\\mu = x^\\mu(p)</math> and <math>P^\\mu(t;0)</math> is the solution to the partial differential equation  \n::<math> \\partial_t P^\\mu(t; p^1, ..., p^n) = X^\\mu(P^1(t; p^1,..., p^n),..., P^n(t, p^1, ..., p^n)) </math>\nwith <math>P^\\mu(0; p^1,...,p^n) = p^\\mu</math>.\n \nWe can then identify the Lie derivative of a function at ''p'' with the [[directional derivative]]:\n::<math>(\\mathcal{L}_X f)(p) = (X f)(p) = X^\\mu \\partial_\\mu(f(p(x^1,...,x^n))) = \\partial_t (f(P(t; p)))</math>\n\n===The Lie derivative of a vector field===\nIf ''X'' and ''Y'' are both vector fields, then the Lie derivative of ''Y'' with respect to ''X'' is also known as the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]] of ''X'' and ''Y'', and is sometimes denoted <math>[X,Y]</math>. There are several approaches to defining the Lie bracket, all of which are equivalent. We list two definitions here, corresponding to the two definitions of a vector field given above:\n\n* The Lie bracket of ''X'' and ''Y'' at ''p'' is given in local coordinates by the formula\n\n<math>\\mathcal{L}_X Y (p) = [X,Y](p) = \\partial_X Y(p) - \\partial_Y X(p),</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\partial_X</math> and <math>\\partial_Y</math> denote the operations of taking the [[directional derivative]]s with respect to ''X'' and ''Y'', respectively. Here we are treating a vector in ''n''-dimensional space as an ''n''-[[tuple]], so that its directional derivative is simply the tuple consisting of the directional derivatives of its coordinates. Although the final expression <math>\\partial_X Y(p) - \\partial_Y X(p)</math> appearing in this definition does not depend on the choice of local coordinates, the individual terms <math>\\partial_X Y(p)</math> and <math>\\partial_Y X(p)</math> do depend on the choice of coordinates.\n\n* If ''X'' and ''Y'' are vector fields on a manifold ''M'' according to the second definition, then the operator <math>\\mathcal{L}_X Y = [X,Y]</math> defined by the formula\n::<math>[X,Y]: C^\\infty(M) \\rightarrow C^\\infty(M)</math>\n::<math>[X,Y](f) = X(Y(f)) - Y(X(f))</math>\nis a derivation of order zero of the algebra of smooth functions of ''M'', i.e. this operator is a vector field according to the second definition.\n\n===The Lie derivative of a tensor field===\nMore generally, if we have a [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] [[tensor field]] ''T'' of [[Tensor order|rank]] <math>(q,r)</math> and a differentiable [[vector field]] ''Y'' (i.e. a differentiable section of the [[tangent bundle]] ''TM''), then we can define the Lie derivative of ''T'' along ''Y''. Let, for some open interval ''I'' around 0, {{nowrap|''\u03c6'' : ''M'' \u00d7 ''I'' \u2192 ''M''}} be the one-parameter semigroup of local diffeomorphisms of ''M'' induced by the [[vector flow]] of ''Y'' and denote {{nowrap|1=''\u03c6''<sub>''t''</sub>(''p'') := ''\u03c6''(''p'', ''t'')}}. For each sufficiently small ''t'', ''\u03c6''<sub>''t''</sub> is a diffeomorphism from a [[neighborhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] in ''M'' to another neighborhood in ''M'', and ''\u03c6''<sub>0</sub> is the identity diffeomorphism. The Lie derivative of ''T'' is defined at a point ''p'' by\n\n:<math>(\\mathcal{L}_Y T)_p=\\left.\\frac{d}{dt}\\right|_{t=0}\\left((\\varphi_{-t})_*T_{\\varphi_{t}(p)}\\right).</math>\n\nwhere <math>(\\varphi_t)_*</math> is the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]] along the diffeomorphism and <math>(\\varphi_t)^*</math> is the [[Pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] along the diffeomorphism. Intuitively, if you have a tensor field <math>T</math> and a vector field ''Y'', then <math>\\mathcal{L}_{Y} T</math> is the infinitesimal change you would see when you flow <math>T</math> using the vector field \u2212''Y'', which is the same thing as the infinitesimal change you would see in <math>T</math> if you yourself flowed along the vector field  ''Y''.\n\nWe now give an algebraic definition. The algebraic definition for the Lie derivative of a tensor field follows from the following four axioms:\n\n:'''Axiom 1.''' The Lie derivative of a function is equal to the directional derivative of the function. This fact is often expressed by the formula\n::<math>\\mathcal{L}_Yf=Y(f)</math>\n\n:'''Axiom 2.''' The Lie derivative obeys the following version of Leibniz's rule: For any tensor fields ''S'' and ''T'', we have\n::<math>\\mathcal{L}_Y(S\\otimes T)=(\\mathcal{L}_YS)\\otimes T+S\\otimes (\\mathcal{L}_YT).</math>\n\n:'''Axiom 3.''' The Lie derivative obeys the Leibniz rule with respect to [[Tensor contraction|contraction]]:\n::<math> \\mathcal{L}_X (T(Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n)) = (\\mathcal{L}_X T)(Y_1,\\ldots, Y_n) + T((\\mathcal{L}_X Y_1), \\ldots, Y_n) + \\cdots + T(Y_1, \\ldots, (\\mathcal{L}_X Y_n)) </math>\n\n:'''Axiom 4.''' The Lie derivative commutes with exterior derivative on functions:\n::<math> [\\mathcal{L}_X, d] = 0 </math>\n\nIf these axioms hold, then applying the Lie derivative <math>\\mathcal{L}_X</math> to the relation <math> df(Y) = Y(f) </math> shows that\n::<math>\\mathcal{L}_X Y (f) = X(Y(f)) - Y(X(f)),</math>\nwhich is one of the standard definitions for the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]].\n\nThe Lie derivative acting on a differential form is the [[Commutator#Ring theory|anticommutator]] of the [[interior product]] with the exterior derivative. So if \u03b1 is a differential form,\n::<math>\\mathcal{L}_Y\\alpha=i_Yd\\alpha+di_Y\\alpha.</math>\nThis follows easily by checking that the expression commutes with exterior derivative, is a derivation (being an anticommutator of graded derivations) and does the right thing on functions.\n\nExplicitly, let ''T'' be a tensor field of type {{nowrap|(''p'', ''q'')}}. Consider ''T'' to be a differentiable [[multilinear map]] of [[smooth function|smooth]] [[section (fiber bundle)|sections]] ''\u03b1''<sup>1</sup>, ''\u03b1''<sup>2</sup>, ..., ''\u03b1''<sup>''q''</sup> of the cotangent bundle ''T''<sup>\u2217</sup>''M'' and of sections ''X''<sub>1</sub>, ''X''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''X''<sub>p</sub> of the [[tangent bundle]] ''TM'', written ''T''(''\u03b1''<sup>1</sup>, ''\u03b1''<sup>2</sup>, ..., ''X''<sub>1</sub>, ''X''<sub>2</sub>, ...) into '''R'''. Define the Lie derivative of ''T'' along ''Y'' by the formula\n\n:<math>(\\mathcal{L}_Y T)(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\ldots, X_1, X_2, \\ldots) =Y(T(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\ldots,X_1,X_2,\\ldots))</math>\n::<math>- T(\\mathcal{L}_Y\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\ldots, X_1, X_2, \\ldots)\n- T(\\alpha_1, \\mathcal{L}_Y\\alpha_2, \\ldots, X_1, X_2, \\ldots) -\\ldots </math>\n::<math>- T(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\ldots, \\mathcal{L}_YX_1, X_2, \\ldots)\n-  T(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\ldots, X_1, \\mathcal{L}_YX_2, \\ldots) - \\ldots\n</math>\n\nThe analytic and algebraic definitions can be proven to be equivalent using the properties of the pushforward and the [[General Leibniz rule|Leibniz rule]] for differentiation. The Lie derivative commutes with the contraction.\n\n===The Lie derivative of a differential form===\n{{see also|Interior product}}\nA particularly important class of tensor fields is the class of [[differential forms]]. The restriction of the Lie derivative to the space of differential forms is closely related to the [[exterior derivative]]. Both the Lie derivative and the exterior derivative attempt to capture the idea of a derivative in different ways. These differences can be bridged by introducing the idea of an [[interior product]], after which the relationships falls out as an identity known as '''Cartan's formula'''. Cartan's formula can also be used as a definition of the Lie derivative on the space of differential forms.\n\nLet ''M'' be a manifold and ''X'' a vector field on ''M''. Let <math>\\omega \\in \\Lambda^{k+1}(M)</math> be a {{nowrap|(''k'' + 1)}}-[[Differential form|form]], i.e. for each <math>p \\in M</math>, <math>\\omega(p)</math> is an [[Alternating form|alternating]] [[multilinear map]] from <math>(T_p M)^{k + 1}</math> to the real numbers. The [[interior product]] of ''X'' and ''\u03c9'' is the ''k''-form <math>i_X\\omega</math> defined as\n\n:<math>(i_X\\omega) (X_1, \\ldots, X_k) = \\omega (X,X_1, \\ldots, X_k)\\,</math>\n\nThe differential form <math>i_X\\omega</math> is also called the '''contraction''' of ''\u03c9'' with ''X'', and\n:<math>i_X:\\Lambda^{k+1}(M) \\rightarrow \\Lambda^k(M)</math>\n\nand  <math>i_X</math> is a <math>\\wedge</math>-[[derivation (abstract algebra)|antiderivation]]. That is, <math>i_X</math> is '''R'''-linear, and\n\n:<math>i_X (\\omega \\wedge \\eta) = \n(i_X \\omega) \\wedge \\eta + (-1)^k \\omega \\wedge (i_X \\eta)</math>\n\nfor <math>\\omega \\in \\Lambda^k(M)</math> and \u03b7 another differential form. Also, for a function <math>f \\in \\Lambda^0(M)</math>, that is, a real- or complex-valued function on ''M'', one has\n\n:<math>i_{fX} \\omega = f\\,i_X\\omega</math>\n\nwhere <math>f X</math> denotes the product of ''f'' and ''X''.\nThe relationship between [[exterior derivative]]s and Lie derivatives can then be summarized as follows. First, since the Lie derivative of a function ''f'' with respect to a vector field ''X'' is the same as the directional derivative ''X''(''f''), it is also the same as the [[Differential form#Operations on forms|contraction]] of the exterior derivative of ''f'' with ''X'':\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{L}_Xf = i_X \\, df</math>\n\nFor a general differential form, the Lie derivative is likewise a contraction, taking into account the variation in ''X'':\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{L}_X\\omega = i_Xd\\omega + d(i_X \\omega).</math>\n\nThis identity is known variously as '''Cartan formula''', '''Cartan homotopy formula''' or '''Cartan's magic formula'''. See [[interior product]] for details. The Cartan formula can be used as a definition of the Lie derivative of a differential form. Cartan's formula shows in particular that\n\n:<math>d\\mathcal{L}_X\\omega = \\mathcal{L}_X(d\\omega).</math>\n\nThe Lie derivative also satisfies the relation\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{L}_{fX}\\omega = f\\mathcal{L}_X\\omega + df \\wedge i_X \\omega .</math>\n\n==Coordinate expressions==\n{{Einstein summation convention}}\n\nIn local [[coordinate]] notation, for a type {{nowrap|(''r'', ''s'')}} tensor field <math>T</math>, the Lie derivative along <math>X</math> is\n:<math> \\begin{align}\n(\\mathcal{L}_X T) ^{a_1 \\ldots a_r}{}_{b_1 \\ldots b_s} = & X^c(\\partial_c T^{a_1 \\ldots a_r}{}_{b_1 \\ldots b_s}) \\\\ & - (\\partial_c X ^{a_1}) T ^{c a_2 \\ldots a_r}{}_{b_1 \\ldots b_s} - \\ldots - (\\partial_c X^{a_r}) T ^{a_1 \\ldots a_{r-1}c}{}_{b_1 \\ldots b_s} \\\\ & + (\\partial_{b_1} X^c) T ^{a_1 \\ldots a_r}{}_{c b_2 \\ldots b_s} + \\ldots + (\\partial_{b_s}X^c) T ^{a_1 \\ldots a_r}{}_{b_1 \\ldots b_{s-1} c}\n\\end{align}</math>\nhere, the notation <math>\\partial_a = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^a}</math> means taking the partial derivative with respect to the coordinate <math> x^a</math>. Alternatively, if we are using a [[torsion (differential geometry)|torsion-free]] [[connection (mathematics)|connection]] (e.g., the [[Levi Civita connection]]), then the partial derivative <math>\\partial_a</math> can be replaced with the [[covariant derivative]] which means replacing <math>\\partial_a X^b</math>   with (by abuse of notation) <math>\\nabla_a X^b = X^b_{;a} := (\\nabla X)_a^{\\ b} = \\partial_a X^b  + \\Gamma^b_{ac}X^c</math> where the <math>\\Gamma^a_{bc} = \\Gamma^a_{cb}</math> are the [[Christoffel coefficients]].\n\nThe Lie derivative of a tensor is another tensor of the same type, i.e., even though the individual terms in the expression depend on the choice of coordinate system, the expression as a whole results in a tensor <math>(\\mathcal{L}_X T) ^{a_1 \\ldots a_r}{}_{b_1 \\ldots b_s}\\partial_{a_1}\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes\\partial_{a_r}\\otimes dx^{b_1}\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes dx^{b_s}</math>\nwhich is independent of any coordinate system and of the same type as <math>T</math>.\n\nThe definition can be extended further to tensor densities.  If ''T'' is a tensor density of some real number valued weight ''w'' (e.g. the volume density of weight 1), then its Lie derivative is a tensor density of the same type and weight.\n:<math> (\\mathcal {L}_X T) ^{a_1 \\ldots a_r}{}_{b_1 \\ldots b_s} = X^c(\\partial_c T^{a_1 \\ldots a_r}{}_{b_1 \\ldots b_s}) - (\\partial_c X ^{a_1}) T ^{c a_2 \\ldots a_r}{}_{b_1 \\ldots b_s} - \\ldots - (\\partial_c X^{a_r}) T ^{a_1 \\ldots a_{r-1}c}{}_{b_1 \\ldots b_s} +</math>\n::<math>+  (\\partial_{b_1} X^c) T ^{a_1 \\ldots a_r}{}_{c b_2 \\ldots b_s} + \\ldots + (\\partial_{b_s} X^c) T ^{a_1 \\ldots a_r}{}_{b_1 \\ldots b_{s-1} c} + w (\\partial_{c} X^c) T ^{a_1 \\ldots a_r}{}_{b_1 \\ldots b_{s}}\n</math>\nNotice the new term at the end of the expression.\n\nFor a [[Affine connection|linear connection]] <math>\\Gamma =( \\Gamma^{a}_{bc} )</math>, the Lie derivative along <math>X</math> is<ref>{{cite book|authorlink=Kentaro Yano (mathematician) |last=Yano |first=K. |title=The Theory of Lie Derivatives and its Applications\n|url=https://archive.org/details/theoryofliederiv029601mbp|publisher=North-Holland|year=1957|page=[https://archive.org/details/theoryofliederiv029601mbp/page/n25 8]|isbn=978-0-7204-2104-0}}</ref>\n:<math>\n(\\mathcal{L}_X \\Gamma)^{a}_{bc} =  X^d\\partial_d \\Gamma^{a}_{bc} + \\partial_b\\partial_c X^a - \\Gamma^{d}_{bc}\\partial_d X^a \n+ \\Gamma^{a}_{dc}\\partial_b X^d + \\Gamma^{a}_{bd}\\partial_c X^d\n</math>\n\n===Examples===\nFor clarity we now show the following examples in local [[coordinate]] notation.\n\nFor a [[scalar field]] <math>\\phi(x^c)\\in\\mathcal{F}(M)</math> we have:\n:<math> (\\mathcal {L}_X \\phi)=X(\\phi) = X^a \\partial_a \\phi</math>.\nHence for the scalar field <math>\\phi(x,y) = x^2 - \\sin(y)</math> and the vector field <math>X = \\sin(x)\\partial_y - y^2\\partial_x</math> the corresponding Lie derivative becomes \n<math display=\"block\">\n\\begin{alignat}{4}\n\\mathcal{L}_X\\phi &= (\\sin(x)\\partial_y - y^2\\partial_x)(x^2 - \\sin(y))\\\\\n                  & = -\\sin(x)\\cos(y) - 2xy^2\n\\end{alignat}\n</math>\n\nFor an example of higher rank differential form, \nconsider the 2-form <math>\\omega = (x^2 + y^2)dx\\wedge dz</math> and the vector field <math>X</math> from the previous example.

Theorem 6 from the article: Nichita, F.F. Unification Theories: New Results and Examples. Axioms 2019, 8, 60):\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{L}_X(fY)=(\\mathcal{L}_Xf) Y + f\\mathcal{L}_X Y</math>\n\nwhich may also be written in the equivalent notation\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{L}_X(f\\otimes Y)=\n(\\mathcal{L}_Xf) \\otimes Y + f\\otimes \\mathcal{L}_X Y</math>\n\nwhere the [[tensor product]] symbol <math>\\otimes</math> is used to emphasize the fact that the product of a function times a vector field is being taken over the entire manifold.\n\nAdditional properties are consistent with that of the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]].

Thus, one has the important result that the space of vector fields over ''M'', equipped with the Lie bracket, forms a [[Lie algebra]].\n\nThe Lie derivative also has important properties when acting on differential forms.

This is not obvious from the right-hand side of Kosmann's local expression, as the right-hand side seems to depend on the metric through the spin connection (covariant derivative), the dualisation of vector fields (lowering of the indices) and the Clifford multiplication on the [[spinor bundle]].

This change is coordinate invariant and therefore the Lie derivative is defined on any  [[differentiable manifold]].\n\nFunctions, tensor fields and forms can be differentiated with respect to a vector field. If ''T'' is a tensor field and ''X'' is a vector field, then the Lie derivative of ''T'' with respect to ''X'' is denoted <math> \\mathcal{L}_X(T)</math>. The [[differential operator]] <math> T \\mapsto \\mathcal{L}_X(T)</math> is a [[derivation (differential algebra)|derivation]] of the algebra of [[tensor fields]] of the underlying manifold.\n\nThe Lie derivative commutes with [[Tensor contraction|contraction]] and the [[exterior derivative]] on [[differential forms]].\n\nAlthough there are many concepts of taking a derivative in differential geometry, they all agree when the expression being differentiated is a function or [[scalar field]]. Thus in this case the word \"Lie\" is dropped, and one simply speaks of the derivative of a function.\n\nThe Lie derivative of a vector field ''Y'' with respect to another vector field ''X'' is known as the \"[[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]]\"  of ''X'' and ''Y'', and is often denoted [''X'',''Y''] instead of <math> \\mathcal{L}_X(Y)</math>. The space of vector fields forms a [[Lie algebra]] with respect to this Lie bracket. The Lie derivative constitutes an infinite-dimensional [[Lie algebra representation]] of this Lie algebra, due to the identity\n\n:<math> \\mathcal{L}_{[X,Y]} T = \\mathcal{L}_X \\mathcal{L}_{Y} T - \\mathcal{L}_Y \\mathcal{L}_X T,</math>\n\nvalid for any vector fields ''X'' and ''Y'' and any tensor field ''T''.\n\nConsidering vector fields as [[Lie algebra|infinitesimal generator]]s of [[Flow (mathematics)|flows]] (i.e. one-dimensional [[Group (mathematics)|groups]] of [[diffeomorphism]]s) on ''M'', the Lie derivative is the [[Lie_algebra_representation#Infinitesimal_Lie_group_representations|differential]] of the representation of the [[Diffeomorphism#Diffeomorphism group|diffeomorphism group]] on tensor fields, analogous to Lie algebra representations as [[Lie algebra representation#Infinitesimal Lie group representations|infinitesimal representations]] associated to [[group representation]] in [[Lie group]] theory.\n\nGeneralisations exist for [[spinor]] fields, [[fibre bundle]]s with [[Connection (mathematics)|connection]] and vector-valued [[differential forms]].\n\n==Motivation==\nA 'na\u00efve' attempt to define the derivative of a [[tensor field]] with respect to a [[vector field]] would be to take the [[Tensor#As multidimensional arrays|components]] of the tensor field and take the [[directional derivative]] with respect to the vector field of each component. However, this definition is undesirable because it is not invariant under [[Manifold#Transition map|changes of coordinate system]], e.g. the naive derivative expressed in polar or spherical coordinates differs from the naive derivative of the components in polar or spherical coordinates. On an abstract [[manifold]] such a definition is meaningless and ill defined. In [[differential geometry]], there are  three main coordinate independent notions of differentiation of tensor fields: Lie derivatives, derivatives with respect to [[Connection_(differential_geometry)|connections]], and the [[exterior derivative]] of completely anti symmetric (covariant) tensors or [[differential forms]]. The main difference between the Lie derivative and a derivative with respect to a connection is that the latter derivative of a tensor field with respect to a [[tangent space|tangent vector]] is well-defined even if it is not specified how to extend that tangent vector to a vector field. However a connection requires the choice of an additional geometric structure (e.g. a [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian metric]] or just an abstract [[Connection_(differential_geometry)|connection]]) on the manifold. In contrast, when taking a Lie derivative, no additional structure on the manifold is needed, but it is impossible to talk about the Lie derivative of a tensor field with respect to a single tangent vector, since the value of the Lie derivative of a tensor field with respect to a vector field ''X'' at a point ''p'' depends on the value of ''X'' in a neighborhood of ''p'', not just at ''p'' itself. Finally, the exterior derivative of differential forms does not require any additional choices, but is only a well defined derivative of differential forms (including functions).\n\n==Definition==\nThe Lie derivative may be defined in several equivalent ways. To keep things simple, we begin by defining the Lie derivative acting on scalar functions and vector fields, before moving on to the definition for general tensors.\n\n===The (Lie) derivative of a function===\nThe problem with generalizing the derivative of a function when we consider functions over manifolds is that the usual [[difference quotient]] requires we define addition on the function's inputs but it is meaningless to add points on a manifold which is not a vector space.  The critical issue, however, is to consider how the function changes relative to smooth displacements of the points.  The Lie derivative of a scalar function can be thought of as a definition of the derivative where we are using the flows defined by vector fields to displace the points:\n\n:The Lie derivative of a function ''f'' with respect to a [[vector field]] ''X'' at a point ''p'' of the manifold ''M'' is the value\n::<math>\\mathcal{L}_X f (p) = \\lim_{t\\to 0} \\frac{f(P(t;p)) - f(p)}{t}</math>\nwhere <math>P(t; p)</math> is the point to which the [[flow (mathematics)|flow]] defined by the vector field <math>X</math> maps the point <math>p</math> as follows: in a coordinate neighbourhood with coordinates <math> x^1,..., x^n</math>we can express the vector field (which we consider as a first order differential operator) as <math>X = X^\\mu(x)\\partial_\\mu = X^\\mu \\frac\\partial{\\partial x^\\mu}</math>. Locally, the flow is then defined by <math> x^\\mu(P(t; p)) = P^\\mu(t, p^1,..., p^n)</math> where <math>p^\\mu = x^\\mu(p)</math> and <math>P^\\mu(t;0)</math> is the solution to the partial differential equation  \n::<math> \\partial_t P^\\mu(t; p^1, ..., p^n) = X^\\mu(P^1(t; p^1,..., p^n),..., P^n(t, p^1, ..., p^n)) </math>\nwith <math>P^\\mu(0; p^1,...,p^n) = p^\\mu</math>.\n \nWe can then identify the Lie derivative of a function at ''p'' with the [[directional derivative]]:\n::<math>(\\mathcal{L}_X f)(p) = (X f)(p) = X^\\mu \\partial_\\mu(f(p(x^1,...,x^n))) = \\partial_t (f(P(t; p)))</math>\n\n===The Lie derivative of a vector field===\nIf ''X'' and ''Y'' are both vector fields, then the Lie derivative of ''Y'' with respect to ''X'' is also known as the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]] of ''X'' and ''Y'', and is sometimes denoted <math>[X,Y]</math>. There are several approaches to defining the Lie bracket, all of which are equivalent. We list two definitions here, corresponding to the two definitions of a vector field given above:\n\n* The Lie bracket of ''X'' and ''Y'' at ''p'' is given in local coordinates by the formula\n\n<math>\\mathcal{L}_X Y (p) = [X,Y](p) = \\partial_X Y(p) - \\partial_Y X(p),</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\partial_X</math> and <math>\\partial_Y</math> denote the operations of taking the [[directional derivative]]s with respect to ''X'' and ''Y'', respectively. Here we are treating a vector in ''n''-dimensional space as an ''n''-[[tuple]], so that its directional derivative is simply the tuple consisting of the directional derivatives of its coordinates. Although the final expression <math>\\partial_X Y(p) - \\partial_Y X(p)</math> appearing in this definition does not depend on the choice of local coordinates, the individual terms <math>\\partial_X Y(p)</math> and <math>\\partial_Y X(p)</math> do depend on the choice of coordinates.\n\n* If ''X'' and ''Y'' are vector fields on a manifold ''M'' according to the second definition, then the operator <math>\\mathcal{L}_X Y = [X,Y]</math> defined by the formula\n::<math>[X,Y]: C^\\infty(M) \\rightarrow C^\\infty(M)</math>\n::<math>[X,Y](f) = X(Y(f)) - Y(X(f))</math>\nis a derivation of order zero of the algebra of smooth functions of ''M'', i.e. this operator is a vector field according to the second definition.\n\n===The Lie derivative of a tensor field===\nMore generally, if we have a [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] [[tensor field]] ''T'' of [[Tensor order|rank]] <math>(q,r)</math> and a differentiable [[vector field]] ''Y'' (i.e. a differentiable section of the [[tangent bundle]] ''TM''), then we can define the Lie derivative of ''T'' along ''Y''. Let, for some open interval ''I'' around 0, {{nowrap|''\u03c6'' : ''M'' \u00d7 ''I'' \u2192 ''M''}} be the one-parameter semigroup of local diffeomorphisms of ''M'' induced by the [[vector flow]] of ''Y'' and denote {{nowrap|1=''\u03c6''<sub>''t''</sub>(''p'') := ''\u03c6''(''p'', ''t'')}}. For each sufficiently small ''t'', ''\u03c6''<sub>''t''</sub> is a diffeomorphism from a [[neighborhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] in ''M'' to another neighborhood in ''M'', and ''\u03c6''<sub>0</sub> is the identity diffeomorphism. The Lie derivative of ''T'' is defined at a point ''p'' by\n\n:<math>(\\mathcal{L}_Y T)_p=\\left.\\frac{d}{dt}\\right|_{t=0}\\left((\\varphi_{-t})_*T_{\\varphi_{t}(p)}\\right).</math>\n\nwhere <math>(\\varphi_t)_*</math> is the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]] along the diffeomorphism and <math>(\\varphi_t)^*</math> is the [[Pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] along the diffeomorphism. Intuitively, if you have a tensor field <math>T</math> and a vector field ''Y'', then <math>\\mathcal{L}_{Y} T</math> is the infinitesimal change you would see when you flow <math>T</math> using the vector field \u2212''Y'', which is the same thing as the infinitesimal change you would see in <math>T</math> if you yourself flowed along the vector field  ''Y''.\n\nWe now give an algebraic definition. The algebraic definition for the Lie derivative of a tensor field follows from the following four axioms:\n\n:'''Axiom 1.''' The Lie derivative of a function is equal to the directional derivative of the function. This fact is often expressed by the formula\n::<math>\\mathcal{L}_Yf=Y(f)</math>\n\n:'''Axiom 2.''' The Lie derivative obeys the following version of Leibniz's rule: For any tensor fields ''S'' and ''T'', we have\n::<math>\\mathcal{L}_Y(S\\otimes T)=(\\mathcal{L}_YS)\\otimes T+S\\otimes (\\mathcal{L}_YT).</math>\n\n:'''Axiom 3.''' The Lie derivative obeys the Leibniz rule with respect to [[Tensor contraction|contraction]]:\n::<math> \\mathcal{L}_X (T(Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n)) = (\\mathcal{L}_X T)(Y_1,\\ldots, Y_n) + T((\\mathcal{L}_X Y_1), \\ldots, Y_n) + \\cdots + T(Y_1, \\ldots, (\\mathcal{L}_X Y_n)) </math>\n\n:'''Axiom 4.''' The Lie derivative commutes with exterior derivative on functions:\n::<math> [\\mathcal{L}_X, d] = 0 </math>\n\nIf these axioms hold, then applying the Lie derivative <math>\\mathcal{L}_X</math> to the relation <math> df(Y) = Y(f) </math> shows that\n::<math>\\mathcal{L}_X Y (f) = X(Y(f)) - Y(X(f)),</math>\nwhich is one of the standard definitions for the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]].\n\nThe Lie derivative acting on a differential form is the [[Commutator#Ring theory|anticommutator]] of the [[interior product]] with the exterior derivative. So if \u03b1 is a differential form,\n::<math>\\mathcal{L}_Y\\alpha=i_Yd\\alpha+di_Y\\alpha.</math>\nThis follows easily by checking that the expression commutes with exterior derivative, is a derivation (being an anticommutator of graded derivations) and does the right thing on functions.\n\nExplicitly, let ''T'' be a tensor field of type {{nowrap|(''p'', ''q'')}}. Consider ''T'' to be a differentiable [[multilinear map]] of [[smooth function|smooth]] [[section (fiber bundle)|sections]] ''\u03b1''<sup>1</sup>, ''\u03b1''<sup>2</sup>, ..., ''\u03b1''<sup>''q''</sup> of the cotangent bundle ''T''<sup>\u2217</sup>''M'' and of sections ''X''<sub>1</sub>, ''X''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''X''<sub>p</sub> of the [[tangent bundle]] ''TM'', written ''T''(''\u03b1''<sup>1</sup>, ''\u03b1''<sup>2</sup>, ..., ''X''<sub>1</sub>, ''X''<sub>2</sub>, ...) into '''R'''. Define the Lie derivative of ''T'' along ''Y'' by the formula\n\n:<math>(\\mathcal{L}_Y T)(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\ldots, X_1, X_2, \\ldots) =Y(T(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\ldots,X_1,X_2,\\ldots))</math>\n::<math>- T(\\mathcal{L}_Y\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\ldots, X_1, X_2, \\ldots)\n- T(\\alpha_1, \\mathcal{L}_Y\\alpha_2, \\ldots, X_1, X_2, \\ldots) -\\ldots </math>\n::<math>- T(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\ldots, \\mathcal{L}_YX_1, X_2, \\ldots)\n-  T(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\ldots, X_1, \\mathcal{L}_YX_2, \\ldots) - \\ldots\n</math>\n\nThe analytic and algebraic definitions can be proven to be equivalent using the properties of the pushforward and the [[General Leibniz rule|Leibniz rule]] for differentiation. The Lie derivative commutes with the contraction.\n\n===The Lie derivative of a differential form===\n{{see also|Interior product}}\nA particularly important class of tensor fields is the class of [[differential forms]]. The restriction of the Lie derivative to the space of differential forms is closely related to the [[exterior derivative]]. Both the Lie derivative and the exterior derivative attempt to capture the idea of a derivative in different ways. These differences can be bridged by introducing the idea of an [[interior product]], after which the relationships falls out as an identity known as '''Cartan's formula'''. Cartan's formula can also be used as a definition of the Lie derivative on the space of differential forms.\n\nLet ''M'' be a manifold and ''X'' a vector field on ''M''. Let <math>\\omega \\in \\Lambda^{k+1}(M)</math> be a {{nowrap|(''k'' + 1)}}-[[Differential form|form]], i.e. for each <math>p \\in M</math>, <math>\\omega(p)</math> is an [[Alternating form|alternating]] [[multilinear map]] from <math>(T_p M)^{k + 1}</math> to the real numbers. The [[interior product]] of ''X'' and ''\u03c9'' is the ''k''-form <math>i_X\\omega</math> defined as\n\n:<math>(i_X\\omega) (X_1, \\ldots, X_k) = \\omega (X,X_1, \\ldots, X_k)\\,</math>\n\nThe differential form <math>i_X\\omega</math> is also called the '''contraction''' of ''\u03c9'' with ''X'', and\n:<math>i_X:\\Lambda^{k+1}(M) \\rightarrow \\Lambda^k(M)</math>\n\nand  <math>i_X</math> is a <math>\\wedge</math>-[[derivation (abstract algebra)|antiderivation]]. That is, <math>i_X</math> is '''R'''-linear, and\n\n:<math>i_X (\\omega \\wedge \\eta) = \n(i_X \\omega) \\wedge \\eta + (-1)^k \\omega \\wedge (i_X \\eta)</math>\n\nfor <math>\\omega \\in \\Lambda^k(M)</math> and \u03b7 another differential form. Also, for a function <math>f \\in \\Lambda^0(M)</math>, that is, a real- or complex-valued function on ''M'', one has\n\n:<math>i_{fX} \\omega = f\\,i_X\\omega</math>\n\nwhere <math>f X</math> denotes the product of ''f'' and ''X''.\nThe relationship between [[exterior derivative]]s and Lie derivatives can then be summarized as follows. First, since the Lie derivative of a function ''f'' with respect to a vector field ''X'' is the same as the directional derivative ''X''(''f''), it is also the same as the [[Differential form#Operations on forms|contraction]] of the exterior derivative of ''f'' with ''X'':\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{L}_Xf = i_X \\, df</math>\n\nFor a general differential form, the Lie derivative is likewise a contraction, taking into account the variation in ''X'':\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{L}_X\\omega = i_Xd\\omega + d(i_X \\omega).</math>\n\nThis identity is known variously as '''Cartan formula''', '''Cartan homotopy formula''' or '''Cartan's magic formula'''. See [[interior product]] for details. The Cartan formula can be used as a definition of the Lie derivative of a differential form. Cartan's formula shows in particular that\n\n:<math>d\\mathcal{L}_X\\omega = \\mathcal{L}_X(d\\omega).</math>\n\nThe Lie derivative also satisfies the relation\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{L}_{fX}\\omega = f\\mathcal{L}_X\\omega + df \\wedge i_X \\omega .</math>\n\n==Coordinate expressions==\n{{Einstein summation convention}}\n\nIn local [[coordinate]] notation, for a type {{nowrap|(''r'', ''s'')}} tensor field <math>T</math>, the Lie derivative along <math>X</math> is\n:<math> \\begin{align}\n(\\mathcal{L}_X T) ^{a_1 \\ldots a_r}{}_{b_1 \\ldots b_s} = & X^c(\\partial_c T^{a_1 \\ldots a_r}{}_{b_1 \\ldots b_s}) \\\\ & - (\\partial_c X ^{a_1}) T ^{c a_2 \\ldots a_r}{}_{b_1 \\ldots b_s} - \\ldots - (\\partial_c X^{a_r}) T ^{a_1 \\ldots a_{r-1}c}{}_{b_1 \\ldots b_s} \\\\ & + (\\partial_{b_1} X^c) T ^{a_1 \\ldots a_r}{}_{c b_2 \\ldots b_s} + \\ldots + (\\partial_{b_s}X^c) T ^{a_1 \\ldots a_r}{}_{b_1 \\ldots b_{s-1} c}\n\\end{align}</math>\nhere, the notation <math>\\partial_a = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^a}</math> means taking the partial derivative with respect to the coordinate <math> x^a</math>. Alternatively, if we are using a [[torsion (differential geometry)|torsion-free]] [[connection (mathematics)|connection]] (e.g., the [[Levi Civita connection]]), then the partial derivative <math>\\partial_a</math> can be replaced with the [[covariant derivative]] which means replacing <math>\\partial_a X^b</math>   with (by abuse of notation) <math>\\nabla_a X^b = X^b_{;a} := (\\nabla X)_a^{\\ b} = \\partial_a X^b  + \\Gamma^b_{ac}X^c</math> where the <math>\\Gamma^a_{bc} = \\Gamma^a_{cb}</math> are the [[Christoffel coefficients]].\n\nThe Lie derivative of a tensor is another tensor of the same type, i.e., even though the individual terms in the expression depend on the choice of coordinate system, the expression as a whole results in a tensor <math>(\\mathcal{L}_X T) ^{a_1 \\ldots a_r}{}_{b_1 \\ldots b_s}\\partial_{a_1}\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes\\partial_{a_r}\\otimes dx^{b_1}\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes dx^{b_s}</math>\nwhich is independent of any coordinate system and of the same type as <math>T</math>.\n\nThe definition can be extended further to tensor densities.

Then\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{L}_X : \\mathcal{F}(M) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{F}(M)</math>\n\nis a [[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]] on the algebra <math>\\mathcal{F}(M)</math>. That is,\n<math>\\mathcal{L}_X</math> is '''R'''-linear and\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{L}_X(fg)=(\\mathcal{L}_Xf) g + f\\mathcal{L}_Xg.</math>\n\nSimilarly, it is a derivation on <math>\\mathcal{F}(M) \\times \\mathcal{X}(M)</math> where <math>\\mathcal{X}(M)</math> is the set of vector fields on ''M'' (cf. Theorem 6 from the article: Nichita, F.F. Unification Theories: New Results and Examples. Axioms 2019, 8, 60):\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{L}_X(fY)=(\\mathcal{L}_Xf) Y + f\\mathcal{L}_X Y</math>\n\nwhich may also be written in the equivalent notation\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{L}_X(f\\otimes Y)=\n(\\mathcal{L}_Xf) \\otimes Y + f\\otimes \\mathcal{L}_X Y</math>\n\nwhere the [[tensor product]] symbol <math>\\otimes</math> is used to emphasize the fact that the product of a function times a vector field is being taken over the entire manifold.\n\nAdditional properties are consistent with that of the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]]. Thus, for example, considered as a derivation on a vector field,\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{L}_X [Y,Z] = [\\mathcal{L}_X Y,Z] + [Y,\\mathcal{L}_X Z]</math>\n\none finds the above to be just the [[Jacobi identity]]. Thus, one has the important result that the space of vector fields over ''M'', equipped with the Lie bracket, forms a [[Lie algebra]].\n\nThe Lie derivative also has important properties when acting on differential forms. Let \u03b1 and \u03b2 be two differential forms on ''M'', and let ''X'' and ''Y'' be two vector fields.

This is not obvious from the right-hand side of Kosmann's local expression, as the right-hand side seems to depend on the metric through the spin connection (covariant derivative), the dualisation of vector fields (lowering of the indices) and the Clifford multiplication on the [[spinor bundle]]. Such is not the case: the quantities on the right-hand side of Kosmann's local expression combine so as to make all metric and connection dependent terms cancel.\n\nTo gain a better understanding of the long-debated concept of Lie derivative of spinor fields one may refer to the original article,<ref>{{cite book |last=Fatibene |first=L. |last2=Ferraris |first2=M. |last3=Francaviglia |first3=M. |last4=Godina |first4=M. |year=1996 |chapter=A geometric definition of Lie derivative for Spinor Fields |title=Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Differential Geometry and Applications, August 28th\u2013September 1st 1995 (Brno, Czech Republic) |editor-last=Janyska |editor-first=J. |editor2-last=Kol\u00e1\u0159 |editor2-first=I. |editor3-last=Slov\u00e1k |editor3-first=J. |publisher=Masaryk University |location=Brno |pages=549\u2013558 |isbn=80-210-1369-9 |arxiv=gr-qc/9608003v1 |bibcode=1996gr.qc.....8003F }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Godina |first=M. |last2=Matteucci |first2=P. |year=2003 |title=Reductive G-structures and Lie derivatives |journal=[[Journal of Geometry and Physics]] |volume=47 |issue= |pages=66\u201386 |doi=10.1016/S0393-0440(02)00174-2 |arxiv=math/0201235 |bibcode=2003JGP....47...66G }}</ref> where the definition of a Lie derivative of spinor fields is placed in the more general framework of the theory of Lie derivatives of sections of fiber bundles and the direct approach by Y. Kosmann to the spinor case is generalized to gauge natural bundles in the form of a new geometric concept called the [[Kosmann lift]].\n\n===Covariant Lie derivative===\nIf we have a principal bundle over the manifold M with G as the structure group, and we pick X to be a covariant vector field as section of the tangent space of the principal bundle (i.e. it has horizontal and vertical components), then the covariant Lie derivative is just the Lie derivative with respect to X over the principal bundle.\n\nNow, if we're given a vector field ''Y'' over ''M'' (but not the principal bundle) but we also have a [[Connection (mathematics)|connection]] over the principal bundle, we can define a vector field X over the principal bundle such that its horizontal component matches ''Y'' and its vertical component agrees with the connection. This is the covariant Lie derivative.\n\nSee [[connection form]] for more details.\n\n===Nijenhuis\u2013Lie derivative===\n\nAnother generalization, due to [[Albert Nijenhuis]], allows one to define the Lie derivative of a differential form along any section of the bundle \u03a9<sup>''k''</sup>(''M'', T''M'') of differential forms with values in the tangent bundle. If ''K''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;\u03a9<sup>''k''</sup>(''M'', T''M'') and \u03b1 is a differential ''p''-form, then it is possible to define the interior product ''i''<sub>''K''</sub>\u03b1 of ''K'' and \u03b1. The Nijenhuis\u2013Lie derivative is then the anticommutator of the interior product and the exterior derivative:\n:<math>\\mathcal{L}_K\\alpha=[d,i_K]\\alpha = di_K\\alpha-(-1)^{k-1}i_K \\, d\\alpha.</math>\n\n==History==\nIn 1931, [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw \u015alebodzi\u0144ski]] introduced a new differential operator, later called by [[David van Dantzig]] that of Lie derivation, which can be applied to scalars, vectors, tensors and affine connections and which proved to be a powerful instrument in the study of groups of automorphisms.\n\nThe Lie derivatives of general geometric objects (i.e., sections of [[natural bundle|natural fiber bundle]]s) were studied by [[Albert Nijenhuis|A.
