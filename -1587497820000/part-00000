Herold began to undergo slow intensification. At 18:00 UTC on 15 March, the cyclone was designated [[Tropical Cyclone]] Herold. Late on March 17, Herold reached its peak intensity as an intense tropical cyclone, and the JTWC classified it as a [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale#Category 3|Category 3-equivalent tropical cyclone]].

It regularly happens as part of traditional and [[intensive pig farming]].\n\nPigs are slaughtered at different ages. Generally they can be divided into [[Piglet (animal)|piglets]], which are 1.5 to 3 months old; the [[fattening pig]]s, intended for pork and [[bacon]], which are 4 months to one year old; and finally the older pigs, such as sows (female pigs) and [[boar]]s (un[[castrated]] male pigs). The meat obtained from piglets is subdivided into more meaty or more fatty, determined by the thickness of bacon. Male hogs are usually castrated a month before slaughter. Their meat quality is determined on the mass of halves and the thickness of bacon on the back.\n\nThe [[Humane Slaughter Association]] states that the transport of pigs to slaughter and all the other procedures and circumstances leading up to the actual act of stunning and killing the pig are, in modern times, often carefully arranged in order to avoid excessive suffering of animals, which both has a humane rationale as well as helping provide for a higher quality of meat.<ref>[http://www.hsa.org.uk/Information/Slaughter/Pig%20Slaughter.html Humane Slaughter of Pigs], by the [[Humane Slaughter Association]], United Kingdom</ref><ref name=\"zdolec-2006\"/> [[List of animal rights groups|Animal rights groups]] have recorded images of pigs being transported to slaughter in cramped and unhygienic conditions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2012/05/09/porter_toronto_pig_save_activists_protest_slaughter_weekly_at_quality_meat_packers_abattoir.html|title=Porter: Toronto Pig Save activists protest slaughter weekly at Quality Meat Packers abattoir {{!}} The Star|website=thestar.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.peta.org/features/heartbreaking-pig-transport-photos/|title=22 Heartbreaking Photos From Pigs' Journey to Slaughter|date=2014-12-18|website=PETA|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref> They state that the transportation does cause suffering, which has economic rationale.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.animal-ethics.org/journey-slaughterhouse/|title=The journey to the slaughterhouse|last=Ethics|first=Animal|date=2016-03-29|website=Animal Ethics|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref>\n\nTypically, pigs are first rendered unconscious using one of the following means: stunning using [[electric current]] applied with [[electrode]]s, or stunning using [[captive bolt pistol]], and inhalation of [[CO2|CO<sub>2</sub>]], then in some cases a .22 pistol/rifle which is shot directly into the brain. They are then hoisted on a rail, after which they are [[exsanguinate]]d, usually via the [[carotid artery]] and the [[jugular vein]]. After the [[blood]] is gone, the [[Cadaver|carcass]] is drenched in hot water in a device called a [[pig scalder]] which helps in the removal of hair, which is subsequently completed by using scissor-like devices and then if necessary with a torch. However, in many countries across the world, rendering the pig unconscious is not standard practice and exsanguination occurs whilst the pigs are fully conscious.\n\nThe pig is then [[Disembowelment|eviscerated]], the head is usually removed, and the body is cut into two-halves. The remaining halves are washed to remove any remaining blood, [[bacteria]] or remains of bone, and then cooled down in order to help with the process of cutting and deboning.\n\nIn the [[European Union]], the Regulation (EC) of the [[European Parliament]] and of the [[European Council|Council]] No. 852/2004, 853/2004 and 854/2004 cover various aspects of hygiene of foodstuffs that includes pig slaughter.<ref>[http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/food_safety/veterinary_checks_and_food_hygiene/f84001_en.htm Food hygiene<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/food_safety/veterinary_checks_and_food_hygiene/f84002_en.htm Hygiene for food of animal origin<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/food_safety/veterinary_checks_and_food_hygiene/f84003_en.htm Official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==European tradition==\n[[File:Sausage making-H-1.jpg|thumb|uright|The process of making a sausage in a traditional Hungarian household]]\n\nPig slaughter is a tradition known in numerous [[Europe]]an countries and regions: [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]] (''\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0435, kolene na prase''), [[North Macedonia]] (''\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u045a\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0435, kolenje na prase''), [[Croatia]] (''kolinje''), the [[Czech Republic]] (''zabija\u010dka''), [[Greece]], [[Hungary]] (''diszn\u00f3v\u00e1g\u00e1s''), [[Italy]] (''maialata''), [[Moldova]], [[Poland]] (''\u015bwiniobicie''), [[Portugal]] (''matan\u00e7a''), [[Romania]] (''t\u0103iatul porcului, Ignat''), [[Russia]], [[Serbia]] (''see below''), [[Slovakia]] (''zab\u00edja\u010dka''), [[Slovenia]] (''koline''), [[Spain]] (''matanza''), [[Ukraine]], [[Corsica]] and others.\n\nFamily [[hog pen]]s have also existed in the [[United States]] on small family farms, but in recent decades has become rare.\n\n===Traditional autumn activity===\nThe slaughter traditionally takes place in the autumn and early winter, and the timing has several practical considerations.<ref name=\"karolyi-salajpal-lukovic-2010\">{{cite journal\n| url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=92871\n| language = Croatian\n| journal = MESO: The First Croatian Meat Journal\n| volume = XII\n| number = 4\n|date=July 2010\n| title = Black Slavonian pig\n| first1 = Danijel | last1 = Karolyi\n| first2 = Kre\u0161imir | last2 = Salajpal\n| first3 = Zoran | last3 = Lukovi\u0107\n| issn = 1332-0025\n| publisher = Zadru\u017ena \u0161tampa, d.d.\n| location = Zagreb, Croatia\n| pages = 222\u2013230\n}}<!-- all three authors from Faculty of Agriculture, [[University of Zagreb]] --></ref> It can start as soon as it gets cold, as the cold is required as a natural method of preserving the relatively large quantities of meat during the [[butcher]]ing.<ref name=\"gradiste-zkg\"/> Yet, because people often do the work in the open, it is preferable that the temperatures aren't too much below freezing during this time, hence the slaughter rarely extends into winter.\nAlso, slaughter activities typically need to produce results before the [[Christmas]] season, to provide for the festive cuisine.\n\nIn the past, this was also the only time of the year when people could afford to eat larger amounts of [[meat]].<ref name=\"gradiste-zkg\"/> In modern times, almost any family in Europe that is so inclined can afford to slaughter, yet there is also an abundance of pre-processed meat in the shops, so the traditional method of slaughtering is becoming more and more of a [[folk custom]] rather than a necessity.\n\nThe slaughter requires numerous preparations, including troughs,<ref name=\"gradiste-zkg\"/> large quantities of boiling water, large wooden [[barrel]]s for storing meat, [[cooking pot|pots]], sharp knives,<ref name=\"gradiste-zkg\"/> and in modern times also artificial intestines (hoses for various sausages).\n\nHistorically, [[butcher]]ing was a trade passed from father to son.<ref name=\"gradiste-zkg\"/> Today the initial slaughter is normally performed by a professional butcher.<ref name=\"karolyi-salajpal-lukovic-2010\"/> After that, the meat is butchered by laymen, and the process is accompanied by various local [[ritual]]s.<ref name=\"gradiste-zkg\"/>\n\n===Act of slaughter and the butchering of carcass===\n[[Image:Zabijacka.jpg|thumb|right|Stirring of blood in order to prevent its coagulation.

The pig is then removed from the trough and any remaining hair is removed with a knife or a [[razor]],<ref name=\"gradiste-zkg\"/> and then it is again washed with hot water.\n\nToday, the animal is rendered unconscious by electrical or carbon dioxide stunning and then immediately bled by cutting the throat.<ref name=\"karolyi-salajpal-lukovic-2010\"/> For quality reasons, mechanical means of stunning such as a [[captive bolt pistol]] are not recommended although in some abattoirs they do use it and the pigs are stunned using 80 volts.<ref name=\"karolyi-salajpal-lukovic-2010\"/><ref>[http://www.hsa.org.uk/Information/Slaughter/Pig%20Slaughter.html Humane Slaughter of Pigs], by the [[Humane Slaughter Association]], England</ref>\n\nThen, the pig's [[intestine]]s are removed. The evisceration process is when the sexual, digestive and excretory organs are removed. These days, the pig can also be obtained as a half (Croatian: ''polovica'' or ''polutka''), without intestines or blood.\n\nIn modern times, because of the danger of [[Trichinosis]], people in some countries are required to have critical parts of the fresh meat tested by a [[veterinarian]] before any further contact with potentially infected meat.<ref name=\"masic-2004\">{{cite journal\n| url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=34002&lang=en\n| language = Croatian\n| journal = MESO: The First Croatian Meat Journal\n| volume = VI\n| number = 2\n|date=April 2004\n| title = Trichinellosis in the Imotska Krajina region\n| first1 = Mario | last1 = Ma\u0161i\u0107\n| issn = 1332-0025\n| publisher = Zadru\u017ena \u0161tampa, d.d.\n| location = Zagreb, Croatia\n| pages = 55\u201360\n}}</ref>\n\nVery sharp knives and a [[cleaver (knife)|cleaver]] are required for butchering. The carcass is cut into [[ham]]s, shoulders, [[bacon]] sides, [[pork belly]]s, [[ham hock]]s, loins, pork chops, and other cuts of lesser importance.\n\n===Processing of animal parts===\nAfter it is cut into pieces, the meat from the animal is then processed further into edible products.\n\nThe buttocks are salted and pressed in order to eventually produce [[ham]]. The ribcage meat is salted and smoked in order to get [[bacon]].<ref name=\"karolyi-salajpal-lukovic-2010\"/> Salt is rubbed thoroughly into each piece of meat and all surfaces are covered. Some formulas also include lots of black pepper.\nThe bulk of the meat is cut and ground to produce various [[sausage]]s, which are traditionally wrapped into the intestines of various sizes.<ref name=\"karolyi-salajpal-lukovic-2010\"/>\n[[File:Schwein-Ganz.svg|thumb|Schematic representation of the main pork cuts.]]\nThe bulk of the fat is cut into small pieces.

The typical tins in the US are five gallons.\nIn some areas (mainly [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Central Europe]], but also [[Italy]] and [[United Kingdom]]), the fat is salted as is to produce [[salo (food)|salo]], [[lardo]] or [[salt pork]].\n\nThe intestines are stripped by drawing them through a clenched fist. They are then washed, cut into short pieces, and fried to make [[chitlin]]s.\n\nThe various \"leftovers\" are put into various forms of [[headcheese]] jelly, etc. Most parts of the pig are used in this traditional process, even parts of the skin that would normally be thrown away are preserved to be cooked with beans.\n\nThe [[smoke house]] is essential for the preservation and long term storage of hams, shoulders, bacon sides, and pork bellies. The meat is hung on racks and hooks in the smokehouse; and later smoked. Fragrant hardwood, such as [[hickory]], [[beech]], or [[cherry]] is allowed to smolder slowly in a pit below the hanging meat. This gives added flavor and color to the meat as well as serving to dry cure the pork.\n\n==Country-specific statistics and customs==\n[[File:Medieval pig slaughter.jpg|thumb|Illustration of medieval pig stunning, from ''The Medieval Cookbook'']]\n\n===Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia and Serbia===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2007}}\n\nThe traditional pig slaughter in [[Croatia]] as well as the neighboring [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], Slovenia and [[Serbia]] is a widespread practice that involves pig slaughtering, processing, and butchery of pig meat, and is observed by rural families, usually in late autumn. The tradition is variously called \"koline\", ''kolinje'', ''pra\u0161\u0107ina'', ''svinjokolj'', ''svinjokolja'' or ''svinjokolje'' or ''posjek''. The names literally mean \"pig-slaughtering\" (''svinja''=pig, n., ''klanje''=slaughter, n.). It is a custom specific to the parts of the countries in the [[Pannonian plain]].<ref name=\"gradiste-zkg\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.gradiste.com/TRADICIJA/zivot_kroz_godinu.htm\n| title = \u017divot kroz godinu\n| language = Croatian\n| accessdate = 25 May 2011\n| author = Kadi\u0107 Goran, Franjo Babi\u0107\n| publisher = gradiste.com\n}}</ref>\n\nAfter WWII, in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], a state holiday fell on 29 November, with that and next day being non-working, so most slaughters were held on that occasion. In Croatian region Dalmatia, the pig-slaughter are traditionally done in period between Christmas and New Year's Eve.\n\nThe entire duration of the slaughter can be as long as three days. Because people were traditionally stocking up on supplies before winter, it became customary to slaughter more than one pig, which increased the amount of time necessary for the meat to be processed. Some families visit their relatives (often grandparents) and friends at that time of the year, in order to help. Also, little [[mechanization]] is used, with meat being cut manually. Any grinding is done with relatively small manually operated, mechanical grinding machines.\n\nThe traditionally produced ham (''\u0161unka''), bacon (''slanina''), the sausages (''kobasica'') such as [[blood sausage]] (''krvavica'') and [[kulen]] are well known as delicacies.<ref name=\"gradiste-zkg\"/> Some of them, notably kulen, are classified under the laws of [[protected designation of origin]]. The non-meat products such as cracklings (''\u010dvarci'') or [[\u0161vargl]] and [[hladetina]] are also respected as parts of traditional cuisine.\n\nTo complement the activities, [[rakija]] or [[wine]] is drunk by participants during the butchering.<ref name=\"gradiste-zkg\"/>\n\nThe pig [[liver]] is customarily roasted the same day of the slaughter.\n<!--\nThe meat can then be salted and stored in a cellar, to be taken out after ten days, when the [[blood]] is squeezed out. The meat is then stored again and left until May of the next year.\n* who does this? -->\n\nMen and women were traditionally assigned different jobs during the slaughter. It was commonly the men who were doing the actual slaughter, the larger part of butchering, and the grinding of meat. Because the society is traditionally [[patriarchal]], the women were in charge of a relatively menial tasks, such as waiting and cooking for the whole crew throughout the event, keeping the environment clean (washing and scrubbing), as well as the emptying the pigs' bowels in order to make them suitable for holding sausage meat.<ref name=\"gradiste-zkg\"/>\n\nThe standard of hygiene long recommended by veterinarians has included various requirements for the people, tools and space used in the process.\nAll people involved in the slaughter and butchering must be healthy, dressed with a hat, apron and boots, and clean hands. The tools (knives, axes, saws etc.) are sharpened, cleaned and disinfected before use, and they should be kept in a clean place throughout the process, preferably in a clean toolbox around the butcher's belt. The location of the killing needs to be a clean concrete surface with a sewer canal, meaning that the space can be easily cleaned. The trough used should have a zinced surface which is easy to clean and disinfect; the wooden troughs absorb water and microorganisms which makes them unsuitable.\n\nThe [[Croatian Ministry of Agriculture]] has published rules on sanitation requirements for animal slaughter since 1992, animal waste disposal rules since 2003, while regulations from 2005 also cover animal welfare in relation to slaughter.<ref name=\"zdolec-2006\">{{cite journal\n| url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=34876&lang=en\n| language = Croatian\n| journal = MESO: The First Croatian Meat Journal\n| volume = VIII\n| number = 4\n|date=July 2006\n| title = Objekti za klanje \u017eivotinja\n|trans-title=Facilities for slaughtering animals\n| first1 = Nevijo | last1 = Zdolec\n| issn = 1332-0025\n| publisher = Zadru\u017ena \u0161tampa, d.d.\n| location = Zagreb, Croatia\n| pages = 190\u2013193\n}}<!-- author is from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, [[University of Zagreb]] --></ref> These rules track the relevant European Union regulation.<ref name=\"zdolec-2006\"/>\n\nCroatian [[animal rights]] activists regard the traditional slaughtering process as cruel and outdated.

It regularly happens as part of traditional and [[intensive pig farming]].\n\nPigs are slaughtered at different ages. Generally they can be divided into [[Piglet (animal)|piglets]], which are 1.5 to 3 months old; the [[fattening pig]]s, intended for pork and [[bacon]], which are 4 months to one year old; and finally the older pigs, such as sows (female pigs) and [[boar]]s (un[[castrated]] male pigs). The meat obtained from piglets is subdivided into more meaty or more fatty, determined by the thickness of bacon. Male hogs are usually castrated a month before slaughter. Their meat quality is determined on the mass of halves and the thickness of bacon on the back.\n\nThe [[Humane Slaughter Association]] states that the transport of pigs to slaughter and all the other procedures and circumstances leading up to the actual act of stunning and killing the pig are, in modern times, often carefully arranged in order to avoid excessive suffering of animals, which both has a humane rationale as well as helping provide for a higher quality of meat.<ref>[http://www.hsa.org.uk/Information/Slaughter/Pig%20Slaughter.html Humane Slaughter of Pigs], by the [[Humane Slaughter Association]], United Kingdom</ref><ref name=\"zdolec-2006\"/> [[List of animal rights groups|Animal rights groups]] have recorded images of pigs being transported to slaughter in cramped and unhygienic conditions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2012/05/09/porter_toronto_pig_save_activists_protest_slaughter_weekly_at_quality_meat_packers_abattoir.html|title=Porter: Toronto Pig Save activists protest slaughter weekly at Quality Meat Packers abattoir {{!}} The Star|website=thestar.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.peta.org/features/heartbreaking-pig-transport-photos/|title=22 Heartbreaking Photos From Pigs' Journey to Slaughter|date=2014-12-18|website=PETA|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref> They state that the transportation does cause suffering, which has economic rationale.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.animal-ethics.org/journey-slaughterhouse/|title=The journey to the slaughterhouse|last=Ethics|first=Animal|date=2016-03-29|website=Animal Ethics|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref>\n\nTypically, pigs are first rendered unconscious using one of the following means: stunning using [[electric current]] applied with [[electrode]]s, or stunning using [[captive bolt pistol]], and inhalation of [[CO2|CO<sub>2</sub>]], then in some cases a .22 pistol/rifle which is shot directly into the brain. They are then hoisted on a rail, after which they are [[exsanguinate]]d, usually via the [[carotid artery]] and the [[jugular vein]]. After the [[blood]] is gone, the [[Cadaver|carcass]] is drenched in hot water in a device called a [[pig scalder]] which helps in the removal of hair, which is subsequently completed by using scissor-like devices and then if necessary with a torch. However, in many countries across the world, rendering the pig unconscious is not standard practice and exsanguination occurs whilst the pigs are fully conscious.\n\nThe pig is then [[Disembowelment|eviscerated]], the head is usually removed, and the body is cut into two-halves. The remaining halves are washed to remove any remaining blood, [[bacteria]] or remains of bone, and then cooled down in order to help with the process of cutting and deboning.\n\nIn the [[European Union]], the Regulation (EC) of the [[European Parliament]] and of the [[European Council|Council]] No. 852/2004, 853/2004 and 854/2004 cover various aspects of hygiene of foodstuffs that includes pig slaughter.<ref>[http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/food_safety/veterinary_checks_and_food_hygiene/f84001_en.htm Food hygiene<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/food_safety/veterinary_checks_and_food_hygiene/f84002_en.htm Hygiene for food of animal origin<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/food_safety/veterinary_checks_and_food_hygiene/f84003_en.htm Official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==European tradition==\n[[File:Sausage making-H-1.jpg|thumb|uright|The process of making a sausage in a traditional Hungarian household]]\n\nPig slaughter is a tradition known in numerous [[Europe]]an countries and regions: [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]] (''\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0435, kolene na prase''), [[North Macedonia]] (''\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u045a\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0435, kolenje na prase''), [[Croatia]] (''kolinje''), the [[Czech Republic]] (''zabija\u010dka''), [[Greece]], [[Hungary]] (''diszn\u00f3v\u00e1g\u00e1s''), [[Italy]] (''maialata''), [[Moldova]], [[Poland]] (''\u015bwiniobicie''), [[Portugal]] (''matan\u00e7a''), [[Romania]] (''t\u0103iatul porcului, Ignat''), [[Russia]], [[Serbia]] (''see below''), [[Slovakia]] (''zab\u00edja\u010dka''), [[Slovenia]] (''koline''), [[Spain]] (''matanza''), [[Ukraine]], [[Corsica]] and others.\n\nFamily [[hog pen]]s have also existed in the [[United States]] on small family farms, but in recent decades has become rare.\n\n===Traditional autumn activity===\nThe slaughter traditionally takes place in the autumn and early winter, and the timing has several practical considerations.<ref name=\"karolyi-salajpal-lukovic-2010\">{{cite journal\n| url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=92871\n| language = Croatian\n| journal = MESO: The First Croatian Meat Journal\n| volume = XII\n| number = 4\n|date=July 2010\n| title = Black Slavonian pig\n| first1 = Danijel | last1 = Karolyi\n| first2 = Kre\u0161imir | last2 = Salajpal\n| first3 = Zoran | last3 = Lukovi\u0107\n| issn = 1332-0025\n| publisher = Zadru\u017ena \u0161tampa, d.d.\n| location = Zagreb, Croatia\n| pages = 222\u2013230\n}}<!-- all three authors from Faculty of Agriculture, [[University of Zagreb]] --></ref> It can start as soon as it gets cold, as the cold is required as a natural method of preserving the relatively large quantities of meat during the [[butcher]]ing.<ref name=\"gradiste-zkg\"/> Yet, because people often do the work in the open, it is preferable that the temperatures aren't too much below freezing during this time, hence the slaughter rarely extends into winter.\nAlso, slaughter activities typically need to produce results before the [[Christmas]] season, to provide for the festive cuisine.\n\nIn the past, this was also the only time of the year when people could afford to eat larger amounts of [[meat]].<ref name=\"gradiste-zkg\"/> In modern times, almost any family in Europe that is so inclined can afford to slaughter, yet there is also an abundance of pre-processed meat in the shops, so the traditional method of slaughtering is becoming more and more of a [[folk custom]] rather than a necessity.\n\nThe slaughter requires numerous preparations, including troughs,<ref name=\"gradiste-zkg\"/> large quantities of boiling water, large wooden [[barrel]]s for storing meat, [[cooking pot|pots]], sharp knives,<ref name=\"gradiste-zkg\"/> and in modern times also artificial intestines (hoses for various sausages).\n\nHistorically, [[butcher]]ing was a trade passed from father to son.<ref name=\"gradiste-zkg\"/> Today the initial slaughter is normally performed by a professional butcher.<ref name=\"karolyi-salajpal-lukovic-2010\"/> After that, the meat is butchered by laymen, and the process is accompanied by various local [[ritual]]s.<ref name=\"gradiste-zkg\"/>\n\n===Act of slaughter and the butchering of carcass===\n[[Image:Zabijacka.jpg|thumb|right|Stirring of blood in order to prevent its coagulation.

Some formulas also include lots of black pepper.\nThe bulk of the meat is cut and ground to produce various [[sausage]]s, which are traditionally wrapped into the intestines of various sizes.<ref name=\"karolyi-salajpal-lukovic-2010\"/>\n[[File:Schwein-Ganz.svg|thumb|Schematic representation of the main pork cuts.]]\nThe bulk of the fat is cut into small pieces. Some of it is fried to produce [[Pork rind|cracklings]]. \n[[Lard]] is made by [[Kitchen rendering|rendering]] - heating fragments of fat in a large iron pot over a fire until it is reduced to simmering grease which congeals when cooled.<ref name=\"karolyi-salajpal-lukovic-2010\"/> Lard is then stored in lard tins with tin covers. The typical tins in the US are five gallons.\nIn some areas (mainly [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Central Europe]], but also [[Italy]] and [[United Kingdom]]), the fat is salted as is to produce [[salo (food)|salo]], [[lardo]] or [[salt pork]].\n\nThe intestines are stripped by drawing them through a clenched fist. They are then washed, cut into short pieces, and fried to make [[chitlin]]s.\n\nThe various \"leftovers\" are put into various forms of [[headcheese]] jelly, etc. Most parts of the pig are used in this traditional process, even parts of the skin that would normally be thrown away are preserved to be cooked with beans.\n\nThe [[smoke house]] is essential for the preservation and long term storage of hams, shoulders, bacon sides, and pork bellies. The meat is hung on racks and hooks in the smokehouse; and later smoked. Fragrant hardwood, such as [[hickory]], [[beech]], or [[cherry]] is allowed to smolder slowly in a pit below the hanging meat. This gives added flavor and color to the meat as well as serving to dry cure the pork.\n\n==Country-specific statistics and customs==\n[[File:Medieval pig slaughter.jpg|thumb|Illustration of medieval pig stunning, from ''The Medieval Cookbook'']]\n\n===Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia and Serbia===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2007}}\n\nThe traditional pig slaughter in [[Croatia]] as well as the neighboring [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], Slovenia and [[Serbia]] is a widespread practice that involves pig slaughtering, processing, and butchery of pig meat, and is observed by rural families, usually in late autumn. The tradition is variously called \"koline\", ''kolinje'', ''pra\u0161\u0107ina'', ''svinjokolj'', ''svinjokolja'' or ''svinjokolje'' or ''posjek''. The names literally mean \"pig-slaughtering\" (''svinja''=pig, n., ''klanje''=slaughter, n.). It is a custom specific to the parts of the countries in the [[Pannonian plain]].<ref name=\"gradiste-zkg\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.gradiste.com/TRADICIJA/zivot_kroz_godinu.htm\n| title = \u017divot kroz godinu\n| language = Croatian\n| accessdate = 25 May 2011\n| author = Kadi\u0107 Goran, Franjo Babi\u0107\n| publisher = gradiste.com\n}}</ref>\n\nAfter WWII, in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], a state holiday fell on 29 November, with that and next day being non-working, so most slaughters were held on that occasion. In Croatian region Dalmatia, the pig-slaughter are traditionally done in period between Christmas and New Year's Eve.\n\nThe entire duration of the slaughter can be as long as three days. Because people were traditionally stocking up on supplies before winter, it became customary to slaughter more than one pig, which increased the amount of time necessary for the meat to be processed. Some families visit their relatives (often grandparents) and friends at that time of the year, in order to help. Also, little [[mechanization]] is used, with meat being cut manually. Any grinding is done with relatively small manually operated, mechanical grinding machines.\n\nThe traditionally produced ham (''\u0161unka''), bacon (''slanina''), the sausages (''kobasica'') such as [[blood sausage]] (''krvavica'') and [[kulen]] are well known as delicacies.<ref name=\"gradiste-zkg\"/> Some of them, notably kulen, are classified under the laws of [[protected designation of origin]]. The non-meat products such as cracklings (''\u010dvarci'') or [[\u0161vargl]] and [[hladetina]] are also respected as parts of traditional cuisine.\n\nTo complement the activities, [[rakija]] or [[wine]] is drunk by participants during the butchering.<ref name=\"gradiste-zkg\"/>\n\nThe pig [[liver]] is customarily roasted the same day of the slaughter.\n<!--\nThe meat can then be salted and stored in a cellar, to be taken out after ten days, when the [[blood]] is squeezed out. The meat is then stored again and left until May of the next year.\n* who does this? -->\n\nMen and women were traditionally assigned different jobs during the slaughter. It was commonly the men who were doing the actual slaughter, the larger part of butchering, and the grinding of meat. Because the society is traditionally [[patriarchal]], the women were in charge of a relatively menial tasks, such as waiting and cooking for the whole crew throughout the event, keeping the environment clean (washing and scrubbing), as well as the emptying the pigs' bowels in order to make them suitable for holding sausage meat.<ref name=\"gradiste-zkg\"/>\n\nThe standard of hygiene long recommended by veterinarians has included various requirements for the people, tools and space used in the process.\nAll people involved in the slaughter and butchering must be healthy, dressed with a hat, apron and boots, and clean hands. The tools (knives, axes, saws etc.) are sharpened, cleaned and disinfected before use, and they should be kept in a clean place throughout the process, preferably in a clean toolbox around the butcher's belt. The location of the killing needs to be a clean concrete surface with a sewer canal, meaning that the space can be easily cleaned. The trough used should have a zinced surface which is easy to clean and disinfect; the wooden troughs absorb water and microorganisms which makes them unsuitable.\n\nThe [[Croatian Ministry of Agriculture]] has published rules on sanitation requirements for animal slaughter since 1992, animal waste disposal rules since 2003, while regulations from 2005 also cover animal welfare in relation to slaughter.<ref name=\"zdolec-2006\">{{cite journal\n| url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=34876&lang=en\n| language = Croatian\n| journal = MESO: The First Croatian Meat Journal\n| volume = VIII\n| number = 4\n|date=July 2006\n| title = Objekti za klanje \u017eivotinja\n|trans-title=Facilities for slaughtering animals\n| first1 = Nevijo | last1 = Zdolec\n| issn = 1332-0025\n| publisher = Zadru\u017ena \u0161tampa, d.d.\n| location = Zagreb, Croatia\n| pages = 190\u2013193\n}}<!-- author is from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, [[University of Zagreb]] --></ref> These rules track the relevant European Union regulation.<ref name=\"zdolec-2006\"/>\n\nCroatian [[animal rights]] activists regard the traditional slaughtering process as cruel and outdated.

In that time he was part of a well-regarded student design publication, ''Espacio'', through which he became acquainted with many artists, including [[Amelia Pel\u00e1ez]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Mijares]]. He began designing layouts for the magazine before serving as its last director when it was shut down in 1957 as a result of the Cuban Revolution. He also served as cultural secretary of the University Student Federation (Federacion Estudiantil Universitaria) and organized a major art exhibition in the university called \"Operaci\u00f3n Cultura\" to invite those living in the rural parts of Cuba to engage with the arts and the university.<ref name=\"Legacy\"/> After relocating to the United States following the revolution, exiled Cuban artists struggled as their patrons had little to spend on the arts. As a result, many went back to school despite being known names in Cuba in order to become accredited in the American art market, though there were few spaces to display their work in the meantime. Recognizing this need and the role of art to help shape and reaffirm a community's cultural identity, Jes\u00fas co-founded the Permuy Gallery in [[Coral Gables]] with his first wife, prominent Cuban art dealer Marta Permuy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mobile.twitter.com/RosLehtinen/status/915678046794993664|title=Twitter|website=mobile.twitter.com}}</ref> Through its run in the early and mid 1970s, the Permuy Gallery was significant for being one of the first Cuban art galleries in south Florida following the Cuban exodus and held many events, exhibitions, and cultural salon gatherings.<ref name=\"Community\"/> It was also credited with beginning the Friday Gallery Nights tradition that continues in Coral Gables as a monthly event, though its was originally held every week. The gallery featured the artwork of several renowned and established Cuban artists as well as newcomers seeking to launch their careers across painting, ceramic, and sculpture. Many were friends of the Permuys while others would become part of their social circles through the gallery. Some notable featured artists included: Pel\u00e1ez, Mijares, [[Ren\u00e9 Portocarrero]], [[V\u00edctor Manuel Garc\u00eda Vald\u00e9s]], [[Juan Gonzalez (artist)|Juan Gonzalez]], [[Rafael Soriano (painter)|Rafael Soriano]], [[Emilio Falero]], and [[Lourdes Gomez-Franca]].<ref name=\"Legacy\"/> Several of the artists shared a background in architecture with Permuy, such as [[Rafael Consuegra]], Baruj Salinas, and Miguel Jorge, which influenced their art.\n\nThe Permuy Gallery had a legacy that extended beyond its five-year run.

He began designing layouts for the magazine before serving as its last director when it was shut down in 1957 as a result of the Cuban Revolution.

Funding for the project came from TEDCO's equity, city loans and a {{CAD|12.5}} million contribution from the city contributed via [[Waterfront Toronto]].\n\nThe building is intended to be an important public destination as well as provide a range of housing and commercial opportunities. No residential or education facilities could be built near the existing Redpath Sugar plant until TEDCO's Corus building buffered the new development from the old industrial uses. However, many aspects of the project have been mired in controversy.\n\nCorus Quay is located near the previous site of the Waterside Sports Tennis Club, which was looking for a new location \"waterside\". But as neither the city nor Waterfront Toronto found an alternative site, Waterside Sports had to close down and went out of business.\n\nIn addition to Corus' business operations, the facility houses the company's television and radio operations in Toronto, including the studios of radio stations [[CFMJ]], [[CFNY-FM]] and [[CILQ-FM]], and the secondary studio for [[CIII-DT|Global Toronto]] and Global's ''The Morning Show'', in late 2016.\n\n==Timeline==\n*'''2005''' The [[Waterfront Toronto|Toronto Waterfront Revitalization Corporation (TWRC)]] created a design review panel, chaired by [[Bruce Kuwabara]], to bring more transparent discussions to the development of the waterfront.

Despite TEDCO providing all details to the City and the TWRC in confidence, the ''[[National Post]]'' criticized the way TEDCO does business and said that it uses \"shadowy negotiations and will, presumably, announce the winner as a fait accompli.\"<ref>[http://www.urbantoronto.ca/showpost.php?p=60501&postcount=2 National Post: Waterfront project shrouded in secrecy]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n*'''April 2007''' TEDCO signs a deal with a media company that will move its 1,100 employees from \"all over\" Toronto to the new building.

A commercial building was also required for planning and environmental reasons on that site otherwise universities, housing and other \"sensitive\" uses could not happen in that area of the waterfront (i.e. there was a need to buffer the heavy industrial use of Redpath Sugar). TEDCO claims first-in tenants need a tax break to locate in currently isolated (but future prime) waterfront property. Other than TEDCO's film studio in the Portlands, no one had invested in the waterfront under the TWRC plan as yet. [That was still the case in the summer of 2011, although the Province of Ontario funded a new building for George Brown College next door to TEDCO's media company building].\n*'''June 2007''' Corus reveals itself as TEDCO's mystery media tenant. Toronto City Council overwhelmingly approves a deal that will have taxpayers initially finance the building under the following scheme: TEDCO is the developer and owner of the building, city lends TEDCO $132 million secured by a mortgage, Waterfront Toronto contributes the $12.5 million, which came from TEDCO's shareholder the City, and TEDCO provides another $10 million equity in addition to the value of the land ($5 million).<ref name=\"Toronto Star\"/> Furthermore, Corus gets a partial tax abatement in the first few years and will pay $24 million in taxes over the 20 years of its lease instead of $42 million. But tax revenues from that land before Corus were less than $100,000 per year. The City and its taxpayers through TEDCO also receives 25 times the rent revenue from the Corus project than from the previous use of the land.\n*'''June 2007''' Jack Diamond submits revised plans to the design review board that include additional architectural elements including: an egg-shaped studio visible within a light-filled atrium dividing two halves of office towers and a restaurant that spills out into an outdoor lakeside caf\u00e9.

Some design review panelists allege that the building, which was supposed to enhance the public realm, will be no more than an ordinary office building.\n*'''December 2007''' the waterfront board votes to withhold $9 million of its $12.5 million contribution unless the economic development corporation and its architects work closely with the design review panel to solve several major alleged architectural flaws.

It is easier to find Javanese [[Gamelan]] instead of ''Tanjidor'' (a mixture between Betawi and Portuguese music), ''Marawis'' (a mixture between Betawi and Yemeni music) or ''Gambang Kromong'' (a mixture between Betawi and Chinese music). The Chinese influenced Betawi culture, reflected in the popularity of Chinese cakes and sweets, [[firecracker]]s and Betawi wedding attire that demonstrates Chinese and Arab influences.\n\nSome festivals such as the ''Jalan Jaksa Festival'', ''Kemang Festival'', ''Festival Condet'' and ''Lebaran Betawi'' include efforts to preserve Betawi arts by inviting artists to display performances.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/08/23/lebaran-betawi-an-event-maintain-bonds-and-traditions.html|title=Lebaran Betawi: An event to maintain bonds and traditions|newspaper=The Jakarta Post|accessdate=27 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190727113539/https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/08/23/lebaran-betawi-an-event-maintain-bonds-and-traditions.html|archive-date=27 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://megapolitan.kompas.com/read/2019/07/27/16343861/festival-condet-2019-upaya-untuk-lestarikan-budaya-betawi|title=Festival Condet 2019, Upaya untuk Lestarikan Budaya Betawi|newspaper=Kompas|accessdate=27 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190727111921/https://megapolitan.kompas.com/read/2019/07/27/16343861/festival-condet-2019-upaya-untuk-lestarikan-budaya-betawi|archive-date=27 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Kn\u00f6rr|first=Jacqueline|title=Kreolit\u00e4t und postkoloniale Gesellschaft.

The dominant colonial styles can be divided into three periods: the [[Dutch Golden Age]] (17th to late 18th century), the transitional style period (late 18th century \u2013 19th century), and Dutch modernism (20th century). Colonial architecture is apparent in houses and villas, churches, civic buildings and offices, mostly concentrated in the [[Jakarta Old Town]] and [[Central Jakarta]]. Architects such as J.C. Schultze and [[Eduard Cuypers]] designed some of the significant buildings. Schultze's works include [[Gedung Kesenian Jakarta|Jakarta Art Building]], the Indonesia Supreme Court Building and [[Ministry of Finance (Indonesia)|Ministry of Finance]] Building, while Cuypers designed [[Museum Bank Indonesia|Bank Indonesia Museum]] and Bank Mandiri Museum.\n[[File:BNI Building.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Wisma 46]] in post-modernist architecture, currently the fourth tallest building in Jakarta]]\n\nIn the early 20th century, most buildings were built in [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Neo-Renaissance]] style.

The dominant colonial styles can be divided into three periods: the [[Dutch Golden Age]] (17th to late 18th century), the transitional style period (late 18th century \u2013 19th century), and Dutch modernism (20th century). Colonial architecture is apparent in houses and villas, churches, civic buildings and offices, mostly concentrated in the [[Jakarta Old Town]] and [[Central Jakarta]]. Architects such as J.C. Schultze and [[Eduard Cuypers]] designed some of the significant buildings. Schultze's works include [[Gedung Kesenian Jakarta|Jakarta Art Building]], the Indonesia Supreme Court Building and [[Ministry of Finance (Indonesia)|Ministry of Finance]] Building, while Cuypers designed [[Museum Bank Indonesia|Bank Indonesia Museum]] and Bank Mandiri Museum.\n[[File:BNI Building.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Wisma 46]] in post-modernist architecture, currently the fourth tallest building in Jakarta]]\n\nIn the early 20th century, most buildings were built in [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Neo-Renaissance]] style.

The elite suburb [[Menteng]], developed during the 1910s, was the city's first attempt at creating an ideal and healthy housing for the middle class.

into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776). The latter, often abbreviated as ''The Wealth of Nations'', is considered his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' and the first modern work of economics.

Smith obtained a professorship at Glasgow, teaching moral philosophy and during this time, wrote and published ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments''.

''The Wealth of Nations'' was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, he developed the concept of [[Division of labour#Adam Smith|division of labour]] and expounded upon how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by writers such as [[Horace Walpole]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=John |first1=McMurray |title=Capitalism's 'Founding Father' Often Quoted, Frequently Misconstrued |url=https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/capitalisms-founding-father-often-quoted-frequently-misconstrued/ |website=Investor.com |accessdate=31 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\n\nSmith was born in [[Kirkcaldy]], in the [[Kingdom of Fife]], Scotland.

In 1740, Smith was the graduate scholar presented to undertake postgraduate studies at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], under the [[Snell Exhibition]].<ref>{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=22}}</ref>\n\nSmith considered the teaching at Glasgow to be far superior to that at Oxford, which he found intellectually stifling.<ref name=\"Bussing-Burks 2003 41\">{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|p=41}}</ref> In Book V, Chapter II of ''The Wealth of Nations'', Smith wrote: \"In the University of Oxford, the greater part of the public professors have, for these many years, given up altogether even the pretence of teaching.\"\nSmith is also reported to have complained to friends that Oxford officials once discovered him reading a copy of David Hume's ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'', and they subsequently confiscated his book and punished him severely for reading it.<ref name=\"rae 1895 5\" /><ref name=\"rae 1895 24\">{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=24}}</ref><ref name=\"Buchholz 1999 12\">{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=12}}</ref> According to William Robert Scott, \"The Oxford of [Smith's] time gave little if any help towards what was to be his lifework.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Introductory Economics |publisher=New Age Publishers |isbn=81-224-1830-9 |page=4|date=December 2006 }}</ref> Nevertheless, Smith took the opportunity while at Oxford to teach himself several subjects by reading many books from the shelves of the large [[Bodleian Library]].<ref name=\"rae 1895 22\">{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=22}}</ref> When Smith was not studying on his own, his time at Oxford was not a happy one, according to his letters.<ref name=\"rae 1895 24\u201325\">{{harvnb|Rae|1895|pp=24\u201325}}</ref> Near the end of his time there, Smith began suffering from shaking fits, probably the symptoms of a nervous breakdown.<ref name=\"Bussing-Burks 2003 42\">{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|p=42}}</ref> He left Oxford University in 1746, before his scholarship ended.<ref name=\"Bussing-Burks 2003 42\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=29}}</ref>\n\nIn Book V of ''The Wealth of Nations'', Smith comments on the low quality of instruction and the meager intellectual activity at [[List of universities in England|English universities]], when compared to their Scottish counterparts. He attributes this both to the rich endowments of the colleges at Oxford and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], which made the income of professors independent of their ability to attract students, and to the fact that distinguished [[Intellectual#Man of Letters|men of letters]] could make an even more comfortable living as ministers of the [[Church of England]].<ref name=\"Buchholz 1999 12\" />\n\nSmith's discontent at Oxford might be in part due to the absence of his beloved teacher in Glasgow, Francis Hutcheson, who was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the University of Glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students, colleagues, and even ordinary residents with the fervor and earnestness of his orations (which he sometimes opened to the public). His lectures endeavoured not merely to teach philosophy, but also to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives, appropriately acquiring the epithet, the preacher of philosophy. Unlike Smith, Hutcheson was not a system builder; rather, his magnetic personality and method of lecturing so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as \"the never to be forgotten Hutcheson\"\u2014a title that Smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people, his good friend David Hume and influential mentor Francis Hutcheson.<ref>Scott, W.&nbsp;R. \"The Never to Be Forgotten Hutcheson: Excerpts from W.&nbsp;R.

On this latter topic, he first expounded his economic philosophy of \"the obvious and simple system of [[Natural and legal rights|natural liberty]]\".

In their writings covering history, politics, philosophy, economics, and religion, Smith and Hume shared closer intellectual and personal bonds than with other important figures of the Scottish Enlightenment.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Smith, Adam (bap. 1723, d. 1790) |encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of National Biography]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=September 2004 |author=Winch, Donald}}</ref>\n\nIn 1751, Smith earned a professorship at Glasgow University teaching [[logic]] courses, and in 1752, he was elected a member of the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh, having been introduced to the society by Lord Kames. When the [[Professor of Moral Philosophy (Glasgow)|head of Moral Philosophy in Glasgow]] died the next year, Smith took over the position.<ref name=\"Bussing-Burks 2003 43\" /> He worked as an academic for the next 13 years, which he characterised as \"by far the most useful and therefore by far the happiest and most honorable period [of his life]\".<ref name=\"rae 1895 42\">{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=42}}</ref>\n\nSmith published ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]'' in 1759, embodying some of his Glasgow lectures. This work was concerned with how human morality depends on sympathy between agent and spectator, or the individual and other members of society. Smith defined \"mutual sympathy\" as the basis of [[Moral sense theory|moral sentiments]]. He based his explanation, not on a special \"moral sense\" as the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Third Lord Shaftesbury]] and Hutcheson had done, nor on [[utilitarianism|utility]] as Hume did, but on mutual sympathy, a term best captured in modern parlance by the 20th-century concept of [[empathy]], the capacity to recognise feelings that are being experienced by another being.\n\n[[File:Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay]], one of the leaders of the [[Physiocracy|physiocratic]] school of thought|alt=A drawing of a man sitting down]]\nFollowing the publication of ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', Smith became so popular that many wealthy students left their schools in other countries to enroll at Glasgow to learn under Smith.<ref>{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=15}}</ref> After the publication of ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', Smith began to give more attention to [[jurisprudence]] and economics in his lectures and less to his theories of morals.<ref>{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=67}}</ref> For example, Smith lectured that the cause of increase in national wealth is labour, rather than the nation's quantity of gold or silver, which is the basis for [[mercantilism]], the [[economic theory]] that dominated Western European economic policies at the time.<ref>{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=13}}</ref>\n\nIn 1762, the University of Glasgow conferred on Smith the title of [[Doctor of Law]]s (LL.D.).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/archives/exhibitions/smith/photogallery/honorarydegree/|title=MyGlasgow \u2013 Archive Services \u2013 Exhibitions \u2013 Adam Smith in Glasgow \u2013 Photo Gallery \u2013 Honorary degree|website=University of Glasgow|accessdate=November 6, 2018}}</ref> At the end of 1763, he obtained an offer from [[Charles Townshend]]\u2014who had been introduced to Smith by David Hume\u2014to tutor his stepson, [[Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch|Henry Scott]], the young Duke of Buccleuch.

Smith proposes a theory of sympathy, in which the act of observing others and seeing the judgements they form of both others and oneself makes people aware of themselves and how others perceive their behaviour. The feedback we receive from perceiving (or imagining) others' judgment creates an incentive to achieve \"mutual sympathy of sentiments\" with them and leads people to develop habits, and then principles, of behaviour, which come to constitute one's conscience.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|2002|p=xv}}</ref>\n\nSome scholars have perceived a conflict between ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' and ''The Wealth of Nations''; the former emphasises sympathy for others, while the latter focuses on the role of self-interest.<ref>{{harvnb|Viner|1991|p=250}}</ref> In recent years, however, some scholars<ref>Wight, Jonathan B.

They claim that in ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', Smith develops a theory of psychology in which individuals seek the approval of the \"impartial spectator\" as a result of a natural desire to have outside observers sympathise with their sentiments. Rather than viewing ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' and ''The Wealth of Nations'' as presenting incompatible views of human nature, some Smith scholars regard the works as emphasising different aspects of human nature that vary depending on the situation. [[James Otteson|Otteson]] argues that both books are Newtonian in their methodology and deploy a similar \"market model\" for explaining the creation and development of large-scale human social orders, including morality, economics, as well as language.<ref>Otteson, James R. 2002, ''Adam Smith's Marketplace of Life''.

This last statement about \"an invisible hand\" has been interpreted in numerous ways.\n\n[[File:19th-century building at location where Adam Smith lived, 1767-1776.jpg|thumb|[[Adam Smith House|Later building on the site]] where Smith wrote ''The Wealth of Nations''|alt=A brown building]]\n<blockquote>As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it.</blockquote>\n\nThose who regard that statement as Smith's central message also quote frequently Smith's dictum:<ref>Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, pp. 26\u201327.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages.</blockquote>However, in ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' he had a more sceptical approach to self-interest as driver of behaviour:<blockquote>How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it.</blockquote>[[File:Wealth of Nations.jpg|thumb|upright|The first page of ''The Wealth of Nations'', 1776 London edition|alt=The first page of a book]]\nSmith's statement about the benefits of \"an invisible hand\" may be meant to answer{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} [[Bernard Mandeville|Mandeville's]] contention that \"Private Vices ... may be turned into Public Benefits\".<ref>Mandeville, B., 1724, ''The Fable of the Bees'', London: Tonson.</ref> It shows Smith's belief that when an individual pursues his self-interest under conditions of justice, he unintentionally promotes the good of society. Self-interested competition in the free market, he argued, would tend to benefit society as a whole by keeping prices low, while still building in an incentive for a wide variety of goods and services. Nevertheless, he was wary of businessmen and warned of their \"conspiracy against the public or in some other contrivance to raise prices\".<ref>Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, pp. 145, 158.</ref> Again and again, Smith warned of the collusive nature of business interests, which may form cabals or [[Monopoly|monopolies]], fixing the highest price \"which can be squeezed out of the buyers\".<ref>Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, p. 79.</ref> Smith also warned that a business-dominated political system would allow a conspiracy of businesses and industry against consumers, with the former scheming to influence politics and legislation. Smith states that the interest of manufacturers and merchants \"in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public ... The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gopnik |first=Adam |title=Market Man |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |issue=18 October 2010 |page=82 |url=https://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/10/18/101018crbo_books_gopnik |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> Thus Smith's chief worry seems to be when business is given special protections or privileges from government; by contrast, in the absence of such special political favours, he believed that business activities were generally beneficial to the whole society:\n\n<blockquote>It is the great multiplication of the production of all the different arts, in consequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a well-governed society, that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people. Every workman has a great quantity of his own work to dispose of beyond what he himself has occasion for; and every other workman being exactly in the same situation, he is enabled to exchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great quantity, or, what comes to the same thing, for the price of a great quantity of theirs. He supplies them abundantly with what they have occasion for, and they accommodate him as amply with what he has occasion for, and a general plenty diffuses itself through all the different ranks of society. (''The Wealth of Nations,'' I.i.10)</blockquote>\n\nThe neoclassical interest in Smith's statement about \"an invisible hand\" originates in the possibility of seeing it as a precursor of [[neoclassical economics]] and its concept of [[General equilibrium theory|general equilibrium]] \u2013 [[Paul Samuelson|Samuelson's]] \"Economics\" refers six times to Smith's \"invisible hand\". To emphasise this connection, Samuelson<ref>Samuelson, P.&nbsp;A./Nordhaus, William&nbsp;D., 1989, ''Economics'', 13th edition, N.Y. et al.: McGraw-Hill, p. 825.</ref> quotes Smith's \"invisible hand\" statement substituting \"general interest\" for \"public interest\". Samuelson<ref>Samuelson, P.&nbsp;A./Nordhaus, William&nbsp;D., 1989, idem, p. 825.</ref> concludes: \"Smith was unable to prove the essence of his invisible-hand doctrine. Indeed, until the 1940s, no one knew how to prove, even to state properly, the kernel of truth in this proposition about perfectly competitive market.\"\n\n[[File:Smith - Inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations, 1922 - 5231847.tif|thumb|170px|1922 printing of ''An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations'']]\nVery differently, classical economists see in Smith's first sentences his programme to promote \"The Wealth of Nations\". Using the physiocratical concept of the economy as a circular process, to secure growth the inputs of Period 2 must exceed the inputs of Period 1. Therefore, those outputs of Period 1 which are not used or usable as inputs of Period 2 are regarded as unproductive labour, as they do not contribute to growth. This is what Smith had heard in France from, among others, [[Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay]], whose ideas Smith was so impressed by that he might have dedicated ''The Wealth of Nations'' to him had he not died beforehand.<ref>{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=80}}</ref><ref>Stewart, D., 1799, ''Essays on Philosophical Subjects, to which is prefixed An Account of the Life and Writings of the Author by Dugald Steward, F.R.S.E.'', Basil; from the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Read by M. Steward, 21 January, and 18 March 1793; in: The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith, 1982, vol. 3, pp. 304 ff.</ref> To this French insight that unproductive labour should be reduced to use labour more productively, Smith added his own proposal, that productive labour should be made even more productive by deepening the [[division of labour]]. Smith argued that deepening the division of labour under competition leads to greater productivity, which leads to lower prices and thus an increasing standard of living\u2014\"general plenty\" and \"universal opulence\"\u2014for all. Extended markets and increased production lead to the continuous reorganisation of production and the invention of new ways of producing, which in turn lead to further increased production, lower prices, and improved standards of living. Smith's central message is, therefore, that under dynamic competition, a growth machine secures \"The Wealth of Nations\". Smith's argument predicted Britain's evolution as the workshop of the world, underselling and outproducing all its competitors. The opening sentences of the \"Wealth of Nations\" summarise this policy:\n\n<blockquote>The annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annually consumes ... . [T]his produce ... bears a greater or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to consume it ... .[B]ut this proportion must in every nation be regulated by two different circumstances;\n* first, by the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which its labour is generally applied; and,\n* secondly, by the proportion between the number of those who are employed in useful labour, and that of those who are not so employed [emphasis added].<ref>Smith, A., 1976, vol. 2a, p. 10, idem</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, Smith added that the \"abundance or scantiness of this supply too seems to depend more upon the former of those two circumstances than upon the latter.\"<ref>Smith, A., 1976, vol. 1, p. 10, para. 4</ref>\n\nThe validation of the market exchange in a Smithian view must conation and hold constant value with the consumer. If a consumer no longer values a good or service than all the labor that was put into the means of production of this item disappears. This is seen when new products make older products obsolete in the economy. One example of this is how Apple made MP3 players obsolete. Once Apple came out with their revolutionary technology the previous MP3 player technology was seen an inferior and lost it value to all consumers in the market. No matter how much money was used in the production and technology cost involved in creating this deceive, the MP3 player was seen as worthless to consumers and thus the MP3 player lost all value. This is furthermore supported in Collins peer reviewed article Expanding the Theory of Labor Value stating that, \u201cIf a new technology allowed it to be made in a simpler fashion, its value would reflect the labor required by the new production process, even if its makers used the old methods\u201d (Collins 106)<ref></ref>. This same premise works in the same way in how new technologies and machines have taken the human jobs away from laborers. New machinery and technology are developed to make production as cheap as possible in order for the company to maximize profit. Once new machinery is developed and takes the place of a physical human job the human, in the same way as the MP3 player, physical human labor losses all value.\n\n===Other works===\n[[File:Adam Smith Grave.JPG|thumb|upright|Smith's burial place in [[Canongate Kirkyard]]|alt=A burial]]\n\nShortly before his death, Smith had nearly all his manuscripts destroyed. In his last years, he seemed to have been planning two major treatises, one on the theory and history of law and one on the sciences and arts. The posthumously published ''Essays on Philosophical Subjects'', a history of [[astronomy]] down to Smith's own era, plus some thoughts on [[ancient physics]] and [[metaphysics]], probably contain parts of what would have been the latter treatise. ''[[Lectures on Jurisprudence]]'' were notes taken from Smith's early lectures, plus an early draft of ''The Wealth of Nations'', published as part of the 1976 Glasgow Edition of the works and correspondence of Smith. Other works, including some published posthumously, include ''Lectures on Justice, Police, Revenue, and Arms'' (1763) (first published in 1896); and ''Essays on Philosophical Subjects'' (1795).<ref>''The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith'', 1982, 6 volumes</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===In economics and moral philosophy===\n''The Wealth of Nations'' was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, Smith expounded how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] writers in the moralising tradition of Hogarth and Swift, as a discussion at the University of Winchester suggests.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=11 February 2010 |url=http://journalism.winchester.ac.uk/?page=343 |title=Adam Smith \u2013 Jonathan Swift |publisher=University of Winchester |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128233435/http://journalism.winchester.ac.uk/?page=343 |archivedate=28 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 2005, ''The Wealth of Nations'' was named among the 100 Best Scottish Books of all time.<ref name=\"100 Best Scottish Books, Adam Smith\">[http://www.list.co.uk/articles/100-best-scottish-books/adam-smith/ 100 Best Scottish Books, Adam Smith] Retrieved 31 January 2012</ref>\n\nIn light of the arguments put forward by Smith and other economic theorists in Britain, academic belief in mercantilism began to decline in Britain in the late 18th century. During the [[Industrial Revolution]], Britain embraced free trade and Smith's ''laissez-faire'' economics, and via the [[British Empire]], used its power to spread a broadly liberal economic model around the world, characterised by open markets, and relatively barrier-free domestic and international trade.<ref>L.Seabrooke (2006). \"Global Standards of Market Civilization\". p. 192. Taylor & Francis 2006</ref>\n\n[[George Stigler]] attributes to Smith \"the most important substantive proposition in all of economics\". It is that, under competition, owners of resources (for example labour, land, and capital) will use them most profitably, resulting in an equal rate of return in [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] for all uses, adjusted for apparent differences arising from such factors as training, trust, hardship, and unemployment.<ref>Stigler, George&nbsp;J.

Had he been more brilliant, he would not have been taken so seriously. Had he dug more deeply, had he unearthed more recondite truth, had he used more difficult and ingenious methods, he would not have been understood. But he had no such ambitions; in fact he disliked whatever went beyond plain common sense. He never moved above the heads of even the dullest readers. He led them on gently, encouraging them by trivialities and homely observations, making them feel comfortable all along.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Schumpeter History of Economic Analysis |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=185}}</ref>\n\nClassical economists presented competing theories of those of Smith, termed the \"[[labour theory of value#The theory's development|labour theory of value]]\". Later Marxian economics descending from classical economics also use Smith's labour theories, in part. The first volume of [[Karl Marx]]'s major work, ''Das Kapital'', was published in German in 1867. In it, Marx focused on the labour theory of value and what he considered to be the exploitation of labour by capital.<ref name=\"Roemer\">[[John Roemer|Roemer, J.E.]] (1987). \"Marxian Value Analysis\".

This contrasts with the modern contention of [[neoclassical economics]], that the value of a thing is determined by what one is willing to give up to obtain the thing.\n\n[[File:Adam Smith Theatre, Bennochy Road, Kirkcaldy.jpg|thumb|The Adam Smith Theatre in [[Kirkcaldy]]|alt=A brown building]]\n\nThe body of theory later termed \"neoclassical economics\" or \"[[marginalism#The Marginal Revolution|marginalism]]\" formed from about 1870 to 1910. The term \"economics\" was popularised by such neoclassical economists as [[Alfred Marshall]] as a concise synonym for \"economic science\" and a substitute for the earlier, broader term \"[[political economy]]\" used by Smith.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Marshall, Alfred |author2=Marshall, Mary Paley |year=1879 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NLcJAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA1#PPA2,M1 |title=The Economics of Industry |page=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Jevons, W.

It dispensed with the [[labour theory of value]] of which Smith was most famously identified with in classical economics, in favour of a [[marginal utility]] theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side.<ref>Campos, Antonietta (1987). \"Marginalist Economics\", ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 3, p. 320</ref>\n\nThe bicentennial anniversary of the publication of ''The Wealth of Nations'' was celebrated in 1976, resulting in increased interest for ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' and his other works throughout academia. After 1976, Smith was more likely to be represented as the author of both ''The Wealth of Nations'' and ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', and thereby as the founder of a moral philosophy and the science of economics. His ''[[homo economicus]]'' or \"economic man\" was also more often represented as a moral person. Additionally, economists David Levy and Sandra Peart in \"The Secret History of the Dismal Science\" point to his opposition to hierarchy and beliefs in inequality, including racial inequality, and provide additional support for those who point to Smith's opposition to slavery, colonialism, and empire. They show the caricatures of Smith drawn by the opponents of views on hierarchy and inequality in this online article. Emphasised also are Smith's statements of the need for high wages for the poor, and the efforts to keep wages low. In The \"Vanity of the Philosopher: From Equality to Hierarchy in Postclassical Economics\", Peart and Levy also cite Smith's view that a common street porter was not intellectually inferior to a philosopher,<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=\u00a7Book I, Chapter 2}}</ref> and point to the need for greater appreciation of the public views in discussions of science and other subjects now considered to be technical. They also cite Smith's opposition to the often expressed view that science is superior to common sense.<ref>\"The Vanity of the Philosopher: From Equality to Hierarchy\" in ''Postclassical Economics'' [http://www.wfu.edu/~hammond/review%20of%20Peart&Levy,%20final.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004085614/http://www.wfu.edu/~hammond/review%20of%20Peart%26Levy%2C%20final.pdf |date=4 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\nSmith also explained the relationship between growth of private property and civil government:\n\n<blockquote>Men may live together in society with some tolerable degree of security, though there is no civil magistrate to protect them from the injustice of those passions. But avarice and ambition in the rich, in the poor the hatred of labour and the love of present ease and enjoyment, are the passions which prompt to invade property, passions much more steady in their operation, and much more universal in their influence. Wherever there is great property there is great inequality. For one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor, and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many. The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and prompted by envy, to invade his possessions. It is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of that valuable property, which is acquired by the labour of many years, or perhaps of many successive generations, can sleep a single night in security. He is at all times surrounded by unknown enemies, whom, though he never provoked, he can never appease, and from whose injustice he can be protected only by the powerful arm of the civil magistrate continually held up to chastise it. The acquisition of valuable and extensive property, therefore, necessarily requires the establishment of civil government. Where there is no property, or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days' labour, civil government is not so necessary. Civil government supposes a certain subordination. But as the necessity of civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable property, so the principal causes which naturally introduce subordination gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable property. (...) Men of inferior wealth combine to defend those of superior wealth in the possession of their property, in order that men of superior wealth may combine to defend them in the possession of theirs. All the inferior shepherds and herdsmen feel that the security of their own herds and flocks depends upon the security of those of the great shepherd or herdsman; that the maintenance of their lesser authority depends upon that of his greater authority, and that upon their subordination to him depends his power of keeping their inferiors in subordination to them. They constitute a sort of little nobility, who feel themselves interested to defend the property and to support the authority of their own little sovereign in order that he may be able to defend their property and to support their authority. Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all.

''The Wealth of Nations'' would become an ambiguous text regarding the imperial question. In his chapter on colonies, Smith pondered how to solve the crisis developing across the Atlantic among the empire's 13 American colonies. He offered two different proposals for easing tensions. The first proposal called for giving the colonies their independence, and by thus parting on a friendly basis, Britain would be able to develop and maintain a free-trade relationship with them, and possibly even an informal military alliance. Smith's second proposal called for a theoretical imperial federation that would bring the colonies and the metropole closer together through an imperial parliamentary system and imperial free trade.<ref>E.A. Benians, \u2018Adam Smith\u2019s project of an empire\u2019, ''Cambridge Historical Journal'' 1 (1925): 249\u201383</ref>\n\nSmith's most prominent disciple in 19th-century Britain, peace advocate [[Richard Cobden]], preferred the first proposal. Cobden would lead the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] in overturning the [[Corn Laws]] in 1846, shifting Britain to a policy of free trade and empire \"on the cheap\" for decades to come. This hands-off approach toward the British Empire would become known as [[Cobdenism]] or the [[Manchester Liberalism|Manchester School]].<ref>Anthony Howe, ''Free trade and liberal England, 1846\u20131946'' (Oxford, 1997)</ref> By the turn of the century, however, advocates of Smith's second proposal such as [[Joseph Shield Nicholson]] would become ever more vocal in opposing Cobdenism, calling instead for imperial federation.<ref>J. Shield Nicholson, ''A project of empire: a critical study of the economics of imperialism, with special reference to the ideas of Adam Smith'' (London, 1909)</ref> As Marc-William Palen notes: \"On the one hand, Adam Smith\u2019s late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Cobdenite adherents used his theories to argue for gradual imperial devolution and empire \u2018on the cheap\u2019.

[[Herbert Stein]] wrote that the people who \"wear an Adam Smith necktie\" do it to \"make a statement of their devotion to the idea of free markets and [[limited government]]\", and that this misrepresents Smith's ideas. Stein writes that Smith \"was not pure or doctrinaire about this idea. He viewed government intervention in the market with great skepticism...yet he was prepared to accept or propose qualifications to that policy in the specific cases where he judged that their net effect would be beneficial and would not undermine the basically free character of the system. He did not wear the Adam Smith necktie.\" In Stein's reading, ''The Wealth of Nations'' could justify the [[Food and Drug Administration]], the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]], mandatory employer health benefits, environmentalism, and \"[[Pigovian tax|discriminatory taxation]] to deter [[sin tax|improper]] or [[sumptuary tax|luxurious behavior]]\".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stein, Herbert |date=6 April 1994 |title=Board of Contributors: Remembering Adam Smith |journal=[[The Wall Street Journal Asia]] |page=A14}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, Vivienne Brown stated in ''[[The Economic Journal]]'' that in the 20th-century United States, [[Reaganomics]] supporters, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', and other similar sources have spread among the general public a partial and misleading vision of Smith, portraying him as an \"extreme dogmatic defender of ''laissez-faire'' capitalism and [[supply-side economics]]\".<ref name=\"Brown93\">{{cite journal |author=Brown, Vivienne |date=January 1993 |journal=[[The Economic Journal]] |volume=103 |issue=416 |pages=230\u201332 |doi=10.2307/2234351 |title=Untitled review of 'Capitalism as a Moral System: Adam Smith's Critique of the Free Market Economy' and 'Adam Smith and his Legacy for Modern Capitalism' |last2=Pack |first2=Spencer J. |last3=Werhane |first3=Patricia H. |jstor=2234351}}</ref> In fact, ''The Wealth of Nations'' includes the following statement on the payment of taxes:\n\n<blockquote>The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state.<ref name=\"Smith 1977 loc=bk. V, ch. 2\">{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=bk. V, ch. 2}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nSome commentators have argued that Smith's works show support for a progressive, not flat, income tax and that he specifically named taxes that he thought should be required by the state, among them [[Luxury tax|luxury-goods taxes]] and tax on rent.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/10/18/101018crbo_books_gopnik |title=Market Man |date=18 October 2010 |work=The New Yorker}}</ref> Yet Smith argued for the \"impossibility of taxing the people, in proportion to their economic revenue, by any capitation\" (''The Wealth of Nations,'' V.ii.k.1). Smith argued that taxes should principally go toward protecting \"justice\" and \"certain publick institutions\" that were necessary for the benefit of all of society, but that could not be provided by private enterprise (''The Wealth of Nations,'' IV.ix.51).\n\nAdditionally, Smith outlined the proper expenses of the government in ''The Wealth of Nations, Book V, Ch. I''. Included in his requirements of a government is to enforce contracts and provide justice system, grant patents and copy rights, provide public goods such as infrastructure, provide national defence, and regulate banking. The role of the government was to provide goods \"of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual\" such as roads, bridges, canals, and harbours. He also encouraged invention and new ideas through his patent enforcement and support of infant industry monopolies. He supported partial public subsidies for elementary education, and he believed that competition among religious institutions would provide general benefit to the society. In such cases, however, Smith argued for local rather than centralised control: \"Even those publick works which are of such a nature that they cannot afford any revenue for maintaining themselves ... are always better maintained by a local or provincial revenue, under the management of a local and provincial administration, than by the general revenue of the state\" (''Wealth of Nations,'' V.i.d.18). Finally, he outlined how the government should support the dignity of the monarch or chief magistrate, such that they are equal or above the public in fashion. He even states that monarchs should be provided for in a greater fashion than magistrates of a republic because \"we naturally expect more splendor in the court of a king than in the mansion-house of a [[doge]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=bk. V}}</ref> In addition, he allowed that in some specific circumstances, retaliatory tariffs may be beneficial:\n\n<blockquote>The recovery of a great foreign market will generally more than compensate the transitory inconvenience of paying dearer during a short time for some sorts of goods.<ref>Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, p. 468.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, he added that in general, a retaliatory tariff \"seems a bad method of compensating the injury done to certain classes of our people, to do another injury ourselves, not only to those classes, but to almost all the other classes of them\" (''The Wealth of Nations,'' IV.ii.39).\n\n[[Economic historian]]s such as [[Jacob Viner]] regard Smith as a strong advocate of free markets and limited government (what Smith called \"natural liberty\"), but not as a dogmatic supporter of ''laissez-faire''.<ref name=\"Viner 1927\">{{cite journal |author=Viner, Jacob |date=April 1927 |journal=[[The Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=198\u2013232 |doi=10.1086/253837 |title=Adam Smith and Laissez-faire |jstor=1823421}}</ref>\n\nEconomist [[Daniel B. Klein|Daniel Klein]] believes using the term \"free-market economics\" or \"free-market economist\" to identify the ideas of Smith is too general and slightly misleading.

Most people still fall victim to the thinking that Smith was a free-market economist without exception, though he was not. Ricardo pointed out that Smith was in support of helping infant industries. Smith believed that the government should subsidise newly formed industry, but he did fear that when the infant industry grew into adulthood, it would be unwilling to surrender the government help.<ref name=\"New Ideas From Dead Economists\">Buchholz, Todd (December 1990). pp. 38\u201339.</ref> Smith also supported tariffs on imported goods to counteract an internal tax on the same good. Smith also fell to pressure in supporting some tariffs in support for national defence.<ref name=\"New Ideas From Dead Economists\"/>\n\nSome have also claimed, [[Emma Rothschild]] among them, that Smith would have supported a minimum wage,<ref>Martin, Christopher. \"Adam Smith and Liberal Economics: Reading the Minimum Wage Debate of 1795\u201396,\" ''Econ Journal Watch'' 8(2): 110\u201325, May 2011 [http://econjwatch.org/articles/adam-smith-and-liberal-economics-reading-the-minimum-wage-debate-of-1795-96] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228230820/http://econjwatch.org/articles/adam-smith-and-liberal-economics-reading-the-minimum-wage-debate-of-1795-96 |date=28 December 2013 }}</ref> although no direct textual evidence supports the claim. Indeed, Smith wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The price of labour, it must be observed, cannot be ascertained very accurately anywhere, different prices being often paid at the same place and for the same sort of labour, not only according to the different abilities of the workmen, but according to the easiness or hardness of the masters. Where wages are not regulated by law, all that we can pretend to determine is what are the most usual; and experience seems to show that law can never regulate them properly, though it has often pretended to do so. (''The Wealth of Nations'', Book 1, Chapter 8)</blockquote>\n\nHowever, Smith also noted, to the contrary, the existence of an [[equality of bargaining power|imbalanced, inequality of bargaining power]]:<ref>A Smith, ''Wealth of Nations'' (1776) Book I, ch 8</ref>\n<blockquote>A landlord, a farmer, a master manufacturer, a merchant, though they did not employ a single workman, could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they have already acquired. Many workmen could not subsist a week, few could subsist a month, and scarce any a year without employment. In the long run, the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him, but the necessity is not so immediate.</blockquote>\n\n===Criticism===\n\n[[Alfred Marshall]] criticised Smith's definition of the economy on several points. He argued that man should be equally important as money, services are as important as goods, and that there must be an emphasis on human welfare, instead of just wealth. The \"invisible hand\" only works well when both production and consumption operates in free markets, with small (\"atomistic\") producers and consumers allowing supply and demand to fluctuate and equilibrate. In conditions of monopoly and oligopoly, the \"invisible hand\" fails.\n\nNobel Prize-winning economist [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]] says, on the topic of one of Smith's better-known ideas: \"the reason that the [[invisible hand]] often seems invisible is that it is often not there.\"<ref>''The Roaring Nineties'', 2006</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Organizational capital]]\n* [[List of abolitionist forerunners]]\n* [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society of Arts]]\n* [[List of people on banknotes#Scotland|People on Scottish banknotes]]\n\n==References==\n===Informational notes===\n{{notelist}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|refs=\n}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S1474691300001062|title=II.

into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776). The latter, often abbreviated as ''The Wealth of Nations'', is considered his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' and the first modern work of economics.

Smith obtained a professorship at Glasgow, teaching moral philosophy and during this time, wrote and published ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments''. In his later life, he took a tutoring position that allowed him to travel throughout Europe, where he met other intellectual leaders of his day.\n\nSmith laid the foundations of classical [[free market]] economic theory. ''The Wealth of Nations'' was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, he developed the concept of [[Division of labour#Adam Smith|division of labour]] and expounded upon how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by writers such as [[Horace Walpole]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=John |first1=McMurray |title=Capitalism's 'Founding Father' Often Quoted, Frequently Misconstrued |url=https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/capitalisms-founding-father-often-quoted-frequently-misconstrued/ |website=Investor.com |accessdate=31 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\n\nSmith was born in [[Kirkcaldy]], in the [[Kingdom of Fife]], Scotland.

But presently a gentleman arrived who had met a Romani woman a few miles down the road carrying a child that was crying piteously. Scouts were immediately dispatched in the direction indicated, and they came upon the woman in Leslie wood. As soon as she saw them she threw her burden down and escaped, and the child was brought back to his mother. [Smith] would have made, I fear, a poor gypsy.\"<ref name=\"rae 1895 5\" />}} Smith was close to his mother, who probably encouraged him to pursue his scholarly ambitions.<ref name=\"Bussing-Burks 2003 39\">{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|p=39}}</ref> He attended the [[Burgh School of Kirkcaldy]]\u2014characterised by Rae as \"one of the best secondary schools of Scotland at that period\"<ref name=\"rae 1895 5\">{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=5}}</ref>\u2014from 1729 to 1737, he learned [[Latin]], mathematics, history, and writing.<ref name=\"Bussing-Burks 2003 39\"/>\n\n===Formal education===\n\nSmith entered the [[University of Glasgow]] when he was 14 and studied moral philosophy under [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]].<ref name=\"Bussing-Burks 2003 39\"/> Here, Smith developed his passion for [[liberty]], [[reason]], and [[free speech]]. In 1740, Smith was the graduate scholar presented to undertake postgraduate studies at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], under the [[Snell Exhibition]].<ref>{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=22}}</ref>\n\nSmith considered the teaching at Glasgow to be far superior to that at Oxford, which he found intellectually stifling.<ref name=\"Bussing-Burks 2003 41\">{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|p=41}}</ref> In Book V, Chapter II of ''The Wealth of Nations'', Smith wrote: \"In the University of Oxford, the greater part of the public professors have, for these many years, given up altogether even the pretence of teaching.\"\nSmith is also reported to have complained to friends that Oxford officials once discovered him reading a copy of David Hume's ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'', and they subsequently confiscated his book and punished him severely for reading it.<ref name=\"rae 1895 5\" /><ref name=\"rae 1895 24\">{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=24}}</ref><ref name=\"Buchholz 1999 12\">{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=12}}</ref> According to William Robert Scott, \"The Oxford of [Smith's] time gave little if any help towards what was to be his lifework.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Introductory Economics |publisher=New Age Publishers |isbn=81-224-1830-9 |page=4|date=December 2006 }}</ref> Nevertheless, Smith took the opportunity while at Oxford to teach himself several subjects by reading many books from the shelves of the large [[Bodleian Library]].<ref name=\"rae 1895 22\">{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=22}}</ref> When Smith was not studying on his own, his time at Oxford was not a happy one, according to his letters.<ref name=\"rae 1895 24\u201325\">{{harvnb|Rae|1895|pp=24\u201325}}</ref> Near the end of his time there, Smith began suffering from shaking fits, probably the symptoms of a nervous breakdown.<ref name=\"Bussing-Burks 2003 42\">{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|p=42}}</ref> He left Oxford University in 1746, before his scholarship ended.<ref name=\"Bussing-Burks 2003 42\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=29}}</ref>\n\nIn Book V of ''The Wealth of Nations'', Smith comments on the low quality of instruction and the meager intellectual activity at [[List of universities in England|English universities]], when compared to their Scottish counterparts. He attributes this both to the rich endowments of the colleges at Oxford and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], which made the income of professors independent of their ability to attract students, and to the fact that distinguished [[Intellectual#Man of Letters|men of letters]] could make an even more comfortable living as ministers of the [[Church of England]].<ref name=\"Buchholz 1999 12\" />\n\nSmith's discontent at Oxford might be in part due to the absence of his beloved teacher in Glasgow, Francis Hutcheson, who was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the University of Glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students, colleagues, and even ordinary residents with the fervor and earnestness of his orations (which he sometimes opened to the public). His lectures endeavoured not merely to teach philosophy, but also to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives, appropriately acquiring the epithet, the preacher of philosophy.

Smith proposes a theory of sympathy, in which the act of observing others and seeing the judgements they form of both others and oneself makes people aware of themselves and how others perceive their behaviour. The feedback we receive from perceiving (or imagining) others' judgment creates an incentive to achieve \"mutual sympathy of sentiments\" with them and leads people to develop habits, and then principles, of behaviour, which come to constitute one's conscience.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|2002|p=xv}}</ref>\n\nSome scholars have perceived a conflict between ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' and ''The Wealth of Nations''; the former emphasises sympathy for others, while the latter focuses on the role of self-interest.<ref>{{harvnb|Viner|1991|p=250}}</ref> In recent years, however, some scholars<ref>Wight, Jonathan B.

They claim that in ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', Smith develops a theory of psychology in which individuals seek the approval of the \"impartial spectator\" as a result of a natural desire to have outside observers sympathise with their sentiments. Rather than viewing ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' and ''The Wealth of Nations'' as presenting incompatible views of human nature, some Smith scholars regard the works as emphasising different aspects of human nature that vary depending on the situation. [[James Otteson|Otteson]] argues that both books are Newtonian in their methodology and deploy a similar \"market model\" for explaining the creation and development of large-scale human social orders, including morality, economics, as well as language.<ref>Otteson, James R. 2002, ''Adam Smith's Marketplace of Life''.

He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it.</blockquote>\n\nThose who regard that statement as Smith's central message also quote frequently Smith's dictum:<ref>Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, pp. 26\u201327.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages.</blockquote>However, in ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' he had a more sceptical approach to self-interest as driver of behaviour:<blockquote>How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it.</blockquote>[[File:Wealth of Nations.jpg|thumb|upright|The first page of ''The Wealth of Nations'', 1776 London edition|alt=The first page of a book]]\nSmith's statement about the benefits of \"an invisible hand\" may be meant to answer{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} [[Bernard Mandeville|Mandeville's]] contention that \"Private Vices ... may be turned into Public Benefits\".<ref>Mandeville, B., 1724, ''The Fable of the Bees'', London: Tonson.</ref> It shows Smith's belief that when an individual pursues his self-interest under conditions of justice, he unintentionally promotes the good of society. Self-interested competition in the free market, he argued, would tend to benefit society as a whole by keeping prices low, while still building in an incentive for a wide variety of goods and services. Nevertheless, he was wary of businessmen and warned of their \"conspiracy against the public or in some other contrivance to raise prices\".<ref>Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, pp. 145, 158.</ref> Again and again, Smith warned of the collusive nature of business interests, which may form cabals or [[Monopoly|monopolies]], fixing the highest price \"which can be squeezed out of the buyers\".<ref>Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, p. 79.</ref> Smith also warned that a business-dominated political system would allow a conspiracy of businesses and industry against consumers, with the former scheming to influence politics and legislation. Smith states that the interest of manufacturers and merchants \"in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public ... The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gopnik |first=Adam |title=Market Man |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |issue=18 October 2010 |page=82 |url=https://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/10/18/101018crbo_books_gopnik |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> Thus Smith's chief worry seems to be when business is given special protections or privileges from government; by contrast, in the absence of such special political favours, he believed that business activities were generally beneficial to the whole society:\n\n<blockquote>It is the great multiplication of the production of all the different arts, in consequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a well-governed society, that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people. Every workman has a great quantity of his own work to dispose of beyond what he himself has occasion for; and every other workman being exactly in the same situation, he is enabled to exchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great quantity, or, what comes to the same thing, for the price of a great quantity of theirs. He supplies them abundantly with what they have occasion for, and they accommodate him as amply with what he has occasion for, and a general plenty diffuses itself through all the different ranks of society. (''The Wealth of Nations,'' I.i.10)</blockquote>\n\nThe neoclassical interest in Smith's statement about \"an invisible hand\" originates in the possibility of seeing it as a precursor of [[neoclassical economics]] and its concept of [[General equilibrium theory|general equilibrium]] \u2013 [[Paul Samuelson|Samuelson's]] \"Economics\" refers six times to Smith's \"invisible hand\". To emphasise this connection, Samuelson<ref>Samuelson, P.&nbsp;A./Nordhaus, William&nbsp;D., 1989, ''Economics'', 13th edition, N.Y. et al.: McGraw-Hill, p. 825.</ref> quotes Smith's \"invisible hand\" statement substituting \"general interest\" for \"public interest\". Samuelson<ref>Samuelson, P.&nbsp;A./Nordhaus, William&nbsp;D., 1989, idem, p. 825.</ref> concludes: \"Smith was unable to prove the essence of his invisible-hand doctrine. Indeed, until the 1940s, no one knew how to prove, even to state properly, the kernel of truth in this proposition about perfectly competitive market.\"\n\n[[File:Smith - Inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations, 1922 - 5231847.tif|thumb|170px|1922 printing of ''An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations'']]\nVery differently, classical economists see in Smith's first sentences his programme to promote \"The Wealth of Nations\". Using the physiocratical concept of the economy as a circular process, to secure growth the inputs of Period 2 must exceed the inputs of Period 1. Therefore, those outputs of Period 1 which are not used or usable as inputs of Period 2 are regarded as unproductive labour, as they do not contribute to growth. This is what Smith had heard in France from, among others, [[Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay]], whose ideas Smith was so impressed by that he might have dedicated ''The Wealth of Nations'' to him had he not died beforehand.<ref>{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=80}}</ref><ref>Stewart, D., 1799, ''Essays on Philosophical Subjects, to which is prefixed An Account of the Life and Writings of the Author by Dugald Steward, F.R.S.E.'', Basil; from the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Read by M. Steward, 21 January, and 18 March 1793; in: The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith, 1982, vol. 3, pp. 304 ff.</ref> To this French insight that unproductive labour should be reduced to use labour more productively, Smith added his own proposal, that productive labour should be made even more productive by deepening the [[division of labour]]. Smith argued that deepening the division of labour under competition leads to greater productivity, which leads to lower prices and thus an increasing standard of living\u2014\"general plenty\" and \"universal opulence\"\u2014for all. Extended markets and increased production lead to the continuous reorganisation of production and the invention of new ways of producing, which in turn lead to further increased production, lower prices, and improved standards of living. Smith's central message is, therefore, that under dynamic competition, a growth machine secures \"The Wealth of Nations\". Smith's argument predicted Britain's evolution as the workshop of the world, underselling and outproducing all its competitors. The opening sentences of the \"Wealth of Nations\" summarise this policy:\n\n<blockquote>The annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annually consumes ... . [T]his produce ... bears a greater or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to consume it ... .[B]ut this proportion must in every nation be regulated by two different circumstances;\n* first, by the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which its labour is generally applied; and,\n* secondly, by the proportion between the number of those who are employed in useful labour, and that of those who are not so employed [emphasis added].<ref>Smith, A., 1976, vol. 2a, p. 10, idem</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, Smith added that the \"abundance or scantiness of this supply too seems to depend more upon the former of those two circumstances than upon the latter.\"<ref>Smith, A., 1976, vol. 1, p. 10, para. 4</ref>\n\n===Other works===\n[[File:Adam Smith Grave.JPG|thumb|upright|Smith's burial place in [[Canongate Kirkyard]]|alt=A burial]]\n\nShortly before his death, Smith had nearly all his manuscripts destroyed. In his last years, he seemed to have been planning two major treatises, one on the theory and history of law and one on the sciences and arts. The posthumously published ''Essays on Philosophical Subjects'', a history of [[astronomy]] down to Smith's own era, plus some thoughts on [[ancient physics]] and [[metaphysics]], probably contain parts of what would have been the latter treatise. ''[[Lectures on Jurisprudence]]'' were notes taken from Smith's early lectures, plus an early draft of ''The Wealth of Nations'', published as part of the 1976 Glasgow Edition of the works and correspondence of Smith. Other works, including some published posthumously, include ''Lectures on Justice, Police, Revenue, and Arms'' (1763) (first published in 1896); and ''Essays on Philosophical Subjects'' (1795).<ref>''The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith'', 1982, 6 volumes</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===In economics and moral philosophy===\n''The Wealth of Nations'' was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, Smith expounded how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] writers in the moralising tradition of Hogarth and Swift, as a discussion at the University of Winchester suggests.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=11 February 2010 |url=http://journalism.winchester.ac.uk/?page=343 |title=Adam Smith \u2013 Jonathan Swift |publisher=University of Winchester |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128233435/http://journalism.winchester.ac.uk/?page=343 |archivedate=28 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 2005, ''The Wealth of Nations'' was named among the 100 Best Scottish Books of all time.<ref name=\"100 Best Scottish Books, Adam Smith\">[http://www.list.co.uk/articles/100-best-scottish-books/adam-smith/ 100 Best Scottish Books, Adam Smith] Retrieved 31 January 2012</ref>\n\nIn light of the arguments put forward by Smith and other economic theorists in Britain, academic belief in mercantilism began to decline in Britain in the late 18th century. During the [[Industrial Revolution]], Britain embraced free trade and Smith's ''laissez-faire'' economics, and via the [[British Empire]], used its power to spread a broadly liberal economic model around the world, characterised by open markets, and relatively barrier-free domestic and international trade.<ref>L.Seabrooke (2006). \"Global Standards of Market Civilization\". p. 192. Taylor & Francis 2006</ref>\n\n[[George Stigler]] attributes to Smith \"the most important substantive proposition in all of economics\". It is that, under competition, owners of resources (for example labour, land, and capital) will use them most profitably, resulting in an equal rate of return in [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] for all uses, adjusted for apparent differences arising from such factors as training, trust, hardship, and unemployment.<ref>Stigler, George&nbsp;J.

Had he been more brilliant, he would not have been taken so seriously. Had he dug more deeply, had he unearthed more recondite truth, had he used more difficult and ingenious methods, he would not have been understood. But he had no such ambitions; in fact he disliked whatever went beyond plain common sense. He never moved above the heads of even the dullest readers. He led them on gently, encouraging them by trivialities and homely observations, making them feel comfortable all along.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Schumpeter History of Economic Analysis |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=185}}</ref>\n\nClassical economists presented competing theories of those of Smith, termed the \"[[labour theory of value#The theory's development|labour theory of value]]\". Later Marxian economics descending from classical economics also use Smith's labour theories, in part. The first volume of [[Karl Marx]]'s major work, ''Das Kapital'', was published in German in 1867. In it, Marx focused on the labour theory of value and what he considered to be the exploitation of labour by capital.<ref name=\"Roemer\">[[John Roemer|Roemer, J.E.]] (1987). \"Marxian Value Analysis\". ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 3, 383.</ref><ref>[[Ernest Mandel|Mandel, Ernest]] (1987). \"Marx, Karl Heinrich\", ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'' v. 3, pp. 372, 376.</ref> The labour theory of value held that the value of a thing was determined by the labour that went into its production. This contrasts with the modern contention of [[neoclassical economics]], that the value of a thing is determined by what one is willing to give up to obtain the thing.\n\n[[File:Adam Smith Theatre, Bennochy Road, Kirkcaldy.jpg|thumb|The Adam Smith Theatre in [[Kirkcaldy]]|alt=A brown building]]\n\nThe body of theory later termed \"neoclassical economics\" or \"[[marginalism#The Marginal Revolution|marginalism]]\" formed from about 1870 to 1910. The term \"economics\" was popularised by such neoclassical economists as [[Alfred Marshall]] as a concise synonym for \"economic science\" and a substitute for the earlier, broader term \"[[political economy]]\" used by Smith.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Marshall, Alfred |author2=Marshall, Mary Paley |year=1879 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NLcJAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA1#PPA2,M1 |title=The Economics of Industry |page=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Jevons, W.

(1998). ''Political-economy: A comparative approach'', 2nd ed., Westport, CT: Praeger. p. 32.</ref> Neoclassical economics systematised [[supply and demand]] as joint determinants of price and quantity in market equilibrium, affecting both the allocation of output and the distribution of income. It dispensed with the [[labour theory of value]] of which Smith was most famously identified with in classical economics, in favour of a [[marginal utility]] theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side.<ref>Campos, Antonietta (1987). \"Marginalist Economics\", ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 3, p. 320</ref>\n\nThe bicentennial anniversary of the publication of ''The Wealth of Nations'' was celebrated in 1976, resulting in increased interest for ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' and his other works throughout academia. After 1976, Smith was more likely to be represented as the author of both ''The Wealth of Nations'' and ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', and thereby as the founder of a moral philosophy and the science of economics. His ''[[homo economicus]]'' or \"economic man\" was also more often represented as a moral person. Additionally, economists David Levy and Sandra Peart in \"The Secret History of the Dismal Science\" point to his opposition to hierarchy and beliefs in inequality, including racial inequality, and provide additional support for those who point to Smith's opposition to slavery, colonialism, and empire. They show the caricatures of Smith drawn by the opponents of views on hierarchy and inequality in this online article. Emphasised also are Smith's statements of the need for high wages for the poor, and the efforts to keep wages low. In The \"Vanity of the Philosopher: From Equality to Hierarchy in Postclassical Economics\", Peart and Levy also cite Smith's view that a common street porter was not intellectually inferior to a philosopher,<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=\u00a7Book I, Chapter 2}}</ref> and point to the need for greater appreciation of the public views in discussions of science and other subjects now considered to be technical. They also cite Smith's opposition to the often expressed view that science is superior to common sense.<ref>\"The Vanity of the Philosopher: From Equality to Hierarchy\" in ''Postclassical Economics'' [http://www.wfu.edu/~hammond/review%20of%20Peart&Levy,%20final.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004085614/http://www.wfu.edu/~hammond/review%20of%20Peart%26Levy%2C%20final.pdf |date=4 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\nSmith also explained the relationship between growth of private property and civil government:\n\n<blockquote>Men may live together in society with some tolerable degree of security, though there is no civil magistrate to protect them from the injustice of those passions. But avarice and ambition in the rich, in the poor the hatred of labour and the love of present ease and enjoyment, are the passions which prompt to invade property, passions much more steady in their operation, and much more universal in their influence. Wherever there is great property there is great inequality. For one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor, and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many. The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and prompted by envy, to invade his possessions. It is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of that valuable property, which is acquired by the labour of many years, or perhaps of many successive generations, can sleep a single night in security. He is at all times surrounded by unknown enemies, whom, though he never provoked, he can never appease, and from whose injustice he can be protected only by the powerful arm of the civil magistrate continually held up to chastise it. The acquisition of valuable and extensive property, therefore, necessarily requires the establishment of civil government. Where there is no property, or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days' labour, civil government is not so necessary. Civil government supposes a certain subordination. But as the necessity of civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable property, so the principal causes which naturally introduce subordination gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable property. (...) Men of inferior wealth combine to defend those of superior wealth in the possession of their property, in order that men of superior wealth may combine to defend them in the possession of theirs. All the inferior shepherds and herdsmen feel that the security of their own herds and flocks depends upon the security of those of the great shepherd or herdsman; that the maintenance of their lesser authority depends upon that of his greater authority, and that upon their subordination to him depends his power of keeping their inferiors in subordination to them. They constitute a sort of little nobility, who feel themselves interested to defend the property and to support the authority of their own little sovereign in order that he may be able to defend their property and to support their authority. Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all. (Source: ''The Wealth of Nations'', Book 5, Chapter 1, Part 2)</blockquote>\n\n===In British Imperial debates===\nSmith's chapter on colonies, in turn, would help shape British imperial debates from the mid-19th century onward. ''The Wealth of Nations'' would become an ambiguous text regarding the imperial question. In his chapter on colonies, Smith pondered how to solve the crisis developing across the Atlantic among the empire's 13 American colonies. He offered two different proposals for easing tensions. The first proposal called for giving the colonies their independence, and by thus parting on a friendly basis, Britain would be able to develop and maintain a free-trade relationship with them, and possibly even an informal military alliance. Smith's second proposal called for a theoretical imperial federation that would bring the colonies and the metropole closer together through an imperial parliamentary system and imperial free trade.<ref>E.A. Benians, \u2018Adam Smith\u2019s project of an empire\u2019, ''Cambridge Historical Journal'' 1 (1925): 249\u201383</ref>\n\nSmith's most prominent disciple in 19th-century Britain, peace advocate [[Richard Cobden]], preferred the first proposal. Cobden would lead the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] in overturning the [[Corn Laws]] in 1846, shifting Britain to a policy of free trade and empire \"on the cheap\" for decades to come. This hands-off approach toward the British Empire would become known as [[Cobdenism]] or the [[Manchester Liberalism|Manchester School]].<ref>Anthony Howe, ''Free trade and liberal England, 1846\u20131946'' (Oxford, 1997)</ref> By the turn of the century, however, advocates of Smith's second proposal such as [[Joseph Shield Nicholson]] would become ever more vocal in opposing Cobdenism, calling instead for imperial federation.<ref>J. Shield Nicholson, ''A project of empire: a critical study of the economics of imperialism, with special reference to the ideas of Adam Smith'' (London, 1909)</ref> As Marc-William Palen notes: \"On the one hand, Adam Smith\u2019s late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Cobdenite adherents used his theories to argue for gradual imperial devolution and empire \u2018on the cheap\u2019. On the other, various proponents of imperial federation throughout the British World sought to use Smith's theories to overturn the predominant Cobdenite hands-off imperial approach and instead, with a firm grip, bring the empire closer than ever before.\"<ref>Marc-William Palen, [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=9159669&fileId=S0018246X13000101 \u201cAdam Smith as Advocate of Empire, c. 1870\u20131932,\u201d] ''Historical Journal'' 57: 1 (March 2014): 179\u201398.</ref> Smith's ideas thus played an important part in subsequent debates over the British Empire.\n\n===Portraits, monuments, and banknotes===\n[[File:Adam Smith statue by Alexander Stoddart.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A statue of Smith in [[Edinburgh]]'s High Street, erected through private donations organised by the Adam Smith Institute]]\n\nSmith has been commemorated in the UK on banknotes printed by two different banks; his portrait has appeared since 1981 on the [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]50 notes issued by the [[Clydesdale Bank]] in Scotland,<ref name=\"clydesdale\">{{cite web|url=http://aes.iupui.edu/rwise/banknotes/scotland/ScotlandP209-50Pounds-1981-donatedowl_f.jpg |title=Clydesdale 50 Pounds, 1981 |publisher=Ron Wise's Banknoteworld |accessdate=15 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030185820/http://aes.iupui.edu/rwise/banknotes/scotland/ScotlandP209-50Pounds-1981-donatedowl_f.jpg |archivedate=30 October 2008 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref><ref name=\"scotbanks\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scotbanks.org.uk/banknotes_current_clydesdale_bank.php |title=Current Banknotes : Clydesdale Bank |publisher=The Committee of Scottish Clearing Bankers |accessdate=15 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003071439/http://www.scotbanks.org.uk/banknotes_current_clydesdale_bank.php |archivedate=3 October 2008 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> and in March 2007 Smith's image also appeared on the new series of [[Bank of England \u00a320 note|\u00a320 notes]] issued by the [[Bank of England]], making him the first Scotsman to feature on an [[Bank of England note issues|English banknote]].<ref name=\"bbc1\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6096938.stm |title=Smith replaces Elgar on \u00a320 note |accessdate=14 May 2008 |publisher=BBC |date=29 October 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324062831/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6096938.stm |archivedate=24 March 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:6 Burlington Gardens facade Smith.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Statue of Smith built in 1867\u20131870 at the old headquarters of the [[University of London]], 6 Burlington Gardens]]\n\nA large-scale memorial of Smith by [[Alexander Stoddart]] was unveiled on 4 July 2008 in Edinburgh.

[[Herbert Stein]] wrote that the people who \"wear an Adam Smith necktie\" do it to \"make a statement of their devotion to the idea of free markets and [[limited government]]\", and that this misrepresents Smith's ideas. Stein writes that Smith \"was not pure or doctrinaire about this idea. He viewed government intervention in the market with great skepticism...yet he was prepared to accept or propose qualifications to that policy in the specific cases where he judged that their net effect would be beneficial and would not undermine the basically free character of the system. He did not wear the Adam Smith necktie.\" In Stein's reading, ''The Wealth of Nations'' could justify the [[Food and Drug Administration]], the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]], mandatory employer health benefits, environmentalism, and \"[[Pigovian tax|discriminatory taxation]] to deter [[sin tax|improper]] or [[sumptuary tax|luxurious behavior]]\".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stein, Herbert |date=6 April 1994 |title=Board of Contributors: Remembering Adam Smith |journal=[[The Wall Street Journal Asia]] |page=A14}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, Vivienne Brown stated in ''[[The Economic Journal]]'' that in the 20th-century United States, [[Reaganomics]] supporters, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', and other similar sources have spread among the general public a partial and misleading vision of Smith, portraying him as an \"extreme dogmatic defender of ''laissez-faire'' capitalism and [[supply-side economics]]\".<ref name=\"Brown93\">{{cite journal |author=Brown, Vivienne |date=January 1993 |journal=[[The Economic Journal]] |volume=103 |issue=416 |pages=230\u201332 |doi=10.2307/2234351 |title=Untitled review of 'Capitalism as a Moral System: Adam Smith's Critique of the Free Market Economy' and 'Adam Smith and his Legacy for Modern Capitalism' |last2=Pack |first2=Spencer J. |last3=Werhane |first3=Patricia H. |jstor=2234351}}</ref> In fact, ''The Wealth of Nations'' includes the following statement on the payment of taxes:\n\n<blockquote>The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state.<ref name=\"Smith 1977 loc=bk. V, ch. 2\">{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=bk. V, ch. 2}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nSome commentators have argued that Smith's works show support for a progressive, not flat, income tax and that he specifically named taxes that he thought should be required by the state, among them [[Luxury tax|luxury-goods taxes]] and tax on rent.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/10/18/101018crbo_books_gopnik |title=Market Man |date=18 October 2010 |work=The New Yorker}}</ref> Yet Smith argued for the \"impossibility of taxing the people, in proportion to their economic revenue, by any capitation\" (''The Wealth of Nations,'' V.ii.k.1). Smith argued that taxes should principally go toward protecting \"justice\" and \"certain publick institutions\" that were necessary for the benefit of all of society, but that could not be provided by private enterprise (''The Wealth of Nations,'' IV.ix.51).\n\nAdditionally, Smith outlined the proper expenses of the government in ''The Wealth of Nations, Book V, Ch. I''. Included in his requirements of a government is to enforce contracts and provide justice system, grant patents and copy rights, provide public goods such as infrastructure, provide national defence, and regulate banking. The role of the government was to provide goods \"of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual\" such as roads, bridges, canals, and harbours. He also encouraged invention and new ideas through his patent enforcement and support of infant industry monopolies. He supported partial public subsidies for elementary education, and he believed that competition among religious institutions would provide general benefit to the society. In such cases, however, Smith argued for local rather than centralised control: \"Even those publick works which are of such a nature that they cannot afford any revenue for maintaining themselves ... are always better maintained by a local or provincial revenue, under the management of a local and provincial administration, than by the general revenue of the state\" (''Wealth of Nations,'' V.i.d.18). Finally, he outlined how the government should support the dignity of the monarch or chief magistrate, such that they are equal or above the public in fashion. He even states that monarchs should be provided for in a greater fashion than magistrates of a republic because \"we naturally expect more splendor in the court of a king than in the mansion-house of a [[doge]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=bk. V}}</ref> In addition, he allowed that in some specific circumstances, retaliatory tariffs may be beneficial:\n\n<blockquote>The recovery of a great foreign market will generally more than compensate the transitory inconvenience of paying dearer during a short time for some sorts of goods.<ref>Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, p. 468.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, he added that in general, a retaliatory tariff \"seems a bad method of compensating the injury done to certain classes of our people, to do another injury ourselves, not only to those classes, but to almost all the other classes of them\" (''The Wealth of Nations,'' IV.ii.39).\n\n[[Economic historian]]s such as [[Jacob Viner]] regard Smith as a strong advocate of free markets and limited government (what Smith called \"natural liberty\"), but not as a dogmatic supporter of ''laissez-faire''.<ref name=\"Viner 1927\">{{cite journal |author=Viner, Jacob |date=April 1927 |journal=[[The Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=198\u2013232 |doi=10.1086/253837 |title=Adam Smith and Laissez-faire |jstor=1823421}}</ref>\n\nEconomist [[Daniel B. Klein|Daniel Klein]] believes using the term \"free-market economics\" or \"free-market economist\" to identify the ideas of Smith is too general and slightly misleading.

Most people still fall victim to the thinking that Smith was a free-market economist without exception, though he was not. Ricardo pointed out that Smith was in support of helping infant industries. Smith believed that the government should subsidise newly formed industry, but he did fear that when the infant industry grew into adulthood, it would be unwilling to surrender the government help.<ref name=\"New Ideas From Dead Economists\">Buchholz, Todd (December 1990). pp. 38\u201339.</ref> Smith also supported tariffs on imported goods to counteract an internal tax on the same good. Smith also fell to pressure in supporting some tariffs in support for national defence.<ref name=\"New Ideas From Dead Economists\"/>\n\nSome have also claimed, [[Emma Rothschild]] among them, that Smith would have supported a minimum wage,<ref>Martin, Christopher. \"Adam Smith and Liberal Economics: Reading the Minimum Wage Debate of 1795\u201396,\" ''Econ Journal Watch'' 8(2): 110\u201325, May 2011 [http://econjwatch.org/articles/adam-smith-and-liberal-economics-reading-the-minimum-wage-debate-of-1795-96] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228230820/http://econjwatch.org/articles/adam-smith-and-liberal-economics-reading-the-minimum-wage-debate-of-1795-96 |date=28 December 2013 }}</ref> although no direct textual evidence supports the claim. Indeed, Smith wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The price of labour, it must be observed, cannot be ascertained very accurately anywhere, different prices being often paid at the same place and for the same sort of labour, not only according to the different abilities of the workmen, but according to the easiness or hardness of the masters. Where wages are not regulated by law, all that we can pretend to determine is what are the most usual; and experience seems to show that law can never regulate them properly, though it has often pretended to do so. (''The Wealth of Nations'', Book 1, Chapter 8)</blockquote>\n\nHowever, Smith also noted, to the contrary, the existence of an [[equality of bargaining power|imbalanced, inequality of bargaining power]]:<ref>A Smith, ''Wealth of Nations'' (1776) Book I, ch 8</ref>\n<blockquote>A landlord, a farmer, a master manufacturer, a merchant, though they did not employ a single workman, could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they have already acquired. Many workmen could not subsist a week, few could subsist a month, and scarce any a year without employment. In the long run, the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him, but the necessity is not so immediate.</blockquote>\n\n===Criticism===\n\n[[Alfred Marshall]] criticised Smith's definition of the economy on several points. He argued that man should be equally important as money, services are as important as goods, and that there must be an emphasis on human welfare, instead of just wealth. The \"invisible hand\" only works well when both production and consumption operates in free markets, with small (\"atomistic\") producers and consumers allowing supply and demand to fluctuate and equilibrate. In conditions of monopoly and oligopoly, the \"invisible hand\" fails.\n\nNobel Prize-winning economist [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]] says, on the topic of one of Smith's better-known ideas: \"the reason that the [[invisible hand]] often seems invisible is that it is often not there.\"<ref>''The Roaring Nineties'', 2006</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Organizational capital]]\n* [[List of abolitionist forerunners]]\n* [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society of Arts]]\n* [[List of people on banknotes#Scotland|People on Scottish banknotes]]\n\n==References==\n===Informational notes===\n{{notelist}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|refs=\n}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S1474691300001062|title=II.

Following the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|break-up of the Soviet Union]] and the subsequent downsizing of the Russian Navy, only 24 aircraft were produced. Attempted sales to China and India fell through. With plans to retire the Su-33 once they reach the end of their service life, the Russian Navy ordered the [[Mikoyan MiG-29K|MiG-29K]] as a replacement in 2009.\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== Background and origins ===\nDuring the 1970s, the [[Yakovlev Yak-38]], then the [[Soviet Navy]]'s only operational carrier-based fixed-wing combat aircraft, was found to be unable to undertake its role due to limited range and payload, which severely hampered the capability of the Soviet Navy's [[Kiev-class aircraft carrier|Project 1143]] carriers. It was decided to develop a bigger and more potent carrier capable of operating STOL aircraft. During the assessment period, a number of aircraft carriers were studied; the Project 1160 carrier would have been able to operate the [[MiG-23]]s and [[Sukhoi Su-25|Su-24]]s, but was abandoned due to budget constraints. Design efforts were then concentrated on the [[Project 1153 OREL|Project 1153]] carrier, which would have accommodated the [[Su-25]]s and the proposed MiG-23Ks and Su-27Ks. Sufficient funding was not secured, and the Navy looked at the possibility of a fifth, and larger, Project 1143 carrier, modified to allow for [[Yakovlev Yak-141|Yak-141]], [[Mikoyan MiG-29K|MiG-29K]] and Su-27K operations.<ref name=\"Williams p. 126\">Williams 2002, p.&nbsp;126.</ref><ref name=\"Su-33 history\">{{cite web|title=Sukhoi Su-33: Historical background|publisher=Sukhoi|url=http://www.sukhoi.org/eng/planes/military/su33/history/|access-date=2 July 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513212625/http://www.sukhoi.org/eng/planes/military/su33/history/|archive-date=13 May 2011}}</ref>\n<!--http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2008/07/22/Outside_View_Russias_carrier_weakness/UPI-46861216749820/-->\n\nTo prepare for the operations of the Su-27K and the rival MiG-29K on-board the new carrier, work proceeded on the development of the [[steam catapult]], [[arresting gear]], optical and radio landing systems.

A takeoff ramp was installed at the complex, where takeoffs would be executed to ensure that the Su-27Ks and MiG-29Ks would be able to operate from carriers.<ref name=\"Eden, p. 462\">Eden 2004, p.&nbsp;462.</ref> Both Sukhoi and Mikoyan modified their prototypes to validate the takeoff ramp. Three Sukhoi T10s (\u22123, \u221224 and \u221225), along with an Su-27UB, were used for takeoffs from the simulated ramp. The first of these tests were undertaken by Nikolai Sadovnikov on 28 August 1982. Flight tests indicated the need for a change in ramp design, and it was modified to a [[Ski-jump (aviation)|ski-jump]] profile.<ref name=\"Eden, p. 462\"/>\n\nConceptual designs of the Su-27K commenced in 1978.<ref name=\"Williams p. 126\"/> On 18 April 1984, the Soviet government instructed Sukhoi to develop an air defence fighter; Mikoyan was ordered to build a lighter multirole fighter.<ref name=\"Williams p. 127\">Williams 2002, p.&nbsp;127.</ref> Full-scale design of the Su-27K soon started as the \"T-10K\" under the guidance of Konstantin Marbyshev. Nikolai Sadovnikov was appointed the [[OKB|design bureau]]'s Chief Test Pilot for the programme. By November 1984, conceptual design had passed its critical design review, with the detailed design finalised in 1986.

The pilots also practised no-flare landings before making an actual landing on a carrier deck.

However, when the aircraft was in front of it for longer than the maximum six seconds, the shield's water pipes exploded. The pilot, Pugachyov, reduced engine throttle, accidentally causing the detents (blocks used to restrain aircraft from accelerating) to retract and the fighter to move forwards. The aircraft was quickly stopped; Pugachyov later took off without the use of blast deflectors or detents. Since then, a [[Kamov Ka-27|Kamov Ka-27PS]] [[search-and-rescue]] helicopter was flown close to the carrier in case of an accident.<ref name=\"gordon\">Gordon 1999, p.&nbsp;66.</ref>\n\nDuring the following three-week period, 227 sorties were amassed, along with 35 deck landings.<ref name=\"Williams p. 129\"/> Flight testing continued afterwards, and on 26 September 1991, naval pilots began testing the Su-27K; by 1994, it had successfully passed the State Acceptance Trials.<ref name=\"Eden, p. 462\"/> During 1990\u20131991, seven production aircraft were rolled out.<ref name=\"Williams p. 129\"/>\n\n=== Further developments ===\nThe first of two known versions of the Su-33, the twin-seat Su-33UB, made its first flight in April 1999.

Following the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|break-up of the Soviet Union]] and the subsequent downsizing of the Russian Navy, only 24 aircraft were produced. Attempted sales to China and India fell through. With plans to retire the Su-33 once they reach the end of their service life, the Russian Navy ordered the [[Mikoyan MiG-29K|MiG-29K]] as a replacement in 2009.\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== Background and origins ===\nDuring the 1970s, the [[Yakovlev Yak-38]], then the [[Soviet Navy]]'s only operational carrier-based fixed-wing combat aircraft, was found to be unable to undertake its role due to limited range and payload, which severely hampered the capability of the Soviet Navy's [[Kiev-class aircraft carrier|Project 1143]] carriers. It was decided to develop a bigger and more potent carrier capable of operating STOL aircraft. During the assessment period, a number of aircraft carriers were studied; the Project 1160 carrier would have been able to operate the [[MiG-23]]s and [[Sukhoi Su-25|Su-24]]s, but was abandoned due to budget constraints. Design efforts were then concentrated on the [[Project 1153 OREL|Project 1153]] carrier, which would have accommodated the [[Su-25]]s and the proposed MiG-23Ks and Su-27Ks. Sufficient funding was not secured, and the Navy looked at the possibility of a fifth, and larger, Project 1143 carrier, modified to allow for [[Yakovlev Yak-141|Yak-141]], [[Mikoyan MiG-29K|MiG-29K]] and Su-27K operations.<ref name=\"Williams p. 126\">Williams 2002, p.&nbsp;126.</ref><ref name=\"Su-33 history\">{{cite web|title=Sukhoi Su-33: Historical background|publisher=Sukhoi|url=http://www.sukhoi.org/eng/planes/military/su33/history/|access-date=2 July 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513212625/http://www.sukhoi.org/eng/planes/military/su33/history/|archive-date=13 May 2011}}</ref>\n<!--http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2008/07/22/Outside_View_Russias_carrier_weakness/UPI-46861216749820/-->\n\nTo prepare for the operations of the Su-27K and the rival MiG-29K on-board the new carrier, work proceeded on the development of the [[steam catapult]], [[arresting gear]], optical and radio landing systems.

A takeoff ramp was installed at the complex, where takeoffs would be executed to ensure that the Su-27Ks and MiG-29Ks would be able to operate from carriers.<ref name=\"Eden, p. 462\">Eden 2004, p.&nbsp;462.</ref> Both Sukhoi and Mikoyan modified their prototypes to validate the takeoff ramp. Three Sukhoi T10s (\u22123, \u221224 and \u221225), along with an Su-27UB, were used for takeoffs from the simulated ramp. The first of these tests were undertaken by Nikolai Sadovnikov on 28 August 1982.

The pilots also practised no-flare landings before making an actual landing on a carrier deck. It was another two years before ''Tbilisi'', subsequently renamed ''Admiral Kuznetsov'', left the shipyard.<ref name=\"Williams p. 129\">Williams 2002, p.&nbsp;129.</ref><ref name=\"Su-33 history\"/>\n\nViktor Pugachyov, piloting the second Su-27K, became the first Russian to conventionally land aboard an aircraft carrier on 1 November 1989.<ref name=\"Williams p. 129\"/><ref>Gordon 1999, p.&nbsp;80.</ref> It was found that the carrier's [[jet blast deflector]]s were too close to the engine nozzles when raised at an angle of 60\u00b0; thus an improvised solution held the deflectors at 45\u00b0. However, when the aircraft was in front of it for longer than the maximum six seconds, the shield's water pipes exploded. The pilot, Pugachyov, reduced engine throttle, accidentally causing the detents (blocks used to restrain aircraft from accelerating) to retract and the fighter to move forwards. The aircraft was quickly stopped; Pugachyov later took off without the use of blast deflectors or detents. Since then, a [[Kamov Ka-27|Kamov Ka-27PS]] [[search-and-rescue]] helicopter was flown close to the carrier in case of an accident.<ref name=\"gordon\">Gordon 1999, p.&nbsp;66.</ref>\n\nDuring the following three-week period, 227 sorties were amassed, along with 35 deck landings.<ref name=\"Williams p. 129\"/> Flight testing continued afterwards, and on 26 September 1991, naval pilots began testing the Su-27K; by 1994, it had successfully passed the State Acceptance Trials.<ref name=\"Eden, p. 462\"/> During 1990\u20131991, seven production aircraft were rolled out.<ref name=\"Williams p. 129\"/>\n\n=== Further developments ===\nThe first of two known versions of the Su-33, the twin-seat Su-33UB, made its first flight in April 1999.

Two marble plaques at the entrance mark the two historic events.\n\nBuilt by architect James Agg, the St John's church is built with a combination of brick and stone and was commonly known as the \"Pathure Girja\"<ref name = \"Roy\"/> (Stone Church). Stone was a rare material in the late 18th century [[Kolkata]]. The stones came from the medieval ruins of Gour, and were shipped down the [[Hooghly River]].

The floor is a rare hue of blue-grey marble, brought from [[Gaur, West Bengal|Gaur]]. Large windows allow the sunlight to filter through the coloured glass.\n\n[[Image:STJ2.jpg|thumb|500 px|centre|Interior of St. John's Church, [[Kolkata]]]]\n\n[[Image:Pipe Organ - St Johns Church - Kolkata 2016-01-15 8562.JPG|thumb|200 px|right|The [[Pipe Organ]] of St John's Church in Kolkata]]\n\nThe main altar is of a simple design. Behind the altar is a semi-circular dome and the floor is of dark blue, almost black, stone. To the left of the altar hangs a painting of The Last Supper by the British artist of German origin, [[Johann Zoffany]]. On the right is a beautiful [[stained glass]] window.\n\nThe walls of the church contain memorial tablets, statues and plaques, mostly of British army officers and civil servants.\n\n===Memorial of James Achilles Kirkpatrick===\n[[Image:StJ9.jpg|thumb|200 px|right|Memorial of [[James Achilles Kirkpatrick|\"White Mughal\"]]]]\n[[James Achilles Kirkpatrick]], popularly known as the White Mughal was the central character of [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]] best selling work of history [[White Mughals]] died in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] on 15 October 1805 at the age of 41. He was buried at the North Park Street Cemetery, but neither his grave nor the cemetery exists today.\n\nJames Achilles Kirkpatrick's father James Kirkpatrick, popularly known as the Handsome Colonel, along with his brothers erected a memorial in memory of James Achilles Kirkpatrick on the southern wall of the St. John's Church. The overblown and oddly inappropriate epitaph, erected still stands to this day.<ref>{{Cite news|author = William, Dalrymple |title = White Mughals |publisher = Penguin Books|year = 2002|page = 401}}</ref>\n\n===Memorial of James Pattle===\n[[Image:STJ3.jpg|thumb|200 px|right|Memorial of James Pattle, St. John's Church, [[Kolkata]]]]\nThe memorial of James Pattle, the great-great-grandfather of [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]] is also located on the south walls of St. John's Church.\n\nAccording to Dalrample:\n\n{{quote|Seven generations of my family were born in Calcutta, there are three Dalrymples sitting inside St John's graveyard. And a great-great-grandfather's plaque is on the St John's Church wall, James Pattle.\n\n\nJames Pattle was known as the greatest liar in India. A man supposed to be so wicked that the Devil wouldn't let him leave India after he died. Pattle left instructions that when he died, his body should be shipped back to Britain. So, after his demise (in 1845) they pickled the body in rum, as was the way of transporting bodies back then. The coffin was placed in the cabin of Pattle's wife and the ship set sail from Garden Reach. In the middle of the night, the corpse broke through the coffin and sat up. The wife had a heart attack and died.\n\n\nNow both bodies had to be preserved in rum. But the casks reeked of alcohol and the sailors bored holes through the sides of the coffins and drank the rum\u2026 and, of course, got drunk and the ship hit a sandbank and the whole thing exploded, cremating Pattle and his wife in the middle of the Hooghly!

Painted by [[Johann Zoffany]], the painting is not, however, an exact replica of Leonardo's masterpiece.\n\nThe top left-hand corner of the painting shows a sword, which represents a common peon's [[tulwar]]. A [[water ewer]] standing near the table is a copy of Hindustani spittoon and next to it lies a water-filled [[beesty bag]] (a goatskin bag used for storing water).\n\nThe most unusual feature of Zoffany's Last Supper lies in the selection of models used to represent Jesus and his twelve disciples. Jesus was portrayed as the Greek priest Father Constantinos Parthenios.<ref>[https://elinepa.org/father-constantinos-parthenios-and-the-last-supper-by-johann-zoffany-in-the-st-johns-church-kolkata/ Father Constantinos Parthenios and the Last Supper by Johann Zoffany in the St. John\u2019s Church, Kolkata], 2017</ref> while [[Mary Magdalene|Mary]] is represented by W.C.

According to one British survivor ([[John Zephaniah Holwell|John Holwell]]), during the siege of Calcutta Siraj \u2013 ud \u2013 Daulah took 146 prisoners and confined them in a room measuring 14 feet by 8 feet and locked them up overnight. Only 23 survived: the remaining 123 perished of suffocation and heat stroke.\n\n[[John Zephaniah Holwell|John Holwell]] later became the Governor of Bengal and went on to build a memorial at the site of the Black Hole (present day GPO). However, some historians have objected to Holwell's account, claiming that the British escaped through a secret tunnel to the banks of the Hooghly, from where they were carried to Madras by an awaiting ship. One such historian, [[R. C. Majumdar]], claims without evidence to support his assertion that the \"Holwell story is completely baseless and can not be considered reliable historical information.\" In this regard, although it is possible that Holwell exaggerated the number of persons who were confined and died, his account was an eye-witness version of the events that befell the hapless victims and therefore represents direct evidence of the atrocity itself.\n\nThe story of the Black Hole Monument is no less interesting. Holwell erected a monument at the site of the Black Hole tragedy but it disappeared in 1822 to be rebuilt by [[George Nathaniel Curzon|Curzon]] in 1901 at the SouthWest corner of the [[Writers' Building]]. During the height of the Indian independence movement in 1940, the British removed the monument to its present location at the compound of St. John's Church.\n\n===Second Rohilla War Memorial===\n{{details|Second Rohilla War}}\n[[Image:Second Rohilla War Cenotaph - St John's Churchyard - Kolkata.jpg|thumb|200 px|right|[[Second Rohilla War]] Memorial]]\n[[First Rohilla War|First]] and [[Second Rohilla War]] (1772\u201374) was fought between the Rohillas and the Nawab of Oudh, with the British backing the later.

Some of the Rohillas settled in the Oudah region and soon a conflict began between the Rohillas and the Nawab of Oudh, Shuja \u2013 ud \u2013 Daula. This resulted in Rohilla War.\n\nThe British backed the Nawab of Oudh and in January 1774 the Rohilla chief Hafez Ruhmet was killed resulting in the defeat of the Rohillas. A treaty in October 1774 brought the dispute to a close. With their power somewhat restricted the Rohillas continued to live in their territory of Rohilkhand, which still exists in the state of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nThe Rohilla Memorial at the St. John's Church compound consists of a circular dome supported by 12 pillars.

The wife had a heart attack and died.\n\n\nNow both bodies had to be preserved in rum.

It stars [[Song Kang-ho]], [[Lee Sun-kyun]], [[Cho Yeo-jeong]], [[Choi Woo-shik]], [[Park So-dam]], [[Jang Hye-jin (actress)|Jang Hye-jin]], and [[Lee Jung-eun (actress)|Lee Jung-eun]] and follows the members of a poor family who scheme to become employed by a wealthy family by infiltrating their household and posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.\n\n''Parasite'' premiered at the [[2019 Cannes Film Festival]] on 21 May 2019, where it became the first South Korean film to win the [[Palme d'Or]]. It was then released in South Korea by [[CJ Entertainment]] on 30 May 2019.\n\nThe film received universal critical acclaim, with praise directed towards its screenplay, Bong's direction, score, cinematography, editing, production values, and the performances, particularly from [[Song Kang-ho]] and [[Cho Yeo-jeong]] who were both nominated for and won numerous awards for their acting. It is considered one of the greatest films of the 2010s. It grossed over $266 million worldwide on a production budget of about $11 million, becoming [[List of highest-grossing films in South Korea#Domestic films by gross|the highest-grossing South Korean film]].\n\nAmong its [[List of accolades received by Parasite|numerous accolades]], ''Parasite'' won a leading four awards at the [[92nd Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best International Feature Film|Best International Feature Film]], becoming the first film not in English to win the Academy Award for Best Picture.{{refn|group=note|Although ''Parasite'' was the first film not in English to win Best Picture at the Oscars, it is not to be confused with the first   ''foreign'' film (produced by a company of a country that does not have English as its primary language) to win Best Picture, which was achieved by ''[[The Artist (film)|The Artist]]'' in 2012.

Leaving to study abroad, he suggests that Ki-woo takes over his job as an English [[tutor]] for the daughter of the wealthy Park family, though Ki-woo is initially hesitant. Ki-jung forges a diploma from [[Yonsei University]] for Ki-woo to help him get hired; upon arrival, Mrs. Park hires him, and decides they will call him \"Kevin\".\n\nThe Kim family infiltrates the lives of the Parks by recommending each other's services, posing as unrelated and highly qualified workers. Ki-woo tutors and begins a romance with the Parks' daughter, Da-hye. Ki-jung poses as \"Jessica\", an [[Art therapy|art therapist]] to the Parks' hyperactive young son, Da-song. Ki-jung frames Mr. Park's chauffeur as having had sex in the car by leaving her underwear beneath the passenger seat for Mr. Park to discover, and Ki-taek is hired to replace him. Finally, Chung-sook takes over as the Parks' housekeeper after the Kims exploit the severe peach allergy of the long-time housekeeper, Moon-gwang, and convince Mrs. Park that she has [[tuberculosis]].\n\nWhen the Parks leave on a camping trip for Da-song's birthday, the Kims revel in the luxuries of the Park residence. Moon-gwang suddenly returns, telling Chung-sook she has left something in the house's basement, and reveals the hidden entrance to an [[Bunker|underground bunker]] created by the house's architect and previous owner. Moon-gwang's husband, Geun-sae, has been secretly living underneath the home for years, hiding from [[loan shark]]s after his Taiwanese bakery failed and left him in huge debt. Chung-sook refuses Moon-gwang's pleas to help Geun-sae remain in the bunker, but the eavesdropping Kims accidentally reveal their secret to Moon-gwang, who threatens to report them to the Parks.\n\nA severe rainstorm brings the Parks home early, and the Kims scramble to clean up the home before the Parks return, while a brawl breaks out between Moon-gwang, Geun-sae, and the Kims. The Kims trap Geun-sae and a mortally wounded Moon-gwang in the bunker, and Ki-taek sees Geun-sae sending a fruitless message in [[SKATS|Morse code]] using the home's lights. Mrs. Park reveals to Chung-sook that Da-song had a seizure-inducing [[Psychological trauma|traumatic experience]] on a previous birthday when he saw a \"ghost\"&nbsp;\u2013 actually Geun-sae emerging from the basement&nbsp;\u2013 and that the family has celebrated Da-song's birthday outside the house ever since. The Kims escape the Parks' house unseen, but not before hearing Mr. Park's offhanded comment that Ki-taek, despite being a good employee, smells bad. Returning home to find their apartment completely flooded by the storm, the Kims are forced to sleep in a gymnasium with other displaced people.\n\nThe next day, Mrs. Park hosts a house party for Da-song's birthday, with the Kim family in attendance. Ki-woo enters the bunker with the scholar's rock to face Geun-sae. Finding Moon-gwang dead, he is attacked by Geun-sae, who bludgeons him with the rock and escapes. Seeking to avenge Moon-gwang, Geun-sae stabs Ki-jung with a kitchen knife in front of the horrified guests. Da-song suffers another seizure upon seeing Geun-sae, and a struggle breaks out until Chung-sook fatally impales Geun-sae with a barbecue skewer. While Ki-taek tends to a severely bleeding Ki-jung, Mr. Park orders him to drive Da-song to the hospital. In the chaos, Ki-taek, upon seeing Mr. Park's disgusted reaction to Geun-sae's smell, takes the knife and kills Mr. Park before fleeing the scene.\n\nWeeks later, Ki-woo wakes up after brain surgery. He and Chung-sook are convicted of [[fraud]] and put on probation. Ki-jung has died from her injury and Ki-taek, wanted for Mr. Park's murder, has vanished. Geun-sae's motives for the attack are a mystery to the public. Ki-woo watches the Parks' home, which has been sold to a German family unaware of its history, and sees a message in Morse code from the flickering lights. It is from Ki-taek, who escaped into the bunker and now survives by scavenging from the new homeowners and flicks the light everyday hoping Ki-woo will see it one day. Still living in the banjiha with his mother, Ki-woo writes a letter to Ki-taek, vowing to earn enough money to one day purchase the house and free his father.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Song Kang-ho]] as Kim Ki-taek ({{Korean|hangul=\uae40\uae30\ud0dd|rr=Gim Gitaek|labels=no}}), father of the Kim family\n* [[Lee Sun-kyun]] as Park Dong-ik (Nathan; {{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ub3d9\uc775|rr=Bak Dongik|labels=no}}), father of the Park family\n* [[Cho Yeo-jeong]] as Choi Yeon-gyo ({{Korean|hangul=\ucd5c\uc5f0\uad50|rr=Choe Yeongyo|labels=no}}), mother of the Park family\n* [[Choi Woo-shik]] as Kim Ki-woo (Kevin; {{Korean|hangul=\uae40\uae30\uc6b0|rr=Gim Giu|labels=no}}), son of the Kim family\n* [[Park So-dam]] as Kim Ki-jung (Jessica; {{Korean|hangul=\uae40\uae30\uc815|rr=Gim Gijeong|labels=no}}), daughter of the Kim family\n* [[Lee Jung-eun (actress)|Lee Jung-eun]] as Gook Moon-gwang ({{Korean|hangul=\uad6d\ubb38\uad11|rr=Guk Mungwang|labels=no}}), the housekeeper\n* [[Jang Hye-jin (actress)|Jang Hye-jin]] as Chung-sook ({{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ucda9\uc219|rr=Bak Chungsuk|labels=no}}), mother of the Kim family\n* [[Park Myung-hoon]] as Oh Geun-sae ({{Korean|hangul=\uc624\uadfc\uc138|rr=O Geunse|labels=no}}), Moon-gwang's husband\n* [[Jung Ji-so]] as Park Da-hye ({{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ub2e4\ud61c|rr=Bak Dahye|labels=no}}), daughter of the Park family\n* [[Jung Hyeon-jun]] as Park Da-song ({{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ub2e4\uc1a1|rr=Bak Dasong|labels=no}}), son of the Park family\n* Park Geun-rok as Yoon ({{Korean|hangul=\uc724|rr=Yun|labels=no}}), Kim Ki-taek's predecessor as Park Dong-ik's chauffeur\n* [[Park Seo-joon]] as Min-hyuk ({{Korean|hangul=\ubbfc\ud601|rr=Minhyeok|labels=no}}), Ki-woo's friend (cameo appearance)<ref>{{cite news |last1=Park |first1=Boram |title='Rom-com master' Park Seo-joon embraces career-changing role in action horror film |url=https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20190725009700315 |accessdate=2 March 2020 |agency=[[Yonhap News Agency]] |date=25 July 2019 |language=en}}<!-- Note that the English report is basically a translation of the original interview in Korean [https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20190724141500005], but the Korean one does not mention Park Seo-joon's cameo appearance in Parasite (unlike the English version). --></ref>\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nThe idea for ''Parasite'' originated in 2013.

Bong said \"Because the story is about the poor family infiltrating and creeping into the rich house, it seems very obvious that ''Parasite'' refers to the poor family, and I think that's why the marketing team was a little hesitant. But if you look at it the other way, you can say that rich family, they're also parasites in terms of labor. They can't even wash dishes, they can't drive themselves, so they leech off the poor family's labor.

We prioritize blocking and camera angles while architects build spaces for people to actually live in and thus design around people. So I think the approach is very different.\"<ref name=\"IndieWire 2019\" /> For example, Ha-jun established that Namgoong would have used the first floor's living room to appreciate the garden, so it was built with a single wide window and only spartan seating options for this function.<ref name=\"archdigest\"/> Some of the interior artwork in the house sets were by South Korea artist Seung-mo Park, including existing artwork of hers and some explicitly created for the film.<ref name=\"archdigest\"/> Further, design of the home and of its interiors were aimed to make the set amenable for filming at the 2.35:1 aspect ratio, favoring wide and deeper rooms rather than height.<ref name=\"IndieWire 2019\" />\n\nLee said the sun was an important factor when building the outdoor set. \"The sun's direction was a crucial point of consideration while we were searching for outdoor lots,\" explained Lee. \"We had to remember the sun's position during our desired time frame and determine the positions and sizes of the windows accordingly. In terms of practical lighting, the DP [director of photography Hong Kyung-pyo] had specific requests regarding the color. He wanted sophisticated indirect lighting and the warmth from [[Incandescent light bulb|tungsten light sources]]. Before building the set, the DP and I visited the lot several times to check the sun's movement at each time, and we decided on the set's location together.\"<ref name=\"IndieWire 2019\">{{cite web |title=How Bong Joon Ho Designed the House in ''Parasite'' |website=[[IndieWire]] |date=29 October 2019 |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/10/parasite-house-set-design-bong-joon-ho-1202185829/ |access-date=6 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191104232715/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/10/parasite-house-set-design-bong-joon-ho-1202185829/ |archive-date=4 November 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Set design ===\nThe Kim's semi-basement apartment and its street was also built on set, partially out of necessity for filming the flooding scenes.<ref name=\"IndieWire 2019\" /> Lee Ha-jun visited and photographed several abandoned villages and towns in South Korea scheduled to be torn down to help inform the set design.

Leaving to study abroad, he suggests that Ki-woo takes over his job as an English [[tutor]] for the daughter of the wealthy Park family, though Ki-woo is initially hesitant. Ki-jung forges a diploma from [[Yonsei University]] for Ki-woo to help him get hired; upon arrival, Mrs. Park hires him, and decides they will call him \"Kevin\".\n\nThe Kim family infiltrates the lives of the Parks by recommending each other's services, posing as unrelated and highly qualified workers. Ki-woo tutors and begins a romance with the Parks' daughter, Da-hye. Ki-jung poses as \"Jessica\", an [[Art therapy|art therapist]] to the Parks' hyperactive young son, Da-song. Ki-jung frames Mr. Park's chauffeur as having had sex in the car by leaving her underwear beneath the passenger seat for Mr. Park to discover, and Ki-taek is hired to replace him. Finally, Chung-sook takes over as the Parks' housekeeper after the Kims exploit the severe peach allergy of the long-time housekeeper, Moon-gwang, and convince Mrs. Park that she has [[tuberculosis]].\n\nWhen the Parks leave on a camping trip for Da-song's birthday, the Kims revel in the luxuries of the Park residence. Moon-gwang suddenly returns, telling Chung-sook she has left something in the house's basement, and reveals the hidden entrance to an [[Bunker|underground bunker]] created by the house's architect and previous owner. Moon-gwang's husband, Geun-sae, has been secretly living underneath the home for years, hiding from [[loan shark]]s after his Taiwanese bakery failed and left him in huge debt. Chung-sook refuses Moon-gwang's pleas to help Geun-sae remain in the bunker, but the eavesdropping Kims accidentally reveal their secret to Moon-gwang, who threatens to report them to the Parks.\n\nA severe rainstorm brings the Parks home early, and the Kims scramble to clean up the home before the Parks return, while a brawl breaks out between Moon-gwang, Geun-sae, and the Kims. The Kims trap Geun-sae and a mortally wounded Moon-gwang in the bunker, and Ki-taek sees Geun-sae sending a fruitless message in [[SKATS|Morse code]] using the home's lights. Mrs. Park reveals to Chung-sook that Da-song had a seizure-inducing [[Psychological trauma|traumatic experience]] on a previous birthday when he saw a \"ghost\"&nbsp;\u2013 actually Geun-sae emerging from the basement&nbsp;\u2013 and that the family has celebrated Da-song's birthday outside the house ever since. The Kims escape the Parks' house unseen, but not before hearing Mr. Park's offhanded comment that Ki-taek, despite being a good employee, smells bad. Returning home to find their apartment completely flooded by the storm, the Kims are forced to sleep in a gymnasium with other displaced people.\n\nThe next day, Mrs. Park hosts a house party for Da-song's birthday, with the Kim family in attendance. Ki-woo enters the bunker with the scholar's rock to face Geun-sae. Finding Moon-gwang dead, he is attacked by Geun-sae, who bludgeons him with the rock and escapes. Seeking to avenge Moon-gwang, Geun-sae stabs Ki-jung with a kitchen knife in front of the horrified guests. Da-song suffers another seizure upon seeing Geun-sae, and a struggle breaks out until Chung-sook fatally impales Geun-sae with a barbecue skewer. While Ki-taek tends to a severely bleeding Ki-jung, Mr. Park orders him to drive Da-song to the hospital. In the chaos, Ki-taek, upon seeing Mr. Park's disgusted reaction to Geun-sae's smell, takes the knife and kills Mr. Park before fleeing the scene.\n\nWeeks later, Ki-woo wakes up after brain surgery. He and Chung-sook are convicted of [[fraud]] and put on probation. Ki-jung has died from her injury and Ki-taek, wanted for Mr. Park's murder, has vanished. Geun-sae's motives for the attack are a mystery to the public. Ki-woo watches the Parks' home, which has been sold to a German family unaware of its history, and sees a message in Morse code from the flickering lights. It is from Ki-taek, who escaped into the bunker and now survives by scavenging from the new homeowners and flicks the light everyday hoping Ki-woo will see it one day. Still living in the banjiha with his mother, Ki-woo writes a letter to Ki-taek, vowing to earn enough money to one day purchase the house and free his father.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Song Kang-ho]] as Kim Ki-taek ({{Korean|hangul=\uae40\uae30\ud0dd|rr=Gim Gitaek|labels=no}}), father of the Kim family\n* [[Lee Sun-kyun]] as Park Dong-ik (Nathan; {{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ub3d9\uc775|rr=Bak Dongik|labels=no}}), father of the Park family\n* [[Cho Yeo-jeong]] as Choi Yeon-gyo ({{Korean|hangul=\ucd5c\uc5f0\uad50|rr=Choe Yeongyo|labels=no}}), mother of the Park family\n* [[Choi Woo-shik]] as Kim Ki-woo (Kevin; {{Korean|hangul=\uae40\uae30\uc6b0|rr=Gim Giu|labels=no}}), son of the Kim family\n* [[Park So-dam]] as Kim Ki-jung (Jessica; {{Korean|hangul=\uae40\uae30\uc815|rr=Gim Gijeong|labels=no}}), daughter of the Kim family\n* [[Lee Jung-eun (actress)|Lee Jung-eun]] as Gook Moon-gwang ({{Korean|hangul=\uad6d\ubb38\uad11|rr=Guk Mungwang|labels=no}}), the housekeeper\n* [[Jang Hye-jin (actress)|Jang Hye-jin]] as Chung-sook ({{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ucda9\uc219|rr=Bak Chungsuk|labels=no}}), mother of the Kim family\n* [[Park Myung-hoon]] as Oh Geun-sae ({{Korean|hangul=\uc624\uadfc\uc138|rr=O Geunse|labels=no}}), Moon-gwang's husband\n* [[Jung Ji-so]] as Park Da-hye ({{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ub2e4\ud61c|rr=Bak Dahye|labels=no}}), daughter of the Park family\n* [[Jung Hyeon-jun]] as Park Da-song ({{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ub2e4\uc1a1|rr=Bak Dasong|labels=no}}), son of the Park family\n* Park Geun-rok as Yoon ({{Korean|hangul=\uc724|rr=Yun|labels=no}}), Kim Ki-taek's predecessor as Park Dong-ik's chauffeur\n* [[Park Seo-joon]] as Min-hyuk ({{Korean|hangul=\ubbfc\ud601|rr=Minhyeok|labels=no}}), Ki-woo's friend (cameo appearance)<ref>{{cite news |last1=Park |first1=Boram |title='Rom-com master' Park Seo-joon embraces career-changing role in action horror film |url=https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20190725009700315 |accessdate=2 March 2020 |agency=[[Yonhap News Agency]] |date=25 July 2019 |language=en}}<!-- Note that the English report is basically a translation of the original interview in Korean [https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20190724141500005], but the Korean one does not mention Park Seo-joon's cameo appearance in Parasite (unlike the English version). --></ref>\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nThe idea for ''Parasite'' originated in 2013.

{"title_page": "Addled Parliament", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n{{EngvarB|date=August 2019}}\n\n{{Parliaments of England 1601}}\n\nThe '''Parliament of 1614''' was the second [[Parliament of England]] of the reign of [[James VI and I]], which sat between 5 April and 7 June 1614. Lasting only two months and two days, it saw no bills pass and was not even regarded as a Parliament by its contemporaries. However, for this legislative failure it has been known to posterity as the '''Addled Parliament'''.\n\nJames had struggled with debt ever since he came to the English throne. The failure of the [[Blessed Parliament]] of 1604\u20131610 to, in its six-year sitting, rescue the king from his mounting debt or allow James to unite his two kingdoms, had left him bitter with the body. The four-year hiatus between Parliaments saw the royal debt and deficit grow further, despite the best efforts of [[Lord High Treasurer|Treasurer]] [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]. The failure of the last and most lucrative financial expedient of this period, a foreign [[dowry]] from the marriage of his [[heir-apparent]], finally convinced James to recall Parliament in early 1614.\n\nThe Parliament got off to a bad start, with poor choices made for the king's representatives in Parliament. Rumours of conspiracy to manage (the \"undertaking\") or pack the Parliament for the king, though not based in fact, spread quickly. The spreading of this rumour, and the ultimate failure of Parliament, has been generally attributed to the scheming of the [[crypto-Catholic]] [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]], though this allegation has met with some recent skepticism. Parliament opened on 5 April and, despite the king's wishes it would be a \"Parliament of Love\", flung itself immediately into the controversy over the conspiracies, splitting parliament and leading to the exclusion of one alleged packer. However, by late April, Parliament had moved on to a familiar controversy, that of [[impositions]]. [[House of Commons of England|The Commons]] were pitted against [[House of Lords of England|the Lords]], culminating in a controversy over an unrestrained speech by one prelate.\n\nJames grew impatient with the Parliamentary proceedings. He issued an ultimatum to Parliament, but they treated it irreverently. Insult was added to injury by belligerent, and supposedly threatening, attacks on him from the Commons. On the advice of Northampton, James dissolved Parliament on 7 June, and had 4 [[MP (UK)|MP]]s sent to the [[Tower of London]]. James devised new financial expedients to settle his still-growing debt, to little success. [[Historiographically]], historians are divided between the [[Whig history|Whiggish]] view of the Parliament as anticipating the constitutional disputes of future Parliaments, and the [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] view of it as a conflict primarily concerned with James's finances.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|James VI and I|Blessed Parliament}}\n[[File:King James I of England and VI of Scotland in Parliament by Renold or Reginold Elstrack (Elstracke).jpg|left|thumb|King James I at the [[Blessed Parliament]] on 5 November 1605.]]\nJames VI and I (1566\u20131625) ascended to the [[List of Scottish monarchs|Scottish throne]] on 24 July 1567, and subsequently to the [[List of English monarchs|English and Irish throne]] on 24 March 1603, becoming [[Union of the Crowns|the first king of to reign over both kingdoms]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} James inherited, with the latter throne, a national debt to the amount of \u00a3300,000, a sum that only increased during his reign. By 1608, it stood at \u00a31 million. During his predecessor [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s reign, the inward revenue of the crown had steadily fallen; taxes from customs and land were consistently undervalued and the parliamentary subsidies steadily shrank.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It did not help that James reigned as \"one of the most extravagant kings\" in English history.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} In peace, Elizabeth's yearly expenditure never rose above \u00a3300,000; almost immediately after James took the throne, it was at \u00a3400,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} James had instituted various extra-parliamentary plans to recuperate this lost income, but these drew controversy from Parliament, and James still wanted for money.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} Moreover, James was keen to not be \"a husband to two wives\" as king, and to unite his crowns as one kingdom of [[Great Britain]];{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} as his slogan went: \"one king, one people, and one law\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}{{efn|In James's original Latinism: \"{{lang|la|Unus Rex}} [...] {{lang|la|Unus Grex}} and {{lang|la|Una Lex}}\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}}} The first parliament of his reign, also known as the Blessed Parliament, was called in 1604; it took seven years, with proceeding through five sessions, before James dissolved it,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} ending unsatisfactorily for both king and Parliament.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In the first session, many members feared James's unification would lead to the dissolution of the English [[Common Law]] system. Though many prominent politicians publicly praised the idea of unification and MPs accepted a commission to investigate the union early in Parliament, James's proposed title of the \"king of Great Britain\" was rejected outright.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} Between the first and second sessions, in October 1604, James assumed the title of king of Great Britain by proclamation, controversially circumventing parliament. Unification was not brought up at the second session, in hopes of assuaging outrage,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but by the end of the third session, proposals for unification faced such criticism from MPs that the idea was practically dead.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It was quietly dropped from discussion in the fourth and fifth sessions.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}\n\n[[File:John de Critz Robert Cecil Earl of Salisbury c 1608.png||thumb|[[Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury]] depicted with the white staff of a [[Lord High Treasurer]]. Though a skilled treasurer, Salisbury was unable to significantly reduce the Crown's crippling debt before his death.]]\n\nDuring the Blessed Parliament, Parliament's own aims saw similar disappointment; James rebuffed the proposed institution of Puritan ecclesiastical reforms,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} and failed to address two unpopular royal rights, [[purveyance]] and [[wardship]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{efn|According to Andrew Thrush of [[The History of Parliament]]: \"Purveyance was the right of the Crown to take up provisions for the royal household at below the market rate, while wardship was the right of the Crown to manage the estates of minors whose lands were held of the king.\"{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}}} In the second session, Parliament granted the king a subsidy of \u00a3400,000, keen to exhibit royal support in the wake of the [[Gunpowder Plot]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but thanks to the reduction of these subsidies under Elizabeth, this was rather less than the king desired.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} After a 3-year delay between sessions due to [[Bubonic plague|plague]], the fourth session was called in February 1610, and was dominated by financial discussion. [[Lord High Treasurer]], [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]] proposed the [[Great Contract]]: a financial plan wherein Parliament would grant the Crown \u00a3600,000 immediately (to pay off its debts) and an annual stipend of \u00a3200,000 thereafter; in return, the king was to abolish ten feudal dues, among them, purveyance. After much haggling, in which wardship was added to the abolished dues, the session adjourned on a supportive note. However, when the next session began, support had cooled. Parliament refused to give an annual stipend unless James abolished [[impositions]] as well.{{efn|The feudal duty of impositions were an invaluable source of extra-parliamentary income for James, bringing the Crown \u00a370,000 a year. This sum would only increase with the growth of trade in England;{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} by the 1630s, they brought the king \u00a3218,000 a year.{{sfn|Russell|1990|p=39}}}} Parliament did give the king an immediate subsidy, but the proposed \u00a3600,000 was reduced to a mere \u00a3100,000. By 6 November 1610, James demanded the other \u00a3500,000 and conditioned that, if impositions were to be abolished, Parliament would have to supply him with another equally lucrative income source. Parliament was outraged, and the Contract was abandoned three days later. Though both Salisbury and James made conciliatory gestures in hopes of securing any more financial support from Parliament, James grew impatient. On 31 December 1610, James publicly proclaimed the dissolution of the Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} James's first parliament had ended on a bitter note; \"your greatest error\", he chastised Salisbury, \"hath been that ye ever expected to draw honey out of gall.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=80}}\n\nAfter this, James was not keen to call another Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} However, without Parliament to raise taxes, the treasury was forced to find new ways to raise money.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In 1611, the City of London loaned the Crown \u00a3100,000; \u00a360,000 was extracted from [[Louis XIII of France|the King of France]] over debts accumulated in the reign of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]; [[Honour#Awards|honours]] were sold to wealthy gentlemen, raising \u00a390,000; a forced loan was levied on nearly 10,000 people.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|pp=148\u2013149}} Yet, after the death of Treasurer Salisbury in 1612, England's finances still remained destitute, with a debt of \u00a3500,000 and annual [[Deficit spending|deficit]] of \u00a3160,000.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|p=149}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=10}} However, James's principal fiscal expedient was to be the marriage of his [[heir-apparent]], [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry, Prince of Wales]], for which he expected a sizeable [[dowry]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} not to mention a foreign ally.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=84}} James went into talks with several Catholic countries but, in late 1612, aged 18, Henry contracted [[typhoid]] and abruptly died;{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=85}} [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]], newly heir-apparent at age 12, took his place in the negotiations. Negotiations were going most promisingly in France, where a marriage of Prince Charles to the 6-year-old Princess [[Christine of France]] promised a healthy sum of \u00a3240,000, almost halving James's debt.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} However, by early 1614, France's internal religious strife had intensified to such a point that civil war seemed imminent, so negotiations stalled on the French side; James grew impatient.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James's financial insecurity had only worsened in this time, the debt now at \u00a3680,000 and the deficit, \u00a3200,000.{{sfn|Roberts|1985|p=7}} [[Conspicuous consumption]] had raised yearly expenditure to an unsustainable \u00a3522,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|pp=98\u201399}} A group of advisors, led by the [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Earls of Suffolk]] and [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|Pembroke]], encouraged the king to call a Parliament to raise funds, convincing James \"that\"\u2014as he later put it\u2014\"my subjects did not hate me, which I know I had not deserved.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Northampton stringently opposed this summoning,{{sfn|Cramsie|2002|p=135}} but, in 1614, James reluctantly summoned another parliament.

Two of the king's closest advisors were unavailable, the Earls of Salisbury was dead and Northampton was ill.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Even Suffolk and Pembroke were clueless of any way to prevent Parliament from bringing up thorny issues such as impositions again.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} However, two Councillors were to provide advice to the king over his new parliament, which would prove significant.{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] [[Sir Francis Bacon]], who had been among the most vocal in favour of calling Parliament, blamed Salisbury entirely for the failure of the previous Parliament, privately holding the treasurer had undermine his early career. He asserted that Salisbury's deal-making had been the king's downfall, and that the king should approach Parliament as a king, rather than a merchant, and request subsidies on the basis of the Commons' good will.{{sfn|Willson|1967|pp=344\u2013345}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|pp=251\u2013252}} Bacon added to this that the king should employ patronage to win over the men of Parliament to his side.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=489}} [[Sir Henry Neville (died 1615)|Sir Henry Neville]] offered advice to the king on how to warm relations with Parliament, which he accepted amiably.{{sfn|Thrush|2010c}} But Neville's more portentous offer was that of an \"undertaking\", whereby Neville and a group of \"patriots\" would arrange to manage the Parliament in James's favour, in return for the office of Secretary of State.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} James rejected the undertaking derisively, and no such conspiracy was ever arranged,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} but rumours of its actual occurrence spread quickly in the lead up to Parliament.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=491}}\n\nMPs later accused James of trying to [[wikt:pack#Verb|pack]] the Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=52}} Indeed, Bacon had plainly advised the king on the \"placing of persons well-affected and discreet\" in Parliament,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=221\u2013222}} and James was unapologetic in packing the Irish Parliament the previous year.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93}}{{efn|James attempted to pack the Irish Parliament of 1613 with Protestants by adding a 84 new seats to the former 148 that election: 38 represented tiny or as-yet nonexistent settlements in the Protestant [[Ulster plantation]].

James insisted he was within his royal right in doing this and mocked the Parliament's grievances.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93, 148}}}} A large number of Crown officials found themselves in this Parliament,{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=53}} four Privy Councillors found themselves in the Commons, alongside plenty of Crown lawyers.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=222\u2013223}} Though there is no evidence that the Crown sought to pack Parliament with easily controlled and pacified MPs, James certainly promoted the election of those sympathetic to the crown.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=53}} However, even in promoting sympathetic officials, there is evidence of an apathy towards this Parliament from the [[Privy Council]]: few of the expected preparations were made.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} After some Byzantine wrangling in which another better-qualified candidate was dropped, [[Ranulph Crewe]], judge and MP for the [[rotten borough|government-controlled borough]] of [[Saltash (UK Parliament constituency)|Saltash]], was chosen at the last minute to be the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]].{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=41\u201342}} This was a surprising choice: Crewe's previous experience in Parliament was limited to a short stint as an MP in [[9th Parliament of Queen Elizabeth I|1597\u201398]] and an appearance on two minor legal counsels, his legal career was no more impressive.{{sfn|Hunneyball|2010}} Crewe's inexperience was no doubt among the factors that allowed Parliament to descend into the disorder that Parliament, as it rapidly did.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=169}} James's most senior representative in the House of Commons, [[Ralph Winwood]], [[Secretary of State (England)|Secretary of State]], was announced similarly late.

For a brief period, this investigation dominated the Commons: Parry was suspended from the House and, passingly, from his Chancellorship. For many in parliament, this seemed evidence enough that the king's officials had attempted to pack Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}}{{sfn|Seddon|2008}} Simultaneously, a [[Parliamentary committees of the United Kingdom|committee]] to inquire into the alleged undertaking was launched, though this proved less fruitful.

However, Parliamentary provocateur [[John Hoskins (poet)|John Hoskins]] demanded further investigation, which the House accepted.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} On 14 May, the inquiry ended; after six weeks of Parliament, rumours of an undertaking had finally been dismissed.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} By the end, resentment against the undertakers had dissipated, and Neville was never suspended for his part, but rather met with commendation from Parliament in his efforts to remedy its grievances.

After five days of debate, the Lords returned with their formal refusal of such a conference, meeting with the astonishment of many.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} The Lords had voted 39 to 30 against it, carried by the near unanimity of the Bishops against this conference.{{efn|Out of the 17 [[prelates]] who voted, all but one opposed the conference, namely the old-fashioned [[Archbishop of York]], [[Tobias Matthew]].{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}}}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}} [[Lord Spiritual]] [[Richard Neile]], who was one of the most vocal opponents of the conference,{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=116\u2013117}} added insult to injury with a sharp speech condemning the petitioners.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}} The remarks made in this speech, known as the \"{{lang|la|Noli me tangere}} speech\", have been described by one historian as \"the most dangerous words used in the reign [of James I] by any politician.\"{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=228}} The Commons refused to conduct any more business until Neile had been punished for this affront.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} Though the Commons received a tearful apology and retraction from the Bishop on 30 May, they were unsatisfied, and doubled down on their demands of disciplinary action.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=130\u2013131}} By the end of May, as Moir put it, \"the temper of the Commons had reached a fever pitch\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=132}} and leadership had broken down in this intractable atmosphere.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=132\u2013133}} No punishment for Neile, however, ever materialised, and the king was growing impatient with Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\n===Finale: James grows impatient===\n[[File:Henry Howard Earl of Northampton circle of Gheeraerts.JPG|right|thumb|[[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton]]'s wishes were finally fulfilled on his deathbed, as James dissolved Parliament and looked for Spanish support.]]\n\nParliament was adjourned on 1 June for [[Ascension Day]], reconvening again on 3 June.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} When the Commons met on this day, they received an ultimatum from the king: unless Parliament agreed to grant him a financial supply soon, he would dissolve Parliament on 9 June.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=136}} James expected this to shock the Commons into pursuing his aims, but instead it only entrenched the opposition further into its obstinancy. Many felt this demand was a bluff; the king was stil deeply in debt, and Parliamentary subsidies still seemed his only way out. Instead of effecting any subsidies, the Commons attacked the king mercilessly. His Court, especially the Scots, were accused of extravagance, suggesting the king would have no need for impositions or subsidies if not for these subjects.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} As one member memorably pronounced, James's courtiers were \"spaniels to the king and wolves to the people\".{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=229}} Possibly encouraged by Northampton,{{efn|According to Moir, Hoskins here \"seems to have been simply the tool of the pro-Spanish [i.e. Northampton's] interests.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} The provocative historical reference was submitted by two of Northampton's lackeys: [[Lionel Sharpe]], [[Sir Charles Cornwallis (diplomat)|Sir Charles Cornwallis]]. Gardiner alleges he was not the most historically learned member, and likely misunderstood the insinuation of the reference. Either way, Hoskins was promised the protection of Northampton (and possibly Somerset) and was perhaps given a \u00a320 bribe.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} This interpretation has been questioned by Peck, who asserts that Hoskyns' misunderstanding of the allusion was \"unlikely\" given his educational background, and Hoskyns was a known opponent of Scottish influence. Thus, in her view: \"it seems more reasonable to view Hoskyns not as the innocent tool or victim of the pro-Spanish interests, but as a member of the Commons who agreed with the idea of sending home the Scots\".{{sfn|Peck|1981|p=550}}}}           Hoskins grimly hinted that the lives of these Scottish courtiers were in danger, alluding to the ethnic massacre of the [[Anjou|Angevins]] in the [[Sicilian Vespers]]; this was communicated to the king as a threat to the life of himself and his closest friends, such that he likely feared himself in danger of assassination.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}} One MP, Sir Thomas Roe, was more prescient, if somewhat melodramatic, in his judgement that the impending dissolution would be \"the ending, not only of this, but of all Parliaments\".{{sfn|Thrush|2014}} The Commons issued their own ultimatum to James: if he abolished impositions, \"wherewith the whole kingdom doth groan\", they would give him financial support.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\nHowever, James was in no position to give up such a source of income.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} While the anti-Northampton faction pleaded with the king to [[Prorogation in the United Kingdom|prorogue]] rather than dissolve Parliament, the king visited Northampton on his deathbed. Northampton persuaded the desperate king to dissolve Parliament, and shortly after James contacted the Spanish Ambassador, [[Diego Sarmiento de Acu\u00f1a, 1st Count of Gondomar|the Count of Gondomar]], to be assured of Spain's support. James dissolved Parliament on 7 June 1614.

Lasting only two months and two days, it saw no bills pass and was not even regarded as a Parliament by its contemporaries. However, for this legislative failure it has been known to posterity as the '''Addled Parliament'''.\n\nJames had struggled with debt ever since he came to the English throne. The failure of the [[Blessed Parliament]] of 1604\u20131610 to, in its six-year sitting, rescue the king from his mounting debt or allow James to unite his two kingdoms, had left him bitter with the body. The four-year hiatus between Parliaments saw the royal debt and deficit grow further, despite the best efforts of [[Lord High Treasurer|Treasurer]] [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]. The failure of the last and most lucrative financial expedient of this period, a foreign [[dowry]] from the marriage of his [[heir-apparent]], finally convinced James to recall Parliament in early 1614.\n\nThe Parliament got off to a bad start, with poor choices made for the king's representatives in Parliament. Rumours of conspiracy to manage (the \"undertaking\") or pack the Parliament for the king, though not based in fact, spread quickly. The spreading of this rumour, and the ultimate failure of Parliament, has been generally attributed to the scheming of the [[crypto-Catholic]] [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]], though this allegation has met with some recent skepticism. Parliament opened on 5 April and, despite the king's wishes it would be a \"Parliament of Love\", flung itself immediately into the controversy over the conspiracies, splitting parliament and leading to the exclusion of one alleged packer. However, by late April, Parliament had moved on to a familiar controversy, that of [[impositions]]. [[House of Commons of England|The Commons]] were pitted against [[House of Lords of England|the Lords]], culminating in a controversy over an unrestrained speech by one prelate.\n\nJames grew impatient with the Parliamentary proceedings. He issued an ultimatum to Parliament, but they treated it irreverently. Insult was added to injury by belligerent, and supposedly threatening, attacks on him from the Commons. On the advice of Northampton, James dissolved Parliament on 7 June, and had 4 [[MP (UK)|MP]]s sent to the [[Tower of London]]. James devised new financial expedients to settle his still-growing debt, to little success. [[Historiographically]], historians are divided between the [[Whig history|Whiggish]] view of the Parliament as anticipating the constitutional disputes of future Parliaments, and the [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] view of it as a conflict primarily concerned with James's finances.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|James VI and I|Blessed Parliament}}\n[[File:King James I of England and VI of Scotland in Parliament by Renold or Reginold Elstrack (Elstracke).jpg|left|thumb|King James I at the [[Blessed Parliament]] on 5 November 1605.]]\nJames VI and I (1566\u20131625) ascended to the [[List of Scottish monarchs|Scottish throne]] on 24 July 1567, and subsequently to the [[List of English monarchs|English and Irish throne]] on 24 March 1603, becoming [[Union of the Crowns|the first king of to reign over both kingdoms]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} James inherited, with the latter throne, a national debt to the amount of \u00a3300,000, a sum that only increased during his reign. By 1608, it stood at \u00a31 million. During his predecessor [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s reign, the inward revenue of the crown had steadily fallen; taxes from customs and land were consistently undervalued and the parliamentary subsidies steadily shrank.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It did not help that James reigned as \"one of the most extravagant kings\" in English history.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} In peace, Elizabeth's yearly expenditure never rose above \u00a3300,000; almost immediately after James took the throne, it was at \u00a3400,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} James had instituted various extra-parliamentary plans to recuperate this lost income, but these drew controversy from Parliament, and James still wanted for money.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} Moreover, James was keen to not be \"a husband to two wives\" as king, and to unite his crowns as one kingdom of [[Great Britain]];{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} as his slogan went: \"one king, one people, and one law\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}{{efn|In James's original Latinism: \"{{lang|la|Unus Rex}} [...] {{lang|la|Unus Grex}} and {{lang|la|Una Lex}}\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}}} The first parliament of his reign, also known as the Blessed Parliament, was called in 1604; it took seven years, with proceeding through five sessions, before James dissolved it,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} ending unsatisfactorily for both king and Parliament.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In the first session, many members feared James's unification would lead to the dissolution of the English [[Common Law]] system. Though many prominent politicians publicly praised the idea of unification and MPs accepted a commission to investigate the union early in Parliament, James's proposed title of the \"king of Great Britain\" was rejected outright.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} Between the first and second sessions, in October 1604, James assumed the title of king of Great Britain by proclamation, controversially circumventing parliament. Unification was not brought up at the second session, in hopes of assuaging outrage,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but by the end of the third session, proposals for unification faced such criticism from MPs that the idea was practically dead.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It was quietly dropped from discussion in the fourth and fifth sessions.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}\n\n[[File:John de Critz Robert Cecil Earl of Salisbury c 1608.png||thumb|[[Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury]] depicted with the white staff of a [[Lord High Treasurer]]. Though a skilled treasurer, Salisbury was unable to significantly reduce the Crown's crippling debt before his death.]]\n\nDuring the Blessed Parliament, Parliament's own aims saw similar disappointment; James rebuffed the proposed institution of Puritan ecclesiastical reforms,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} and failed to address two unpopular royal rights, [[purveyance]] and [[wardship]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{efn|According to Andrew Thrush of [[The History of Parliament]]: \"Purveyance was the right of the Crown to take up provisions for the royal household at below the market rate, while wardship was the right of the Crown to manage the estates of minors whose lands were held of the king.\"{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}}} In the second session, Parliament granted the king a subsidy of \u00a3400,000, keen to exhibit royal support in the wake of the [[Gunpowder Plot]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but thanks to the reduction of these subsidies under Elizabeth, this was rather less than the king desired.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} After a 3-year delay between sessions due to [[Bubonic plague|plague]], the fourth session was called in February 1610, and was dominated by financial discussion. [[Lord High Treasurer]], [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]] proposed the [[Great Contract]]: a financial plan wherein Parliament would grant the Crown \u00a3600,000 immediately (to pay off its debts) and an annual stipend of \u00a3200,000 thereafter; in return, the king was to abolish ten feudal dues, among them, purveyance. After much haggling, in which wardship was added to the abolished dues, the session adjourned on a supportive note. However, when the next session began, support had cooled. Parliament refused to give an annual stipend unless James abolished [[impositions]] as well.{{efn|The feudal duty of impositions were an invaluable source of extra-parliamentary income for James, bringing the Crown \u00a370,000 a year. This sum would only increase with the growth of trade in England;{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} by the 1630s, they brought the king \u00a3218,000 a year.{{sfn|Russell|1990|p=39}}}} Parliament did give the king an immediate subsidy, but the proposed \u00a3600,000 was reduced to a mere \u00a3100,000. By 6 November 1610, James demanded the other \u00a3500,000 and conditioned that, if impositions were to be abolished, Parliament would have to supply him with another equally lucrative income source. Parliament was outraged, and the Contract was abandoned three days later. Though both Salisbury and James made conciliatory gestures in hopes of securing any more financial support from Parliament, James grew impatient. On 31 December 1610, James publicly proclaimed the dissolution of the Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} James's first parliament had ended on a bitter note; \"your greatest error\", he chastised Salisbury, \"hath been that ye ever expected to draw honey out of gall.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=80}}\n\nAfter this, James was not keen to call another Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} However, without Parliament to raise taxes, the treasury was forced to find new ways to raise money.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In 1611, the City of London loaned the Crown \u00a3100,000; \u00a360,000 was extracted from [[Louis XIII of France|the King of France]] over debts accumulated in the reign of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]; [[Honour#Awards|honours]] were sold to wealthy gentlemen, raising \u00a390,000; a forced loan was levied on nearly 10,000 people.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|pp=148\u2013149}} Yet, after the death of Treasurer Salisbury in 1612, England's finances still remained destitute, with a debt of \u00a3500,000 and annual [[Deficit spending|deficit]] of \u00a3160,000.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|p=149}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=10}} However, James's principal fiscal expedient was to be the marriage of his [[heir-apparent]], [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry, Prince of Wales]], for which he expected a sizeable [[dowry]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} not to mention a foreign ally.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=84}} James went into talks with several Catholic countries but, in late 1612, aged 18, Henry contracted [[typhoid]] and abruptly died;{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=85}} [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]], newly heir-apparent at age 12, took his place in the negotiations. Negotiations were going most promisingly in France, where a marriage of Prince Charles to the 6-year-old Princess [[Christine of France]] promised a healthy sum of \u00a3240,000, almost halving James's debt.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} However, by early 1614, France's internal religious strife had intensified to such a point that civil war seemed imminent, so negotiations stalled on the French side; James grew impatient.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James's financial insecurity had only worsened in this time, the debt now at \u00a3680,000 and the deficit, \u00a3200,000.{{sfn|Roberts|1985|p=7}} [[Conspicuous consumption]] had raised yearly expenditure to an unsustainable \u00a3522,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|pp=98\u201399}} A group of advisors, led by the [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Earls of Suffolk]] and [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|Pembroke]], encouraged the king to call a Parliament to raise funds, convincing James \"that\"\u2014as he later put it\u2014\"my subjects did not hate me, which I know I had not deserved.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Northampton stringently opposed this summoning,{{sfn|Cramsie|2002|p=135}} but, in 1614, James reluctantly summoned another parliament. [[Writs of election]] were issued on 19 February that year.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\n==Parliament==\n\n===Prologue===\n[[File:Randolph Crewe by Peter Lely.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ranulph Crewe]], [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]] for the Addled Parliament. Crewe was a surprising choice for Speaker, a last minute pick with little previous experience.]]\n\nThe Privy Council as a whole was not optimistic about the upcoming parliament. Two of the king's closest advisors were unavailable, the Earls of Salisbury was dead and Northampton was ill.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Even Suffolk and Pembroke were clueless of any way to prevent Parliament from bringing up thorny issues such as impositions again.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} However, two Councillors were to provide advice to the king over his new parliament, which would prove significant.{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] [[Sir Francis Bacon]], who had been among the most vocal in favour of calling Parliament, blamed Salisbury entirely for the failure of the previous Parliament, privately holding the treasurer had undermine his early career. He asserted that Salisbury's deal-making had been the king's downfall, and that the king should approach Parliament as a king, rather than a merchant, and request subsidies on the basis of the Commons' good will.{{sfn|Willson|1967|pp=344\u2013345}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|pp=251\u2013252}} Bacon added to this that the king should employ patronage to win over the men of Parliament to his side.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=489}} [[Sir Henry Neville (died 1615)|Sir Henry Neville]] offered advice to the king on how to warm relations with Parliament, which he accepted amiably.{{sfn|Thrush|2010c}} But Neville's more portentous offer was that of an \"undertaking\", whereby Neville and a group of \"patriots\" would arrange to manage the Parliament in James's favour, in return for the office of Secretary of State.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} James rejected the undertaking derisively, and no such conspiracy was ever arranged,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} but rumours of its actual occurrence spread quickly in the lead up to Parliament.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=491}}\n\nMPs later accused James of trying to [[wikt:pack#Verb|pack]] the Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=52}} Indeed, Bacon had plainly advised the king on the \"placing of persons well-affected and discreet\" in Parliament,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=221\u2013222}} and James was unapologetic in packing the Irish Parliament the previous year.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93}}{{efn|James attempted to pack the Irish Parliament of 1613 with Protestants by adding a 84 new seats to the former 148 that election: 38 represented tiny or as-yet nonexistent settlements in the Protestant [[Ulster plantation]].

For a brief period, this investigation dominated the Commons: Parry was suspended from the House and, passingly, from his Chancellorship. For many in parliament, this seemed evidence enough that the king's officials had attempted to pack Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}}{{sfn|Seddon|2008}} Simultaneously, a [[Parliamentary committees of the United Kingdom|committee]] to inquire into the alleged undertaking was launched, though this proved less fruitful. The committee's chairman returned on 2 May; he spoke confusingly, but concluded against the existence of any undertaking. However, Parliamentary provocateur [[John Hoskins (poet)|John Hoskins]] demanded further investigation, which the House accepted.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} On 14 May, the inquiry ended; after six weeks of Parliament, rumours of an undertaking had finally been dismissed.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} By the end, resentment against the undertakers had dissipated, and Neville was never suspended for his part, but rather met with commendation from Parliament in his efforts to remedy its grievances.

After five days of debate, the Lords returned with their formal refusal of such a conference, meeting with the astonishment of many.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} The Lords had voted 39 to 30 against it, carried by the near unanimity of the Bishops against this conference.{{efn|Out of the 17 [[prelates]] who voted, all but one opposed the conference, namely the old-fashioned [[Archbishop of York]], [[Tobias Matthew]].{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}}}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}} [[Lord Spiritual]] [[Richard Neile]], who was one of the most vocal opponents of the conference,{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=116\u2013117}} added insult to injury with a sharp speech condemning the petitioners.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}} The remarks made in this speech, known as the \"{{lang|la|Noli me tangere}} speech\", have been described by one historian as \"the most dangerous words used in the reign [of James I] by any politician.\"{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=228}} The Commons refused to conduct any more business until Neile had been punished for this affront.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} Though the Commons received a tearful apology and retraction from the Bishop on 30 May, they were unsatisfied, and doubled down on their demands of disciplinary action.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=130\u2013131}} By the end of May, as Moir put it, \"the temper of the Commons had reached a fever pitch\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=132}} and leadership had broken down in this intractable atmosphere.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=132\u2013133}} No punishment for Neile, however, ever materialised, and the king was growing impatient with Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\n===Finale: James grows impatient===\n[[File:Henry Howard Earl of Northampton circle of Gheeraerts.JPG|right|thumb|[[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton]]'s wishes were finally fulfilled on his deathbed, as James dissolved Parliament and looked for Spanish support.]]\n\nParliament was adjourned on 1 June for [[Ascension Day]], reconvening again on 3 June.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} When the Commons met on this day, they received an ultimatum from the king: unless Parliament agreed to grant him a financial supply soon, he would dissolve Parliament on 9 June.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=136}} James expected this to shock the Commons into pursuing his aims, but instead it only entrenched the opposition further into its obstinancy. Many felt this demand was a bluff; the king was stil deeply in debt, and Parliamentary subsidies still seemed his only way out. Instead of effecting any subsidies, the Commons attacked the king mercilessly. His Court, especially the Scots, were accused of extravagance, suggesting the king would have no need for impositions or subsidies if not for these subjects.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} As one member memorably pronounced, James's courtiers were \"spaniels to the king and wolves to the people\".{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=229}} Possibly encouraged by Northampton,{{efn|According to Moir, Hoskins here \"seems to have been simply the tool of the pro-Spanish [i.e. Northampton's] interests.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} The provocative historical reference was submitted by two of Northampton's lackeys: [[Lionel Sharpe]], [[Sir Charles Cornwallis (diplomat)|Sir Charles Cornwallis]]. Gardiner alleges he was not the most historically learned member, and likely misunderstood the insinuation of the reference. Either way, Hoskins was promised the protection of Northampton (and possibly Somerset) and was perhaps given a \u00a320 bribe.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} This interpretation has been questioned by Peck, who asserts that Hoskyns' misunderstanding of the allusion was \"unlikely\" given his educational background, and Hoskyns was a known opponent of Scottish influence. Thus, in her view: \"it seems more reasonable to view Hoskyns not as the innocent tool or victim of the pro-Spanish interests, but as a member of the Commons who agreed with the idea of sending home the Scots\".{{sfn|Peck|1981|p=550}}}}           Hoskins grimly hinted that the lives of these Scottish courtiers were in danger, alluding to the ethnic massacre of the [[Anjou|Angevins]] in the [[Sicilian Vespers]]; this was communicated to the king as a threat to the life of himself and his closest friends, such that he likely feared himself in danger of assassination.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}} One MP, Sir Thomas Roe, was more prescient, if somewhat melodramatic, in his judgement that the impending dissolution would be \"the ending, not only of this, but of all Parliaments\".{{sfn|Thrush|2014}} The Commons issued their own ultimatum to James: if he abolished impositions, \"wherewith the whole kingdom doth groan\", they would give him financial support.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\nHowever, James was in no position to give up such a source of income.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} While the anti-Northampton faction pleaded with the king to [[Prorogation in the United Kingdom|prorogue]] rather than dissolve Parliament, the king visited Northampton on his deathbed. Northampton persuaded the desperate king to dissolve Parliament, and shortly after James contacted the Spanish Ambassador, [[Diego Sarmiento de Acu\u00f1a, 1st Count of Gondomar|the Count of Gondomar]], to be assured of Spain's support. James dissolved Parliament on 7 June 1614. Northampton was finally gratified, seeing the end of the Addled Parliament little more than a week before he died.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}} The Parliament had elapsed without any bill being passed with [[royal assent]], and thus was not constitutionally a Parliament.
