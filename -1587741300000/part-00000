The disease is caused by the ''[[Francisella tularensis]]'' bacterium, and can be contracted through contact with [[fur]], inhalation, ingestion of contaminated water or insect bites. ''Francisella tularensis'' is very infectious. A small number of organisms (10\u201350 or so) can cause disease. If ''F. tularensis'' were used as a weapon, the bacteria would likely be made airborne for exposure by inhalation. People who inhale an infectious aerosol would generally experience severe respiratory illness, including life-threatening pneumonia and systemic infection, if they are not treated. The bacteria that cause tularemia occur widely in nature and could be isolated and grown in quantity in a laboratory, although manufacturing an effective aerosol weapon would require considerable sophistication.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/tularemia/facts.asp|title=CDC Tularemia - Key Facts About Tularemia|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619165524/http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/tularemia/facts.asp|archivedate=2010-06-19}}</ref>\n* [[Anthrax disease|Anthrax]]: Anthrax is a non-contagious disease caused by the spore-forming bacterium ''Bacillus anthracis''.

Until recently in the United States, most biological defense strategies have been geared to protecting soldiers on the battlefield rather than ordinary people in cities. Financial cutbacks have limited the tracking of disease outbreaks.

This occurs primarily through the efforts of the [[DHS Office of Health Affairs|Office of Health Affairs]] (OHA), a part of the [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS), whose role is to prepare for an emergency situation that impacts the health of the American populace. Detection has two primary technological factors. First there is OHA's BioWatch program in which collection devices are disseminated to thirty high risk areas throughout the country to detect the presence of aerosolized biological agents before symptoms present in patients.<ref name=\"PrepX\">United States.

This advancement is significant simply because it enables action to be taken in four to six hours due to its automatic response system, whereas the previous system required aerosol detectors to be manually transported to laboratories.<ref name=\"PrepX\"/> Resilience is a multifaceted issue as well, as addressed by OHA. One way in which this is ensured is through exercises that establish preparedness; programs like the Anthrax Response Exercise Series exist to ensure that, regardless of the incident, all emergency personnel will be aware of the role they must fill.<ref name=\"PrepX\"/> Moreover, by providing information and education to public leaders, emergency medical services and all employees of the DHS, OHS suggests it can significantly decrease the impact of bioterrorism.<ref name=\"PrepX\"/>\n*Enhancing the technological capabilities of first responders is accomplished through numerous strategies. The first of these strategies was developed by the Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) of DHS to ensure that the danger of suspicious powders could be effectively assessed, (as many dangerous biological agents such as anthrax exist as a white powder). By testing the accuracy and specificity of commercially available systems used by first responders, the hope is that all biologically harmful powders can be rendered ineffective.<ref name=\"PrepY\">United States.

One recent advancement is the commercialization of a new form of Tyvex\u2122 armor which protects first responders and patients from chemical and biological contaminants. There has also been a new generation of Self-Contained Breathing Apparatuses (SCBA) which has been recently made more robust against bioterrorism agents. All of these technologies combine to form what seems like a relatively strong deterrent to bioterrorism. However, New York City as an entity has numerous organizations and strategies that effectively serve to deter and respond to bioterrorism as it comes.

He explains how, even though the United States would be better fending off bioterrorist attacks now than they would be a decade ago, the amount of money available to fight bioterrorism over the last three years has begun to decrease. Looking at a detailed report that examined the funding decrease for bioterrorism in fifty-one American cities, Dr. Gupta stated that the cities \"wouldn\u2019t be able to distribute vaccines as well\" and \"wouldn't be able to track viruses.\" He also said that film portrayals of global pandemics, such as ''[[Contagion (2011 film)|Contagion]]'', were actually quite possible and may occur in the United States under the right conditions.<ref>John King, USA.

The broadcast stated that a bipartisan report gave the Obama administration a failing grade for its efforts to respond to a bioterrorist attack. The news broadcast invited the former New York City police commissioner, Howard Safir, to explain how the government would fare in combating such an attack. He said how \"biological and chemical weapons are probable and relatively easy to disperse.\" Furthermore, Safir thought that efficiency in bioterrorism preparedness is not necessarily a question of money, but is instead dependent on putting resources in the right places.

He implored the U.S. government to take the proper and necessary actions to implement a strategic plan of action to save as many lives as possible and to safeguard against potential chaos and confusion. He believes that because there have been no significant instances of bioterrorism since the anthrax attacks in 2001, the government has allowed itself to become complacent making the country that much more vulnerable to unsuspecting attacks, thereby further endangering the lives of U.S. citizens.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/biological-threats/19645-rands-gerstein-u-s-needs-biodefense-strategy-protect-terror-threats/|title=RAND's Gerstein: U.S. needs biodefense strategy to protect against terror threats|last=Rozens|first=Tracy|date=2016-09-02|website=Homeland Preparedness News|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-19}}</ref>\n\nGerstein formerly served in the Science and Technology Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security from 2011 to 2014.

This system is essentially a way of tracking disease progression throughout New York City, and was developed by the [[New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene]] (NYC DOHMH) in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. The system works by tracking the symptoms of those taken into the emergency department\u2014based on the location of the hospital to which they are taken and their home address\u2014and assessing any patterns in symptoms. These established trends can then be observed by medical epidemiologists to determine if there are any disease outbreaks in any particular locales; maps of disease prevalence can then be created rather easily.<ref>Chen, H, D Zeng, and Y Pan. \"Infectious Disease Informatics: Syndromic Surveillance for Public Health and Bio-Defense.\" 20120, XXII, 209p. 68 illus.., Hardcover.</ref> This is an obviously beneficial tool in fighting bioterrorism as it provides a means through which such attacks could be discovered in their nascence; assuming bioterrorist attacks result in similar symptoms across the board, this strategy allows New York City to respond immediately to any bioterrorist threats that they may face with some level of alacrity.\n\n==Response to bioterrorism incident or threat==\n{{Globalize|section|USA|2name=the United States|date=June 2012}}\nGovernment agencies which would be called on to respond to a bioterrorism incident would include law enforcement, hazardous materials and decontamination units, and emergency medical units, if available.\n\nThe US military has specialized units, which can respond to a bioterrorism event; among them are the [[United States Marine Corps]]' [[Chemical Biological Incident Response Force]] and the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]'s [[20th Support Command (CBRNE)]], which can detect, identify, and neutralize threats, and [[decontamination|decontaminate]] victims exposed to bioterror agents.

One way in which this is ensured is through exercises that establish preparedness; programs like the Anthrax Response Exercise Series exist to ensure that, regardless of the incident, all emergency personnel will be aware of the role they must fill.<ref name=\"PrepX\"/> Moreover, by providing information and education to public leaders, emergency medical services and all employees of the DHS, OHS suggests it can significantly decrease the impact of bioterrorism.<ref name=\"PrepX\"/>\n*Enhancing the technological capabilities of first responders is accomplished through numerous strategies. The first of these strategies was developed by the Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) of DHS to ensure that the danger of suspicious powders could be effectively assessed, (as many dangerous biological agents such as anthrax exist as a white powder). By testing the accuracy and specificity of commercially available systems used by first responders, the hope is that all biologically harmful powders can be rendered ineffective.<ref name=\"PrepY\">United States.

The broadcast stated that a bipartisan report gave the Obama administration a failing grade for its efforts to respond to a bioterrorist attack. The news broadcast invited the former New York City police commissioner, Howard Safir, to explain how the government would fare in combating such an attack. He said how \"biological and chemical weapons are probable and relatively easy to disperse.\" Furthermore, Safir thought that efficiency in bioterrorism preparedness is not necessarily a question of money, but is instead dependent on putting resources in the right places. The broadcast suggested that the nation was not ready for something more serious.<ref>MSNBC News Live. MSNBC. New York City. 26 Jan. 2010. Television</ref>\n\nIn a September 2016 interview conducted by Homeland Preparedness News, Daniel Gerstein, a senior policy researcher for the RAND Corporation, stresses the importance in preparing for potential bioterrorist attacks on the nation. He implored the U.S. government to take the proper and necessary actions to implement a strategic plan of action to save as many lives as possible and to safeguard against potential chaos and confusion. He believes that because there have been no significant instances of bioterrorism since the anthrax attacks in 2001, the government has allowed itself to become complacent making the country that much more vulnerable to unsuspecting attacks, thereby further endangering the lives of U.S. citizens.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/biological-threats/19645-rands-gerstein-u-s-needs-biodefense-strategy-protect-terror-threats/|title=RAND's Gerstein: U.S. needs biodefense strategy to protect against terror threats|last=Rozens|first=Tracy|date=2016-09-02|website=Homeland Preparedness News|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-19}}</ref>\n\nGerstein formerly served in the Science and Technology Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security from 2011 to 2014.

RODS is designed to collect data from many data sources and use them to perform signal detection, that is, to detect a possible bioterrorism event at the earliest possible moment. RODS, and other systems like it, collect data from sources including clinic data, laboratory data, and data from over-the-counter drug sales.<ref name=\"WangerMRoleOfClinicalInformationSystems\">{{citation|last=Wagner|first=Michael M.|author2=Espino, Jeremy|title=Healthcare Information Management Systems|chapter-url=|edition=3|year=2004|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York|pages=513\u2013539|chapter=The role of clinical information systems in public health surveillance|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref name=\"WangerMAvailabilityAndComparativeValueOfData\">{{citation|last=Wagner|first=Michael M.|author2=Aryel, Ron|title=Availability and Comparative Value of Data Elements Required for an Effective Bioterrorism Detection System|url=http://rods.health.pitt.edu/LIBRARY/dato2AHRQInterimRpt112801.pdf|accessdate=2009-05-22|date=2001-11-28|publisher=Real-time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance Laboratory|display-authors=etal|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303223152/http://rods.health.pitt.edu/LIBRARY/dato2AHRQInterimRpt112801.pdf|archivedate=2011-03-03}}</ref> In 2000, Michael Wagner, the codirector of the RODS laboratory, and [[Ron Aryel]], a subcontractor, conceived the idea of obtaining live data feeds from \"non-traditional\" (non-health-care) data sources. The RODS laboratory's first efforts eventually led to the establishment of the National Retail Data Monitor, a system which collects data from 20,000 retail locations nationwide.<ref name=\"WangerMRoleOfClinicalInformationSystems\" />\n\nOn February 5, 2002, [[George W. Bush]] visited the RODS laboratory and used it as a model for a [[USD|$]]300 million spending proposal to equip all 50 states with biosurveillance systems. In a speech delivered at the nearby [[Masonic temple]], Bush compared the RODS system to a modern \"[[DEW]]\" line (referring to the Cold War ballistic missile early warning system).<ref>{{citation|last=Togyer|first=Jason|title=Pitt Magazine: Airborne Defense|url=http://www.pittmag.pitt.edu/june2002/feature1.html|accessdate=2009-05-22|date=June 2002|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616101219/http://www.pittmag.pitt.edu/june2002/feature1.html|archive-date=2010-06-16|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe principles and practices of biosurveillance, a new interdisciplinary science, were defined and described in the ''Handbook of Biosurveillance'', edited by Michael Wagner, Andrew Moore and Ron Aryel, and published in 2006. Biosurveillance is the science of real-time disease outbreak detection. Its principles apply to both natural and man-made epidemics (bioterrorism).\n\nData which potentially could assist in early detection of a bioterrorism event include many categories of information. Health-related data such as that from hospital computer systems, clinical laboratories, [[electronic health record]] systems, medical examiner record-keeping systems, 911 call center computers, and veterinary medical record systems could be of help; researchers are also considering the utility of data generated by [[ranching]] and [[feedlot]] operations, food processors, [[drinking water]] systems, school attendance recording, and physiologic monitors, among others.<ref name=\"WangerMAvailabilityAndComparativeValueOfData\" />\n\nIn [[Europe]], disease surveillance is beginning to be organized on the continent-wide scale needed to track a biological emergency. The system not only monitors infected persons, but attempts to discern the origin of the outbreak.\n\nResearchers have experimented with devices to detect the existence of a threat:\n\n* Tiny [[integrated circuit|electronic chips]] that would contain living [[neuron|nerve cells]] to warn of the presence of bacterial toxins (identification of broad range toxins)\n* [[Fiber-optic]] tubes lined with [[antibody|antibodies]] coupled to light-emitting molecules (identification of specific pathogens, such as anthrax, botulinum, ricin)\n\nSome research shows that ultraviolet [[avalanche photodiodes]] offer the high gain, reliability and robustness needed to detect anthrax and other bioterrorism agents in the air. The fabrication methods and device characteristics were described at the 50th Electronic Materials Conference in Santa Barbara on June 25, 2008. Details of the photodiodes were also published in the February 14, 2008 issue of the journal Electronics Letters and the November 2007 issue of the journal IEEE Photonics Technology Letters.<ref>[http://newswise.com/articles/view/541788/ Avalanche Photodiodes Target Bioterrorism Agents] Newswise, Retrieved on June 25, 2008.</ref>\n\nThe United States Department of Defense conducts global biosurveillance through several programs, including the Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System.<ref>Pellerin, Cheryl.

This system is essentially a way of tracking disease progression throughout New York City, and was developed by the [[New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene]] (NYC DOHMH) in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. The system works by tracking the symptoms of those taken into the emergency department\u2014based on the location of the hospital to which they are taken and their home address\u2014and assessing any patterns in symptoms. These established trends can then be observed by medical epidemiologists to determine if there are any disease outbreaks in any particular locales; maps of disease prevalence can then be created rather easily.<ref>Chen, H, D Zeng, and Y Pan. \"Infectious Disease Informatics: Syndromic Surveillance for Public Health and Bio-Defense.\" 20120, XXII, 209p. 68 illus.., Hardcover.</ref> This is an obviously beneficial tool in fighting bioterrorism as it provides a means through which such attacks could be discovered in their nascence; assuming bioterrorist attacks result in similar symptoms across the board, this strategy allows New York City to respond immediately to any bioterrorist threats that they may face with some level of alacrity.\n\n==Response to bioterrorism incident or threat==\n{{Globalize|section|USA|2name=the United States|date=June 2012}}\nGovernment agencies which would be called on to respond to a bioterrorism incident would include law enforcement, hazardous materials and decontamination units, and emergency medical units, if available.\n\nThe US military has specialized units, which can respond to a bioterrorism event; among them are the [[United States Marine Corps]]' [[Chemical Biological Incident Response Force]] and the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]'s [[20th Support Command (CBRNE)]], which can detect, identify, and neutralize threats, and [[decontamination|decontaminate]] victims exposed to bioterror agents. US response would include the [[Center for Disease Control]].\n\nHistorically, governments and authorities have relied on quarantines to protect their populations.

The episode was written by story editors Rob Des Hotel and Dean Batali, and directed by [[David Semel]]. The narrative follows [[Buffy Summers]] ([[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]), as she struggles to find a date and stop the rise of the [[Anointed One (Buffyverse)|Anointed One]].\n\n==Plot==\nOwen asks Buffy out on a date at The Bronze. Giles has found out about a prophecy from the symbol on a ring they found in the cemetery. He is convinced that the [[Anointed One (Buffyverse)|Anointed One]] will rise that night, and so despite Buffy's protests, they spend hours sitting on graves waiting for a vampire to rise. None does and though Giles is certain that his calculations are correct, he calls their stake-out quits. Buffy rushes to The Bronze, only to see Owen dancing with Cordelia.\n\nAt the same time, in a bus on the way to [[Sunnydale]], a man stands up and begins to lecture the other passengers on God's judgment, quoting prophecies. Suddenly, a vampire walks in front of the bus, causing it to crash. Other vampires swarm the wreck, attacking the passengers, including the religious fanatic.\n\nThe next morning, Owen asks Buffy out on another date and even gives her a pocket-watch so that she doesn't miss it this time. When evening comes, Giles shows up at Buffy's house, waving a newspaper that shows five people died when the bus crashed, among them the suspected murderer [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings#Vampires|Andrew Borba]], the man who was quoting prophecies. Buffy insists on going to the Bronze so Giles decides to check the Sunnydale funeral home himself. Unfortunately, there are vampires present to get the Anointed One, and they trap Giles in a room. Xander and [[Willow Rosenberg|Willow]] have followed him, though, and run back to The Bronze to get Buffy.\n\nThere, first Cordelia, then [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] tries to come in between Buffy and Owen. Finally, Xander and Willow managed to get her to come to the funeral home by pretending to be a couple that wants to do something daring on a double date. When Buffy figures out what has happened, she tries to ditch Owen, but unfortunately, he tags along. Even worse, he is present in the funeral home when Borba rises as a vampire. In the fight, Owen is knocked unconscious. Buffy kills Borba by sliding him into the lit furnace.\n\nThe next morning, Owen is excited about what they have been through and wants more\u2014this is what he likes about Buffy, he says, and almost being killed made him feel alive. She realizes that there is no way that she can have a relationship with him; sooner or later, he will get himself killed.\n\nGiles tries to comfort her by telling her what a burden it was for him as a ten-year-old to find out his destiny was to be a watcher when he would rather have been a fighter pilot\u2014or possibly a grocer.

The episode was written by story editors Rob Des Hotel and Dean Batali, and directed by [[David Semel]]. The narrative follows [[Buffy Summers]] ([[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]), as she struggles to find a date and stop the rise of the [[Anointed One (Buffyverse)|Anointed One]].\n\n==Plot==\nOwen asks Buffy out on a date at The Bronze. Giles has found out about a prophecy from the symbol on a ring they found in the cemetery. He is convinced that the [[Anointed One (Buffyverse)|Anointed One]] will rise that night, and so despite Buffy's protests, they spend hours sitting on graves waiting for a vampire to rise. None does and though Giles is certain that his calculations are correct, he calls their stake-out quits. Buffy rushes to The Bronze, only to see Owen dancing with Cordelia.\n\nAt the same time, in a bus on the way to [[Sunnydale]], a man stands up and begins to lecture the other passengers on God's judgment, quoting prophecies. Suddenly, a vampire walks in front of the bus, causing it to crash. Other vampires swarm the wreck, attacking the passengers, including the religious fanatic.\n\nThe next morning, Owen asks Buffy out on another date and even gives her a pocket-watch so that she doesn't miss it this time. When evening comes, Giles shows up at Buffy's house, waving a newspaper that shows five people died when the bus crashed, among them the suspected murderer [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings#Vampires|Andrew Borba]], the man who was quoting prophecies. Buffy insists on going to the Bronze so Giles decides to check the Sunnydale funeral home himself. Unfortunately, there are vampires present to get the Anointed One, and they trap Giles in a room. Xander and [[Willow Rosenberg|Willow]] have followed him, though, and run back to The Bronze to get Buffy.\n\nThere, first Cordelia, then [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] tries to come in between Buffy and Owen. Finally, Xander and Willow managed to get her to come to the funeral home by pretending to be a couple that wants to do something daring on a double date. When Buffy figures out what has happened, she tries to ditch Owen, but unfortunately, he tags along. Even worse, he is present in the funeral home when Borba rises as a vampire. In the fight, Owen is knocked unconscious. Buffy kills Borba by sliding him into the lit furnace.\n\nThe next morning, Owen is excited about what they have been through and wants more\u2014this is what he likes about Buffy, he says, and almost being killed made him feel alive. She realizes that there is no way that she can have a relationship with him; sooner or later, he will get himself killed.\n\nGiles tries to comfort her by telling her what a burden it was for him as a ten-year-old to find out his destiny was to be a watcher when he would rather have been a fighter pilot\u2014or possibly a grocer. Both agree that at least the Master will be unhappy, too, because the Anointed One was destroyed.\n\nBut in his underground lair, the Master is overjoyed as he welcomes the real Anointed One\u2014not Borba after all, but a young boy who was on the bus with him.\n\n==Production details==\nThe episode contributes to the season's plot by introducing [[Anointed One (Buffyverse)|The Anointed One]].\n\n===Music===\n*During scenes between Buffy and Owen at the Bronze, [[Velvet Chain]] is performing \"Strong\" and \"Treason\"<ref name=\"BBC trivia\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/buffy/indetail/neverkillaboy/trivia.shtml|title=Never Kill a Boy on the First Date: Trivia|publisher=BBC|accessdate=22 March 2013}}</ref> from their album ''Warm''. \n*When Cordelia and Owen dance, Three Day Wheely's \"Rotten Apple\" is playing. \n*When Angel warns Buffy about the threat, the song is \"Junkie Girl\" by [[Pretty Boy Floyd]] from their EP ''A Tale of Sex, Designer Drugs, and the Death of Rock N' Roll''.<ref>https://www.discogs.com/Pretty-Boy-Floyd-A-Tale-Of-Sex-Designer-Drugs-And-The-Death-Of-Rock-N-Roll/release/1783765</ref> \n*Finally, when Buffy rejects Owen at school, the song \"Let the Sun Fall Down\" by [[Kim Richey]] plays in the background.\n\n===Cultural references===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}\nThe Master says, \"Here endeth the lesson\".

([[Cicero]], ''2nd Philippic'', 2.118)\n\nOften there is a double antithesis, as in the following proverb, where \"man\" is opposed to \"God\", and \"proposes\" is contrasted with \"disposes\":\n\n*'''Man proposes''', '''God disposes'''. (anonymous)\n\nAnother type is of the form \"not A, but B\" (negative-positive), in which the point made is emphasised by first being contrasted with its negative:\n\n*I came not to bring '''peace''' but a '''sword'''. (St Matthew's Gospel, 10:34).\n\nAnother type involves a [[chiasmus]] (AB, BA word order), in which the contrasted words switch places:\n\n*In '''peace''' you are for '''war''', and in '''war''' you long for '''peace'''.\n*Two things show feebleness of mind: '''holding your breath''' at the time for '''speaking''', and '''speaking''' when you should be '''silent'''. ([[Saadi Shirazi|Saadi]])\n\nThe negative-positive antithesis and the chiasmus-antithesis can be combined, as in the following sentence:\n*Ask not what '''your country''' can do for '''you''' \u2013 ask what '''you''' can do for '''your country'''. \u2013 [[Inauguration of John F. Kennedy]], 1961.\n\nAn antithesis can also be combined with synonymous [[Parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]]. In the following example, the first (A, A') and second couplet (B, B') are parallel synonymously with the same adverb and verb combination distinguishing the couplets: \u201cstill do\u201d/\u201dstill be\u201d//\u201dstill do\u201d/\u201dstill be.\u201d An antithesis is formed with line A contrasting \u201cevil\u201d with \u201cright\u201d in line B.

([[Charles Dickens]], ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'')\n* We must learn to '''live together''' as '''brothers''' or '''perish together''' as '''fools'''. ([[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], speech at [[St. Louis]], 1964.)\n* The world will little note, nor long remember '''what we say here''', but it can never forget '''what they did here'''.

(King [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] at the [[Battle of Salamis]] (480 BC), according to [[Herodotus]] 8.88.3)\n* Senator, in everything I said about Iraq '''I''' turned out to be '''right''' and '''you''' turned out to be '''wrong'''. ([[George Galloway]] at a US Senate hearing, May 2005.)<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/4557279.stm BBC News online, 17 May 2005].</ref>\n* I'm not saying that '''this or that statue''' was stolen from there; I'm saying this, that you, Verres, left '''not one single statue''' in Aspendus.

[[Protestantism|Protestant]] scholars since the Reformation have generally believed that Jesus was setting his teaching over against false interpretations of the Law current at the time. \"Antithesis\" was the name given by [[Marcion of Sinope]] to a manifesto in which he contrasted the [[Old Testament]] with the [[New Testament]] and defined what came to be known as [[Marcionism]].\n\n== In philosophical discussion ==\n{{See also|Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|Dialectic}}\nIn [[dialectic]]s (any formal system of reasoning that arrives at the truth by the exchange of logical arguments) antithesis is the juxtaposition of contrasting ideas, usually in a balanced way.

Case citations are formatted differently in different [[jurisdiction]]s, but generally contain the same key information.\n\nA '''legal citation''' is a \"reference to a legal precedent or authority, such as a case, statute, or treatise, that either substantiates or contradicts a given position.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Black's Law Dictionary|year=2012|publisher=West|location=St. Paul, Minnesota|isbn=978-0-314-26578-4|edition=9th Abridged|editor-first=Bryan A.|editor-last=Garner|page=221}}</ref> Where cases are published on paper, the citation usually contains the following information:\n* Court that issued the decision\n* Report title\n* Volume number\n* Page, section, or paragraph number\n* Publication year\n\nIn some report series, for example in England, Australia and some in Canada, volumes are not numbered independently of the year: thus the year and volume number (usually no greater than 4) are required to identify which book of the series has the case reported within its covers. In such citations, it is usual in these jurisdictions to apply square [[bracket]]s \"{{bracket|year}}\" to the year (which may not be the year that the case was decided: for example, a case decided in December 2001 may have been reported in 2002).\n\nThe Internet brought with it the opportunity for courts to publish their decisions on websites and most published court decisions now appear in that way.  They can be found through many national and other websites, such as [[WorldLII]] and [https://www.africanlii.org/ AfricanLII], that are operated by members of the [[Free Access to Law Movement]].\n\nThe resulting flood of non-paginated information has led to numbering of paragraphs and the adoption of a medium-neutral citation system. This usually contains the following information:\n* Year of decision\n* Abbreviated title of the court\n* Decision number (not the court file number)\nRather than utilizing page numbers for pinpoint references, which would depend upon particular printers and [[Web browser|browser]]s, pinpoint quotations refer to paragraph numbers.\n\n==Pronunciation of case titles==\n\nIn [[common law]] countries with an [[adversarial system]] of justice, the names of the opposing parties are separated in the case title by the abbreviation ''v'' (usually written as ''v'' in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries and always as ''v.'' in the U.S.) of the Latin word ''versus'', which means ''against''. When case titles are read out loud, the ''v'' can be pronounced, depending on the context, as ''and'', ''against'', ''versus'', or ''vee''.\n\n===Commonwealth pronunciation===\n\nSome Commonwealth countries follow English legal style:\n\n* [[Civil law (common law)|Civil cases]] are pronounced with ''and''. For example, ''Smith v Jones'' would be pronounced \"Smith {{em|and}} Jones\".<ref name=\":0\">[[SOAS University of London|School of Oriental & African Studies]] (SOAS) Library, ''[http://www.soas.ac.uk/library/subjects/law/research/file70250.pdf Understanding UK Case Law]'', Research Guide (London: SOAS Library, August 2012), pp. 5\u20136. 'The small letter \u201cv\u201d is an abbreviation of versus. However, the term \u201cand\u201d is used to pronounce it, rather than \u201cv\u201d or \u201cversus\u201d, e.g. the case \u201cSmith v Jones\u201d would be pronounced \u201cSmith and Jones.\u201d . . . A [criminal] case can be pronounced in a number of ways, e.g. \u201cR. v Smith\u201d would be pronounced either \u201cthe Crown against Smith\u201d, or it can be referred to as simply \u201cSmith.\u201d\u2009'</ref>\n* [[Criminal law|Criminal cases]] are pronounced with ''against''. For example, ''R v Smith'' would be pronounced \"the Crown {{em|against}} Smith\".<ref name=\":0\" /> The Latin words ''Rex'', ''Regina'', and ''versus'' are all rendered into English.\n* ''Versus'' and ''vee'' are incorrect.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Melbourne University Law Review Association|title=Australian Guide to Legal Citation|date=2010|isbn=9780646527390|page=43|edition=3rd|url=http://law.unimelb.edu.au/mulr/aglc|quote=In speech, the 'v' between the parties' names is rendered 'and' in a civil action and 'against' in a criminal action both in Australia and the United Kingdom. It is not pronounced 'versus' as it is in the United States of America.}}</ref>\n\n===American pronunciation===\n\nIn the United States, there is no consensus on the pronunciation of the abbreviation ''v.'' This has led to much confusion about the pronunciation and spelling of court cases:<ref name=\"nyt1989\">{{cite news|title=On Language: Child's Garden of Vs.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/04/magazine/on-language-child-s-garden-of-vs.html|agency=The New York Times|date=June 4, 1989}}</ref>\n\n* ''Versus'' is most commonly used, leading some newspapers to use the common abbreviation ''vs.'' in place of the legal abbreviation ''v.''<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kuttner|first1=Robert|title=How the Airlines Became Abusive Cartels|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/17/opinion/how-the-airlines-became-abusive-cartels.html|work=The New York Times|date=17 April 2017|quote=Today\u2019s auction system on oversold flights, ironically, is the stepchild of a 1976 Supreme Court case, Nader vs. Allegheny, in which the late and little lamented Allegheny Airlines (known to its long suffering passengers as Agony Airlines) picked the wrong passenger to bump.}}</ref>\n* ''Vee'' is also heard but is not as common.\n* ''Against'' is a matter of personal style. For example, [[Warren E. Burger]] and [[John Paul Stevens]] preferred to announce cases at the Supreme Court with ''against''.<ref name=oyez_betamax>{{cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1982/81-1687|title=''Sony Corporation of America v.

Casey]]'' (1992), the participants demonstrated the lack of consensus by using different pronunciations of ''v.'' Solicitor General [[Ken Starr]] even managed to use all three of the most common American pronunciations interchangeably:<ref name=oyez_casey>{{cite web|title=''Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v.

Well, I think that that is the necessary consequence of Roe ''vee'' Wade.}}\n\n==Australia==\nLegal citation in Australia generally mirrors the methods of citation used in [[England]]. A widely used guide to Australian legal citation is the ''[[Australian Guide to Legal Citation]]'' (commonly known as AGLC), published jointly by the ''[[Melbourne University Law Review]]'' and the ''[[Melbourne Journal of International Law]]''.\n\nThe standard case citation format in Australia is:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ''Style of cause''\n! (year of decision)\n! [year of report]\n! volume\n! report\n! (series)\n! page\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| ''[[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)]]''\n| (1992)\n|\n| 175\n| CLR\n|\n| 1.\n|}\n\nAs in Canada, there has been divergence among citation styles. There exist commercial citation guides published by Butterworths and other legal publishing companies, academic citation styles and court citation styles. Each court in Australia may cite the same case slightly differently. There is presently a movement in convergence to the comprehensive academic citation style of the [[Australian Guide to Legal Citation]] published jointly by the ''[[Melbourne University Law Review]]'' and the ''[[Melbourne Journal of International Law]]''.\n\n===Reports===\n{{main list|List of Law Reports in Australia}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The format provides a naming system that does not depend on the publication of the case in a law report.  Most cases are now published on AustLII using neutral citations.<ref name=\"austlii\">[http://austlii.edu.au Austlii.edu.au]</ref>\n\nThe standard format looks like this:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year of decision\n!Court identifier\n!Ordinal number\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|[2005]\n|HCA\n|1\n|}\nSo the above-mentioned ''Mabo'' case would then be cited like this: ''Mabo v Queensland (No 2)'' [1992] HCA 23.\n\nThere is a unique court identifier code for most courts.

Many legal publishing companies and schools have their own standard for citation. Since the late 1990s, however, much of the legal community has converged to a single standard\u2014formulated in ''[[The Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation|The Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation / Manuel canadien de la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence juridique]]'',<ref>''Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation / Manuel canadien de la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence juridique'', 9th ed. (Carswell, 2018-06-29), {{ISBN|978-0-7798-8582-4}}.</ref> commonly known as the \"[[McGill Guide]]\" after the ''[[McGill Law Journal]]'', which first published it. The following format reflects this standard:\n\n:''[[Hunter v. Southam|Hunter v Southam]]'', [1984] 2 SCR 145.\n\nBroken into its component parts, the format is:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ''Style of cause''\n! (year of decision),\n! [year of report]\n! volume\n! report\n! (series)\n! page\n! jurisdiction/court.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| ''[[R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.|R v Big M Drug Mart Ltd]]'',\n|\n| [1985]\n| 1\n| SCR\n|\n| 295.\n|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| ''[[R. v. Oakes|R v Oakes]]'',\n|\n| [1986]\n| 1\n| SCR\n|\n| 103.\n|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| ''Re Canada Trust Co and OHRC''\n| (1990),\n|\n|69\n|DLR\n|(4th)\n|321\n|(Ont CA).\n|}\n\nThe ''Style of Cause'' is italicized as in all other countries and the party names are separated by ''v'' (English) or ''c'' (French). Prior to 1984 the appellant party would always be named first. However, since then case names do not switch order when the case is appealed.\n\nUndisclosed parties to a case are represented by initials (e.g., ''[[R. v. R.D.S|R v RDS]]''). Criminal cases are prosecuted by the Crown, which is always represented by ''R'' for ''Regina'' (queen) or ''Rex'' (king). [[reference question|Reference questions]] (advisory opinions) are always entitled ''Reference re'' followed by the subject title.\n\nIf the year of decision is the same as the year of the report and the date is a part of the reporter's citation, then the date need not be listed after the ''style of cause''. If the date of the decision is different from the year of the report, then both should be shown.\n\nWhere available, cases should be cited with their neutral citation immediately after the ''style of cause'' and preceding the print citation. For example,\n\n:''[[Chaoulli v. Quebec (Attorney General)|Chaoulli v Quebec (Attorney General)]]'', 2005 SCC 35, [2005] 1 SCR 791.\n\nThis format was adopted as the standard in 2006, in the sixth edition of the McGill Guide. Prior to this format, the opposite order of parallel citation was used.\n\nThe seventh edition of the McGill Guide, published 2010-08-20, removes most full stop/period (\".\") characters from the citations, e.g., a citation to the Supreme Court Reports that previously would have been [2005] 1 S.C.R. 791, is now [2005] 1 SCR 791. Most full stops are also removed from styles of cause. The seventh edition also further highlights the significance of neutral citations (i.e., tribunal-assigned citations that are publisher-independent).\n\n====Reports====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

However, most case citations include the same elements.\n\n=== Published decisions ===\nCitations of decisions published in a [[Law report|reporter]] usually consist of the ''name or abbreviation of the reporter'', the ''year or volume'', the ''page number'' where the decision begin (sometimes followed by an ''identifying number'' if more than one judgment is on a page), as well as the ''name or abbreviation of the court which decided the case''. As an example, the \"Aalborg Kloster-judgment\", a precedent-setting [[Supreme Court (Denmark)|Supreme Court]] judgment regarding [[strict liability]], is published in [[Ugeskrift for Retsv\u00e6sen]] volume 1968 as the second judgment on page 84. A citation of this case could take the form {{Nowrap|U.1968.84/2H}}, {{Nowrap|UfR 1968 84/2 H}}, {{Nowrap|Ugeskrift for Retsv\u00e6sen 1968, p. 84/2}}, or something similar. In this case ''U'', ''UfR'' and ''Ugeskrift for Retsv\u00e6sen'' identify the reporter, ''1968'' identifies the year or volume, ''84'' identifies the starting page, ''/2'' indicates that the judgment is the second one on that particular page, and ''H'' identifies the court which decided the case.\n\nCertain reporters, such as Tidsskrift for Skatter og Afgifter, do not identify published decisions by page number, but by a [[serial number]]. Citations to these reporters use the serial number in place of a page number.\n\n=== Unpublished decisions ===\nIf a decision has not been published in a reporter, more identifying information is needed. Generally, citations to unreported cases involve the ''name of the court'', the ''date of the decision'' and the ''case number'' assigned by the court. For example: S\u00f8- og Handelsrettens dom af 3. maj 2018 i sag nr. V-17-17 (The [[Maritime and Commercial Court (Denmark)|Maritime and Commercial Court]]'s judgment of May 3 in case no. V-17-17). Certain authors format these citations to mimic the \"short citation\" of published cases.\n\n=== Neutral citations and the ECLI ===\nThe [[Danish Court Administration]] is currently working on a public database which will make all judgments available to the public (currently only the Supreme Court as well as the Maritime and Commercial Court do this). The database is expected to implement the [[European Case Law Identifier]], which will make uniform, neutral citations of decisions possible.\n\n=== Reporters ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Abbreviation(s)\n!Full name\n!Translated title\n!Topic area\n|-\n|U, UfR\n|Ugeskrift for Retsv\u00e6sen\n|Weekly Reporter of the Judiciary (translated varyingly as \"the Danish Weekly Law Reports\", \"the Weekly Law Journal\", and \"the Weekly Law Review\" by the [[European Court of Human Rights]])\n|The most broad of the reporters.

Oktober 1983,\n| Az. 1 BvR 209, 269, 362, 420, 440, 484/83\n|}\n\nFor the meaning of the different case numbers of the BVerfG see [[:de:Aktenzeichen#Verwendete Aktenzeichen des Bundesverfassungsgerichts|the German article]].\n\nIf decisions are not yet published by the court, or will not be published at all, law journals can be cited, e.g.,\n:BVerfG, NJW 2009, 1234 (1235 f.).\nWhere ''NJW'' stands for the law journal [[:de:Neue Juristische Wochenschrift|Neue Juristische Wochenschrift]], 2009 is the year, 1234 the page of the beginning and 1235 the cited page(s) \u2013 \"f.\" stands for \"seq.\". In general, citations of the official collections are preferred.\n\n===Federal Court of Justice of Germany===\nThe [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany]] (Bundesgerichtshof, short BGH) publishes the official collections ''[[:de:BGHSt|BGHSt]]'' for decisions in [[penal law]] and ''[[:de:BGHZ|BGHZ]]'' for those in [[private law]].\n\nThe [[:de:Katzenk\u00f6nigfall|Katzenk\u00f6nigfall]] e.g. would be cited\n:BGHSt 35, 347 ff., Urteil des 4. Strafsenats vom 15. September 1988, Az. 4 StR 352/88.\nin full and\n:BGHSt 35, 347 ff.\nin short (in this example, not a specific page but the case as such is cited; \"ff.\" means \"sqq.\").\n\n===Other federal courts===\nThe official collection of the [[Bundessozialgericht|Federal Social Court of Germany]] (Bundessozialgericht, BSG) is abbreviated ''BSGE''.\n\nThe official collection of the [[Federal Finance Court of Germany]] (Bundesfinanzhof, BFH) is ''BFHE''.\n\nThe official collection of the [[Federal Labor Court of Germany]] (Bundesarbeitsgericht, BAG) is ''BAGE''.\n\nThe official collection of the [[Federal Administrative Court of Germany]] (Bundesverwaltungsgericht, BVerwG) is ''BVerwGE''.\n\n===Other courts===\nFor other courts, generally the same rules apply, though most do not publish an official collection, so they must be cited from a law journal.\n\n===European Case Law Identifier===\nAccording to the [[European Case Law Identifier|ECLI]] system the ''Volksz\u00e4hlungsurteil'' would be cited as \n:ECLI:DE:BVerfG:1983:rs19831215.1bvr020983\nand the ''Katzenk\u00f6nigfall'' as \n:ECLI:DE:BGH:1988:150988U4STR352.88.0\n\n==India==\nIndia's vast federated judicial system admits to a large number of reporters, each with their own style of citation. There are over 200 law reports in India \u2013 subject-wise and state (province)-wise, authorized and unauthorized.\n\n===Supreme Court of India===\nThe official reporter for Supreme Court decisions is the Supreme Court Reports. These reports however lag behind other journals in the speed of reporting. While decisions themselves are uploaded by the Supreme Court itself on ''www.courtnic.nic.in'', the edited versions with headnotes in the official reporter take years to compile. However, some reporters have been authorised to publish the Court's decisions. The ''All India Reporter'' (AIR) is an old and respected reporter that, in addition to the Supreme Court, also reports decisions of the various State High Courts. Other popular reporters include ''Supreme Court Cases'', which has become the most cited report in the Supreme Court, the ''Supreme Court Almanac'', and ''Judgements Today''.\n\n[[File:All India Reporter.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''All India Reporter'']]\n\n''Sebastian Hongray v.

Those citations looked like this:\n* ''Federation of Mining Associations v. State of Rajasthan''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.legitquest.com/case/kailash-chand-agarwal-v-the-state-of-rajasthan-and-ors/165167|title=Kailash Chand Agarwal V.

From 1996 the Supplementary Volumes were numbered in sequence after the regular volumes.\n\nThe SCC also have a separate series of subject-based reporting of the decisions of the Supreme Court:\n* ''[[Rathinam Nagbhushan Patnaik v. Union of India]]'' 1994 SCC (Cri) 740, which refers to the SCC Criminal Reports\n* ''Delhi Transport Corporation v. Mazdoor Congress''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.legitquest.com/Home/GetCaseDetails?searchType=freetext&searchText=Delhi%20Transport%20Corporation%20v.%20Mazdoor%20Congress|title=Delhi Transport Corporation v. Mazdoor Congress|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> 1991 SCC (L&S) 1213, which refers to the SCC Labour & Services Reports\n\n===High Courts===\nThe ''All India Reporter'' (AIR) is the most popular nationwide reporter for decisions of the High Courts. An AIR High Court citation looks like: ''[[Surjya Kumar Das v. Maya Dutta]]'' AIR 1982 Cal 222, where \"Cal\" refers to the [[Calcutta High Court]] in [[Kolkata]]. This is a uniform style for AIR High Court reports. Only the shortened indicator of the forum changes for different High Courts. ''The Calcutta Weekly Notes'' is the oldest continuously published [[law journal]] in India having uninterrupted publication since 1896 reporting reportable decisions of the High Court at Calcutta. Reports are cited in the style 105 CWN 345 where 105 refers to the volume number calculated at one volume per year from the initial volume, which had been published in 1896. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n===National Judicial Reference System ([[NJRS]])===\n\nNational Judicial Reference System ([[NJRS]]) is a project started by the Income-tax Department, Government of India. It has been envisaged as a tool to achieve efficiency in the tax litigation process of Income Tax Department (ITD). Within this project the Judicial Research & Reference System (JRRS) \u2013 JRRS is a repository of judicial orders as a single, indexed, searchable, cross-linked, database of Judgments / orders of ITAT, Authority of Advance Ruling (AAR), HC and SC.\n\nThe Citation nomenclature followed within [[NJRS]] :\n* ''[[Chandra Ranganathan & Ors. v. Commissioner of Income-tax]]'' 2009-LL-1021, which refers to [[NJRS]] citations.\n\nThis Citation further allows to add the Authority where the judgment / order was pronounced.\n* ''[[Chandra Ranganathan & Ors. v. Commissioner of Income-tax]]'' 2009-LL-1021-SC, which refers to [[NJRS]] citations.\n\n==New Zealand==\nThe standard case citation format in New Zealand is:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ''Style of cause''\n! (year of decision)\n! [year of reporter]\n! volume\n! reporter\n! page\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| ''Taylor v New Zealand Poultry Board''\n| \n| [1984]\n| 1\n| NZLR\n| 394\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|  ''R v Howse''\n| (2005)\n|\n| 21\n| CRNZ\n| 823\n|}\n\nSeveral leading law reviews in New Zealand have also adopted the ''[[Australian Guide to Legal Citation]]'' (AGLC) such as the ''[[University of Canterbury|Canterbury]] Law Review''. The AGLC style is also rather similar to citation style in New Zealand.\n\n===Reporters===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ''Abbreviation''\n! ''Reporter''\n! ''Years''\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|NZLR\n|New Zealand Law Reports\n|1881 \u2013\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|CRNZ\n|Criminal Reports of New Zealand\n|1983 \u2013\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|NZBORR\n|New Zealand Bill of Rights Reports\n|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|NZAR\n|New Zealand Administrative Reports\n|1976\u2013\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|NZFLR\n|New Zealand Family Law Reports\n|1981\u2013\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|DCR\n|District Court Reports\n|1981\u2013\n|}\n\nAdditionally, a number of other report series exist for specialist areas such as Family, Employment and Tax Law. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n===Neutral citation===\nNew Zealand courts and tribunals have begun to adopt a neutral citation standard for case law. The format provides a naming system that does not depend on the publication of the case in a law report.\n\nThe standard format looks like this:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year of decision\n!Court identifier\n!Ordinal number\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|[2005]\n|NZSC\n|1\n|}\n\nThere is a unique court identifier for each court or tribunal.  These identifiers are:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Court Identifier\n!Court\n!Years\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|NZSC\n|[[Supreme Court of New Zealand]]\n| 2005\u2013\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|NZCA\n|[[New Zealand Court of Appeal]]\n| 2007\u2013\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|NZHC\n|[[High Court of New Zealand]]\n| 2012\u2013\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| NZDC\n|[[District Court of New Zealand]]\n| \n|- valign=\"top\"\n| NZEmpC\n|[[Employment Court of New Zealand]]\n| 2010\u2013\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| NZEnvC\n|[[Environment Court of New Zealand]]\n| 2010\u2013\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| NZFC\n|[[Family Court of New Zealand]]\n| 2012\u2013\n|}\n\nWhere both a neutral citation and a reporter citation exist, the neutral citation should come first e.g. ''R v AM'' [2010] NZCA 114, [2010] 2 NZLR 750\n\n==Norway==\nThe Norwegian standard case citation format for published court decisions is:\n\n:Rt. 1952 s. 989 ''(Telefonsjikanedommen)''\n\nwhere:\n\n* '''Rt.''' identifies the report series.\n** All [[Supreme Court of Norway|supreme court judgments]] are published in Retstidende (Court Times), abbreviated Rt.\n** Many judgments and decisions from lower courts are published in Rettens gang (RG).\n* '''1952''' is the year of reporter\n* '''s.''' is the Norwegian abbreviation for page. This is optional.\n* '''989''' is the first page number of the decision in the reporter.\n* Finally, one can add the popular name of the decision. It is unusual to refer to name of the plaintiff(s) and defendant(s), but often there is an unofficial name. ''Telefonsjikanedommen'' refers to a 1952 case where the Supreme Court ruled that telephone harassment (\"telefonsjikane\") was not illegal under the current criminal code.\n\n==The Philippines==\nDespite the long-standing [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] tradition in the Philippines, reliance on judicial precedents has become indispensable since the period of American rule. [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] decisions are expressly recognized as part of the internal law, and are thus frequently cited in court decisions and legal pleadings. Though there is only one Supreme Court in the Philippines, the citation of its decisions varies, depending on which report of a case is relied on by the person citing that case. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n===Official reporter===\nThe ''Philippine Reports'' is the official reporter of decisions of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]]. The standard format for citation of the ''Philippine Reports'' is:\n\n:''People v. Flores'', 442 Phil. 561 (2002)\n\nwhere:\n\n* ''People v. Flores'' is the name of the case\n* ''442'' is the volume number of the ''Philippine Reports'' where the case may be found\n* ''Phil.'' is the standard abbreviation of ''Philippine Reports''\n* ''561'' is the page number in the ''Philippine Reports'' that contains the beginning of the decision. If this number is followed by a comma then another page number (i.e., ''442 Phil. 561, 563''), the latter number indicates the particular page where the annotated text can be found\n* ''(2002)'' is the year the case was decided.\n\nAs of present, Philippine cases are contained in quarterly issues. The Supreme Court Reports Annotated or SCRA are cited as such:\n\nJuarez v. Court of Appeals 214 SCRA 475\n\nwhere 214 is the volume of the book, and 475 is the page number. There are already over 700 SCRAs in circulation.\n\n===Unofficial reporter===\nIn the last few decades, the ''Philippine Reports'' has suffered from production problems, resulting in long delays in publication, as well as significant gaps within its published series. As a result, the privately published ''Supreme Court Reports Annotated'' (published by Central Professional Books, Inc.) has become more widely used than the ''Philippine Reports'', even by the courts. The proper format for citation of the ''Supreme Court Reports Annotated'' is:\n\n:''Fortich v. Corona'', G.R. No. 131457, 24 April 1998, 289 SCRA 624\n\nwhere:\n\n* ''Fortich v. Corona'' is the name of the case\n* ''G.R. No. 131457'' is the case docket number originally assigned by the Supreme Court at the time the action was filed with the Court (G.R. means ''General Register'')\n* ''24 April 1998'' is the exact date the decision of this case was promulgated\n* ''289'' is the volume number of the ''Supreme Court Reports Annotated'' where the case may be found\n* ''SCRA'' is the standard abbreviation of ''Supreme Court Reports Annotated''\n* ''624'' is the page number in the ''Supreme Court Reports Annotated'' that contains the beginning of the decision. If this number is followed by a comma then another page number (i.e., ''289 SCRA 624, 627''), the latter number indicates the particular page where the annotated text can be found\n\nOwing to the delays in the regular publication of the Philippine Reports, reliance on the SCRA has been tolerated, although if a case may be found at the Philippine Reports, it is preferred that the official reporter be cited in lieu of the SCRA.\n\nWhen citing cases not yet reported in the Philippine Reports or the SCRA, the above citation without reference to the SCRA is preferred (i.e., ''Fortich v. Corona'', G.R. No. 131457, 24 April 1988)\n\n===Lower court decisions===\nAs there are no official or unofficial reporters that regularly publish decisions of the [[Philippine Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]] and other lower courts, citation of their decisions hews to the same format as cases not reported either in the Philippine Reports or the SCRA. Thus: ''(case name)'', ''(docket number)'', ''(Exact date of promulgation of decision)''.\n\n==Switzerland==\nCitations vary by court and by language. Cases of the [[Swiss Federal Supreme Court]] are cited as follows:<ref>{{cite web|title=Schweizerisches Bundesgericht - Zitierregeln|url=https://www.bger.ch/index/juridiction/jurisdiction-inherit-template/jurisdiction-zitierregeln.htm|website=Swiss Federal Supreme Court|accessdate=28 April 2018|language=de}}</ref>\n\nOfficially published cases are cited as ''BGE 133 II 292 [E. 3.2 S. 296]'' (German: ''Bundesgerichtsentscheide'') or ''ATF 133 II 292 [consid. 3.2 p. 296]'' (French: ''arr\u00eats du tribunal f\u00e9d\u00e9ral''). In this example, 133 is the annual issue of the court reports, II the part indicating the division of the Court, and 292 the page on which the decision begins. Optionally, \"E. 3.2\" and \"S. 296\" are the section and page specifically cited.\n\nSupreme Court decisions not selected for official publication are cited as ''Urteil [des Bundesgerichts] 5C.260/2006 vom 30. M\u00e4rz 2007'' or ''arr\u00eat [du Tribunal f\u00e9d\u00e9ral] 5C.260/2006 du 30 mars 2007'' respectively. In this example, 5C is the division of the Court, 260 the case number and 2006 the year in which the case was opened.\n\nThe citation style for cases of the inferior [[federal courts of Switzerland]] is similar.\n\n==United Kingdom==\n\n===Neutral citation===\n{{main|British and Irish Legal Information Institute#Case citations}}\nSince 2001, judgments in the House of Lords, Privy Council, Court of Appeal and Administrative Court have been issued with neutral citations. This system was extended to other parts of the High Court in 2002. Judgments with neutral citations are freely available on the British and Irish Legal Information Institute website (www.bailii.org).\n\t\nNeutral citations identify judgments independently of any series of reports, and cite only parties, year of judgment, court and case number. For example, <br />''Rottman v MPC'' [2002] UKHL 20 <br/>identifies the 20th judgment in 2002 in the UK House of Lords. UKHL stands for UK House of Lords. EWHC and EWCA identify the England and Wales High Court and Court of Appeal respectively. These abbreviations are generally followed by an abbreviation indicating the court or division (e.g. Admin, Ch, Crim, Pat).\n\n===How to cite a case===\n{{see also|Oxford Standard for Citation of Legal Authorities}}\nIf a neutral citation is available for a judgment, it should immediately follow the party names. If the judgment has also been reported in a law reports series, follow the neutral citation with the ''best report'', which is usually from the official Law Reports series (Appeals Cases \u2013 AC, Chancery \u2013 Ch, Family \u2013 Fam, Queen's Bench \u2013 QB etc.).\n\nThe case of ''Rottman v MPC'' was reported in the Appeals Cases, so the citation should be:\n*''Rottman v MPC'' [2002] UKHL 20, [2002] 2 AC 692.\n\nThis means that a report of the case and the judgment can be found in the 2002 volumes, vol 2, of the Law Reports series called Appeals Cases, beginning at page 692.\n\nTo cite a particular paragraph from the judgment, add the paragraph number in square brackets at the end of the citation:\n*''Rottman v MPC'' [2002] UKHL 20, [2002] 2 AC 692 [58].\n\nIf a case is not reported in the Law Reports, the next best report is the Weekly Law Reports (e.g. [2002] 2 WLR 1315), and then the All England Reports (e.g., [2002] 2 All ER 865). In some situations, it might be preferable to cite a specialist series, e.g., ''Rottman v MPC'' was also cited in the Human Rights Law Reports, at [2002] HRLR 32.\n\nFor cases before 2001, cite the best report. If referring to a particular page of the judgment, give that page number after the page number on which the report begins. The following citation refers to page 573 of the ''Donoghue v Stevenson'' judgment:\n\n*''Donoghue v Stevenson'' [1932] AC 562, 573.\n*See [https://web.archive.org/web/20150617084928/http://denning.law.ox.ac.uk/published/oscola.shtml Oxford Standard for the Citation of Legal Authorities]\n\n===England and Wales===\nThe standard case citation format in [[England and Wales]] is:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ''Style of cause''\n! (year of decision),\n! [year of report]\n! volume\n! report\n! (series)\n! page\n! jurisdiction/court\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]''\n|\n| [1932]\n| \n| AC\n|\n| 562\n| (HL).\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]''\n|(1884)\n|\n|14\n|QBD\n|\n|273.\n|\n|}\n\nIn [[England and Wales]] as with certain Commonwealth countries, the abbreviation \"R\" for ''rex'' (king) or ''regina'' (queen), is used for cases in which the state is a party (typically criminal cases or [[judicial review]] cases).\n\n[[Bracket#Square brackets .5B .5D|Square brackets]] \"[ ]\" are used when the year is essential to locating the report (e.g., the official law reports either\u2014as with ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'', above\u2014do not have volume numbers or, if there are multiple volumes in a single year, they are numbered 1, 2, etc.). [[Bracket#Parentheses .28 .29|Round brackets]] \"( )\" are used when the year is not essential but is useful for information purposes, e.g., in reports that have a cumulative volume number such as ''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]'', above.\n\n===Law Reports===\nThe term \"reporter\", meaning a law report or a series of them, is not widely used in England and Wales. Before 1865, English courts used a large number of privately printed reports, and cases were cited based on which report they appeared in. (This system was also used in the United States and other common law jurisdictions during that period.)\n\nTwo main unofficial law reports report all areas of law: the ''Weekly Law Reports'' (WLR) and the ''All England Reports'' (All ER). In addition, a number of unofficial specialist law reports focus on particular areas, e.g., ''Entertainment and Media Law Reports'' (EMLR) or the ''Criminal Appeal Reports'' (Cr App R).\n\nFor the citation of \"The Law Reports\" of the Incorporated Council of Law Reporting, see [[Law Reports]]. These have been published since 1865. They have always been split into a number of different series, the current series being the Appeal Cases (AC), Chancery (Ch), Family (Fam), and Queen's Bench (QB) (or King's Bench\u2014KB\u2014depending on the monarch of the time).

The ''[[Scots Law Times]]'' is cited as \"SLT\".<ref>''Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice'' (1999), p. xix.<!-- ISBN/ISSN needed --></ref>\n\n==United States==\nThe standard case citation format in the United States is:\n:''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 410 U.S. 113 (1973)\nwhere:\n*''Roe v. Wade'' is the abbreviated name of the case. Generally, the first name (here, ''Roe'') is the surname of the [[plaintiff]], who is the party who filed the suit for an original case, or the [[appellant]], the party appealing in a case being appealed from a lower court, or the [[petitioner]] when litigating in the [[Supreme court|high court]] of a jurisdiction; and the second name (here, ''Wade'') is the surname of the [[defendant]], the party responding to the suit, or the [[appellee]], the party responding to the appeal, or the [[respondent]], when defending in the high court of the jurisdiction. Litigants are generally referred to by their last name (when they are natural persons), and a case is generally referred to by the first named litigant on each side of the case. In this example, ''Roe'' refers to \"[[Jane Roe]],\" a pseudonym commonly used when it is appropriate to keep the identity of a litigant out of the public spotlight, and ''Wade'' refers to [[Henry Wade]], the [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]] District Attorney at the time.\n*410 is the volume number of the \"[[Reporter (law)|reporter]]\" that reported the Court's written opinion in the case titled ''Roe v. Wade''.\n*U.S. is the abbreviation of the reporter, or printed book of court opinions. Here, \"U.S.\" stands for ''[[United States Reports]]''.\n*113 is the page number (in volume 410 of ''United States Reports'') where the opinion begins.\n*1973 is the year when the court rendered its decision.\n*The abbreviated name of the court is included inside the parenthesis before the year if the name of the court is not obvious from the reporter. This rule comes into play because certain reporters, such as members of the West [[National Reporter System]], publish opinions originating from multiple courts.  In this example, the name of the court (United States Supreme Court) is obvious (since only decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court are published in ''United States Reports'') and is thus omitted as a matter of convention.\n\nCase citations are used to find a particular case, both when looking up a case in a printed reporter and when accessing it via the Internet or services such as LexisNexis or Westlaw.\n\nThis format also allows different cases with the same parties to be easily differentiated. For example, looking for the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case of ''[[Miller v. California]]'' would yield four cases, some involving different people named Miller, and each involving different issues.\n\n===Supreme Court of the United States===\nCases from the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] are officially printed in the ''[[United States Reports]]''. A citation to the ''United States Reports'' looks like this:\n\n*''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', 347 U.S. 483 (1954).\n*''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'', 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\n\nMany court decisions are published in more than one reporter. A citation to two or more reporters for a given court decision is called a \"parallel citation\". For U.S. Supreme Court decisions, there are several unofficial reporters, including the [[National Reporter System|''Supreme Court Reporter'']] (abbreviated S.&nbsp;Ct.) and ''United States Supreme Court Reports, Lawyers' Edition'' (commonly known simply as ''Lawyers' Edition'') (abbreviated L.&nbsp;Ed.), which are printed by private companies and provide further annotations to the opinions of the Court. Although a citation to the latter two is not required, some attorneys and legal writers prefer to cite all three case reporters at once:\n\n*''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'', 381 U.S. 479, 85 S. Ct. 1678, 14 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1965)\n\nThe \"2d\" after the L.&nbsp;Ed. signifies the second series of the ''Lawyers' Edition''. United States case reporters are sequentially numbered, but the volume number is never higher than 999. When the 1,000th volume is reached (the threshold in earlier years was lower), the volume number is reset to 1 and a \"2d\" is appended after the reporter's abbreviation. Some case reporters are in their third series, and a few are approaching their fourth.\n\nSome very old Supreme Court cases have odd-looking citations, such as ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803). The \"(1 Cranch)\" refers to the fact that, before there was a reporter series known as the ''United States Reports'' compiled by the Supreme Court's [[Supreme Court of the United States Reporter of Decisions|Reporter of Decisions]], cases were gathered, bound together, and sold privately by the Court's Reporter of Decisions. In this example, ''Marbury'' was first reported in an edition by [[William Cranch]], who was responsible for publishing Supreme Court reports from 1801 to 1815. Such reports, named for the individual who gathered them and hence called \"[[nominative reports]]\", existed from 1790 to 1874. Beginning in 1874, the U.S. government created the ''United States Reports'', and at the same time simultaneously numbered the volumes previously published privately as part of a single series and began numbering sequentially from that point. In this way, \"5 U.S. (1&nbsp;Cranch)\" means that it is the 5th overall volume of the ''United States Reports'' series, but the first that was originally published by [[William Cranch]]; four volumes of opinions prior to that were (for example) published by [[Alexander J. Dallas (statesman)|Alexander Dallas]] (for example, \"4 U.S. (4 Dall.)\"), and after Cranch's 9 volumes, 12 more were published by [[Henry Wheaton]] (e.g., \"15 U.S. (2&nbsp;Wheat.)\"). See the [[Supreme Court of the United States Reporter of Decisions]] for other edition names. The name of the reporter of decisions has not been used in citations since the U.S. government began printing the ''United States Reports''.\n\nWhen a case has been decided, but not yet published in the case reporter, the citation may note the volume but leave blank the page of the case reporter until it is determined. For example, ''Golan v. Holder,'' 565 U.S. 302 (2012) was properly cited as ''[[Golan v. Holder]]'', {{nowrap|565 U.S. ___ (2012)}} before publication.\n\nIn the caption of a Supreme Court case, the first name listed is the name of the petitioning (appealing) party, followed by the party responding (respondent) to the appeal.  In most cases, the appealing party was the losing party in the prior court.  This is no longer the practice used in cases in the federal courts of appeal, in which the original alignment of parties from the lower court is preserved.\n\n===Lower federal courts===\n[[File:US Court of Appeals and District Court map.svg|thumb|400px|right|Map of the geographic boundaries of the various United States Courts of Appeals and United States District Courts]]\n[[United States court of appeals]] cases are published in the ''[[Federal Reporter]]'' (F., F.2d, or F.3d). [[United States district court]] cases and cases from some specialized courts are published in the ''[[Federal Supplement]]'' (F. Supp., F. Supp. 2d, or F. Supp. 3d). Both series are published by [[Thomson West]]; they are technically unofficial reporters, but have become widely accepted as the ''de facto'' \"official\" reporters of the lower federal courts because of the absence of a true official reporter. (Of the federal appeals and district courts, only one, the [[D.C. Circuit]], has an official reporter, ''United States Court of Appeals Reports'', and even that one is rarely used today.)<ref>D.C. Circuit Rule 32.1 provides: \"Citations to decisions of this court must be to the Federal Reporter. Dual or parallel citation of cases is not required.\"</ref>\n\nWhen lower federal court opinions are cited, the citation includes the name of the court. This is placed in the parentheses immediately before the year. Some examples:\n\n*''[[Geary v. Visitation of Blessed Virgin Mary School]]'', 7 F.3d 324 (3d Cir. 1993) \u2013 a 1993 case in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]]\n*''[[Glassroth v. Moore]]'', 229 F. Supp. 2d 1290 (M.D. Ala. 2002) \u2013 a 2002 case in the [[U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama]]\n\nU.S. circuit and district court cases from 1789 to 1880 were reported in [[Federal Cases]], abbreviated F. Cas. An example of the citation form is: ''[[Wheaton v. Peters]]'', 29 F. Cas. 862 (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1832) (No. 17,486).\n\n===State courts===\nState court decisions are published in several places. Many states have their own official state reporters, which publish decisions of one or more of that state's courts. Reporters that publish decisions of a state's highest court are abbreviated the same as the state's name (note: this is the traditional abbreviation, not the postal abbreviation), regardless of what the actual title of the reporter is.  Thus, the official reporter of decisions of the [[California Supreme Court]] (titled ''California Reports'') is abbreviated \"Cal.\" (or, for subsequent series, \"Cal. 2d,\" \"Cal. 3d\", or \"Cal. 4th\").\n\n*''[[Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co.]]'', 248 N.Y. 339 (1928), a case in the [[New York Court of Appeals]], reported in ''New York Reports''. Note that the New York Court of Appeals is the highest court in New York. Because the ''New York Reports'' only report opinions of the New York Court of Appeals, there is no need to repeat the court designation before the year.\n*''Green v. [[Chicago Tribune]] Company'', 286 Ill. App. 3d 1 (1996) \u2013 a case in the [[Illinois Appellate Court]], reported in ''Illinois Appellate Court Reports''. Note that, in contrast to New York, the Illinois Appellate Court is only the [[List of state intermediate appellate courts|intermediate court of appeals]] in Illinois; decisions of the [[Illinois Supreme Court]] are reported in ''Illinois Reports'', abbreviated \"Ill.\" (or \"Ill. 2d\"). Because the ''Illinois Appellate Court Reports'' are dedicated solely to reporting decisions of the Illinois Appellate Court, there is no need to repeat the court designation before the year.\n*''Harte v. Hand'', 438 N.J. Super. 545 (Ch. Div. 2014). Note that although all published opinions of the [[New Jersey Superior Court]] are published in the ''New Jersey Superior Court Reports'', the organization of the Superior Court into three divisions (the Law Division, the Chancery Division, and the [[New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division|Appellate Division]]) means the citation must specify which division issued the opinion. This is especially salient as the Appellate Division hears appeals from the Law and Chancery Divisions, as occurred with the example case (a rehearing on remand of ''Harte v. Hand'', 433 N.J. Super. 457 (App. Div. 2013)).\n\n[[File:National Reporter System regions.png|thumb|400px|right|The [[Thomson West]] National Reporter System regions.]]\nIn addition to the official reporters, [[Thomson West]] publishes several series of \"regional reporters\" that cover several states each. These are the ''[[North Eastern Reporter]]'', ''[[Atlantic Reporter]]'', ''[[South Eastern Reporter]]'', ''[[Southern Reporter]]'', ''[[South Western Reporter]]'', ''[[North Western Reporter]]'', and ''[[Pacific Reporter]]''. [[California]], [[Illinois]], and [[New York (state)|New York]] also each have their own line of Thomson West reporters, because of the large volume of cases generated in those states (titled, respectively, ''West's California Reporter'', ''Illinois Decisions'', and ''West's New York Supplement'').  Some smaller states (like [[South Dakota]]) have stopped publishing their own official reporters, and instead have certified the appropriate West regional reporter as their \"official\" reporter.\n\nHere are some examples of how to cite West reporters:\n\n*''Jackson v. Commonwealth'', 583 S.E.2d 780 (Va. Ct. App. 2003) \u2013 a case in the [[Virginia Court of Appeals]] (an intermediate appellate court) published in the ''South Eastern Reporter'''s 2nd series\n*''Foxworth v. Maddox'', 137 So. 161 (Fla. 1931) \u2013 a case in the [[Florida Supreme Court]] published in the ''Southern Reporter''\n*''People v. Brown'', 282 N.Y.S.2d 497 (N.Y. 1967) \u2013 a case in the [[New York Court of Appeals]] (New York's highest court) published in  ''West's New York Supplement'''s 2nd series. The case also appears in West's regional reporter: ''People v. Brown'', 229 N.E.2d 192 (N.Y. 1967). Note, in both forms, that \"N.Y.\" is placed in the parenthetical, because both ''West's New York Supplement'' and the ''North Eastern Reporter'' report the opinions of more courts than only the New York Court of Appeals. A citation to the officially published reports, ''People v. Brown'', 20 N.Y.2d 238 (1967), however, does not require the court name in the parenthetical, because the official ''New York Reports'' only report opinions of the New York Court of Appeals.\n\nAbbreviations for lower courts vary by state, as each state has its own system of trial courts and intermediate appellate courts. When a case appears in both an official reporter and a regional reporter, either citation can be used. Generally, citing to the regional reporter is preferred, since out-of-state attorneys are more likely to have access to these. Many lawyers prefer to include both citations. Some state courts require that parallel citations (in this case, citing to both the official reporter and an unofficial regional reporter) be used when citing cases from any court in that state's system.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nLike the United States Supreme Court, some very old state case citations include an abbreviation of the name of either the private publisher or the [[reporter of decisions]], a state-appointed officer who originally collected and published the cases. For example, in ''Hall v. Bell'', 47 Mass. (6 Met.) 431 (1843), the citation is to volume 47 of ''Massachusetts Reports'', which, like ''United States Reports'', was started in the latter half of the 19th century and incorporated into the series a number of prior editions originally published privately, and began numbering from that point; \"6 Met.\" refers to the 6th volume that had originally been published privately by [[Theron Metcalf]]. An example of a case cited to a reporter that has not been subsequently incorporated into an officially published series is ''[[Pierson v. Post]]'', 3 Cai. 175 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1804), reported in volume 3 of ''Caines' Reports'', page 175, named for [[George Caines]], who had been appointed to report New York cases; the case was before the New York Supreme Court of Judicature (now defunct). Most states gave up this practice in the mid-to-late 19th century, but [[Delaware]] persisted until 1920.\n\nSome states, notably [[California]] and [[New York (state)|New York]], have their own citation systems that differ significantly from the various federal and national standards.<ref>[http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/New_Styman.htm \"New York Law Reports Style Manual\"]</ref> In California, the year is placed ''between'' the names of the parties and the reference to the case reporter; in New York, the year is wrapped by in [[Bracket#Square brackets .5B .5D|bracket]]s instead of [[Bracket#Parentheses ( )|parentheses]]. Both New York and California styles wrap an entire citation in parentheses when used as a stand-alone sentence, although New York places the terminating period outside the parentheses, whereas California places it inside. New York wraps just the reporter and page references in parentheses when the citation is used as a clause. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nEither way, both state styles differ from the national/[[Bluebook]] style of simply dropping in the citation as a separate sentence without further adornment. Both systems use less punctuation and spacing in their reporter abbreviations.\n\nFor example, assuming that it is being placed as a stand-alone sentence, the ''Brown'' case above would be cited (using the official reporter) to a New York court as:\n\n*(''People v. Brown'', 20 NY2d 238 [1967]).\n\nAnd, again, as a stand-alone sentence, the famous ''Greenman'' [[product liability]] case would be cited to a California court as:\n\n*(''Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc.'' (1963) 59 Cal.2d 57.)<ref>[http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C2/59C2d57.htm ''Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc.'' (1963) 59 C2d 57<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===Unpublished decisions===\n{{main|Non-publication}}\nA growing number of court decisions are not published in case reporters.  For example, only 7% of the opinions of the California intermediate courts (the [[California Court of Appeal|Courts of Appeal]]) are published each year. This is mainly because judges certify only significant decisions for publication, due to the massive number of frivolous appeals flowing through the courts and the importance of avoiding information overload.<ref>''Schmier v. Supreme Court'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/CA4/78CA4t703.htm 78 Cal. App. 4th 703] (2000). The plaintiff in this case unsuccessfully challenged the selective publication policy as unconstitutional. The court retorted: \"Appellant either misunderstands or ignores the realities of the intermediate appellate process.\" The court went on to describe the variety of frivolous appeals regularly encountered by the Courts of Appeal, and concluded: \"Our typical opinions in such cases add nothing to the body of stare decisis, and if published would merely clutter overcrowded library shelves and databases with information utterly useless to anyone other than the actual litigants therein and complicate the search for meaningful precedent.\"</ref>\n\nIt is also argued that this is in part because in many states, especially California, the legislature has failed to expand the judiciary to keep up with population growth (for various political and fiscal reasons). To deal with their crushing caseloads, many judges prefer to write shorter-than-normal opinions that dispose of minor issues in the case in a sentence or two. They avoid publishing such abbreviated opinions, however, so as not to risk creating bad [[precedent]]s. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nAttorneys have several options in citing \"unpublished\" decisions:\n* For cases that have not been published or put in an electronic database, or very recently decided cases that have not ''yet'' been published or put in an electronic database, a citation to the case's docket number before the court that decided it is required.\n**''Groucho Marx Prods. v. Playboy Enters.'', No. 77 Civ. 1782 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 30, 1977) \u2013 a decision of the [[U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]]; the docket number and specific date allow a researcher to track down the printed copy maintained by the court if needed (legal citation forms strongly prefer citations to traditional printed resources).\n* Even though only some decisions of the U.S. Courts of Appeal are considered \"published\" (those appearing in ''Federal Reporter''), Thomson West has recently started making available all decisions officially considered \"unpublished\" in a separate publication called ''Federal Appendix'' (abbreviated \"F. App'x\").\n* Cases intentionally left officially unpublished are nonetheless often \"published\" on computer services, such as [[LexisNexis]] and [[Westlaw]]. These services have their own citation formats based on the year of the case, an abbreviation indicating the computer service (or a specific database of that computer service), and an identification number; citations to online databases also usually include the case's [[docket (court)|docket]] number and the specific date when it was decided (due to the preference for citation to traditional printed resources). Examples include:\n**''[[Fuqua Homes, Inc. v. Beattie]]'', No. 03-3587, 2004 WL 2495842 (8th Cir. Nov. 8, 2004) \u2013 a case found on the Westlaw electronic database, decided by the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]]; the citation includes the case's original docket number (No. 03-3587), and a citation to the electronic database that indicates the date of decision, the database (WL for Westlaw) and a unique serial number in that database (2495842).\n**''[[Chavez v. Metro. Dist. Comm'n]]'', No. 3:02CV458(MRK), 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11266 (D. Conn. June 1, 2004) \u2013 a case decided by the [[U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut]]; the citation includes the case's original docket number (No. 3:02CV458(MRK)), the date of decision, the database (U.S. Dist. LEXIS, indicating the LexisNexis database for U.S. District Court cases), and a unique serial number in that database (11266).\n\nSome court systems\u2014such as the [[California]] state [[Judiciary of California|court system]]\u2014forbid attorneys to cite unpublished cases as precedent. Other systems allow citation of unpublished cases only under specific circumstances. For example, in [[Kentucky]], unpublished cases from that state's courts can only be cited if the case was decided after January 1, 2003, and \"there is no published opinion that would adequately address the issue before the court\".  From 2004 to 2006, federal judges debated whether the [[Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure]] (FRAP) should be amended so that unpublished cases in all circuits could be cited as precedent. In 2006, the Supreme Court, over the objection of several hundred judges and lawyers, adopted a new Rule 32.1 of FRAP requiring that federal courts allow citation of unpublished cases. The rule took effect on January 1, 2007.\n\n===Vendor-neutral citations===\nWith the rise of the web, many courts placed new cases on websites.  Some were published while others never lost their \"unpublished\" status. The major legal citation systems required cites to the officially published page numbers, in which publishers such as [[West Publishing]] claimed a copyright interest.\n\nA vendor-neutral citation movement<ref>[http://www.aallnet.org/Documents/Leadership-Governance/Committees/taskforce.html#Definitions AALL Citation Formats Committee] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209023521/http://www.aallnet.org/Documents/Leadership-Governance/Committees/taskforce.html#Definitions |date=2015-02-09 }}; accessed May 31, 2014.</ref> led to provisions being made for citations to web-based cases and other legal materials. A few courts modified their rules to specifically take into account cases \"published\" on the web.\n\nAn example of a vendor-neutral citation:\n*''[[Equal. Found. of Greater Cincinnati, Inc. v. City of Cincinnati]]'', 1997 FED App. 0318P (6th Cir.) \u2013 a 1997 case decided by the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]]; the citation to the numbering system adopted by the court (\"1997 FED App. 0318P\") eliminates the need to cite to a specific vendor's product, in this case [[West (publisher)|Thomson West]]'s ''[[Federal Reporter]]'' (i.e., 128 F.3d 289).\n\n===Pinpoint citations===\nIn practice, most lawyers go one step farther, once they have developed the correct citation for a case using the rules discussed above. Most court opinions contain holdings on multiple issues, so lawyers need to cite to the page that contains the specific holding they wish to invoke in their own case. Such citations are known as pinpoint citations, \"pin cites\", or \"jump cites\".<ref>[http://libguides.law.tulane.edu/content.php?pid=209935&sid=5027306 Using Pinpoints], Tulane University Law School, Legal Citation Guide.</ref>\n\nFor example, in ''Roe v. Wade'', the U.S. Supreme Court held that the word \"person\" as used in the Fourteenth Amendment does not include the unborn.  That particular holding appears on page 158 of the volume in which the ''Roe'' decision was published.  A full pin cite to ''Roe'' for that holding would be as follows:\n\n* ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 410 U.S. 113, 158 (1973).\n\nAnd a parallel cite to all three U.S. Supreme Court reporters, combined with pin cites for all three, would produce:\n\n* ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 410 U.S. 113, 158, 93 S. Ct. 705, 729, 35 L. Ed. 2d 147, 180 (1973).\n\nBut in its opinions, the Court usually provides a direct pin cite only to the official reporter. The two unofficial reporters, when they reprint the Court's opinions, add on parallel cites to each other, but do not add pin cites.  Therefore, a citation to ''Roe v. Wade'' in a later Supreme Court decision as viewed on Lexis or Westlaw would appear as follows:\n\n* ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 410 U.S. 113, 158, 93 S. Ct. 705, 35 L. Ed. 2d 147 (1973).\n\nEven then, such citations are still quite lengthy, and may look quite mysterious and intimidating to laypersons when they read court opinions. Since the 1980s, there has been an ongoing debate among American judges as to whether they should relegate such lengthy citations to footnotes to improve the readability of their opinions, as strongly urged by [[Bryan A. Garner]], one of the leading authors on [[legal writing]] and style.<ref name=\"Garner\">{{cite book |last1=Garner |first1=Bryan A. |title=The Winning Brief: 100 Tips for Persuasive Briefing in Trial and Appellate Courts |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780199378357 |pages=176-182 |edition=3d}}</ref> Most judges do relegate ''some'' citations to footnotes, but jurists such as Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] and Judge [[Richard Posner]] refuse to use footnotes in their opinions.\n\n===Types of citations===\nThere are two types of citations: proprietary and [[public domain]] citations. There are many citation guides; the most commonly acknowledged is called ''[[The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation]]'', compiled by the ''[[Columbia Law Review]]'', ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', ''[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]'', and ''[[Yale Law Journal]]''. ''Public domain citations'' refer to the official reporters, rather than a publication service such as [[Westlaw]], [[LexisNexis]], particular legal journals, or specialization-specific reporters. States with their own unique style for court documents and case opinions also publish their own style guides, which include information on their citation rules.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Oxford Standard for Citation Of Legal Authorities]] (OSCOLA)\n* [[:Category:Case law reporters|Category:Case law reporters]]\n* [[Citator]]\n* [[German legal citation]]\n* [[Law report]]\n* [[Legal research]]\n* [[Template:Cite court|Template for citing cases on Wikipedia]]\n\n===Law by state (US)===\n*[http://www.re-quest.net/g2g/codes/state/index.htm State Laws, Code, & Statutes]\n*[https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/state_statutes State Statutes by Topic]\n*[https://www.law.cornell.edu/states/listing.html State Statutes by Jurisdiction]\n\n==Notes and references==\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n=== References ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040404074046/http://www.aallnet.org/committee/citation/ucg/index.html American Association of Law Libraries Legal Citation Guide]\n*[https://www.law.cornell.edu/citation/ Introduction to Basic Legal Citation by Peter Martin]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120319234109/http://www.findlaw.com/casecode/ FindLaw for Legal Professionals]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20150617084928/http://denning.law.ox.ac.uk/published/oscola.shtml Oxford Standard Citation Of Legal Authorities]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/user/huddlaw?gl=GB Screencast introduction to OSCOLA]\n*[http://www.legalabbrevs.cardiff.ac.uk/ Cardiff Index to Legal Abbreviations]\n*[http://www.worldlii.org WorldLII]\n* [http://www.law.unimelb.edu.au/mulr/aglc ''Australian Guide to Legal Citation'' official website]\n* [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20130103075657/http://www.law.unimelb.edu.au/469B9330-4CA2-11E2-95000050568D0140 ''Australian Guide to Legal Citation'' in PDF format]\n\n[[Category:Case law reporters|*]]\n[[Category:Legal citation]]\n[[Category:Legal research]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|A system for uniquely identifying individual rulings of a court}}\n{{Selfref|Various case citations redirect here.

Case citations are formatted differently in different [[jurisdiction]]s, but generally contain the same key information.\n\nA '''legal citation''' is a \"reference to a legal precedent or authority, such as a case, statute, or treatise, that either substantiates or contradicts a given position.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Black's Law Dictionary|year=2012|publisher=West|location=St. Paul, Minnesota|isbn=978-0-314-26578-4|edition=9th Abridged|editor-first=Bryan A.|editor-last=Garner|page=221}}</ref> Where cases are published on paper, the citation usually contains the following information:\n* Court that issued the decision\n* Report title\n* Volume number\n* Page, section, or paragraph number\n* Publication year\n\nIn some report series, for example in England, Australia and some in Canada, volumes are not numbered independently of the year: thus the year and volume number (usually no greater than 4) are required to identify which book of the series has the case reported within its covers. In such citations, it is usual in these jurisdictions to apply square [[bracket]]s \"{{bracket|year}}\" to the year (which may not be the year that the case was decided: for example, a case decided in December 2001 may have been reported in 2002).\n\nThe Internet brought with it the opportunity for courts to publish their decisions on websites and most published court decisions now appear in that way.  They can be found through many national and other websites, such as [[WorldLII]] and [https://www.africanlii.org/ AfricanLII], that are operated by members of the [[Free Access to Law Movement]].\n\nThe resulting flood of non-paginated information has led to numbering of paragraphs and the adoption of a medium-neutral citation system. This usually contains the following information:\n* Year of decision\n* Abbreviated title of the court\n* Decision number (not the court file number)\nRather than utilizing page numbers for pinpoint references, which would depend upon particular printers and [[Web browser|browser]]s, pinpoint quotations refer to paragraph numbers.\n\n==Pronunciation of case titles==\n\nIn [[common law]] countries with an [[adversarial system]] of justice, the names of the opposing parties are separated in the case title by the abbreviation ''v'' (usually written as ''v'' in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries and always as ''v.'' in the U.S.) of the Latin word ''versus'', which means ''against''. When case titles are read out loud, the ''v'' can be pronounced, depending on the context, as ''and'', ''against'', ''versus'', or ''vee''.\n\n===Commonwealth pronunciation===\n\nSome Commonwealth countries follow English legal style:\n\n* [[Civil law (common law)|Civil cases]] are pronounced with ''and''. For example, ''Smith v Jones'' would be pronounced \"Smith {{em|and}} Jones\".<ref name=\":0\">[[SOAS University of London|School of Oriental & African Studies]] (SOAS) Library, ''[http://www.soas.ac.uk/library/subjects/law/research/file70250.pdf Understanding UK Case Law]'', Research Guide (London: SOAS Library, August 2012), pp. 5\u20136. 'The small letter \u201cv\u201d is an abbreviation of versus. However, the term \u201cand\u201d is used to pronounce it, rather than \u201cv\u201d or \u201cversus\u201d, e.g. the case \u201cSmith v Jones\u201d would be pronounced \u201cSmith and Jones.\u201d . . . A [criminal] case can be pronounced in a number of ways, e.g. \u201cR. v Smith\u201d would be pronounced either \u201cthe Crown against Smith\u201d, or it can be referred to as simply \u201cSmith.\u201d\u2009'</ref>\n* [[Criminal law|Criminal cases]] are pronounced with ''against''.

A widely used guide to Australian legal citation is the ''[[Australian Guide to Legal Citation]]'' (commonly known as AGLC), published jointly by the ''[[Melbourne University Law Review]]'' and the ''[[Melbourne Journal of International Law]]''.\n\nThe standard case citation format in Australia is:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ''Style of cause''\n! (year of decision)\n! [year of report]\n! volume\n! report\n! (series)\n! page\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| ''[[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)]]''\n| (1992)\n|\n| 175\n| CLR\n|\n| 1.\n|}\n\nAs in Canada, there has been divergence among citation styles. There exist commercial citation guides published by Butterworths and other legal publishing companies, academic citation styles and court citation styles. Each court in Australia may cite the same case slightly differently. There is presently a movement in convergence to the comprehensive academic citation style of the [[Australian Guide to Legal Citation]] published jointly by the ''[[Melbourne University Law Review]]'' and the ''[[Melbourne Journal of International Law]]''.\n\n===Reports===\n{{main list|List of Law Reports in Australia}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The format provides a naming system that does not depend on the publication of the case in a law report.  Most cases are now published on AustLII using neutral citations.<ref name=\"austlii\">[http://austlii.edu.au Austlii.edu.au]</ref>\n\nThe standard format looks like this:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year of decision\n!Court identifier\n!Ordinal number\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|[2005]\n|HCA\n|1\n|}\nSo the above-mentioned ''Mabo'' case would then be cited like this: ''Mabo v Queensland (No 2)'' [1992] HCA 23.\n\nThere is a unique court identifier code for most courts.

Many legal publishing companies and schools have their own standard for citation. Since the late 1990s, however, much of the legal community has converged to a single standard\u2014formulated in ''[[The Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation|The Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation / Manuel canadien de la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence juridique]]'',<ref>''Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation / Manuel canadien de la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence juridique'', 9th ed. (Carswell, 2018-06-29), {{ISBN|978-0-7798-8582-4}}.</ref> commonly known as the \"[[McGill Guide]]\" after the ''[[McGill Law Journal]]'', which first published it. The following format reflects this standard:\n\n:''[[Hunter v. Southam|Hunter v Southam]]'', [1984] 2 SCR 145.\n\nBroken into its component parts, the format is:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ''Style of cause''\n! (year of decision),\n! [year of report]\n! volume\n! report\n! (series)\n! page\n! jurisdiction/court.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| ''[[R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.|R v Big M Drug Mart Ltd]]'',\n|\n| [1985]\n| 1\n| SCR\n|\n| 295.\n|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| ''[[R. v. Oakes|R v Oakes]]'',\n|\n| [1986]\n| 1\n| SCR\n|\n| 103.\n|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| ''Re Canada Trust Co and OHRC''\n| (1990),\n|\n|69\n|DLR\n|(4th)\n|321\n|(Ont CA).\n|}\n\nThe ''Style of Cause'' is italicized as in all other countries and the party names are separated by ''v'' (English) or ''c'' (French). Prior to 1984 the appellant party would always be named first. However, since then case names do not switch order when the case is appealed.\n\nUndisclosed parties to a case are represented by initials (e.g., ''[[R. v. R.D.S|R v RDS]]''). Criminal cases are prosecuted by the Crown, which is always represented by ''R'' for ''Regina'' (queen) or ''Rex'' (king). [[reference question|Reference questions]] (advisory opinions) are always entitled ''Reference re'' followed by the subject title.\n\nIf the year of decision is the same as the year of the report and the date is a part of the reporter's citation, then the date need not be listed after the ''style of cause''. If the date of the decision is different from the year of the report, then both should be shown.\n\nWhere available, cases should be cited with their neutral citation immediately after the ''style of cause'' and preceding the print citation. For example,\n\n:''[[Chaoulli v. Quebec (Attorney General)|Chaoulli v Quebec (Attorney General)]]'', 2005 SCC 35, [2005] 1 SCR 791.\n\nThis format was adopted as the standard in 2006, in the sixth edition of the McGill Guide. Prior to this format, the opposite order of parallel citation was used.\n\nThe seventh edition of the McGill Guide, published 2010-08-20, removes most full stop/period (\".\") characters from the citations, e.g., a citation to the Supreme Court Reports that previously would have been [2005] 1 S.C.R. 791, is now [2005] 1 SCR 791. Most full stops are also removed from styles of cause. The seventh edition also further highlights the significance of neutral citations (i.e., tribunal-assigned citations that are publisher-independent).\n\n====Reports====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

However, most case citations include the same elements.\n\n=== Published decisions ===\nCitations of decisions published in a [[Law report|reporter]] usually consist of the ''name or abbreviation of the reporter'', the ''year or volume'', the ''page number'' where the decision begin (sometimes followed by an ''identifying number'' if more than one judgment is on a page), as well as the ''name or abbreviation of the court which decided the case''. As an example, the \"Aalborg Kloster-judgment\", a precedent-setting [[Supreme Court (Denmark)|Supreme Court]] judgment regarding [[strict liability]], is published in [[Ugeskrift for Retsv\u00e6sen]] volume 1968 as the second judgment on page 84. A citation of this case could take the form {{Nowrap|U.1968.84/2H}}, {{Nowrap|UfR 1968 84/2 H}}, {{Nowrap|Ugeskrift for Retsv\u00e6sen 1968, p. 84/2}}, or something similar. In this case ''U'', ''UfR'' and ''Ugeskrift for Retsv\u00e6sen'' identify the reporter, ''1968'' identifies the year or volume, ''84'' identifies the starting page, ''/2'' indicates that the judgment is the second one on that particular page, and ''H'' identifies the court which decided the case.\n\nCertain reporters, such as Tidsskrift for Skatter og Afgifter, do not identify published decisions by page number, but by a [[serial number]]. Citations to these reporters use the serial number in place of a page number.\n\n=== Unpublished decisions ===\nIf a decision has not been published in a reporter, more identifying information is needed. Generally, citations to unreported cases involve the ''name of the court'', the ''date of the decision'' and the ''case number'' assigned by the court. For example: S\u00f8- og Handelsrettens dom af 3. maj 2018 i sag nr. V-17-17 (The [[Maritime and Commercial Court (Denmark)|Maritime and Commercial Court]]'s judgment of May 3 in case no. V-17-17). Certain authors format these citations to mimic the \"short citation\" of published cases.\n\n=== Neutral citations and the ECLI ===\nThe [[Danish Court Administration]] is currently working on a public database which will make all judgments available to the public (currently only the Supreme Court as well as the Maritime and Commercial Court do this). The database is expected to implement the [[European Case Law Identifier]], which will make uniform, neutral citations of decisions possible.\n\n=== Reporters ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Abbreviation(s)\n!Full name\n!Translated title\n!Topic area\n|-\n|U, UfR\n|Ugeskrift for Retsv\u00e6sen\n|Weekly Reporter of the Judiciary (translated varyingly as \"the Danish Weekly Law Reports\", \"the Weekly Law Journal\", and \"the Weekly Law Review\" by the [[European Court of Human Rights]])\n|The most broad of the reporters.

In e.g. scientific articles, the full citation of a particular case is only used at its first occurrence; after that, its shortened form is used. In most law journals, the articles themselves only use the shortened form; the full citations for all articles sometimes are summarized at the beginning of that journals edition.\n\nA third type (yet not too widely spread) is the citation by using the [[European Case Law Identifier]], a \u2033neutral\u2033 citation system introduced by the [[Council of the European Union]] in 2011, which Germany is participating in.\n\n===Federal Constitutional Court of Germany===\nThe most important cases of the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] are published by the court in its official collection. This collection is abbreviated ''BVerfGE'', whereas ''BVerfG'' is short for ''Bundesverfassungsgericht'', the German court name, and ''E'' stands for ''Entscheidung'' (decision).\n\nStarting in 2004, the court also publishes the BVerfGK collection, containing decisions made only by a ''Kammer'', a specific part of the court.\n\nThe so-called [[:de:Volksz\u00e4hlungsurteil|Volksz\u00e4hlungsurteil]] for example could be cited\n:BVerfGE 65, 1 (43), Urteil des Ersten Senats vom 15. Dezember 1983 auf die m\u00fcndliche Verhandlung vom 18. und 19. Oktober 1983, Az. 1 BvR 209, 269, 362, 420, 440, 484/83.\nin full and\n:BVerfGE 65, 1 (43).\nin short.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! official collection\n! volume\n! page of beginning\n! page cited\n! more detailed information and date\n! case number\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| BVerfGE\n| 65,\n| 1\n| (43),\n| Urteil des Ersten Senats<br />vom 15.

Oktober 1983,\n| Az. 1 BvR 209, 269, 362, 420, 440, 484/83\n|}\n\nFor the meaning of the different case numbers of the BVerfG see [[:de:Aktenzeichen#Verwendete Aktenzeichen des Bundesverfassungsgerichts|the German article]].\n\nIf decisions are not yet published by the court, or will not be published at all, law journals can be cited, e.g.,\n:BVerfG, NJW 2009, 1234 (1235 f.).\nWhere ''NJW'' stands for the law journal [[:de:Neue Juristische Wochenschrift|Neue Juristische Wochenschrift]], 2009 is the year, 1234 the page of the beginning and 1235 the cited page(s) \u2013 \"f.\" stands for \"seq.\". In general, citations of the official collections are preferred.\n\n===Federal Court of Justice of Germany===\nThe [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany]] (Bundesgerichtshof, short BGH) publishes the official collections ''[[:de:BGHSt|BGHSt]]'' for decisions in [[penal law]] and ''[[:de:BGHZ|BGHZ]]'' for those in [[private law]].\n\nThe [[:de:Katzenk\u00f6nigfall|Katzenk\u00f6nigfall]] e.g. would be cited\n:BGHSt 35, 347 ff., Urteil des 4. Strafsenats vom 15. September 1988, Az. 4 StR 352/88.\nin full and\n:BGHSt 35, 347 ff.\nin short (in this example, not a specific page but the case as such is cited; \"ff.\" means \"sqq.\").\n\n===Other federal courts===\nThe official collection of the [[Bundessozialgericht|Federal Social Court of Germany]] (Bundessozialgericht, BSG) is abbreviated ''BSGE''.\n\nThe official collection of the [[Federal Finance Court of Germany]] (Bundesfinanzhof, BFH) is ''BFHE''.\n\nThe official collection of the [[Federal Labor Court of Germany]] (Bundesarbeitsgericht, BAG) is ''BAGE''.\n\nThe official collection of the [[Federal Administrative Court of Germany]] (Bundesverwaltungsgericht, BVerwG) is ''BVerwGE''.\n\n===Other courts===\nFor other courts, generally the same rules apply, though most do not publish an official collection, so they must be cited from a law journal.\n\n===European Case Law Identifier===\nAccording to the [[European Case Law Identifier|ECLI]] system the ''Volksz\u00e4hlungsurteil'' would be cited as \n:ECLI:DE:BVerfG:1983:rs19831215.1bvr020983\nand the ''Katzenk\u00f6nigfall'' as \n:ECLI:DE:BGH:1988:150988U4STR352.88.0\n\n==India==\nIndia's vast federated judicial system admits to a large number of reporters, each with their own style of citation. There are over 200 law reports in India \u2013 subject-wise and state (province)-wise, authorized and unauthorized.\n\n===Supreme Court of India===\nThe official reporter for Supreme Court decisions is the Supreme Court Reports. These reports however lag behind other journals in the speed of reporting. While decisions themselves are uploaded by the Supreme Court itself on ''www.courtnic.nic.in'', the edited versions with headnotes in the official reporter take years to compile. However, some reporters have been authorised to publish the Court's decisions. The ''All India Reporter'' (AIR) is an old and respected reporter that, in addition to the Supreme Court, also reports decisions of the various State High Courts. Other popular reporters include ''Supreme Court Cases'', which has become the most cited report in the Supreme Court, the ''Supreme Court Almanac'', and ''Judgements Today''.\n\n[[File:All India Reporter.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''All India Reporter'']]\n\n''[[Sebastian Hongray v. Union of India]]'':\n* AIR 1984 SC 571 \u2013 \"AIR\" refers to the ''All India Reporter'', \"1984\" is the year of judgement (AIR does not use a volume-based classification), \"SC\" refers to the Supreme Court of India, and \"571\" is the first page number of the report within the volume;\n* (1984) 1 SCC 339 \u2013 \"1984\" is the year of publication, \"1\" is the volume number of the reporter, \"SCC\" stands for ''Supreme Court Cases'' (the name of the reporter), and \"339\" is the first page number of the report within the volume; and\n* 1984 Cri LJ 289 (SC) \u2013 \"1984\" is the year of publication, \"Cri LJ\" is an abbreviation for the ''Criminal Law Journal'' (the name of the reporter), and \"289\" is the first page number of the report within the volume. The \"SC\" in parentheses indicates that the case was heard by the Supreme Court.\n\nA citation of the \"Supreme Court Almanac\":\n* ''[[Additional Secretary, Government of India v. Alka Subhash Gadia]]'' (1990) 2 Scale 1352\n\nA citation in \"Judgements Today\":\n* ''[[Premium Granites v. State of Tamil Nadu]]'' JT (1994) 1 SC 374\n\nThe \"Supreme Court Cases (SCC)\" published supplementary reports for a few years in the early 1990s. Those citations looked like this:\n* ''[[Federation of Mining Associations v. State of Rajasthan]]'' 1992 Supp (2) SCC 239, which points to page 239 of the Second Supplementary Volume of the SCC reports in the year 1992. From 1996 the Supplementary Volumes were numbered in sequence after the regular volumes.\n\nThe SCC also have a separate series of subject-based reporting of the decisions of the Supreme Court:\n* ''[[Rathinam Nagbhushan Patnaik v. Union of India]]'' 1994 SCC (Cri) 740, which refers to the SCC Criminal Reports\n* ''[[Delhi Transport Corporation v. Mazdoor Congress]]'' 1991 SCC (L&S) 1213, which refers to the SCC Labour & Services Reports\n\n===High Courts===\nThe ''All India Reporter'' (AIR) is the most popular nationwide reporter for decisions of the High Courts. An AIR High Court citation looks like: ''[[Surjya Kumar Das v. Maya Dutta]]'' AIR 1982 Cal 222, where \"Cal\" refers to the [[Calcutta High Court]] in [[Kolkata]]. This is a uniform style for AIR High Court reports. Only the shortened indicator of the forum changes for different High Courts. ''The Calcutta Weekly Notes'' is the oldest continuously published [[law journal]] in India having uninterrupted publication since 1896 reporting reportable decisions of the High Court at Calcutta. Reports are cited in the style 105 CWN 345 where 105 refers to the volume number calculated at one volume per year from the initial volume, which had been published in 1896. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n===National Judicial Reference System ([[NJRS]])===\n\nNational Judicial Reference System ([[NJRS]]) is a project started by the Income-tax Department, Government of India. It has been envisaged as a tool to achieve efficiency in the tax litigation process of Income Tax Department (ITD). Within this project the Judicial Research & Reference System (JRRS) \u2013 JRRS is a repository of judicial orders as a single, indexed, searchable, cross-linked, database of Judgments / orders of ITAT, Authority of Advance Ruling (AAR), HC and SC.\n\nThe Citation nomenclature followed within [[NJRS]] :\n* ''[[Chandra Ranganathan & Ors. v. Commissioner of Income-tax]]'' 2009-LL-1021, which refers to [[NJRS]] citations.\n\nThis Citation further allows to add the Authority where the judgment / order was pronounced.\n* ''[[Chandra Ranganathan & Ors. v. Commissioner of Income-tax]]'' 2009-LL-1021-SC, which refers to [[NJRS]] citations.\n\n==New Zealand==\nThe standard case citation format in New Zealand is:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ''Style of cause''\n! (year of decision)\n! [year of reporter]\n! volume\n! reporter\n! page\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| ''Taylor v New Zealand Poultry Board''\n| \n| [1984]\n| 1\n| NZLR\n| 394\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|  ''R v Howse''\n| (2005)\n|\n| 21\n| CRNZ\n| 823\n|}\n\nSeveral leading law reviews in New Zealand have also adopted the ''[[Australian Guide to Legal Citation]]'' (AGLC) such as the ''[[University of Canterbury|Canterbury]] Law Review''. The AGLC style is also rather similar to citation style in New Zealand.\n\n===Reporters===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ''Abbreviation''\n! ''Reporter''\n! ''Years''\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|NZLR\n|New Zealand Law Reports\n|1881 \u2013\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|CRNZ\n|Criminal Reports of New Zealand\n|1983 \u2013\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|NZBORR\n|New Zealand Bill of Rights Reports\n|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|NZAR\n|New Zealand Administrative Reports\n|1976\u2013\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|NZFLR\n|New Zealand Family Law Reports\n|1981\u2013\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|DCR\n|District Court Reports\n|1981\u2013\n|}\n\nAdditionally, a number of other report series exist for specialist areas such as Family, Employment and Tax Law. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n===Neutral citation===\nNew Zealand courts and tribunals have begun to adopt a neutral citation standard for case law. The format provides a naming system that does not depend on the publication of the case in a law report.\n\nThe standard format looks like this:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year of decision\n!Court identifier\n!Ordinal number\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|[2005]\n|NZSC\n|1\n|}\n\nThere is a unique court identifier for each court or tribunal.  These identifiers are:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Court Identifier\n!Court\n!Years\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|NZSC\n|[[Supreme Court of New Zealand]]\n| 2005\u2013\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|NZCA\n|[[New Zealand Court of Appeal]]\n| 2007\u2013\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|NZHC\n|[[High Court of New Zealand]]\n| 2012\u2013\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| NZDC\n|[[District Court of New Zealand]]\n| \n|- valign=\"top\"\n| NZEmpC\n|[[Employment Court of New Zealand]]\n| 2010\u2013\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| NZEnvC\n|[[Environment Court of New Zealand]]\n| 2010\u2013\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| NZFC\n|[[Family Court of New Zealand]]\n| 2012\u2013\n|}\n\nWhere both a neutral citation and a reporter citation exist, the neutral citation should come first e.g. ''R v AM'' [2010] NZCA 114, [2010] 2 NZLR 750\n\n==Norway==\nThe Norwegian standard case citation format for published court decisions is:\n\n:Rt. 1952 s. 989 ''(Telefonsjikanedommen)''\n\nwhere:\n\n* '''Rt.''' identifies the report series.\n** All [[Supreme Court of Norway|supreme court judgments]] are published in Retstidende (Court Times), abbreviated Rt.\n** Many judgments and decisions from lower courts are published in Rettens gang (RG).\n* '''1952''' is the year of reporter\n* '''s.''' is the Norwegian abbreviation for page. This is optional.\n* '''989''' is the first page number of the decision in the reporter.\n* Finally, one can add the popular name of the decision. It is unusual to refer to name of the plaintiff(s) and defendant(s), but often there is an unofficial name. ''Telefonsjikanedommen'' refers to a 1952 case where the Supreme Court ruled that telephone harassment (\"telefonsjikane\") was not illegal under the current criminal code.\n\n==The Philippines==\nDespite the long-standing [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] tradition in the Philippines, reliance on judicial precedents has become indispensable since the period of American rule. [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] decisions are expressly recognized as part of the internal law, and are thus frequently cited in court decisions and legal pleadings. Though there is only one Supreme Court in the Philippines, the citation of its decisions varies, depending on which report of a case is relied on by the person citing that case. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n===Official reporter===\nThe ''Philippine Reports'' is the official reporter of decisions of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]]. The standard format for citation of the ''Philippine Reports'' is:\n\n:''People v. Flores'', 442 Phil. 561 (2002)\n\nwhere:\n\n* ''People v. Flores'' is the name of the case\n* ''442'' is the volume number of the ''Philippine Reports'' where the case may be found\n* ''Phil.'' is the standard abbreviation of ''Philippine Reports''\n* ''561'' is the page number in the ''Philippine Reports'' that contains the beginning of the decision. If this number is followed by a comma then another page number (i.e., ''442 Phil. 561, 563''), the latter number indicates the particular page where the annotated text can be found\n* ''(2002)'' is the year the case was decided.\n\nAs of present, Philippine cases are contained in quarterly issues. The Supreme Court Reports Annotated or SCRA are cited as such:\n\nJuarez v. Court of Appeals 214 SCRA 475\n\nwhere 214 is the volume of the book, and 475 is the page number. There are already over 700 SCRAs in circulation.\n\n===Unofficial reporter===\nIn the last few decades, the ''Philippine Reports'' has suffered from production problems, resulting in long delays in publication, as well as significant gaps within its published series. As a result, the privately published ''Supreme Court Reports Annotated'' (published by Central Professional Books, Inc.) has become more widely used than the ''Philippine Reports'', even by the courts. The proper format for citation of the ''Supreme Court Reports Annotated'' is:\n\n:''Fortich v. Corona'', G.R. No. 131457, 24 April 1998, 289 SCRA 624\n\nwhere:\n\n* ''Fortich v. Corona'' is the name of the case\n* ''G.R. No. 131457'' is the case docket number originally assigned by the Supreme Court at the time the action was filed with the Court (G.R. means ''General Register'')\n* ''24 April 1998'' is the exact date the decision of this case was promulgated\n* ''289'' is the volume number of the ''Supreme Court Reports Annotated'' where the case may be found\n* ''SCRA'' is the standard abbreviation of ''Supreme Court Reports Annotated''\n* ''624'' is the page number in the ''Supreme Court Reports Annotated'' that contains the beginning of the decision. If this number is followed by a comma then another page number (i.e., ''289 SCRA 624, 627''), the latter number indicates the particular page where the annotated text can be found\n\nOwing to the delays in the regular publication of the Philippine Reports, reliance on the SCRA has been tolerated, although if a case may be found at the Philippine Reports, it is preferred that the official reporter be cited in lieu of the SCRA.\n\nWhen citing cases not yet reported in the Philippine Reports or the SCRA, the above citation without reference to the SCRA is preferred (i.e., ''Fortich v. Corona'', G.R. No. 131457, 24 April 1988)\n\n===Lower court decisions===\nAs there are no official or unofficial reporters that regularly publish decisions of the [[Philippine Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]] and other lower courts, citation of their decisions hews to the same format as cases not reported either in the Philippine Reports or the SCRA. Thus: ''(case name)'', ''(docket number)'', ''(Exact date of promulgation of decision)''.\n\n==Switzerland==\nCitations vary by court and by language. Cases of the [[Swiss Federal Supreme Court]] are cited as follows:<ref>{{cite web|title=Schweizerisches Bundesgericht - Zitierregeln|url=https://www.bger.ch/index/juridiction/jurisdiction-inherit-template/jurisdiction-zitierregeln.htm|website=Swiss Federal Supreme Court|accessdate=28 April 2018|language=de}}</ref>\n\nOfficially published cases are cited as ''BGE 133 II 292 [E. 3.2 S. 296]'' (German: ''Bundesgerichtsentscheide'') or ''ATF 133 II 292 [consid. 3.2 p. 296]'' (French: ''arr\u00eats du tribunal f\u00e9d\u00e9ral''). In this example, 133 is the annual issue of the court reports, II the part indicating the division of the Court, and 292 the page on which the decision begins. Optionally, \"E. 3.2\" and \"S. 296\" are the section and page specifically cited.\n\nSupreme Court decisions not selected for official publication are cited as ''Urteil [des Bundesgerichts] 5C.260/2006 vom 30. M\u00e4rz 2007'' or ''arr\u00eat [du Tribunal f\u00e9d\u00e9ral] 5C.260/2006 du 30 mars 2007'' respectively. In this example, 5C is the division of the Court, 260 the case number and 2006 the year in which the case was opened.\n\nThe citation style for cases of the inferior [[federal courts of Switzerland]] is similar.\n\n==United Kingdom==\n\n===Neutral citation===\n{{main|British and Irish Legal Information Institute#Case citations}}\nSince 2001, judgments in the House of Lords, Privy Council, Court of Appeal and Administrative Court have been issued with neutral citations. This system was extended to other parts of the High Court in 2002. Judgments with neutral citations are freely available on the British and Irish Legal Information Institute website (www.bailii.org).\n\t\nNeutral citations identify judgments independently of any series of reports, and cite only parties, year of judgment, court and case number. For example, <br />''Rottman v MPC'' [2002] UKHL 20 <br/>identifies the 20th judgment in 2002 in the UK House of Lords. UKHL stands for UK House of Lords. EWHC and EWCA identify the England and Wales High Court and Court of Appeal respectively. These abbreviations are generally followed by an abbreviation indicating the court or division (e.g. Admin, Ch, Crim, Pat).\n\n===How to cite a case===\n{{see also|Oxford Standard for Citation of Legal Authorities}}\nIf a neutral citation is available for a judgment, it should immediately follow the party names. If the judgment has also been reported in a law reports series, follow the neutral citation with the ''best report'', which is usually from the official Law Reports series (Appeals Cases \u2013 AC, Chancery \u2013 Ch, Family \u2013 Fam, Queen's Bench \u2013 QB etc.).\n\nThe case of ''Rottman v MPC'' was reported in the Appeals Cases, so the citation should be:\n*''Rottman v MPC'' [2002] UKHL 20, [2002] 2 AC 692.\n\nThis means that a report of the case and the judgment can be found in the 2002 volumes, vol 2, of the Law Reports series called Appeals Cases, beginning at page 692.\n\nTo cite a particular paragraph from the judgment, add the paragraph number in square brackets at the end of the citation:\n*''Rottman v MPC'' [2002] UKHL 20, [2002] 2 AC 692 [58].\n\nIf a case is not reported in the Law Reports, the next best report is the Weekly Law Reports (e.g. [2002] 2 WLR 1315), and then the All England Reports (e.g., [2002] 2 All ER 865). In some situations, it might be preferable to cite a specialist series, e.g., ''Rottman v MPC'' was also cited in the Human Rights Law Reports, at [2002] HRLR 32.\n\nFor cases before 2001, cite the best report. If referring to a particular page of the judgment, give that page number after the page number on which the report begins. The following citation refers to page 573 of the ''Donoghue v Stevenson'' judgment:\n\n*''Donoghue v Stevenson'' [1932] AC 562, 573.\n*See [https://web.archive.org/web/20150617084928/http://denning.law.ox.ac.uk/published/oscola.shtml Oxford Standard for the Citation of Legal Authorities]\n\n===England and Wales===\nThe standard case citation format in [[England and Wales]] is:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ''Style of cause''\n! (year of decision),\n! [year of report]\n! volume\n! report\n! (series)\n! page\n! jurisdiction/court\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]''\n|\n| [1932]\n| \n| AC\n|\n| 562\n| (HL).\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]''\n|(1884)\n|\n|14\n|QBD\n|\n|273.\n|\n|}\n\nIn [[England and Wales]] as with certain Commonwealth countries, the abbreviation \"R\" for ''rex'' (king) or ''regina'' (queen), is used for cases in which the state is a party (typically criminal cases or [[judicial review]] cases).\n\n[[Bracket#Square brackets .5B .5D|Square brackets]] \"[ ]\" are used when the year is essential to locating the report (e.g., the official law reports either\u2014as with ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'', above\u2014do not have volume numbers or, if there are multiple volumes in a single year, they are numbered 1, 2, etc.). [[Bracket#Parentheses .28 .29|Round brackets]] \"( )\" are used when the year is not essential but is useful for information purposes, e.g., in reports that have a cumulative volume number such as ''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]'', above.\n\n===Law Reports===\nThe term \"reporter\", meaning a law report or a series of them, is not widely used in England and Wales. Before 1865, English courts used a large number of privately printed reports, and cases were cited based on which report they appeared in. (This system was also used in the United States and other common law jurisdictions during that period.)\n\nTwo main unofficial law reports report all areas of law: the ''Weekly Law Reports'' (WLR) and the ''All England Reports'' (All ER). In addition, a number of unofficial specialist law reports focus on particular areas, e.g., ''Entertainment and Media Law Reports'' (EMLR) or the ''Criminal Appeal Reports'' (Cr App R).\n\nFor the citation of \"The Law Reports\" of the Incorporated Council of Law Reporting, see [[Law Reports]]. These have been published since 1865. They have always been split into a number of different series, the current series being the Appeal Cases (AC), Chancery (Ch), Family (Fam), and Queen's Bench (QB) (or King's Bench\u2014KB\u2014depending on the monarch of the time).

The ''[[Scots Law Times]]'' is cited as \"SLT\".<ref>''Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice'' (1999), p. xix.<!-- ISBN/ISSN needed --></ref>\n\n==United States==\nThe standard case citation format in the United States is:\n:''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 410 U.S. 113 (1973)\nwhere:\n*''Roe v. Wade'' is the abbreviated name of the case. Generally, the first name (here, ''Roe'') is the surname of the [[plaintiff]], who is the party who filed the suit for an original case, or the [[appellant]], the party appealing in a case being appealed from a lower court, or the [[petitioner]] when litigating in the [[Supreme court|high court]] of a jurisdiction; and the second name (here, ''Wade'') is the surname of the [[defendant]], the party responding to the suit, or the [[appellee]], the party responding to the appeal, or the [[respondent]], when defending in the high court of the jurisdiction. Litigants are generally referred to by their last name (when they are natural persons), and a case is generally referred to by the first named litigant on each side of the case. In this example, ''Roe'' refers to \"[[Jane Roe]],\" a pseudonym commonly used when it is appropriate to keep the identity of a litigant out of the public spotlight, and ''Wade'' refers to [[Henry Wade]], the [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]] District Attorney at the time.\n*410 is the volume number of the \"[[Reporter (law)|reporter]]\" that reported the Court's written opinion in the case titled ''Roe v. Wade''.\n*U.S. is the abbreviation of the reporter, or printed book of court opinions. Here, \"U.S.\" stands for ''[[United States Reports]]''.\n*113 is the page number (in volume 410 of ''United States Reports'') where the opinion begins.\n*1973 is the year when the court rendered its decision.\n*The abbreviated name of the court is included inside the parenthesis before the year if the name of the court is not obvious from the reporter. This rule comes into play because certain reporters, such as members of the West [[National Reporter System]], publish opinions originating from multiple courts.  In this example, the name of the court (United States Supreme Court) is obvious (since only decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court are published in ''United States Reports'') and is thus omitted as a matter of convention.\n\nCase citations are used to find a particular case, both when looking up a case in a printed reporter and when accessing it via the Internet or services such as LexisNexis or Westlaw.\n\nThis format also allows different cases with the same parties to be easily differentiated. For example, looking for the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case of ''[[Miller v. California]]'' would yield four cases, some involving different people named Miller, and each involving different issues.\n\n===Supreme Court of the United States===\nCases from the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] are officially printed in the ''[[United States Reports]]''. A citation to the ''United States Reports'' looks like this:\n\n*''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', 347 U.S. 483 (1954).\n*''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'', 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\n\nMany court decisions are published in more than one reporter. A citation to two or more reporters for a given court decision is called a \"parallel citation\". For U.S. Supreme Court decisions, there are several unofficial reporters, including the [[National Reporter System|''Supreme Court Reporter'']] (abbreviated S.&nbsp;Ct.) and ''United States Supreme Court Reports, Lawyers' Edition'' (commonly known simply as ''Lawyers' Edition'') (abbreviated L.&nbsp;Ed.), which are printed by private companies and provide further annotations to the opinions of the Court. Although a citation to the latter two is not required, some attorneys and legal writers prefer to cite all three case reporters at once:\n\n*''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'', 381 U.S. 479, 85 S. Ct. 1678, 14 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1965)\n\nThe \"2d\" after the L.&nbsp;Ed. signifies the second series of the ''Lawyers' Edition''. United States case reporters are sequentially numbered, but the volume number is never higher than 999. When the 1,000th volume is reached (the threshold in earlier years was lower), the volume number is reset to 1 and a \"2d\" is appended after the reporter's abbreviation. Some case reporters are in their third series, and a few are approaching their fourth.\n\nSome very old Supreme Court cases have odd-looking citations, such as ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803). The \"(1 Cranch)\" refers to the fact that, before there was a reporter series known as the ''United States Reports'' compiled by the Supreme Court's [[Supreme Court of the United States Reporter of Decisions|Reporter of Decisions]], cases were gathered, bound together, and sold privately by the Court's Reporter of Decisions. In this example, ''Marbury'' was first reported in an edition by [[William Cranch]], who was responsible for publishing Supreme Court reports from 1801 to 1815. Such reports, named for the individual who gathered them and hence called \"[[nominative reports]]\", existed from 1790 to 1874. Beginning in 1874, the U.S. government created the ''United States Reports'', and at the same time simultaneously numbered the volumes previously published privately as part of a single series and began numbering sequentially from that point. In this way, \"5 U.S. (1&nbsp;Cranch)\" means that it is the 5th overall volume of the ''United States Reports'' series, but the first that was originally published by [[William Cranch]]; four volumes of opinions prior to that were (for example) published by [[Alexander J. Dallas (statesman)|Alexander Dallas]] (for example, \"4 U.S. (4 Dall.)\"), and after Cranch's 9 volumes, 12 more were published by [[Henry Wheaton]] (e.g., \"15 U.S. (2&nbsp;Wheat.)\"). See the [[Supreme Court of the United States Reporter of Decisions]] for other edition names. The name of the reporter of decisions has not been used in citations since the U.S. government began printing the ''United States Reports''.\n\nWhen a case has been decided, but not yet published in the case reporter, the citation may note the volume but leave blank the page of the case reporter until it is determined. For example, ''Golan v. Holder,'' 565 U.S. 302 (2012) was properly cited as ''[[Golan v. Holder]]'', {{nowrap|565 U.S. ___ (2012)}} before publication.\n\nIn the caption of a Supreme Court case, the first name listed is the name of the petitioning (appealing) party, followed by the party responding (respondent) to the appeal.  In most cases, the appealing party was the losing party in the prior court.  This is no longer the practice used in cases in the federal courts of appeal, in which the original alignment of parties from the lower court is preserved.\n\n===Lower federal courts===\n[[File:US Court of Appeals and District Court map.svg|thumb|400px|right|Map of the geographic boundaries of the various United States Courts of Appeals and United States District Courts]]\n[[United States court of appeals]] cases are published in the ''[[Federal Reporter]]'' (F., F.2d, or F.3d). [[United States district court]] cases and cases from some specialized courts are published in the ''[[Federal Supplement]]'' (F. Supp., F. Supp. 2d, or F. Supp. 3d). Both series are published by [[Thomson West]]; they are technically unofficial reporters, but have become widely accepted as the ''de facto'' \"official\" reporters of the lower federal courts because of the absence of a true official reporter. (Of the federal appeals and district courts, only one, the [[D.C. Circuit]], has an official reporter, ''United States Court of Appeals Reports'', and even that one is rarely used today.)<ref>D.C. Circuit Rule 32.1 provides: \"Citations to decisions of this court must be to the Federal Reporter. Dual or parallel citation of cases is not required.\"</ref>\n\nWhen lower federal court opinions are cited, the citation includes the name of the court. This is placed in the parentheses immediately before the year. Some examples:\n\n*''[[Geary v. Visitation of Blessed Virgin Mary School]]'', 7 F.3d 324 (3d Cir. 1993) \u2013 a 1993 case in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]]\n*''[[Glassroth v. Moore]]'', 229 F. Supp. 2d 1290 (M.D. Ala. 2002) \u2013 a 2002 case in the [[U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama]]\n\nU.S. circuit and district court cases from 1789 to 1880 were reported in [[Federal Cases]], abbreviated F. Cas. An example of the citation form is: ''[[Wheaton v. Peters]]'', 29 F. Cas. 862 (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1832) (No. 17,486).\n\n===State courts===\nState court decisions are published in several places. Many states have their own official state reporters, which publish decisions of one or more of that state's courts. Reporters that publish decisions of a state's highest court are abbreviated the same as the state's name (note: this is the traditional abbreviation, not the postal abbreviation), regardless of what the actual title of the reporter is.  Thus, the official reporter of decisions of the [[California Supreme Court]] (titled ''California Reports'') is abbreviated \"Cal.\" (or, for subsequent series, \"Cal. 2d,\" \"Cal. 3d\", or \"Cal. 4th\").\n\n*''[[Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co.]]'', 248 N.Y. 339 (1928), a case in the [[New York Court of Appeals]], reported in ''New York Reports''. Note that the New York Court of Appeals is the highest court in New York. Because the ''New York Reports'' only report opinions of the New York Court of Appeals, there is no need to repeat the court designation before the year.\n*''Green v. [[Chicago Tribune]] Company'', 286 Ill. App. 3d 1 (1996) \u2013 a case in the [[Illinois Appellate Court]], reported in ''Illinois Appellate Court Reports''. Note that, in contrast to New York, the Illinois Appellate Court is only the [[List of state intermediate appellate courts|intermediate court of appeals]] in Illinois; decisions of the [[Illinois Supreme Court]] are reported in ''Illinois Reports'', abbreviated \"Ill.\" (or \"Ill. 2d\"). Because the ''Illinois Appellate Court Reports'' are dedicated solely to reporting decisions of the Illinois Appellate Court, there is no need to repeat the court designation before the year.\n*''Harte v. Hand'', 438 N.J. Super. 545 (Ch. Div. 2014). Note that although all published opinions of the [[New Jersey Superior Court]] are published in the ''New Jersey Superior Court Reports'', the organization of the Superior Court into three divisions (the Law Division, the Chancery Division, and the [[New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division|Appellate Division]]) means the citation must specify which division issued the opinion. This is especially salient as the Appellate Division hears appeals from the Law and Chancery Divisions, as occurred with the example case (a rehearing on remand of ''Harte v. Hand'', 433 N.J. Super. 457 (App. Div. 2013)).\n\n[[File:National Reporter System regions.png|thumb|400px|right|The [[Thomson West]] National Reporter System regions.]]\nIn addition to the official reporters, [[Thomson West]] publishes several series of \"regional reporters\" that cover several states each. These are the ''[[North Eastern Reporter]]'', ''[[Atlantic Reporter]]'', ''[[South Eastern Reporter]]'', ''[[Southern Reporter]]'', ''[[South Western Reporter]]'', ''[[North Western Reporter]]'', and ''[[Pacific Reporter]]''. [[California]], [[Illinois]], and [[New York (state)|New York]] also each have their own line of Thomson West reporters, because of the large volume of cases generated in those states (titled, respectively, ''West's California Reporter'', ''Illinois Decisions'', and ''West's New York Supplement'').  Some smaller states (like [[South Dakota]]) have stopped publishing their own official reporters, and instead have certified the appropriate West regional reporter as their \"official\" reporter.\n\nHere are some examples of how to cite West reporters:\n\n*''Jackson v. Commonwealth'', 583 S.E.2d 780 (Va. Ct. App. 2003) \u2013 a case in the [[Virginia Court of Appeals]] (an intermediate appellate court) published in the ''South Eastern Reporter'''s 2nd series\n*''Foxworth v. Maddox'', 137 So. 161 (Fla. 1931) \u2013 a case in the [[Florida Supreme Court]] published in the ''Southern Reporter''\n*''People v. Brown'', 282 N.Y.S.2d 497 (N.Y. 1967) \u2013 a case in the [[New York Court of Appeals]] (New York's highest court) published in  ''West's New York Supplement'''s 2nd series. The case also appears in West's regional reporter: ''People v. Brown'', 229 N.E.2d 192 (N.Y. 1967). Note, in both forms, that \"N.Y.\" is placed in the parenthetical, because both ''West's New York Supplement'' and the ''North Eastern Reporter'' report the opinions of more courts than only the New York Court of Appeals. A citation to the officially published reports, ''People v. Brown'', 20 N.Y.2d 238 (1967), however, does not require the court name in the parenthetical, because the official ''New York Reports'' only report opinions of the New York Court of Appeals.\n\nAbbreviations for lower courts vary by state, as each state has its own system of trial courts and intermediate appellate courts. When a case appears in both an official reporter and a regional reporter, either citation can be used. Generally, citing to the regional reporter is preferred, since out-of-state attorneys are more likely to have access to these. Many lawyers prefer to include both citations. Some state courts require that parallel citations (in this case, citing to both the official reporter and an unofficial regional reporter) be used when citing cases from any court in that state's system.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nLike the United States Supreme Court, some very old state case citations include an abbreviation of the name of either the private publisher or the [[reporter of decisions]], a state-appointed officer who originally collected and published the cases. For example, in ''Hall v. Bell'', 47 Mass. (6 Met.) 431 (1843), the citation is to volume 47 of ''Massachusetts Reports'', which, like ''United States Reports'', was started in the latter half of the 19th century and incorporated into the series a number of prior editions originally published privately, and began numbering from that point; \"6 Met.\" refers to the 6th volume that had originally been published privately by [[Theron Metcalf]]. An example of a case cited to a reporter that has not been subsequently incorporated into an officially published series is ''[[Pierson v. Post]]'', 3 Cai. 175 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1804), reported in volume 3 of ''Caines' Reports'', page 175, named for [[George Caines]], who had been appointed to report New York cases; the case was before the New York Supreme Court of Judicature (now defunct). Most states gave up this practice in the mid-to-late 19th century, but [[Delaware]] persisted until 1920.\n\nSome states, notably [[California]] and [[New York (state)|New York]], have their own citation systems that differ significantly from the various federal and national standards.<ref>[http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/New_Styman.htm \"New York Law Reports Style Manual\"]</ref> In California, the year is placed ''between'' the names of the parties and the reference to the case reporter; in New York, the year is wrapped by in [[Bracket#Square brackets .5B .5D|bracket]]s instead of [[Bracket#Parentheses ( )|parentheses]]. Both New York and California styles wrap an entire citation in parentheses when used as a stand-alone sentence, although New York places the terminating period outside the parentheses, whereas California places it inside. New York wraps just the reporter and page references in parentheses when the citation is used as a clause. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nEither way, both state styles differ from the national/[[Bluebook]] style of simply dropping in the citation as a separate sentence without further adornment. Both systems use less punctuation and spacing in their reporter abbreviations.\n\nFor example, assuming that it is being placed as a stand-alone sentence, the ''Brown'' case above would be cited (using the official reporter) to a New York court as:\n\n*(''People v. Brown'', 20 NY2d 238 [1967]).\n\nAnd, again, as a stand-alone sentence, the famous ''Greenman'' [[product liability]] case would be cited to a California court as:\n\n*(''Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc.'' (1963) 59 Cal.2d 57.)<ref>[http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C2/59C2d57.htm ''Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc.'' (1963) 59 C2d 57<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===Unpublished decisions===\n{{main|Non-publication}}\nA growing number of court decisions are not published in case reporters.  For example, only 7% of the opinions of the California intermediate courts (the [[California Court of Appeal|Courts of Appeal]]) are published each year. This is mainly because judges certify only significant decisions for publication, due to the massive number of frivolous appeals flowing through the courts and the importance of avoiding information overload.<ref>''Schmier v. Supreme Court'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/CA4/78CA4t703.htm 78 Cal. App. 4th 703] (2000). The plaintiff in this case unsuccessfully challenged the selective publication policy as unconstitutional. The court retorted: \"Appellant either misunderstands or ignores the realities of the intermediate appellate process.\" The court went on to describe the variety of frivolous appeals regularly encountered by the Courts of Appeal, and concluded: \"Our typical opinions in such cases add nothing to the body of stare decisis, and if published would merely clutter overcrowded library shelves and databases with information utterly useless to anyone other than the actual litigants therein and complicate the search for meaningful precedent.\"</ref>\n\nIt is also argued that this is in part because in many states, especially California, the legislature has failed to expand the judiciary to keep up with population growth (for various political and fiscal reasons). To deal with their crushing caseloads, many judges prefer to write shorter-than-normal opinions that dispose of minor issues in the case in a sentence or two. They avoid publishing such abbreviated opinions, however, so as not to risk creating bad [[precedent]]s. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nAttorneys have several options in citing \"unpublished\" decisions:\n* For cases that have not been published or put in an electronic database, or very recently decided cases that have not ''yet'' been published or put in an electronic database, a citation to the case's docket number before the court that decided it is required.\n**''Groucho Marx Prods. v. Playboy Enters.'', No. 77 Civ. 1782 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 30, 1977) \u2013 a decision of the [[U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]]; the docket number and specific date allow a researcher to track down the printed copy maintained by the court if needed (legal citation forms strongly prefer citations to traditional printed resources).\n* Even though only some decisions of the U.S. Courts of Appeal are considered \"published\" (those appearing in ''Federal Reporter''), Thomson West has recently started making available all decisions officially considered \"unpublished\" in a separate publication called ''Federal Appendix'' (abbreviated \"F. App'x\").\n* Cases intentionally left officially unpublished are nonetheless often \"published\" on computer services, such as [[LexisNexis]] and [[Westlaw]]. These services have their own citation formats based on the year of the case, an abbreviation indicating the computer service (or a specific database of that computer service), and an identification number; citations to online databases also usually include the case's [[docket (court)|docket]] number and the specific date when it was decided (due to the preference for citation to traditional printed resources). Examples include:\n**''[[Fuqua Homes, Inc. v. Beattie]]'', No. 03-3587, 2004 WL 2495842 (8th Cir. Nov. 8, 2004) \u2013 a case found on the Westlaw electronic database, decided by the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]]; the citation includes the case's original docket number (No. 03-3587), and a citation to the electronic database that indicates the date of decision, the database (WL for Westlaw) and a unique serial number in that database (2495842).\n**''[[Chavez v. Metro. Dist. Comm'n]]'', No. 3:02CV458(MRK), 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11266 (D. Conn. June 1, 2004) \u2013 a case decided by the [[U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut]]; the citation includes the case's original docket number (No. 3:02CV458(MRK)), the date of decision, the database (U.S. Dist. LEXIS, indicating the LexisNexis database for U.S. District Court cases), and a unique serial number in that database (11266).\n\nSome court systems\u2014such as the [[California]] state [[Judiciary of California|court system]]\u2014forbid attorneys to cite unpublished cases as precedent. Other systems allow citation of unpublished cases only under specific circumstances. For example, in [[Kentucky]], unpublished cases from that state's courts can only be cited if the case was decided after January 1, 2003, and \"there is no published opinion that would adequately address the issue before the court\".  From 2004 to 2006, federal judges debated whether the [[Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure]] (FRAP) should be amended so that unpublished cases in all circuits could be cited as precedent. In 2006, the Supreme Court, over the objection of several hundred judges and lawyers, adopted a new Rule 32.1 of FRAP requiring that federal courts allow citation of unpublished cases. The rule took effect on January 1, 2007.\n\n===Vendor-neutral citations===\nWith the rise of the web, many courts placed new cases on websites.  Some were published while others never lost their \"unpublished\" status. The major legal citation systems required cites to the officially published page numbers, in which publishers such as [[West Publishing]] claimed a copyright interest.\n\nA vendor-neutral citation movement<ref>[http://www.aallnet.org/Documents/Leadership-Governance/Committees/taskforce.html#Definitions AALL Citation Formats Committee] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209023521/http://www.aallnet.org/Documents/Leadership-Governance/Committees/taskforce.html#Definitions |date=2015-02-09 }}; accessed May 31, 2014.</ref> led to provisions being made for citations to web-based cases and other legal materials. A few courts modified their rules to specifically take into account cases \"published\" on the web.\n\nAn example of a vendor-neutral citation:\n*''[[Equal. Found. of Greater Cincinnati, Inc. v. City of Cincinnati]]'', 1997 FED App. 0318P (6th Cir.) \u2013 a 1997 case decided by the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]]; the citation to the numbering system adopted by the court (\"1997 FED App. 0318P\") eliminates the need to cite to a specific vendor's product, in this case [[West (publisher)|Thomson West]]'s ''[[Federal Reporter]]'' (i.e., 128 F.3d 289).\n\n===Pinpoint citations===\nIn practice, most lawyers go one step farther, once they have developed the correct citation for a case using the rules discussed above. Most court opinions contain holdings on multiple issues, so lawyers need to cite to the page that contains the specific holding they wish to invoke in their own case. Such citations are known as pinpoint citations, \"pin cites\", or \"jump cites\".<ref>[http://libguides.law.tulane.edu/content.php?pid=209935&sid=5027306 Using Pinpoints], Tulane University Law School, Legal Citation Guide.</ref>\n\nFor example, in ''Roe v. Wade'', the U.S. Supreme Court held that the word \"person\" as used in the Fourteenth Amendment does not include the unborn.  That particular holding appears on page 158 of the volume in which the ''Roe'' decision was published.  A full pin cite to ''Roe'' for that holding would be as follows:\n\n* ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 410 U.S. 113, 158 (1973).\n\nAnd a parallel cite to all three U.S. Supreme Court reporters, combined with pin cites for all three, would produce:\n\n* ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 410 U.S. 113, 158, 93 S. Ct. 705, 729, 35 L. Ed. 2d 147, 180 (1973).\n\nBut in its opinions, the Court usually provides a direct pin cite only to the official reporter. The two unofficial reporters, when they reprint the Court's opinions, add on parallel cites to each other, but do not add pin cites.  Therefore, a citation to ''Roe v. Wade'' in a later Supreme Court decision as viewed on Lexis or Westlaw would appear as follows:\n\n* ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 410 U.S. 113, 158, 93 S. Ct. 705, 35 L. Ed. 2d 147 (1973).\n\nEven then, such citations are still quite lengthy, and may look quite mysterious and intimidating to laypersons when they read court opinions. Since the 1980s, there has been an ongoing debate among American judges as to whether they should relegate such lengthy citations to footnotes to improve the readability of their opinions, as strongly urged by [[Bryan A. Garner]], one of the leading authors on [[legal writing]] and style.<ref name=\"Garner\">{{cite book |last1=Garner |first1=Bryan A. |title=The Winning Brief: 100 Tips for Persuasive Briefing in Trial and Appellate Courts |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780199378357 |pages=176-182 |edition=3d}}</ref> Most judges do relegate ''some'' citations to footnotes, but jurists such as Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] and Judge [[Richard Posner]] refuse to use footnotes in their opinions.\n\n===Types of citations===\nThere are two types of citations: proprietary and [[public domain]] citations. There are many citation guides; the most commonly acknowledged is called ''[[The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation]]'', compiled by the ''[[Columbia Law Review]]'', ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', ''[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]'', and ''[[Yale Law Journal]]''. ''Public domain citations'' refer to the official reporters, rather than a publication service such as [[Westlaw]], [[LexisNexis]], particular legal journals, or specialization-specific reporters. States with their own unique style for court documents and case opinions also publish their own style guides, which include information on their citation rules.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Oxford Standard for Citation Of Legal Authorities]] (OSCOLA)\n* [[:Category:Case law reporters|Category:Case law reporters]]\n* [[Citator]]\n* [[German legal citation]]\n* [[Law report]]\n* [[Legal research]]\n* [[Template:Cite court|Template for citing cases on Wikipedia]]\n\n===Law by state (US)===\n*[http://www.re-quest.net/g2g/codes/state/index.htm State Laws, Code, & Statutes]\n*[https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/state_statutes State Statutes by Topic]\n*[https://www.law.cornell.edu/states/listing.html State Statutes by Jurisdiction]\n\n==Notes and references==\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n=== References ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040404074046/http://www.aallnet.org/committee/citation/ucg/index.html American Association of Law Libraries Legal Citation Guide]\n*[https://www.law.cornell.edu/citation/ Introduction to Basic Legal Citation by Peter Martin]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120319234109/http://www.findlaw.com/casecode/ FindLaw for Legal Professionals]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20150617084928/http://denning.law.ox.ac.uk/published/oscola.shtml Oxford Standard Citation Of Legal Authorities]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/user/huddlaw?gl=GB Screencast introduction to OSCOLA]\n*[http://www.legalabbrevs.cardiff.ac.uk/ Cardiff Index to Legal Abbreviations]\n*[http://www.worldlii.org WorldLII]\n* [http://www.law.unimelb.edu.au/mulr/aglc ''Australian Guide to Legal Citation'' official website]\n* [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20130103075657/http://www.law.unimelb.edu.au/469B9330-4CA2-11E2-95000050568D0140 ''Australian Guide to Legal Citation'' in PDF format]\n\n[[Category:Case law reporters|*]]\n[[Category:Legal citation]]\n[[Category:Legal research]]\n", "name_user": "TrivendraRawat", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(add citation)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_citation"}
