In addition to fishing many visit Namdalseid to experience the beautiful mountain scenery and to do some hunting.\n\nNamdalseid also had some [[industry]].

During the 2012 Newcastle Knights season he was credited with the resurgence in [[Willie Mason]]'s career after Bennett had agreed to sign the 31-year-old after an aborted attempt at a [[rugby union]] career in France. The Knights failed to make the finals in the 2012 season, the first finals series not to feature Bennett in 21 years.\n\nFor the [[2013 Newcastle Knights season]] Bennett took the club within one match of the [[2013 NRL Grand Final]].

Bonville's father died before Bonville reached adulthood. As a result, he grew up in the household of his grandfather and namesake, who was a prominent member of the Devon gentry. Both Bonville's father and grandfather had been successful in politics and land acquisition, and when Bonville came of age, he gained control of a large estate. He augmented this further by a series of lawsuits against his stepfather, [[Richard Stucley]]. Bonville undertook royal service, which then meant fighting in France in the later years of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. In 1415, he joined the [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u20131453)|English invasion of France]] in the retinue of [[Thomas, Duke of Clarence]], [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]'s brother, and fought in the [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt campaign]]. Throughout his life, Bonville was despatched on further operations in France, but increasingly events in the southwest of England took up more of his time and energy, as he became [[Bonville\u2013Courtenay feud|involved in a feud]] with his powerful neighbour [[Thomas de Courtenay, 5th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon]].\n\nIn 1437, King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] granted Bonville the profitable office of steward of the [[Duchy of Cornwall]]. This had traditionally been a hereditary office of the earls of Devon, and the Earl was enraged at its loss. The dispute soon descended into violence, and Bonville and Courtenay ravaged each other's properties. The situation was exacerbated in 1442 when the Crown appointed Courtenay to effectively the same stewardship it had appointed Bonville, which inflamed the situation even more. The feud between them continued intermittently for the next decade. Generally, Henry and his government failed to intervene between the two parties; when it did, its efforts were ineffectual. On one occasion Bonville was persuaded to undertake further service in France\u2014primarily to get Bonville out of the region\u2014but the mission was poorly funded, a military failure, and when Bonville returned the feud reignited. In 1453, King Henry became ill and entered a [[catatonic state]] for eighteen months, heightening the political factionalism that had riven the reign.\n\nBonville generally seems to have remained loyal to the king, although his guiding motivation was to support whoever would aid him in his struggle against Courtenay. Their feud was part of a broader breakdown in law and order which eventually evolved into the [[Wars of the Roses]] in 1455. Bonville seems to have managed to avoid implication in the variable swings in political fortune which followed until 1460. At this point, he threw in his lot with the rebellious [[Richard, Duke of York]]. His new allegiance brought him little profit; his son was killed alongside York at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] in December 1460, while Bonville himself took part in the [[Second Battle of St Albans]] two months later on the losing side; with [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th Earl of Devon|the new Earl of Devon]] watching, he was [[Decapitation|beheaded]] on 18 February 1461.\n\n== Background and early life ==\nThe Bonvilles were one of the major [[gentry]] families of late-fourteenth-century Devon, often working in close co-operation with their neighbours. The most important of these were the [[House of Courtenay|Courtenay]] [[Earl of Devon|earls of Devon]]. Bonville's grandfather had been a [[Retainer (medieval)|retainer]] of the 11th Earl, [[Edward de Courtenay, 3rd/11th Earl of Devon|Edward]]. The historian [[Christine Carpenter (historian)|Christine Carpenter]] comments, on the family's social position, that they were of sufficiently \"landed and official status to be regarded as what might be termed 'super-knights'{{tsp}}\";{{Sfn|Carpenter|2012|p=76}} she echoed the medievalist [[K. B. McFarlane]], who had previously described the family as \"a powerful and respected element in Devon...there was no need for them to stand in dread of the great, for they were not small themselves\".{{Sfn|McFarlane|1981|p=16}}\n[[File:OldShuteHouseGreatHallFromWest.jpg|upright=1.2|alt=Late fourteenth-century section of Bonville's birthplace.|left|thumb|Very little of the original medieval manor house remains of Bonville's birthplace; the section shown here is from the late fourteenth century.]]\nWilliam Bonville was born on either 12 or 31 August 1392{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} or 1393 in [[Shute, Devon]], to John Bonville (d. 1396) and Elizabeth Fitzroger (c. 1370\u2013c. 1414).{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} William Bonville's grandfather was his namesake Sir William Bonville, who had been [[member of Parliament]] for [[Somerset]] and Devon on multiple occasions{{Sfn|Roskell|Clark|Rawcliffe|1993a}} and has been described by a historian as one of \"the most prominent west-country gentry in the late fourteenth century\".{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} On hearing of the birth of his grandson, a contemporary reports, Sir William \"raised his hands to heaven and praised God\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Along with the [[Newenham Abbey|Abbot of Newenham]], he stood [[godparent]] to the young William.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} The younger William was heir to both his father and grandfather; the latter\u2014who had married twice\u2014had substantially expanded the family [[Inheritance|patrimony]].{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} He has been described by the scholar [[Ralph A. Griffiths|Ralph Griffiths]] as a \"capable, energetic and well-connected man\".{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=574}}\n\nBonville's father died when his son was four,{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} and young William probably grew up in his grandfather's household.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Grandfather Bonville died in 1408,{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} while Bonville was still legally a [[Minor (law)|minor]].{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} As was customary, [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]] took both Bonville's [[Ward (law)|wardship]] and marriage into his own hands. This was valuable [[Royal Patronage|royal patronage]],{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}} which the King granted firstly to Sir [[John Tiptoft, 1st Baron Tiptoft|John Tiptoft]],{{Sfn|Roskell|1983|p=111}} and then to [[Edward, Duke of York]].{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} Bonville had a younger brother, Thomas, who, by the time William came of age, had already married a cousin of Robert, Baron Poynings. This connection to the Poynings family, the historian [[J. S. Roskell]] has suggested, was instrumental in Bonville's own marriage.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}}\n\n=== Marriages and children ===\nBonville married twice. In 1414 he married Margaret Grey, daughter of [[Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn|Reginald, Baron Grey of Ruthin]].{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=574}} Lord Grey promised to pay 200 marks{{Refn|A medieval English mark was an [[Unit of account|accounting unit]] equivalent to two-thirds of a pound.{{sfn|Harding|2002|p=xiv}}|group=note}} to Bonville on the wedding day, and Bonville likewise contracted to settle estates to the value of \u00a3100 on himself and his wife, [[Jointure|jointly]]. Grey also paid another 200 marks in instalments over the following four years.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Sometime between April 1426 and October 1427{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}}\u2014when Bonville received a [[papal dispensation]] to marry again\u2014Margaret Grey died. Bonville made his next marriage to Elizabeth Courtenay, widow of [[John Harington, 4th Baron Harington|John, Baron Harington]]. Elizabeth was the daughter of Bonville's grandfather's local associate, Edward Earl of Devon.{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|pp=218\u2013219}} The couple required a dispensation to marry because Elizabeth was already a godmother to one of Bonville's daughters; in the eyes of the church, this placed her within a prohibited degree of [[consanguinity]].{{sfn|Attreed|2001|p=128}} Elizabeth was already well connected\u2014her brother-in-law was Lord Harington, and the Earl of Devon her nephew{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\u2014and this marriage greatly increased Bonville's links to the [[Peerage of England|peerage]].\n\nBonville's son and heir by Margaret, also named [[William Bonville, 6th Baron Harington|William]], married Lord Harington's only daughter Elizabeth around 1443.{{sfn|Kleineke|2015|p=121}} Two of Bonville's daughters\u2014Margaret and Philippa{{Refn|name=\"P\"|group=note}}\u2014married William Courtenay and William Grenville respectively; they were both scions of cadet branches of the Courtenay family. Bonville's third daughter, Elizabeth,{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} married an important Midlands landowner, [[William Tailboys|Sir William Tailboys]] by November 1446.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=580}} These marriages further enhanced Bonville's aristocratic and political connections.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\nBonville had an illegitimate son, John, by Isabel Kirkby.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} John married Alice Denys and was [[Financial endowment|endowed]] in 1453.{{sfn|Kleineke|2015|p=122}} On Bonville's death, he bequeathed John a \"substantial\" property. He died in 1499.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} {{Location map|Devon|width=230|float=right|caption=The location of Shute, Bonville's birthplace, within Devon and England.|label=Shute|mark=Red_pog.svg|lat_deg=|lon_deg=|lat=50.7712|long=-3.0602}}\n\n=== Estates and wealth ===\nBonville's father and grandfather had both had successful careers.{{Sfn|Roskell|Clark|Rawcliffe|1993a}} As such, when Bonville [[Age of majority|came of age]] in 1414{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}} he inherited an income of approximately \u00a3900 per annum; for context, the historian [[Martin Cherry]] says this was \"a figure not far short of that enjoyed by the fifteenth-century earls of Devon themselves\".{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} His lands\u2014comprising 18 manors{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}}\u2014were situated all over England, although concentrated in Devon, particularly around Shute in the southeast of the county, and Somerset.{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} These lands encompassed his grandfather's patrimony, with manors in Devon, Somerset, Dorset and [[Wiltshire]]. The Fitzroger estates were mainly in [[Leicestershire]], the [[East Midlands]], and the southeast of England in [[Kent]] and [[Sussex]].{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\nOwing to the deaths of their husbands in 1396 and 1408 respectively,{{sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}} Bonville's mother and grandmother each held a third of his inheritance in [[dower]].{{Refn|The legal concept of dower had existed since the late twelfth century as a means of protecting a woman from being left landless if her husband died first. He would, when they married, assign certain estates to her\u2014a ''dos nominata'', or dower\u2014usually a third of everything he was [[seisin|seised]] of. By the fifteenth century, the widow was deemed entitled to her dower;{{sfn|Kenny|2003|pp=59\u201360}} the historian [[Rowena Archer]] argues that this made it \"one of the most destructive of baronial incidents\" on account of how a long-lived [[dowager]] could reduce an inheritance over generations.{{sfn|Archer|1984|p=16}}|group=note}} His mother had remarried in 1397, to [[Richard Stucley]],{{refn|Also spelled Styuecle.{{Sfn|Roskell|Clark|Rawcliffe|1993b}}|group=note}} an important [[Essex]] landowner. In 1410 she granted Stucley a life-interest in her inheritance, with [[remainder (law)|remainder]] to their children.{{Sfn|Roskell|Clark|Rawcliffe|1993b}} On her death in April 1414{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}} Stucley thereby gained Devon lands worth around \u00a3105 per annum{{Sfn|Roskell|Clark|Rawcliffe|1993b}} as well as Wiltshire manors of the Bonville estate, including the valuable manor of [[Chewton Mendip|Chewton]]. Stucley based his claim on the tradition of [[Courtesy of England|courtesy]]. On reaching his legal majority, Bonville sued his stepfather for his maternal inheritance. This struggle took over six years, but he succeeded in establishing his rights to the estates by 1422. Bonville's grandmother survived until 1426; by then Bonville had also inherited substantial estates from other relatives, including a cousin and an aunt. These brought him the manors of [[Yelverton, Devon|Yelverton]] and [[Mudford Sock]], and as a result, says the ''[[History of Parliament]]'', \"without doubt Bonville ranked among the very wealthiest landowners of the West Country\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\n== Political career and royal service ==\n[[File:Taunton Castle 03.jpg|upright=1.2|alt=Taunton Castle in 2017|thumb|The main gate, in 2017, of Bonville's castle at Taunton, which was besieged by the Earl of Devon|left]]\nBonville undertook [[Hundred Years' War|royal service in France]] in 1415, and joined Henry V's [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt campaign]], travelling in the [[retinue]] of the King's brother, [[Thomas, Duke of Clarence]]. While in [[Normandy]], sometime before his seventeenth birthday, Bonville was knighted.{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}}{{refn|It is unknown, however, whether Bonville fought in the Battle of Agincourt itself. The historian [[Clifford J. Rogers]] notes that the numbers known to have begun the campaign had been reduced by early losses, sickness and those otherwise invalided\nto England after the [[Siege of Harfleur]] in particular.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|p=52}}|group=note}}\n\nIn 1421, Bonville acted as one of the Duke of Clarence's [[executor]]s following the latter's death at the [[Battle of Baug\u00e9]]. Roskell suggests that Bonville must have been greatly trusted by Clarence\u2014at the time of his death, [[heir presumptive]] to the English throne\u2014because the Duke had borrowed money from Bonville.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}} Bonville had returned to England before May, when he attended parliament at [[Westminster Hall|Westminster]].{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Henry V died in France in August 1422 leaving his six-month-old son [[Henry VI of England|Henry]] as his heir, and his surviving brothers, [[John, Duke of Bedford]] and [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]] as the baby King's [[regents]].{{sfn|Matusiak|2012|pp=232\u2013233}}{{refn|Clarence had predeceased King Henry, having been killed at the [[Battle of Baug\u00e9]] the previous year.{{sfn|Matusiak|2012|p=218}}|group=note}} The war in France continued in spite of Henry VI's youth, and Bonville returned in 1423 in Gloucester's army. Bonville fought in the campaign to regain [[Le Crotoy]], bringing with him a retinue of ten [[Man-at-arms|men-at-arms]] and 30 archers.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\nOn his return to England, much of Bonville's time was occupied with the administration of his estates. Extensive as they were, there was occasional friction\u2014some of it violent\u2014with his neighbours.{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} In 1427 he was engaged in a bitter feud with [[Thomas Brooke (died 1439)|Sir Thomas Brooke]], whom Bonville\u2014described as a \"thrusting and able man\"{{Sfn|Wilkinson|1995|p=311}}\u2014accused of unilaterally [[Enclosure|enclosing]] parkland in [[Axmouth]] and obstructing roads that Bonville's tenants needed to use. The matter went to the [[arbitration]] of Bonville's godfather, the Abbot of Newenham, who found against Brooke, who had to pay all Bonville's legal costs and reverse his enclosure.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} By now, Bonville was also a royal official, having been appointed [[Sheriff of Devon]] in 1423,{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} although he received few other [[Royal Commission|commissions]] in the county before 1430.{{Refn|Prior to the 1430s, he was only appointed to [[Commission of array|commissions of array]] for [[Dorset]] in April 1418 and March 1419.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}|group=note}} From then on he was regularly occupied with his duties as a royal official in the region: he was a [[justice of the peace]] for Devon from July 1431, for Somerset from March 1435, and for Cornwall from November 1438.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}} Other commissions included local inquiries into [[necromancy]], piracy, [[extortion]], [[desertion]] (from the [[Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick's]] fleet in 1438), [[felonies]], smuggling, and [[Concealment of treasure trove|concealment of treasure]].{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\nIn 1437 King Henry VI's minority ended, and he began his personal rule. Bonville was appointed to the [[King's Council]], being described as a \"King's knight\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} He was zealous in combating piracy off the Cornish coast, to such an extent that in 1454 the [[Philip the Good|Duke of Burgundy]] made an official complaint to the English government about the treatment meted out to Burgundian shipping in the area.{{sfn|Cherry|1979|p=95}} In 1440 Bonville, with Sir Philip Courtenay\u2014a close friend of Bonville's{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=574}}\u2014commanded a small fleet{{Sfn|Barker|2009|p=305}} of thirty [[galley]]s to patrol the [[English Channel|Channel]]. They saw little action; the occasional encounters with the enemy did not necessarily go in their favour, as on one occasion rival Portuguese merchants captured two ships from Bonville's fleet.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\n=== Feud with the Earl of Devon ===\n{{See also|Bonville\u2013Courtenay feud}}\n\n==== 1437\u20131440 ====\nIn 1437, Bonville was appointed [[Steward (office)|Steward]] of the [[Cornwall|county of Cornwall]] for life, for which he received a salary of 40 [[Mark (currency)|marks]] yearly.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}} This immediately made him an enemy of the young Earl of Devon, [[Thomas de Courtenay, 5th/13th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay]];{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|pp=574\u2013575}} Courtenay's wealth was already reduced by his mother's dower,{{Sfn|Archer|1984|p=26}}{{Refn|Courtenay had been born in 1414, had come of age in 1425, but his mother, Anne Talbot, survived until 1441. During this time she controlled,{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=574}} through both her dower and [[jointure]]s, approximately two-thirds of the Courtenay inheritance. Furthermore, she had set up a council to manage the estate.

During his absence, Courtenay had become increasingly powerful in Devon. The King, though, was revealing himself to be a weak-willed monarch, unwilling\u2014or unable\u2014to impose the [[Peace (law)|King's peace]] in the southwest, or, for that matter, elsewhere. Henry was under the influence of his [[favourite]], [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk|William de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk]],{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} and Suffolk's government could not afford to alienate the Earl of Devon. Conversely, Suffolk was still an attractive ally for Bonville against the Earl,{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=576}} as Bonville's Lincolnshire associate{{sfn|Virgoe|1997|p=291}} and later son-in-law, Tailboys, was closely linked with Suffolk.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}}{{Refn|William Tailboys has been described by the historian [[Roger Virgoe]] as \"exceptionally violent and unscrupulous even for that age\".

In 1444 Bonville joined the duke's retinue to France, where Bonville played a central role in the [[Betrothal|betrothal ceremony]] between King Henry and his bride-to-be, [[Margaret of Anjou]]. By a [[writ]] of 10 March the following year{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=353}} Bonville was elevated to the peerage.{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} This was both in recognition of his successes in France{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=576}}\u2014it had been a \"turbulent period\" in Gascony{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=356}}\u2014but also a reflection of the esteem Suffolk held him in.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=576}} As Baron Bonville of Chewton; he was summoned to every parliament until the end of his life as ''Willelmo Bonville domino Bonville et de Chuton''.{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} In 1446 Bonville suppressed a revolt in Somerset, in which [[Wells Cathedral]] was attacked by \"insurgents against the peace of the Church and the King\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\nBonville's association with Suffolk was not to last. In early 1450, the duke was [[Impeachment|impeached in the]] House of Lords and [[exile]]d as a result. Suffolk was subsequently murdered ''en route'' to the continent. Roskell notes that, although Bonville is known to have attended this parliament, it remains unknown what position he took\u2014if he took any\u2014on Suffolk's impeachment.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}} One of the most powerful critics of Suffolk's government had been [[Richard, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]], and the Earl of Devon soon allied himself with the duke as a means of furthering his position in the [[West Country]]. Courtenay saw his newly-reinforced position as sufficiently secure to allow him to reignite the feud with Bonville,{{Sfn|Radford|1912|p=254}} who in Taunton was recruiting men to his banner at [[Sixpence (British coin)|sixpence]] a day.{{Sfn|Hicks|1998|p=93}} To this end he launched a series of raids onto Bonville properties, which culminated in Courtenay's [[Besiege|besieging]] of Bonville's [[Taunton Castle]]{{Sfn|Radford|1912|p=254}} with a force of over 5,000 men{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=576}}\u2014a crisis that the contemporary [[chronicle]]r [[William Worcester]] described as \"''maxima perturbatio''\".{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}}{{Refn|Translated to English, Worcester described it as \"the greatest disturbance\".{{sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}}|group=note}} Fighting alongside Courtenay was [[Edward Brooke, 6th Baron Cobham|Edward Brooke, Lord Cobham]], son of the Thomas Brooke whom Bonville had feuded with over a decade previously.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Courtenay's alliance with York was not as strong as the Earl believed, and when York arrived in Devon to restore order, he promptly cast both Bonville and Courtenay, with many of their retainers, into prison{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} for a month.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=692}} Bonville was forced to put Taunton Castle into the duke's custody.{{Sfn|Gillingham|1993|p=72}} This particular phase of the feud was suspended by the holding of a [[Loveday (arbitration)|loveday]] (''dies amoris'') between Bonville and Courtenay at [[Colcombe Castle|Colcombe]] in 1451. This was an important enough political event for it to warrant the attendance of [[Richard Woodville, 1st Earl Rivers|Richard, Lord Rivers]] and his wife [[Jacquetta of Luxembourg|Jacquetta, Lady Rivers]] as the King's representatives.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=596}}\n\nThe Earl of Devon's continuing alliance with York brought Courtenay further problems in 1452. By then, York felt excluded from the government as the King had a new favourite, [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Edmund, Duke of Somerset]]. In February that year York rebelled and marched on London with a large force. He faced the King's army at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]], southeast of London. Courtenay stood alongside him. Somerset and much of the rest of the nobility faced York and Courtenay down: they surrendered without a fight.{{Sfn|Radford|1912|p=255}} Bonville had raised a body of men to join the King's army,{{Sfn|Goodman|1981|p=20}} and subsequently profited from Courtenay's disfavour with the King.{{sfn|Carpenter|1997|p=128}} The historian [[A. J. Pollard]] suggests that Bonville was given \"a free hand\" in the region as a result of York's and Devon's eclipse{{Sfn|Pollard|2000|p=136}} and according to Cherry, this allowed Bonville to become the predominant figure in county politics.{{Sfn|Cherry|1981b|p=132}} He was commissioned to oversee the arrest and prosecution of the Earl of Devon's men after Blackheath, and the following year King Henry demonstrated the esteem Bonville stood in when, during Henry's [[royal progress]] through the southwest, he stayed at Bonville's [[Caput baroniae|''caput'']] of Shute.{{Sfn|Wolffe|1981|p=259}} Bonville received further offices and responsibilities. He was confirmed as steward of the Duchy of Cornwall, reappointed seneschal of Gascony and also made [[lieutenant of Aquitaine]]. Bonville has been described by historians connected to ''The [[Gascon Rolls]] Project'' as being \"an excellent choice for lieutenant\"{{sfn|Gascon Rolls|2014}}{{refn|The office of lieutenant of Aquitaine went back to at least 1278,{{sfn|Gascon Rolls|2014}} and since the [[Duke of Aquitaine]] was also King of England, the lieutenant ruled directly on the King's behalf. It was a royal appointment, usually to a close relative of the King, although it was a sporadic one, being mostly filled during periods of war or civil disturbance.{{sfn|Gribit|2016|p=13}} It was not a particularly profitable office, notes the economist [[Michael Postan]], and indeed was \"as likely to be a source of loss as gain\" for the appointee, and the King was regularly forced to provide financial inducements to those he wished to take up the post.{{sfn|Postan|1973|p=74}}|group=note}} and received the constableship of [[Exeter Castle]].{{Sfn|Storey|1999|p=165}} He also received grants of lands and estates in [[South Teign River|South Teign]], the [[Lydford Castle|castle]], borough and [[manor]] of Lydford, the [[conservancy]] of the [[River Exe]], and [[forestry rights]] in [[Dartmoor]],{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}} making him, wrote the historian [[Bertram Wolffe]], \"exalted in the west country\".{{Sfn|Wolffe|1981|p=262}} Bonville never took up his seneschalcy as what remained of England's territorial possessions in France were lost at the [[Battle of Castillon]] in July 1453.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} King Henry\u2014now in Exeter\u2014appointed Bonville to a large commission of [[oyer and terminer]] to investigate sympathy for York's rebellion in the area, and the King made him a gift of \u00a350.{{Sfn|Wolffe|1981|pp=259\u2013260}}\n\n=== Henry's illness and Yorkist government ===\n[[File:MapBattleOfClystHeath1455.PNG|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=map showing location of the Clyst battlefield in Devon|Map of the location of the Clyst engagement, 1455]]In August 1453, King Henry suffered a period of illness and mental collapse during which he was unable to respond to people or stimulus. He was, therefore, unable to carry out his royal duties. The Lancastrian regime, already weakened by factionalism, was paralysed,{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=715}} and the national political scene became increasingly tense. Bonville attended a council at Westminster in early 1454. This, a [[Paston Letters|Paston]] correspondent reported, was only after he had \"maken all the puissance they can and may to come hider [to Westminster] with theym\".{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=723}} It was rumoured that Bonville was planning to join up with other lords\u2014those of Beaumont, Poynings, Clifford and Egremont\u2014and march on London itself, although in the event this did not occur.{{Sfn|Jacob|1993|p=508}}{{Refn|In other words, it was rumoured that Bonville ordered the gathering of the largest force of men (a ''puissaunce''{{sfn|MED|2014a}}) that he could, and that having done so, he brought them (''hider''{{sfn|MED|2014b}}) to Westminster with him; from a letter of 19 January 1454 from John Studley to John Paston.{{sfn|Gairdner|1986|p=299}}|group=note}} Everyone, including Bonville, was preparing for war on a national scale.{{Sfn|Tuck|1999|p=271}}\n\nThe [[House of Lords]] eventually appointed the Duke of York as [[Lord Protector|protector]] of the realm during the King's incapacitation, and York appointed Salisbury [[Lord Chancellor|chancellor]]. Although Courtenay was nominally York's ally, the Earl did not see any major benefits from this relationship. (York's other allies, argues John Watts, the Nevilles, received York's assistance in their on-going feud with the Percies in Yorkshire.) Bonville experienced no lessening of his position during the protectorate;{{Sfn|Watts|1996|pp=324 + n.274, 338 n.328}} indeed, he had committed flagrant acts of piracy against foreign shipping off the southwest coast, which went unpunished. The most prominent victims of Bonville's actions were the Duke of Burgundy's merchants; Burgundy was England's ally on the continent, a position which Bonville's ships endangered.{{Sfn|Johnson|1988|p=151}}\n\n=== Battle of St Albans and Bonville's ascendancy ===\nIn early 1455 King Henry made a sudden recovery. York and Salisbury were removed from their positions in government and retired to their estates. National politics, already heavily partisan, was tense. The King summoned a great council to be held in Leicester in May. Several chroniclers of the day suggest that Somerset was poisoning the King's mind against York.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=740}} He and the Nevilles may have feared imminent arrest. In any case, they reacted swiftly and with violence. They ambushed the King's small army at the [[First Battle of St Albans]] on the 22nd in a [[pre-emptive strike]]. Courtenay fought for the King and was wounded.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=155}} Bonville may also have been sympathetic to the royal cause, as one of his [[pursuivant]]s was used as a messenger by the King's councillors. He did not join the royal army, however.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Michael Hicks has suggested that both Bonville and Courtenay were more interested in prosecuting their own feud than the national one.{{Sfn|Hicks|1998|p=94}} King Henry had been captured by the Yorkists after the battle: once again they controlled the government.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Although clearly unwilling to turn against his King at this point,{{Sfn|Grummitt|2013|p=59}} Bonville did attend the Yorkist parliament of September 1455, where he voted in favour of the Duke of York's appointment as protector.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1984|p=78}} Bonville was appointed to the parliamentary committee set up to improve naval defence.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} He also used his local influence to ensure that the vacant [[Bishop of Exeter|Bishopric of Exeter]] was reserved for the Earl of Salisbury's youngest son, [[George Neville (Archbishop)|George Neville]],{{Sfn|Pollard|2000|p=149}} and in November Bonville received a general [[Royal pardon|pardon]].{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=770 n.202}}\n\nIn the southwest, Bonville and his ally, [[James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond|James Butler, Earl of Wiltshire]] (also at this time very close to the court) were recruiting heavily.{{Sfn|Grummitt|2013|p=36}} They caused a proclamation \"to be cryed at Taunton in Somersetshire that every man that is likely and wole go with theym and serve theym shalle have ''vjd.''

The plan failed, but Bonville was prevented from carrying out his duty as a collector of a royal loan.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Although in the following June both Bonville and Courtenay were instructed by the King to keep the peace\u2014and each bound over for \u00a34,000 to do so\u2014they appear to have continued their war of attrition. Such was the \"anarchic state of affairs\"{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} in Devon following St Albans that the [[Michaelmas term]] judicial sessions that were due to be held in Exeter had to be cancelled. Courtenay went on to terrorise the county with his army and ransacked Bonville's houses.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} This culminated on 23 October 1455 with what has been described as the \"most notorious private crime of the century\",{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=167}} when Courtenay's son\u2014also [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th/14th Earl of Devon|Thomas]]\u2014and a small force of men attacked and brutally murdered one of Bonville's close councillors, the prominent local lawyer [[Nicholas Radford]].{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=168}} Carpenter comments: \"there were other enormities, principally directed against Lord Bonville.

Bonville's father died before Bonville reached adulthood. As a result, he grew up in the household of his grandfather and namesake, who was a prominent member of the Devon gentry. Both Bonville's father and grandfather had been successful in politics and land acquisition, and when Bonville came of age, he gained control of a large estate. He augmented this further by a series of lawsuits against his stepfather, [[Richard Stucley]]. Bonville undertook royal service, which then meant fighting in France in the later years of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. In 1415, he joined the [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u20131453)|English invasion of France]] in the retinue of [[Thomas, Duke of Clarence]], [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]'s brother, and fought in the [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt campaign]]. Throughout his life, Bonville was despatched on further operations in France, but increasingly events in the southwest of England took up more of his time and energy, as he became [[Bonville\u2013Courtenay feud|involved in a feud]] with his powerful neighbour [[Thomas de Courtenay, 5th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon]].\n\nIn 1437, King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] granted Bonville the profitable office of steward of the [[Duchy of Cornwall]]. This had traditionally been a hereditary office of the earls of Devon, and the Earl was enraged at its loss. The dispute soon descended into violence, and Bonville and Courtenay ravaged each other's properties. The situation was exacerbated in 1442 when the Crown appointed Courtenay to effectively the same stewardship it had appointed Bonville, which inflamed the situation even more. The feud between them continued intermittently for the next decade. Generally, Henry and his government failed to intervene between the two parties; when it did, its efforts were ineffectual. On one occasion Bonville was persuaded to undertake further service in France\u2014primarily to get Bonville out of the region\u2014but the mission was poorly funded, a military failure, and when Bonville returned the feud reignited. In 1453, King Henry became ill and entered a [[catatonic state]] for eighteen months, heightening the political factionalism that had riven the reign.\n\nBonville generally seems to have remained loyal to the king, although his guiding motivation was to support whoever would aid him in his struggle against Courtenay. Their feud was part of a broader breakdown in law and order which eventually evolved into the [[Wars of the Roses]] in 1455. Bonville seems to have managed to avoid implication in the variable swings in political fortune which followed until 1460. At this point, he threw in his lot with the rebellious [[Richard, Duke of York]]. His new allegiance brought him little profit; his son was killed alongside York at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] in December 1460, while Bonville himself took part in the [[Second Battle of St Albans]] two months later on the losing side; with [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th Earl of Devon|the new Earl of Devon]] watching, he was [[Decapitation|beheaded]] on 18 February 1461.\n\n== Background and early life ==\nThe Bonvilles were one of the major [[gentry]] families of late-fourteenth-century Devon, often working in close co-operation with their neighbours. The most important of these were the [[House of Courtenay|Courtenay]] [[Earl of Devon|earls of Devon]]. Bonville's grandfather had been a [[Retainer (medieval)|retainer]] of the 11th Earl, [[Edward de Courtenay, 3rd/11th Earl of Devon|Edward]]. The historian [[Christine Carpenter (historian)|Christine Carpenter]] comments, on the family's social position, that they were of sufficiently \"landed and official status to be regarded as what might be termed 'super-knights'{{tsp}}\";{{Sfn|Carpenter|2012|p=76}} she echoed the medievalist [[K. B. McFarlane]], who had previously described the family as \"a powerful and respected element in Devon...there was no need for them to stand in dread of the great, for they were not small themselves\".{{Sfn|McFarlane|1981|p=16}}\n[[File:OldShuteHouseGreatHallFromWest.jpg|upright=1.2|alt=Late fourteenth-century section of Bonville's birthplace.|left|thumb|Very little of the original medieval manor house remains of Bonville's birthplace; the section shown here is from the late fourteenth century.]]\nWilliam Bonville was born on either 12 or 31 August 1392{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} or 1393 in [[Shute, Devon]], to John Bonville (d. 1396) and Elizabeth Fitzroger (c. 1370\u2013c. 1414).{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} William Bonville's grandfather was his namesake Sir William Bonville, who had been [[member of Parliament]] for [[Somerset]] and Devon on multiple occasions{{Sfn|Roskell|Clark|Rawcliffe|1993a}} and has been described by a historian as one of \"the most prominent west-country gentry in the late fourteenth century\".{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} On hearing of the birth of his grandson, a contemporary reports, Sir William \"raised his hands to heaven and praised God\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Along with the [[Newenham Abbey|Abbot of Newenham]], he stood [[godparent]] to the young William.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} The younger William was heir to both his father and grandfather; the latter\u2014who had married twice\u2014had substantially expanded the family [[Inheritance|patrimony]].{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} He has been described by the scholar [[Ralph A. Griffiths|Ralph Griffiths]] as a \"capable, energetic and well-connected man\".{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=574}}\n\nBonville's father died when his son was four,{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} and young William probably grew up in his grandfather's household.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Grandfather Bonville died in 1408,{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} while Bonville was still legally a [[Minor (law)|minor]].{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} As was customary, [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]] took both Bonville's [[Ward (law)|wardship]] and marriage into his own hands. This was valuable [[Royal Patronage|royal patronage]],{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}} which the King granted firstly to Sir [[John Tiptoft, 1st Baron Tiptoft|John Tiptoft]],{{Sfn|Roskell|1983|p=111}} and then to [[Edward, Duke of York]].{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} Bonville had a younger brother, Thomas, who, by the time William came of age, had already married a cousin of Robert, Baron Poynings. This connection to the Poynings family, the historian [[J. S. Roskell]] has suggested, was instrumental in Bonville's own marriage.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}}\n\n=== Marriages and children ===\nBonville married twice. In 1414 he married Margaret Grey, daughter of [[Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn|Reginald, Baron Grey of Ruthin]].{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=574}} Lord Grey promised to pay 200 marks{{Refn|A medieval English mark was an [[Unit of account|accounting unit]] equivalent to two-thirds of a pound.{{sfn|Harding|2002|p=xiv}}|group=note}} to Bonville on the wedding day, and Bonville likewise contracted to settle estates to the value of \u00a3100 on himself and his wife, [[Jointure|jointly]]. Grey also paid another 200 marks in instalments over the following four years.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Sometime between April 1426 and October 1427{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}}\u2014when Bonville received a [[papal dispensation]] to marry again\u2014Margaret Grey died. Bonville made his next marriage to Elizabeth Courtenay, widow of [[John Harington, 4th Baron Harington|John, Baron Harington]].

It was a royal appointment, usually to a close relative of the King, although it was a sporadic one, being mostly filled during periods of war or civil disturbance.{{sfn|Gribit|2016|p=13}} It was not a particularly profitable office, notes the economist [[Michael Postan]], and indeed was \"as likely to be a source of loss as gain\" for the appointee, and the King was regularly forced to provide financial inducements to those he wished to take up the post.{{sfn|Postan|1973|p=74}}|group=note}} and received the constableship of [[Exeter Castle]].{{Sfn|Storey|1999|p=165}} He also received grants of lands and estates in [[South Teign River|South Teign]], the [[Lydford Castle|castle]], borough and [[manor]] of Lydford, the [[conservancy]] of the [[River Exe]], and [[forestry rights]] in [[Dartmoor]],{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}} making him, wrote the historian [[Bertram Wolffe]], \"exalted in the west country\".{{Sfn|Wolffe|1981|p=262}} Bonville never took up his seneschalcy as what remained of England's territorial possessions in France were lost at the [[Battle of Castillon]] in July 1453.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} King Henry\u2014now in Exeter\u2014appointed Bonville to a large commission of [[oyer and terminer]] to investigate sympathy for York's rebellion in the area, and the King made him a gift of \u00a350.{{Sfn|Wolffe|1981|pp=259\u2013260}}\n\n=== Henry's illness and Yorkist government ===\n[[File:MapBattleOfClystHeath1455.PNG|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=map showing location of the Clyst battlefield in Devon|Map of the location of the Clyst engagement, 1455]]In August 1453, King Henry suffered a period of illness and mental collapse during which he was unable to respond to people or stimulus. He was, therefore, unable to carry out his royal duties. The Lancastrian regime, already weakened by factionalism, was paralysed,{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=715}} and the national political scene became increasingly tense. Bonville attended a council at Westminster in early 1454. This, a [[Paston Letters|Paston]] correspondent reported, was only after he had \"maken all the puissance they can and may to come hider [to Westminster] with theym\".{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=723}} It was rumoured that Bonville was planning to join up with other lords\u2014those of Beaumont, Poynings, Clifford and Egremont\u2014and march on London itself, although in the event this did not occur.{{Sfn|Jacob|1993|p=508}}{{Refn|In other words, it was rumoured that Bonville ordered the gathering of the largest force of men (a ''puissaunce''{{sfn|MED|2014a}}) that he could, and that having done so, he brought them (''hider''{{sfn|MED|2014b}}) to Westminster with him; from a letter of 19 January 1454 from John Studley to John Paston.{{sfn|Gairdner|1986|p=299}}|group=note}} Everyone, including Bonville, was preparing for war on a national scale.{{Sfn|Tuck|1999|p=271}}\n\nThe [[House of Lords]] eventually appointed the Duke of York as [[Lord Protector|protector]] of the realm during the King's incapacitation, and York appointed Salisbury [[Lord Chancellor|chancellor]]. Although Courtenay was nominally York's ally, the Earl did not see any major benefits from this relationship. (York's other allies, argues John Watts, the Nevilles, received York's assistance in their on-going feud with the Percies in Yorkshire.) Bonville experienced no lessening of his position during the protectorate;{{Sfn|Watts|1996|pp=324 + n.274, 338 n.328}} indeed, he had committed flagrant acts of piracy against foreign shipping off the southwest coast, which went unpunished. The most prominent victims of Bonville's actions were the Duke of Burgundy's merchants; Burgundy was England's ally on the continent, a position which Bonville's ships endangered.{{Sfn|Johnson|1988|p=151}}\n\n=== Battle of St Albans and Bonville's ascendancy ===\nIn early 1455 King Henry made a sudden recovery. York and Salisbury were removed from their positions in government and retired to their estates. National politics, already heavily partisan, was tense. The King summoned a great council to be held in Leicester in May. Several chroniclers of the day suggest that Somerset was poisoning the King's mind against York.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=740}} He and the Nevilles may have feared imminent arrest. In any case, they reacted swiftly and with violence. They ambushed the King's small army at the [[First Battle of St Albans]] on the 22nd in a [[pre-emptive strike]]. Courtenay fought for the King and was wounded.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=155}} Bonville may also have been sympathetic to the royal cause, as one of his [[pursuivant]]s was used as a messenger by the King's councillors. He did not join the royal army, however.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Michael Hicks has suggested that both Bonville and Courtenay were more interested in prosecuting their own feud than the national one.{{Sfn|Hicks|1998|p=94}} King Henry had been captured by the Yorkists after the battle: once again they controlled the government.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Although clearly unwilling to turn against his King at this point,{{Sfn|Grummitt|2013|p=59}} Bonville did attend the Yorkist parliament of September 1455, where he voted in favour of the Duke of York's appointment as protector.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1984|p=78}} Bonville was appointed to the parliamentary committee set up to improve naval defence.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} He also used his local influence to ensure that the vacant [[Bishop of Exeter|Bishopric of Exeter]] was reserved for the Earl of Salisbury's youngest son, [[George Neville (Archbishop)|George Neville]],{{Sfn|Pollard|2000|p=149}} and in November Bonville received a general [[Royal pardon|pardon]].{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=770 n.202}}\n\nIn the southwest, Bonville and his ally, [[James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond|James Butler, Earl of Wiltshire]] (also at this time very close to the court) were recruiting heavily.{{Sfn|Grummitt|2013|p=36}} They caused a proclamation \"to be cryed at Taunton in Somersetshire that every man that is likely and wole go with theym and serve theym shalle have ''vjd.'' [sixpence] every day as long as he abideth with theym\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Bonville's dominance in the southwest forced the Earl of Devon to respond drastically,{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=166}} and at the end of April 1454 Devon brought an armed force of hundreds of men into Exeter in a planned [[ambush]]. The plan failed, but Bonville was prevented from carrying out his duty as a collector of a royal loan.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Although in the following June both Bonville and Courtenay were instructed by the King to keep the peace\u2014and each bound over for \u00a34,000 to do so\u2014they appear to have continued their war of attrition. Such was the \"anarchic state of affairs\"{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} in Devon following St Albans that the [[Michaelmas term]] judicial sessions that were due to be held in Exeter had to be cancelled. Courtenay went on to terrorise the county with his army and ransacked Bonville's houses.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} This culminated on 23 October 1455 with what has been described as the \"most notorious private crime of the century\",{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=167}} when Courtenay's son\u2014also [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th/14th Earl of Devon|Thomas]]\u2014and a small force of men attacked and brutally murdered one of Bonville's close councillors, the prominent local lawyer [[Nicholas Radford]].{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=168}} Carpenter comments: \"there were other enormities, principally directed against Lord Bonville.

The college was founded in 1835 and its undergraduate population was approximately 1,500 students in 2014.\n\nThey participate in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] Division III and the [[Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association]] (MIAA). The college's athletic teams are nicknamed the Britons, and their colors are purple and gold.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Albion College.jpg|thumb|right|19th-century drawing of Albion College]]\nThe origin of Albion College lies not in the city of Albion, but about {{convert|10|mi|km}} southeast of the present location of the college. On March 23, 1835, [[Methodist Episcopal Church|Methodist]] settlers in [[Spring Arbor Township, Michigan|Spring Arbor Township]] obtained a charter for the Spring Arbor Seminary from the [[Michigan Territory|Michigan Territorial]] Legislature. Foundations for a building were begun in 1837 at a location about {{convert|3|mi|km}} southwest of the current village of [[Spring Arbor, Michigan|Spring Arbor]] but were soon abandoned due to the economic turmoil caused by the [[Panic of 1837]]. No classes were ever held at the Spring Arbor location. The trustees applied to move the seminary to Albion in 1838, and the legislature approved the move in 1839.\n\nWith 60 acres (243,000&nbsp;m\u00b2) of land donated by Albion pioneer [[Jesse Crowell]], the cornerstone was laid for the first building in 1841. The seminary, now named the '''Wesleyan Seminary''', first held classes in 1843, in the local Methodist Church. In 1844, classes began in the newly constructed Central Building, which was rebuilt as the present Robinson Hall in 1907.\n\nThe '''Albion Female Collegiate Institute''' was founded in 1850 by the Wesleyan Seminary Corporation. The two schools merged in 1857 under the name '''The Wesleyan Seminary and Female College at Albion'''.\n\nOn February 25, 1861, both schools were completely merged under the name '''Albion College''' when the school was fully authorized by the State legislature to confer a full four-year college degree upon both men and women.\n\n==Academics==\n[[Image:gcline seminar.jpg|thumb|left|Dr. Gene Cline, Emeritus Professor of Philosophy, directs a seminar-style honors class]]\nThe Albion College student body is composed of approximately 1,500 students. The student\u2013to\u2013faculty ratio is 11:1. The average class size of under 19 is comparable to other small liberal arts colleges. Albion College employs more than 100 full-time faculty, of whom more than 95% have earned the highest degree offered in their field.\n\nAlbion College appears on the ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' list of America's Top Liberal Arts Colleges. Also, Albion is a member of ''The Princeton Review'''s 376 Best Colleges and Best Midwestern Colleges list.

On March 23, 1835, [[Methodist Episcopal Church|Methodist]] settlers in [[Spring Arbor Township, Michigan|Spring Arbor Township]] obtained a charter for the Spring Arbor Seminary from the [[Michigan Territory|Michigan Territorial]] Legislature. Foundations for a building were begun in 1837 at a location about {{convert|3|mi|km}} southwest of the current village of [[Spring Arbor, Michigan|Spring Arbor]] but were soon abandoned due to the economic turmoil caused by the [[Panic of 1837]]. No classes were ever held at the Spring Arbor location. The trustees applied to move the seminary to Albion in 1838, and the legislature approved the move in 1839.\n\nWith 60 acres (243,000&nbsp;m\u00b2) of land donated by Albion pioneer [[Jesse Crowell]], the cornerstone was laid for the first building in 1841. The seminary, now named the '''Wesleyan Seminary''', first held classes in 1843, in the local Methodist Church.

During the 2005 season, both the men's and women's basketball teams advanced to the Division III playoffs.\n\n===Men's sports===\n*Baseball\n*Basketball\n*Cross Country\n*Equestrian Hunt Seat\n*Equestrian Western\n*Football\n**1994 NCAA Division III National Champions <ref>{{cite web |title=Football Championship History |url=https://www.ncaa.com/history/football/d3 |website=NCAA Football Championship History |publisher=NCAA |accessdate=15 February 2019 |date=2019}}</ref>\n*Golf\n*Lacrosse\n*Soccer\n*Swimming and Diving\n*Tennis\n*Track and Field\nRugby\n\n===Women's sports===\n*Basketball\n*Cross Country\n*Equestrian Hunt Seat\n*Equestrian Western \n*Golf\n*Lacrosse\n*Soccer\n*Softball\n*Swimming and Diving\n*Tennis\n*Track and Field\n*Volleyball\n\n==Greek life==\n\n===Fraternities===\nAlbion College is home to six social  [[Fraternity|fraternities]]:<ref>{{cite web|title=Greek Life - Albion College|url=http://albion.edu/student-life/campus-programs-and-organizations/greek-life|work=albion.edu|accessdate=November 3, 2013}}</ref>\n*[[Tau Kappa Epsilon]]\n*[[Delta Sigma Phi]]\n*[[Delta Tau Delta]]\n*[[Sigma Nu]]\n*[[Sigma Chi]]\n*[[Alpha Tau Omega]]\n\nAll six fraternities on campus are all members of the [[North American Interfraternity Conference]] and all comprise Albion College's InterFraternity Council (IFC). IFC governs and coordinates the activities of the fraternal chapters on campus. Approximately 46.6% of the male population on campus belongs to one of the six fraternities. Each of the fraternities leases a fraternity house from the college where the members of the fraternity are required to live. The song \"[[Sweetheart of Sigma Chi]]\" was written in 1911 by Byron D. Stokes (Albion, 1913) and F. Dudleigh Vernor (Albion, 1914), and first performed by Harry Clifford (Albion, 1911) while undergraduates at Albion College.\n\n===Sororities===\nThere are six general purpose social [[Fraternities and sororities|sororities]]. Of those six, five are members of the [[National Panhellenic Conference]]:\n*[[Kappa Delta]]\n*[[Alpha Chi Omega]]\n*[[Alpha Xi Delta]]\n*[[Delta Gamma]]\n*[[Kappa Alpha Theta]]\n\nOne of the six is a member of the [[National Pan-Hellenic Council]]:\n*[[Alpha Kappa Alpha]]\n\nThe members of the six social sororities at Albion College do not live in their lodges, but rather hold meetings and other events there. All six of the sorority chapters are members of the Albion College Panhellenic Council, which governs and coordinates the activities of sorority chapters on campus. Approximately 42% of the female population on campus belongs to one of the six sororities.\n\n===Professional and honorary fraternities===\nAlbion College is also home to nearly a dozen honorary, professional, service, and special interest fraternities, including:\n*[[Alpha Lambda Delta]]\n*[[Alpha Phi Omega]]\n*[[Beta Beta Beta]]\n*[[Delta Sigma Pi]]\n*[[Sigma Xi]]\n*[[Theta Phi Alpha]]\n*[[Kappa Kappa Psi]]\n*[[Omicron Delta Kappa]]\n*[[Order of Omega|The Order of Omega]]\n*[[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]]\n*[[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia]]\n*[[Pi Sigma Alpha]]\n*[[Psi Chi]]\n*[[Sigma Alpha Iota]]\n*[[Sigma Gamma Epsilon]]\n\n==Notable alumni and faculty==\n{{Main|List of Albion College people}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Albion College}}\n* [http://www.albion.edu/ Official website]\n* [http://gobrits.com/landing/index Official athletics website]\n* {{Cite Collier's|short=x|wstitle=Albion College}}\n\n{{Colleges and universities in Michigan}}\n{{Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association navbox}}\n{{GLCA}}\n{{MethodistColleges}}\n{{Annapolis Group}}\n{{Oberlin Group}}\n{{CLAC}}\n{{Global Liberal Arts Alliance}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Albion College| ]]\n[[Category:Education in Calhoun County, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Liberal arts colleges in Michigan]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1835]]\n[[Category:Members of the Annapolis Group]]\n[[Category:Members of the Oberlin Group]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Calhoun County, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Calhoun County, Michigan]]\n[[Category:1835 establishments in Michigan Territory]]\n[[Category:Universities and colleges affiliated with the Methodist Episcopal Church]]\n", "name_user": "113.199.173.237", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eNotable alumni and faculty)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albion_College"}

During each conference, members of the church gather in a series of two-hour sessions to listen to [[sermon]]s from church leaders. It consists of four general sessions. Since April 2018 the priesthood session is only held during the April conference, and a General Women's Session (for females 8 years and older) held during October's conference.\n\nWhile originating from Salt Lake City, General Conference is considered an international event for the church. The sessions are broadcast worldwide in over 90 languages, primarily through local and international media outlets, and over the [[Internet]].\n\n==History and structure==\n[[File:LDS Conference Center-up.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The LDS Church's [[Conference Center (LDS Church)|Conference Center]] in [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, Utah]].]]\n\nIn the LDS Church, [[General conference (Latter Day Saints)|general conference]] is a series of semiannual meetings where [[general authority|general authorities]] and other church leaders preach sermons and give guidance to church members. Changes to church leadership are also proposed and sustained through the principle of [[Common consent (Latter Day Saints)|common consent]]. General conferences are held on the weekends of the first Sundays in April and October. The April conference is known as the ''Annual General Conference'', with the October conference referred to as the ''Semiannual General Conference''. The April conference includes annual statistical and financial audit reports not included in the October meeting. Both conferences are identified by the number of years since the church was founded in April 1830; thus, the April 2016 meeting was the 186th Annual General Conference, and the October 2016 meeting was the 186th Semiannual General Conference.\n\nSince October 1848,<ref>After the [[death of Joseph Smith]], general conferences were held under the direction of [[Brigham Young]] in October 1844 ([[Nauvoo, Illinois]]); April 1845 (Nauvoo); October 1845 (Nauvoo); December 1847 ([[Kanesville, Iowa]]); and April 1848 (Kanesville). For the dates and locations of conferences prior to Smith's death, see [[General conference (Latter Day Saints)]].</ref> all of the conferences have been held in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], with the exception of the April 1877 conference, which was held in [[St. George, Utah]]. Conferences were held in a bowery in Salt Lake City from 1848 to 1852, in the [[Old Salt Lake Tabernacle]] from 1852 to 1867, in the [[Salt Lake Tabernacle]] from October 1867 to April 2000, and in the [[Conference Center (LDS Church)|Conference Center]] since that time. Historically, General Conference was held over three days, with the annual conference always including April 6, the anniversary of the church's organization. This made conference participation difficult for those with work and school commitments when April 6 fell on a weekday. In April 1977, during [[Spencer W. Kimball]]'s presidency, changes were made to reduce the conference to the first Saturday and Sunday of April and October.<ref>{{Citation |title= Report of the 147th Annual Conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |url= https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1977/05/report-of-the-147th-annual-conference-of-the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |pages= 1 |date= May 1977 }}</ref>\n\nAs of October 2018, the conference consists of four general sessions and a priesthood session (held in April) and a women's session (held in October) that occurs on Saturday evening.<ref name=Stack1>{{cite news |last1= Stack |title= About-face: Mormon women's meeting now part of General Conference |url= http://www.sltrib.com/lifestyle/faith/1765034-155/general-conference-session-women-meeting-church |accessdate= 31 October 2014 |newspaper= [[The Salt Lake Tribune]] |date= 30 October 2014 }}</ref><ref name = Walch1>{{cite news |last1= Walch |first1= Tad |title= LDS Church confirms women's meeting now part of general conference |url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865614355/LDS-Church-confirms-womens-meeting-now-part-of-general-conference.html |accessdate= 31 October 2014 |newspaper= [[Deseret News]] |date= 30 October 2014 }}</ref> The general sessions commence at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. (Mountain Time) on Saturday and Sunday, with the priesthood or women's sessions beginning at 6 p.m. on Saturday evening.

The music for each session had been prerecorded, and attendance at each session would be restricted to the First Presidency and those speaking or praying during that session.<ref>[https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/adjustments-format-april-2020-general-conference Additional Adjustments to the April 2020 General Conference], ''Newsroom'', churchofjesuschrist.org, 19 March 2020. Retrieved 31 March 2020.</ref>\n\n==Organization==\n[[File:SLCConferenceCrowd.jpg|thumb|250px|Crowd on [[Temple Square]] in between sessions of conference.]]\nA member of the church's [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] normally conducts each Conference session, with the [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President of the Church]] presiding. (On occasions in the past, when part or all of the First Presidency have been absent, the First Presidency designates someone to conduct the conference, typically the most senior apostle not in the First Presidency.) The conducting official introduces the various speakers, which over the course of the sessions will generally include all members of the First Presidency and [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] and a selection of other leaders in the church. Almost every [[general authority]] of the church is present, though outside the First Presidency and Twelve only a few speak. Non-general authority speakers may include male and female officers of [[Auxiliary organization (LDS Church)|auxiliary organizations]]. Most [[Area seventy|area seventies]] travel to Utah to attend at least one general conference per year.\n\nDuring one general session (usually Saturday afternoon), all the general authorities and general officers of the church are presented for the formal [[Common consent (Latter Day Saints)|sustaining vote]] by the membership, and it is usually at this time that any changes among the general church leadership are announced. Normally, the members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve are mentioned by name; those in other positions are mentioned by name only if they are released from a previous position or called to a new one. The person conducting asks all of those who are in favor of sustaining the current leadership or the calling of a new leader to raise their hand in a \"vote.\" He then asks that any who are opposed raise their hand. Dissenting votes are rare and the customary declaration at the end of the voting is that the voting has been unanimous.\n\nAt the first General Conference after the death of a church president and the calling of his successor, the session at which the sustaining vote takes place is called a [[Solemn assembly (Latter Day Saints)|solemn assembly]]. At a solemn assembly, groups of Latter-day Saints are asked to stand in succession and sustain the new president of the church. Typically, the order is: First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, the Quorums of Seventy, [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek priesthood]] holders, [[Aaronic priesthood (LDS Church)|Aaronic priesthood]] holders, [[Relief Society]] members, members of the [[Young Women organization]], and then all members together.<ref>{{citation |url= https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1995/05/the-solemn-assembly-sustaining-of-church-officers |title= The Solemn Assembly Sustaining of Church Officers |first= Thomas S. |last= Monson |date= May 1995 |journal = Ensign |publisher=LDS Church }}</ref> Then the names of all other general authorities are read, and a sustaining and opposing vote is called for.\n\nFrequently, significant announcements are made at a General Conference, which may include building sites for new [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]] or the institution of new policies or programs.\n\n==Music==\nMusic is an important part of the Conference in setting the appropriate spiritual mood. The [[The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square|Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square]], formerly known as the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, accompanied by tabernacle organists,<ref>{{citation |url= https://www.thechurchnews.com/archive/2007-04-14/new-tabernacle-organist-named-30271 |title= New Tabernacle organist named |newspaper= [[LDS Church News]] |publisher= Deseret News |date= April 14, 2007 }}</ref> generally provides the majority of the music, with the exception of the Saturday afternoon, priesthood sessions, and general women's sessions. At the Saturday afternoon session and the priesthood session guest ensembles include regional choirs, institute choirs, an [[Missionary Training Center|MTC]] choir, and the [[BYU Choirs]]. The hymns are usually selected from the normal repertoire of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints hymns|LDS hymns]] and their various arrangements, with an occasional piece from traditional sacred choral repertoire. Usually, the congregation is invited to stand and join in with one hymn halfway through each session.\n\nVery rarely, soloist artists will perform for Conferences, The last performer to do so, [[Liriel Domiciano]], did so alongside the Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square.<ref>{{citation |url= https://www.thechurchnews.com/archive/2004-03-27/longtime-dream-to-sing-with-choir-25115 |title= Longtime dream to sing with choir |newspaper= [[LDS Church News]] |publisher= Deseret News |date= March 27, 2004 }}</ref>\n\n==Sermons==\nMembers of the church regard and sustain the president of the church, the counselors in the First Presidency, and members of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles as \"[[prophets, seers, and revelators]]\", and are counseled to pay close attention to what they teach throughout the year. However, the sermons given at general conference are held in particularly high esteem and they are considered the will of God to the church members at the current time.<ref>{{citation |first=Ezra Taft |last=Benson |authorlink=Ezra Taft Benson |url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1988/05/come-unto-christ-and-be-perfected-in-him |title=Come unto Christ, and Be Perfected in Him |journal=[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date=May 1988 |page=84 |df= }}</ref>  The sermons (called \"talks\") are published in the ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', an official church English-language magazine, the month following a General Conference. They are also translated and printed in the ''[[Liahona (magazine)|Liahona]]'', the church's international version of the ''Ensign'', which is published in multiple languages. Church members are encouraged to read and study the talks, discuss them at home and at church, and quote from them while giving lessons and sermons at church.\n\nA sample of the topics of general conference discourses includes:\n*Our Good Shepherd ([https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd?lang=eng Renlund, April 2017])\n*Unity ([https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2008/10/our-hearts-knit-as-one?lang=eng Eyring, October 2008])\n*Forgiveness ([https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2007/04/the-healing-power-of-forgiveness?lang=eng Faust, April 2007]; [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2005/10/forgiveness?lang=eng Hinckley, October 2005])\n*Natural disasters and preparedness ([https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2005/10/if-ye-are-prepared-ye-shall-not-fear?lang=eng Hinckley, October 2005])\n*Faith ([https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2005/04/faith-is-the-answer?lang=eng Sorensen, April 2005])\n*The dangers of pornography ([https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2005/04/pornography?lang=eng Oaks, April 2005]; [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2004/10/a-tragic-evil-among-us?lang=eng Hinckley, October 2004])\n*The first vision of Joseph Smith ([https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2005/04/the-fruits-of-the-first-vision?lang=eng Uchtdorf, April 2005])\n*Acquiring a testimony of Jesus ([https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2004/04/jesus-the-very-thought-of-thee?lang=eng McMullin, April 2004])\n*Fatherhood ([https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2004/04/fatherhood-an-eternal-calling?lang=eng Perry, April 2004])\n*The Atonement of Jesus ([https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2004/04/the-atonement-all-for-all?lang=eng Hafen, April 2004])\n*Fasting ([https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2004/10/the-blessings-of-a-proper-fast?lang=eng Pratt, October 2004])\n*Repentance ([https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2007/04/repentance-and-conversion?lang=eng Nelson, April 2007]; [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2007/04/point-of-safe-return?lang=eng Uchtdorf, April 2007]; [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2003/10/repentance-and-change?lang=eng Oaks, October 2003])\n*Eternal life through Jesus ([https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2002/04/eternal-life-through-jesus-christ?lang=eng Madsen, April 2002])\n*Tithing ([https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2002/04/the-law-of-tithing?lang=eng Tingey, April 2002])\n*Hope in the Atonement of Jesus ([https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2001/10/the-atonement-our-greatest-hope?lang=eng Faust, October 2001])\n*The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ ([https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2001/10/the-book-of-mormon-another-testament-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng Packer, October 2001])\n\n==Broadcasting==\nThe events of the conferences are televised both locally and internationally through various platforms to increase their exposure and availability.

During each conference, members of the church gather in a series of two-hour sessions to listen to [[sermon]]s from church leaders. It consists of four general sessions. Since April 2018 the priesthood session is only held during the April conference, and a General Women's Session (for females 8 years and older) held during October's conference.\n\nWhile originating from Salt Lake City, General Conference is considered an international event for the church. The sessions are broadcast worldwide in over 90 languages, primarily through local and international media outlets, and over the [[Internet]].\n\n==History and structure==\n[[File:LDS Conference Center-up.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The LDS Church's [[Conference Center (LDS Church)|Conference Center]] in [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, Utah]].]]\n\nIn the LDS Church, [[General conference (Latter Day Saints)|general conference]] is a series of semiannual meetings where [[general authority|general authorities]] and other church leaders preach sermons and give guidance to church members. Changes to church leadership are also proposed and sustained through the principle of [[Common consent (Latter Day Saints)|common consent]]. General conferences are held on the weekends of the first Sundays in April and October. The April conference is known as the ''Annual General Conference'', with the October conference referred to as the ''Semiannual General Conference''. The April conference includes annual statistical and financial audit reports not included in the October meeting. Both conferences are identified by the number of years since the church was founded in April 1830; thus, the April 2016 meeting was the 186th Annual General Conference, and the October 2016 meeting was the 186th Semiannual General Conference.\n\nSince October 1848,<ref>After the [[death of Joseph Smith]], general conferences were held under the direction of [[Brigham Young]] in October 1844 ([[Nauvoo, Illinois]]); April 1845 (Nauvoo); October 1845 (Nauvoo); December 1847 ([[Kanesville, Iowa]]); and April 1848 (Kanesville). For the dates and locations of conferences prior to Smith's death, see [[General conference (Latter Day Saints)]].</ref> all of the conferences have been held in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], with the exception of the April 1877 conference, which was held in [[St. George, Utah]]. Conferences were held in a bowery in Salt Lake City from 1848 to 1852, in the [[Old Salt Lake Tabernacle]] from 1852 to 1867, in the [[Salt Lake Tabernacle]] from October 1867 to April 2000, and in the [[Conference Center (LDS Church)|Conference Center]] since that time. Historically, General Conference was held over three days, with the annual conference always including April 6, the anniversary of the church's organization. This made conference participation difficult for those with work and school commitments when April 6 fell on a weekday. In April 1977, during [[Spencer W. Kimball]]'s presidency, changes were made to reduce the conference to the first Saturday and Sunday of April and October.<ref>{{Citation |title= Report of the 147th Annual Conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |url= https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1977/05/report-of-the-147th-annual-conference-of-the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |pages= 1 |date= May 1977 }}</ref>\n\nAs of October 2018, the conference consists of four general sessions and a priesthood session (held in April) and a women's session (held in October) that occurs on Saturday evening.<ref name=Stack1>{{cite news |last1= Stack |title= About-face: Mormon women's meeting now part of General Conference |url= http://www.sltrib.com/lifestyle/faith/1765034-155/general-conference-session-women-meeting-church |accessdate= 31 October 2014 |newspaper= [[The Salt Lake Tribune]] |date= 30 October 2014 }}</ref><ref name = Walch1>{{cite news |last1= Walch |first1= Tad |title= LDS Church confirms women's meeting now part of general conference |url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865614355/LDS-Church-confirms-womens-meeting-now-part-of-general-conference.html |accessdate= 31 October 2014 |newspaper= [[Deseret News]] |date= 30 October 2014 }}</ref> The general sessions commence at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. (Mountain Time) on Saturday and Sunday, with the priesthood or women's sessions beginning at 6 p.m. on Saturday evening.

Each of the general sessions lasts about two hours, with the evening session lasting approximately 90 minutes.  \n\nHistorically, beginning in 1994, a [[Relief Society|women's]] general meeting was held on Saturday a week prior to the general sessions of the October conference, with a general meeting for [[Young Women (organization)|young women]] held at a similar time before the April conference.

The music for each session had been prerecorded, and attendance at each session would be restricted to the First Presidency and those speaking or praying during that session.<ref>[https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/adjustments-format-april-2020-general-conference Additional Adjustments to the April 2020 General Conference], ''Newsroom'', churchofjesuschrist.org, 19 March 2020. Retrieved 31 March 2020.</ref>\n\n==Organization==\n[[File:SLCConferenceCrowd.jpg|thumb|250px|Crowd on [[Temple Square]] in between sessions of conference.]]\nA member of the church's [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] normally conducts each Conference session, with the [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President of the Church]] presiding. (On occasions in the past, when part or all of the First Presidency have been absent, the First Presidency designates someone to conduct the conference, typically the most senior apostle not in the First Presidency.) The conducting official introduces the various speakers, which over the course of the sessions will generally include all members of the First Presidency and [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] and a selection of other leaders in the church. Almost every [[general authority]] of the church is present, though outside the First Presidency and Twelve only a few speak. Non-general authority speakers may include male and female officers of [[Auxiliary organization (LDS Church)|auxiliary organizations]]. Most [[Area seventy|area seventies]] travel to Utah to attend at least one general conference per year.\n\nDuring one general session (usually Saturday afternoon), all the general authorities and general officers of the church are presented for the formal [[Common consent (Latter Day Saints)|sustaining vote]] by the membership, and it is usually at this time that any changes among the general church leadership are announced. Normally, the members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve are mentioned by name; those in other positions are mentioned by name only if they are released from a previous position or called to a new one. The person conducting asks all of those who are in favor of sustaining the current leadership or the calling of a new leader to raise their hand in a \"vote.\" He then asks that any who are opposed raise their hand. Dissenting votes are rare and the customary declaration at the end of the voting is that the voting has been unanimous.\n\nAt the first General Conference after the death of a church president and the calling of his successor, the session at which the sustaining vote takes place is called a [[Solemn assembly (Latter Day Saints)|solemn assembly]]. At a solemn assembly, groups of Latter-day Saints are asked to stand in succession and sustain the new president of the church. Typically, the order is: First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, the Quorums of Seventy, [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek priesthood]] holders, [[Aaronic priesthood (LDS Church)|Aaronic priesthood]] holders, [[Relief Society]] members, members of the [[Young Women organization]], and then all members together.<ref>{{citation |url= https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1995/05/the-solemn-assembly-sustaining-of-church-officers |title= The Solemn Assembly Sustaining of Church Officers |first= Thomas S. |last= Monson |date= May 1995 |journal = Ensign |publisher=LDS Church }}</ref> Then the names of all other general authorities are read, and a sustaining and opposing vote is called for.\n\nFrequently, significant announcements are made at a General Conference, which may include building sites for new [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]] or the institution of new policies or programs.\n\n==Music==\nMusic is an important part of the Conference in setting the appropriate spiritual mood. The [[The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square|Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square]], formerly known as the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, accompanied by tabernacle organists,<ref>{{citation |url= https://www.thechurchnews.com/archive/2007-04-14/new-tabernacle-organist-named-30271 |title= New Tabernacle organist named |newspaper= [[LDS Church News]] |publisher= Deseret News |date= April 14, 2007 }}</ref> generally provides the majority of the music, with the exception of the Saturday afternoon, priesthood sessions, and general women's sessions. At the Saturday afternoon session and the priesthood session guest ensembles include regional choirs, institute choirs, an [[Missionary Training Center|MTC]] choir, and the [[BYU Choirs]]. The hymns are usually selected from the normal repertoire of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints hymns|LDS hymns]] and their various arrangements, with an occasional piece from traditional sacred choral repertoire. Usually, the congregation is invited to stand and join in with one hymn halfway through each session.\n\nVery rarely, soloist artists will perform for Conferences, The last performer to do so, [[Liriel Domiciano]], did so alongside the Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square.<ref>{{citation |url= https://www.thechurchnews.com/archive/2004-03-27/longtime-dream-to-sing-with-choir-25115 |title= Longtime dream to sing with choir |newspaper= [[LDS Church News]] |publisher= Deseret News |date= March 27, 2004 }}</ref>\n\n==Sermons==\nMembers of the church regard and sustain the president of the church, the counselors in the First Presidency, and members of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles as \"[[prophets, seers, and revelators]]\", and are counseled to pay close attention to what they teach throughout the year.

Born in India, she moved to the UK when she was 13. She undertook studies in medicine with the [[College of Preceptors]] and [[Worshipful Society of Apothecaries]] and at the [[University of Durham]] and [[University College London]]; she also attended the lectures of the French psychologist [[Pierre Janet]] at the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]], Paris.\n\nMurray was a member of the [[Women's Freedom League]] and [[Women's Tax Resistance League]], two organisations that took [[direct action]] in their campaign for [[women's suffrage]]. In 1910 she and the journalist [[H. N. Brailsford|Henry Brailsford]] took statements from the suffragettes who had been mistreated during the [[Black Friday (1910)|Black Friday]] demonstrations in November that year. Their published memorandum was presented to the [[Home Office]], along with a formal request for a public inquiry; the [[Home Secretary]], [[Winston Churchill]], refused to set one up.\n\nIn 1913 Murray and her close friend Julia Turner opened the Medico-Psychological Clinic, a pioneering entity that provided [[psychological evaluation]] and treatment, affordable for [[middle-class]] families. Several of the staff who worked and trained at the clinic became leading psychoanalysts. Murray was awarded an [[Doctor of Medicine#UK, Ireland and some Commonwealth countries|MD]] by the University of Durham in 1919. Shortly afterwards she was diagnosed with [[ovarian cancer]]; she died in September 1920, aged 53.\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n==Early life, education and professional training: 1867\u20131910==\n[[File:Lord Riddell; Dame Louisa Aldrich-Blake.

The couple also had two younger daughters while in India, Mary Ethel and Edith May. In about 1880 Frances Murray and her children travelled to Edinburgh, and by 1891 they were living in London. Five years later the family was living in [[Bayswater]], West London, when Hugh, then a retired colonel, died.{{sfn|Valentine|2009|pp=145\u2013146}}\n\nIn 1898 Murray met Julia Turner, who was completing an [[undergraduate degree]] in [[classics]] at [[University College London]]. The two formed a close friendship; Elizabeth Valentine, Murray's biographer, considers the relationship was an \"intimate friendship&nbsp;... that showed many of the signs of a life partnership\".{{sfn|Valentine|2009|p=146}} Turner gave Murray private tuition, and she passed the first stage examinations of the [[College of Preceptors]] in 1899. In February 1900 she began studying at the [[London School of Medicine for Women]] and then enrolled as student at the [[Newcastle University Medical School|College of Medicine, Newcastle]]. In June 1908 she passed her examinations to become a Licentiate in Medicine and Surgery of the [[Worshipful Society of Apothecaries]]. The following year she was granted the degree of [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery]] at the [[University of Durham]]; her study also included the field of [[Clinical psychology|psychological medicine]]. Sometime later Murray also attended the lectures of the French psychologist [[Pierre Janet]] at the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]], Paris.{{sfn|Boll|1962|p=311}}{{sfn|Valentine|2009|pp=146\u2013147}}\n\n==Women's suffrage activism==\n[[File:Black Friday, London, 18 November 1910, suffragette attacked.jpg|thumb|upright=1|A [[suffragette]] on the ground on [[Black Friday (1910)|Black Friday]]; Murray co-wrote a report on the violence the demonstrators received.]]\nMurray was a member of the [[Women's Freedom League]], a militant organisation for [[women's suffrage]], founded in 1907, which eschewed violence in favour of [[Nonviolent resistance|non-violent tactics]]; Turner was also a member, while Turner's two sisters were members of the [[Women's Social and Political Union]].{{sfn|Valentine|2009|pp=148\u2013149}}\n\nOn [[Black Friday (1910)|Black Friday]]\u201418 November 1910\u2014a [[suffragette]] demonstration of 300 women marchers was treated with violence, some of it sexual, by the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan police]] and bystanders. Murray and the journalist [[H. N.

Murray hosted group meetings at her house and, in 1911, had property seized by [[bailiff]]s for non-payment of her taxes. She wrote on her demand \"I, a member of the Tax Resistance League, hereby declare that I have conscientious objections to paying King's taxes so long as women are denied the suffrage. I maintain that taxation without representation is unconstitutional.\"<ref>''The Daily Chronicle''. 26 April 1911, quoted in {{harvnb|Valentine|2009|pp=149\u2013150}}.</ref> Her debts were covered by the sale of a sideboard and chairs, although she refused to allow her property to be purchased back by her friends.{{sfn|\"A Woman Tax Resister's Goods Sold\".

Initially the clinic operated informally, opening only three afternoons a week, offering their services to those who could not afford an alternative; one of the clinic's aims was to provide treatment that could be afforded by [[middle-class]] patients.{{sfn|Raitt|2004|pp=68\u201369}}\n\nThe clinic was pioneering, according to [[British Psychoanalytical Society|The Institute of Psychoanalysis]].{{sfn|\"100 Years of History\".

Born in India, she moved to the UK when she was 13. She undertook studies in medicine with the [[College of Preceptors]] and [[Worshipful Society of Apothecaries]] and at the [[University of Durham]] and [[University College London]]; she also attended the lectures of the French psychologist [[Pierre Janet]] at the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]], Paris.\n\nMurray was a member of the [[Women's Freedom League]] and [[Women's Tax Resistance League]], two organisations that took [[direct action]] in their campaign for [[women's suffrage]]. In 1910 she and the journalist [[H. N. Brailsford|Henry Brailsford]] took statements from the suffragettes who had been mistreated during the [[Black Friday (1910)|Black Friday]] demonstrations in November that year. Their published memorandum was presented to the [[Home Office]], along with a formal request for a public inquiry; the [[Home Secretary]], [[Winston Churchill]], refused to set one up.\n\nIn 1913 Murray and her close friend Julia Turner opened the Medico-Psychological Clinic, a pioneering entity that provided [[psychological evaluation]] and treatment, affordable for [[middle-class]] families. Several of the staff who worked and trained at the clinic became leading psychoanalysts. Murray was awarded an [[Doctor of Medicine#UK, Ireland and some Commonwealth countries|MD]] by the University of Durham in 1919. Shortly afterwards she was diagnosed with [[ovarian cancer]]; she died in September 1920, aged 53.\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n==Early life, education and professional training: 1867\u20131910==\n[[File:Lord Riddell; Dame Louisa Aldrich-Blake. Wellcome L0030958.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[London School of Medicine for Women]], where Murray studied]]\nJessie Margaret Murray was born in [[Hazaribagh]], [[British Raj|British India]] on 9 February 1867 to Hugh Hildyard, a [[lieutenant]] of the [[Royal Artillery]], and Frances Jane Murray. The couple also had two younger daughters while in India, Mary Ethel and Edith May. In about 1880 Frances Murray and her children travelled to Edinburgh, and by 1891 they were living in London. Five years later the family was living in [[Bayswater]], West London, when Hugh, then a retired colonel, died.{{sfn|Valentine|2009|pp=145\u2013146}}\n\nIn 1898 Murray met Julia Turner, who was completing an [[undergraduate degree]] in [[classics]] at [[University College London]]. The two formed a close friendship; Elizabeth Valentine, Murray's biographer, considers the relationship was an \"intimate friendship&nbsp;... that showed many of the signs of a life partnership\".{{sfn|Valentine|2009|p=146}} Turner gave Murray private tuition, and she passed the first stage examinations of the [[College of Preceptors]] in 1899. In February 1900 she began studying at the [[London School of Medicine for Women]] and then enrolled as student at the [[Newcastle University Medical School|College of Medicine, Newcastle]]. In June 1908 she passed her examinations to become a Licentiate in Medicine and Surgery of the [[Worshipful Society of Apothecaries]]. The following year she was granted the degree of [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery]] at the [[University of Durham]]; her study also included the field of [[Clinical psychology|psychological medicine]]. Sometime later Murray also attended the lectures of the French psychologist [[Pierre Janet]] at the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]], Paris.{{sfn|Boll|1962|p=311}}{{sfn|Valentine|2009|pp=146\u2013147}}\n\n==Women's suffrage activism==\n[[File:Black Friday, London, 18 November 1910, suffragette attacked.jpg|thumb|upright=1|A [[suffragette]] on the ground on [[Black Friday (1910)|Black Friday]]; Murray co-wrote a report on the violence the demonstrators received.]]\nMurray was a member of the [[Women's Freedom League]], a militant organisation for [[women's suffrage]], founded in 1907, which eschewed violence in favour of [[Nonviolent resistance|non-violent tactics]]; Turner was also a member, while Turner's two sisters were members of the [[Women's Social and Political Union]].{{sfn|Valentine|2009|pp=148\u2013149}}\n\nOn [[Black Friday (1910)|Black Friday]]\u201418 November 1910\u2014a [[suffragette]] demonstration of 300 women marchers was treated with violence, some of it sexual, by the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan police]] and bystanders. Murray and the journalist [[H. N.

Murray hosted group meetings at her house and, in 1911, had property seized by [[bailiff]]s for non-payment of her taxes. She wrote on her demand \"I, a member of the Tax Resistance League, hereby declare that I have conscientious objections to paying King's taxes so long as women are denied the suffrage. I maintain that taxation without representation is unconstitutional.\"<ref>''The Daily Chronicle''. 26 April 1911, quoted in {{harvnb|Valentine|2009|pp=149\u2013150}}.</ref> Her debts were covered by the sale of a sideboard and chairs, although she refused to allow her property to be purchased back by her friends.{{sfn|\"A Woman Tax Resister's Goods Sold\".

Initially the clinic operated informally, opening only three afternoons a week, offering their services to those who could not afford an alternative; one of the clinic's aims was to provide treatment that could be afforded by [[middle-class]] patients.{{sfn|Raitt|2004|pp=68\u201369}}\n\nThe clinic was pioneering, according to [[British Psychoanalytical Society|The Institute of Psychoanalysis]].{{sfn|\"100 Years of History\".

From July 1915 the clinic began a training programme for psychotherapists\u2014the Society for the Study of Orthopsychics.{{sfn|Raitt|2004|p=69}} Several of the staff who worked and studied there later became leading psychoanalysts, including James Glover,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Ernest|last2= |first2= |date=1927|title=James Glover, 1882-1926|url= |journal=[[The International Journal of Psychoanalysis|International Journal of Psychoanalysis]]|volume=8|issue= |pages=1\u20149|doi= |access-date=}}</ref> [[Susan Sutherland Isaacs|Susan Isaacs]], [[Sylvia Payne]], [[Marjorie Brierley]] and [[Ella Freeman Sharpe]].{{sfn|\"100 Years of History\".
