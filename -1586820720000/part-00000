It aired on October 26, 2017 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the United States. The episode was written by Jalysa Conway and directed by [[Cecilie Mosli]]; Conway, an Air Force veteran, found inspiration in her own experiences to conceive the episode. \"Danger Zone\" takes place during two time lapses: the present time, in Seattle, where [[Owen Hunt]] ([[Kevin McKidd]]) deals with the decision his sister, Megan Hunt ([[Abigail Spencer]]) has made with former fianc\u00e9e [[Nathan Riggs]] ([[Martin Henderson]]), to move in to [[Malibu, California]] with Megan's adopted son from [[Iraq]], Farouk; and in Iraq during 2007, where Megan, Riggs, Owen and his best friend [[Teddy Altman]] ([[Kim Raver]]) were stationed, explaining the backstory of Megan's kidnapping and Riggs' proposal to her.\n\n\"Danger Zone\" was designed as the departure for series regular [[Martin Henderson]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/greys-anatomy-season-14-martin-henderson-1202600103/|title=\u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019 Season 14 Sees Another Series Regular Depart|first=Danielle|last=Turchiano|date=27 October 2017|website=Variety|accessdate=29 October 2017}}</ref> having joined the cast in 2015 and conceived originally as the love interest for [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]) following the death of her husband, [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] ([[Patrick Dempsey]]).\n\nThe episode's original broadcast was watched by 7.67 million viewers. It received moderately positive reception from critics and fans, praising Spencer's performance, as well Mosli's direction and Conway's writing, but being less receptive into Martin Henderson's abrupt departure.\n\n==Plot==\nIn Iraq in 2007, Megan is waiting to hear back on stratification rankings. She needs to be number one to realise her dream of becoming flight surgeon. As she goes to wake up Nathan, she finds a necklace under a pile of clothes. He claims he intended to propose to her and chose for a necklace rather than a ring since she loses everything that is not attached to her. She accepts and shares the news with Teddy and Owen, but her happiness is quickly crushed when it is announced that she is not number one in the ranking. Megan thinks that Owen, her Commanding Officer, has recommended her, while he actually did the opposite in an attempt to protect her from the dangerous position. As multiple wounded soldiers come in after two of their Iraqi allies went rogue, the siblings end up operating on the same patient and Megan discovers the truth. Meanwhile, Teddy and Nathan operate together. Teddy knows Nathan cheated on Megan because she recognised the necklace as belonging to a woman named Felicia. He admits to cheating and she convinces him to tell Megan the truth since he really does want to marry her. This leads to a heated confrontation between the two, which is interrupted when Megan has to tend to Sana, one of her patients. When Megan tells Owen about Nathan cheating, he tells her to get away from Nathan and board the next evacuation helicopter with the patient, which is against protocol. At the same time, Teddy's patient informs her that the second shooter was actually an Iraqi woman, whom the Army doctors were previously told tried to wrestle the gun out of a man's hands. Teddy connects the dots but she's seconds too late to warn Megan, and can only watch the helicopter fly away. Distraught over both her brother's and Nathan's betrayal, Megan is distracted and does not notice Sana reaching for a gun, which would lead to Megan being kidnapped.\n\nIn the present, Owen decides to drive with Megan to her new house in Malibu, which Nathan and Farouk are preparing as they await her arrival. On the road, they happily reminisce about their past but end up fighting over the fact that Owen caused her to lose out on the flight surgeon training. They eventually have a heart-to-heart when he confesses he'd rather have her stay in Seattle with him. She makes it clear it is not his job to protect her anymore, and that she has no reason to hate Nathan for cheating on her as, unbeknownst to Owen, she had cheated on him first. She confides that all those years in captivity have taught her that every little bit of happiness is worth clinging to, regardless of what everyone else thinks. In captivity, she decided she wanted to live on the beach to experience freedom. She also offers Owen some words of wisdom by pointing out that he is very loyal to his ideas and ideals, but that in order to be happy, he might have to break up with some of those ideals. Meanwhile, Nathan and Meredith have their final conversation through texts, in which they thank one another for what they have meant in each other's lives. Megan then joins Nathan and Farouk at their new home. As one happy family, they spend time on the beach.\n\nOwen returns home to Amelia and announces that he has decided they need to separate to be happy again, something she has come to realise as well. They return their rings and hug.\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = MartinhEN.jpg\n| width1 = 170\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Abigail Spencer 2013 2.jpg\n| width2 = 200\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = [[Martin Henderson]] (''left'') and [[Abigail Spencer]] (''right'') made their final appearances in \"Danger Zone\" as Nathan Riggs and Megan Hunt.\n}}\nThe episode marked the final appearances of Nathan Riggs and Megan Hunt.

She said, \"I loved that we were able to give Riggs a happy ending worthy of his character and talent. As for Martin, this is not an ending for our relationship. He has been  part of the Shondaland family since the pilot of Inside the Box and he will always be family. I can\u2019t wait to find a new project to work with him on in the future.\" Henderson indicated in an interview with ''[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]'' that his departure was a storytelling based decision, as he was given a \"short-term contract\", adding, \"This [was] my final year so I was expecting Nathan\u2019s storyline to be wrapped up.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2017/10/26/martin-henderson-leaves-greys-anatomy-nathan-season-14/|title=Grey's Anatomy Shocker: [Spoiler] Exits|first=Michael|last=Ausiello|date=27 October 2017|publisher=tvline.com|accessdate=29 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nHenderson shared his thoughts on his relationships with both Megan and Meredith\n<blockquote>\nI think there was clearly something for Nathan in those relationships. Feelings like that, I don\u2019t think they go away. The nature of his previous commitment to Megan and his feelings around that put him in a horrible state of having to choose between two people he cares about, but honoring his commitment to Megan and following through on that is the right thing to do. It doesn\u2019t negate his feelings for Meredith. The complications of Meredith\u2019s emotions, the loss of Derek and moving on from that still plagues her. And there\u2019s as much ambiguity around all those feelings. The two of them found each other and that provided good drama. I feel bad for fans who were keen on Meredith and Nathan making it, and not being privy to where each character would go. It\u2019s hard to hear those outpourings from those who didn\u2019t know it was going to end up like this. But it makes for nice drama and it\u2019s something that Shonda does brilliantly: Dashing people\u2019s hopes and expectations. That\u2019s why the show continues to be successful.

Capital may be committed to new investments at any time during the fund's life.\n*'''Evergreen Funds''': \u201cEvergreen funds\u201d invest in marketable securities on a long and short basis.

Capital may be committed to new investments at any time during the fund's life.\n*'''Evergreen Funds''': \u201cEvergreen funds\u201d invest in marketable securities on a long and short basis.

[[Allan Kardec]] (1804\u20131869) sought to codify the lessons thus obtained in a set of five books, the ''[[Spiritist Codification]]'' (the''Spiritist Pentateuch'', 1857\u20131868), including ''[[The Spirits Book]]'' (1857) and ''[[Heaven and Hell (Allan Kardec)|Heaven and Hell]]'' (1865) ; these books introduce concepts of how spirits evolve through a series of incarnations. [[Madame Blavatsky]] (1831\u20131891), co-founder of the [[Theosophical Society]], developed these ideas further in [[The Secret Doctrine]] (1888), and brought it to the attention of a wider public. Past life regression therapy has been developed since the 1950s by [[Clinical psychology|psychologists]], [[Psychiatry|psychiatrists]] and [[Mediumship|mediums]]. The belief gained credibility because some of the advocates possess legitimate credentials, though these credentials were in areas unrelated to religion, psychotherapy or other domains dealing with past lives and mental health. Interest in the phenomenon started due to American housewife Virginia Tighe reporting and recounting the alleged memories of a 19th-century Irish woman named [[Bridey Murphy]]; later investigation failed to support the existence of such a woman and the memories were attributed to Tighe's childhood during which she spent time living next to an Irish immigrant with great similarity to the character she described.<ref name = Skepdic/>\n\nPast life regression is widely rejected as a psychiatric treatment by clinical psychiatrists and psychologists.

[[Allan Kardec]] (1804\u20131869) sought to codify the lessons thus obtained in a set of five books, the ''[[Spiritist Codification]]'' (the''Spiritist Pentateuch'', 1857\u20131868), including ''[[The Spirits Book]]'' (1857) and ''[[Heaven and Hell (Allan Kardec)|Heaven and Hell]]'' (1865) ; these books introduce concepts of how spirits evolve through a series of incarnations. [[Madame Blavatsky]] (1831\u20131891), co-founder of the [[Theosophical Society]], developed these ideas further in [[The Secret Doctrine]] (1888), and brought it to the attention of a wider public. Past life regression therapy has been developed since the 1950s by [[Clinical psychology|psychologists]], [[Psychiatry|psychiatrists]] and [[Mediumship|mediums]]. The belief gained credibility because some of the advocates possess legitimate credentials, though these credentials were in areas unrelated to religion, psychotherapy or other domains dealing with past lives and mental health. Interest in the phenomenon started due to American housewife Virginia Tighe reporting and recounting the alleged memories of a 19th-century Irish woman named [[Bridey Murphy]]; later investigation failed to support the existence of such a woman and the memories were attributed to Tighe's childhood during which she spent time living next to an Irish immigrant with great similarity to the character she described.<ref name = Skepdic/>\n\nPast life regression is widely rejected as a psychiatric treatment by clinical psychiatrists and psychologists.

Like the [[Seventh Day Baptists]] and the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], the Churches of God (Seventh Day) observe Sabbath, the seventh day of the week (Saturday).\n\n==Church of God (Seventh Day)==\nThe Church of God (Seventh Day) represents a line of [[Sabbatarian]] [[Adventism|Adventists]] that rejected the visions and teachings of [[Ellen G. White]] before the formation of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in 1863. Robert Coulter, ex-president and official historian of the General Conference of the Church of God (Seventh Day), in his book ''The Journey: A History of the Church of God (Seventh Day)'' (2014) credits Gilbert Cranmer (1814\u20131903) of [[Michigan]] as being the founder of the church.<ref>Robert Coulter, \"The Journey: A History of the Church of God (Seventh Day)\" (2014), p.17, {{ISBN|978-0-615-99123-8}}</ref> Cranmer was a [[Christian Connection]] minister<ref>Robert Coulter, \"The Journey: A History of the Church of God (Seventh Day)\" (2014), p.22-36, {{ISBN|978-0-615-99123-8}}</ref> and a [[biblical Unitarianism]].<ref name=\"Robert Coulter 2014 p.186\">Robert Coulter, \"The Journey: A History of the Church of God (Seventh Day)\" (2014) p.186, {{ISBN|978-0-615-99123-8}}</ref> He was introduced to Sabbath keeping in 1852 by [[Joseph Bates (Adventist)|Joseph Bates]], known as the founder and developer of Sabbatarian Adventism.<ref>Robert Coulter, \"The Journey: A History of the Church of God (Seventh Day)\" (2014), p.52, {{ISBN|978-0-615-99123-8}}</ref> In 1858, five years before the founding of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, a group led by Cranmer separated from the Adventists who supported [[James Springer White]] and Ellen G. White. Another independent Sabbatarian Adventist body formed in [[Iowa]] in 1860, and joined with the Church of God (Seventh Day) in 1863.\n\nA publication called ''The Hope of Israel'' (now ''The Bible Advocate'') was started in 1863, and this publication extended the influence of the body into other areas. Through this publication, the doctrines of the second advent and [[seventh-day Sabbath]] were promoted, and other Christians were invited to gather for meetings. This extended the movement into [[Missouri]], [[Nebraska]] and other places, and in 1884 the General Conference of the Church of God was organized. They incorporated in 1899, and \"(Seventh Day)\" was added to the name in 1923. Offices were established in [[Stanberry, Missouri]].\n\nA.N. Dugger and [[C.O. Dodd]] (1935)<ref>''A history of the True Religion Traced From 33 A.D. to Date'', A. Dugger and C. O. Dodd, Bible Advocate 1935</ref> wrote a book attempting to trace the Church's history back to the Apostles through various [[medieval]] groups that they believed were Sabbath-keeping. In the case of some of these groups, such as the [[Waldensians]]<ref>Giorgio Tourn ''You are my Witnesses: The Waldensians Across Eight Centuries''. Torino, Italy: Claudiana Editrice, 1989. {{ISBN|88-7016-089-0}}</ref> and [[Paulicians]],<ref>[[Frederick Cornwallis Conybeare]] \"Was the Sabbath observed in the early Armenian church?\" p.clxii in ''The Key of Truth. A Manual of the Paulician Church of Armenia.''</ref> that claim is disputed.\n\nA well-publicized member of the church was evangelist [[Herbert W. Armstrong]] (1893\u20131986). In 1927 Armstrong was challenged by his wife, Loma, to find a biblical justification for keeping Sunday as the Christian Sabbath day. Loma had come under the influence of Emma Runcorn, a member of the Seventh Day church in the Willamette Valley of Oregon. Runcorn and her husband Ora were lay leaders in the Oregon conference. Armstrong soon became a minister for that church and a writer for the ''Bible Advocate'' journal. Within a few years, Armstrong began teaching the [[British Israelism|British-Israel Theory]] &ndash; the alternative history that regarded the nations of Western Europe and North America as the literal descendants of the \"Lost Ten Tribes\" of Israel &ndash; and the mandatory keeping of the [[Christian observances of Jewish holidays|Feast Days in Leviticus 23]]. Armstrong disassociated himself from the Church of God (7th Day) - Salem Conference over these two issues, which were not original doctrines of the Churches of God (7th Day); years later, Church of God (7th Day) revoked his ministerial credentials with their Church, but by this time he was well-established in his own church, the [[Radio Church of God]].<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.ukapologetics.net/1bioherb.html | title = A Brief Biography of Herbert W.

According to A.N. Dugger a Church of God historian, and leader of one of the factions at the time, many in the Church of God felt the need for a \"Bible Organization\" for the Church of God. They also wanted to move the church's world headquarters to [[Jerusalem]]. They held a conference in [[Salem, West Virginia]], on November 4, 1933.  \n\nPressure was mounting for more unity from roughly half of the membership. While others felt that they were being denied freedom of expression. Dugger and his followers wanted a reorganization of church doctrine. Including clean meats, no tobacco, and observing the Passover on Nisan 14. While Burt F. Marrs led a group of \"independents\" who were believed pork and tobacco were fine, and that the Passover should be observed on Nisan 15. \n\nAt this point, Dugger and his followers decided to establish the Salem Conference headquarters in Salem West Virginia. At which point they started printing the ''Bible Advocate''. \n\nAs a result rom 1933 to 1949 there were two separate Church of God organizations, one at Stanberry, Missouri, and the other at Salem, West Virginia.\n\nThe headquarters in Salem still exists today with members worldwide<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.churchofgod-7thday.org | title = Church of God (7th Day) - Salem Conference}}.</ref>. They are formally organized under the apostolic model (twelve apostles, seventy elders and seven men to oversee the business affairs of the church).<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.giveshare.org/churchhistory/historysdcog/history10.html | title = X.

The Merger: 1948-1949 | type = online history book | publisher = Giving & Sharing | format = online page}}.</ref>\n\nThe first attempt for a merger between the Stanberry and Salem Conferences occurred in 1942. A copyright lawsuit concerning the ''Bible Advocate'' magazine and the publication of the ''Bible Home Instructor'' hindered the merger. In 1947, the Salem Council of Ministers asked Stanberry to appoint a committee to meet with their committee to discuss a new attempt for a merger. The two churches met at [[Fairview, Oklahoma]], on February 12\u201317, 1948. Because of the laws under which the Stanberry group was incorporated, the earliest possible time the union of the two groups could take place was August 1949. The merger was voted on August 12\u201320, 1949, and the first issue of the combined ''Bible Advocate'' came out on October 3, 1949. Charles Monroe, who wrote ''A Synoptic History of the Churches of God in the Latter Days'', (Facts of Our Faith, January, 1969, pages 12\u201325) related, \"the merger did not unite all of the Church of God.\"\n\n==\"Back to Salem\" movement of 1950==\nThe following information concerning the \"Back to Salem\" Movement of 1950 are taken from ''History of the Seventh Day Church of God'' by Richard C.

Summers and his son-in-law Chris Royer went back to Salem and established a headquarters there. The \"Back to Salem\" movement broke into at least three factions: 1. The original Salem people who stayed at Salem with it as headquarters; 2. Dugger and Severson, who went to Jerusalem; and 3. Olson and Groshans, who formed the Seventh Day Church of God in [[Caldwell, Idaho]]. The Salem Conference started to publish a magazine, ''The Advocate of Truth'', in February 1950. Salem is purported to believe that the saints will be raptured to the sea of glass while the seven last plagues will be poured out. It differs with the Denver Group in the date for the annual Lord's Supper, which they calculate according to the spring equinox.\n\nIn September 1952, Dugger, after returning from an extended trip to [[Nigeria]] to visit Church of God groups, decided to move to Jerusalem to start ''The Mount Zion Reporter'' in 1953. Possibly doctrinal issues led to Dugger's exit to Israel.\n\nThe 1948/49 Stanberry Merger of the Church of God (Seventh Day), also known as the Denver Group, contains the largest number of Church of God people today, but it is not the only significant Church of God center. The Stanberry conference, with headquarters moved to [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Colorado]], typically uses the name General Conference of the Church of God (Seventh-Day), with \"Seventh\" spelled out and often with a hyphen.\n\nA number of Churches of God (7th Day) in Salem, West Virginia still stand with locations all across the United States and around the world. These usually follow a set of 40 points of doctrine.<ref name=\"40 Points of Doctrine\">{{Citation | url = http://www.mzchurchofgod.com/40-Points-Of-Doctrine | title = 40 Points of Doctrine | publisher = Mount Zion Church of God (7th day) Winnipeg | format = article}}.</ref>\n\n==Membership==\nAs of 2010, the Church of God (Seventh Day) has 233 congregations in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], with an estimated 14,000 members.<ref>[http://www.thearda.com/Denoms/D_1232.asp] Data from the National Council of Churches' Historic Archive CD and Yearbook of American & Canadian Churches</ref> As for the Denver Conference, the worldwide membership in its International Ministerial Congress is over 200,000 members, with affiliated ministries in more than 40 countries. Central offices for the North American conference are in Denver as of 2015, with Elder Loren Stacy serving as its president. The Denver Conference is a member of the [[Bible Sabbath Association]] (org. 1943), an organization promoting \"fellowship and cooperation between Sabbath-keepers of various groups.\"The Salem conference has members in South Africa\n\n==Doctrine and practices==\nThis section mainly uses the General Conference of the Church of God (Seventh Day) [Denver Conference] Statement of Faith as a reference.<ref name=sof>[https://cog7.org/about-us/what-we-believe/]</ref> Although the doctrinal beliefs among the General Council Churches of God, (Seventh-Day), Inc.<ref name=\"Council COG7\">[https://www.actsforgod.org/downloads/declaration.pdf]</ref> in Meridian, Idaho and different Churches of God (7th Day) or (Seventh Day) are very similar, some major points of disagreement still remain, either concerning christological beliefs or church organization.\n\nOutlining some beliefs of the Churches of God (7th Day), the Statement of Faith of the General Conference of the Church of God (Seventh Day) - Denver Conference states the following:\n*Christology has been a long debated issue in the Churches of God (7th Day).<ref>Robert Coulter, \"The Journey: A History of the Church of God (Seventh Day)\" (2014), p.185-200, {{ISBN|978-0-615-99123-8}}</ref> Cranmer, the founder of the Church of God (Seventh Day), left the Methodist Church to join the [[Christian Connection]] \"over the doctrine of the Trinity\".<ref>Robert Coulter, \"The Journey: A History of the Church of God (Seventh Day)\" (2014), p.25, {{ISBN|978-0-615-99123-8}}</ref> Cranmer was a biblical Unitarian.

Like the [[Seventh Day Baptists]] and the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], the Churches of God (Seventh Day) observe Sabbath, the seventh day of the week (Saturday).\n\n==Church of God (Seventh Day)==\nThe Church of God (Seventh Day) represents a line of [[Sabbatarian]] [[Adventism|Adventists]] that rejected the visions and teachings of [[Ellen G. White]] before the formation of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in 1863. Robert Coulter, ex-president and official historian of the General Conference of the Church of God (Seventh Day), in his book ''The Journey: A History of the Church of God (Seventh Day)'' (2014) credits Gilbert Cranmer (1814\u20131903) of [[Michigan]] as being the founder of the church.<ref>Robert Coulter, \"The Journey: A History of the Church of God (Seventh Day)\" (2014), p.17, {{ISBN|978-0-615-99123-8}}</ref> Cranmer was a [[Christian Connection]] minister<ref>Robert Coulter, \"The Journey: A History of the Church of God (Seventh Day)\" (2014), p.22-36, {{ISBN|978-0-615-99123-8}}</ref> and a [[biblical Unitarianism]].<ref name=\"Robert Coulter 2014 p.186\">Robert Coulter, \"The Journey: A History of the Church of God (Seventh Day)\" (2014) p.186, {{ISBN|978-0-615-99123-8}}</ref> He was introduced to Sabbath keeping in 1852 by [[Joseph Bates (Adventist)|Joseph Bates]], known as the founder and developer of Sabbatarian Adventism.<ref>Robert Coulter, \"The Journey: A History of the Church of God (Seventh Day)\" (2014), p.52, {{ISBN|978-0-615-99123-8}}</ref> In 1858, five years before the founding of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, a group led by Cranmer separated from the Adventists who supported [[James Springer White]] and Ellen G. White. Another independent Sabbatarian Adventist body formed in [[Iowa]] in 1860, and joined with the Church of God (Seventh Day) in 1863.\n\nA publication called ''The Hope of Israel'' (now ''The Bible Advocate'') was started in 1863, and this publication extended the influence of the body into other areas. Through this publication, the doctrines of the second advent and [[seventh-day Sabbath]] were promoted, and other Christians were invited to gather for meetings. This extended the movement into [[Missouri]], [[Nebraska]] and other places, and in 1884 the General Conference of the Church of God was organized. They incorporated in 1899, and \"(Seventh Day)\" was added to the name in 1923. Offices were established in [[Stanberry, Missouri]].\n\nA.N. Dugger and [[C.O. Dodd]] (1935)<ref>''A history of the True Religion Traced From 33 A.D. to Date'', A. Dugger and C. O. Dodd, Bible Advocate 1935</ref> wrote a book attempting to trace the Church's history back to the Apostles through various [[medieval]] groups that they believed were Sabbath-keeping. In the case of some of these groups, such as the [[Waldensians]]<ref>Giorgio Tourn ''You are my Witnesses: The Waldensians Across Eight Centuries''. Torino, Italy: Claudiana Editrice, 1989. {{ISBN|88-7016-089-0}}</ref> and [[Paulicians]],<ref>[[Frederick Cornwallis Conybeare]] \"Was the Sabbath observed in the early Armenian church?\" p.clxii in ''The Key of Truth. A Manual of the Paulician Church of Armenia.''</ref> that claim is disputed.\n\nA well-publicized member of the church was evangelist [[Herbert W. Armstrong]] (1893\u20131986). In 1927 Armstrong was challenged by his wife, Loma, to find a biblical justification for keeping Sunday as the Christian Sabbath day. Loma had come under the influence of Emma Runcorn, a member of the Seventh Day church in the Willamette Valley of Oregon. Runcorn and her husband Ora were lay leaders in the Oregon conference. Armstrong soon became a minister for that church and a writer for the ''Bible Advocate'' journal. Within a few years, Armstrong began teaching the [[British Israelism|British-Israel Theory]] &ndash; the alternative history that regarded the nations of Western Europe and North America as the literal descendants of the \"Lost Ten Tribes\" of Israel &ndash; and the mandatory keeping of the [[Christian observances of Jewish holidays|Feast Days in Leviticus 23]]. Armstrong disassociated himself from the Church of God (7th Day) - Salem Conference over these two issues, which were not original doctrines of the Churches of God (7th Day); years later, Church of God (7th Day) revoked his ministerial credentials with their Church, but by this time he was well-established in his own church, the [[Radio Church of God]].<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.ukapologetics.net/1bioherb.html | title = A Brief Biography of Herbert W.

According to A.N. Dugger a Church of God historian, and leader of one of the factions at the time, many in the Church of God felt the need for a \"Bible Organization\" for the Church of God. They also wanted to move the church's world headquarters to [[Jerusalem]]. They held a conference in [[Salem, West Virginia]], on November 4, 1933.  \n\nPressure was mounting for more unity from roughly half of the membership. While others felt that they were being denied freedom of expression. Dugger and his followers wanted a reorganization of church doctrine. Including clean meats, no tobacco, and observing the Passover on Nisan 14. While Burt F. Marrs led a group of \"independents\" who were believed pork and tobacco were fine, and that the Passover should be observed on Nisan 15. \n\nAt this point, Dugger and his followers decided to establish the Salem Conference headquarters in Salem West Virginia. At which point they started printing the ''Bible Advocate''. \n\nAs a result rom 1933 to 1949 there were two separate Church of God organizations, one at Stanberry, Missouri, and the other at Salem, West Virginia.\n\nThe headquarters in Salem still exists today with members worldwide<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.churchofgod-7thday.org | title = Church of God (7th Day) - Salem Conference}}.</ref>. They are formally organized under the apostolic model (twelve apostles, seventy elders and seven men to oversee the business affairs of the church).<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.giveshare.org/churchhistory/historysdcog/history10.html | title = X.

The Merger: 1948-1949 | type = online history book | publisher = Giving & Sharing | format = online page}}.</ref>\n\nThe first attempt for a merger between the Stanberry and Salem Conferences occurred in 1942. A copyright lawsuit concerning the ''Bible Advocate'' magazine and the publication of the ''Bible Home Instructor'' hindered the merger. In 1947, the Salem Council of Ministers asked Stanberry to appoint a committee to meet with their committee to discuss a new attempt for a merger. The two churches met at [[Fairview, Oklahoma]], on February 12\u201317, 1948. Because of the laws under which the Stanberry group was incorporated, the earliest possible time the union of the two groups could take place was August 1949. The merger was voted on August 12\u201320, 1949, and the first issue of the combined ''Bible Advocate'' came out on October 3, 1949. Charles Monroe, who wrote ''A Synoptic History of the Churches of God in the Latter Days'', (Facts of Our Faith, January, 1969, pages 12\u201325) related, \"the merger did not unite all of the Church of God.\"\n\n==\"Back to Salem\" movement of 1950==\nThe following information concerning the \"Back to Salem\" Movement of 1950 are taken from ''History of the Seventh Day Church of God'' by Richard C.

Summers and his son-in-law Chris Royer went back to Salem and established a headquarters there. The \"Back to Salem\" movement broke into at least three factions: 1. The original Salem people who stayed at Salem with it as headquarters; 2. Dugger and Severson, who went to Jerusalem; and 3. Olson and Groshans, who formed the Seventh Day Church of God in [[Caldwell, Idaho]]. The Salem Conference started to publish a magazine, ''The Advocate of Truth'', in February 1950. Salem is purported to believe that the saints will be raptured to the sea of glass while the seven last plagues will be poured out. It differs with the Denver Group in the date for the annual Lord's Supper, which they calculate according to the spring equinox.\n\nIn September 1952, Dugger, after returning from an extended trip to [[Nigeria]] to visit Church of God groups, decided to move to Jerusalem to start ''The Mount Zion Reporter'' in 1953. Possibly doctrinal issues led to Dugger's exit to Israel.\n\nThe 1948/49 Stanberry Merger of the Church of God (Seventh Day), also known as the Denver Group, contains the largest number of Church of God people today, but it is not the only significant Church of God center. The Stanberry conference, with headquarters moved to [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Colorado]], typically uses the name General Conference of the Church of God (Seventh-Day), with \"Seventh\" spelled out and often with a hyphen.\n\nA number of Churches of God (7th Day) in Salem, West Virginia still stand with locations all across the United States and around the world. These usually follow a set of 40 points of doctrine.<ref name=\"40 Points of Doctrine\">{{Citation | url = http://www.mzchurchofgod.com/40-Points-Of-Doctrine | title = 40 Points of Doctrine | publisher = Mount Zion Church of God (7th day) Winnipeg | format = article}}.</ref>\n\n==Membership==\nAs of 2010, the Church of God (Seventh Day) has 233 congregations in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], with an estimated 14,000 members.<ref>[http://www.thearda.com/Denoms/D_1232.asp] Data from the National Council of Churches' Historic Archive CD and Yearbook of American & Canadian Churches</ref> As for the Denver Conference, the worldwide membership in its International Ministerial Congress is over 200,000 members, with affiliated ministries in more than 40 countries. Central offices for the North American conference are in Denver as of 2015, with Elder Loren Stacy serving as its president.
