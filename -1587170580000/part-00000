{"title_page": "Katalonan", "text_new": "{{mergeto|Babaylan|discuss=Talk:Katalonan#Merger proposal}}\n\nA '''Katalonan''' (also spelled Catalonan, Catalona; ''Catulunan'' in [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]]) is a priest or priestess in the [[Indigenous religious beliefs of the Tagalog people|indigenous religions]] of the [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] and [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangan]] people. Spanish friars and missionaries also called them anitero (male) and anitera (female). They are the Central to Southern Luzon equivalent of the [[Visayans|Visayan]] [[Babaylan]]. They safeguard the [[dambana]], along with religious practices, of a community called [[barangay]].\n\n==Etymology==\nAccording to Jaime Veneracion, catalonan incorporates the root ''talon'' which in ancient Tagalog meant \"forest\" (cf. [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]], [[Masbatenyo language|Masbatenyo]], [[Inabaknon language|Inabaknon]], [[Capisano language|Capisano]], [[Palawano language|Palawano]], [[Buhid language|Buhid]], and [[Agutaynen language|Agutaynen]] ''talon'', \"forest\" or \"thicket\").<ref name=\"Greenhill\">{{cite journal |last1=Greenhill |first1=S.J. |last2=Blust |first2=R |last3=Gray |first3=R.D. |title=The Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database: From Bioinformatics to Lexomics |journal=Evolutionary Bioinformatics |date=2008 |volume=4 |pages=271\u2013283 |url=https://abvd.shh.mpg.de/austronesian/word.php?v=127}}</ref> Other scholars believed that the origin of the word catalonan is from its root word \u201ctalo\u201d which according to them is a Tagalog word originally means \"to converse\", thus the word catalonan literally means someone who converse or communicate with the spirits (anito). According to Blumentritt an old Tagalog word \u201ctarotaro\u201d is a term describing the catalonas while possessed by the spirits (anito). In some [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]] such as [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]] \u201ctarotaro\u201d means \u2018to pray\u2019, while in [[Rapanui]] it means \u2018a malediction or curse\u2019. In [[Samoan language|Samoan]] \u201ctalo or talotalo\u201d means \u2018a prayer or to pray\u2019.\n\nLinguist Malcolm Mintz, however, offers a different etymology. He determines that the Tagalog root word is \u201ctulong\u201d which means to help. Some writers such as [[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Henry Scott]] and [[Luciano P. R. Santiago]] favoured Mintz suggestion and used the term catolonan (which is actually a Pampangan term) to refer to the priests and priestesses of the Tagalogs instead of catalona or catalonan. Some scholars proposed the Sanskrit word \u201ctaruna\u201d which means juvenile youth as the origin of the Tagalog catalona, however it was disregard by majority since the word itself has no spiritual or religious significance. Also most scholars were uncertain if catalona was the correct spelling, since they can\u2019t find any etymological significance to the word catalona compared to catalonan, which is open to several possible connotations, for they assumed that catalona or catalonan is a word indigenous to the Tagalogs. Most scholars and some historians believed that catalonan, not catalona, is the correct spelling of the term; they premised that unlike Spanish, the indigenous languages of the Philippines have neither gendered pronouns, nor suffixes to denote sex. In this regard the Spaniard tends to Hispanicise and then assimilate some native signifiers. The Hispanic need to have gendered-specific terms meant that the indigenous signifiers were gendered with the dropping of the final \u2018n\u2019 from catalonan (catalona) the same with the addition of an \u2018a\u2019 to baylan (baylana) or babaylan (babaylana).\n\nAmong the people of the island of Nias, Indonesia, \u201ckataruna\u201d were mediums or diviners which predominantly female just like catalona their Tagalog counterpart. However unlike the latter, katarunas themselves do not have the function of a [[priest]] or priestess and are considered inferior to \u201cere\u201d the actual priests and priestesses.\n\n==Social Status==\nAccording to William Henry Scott (Barangay: Sixteenth-Century Philippines Culture and Society) a catalona could be of either sex, or male transvestites (bayoguin), but were usually women from prominent families who were wealthy in their own right. According to Luciano P. R. Santiago (To Love and to Suffer) as remuneration for their services they received a good part of the offerings of food, wine, clothing, and gold, the quality and quantity of which depended on the social status of the supplicant. Thus, the catalonas filled a very prestigious as well as lucrative role in society. The catalonas came to their calling through training and kinship with other catalonas, in some instances by a mysterious illness such as a seizure from which then they fully recovered. The younger functionaries trained by apprenticeship to a senior catalona who was usually a relative or friend whom they succeeded upon death. The catalona ancestors were worshipped more assiduously than others and the images which represented them were the ones made of wood from hollowed trees or gold or other precious materials. \n\n==Roles and Practices==\nThe catalonas performed public ceremonies for community prosperity, fertility, or seasonable weather as well as private services to diagnose and cure ailments. They were respected for these functions but they were also feared sorcerers able to work black magic. Their numbers too were large enough to put them in competition with one another. Individual success was attributed to the power of the deities with whom they identified, and who took possession of them in their frenzied dancing. The Tagalog word \u201colak\u201d according to Ferdinand Blumentritt is a term for the trembling of the whole body of the catalona, when she becomes possessed by the devil (anito). As spirit mediums, they conducted s\u00e9ances during which they spoke with the voice of spirits (anito), assisted by an alagar (alagad, personal attendant) to carry on the dialogue with the supernatural, or sent their own kaluluwa (soul) to seek lost souls. In this state of trance, the catalona was called \u201ctarotaro\u201d [literally meaning voices], for it was believed that the ancestral spirits had entered her body and were speaking from inside her. According to Blumentritt \u201ctarotaro\u201d is a tagalong term describing the katalonas while possessed by the spirits, in this state, they cried tarotaro. When a catalona held the gift of prophecy, she was named masidhi (the fervent one).\n\n==Conversion to Christianity== \nDuring the Spanish colonization of the Philippines some catalonas converted and embrace Christianity while others tried to resist it. An account of the conversion of catalonas was thus provided by a Spanish priest named Pedro Chirino (1604), he narrated that a blind catalona named Diego Magsanga who along with his wife (who was said to be a skilled midwife) converted to Christianity. After he was baptized in the name Diego he became a faithful assistant of the friars in expanding Christianity in Silang, Cavite. This former catalona contributed a lot in teaching children and adults catechism (Doctrina Christiana). Chirino also reported that a lot of people followed this former catalona and the Jesuits can't even surpassed him when it comes to the teachings of the Church and the diligence of teaching his brethren, although he was not a priest, the likely role the Spanish priest gave him in the church is that of a laity or hermano.\n\nChirino also mentioned another male catalona who together with a group of catalonas he was leading was convinced by a Jesuit priest Francisco Almerique to be converted to Christianity. Chirino noted that this catalona wore his hair long (which is unusual for Tagalog men) and he braids it to signify his priesthood.  Before he was baptized, in front of people, he cut his hair as a sign that the power of the anito has been broken. \n\nSome catalonas however tried to resist Christianity, such as the so called \u201cThe Band of Worthless Women\u201d in San Juan del Monte de Taytay (now part of Rizal Province). It was led by a female catalona who was related to the most prominent families of the village. In defiance of the missionaries, the dominant catalona, who possessed the gold anito, continued to perform healing rituals together with her assistants. She claimed that her anito is friends with the Catholic saints. When found out, she refused to give up her idol by concealing it ingeniously in an old bamboo pole in her house. Only after several attempts to look into every hole and corner of the house did the zealous missionary succeed in finding the coveted anito. The demon (anito) was said to be insulted and hurt at this trick, not being able to wreak any other vengeance, he began (accompanied by many other spirits) the following night to torment the poor catalona with visions and cruel threats. Already undeceived as to the weakness of her idol, she sought for conversion, and, hating the demon, begged for mercy. With the help of a cross, which was given her as a defence, and although the terror continued, the threats were not put into execution; and finally the demon abandoned her as she had him. On one of the feast days, all the errors were publicly reputed in the church, and the catalonas remained convinced, repentant and reconciled by the authority of the bishop. They all betook themselves to a place where, removed from temptations, they could relapse into their evil ways. They were placed in charge of devout and Christian persons, in whose company they led Christian and exemplary lives. \n\n==Confusion with Babaylan==\nThe Katalonan are the Tagalog equivalent of the [[Visayans|Visayan]] [[Babaylan]]. \n\nAlthough many modern Filipinos mistakenly refer to any priest or priestess of the animistic pre-Hispanic Filipino religions as Babaylan, writer [[Nick Joaquin]] and historian [[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Henry Scott]] remind modern Filipinos that the independent cultural evolution of each Filipino ethnic group should be respected.<ref>Scott, William Henry (1994).

It is a [[particular church]] that is [[sui juris|autonomous ''(sui juris)'']], using the [[Byzantine Rite]] and the [[ancient Greek language]] (the language that was the principal of all peoples in the tradition of the Eastern Churches) or the [[Albanian language]] (the mother language of the community) for the liturgy, whose Italo-Albanian ([[Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb people|Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb]]) members are concentrated in [[Southern Italy]] ([[Abruzzo]], [[Apulia]], [[Basilicata]], [[Calabria]]), and [[Sicily]].\n\nThe Italo-Albanian Church is in [[full communion]] with the [[Pope]] of [[Rome]], directly subject to the Roman [[Congregation for the Oriental Churches]], but follows the ritual and spiritual traditions that are common in most of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. Church members are the descendants of the exiled [[Albanians]] who fled to Italy in the 15th century under the pressure of the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] persecutions in [[Albania]] and the territories inhabited by Albanians in the [[Balkans]] and the [[Peloponnese]]. The [[Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb people|Albanian population in Italy]] has maintained until today the [[Arb\u00ebresh language|language]], customs and religious [[Byzantine Rite|rites]] of their origin. This Church maintains their heritage, the ethnic, cultural and religious tradition of the Albanians fathers, keeping alive the spiritual and liturgical tradition of the [[Eastern Church]] from the time of [[Justinian]] (6th century).\n\n== Name ==\nThe [[Byzantine rite]] was brought to Italy in the 15th century by [[Albanians|Albanian]] exiles fleeing from [[Albania]], [[Epirus]] and [[Morea]] because of persecution by [[Ottoman Turks]] of [[Muslim]] faith. Italy had already known Eastern Christian rites in previous centuries, but these had since disappeared. The Albanians, Orthodox united in [[Rome]] with the [[Council of Ferrara-Florence]], brought with them language, customs, customs and belief, jealously keeping the Byzantine rite and naturally bridging between East and West (see Albanian missions in Albania in 1690-1769, contacts with Ohrid, Cretan Byzantine art and new missions of re-Christianization of Albania in 1900<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=y2EPFRL-XJQC&pg=PA75&lpg=PA75&dq=chiesa+italo+albanese&source=bl&ots=jfPjLZ_M-r&sig=z45vRAN4CwH_8REPcD3JHg3GnbI&hl=it&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwijuJrDqOvUAhVMJ8AKHZ-MASs4MhDoAQhJMAk#v=onepage&q=chiesa%20italo%20albanese&f=false  Ines Angjeli Murzak, Returning Home to Rome: The Basilian Monks of Grottaferrata in Albania, Grottaferrata 2009]</ref>).\n\nThe Italo-Albanian Catholic Church Is therefore characterized by a specific ethnic group: the [[Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb people|Albanians of Italy]], ''Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb'' or ''Italo-Albanesi''.\n\nThe only place where the Byzantine Rite remained in Italy was the Monastery of [[Grottaferrata]], an Italo-Greek foundation, which had become steadily [[liturgical Latinisation|latinized]] through the centuries. The Albanians of Sicily and Calabria, from the eighteenth to the present, were bringing the monastery back to life, where most of its monks, abbots and students were and are Italo-Albanian, began to once again flourish.<ref name=ce>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Italo-Greeks}}</ref>\n\nThe name \"Greek\" refers to the [[Byzantine Rite]] (as opposed to \"Latin\" [[Roman Rite]]) and not to an ethnic component.\n\n== History ==\n=== Byzantine period ===\nThe conquest of Italy by the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)]] began a Byzantine period that included the [[Byzantine Papacy|Byzantine domination of the Papacy]] from 537 to 752.\n\nIt is uncertain whether the Byzantine Rite was followed in any diocese of Southern Italy or Sicily before the 8th century. The spread of Greek monasticism in Italy received a strong impulse from the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] invasion of [[Muslim conquest of Syria|the Levant]] and [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt]], and later from the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|ban on religious images or icons]]. The monks naturally retained their rite, and as the bishops were not infrequently chosen from their number, the diocesan liturgy, under favourable conditions, could easily be changed, especially since the Lombard occupation of the inland regions of Southern Italy cut off the Greeks in the South from communication with the Latin Church.<ref name=\"ce\"/>\n\nWhen, in 726, [[Leo III the Isaurian]] withdrew Southern Italy from the [[Pentarchy|patriarchal jurisdiction]] of [[Diocese of Rome|Rome]] and gave it to the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], the process of hellenization became more rapid; it received a further impulse when, on account of the [[Muslim conquest of Sicily]], Greeks and Hellenized Sicilians fled to [[Calabria]] and [[Longobardia|Apulia]]. Still it was not rapid enough to suit the [[Byzantine emperor]]s, who feared lest those regions should again fall under the influence of the West, like the [[Duchy of Rome]] and the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]]. Finally, after the [[Ottonian dynasty|Saxon emperors]] had made a formidable attempt to drive the Greeks from the peninsula, Emperor [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] and the Patriarch [[Polyeuctus of Constantinople|Polyeuctus]] made it obligatory on the bishops, in 968, to adopt the Byzantine Rite. This order aroused lively opposition in some quarters, as at [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bari-Bitonto|Bari]], under Bishop Giovanni. Nor was it executed in other places immediately and universally. Cassano and [[Taranto]], for instance, are said to have always maintained the Roman Rite. At [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Trani-Barletta-Bisceglie|Trani]], in 983, Bishop Rodostamo was allowed to retain the Roman Rite, as a reward for aiding in the surrender of the city to the Greeks. In every diocese there were always some churches which never forsook the Roman Rite; on the other hand, long after the restoration of that rite, there remained Greek churches with native Greek clergy.<ref name=ce/>\n\n=== Re-Latinization ===\nThe restoration of the Roman Rite began with the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Norman conquest]] in the 11th century, especially in the first period of the conquest, when [[Normans|Norman]] ecclesiastics were appointed bishops. Another potent factor was the reform of [[Pope Gregory VII]], who in his efforts to [[Gregorian Reform|repress marriage]] among the Latin clergy found no small obstacle in the example of the Greek priests. However, he and his successors recognized the Byzantine Rite and discipline wherever it was in legitimate possession. Moreover, the Latin bishops ordained the Greek as well as the Latin clergy. In the course of time the Norman princes gained the affection of their Greek subjects by respecting their rite, which had a strong support in the numerous [[Basilian monk|Basilian monasteries]] (in the 15th century there were still seven of them in the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Rossano-Cariati|Archdiocese of Rossano]] alone). The latinization of the dioceses was complete in the 16th century. Among those which held out longest for the Byzantine Rite were [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Acerenza|Acerenza]] (and perhaps [[Diocese of Gravina and Montepeloso|Gravina]]), 1302; [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Locri-Gerace|Gerace]], 1467; Oppido, 1472 (when it was temporarily united to Gerace); Rossano, 1460; [[Gallipoli#Ecclesiastical history|Gallipoli]], 1513; [[Diocese of Bova|Bova]] (to the time of [[Pope Gregory XIII|Gregory XIII]]), etc. But even after that time many Greek priests remained in some dioceses. In that of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Otranto|Otranto]], in 1583, there were still two hundred Greek priests, nearly all native. At [[Reggio Calabria|Reggio]], [[Calabria]], Count Ruggiero in 1092 had given the Greeks the church of S. Maria della Cattolica, whose clergy had a [[Protopope]], exempt from the jurisdiction of the bishop; this was the case until 1611. In 1695 there were in the same dioceses fifty-nine Greek priests; after thirty years there was only one. Rossano still had a Greek clergy in the 17th century. The few native Greek priests were afterwards absorbed in the tide of immigration (see below). Of the Basilian monasteries the only one left is that of Grottaferrata, near Rome. In [[Sicily]] the latinization was, for two reasons, accomplished more easily and radically. First, during the rule of the Muslim most of the dioceses were left without bishops, so that the installation of Latin bishops encountered no difficulty; secondly, the Normans had come as liberators, and not as conquerors.<ref name=ce/>\n\nImportant Greek colonies, founded chiefly for commercial reasons, were located at [[Venice]], [[Ancona]] (where they obtained from [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]] and [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]] the church of S. Anna, which they lost in 1833, having been declared schismatical in 1797), [[Bari]], [[Lecce]] (where, even in the 19th century, in the church of S. Nicola, Divine worship was carried on in the Greek tongue, though in the Roman Rite), [[Naples]] (where they have the church of SS. Pietro e Paolo, erected in 1526 by Tommaso Paleologo Assagni), [[Livorno|Leghorn]] (where they have the church of the Annunziata, 1607).<ref name=ce/>\n\nIn [[Rome]] there was always a large colony observing the Greek Rite. From the end of the 6th century until the ninth and tenth there were several Greek monasteries among which were [[San Saba, Rome|Cella Nova]], near S. Saba; S. Erasmo; [[San Silvestro in Capite]]; the monastery next to [[Santa Maria Antiqua]] at the foot of the Palatine. Like other nations, the Greeks before the year 1000 had their own [[Scholae|schola]] at Rome. It was near the church of [[Santa Maria in Cosmedin]]. Even in the pontifical liturgy - at least on some occasions - a few of the chanted passages were in Greek: the custom of singing the Epistle and Gospel in both Latin and Greek dates from that period.<ref name=ce/>\n\n=== Albanian influx ===\nBesides the first large emigration of [[Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb people|Albanians]] which took place between 1467 and 1470, after the death of the celebrated [[Scanderbeg|George Castriota Scanderbeg]] (when his daughter, who had become the Princess of [[Bisignano]], invited her countrymen to the [[Kingdom of Naples]]), there were two others, one under [[Ottoman Empire]] [[Sultan]] [[Selim II]] (1566\u20131574), directed to the ports along the [[Adriatic Sea]] and to [[Livorno]]; the other about 1740. In the course of time, owing to assimilation with the surrounding population, the number of these Italo-Greeks diminished, and not a few of their villages became entirely Latin.<ref name=ce/>\n\nTo educate the clergy of these Greeks, [[Pope Gregory XIII]] founded in 1577 at Rome the [[Roman Colleges#Collegio Greco|Greek College]] of [[Sant'Atanasio|St. Athanasius]], which served also for the Greek Catholics of the East and for the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ruthenians]], until a special college was instituted for the latter purpose by [[Pope Leo XIII]]. Among the alumni of St. Athanasius was the celebrated [[Leo Allatius]]. Another Greek-Byzantine ecclesiastical college was founded at [[Piana degli Albanesi]] in 1715 by P. Giorgio Guzzetta, founder of an Oratory of celibate Greek-Byzantine clergy. At [[Firmo]] the seminary of SS. Pietro e Paolo existed from 1663, erected by the [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples|Propaganda]] to supply priests for [[Albania]]. It was suppressed in 1746. Finally [[Pope Clement XII]], in 1736, founded the Corsini College in the ancient Abbey of [[San Benedetto Ullano]] in the charge of a resident bishop or archbishop of the Greek Rite. Later it was transferred in 1794 to [[San Demetrio Corone]], in the ancient [[Basilian monks|Basilian]] monastery of S. Adriano.

When [[Clement XII]] established the Corsini College at San Benedetto Ullano in 1736, he placed it in charge of a resident bishop or archbishop of the Greek Rite. [[Pope Benedict XIV]], in the [[papal Bull]] \"Etsi pastoralis\" (1742), collected, co-ordinated and completed the various enactments of his predecessors, and this Bull was still law in 1910, regulating the transfer of clergy and lay people between the communities of the Greek Church and Latin Church, and specifying that children of mixed marriages would be subject to the Latin Church.<ref name=ce/>\n\n=== ''Sui juris'' ===\nOn 6 February 1784, the pre-diocesan '''[[Ordinariate]] of the Albanians in Sicily''' was created, with Bishop Pap\u00e0s Giorgio Stassi, titular Bishop of Lampsacus, first holding that position.<ref name=Hora>{{cite web|title=Diocese of Piana degli Abanesi|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/pian0.htm|work=GCatholic.org|accessdate=27 December 2011}}</ref>\n \nBy 1909, another Ordinary for the Greeks of [[Calabria]] was residing at [[Naples]].<ref name=ce/>\n\nThe 20th century saw the foundation in 1919 of the [[Eparchy of Lungro]] (an Eastern Catholic bishopric) in [[Calabria]],<ref name=lun>{{cite web|title=Diocese of Lungro|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/lung0.htm|work=GCatholic.orgs|accessdate=27 December 2011}}</ref> which serves Byzantine-Rite Albanians in mainland Italy, and on 26 October 1937 of the [[Eparchy of Piana degli Albanesi|Eparchy of Piana dei Greci]] for those in Sicily promoted from the Ordinariate of Sicilia.<ref name=Hora/> One month before the foundation of the Eparchy of Piana dei Greci in 1937, the Byzantine-Rite [[#Territorial Abbacy of Saint Mary of Grottaferrata|Monastery of Saint Mary of Grottaferrata]], not far from [[Rome]], was given the status of a [[territorial abbacy]], separating it from the jurisdiction of the local bishop.<ref name=tasmg>{{cite web |title=Territorial Abbacy of Santa Maria di Grottaferrata |url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/zmar9.htm |work=GCatholic.orgs |accessdate=27 December 2011}}</ref> In October 1940, the three ordinaries held an inter-eparchial synod for preserving their Byzantine traditions and unity with an Orthodox Church of Albania observation delegation.<ref name=cewa1/> On 25 October 1941, the Eparchy of Piana dei Greci was renamed as the Eparchy of Piana degli Abanesi /Eparhia e Hor\u00ebs s\u00eb Arb\u00ebresh\u00ebvet.<ref name=Hora/>\n\nIn 2004 and 2005, a second inter-eparchial synod was held in three sessions approving 10 documents for \"the synod\u2019s theological and pastoral context, the use of Scripture, catechesis, liturgy, formation of clergy, canon law, ecumenical and interreligious relations, relations with other Eastern Catholic Churches, re-evangelization and mission.\" They were submitted to the Holy See and were still in dialogue as of mid-2007 in regards to their promulgation.<ref name=cnewa2>{{cite web|last=Roberson |first=Ronald G. |title=The Italo-Albanian Catholic Church.

It is the only one of the Italo-Greek monasteries that has survived. Most gradually fell into decadence and were taken by the Kingdom of Italy when it secularized religious orders in 1866. Only the Grottaferrata monastery, considered a national monument, was allowed to continue with the monks as its guardians. In the course of time, the civil authorities have allowed them increasing independence.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nIn 1880 the Holy See ordered the liturgy of the monastery to be purged of the Latin elements that had been introduced over the centuries. Vocations were no longer sought from the general Italian population, but instead chiefly among Italo-Albanians, and the monks set up new monasteries in Sicily and Calabria.\nOn 1 November 1571, the Italian Basilian Order of Grottaferrata was established.<ref>{{cite web|title=Italian Basilian Order of Grottaferrata|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/orders/152.htm|work=Religious Orders|publisher=GCatholic.org|accessdate=3 January 2012}}</ref> On 26 September 1937, the abbey was made a [[territorial abbacy]]).<ref name=tasmg/>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Albanian Byzantine Catholic Church]]\n*[[Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb people]]\n\n== Further reading ==\n* ''Oriente Cattolico'' (Vatican City: The Sacred Congregation for the Eastern Churches, 1974)\n* Fortescue, Adrian.

Church members are the descendants of the exiled [[Albanians]] who fled to Italy in the 15th century under the pressure of the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] persecutions in [[Albania]] and the territories inhabited by Albanians in the [[Balkans]] and the [[Peloponnese]]. The [[Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb people|Albanian population in Italy]] has maintained until today the [[Arb\u00ebresh language|language]], customs and religious [[Byzantine Rite|rites]] of their origin. This Church maintains their heritage, the ethnic, cultural and religious tradition of the Albanians fathers, keeping alive the spiritual and liturgical tradition of the [[Eastern Church]] from the time of [[Justinian]] (6th century).\n\n== Name ==\nThe [[Byzantine rite]] was brought to Italy in the 15th century by [[Albanians|Albanian]] exiles fleeing from [[Albania]], [[Epirus]] and [[Morea]] because of persecution by [[Ottoman Turks]] of [[Muslim]] faith. Italy had already known Eastern Christian rites in previous centuries, but had disappeared. The Albanians, Orthodox united in [[Rome]] with the [[Council of Ferrara-Florence]], brought with them language, customs, customs and belief, jealously keeping the Byzantine rite and naturally bridging between East and West (see Albanian missions in Albania in 1690-1769, contacts with Ohrid, Cretan Byzantine art and new missions of re-Christianization of Albania in 1900<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=y2EPFRL-XJQC&pg=PA75&lpg=PA75&dq=chiesa+italo+albanese&source=bl&ots=jfPjLZ_M-r&sig=z45vRAN4CwH_8REPcD3JHg3GnbI&hl=it&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwijuJrDqOvUAhVMJ8AKHZ-MASs4MhDoAQhJMAk#v=onepage&q=chiesa%20italo%20albanese&f=false  Ines Angjeli Murzak, Returning Home to Rome: The Basilian Monks of Grottaferrata in Albania, Grottaferrata 2009]</ref>).\n\nThe Italo-Albanian Catholic Church Is therefore characterized by a specific ethnic group: the [[Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb people|Albanians of Italy]], ''Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb'' or ''Italo-Albanesi''.\n\nThe only place where the Byzantine Rite remained in Italy was the Monastery of [[Grottaferrata]], an Italo-Greek foundation, which had become steadily [[liturgical Latinisation|latinized]] through the centuries. The Albanians of Sicily and Calabria, from the eighteenth to the present, were bringing the monastery back to life, where most of its monks, abbots and students were and are Italo-Albanian, began to once again flourish.<ref name=ce>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Italo-Greeks}}</ref>\n\nThe name \"Greek\" refers to the [[Byzantine Rite]] (as opposed to \"Latin\" [[Roman Rite]]) and not to an ethnic component.\n\n== History ==\n=== Byzantine period ===\nThe conquest of Italy by the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)]] began a Byzantine period that included the [[Byzantine Papacy|Byzantine domination of the Papacy]] from 537 to 752.\n\nIt is uncertain whether the Byzantine Rite was followed in any diocese of Southern Italy or Sicily before the 8th century. The spread of Greek monasticism in Italy received a strong impulse from the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] invasion of [[Muslim conquest of Syria|the Levant]] and [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt]], and later from the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|ban on religious images or icons]]. The monks naturally retained their rite, and as the bishops were not infrequently chosen from their number, the diocesan liturgy, under favourable conditions, could easily be changed, especially since the Lombard occupation of the inland regions of Southern Italy cut off the Greeks in the South from communication with the Latin Church.<ref name=\"ce\"/>\n\nWhen, in 726, [[Leo III the Isaurian]] withdrew Southern Italy from the [[Pentarchy|patriarchal jurisdiction]] of [[Diocese of Rome|Rome]] and gave it to the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], the process of hellenization became more rapid; it received a further impulse when, on account of the [[Muslim conquest of Sicily]], Greeks and Hellenized Sicilians fled to [[Calabria]] and [[Longobardia|Apulia]]. Still it was not rapid enough to suit the [[Byzantine emperor]]s, who feared lest those regions should again fall under the influence of the West, like the [[Duchy of Rome]] and the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]]. Finally, after the [[Ottonian dynasty|Saxon emperors]] had made a formidable attempt to drive the Greeks from the peninsula, Emperor [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] and the Patriarch [[Polyeuctus of Constantinople|Polyeuctus]] made it obligatory on the bishops, in 968, to adopt the Byzantine Rite. This order aroused lively opposition in some quarters, as at [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bari-Bitonto|Bari]], under Bishop Giovanni. Nor was it executed in other places immediately and universally. Cassano and [[Taranto]], for instance, are said to have always maintained the Roman Rite. At [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Trani-Barletta-Bisceglie|Trani]], in 983, Bishop Rodostamo was allowed to retain the Roman Rite, as a reward for aiding in the surrender of the city to the Greeks. In every diocese there were always some churches which never forsook the Roman Rite; on the other hand, long after the restoration of that rite, there remained Greek churches with native Greek clergy.<ref name=ce/>\n\n=== Re-Latinization ===\nThe restoration of the Roman Rite began with the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Norman conquest]] in the 11th century, especially in the first period of the conquest, when [[Normans|Norman]] ecclesiastics were appointed bishops. Another potent factor was the reform of [[Pope Gregory VII]], who in his efforts to [[Gregorian Reform|repress marriage]] among the Latin clergy found no small obstacle in the example of the Greek priests. However, he and his successors recognized the Byzantine Rite and discipline wherever it was in legitimate possession. Moreover, the Latin bishops ordained the Greek as well as the Latin clergy. In the course of time the Norman princes gained the affection of their Greek subjects by respecting their rite, which had a strong support in the numerous [[Basilian monk|Basilian monasteries]] (in the 15th century there were still seven of them in the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Rossano-Cariati|Archdiocese of Rossano]] alone). The latinization of the dioceses was complete in the 16th century. Among those which held out longest for the Byzantine Rite were [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Acerenza|Acerenza]] (and perhaps [[Diocese of Gravina and Montepeloso|Gravina]]), 1302; [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Locri-Gerace|Gerace]], 1467; Oppido, 1472 (when it was temporarily united to Gerace); Rossano, 1460; [[Gallipoli#Ecclesiastical history|Gallipoli]], 1513; [[Diocese of Bova|Bova]] (to the time of [[Pope Gregory XIII|Gregory XIII]]), etc. But even after that time many Greek priests remained in some dioceses. In that of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Otranto|Otranto]], in 1583, there were still two hundred Greek priests, nearly all native. At [[Reggio Calabria|Reggio]], [[Calabria]], Count Ruggiero in 1092 had given the Greeks the church of S. Maria della Cattolica, whose clergy had a [[Protopope]], exempt from the jurisdiction of the bishop; this was the case until 1611. In 1695 there were in the same dioceses fifty-nine Greek priests; after thirty years there was only one. Rossano still had a Greek clergy in the 17th century. The few native Greek priests were afterwards absorbed in the tide of immigration (see below). Of the Basilian monasteries the only one left is that of Grottaferrata, near Rome. In [[Sicily]] the latinization was, for two reasons, accomplished more easily and radically. First, during the rule of the Muslim most of the dioceses were left without bishops, so that the installation of Latin bishops encountered no difficulty; secondly, the Normans had come as liberators, and not as conquerors.<ref name=ce/>\n\nImportant Greek colonies, founded chiefly for commercial reasons, were located at [[Venice]], [[Ancona]] (where they obtained from [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]] and [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]] the church of S. Anna, which they lost in 1833, having been declared schismatical in 1797), [[Bari]], [[Lecce]] (where, even in the 19th century, in the church of S. Nicola, Divine worship was carried on in the Greek tongue, though in the Roman Rite), [[Naples]] (where they have the church of SS. Pietro e Paolo, erected in 1526 by Tommaso Paleologo Assagni), [[Livorno|Leghorn]] (where they have the church of the Annunziata, 1607).<ref name=ce/>\n\nIn [[Rome]] there was always a large colony observing the Greek Rite. From the end of the 6th century until the ninth and tenth there were several Greek monasteries among which were [[San Saba, Rome|Cella Nova]], near S. Saba; S. Erasmo; [[San Silvestro in Capite]]; the monastery next to [[Santa Maria Antiqua]] at the foot of the Palatine. Like other nations, the Greeks before the year 1000 had their own [[Scholae|schola]] at Rome. It was near the church of [[Santa Maria in Cosmedin]]. Even in the pontifical liturgy - at least on some occasions - a few of the chanted passages were in Greek: the custom of singing the Epistle and Gospel in both Latin and Greek dates from that period.<ref name=ce/>\n\n=== Albanian influx ===\nBesides the first large emigration of [[Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb people|Albanians]] which took place between 1467 and 1470, after the death of the celebrated [[Scanderbeg|George Castriota Scanderbeg]] (when his daughter, who had become the Princess of [[Bisignano]], invited her countrymen to the [[Kingdom of Naples]]), there were two others, one under [[Ottoman Empire]] [[Sultan]] [[Selim II]] (1566\u20131574), directed to the ports along the [[Adriatic Sea]] and to [[Livorno]]; the other about 1740. In the course of time, owing to assimilation with the surrounding population, the number of these Italo-Greeks diminished, and not a few of their villages became entirely Latin.<ref name=ce/>\n\nTo educate the clergy of these Greeks, [[Pope Gregory XIII]] founded in 1577 at Rome the [[Roman Colleges#Collegio Greco|Greek College]] of [[Sant'Atanasio|St. Athanasius]], which served also for the Greek Catholics of the East and for the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ruthenians]], until a special college was instituted for the latter purpose by [[Pope Leo XIII]]. Among the alumni of St. Athanasius was the celebrated [[Leo Allatius]]. Another Greek-Byzantine ecclesiastical college was founded at [[Piana degli Albanesi]] in 1715 by P. Giorgio Guzzetta, founder of an Oratory of celibate Greek-Byzantine clergy. At [[Firmo]] the seminary of SS. Pietro e Paolo existed from 1663, erected by the [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples|Propaganda]] to supply priests for [[Albania]]. It was suppressed in 1746. Finally [[Pope Clement XII]], in 1736, founded the Corsini College in the ancient Abbey of [[San Benedetto Ullano]] in the charge of a resident bishop or archbishop of the Greek Rite. Later it was transferred in 1794 to [[San Demetrio Corone]], in the ancient [[Basilian monks|Basilian]] monastery of S. Adriano. Since 1849, however, and especially since 1860, this college has lost its ecclesiastical character and is now secularized.<ref name=ce/>\n\n[[Seminary|Seminaries]] for the Albanians of Italy were set up in [[San Benedetto Ullano]], and then in [[San Demetrio Corone]], ([[Calabria]]) in 1732 and in [[Palermo]], [[Sicily]], in 1734.<ref name=cewa1>{{cite web|last=Roberson|first=Ronald G.|title=The Italo-Albanian Catholic Church.

However, the popes at times appointed a [[titular archbishop]], resident in Rome, for the ordination of their priests. When [[Clement XII]] established the Corsini College at San Benedetto Ullano in 1736, he placed it in charge of a resident bishop or archbishop of the Greek Rite. [[Pope Benedict XIV]], in the [[papal Bull]] \"Etsi pastoralis\" (1742), collected, co-ordinated and completed the various enactments of his predecessors, and this Bull was still law in 1910, regulating the transfer of clergy and lay people between the communities of the Greek Church and Latin Church, and specifying that children of mixed marriages would be subject to the Latin Church.<ref name=ce/>\n\n=== ''Sui juris'' ===\nOn 6 February 1784, the pre-diocesan '''[[Ordinariate]] of the Albanians in Sicily''' was created, with Bishop Pap\u00e0s Giorgio Stassi, titular Bishop of Lampsacus, first holding that position.<ref name=Hora>{{cite web|title=Diocese of Piana degli Abanesi|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/pian0.htm|work=GCatholic.org|accessdate=27 December 2011}}</ref>\n \nBy 1909, another Ordinary for the Greeks of [[Calabria]] was residing at [[Naples]].<ref name=ce/>\n\nThe 20th century saw the foundation in 1919 of the [[Eparchy of Lungro]] (an Eastern Catholic bishopric) in [[Calabria]],<ref name=lun>{{cite web|title=Diocese of Lungro|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/lung0.htm|work=GCatholic.orgs|accessdate=27 December 2011}}</ref> which serves Byzantine-Rite Albanians in mainland Italy, and on 26 October 1937 of the [[Eparchy of Piana degli Albanesi|Eparchy of Piana dei Greci]] for those in Sicily promoted from the Ordinariate of Sicilia.<ref name=Hora/> One month before the foundation of the Eparchy of Piana dei Greci in 1937, the Byzantine-Rite [[#Territorial Abbacy of Saint Mary of Grottaferrata|Monastery of Saint Mary of Grottaferrata]], not far from [[Rome]], was given the status of a [[territorial abbacy]], separating it from the jurisdiction of the local bishop.<ref name=tasmg>{{cite web |title=Territorial Abbacy of Santa Maria di Grottaferrata |url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/zmar9.htm |work=GCatholic.orgs |accessdate=27 December 2011}}</ref> In October 1940, the three ordinaries held an inter-eparchial synod for preserving their Byzantine traditions and unity with an Orthodox Church of Albania observation delegation.<ref name=cewa1/> On 25 October 1941, the Eparchy of Piana dei Greci was renamed as the Eparchy of Piana degli Abanesi /Eparhia e Hor\u00ebs s\u00eb Arb\u00ebresh\u00ebvet.<ref name=Hora/>\n\nIn 2004 and 2005, a second inter-eparchial synod was held in three sessions approving 10 documents for \"the synod\u2019s theological and pastoral context, the use of Scripture, catechesis, liturgy, formation of clergy, canon law, ecumenical and interreligious relations, relations with other Eastern Catholic Churches, re-evangelization and mission.\" They were submitted to the Holy See and were still in dialogue as of mid-2007 in regards to their promulgation.<ref name=cnewa2>{{cite web|last=Roberson |first=Ronald G. |title=The Italo-Albanian Catholic Church.

In the course of time, the civil authorities have allowed them increasing independence.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nIn 1880 the Holy See ordered the liturgy of the monastery to be purged of the Latin elements that had been introduced over the centuries.
