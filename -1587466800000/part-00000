On 2 May 2009 he established himself in the Leinster first team, replacing the injured [[Argentine]] fly-half [[Felipe Contepomi]] as an early substitute in the [[Heineken Cup]] semi-final to help Leinster beat rivals [[Munster Rugby|Munster]] a convincing 25\u20136. He then started in Leinster's home match against the [[Scarlets]] in the Celtic League, scoring 15 points (including a try) in a man of the match performance.\n[[File:Jonathan Sexton.JPG|thumb|Sexton in action during the 2011 Heineken Cup Quarter final versus the [[Leicester Tigers]].]]\n\nContepomi's cruciate ligament injury ruled him out for the rest of Leinster's campaign; he signed for French giants [[Stade Francais]] the following season. Sexton started the [[2009 Heineken Cup Final]] against [[Leicester Tigers]], and kicked a spectacular drop goal from the halfway line and also kicked the winning penalty (a total of 11 points, 2 penalties, 1 drop goal and 1 conversion).

The following week in their pool decider, Sexton scored a drop goal in the dying minutes against [[London Irish]] at [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]] to even up the score at eleven all. This secured Leinster a home advantage in the Heineken Cup quarter finals and knocked the Exiles out of the competition. Sexton's ability was highlighted on his return from injury in the 2010/11 season, where he helped Leinster recover from a shaky start to the season as a second-half substitute in their win over Munster in the Celtic League. Following this victory, he helped Leinster win over [[Racing M\u00e9tro 92|Racing Metro]] and [[Saracens F.C.|Saracens]] in the Heineken Cup. In the second match, he received a man of the match award after scoring 25 points, including a try, giving his team the top spot in a pool regarded as one of the most competitive in Heineken Cup history. A poll taken by planetrugby.com following these performances suggested that Sexton was currently regarded as the top fly-half in Europe.\n\n===2005\u201308===\n\nSexton began his [[Leinster Rugby]] career playing one game in the 2005\u201306 season, as a result of his performances for St. Mary's.

Although he only played 12 minutes against [[Ospreys (rugby union)|Ospreys]], he scored a conversion. He went on to kick three penalties in his other games, which were against [[Ulster Rugby]] and [[Munster Rugby]]. In all, that season he scored 11 points in only 143 minutes play.\n\nIn the 2007\u201308 season, Sexton started against [[Edinburgh Rugby]] and scored one try, one conversion and two penalties. He scored his second try of the season against [[Cardiff Blues]], in which game he scored a further two conversions and two penalties. He followed that up by scoring a conversion and two penalties against the [[Scarlets]]. He ended 2007 scoring a further 23 points against Ulster Rugby and [[Glasgow Warriors]]. He then finished off the season with 14 points in his games against Munster Rugby and [[Dragons (rugby union)|Newport Gwent Dragons]]. Overall, he scored 73 points during 2007\u201308.\n\n===2008\u201310===\nAt the start of the season, Sexton played seven matches against [[Cardiff Blues]], Edinburgh Rugby and Munster Rugby in September. In October, he played against [[Connacht Rugby]], Edinburgh Rugby, [[Wasps RFC|London Wasps]] and Glasgow Warriors. He finished the season on a high, scoring 64 points after November. He got a call up to the Ireland team for the 2008 Six Nations but was ruled out by injury.\n\nSexton played against Scarlets, Dragons, Ospreys, Edinburgh, Munster, London Irish, Brive, Ulster and Cardiff before being called up to the Ireland team for a match against [[Fiji]]. He scored five conversions and two penalties in that match. He then played against South Africa, scoring five penalties.

He scored two tries as Leinster won the [[Heineken Cup]] after trailing 22\u20136 at half time to win the match 33\u201322. Leinster then had the chance to add a second trophy by winning the [[Pro14|Pro12]]. However, Munster beat them 19\u20139 in the final, with Sexton kicking three penalties.\n\nDuring Leinster's 2011 Heineken Cup final against the [[Northampton Saints]], Sexton scored 28 points including 2 tries in a historic comeback, when Leinster beat Northampton 33\u201322 at the Millennium Stadium after falling 22\u20136 down at halftime. Sexton won the man of the match award and his second Heineken Cup medal. His 28 points in that match makes him the second-highest scorer in one game in Heineken Cup history. Sexton stated that his career-defining performance was dedicated to his late grandfather, John Sexton \u2013 the hugely popular [[Listowel]] businessman who had died a few months earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kerryman.ie/news/listowel-has-a-heros-welcome-for-sexton-2657107.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120804113200/http://www.kerryman.ie/news/listowel-has-a-heros-welcome-for-sexton-2657107.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 August 2012 |title=Listowel has a hero's welcome |date=25 May 2011 |work=kerryman.ie |accessdate=12 April 2012 }}</ref> However, Sexton and Leinster could not snatch the first Heineken Cup and Celtic League double that season, with the club losing to [[Munster Rugby|Munster]] in the 2011 Celtic League Final.\n\n===2011\u201312===\nSexton played 16 games for Leinster in 2011\u201312, scoring a try, 29 conversions, 3 drop goals and 4 penalties.

He started in all five matches in the six nations.\n\nIn May 2012, Irish heavyweights Leinster and Sexton achieved their third Heineken Cup triumph in four seasons against Irish rivals [[Ulster Rugby|Ulster]] as they established themselves as true giants of the European game. First-half tries by flanker [[Se\u00e1n O'Brien (rugby union, born 1987)|Se\u00e1n O'Brien]] and prop [[Cian Healy]] put Leinster on the way towards a record-breaking triumph. Leinster's reign as Heineken Cup holders was never seriously threatened in front of almost 82,000 spectators at [[Twickenham]]. Jonathan Sexton kicked three conversions and three penalties for a 15-point haul as Leinster became the first team since [[Leicester Tigers]] in 2002 to successfully defend the Heineken Cup. When replacement prop [[Heinke van der Merwe]] and [[Se\u00e1n Cronin (rugby union)|Se\u00e1n Cronin]] scored near full-time, it gave Leinster the biggest ever winning margin in a Heineken Cup final, Leinster 42\u201314 Ulster.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/heineken-cup/2012/0519/321612-leinster-42-14-ulster/|title=Leinster Retain Heineken Cup|date=20 May 2012|work=rte.ie|accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===2012\u201313===\nThe 2012\u201313 season proved successful for Sexton as he helped Leinster win their first Pro 12 title since the Celtic league, having been runners up the previous three seasons. Despite the disappointment of failing to gain access to the knockout stages of the Heineken cup that year, Sexton helped Leinster win their first Amlin Challenge Cup, a third European title in three years. He spent a portion of the season sidelined due to injury, allowing his understudy Ian Madigan to take the hot seat at outside half.\n\nIt was announced that Sexton would leave Leinster at the end of the season to join Racing Metro, as he had failed to agree terms with the IRFU, despite his outspoken intent to remain in the blue jersey for the remainder of his career. In January 2013, Sexton informed the [[IRFU]] that he would not be renewing his contract with Leinster.

The reports were then confirmed by Sexton and Racing Metro after talks with the IRFU over a new contract had broken down. Sexton joined fellow British & Irish Lions teammates [[Jamie Roberts]] and [[Dan Lydiate]] as the club's marquee signings for the 2013\u201314 season, while his former adversary for the Irish 10 jersey [[Ronan O'Gara]] was confirmed as a coach for the club. Sexton stated that he had been unaware of O'Gara's arrival, but was happy at the news as both men had developed a good working friendship in their later years together in the Ireland set-up, despite a reportedly fractious early relationship during Sexton's emergence.\n\nSexton's departure came as a surprise to many in Ireland, as he had been a key player for both Leinster and Ireland in the preceding years, and had stated his intention to remain at the club. He cited the Parisian club's ambitious new project and impressive training facilities as factors in choosing them over traditionally more successful European clubs outside Ireland.\n\nIn Sexton's first year as a non-Leinster player, Racing Metro struggled to impose itself as a force in Europe, as they failed to qualify from the group stages of the Heineken Cup.\n\n==Return to Leinster (2015\u2013present)==\nFollowing speculation during the summer of 2014, Sexton announced in September 2014 that he had signed a contract to bring him back to Leinster for the 2015\u201316 season until at least November 2019.<ref name=It-Return01>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/johnny-sexton-confirms-leinster-return-1.1917939|title=Johnny Sexton confirms Leinster return|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn his return season at Leinster, 2015\u201316, Sexton appeared 16 times for Leinster, scoring 2 tries and 103 total points.

His performances at St. Mary's led to Sexton being selected for [[Leinster Rugby|Leinster]]. He made his debut against Border Reivers in 2006.\n\nSexton holds a [[Bachelor of Commerce]] degree from [[University College Dublin]].\n\n==Leinster==\nSexton was part of Leinster's [[Pro14|Celtic League]] winning side in 2007\u201308. On 2 May 2009 he established himself in the Leinster first team, replacing the injured [[Argentine]] fly-half [[Felipe Contepomi]] as an early substitute in the [[Heineken Cup]] semi-final to help Leinster beat rivals [[Munster Rugby|Munster]] a convincing 25\u20136. He then started in Leinster's home match against the [[Scarlets]] in the Celtic League, scoring 15 points (including a try) in a man of the match performance.\n[[File:Jonathan Sexton.JPG|thumb|Sexton in action during the 2011 Heineken Cup Quarter final versus the [[Leicester Tigers]].]]\n\nContepomi's cruciate ligament injury ruled him out for the rest of Leinster's campaign; he signed for French giants [[Stade Francais]] the following season. Sexton started the [[2009 Heineken Cup Final]] against [[Leicester Tigers]], and kicked a spectacular drop goal from the halfway line and also kicked the winning penalty (a total of 11 points, 2 penalties, 1 drop goal and 1 conversion). Leinster went on to win their first European Cup 16\u201319 at [[Murrayfield Stadium|Murrayfield]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ercrugby.com/eng/12818_12682.php |title=Leicester 16 Leinster 19 |date=23 May 2009 |work=ercrugby.com |accessdate=17 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027030606/http://www.ercrugby.com/eng/12818_12682.php |archivedate=27 October 2009 }}</ref>\n\nUpon recovering from a hand injury sustained during the Ireland [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] autumn international fixture in 2009, Sexton helped Leinster to secure a bonus point win over [[CA Brive|Brive]] in the Heineken Cup to take command of their pool. The following week in their pool decider, Sexton scored a drop goal in the dying minutes against [[London Irish]] at [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]] to even up the score at eleven all. This secured Leinster a home advantage in the Heineken Cup quarter finals and knocked the Exiles out of the competition. Sexton's ability was highlighted on his return from injury in the 2010/11 season, where he helped Leinster recover from a shaky start to the season as a second-half substitute in their win over Munster in the Celtic League. Following this victory, he helped Leinster win over [[Racing M\u00e9tro 92|Racing Metro]] and [[Saracens F.C.|Saracens]] in the Heineken Cup. In the second match, he received a man of the match award after scoring 25 points, including a try, giving his team the top spot in a pool regarded as one of the most competitive in Heineken Cup history. A poll taken by planetrugby.com following these performances suggested that Sexton was currently regarded as the top fly-half in Europe.\n\n===2005\u201308===\n\nSexton began his [[Leinster Rugby]] career playing one game in the 2005\u201306 season, as a result of his performances for St. Mary's. He came on as a substitute against the [[Border Reivers (rugby)|Border Reivers]].\n\nSexton played three games in the 2006\u201307 season. Although he only played 12 minutes against [[Ospreys (rugby union)|Ospreys]], he scored a conversion. He went on to kick three penalties in his other games, which were against [[Ulster Rugby]] and [[Munster Rugby]]. In all, that season he scored 11 points in only 143 minutes play.\n\nIn the 2007\u201308 season, Sexton started against [[Edinburgh Rugby]] and scored one try, one conversion and two penalties. He scored his second try of the season against [[Cardiff Blues]], in which game he scored a further two conversions and two penalties. He followed that up by scoring a conversion and two penalties against the [[Scarlets]]. He ended 2007 scoring a further 23 points against Ulster Rugby and [[Glasgow Warriors]]. He then finished off the season with 14 points in his games against Munster Rugby and [[Dragons (rugby union)|Newport Gwent Dragons]]. Overall, he scored 73 points during 2007\u201308.\n\n===2008\u201310===\nAt the start of the season, Sexton played seven matches against [[Cardiff Blues]], Edinburgh Rugby and Munster Rugby in September. In October, he played against [[Connacht Rugby]], Edinburgh Rugby, [[Wasps RFC|London Wasps]] and Glasgow Warriors. He finished the season on a high, scoring 64 points after November. He got a call up to the Ireland team for the 2008 Six Nations but was ruled out by injury.\n\nSexton played against Scarlets, Dragons, Ospreys, Edinburgh, Munster, London Irish, Brive, Ulster and Cardiff before being called up to the Ireland team for a match against [[Fiji]]. He scored five conversions and two penalties in that match. He then played against South Africa, scoring five penalties. In 2010, Sexton played six games for Ireland, scoring 37 points in matches against England, Wales, Scotland, New Zealand and Australia.\n\n===2010\u201311===\nSexton played 19 times for Leinster that season, scoring 237 points. He scored two tries as Leinster won the [[Heineken Cup]] after trailing 22\u20136 at half time to win the match 33\u201322. Leinster then had the chance to add a second trophy by winning the [[Pro14|Pro12]]. However, Munster beat them 19\u20139 in the final, with Sexton kicking three penalties.\n\nDuring Leinster's 2011 Heineken Cup final against the [[Northampton Saints]], Sexton scored 28 points including 2 tries in a historic comeback, when Leinster beat Northampton 33\u201322 at the Millennium Stadium after falling 22\u20136 down at halftime. Sexton won the man of the match award and his second Heineken Cup medal. His 28 points in that match makes him the second-highest scorer in one game in Heineken Cup history. Sexton stated that his career-defining performance was dedicated to his late grandfather, John Sexton \u2013 the hugely popular [[Listowel]] businessman who had died a few months earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kerryman.ie/news/listowel-has-a-heros-welcome-for-sexton-2657107.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120804113200/http://www.kerryman.ie/news/listowel-has-a-heros-welcome-for-sexton-2657107.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 August 2012 |title=Listowel has a hero's welcome |date=25 May 2011 |work=kerryman.ie |accessdate=12 April 2012 }}</ref> However, Sexton and Leinster could not snatch the first Heineken Cup and Celtic League double that season, with the club losing to [[Munster Rugby|Munster]] in the 2011 Celtic League Final.\n\n===2011\u201312===\nSexton played 16 games for Leinster in 2011\u201312, scoring a try, 29 conversions, 3 drop goals and 4 penalties. He totalled 213 points overall. He won the Heineken cup with Leinster that year and came runners up in the RaboDirect pro 12, losing to Ospreys in the final. He started in all five matches in the six nations.\n\nIn May 2012, Irish heavyweights Leinster and Sexton achieved their third Heineken Cup triumph in four seasons against Irish rivals [[Ulster Rugby|Ulster]] as they established themselves as true giants of the European game. First-half tries by flanker [[Se\u00e1n O'Brien (rugby union, born 1987)|Se\u00e1n O'Brien]] and prop [[Cian Healy]] put Leinster on the way towards a record-breaking triumph. Leinster's reign as Heineken Cup holders was never seriously threatened in front of almost 82,000 spectators at [[Twickenham]]. Jonathan Sexton kicked three conversions and three penalties for a 15-point haul as Leinster became the first team since [[Leicester Tigers]] in 2002 to successfully defend the Heineken Cup. When replacement prop [[Heinke van der Merwe]] and [[Se\u00e1n Cronin (rugby union)|Se\u00e1n Cronin]] scored near full-time, it gave Leinster the biggest ever winning margin in a Heineken Cup final, Leinster 42\u201314 Ulster.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/heineken-cup/2012/0519/321612-leinster-42-14-ulster/|title=Leinster Retain Heineken Cup|date=20 May 2012|work=rte.ie|accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===2012\u201313===\nThe 2012\u201313 season proved successful for Sexton as he helped Leinster win their first Pro 12 title since the Celtic league, having been runners up the previous three seasons. Despite the disappointment of failing to gain access to the knockout stages of the Heineken cup that year, Sexton helped Leinster win their first Amlin Challenge Cup, a third European title in three years. He spent a portion of the season sidelined due to injury, allowing his understudy Ian Madigan to take the hot seat at outside half.\n\nIt was announced that Sexton would leave Leinster at the end of the season to join Racing Metro, as he had failed to agree terms with the IRFU, despite his outspoken intent to remain in the blue jersey for the remainder of his career. In January 2013, Sexton informed the [[IRFU]] that he would not be renewing his contract with Leinster.

The reports were then confirmed by Sexton and Racing Metro after talks with the IRFU over a new contract had broken down. Sexton joined fellow British & Irish Lions teammates [[Jamie Roberts]] and [[Dan Lydiate]] as the club's marquee signings for the 2013\u201314 season, while his former adversary for the Irish 10 jersey [[Ronan O'Gara]] was confirmed as a coach for the club. Sexton stated that he had been unaware of O'Gara's arrival, but was happy at the news as both men had developed a good working friendship in their later years together in the Ireland set-up, despite a reportedly fractious early relationship during Sexton's emergence.\n\nSexton's departure came as a surprise to many in Ireland, as he had been a key player for both Leinster and Ireland in the preceding years, and had stated his intention to remain at the club. He cited the Parisian club's ambitious new project and impressive training facilities as factors in choosing them over traditionally more successful European clubs outside Ireland.\n\nIn Sexton's first year as a non-Leinster player, Racing Metro struggled to impose itself as a force in Europe, as they failed to qualify from the group stages of the Heineken Cup.\n\n==Return to Leinster (2015\u2013present)==\nFollowing speculation during the summer of 2014, Sexton announced in September 2014 that he had signed a contract to bring him back to Leinster for the 2015\u201316 season until at least November 2019.<ref name=It-Return01>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/johnny-sexton-confirms-leinster-return-1.1917939|title=Johnny Sexton confirms Leinster return|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn his return season at Leinster, 2015\u201316, Sexton appeared 16 times for Leinster, scoring 2 tries and 103 total points.

Pinkerton, an expert in human geography at the Royal Holloway University of London, the term is first mentioned in ''[[Domesday Book]]'' in the 11th century, to describe parcels of land that were just

ropes, tackle, block, and other supplies were stored.<ref name=\"Hendrickson, Robert 2008\">Hendrickson, Robert ''Facts on File Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins'' (2008)</ref> In the United

most frequently at the start of the war to describe the area between the [[Trench warfare|trench lines]] included 'between the trenches' or 'between the lines'.<ref name=\"WFA\"/> The term 'no man's land' was first used in a military context by soldier and historian [[Ernest Swinton]] in his short story \"The Point of View\".<ref name=\"Persico 68\"/> Swinton used the term in war correspondence on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], with specific mention of the terms with respect to the [[Race to the Sea]] in late 1914.<ref name=\"WFA\"/> The Anglo-German [[Christmas truce|Christmas truce of 1914]] brought the term into common use, and thereafter it appeared frequently in official communiqu\u00e9s, newspaper reports, and personnel correspondences of the members of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]].<ref name=\"WFA\"/>\n\nIn World War I, no man's land often ranged from several hundred yards to in some cases less than 10 yards.<ref name=\"Hamilton\">{{citation |first=John|last=Hamilton|title=Trench Fighting of World War I|publisher=ABDO|year=2003|page=8|isbn=1-57765-916-3}}</ref>  Heavily defended by machine guns, mortars, artillery, and riflemen on both sides, it was often extensively cratered, and was riddled with [[barbed wire]], rudimentary improvised [[land mine]]s, as well as corpses and wounded soldiers who were unable to make it through the hail of bullets, explosions, and flames. The area was sometimes contaminated by [[chemical weapon]]s.  It was open to fire from the opposing trenches and hard going generally slowed down any attempted advance.  \n\nNot only were [[soldier]]s forced to cross no man's land when advancing, and as the case might be when retreating, but after an attack the [[casualty movement|stretcher bearer]]s had to enter it to bring in the wounded.  No man's land remained a regular feature of the battlefield until near the end of World War I, when mechanised weapons (i.e., tanks) made entrenched lines less of an obstacle.\n\nEffects from World War I no man's lands persist today, for example at [[Verdun]] in France, where the ''[[Zone Rouge]]'' (Red Zone) contains [[unexploded ordnance]], and is poisoned beyond habitation by [[arsenic]], [[chlorine]], and [[phosgene]]. The zone is sealed off completely and still deemed too dangerous for civilians to return: \"The area is still considered to be very poisoned, so the French government planted an enormous forest of black pines, like a living [[sarcophagus]]\", comments Alasdair Pinkerton, a researcher at [[Royal Holloway University of London]], who compared the zone to the [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone|nuclear disaster site at Chernobyl]], similarly encased in a \"concrete sarcophagus\".<ref name=\"bbc.com_2015-09-30\"/>\n\n=== Cold War ===\nDuring the [[Cold War]], one example of \"no man's land\" was the territory close to the [[Iron Curtain]]. Officially the territory belonged to the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, but over the entire Iron Curtain there were several wide tracts of uninhabited land, several hundred meters in width, containing watch towers, minefields, unexploded bombs, and other such debris. Would-be escapees from Eastern Bloc countries who successfully scaled the border fortifications could still be apprehended or shot by border guards in the zone.\n\nThe [[United States Navy|U.S. Naval]] Base at [[Guant\u00e1namo Bay]], Cuba is separated from [[Cuba]] proper by an area called the [[Cactus Curtain]]. In late 1961, Cuba had its troops plant an {{convert|8|mi|km|adj=on}} barrier of ''[[Opuntia]]'' cactus along the northeastern section of the {{convert|28|km|adj=on}} fence surrounding the base to prevent economic migrants fleeing from Cuba from resettling in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.american.edu/TED/guantan.htm |title=Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and Ecological Crises |work=Trade and Environment Database |publisher=[[American University]] |accessdate=2009-04-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327053019/http://www.american.edu/TED/guantan.htm |archivedate=2009-03-27 }}</ref> This was dubbed the \"Cactus Curtain\", an allusion to [[Europe]]'s [[Iron Curtain]]<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,940656,00.html |title=Yankees Besieged |journal=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |date=1962-03-16 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828155348/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,940656,00.html |archivedate=2010-08-28 }}</ref> and the [[Bamboo Curtain]] in [[East Asia]].

The term was originally used to define a contested territory or a dumping ground for refuse between [[fief|fiefdoms]].<ref name=\"Persico 68\"/> In modern times it is commonly associated with [[World War I]] to describe the area of land between two enemy [[Trench warfare|trench systems]], which neither side wished to cross nor seize due to fear of being attacked by the enemy in the process.<ref name=\"Coleman\">[[#Reference-Coleman|Coleman]] p. 268</ref> The term is also used to refer to ambiguity, an anomalous, or indefinite area, in regards to an application, situation,<ref>{{Cite

Pinkerton, an expert in human geography at the Royal Holloway University of London, the term is first mentioned in ''[[Domesday Book]]'' in the 11th century, to describe parcels of land that were just beyond the London city walls.<ref name=\"bbc.com_2015-09-30\">{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34319540| title=Adventures in No Man's Land |work= BBC News| accessdate=30 September

contains a reference to the term dating back to 1320, spelled ''nonesmanneslond'', to describe a territory that was disputed or involved in a legal disagreement.<ref name=\"Persico 68\">[[#Reference-Persico|Persico]] p. 68</ref><ref name=\"Levenback 95\">[[#Reference-Levenback|Levenback]] p. 95</ref> The same term was later used as the name for the piece of land outside the north wall of [[London]] that was assigned as the place of execution.<ref name=\"Levenback 95\"/> The term was also applied to a little-used area on ships called the [[forecastle]], where various ropes, tackle, block, and other supplies were stored.<ref name=\"Hendrickson, Robert 2008\">Hendrickson, Robert ''Facts on File Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins'' (2008)</ref> In the United Kingdom, several places called No Man's Land denoted \"extra-parochial spaces that were beyond the rule of the church, beyond the rule of different fiefdoms that were handed out by the king \u2026

stretch of no man's land at [[Flanders Fields]], [[Belgium]], 1919]]\n\nThe [[British Army]] did not widely employ the term when the [[Regular Army]] arrived in France in August 1914, soon after the outbreak of the [[World War I|Great War]].<ref name=\"WFA\">{{cite web |first=David |last=Payne |title=No Man's Land |publisher=Western Front Association |date=8 July 2008 |accessdate=20 November 2009

most frequently at the start of the war to describe the area between the [[Trench warfare|trench lines]] included 'between the trenches' or 'between the lines'.<ref name=\"WFA\"/> The term 'no man's land' was first used in a military context by soldier and historian [[Ernest Swinton]] in his short story \"The Point of View\".<ref name=\"Persico 68\"/> Swinton used the term in war correspondence on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], with specific mention of the terms with respect to the [[Race to the Sea]] in late 1914.<ref name=\"WFA\"/> The Anglo-German [[Christmas truce|Christmas truce of 1914]] brought the term into common use, and thereafter it appeared frequently in official communiqu\u00e9s, newspaper reports, and personnel correspondences of the members of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]].<ref name=\"WFA\"/>\n\nIn World War I, no man's land often ranged from several hundred yards to in some cases less than 10 yards.<ref name=\"Hamilton\">{{citation |first=John|last=Hamilton|title=Trench Fighting of World War I|publisher=ABDO|year=2003|page=8|isbn=1-57765-916-3}}</ref>  Heavily defended by machine guns, mortars, artillery, and riflemen on both sides, it was often extensively cratered, and was riddled with [[barbed wire]], rudimentary improvised [[land mine]]s, as well as corpses and wounded soldiers who were unable to make it through the hail of bullets, explosions, and flames. The area was sometimes contaminated by [[chemical weapon]]s.  It was open to fire from the opposing trenches and hard going generally slowed down any attempted advance.  \n\nNot only were [[soldier]]s forced to cross no man's land when advancing, and as the case might be when retreating, but after an attack the [[casualty movement|stretcher bearer]]s had to enter it to bring in the wounded.  No man's land remained a regular feature of the battlefield until near the end of World War I, when mechanised weapons (i.e., tanks) made entrenched lines less of an obstacle.\n\nEffects from World War I no man's lands persist today, for example at [[Verdun]] in France, where the ''[[Zone Rouge]]'' (Red Zone) contains [[unexploded ordnance]], and is poisoned beyond habitation by [[arsenic]], [[chlorine]], and [[phosgene]]. The zone is sealed off completely and still deemed too dangerous for civilians to return: \"The area is still considered to be very poisoned, so the French government planted an enormous forest of black pines, like a living [[sarcophagus]]\", comments Alasdair Pinkerton, a researcher at [[Royal Holloway University of London]], who compared the zone to the [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone|nuclear disaster site at Chernobyl]], similarly encased in a \"concrete sarcophagus\".<ref name=\"bbc.com_2015-09-30\"/>\n\n=== Cold War ===\nDuring the [[Cold War]], one example of \"no man's land\" was the territory close to the [[Iron Curtain]]. Officially the territory belonged to the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, but over the entire Iron Curtain there were several wide tracts of uninhabited land, several hundred meters in width, containing watch towers, minefields, unexploded bombs, and other such debris. Would-be escapees from Eastern Bloc countries who successfully scaled the border fortifications could still be apprehended or shot by border guards in the zone.\n\nThe [[United States Navy|U.S. Naval]] Base at [[Guant\u00e1namo Bay]], Cuba is separated from [[Cuba]] proper by an area called the [[Cactus Curtain]]. In late 1961, Cuba had its troops plant an {{convert|8|mi|km|adj=on}} barrier of ''[[Opuntia]]'' cactus along the northeastern section of the {{convert|28|km|adj=on}} fence surrounding the base to prevent economic migrants fleeing from Cuba from resettling in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.american.edu/TED/guantan.htm |title=Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and Ecological Crises |work=Trade and Environment Database |publisher=[[American University]] |accessdate=2009-04-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327053019/http://www.american.edu/TED/guantan.htm |archivedate=2009-03-27 }}</ref> This was dubbed the \"Cactus Curtain\", an allusion to [[Europe]]'s [[Iron Curtain]]<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,940656,00.html |title=Yankees Besieged |journal=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |date=1962-03-16 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828155348/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,940656,00.html |archivedate=2010-08-28 }}</ref> and the [[Bamboo Curtain]] in [[East Asia]]. U.S. and Cuban troops placed some 55,000 [[land mine]]s across the no man's land, creating the second-largest minefield in the world, and the largest in the [[Americas]]. On 16 May 1996, [[Bill Clinton]], the [[President of the United States]], ordered their removal.
