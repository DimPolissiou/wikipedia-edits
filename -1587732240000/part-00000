In some parts of the world, an '''orphan disease''' is a rare disease whose rarity means there is a lack of a market large enough to gain support and resources for discovering treatments for it, except by the government granting economically advantageous conditions to creating and selling such treatments. [[Orphan drugs]] are ones so created or sold.\n\nMost rare diseases are genetic and thus are present throughout the person's entire life, even if symptoms do not immediately appear. Many rare diseases appear early in life, and about 30% of children with rare diseases will die before reaching their fifth birthday.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siope.eu/SIOPE-EU/English/SIOPE-EU/Advocacy-Activities/Rare-Diseases/page.aspx/148 |title=Rare Diseases |publisher=Siope.Eu |date=2009-06-09 |access-date=2012-09-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203212325/http://www.siope.eu/SIOPE-EU/English/SIOPE-EU/Advocacy-Activities/Rare-Diseases/page.aspx/148 |archive-date=3 December 2012 }}</ref> With only three diagnosed patients in 27 years, [[ribose-5-phosphate isomerase deficiency]] is considered the rarest known genetic disease.<ref name=\"wamelink\">{{cite journal |last=Wamelink |first=M.

Some definitions rely solely on the number of people living with a disease, and other definitions include other factors, such as the existence of adequate treatments or the severity of the disease.\n\nIn the [[United States]], the [[Rare Diseases Act of 2002]] defines ''rare disease'' strictly according to prevalence, specifically \"any disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States\",<ref name=RDA2002>[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=107_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ280.107 Rare Disease Act of 2002]</ref> or about 1 in 1,500 people.

This is especially true of [[genetic disease]]s and [[infectious disease]]s.  An example is [[cystic fibrosis]], a genetic disease:  it is rare in most parts of [[Asia]] but relatively common in Europe and in populations of European descent.  In smaller communities, the [[founder effect]] can result in a disease that is very rare worldwide being prevalent within the smaller community.  Many infectious diseases are prevalent in a given geographic area but rare everywhere else.  Other diseases, such as many rare forms of [[cancer]], have no apparent pattern of distribution but are simply rare.  The classification of other conditions depends in part on the population being studied:  All forms of cancer in children are generally considered rare,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecpc-online.org/newsletter/member-updates/168-rare-cancer-day.html |title=02/2009: Rare Cancers on Rare Disease Day |publisher=Ecpc-online.org |date=2009-02-28 |access-date=2012-09-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726131436/http://www.ecpc-online.org/newsletter/member-updates/168-rare-cancer-day.html |archive-date=26 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> because so few children develop cancer, but the same cancer in adults may be more common.\n\nAbout 40 rare diseases have a far higher prevalence in [[Finland]];  these are known collectively as [[Finnish heritage disease]].

This definition is essentially the same as that of the [[Orphan Drug Act of 1983]], a federal law that was written to encourage research into rare diseases and possible cures.\n\nIn Japan, the legal definition of a rare disease is one that affects fewer than 50,000 patients in Japan, or about 1 in 2,500 people.<ref name=Italy>[http://malattierare.regione.veneto.it/inglese/dicosaparliamo_ing.php Rare diseases: what are we talking about?]</ref>\n\nHowever, the [[European Commission]] on Public Health defines rare diseases as \"life-threatening or [[chronic (medicine)|chronically]] debilitating diseases which are of such low prevalence that special combined efforts are needed to address them\".<ref name=EU>{{cite web | access-date=19 May 2009 | title=Useful Information on Rare Diseases from an EU Perspective | url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_information/documents/ev20040705_rd05_en.pdf | publisher=European Commission}}</ref>  The term ''low prevalence'' is later defined as generally meaning fewer than 1 in 2,000 people.<ref name=BaldovinoMoliner2016>{{cite journal | vauthors = Baldovino S, Moliner AM, Taruscio D, Daina E, Roccatello D | title = Rare Diseases in Europe: from a Wide to a Local Perspective | journal = The Israel Medical Association Journal | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 359\u201363 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27468531 | url = http://www.ima.org.il/FilesUpload/IMAJ/0/200/100025.pdf | type = Review }}</ref><!--The European Union defines rare diseases (RDs) as lifethreatening or chronically debilitating conditions whose prevalence is less than 5 per 10,000.--> Diseases that are statistically rare, but not also life-threatening, chronically debilitating, or inadequately treated, are excluded from their definition.\n\nThe definitions used in the [[medical literature]] and by national health plans are similarly divided, with definitions ranging from 1/1,000 to 1/200,000.<ref name=Italy />\n\n==Relationship to orphan diseases==\nBecause of definitions that include reference to treatment availability, a lack of resources, and severity of the disease, the term ''orphan disease'' is used as a synonym for ''rare disease''.<ref name=Italy/>  But in the United States and the [[European Union]], \"orphan diseases\" have a distinct legal meaning.\n\nThe United States' [[Orphan Drug Act]] includes both rare diseases and any non-rare diseases \"for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for such disease or condition will [be] recovered from sales in the United States of such drug\" as ''orphan diseases''.<ref>[https://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DevelopingProductsforRareDiseasesConditions/Overview/ucm119477.htm Orphan Drug Act] \u00a7526(a)(2)</ref>\n\nThe [[European Organization for Rare Diseases]] (EURORDIS) also includes both rare diseases and [[neglected tropical diseases|neglected diseases]] into a larger category of \"orphan diseases\".<ref name=Eurodis>{{cite web | url= http://www.eurordis.org/IMG/pdf/princeps_document-EN.pdf | title=Rare Diseases: Understanding This Public Health Priority | publisher= European Organisation for Rare Diseases (EURORDIS) | date= November 2005 | access-date=16 May 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Prevalence==\n[[Prevalence]] (number of people living with a disease at a given moment), rather than [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] (number of new diagnoses in a given year), is used to describe the impact of rare diseases. The [[Global Genes Project]] estimates some 300 million people worldwide are affected by a rare disease.\n\nThe [[European Organization for Rare Diseases]] (EURORDIS) estimates that as many as 5,000 to 7,000 distinct rare diseases exist, and as much as 6% to 8% of the population of the [[European Union]] is affected by one.<ref name=Eurodis /> Only about 400 rare diseases have therapies and about 80% have a genetic component according to Rare Genomics Institute.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rare Diseases, Diagnosis, Therapies, and Hope|last=Sanfilippo|first=Ana|last2=Lin|first2=Jimmy|publisher=Rare Genomics Institute|year=2014|isbn=|location=St. Louis, MO|pages=6}}</ref>\n\nRare diseases can vary in prevalence between populations, so a disease that is rare in some populations may be common in others.  This is especially true of [[genetic disease]]s and [[infectious disease]]s.  An example is [[cystic fibrosis]], a genetic disease:  it is rare in most parts of [[Asia]] but relatively common in Europe and in populations of European descent.  In smaller communities, the [[founder effect]] can result in a disease that is very rare worldwide being prevalent within the smaller community.  Many infectious diseases are prevalent in a given geographic area but rare everywhere else.  Other diseases, such as many rare forms of [[cancer]], have no apparent pattern of distribution but are simply rare.  The classification of other conditions depends in part on the population being studied:  All forms of cancer in children are generally considered rare,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecpc-online.org/newsletter/member-updates/168-rare-cancer-day.html |title=02/2009: Rare Cancers on Rare Disease Day |publisher=Ecpc-online.org |date=2009-02-28 |access-date=2012-09-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726131436/http://www.ecpc-online.org/newsletter/member-updates/168-rare-cancer-day.html |archive-date=26 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> because so few children develop cancer, but the same cancer in adults may be more common.\n\nAbout 40 rare diseases have a far higher prevalence in [[Finland]];  these are known collectively as [[Finnish heritage disease]].

The powers pursued [[Roberto Cofres\u00ed]]'s [[piracy|pirate]] flotilla in March 1825 because of the economic losses suffered by the parties to the pirates, as well as diplomatic concerns caused by their use of the flags of Spain and [[Gran Colombia]] which menaced the fragile peace between the naval powers. Several of those involved had been attacked by the freebooters. Among the diplomatic concerns caused by Cofres\u00ed was a robbery carried out by several of his subordinates, the catalyst of an incident that threatened war between Spain and the United States known as \"The Foxardo Affair\", eventually leading to the resignation of his rival, pirate hunter [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]].\n\nSailing under the authorization of the [[Danish West Indies]], the coalition employed two local ships, including a former victim of the pirates named ''San Jos\u00e9 y las Animas'' and [[United States Ship|USS]] {{USS|Grampus|1821|2}} of the [[West Indies Squadron (United States)|West Indies Squadron]]. A ship from Gran Colombia, named ''La Invencible'', also provided support during the initial stages.

The [[flagship]] of Cofres\u00ed's flotilla, the [[sloop]] ''Anne'' (otherwise known as ''Ana''), was baited by the set up. Surprised and outnumbered, the pirates abandoned the ship and escaped to shore, where they were captured by Puerto Rican authorities and placed on military trial.

There they plundered an establishment named Cabot, Bailey & Company, carrying 5,000 dollars in loot and returning to Puerto Rico. Aware of the incident, Charles T. Platt of the West Indies Squadron left that port aboard ''Beagle'' two days later, accompanied by one of the affected merchants. The vessel first encountered the pirates off Vieques, but was unable to capture any. However, they were able to gather information that led them to Fajardo. Upon arriving there, Platt, who was not wearing a uniform, explained his operation to the port captain through a translator. The crew was then taken before Mayor Francisco Caro and handed him a letter (originally intended for an associate of the merchant named Juan Campos) with the details of the robbery, but the functionary ordered a search of his ship and documents. Platt left the vicinity in protest and walked towards ''Beagle'', but was arrested along with Midshipman Robert Ritchie and categorized as a suspect himself, being held prisoner under the supervision of the town's mayor.<ref name=\"sweetman\"/> While this happened, some of the stolen goods were tracked to Naguabo with the help of Campos (who was later uncovered as a double agent and one of Cofres\u00ed's cohorts).<ref name=\"Acosta268\"/> Hours later, the process to transfer him to a local jail was completed, but Platt offered resistance and threatened to fight back. This was followed by more delays, but the crew of ''Beagle'' was ultimately allowed to leave port without further repercussions.<ref name=\"sweetman\">{{Harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=38}}</ref>\n\nUpon returning to Saint Thomas, Platt quickly contacted Commodore [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]] and presented his account of the events at Fajardo.<ref name=\"sweetman\"/> After interviewing all of the involved, the officer concluded that the mayor and his subordinates were in fact buying time for the pirates, in the process allowing the mobilization of loot to a less conspicuous location.<ref name=\"sweetman\"/> Shortly afterwards, the local Consular Agent Stephen Cabot brought him reports that Campos had bought the stolen goods. Incensed by this revelation, Porter ordered that an unsanctioned expedition was to leave port.\n<ref name=\"Acosta268\">{{Harvnb|Acosta|1991|p=68}}</ref> The commodore led the flotilla aboard the frigate {{USS|John Adams|1799|6}}, and was joined by ''Grampus'' and ''Beagle''. Porter arrived at Fajardo on November 14, 1824, and delivered a letter demanding an explanation to the local authorities.<ref name=\"sweetman\"/> In this missive, the commodore also warned that, if ignored, he would march with his troops to the town within an hour, and that if the military tried to defend it, the result would be the \"total destruction\" of Fajardo.<ref name=\"sweetman\"/>\n\nHowever, the Spanish authorities took the action as an attack and began arming the port's artillery. Noticing this, Porter sent sailors to disable it and subsequently commanded the landing of two hundred additional marines.<ref name=\"sweetman\"/> The division marched onwards until they halted at the town's entrance, where the Spanish stood ready to defend it. Aware that the diplomatic crisis could lead to a full blown war between Spain and the United States and still within the grace period, the mayor and the captain of the port arrived at the scene and offered apologies to Platt and Porter.<ref name=\"sweetman\"/> The marines were then directed to march to the vessels and returned to Saint Thomas. The local United States ambassador soon received confirmation of Campos's real allegiance. The Spanish government then took further actions to prevent repercussions, removing both the mayor and the captain of the port from their offices, and beginning a process to purge the accomplices of the pirates. The government of the United States did its part to control the damage, and Porter was soon placed on court-martial.<ref name=\"sweetman\"/>\n\n==Preparations==\n\n===Victims of Cofres\u00ed rendezvous in St. Thomas===\nThe arrival of Low at his home base of St. Thomas coincided with the visit of USS ''Grampus''.<ref name=\"bonet173\"/> Shortly afterwards, a vessel arrived from Puerto Rico, its captain having seen Cofres\u00ed's flagship at Vieques.<ref name=\"bonet173\"/> Upon learning of the incident and with the current whereabouts of the pirates known, Sloat made a request to the port authorities in St. Thomas and was able to find three captains willing to help in the mission.<ref name=\"bonet173\"/> Two men from Puerto Rico, Salvador Pastoriza and Pierety, volunteered their ships, which also possessing Danish documents could sail from that port.{{#tag:ref|Puerto Rican vessels often possessed official documents from friendly nations besides Spain, which they used to defend themselves from privateers.<ref name=\"Acosta267\">{{Harvnb|Acosta|1991|p=267}}</ref>|group=\"nb\"}}<ref name=\"bonet173\"/> After his request was met, Sloat held a reunion with the governor of St.Thomas, [[Peter Carl Frederik von Scholten]].<ref name=\"bonet173\"/> The captain pleaded for authorization to launch an expedition to Puerto Rico and Vieques from the port of St. Thomas, also appealing for the use of the three sloops.<ref name=\"bonet174\">{{Harvnb|Cardona Bonet|1991|p=174}}</ref> Aware that both the Danish and American navies had been unsuccessfully searching for Cofres\u00ed and shared a common interest, the governor conceded the use of the ships.<ref name=\"bonet173\"/> Furthermore, these were the same pirates that had captured and commandeered the sloops ''Neptune'' and ''Anne'' (both operating under Danish papers, but based at St.Thomas), attacked another sailing off St. Croix, and sacked several local stores during an incident.<ref name=\"bonet173\"/> The only demand of the Danish government was that they were to be used only for this mission.<ref name=\"bonet174\"/>\n\nPreparations were quickly completed, and no new incidents occurred during this period.<ref name=\"bonet174\"/> Sloat delegated command of the two Spanish ships to lieutenants [[Garrett J.

militiamen to lie down on the deck and wait, ready to open fire.<ref name=\"bonet181\"/> Cofres\u00ed, unaware that the military was employing sloops in his search, assumed that it was a merchant ship and ordered his crew to approach it.<ref name=\"bonet181\"/> When ''Anne'' was close enough, Pendergrast ordered the troops to fire the cannon and empty their rifles.<ref name=\"bonet181\"/>

However, despite arguing that Fajardo had turned into a pirate's nest and that the complicity of the authorities made them enemies, Porter was found guilty and in turn resigned his commission and defected.<ref name=\"Acosta274\">{{Harvnb|Acosta|1991|p=74}}</ref>\n\n===Long term repercussions===\n\nSince Cofres\u00ed's contacts extended throughout the west, south and east coasts of Puerto Rico, the authorities continued investigating and arresting people that were considered to have been associates of the pirates.<ref name=\"num125\">{{Harvnb|Fern\u00e1ndez Valledor|1978|p=125}}</ref> There were so many linked to Cofres\u00ed, that this process extended for more than a decade.<ref name=\"num125\"/> Due to their connections, both of his brothers were jailed between 1824 and 1826.<ref name=\"bonet30\">{{Harvnb|Cardona Bonet|1991|p=30}}</ref> The sudden disappearance of ''Neptune'' gathered the attention of the authorities, and shortly after the capture of the pirates, a similar vessel sailing under the name ''Neptuno'' was traced sailing alongside a schooner named ''Mar\u00eda'', property of Pedro Alac\u00e1n.<ref name=\"bonet256\">{{Harvnb|Cardona Bonet|1991|p=256}}</ref> This man had collaborated with the authorities in several of its incursions against Cofres\u00ed, including a highly publicized mission to Mona on June 22, 1824. For his work in this operation and lending his sloop ''Avispa'' (which was reportedly lost in a storm during the voyage), Alac\u00e1n received a military recognition and was restituted with a pirate vessel confiscated at Mona. However, as soon as a connection to the fate of ''Neptune'' was established, he was arrested along with other members of that foray.<ref name=\"bonet257\">{{Harvnb|Cardona Bonet|1991|p=257}}</ref> The reason behind the contradictory actions of Alac\u00e1n following the mission at Mona and his subsequent association with Cofres\u00ed remain unclear.<ref name=\"bonet257\"/> Among the possibilities explored by historian Walter Cardona Bonet are that ''Avispa'' was never lost, but given to the pirates, and that his involvement in the mission was to ensure that they escaped.<ref name=\"bonet258\">{{Harvnb|Cardona Bonet|1991|p=258}}</ref> It is likely that the association with Alac\u00e1n began after Juan Francisco was arrested, with his taking over the distribution of contraband.<ref name=\"bonet258\"/>\n\nDuring his time in jail, Salda\u00f1a confessed the location of Del Rosario, De la Rosa and Pizarro.<ref name=\"bonet225\">{{Harvnb|Cardona Bonet|1991|p=225}}</ref> De la Torre ordered an expedition to Vieques to capture them.<ref name=\"bonet231\">{{Harvnb|Cardona Bonet|1991|p=231}}</ref> However, the mission failed, with Ramos offering haven to two of the pirates.<ref name=\"bonet231\"/> Manuel Ramos, a cousin of De los Reyes, had provided refuge and protection from the authorities.<ref name=\"bonet228\">{{Harvnb|Cardona Bonet|1991|p=228}}</ref> Del Rosario Centeno was not on the island by this time, instead hiding at Naguabo.<ref name=\"bonet231\"/> De los Reyes was later arrested at the same location during the summer of 1825.<ref name=\"bonet233\">{{Harvnb|Cardona Bonet|1991|p=233}}</ref> Pizarro was also believed to hide here or at the adjacent property of another associate named Guillermo Opio, eventually moving to Africa to work in slave trading.<ref name=\"bonet241\">{{Harvnb|Cardona Bonet|1991|p=241}}</ref> Merchant Juan de Arce was also captured in Naguabo after his figure was linked to Cofres\u00ed by the military commander of Vieques, Antonio Rosell\u00f3, who identified that one of his ships was in service of the pirates.<ref name=\"bonet264\">{{Harvnb|Cardona Bonet|1991|p=264}}</ref><ref name=\"bonet265\">{{Harvnb|Cardona Bonet|1991|p=265}}</ref> Jos\u00e9 Salvador Pardo Figueroa and Manuel Xim\u00e9nez were also brought from Vieques as suspects.<ref name=\"bonet282\">{{Harvnb|Cardona Bonet|1991|p=282}}</ref>\n\nDe la Rosa was arrested during this period.<ref name=\"bonet236\">{{Harvnb|Cardona Bonet|1991|p=236}}</ref> Jaime M\u00e1rquez escaped to St. Thomas, where he was pursued for planning a mutiny aboard the Spanish schooner ''Dorada'' and arrested in December 1825 for stealing the sloop ''L'Amadea''.<ref name=\"bonet269\">{{Harvnb|Cardona Bonet|1991|p=269}}</ref> Juan Geraldo Bey was sought after as a pirate for his association with Cofres\u00ed, remaining fugitive until January 1826.<ref name=\"bonet49\">{{Harvnb|Cardona Bonet|1991|p=49}}</ref> Ramos was captured at Vieques on October 13, 1826, after allegedly trying to recruit sailors for piracy.<ref name=\"bonet237\">{{Harvnb|Cardona Bonet|1991|p=237}}</ref> Juan Pe\u00f1a, the former captain of ''Mar\u00eda'', was arrested as an accomplice of the pirates in February 1827, this despite not being involved in the incident with ''Neptune''.<ref name=\"bonet272\">{{Harvnb|Cardona Bonet|1991|p=272}}</ref> Parallel to this, Del Rosario was arrested for other crimes, dying while serving his sentence.<ref name=\"bonet263\">{{Harvnb|Cardona Bonet|1991|p=263}}</ref> During the following years, a number of associates were arrested and died in jail including Juan Ramos, Juan Gufao, Jos\u00e9 Correa, Antonio Carreras and Manuel Ramos.<ref name=\"bonet261\">{{Harvnb|Cardona Bonet|1991|p=261}}</ref> Another suspect, Jos\u00e9 del Rosario died in jail for another crime before he could be prosecuted for his association with Cofres\u00ed.<ref name=\"bonet218\"/> Reyes Paz and Gallardo escaped Puerto Rico and boarded a slaver's ship at St. Thomas, but they were discovered and sent to San Juan, where they were subjected to trial.<ref name=\"bonet222\"/> Morales Hern\u00e1ndez remained fugitive until 1839, when he was caught in Naguabo and executed with the [[garrote]].<ref name=\"bonet252\">{{Harvnb|Cardona Bonet|1991|p=252}}</ref>\n\n==Official recounts and media coverage==\n\n===Sloat's report===\nThe American version states that Commander Sloat solicited permission for the use of two small ships after becoming aware of Cofres\u00ed's latest actions. After becoming acquainted with Cofres\u00ed, John Low was brought in along the crew.<ref name=\"United States\"/> The report claims that Sloat was aware of an evasion strategy that was used by the pirates to escape when pursued by large ships, which consisted of traveling as close to the coast as possible in small draft vessels, thereby avoiding being followed. Therefore, he used the small ships in order to pursue them while attempting this strategy.<ref name=\"United States\"/> Both vessels were armed and began working in an exploratory manner, traveling through several ports and coastal towns. On the third day while sailing near Ponce, ''Dolphin'' located a ship in Boca del Infierno and identified it as ''Anne''.<ref name=\"Acosta278\"/> When Cofres\u00ed saw the ship, he confused it with a merchant vessel, since it was not flying its actual colors, and ordered his crew to attack. Armed with a four-pounder cannon, ''Anne'' approached the ship, but the crew revealed that it was a military vessel by hoisting the [[Jack of the United States|Navy jack]] and opened fire.<ref name=\"United States\">{{Harvnb|Fern\u00e1ndez Valledor|1978|p=64}}</ref> The subsequent exchange lasted forty-five minutes and ended when the pirates abandoned their ship and swam to the nearby beach. Vicente Antoneti, who was traveling in Bautista Pierety's boat, disembarked and notified the local Spanish military unit about the event. Two of the pirates died in the battle and six others, including Cofres\u00ed, were injured.<ref name=\"pag.65\">{{Harvnb|Fern\u00e1ndez Valledor|1978|p=65}}</ref> Sloat estimated that Cofres\u00ed had lost a third of his crew in the previous exchange, based on the number of bodies on the water surrounding the boat.<ref name=\"Espa\u00f1a\"/> Aboard ''Anne'' they found several muskets, guns, cutlasses and knives.<ref name=\"pag.65\"/><ref name=\"Acosta71\">{{Harvnb|Acosta|1991|p=71}}</ref> The sloop was then sailed towards St. Thomas, arriving there by March 11, 1825.<ref name=\"pag.65\"/> Cofres\u00ed was ultimately caught after receiving a blunderbuss injury to his left arm and was subdued with a hit from a carbine's stock.<ref name=\"Acosta73\">{{Harvnb|Acosta|1991|p=73}}</ref>\n\n===Renovales' report===\nMost of the discrepancies between the Spanish account and Sloat's report originate from colonel Renovales of the Southern District's Command, who issued his report after personally hosting Pendergrast.<ref name=\"Acosta277\">{{Harvnb|Acosta|1991|p=77}}</ref> On March 1, 1825, the mayor of Guayama was informed that a suspicious sloop was anchoring at Boca del Infierno.<ref name=\"Acosta276\">{{Harvnb|Acosta|1991|p=276}}</ref> According to this version, Renovales himself requested the service of three vessels the following day. The most notable boats of this excursion were ''San Jos\u00e9 y Las Animas'', loaned for the mission, and ''Grampus,'' which belonged to the United States.<ref name=\"captura\"/> According to the officer, the strategy to capture the pirates was developed by Jos\u00e9 Ort\u00edz de la Renta, the mayor of the municipality of Ponce, and himself.<ref name=\"Acosta278\">{{Harvnb|Acosta|1991|p=78}}</ref> The mayor is also credited with the initiative of recruiting Sloat to command the [[reconnaissance]] mission.<ref name=\"captura\">{{Harvnb|Fern\u00e1ndez Valledor|1978|p=61}}</ref> Renovales uses the Spanish name of both ships in its report, also stating that lieutenant Pendergrast was not in command of ''San Jos\u00e9 y las Animas''.<ref name=\"Acosta277\"/> Renovales also claims Centeno as the owner of ''Anne'', without mention of Low.<ref name=\"Acosta278\"/> Three American officers and a doctor accompanied Sloat in this mission. Pendergrast, George A. Magrades and Francis Store plus a crew of twenty-three sailors were assigned to the mission.<ref name=\"captura\"/> The sailors were heavily armed and a new cannon was mounted on the ship. On the afternoon of the third day one of the ships located Cofres\u00ed, near the entrance of Boca del Infierno.<ref name=\"captura\"/> When the pirates spotted the vessel ''San Jos\u00e9 y Las Animas'', they confused it with a merchant ship and proceeded to attack it.<ref name=\"captura\"/> The crew of the ship hid until the pirates were within shooting distance, when they opened fire.<ref name=\"captura\"/> Both vessels exchanged cannon fire. Cofres\u00ed commanded ''Ana'' to go near land, but was forced to disembark in the coast and to retreat into a nearby forestal area.<ref name=\"Espa\u00f1a\">{{Harvnb|Fern\u00e1ndez Valledor|1978|p=62}}</ref>\n\nLater that day the mayor of the town of Los Jobos issued a statement which detailed the pirates' entrance into the beach, and he subsequently notified the local authorities about the event.<ref name=\"Espa\u00f1a\"/> A search operation was launched and during the dusk hours six pirates were captured. The Spanish government then sent military personnel to block all the roads and plains surrounding the area. Two of the search groups believed that the pirates would have to pass through a certain road in order to escape and planned to ambush them there. The pirates reached the location at 10:30&nbsp;p.m. and tried to escape, but were intercepted. According to Renovales, Manuel S\u00e1nchez de Ortiz and a group of militiamen found Cofres\u00ed and two cohorts near Patillas that night.<ref name=\"Acosta276\"/> Cofres\u00ed tried to defend himself with a knife, but his injury facilitated their capture.<ref name=\"Espa\u00f1a\"/> Juan Garay is still credited for disabling his arm with the blunderbuss during their confrontation.<ref name=\"num106\">{{Harvnb|Fern\u00e1ndez Valledor|1978|p=106}}</ref> His injuries were severe, but a doctor declared that they were not lethal. The rest of the crew was captured by the police departments of [[Patillas, Puerto Rico|Patillas]] and [[Guayama, Puerto Rico|Guayama]] on March 7 and 8.<ref name=\"Espa\u00f1a2\">{{Harvnb|Fern\u00e1ndez Valledor|1978|p=63}}</ref> The names of the known crewmembers are Juan Carlos de Torres and Santiago D\u00edaz.<ref name=\"Espa\u00f1a2\"/> Both men exhibited recent gun wounds, with the former still carrying fifteen Spanish coins, handkerchiefs, two faux pearl necklaces, a list written in English, two earrings, two razors and three bullets, among other things.<ref name=\"Espa\u00f1a2\"/>\n\n===Press accounts===\nDetails of the trials were suppressed locally, with only the government's ''La Gaceta de Puerto Rico'' publishing its account.<ref name=\"Judge and Jury\"/> This result was highly suspicious due to the Caribbean press' high interest in piracy, suggesting a media blackout or coverup.<ref name=\"Judge and Jury\"/> Despite this, the United States press quickly acted to propagate its knowledge of the case in order to influence the Porter trial, since he justified his invasion by claiming that Puerto Rico had become a Government-sanctioned pirate's nest.<ref name=\"Judge and Jury\"/> By April, newspapers such as ''[[Maryland Gazette|The Maryland Gazette]]'' were reprinting the government's account of the events.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/41042702/|title=April 21, 1825: The Maryland Gazette from Annapolis, Maryland|newspaper=[[Maryland Gazette|The Maryland Gazette]]|date=1825-04-21|accessdate=2015-03-29}}</ref> On May 28, 1825, the ''[[Bolet\u00edn Oficial del Estado|Gaceta de Madrid]]'' published an article where De la Torre is quoted praising the local effort and noting the \"sleepless nights\" that were spent due to \"[his] government's interest\" to \"exterminate [the pirates].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/14d3c2532be79409|author=Miguel de la Torre|title=Proclama del Capit\u00e1n general de Puerto-Rico|language=Spanish|date=1825-05-28|accessdate=2015-05-16}}</ref>\n\nIn 1846, ''[[Boston Evening Traveller|Boston Traveller]]'' reporter Freeman Hunt elaborates and recounts that upon landing ashore, Cofres\u00ed employed sly tactics to avoid the soldiers, first exploiting the chaos to evade the cavalry and then stealing the clothes and animals from a herdsman.<ref name=\"obituary\">{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EJ4RAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA450|title=Naval and Mercantile Biography|author=Freeman Hunt|magazine=Hunt's Merchants' Magazine|year=1846|accessdate=2015-04-21}}</ref> The pirate then hid in plain sight by directing the herd towards the soldiers and scattering them away by providing false information about the location of his crew while unrecognized.<ref name=\"obituary\"/> Hunt notes that Cofres\u00ed was close to escaping, but a child present at the last guard post recognized him due to bilateral [[syndactyly]], forcing him to run and be wounded by a shot to the neck.<ref name=\"obituary\"/> Despite bleeding, the pirate recovered quickly and unfurled his knife, gaining an upper hand until more soldiers were attracted by the noise.<ref name=\"obituary\"/> One of them hit Cofres\u00ed with the stock of a carbine, taking advantage that he was still struggling with the first.<ref name=\"obituary\"/> His hands were then bound and his feet were fastened to a horse.<ref name=\"obituary\"/> Hunt claims that despite his injuries, Cofres\u00ed was placed in iron handcuffs and that a soldier was assigned to his bedside.<ref name=\"obituary\"/> Other unusual precautions were reportedly taken due to his reputation, including the doubling of guards throughout the prison and an \"officer [being] made responsible with his head for the [fate] of the prisoner\".<ref name=\"obituary\"/> Hunt states that during this arrest the pirate narrated his life, explained his motivations and also boasted about his athletic capacity by claiming to have been \"the most active man\" and \"best runner on the island\".<ref name=\"obituary\"/>\n\nIn 1923, Francis B.

The powers pursued [[Roberto Cofres\u00ed]]'s [[piracy|pirate]] flotilla in March 1825 because of the economic losses suffered by the parties to the pirates, as well as diplomatic concerns caused by their use of the flags of Spain and [[Gran Colombia]] which menaced the fragile peace between the naval powers. Several of those involved had been attacked by the freebooters. Among the diplomatic concerns caused by Cofres\u00ed was a robbery carried out by several of his subordinates, the catalyst of an incident that threatened war between Spain and the United States known as \"The Foxardo Affair\", eventually leading to the resignation of his rival, pirate hunter [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]].\n\nSailing under the authorization of the [[Danish West Indies]], the coalition employed two local ships, including a former victim of the pirates named ''San Jos\u00e9 y las Animas'' and [[United States Ship|USS]] {{USS|Grampus|1821|2}} of the [[West Indies Squadron (United States)|West Indies Squadron]]. A ship from Gran Colombia, named ''La Invencible'', also provided support during the initial stages.

The [[flagship]] of Cofres\u00ed's flotilla, the [[sloop]] ''Anne'' (otherwise known as ''Ana''), was baited by the set up. Surprised and outnumbered, the pirates abandoned the ship and escaped to shore, where they were captured by Puerto Rican authorities and placed on military trial. With the execution of Cofres\u00ed, the West Indies Anti-Piracy Operations were considered a success and he came to be known as \"the last of the West India pirates\".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/lifeoflaterearad00sher/page/n427/mode/2up |first=Edwin A. |last=Sherman|title=The life of the late Rear-Admiral John Drake Sloat |date=1902 |accessdate=2015-05-19 |page=428 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\n===Cofres\u00ed's modus operandi===\n\nWhile still regarded as a ''[[Don (honorific)|Don]]'', Cofres\u00ed began his criminal life in Puerto Rico by leading a band of highway robbers which made a profit by assaulting farmers and merchants, from whom they would steal merchandise which was later sold by close friends and family.<ref name=\"bonet18\"/> The government soon began a campaign to capture the gangs related to these crimes, most of which were from [[Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico|Cabo Rojo]].<ref name=\"bonet17\">{{Harvnb|Cardona Bonet|1991|p=17}}</ref> It was another respected and wealthy man, Juan Bey, who first exposed Cofres\u00ed as the man behind these bands while being prosecuted for murder.<ref name=\"bonet17\"/> This led to the arrest of him and several collaborators, but he was able to escape.<ref name=\"bonet17\"/> A fugitive on land, Cofres\u00ed  had already turned to piracy by 1823.

The assaults that Cofres\u00ed's flotilla led against international vessels soon attracted the attention of the West Indies Squadron, which began pursuing him after the capture of the American merchant vessels named ''John'' and ''William Henry''. At the height of this search, the schooners {{USS|Beagle|1822|6}}, {{USS|Grampus|1821|6}} and {{USS|Shark|1821|6}} were patrolling the waters of Puerto Rico.<ref name=\"bonet155\">{{Harvnb|Cardona Bonet|1991|p=155}}</ref> Despite this, Cofres\u00ed was undeterred and instead adopted a strategy of using the speed of its vessels to potshot the military ships.

When ''Grampus'' retaliated, the pirates outsailed the schooner and docked at [[Naguabo, Puerto Rico]], where they continued their plundering streak.<ref name=\"bonet156\"/> The crew of ''Grampus'' tried to track them, but after failing to locate anyone in hours abandoned the area.<ref name=\"bonet157\">{{Harvnb|Cardona Bonet|1991|p=157}}</ref>\n\nOn February 10, 1825, Cofres\u00ed boarded a sloop named ''Neptune'' while it was docked at Jobos Bay.<ref name=\"bonet165\">{{Harvnb|Cardona Bonet|1991|p=165}}</ref> The pirates ambushed the merchant sloop's crew, led by its owner, Salvador Pastoriza, by firing muskets at it.<ref name=\"bonet159\">{{Harvnb|Cardona Bonet|1991|p=159}}</ref> The merchant was able to escape from the ship amidst the gunfire, but was injured and witnessed as the pirates looted ''Neptune''.<ref name=\"bonet161\">{{Harvnb|Cardona Bonet|1991|p=161}}</ref> After completing this task, Cofres\u00ed commandeered the sloop out of the Bay and assimilated it into his flotilla.<ref name=\"correr\u00edas\">{{Harvnb|Fern\u00e1ndez Valledor|1978|p=60}}</ref> ''Neptune'' was then used in the attack on two Danish vessels, property of W.

There they plundered an establishment named Cabot, Bailey & Company, carrying 5,000 dollars in loot and returning to Puerto Rico. Aware of the incident, Charles T. Platt of the West Indies Squadron left that port aboard ''Beagle'' two days later, accompanied by one of the affected merchants. The vessel first encountered the pirates off Vieques, but was unable to capture any. However, they were able to gather information that led them to Fajardo. Upon arriving there, Platt, who was not wearing a uniform, explained his operation to the port captain through a translator. The crew was then taken before Mayor Francisco Caro and handed him a letter (originally intended for an associate of the merchant named Juan Campos) with the details of the robbery, but the functionary ordered a search of his ship and documents. Platt left the vicinity in protest and walked towards ''Beagle'', but was arrested along with Midshipman Robert Ritchie and categorized as a suspect himself, being held prisoner under the supervision of the town's mayor.<ref name=\"sweetman\"/> While this happened, some of the stolen goods were tracked to Naguabo with the help of Campos (who was later uncovered as a double agent and one of Cofres\u00ed's cohorts).<ref name=\"Acosta268\"/> Hours later, the process to transfer him to a local jail was completed, but Platt offered resistance and threatened to fight back. This was followed by more delays, but the crew of ''Beagle'' was ultimately allowed to leave port without further repercussions.<ref name=\"sweetman\">{{Harvnb|Sweetman|2002|p=38}}</ref>\n\nUpon returning to Saint Thomas, Platt quickly contacted Commodore [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]] and presented his account of the events at Fajardo.<ref name=\"sweetman\"/> After interviewing all of the involved, the officer concluded that the mayor and his subordinates were in fact buying time for the pirates, in the process allowing the mobilization of loot to a less conspicuous location.<ref name=\"sweetman\"/> Shortly afterwards, the local Consular Agent Stephen Cabot brought him reports that Campos had bought the stolen goods. Incensed by this revelation, Porter ordered that an unsanctioned expedition was to leave port.\n<ref name=\"Acosta268\">{{Harvnb|Acosta|1991|p=68}}</ref> The commodore led the flotilla aboard the frigate {{USS|John Adams|1799|6}}, and was joined by ''Grampus'' and ''Beagle''. Porter arrived at Fajardo on November 14, 1824, and delivered a letter demanding an explanation to the local authorities.<ref name=\"sweetman\"/> In this missive, the commodore also warned that, if ignored, he would march with his troops to the town within an hour, and that if the military tried to defend it, the result would be the \"total destruction\" of Fajardo.<ref name=\"sweetman\"/>\n\nHowever, the Spanish authorities took the action as an attack and began arming the port's artillery. Noticing this, Porter sent sailors to disable it and subsequently commanded the landing of two hundred additional marines.<ref name=\"sweetman\"/> The division marched onwards until they halted at the town's entrance, where the Spanish stood ready to defend it. Aware that the diplomatic crisis could lead to a full blown war between Spain and the United States and still within the grace period, the mayor and the captain of the port arrived at the scene and offered apologies to Platt and Porter.<ref name=\"sweetman\"/> The marines were then directed to march to the vessels and returned to Saint Thomas. The local United States ambassador soon received confirmation of Campos's real allegiance. The Spanish government then took further actions to prevent repercussions, removing both the mayor and the captain of the port from their offices, and beginning a process to purge the accomplices of the pirates. The government of the United States did its part to control the damage, and Porter was soon placed on court-martial.<ref name=\"sweetman\"/>\n\n==Preparations==\n\n===Victims of Cofres\u00ed rendezvous in St. Thomas===\nThe arrival of Low at his home base of St. Thomas coincided with the visit of USS ''Grampus''.<ref name=\"bonet173\"/> Shortly afterwards, a vessel arrived from Puerto Rico, its captain having seen Cofres\u00ed's flagship at Vieques.<ref name=\"bonet173\"/> Upon learning of the incident and with the current whereabouts of the pirates known, Sloat made a request to the port authorities in St. Thomas and was able to find three captains willing to help in the mission.<ref name=\"bonet173\"/> Two men from Puerto Rico, Salvador Pastoriza and Pierety, volunteered their ships, which also possessing Danish documents could sail from that port.{{#tag:ref|Puerto Rican vessels often possessed official documents from friendly nations besides Spain, which they used to defend themselves from privateers.<ref name=\"Acosta267\">{{Harvnb|Acosta|1991|p=267}}</ref>|group=\"nb\"}}<ref name=\"bonet173\"/> After his request was met, Sloat held a reunion with the governor of St.Thomas, [[Peter Carl Frederik von Scholten]].<ref name=\"bonet173\"/> The captain pleaded for authorization to launch an expedition to Puerto Rico and Vieques from the port of St. Thomas, also appealing for the use of the three sloops.<ref name=\"bonet174\">{{Harvnb|Cardona Bonet|1991|p=174}}</ref> Aware that both the Danish and American navies had been unsuccessfully searching for Cofres\u00ed and shared a common interest, the governor conceded the use of the ships.<ref name=\"bonet173\"/> Furthermore, these were the same pirates that had captured and commandeered the sloops ''Neptune'' and ''Anne'' (both operating under Danish papers, but based at St.Thomas), attacked another sailing off St. Croix, and sacked several local stores during an incident.<ref name=\"bonet173\"/> The only demand of the Danish government was that they were to be used only for this mission.<ref name=\"bonet174\"/>\n\nPreparations were quickly completed, and no new incidents occurred during this period.<ref name=\"bonet174\"/> Sloat delegated command of the two Spanish ships to lieutenants [[Garrett J.

name=\"bonet181\">{{Harvnb|Cardona Bonet|1991|p=181}}</ref> Cofres\u00ed was leaving one of his most enduring hideouts and was traversing Boca del Infierno, a channel leading into Jobos Bay that is located between two keys, Cayo Caribes and Cayos de Barca.<ref name=\"bonet181\"/> Pendergrast decided to set up a trap by posing as a merchant vessel, ordering all of his marines and the Spanish militiamen to lie down on the deck and wait, ready to open fire.<ref name=\"bonet181\"/> Cofres\u00ed, unaware that the military was employing sloops in his search, assumed that it was a merchant ship and ordered his crew to approach it.<ref name=\"bonet181\"/> When ''Anne'' was close enough, Pendergrast ordered the troops to fire the cannon and empty their rifles.<ref name=\"bonet181\"/> Cofres\u00ed was surprised by the trap, but soon realized the situation and ordered a retaliation, firing his own cannon and having his crew return musket fire.<ref name=\"bonet181\"/> The crew of ''San Jos\u00e9 y las Animas'' then signaled the Spanish troops on land.<ref name=\"bonet181\"/> While the Spanish ship pursued ''Anne'', Cofres\u00ed employed evasive tactics and answered with multiple waves of musket fire.<ref name=\"bonet181\"/>\n\nThe naval engagement lasted for 45 minutes, during which ''San Jos\u00e9 y las Animas'' exploited the offensive position that it had gained during the surprise attack, damaging the mast and hull of ''Anne''.<ref name=\"bonet182\">{{Harvnb|Cardona Bonet|1991|p=182}}</ref> Having been injured along with Juan Carlos Torres and Juan Manuel de

After becoming acquainted with Cofres\u00ed, John Low was brought in along the crew.<ref name=\"United States\"/> The report claims that Sloat was aware of an evasion strategy that was used by the pirates to escape when pursued by large ships, which consisted of traveling as close to the coast as possible in small draft vessels, thereby avoiding being followed. Therefore, he used the small ships in order to pursue them while attempting this strategy.<ref name=\"United States\"/> Both vessels were armed and began working in an exploratory manner, traveling through several ports and coastal towns. On the third day while sailing near Ponce, ''Dolphin'' located a ship in Boca del Infierno and identified it as ''Anne''.<ref name=\"Acosta278\"/> When Cofres\u00ed saw the ship, he confused it with a merchant vessel, since it was not flying its actual colors, and ordered his crew to attack. Armed with a four-pounder cannon, ''Anne'' approached the ship, but the crew revealed that it was a military vessel by hoisting the [[Jack of the United States|Navy jack]] and opened fire.<ref name=\"United States\">{{Harvnb|Fern\u00e1ndez Valledor|1978|p=64}}</ref> The subsequent exchange lasted forty-five minutes and ended when the pirates abandoned their ship and swam to the nearby beach. Vicente Antoneti, who was traveling in Bautista Pierety's boat, disembarked and notified the local Spanish military unit about the event. Two of the pirates died in the battle and six others, including Cofres\u00ed, were injured.<ref name=\"pag.65\">{{Harvnb|Fern\u00e1ndez Valledor|1978|p=65}}</ref> Sloat estimated that Cofres\u00ed had lost a third of his crew in the previous exchange, based on the number of bodies on the water surrounding the boat.<ref name=\"Espa\u00f1a\"/> Aboard ''Anne'' they found several muskets, guns, cutlasses and knives.<ref name=\"pag.65\"/><ref name=\"Acosta71\">{{Harvnb|Acosta|1991|p=71}}</ref> The sloop was then sailed towards St. Thomas, arriving there by March 11, 1825.<ref name=\"pag.65\"/> Cofres\u00ed was ultimately caught after receiving a blunderbuss injury to his left arm and was subdued with a hit from a carbine's stock.<ref name=\"Acosta73\">{{Harvnb|Acosta|1991|p=73}}</ref>\n\n===Renovales' report===\nMost of the discrepancies between the Spanish account and Sloat's report originate from colonel Renovales of the Southern District's Command, who issued his report after personally hosting Pendergrast.<ref name=\"Acosta277\">{{Harvnb|Acosta|1991|p=77}}</ref> On March 1, 1825, the mayor of Guayama was informed that a suspicious sloop was anchoring at Boca del Infierno.<ref name=\"Acosta276\">{{Harvnb|Acosta|1991|p=276}}</ref> According to this version, Renovales himself requested the service of three vessels the following day. The most notable boats of this excursion were ''San Jos\u00e9 y Las Animas'', loaned for the mission, and ''Grampus,'' which belonged to the United States.<ref name=\"captura\"/> According to the officer, the strategy to capture the pirates was developed by Jos\u00e9 Ort\u00edz de la Renta, the mayor of the municipality of Ponce, and himself.<ref name=\"Acosta278\">{{Harvnb|Acosta|1991|p=78}}</ref> The mayor is also credited with the initiative of recruiting Sloat to command the [[reconnaissance]] mission.<ref name=\"captura\">{{Harvnb|Fern\u00e1ndez Valledor|1978|p=61}}</ref> Renovales uses the Spanish name of both ships in its report, also stating that lieutenant Pendergrast was not in command of ''San Jos\u00e9 y las Animas''.<ref name=\"Acosta277\"/> Renovales also claims Centeno as the owner of ''Anne'', without mention of Low.<ref name=\"Acosta278\"/> Three American officers and a doctor accompanied Sloat in this mission. Pendergrast, George A. Magrades and Francis Store plus a crew of twenty-three sailors were assigned to the mission.<ref name=\"captura\"/> The sailors were heavily armed and a new cannon was mounted on the ship. On the afternoon of the third day one of the ships located Cofres\u00ed, near the entrance of Boca del Infierno.<ref name=\"captura\"/> When the pirates spotted the vessel ''San Jos\u00e9 y Las Animas'', they confused it with a merchant ship and proceeded to attack it.<ref name=\"captura\"/> The crew of the ship hid until the pirates were within shooting distance, when they opened fire.<ref name=\"captura\"/> Both vessels exchanged cannon fire.

The Spanish government then sent military personnel to block all the roads and plains surrounding the area. Two of the search groups believed that the pirates would have to pass through a certain road in order to escape and planned to ambush them there. The pirates reached the location at 10:30&nbsp;p.m. and tried to escape, but were intercepted. According to Renovales, Manuel S\u00e1nchez de Ortiz and a group of militiamen found Cofres\u00ed and two cohorts near Patillas that night.<ref name=\"Acosta276\"/> Cofres\u00ed tried to defend himself with a knife, but his injury facilitated their capture.<ref name=\"Espa\u00f1a\"/> Juan Garay is still credited for disabling his arm with the blunderbuss during their confrontation.<ref name=\"num106\">{{Harvnb|Fern\u00e1ndez Valledor|1978|p=106}}</ref> His injuries were severe, but a doctor declared that they were not lethal.

The series focuses on three bears who try to navigate the human world and make friends. The Bears are the loud and adventurous Grizz (voiced by [[Eric Edelstein]]), the kind, yet nervous Panda (voiced by [[Bobby Moynihan]]) and the quiet and mysterious Ice Bear (voiced by [[Demetri Martin]]). Despite their social ineptitude, they manage to meet a wide variety of characters who make recurring appearances on the show with some also making single appearances. Among them include the Korean American prodigy Chloe Park (voiced by [[Charlyne Yi]]), the selfish and angry Nom Nom (voiced by [[Patton Oswalt]]), the socially inept Bigfoot Charlie (voiced by [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]]) and the tough and determined Ranger Tabes (voiced by [[Cameron Esposito]]).\n\n==Main characters==\n===Grizzly===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Grizzly\n| series             = \n| image              = \n| image_size         = \n| caption            = \n| first              = \"We Bare Bears\" (Pilot)<br>\"Our Stuff\" <br>(Actual)\n| last               = \n| creator            = [[Daniel Chong (animator)|Daniel Chong]]\n| portrayer          = \n| voice              = [[Eric Edelstein]] <br>(Original)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/We-Bare-Bears/Grizzly/|title=Voice of Grizzly|website=Behind the Voice Actors|accessdate=November 19, 2017}}</ref><br>[[Sam Lavagnino]] <br>(Young)\n| lbl1               = \n| data1              = \n| full_name          = \n| nickname           = Grizz\n| alias              = \n| species            = [[Grizzly bear]]\n| gender             = [[Male]]\n| color              = #804000\n}}\nGrizzly ('''nickname''' \"Grizz\") is a [[grizzly bear]]. The oldest and the de facto leader of the brothers, Grizz is a fun-loving bear who tends to get the others into random situations. Grizz is paradoxically highly sociable yet socially inept. Despite this, he is constantly wanting to meet new people and tries to befriend everyone he comes across. As a baby, he was rescued by a team of firemen who prevented him from falling off a tree-top during a storm (as such, he has a phobia of being in trees, which he states in \u201cPaperboyz\u201d). Afterward, he was adopted by a studio and starred in a Canadian sitcom called ''Family Troubles'' of which he was the star and known for his catchphrase \"That's not what I ordered!\" The show added a new character named Cousin Lorenzo whom Grizz immediately disliked. After winning in a race against him, Grizz suddenly realized that his fake family never offered true happiness or love and decided to leave the show to search for a family of his own, turning down fame and fortune in the process. It seems that he was younger than in most baby bear episodes according to the flashback pictures in \"Burrito.\" It was mentioned by Ice Bear that Grizz writes poems in English, as well as being a DJ and a beatboxer. He also possesses an alter ego as '''Crowbar Jones''' who is the star of a series of cheesy homemade action movies. Despite Grizz's desire to be loved by everyone, he still puts his brothers first and foremost and can't bear to be separated from them. He has a strange [[Love\u2013hate relationship|love-hate relationship]] with Nom Nom, whom he looks up to due to his popularity, yet acknowledges that he can be mean and sometimes untrustworthy. He also has an odd relationship with Ranger Tabes who usually calls on him to assist her with the Poppy Rangers, most likely due to the fact that since he is a grizzly bear and in theory, it makes sense that he would know a lot about nature, though it has shown that this is not the case. In the episode \"Bunnies\", Grizz is shown to be capable of speaking to other animals as most of them, who display self-awareness and occasional human behavior, aren't able to speak English.\n{{-}}\n\n===Panda===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Panda\n| series             = \n| image              = \n| image_size         = \n| caption            = \n| first              = \"We Bare Bears\" (Pilot)<br>\"Our Stuff\" <br>(Actual)\n| last               = \n| creator            = [[Daniel Chong (animator)|Daniel Chong]]\n| portrayer          = \n| voice              = [[Bobby Moynihan]] <br>(Original)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/We-Bare-Bears/Panda/|title=Voice of Panda|website=Behind the Voice Actors|accessdate=November 19, 2017}}</ref><br>Duncan Joiner<br>(Young)<br>Max Mitchell <br>(Young){{efn|name=\"joinermitchell|Joiner and Mitchell interchange voices.}}\n| lbl1               = \n| data1              = \n| full_name          = \n| nickname           = Pan Pan\n| alias              = \n| species            = [[Giant panda]]\n| gender             = [[Male]]\n| color              = Black\n}}\nPanda is a [[giant panda]]. He is the middle brother and is nicknamed Pan-Pan by Grizz. He is tender-hearted and gets embarrassed or anxious easily. It is revealed in \"Panda 2\" that Panda once lived in a controlled panda enclosure near [[Shanghai|Shanghai, China]]. A stuffed panda plush doll was dropped into his enclosure by one of the staff who noticed his loneliness and Panda befriended it by giving it a personality, which is mainly Panda voicing his deeper inner thoughts through the doll. Panda used the doll as a method of convincing himself to look through a window on the wall of the observatory, something he has always been curious about but never attempted to actually see. After using the doll to prop himself up, he finds a television set and becomes entranced by the moving pictures, and [[Anime]], which is most likely how Panda came to appreciate it later in his life. In an effort to show his \"friend\" the Television, Panda escapes the Habitat through a food chute but after being discovered he jumps out the window of the laboratory and hides in a [[bamboo]] delivery truck, which brings him into downtown Shanghai. Panda has a lot less self-confidence than his brothers. He is good with technology and uses that skill on online social media and dating sites, with which he finds little to no success. He is also the one who \"falls in love\" the most quickly. Often several times to court several human girls, most notably Lucy the produce girl who has platonic feelings for him. Panda also owns a [[Comfort object|security pillow]] in the form of '''Miki-Chan''', a pillow with a picture of an anime schoolgirl (or dakimakura) on it who he pretends to be his actual girlfriend. He is the most creative of the brothers, having written songs in \"[[YouTube|Everyone's Tube]]\", and undoubtedly the \"cutest\" as settled in \"Panda's Sneeze.\" Panda is a [[Ovo vegetarianism|ovo-vegeterian]] and has severe allergies to peanuts and cats. It has been revealed that Panda likes [[Anime]] and enjoys other things related to Japanese culture. He can be seen eating [[Ramen]] in multiple episodes, and in \"Hibernation\" he is seen eating a snack similar to [[Pocky]]. Panda also attends community college where he majors in art as revealed in \"Panda's Art.\"\n{{-}}\n\n===Ice Bear===\n{{redirect|Ice Bear|the type of bear|Polar bear||Ice Bears (disambiguation)}}\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Ice Bear\n| series             = \n| image              = \n| image_size         = ice bear \n| caption            = \n| first              = \"We Bare Bears\" (Pilot)<br>\"Our Stuff\"<br> (Actual)\n| last               = \n| creator            = [[Daniel Chong (animator)|Daniel Chong]]\n| portrayer          = \n| voice              = [[Demetri Martin]]<br>(Original)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/We-Bare-Bears/Ice-Bear/|title=Voice of Ice Bear|website=Behind the Voice Actors|accessdate=November 19, 2017}}</ref><br>Max Mitchell <br>(Young)\n| lbl1               = \n| data1              = \n| full_name          = \n| nickname           = Ice\n| alias              = \n| species            = [[Polar bear]]\n| gender             = [[Male]]\n| color              = #FFFFFF\n}}\nIce Bear is a [[polar bear]]. He is the youngest brother and is usually called bro. Ice Bear is often rather stoic and rarely speaks. When he does, he speaks mostly in the third person and says his name first instead of I as shown in \u00a8The Audition\u00a8. It is revealed in \"Yuri and the Bear\" that Ice Bear was raised by a Russian man named Yuri after his mother was killed by poachers. This is how he learned to speak Russian, and because Yuri spoke exclusively in the third person, this is most likely how Ice Bear obtained the habit. He earned accommodation by learning to chop wood, cook salmon, read maps, study calculus, knit, play [[Uno (card game)|Uno]] with standard cards and speak Russian and English, but was cut adrift into the ocean when Yuri had to let him go to save him from the poachers, and the ice floated away from the mainland. He is multilingual, having been shown to speak Korean, French, Japanese (on \"Losing Ice\")and Russian fluently.  Ice Bear also is able to speak to pigeons in the episode \"Our Stuff.\" He is also a skilled chef, dancer, piano player, a novice at robotics, charade player (on \"My Clique\"; it was revealed on \"The Island\" that he learned to speak very late, and originally used his charades skills to communicate), welder, poet (which he writes in French), roller skater and a [[Mixed martial arts|mixed martial artist]] (cited as [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] on \"Chloe\", but his skill set is closer to [[Taekwondo]] and [[judo]] with skills in [[Nunchaku]], [[Shuriken]] and swords). Ice Bear is the most composed of the brothers, always maintaining an \"ice-cool attitude\" in even the most awkward and embarrassing of situations. As seen in \"Losing Ice\" and \"Coffee Cave\", his brothers often take him for granted and are unappreciative of all the cooking and cleaning he does, although they eventually realize the error of their ways. Ice Bear sleeps in the refrigerator with a fire ax which he can use with either hand. Of the three bears, he has the closest relationship with Chloe, almost acting as a quiet big brother to her.\n{{-}}\n\n==Recurring characters==\n===Chloe Park===\n{{Infobox character\n| name             = Chloe Park\n| series           = \n| image            = \n| image_size       = \n| caption          = \n| first            = \"Chloe\"\n| last             = \n| creator          = [[Daniel Chong (animator)|Daniel Chong]]\n| portrayer        = \n| voice            = [[Charlyne Yi]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/We-Bare-Bears/Chloe/|title=Voice of Chloe|website=Behind the Voice Actors|accessdate=November 19, 2017}}</ref>\n| lbl1             = \n| data1            = \n| full_name        = \n| nickname         = \n| alias            = \n| species          = Human\n| gender           = Female\n}}\nChloe Park doesn't have many friends other than the bears and has a hard time relating to her much older peers. In \"My Clique,\" Chloe finally makes some friends with her college classmates, albeit with the help of the Bears. In the same episode, she is revealed to be [[Multilingualism|bilingual]]. Chloe devotes most of her time to studying in the hopes of having a secure future and becomes stressed when it seems like she is on the verge of failing as evidenced in \"The Library\" and \"Professor Lampwick\". Despite fully knowing that the bears mean well, their antics sometimes stress her too. At one point she was nearly driven insane by the Bears when they got sick in the episode \"Bear Flu\" due to them asking for things. Nevertheless, she adores them and will often rely on them for help. She has shown to be involved with their misadventures such as in \"The Demon\" and \"Road Trip\". She also has an interesting connection with Ice Bear due to his quiet persona meshed with her more open personality as seen in \"Chloe and Ice Bear\". Of the three bears, she is most often seen with him.\n\n===Nom Nom===\n{{Infobox character\n| name             = Nom Nom\n| series           = \n| image            = \n| image_size       = \n| caption          = \n| first            = \"Viral Video\"\n| last             = \n| creator          = [[Daniel Chong (animator)|Daniel Chong]]\n| portrayer        = \n| voice            = [[Patton Oswalt]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/We-Bare-Bears/Nom-Nom/|title=Voice of Nom Nom|website=Behind the Voice Actors|accessdate=November 19, 2017}}</ref>\n| lbl1             = \n| data1            = \n| full_name         = \n| nickname         = \n| alias            = \n| species          = [[Koala]]\n| gender           = Male\n}}\nNom Nom is a misanthropic self-hating [[koala]]. He is a famous internet star, known for his \"cute\" videos and the main antagonist during the two first seasons, starting a slow redemption from the third season onward. While he doesn't talk in any of his videos, Nom Nom often swears angrily towards everyone he comes in contact with, especially the bears. Grizzly imposes him enough to talk to him and admits that he liked his video, but Nom Nom is self-centered and more concerned with materialistic things, and is very selfish and lashes out at anyone who he doesn't like. One example being in \"The Nom Nom Show\" where he was unwilling to share the spotlight with the Bears, despite the positive reception they received. In \"Viral Video,\" Nom Nom says that he does not want any friends because he finds them unimportant and too loud, and proves his point by kicking Grizz out of his limo. His temper is so short, he lashes out at anyone who even slightly annoys him. In \"Anger Management\", it's revealed that Grizz's hugs genuinely calm him to the point of making him optimistic and friendly. He has further shown a more tolerant side. In \"Nom Nom's Entourage,\" he saves a picture of his time with the Bears and in \"Kyle,\" opened his home to another koala who claimed to be his brother. In \"Vacation\", he finally admits that Grizz is the closest thing to a friend he has. In \"Crowbar Jones: Origins\", Nom Nom is shown to be more tolerant of Grizz though he still finds him a nuisance.\n\n===Charlie===\n{{Infobox character\n| name             = Charlie\n| series           = \n| image            = \n| image_size       = \n| caption          = \n| first            = \"Charlie\"\n| last             = \n| creator          = [[Daniel Chong (animator)|Daniel Chong]]\n| portrayer        = \n| voice            = [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]]<ref name=\"WBBCast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/we-bare-bears-gets-3rd-season-at-cartoon-network-940884|title='We Bare Bears' Gets 3rd Season at Cartoon Network|last=Greenho|first=Caitlin|website=The Hollywood Reporter|date=October 25, 2016}}</ref>\n| lbl1             = \n| data1            = \n| full_name         = \n| nickname         = \n| alias            = \n| species          = [[Bigfoot]]\n| gender           = Male\n}}\nCharlie is a friendly [[bigfoot]] who wanders alone around the San Francisco woods until he meets the Bears in \"Charlie,\" where they agree to let him live in their cave for a little while via a website called CaveShare. While it is unknown how old he is, he is apparently more than a century old as he is shown living as far back as 1913 as seen in \"El Oso\". It is revealed that, due to his life of solitude, he is socially inept and doesn't know how to be a good friend. This results in him unintentionally causing havoc for the Bears whenever he hangs out with them. He is also constantly harassed by humans trying to get pictures of him, which results in him becoming [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] towards them and developing a fear of cameras. He has on more than one occasion befriended someone other than the Bears. In \"El Oso\", he made friends with the titular character and in \"Rescue Ranger\", he mildly learns to put up with Tabes, but eventually accepts her as his friend in \"Charlie & Tabes\" after getting her name wrong numerous times (Tubes, Tebs, etc.). In \"Hurricane Hal\", his actual home is shown to be a broken-down car while in \"Christmas Parties\" he lives in a giant tree. In the episode \"Charlie Ball,\" we see that Charlie is extremely skilled at ball-handling and that his height makes him perfect for [[basketball]]. In \"Charlie's Big Foot,\" Charlie is revealed to have blue-colored blood and a very jointed body, mostly due to being harmed by the wilderness which he views as perfectly normal, and in \"Bubble\", it is revealed that his natural fur is actually gold colored making him look handsome and majestic. He also sees Panda as his best friend and usually tries to show off new discoveries and his \"decor\" to him over the other two. Besides Panda, he also is friends with a common snake as seen in \"Charlie and the Snake\".\n\n===Ranger Tabes===\n{{Infobox character\n| name             = Ranger Tabes\n| series           = \n| image            = \n| image_size       = \n| caption          = \n| first            = \"Ranger Tabes\"\n| last             = \n| creator          = [[Daniel Chong (animator)|Daniel Chong]]\n| portrayer        = \n| voice            = [[Cameron Esposito]]<ref name=\"WBBCast\" />\n| lbl1             = \n| data1            = \n| full_name         = Dana Tabes\n| nickname         = \n| alias            = \n| species          = Human\n| gender           = Female\n}}\nRanger Dana Tabes is a [[National Park Service ranger|park ranger]]. She lives in a trailer-style mobile home located in the park where the Bears live. They first meet her in \"Ranger Tabes\" where she helps them locate a missing package. She is shown to be overly confident, persistent and even downright obsessive with wanting to help people. Her obsession is explored in \"Creature Mysteries\" where she tries to capture and prove Charlie's existence. In that same episode, it's revealed that her mother was also a park ranger and the one who inspired her to become one. Her obsession is also prominent in \"Poppy Rangers\" where she was willing to lead a team of girl scouts, called the Poppy Rangers, into a dangerous cave, against Grizzly's wishes. Despite her quirky personality, the Bears consider her as one of their closest friends and praise her to some extent as seen in \"Ranger Norm\". Out of all of them, Tabes seems to coerce with Grizz the most and usually has him around as an assistant to help in leading the Poppy Rangers. Based on how much she relies on him, they seem to have mutual respect for each for other. In \"Ranger Games\", it is revealed that she has a rival in the form of '''Ranger Zhao''' (voiced by [[Ming-Na Wen]]) who leads her own group of girl scouts called the Ivy Rangers. In \"Bear Squad\", Tabes is shown to possess deduction skills to the level of identifying animals and people by a limited amount of evidence. In the same episode, it is revealed that she is banned from doing any ranger work in the city. Over time, Tabes is shown to have calmed down a bit, though she still takes her job very seriously. She has even learned to be more surveillant with her duties and upon knowledge of Charlie's true existence has opted to watch and protect him from afar. By the end of \"Rescue Ranger\", she mildly becomes friends with Charlie and, like the Bears, decides to keep him a secret. Eventually, the two become good friends after he helps her finds her dog Kirk in \"Tabes & Charlie\".\n\n===Lucy===\n{{Infobox character\n| name             = Lucy\n| series           = \n| image            = \n| image_size       = \n| caption          = \n| first            = \"Panda's Date\"\n| last             = \n| creator          = [[Daniel Chong (animator)|Daniel Chong]]\n| portrayer        = \n| voice            = [[Ellie Kemper]]<ref name=\"WBBCast\" />\n| lbl1             = \n| data1            = \n| full_name         = \n| nickname         = \n| alias            = \n| species          = Human\n| gender           = Female\n}}\nLucy is a friend to the Bears and runs a produce delivery service called ''Lucy's Produce''. She first appears in \"Panda's Date\" where she takes an immediate liking to the Bears and their goofy personalities. Panda quickly (as usual) develops a crush on her, but she seems to be unaware of his feelings. She finally returns in season 3 episode, \"Lucy's Brother\" where it is revealed that she delivers fruit to the Bears every Friday. In that same episode, she is shown to have a younger brother named Clifford whom she cares for and worries over immensely. She is also shown to be a terrible dancer, something which Panda was nervous telling her about, but she learns to accept after he realizes how important it is, to be honest, and faithful to her. Despite being oblivious to Panda's feelings for her, the two share a mutual friendship. In \"The Limo\", Lucy begins dating '''Kale''' (voiced by [[Omid Abtahi]]) which upsets Panda, but he ultimately accepts as her happiness is what matters.\n{{-}}\n\n==Minor characters==\n===Pigeon Cartel===\nThe Pigeon Cartel is composed of pigeons who are actually an underground illegal trading ring. They are the closest thing to arch-enemies the Bears have and first appeared in \"Our Stuff\". They stole the Bears' items, which included Grizz's wallet, Panda's cell phone and Ice Bear's ninja stars, along with a wide variety of other expensive and important items around the city. The Bears unintentionally landed in their hideout where the cartel or at least a subgroup of them were arrested. In \"Pigeons\", they are revealed to have a member in their ranks named '''Brenda''' whom Grizz ends up befriending. Brenda actually tricks Grizz into helping her free her gang from prison, or rather the pigeon coup inside the prison, she ultimately has a change of heart due to Grizz's kindness.\n\n===Chloe's Family===\n* '''Mr. Park''' (voiced by Jinkoo Jeong) is Chloe's father. He was initially reserved about Chloe hanging out with the bears, but warms up to their presence in \"Slumber Party\". He is bilingual.\n* '''Mrs. Park''' (voiced by [[Niki Yang]]) is Chloe's mother. She is very supportive of Chloe's friendship with the bears as evidenced when she makes sandwiches for them in \"Chloe and Ice Bear\". She is bilingual.\n* '''Jon Park''' (voiced by Bert Youn) is Chloe's cousin. He appeared in \"Christmas Parties\" where is shown to be rather cocky and doesn't get along with Chloe very well. He has a habit of pranking her every chance he gets and always gets away with it.\n\n===Farmer===\nFarmer (voiced by Kyler Spears) is Nom Nom's personal [[bodyguard]]. He was initially known as '''Bodyguard #1''' due to his primary task of protecting Nom Nom who in turn didn't think much of him. However, this all changed in the episode \"Kyle\" where it is shown that Farmer genuinely cares for Nom Nom's security when he suspected that the titular koala was trying to scam Nom Nom. After rescuing his employer, Nom Nom became more aware of him and asked for his real name, calling him Farmer from that point on.\n\n===Rangers===\n*'''Kirk''' is a dog that Tabes was given as a Christmas present by the Bears in \"Christmas Parties\". In \"Lunch with Tabes,\" he is shown to be rather clever and mischievous. In \"Tabes & Charlie\", he is revealed to have fathered three pups with a wolf.\n* '''Ranger Martinez''' (voiced by [[Keith Ferguson (voice actor)|Keith Ferguson]]) is Tabes' partner. He has been a park ranger since Tabes was a child and was initially her mother's partner. In his old age, he is always prone to sleep and is shown to be rather laid back. He is also very friendly with the Bears.\n* '''Poppy Rangers''' are the team of girl scouts that Ranger Tabes, and to a certain extent Grizz, lead in a variety of tasks and activities. Their ranks include '''Diaz''' (voiced by Marissa Soto), a \"curious and witty\" girl who aspires to be a [[biologist]]; '''Parker''' (voiced by Danity Harris), a \"quiet and confidant\" girl who aspires to be an [[Aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineer]]; '''Murphy''' (voiced by Stella Balick-Karrer), a \"cheerful and patient\" girl who aspires to be a [[geologist]]; '''Nguyen''' (voiced by Audrey Huynh) another \"quiet and confident\" girl who aspires to be a [[principal dancer]] and '''Wallace''' (voiced by Cate Gragnani) an eye-patch wearing \"fearless...born leader\" who aspires to be a park ranger like Tabes. It is unknown whether Wallace has only injured her eye or lost it, only stating that \"it was worth it\". The girls unanimously trust Tabes' leadership and advice, but also adore Grizz whom they affectionately call 'Bear Guy', even though they are well aware of his flaws such as in \"Ranger Games\" and even admit that he is terrible at leading as seen in \"Lord of the Poppies\". In the former episode, their rivals, the '''Ivy Rangers''', as well as Wallace's younger sister '''Chuck Wallace''' are introduced.\n\n===Clifford===\nClifford (voiced by Hudson West) is Lucy's younger brother. He has many allergies and has trouble socializing with others. He constantly wanders off and is very shy. He starts to like Panda once he is considered a friend. He is also very defensive of his sister, seen as he is aware that many boys use him as an attempt to get close to her and gets mad at Panda for doing so. Fortunately, he and Panda reconcile and consider each other close friends.\n\n===Darrell===\nDarrell Saragosa (voiced by [[Mel Rodriguez]]) a 35-year-old man, is a friend to the Bears and owns a [[mousepad]] store called ''Super Rad Mousepads''. He first appears in \"Losing Ice\" where he answers a want ad from Grizz and Panda asking for a replacement for the missing Ice Bear. He happily takes the job, despite the harsh conditions, and later makes them realize their error in taking Ice Bear for granted. He lives with his grandma, Emma, who apparently does most of his cooking. He returns in \"Bear Lift\" where the Bears help his fledgling business. It's also shown that in his youth his store was once booming and brought people together, but over time it began to wear away. By the end, the Bears help bring the store back due to its 'retro' appeal. In \"Best Bears\" Darrell marries '''Sofia''' (voiced by Brigitte Kali Canales), a [[hang gliding]] instructor and [[fashion design]]er who thinks that he and the Bears are cool.\n\n===Yana===\nYana (voiced by [[Margarita Levieva]]) is a Russian woman with dark connections to Ice Bear. She is an aggressive woman with a sentimental side to her as well. She and Ice Bear have known each other for a long time and have been on missions together for unknown reasons. Yana first appeared in \"Icy Nights\" where she briefly helped Ice Bear look for his Roomba. She returns in \"Icy Nights II\" where she is kidnapped by Barry, a tech genius who is after the Roomba. At the end of the episode, it's revealed that Yana's father is Yuri, the same man who raised Ice Bear. It's unknown whether Yuri is still in contact with her or knows that she's still alive.\n\n===Barry===\nBarry Charles (voiced by [[Kevin McHale (actor)|Kevin McHale]]) is a technical expert and Ice Bear's nemesis. He leads a gang of techies and is involved in illegal activities. His main goal is to steal Ice Bear's Roomba due to the technical specifications it possesses. The reason for doing this is so that he can earn the approval of his father, something that is a sore spot for him.\n\n===Marie===\nMarie (voiced by Edi Patterson) is a web show host that the Bears occasionally watch. She hosts the show ''Mornings with Marie'' off from the website ''[[YouTube|Everyone's Tube]]''. She tends to report on all the latest crazes and current things usually from the internet such as Nom Nom and Panda's sudden popularity like in \"Panda's Sneeze\". Marie also hosts the ''Cute-Off'', a competition where two animals from viral videos participate.\n\n===The Bros===\nThe Bros are the human doppelgangers to the Bears. They first appeared in \"Panda's Friend\". They fittingly display qualities similar to, but also superior to the actual bears.\n* '''Tom''' (voiced by Bert Youn) is Panda's counterpart. He is a small, presumably Asian, man, who wears glasses and typically wears a black hoodie with a white stripe going through it so as to resemble a panda. He, just like Panda, loves Korean dramas and anime and is apparently 97% similar. He becomes way too attached to Panda and kidnaps him from his home and moves him into his apartment. When he realizes how obsessive he has become he leaves (or rather falls) and meets his other two roommates Griff and Isaac. He is much more stable with the two and in \"Bro Brawl\" implies that they are his only real family as well. In that same episode, he states that he has a girlfriend.\n* '''Griff''' (voiced by Eric Edelstein in \"Panda's Friend\" and later by Faruq Tauheed) is Grizz's counterpart. Griff is a \"renegade\" cop, later revealed to be a mall cop, who loves his job and is capable of helping people, as opposed to Grizz who has no job and, while helpful, is socially inept. He is a well built African-American man who usually wears a blue shirt. He seems to care a lot about his roommates and in his first appearance was nervous about losing his home for not meeting the roommate quota until Tom literally dropped in. In \"The Mall\", he is shown to be very friendly with Grizz.\n* '''Isaac''' (voiced by Demetri Martin) is Ice Bear's counterpart. Isaac is a \"five-star chef\" who, much like Ice Bear, is tall and quiet. He wears a white hoodie with the hood always over his head and his blonde bangs hanging out. When he speaks he follows Ice Bear's speech mannerisms by talking in the third person. He sleeps in a walk-in closet, like how Ice Bear sleeps in a fridge and also seems to possess many outlandish abilities. In \"Bro Brawl\" he one up Ice Bear due to not having any hair in his food. In \"The Mall\", he and Ice Bear seem to view each other as rivals.\n\n===Captain Craboo===\nCaptain Craboo is the Bears' pet crab whom they adopted in the episode \"Emergency\". He actually came from the supermarket which Grizz went to buy food and immediately fell in love with the crab. Unfortunately, it pinches onto Ice Bear's ear causing him to become catatonic and deranged. Grizz and Panda eventually get Craboo off of Ice Bear and resort to giving him tiny mitts so that he doesn't pinch Ice Bear again. He returns in \"Captain Craboo\" where it is revealed that he has been gone for quite some time and that Ice Bear still has not forgiven him. However, the two later make up. In that same episode, Craboo attacks Nom Nom, making him a wanted fugitive. By the end of the episode, Craboo solemnly leaves the Bears before they release him into the ocean, especially Ice Bear, who took his departure the hardest.\n\n===The Mailman===\nThe Mailman (voiced by Keith Ferguson) is a friendly [[Postal worker|mailman]] that occasionally visits the Bears. He first appears in \"Nom Nom\" where he delivers a toy helicopter to the Bears. He falls into a pit where Ice Bear was trapped by Nom Nom. He shows that he doesn't mind the situation and also didn't seem to mind being left there. He returns in \"Crowbar Jones\" where he was invited to see the titular movie that Grizz had made. He was easily impressed by it and based on his reactions, simply wishes to have friends. In \"Citizen Tabes,\" he was also impressed with Tabes' packaging to the point that he was willing to listen to her ramble about how she did it. In \"I, Butler\", he was interested in playing basketball with the bears even though he creepily appeared from behind their bushes.\n\n===Mad Scientist===\nMad Scientist (voiced by [[Jason Mantzoukas]]) is an unnamed scientist who is constantly plotting against the government. He first appears in \"Grizz Helps\" where Grizz answers a want ad for someone to aid him in traveling back in time. He was going to use a chicken named Mark as a test subject and Grizz had to rescue him for its owner. The scientist reappeared in \"Summer Love\" with a pelican assistant named Gary and tried to use a body swapping machine on Panda. He revealed that he once had a girlfriend named Amelia who joined the space program, implying one of the reasons he kept conspiring against the government.\n\n===Ralph===\nRalph (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]) is a [[yeti]] who enjoys playing cruel pranks on humans and animals. He first appears in \"Ralph\" where Charlie befriends him due to being a creature just like him, despite the Bears gaining distrust of Ralph due to his mean nature. He ends up abandoning Charlie when the latter refuses to let a group of humans fall off a bridge as part of a prank, considering him a \"snooze-fest\". He appears again in \"Ice Cave\" where he takes over the Bears' cave and freezes its interior, ruling it like a king. He usually puts Charlie down due to his lanky body and pushes over personality, but Charlie stands up to him and puts Ralph in his place.\n\n===Dr. Clark===\nDr. Clark (voiced by Avery Kidd Waddell) is a medical nurse and Nom Nom's personal doctor. He first appeared in \"Charlie's Big Foot\" where he treated Charlie's foot after it broke. He is shown to have a very unusual [[Doctor\u2013patient relationship|bedside manner]] in that he has a very lethargic and slightly disinterested way of speaking. However, he is shown to take his job seriously and looked aghast at seeing Charlie's blood. He returned in \"Vacation\" where he acted as Nom Nom's personal doctor. His diagnosis was that he was stressed and prescribed that he take a vacation with Grizz acting as his coach. Once again, Dr. Clark delivered all of this in a lethargic disinterested attitude. In \"Braces\", he is revealed to also serve as a dentist and possesses numerous doctoral degrees.\n\n==Guest characters==\n===Paul and Annie===\nPaul (voiced by [[Lou Ferrigno]]) and Annie (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle|Grey Griffin]]) are a married couple that appeared in \"Yard Sale\". Annie is an average looking red-haired woman who was heavily [[Pregnancy|pregnant]]. She sold a box of free things to the Bears at a yard sale she had set up. The things in question were large foam toy fists (which Grizz begins wearing only for them to get stuck to his paws) her husband Paul's phone (which Panda mistakenly takes and begins sending texts unknowingly to Annie) and a pregnancy workout DVD (which Ice Bear begins watching and using to get in better shape). Paul, who resembles a large well-built man, is offended at Panda using his phone and possessively threatens him, but becomes nervous and faints when Annie goes into labor. The Bears band together to get Annie and Paul to the hospital where she successfully gives birth to a baby boy that somehow manages to removes the fake hands off of Grizz, much to everyone's surprise since he had difficulty removing them before.\n\n===Professor Lampwick===\nProfessor Lampwick (voiced by [[Malcolm McDowell]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/We-Bare-Bears/Professor-Lampwick/|title=Voice of Professor Lampwick|website=Behind the Voice Actors|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}</ref> is Chloe's science professor at the university and he appeared in his self-titled episode. Lampwick is a tall, lean older man with a sinister and stern personality. He has a notorious reputation for being a difficult professor who refuses second chances with his students. Chloe gets so intimidated by him that she fails her course causing her much grief. However, the Bears decide to kidnap him and bring him back to the cave in an effort to force him to give Chloe a second chance. Lampwick proves to be crafty as he turns the Bears against one another, forcing Chloe to step up and demand a second chance, which he grants. When Chloe passes, Lampwick reveals that he untied his own bonds and was just testing her, admitting that she wasn't the first student to \"kidnap [him] over a grade.\" He briefly returns in \"Hurricane Hal\" where he is shown to have an omniscient presence as he was capable of explaining exactly what each of the Bears was doing and apparently is aware of who Charlie is.\n\n===Andy Bangs===\nAndrew \"Andy\" Bangs (voiced by [[Bo Burnham]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/We-Bare-Bears/Andy-Bangs/|title=Voice of Andy Bangs|website=Behind the Voice Actors|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}</ref> is a child internet star and Nom Nom's main rival who appeared in \"Nom Nom's Entourage\". Andy's name is a pun on the fact that his videos consist mostly of him popping out of places and shouting \"Bang!\" and that he has [[Hair coloring|dyed]] [[Bangs (hair)|bangs]]. He takes great pleasure in humiliating and outsmarting Nom Nom using his trademark surprise gimmick. One thing he has over Nom Nom, is the fact that he is constantly surrounded by his entourage, which Nom Nom lacks forcing him to hire the Bears. Nom eventually manages to get back at Andy by surprising him with his signature \"Bang!\".\n\n===Karla and Dave===\nKarla (voiced by [[Felicia Day]]) and Dave (voiced by [[Jake Johnson]]) are a pair of castaways that the baby Bears encounter in \"The Island\". The Bears are rescued from quicksand by Karla and Dave who have been shipwrecked on the island for some unspecified amount of time. All that is known is that they came separately. Karla mostly misses her sister whom she loves very much and forms a motherly bond with the baby Bears, while Dave displays a slightly disinterested attitude. It eventually becomes clear, that Dave has been misleading Karla and the Bears and that he wants Karla to stay with him alone. The Bears rescue Karla from Dave and escape on an inflatable raft they found, leaving Dave all alone. Karla is rescued by a passing ship, but the Bears float on until they end up in [[Japan]].\n\n===Yuri===\nYuri (voiced by [[Darin De Paul]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/We-Bare-Bears/Yuri/|title=Voice of Yuri|website=Behind the Voice Actors|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}</ref> is an old Russian man who lived out in the arctic as a [[hermit]] [[Survivalism|survivalist]], until he met baby Ice Bear in the episode \"Yuri and the Bear\". A tall, large bearded man who much like Ice Bear, had a tendency to speak in the third person, Yuri lived in a life of solitude after losing his family to some unknown causes. He took Ice Bear under his wing, after some reluctance, and taught him everything that he knew. They were confronted by a hunter, who is implied to have killed Ice Bear's family, and Yuri is forced to cut Ice Bear away from land to save him. In \"Icy Nights II\", it is revealed that Yuri is Yana's father.\n\n===Wyatt===\nWyatt (voiced by [[Ron Funches]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bubbleblabber.com/review-we-bare-bears-road-trip/|title=Review: We Bare Bears \"Road Trip\"|last=Schwarz|first=John|website=Bubble Babbler|date=August 7, 2017|accessdate=February 3, 2018}}</ref> is the overly kind leader of a [[Outlaw motorcycle club|bike gang]] in \"Road Trip\". Wyatt is a random individual that Chloe and the Bears encounter while on their way to see the meteor shower. He displays a slightly lethargic, yet kind and joking attitude that clicks with Grizz, Panda, and Chloe but annoys Ice Bear. He claims that he lost his bike gang and is allowed to ride with them, much to Ice Bear's chagrin. Eventually, Ice Bear manages to take off without him only to have the car run out of gas. Wyatt shows up with his gang and they offer to share their gas with them. Later on, he joins Chloe and the Bears in watching the meteor shower.\n\n===Warren and Faye===\nWarren (voiced by [[Robert Clotworthy]]) and Faye (voiced by [[Frances Conroy]]) are a friendly elderly couple who live in a [[Recreational vehicle|RV]] in the woods somewhere near where the Bears live. They appear in the episode \"Neighbors\" and are depicted as an overly kind couple who immediately take joy in conversing with the Bears. While Panda and Ice Bear find them pleasant, Grizz finds them uncomfortably nice as the two are shown touching and examining the Bears. The two begin taking pictures of the Bears going about their day and it is revealed that they keep numerous knives and other cutting instruments, giving the impression that they plan on cutting up or eating the Bears. However, it is revealed that the two are wood carving fanatics and simply wanted the Bears to model for them for their hobby. They forgive the Bears for their snooping. Warren and Fay are named after [[Warren Beatty]] and [[Faye Dunaway]].\n\n===Esteller===\nEsteller (voiced by [[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]]) is a famous pop song singer who Panda and Tom are huge fans of. She appears in the episode \"The Mall\" where she arrives at the titular location to personally sign autographs for her fans, whom she affectionately refers to as her \"starlings\". Esteller is moved by Panda and Tom's willingness to let their shirts be ruined so that they can get a chance to meet her in person. She thanks them and gives them new signed shirts while politely berating the other fans that tried to ruin their shirts to begin with by telling them, \"Don't be jerks.\" Estelle sings the series' theme song and had previously appeared as herself in the episode \"More Everyone's Tube\" where she sang the full version.\n\n===Charles Barkley===\n[[Charles Barkley]] as himself appears in the episode \"Baby Bears Can't Jump\". He is a famous basketball player that the bears admire when they find a basketball card about him.\n\n===T-Pain===\n[[T-Pain]] as himself appears in the episode \"The Limo\". He is a rapper. It is revealed that he watched Grizz's Crowbar Jones series. Panda is a fan of the rapper.\n\n===Monsta X===\n[[Monsta X]] as themselves appear in the episode \"Panda's Birthday\". The group comprises seven members: Shownu, Wonho, Minhyuk, Kihyun, Hyungwon, Jooheon, and I.M. Panda is a fan of the K-pop group, but Grizz and Ice Bear are not, since they mixed up the group with another metal rock group called Monta S.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Cartoon Network}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:We Bare Bears}}\n[[Category: Cartoon Network Studios series and characters]]\n[[Category:Lists of characters in American television animation]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2015|*, We Bare Bears]]\n[[Category: Fictional polar bears]]\n[[Category:Fictional pandas]]\n[[Category:We Bare Bears]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{notability|date=December 2017}}\n{{more citations needed|date=October 2018}}\n}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''We Bare Bears'' characters}}\n\nThe American [[List of animated television series|animated television series]] ''[[We Bare Bears]]'' features a cast created by [[Daniel Chong (animator)|Daniel Chong]]. The series focuses on three bears who try to navigate the human world and make friends. The Bears are the loud and adventurous Grizz (voiced by [[Eric Edelstein]]), the kind, yet nervous Panda (voiced by [[Bobby Moynihan]]) and the quiet and mysterious Ice Bear (voiced by [[Demetri Martin]]). Despite their social ineptitude, they manage to meet a wide variety of characters who make recurring appearances on the show with some also making single appearances. Among them include the Korean American prodigy Chloe Park (voiced by [[Charlyne Yi]]), the selfish and angry Nom Nom (voiced by [[Patton Oswalt]]), the socially inept Bigfoot Charlie (voiced by [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]]) and the tough and determined Ranger Tabes (voiced by [[Cameron Esposito]]).\n\n==Main characters==\n===Grizzly===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Grizzly\n| series             = \n| image              = \n| image_size         = \n| caption            = \n| first              = \"We Bare Bears\" (Pilot)<br>\"Our Stuff\" <br>(Actual)\n| last               = \n| creator            = [[Daniel Chong (animator)|Daniel Chong]]\n| portrayer          = \n| voice              = [[Eric Edelstein]] <br>(Original)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/We-Bare-Bears/Grizzly/|title=Voice of Grizzly|website=Behind the Voice Actors|accessdate=November 19, 2017}}</ref><br>[[Sam Lavagnino]] <br>(Young)\n| lbl1               = \n| data1              = \n| full_name          = \n| nickname           = Grizz\n| alias              = \n| species            = [[Grizzly bear]]\n| gender             = [[Male]]\n| color              = #804000\n}}\nGrizzly ('''nickname''' \"Grizz\") is a [[grizzly bear]]. The oldest and the de facto leader of the brothers, Grizz is a fun-loving bear who tends to get the others into random situations. Grizz is paradoxically highly sociable yet socially inept. Despite this, he is constantly wanting to meet new people and tries to befriend everyone he comes across. As a baby, he was rescued by a team of firemen who prevented him from falling off a tree-top during a storm (as such, he has a phobia of being in trees, which he states in \u201cPaperboyz\u201d). Afterward, he was adopted by a studio and starred in a Canadian sitcom called ''Family Troubles'' of which he was the star and known for his catchphrase \"That's not what I ordered!\" The show added a new character named Cousin Lorenzo whom Grizz immediately disliked. After winning in a race against him, Grizz suddenly realized that his fake family never offered true happiness or love and decided to leave the show to search for a family of his own, turning down fame and fortune in the process. It seems that he was younger than in most baby bear episodes according to the flashback pictures in \"Burrito.\" It was mentioned by Ice Bear that Grizz writes poems in English, as well as being a DJ and a beatboxer. He also possesses an alter ego as '''Crowbar Jones''' who is the star of a series of cheesy homemade action movies. Despite Grizz's desire to be loved by everyone, he still puts his brothers first and foremost and can't bear to be separated from them. He has a strange [[Love\u2013hate relationship|love-hate relationship]] with Nom Nom, whom he looks up to due to his popularity, yet acknowledges that he can be mean and sometimes untrustworthy. He also has an odd relationship with Ranger Tabes who usually calls on him to assist her with the Poppy Rangers, most likely due to the fact that since he is a grizzly bear and in theory, it makes sense that he would know a lot about nature, though it has shown that this is not the case. In the episode \"Bunnies\", Grizz is shown to be capable of speaking to other animals as most of them, who display self-awareness and occasional human behavior, aren't able to speak English.\n{{-}}\n\n===Panda===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Panda\n| series             = \n| image              = \n| image_size         = \n| caption            = \n| first              = \"We Bare Bears\" (Pilot)<br>\"Our Stuff\" <br>(Actual)\n| last               = \n| creator            = [[Daniel Chong (animator)|Daniel Chong]]\n| portrayer          = \n| voice              = [[Bobby Moynihan]] <br>(Original)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/We-Bare-Bears/Panda/|title=Voice of Panda|website=Behind the Voice Actors|accessdate=November 19, 2017}}</ref><br>Duncan Joiner<br>(Young)<br>Max Mitchell <br>(Young){{efn|name=\"joinermitchell|Joiner and Mitchell interchange voices.}}\n| lbl1               = \n| data1              = \n| full_name          = \n| nickname           = Pan Pan\n| alias              = \n| species            = [[Giant panda]]\n| gender             = [[Male]]\n| color              = Black\n}}\nPanda is a [[giant panda]]. He is the middle brother and is nicknamed Pan-Pan by Grizz. He is tender-hearted and gets embarrassed or anxious easily. It is revealed in \"Panda 2\" that Panda once lived in a controlled panda enclosure near [[Shanghai|Shanghai, China]]. A stuffed panda plush doll was dropped into his enclosure by one of the staff who noticed his loneliness and Panda befriended it by giving it a personality, which is mainly Panda voicing his deeper inner thoughts through the doll. Panda used the doll as a method of convincing himself to look through a window on the wall of the observatory, something he has always been curious about but never attempted to actually see. After using the doll to prop himself up, he finds a television set and becomes entranced by the moving pictures, and [[Anime]], which is most likely how Panda came to appreciate it later in his life. In an effort to show his \"friend\" the Television, Panda escapes the Habitat through a food chute but after being discovered he jumps out the window of the laboratory and hides in a [[bamboo]] delivery truck, which brings him into downtown Shanghai. Panda has a lot less self-confidence than his brothers. He is good with technology and uses that skill on online social media and dating sites, with which he finds little to no success. He is also the one who \"falls in love\" the most quickly. Often several times to court several human girls, most notably Lucy the produce girl who has platonic feelings for him. Panda also owns a [[Comfort object|security pillow]] in the form of '''Miki-Chan''', a pillow with a picture of an anime schoolgirl (or dakimakura) on it who he pretends to be his actual girlfriend. He is the most creative of the brothers, having written songs in \"[[YouTube|Everyone's Tube]]\", and undoubtedly the \"cutest\" as settled in \"Panda's Sneeze.\" Panda is a [[Ovo vegetarianism|ovo-vegeterian]] and has severe allergies to peanuts and cats. It has been revealed that Panda likes [[Anime]] and enjoys other things related to Japanese culture. He can be seen eating [[Ramen]] in multiple episodes, and in \"Hibernation\" he is seen eating a snack similar to [[Pocky]]. Panda also attends community college where he majors in art as revealed in \"Panda's Art.\"\n{{-}}\n\n===Ice Bear===\n{{redirect|Ice Bear|the type of bear|Polar bear||Ice Bears (disambiguation)}}\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Ice Bear\n| series             = \n| image              = \n| image_size         = ice bear \n| caption            = \n| first              = \"We Bare Bears\" (Pilot)<br>\"Our Stuff\"<br> (Actual)\n| last               = \n| creator            = [[Daniel Chong (animator)|Daniel Chong]]\n| portrayer          = \n| voice              = [[Demetri Martin]]<br>(Original)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/We-Bare-Bears/Ice-Bear/|title=Voice of Ice Bear|website=Behind the Voice Actors|accessdate=November 19, 2017}}</ref><br>Max Mitchell <br>(Young)\n| lbl1               = \n| data1              = \n| full_name          = \n| nickname           = Ice\n| alias              = \n| species            = [[Polar bear]]\n| gender             = [[Male]]\n| color              = #FFFFFF\n}}\nIce Bear is a [[polar bear]]. He is the youngest brother and is usually called bro. Ice Bear is often rather stoic and rarely speaks. When he does, he speaks mostly in the third person and says his name first instead of I as shown in \u00a8The Audition\u00a8. It is revealed in \"Yuri and the Bear\" that Ice Bear was raised by a Russian man named Yuri after his mother was killed by poachers. This is how he learned to speak Russian, and because Yuri spoke exclusively in the third person, this is most likely how Ice Bear obtained the habit. He earned accommodation by learning to chop wood, cook salmon, read maps, study calculus, knit, play [[Uno (card game)|Uno]] with standard cards and speak Russian and English, but was cut adrift into the ocean when Yuri had to let him go to save him from the poachers, and the ice floated away from the mainland. He is multilingual, having been shown to speak Korean, French, Japanese (on \"Losing Ice\")and Russian fluently.  Ice Bear also is able to speak to pigeons in the episode \"Our Stuff.\" He is also a skilled chef, dancer, piano player, a novice at robotics, charade player (on \"My Clique\"; it was revealed on \"The Island\" that he learned to speak very late, and originally used his charades skills to communicate), welder, poet (which he writes in French), roller skater and a [[Mixed martial arts|mixed martial artist]] (cited as [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] on \"Chloe\", but his skill set is closer to [[Taekwondo]] and [[judo]] with skills in [[Nunchaku]], [[Shuriken]] and swords). Ice Bear is the most composed of the brothers, always maintaining an \"ice-cool attitude\" in even the most awkward and embarrassing of situations. As seen in \"Losing Ice\" and \"Coffee Cave\", his brothers often take him for granted and are unappreciative of all the cooking and cleaning he does, although they eventually realize the error of their ways. Ice Bear sleeps in the refrigerator with a fire ax which he can use with either hand. Of the three bears, he has the closest relationship with Chloe, almost acting as a quiet big brother to her.\n{{-}}\n\n==Recurring characters==\n===Chloe Park===\n{{Infobox character\n| name             = Chloe Park\n| series           = \n| image            = \n| image_size       = \n| caption          = \n| first            = \"Chloe\"\n| last             = \n| creator          = [[Daniel Chong (animator)|Daniel Chong]]\n| portrayer        = \n| voice            = [[Charlyne Yi]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/We-Bare-Bears/Chloe/|title=Voice of Chloe|website=Behind the Voice Actors|accessdate=November 19, 2017}}</ref>\n| lbl1             = \n| data1            = \n| full_name        = \n| nickname         = \n| alias            = \n| species          = Human\n| gender           = Female\n}}\nChloe Park doesn't have many friends other than the bears and has a hard time relating to her much older peers. In \"My Clique,\" Chloe finally makes some friends with her college classmates, albeit with the help of the Bears. In the same episode, she is revealed to be [[Multilingualism|bilingual]]. Chloe devotes most of her time to studying in the hopes of having a secure future and becomes stressed when it seems like she is on the verge of failing as evidenced in \"The Library\" and \"Professor Lampwick\". Despite fully knowing that the bears mean well, their antics sometimes stress her too. At one point she was nearly driven insane by the Bears when they got sick in the episode \"Bear Flu\" due to them asking for things. Nevertheless, she adores them and will often rely on them for help. She has shown to be involved with their misadventures such as in \"The Demon\" and \"Road Trip\". She also has an interesting connection with Ice Bear due to his quiet persona meshed with her more open personality as seen in \"Chloe and Ice Bear\". Of the three bears, she is most often seen with him.\n\n===Nom Nom===\n{{Infobox character\n| name             = Nom Nom\n| series           = \n| image            = \n| image_size       = \n| caption          = \n| first            = \"Viral Video\"\n| last             = \n| creator          = [[Daniel Chong (animator)|Daniel Chong]]\n| portrayer        = \n| voice            = [[Patton Oswalt]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/We-Bare-Bears/Nom-Nom/|title=Voice of Nom Nom|website=Behind the Voice Actors|accessdate=November 19, 2017}}</ref>\n| lbl1             = \n| data1            = \n| full_name         = \n| nickname         = \n| alias            = \n| species          = [[Koala]]\n| gender           = Male\n}}\nNom Nom is a misanthropic self-hating [[koala]]. He is a famous internet star, known for his \"cute\" videos and the main antagonist during the two first seasons, starting a slow redemption from the third season onward. While he doesn't talk in any of his videos, Nom Nom often swears angrily towards everyone he comes in contact with, especially the bears. Grizzly imposes him enough to talk to him and admits that he liked his video, but Nom Nom is self-centered and more concerned with materialistic things, and is very selfish and lashes out at anyone who he doesn't like. One example being in \"The Nom Nom Show\" where he was unwilling to share the spotlight with the Bears, despite the positive reception they received. In \"Viral Video,\" Nom Nom says that he does not want any friends because he finds them unimportant and too loud, and proves his point by kicking Grizz out of his limo. His temper is so short, he lashes out at anyone who even slightly annoys him. In \"Anger Management\", it's revealed that Grizz's hugs genuinely calm him to the point of making him optimistic and friendly. He has further shown a more tolerant side. In \"Nom Nom's Entourage,\" he saves a picture of his time with the Bears and in \"Kyle,\" opened his home to another koala who claimed to be his brother. In \"Vacation\", he finally admits that Grizz is the closest thing to a friend he has. In \"Crowbar Jones: Origins\", Nom Nom is shown to be more tolerant of Grizz though he still finds him a nuisance.\n\n===Charlie===\n{{Infobox character\n| name             = Charlie\n| series           = \n| image            = \n| image_size       = \n| caption          = \n| first            = \"Charlie\"\n| last             = \n| creator          = [[Daniel Chong (animator)|Daniel Chong]]\n| portrayer        = \n| voice            = [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]]<ref name=\"WBBCast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/we-bare-bears-gets-3rd-season-at-cartoon-network-940884|title='We Bare Bears' Gets 3rd Season at Cartoon Network|last=Greenho|first=Caitlin|website=The Hollywood Reporter|date=October 25, 2016}}</ref>\n| lbl1             = \n| data1            = \n| full_name         = \n| nickname         = \n| alias            = \n| species          = [[Bigfoot]]\n| gender           = Male\n}}\nCharlie is a friendly [[bigfoot]] who wanders alone around the San Francisco woods until he meets the Bears in \"Charlie,\" where they agree to let him live in their cave for a little while via a website called CaveShare. While it is unknown how old he is, he is apparently more than a century old as he is shown living as far back as 1913 as seen in \"El Oso\". It is revealed that, due to his life of solitude, he is socially inept and doesn't know how to be a good friend. This results in him unintentionally causing havoc for the Bears whenever he hangs out with them. He is also constantly harassed by humans trying to get pictures of him, which results in him becoming [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] towards them and developing a fear of cameras. He has on more than one occasion befriended someone other than the Bears. In \"El Oso\", he made friends with the titular character and in \"Rescue Ranger\", he mildly learns to put up with Tabes, but eventually accepts her as his friend in \"Charlie & Tabes\" after getting her name wrong numerous times (Tubes, Tebs, etc.). In \"Hurricane Hal\", his actual home is shown to be a broken-down car while in \"Christmas Parties\" he lives in a giant tree. In the episode \"Charlie Ball,\" we see that Charlie is extremely skilled at ball-handling and that his height makes him perfect for [[basketball]]. In \"Charlie's Big Foot,\" Charlie is revealed to have blue-colored blood and a very jointed body, mostly due to being harmed by the wilderness which he views as perfectly normal, and in \"Bubble\", it is revealed that his natural fur is actually gold colored making him look handsome and majestic. He also sees Panda as his best friend and usually tries to show off new discoveries and his \"decor\" to him over the other two. Besides Panda, he also is friends with a common snake as seen in \"Charlie and the Snake\".\n\n===Ranger Tabes===\n{{Infobox character\n| name             = Ranger Tabes\n| series           = \n| image            = \n| image_size       = \n| caption          = \n| first            = \"Ranger Tabes\"\n| last             = \n| creator          = [[Daniel Chong (animator)|Daniel Chong]]\n| portrayer        = \n| voice            = [[Cameron Esposito]]<ref name=\"WBBCast\" />\n| lbl1             = \n| data1            = \n| full_name         = Dana Tabes\n| nickname         = \n| alias            = \n| species          = Human\n| gender           = Female\n}}\nRanger Dana Tabes is a [[National Park Service ranger|park ranger]]. She lives in a trailer-style mobile home located in the park where the Bears live. They first meet her in \"Ranger Tabes\" where she helps them locate a missing package. She is shown to be overly confident, persistent and even downright obsessive with wanting to help people. Her obsession is explored in \"Creature Mysteries\" where she tries to capture and prove Charlie's existence. In that same episode, it's revealed that her mother was also a park ranger and the one who inspired her to become one. Her obsession is also prominent in \"Poppy Rangers\" where she was willing to lead a team of girl scouts, called the Poppy Rangers, into a dangerous cave, against Grizzly's wishes. Despite her quirky personality, the Bears consider her as one of their closest friends and praise her to some extent as seen in \"Ranger Norm\". Out of all of them, Tabes seems to coerce with Grizz the most and usually has him around as an assistant to help in leading the Poppy Rangers. Based on how much she relies on him, they seem to have mutual respect for each for other. In \"Ranger Games\", it is revealed that she has a rival in the form of '''Ranger Zhao''' (voiced by [[Ming-Na Wen]]) who leads her own group of girl scouts called the Ivy Rangers. In \"Bear Squad\", Tabes is shown to possess deduction skills to the level of identifying animals and people by a limited amount of evidence. In the same episode, it is revealed that she is banned from doing any ranger work in the city. Over time, Tabes is shown to have calmed down a bit, though she still takes her job very seriously. She has even learned to be more surveillant with her duties and upon knowledge of Charlie's true existence has opted to watch and protect him from afar. By the end of \"Rescue Ranger\", she mildly becomes friends with Charlie and, like the Bears, decides to keep him a secret. Eventually, the two become good friends after he helps her finds her dog Kirk in \"Tabes & Charlie\".\n\n===Lucy===\n{{Infobox character\n| name             = Lucy\n| series           = \n| image            = \n| image_size       = \n| caption          = \n| first            = \"Panda's Date\"\n| last             = \n| creator          = [[Daniel Chong (animator)|Daniel Chong]]\n| portrayer        = \n| voice            = [[Ellie Kemper]]<ref name=\"WBBCast\" />\n| lbl1             = \n| data1            = \n| full_name         = \n| nickname         = \n| alias            = \n| species          = Human\n| gender           = Female\n}}\nLucy is a friend to the Bears and runs a produce delivery service called ''Lucy's Produce''. She first appears in \"Panda's Date\" where she takes an immediate liking to the Bears and their goofy personalities. Panda quickly (as usual) develops a crush on her, but she seems to be unaware of his feelings. She finally returns in season 3 episode, \"Lucy's Brother\" where it is revealed that she delivers fruit to the Bears every Friday. In that same episode, she is shown to have a younger brother named Clifford whom she cares for and worries over immensely. She is also shown to be a terrible dancer, something which Panda was nervous telling her about, but she learns to accept after he realizes how important it is, to be honest, and faithful to her. Despite being oblivious to Panda's feelings for her, the two share a mutual friendship. In \"The Limo\", Lucy begins dating '''Kale''' (voiced by [[Omid Abtahi]]) which upsets Panda, but he ultimately accepts as her happiness is what matters.\n{{-}}\n\n==Minor characters==\n===Pigeon Cartel===\nThe Pigeon Cartel is composed of pigeons who are actually an underground illegal trading ring. They are the closest thing to arch-enemies the Bears have and first appeared in \"Our Stuff\". They stole the Bears' items, which included Grizz's wallet, Panda's cell phone and Ice Bear's ninja stars, along with a wide variety of other expensive and important items around the city. The Bears unintentionally landed in their hideout where the cartel or at least a subgroup of them were arrested. In \"Pigeons\", they are revealed to have a member in their ranks named '''Brenda''' whom Grizz ends up befriending. Brenda actually tricks Grizz into helping her free her gang from prison, or rather the pigeon coup inside the prison, she ultimately has a change of heart due to Grizz's kindness.\n\n===Chloe's Family===\n* '''Mr. Park''' (voiced by Jinkoo Jeong) is Chloe's father. He was initially reserved about Chloe hanging out with the bears, but warms up to their presence in \"Slumber Party\". He is bilingual.\n* '''Mrs. Park''' (voiced by [[Niki Yang]]) is Chloe's mother. She is very supportive of Chloe's friendship with the bears as evidenced when she makes sandwiches for them in \"Chloe and Ice Bear\". She is bilingual.\n* '''Jon Park''' (voiced by Bert Youn) is Chloe's cousin. He appeared in \"Christmas Parties\" where is shown to be rather cocky and doesn't get along with Chloe very well. He has a habit of pranking her every chance he gets and always gets away with it.\n\n===Farmer===\nFarmer (voiced by Kyler Spears) is Nom Nom's personal [[bodyguard]]. He was initially known as '''Bodyguard #1''' due to his primary task of protecting Nom Nom who in turn didn't think much of him. However, this all changed in the episode \"Kyle\" where it is shown that Farmer genuinely cares for Nom Nom's security when he suspected that the titular koala was trying to scam Nom Nom. After rescuing his employer, Nom Nom became more aware of him and asked for his real name, calling him Farmer from that point on.\n\n===Rangers===\n*'''Kirk''' is a dog that Tabes was given as a Christmas present by the Bears in \"Christmas Parties\". In \"Lunch with Tabes,\" he is shown to be rather clever and mischievous. In \"Tabes & Charlie\", he is revealed to have fathered three pups with a wolf.\n* '''Ranger Martinez''' (voiced by [[Keith Ferguson (voice actor)|Keith Ferguson]]) is Tabes' partner. He has been a park ranger since Tabes was a child and was initially her mother's partner. In his old age, he is always prone to sleep and is shown to be rather laid back. He is also very friendly with the Bears.\n* '''Poppy Rangers''' are the team of girl scouts that Ranger Tabes, and to a certain extent Grizz, lead in a variety of tasks and activities. Their ranks include '''Diaz''' (voiced by Marissa Soto), a \"curious and witty\" girl who aspires to be a [[biologist]]; '''Parker''' (voiced by Danity Harris), a \"quiet and confidant\" girl who aspires to be an [[Aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineer]]; '''Murphy''' (voiced by Stella Balick-Karrer), a \"cheerful and patient\" girl who aspires to be a [[geologist]]; '''Nguyen''' (voiced by Audrey Huynh) another \"quiet and confident\" girl who aspires to be a [[principal dancer]] and '''Wallace''' (voiced by Cate Gragnani) an eye-patch wearing \"fearless...born leader\" who aspires to be a park ranger like Tabes. It is unknown whether Wallace has only injured her eye or lost it, only stating that \"it was worth it\". The girls unanimously trust Tabes' leadership and advice, but also adore Grizz whom they affectionately call 'Bear Guy', even though they are well aware of his flaws such as in \"Ranger Games\" and even admit that he is terrible at leading as seen in \"Lord of the Poppies\". In the former episode, their rivals, the '''Ivy Rangers''', as well as Wallace's younger sister '''Chuck Wallace''' are introduced.\n\n===Clifford===\nClifford (voiced by Hudson West) is Lucy's younger brother. He has many allergies and has trouble socializing with others. He constantly wanders off and is very shy. He starts to like Panda once he is considered a friend. He is also very defensive of his sister, seen as he is aware that many boys use him as an attempt to get close to her and gets mad at Panda for doing so. Fortunately, he and Panda reconcile and consider each other close friends.\n\n===Darrell===\nDarrell Saragosa (voiced by [[Mel Rodriguez]]) a 35-year-old man, is a friend to the Bears and owns a [[mousepad]] store called ''Super Rad Mousepads''. He first appears in \"Losing Ice\" where he answers a want ad from Grizz and Panda asking for a replacement for the missing Ice Bear. He happily takes the job, despite the harsh conditions, and later makes them realize their error in taking Ice Bear for granted. He lives with his grandma, Emma, who apparently does most of his cooking. He returns in \"Bear Lift\" where the Bears help his fledgling business. It's also shown that in his youth his store was once booming and brought people together, but over time it began to wear away. By the end, the Bears help bring the store back due to its 'retro' appeal. In \"Best Bears\" Darrell gets married to '''Sofia''' (voiced by Brigitte Kali Canales), a [[hang gliding]] instructor and [[fashion design]]er who thinks that he and the Bears are cool.\n\n===Yana===\nYana (voiced by [[Margarita Levieva]]) is a Russian woman with dark connections to Ice Bear. She is an aggressive woman with a sentimental side to her as well. She and Ice Bear have known each other for a long time and have been on missions together for unknown reasons. Yana first appeared in \"Icy Nights\" where she briefly helped Ice Bear look for his Roomba. She returns in \"Icy Nights II\" where she is kidnapped by Barry, a tech genius who is after the Roomba. At the end of the episode, it's revealed that Yana's father is Yuri, the same man who raised Ice Bear. It's unknown if Yuri is still in contact with her or knows that she's still alive.\n\n===Barry===\nBarry Charles (voiced by [[Kevin McHale (actor)|Kevin McHale]]) is a technical expert and Ice Bear's nemesis. He leads a gang of techies and is involved in illegal activities. His main goal is to steal Ice Bear's Roomba due to the technical specifications it possesses. The reason for doing this is so that he can earn the approval of his father, something that is a sore spot for him.\n\n===Marie===\nMarie (voiced by Edi Patterson) is a web show host that the Bears occasionally watch. She hosts the show ''Mornings with Marie'' off from the website ''[[YouTube|Everyone's Tube]]''. She tends to report on all the latest crazes and current things usually from the internet such as Nom Nom and Panda's sudden popularity like in \"Panda's Sneeze\". Marie also hosts the ''Cute-Off'', a competition where two animals from viral videos participate.\n\n===The Bros===\nThe Bros are the human doppelgangers to the Bears. They first appeared in \"Panda's Friend\". They fittingly display qualities similar to, but also superior to the actual bears.\n* '''Tom''' (voiced by Bert Youn) is Panda's counterpart. He is a small, presumably Asian, man, who wears glasses and typically wears a black hoodie with a white stripe going through it so as to resemble a panda. He, just like Panda, loves Korean dramas and anime and is apparently 97% similar. He becomes way too attached to Panda and kidnaps him from his home and moves him into his apartment. When he realizes how obsessive he has become he leaves (or rather falls) and meets his other two roommates Griff and Isaac. He is much more stable with the two and in \"Bro Brawl\" implies that they are his only real family as well. In that same episode, he states that he has a girlfriend.\n* '''Griff''' (voiced by Eric Edelstein in \"Panda's Friend\" and later by Faruq Tauheed) is Grizz's counterpart. Griff is a \"renegade\" cop, later revealed to be a mall cop, who loves his job and is capable of helping people, as opposed to Grizz who has no job and, while helpful, is socially inept. He is a well built African-American man who usually wears a blue shirt. He seems to care a lot about his roommates and in his first appearance was nervous about losing his home for not meeting the roommate quota until Tom literally dropped in. In \"The Mall\", he is shown to be very friendly with Grizz.\n* '''Isaac''' (voiced by Demetri Martin) is Ice Bear's counterpart. Isaac is a \"five-star chef\" who, much like Ice Bear, is tall and quiet. He wears a white hoodie with the hood always over his head and his blonde bangs hanging out. When he speaks he follows Ice Bear's speech mannerisms by talking in the third person. He sleeps in a walk-in closet, like how Ice Bear sleeps in a fridge and also seems to possess many outlandish abilities. In \"Bro Brawl\" he one up Ice Bear due to not having any hair in his food. In \"The Mall\", he and Ice Bear seem to view each other as rivals.\n\n===Captain Craboo===\nCaptain Craboo is the Bears' pet crab whom they adopted in the episode \"Emergency\". He actually came from the supermarket which Grizz went to buy food and immediately fell in love with the crab. Unfortunately, it pinches onto Ice Bear's ear causing him to become catatonic and deranged. Grizz and Panda eventually get Craboo off of Ice Bear and resort to giving him tiny mitts so that he doesn't pinch Ice Bear again. He returns in \"Captain Craboo\" where it is revealed that he has been gone for quite some time and that Ice Bear still has not forgiven him. However, the two later make up. In that same episode, Craboo attacks Nom Nom, making him a wanted fugitive. By the end of the episode, Craboo solemnly leaves the Bears before they release him into the ocean, especially Ice Bear, who took his departure the hardest.\n\n===The Mailman===\nThe Mailman (voiced by Keith Ferguson) is a friendly [[Postal worker|mailman]] that occasionally visits the Bears. He first appears in \"Nom Nom\" where he delivers a toy helicopter to the Bears. He falls into a pit where Ice Bear was trapped by Nom Nom. He shows that he doesn't mind the situation and also didn't seem to mind being left there. He returns in \"Crowbar Jones\" where he was invited to see the titular movie that Grizz had made. He was easily impressed by it and based on his reactions, simply wishes to have friends. In \"Citizen Tabes,\" he was also impressed with Tabes' packaging to the point that he was willing to listen to her ramble about how she did it. In \"I, Butler\", he was interested in playing basketball with the bears even though he creepily appeared from behind their bushes.\n\n===Mad Scientist===\nMad Scientist (voiced by [[Jason Mantzoukas]]) is an unnamed scientist who is constantly plotting against the government. He first appears in \"Grizz Helps\" where Grizz answers a want ad for someone to aid him in traveling back in time. He was going to use a chicken named Mark as a test subject and Grizz had to rescue him for its owner. The scientist reappeared in \"Summer Love\" with a pelican assistant named Gary and tried to use a body swapping machine on Panda. He revealed that he once had a girlfriend named Amelia who joined the space program, implying one of the reasons he kept conspiring against the government.\n\n===Ralph===\nRalph (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]) is a [[yeti]] who enjoys playing cruel pranks on humans and animals. He first appears in \"Ralph\" where Charlie befriends him due to being a creature just like him, despite the Bears gaining distrust of Ralph due to his mean nature. He ends up abandoning Charlie when the latter refuses to let a group of humans fall off a bridge as part of a prank, considering him a \"snooze-fest\". He appears again in \"Ice Cave\" where he takes over the Bears' cave and freezes its interior, ruling it like a king. He usually puts Charlie down due to his lanky body and pushes over personality, but Charlie stands up to him and puts Ralph in his place.\n\n===Dr. Clark===\nDr. Clark (voiced by Avery Kidd Waddell) is a medical nurse and Nom Nom's personal doctor. He first appeared in \"Charlie's Big Foot\" where he treated Charlie's foot after it broke. He is shown to have a very unusual [[Doctor\u2013patient relationship|bedside manner]] in that he has a very lethargic and slightly disinterested way of speaking. However, he is shown to take his job seriously and looked aghast at seeing Charlie's blood. He returned in \"Vacation\" where he acted as Nom Nom's personal doctor. His diagnosis was that he was stressed and prescribed that he take a vacation with Grizz acting as his coach. Once again, Dr. Clark delivered all of this in a lethargic disinterested attitude. In \"Braces\", he is revealed to also serve as a dentist and possesses numerous doctoral degrees.\n\n==Guest characters==\n===Paul and Annie===\nPaul (voiced by [[Lou Ferrigno]]) and Annie (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle|Grey Griffin]]) are a married couple that appeared in \"Yard Sale\". Annie is an average looking red-haired woman who was heavily [[Pregnancy|pregnant]]. She sold a box of free things to the Bears at a yard sale she had set up. The things in question were large foam toy fists (which Grizz begins wearing only for them to get stuck to his paws) her husband Paul's phone (which Panda mistakenly takes and begins sending texts unknowingly to Annie) and a pregnancy workout DVD (which Ice Bear begins watching and using to get in better shape). Paul, who resembles a large well-built man, is offended at Panda using his phone and possessively threatens him, but becomes nervous and faints when Annie goes into labor. The Bears band together to get Annie and Paul to the hospital where she successfully gives birth to a baby boy that somehow manages to removes the fake hands off of Grizz, much to everyone's surprise since he had difficulty removing them before.\n\n===Professor Lampwick===\nProfessor Lampwick (voiced by [[Malcolm McDowell]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/We-Bare-Bears/Professor-Lampwick/|title=Voice of Professor Lampwick|website=Behind the Voice Actors|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}</ref> is Chloe's science professor at the university and he appeared in his self-titled episode. Lampwick is a tall, lean older man with a sinister and stern personality. He has a notorious reputation for being a difficult professor who refuses second chances with his students. Chloe gets so intimidated by him that she fails her course causing her much grief. However, the Bears decide to kidnap him and bring him back to the cave in an effort to force him to give Chloe a second chance. Lampwick proves to be crafty as he turns the Bears against one another, forcing Chloe to step up and demand a second chance, which he grants. When Chloe passes, Lampwick reveals that he untied his own bonds and was just testing her, admitting that she wasn't the first student to \"kidnap [him] over a grade.\" He briefly returns in \"Hurricane Hal\" where he is shown to have an omniscient presence as he was capable of explaining exactly what each of the Bears was doing and apparently is aware of who Charlie is.\n\n===Andy Bangs===\nAndrew \"Andy\" Bangs (voiced by [[Bo Burnham]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/We-Bare-Bears/Andy-Bangs/|title=Voice of Andy Bangs|website=Behind the Voice Actors|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}</ref> is a child internet star and Nom Nom's main rival who appeared in \"Nom Nom's Entourage\". Andy's name is a pun on the fact that his videos consist mostly of him popping out of places and shouting \"Bang!\" and that he has [[Hair coloring|dyed]] [[Bangs (hair)|bangs]]. He takes great pleasure in humiliating and outsmarting Nom Nom using his trademark surprise gimmick. One thing he has over Nom Nom, is the fact that he is constantly surrounded by his entourage, which Nom Nom lacks forcing him to hire the Bears. Nom eventually manages to get back at Andy by surprising him with his signature \"Bang!\".\n\n===Karla and Dave===\nKarla (voiced by [[Felicia Day]]) and Dave (voiced by [[Jake Johnson]]) are a pair of castaways that the baby Bears encounter in \"The Island\". The Bears are rescued from quicksand by Karla and Dave who have been shipwrecked on the island for some unspecified amount of time. All that is known is that they came separately. Karla mostly misses her sister whom she loves very much and forms a motherly bond with the baby Bears, while Dave displays a slightly disinterested attitude. It eventually becomes clear, that Dave has been misleading Karla and the Bears and that he wants Karla to stay with him alone. The Bears rescue Karla from Dave and escape on an inflatable raft they found, leaving Dave all alone. Karla is rescued by a passing ship, but the Bears float on until they end up in [[Japan]].\n\n===Yuri===\nYuri (voiced by [[Darin De Paul]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/We-Bare-Bears/Yuri/|title=Voice of Yuri|website=Behind the Voice Actors|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}</ref> is an old Russian man who lived out in the arctic as a [[hermit]] [[Survivalism|survivalist]], until he met baby Ice Bear in the episode \"Yuri and the Bear\". A tall, large bearded man who much like Ice Bear, had a tendency to speak in the third person, Yuri lived in a life of solitude after losing his family to some unknown causes. He took Ice Bear under his wing, after some reluctance, and taught him everything that he knew. They were confronted by a hunter, who is implied to have killed Ice Bear's family, and Yuri is forced to cut Ice Bear away from land to save him. In \"Icy Nights II\", it is revealed that Yuri is Yana's father.\n\n===Wyatt===\nWyatt (voiced by [[Ron Funches]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bubbleblabber.com/review-we-bare-bears-road-trip/|title=Review: We Bare Bears \"Road Trip\"|last=Schwarz|first=John|website=Bubble Babbler|date=August 7, 2017|accessdate=February 3, 2018}}</ref> is the overly kind leader of a [[Outlaw motorcycle club|bike gang]] in \"Road Trip\". Wyatt is a random individual that Chloe and the Bears encounter while on their way to see the meteor shower. He displays a slightly lethargic, yet kind and joking attitude that clicks with Grizz, Panda, and Chloe but annoys Ice Bear. He claims that he lost his bike gang and is allowed to ride with them, much to Ice Bear's chagrin. Eventually, Ice Bear manages to take off without him only to have the car run out of gas. Wyatt shows up with his gang and they offer to share their gas with them. Later on, he joins Chloe and the Bears in watching the meteor shower.\n\n===Warren and Faye===\nWarren (voiced by [[Robert Clotworthy]]) and Faye (voiced by [[Frances Conroy]]) are a friendly elderly couple who live in a [[Recreational vehicle|RV]] in the woods somewhere near where the Bears live. They appear in the episode \"Neighbors\" and are depicted as an overly kind couple who immediately take joy in conversing with the Bears. While Panda and Ice Bear find them pleasant, Grizz finds them uncomfortably nice as the two are shown touching and examining the Bears. The two begin taking pictures of the Bears going about their day and it is revealed that they keep numerous knives and other cutting instruments, giving the impression that they plan on cutting up or eating the Bears. However, it is revealed that the two are wood carving fanatics and simply wanted the Bears to model for them for their hobby. They forgive the Bears for their snooping. Warren and Fay are named after [[Warren Beatty]] and [[Faye Dunaway]].\n\n===Esteller===\nEsteller (voiced by [[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]]) is a famous pop song singer who Panda and Tom are huge fans of. She appears in the episode \"The Mall\" where she arrives at the titular location to personally sign autographs for her fans, whom she affectionately refers to as her \"starlings\". Esteller is moved by Panda and Tom's willingness to let their shirts be ruined so that they can get a chance to meet her in person. She thanks them and gives them new signed shirts while politely berating the other fans that tried to ruin their shirts to begin with by telling them, \"Don't be jerks.\" Estelle sings the series' theme song and had previously appeared as herself in the episode \"More Everyone's Tube\" where she sang the full version.\n\n===Charles Barkley===\n[[Charles Barkley]] as himself appears in the episode \"Baby Bears Can't Jump\".

In 1920, the Wolseley leather \"[[Custodian helmet|bobby]]\" helmet was also introduced. Policeman were wearing striped pieces of cloth (brassards) on their lower left cuffs to show they were on duty. During World War II, Victoria Police issued anti-shrapnel steel helmets, also referred as \"tin hats\".<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nBetween 1947 and 1979, a major uniform change took place for Victorian Police officers. The bobby helmet was replaced by a black cloth peak cap, a silver police badge was introduced along with white shirts and ties for the general police officers. In 1963, a white [[pith helmet]] with a puggaree hatband and a hand-held radio were added to the Victoria Police general duties officers. Along with a new uniform, Victoria Police also introduced the first uniform for women. The uniform for females featured a knee-length skirt, a button-up jacket, a shirt and tie, [[tights]], and peak hats made to fit a lady's hairstyle. Starting with 1972 until 1986, female police officers also carried handbags custom-made to hold batons and firearms.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/dark-blue-hue-a-police-winner-20121205-2auj9.html|title=Dark blue hue a police winner|last=Bucci|first=Nino|website=The Age|access-date=2016-08-31}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1979 and 2013, police uniforms underwent a number of small changes and there were a total of 83 combinations that a police officer could wear. The changes were mainly as need based for the general duties policing with the addition of [[Pepper spray|capsicum sprays]], [[handgun]], [[Baton (law enforcement)|baton]], etc. In 1981, female police officers were approved trousers as part of their uniform and they were issued 54 pantyhose a year. In 2001, the [[baseball cap]] was introduced along with [[akubra]] and a woollen jumper. One major change happened in 2008 with the introduction of the [[Bulletproof vest|Integrated Operational Equipment Vest]].<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIn November 1986, Victoria Police announced the transition of the motto from \"Tenez le droit\" to \"Uphold the right\".

The pants are made from rip-stop fabric, the undergarment made from cotton stretch which can be short sleeved or long sleeved and is to be worn under the ballistic vest. Baseball caps remained, although they are darker in colour than pre 2013. The new dark uniform was designed to look more professional and to hide blood, dirt and sweat. The dark blue uniform was modelled after the Oxfordshire and Northumberland police attires.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Chief Commissioners ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0\n!

A sergeant normally manages a team during a shift, like Patrol Supervisor of a Police Service Area (PSA) for a shift. A detective sergeant is typically in charge of a team in a specific part of either local detectives at police stations or crime squads.\n\nA senior sergeant oversees the sergeants and traditionally performs more administrative work and middle management duties, for example coordination of policing operations, or specialist work other than active patrol duties. General-duties senior sergeants are traditionally in charge of most police stations or can be a sub-charge (or second in charge) of larger (usually 24-hour) police stations. In each division, or group of divisions on a night shift, a senior sergeant is the division supervisor for a shift and is responsible for managing and overseeing incidents in their area. Detective senior sergeants are usually the officer in charge of crime investigation units.\n\n===Designations===\nAdditional classifications are available for members skilful enough, and upon completion of certain training and work-based performances, for classification of detective at senior constable level. Detectives also hold classification up to superintendent.\n\n===Dissolved ranks===\n{| style=\"text-align:center\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''Rank'''||Chief<br /> Inspector||Chief<br /> superintendent\n|-\n|'''Insignia'''||[[File:vic-police-chief-inspector.png|50px]]||[[File:vic-police-chief-superintendent.png|50px]]\n|}\n\nThe ranks of chief inspector and chief superintendent are no longer promotable ranks since the changes in hierarchy in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=The rank and file|url=http://www.police.vic.gov.au/content.asp?document_id=12383|website=Victoria Police|publisher=State Government Victoria|accessdate=21 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe previous and last chief superintendent, Peter McDonald, retired from Victoria Police on 30 September 2014.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.cwaustral.com.au/emag-1412/11184-3728-19809958/index.html|title = Victoria Police Association Journal|last = |first = |date = December 2014|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> The last Chief Inspector Christopher K.

He was the only Chief Inspector to wear the current style and colour uniform.\n\n===Positions===\nLeading senior constable (LSC) used to be listed in the rank structure but was not a rank per se. It was only open for senior constables to apply for and was not a permanent position. If a member transferred to another duty type or station, the officer was then relieved of the position of LSC. It was primarily a position for field training officers who oversees the training and development of inexperienced probationary constables or constables.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe most recent round of wage negotiations however saw the title of leading senior constable become an actual rank. It is awarded \"in situ\" but only after assessments have been made against the senior constable's ability to move to the higher position. Leading senior constables are now capable of being upgraded to acting sergeant and it is expected that the position is one that people will move through as they are promoted.\n\nMembers who held the position or classification of leading senior constable under the last enterprise bargaining agreements will retain their title and position.\n\n=== Salaries and benefits ===\nOn 15 February 2016, Victoria Police members voted for the 2016 \u2013 2019 [[Enterprise bargaining agreement|Enterprise Bargain Agreement]].

Historically, the Victorian Mounted police had taken part in actions against Bushrangers, and guarded gold shipments from the Goldfields.

A sergeant normally manages a team during a shift, like Patrol Supervisor of a Police Service Area (PSA) for a shift. A detective sergeant is typically in charge of a team in a specific part of either local detectives at police stations or crime squads.\n\nA senior sergeant oversees the sergeants and traditionally performs more administrative work and middle management duties, for example coordination of policing operations, or specialist work other than active patrol duties. General-duties senior sergeants are traditionally in charge of most police stations or can be a sub-charge (or second in charge) of larger (usually 24-hour) police stations. In each division, or group of divisions on a night shift, a senior sergeant is the division supervisor for a shift and is responsible for managing and overseeing incidents in their area. Detective senior sergeants are usually the officer in charge of crime investigation units.\n\n===Designations===\nAdditional classifications are available for members skilful enough, and upon completion of certain training and work-based performances, for classification of detective at senior constable level. Detectives also hold classification up to superintendent.\n\n===Dissolved ranks===\n{| style=\"text-align:center\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''Rank'''||Chief<br /> Inspector||Chief<br /> superintendent\n|-\n|'''Insignia'''||[[File:vic-police-chief-inspector.png|50px]]||[[File:vic-police-chief-superintendent.png|50px]]\n|}\n\nThe ranks of chief inspector and chief superintendent are no longer promotable ranks since the changes in hierarchy in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=The rank and file|url=http://www.police.vic.gov.au/content.asp?document_id=12383|website=Victoria Police|publisher=State Government Victoria|accessdate=21 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe previous and last chief superintendent, Peter McDonald, retired from Victoria Police on 30 September 2014.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.cwaustral.com.au/emag-1412/11184-3728-19809958/index.html|title = Victoria Police Association Journal|last = |first = |date = December 2014|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> The last Chief Inspector Christopher K. Coster retired on 6 June 2019 after 45 years service. He was the only Chief Inspector to wear the current style and colour uniform.\n\n===Positions===\nLeading senior constable (LSC) used to be listed in the rank structure but was not a rank per se. It was only open for senior constables to apply for and was not a permanent position. If a member transferred to another duty type or station, the officer was then relieved of the position of LSC. It was primarily a position for field training officers who oversees the training and development of inexperienced probationary constables or constables.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe most recent round of wage negotiations however saw the title of leading senior constable become an actual rank. It is awarded \"in situ\" but only after assessments have been made against the senior constable's ability to move to the higher position. Leading senior constables are now capable of being upgraded to acting sergeant and it is expected that the position is one that people will move through as they are promoted.\n\nMembers who held the position or classification of leading senior constable under the last enterprise bargaining agreements will retain their title and position.\n\n=== Salaries and benefits ===\nOn 15 February 2016, Victoria Police members voted for the 2016 \u2013 2019 [[Enterprise bargaining agreement|Enterprise Bargain Agreement]].

The mounted police force was formed sometime before the 1850s. This is the second oldest continuously operating mounted police unit in the world, after the NSW Mounted Police. Historically, the Victorian Mounted police had taken part in actions against Bushrangers, and guarded gold shipments from the Goldfields. For a lot of its history, the force had largely operated from its barracks at Southbank from 1912, but are now bases at Attwood, near Melbourne airport. Modern duties include crowd control, patrolling, public relations and sports events.\n\n==Honours and awards==\nRecognition of the bravery and good conduct of Victoria Police employees is shown through the awarding of honours and decorations.

Plans were made for a 10-minute stereo memory card and the system was at one time fitted with a hard drive which would have enabled over an hour of recorded digital music. Later Kramer set up a company to promote the IXI and five working prototypes were produced with 16-bit sampling at 44.1 kilohertz with the pre-production prototype being unveiled at the APRS Audio/Visual trade exhibition in October 1986. However, in 1988 Kramer's failure to raise the \u00a360,000 required to renew the patent meant it entering the public domain, but he still owns the designs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1053152/Apple-admit-Briton-DID-invent-iPod-hes-getting-money.html |title=Apple admit Briton DID invent iPod, but he's still not getting any money |website=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2008-09-08 |accessdate=2017-04-03 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120629013155/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1053152/Apple-admit-Briton-DID-invent-iPod-hes-getting-money.html |archivedate=2012-06-29 }}</ref>\nIn 1987 a German research institute, part of the [[Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft]], started the research program for coding music with the high quality and low bit-rate sampling at its institute.

It retailed for $599 and was a commercial failure.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/03/10/ft_first_mp3_player/|title=Ten years old: the world's first MP3 player|author=|date=10 March 2008|website=theregister.com|accessdate=15 May 2018}}</ref> The first handheld portable MP3 player released on the American market was the Eiger Labs F10, a 32MB imported version of the MPMan F10 that appeared in the summer of 1998. It was a very basic unit and wasn't user-expandable, though owners could upgrade the memory to 64MB by sending the player back to Eiger Labs with a check for $69.00 plus $7.95 shipping.\n\nAnother early MP3 player needed was the [[Rio PMP300]] from [[Diamond Multimedia]], introduced in September 1998. The Rio was a big success during the Christmas 1998 season as sales significantly exceeded expectations, spurring interest and investment in digital music. The [[RIAA]] soon filed a lawsuit alleging that the device abetted illegal copying of music, but Diamond won a legal victory on the shoulders of ''[[Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios]]'' and MP3 players were ruled legal devices. Eiger Labs and Diamond and went on to establish a new segment in the portable audio player market and the following year saw several new manufacturers enter this market.\n\nOther early MP3 portables include Sensory Science's Rave MP2100, the I-Jam IJ-100 and the Creative Labs Nomad. These portables were small and light, but only held enough memory to hold around 7 to 20 songs at normal 128kbit/s compression rates. They also used slower parallel port connections to transfer files from PC to player, necessary as most PCs then used the [[Windows 95]] and [[Windows NT|NT]] operating systems, which did not support the then newer [[USB]] connections, at least well. As more users migrated to [[Windows 98]] by 2000, all players went USB.\n\nAt the end of 1999, a company called Remote Solutions significantly broke that barrier by utilizing a laptop drive for song storage rather than low capacity flash memory. The [[Personal Jukebox]] (PJB-100) had 4.8GB, which held about 1,200 songs, and invented what would be called the jukebox segment of digital music portables. This segment eventually became the dominant type of digital music player.\n\nAlso at the end of 1999 the first in-dash MP3 player appeared. The [[Empeg Car]] and Rio Car (renamed after it was acquired by SONICblue and added to its Rio line of MP3 products) offered players in several capacities ranging from 5GB to 28GB. The unit didn't catch on as SONICblue had hoped, though, and was discontinued in the fall of 2001.\n\nThere are several types of MP3 players:\n* Devices that play [[Compact disc|CDs]]. Often, they can be used to play both audio CDs and homemade data CDs containing MP3 or other digital audio files.\n* Pocket devices. These are solid-state devices that hold digital audio files on internal or external media, such as [[memory card]]s. These are generally low-storage devices, typically ranging from 128MB to 1GB, which can often be extended with additional memory. As they are solid state and do not have moving parts, they can be very resilient. Such players are generally integrated into USB [[keydrive]]s.\n* Devices that read digital audio files from a [[hard drive]]. These players have higher capacities, ranging from 1.5GB to 100GB, depending on the hard drive technology. At typical encoding rates, this means that thousands of songs\u2014perhaps an entire music collection\u2014can be stored in one MP3 player. Apple's popular [[iPod]] player is the best-known example.\n\n==Equipment==\nGenerally speaking, MP3 players are portable, employing internal or replaceable [[Electric battery|batteries]] and [[headphones]], and may be connected to [[Vehicle audio|car]] and home [[High fidelity|stereos]] via a [[wireless]] connection such as [[bluetooth]].

The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} to an eastward LEO or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|by|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle; in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle, and determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167}} NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. That&nbsp;August<!-- 1972-->, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding.

It was tested at the [[Stennis Space Center|National Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL)]] to ensure that the engines could safely run through the launch profile.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II-163}} Rockwell conducted mechanical and thermal stress tests on Structural Test Article (STA)-099 to determine the effects of aerodynamic and thermal stresses during launch and reentry.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|I-415}}\n\nThe beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was delayed for nine months while [[Pratt & Whitney]] challenged the contract that had been issued to Rocketdyne. The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}} At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December&nbsp;29<!--, 1980-->.<ref name=shbgsl>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=965hAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7-EDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6796%2C9180680 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |title=Space Shuttle begins slow journey to launching pad |date=December 29, 1980 |page=2A}}</ref> The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|III-24}} On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]].

The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|382\u2013389}} The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing.

The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013372}} The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the aft seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|372\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233}} The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|405\u2013408}} The Space Shuttle was not launched if its flight would run from December to January, as its flight software would have required the orbiter vehicle's computers to be reset at the year change.

It was {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long and {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} wide, and could accommodate cylindrical payloads up to {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us}} in diameter. Two payload bay doors hinged on either side of the bay, and provided a relatively airtight seal to protect payloads from heating during launch and reentry. Payloads were secured the in the payload bay to the attachment points on the [[longeron]]s.  The payload bay doors served an additional function as radiators for the orbiter vehicle's heat, and were opened upon reaching orbit for heat rejection.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|62\u201364}}\n\nThe orbiter could be used in conjunction with a variety of add-on components depending on the mission.

The RMS was built by the Canadian company [[Spar Aerospace]], and was controlled by an astronaut inside the orbiter's flight deck using their windows and closed-circuit television. The RMS allowed for six degrees of freedom, and had six joints located at three points along the arm.  The original RMS could deploy or retrieve payloads up to {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip}}, which was later improved to {{convert|586000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip}}.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|384\u2013385}}\n\n=====Spacelab=====\n{{main|Spacelab}}\n[[File:STS-9 Spacelab 1.jpg|thumb|[[Spacelab]] in orbit on [[STS-9]]]]\n\nThe Spacelab module was a European-funded pressurized laboratory that was carried within the payload bay and allowed for scientific research while in orbit.  The Spacelab module contained two {{convert|9|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} segments that were mounted in the aft end of the payload bay to maintain the center of gravity during flight.

The engine nozzles could gimbal \u00b110.5\u00b0 in pitch, and \u00b18.5\u00b0 in [[Aircraft_principal_axes#Vertical_axis_(yaw)|yaw]] during ascent to change the direction of their thrust to steer the Shuttle. The [[titanium alloy]] reusable engines were independent from the orbiter vehicle, and would be removed and replaced in between flights.  The RS-25 is a staged-combustion cycle cryogenic engine that used liquid oxygen and hydrogen, and had a higher chamber pressure than any previous liquid rocket.  The original main combustion chamber operated at a maximum pressure of {{convert|3285|psi|bar|sigfig=4|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}}. The engine nozzle is {{convert|113|in|cm|sigfig=3|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}} tall and has an interior diameter of {{convert|90.3|in|cm|sigfig=3|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}}. The nozzle is cooled by 1,080 interior lines carrying liquid hydrogen, and is thermally protected by insulative and ablative material.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II\u2013177\u2013183}}\n\nThe RS-25 engines had several improvements to enhance reliability and power. During the development program, Rocketdyne determined that the engine was capable of safe reliable operation at 104% of the originally specified thrust. To keep the engine thrust values consistent with previous documentation and software, NASA kept the original specified thrust as 100%, but had the RS-25 operate at higher thrust. RS-25 upgrade versions were denoted as Block I and Block II. 109% thrust level was achieved with the Block II engines in 2001, , which reduced the chamber pressue to {{convert|3010|psi|bar|sigfig=4|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}}, as it had a larger [[de Laval nozzle|throat]] area. The normal maximum throttle was 104 percent, with 106% or 109% used for mission aborts.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|106\u2013107}}\n\n====Orbital Maneuvering System====\n{{main|Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System}}\n\nThe Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) consisted of two aft-mounted [[AJ10|AJ10-190]] engines and the associated fuel pods. The AJ10 engines used [[monomethylhydrazine]] (MMH) oxidized by [[dinitrogen tetroxide]] (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). The pods carried a maximum of {{convert|4718|lb|kg|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=4|sp=us}} of MMH and {{convert|7773|lb|kg|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=4|sp=us}} of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. The OMS engines were used after main engine cut-off (MECO) for orbital insertion. Throughout the flight, they were used for orbit changes, as well as the deorbit burn prior to reentry. Each OMS engine produced {{convert|6087|lbf|N|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=4|sp=us}} of thrust, and the entire system could provide {{convert|1000|ft/s|m/s|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=3|sp=us}} of velocity change.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II\u201380}}\n\n====Thermal protection system====\n{{main|Space Shuttle thermal protection system}}\n\nThe orbiter was protected from heat during reentry by the thermal protection system (TPS), a [[Atmospheric entry#Thermal soak|thermal soaking]] protective layer around the orbiter. In contrast with previous US spacecraft, which had used ablative heat shields, the reusability of the orbiter required a multi-use heat shield.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|72\u201373}} During reentry, the TPS experienced temperatures up to {{convert|3000|F|C|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}, but had to keep the orbiter vehicle's aluminum skin temperature below {{convert|350|F|C|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The TPS primarily consisted of four types of tiles. The nose cone and leading edges of the wings experienced temperatures above {{convert|2300|F|C|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}, and were protected by reinforced carbon-carbon tiles (RCC).  Thicker RCC tiles were developed and installed in 1998 to prevent damage from [[space debris|micrometeoroid and orbital debris]], and were further improved after RCC damage caused of the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' disaster]].  Beginning with [[STS-114]], the orbiter vehicles were equipped with the wing leading edge impact detection system to alert the crew to any potential damage.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II\u2013112\u2013113}} The entire underside of the orbiter vehicle, as well as the other hottest surfaces, were protected with high-temperature reusable surface insulation. Areas on the upper parts of the orbiter vehicle were coated in a white low-temperature reusable surface insulation, which provided protection for temperatures below {{convert|1200|F|C|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The payload bay doors and parts of the upper wing surfaces were coated in reusable felt surface insulation, as the temperature there remained below {{convert|700|F|C|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|395}}\n\n===External tank===\n{{main|Space Shuttle external tank}}\n[[File:STS-29 External Tanker Separation.jpg|thumb|The external tank after separation on [[STS-29]]]]\n\nThe Space Shuttle external tank carried the propellant for the Space Shuttle Main Engines, and connected the orbiter vehicle with the solid rocket boosters. The external tank was {{convert|153.8|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} tall and {{convert|27.6|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} in diameter, and contained separate tanks for liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid hydrogren (LH<sub>2</sub>). The LOX tank was housed in the nose of the external tank, and was {{convert|49.3|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} tall. The LH<sub>2</sub> comprised the bulk of the external tank, and was {{convert|96.7|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} tall. The orbiter vehicle was attached to the external tank at two umbilical plates, which contained five propellant and two electrical umbilicals, and forward and aft structural attachments. The exterior of the external tank was covered in orange spray-on foam to allow it to survive the heat of ascent.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|421\u2013422}}\n\nThe external tank provided propellant to the Space Shuttle Main Engines from liftoff until main engine cutoff.  The external tank separated from the orbiter vehicle 18 seconds after engine cutoff, and could be triggered automatically or manually.  At the time of separation, the orbiter vehicle retracted its umbilical plates, and the umbilical cords were sealed to prevent excess propellant from venting into the orbiter vehicle.  After the bolts attached at the structural attachments were sheared, the external tank separated from the orbiter vehicle. At the time of separation, gaseous oxygen was vented from the nose to cause the external tank to tumble, ensuring that it would break up upon reentry. The external tank was the only major component of the Space Shuttle system that was not reused, and it would travel along a ballistic trajectory into the Indian or Pacific Ocean.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|422}}\n\nFor the first two missions, STS-1 and [[STS-2]], the external tank was covered in {{convert|595|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} of white Fire-Retardant Latex to provide further thermal insulation, but was determined to be unnecessary and removed, increasing the overall payload capacity..<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|421}} A light-weight tank (LWT) was first flown on STS-6, which reduced tank weight by {{convert|10300|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}.

The SRB's subcomponents were the solid rocket motor, nose cone, and rocket nozzle.  The solid rocket motor comprised the majority of the SRB's structure, and consisted of 11 steel sections. The nose cone housed the forward separation motors and the parachute systems that were used during recovery.  The rocket nozzles could gimbal up to 8\u00b0 to allow for in-flight adjustments.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|425\u2013429}}\n\nThe rocket motors were each filled with a total {{convert|1106640|lbs|kg|abbr=on|order=flip|sigfig=2}} of solid rocket propellant, and joined together at the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] (VAB) at the KSC. In addition to providing thrust during the first stage of launch, the SRBs provided structural support for the orbiter vehicle and ET, as they were the only system that was connected to the [[mobile launcher platform]] (MLP).  At the time of launch, the SRBs were armed at T-5 minutes, and could only be electrically ignited once the RS-25 engines had ignited and were without issue.

Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} to an eastward LEO or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|by|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle; in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle, and determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167}} NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. That&nbsp;August<!-- 1972-->, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding.

The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}} At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed.

Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983.

In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware.

The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013372}} The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the aft seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|372\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233}} The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|405\u2013408}} The Space Shuttle was not launched if its flight would run from December to January, as its flight software would have required the orbiter vehicle's computers to be reset at the year change.

It was {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long and {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} wide, and could accommodate cylindrical payloads up to {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us}} in diameter. Two payload bay doors hinged on either side of the bay, and provided a relatively airtight seal to protect payloads from heating during launch and reentry. Payloads were secured the in the payload bay to the attachment points on the [[longeron]]s.  The payload bay doors served an additional function as radiators for the orbiter vehicle's heat, and were opened upon reaching orbit for heat rejection.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|62\u201364}}\n\nThe orbiter could be used in conjunction with a variety of add-on components depending on the mission.

The RMS was built by the Canadian company [[Spar Aerospace]], and was controlled by an astronaut inside the orbiter's flight deck using their windows and closed-circuit television. The RMS allowed for six degrees of freedom, and had six joints located at three points along the arm.  The original RMS could deploy or retrieve payloads up to {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip}}, which was later improved to {{convert|586000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip}}.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|384\u2013385}}\n\n=====Spacelab=====\n{{main|Spacelab}}\n[[File:STS-9 Spacelab 1.jpg|thumb|[[Spacelab]] in orbit on [[STS-9]]]]\n\nThe Spacelab module was a European-funded pressurized laboratory that was carried within the payload bay and allowed for scientific research while in orbit.  The Spacelab module contained two {{convert|9|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} segments that were mounted in the aft end of the payload bay to maintain the center of gravity during flight.

The engine nozzles could gimbal \u00b110.5\u00b0 in pitch, and \u00b18.5\u00b0 in [[Aircraft_principal_axes#Vertical_axis_(yaw)|yaw]] during ascent to change the direction of their thrust to steer the Shuttle. The [[titanium alloy]] reusable engines were independent from the orbiter vehicle, and would be removed and replaced in between flights.  The RS-25 is a staged-combustion cycle cryogenic engine that used liquid oxygen and hydrogen, and had a higher chamber pressure than any previous liquid rocket.  The original main combustion chamber operated at a maximum pressure of {{convert|3285|psi|bar|sigfig=4|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}}. The engine nozzle is {{convert|113|in|cm|sigfig=3|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}} tall and has an interior diameter of {{convert|90.3|in|cm|sigfig=3|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}}. The nozzle is cooled by 1,080 interior lines carrying liquid hydrogen, and is thermally protected by insulative and ablative material.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II\u2013177\u2013183}}\n\nThe RS-25 engines had several improvements to enhance reliability and power. During the development program, Rocketdyne determined that the engine was capable of safe reliable operation at 104% of the originally specified thrust. To keep the engine thrust values consistent with previous documentation and software, NASA kept the original specified thrust as 100%, but had the RS-25 operate at higher thrust. RS-25 upgrade versions were denoted as Block I and Block II. 109% thrust level was achieved with the Block II engines in 2001, , which reduced the chamber pressue to {{convert|3010|psi|bar|sigfig=4|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}}, as it had a larger [[de Laval nozzle|throat]] area. The normal maximum throttle was 104 percent, with 106% or 109% used for mission aborts.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|106\u2013107}}\n\n====Orbital Maneuvering System====\n{{main|Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System}}\n\nThe Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) consisted of two aft-mounted [[AJ10|AJ10-190]] engines and the associated fuel pods. The AJ10 engines used [[monomethylhydrazine]] (MMH) oxidized by [[dinitrogen tetroxide]] (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). The pods carried a maximum of {{convert|4718|lb|kg|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=4|sp=us}} of MMH and {{convert|7773|lb|kg|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=4|sp=us}} of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. The OMS engines were used after main engine cut-off (MECO) for orbital insertion. Throughout the flight, they were used for orbit changes, as well as the deorbit burn prior to reentry. Each OMS engine produced {{convert|6087|lbf|N|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=4|sp=us}} of thrust, and the entire system could provide {{convert|1000|ft/s|m/s|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=3|sp=us}} of velocity change.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II\u201380}}\n\n====Thermal protection system====\n{{main|Space Shuttle thermal protection system}}\n\nThe orbiter was protected from heat during reentry by the thermal protection system (TPS), a [[Atmospheric entry#Thermal soak|thermal soaking]] protective layer around the orbiter. In contrast with previous US spacecraft, which had used ablative heat shields, the reusability of the orbiter required a multi-use heat shield.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|72\u201373}} During reentry, the TPS experienced temperatures up to {{convert|3000|F|C|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}, but had to keep the orbiter vehicle's aluminum skin temperature below {{convert|350|F|C|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The TPS primarily consisted of four types of tiles. The nose cone and leading edges of the wings experienced temperatures above {{convert|2300|F|C|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}, and were protected by reinforced carbon-carbon tiles (RCC).  Thicker RCC tiles were developed and installed in 1998 to prevent damage from [[space debris|micrometeoroid and orbital debris]], and were further improved after RCC damage caused of the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' disaster]].  Beginning with [[STS-114]], the orbiter vehicles were equipped with the wing leading edge impact detection system to alert the crew to any potential damage.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II\u2013112\u2013113}} The entire underside of the orbiter vehicle, as well as the other hottest surfaces, were protected with high-temperature reusable surface insulation. Areas on the upper parts of the orbiter vehicle were coated in a white low-temperature reusable surface insulation, which provided protection for temperatures below {{convert|1200|F|C|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The payload bay doors and parts of the upper wing surfaces were coated in reusable felt surface insulation, as the temperature there remained below {{convert|700|F|C|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|395}}\n\n===External tank===\n{{main|Space Shuttle external tank}}\n[[File:STS-29 External Tanker Separation.jpg|thumb|The external tank after separation on [[STS-29]]]]\n\nThe Space Shuttle external tank carried the propellant for the Space Shuttle Main Engines, and connected the orbiter vehicle with the solid rocket boosters. The external tank was {{convert|153.8|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} tall and {{convert|27.6|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} in diameter, and contained separate tanks for liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid hydrogren (LH<sub>2</sub>). The LOX tank was housed in the nose of the external tank, and was {{convert|49.3|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} tall. The LH<sub>2</sub> comprised the bulk of the external tank, and was {{convert|96.7|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} tall. The orbiter vehicle was attached to the external tank at two umbilical plates, which contained five propellant and two electrical umbilicals, and forward and aft structural attachments. The exterior of the external tank was covered in orange spray-on foam to allow it to survive the heat of ascent.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|421\u2013422}}\n\nThe external tank provided propellant to the Space Shuttle Main Engines from liftoff until main engine cutoff.  The external tank separated from the orbiter vehicle 18 seconds after engine cutoff, and could be triggered automatically or manually.  At the time of separation, the orbiter vehicle retracted its umbilical plates, and the umbilical cords were sealed to prevent excess propellant from venting into the orbiter vehicle.  After the bolts attached at the structural attachments were sheared, the external tank separated from the orbiter vehicle. At the time of separation, gaseous oxygen was vented from the nose to cause the external tank to tumble, ensuring that it would break up upon reentry. The external tank was the only major component of the Space Shuttle system that was not reused, and it would travel along a ballistic trajectory into the Indian or Pacific Ocean.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|422}}\n\nFor the first two missions, STS-1 and [[STS-2]], the external tank was covered in {{convert|595|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} of white Fire-Retardant Latex to provide further thermal insulation, but was determined to be unnecessary and removed, increasing the overall payload capacity..<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|421}} A light-weight tank (LWT) was first flown on STS-6, which reduced tank weight by {{convert|10300|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}.

The Space Shuttle was originally conceived of and presented to the public as a vehicle which would, among other things, be used to build a United States space station in LEO in the early 1990s. The U.S. space station evolved into the International Space Station project, which suffered from long delays and design changes before it could be completed. As a result, the retirement of the Space Shuttle was delayed several times until 2011, serving at least 15 years longer than originally planned.

Formed in 2011, it is the first AKB48 sister group outside Japan and adopts the concept of \"idols you can meet\",{{sfn|Oricon 2011}} before switching to \"idols that will come to meet you\" since 8 April 2018.

JKT48 takes its name from the group's base city of [[Jakarta]], Indonesia.{{sfn|Galbraith|2012|p=202}} The country was seen as a potential market for the idol business because of its relatively young population\u2014{{as of|2012}} about half are under the age of 30\u2014and the popularity of Japanese ''[[manga]]'' series, such as ''[[Slam Dunk (manga)|Slam Dunk]]'' and ''[[One Piece]]''.

That is why we decided to try it in Jakarta. Kids watched AKB on the internet and they want to do the same, but they don't know whether they have talent. Also it's difficult [for them] to go to Japan to audition.\"{{sfn|TalkAsia 2012}}</blockquote> Then Rakuten\u2013MNC chief marketing officer Reino Barack and Arya Sinulingga recounted of his visit to Japan: <blockquote>\"When I watched AKB48's theater performance in Akihabara, I sensed the potential for a new business in Indonesia.\"{{sfn|Nihon Keizai Shimbun 2012|p=1}}</blockquote>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== 2011\u20132012: Formation ===\n{{External media\n| align  = right\n| video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMexRrjqvw4 First live performance of JKT48].

Formed in 2011, it is the first AKB48 sister group outside Japan and adopts the concept of \"idols you can meet\",{{sfn|Oricon 2011}} before switching to \"idols that will come to meet you\" since 8 April 2018. Fans can attend daily performances at the group's theater, which was built as a close replica to the AKB48 Theater in [[Akihabara]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nWhile JKT48 does not restrict membership by nationality, applicants must be residents of Indonesia. As of 30 March 2020, the group has 38 individual team members, with one of them performs in two teams.<ref name=\"MembersProfile\">{{cite web|url=https://jkt48.com/member/list?lang=id|title=Profil Anggota|accessdate=30 March 2020|publisher=JKT48 Operation Team|work=jkt48.com|language=id}}</ref> It also has 35 Class A Academy members \u2013 formerly known as trainees.<ref name=\"AcademyProfile\">{{cite web|url=https://jkt48.com/jkt48-academy/member-academy|title=JKT48 Academy Members|accessdate=30 March 2020|publisher= JKT48 Operation Team|work=jkt48.com|language=id}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 February 2013, JKT48 released its first studio album ''[[Heavy Rotation (JKT48 album)|Heavy Rotation]]'' via Hits Records, a division of MNC subsidiary [[:id:Star Media Nusantara|PT Star Media Nusantara]]. It performs songs by AKB48 and other sister groups that are translated into Indonesian.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n== Conception ==\nMuch like [[AKB48]], the female [[Japanese idol]] group formed in 2005 in [[Akihabara]], Tokyo, JKT48 is based on the concept of idols with whom fans can \"'meet', or at least develop a similar feeling of intimacy\". JKT48 takes its name from the group's base city of [[Jakarta]], Indonesia.{{sfn|Galbraith|2012|p=202}} The country was seen as a potential market for the idol business because of its relatively young population\u2014{{as of|2012}} about half are under the age of 30\u2014and the popularity of Japanese ''[[manga]]'' series, such as ''[[Slam Dunk (manga)|Slam Dunk]]'' and ''[[One Piece]]''. In order to bring the concept of AKB48 to Indonesia, producer [[Yasushi Akimoto]] and Dentsu Media Group Indonesia partnered with the country's largest media conglomerate, [[Media Nusantara Citra|Global Mediacom]], and [[Rakuten]].{{sfn|Nihon Keizai Shimbun 2012|p=1}}\n\nIn an interview on CNN's ''[[TalkAsia]]'' program, Akimoto responded to the question of why he selected Indonesia as the first target of AKB48's overseas expansion: <blockquote>\"People in Indonesia were interested in AKB48. That is why we decided to try it in Jakarta. Kids watched AKB on the internet and they want to do the same, but they don't know whether they have talent. Also it's difficult [for them] to go to Japan to audition.\"{{sfn|TalkAsia 2012}}</blockquote> Then Rakuten\u2013MNC chief marketing officer Reino Barack and Arya Sinulingga recounted of his visit to Japan: <blockquote>\"When I watched AKB48's theater performance in Akihabara, I sensed the potential for a new business in Indonesia.\"{{sfn|Nihon Keizai Shimbun 2012|p=1}}</blockquote>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== 2011\u20132012: Formation ===\n{{External media\n| align  = right\n| video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMexRrjqvw4 First live performance of JKT48].

The university was corporatised on 23 April 1998.\n\nIt is in [[Sintok]], [[Kedah]]. It is known as a management university.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studymalaysia.com/where/profile.php?code=UUM|title=Institution Profile UUM| publisher=Study Malaysia|accessdate=22 January 2014}}</ref> UUM was ranked in the bracket of 591\u2014600 in the [[QS World University Rankings]] 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/universities/universiti-utara-malaysia-uum#wur|title=Universiti Utara Malaysia| publisher=Quacquarelli Symonds|accessdate=15 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe construction planning began in August 1983 when the [[Ministry of Education (Malaysia)|Ministry of Education]] began to plan the university. On 19 October 1983, the Cabinet gave its approval for this project in Kedah. At that time, the project was called \"The Sixth University Project\". Several months later, the temporary office of the Sixth University, officially named Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM), was officially opened on 15 February 1984 in Jitra.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studymalaysia.com/where/profile.php?code=UUM|title=Institution Profile UUM| publisher=Study Malaysia|accessdate=22 January 2014}}</ref> \n\nFour months after its official opening, the UUM office was relocated to the provisional Darul Aman Campus in [[Jitra]], in June 1984, when the first phase of the project had been completed. The first academic year began in June 1984. The Darul Aman Campus was on a 62-acre tract of land in [[Bandar Darulaman]]. It was 18&nbsp;km north of Alor Setar and 4.8&nbsp;km from Jitra.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uum.edu.my/index.php/en/visitor/the-university/about-uum|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130913134458/http://www.uum.edu.my/index.php/en/visitor/the-university/about-uum|url-status=dead|archive-date=13 September 2013|title=About UUM|publisher=UUM|accessdate=22 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the planning of a permanent campus had begun. It was to be built on an area of 1,061 hectares in Sintok (in the district of Kubang Pasu), 48 km north of Alor Setar and 10 km east of [[Changlun]], a small town along the North-South Highway, near the Malaysia-Thai border.\n\nThe permanent UUM campus, referred to as the Sintok Campus, began operations on 15 September 1990. In a former tin mining area, it is in a valley of lush tropical forests, embraced by blue hills, and watered by two rivers that flow along the middle of the campus. The rivers are Sungai Sintok and Sungai Badak.\n\nThe MYR580 million Sintok Campus was opened on 17 February 2004 by the Royal Chancellor, His Royal Highness [[Abdul Halim of Kedah|Sultan Abdul Halim Mu\u2019adzam Shah]]. The main buildings are the Sultanah Bahiyah Library, the Chancellery, the Sultan Badlishah Mosque, the Mu\u2019adzam Shah Hall, the Tan Sri Othman Hall, the Sports Complex, the Varsity Mall, the Budi Siswa building, the Convention Complex, and the buildings that house the departments of the academic colleges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uum.edu.my/index.php/en/visitor/the-university/about-uum|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130913134458/http://www.uum.edu.my/index.php/en/visitor/the-university/about-uum|url-status=dead|archive-date=13 September 2013|title=About UUM|publisher=UUM|accessdate=22 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2008, a restructuring of the university academic system was undertaken.

Other towns near UUM are [[Jitra]] and [[Changlun]].\n\nDue to its vast land area, the university has used 107 hectares of forest to develop facilities open for use by outsiders. Thus the campus has evolved into an open campus where outsiders and tourists visit. Among the facilities are a picnic area, a nine-hole golf course, a go-kart circuit, a shooting and archery range, and an equestrian site.\n\nThe training base and facilities for the [[Malaysian National Service]] Programme (PLKN) was on the campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://staging.ispkn.my/plkn-info/en/camp/camp-list/kedah/kem-plkn-sintok-uum-sintok/|title=PLKN Sintok Camp|accessdate=24 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201173711/http://staging.ispkn.my/plkn-info/en/camp/camp-list/kedah/kem-plkn-sintok-uum-sintok/|archive-date=1 February 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Kuala Lumpur Campus===\nUUMKL Campus is the first UUM fully owned study centre outside Sintok and operated directly by UUM.
