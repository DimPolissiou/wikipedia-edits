science advice in the [[European Commission]] was provided by a single Chief Scientific Advisor who reported directly to the [[President of the European Commission]]. The last Chief Scientific Advisor, serving from 2012 to 2014, was [[Anne Glover (biologist)|Dame Anne Glover]].\n\nOn 1 November 2014, European Commission President [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] asked [[Carlos Moedas]], Commissioner for [[European Commissioner for Research, Innovation and Science|Research, Innovation and Science]] in his mission letter to \"make sure that Commission proposals and activities are based on sound scientific evidence and contribute best to our jobs and growth agenda\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/sites/cwt/files/commissioner_mission_letters/moedas_en.pdf|title=Mission letter to Commissioner Moedas|last=Juncker|first=Jean-Claude|date=2014-11-01|website=European Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Following this, on 13 May 2015, Juncker announced the establishment of the Scientific Advice Mechanism. The first seven members of the Advisors were identified, following a European call for nominations, in January 2016.\n\nIn December 2016, SAPEA was officially launched to support the Advisors by providing scientific evidence review reports.\n\n==Structure==\n===Group of Chief Scientific Advisors===\nThe core of the Scientific Advice Mechanism is the European Commission's Group of Chief Scientific Advisors, an expert group consisting of up to seven leading scientists, selected by the European Commission assisted by an independent identification committee. The Advisors are supported by a dedicated secretariat, known as the SAM Unit, staffed by the [[Directorate-General for Research and Innovation (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Research and Innovation]] and [[Joint Research Centre]].\n\nThe Group of Chief Scientific Advisors currently consists of the following seven members:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"border:#555;\"\n|-\n!

The area was sparsely populated until gentleman farmers purchased land in the area in the 1940s.\n\nIn 1954, Sam and Jack Hoffman, owners of a father-son owned construction company, bought 160 acres of land in the area. The pair constructed homes and began the development the region which now bears their name. As residents moved in, they voted to incorporate the area, and the Village of Hoffman Estates was incorporated on September 23, 1959.<ref>{{cite web|title= Hoffman Estates, IL|url= http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/593.html|publisher=The Encyclopedia of Chicago|accessdate=Mar 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOnce the [[Interstate 90 in Illinois|Northwest Tollway]] opened, Schaumburg Township became more attractive to Chicago commuters.

The business park came to fruition in 1993 when Sears, Roebuck and Company relocated from the [[Sears Tower]] in Chicago to a sprawling headquarters in the northwest part of Prairie Stone.

The area was sparsely populated until gentleman farmers purchased land in the area in the 1940s.\n\nIn 1954, Sam and Jack Hoffman, owners of a father-son owned construction company, bought 160 acres of land in the area. The pair constructed homes and began the development the region which now bears their name.
