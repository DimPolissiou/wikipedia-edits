The Governor performs the same constitutional and ceremonial functions at the state level as does the [[Governor-General of Australia]] at the national level. In accordance with the conventions of the [[Westminster system]] of parliamentary government, the Governor nearly always acts solely on the advice of the head of the elected government, the [[Premier of South Australia]]. Nevertheless, the Governor retains the [[reserve powers]] of the Crown, and has the right to dismiss the Premier.

He spent the first two years of his life in orphanages until his adoption by a typographer named Carl Theodor Dreyer, and his wife, Inger Marie (n\u00e9e Olsen).

He dissociated himself from his adoptive family, but their teachings were to influence the themes of many of his films.\n\nDreyer was ideologically conservative. According to [[David Bordwell]], \"As a youth he belonged to the Social Liberal party, a conservative group radical only in their opposition to military expenditures...'Even when I was with ''[[Ekstra Bladet|Ekstrabladet]]'',' Dreyer recalled, 'I was conservative...I don't believe in revolutions.

I believe more in evolution, in the small advances.'\"<ref>{{cite book|title=The Films of Carl Theodor Dreyer|last=Bordwell|first=David|publisher=University of California Press|year=1983|page=191}}</ref>\n\nDreyer died of pneumonia in Copenhagen at age 79. The documentary ''[[Carl Th. Dreyer: My Metier]]'' contains reminiscences from those who knew him.\n\n==Career==\nAs a young man, Dreyer worked as a journalist, but he eventually joined the film industry as a writer of title cards for silent films and subsequently of screenplays. He was initially hired by [[Nordisk Film]] in 1913.\n\nHis first attempts at film direction had limited success, and he left Denmark to work in the French film industry. While living in France he met [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Jean Hugo]] and other members of the French artistic scene and in 1928 he made his first classic film, ''[[The Passion of Joan of Arc]]''. Working from the transcripts of Joan's trial, he created a masterpiece of emotion that drew equally on realism and expressionism. Dreyer used private finance from Baron [[Nicolas de Gunzburg]] to make his next film as the Danish film industry was in financial ruin. ''[[Vampyr]]'' (1932) is a surreal meditation on fear. Logic gave way to mood and atmosphere in this story of a man protecting two sisters from a vampire. The movie contains many indelible images, such as the hero, played by de Gunzburg (under the screen name Julian West), dreaming of his own burial and the animal blood lust on the face of one of the sisters as she suffers under the vampire's spell. The film was shot mostly silent but with sparse, cryptic dialogue in three separate versions \u2013 English, French and German.\n\nBoth films were box office failures, and Dreyer did not make another movie until 1943. Denmark was by now under Nazi occupation, and his ''[[Day of Wrath]]'' had as its theme the paranoia surrounding witch hunts in the seventeenth century in a strongly [[Theocracy|theocratic]] culture. With this work, Dreyer established the style that would mark his sound films: careful compositions, stark monochrome cinematography, and very long takes. In the more than a decade before his next full-length feature film, Dreyer made two documentaries. In 1955, he made ''[[Ordet]]'' (''The Word'') based on the play of the same name by [[Kaj Munk]]. The film combines a love story with a conflict of faith. Dreyer's last film was 1964's ''[[Gertrud (film)|Gertrud]]''. Although seen by some as a lesser film than its predecessors, it is a fitting close to Dreyer's career, as it deals with a woman who, through the tribulations of her life, never expresses regret for her choices.\n\nThe great, never finished project of Dreyer's career was a film about Jesus. Though a manuscript was written (published 1968) the unstable economic conditions and Dreyer's own demands of realism together with his switching engagement let it remain a dream.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Feature films===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=\"5%\"|Year\n!width=\"20%\"|English title\n!width=\"25%\"|Original title\n!width=\"10%\"|Production country\n!

Applying the methodology of the QNI, some economically strong countries have relatively unattractive nationalities. For example, the nationality of India shares the 106th place with the nationality of Senegal (2017 data). By contrast, some small countries have nationalities of larger value, such as those of Lithuania and Romania, which are ranked 22nd and 25th respectively in the QNI 2017.\n\nThe QNI is frequently cited in media such as ''[[Forbes]]'', [[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]], ''[[National Enquirer|The Enquirer]]'' and ''[[Business Standard]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/passport/2018/05/04/the-worlds-top-nationalities-a-ski-resort-with-a-slope-on-its-roof-and-more/#50564ae5483e |title=The World's Top Nationalities  |work=Forbes |date=2018-08-17 |accessdate=2018-08-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-buying-citizenship/ |title=Where the Super-Rich go to buy their second Passport |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2018-08-17 |accessdate=2018-08-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/984809/worlds-best-nationalities-for-2017-revealed-ph-ranks-125th |title=World's best Nationalities for 2017 revealed |publisher=The Enquirer |date=2018-08-17 |accessdate=2018-08-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/where-the-super-rich-go-to-buy-their-second-passport-118072100766_1.html |title=Looking for another Passport \u2013 Here are the most sought after countries |publisher=Business Standard |date=2018-08-17 |accessdate=2018-08-17}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Quality of Nationality Index results geographic distribution.jpg|thumb|QNI World Map]]\n\n== Methodology ==\nThe QNI takes a quantitative approach to determine the value of a nationality based on seven parameters, comprising both internal value (40%) and external value (60%). Three parameters reflect the internal value of a nationality: human development (15%), economic strength (15%), and peace and stability (10%). Four parameters reflect the external value of a nationality: diversity of travel freedom (15%), weight of travel freedom (15%), diversity of settlement freedom (15%), and weight of settlement freedom (15%).<ref>{{cite news|url=|title=Methodology of the QNI|last=Kochenov|first=Dimitry|work=The Quality of Nationality Index|accessdate=|publisher=Ideos Publishing|last2=Lindeboom|first2=Justin|year=2018|edition= 3rd|orig-year=2018}}</ref>\n\nVirtually all nationalities of the world as well as EU citizenship are included in the ranking. Not included are [[Camouflage passport|fantasy passports]] and nationalities of non-recognized states such as [[Abkhazia]], [[South Ossetia|South-Ossetia]], and [[Somaliland]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Quality of Nationality Index|last=Lindeboom|first=Justin|publisher=Ideos|year=2018|isbn=978-3-9524742-5-9|editor-last=Kochenov|editor-first=Dimitry|edition= 3rd|location=|pages=|chapter=The Quality of Nationalities of Countries That Don\u2019t Exist: Measuring the Value of Unrecognized Nationalities|editor-last2=Lindeboom|editor-first2=Justin}}</ref> All nationalities receive a score from 0% to 100%.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.businessinsider.de/nationalities-with-the-best-quality-of-life-2016-6?r=UK&IR=T|title= The 41 nationalities with the best quality of life |date= 2016-06-02 |website= www.businessinsider.de |access-date= 2018-07-30}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Quality of Nationality Index factors.jpg|thumb|Weighted distribution of factors to calculate the QNI score]]\n\n=== Internal parameters and sources ===\nThe data is aggregated from various objective sources. The internal factors present the quality of life and opportunities for personal growth within the country of origin of the holder of nationality.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://businesstech.co.za/news/lifestyle/239837/the-worlds-best-and-worst-nationalities-in-2018-including-south-africa/\n|title= The world's best and worst nationalities in 2018 \u2013 including South Africa |website= www.businesstech.co.za |access-date= 2018-08-07}}</ref>\n\n==== Human Development ====\nHuman Development is measured using the United Nations Development Programme Human Development Index ([[Human Development Index]]). The HDI was developed by Pakistani economist [[Mahbub ul Haq]] and Indian economist [[Amartya Sen]] which was further used to measure the country's development by the United Nations Development Program ([[UNDP]]). The index is based on the human development approach, developed by Ul Haq, often framed in terms of whether people are able to \"be\" and \"do\" desirable things in life. Examples include\u2014Being: well fed, sheltered, healthy; Doings: work, education, voting, participating in community life. Consequently, this index centres on three different human development areas: life expectancy at birth, expected years of education, and standard of living.\n\nThe QNI normalizes the HDI scores of the countries with which a particular nationality is associated to a 0-15% scale. The nationality of the highest-scoring country on the HDI gets the full 15% score, with the other nationalities being ranked proportionately.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.ireland.co.nz/june-2016-ireland-ranks-6th-in-first-global-index-to-rank-quality-of-nationalities/ |title= Global Launch of the First Edition of the Henley & Partners \u2013 Kochenov Quality of Nationality Index |website= www.ireland.co.nz / |access-date= 2018-08-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://qz.com/698645/german-citizenship-is-ranked-the-most-valuable-in-the-world/|title= German citizenship is ranked the most valuable in the world|website= www. qz.com / |access-date= 2018-08-07}}</ref>\n\n==== Economic Strength ====\nEconomic Strength of a nationality is based on the [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) at [[Purchasing Power Parity]] (PPP) of the country with which the nationality is associated. It is calculated from the data that is provided by the [[International Monetary Fund]]. If there is no reliable [[Purchasing Power Parity]] data available, non-PPP data from the [[World Bank]] <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/05/the-richest-countries-with-the-weakest-passports/ |title= These are the richest countries with the weakest passports |date= 2018-05-02 |website= www.weforum.org |access-date= 2018-07-30}}</ref> are used.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nationalityindex.com/methodology |title= Economic Strength |website= www.nationalityindex.com/ |access-date= 2018-07-30}}</ref> GDP at PPP scores are normalized to a 0-15% scale, the largest economy receiving the full 15% score.\n\n==== Peace and Stability ====\nPeace and Stability are calculated using data by the annual [[Global Peace Index]] (GPI). The index is published by the Institute for Economics and Peace.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nationalityindex.com/methodology |title= Peace and Stability |website= www.nationalityindex.com/ |access-date= 2018-07-30}}</ref> Peace and Stability accounts for 10% of the total QNI General Ranking scale.

The data is sourced from the International Air Transport Association [[IATA]]. The diversity of Travel Freedom accounts for 15% of the total QNI General Ranking scale.\n\n==== Weight of Travel Freedom ====\nWeight of Travel Freedom evaluates the quality of the travel freedom the holder of a nationality has without a visa or with a visa-on-arrival for short term visits. Unlike Diversity of Travel Freedom, which looks only at the number of destinations, Weight of Travel Freedom looks at the value of having visa-free or visa-on-arrival travel access to a particular country. This value is based on the Human Development (50%) and Economic Strength (50%) of each country destination.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nationalityindex.com/methodology|title= Quality of Nationality Index Methodology\n |website= www.nationalityindex.com/|access-date= 2018-08-06}}</ref> This is based on the presumption that for most people, having visa-free access to the United States of America is of higher value than having visa-free access to Sudan, for example.

The most advanced example of a regional organization which allows nationals of its Member States to freely settle in each of the other Member States is the [[European Union]]. However, similar regional organizations which include free settlement among Member States are [[Mercosur|MERCOSUR]], the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]], and [[Economic Community of West African States|Economic Community of Western African States]].

The data is collected from various sources with quantifiable data.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kochenov|first1=Dimitry|last2=Lindeboom|first2=Justin|date=October 2017|title=Empirical Assessment oft he Quality of Nationalities: The Quality of Nationality Index (QNI)|journal=European Journal of Comparative Law and Governance|volume=4|issue=4|pages=314\u2013336|doi=10.1163/22134514-00404007|ssrn=3053624}}</ref> The QNI was created by Dimitry Kochenov, an expert in citizenship, nationality and immigration law and constitutional law of the European Union at the [[University of Groningen]] and [[Christian K\u00e4lin]], chairman of [[Henley & Partners]].\n\n== Significance ==\nThe phenomenon of being a native of any country has also been described as \u2018a birthright lottery\u2019 by Professor of Law, Political Science, and Global Affairs [[Ayelet Shachar]] at the [[University of Toronto]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rorotoko.com/interview/20090828_shachar_ayelet_birthright_lottery_citizenship_global_inequality/?page=2 |title=Birthright is a Lottery |publisher=rorotoko.com |date=2018-08-17 |accessdate=2018-08-17}}</ref> At the same time, the QNI shows that nationalities diverge greatly in their practical value which often does not run parallel with the characteristics of the countries with which nationalities are associated, such as the economic power or the level of human development of the countries. Applying the methodology of the QNI, some economically strong countries have relatively unattractive nationalities. For example, the nationality of India shares the 106th place with the nationality of Senegal (2017 data). By contrast, some small countries have nationalities of larger value, such as those of Lithuania and Romania, which are ranked 22nd and 25th respectively in the QNI 2017.\n\nThe QNI is frequently cited in media such as ''[[Forbes]]'', [[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]], ''[[National Enquirer|The Enquirer]]'' and ''[[Business Standard]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/passport/2018/05/04/the-worlds-top-nationalities-a-ski-resort-with-a-slope-on-its-roof-and-more/#50564ae5483e |title=The World's Top Nationalities  |work=Forbes |date=2018-08-17 |accessdate=2018-08-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-buying-citizenship/ |title=Where the Super-Rich go to buy their second Passport |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2018-08-17 |accessdate=2018-08-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/984809/worlds-best-nationalities-for-2017-revealed-ph-ranks-125th |title=World's best Nationalities for 2017 revealed |publisher=The Enquirer |date=2018-08-17 |accessdate=2018-08-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/where-the-super-rich-go-to-buy-their-second-passport-118072100766_1.html |title=Looking for another Passport \u2013 Here are the most sought after countries |publisher=Business Standard |date=2018-08-17 |accessdate=2018-08-17}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Quality of Nationality Index results geographic distribution.jpg|thumb|QNI World Map]]\n\n== Methodology ==\nThe QNI takes a quantitative approach to determine the value of a nationality based on seven parameters, comprising both internal value (40%) and external value (60%). Three parameters reflect the internal value of a nationality: human development (15%), economic strength (15%), and peace and stability (10%). Four parameters reflect the external value of a nationality: diversity of travel freedom (15%), weight of travel freedom (15%), diversity of settlement freedom (15%), and weight of settlement freedom (15%).<ref>{{cite news|url=|title=Methodology of the QNI|last=Kochenov|first=Dimitry|work=The Quality of Nationality Index|accessdate=|publisher=Ideos Publishing|last2=Lindeboom|first2=Justin|year=2018|edition= 3rd|orig-year=2018}}</ref>\n\nVirtually all nationalities of the world as well as EU citizenship are included in the ranking. Not included are [[Camouflage passport|fantasy passports]] and nationalities of non-recognized states such as [[Abkhazia]], [[South Ossetia|South-Ossetia]], and [[Somaliland]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Quality of Nationality Index|last=Lindeboom|first=Justin|publisher=Ideos|year=2018|isbn=978-3-9524742-5-9|editor-last=Kochenov|editor-first=Dimitry|edition= 3rd|location=|pages=|chapter=The Quality of Nationalities of Countries That Don\u2019t Exist: Measuring the Value of Unrecognized Nationalities|editor-last2=Lindeboom|editor-first2=Justin}}</ref> All nationalities receive a score from 0% to 100%.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.businessinsider.de/nationalities-with-the-best-quality-of-life-2016-6?r=UK&IR=T|title= The 41 nationalities with the best quality of life |date= 2016-06-02 |website= www.businessinsider.de |access-date= 2018-07-30}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Quality of Nationality Index factors.jpg|thumb|Weighted distribution of factors to calculate the QNI score]]\n\n=== Internal parameters and sources ===\nThe data is aggregated from various objective sources. The internal factors present the quality of life and opportunities for personal growth within the country of origin of the holder of nationality.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://businesstech.co.za/news/lifestyle/239837/the-worlds-best-and-worst-nationalities-in-2018-including-south-africa/\n|title= The world's best and worst nationalities in 2018 \u2013 including South Africa |website= www.businesstech.co.za |access-date= 2018-08-07}}</ref>\n\n==== Human Development ====\nHuman Development is measured using the United Nations Development Programme Human Development Index ([[Human Development Index]]). The HDI was developed by Pakistani economist [[Mahbub ul Haq]] and Indian economist [[Amartya Sen]] which was further used to measure the country's development by the United Nations Development Program ([[UNDP]]). The index is based on the human development approach, developed by Ul Haq, often framed in terms of whether people are able to \"be\" and \"do\" desirable things in life. Examples include\u2014Being: well fed, sheltered, healthy; Doings: work, education, voting, participating in community life. Consequently, this index centres on three different human development areas: life expectancy at birth, expected years of education, and standard of living.\n\nThe QNI normalizes the HDI scores of the countries with which a particular nationality is associated to a 0-15% scale. The nationality of the highest-scoring country on the HDI gets the full 15% score, with the other nationalities being ranked proportionately.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.ireland.co.nz/june-2016-ireland-ranks-6th-in-first-global-index-to-rank-quality-of-nationalities/ |title= Global Launch of the First Edition oft he Henley & Partners \u2013 Kochenov Quality of Nationality Index |website= www.ireland.co.nz / |access-date= 2018-08-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://qz.com/698645/german-citizenship-is-ranked-the-most-valuable-in-the-world/|title= German citizenship is ranked the most valuable in the world|website= www. qz.com / |access-date= 2018-08-07}}</ref>\n\n==== Economic Strength ====\nEconomic Strength of a nationality is based on the [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) at [[Purchasing Power Parity]] (PPP) of the country with which the nationality is associated. It is calculated from the data that is provided by the [[International Monetary Fund]]. If there is no reliable [[Purchasing Power Parity]] data available, non-PPP data from the [[World Bank]] <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/05/the-richest-countries-with-the-weakest-passports/ |title= These are the richest countries with the weakest passports |date= 2018-05-02 |website= www.weforum.org |access-date= 2018-07-30}}</ref> are used.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nationalityindex.com/methodology |title= Economic Strength |website= www.nationalityindex.com/ |access-date= 2018-07-30}}</ref> GDP at PPP scores are normalized to a 0-15% scale, the largest economy receiving the full 15% score.\n\n==== Peace and Stability ====\nPeace and Stability are calculated using data by the annual [[Global Peace Index]] (GPI). The index is published by the Institute for Economics and Peace.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nationalityindex.com/methodology |title= Peace and Stability |website= www.nationalityindex.com/ |access-date= 2018-07-30}}</ref> Peace and Stability accounts for 10% of the total QNI General Ranking scale. Also here the nationality which is associated with the most peaceful country receives the full 10%. The other nationalities are ranked proportionately on the basis of the ranking scale used by the GPI.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.emirates247.com/business/economy-finance/first-index-to-rank-quality-of-nationalities-2016-06-03-1.631911|title= First index to rank quality of nationalities\n |website= www.emirates247.com/ |access-date= 2018-08-06}}</ref>\n\n=== External parameters and sources ===\nExternal factors identify the quality of opportunities and diversity the holder of a nationality can pursue outside the country of origin.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2016/06/02/a-new-ranking-of-every-countrys-citizenship|title= A new ranking of every country's citizenship |date= 2016-06-02 |website= www.economist.com |access-date= 2018-07-31}}</ref>\n\n==== Diversity of Travel Freedom ====\nDiversity of Travel Freedom is based on how many destinations the holder of a particular nationality can visit without a visa or with a visa-on-arrival <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nbr.co.nz/opinion/frances-macron-uses-culture-assert-worlds-top-soft-power-nationality|title= France's Macron uses culture to assert world's top 'soft power' nationality |website= www.nbr.co.nz|access-date= 2018-07-30}}</ref> for short-term tourist or business purposes. The data is sourced from the International Air Transport Association [[IATA]]. The diversity of Travel Freedom accounts for 15% of the total QNI General Ranking scale.\n\n==== Weight of Travel Freedom ====\nWeight of Travel Freedom evaluates the quality of the travel freedom the holder of a nationality has without a visa or with a visa-on-arrival for short term visits. Unlike Diversity of Travel Freedom, which looks only at the number of destinations, Weight of Travel Freedom looks at the value of having visa-free or visa-on-arrival travel access to a particular country. This value is based on the Human Development (50%) and Economic Strength (50%) of each country destination.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nationalityindex.com/methodology|title= Quality of Nationality Index Methodology\n |website= www.nationalityindex.com/|access-date= 2018-08-06}}</ref> This is based on the presumption that for most people, having visa-free access to the United States of America is of higher value than having visa-free access to Sudan, for example. Weight of Travel Freedom accounts for 15% of the total QNI General Ranking scale.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fundssociety.com/en/style/which-one-is-the-best-passport-to-have |title= Which One is the Best Passport to Have?\n |website= http://www.fundssociety.com/|access-date= 2018-08-06}}</ref>\n\n==== Diversity of Settlement Freedom ====\nDiversity of Settlement Freedom is based on the number of foreign countries in which the holder of a nationality can freely settle for at least 360 days with automatic access to work there.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennysouthan/2018/04/26/worlds-top-nationalities-revealed-france-is-number-one-us-ranks-27/#b6a6b847d46f |title= World's Top Nationalities Revealed: France Is No. 1, U.S. Ranks 27 |date= 2018-04-26 |website= www.forbes.com |access-date= 2018-07-30}}</ref> Diversity of Settlement Freedom accounts for 15% of the total QNI General Ranking scale. The most advanced example of a regional organization which allows nationals of its Member States to freely settle in each of the other Member States is the [[European Union]]. However, similar regional organizations which include free settlement among Member States are [[Mercosur|MERCOSUR]], the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]], and [[Economic Community of West African States|Economic Community of Western African States]]. Outside such regional organizations, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] is the only country that allows almost all foreigners to freely settle and work in its country.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Quality of Nationality Index|last=Delcour|first=Laure|publisher=Ideos Publishing|year=2017|isbn=978-0-9935866-6-8|editor-last=Kochenov|editor-first=Dimitry|edition= 2nd|chapter=Georgia}}</ref> If there is a \u2018[[Hard Brexit]]\u2019, British citizens may lose their settlement and working rights to more than 30 of the world's leading countries, seriously affecting the quality of the British nationality.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/travel/articles/949069/worlds-best-nationalists-revealed-france-winner|title=FRANCE is the world's best nationality according to new data \u2013 where does the UK rank?|date=2018-04-20|website=www.express.co.uk|access-date=2018-07-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2016/06/02/a-new-ranking-of-every-countrys-citizenship|title=A new ranking of every country's citizenship|date=2016-06-02|website=www.economist.com|access-date=2018-07-31}}</ref>\n\n==== Weight of Settlement Freedom ====\nWeight of Settlement Freedom evaluates the quality of the settlement freedom of the holder of a nationality. It does so by looking at the Human Development (50%) and Economic Strength (50%) of the countries to which the nationality holder has settlement access. Weight of Settlement Freedom accounts for 15% of the total QNI General Ranking scale.\n\nAs of 2017, France's quality of nationality is ranked the best in the world, according to the latest edition of the Quality of Nationality Index (QNI).<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Quality of Nationality Index|last=Platon|first=S\u00e9bastien|publisher=Ideos|year=2018|isbn=978-3-9524742-5-9|editor-last=Kochenov|editor-first=Dimitry|edition= 3rd|chapter=The French Nationality|editor-last2=Lindeboom|editor-first2=Justin}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.nbr.co.nz/opinion/frances-macron-uses-culture-assert-worlds-top-soft-power-nationality\n |title= France's Macron uses culture to assert world's top'soft power' nationality|date= 2016-05-29 |website= www.nbr.co.nz|access-date= 2018-08-08}}</ref>\nThe French nationality earned a score of 81.7% out of a possible 100%, fractionally ahead of Germany.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Quality of Nationality Index|last=Thym|first=Daniel|publisher=Ideos|year=2018|isbn=978-3-9524742-5-9|editor-last=Kochenov|editor-first=Dimitry|pages=|chapter=The German Nationality|editor-last2=Lindeboom|editor-first2=Justin}}</ref> While the difference between France's and Germany's results is relatively small, France's comparative advantage lies in its greater settlement freedom (attributable mainly to the country's former colonial empire<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennysouthan/2018/04/26/worlds-top-nationalities-revealed-france-is-number-one-us-ranks-27/#b6a6b847d46f |title= World's Top Nationalities Revealed: France Is No. 1, U.S. Ranks 27 |date= 2018-04-26 |website=  www.forbes.com |access-date= 2018-07-30}}</ref>).\n\n== Results ==\nFrance's quality of nationality is ranked the best in the world, according to the latest edition of the Quality of Nationality Index (2018 data).<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.nbr.co.nz/opinion/frances-macron-uses-culture-assert-worlds-top-soft-power-nationality |title= France's Macron uses culture to assert world's top'soft power' nationality|date= 2016-05-29 |website= www.nbr.co.nz|access-date= 2018-08-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20191121-its-good-be-french-quality-nationality-index-settlement-freedom-kalin-kochenov|title=France excels in enabling its citizens to move abroad|date= 2019-11-22 |website= www.rfi.fr|access-date= 2019-12-07}}</ref>The French nationality earned a score of 83.5% out of a possible 100%, fractionally ahead of Germany and the Netherlands.

In 1936, another straightening was carried out as a preliminary work to the construction of the [[Zurich Airport]] as well as to [[land improvement]] and future overbuilding. Due to the last regulation works in 1975 between [[Niederglatt]] and the Glatt's confluence to the Rhine, the [[hydroelectric]] [[power station]]s built in the late 19th century at the lower course of the stream disappeared.\n\nThe Glatt was formerly abounding with fish. Owing to the accelerated growth of [[Zurich metropolitan area|Zurich's agglomeration]] during the 20th century and the insufficiency of the purification plants built in the 1960s, it has been strongly polluted; from 1994 to 2002, the [[sewage]] system was restructured by driving a tunnel between the Glatt Valley and the [[Limmat Valley]].\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat-inline|Glatt (Rhine)}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{HDS|8762|Glatt|author=Martin Illi|date=2005-02-11}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Rhine Tributaries}}\n\n[[Category:Rivers of Switzerland]]\n[[Category:Rivers of the canton of Z\u00fcrich]]\n[[Category:Glatt basin| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox river\n| name              = Glatt\n| image             = D\u00fcbendorf - Glatt IMG 0979.jpg\n| image_caption     = At [[D\u00fcbendorf]]\n| source1_location  = [[Greifensee]]\n| mouth_location    = [[Rhine]] ([[Rheinsfelden]])\n| subdivision_type1 = Country\n| subdivision_name1 = [[Switzerland]]\n| length            = {{convert|35.7|km|mi|abbr=on}} {{GeoQuelle|CH|GS}}\n| source1_elevation = {{convert|435|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n| mouth_elevation   = {{convert|356|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n| mouth_coordinates   = {{coord|47.5740|N|8.4709|E|source:wikidata|display=it}}\n| progression         = {{PRhine}}\n| discharge1_avg    =\n| basin_size        =\n}}\n\n'''Glatt''' ({{IPA-de|\u02c8\u0261lat}}) is the name of a lesser [[tributary|affluent]] to the [[High Rhine]] in the [[Z\u00fcrcher Unterland|Unterland]] of the [[canton of Zurich]], [[Switzerland]].

All applicants must pass a state examination and be hired by a law enforcement agency within 4 years of graduation to be considered certified.\n====Kentucky====\nAll law enforcement officers in Kentucky, (except as listed below), hired after 1998 are required to complete the minimum screening, physical training and classroom requirements of the Kentucky's ''Police Officer Professional Standards (POPS)'' prior to being certified, and acting, as a law enforcement officer.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://docjt.ky.gov/history.html|title=Welcome to the Department of Criminal Justice Training|first=|last=bbowling@docjt.jus.state.ky.us|website=docjt.ky.gov|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref> Larger agencies, such as the [[Kentucky State Police]], as well as the [[Louisville Metro Police]] and the [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] Division of Police, operate their own police academies and may have requirements that exceed the minimum POPS standards. Agencies in Kentucky who do not run their own academies send their prospective officers to a 16-week basic training class at the Kentucky Department of Criminal Justice Training Academy, operated by the [[Kentucky Justice and Public Safety Cabinet]] and located on the campus of [[Eastern Kentucky University]] in [[Richmond, Kentucky|Richmond]]. <ref name=\"auto\"/> Exceptions to POPS training and certification are officers hired prior to 1998 and elected law enforcement officers whose duties and requirements are set forth in the [[Kentucky Constitution]]. These include [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriffs]], [[Constables in the United States|constables]], [[coroner]]s and [[jailer]]s, (though generally not deputies).  Many of these officeholders, however, hold POPS certification from previous employment as law enforcement officers prior to their election and some will receive POPS certification or approved equivalent training before taking office.\n====Maryland====\nIn Maryland, the [[Maryland Police and Correctional Training Commission]] is the civilian governing body that sets standards for law enforcement personnel within the state. Most major [[List of law enforcement agencies in Maryland|law enforcement agencies]] operate their own academy in which recruits must pass over 550 objectives including, (but not limited to), criminal and traffic law, officer safety techniques, [[self-defense|defensive tactics]], report writing, a 40-hour block of emergency vehicle operations, a 40-hour block of [[Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation|First Responder]], and a 40-hour block of weapon training.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dpscs.state.md.us/aboutdpscs/pct/peltp/peltp.shtml|title=DPSCS.state.md.us|publisher=|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref> Most agencies operate non-resident academies; however, the [[Maryland State Police]] requires recruits to live at the academy and, dependent on their performance level for the week, may leave campus for the weekend.<ref>[http://recruiting.mdsp.org/training.asp Recruiting.mdsp.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005063842/http://recruiting.mdsp.org/training.asp |date=October 5, 2011 }}</ref> Many colleges such as the [[University of Maryland]] and other [[community colleges]] offer police academy instruction as well.<ref>[http://www.outlook.umd.edu/article.cfm?id=2041 Outlook.umd.edu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607130843/http://www.outlook.umd.edu/article.cfm?id=2041 |date=June 7, 2010 }}</ref>\n====Michigan====\nIn Michigan, in order to become law enforcement officers, all applicants have the option to be certified by the ''Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards'' or MCOLES. All persons wishing to become police officers in the State of Michigan must be certified through MCOLES. Cadets must pass a physical fitness exam as well as a reading and writing exam. Applicants also cannot have any felonies, weapons violations, or a history of domestic violence posted on their criminal records. Police academies are most often part of [[community colleges]], city or county police and sheriff departments, or the [[Michigan State Police]].\n\nAfter the police academy, candidates take the MCOLES test. Upon successful completion, candidates are 'certifiable' and have a period of one year to obtain employment as law enforcement officers, (if not sponsored by an agency). If a candidate is unable to obtain a law enforcement position within that year, and if the candidate wishes to be considered in the future, he/she must attend a two-week re-certification course, which adds a year to the candidate's window of opportunity.\n====New Hampshire====\nNew Hampshire's PSTC, (Police Standards and Training Council), provides all training and maintains certification standards for every full and part-time law enforcement officer in the state. This includes anyone who has the power of arrest, (except federal officers), under New Hampshire law.   The PSTC also provides training and certification for correctional officers employed directly by the State. All recruits must have at least a conditional offer of employment from a law enforcement agency, have a clear background check, pass a medical exam and a physical fitness test. Agencies may add other qualifications such as education, polygraph, and drug exams. The PSTC law enforcement academies require each recruit to qualify with a firearm, demonstrate driving skills, maintaining physical fitness, pass subject matter exams and scenario evaluations as a condition of certification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pstc.nh.gov/|title=NH Police Standards and Training Council|website=www.pstc.nh.gov|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nMost agencies in the state use a Field Training Officer program to provide additional training and evaluation of new hires.\n====Texas====\nThe agency which certifies police academies in Texas is the [[Texas Commission on Law Enforcement]] (TCOLE). Many major cities and sheriff's offices also operate their own training academies, while some smaller municipalities cooperate to maintain regional academies. Some community colleges offer police training courses as well. There are three state-level law enforcement academies: the [[Texas Highway Patrol|Texas Department of Public Safety]] which trains state troopers, the [[Texas Parks and Wildlife Department]] who train game wardens, and the [[Texas Department of Criminal Justice]] that trains state [[Corrections Officer|corrections officers]]. Police academies typically last from 18 to 30 weeks, though there are many variations. All police cadets are required to obtain at least a Basic Peace Officer Proficiency Certification from TCOLE before beginning active duty; some academies also require their cadets to obtain an Intermediate certification before graduating. TCOLE offers certifications for jailers and corrections officers, who must also undergo training prior to being commissioned, (albeit typically much less than police officers).\n====Utah====\nThe basis of the Utah basic training for police officers is to protect the community and the citizens the officers are serving. They do this by completing basic training, firearms training, curriculum development, canine training, defensive tactics, emergency vehicle operations, and physical fitness training. Training for Utah officers is broken into two separate sections, called blocks. The two blocks are Special Functions and Law Enforcement. In order to be certified in the state of Utah an individual must successfully finish both blocks of training. This training is intended to teach the officers to be as professional and as up to date as possible. Officers are also required to do an additional 40 hours of training annually in order to stay up to date on all current laws and police procedures.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://publicsafety.utah.gov/post/academy/basic.html|title = Utah Department of Public Safety|date = March 8, 2013|accessdate = March 20, 2015|website = The Academy - Basic Training Bureau|publisher = State of Utah|last = |first = |url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402151823/http://publicsafety.utah.gov/post/academy/basic.html|archivedate = April 2, 2015|df = }}</ref>\n\n===Vietnam===\nLocated in Tu Liem district, [[Hanoi]], [[Vietnam]], The Vietnam People's Police Academy is one of the leading schools of the [[Vietnam People's Public Security]], training officers with university degrees and postgraduate degrees.

After successful completion of the study and training programs, the student will be awarded a bachelor's degree in Police Sciences and Criminal Justice.\n\n====Dubai====\nThe Dubai Police Academy was founded in 1987 and was granted autonomy from the police force as long as it retained some affiliation with Dubai Police General Headquarters. It was fully inaugurated in 1989 in the presence of [[Sheikh Maktoum Bin Rashid Al Maktoum]]. In 1992, degrees offered by the academy were given university equivalency. \n\nThe first class was from 1987 to 1988 and consisted of 51 cadets and 30 full-time students, (some of whom were existing police officers), which graduated in 1991. During the academic year of 1996\u20131997, students from other Arabic countries such as Yemen and the Palestinian Territories were admitted.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n\n====England and Wales====\nAll candidates for the 43 police forces for England and Wales must be over the age of 18\u00bd; of a reasonable standard of physical fitness, with good health and eyesight.  Candidates also must hold British citizenship, be a citizen of the Commonwealth with no restrictions on his or her stay within Britain or be a citizen of the Republic of Ireland. All candidates serve two years as probationary constables, which will be spent training in both academic and practical situations. From 2007, all training was managed by the now defunct [[National Policing Improvement Agency]] with the [[College of Policing]] taking over in 2013.\n\n====Scotland====\nAll new police officers in Scotland attend an initial 11-week training course at the [[Scottish Police College]] at [[Tulliallan Castle]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Training - Police Officers - Police Scotland|url=http://www.scotland.police.uk/recruitment/police-officers/training/|website=Police Service of Scotland - Training Information|accessdate=7 October 2016}}</ref> The college has been operating since 1954 and hosts initial training of new officers as well as a range of courses such as the training of traffic officers and detectives.<ref>{{cite web|title=Police Scotland College - About Us - Police Scotland|url=http://www.scotland.police.uk/about-us/police-scotland/scottish-police-college/|website=Police Service of Scotland - About Us|accessdate=7 October 2016}}</ref> Many courses have received accreditation from the [[Scottish Qualifications Authority]] (SQA) or are credit rated on the [[Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework]] (SCQF).

Each state has an agency that certifies state-specific police academies and their programs. Most states have minimum physical and academic requirements to be completed prior to entry into the academy. Some states may require additional certifications before qualification as a police officer. While some states allow open enrollment in police academies, many require cadets to be hired by a police department in order to attend training. Departments and/or state certification agencies may also require individuals to pass background checks, psychological evaluations, polygraph exams, drug screenings, firearms qualifications and demonstrations of driving skills as prerequisites of employment/certification.\n====Federal====\nWhile some federal law enforcement agencies have their own training requirements and training facilities, 91 federal law enforcement agencies (including the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and [[United States Marshals Service]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fletc.gov/current-partners|title=Current Partners - FLETC|website=www.fletc.gov|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref> require agents, officers and prospective agents/officers to attend basic and in-service training at the [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers]] (FLETC).

Their training is conducted at \"The Connecticut Police Academy\" located at 285 Preston Avenue, in [[Meriden, CT]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ct.gov/post/|title=Police Officer Standards and Training Council|first=|last=POST|website=www.ct.gov|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref> In order to become a certified police officer, a recruit must be a legal United States resident at least 21 years of age, have a high school diploma or equivalent, possess a valid drivers license, and not be convicted of any felonies.<ref>{{Cite web|title = POSTC: Frequently Asked Questions|url = http://www.ct.gov/post/cwp/view.asp?a=2058&Q=291946&postNav=&#124;42935&#124;|website = www.ct.gov|accessdate = 2015-05-05|first = |last =}}</ref> The to be officers then have to attend an 818-hour basic training course that covers various aspects of police work.<ref>http://www.ct.gov/post/lib/post/pdf_documents/818_basic_training_curriculum_jan_09.pdf</ref> This basic training course is certified by [[Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies]], (CALEA).\n====Florida====\nIn Florida, police academies are primarily run by community colleges or state agencies. All law enforcement officers in the state are certified as such by a governing body appointed by the governor called the ''Criminal Justice Standards and Training Commission'' under the [[Florida Department of Law Enforcement]]. All applicants must pass a state examination and be hired by a law enforcement agency within 4 years of graduation to be considered certified.\n====Kentucky====\nAll law enforcement officers in Kentucky, (except as listed below), hired after 1998 are required to complete the minimum screening, physical training and classroom requirements of the Kentucky's ''Police Officer Professional Standards (POPS)'' prior to being certified, and acting, as a law enforcement officer.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://docjt.ky.gov/history.html|title=Welcome to the Department of Criminal Justice Training|first=|last=bbowling@docjt.jus.state.ky.us|website=docjt.ky.gov|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref> Larger agencies, such as the [[Kentucky State Police]], as well as the [[Louisville Metro Police]] and the [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] Division of Police, operate their own police academies and may have requirements that exceed the minimum POPS standards. Agencies in Kentucky who do not run their own academies send their prospective officers to a 16-week basic training class at the Kentucky Department of Criminal Justice Training Academy, operated by the [[Kentucky Justice and Public Safety Cabinet]] and located on the campus of [[Eastern Kentucky University]] in [[Richmond, Kentucky|Richmond]]. <ref name=\"auto\"/> Exceptions to POPS training and certification are officers hired prior to 1998 and elected law enforcement officers whose duties and requirements are set forth in the [[Kentucky Constitution]]. These include [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriffs]], [[Constables in the United States|constables]], [[coroner]]s and [[jailer]]s, (though generally not deputies).  Many of these officeholders, however, hold POPS certification from previous employment as law enforcement officers prior to their election and some will receive POPS certification or approved equivalent training before taking office.\n====Maryland====\nIn Maryland, the [[Maryland Police and Correctional Training Commission]] is the civilian governing body that sets standards for law enforcement personnel within the state. Most major [[List of law enforcement agencies in Maryland|law enforcement agencies]] operate their own academy in which recruits must pass over 550 objectives including, (but not limited to), criminal and traffic law, officer safety techniques, [[self-defense|defensive tactics]], report writing, a 40-hour block of emergency vehicle operations, a 40-hour block of [[Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation|First Responder]], and a 40-hour block of weapon training.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dpscs.state.md.us/aboutdpscs/pct/peltp/peltp.shtml|title=DPSCS.state.md.us|publisher=|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref> Most agencies operate non-resident academies; however, the [[Maryland State Police]] requires recruits to live at the academy and, dependent on their performance level for the week, may leave campus for the weekend.<ref>[http://recruiting.mdsp.org/training.asp Recruiting.mdsp.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005063842/http://recruiting.mdsp.org/training.asp |date=October 5, 2011 }}</ref> Many colleges such as the [[University of Maryland]] and other [[community colleges]] offer police academy instruction as well.<ref>[http://www.outlook.umd.edu/article.cfm?id=2041 Outlook.umd.edu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607130843/http://www.outlook.umd.edu/article.cfm?id=2041 |date=June 7, 2010 }}</ref>\n====Michigan====\nIn Michigan, in order to become law enforcement officers, all applicants have the option to be certified by the ''Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards'' or MCOLES. All persons wishing to become police officers in the State of Michigan must be certified through MCOLES. Cadets must pass a physical fitness exam as well as a reading and writing exam. Applicants also cannot have any felonies, weapons violations, or a history of domestic violence posted on their criminal records. Police academies are most often part of [[community colleges]], city or county police and sheriff departments, or the [[Michigan State Police]].\n\nAfter the police academy, candidates take the MCOLES test. Upon successful completion, candidates are 'certifiable' and have a period of one year to obtain employment as law enforcement officers, (if not sponsored by an agency). If a candidate is unable to obtain a law enforcement position within that year, and if the candidate wishes to be considered in the future, he/she must attend a two-week re-certification course, which adds a year to the candidate's window of opportunity.\n====New Hampshire====\nNew Hampshire's PSTC, (Police Standards and Training Council), provides all training and maintains certification standards for every full and part-time law enforcement officer in the state. This includes anyone who has the power of arrest, (except federal officers), under New Hampshire law.   The PSTC also provides training and certification for correctional officers employed directly by the State. All recruits must have at least a conditional offer of employment from a law enforcement agency, have a clear background check, pass a medical exam and a physical fitness test. Agencies may add other qualifications such as education, polygraph, and drug exams. The PSTC law enforcement academies require each recruit to qualify with a firearm, demonstrate driving skills, maintaining physical fitness, pass subject matter exams and scenario evaluations as a condition of certification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pstc.nh.gov/|title=NH Police Standards and Training Council|website=www.pstc.nh.gov|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nMost agencies in the state use a Field Training Officer program to provide additional training and evaluation of new hires.\n====Texas====\nThe agency which certifies police academies in Texas is the [[Texas Commission on Law Enforcement]] (TCOLE). Many major cities and sheriff's offices also operate their own training academies, while some smaller municipalities cooperate to maintain regional academies. Some community colleges offer police training courses as well. There are three state-level law enforcement academies: the [[Texas Highway Patrol|Texas Department of Public Safety]] which trains state troopers, the [[Texas Parks and Wildlife Department]] who train game wardens, and the [[Texas Department of Criminal Justice]] that trains state [[Corrections Officer|corrections officers]]. Police academies typically last from 18 to 30 weeks, though there are many variations. All police cadets are required to obtain at least a Basic Peace Officer Proficiency Certification from TCOLE before beginning active duty; some academies also require their cadets to obtain an Intermediate certification before graduating. TCOLE offers certifications for jailers and corrections officers, who must also undergo training prior to being commissioned, (albeit typically much less than police officers).\n====Utah====\nThe basis of the Utah basic training for police officers is to protect the community and the citizens the officers are serving. They do this by completing basic training, firearms training, curriculum development, canine training, defensive tactics, emergency vehicle operations, and physical fitness training. Training for Utah officers is broken into two separate sections, called blocks. The two blocks are Special Functions and Law Enforcement. In order to be certified in the state of Utah an individual must successfully finish both blocks of training. This training is intended to teach the officers to be as professional and as up to date as possible. Officers are also required to do an additional 40 hours of training annually in order to stay up to date on all current laws and police procedures.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://publicsafety.utah.gov/post/academy/basic.html|title = Utah Department of Public Safety|date = March 8, 2013|accessdate = March 20, 2015|website = The Academy - Basic Training Bureau|publisher = State of Utah|last = |first = |url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402151823/http://publicsafety.utah.gov/post/academy/basic.html|archivedate = April 2, 2015|df = }}</ref>\n\n===Vietnam===\nLocated in Tu Liem district, [[Hanoi]], [[Vietnam]], The Vietnam People's Police Academy is one of the leading schools of the [[Vietnam People's Public Security]], training officers with university degrees and postgraduate degrees.

Two limited series from 2007\u20132009, ''[[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown]]'' and ''[[Final Crisis]]'', feature an evil version of Mary Marvel having acquired powers from first Shazam Family archenemy [[Black Adam]] and further from [[Apokolips|Apokoliptian]] supervillain god [[Desaad]]. In current continuity following DC's 2011 [[New 52]] reboot, Mary Bromfield appears as one of Billy Batson's foster siblings, and can share Billy's power by saying \"Shazam\" to become an adult superhero similar to the traditional Mary Marvel (the \"Marvel\" monikers having been retired with the reboot).\n\nMary Bromfield and Lady Shazam both made their cinematic debut in the [[DC Extended Universe]] film [[Shazam! (film)|''Shazam!'']], played by [[Grace Fulton]] and [[Michelle Borth]], respectively.\n\n==Publication history==\n\n===Fawcett Comics===\n[[File:CaptainMarvel18.jpg |left|thumb|175px|The first appearance of Mary Marvel, from ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #18 (1942).

Rather than give his young heroine the questionable powers of a Greek poet from the isle of Lesbos, Reed suggested that [[Selene]], goddess of the moon, might be a more wholesome choice.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Benton |first1=Mike |title=Superhero Comics of the Golden Age: The Illustrated History |date=1992 |publisher=Taylor Publishing Company |location=Dallas |isbn=0-87833-808-X |pages=117-118 |url=https://archive.org/details/superherocomicso0000bent/page/118 |accessdate=15 January 2020}}</ref>}}\n\nSoon after her introduction, Mary Marvel headlined ''[[Wow Comics]]'', and by 1945 had her own ''Mary Marvel'' book. She also appeared in ''[[Marvel Family|The Marvel Family]]'' book with Captain Marvel and Captain Marvel Jr. In her solo adventures, Mary soon gained sidekicks in her kindly [[Uncle Marvel]], who was not actually her uncle nor a Marvel, and his similarly nonpowered niece, Freckles Marvel. Uncle Marvel was eventually made the Marvel Family's manager, and also served as Mary's guardian.\n\nJust before the [[Marvel Family]]'s adventures ceased publication in 1953, Mary Marvel's costume and appearance were altered: the neckline of her blouse was lowered slightly, her hair was shortened, and she now wore yellow slippers instead of the customary Marvel Family yellow boots. After Fawcett canceled their superhero comics line because of a [[National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications|copyright infringement lawsuit with National Comics (later DC Comics)]], Mary Marvel hosted a puzzle page drawn by [[C. C. Beck]] on page 33 of ''Mysteries of Unexplored World'' issue 1 ([[Charlton Comics]] August 1956). After that, Mary and her teammates went unseen for years.\n\n===DC Comics===\n\n====1973\u20131985====\nIn 1972, DC Comics licensed the rights to the Marvels, and revived them in a new comic series called ''Shazam!''. Mary, Cap, and Junior appeared in both new stories and reprints of their classic stories. According to Shazam #1 the Sivanas had put the Marvel family into suspended animation for 20 years, along with themselves (by mistake) and much of the supporting cast. The comic book was canceled by 1978, and the ''Shazam!'' stories were relegated to the back pages of ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' (from 1979 to 1982) and ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' (from 1982 to 1983). After the 1985 ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' miniseries, Captain Marvel's origin was rebooted in the ''Shazam: The New Beginning'' miniseries in 1987. The Marvel Family was written out of the ''Shazam!'' mythos, and neither Mary Batson nor Mary Marvel appeared in DC Comics for several years.\n\n====1994\u20131999====\nMary Batson was reintroduced in ''[[The Power of Shazam!]]'' graphic novel by [[Jerry Ordway]] in 1994. An ongoing series followed in the next year, and Mary Marvel was introduced into the modern [[DC Universe]] with a new origin story in ''Power of Shazam!'' #4.\n\nWhen calling upon her powers, Mary is transformed into an adult resembling her late mother (in the same way that Billy resembles his father when in Marvel form). Mary shares the title of Captain Marvel with her brother. Various characters in the series distinguish the two by gender when addressing them, addressing Mary as \"the lady Captain Marvel\".\n\nAt first, Mary's costume was the same as her original one. However, beginning with ''Power of Shazam!'' #28, Mary donned a white costume to distinguish herself from her brother. The color change was retained for most future uses of the character during the next decade.\n\n====2000s====\nAfter the ''Power of Shazam!'' series ended in 1999, Mary's superpowered alter ego was officially rechristened \"Mary Marvel.\"  In 2002 she had lunch with Supergirl in \"The Clubhouse of Solitude\", in the spoof graphic anthology \"[[Bizarro]] Comics\". Since then, she has guest-starred in both ''Superman'' and ''Supergirl'' comics. In 2003, Mary became a member of an offshoot of the [[Justice League]] known as the [[Super Buddies]] in the ''[[Super Buddies#Formerly Known as the Justice League|Formerly Known as the Justice League]]'' miniseries, which juxtaposed her [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]]-era personality with the modern-day world for comic effect.\n\nMary Marvel appears briefly in several stories relating to DC's 2005\u20132006 ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' crossover. Mary also appeared in DC's weekly limited series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', with her most substantial appearance being in ''52'' #16 as the [[wedding ceremony participants#Maid of honor|maid of honor]] at the wedding of [[Black Adam]] and [[Isis (DC Comics)|Isis]], two ''Shazam!''-related characters. She was defeated by Black Adam during [[World War III (DC Comics)]] along with the other Marvels.\n\nIn 2006, DC began a revamp of the ''Shazam!'' mythos with [[Judd Winick]] and [[Howard Porter (artist)|Howard Porter's]] ''Trials of Shazam!'' limited series. The series began with a preview within the pages of ''[[One Year Later#New series|Brave New World]]'' #1 in June 2006, in which Mary Batson loses her powers, suffers a three-mile fall, and falls into a coma. This set up Mary's appearances as a main character in ''Countdown'', a weekly DC series which served as the successor to ''52''. During the course of the series, head writer [[Paul Dini]] and his collaborators had Mary acquire the powers of Black Adam, which give her a new look including a form-fitting long-sleeved black uniform and skirt with black lace-up boots. While the series tracked the character's struggle between good and evil, due to manipulation by supervillainesses [[Eclipso]] and [[Granny Goodness]] (promotional material for the series used the catchphrase \"[[Seduction of the Innocent#In popular culture|Seduction of the Innocent]],\" a reference to [[Fredric Wertham]]'s [[Seduction of the Innocent|book of the same title]]),{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Mary emerged from the series under the influence of [[Superman]] villain [[Darkseid]].\n\nThis darker Mary Marvel appears in DC's 2008 crossover series ''[[Final Crisis]]'', written by [[Grant Morrison]] and illustrated by [[J. G. Jones]], as a [[Female Furies|Female Fury]], with another design change (to match the styles of the other Furies) and a fully evil personality due to possession by the [[New Gods|New God]] [[Desaad]].<ref>''Final Crisis'' #5</ref> Though defeated by [[Captain Marvel Jr.|Freddy Freeman/Shazam]] before the end of the ''Final Crisis'' miniseries, the evil Mary appeared again in the \"Black Adam and Isis\" arc featured in ''[[Justice Society of America]]'' (vol. 3) #23\u201325, by the end of which she has lost her powers and returned to being a normal teenage girl.\n\n====2010s====\nIn 2011, following its ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' company-wide event, DC  made sweeping continuity changes to some comic book series and minor ones to others, as part of its relaunch event \"[[The New 52]]\". Captain Marvel, now known as Shazam, received a new origin story as part of a ''Shazam!'' backup feature by writer [[Geoff Johns]] and penciler [[Gary Frank]], published between 2012 and 2013 in the relaunched ''[[Justice League]]'' comic series.<ref name=\"JL23Review\"/> Mary does not feature in the new continuity until ''Justice League'' #8 (2012), and is not transformed into a superhero for the first time until ''Justice League'' #21 (2013), when Billy directs his powers into her, Freddy, and their foster siblings Darla, Pedro, and Eugene during a fray with Black Adam.<ref name=\"JL23Review\">{{Cite web |url=https://batman-news.com/2013/06/26/new-52-justice-league-21-review/ |title=New 52 \u2013 Justice League #21 review |last=Andrew Asberry |date=2013-06-26 |website=Batman News |language=en-US |access-date=2018-12-08}}</ref>\n\nMary was largely absent from the main DC Universe for several years after ''Justice League'' #22 in 2013.

Art by [[Kurt Schaffenberger]].]]\n\n===Original Fawcett origin===\nMary Marvel's [[first appearance]] in ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #18 also relayed her origin story.\n\nAs infants, twins Billy and Mary Batson were nursed by a woman named Sarah Primm. When the Batsons' parents die in a car accident, Primm was required to send both children to an orphanage. However, Primm is determined to at least give one of the children a home, and arranges for Mary to secretly take the place of another baby girl who had suddenly died while under Primm's care. As a result, Billy is sent to an orphanage while his sister is raised by the wealthy Mrs. Bromfield.\n\nSeveral years later, Billy Batson becomes a teenage radio announcer. While hosting an on-air [[quizbowl]], he receives an urgent letter from Sarah Primm, now on her death bed, requesting his presence. Billy goes to see her during a break, and Primm tells him the secret of his long-lost sister. To help him find Mary, Primm gives Billy a locket broken in half and tells the boy with her last breaths that Mary wears the other half.\n\nAfter the quizbowl broadcast is over, Billy tells his best friend Freddy Freeman about his sister and the locket. Billy then recalls that one of the quizbowl contestants, a rich girl named Mary Bromfield, wore a broken locket. He and Freddy trail Mary's limousine in their superpowered forms of [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and [[Captain Marvel Jr.]] and find themselves called into service to save Mary from a gang of kidnappers.\n\nCaptain Marvel then learns that Mary's locket matches his own, and that she is indeed Billy's sister. The Marvels reveal their secret identities to Mary, who wonders if, since she is Billy's twin, she could become a Marvel by saying the magic word \"Shazam\". Billy, however, is assured that \"Old Shaz\u2014er\u2014you know who\u2014wouldn\u2019t give his powers to a girl!\"\n\nJust then, the kidnappers awaken then bind and gag Billy and Freddy, preventing them from saying their magic words. Mary exclaims that Billy cannot say \"Shazam\", inadvertently saying the word herself. She is then struck by a magic [[lightning]] bolt and transformed into a super-powered version of herself, later christened \"Mary Marvel\" by her brother. She defeats the thugs by herself, discovering that she is bulletproof and has super strength, and frees Billy and Freddy. [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]] later reveals [[#Powers and abilities|the goddesses Mary derives her powers from]].\n\n===Modified DC origin===\n[[Image:Fkajl-mary-1.jpg|175px|thumb|Mary Marvel in her white uniform in ''[[Super Buddies#Formerly Known as the Justice League|Formerly Known as the Justice League]]'' #1 (2003). Art by [[Kevin Maguire (artist)|Kevin Maguire]] and [[Josef Rubinstein]].]]\nMary Marvel's updated DC origin was presented in the ''Power of Shazam!'' graphic novel and ongoing series, written by Jerry Ordway.\n\nProminent archaeologists C.C. and Marilyn Batson are assigned by the [[Doctor Sivana|Sivana]] expedition on an excursion to Egypt. They take along their young daughter Mary, but are forced to leave their son Billy in America with C.C.'s half-brother. The elder Batsons are killed by their associate [[Black Adam|Theo Adam]], who then kidnaps Mary. Upon Theo Adam's return to the United States, Adam's sister, a maid named Sarah Primm, takes Mary into her care. Primm arranges for her childless employers, Nick and Nora Bromfield, to illegally adopt Mary. As Mary Bromfield, the young girl grows up living an idyllic life in a wealthy family, but continuously has dreams of another family with a brother she has never seen.\n\nMeanwhile, Billy eventually finding himself on the streets, and is given the power to become Captain Marvel. He learns that Mary is still alive, but after four years of searching, neither he nor his benefactor, the wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]], can find the girl. The only thing Billy has to remember Mary by is her favorite toy, a \"Tawky Tawny\" doll, which was shipped to America with the Batsons\u2019 possessions after their murders.\n\nAs a young teenager, Mary enters a regional [[spelling bee]] held in [[Fawcett City]] and emceed by Billy, who works as an on-air reporter for WHIZ radio. After saving Mary from kidnappers twice as Captain Marvel, Billy notices how much Mary Bromfield reminds him of Mary Batson and has an undercover cop named \"Muscles\" McGinnis retrieve the girl's forged adoption record. Learning that Mary is indeed his sister, Billy tries to figure out a way to let Mary know he is her brother. The old \"[[Marvel Family#Marvel Family allies|Tawky Tawny]]\" doll suddenly transforms into a full-sized humanoid tiger and comes to life, instructing Billy to take it to Mary. As Captain Marvel, Billy flies out to the Bromfields\u2019 hometown of Fairfield to deliver the doll and the adoption papers to Mary.\n\nCaptain Marvel arrives at the Bromfield estate and changes back to Billy Batson to deliver the package, but is immediately kidnapped by the thugs who helped Primm forge Mary's adoption records. Mary, not having seen Billy, takes the package and opens it, discovering the adoption records and the Tawky Tawny doll. Once again, the doll comes to life and instructs the bewildered girl to say the magic word \"Shazam\" and save her brother. Mary complies and is transformed by a bolt of magic lightning into a superpowered doppelganger of her deceased mother. She saves Billy, who transforms into Captain Marvel to help Mary defeat the thugs, but the two Marvels cannot save Sarah Primm, who is murdered by one of the thugs.\n\n===''The Trials of Shazam!'' and ''Countdown''===\n[[Image:Black Mary in DC Countdown.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Mary Marvel acquires Black Adam's powers in ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown]]'' #47 (June 6, 2007).]]\n\n{{Main|Countdown to Final Crisis}}\nIn the eleven page preview to [[Judd Winick]] and [[Howard Porter (artist)|Howard Porter's]] ''[[Trials of Shazam]]'' limited series appearing in DC's ''Brave New World'' one-shot comic (June 2006), Mary Marvel loses her powers in mid-flight as an after-effect of the death of the wizard Shazam by the Spectre in ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' #6, and falls from a height of three miles (this contradicts her appearances in the ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' series, as she appears in that series using her powers, despite ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' taking place chronologically after ''[[Day of Vengeance]]''). Mary survives the fall but goes into a coma, and Freddy Freeman, who lost the power to become Captain Marvel Jr. in the same way, has her transported to a hospital in New York City where he can keep watch over her. He spends all his money to help her.\n\nIn ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown]]'' #51, Mary is released from the hospital. She finds that she is still powerless and a note left by Freddy Freeman with a nurse asks her not to look for him as he is trying to get the powers of Shazam back, per the orders of Marvel. Making her way to [[Gotham City]] (despite being warned by [[Madame Xanadu]] to avoid the place in ''Countdown'' #50),<ref>''Coundown's'' issue numbering runs backwards; that is, the series begins with #51 and ends at #0.</ref> Mary stumbles upon the former [[Kahndaq]]i embassy while being chased by violent criminals from the subway, who are killed by Black Adam. [[Black Adam]] angrily threatens her. Mary tells Adam how much she valued her powers and how she desires to regain them. Adam, bitter over the loss of his wife Isis and brother-in-law [[Osiris (DC Comics)|Osiris]] during the events of ''52'' as well as his failure to resurrect the former, gives Mary his powers instead of killing her.  He is transformed into the mortal Teth-Adam, whom Mary rescues from a wall toppling on him. Mary wears a black form-fitting costume and wields Adam's powers as a darker, angrier character.<ref>''Countdown'' #41</ref> While searching for a tutor to help her harness her power at the reformed Riddler's advice, she encounters Klarion the Witch boy in a market for dark magic, who tries to take her power, then Zatanna, who banishes her from her home after a fight, and then [[Jean Loring#Countdown|Eclipso]], who only fuels her wild abandon. She uses a rougher justice, such as turning soldiers to stone and shrinking poachers so their quarries chase them.\n\nTheir alliance, however, seems to break down when Eclipso, hoping to please her master [[Darkseid]], offers the young and pretty Mary as his new concubine, reasoning that the two women could always leech Darkseid's arcane knowledge, slay him, and take his place. Mary refuses to sell herself for more power, beats Eclipso with her own crystal, and flees, enraged. Eclipso catches up to her and regains the diamond. Eclipso then departs, leaving Mary alone again. Some time later, Eclipso returns hoping to finish her off, but Mary is too strong for her.\n\nMary experiences a change of mind, and upon realizing that Black Adam's powers are as responsible for her corruption as Eclipso, divests herself of them by feeding the lightning bolt into Eclipso, who tries to kill her and take her power. Both women lose their powers and fall into the ocean. However, an unpowered Mary lands on [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themysciran]] soil, where [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]] drafts her in the rebellion against [[Granny Goodness]], who is posing as the goddess [[Athena (DC Comics)|Athena]].\n\nMary, [[Holly Robinson (comics)|Holly Robinson]], and [[Harley Quinn|Harleen Quinzel]] manage to reveal Goodness' deception, and the trio follow her to [[Apokolips]]. After escaping the [[Female Furies]], Mary starts to hear the voices of the gods. The group manages to free the Olympian gods from an Apokoliptan chamber, and Mary Marvel's powers are restored along with her white costume, which now has a gray lightning bolt and long sleeves.\n\nAfter journeying with the Challengers to Earth-51 and witnessing the Great Disaster occurring there, Mary finally returns home to find Darkseid waiting for her. Reminding her of how strong she felt using Black Adam's powers, and claiming the gods do not trust her as much now, he returns them to her, restoring her black costume. She then confronts [[Donna Troy]], [[Kyle Rayner]], [[Forager (comics)|Forager]], and [[Jimmy Olsen]], seizing Jimmy to take him back to Darkseid. When Donna questions Mary's use of the powers, Mary insists that she is not evil, merely \"driven\".<ref>''Countdown to Final Crisis'' #4</ref> After Darkseid's defeat, Mary returns to Black Adam, asking to be a part of a new Black Marvel Family. Adam refuses her and, after a big tantrum, she decides to become a solo superheroine.\n\n===''Final Crisis''===\n[[Image:Final-crisis-3-interior-mary-marvel-2008.jpg|180px|thumb|right|An evil Mary Marvel, possessed by the [[New Gods|New God]] [[Desaad]], battles [[Wonder Woman]] in interior art detail from ''[[Final Crisis]]'' #3 (of 7), September 2008.

She attacks [[Wonder Woman]], scratching the Amazon's upper arm and infecting her with an unknown virus delivered from a broken glass vial bearing a gold [[Omega]] symbol. Later, when the heroes of Earth attack [[Bl\u00fcdhaven]], Black Adam notes that she's been possessed by one of the New Gods, a \"leering old man\". The possessed Mary claims to have a new dirty magic word, a blasphemous name of power, and to have new gods. During a heated battle with [[Supergirl]], Black Adam learns that the evil god [[Desaad]] was the one who possessed Mary. Black Adam tries to kill her but is stopped by Freddy. Later, distracted by hordes of Anti-Life followers about to attack, Freddy Freeman, the new Captain Marvel, grabs Mary and uses the last of his magic to transform them back to normal. Though horrified by her actions while possessed by Desaad, and saying that she never meant for this to happen while crying, she is seen standing with Freddy with clubs in their hands, awaiting the end of the world.\n\n===''Justice Society of America''===\nAfter the end of the Crisis, Mary is recruited by Black Adam and Isis, who have taken over the Rock of Eternity formerly lorded over by the wizard Shazam by defeating Captain Marvel and stealing his powers, using the magic scarab Shazam used to take Black Adam's powers. During a battle between Black Adam, Isis, and the Justice Society, who had been summoned by Billy, the evil Mary Marvel abducts a powerless Billy Batson and forces him to become a teenage Black Marvel by sharing her powers and forcing him to say \"Mary Marvel\".<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #24 (February 2009)</ref>\n\nThe two now evil Black Marvels join Adam and Isis, who are intent on using the power of Shazam to destroy the modern world, in fighting the Justice Society.

Black Adam gives up his powers to restore the wizard to life. Shazam promptly and angrily takes his powers back from Mary, Billy, and Isis, turns Teth Adam and Isis to stone, and closes off all contact to the Rock of Eternity to the Batson kids upon stating that Billy and Mary failed him. He also threatens to go after Freddy for stealing his name. The two Batsons are later seen wandering the streets of Fawcett City, homeless, and wondering what happened to their father's spirit.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #25 (April 2009)</ref>\n\nMary and Billy are briefly seen during the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]'', now living in an apartment in Fawcett City.

In her petite superpowered state, Mary Marvel originally wore a red short-sleeved blouse and red skirt lined with gold trim, which included a lightning bolt insignia and cape.\n\nThe Fawcett and pre-1985 version of Mary Marvel did not derive her \"Shazam\" powers from the male mythological figures who empower Billy, but from a set of female benefactors: [[Selene|'''S'''elene]] for grace,  [[Hippolyta|'''H'''ippolyta]][[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|*]] for strength, [[Ariadne|'''A'''riadne]] (later changed to [[Artemis]], Greek goddess of the hunt) for skill, [[Anemoi#West wind (Zephyrus)|'''Z'''ephyrus]] for fleetness (and flight), [[Aurora (mythology)|'''A'''urora]] (later changed to Greek goddess [[Aphrodite]]) for beauty and [[Minerva|'''M'''inerva]] for wisdom.\n\nAlthough these [[deity|deities]] were originally described and depicted as goddesses, Zephyrus is actually a male god. In addition, the list does not account for all of the [[superhuman]] traits shared by Billy and Mary, specifically Captain Marvel's powers of invulnerability, stamina, and courage. The original Mary Marvel remained a teenager when she transformed rather than becoming a mature adult like Billy.\n\nA version of Mary Marvel, originating in ''The Power of Shazam!'', has [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)#Powers and abilities|the same powers]] from the same benefactors as her brother ([[Solomon|'''S'''olomon]], [[Hercules|'''H'''ercules]][[Hercules (DC Comics)|*]], [[Atlas (mythology)|'''A'''tlas]], [[Zeus|'''Z'''eus]], [[Achilles|'''A'''chilles]] and [[Mercury (mythology)|'''M'''ercury]]). A power-sharing element was added to the mythos in the ''Power of Shazam!'' series; one finite source of power was shared between Mary, Captain Marvel, and Captain Marvel Jr. This power-sharing element has not been honored by all later appearances of the Marvels. Mary loses these powers in the 2006 ''[[One Year Later|Brave New World]]'' one-shot special. In early stories, if she had lost her memory or been transformed, her transformation would restore her.\n\nIn ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' (2007\u20132008), [[Black Adam]] gives Mary his powers.<ref>''Countdown'' #47</ref> Since Adam was not sharing his powers with anyone else when he granted them to Mary,<ref>''52'', Week #52</ref> and had also been carrying the powers of his dead wife [[Isis (DC Comics)|Isis]]<ref>''Countdown'' #46</ref> (who had granted them to him with her death), Mary is now more powerful than she has ever been. Mary's patron deities become seven Egyptian gods: [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|'''S'''hu]], [[Horus|'''H'''eru]], [[Amun|'''A'''mon]], [[Thoth|'''Z'''ehuti]], [[Aten|'''A'''ten]], [[Mehen|'''M'''ehen]], and the \"most powerful\"<ref>\n{{Comic book reference | title=[[52 (comics)|52]] | issue=12 | date=August 28, 2006 | publisher=[[DC Comics]] | page=15 | panel=1 }}</ref> Egyptian deity, [[Isis]], which increases her other powers and allows her to perform magical feats like weather control and transforming others. Mary's powers continue to expand rapidly as she and her mentor [[Eclipso]] seek new sources of magical power for her, gaining various new magical powers. She became sufficiently powerful to withstand Darkseid's Omega Beams. Eventually realizing she had been corrupted by Eclipso and the powers of Adam's gods, Mary relinquished these abilities. Mary's powers were restored when she aided the Olympian Gods in retaining their freedom from Apokolips. Later, her Black Adam powers were restored, given to her by [[Darkseid]].\n\nIn the later ''[[Final Crisis]]'' miniseries (2008\u20132009), Mary's body was further enhanced with genetic technology stolen by the [[Atomic Knight]]s. In addition to her impressive magical powers, her empowered form is now \"aged\" from late adolescence to adulthood, with clawed hands able to slice through metal. Later Black Adam restores her powers from the Egyptian gods. She is able to bestow part of it upon Billy, making him Black Billy.\n\nPower of Shazam: Formerly, in order to change form, Mary had to call upon the name of Shazam, thereby invoking spells involving the energies of those extradimensional beings once known as gods on Earth. When Mary Batson said the magic word \"Shazam!\", she would be transformed into Mary Marvel. In her Mary Marvel form, Mary possessed the following attributes:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''S'''|| Wisdom of '''S'''olomon|| As Mary Marvel, Mary had instant access to a vast amount of scholarly knowledge, exceptional photographic recall and mental acuity allowing her to read and decipher hieroglyphics, solve long mathematical equations instantaneously and make intuitive guesses based on limited data to the point her guesses were almost always correct. The wisdom of Solomon also gave Mary clairvoyance and provided her with counsel and advice in times of need. She had knowledge of all languages, ancient and modern, and could hypnotize people.\n|-\n|'''H'''|| Strength of '''H'''ercules|| Mary Marvel had incredible amounts of super strength, was strong enough to lift at least 100 tons, and was able to effortlessly bend steel, punch through walls, and lift massive objects. Mary's strength is enough that she has fought beings such as Captain Atom and Supergirl to a standstill. Her strength parallels that of Superman.  \n|-\n|'''A'''|| Stamina of '''A'''tlas|| Using Atlas' endurance and durability, Mary Marvel could withstand and survive most types of extreme physical assaults.  If she were somehow wounded, her godly energies would enable her to recover with superhuman speed and with more finality than mortals. It would take an injury of such magnitude that it dispersed a major portion of her bodily molecules to cause her a physical death. Even then, it might have been possible for a god of significant power, such as Zeus, Poseidon and Apollo, or for a number of Olympian gods of equal power working together, to revive her. Additionally, her Olympian metabolism ensured that she did not need to eat, sleep, or breathe when in Mary Marvel form.\n|-\n|'''Z'''|| Power of '''Z'''eus|| Zeus' power, besides fueling the magic thunderbolt that transformed Mary Marvel, also enhanced Marvel's other physical and mental abilities, provided physical invulnerability and resistance against most magic spells and attacks, and allowed her to access the Rock of Eternity. Marvel could use the lightning bolt as a weapon by dodging it and allowing it to strike an opponent or target. The magical lightning had many other uses, including creating apparati, restoring damage done to Marvel, or acting as fuel for magical spells.\n|-\n|'''A'''|| Courage of '''A'''chilles|| Like the wisdom, this aspect is primarily psychological and gave Marvel superhuman amounts of inner strength from which to draw. She was always supported by an innate and harmonious presence of good will and strength of perseverance so that she never backed down from a challenge.\n|-\n|'''M'''|| Speed of '''M'''ercury|| By channeling Mercury's speed, Mary Marvel, while not as fast as the Flash, could fly and move at hypersonic speeds exceeding Mach 10 (2 miles a second) while in Earth's atmosphere and could fly at close to light speed through space. She could move fast enough to not register in the normal peripheral range of humans and seemingly vanish and disappear at will. At this speed, her mind processed information on par to a computer or at least on a subliminal level that she was aware of her surroundings. She could also mystically fly through the atmosphere through sheer act of will, enabling her to soar through the atmosphere at sub-orbital levels and travel across the planet. She was immune from the effects of extreme height, such as dizziness and lightheadedness. With effort, she could travel from the earth to the moon, but required extra-precautionary paraphernalia for interstellar travel. Hermes Trismegistus (Greek for \"thrice-great Hermes\"), an occultist aspect of Hermes/Mercury, also gave her the ability to wield magic and cast spells, though she never used this as Mary Marvel, apparently because she did not know how.\n|}\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===''52''===\nIn the final issue of ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', a new [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] is revealed consisting of 52 identical realities.  Earth-5 is depicted as home to the Marvel family characters. As a result of [[Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil|Mister Mind]] \"eating\" aspects of this universe, it takes on aspects similar to the pre-''Crisis'' Earth-S. Although the characters are not named in the panel in which they appear, a character looking like Mary Marvel is shown.<ref>\n{{Comic book reference | title=[[52 (comics)|52]] | issue=52 | date=May 2, 2007 | publisher=[[DC Comics]] | page=12 | panel=5 }}</ref> ''52'' co-author [[Grant Morrison]] has made clear that this alternate universe is not the pre-''Crisis'' Earth-S.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=111900 \n |title=The 52 Exit Interviews: Grant Morrison \n |accessdate=2007-05-12 \n |last=Brady \n |first=Matt \n |date=2007-05-08 \n |publisher=Newsarama \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209073525/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=111900 \n |archivedate=December 9, 2009 \n}}</ref>\n\nAn evil version of Mary Marvel exists in an alternate universe as a member of the \"Power Posse\" (evil analogues of the Super Buddies). Mistress Mary, as she is called, wears a black variant of Mary's traditional outfit, almost identical to her costume during the  2007/2008 ''Countdown'' series.<ref>''JLA Classified'' #8, 9</ref>\n\n===''Shazam! The Monster Society of Evil''===\nIn the 2007 limited series ''Shazam! The Monster Society of Evil'', written and illustrated by [[Jeff Smith (cartoonist)|Jeff Smith]], Mary Batson is depicted as a prepubescent child who does not age when she transforms into Mary Marvel.\n\nMary meets her lost brother in the circus that is attacked by Alligator Men and is rescued by Captain Marvel. With the help of Talky Tawny, a trickster spirit who changes into various forms but prefers being a [[tiger]] when convenient, the siblings learn they are related. When Billy transforms into Captain Marvel, Mary stands too close to her brother and is struck by the fringe of the magic lightning; as a result, Mary gains her Marvel form (which is still at her actual age) that is apparently based on the aspects of various goddesses, including superior flying speed to her brother, and powers stemming by a female set of benefactors. For example, Athena's wisdom is different from Solomon's, allowing Mary to perceive \"life vibrations\" and distinguish between living and non-living beings.\n\nAlthough she and Billy are kidnapped in their regular form by [[Doctor Sivana]] and Mr. Mind and gagged, Billy escapes and later rescues her as Captain Marvel when she is thrown from the top of a robot by Doctor Sivana; she in turn rescues him from Sivana after, while defeating Mr. Mind, he accidentally loses his powers. Mary subsequently manages to restore his abilities.\n\n====''Billy Batson and the Magic of Shazam!''====\nMary appears as a main character in this follow-up series. As in ''Monster Society of Evil'', Mary has only a fraction of her brother's powers and remains a child in super form; although faster, she is far less strong. As Mary is very hyper and reckless, Billy is very protective of her, although he is also often annoyed by her antics and snarkiness. During the final battle against Black Adam, she briefly gains an adult form, only to lose it shortly after and reverting to a child.\n\n===Justice League Beyond===\nIn the digital Justice League Beyond comics taking place in the DC Animated Universe's future (based on the Batman Beyond TV series), Mary Marvel, Billy Batson, the wizard Shazam, and Black Adam are somehow sharing the same body. Only one of them can exist in the real world at a time, but can switch places with each other. She appears to be attracted to the Green Lantern of that time period. It is unknown how this occurred.\n\n===Tangent Comics===\nIn the [[Tangent Comics]] print, Mary was one of three superheroines (the others being [[Madame Xanadu]] and [[Lori Lemaris]]) who masqueraded as a heroic version of [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]].\n\n===Bombshells===\nIn the DC alternate-WWII universe of the [[DC Comics Bombshells|Bombshells]], a young Jewish woman named '''Miriam B\u00e4tzel''' relates traditional Jewish folklore to children hiding from the Nazis to keep their spirits up. Under the stress of their imminent deaths, she starts reciting the names of Jewish heroines: \"[[Shiphrah]], [[Huldah]], [[Abigail]], [[Zipporah]], [[Asenath]], [[Miriam]]...\" In the nick of time, by muttering the acronym \"S...H...A...Z...A...M\" she is able to tap into mystical energy and become the extremely powerful Shazam, who the children nickname \"Miri Marvel.\" Rather than engage in destructive super-battles, she uses her power to protect and aid the escape of a large group of refugees. Aiding refugees in escaping the war becomes her primary mission in the series.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Along with the rest of the Marvel Family, Mary Marvel appeared in the 1981 ''Shazam!'' [[Saturday morning cartoon]], aired as one half of ''[[The Kid Super Power Hour with Shazam!]]'' voiced by Dawn Jeffory.\n* Mary Marvel (as Mary Batson) appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode \"The Power of Shazam!\" voiced by [[Tara Strong]]. As with the origin of her appearance, both Mary and Billy are reunited at the end of the episode after Batman did some detective work that found her. They then confirm their relationship as brother and sister through the discovery that they each have possession of half a locket bequeathed to them by their late mother. She returns in \"The Malicious Mr. Mind!\", this time with the ability to transform into Mary Marvel. She and the other members of the [[Marvel Family]], along with [[Batman]], battle [[Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil]].\n* [[Greg Weisman]] (producer of the TV series ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'') has confirmed that Mary Bromfield was a member of the Team in between seasons 1 and 2 and was known as ''Sergeant Marvel''. Mary was supposed to appear both in and out of costume at [[Rocket (comics)|Rocket]]'s bridal shower in the episode \"Satisfaction\" but was cut from the finalized episode. She was also set to appear at the gathering of heroes in \"Endgame,\" but there was not enough time to design her character. She was also set to appear in an issue of the tie-in comic in a story centered on the Marvel Family.<ref>http://www.s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/search.php?qid=17974</ref><ref>http://www.s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/search.php?rid=1048</ref>\n\n===Film===\n* On the forums of [[Comic Book Resources]], writer [[Dwayne McDuffie]] confirmed that the '''[[Superwoman]]''' (voiced by [[Gina Torres]]) portrayed in the film ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]'' is the [[Crime Syndicate of America]]'s combined version of both Mary Marvel and [[Wonder Woman]].<ref>[http://forums.comicbookresources.com/showthread.php?t=308181&page=2 Who wants Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths spoilers? \u2013 Page 2 \u2013 Comic Book Resources Forums]</ref> A second, alternate version of Mary appeared on a computer page of the lesser members of the Syndicate.

After being nearly hit by a truck and saved by Shazam, Mary was showing depression about leaving her foster family behind while Shazam gives her the advice (albeit not in a constructive manner) to do what she needs to do. During Shazam's rescue of a bus, Mary learns that Shazam is Billy Batson as she informs her younger foster brothers Eugene and Pedro. In the climax between Sivana and Shazam, the Wizard's staff is taken by Billy as he shares his powers with his foster siblings. In her superpowered form, Mary helps the foster siblings fight the Seven Deadly Enemies of Man while Shazam fights Doctor Sivana. At the end of the film, she and her foster siblings dine in the school cafeteria with Shazam and Superman.\n\n===Web series===\n* An African-American version of Mary Marvel was set to appear in season 2 of ''[[Justice League: Gods and Monsters Chronicles]]'' before the project was shelved.<ref>http://www.vcpost.com/articles/64841/20150507/justice-league-gods-and-monsters-chronicles-update-mary-marvel-green-lantern-season-2-debut-2016.htm</ref>\n* Mary Marvel appears as cameo non-speaking character in ''[[DC Super Hero Girls]]''.\n\n===Video games===\n* Mary Batson/Mary Marvel appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego DC Super Villains]]''.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n* Although she has not appeared in any other television programs or films, Mary Marvel is featured in issue 20 of the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' comic book, in which she appears in the art style of the ''Justice League Unlimited'' television show.\n* She made a cameo appearance in ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' as a member of the Justice League in Beast Boy's fantasy.\n* Mary Marvel hosted a puzzle page drawn by [[C.

Like her brother, Mary has been granted the power of the wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]], and has but to speak the wizard's name to be transformed into the superpowered Mary Marvel. Mary Marvel was one of the first female [[spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] of a major male superhero, and predates the introduction of [[Superman]]'s female cousin [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] (also created by Otto Binder) by more than a decade.\n\nFollowing DC's licensing of the Marvel Family characters in 1972, Mary Marvel began appearing in DC Comics, co-starring in DC series such as ''Shazam!'' (1973\u20131978) and ''[[The Power of Shazam!]]'' (1995\u20131999). Two limited series from 2007\u20132009, ''[[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown]]'' and ''[[Final Crisis]]'', feature an evil version of Mary Marvel having acquired powers from first Shazam Family archenemy [[Black Adam]] and further from [[Apokolips|Apokoliptian]] supervillain god [[Desaad]]. In current continuity following DC's 2011 [[New 52]] reboot, Mary Bromfield appears as one of Billy Batson's foster siblings, and can share Billy's power by saying \"Shazam\" to become an adult superhero similar to the traditional Mary Marvel (the \"Marvel\" monikers having been retired with the reboot).\n\nMary Bromfield and Lady Shazam both made their cinematic debut in the [[DC Extended Universe]] film [[Shazam!

She also appeared in ''[[Marvel Family|The Marvel Family]]'' book with Captain Marvel and Captain Marvel Jr. In her solo adventures, Mary soon gained sidekicks in her kindly [[Uncle Marvel]], who was not actually her uncle nor a Marvel, and his similarly nonpowered niece, Freckles Marvel. Uncle Marvel was eventually made the Marvel Family\u2019s manager, and also served as Mary\u2019s guardian.\n\nJust before the [[Marvel Family]]'s adventures ceased publication in 1953, Mary Marvel\u2019s costume and appearance were altered: the neckline of her blouse was lowered slightly, her hair was shortened, and she now wore yellow slippers instead of the customary Marvel Family yellow boots. After Fawcett canceled their superhero comics line because of a [[National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications|copyright infringement lawsuit with National Comics (later DC Comics)]], Mary Marvel hosted a puzzle page drawn by [[C. C. Beck]] on page 33 of ''Mysteries of Unexplored World'' issue 1 ([[Charlton Comics]] August 1956). After that, Mary and her teammates went unseen for years.\n\n===DC Comics===\n\n====1973\u20131985====\nIn 1972, DC Comics licensed the rights to the Marvels, and revived them in a new comic series called ''Shazam!''. Mary, Cap, and Junior appeared in both new stories and reprints of their classic stories. According to Shazam #1 the Sivanas had put the Marvel family into suspended animation for 20 years, along with themselves (by mistake) and much of the supporting cast. The comic book was canceled by 1978, and the ''Shazam!'' stories were relegated to the back pages of ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' (from 1979 to 1982) and ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' (from 1982 to 1983). After the 1985 ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' miniseries, Captain Marvel\u2019s origin was rebooted in the ''Shazam: The New Beginning'' miniseries in 1987. The Marvel Family was written out of the ''Shazam!'' mythos, and neither Mary Batson nor Mary Marvel appeared in DC Comics for several years.\n\n====1994\u20131999====\nMary Batson was reintroduced in ''[[The Power of Shazam!]]'' graphic novel by [[Jerry Ordway]] in 1994. An ongoing series followed in the next year, and Mary Marvel was introduced into the modern [[DC Universe]] with a new origin story in ''Power of Shazam!'' #4.\n\nWhen calling upon her powers, Mary is transformed into an adult resembling her late mother (in the same way that Billy resembles his father when in Marvel form). Mary shares the title of Captain Marvel with her brother. Various characters in the series distinguish the two by gender when addressing them, addressing Mary as \"the lady Captain Marvel\".\n\nAt first, Mary\u2019s costume was the same as her original one. However, beginning with ''Power of Shazam!'' #28, Mary donned a white costume to distinguish herself from her brother. The color change was retained for most future uses of the character during the next decade.\n\n====2000s====\nAfter the ''Power of Shazam!'' series ended in 1999, Mary\u2019s superpowered alter ego was officially rechristened \"Mary Marvel.\"  In 2002 she had lunch with Supergirl in \"The Clubhouse of Solitude\", in the spoof graphic anthology \"[[Bizarro]] Comics\". Since then, she has guest-starred in both ''Superman'' and ''Supergirl'' comics. In 2003, Mary became a member of an offshoot of the [[Justice League]] known as the [[Super Buddies]] in the ''[[Super Buddies#Formerly Known as the Justice League|Formerly Known as the Justice League]]'' miniseries, which juxtaposed her [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]]-era personality with the modern-day world for comic effect.\n\nMary Marvel appears briefly in several stories relating to DC's 2005\u20132006 ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' crossover. Mary also appeared in DC's weekly limited series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', with her most substantial appearance being in ''52'' #16 as the [[wedding ceremony participants#Maid of honor|maid of honor]] at the wedding of [[Black Adam]] and [[Isis (DC Comics)|Isis]], two ''Shazam!''-related characters. She was defeated by Black Adam during [[World War III (DC Comics)]] along with the other Marvels.\n\nIn 2006, DC began a revamp of the ''Shazam!'' mythos with [[Judd Winick]] and [[Howard Porter (artist)|Howard Porter's]] ''Trials of Shazam!'' limited series. The series began with a preview within the pages of ''[[One Year Later#New series|Brave New World]]'' #1 in June 2006, in which Mary Batson loses her powers, suffers a three-mile fall, and falls into a coma. This set up Mary's appearances as a main character in ''Countdown'', a weekly DC series which served as the successor to ''52''. During the course of the series, head writer [[Paul Dini]] and his collaborators had Mary acquire the powers of Black Adam, which give her a new look including a form-fitting long-sleeved black uniform and skirt with black lace-up boots. While the series tracked the character's struggle between good and evil, due to manipulation by supervillainesses [[Eclipso]] and [[Granny Goodness]] (promotional material for the series used the catchphrase \"[[Seduction of the Innocent#In popular culture|Seduction of the Innocent]],\" a reference to [[Fredric Wertham]]'s [[Seduction of the Innocent|book of the same title]]),{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Mary emerged from the series under the influence of [[Superman]] villain [[Darkseid]].\n\nThis darker Mary Marvel appears in DC's 2008 crossover series ''[[Final Crisis]]'', written by [[Grant Morrison]] and illustrated by [[J. G. Jones]], as a [[Female Furies|Female Fury]], with another design change (to match the styles of the other Furies) and a fully evil personality due to possession by the [[New Gods|New God]] [[Desaad]].<ref>''Final Crisis'' #5</ref> Though defeated by [[Captain Marvel Jr.|Freddy Freeman/Shazam]] before the end of the ''Final Crisis'' miniseries, the evil Mary appeared again in the \"Black Adam and Isis\" arc featured in ''[[Justice Society of America]]'' (vol. 3) #23\u201325, by the end of which she has lost her powers and returned to being a normal teenage girl.\n\n====2010s====\nIn 2011, following its ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' company-wide event, DC  made sweeping continuity changes to some comic book series and minor ones to others, as part of its relaunch event \"[[The New 52]]\". Captain Marvel, now known as Shazam, received a new origin story as part of a ''Shazam!'' backup feature by writer [[Geoff Johns]] and penciler [[Gary Frank]], published between 2012 and 2013 in the relaunched ''[[Justice League]]'' comic series.<ref name=\"JL23Review\"/> Mary does not feature in the new continuity until ''Justice League'' #8 (2012), and is not transformed into a superhero for the first time until ''Justice League'' #21 (2013), when Billy directs his powers into her, Freddy, and their foster siblings Darla, Pedro, and Eugene during a fray with Black Adam.<ref name=\"JL23Review\">{{Cite web |url=https://batman-news.com/2013/06/26/new-52-justice-league-21-review/ |title=New 52 \u2013 Justice League #21 review |last=Andrew Asberry |date=2013-06-26 |website=Batman News |language=en-US |access-date=2018-12-08}}</ref>\n\nMary was largely absent from the main DC Universe for several years after ''Justice League'' #22 in 2013.

Art by [[Kurt Schaffenberger]].]]\n\n===Original Fawcett origin===\nMary Marvel's [[first appearance]] in ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #18 also relayed her origin story.\n\nAs infants, twins Billy and Mary Batson were nursed by a woman named Sarah Primm. When the Batsons' parents die in a car accident, Primm was required to send both children to an orphanage. However, Primm is determined to at least give one of the children a home, and arranges for Mary to secretly take the place of another baby girl who had suddenly died while under Primm's care. As a result, Billy is sent to an orphanage while his sister is raised by the wealthy Mrs. Bromfield.\n\nSeveral years later, Billy Batson becomes a teenage radio announcer. While hosting an on-air [[quizbowl]], he receives an urgent letter from Sarah Primm, now on her death bed, requesting his presence. Billy goes to see her during a break, and Primm tells him the secret of his long-lost sister. To help him find Mary, Primm gives Billy a locket broken in half and tells the boy with her last breaths that Mary wears the other half.\n\nAfter the quizbowl broadcast is over, Billy tells his best friend Freddy Freeman about his sister and the locket. Billy then recalls that one of the quizbowl contestants, a rich girl named Mary Bromfield, wore a broken locket. He and Freddy trail Mary\u2019s limousine in their superpowered forms of [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and [[Captain Marvel Jr.]] and find themselves called into service to save Mary from a gang of kidnappers.\n\nCaptain Marvel then learns that Mary's locket matches his own, and that she is indeed Billy\u2019s sister. The Marvels reveal their secret identities to Mary, who wonders if, since she is Billy\u2019s twin, she could become a Marvel by saying the magic word \"Shazam\". Billy, however, is assured that \"Old Shaz\u2014er\u2014you know who\u2014wouldn\u2019t give his powers to a girl!\"\n\nJust then, the kidnappers awaken then bind and gag Billy and Freddy, preventing them from saying their magic words. Mary exclaims that Billy cannot say \"Shazam\", inadvertently saying the word herself. She is then struck by a magic [[lightning]] bolt and transformed into a super-powered version of herself, later christened \"Mary Marvel\" by her brother. She defeats the thugs by herself, discovering that she is bulletproof and has super strength, and frees Billy and Freddy. [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]] later reveals [[#Powers and abilities|the goddesses Mary derives her powers from]].\n\n===Modified DC origin===\n[[Image:Fkajl-mary-1.jpg|175px|thumb|Mary Marvel in her white uniform in ''[[Super Buddies#Formerly Known as the Justice League|Formerly Known as the Justice League]]'' #1 (2003). Art by [[Kevin Maguire (artist)|Kevin Maguire]] and [[Josef Rubinstein]].]]\nMary Marvel's updated DC origin was presented in the ''Power of Shazam!'' graphic novel and ongoing series, written by Jerry Ordway.\n\nProminent archaeologists C.C. and Marilyn Batson are assigned by the [[Doctor Sivana|Sivana]] expedition on an excursion to Egypt. They take along their young daughter Mary, but are forced to leave their son Billy in America with C.C.'s half-brother. The elder Batsons are killed by their associate [[Black Adam|Theo Adam]], who then kidnaps Mary. Upon Theo Adam's return to the United States, Adam\u2019s sister, a maid named Sarah Primm, takes Mary into her care. Primm arranges for her childless employers, Nick and Nora Bromfield, to illegally adopt Mary. As Mary Bromfield, the young girl grows up living an idyllic life in a wealthy family, but continuously has dreams of another family with a brother she has never seen.\n\nMeanwhile, Billy eventually finding himself on the streets, and is given the power to become Captain Marvel. He learns that Mary is still alive, but after four years of searching, neither he nor his benefactor, the wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]], can find the girl. The only thing Billy has to remember Mary by is her favorite toy, a \"Tawky Tawny\" doll, which was shipped to America with the Batsons\u2019 possessions after their murders.\n\nAs a young teenager, Mary enters a regional [[spelling bee]] held in [[Fawcett City]] and emceed by Billy, who works as an on-air reporter for WHIZ radio. After saving Mary from kidnappers twice as Captain Marvel, Billy notices how much Mary Bromfield reminds him of Mary Batson and has an undercover cop named \"Muscles\" McGinnis retrieve the girl\u2019s forged adoption record. Learning that Mary is indeed his sister, Billy tries to figure out a way to let Mary know he is her brother. The old \"[[Marvel Family#Marvel Family allies|Tawky Tawny]]\" doll suddenly transforms into a full-sized humanoid tiger and comes to life, instructing Billy to take it to Mary. As Captain Marvel, Billy flies out to the Bromfields\u2019 hometown of Fairfield to deliver the doll and the adoption papers to Mary.\n\nCaptain Marvel arrives at the Bromfield estate and changes back to Billy Batson to deliver the package, but is immediately kidnapped by the thugs who helped Primm forge Mary\u2019s adoption records. Mary, not having seen Billy, takes the package and opens it, discovering the adoption records and the Tawky Tawny doll. Once again, the doll comes to life and instructs the bewildered girl to say the magic word \"Shazam\" and save her brother. Mary complies and is transformed by a bolt of magic lightning into a superpowered doppelganger of her deceased mother. She saves Billy, who transforms into Captain Marvel to help Mary defeat the thugs, but the two Marvels cannot save Sarah Primm, who is murdered by one of the thugs.\n\n===''The Trials of Shazam!'' and ''Countdown''===\n[[Image:Black Mary in DC Countdown.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Mary Marvel acquires Black Adam's powers in ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown]]'' #47 (June 6, 2007).]]\n\n{{Main|Countdown to Final Crisis}}\nIn the eleven page preview to [[Judd Winick]] and [[Howard Porter (artist)|Howard Porter's]] ''[[Trials of Shazam]]'' limited series appearing in DC's ''Brave New World'' one-shot comic (June 2006), Mary Marvel loses her powers in mid-flight as an after-effect of the death of the wizard Shazam by the Spectre in ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' #6, and falls from a height of three miles (this contradicts her appearances in the ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' series, as she appears in that series using her powers, despite ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' taking place chronologically after ''[[Day of Vengeance]]''). Mary survives the fall but goes into a coma, and Freddy Freeman, who lost the power to become Captain Marvel Jr. in the same way, has her transported to a hospital in New York City where he can keep watch over her. He spends all his money to help her.\n\nIn ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown]]'' #51, Mary is released from the hospital. She finds that she is still powerless and a note left by Freddy Freeman with a nurse asks her not to look for him as he is trying to get the powers of Shazam back, per the orders of Marvel. Making her way to [[Gotham City]] (despite being warned by [[Madame Xanadu]] to avoid the place in ''Countdown'' #50),<ref>''Coundown's'' issue numbering runs backwards; that is, the series begins with #51 and ends at #0.</ref> Mary stumbles upon the former [[Kahndaq]]i embassy while being chased by violent criminals from the subway, who are killed by Black Adam. [[Black Adam]] angrily threatens her. Mary tells Adam how much she valued her powers and how she desires to regain them. Adam, bitter over the loss of his wife Isis and brother-in-law [[Osiris (DC Comics)|Osiris]] during the events of ''52'' as well as his failure to resurrect the former, gives Mary his powers instead of killing her.  He is transformed into the mortal Teth-Adam, whom Mary rescues from a wall toppling on him. Mary wears a black form-fitting costume and wields Adam's powers as a darker, angrier character.<ref>''Countdown'' #41</ref> While searching for a tutor to help her harness her power at the reformed Riddler's advice, she encounters Klarion the Witch boy in a market for dark magic, who tries to take her power, then Zatanna, who banishes her from her home after a fight, and then [[Jean Loring#Countdown|Eclipso]], who only fuels her wild abandon. She uses a rougher justice, such as turning soldiers to stone and shrinking poachers so their quarries chase them.\n\nTheir alliance, however, seems to break down when Eclipso, hoping to please her master [[Darkseid]], offers the young and pretty Mary as his new concubine, reasoning that the two women could always leech Darkseid's arcane knowledge, slay him, and take his place. Mary refuses to sell herself for more power, beats Eclipso with her own crystal, and flees, enraged. Eclipso catches up to her and regains the diamond. Eclipso then departs, leaving Mary alone again. Some time later, Eclipso returns hoping to finish her off, but Mary is too strong for her.\n\nMary experiences a change of mind, and upon realizing that Black Adam's powers are as responsible for her corruption as Eclipso, divests herself of them by feeding the lightning bolt into Eclipso, who tries to kill her and take her power. Both women lose their powers and fall into the ocean. However, an unpowered Mary lands on [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themysciran]] soil, where [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]] drafts her in the rebellion against [[Granny Goodness]], who is posing as the goddess [[Athena (DC Comics)|Athena]].\n\nMary, [[Holly Robinson (comics)|Holly Robinson]], and [[Harley Quinn|Harleen Quinzel]] manage to reveal Goodness' deception, and the trio follow her to [[Apokolips]]. After escaping the [[Female Furies]], Mary starts to hear the voices of the gods. The group manages to free the Olympian gods from an Apokoliptan chamber, and Mary Marvel's powers are restored along with her white costume, which now has a gray lightning bolt and long sleeves.\n\nAfter journeying with the Challengers to Earth-51 and witnessing the Great Disaster occurring there, Mary finally returns home to find Darkseid waiting for her. Reminding her of how strong she felt using Black Adam's powers, and claiming the gods do not trust her as much now, he returns them to her, restoring her black costume. She then confronts [[Donna Troy]], [[Kyle Rayner]], [[Forager (comics)|Forager]], and [[Jimmy Olsen]], seizing Jimmy to take him back to Darkseid. When Donna questions Mary's use of the powers, Mary insists that she is not evil, merely \"driven\".<ref>''Countdown to Final Crisis'' #4</ref> After Darkseid's defeat, Mary returns to Black Adam, asking to be a part of a new Black Marvel Family. Adam refuses her and, after a big tantrum, she decides to become a solo superheroine.\n\n===''Final Crisis''===\n[[Image:Final-crisis-3-interior-mary-marvel-2008.jpg|180px|thumb|right|An evil Mary Marvel, possessed by the [[New Gods|New God]] [[Desaad]], battles [[Wonder Woman]] in interior art detail from ''[[Final Crisis]]'' #3 (of 7), September 2008.

She attacks [[Wonder Woman]], scratching the Amazon's upper arm and infecting her with an unknown virus delivered from a broken glass vial bearing a gold [[Omega]] symbol. Later, when the heroes of Earth attack [[Bl\u00fcdhaven]], Black Adam notes that she's been possessed by one of the New Gods, a \"leering old man\". The possessed Mary claims to have a new dirty magic word, a blasphemous name of power, and to have new gods. During a heated battle with [[Supergirl]], Black Adam learns that the evil god [[Desaad]] was the one who possessed Mary. Black Adam tries to kill her but is stopped by Freddy. Later, distracted by hordes of Anti-Life followers about to attack, Freddy Freeman, the new Captain Marvel, grabs Mary and uses the last of his magic to transform them back to normal. Though horrified by her actions while possessed by Desaad, and saying that she never meant for this to happen while crying, she is seen standing with Freddy with clubs in their hands, awaiting the end of the world.\n\n===''Justice Society of America''===\nAfter the end of the Crisis, Mary is recruited by Black Adam and Isis, who have taken over the Rock of Eternity formerly lorded over by the wizard Shazam by defeating Captain Marvel and stealing his powers, using the magic scarab Shazam used to take Black Adam's powers. During a battle between Black Adam, Isis, and the Justice Society, who had been summoned by Billy, the evil Mary Marvel abducts a powerless Billy Batson and forces him to become a teenage Black Marvel by sharing her powers and forcing him to say \"Mary Marvel\".<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #24 (February 2009)</ref>\n\nThe two now evil Black Marvels join Adam and Isis, who are intent on using the power of Shazam to destroy the modern world, in fighting the Justice Society. When Isis begins attacking the citizens of Adam's native Khandaq and Adam's friend [[Albert Rothstein|Atom Smasher]], he switches loyalties and joins the Justice Society's [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Flash]] and the spirit of Mary and Billy's father in helping resurrect the wizard Shazam from the Rock of Finality, where he has been sealed in stone. Black Adam gives up his powers to restore the wizard to life. Shazam promptly and angrily takes his powers back from Mary, Billy, and Isis, turns Teth Adam and Isis to stone, and closes off all contact to the Rock of Eternity to the Batson kids upon stating that Billy and Mary failed him. He also threatens to go after Freddy for stealing his name. The two Batsons are later seen wandering the streets of Fawcett City, homeless, and wondering what happened to their father's spirit.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #25 (April 2009)</ref>\n\nMary and Billy are briefly seen during the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]'', now living in an apartment in Fawcett City. While watching news reports of the various heroes and villains being reanimated as [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lanterns]] on their laptop, Mary remarks how scary it is to not have her powers anymore.<ref>''The Power of Shazam!'' #48 (January 2010)</ref>\n\nMary is approached by [[Blaze and Satanus|Blaze]], who offers to restore her and Billy's powers in exchange for her killing Freddy. Mary seems to go along with the deal, appearing to poison Freddy. However, when Blaze arrives to claim Freddy's powers, he gets up and attacks her. With a little help from Mary and Billy, Freddy defeats Blaze and sends her back to hell, later promising them that he will find a way to restore their lost powers.<ref>''Shazam!'' #1 (January 2011)</ref>\n\n===The New 52/DC Rebirth===\n[[Image:Shazam Family 2013 Gary Frank.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Black Adam]] confronts the newly created [[Marvel Family|Shazam Family]], including Mary Bromfield (second from right), as seen in ''[[Justice League]]'' (vol. 2) #21 (August 2013). Art by [[Gary Frank]].]]\nThe DC Universe was rebooted in 2011 with the [[New 52]] line of comics. In the current continuity, Mary appears as '''Mary Bromfield''', making her debut in ''Justice League'' (vol. 2) #8 in 2012. She is the oldest kid living in the V\u00e1zquezes' foster home, along with Billy Batson, Freddy Freeman, Eugene Choi, Darla Dudley, and Pedro Pe\u00f1a.<ref>''Justice League'' (vol. 2) #8 (April 2012)</ref>\n\nMary was the second child placed with the V\u00e1zquezes, having run away from an abusive home at a young age.<ref name=\"Shazamvol3No1\">''Shazam!''

In her petite superpowered state, Mary Marvel originally wore a red short-sleeved blouse and red skirt lined with gold trim, which included a lightning bolt insignia and cape.\n\nThe Fawcett and pre-1985 version of Mary Marvel did not derive her \"Shazam\" powers from the male mythological figures who empower Billy, but from a set of female benefactors: [[Selene|'''S'''elene]] for grace,  [[Hippolyta|'''H'''ippolyta]][[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|*]] for strength, [[Ariadne|'''A'''riadne]] (later changed to [[Artemis]], Greek goddess of the hunt) for skill, [[Anemoi#West wind (Zephyrus)|'''Z'''ephyrus]] for fleetness (and flight), [[Aurora (mythology)|'''A'''urora]] (later changed to Greek goddess [[Aphrodite]]) for beauty and [[Minerva|'''M'''inerva]] for wisdom.\n\nAlthough these [[deity|deities]] were originally described and depicted as goddesses, Zephyrus is actually a male god. In addition, the list does not account for all of the [[superhuman]] traits shared by Billy and Mary, specifically Captain Marvel's powers of invulnerability, stamina, and courage. The original Mary Marvel remained a teenager when she transformed rather than becoming a mature adult like Billy.\n\nA version of Mary Marvel, originating in ''The Power of Shazam!'', has [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)#Powers and abilities|the same powers]] from the same benefactors as her brother ([[Solomon|'''S'''olomon]], [[Hercules|'''H'''ercules]][[Hercules (DC Comics)|*]], [[Atlas (mythology)|'''A'''tlas]], [[Zeus|'''Z'''eus]], [[Achilles|'''A'''chilles]] and [[Mercury (mythology)|'''M'''ercury]]). A power-sharing element was added to the mythos in the ''Power of Shazam!'' series; one finite source of power was shared between Mary, Captain Marvel, and Captain Marvel Jr. This power-sharing element has not been honored by all later appearances of the Marvels. Mary loses these powers in the 2006 ''[[One Year Later|Brave New World]]'' one-shot special. In early stories, if she had lost her memory or been transformed, her transformation would restore her.\n\nIn ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' (2007\u20132008), [[Black Adam]] gives Mary his powers.<ref>''Countdown'' #47</ref> Since Adam was not sharing his powers with anyone else when he granted them to Mary,<ref>''52'', Week #52</ref> and had also been carrying the powers of his dead wife [[Isis (DC Comics)|Isis]]<ref>''Countdown'' #46</ref> (who had granted them to him with her death), Mary is now more powerful than she has ever been. Mary's patron deities become seven Egyptian gods: [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|'''S'''hu]], [[Horus|'''H'''eru]], [[Amun|'''A'''mon]], [[Thoth|'''Z'''ehuti]], [[Aten|'''A'''ten]], [[Mehen|'''M'''ehen]], and the \"most powerful\"<ref>\n{{Comic book reference | title=[[52 (comics)|52]] | issue=12 | date=August 28, 2006 | publisher=[[DC Comics]] | page=15 | panel=1 }}</ref> Egyptian deity, [[Isis]], which increases her other powers and allows her to perform magical feats like weather control and transforming others. Mary's powers continue to expand rapidly as she and her mentor [[Eclipso]] seek new sources of magical power for her, gaining various new magical powers. She became sufficiently powerful to withstand Darkseid's Omega Beams. Eventually realizing she had been corrupted by Eclipso and the powers of Adam's gods, Mary relinquished these abilities. Mary's powers were restored when she aided the Olympian Gods in retaining their freedom from Apokolips. Later, her Black Adam powers were restored, given to her by [[Darkseid]].\n\nIn the later ''[[Final Crisis]]'' miniseries (2008\u20132009), Mary's body was further enhanced with genetic technology stolen by the [[Atomic Knight]]s. In addition to her impressive magical powers, her empowered form is now \"aged\" from late adolescence to adulthood, with clawed hands able to slice through metal. Later Black Adam restores her powers from the Egyptian gods. She is able to bestow part of it upon Billy, making him Black Billy.\n\nPower of Shazam: Formerly, in order to change form, Mary had to call upon the name of Shazam, thereby invoking spells involving the energies of those extradimensional beings once known as gods on Earth. When Mary Batson said the magic word \"Shazam!\", she would be transformed into Mary Marvel. In her Mary Marvel form, Mary possessed the following attributes:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''S'''|| Wisdom of '''S'''olomon|| As Mary Marvel, Mary had instant access to a vast amount of scholarly knowledge, exceptional photographic recall and mental acuity allowing her to read and decipher hieroglyphics, solve long mathematical equations instantaneously and make intuitive guesses based on limited data to the point her guesses were almost always correct. The wisdom of Solomon also gave Mary clairvoyance and provided her with counsel and advice in times of need. She had knowledge of all languages, ancient and modern, and could hypnotize people.\n|-\n|'''H'''|| Strength of '''H'''ercules|| Mary Marvel had incredible amounts of super strength, was strong enough to lift at least 100 tons, and was able to effortlessly bend steel, punch through walls, and lift massive objects. Mary's strength is enough that she has fought beings such as Captain Atom and Supergirl to a standstill. Her strength parallels that of Superman.  \n|-\n|'''A'''|| Stamina of '''A'''tlas|| Using Atlas' endurance and durability, Mary Marvel could withstand and survive most types of extreme physical assaults.  If she were somehow wounded, her godly energies would enable her to recover with superhuman speed and with more finality than mortals. It would take an injury of such magnitude that it dispersed a major portion of her bodily molecules to cause her a physical death. Even then, it might have been possible for a god of significant power, such as Zeus, Poseidon and Apollo, or for a number of Olympian gods of equal power working together, to revive her. Additionally, her Olympian metabolism ensured that she did not need to eat, sleep, or breathe when in Mary Marvel form.\n|-\n|'''Z'''|| Power of '''Z'''eus|| Zeus' power, besides fueling the magic thunderbolt that transformed Mary Marvel, also enhanced Marvel's other physical and mental abilities, provided physical invulnerability and resistance against most magic spells and attacks, and allowed her to access the Rock of Eternity. Marvel could use the lightning bolt as a weapon by dodging it and allowing it to strike an opponent or target. The magical lightning had many other uses, including creating apparati, restoring damage done to Marvel, or acting as fuel for magical spells.\n|-\n|'''A'''|| Courage of '''A'''chilles|| Like the wisdom, this aspect is primarily psychological and gave Marvel superhuman amounts of inner strength from which to draw. She was always supported by an innate and harmonious presence of good will and strength of perseverance so that she never backed down from a challenge.\n|-\n|'''M'''|| Speed of '''M'''ercury|| By channeling Mercury's speed, Mary Marvel, while not as fast as the Flash, could fly and move at hypersonic speeds exceeding Mach 10 (2 miles a second) while in Earth's atmosphere and could fly at close to light speed through space. She could move fast enough to not register in the normal peripheral range of humans and seemingly vanish and disappear at will. At this speed, her mind processed information on par to a computer or at least on a subliminal level that she was aware of her surroundings. She could also mystically fly through the atmosphere through sheer act of will, enabling her to soar through the atmosphere at sub-orbital levels and travel across the planet. She was immune from the effects of extreme height, such as dizziness and lightheadedness. With effort, she could travel from the earth to the moon, but required extra-precautionary paraphernalia for interstellar travel. Hermes Trismegistus (Greek for \"thrice-great Hermes\"), an occultist aspect of Hermes/Mercury, also gave her the ability to wield magic and cast spells, though she never used this as Mary Marvel, apparently because she did not know how.\n|}\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===''52''===\nIn the final issue of ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', a new [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] is revealed consisting of 52 identical realities.  Earth-5 is depicted as home to the Marvel family characters. As a result of [[Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil|Mister Mind]] \"eating\" aspects of this universe, it takes on aspects similar to the pre-''Crisis'' Earth-S. Although the characters are not named in the panel in which they appear, a character looking like Mary Marvel is shown.<ref>\n{{Comic book reference | title=[[52 (comics)|52]] | issue=52 | date=May 2, 2007 | publisher=[[DC Comics]] | page=12 | panel=5 }}</ref> ''52'' co-author [[Grant Morrison]] has made clear that this alternate universe is not the pre-''Crisis'' Earth-S.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=111900 \n |title=The 52 Exit Interviews: Grant Morrison \n |accessdate=2007-05-12 \n |last=Brady \n |first=Matt \n |date=2007-05-08 \n |publisher=Newsarama \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209073525/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=111900 \n |archivedate=December 9, 2009 \n}}</ref>\n\nAn evil version of Mary Marvel exists in an alternate universe as a member of the \"Power Posse\" (evil analogues of the Super Buddies). Mistress Mary, as she is called, wears a black variant of Mary's traditional outfit, almost identical to her costume during the  2007/2008 ''Countdown'' series.<ref>''JLA Classified'' #8, 9</ref>\n\n===''Shazam! The Monster Society of Evil''===\nIn the 2007 limited series ''Shazam! The Monster Society of Evil'', written and illustrated by [[Jeff Smith (cartoonist)|Jeff Smith]], Mary Batson is depicted as a prepubescent child who does not age when she transforms into Mary Marvel.\n\nMary meets her lost brother in the circus that is attacked by Alligator Men and is rescued by Captain Marvel. With the help of Talky Tawny, a trickster spirit who changes into various forms but prefers being a [[tiger]] when convenient, the siblings learn they are related. When Billy transforms into Captain Marvel, Mary stands too close to her brother and is struck by the fringe of the magic lightning; as a result, Mary gains her Marvel form (which is still at her actual age) that is apparently based on the aspects of various goddesses, including superior flying speed to her brother, and powers stemming by a female set of benefactors. For example, Athena's wisdom is different from Solomon's, allowing Mary to perceive \"life vibrations\" and distinguish between living and non-living beings.\n\nAlthough she and Billy are kidnapped in their regular form by [[Doctor Sivana]] and Mr. Mind and gagged, Billy escapes and later rescues her as Captain Marvel when she is thrown from the top of a robot by Doctor Sivana; she in turn rescues him from Sivana after, while defeating Mr. Mind, he accidentally loses his powers. Mary subsequently manages to restore his abilities.\n\n====''Billy Batson and the Magic of Shazam!''====\nMary appears as a main character in this follow-up series. As in ''Monster Society of Evil'', Mary has only a fraction of her brother's powers and remains a child in super form; although faster, she is far less strong. As Mary is very hyper and reckless, Billy is very protective of her, although he is also often annoyed by her antics and snarkiness. During the final battle against Black Adam, she briefly gains an adult form, only to lose it shortly after and reverting to a child.\n\n===Justice League Beyond===\nIn the digital Justice League Beyond comics taking place in the DC Animated Universe's future (based on the Batman Beyond TV series), Mary Marvel, Billy Batson, the wizard Shazam, and Black Adam are somehow sharing the same body. Only one of them can exist in the real world at a time, but can switch places with each other. She appears to be attracted to the Green Lantern of that time period. It is unknown how this occurred.\n\n===Tangent Comics===\nIn the [[Tangent Comics]] print, Mary was one of three superheroines (the others being [[Madame Xanadu]] and [[Lori Lemaris]]) who masqueraded as a heroic version of [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]].\n\n===Bombshells===\nIn the DC alternate-WWII universe of the [[DC Comics Bombshells|Bombshells]], a young Jewish woman named '''Miriam B\u00e4tzel''' relates traditional Jewish folklore to children hiding from the Nazis to keep their spirits up. Under the stress of their imminent deaths, she starts reciting the names of Jewish heroines: \"[[Shiphrah]], [[Huldah]], [[Abigail]], [[Zipporah]], [[Asenath]], [[Miriam]]...\" In the nick of time, by muttering the acronym \"S...H...A...Z...A...M\" she is able to tap into mystical energy and become the extremely powerful Shazam, who the children nickname \"Miri Marvel.\" Rather than engage in destructive super-battles, she uses her power to protect and aid the escape of a large group of refugees. Aiding refugees in escaping the war becomes her primary mission in the series.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Along with the rest of the Marvel Family, Mary Marvel appeared in the 1981 ''Shazam!'' [[Saturday morning cartoon]], aired as one half of ''[[The Kid Super Power Hour with Shazam!]]'' voiced by Dawn Jeffory.\n* Mary Marvel (as Mary Batson) appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode \"The Power of Shazam!\" voiced by [[Tara Strong]]. As with the origin of her appearance, both Mary and Billy are reunited at the end of the episode after Batman did some detective work that found her. They then confirm their relationship as brother and sister through the discovery that they each have possession of half a locket bequeathed to them by their late mother. She returns in \"The Malicious Mr. Mind!\", this time with the ability to transform into Mary Marvel. She and the other members of the [[Marvel Family]], along with [[Batman]], battle [[Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil]].\n* [[Greg Weisman]] (producer of the TV series ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'') has confirmed that Mary Bromfield was a member of the Team in between seasons 1 and 2 and was known as ''Sergeant Marvel''. Mary was supposed to appear both in and out of costume at [[Rocket (comics)|Rocket]]'s bridal shower in the episode \"Satisfaction\" but was cut from the finalized episode. She was also set to appear at the gathering of heroes in \"Endgame,\" but there was not enough time to design her character. She was also set to appear in an issue of the tie-in comic in a story centered on the Marvel Family.<ref>http://www.s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/search.php?qid=17974</ref><ref>http://www.s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/search.php?rid=1048</ref>\n\n===Film===\n* On the forums of [[Comic Book Resources]], writer [[Dwayne McDuffie]] confirmed that the '''[[Superwoman]]''' (voiced by [[Gina Torres]]) portrayed in the film ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]'' is the [[Crime Syndicate of America]]'s combined version of both Mary Marvel and [[Wonder Woman]].<ref>[http://forums.comicbookresources.com/showthread.php?t=308181&page=2 Who wants Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths spoilers? \u2013 Page 2 \u2013 Comic Book Resources Forums]</ref> A second, alternate version of Mary appeared on a computer page of the lesser members of the Syndicate. While initially unnamed in the movie, designer [[Jerome K. Moore]] identified her as '''Mary Mayhem'''.<ref>[http://jerome-k-moore.deviantart.com/art/EARTH-2-CRIME-SYNDICATE-198393893 EARTH 2 CRIME SYNDICATE by *Jerome-K-Moore on deviantART]</ref>\n* Mary Batson appears along with the rest of the Shazam Kids in ''[[Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox]]''.\n* Mary Bromfield appears in the [[DC Extended Universe]] film ''[[Shazam! (film)|Shazam!]]'', played by [[Grace Fulton]] as a teen and [[Michelle Borth]] as an adult.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kroll|first=Justin|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/grace-fulton-shazam-annabelle-creation-1202605521/amp/|title=''Annabelle Creation'' Actress Grace Fulton Joins ''Shazam''|date=November 2, 2017|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=November 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107011710/http://variety.com/2017/film/news/grace-fulton-shazam-annabelle-creation-1202605521/amp/|archive-date=November 7, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> While she is the oldest of the foster children, Mary has been working on plans to enroll in college. After being nearly hit by a truck and saved by Shazam, Mary was showing depression about leaving her foster family behind while Shazam gives her the advice (albeit not in a constructive manner) to do what she needs to do. During Shazam's rescue of a bus, Mary learns that Shazam is Billy Batson as she informs her younger foster brothers Eugene and Pedro. In the climax between Sivana and Shazam, the Wizard's staff is taken by Billy as he shares his powers with his foster siblings. In her superpowered form, Mary helps the foster siblings fight the Seven Deadly Enemies of Man while Shazam fights Doctor Sivana. At the end of the film, she and her foster siblings dine in the school cafeteria with Shazam and Superman.\n\n===Web series===\n* An African-American version of Mary Marvel was set to appear in season 2 of ''[[Justice League: Gods and Monsters Chronicles]]'' before the project was shelved.<ref>http://www.vcpost.com/articles/64841/20150507/justice-league-gods-and-monsters-chronicles-update-mary-marvel-green-lantern-season-2-debut-2016.htm</ref>\n* Mary Marvel appears as cameo non-speaking character in ''[[DC Super Hero Girls]]''.\n\n===Video games===\n* Mary Batson/Mary Marvel appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego DC Super Villains]]''.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n* Although she has not appeared in any other television programs or films, Mary Marvel is featured in issue 20 of the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' comic book, in which she appears in the art style of the ''Justice League Unlimited'' television show.\n* She made a cameo appearance in ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' as a member of the Justice League in Beast Boy's fantasy.\n* Mary Marvel hosted a puzzle page drawn by [[C. C. Beck]] on page 33 of ''Mysteries of Unexplored World'' issue 1 ([[Charlton Comics]] August 1956)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110128141352/http://marvelfamily.com/whoswho/whoswho.aspx?castID=4 Mary Marvel's \"Who's Who\" file] at The Marvel Family Web.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071211053827/http://www.comicvine.com/mary-marvel/2356/ Comprehensive Mary Marvel biography], an in-universe character history at Comicvine.com\n* [http://www.toonopedia.com/marymarv.htm Mary Marvel] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

Created by [[Gardner Fox]] and [[Dennis Neville]], the character first appeared in ''[[Flash Comics]]'' #1 (January 1940). There are two separate origins for Carter Hall: the Golden Age origin and the Post-Hawkworld (or current) origin.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Golden Age origin===\nIn the days of [[ancient Egypt]], Prince Khufu is engaged in a feud with his rival, the [[Egypt]]ian [[priest]] [[Hath-Set]]. The priest eventually captures both Khufu and his consort Chay-Ara, and kills them. Millennia later, in 1940, Khufu is reincarnated as [[United States|American]] [[archaeology|archaeologist]] '''Carter Hall''', and Chay-Ara as [[Hawkgirl#Golden Age|Shiera Sanders]]. Hath-Set himself is reincarnated as a scientist named Anton Hastor. Upon finding the ancient knife Hath-Set used to kill him, Hall regains his memories of his past life and recognizes Hastor as the reincarnated evil priest.\n\nUsing the properties of \"Nth metal\" to craft a gravity-defying belt, Hall creates wings and a costume, ultimately confronting Hastor as Hawkman after Anton captured Shiera with a spell that drew her to his lair. He also encounters and remembers Shiera during this time. Following Hastor's defeat, the two begin a romance.\n\nHawkman becomes a charter member of the [[Justice Society of America]], and takes the position of permanent chairman, following the [[Jay Garrick|Flash]] and [[Alan Scott|Green Lantern]]. Shiera, meanwhile, adopts the identity of [[Hawkgirl#Golden Age|Hawkgirl]] and fights beside Hall throughout the 1940s. In 1942, Carter enlists in the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Force]] as an Airman<ref>''All-Star Squadron'' #16 (Dec. 1982)</ref> and serves as a pilot with the [[I Fighter Command|1st Interceptor Command]] during [[World War II]].<ref>''All-Star Comics'' #11 (June\u2013July 1942)</ref>\n\nHawkman is JSA chairman in 1951 when the team is investigated by the \"Joint Congressional Un-American Activities Committee\" (based on the real-life [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]) for possible [[communist]] sympathies. Congress asks members of the JSA to reveal their [[secret identity|identities]]. The heroes decline, and Hawkman and most of the JSA retire for the bulk of the 1950s.\n\n[[Image:Carter-Hall-knife.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Carter Hall finds the ancient knife connected to his past life. Interior panel of ''Flash Comics'' #1 (1940).<br> Art by Dennis Neville.]]\nThe JSA and Hawkman regroup in the early 1960s following the Flash's [[Flash of Two Worlds|meeting]] with [[Flash (Barry Allen)|his counterpart]] on the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]] [[Earth-One|Earth-1]], the JSA being active on [[Earth-Two|Earth-2]]. Around this time, the Halls, having married, have a son, [[Hector Hall|Hector]]. Little is known of Hawkman's activities during the 1960s, other than the JSA's annual meeting with Earth-1's [[Justice League|Justice League of America]].\n\nIn the early 1980s, Hawkman is instrumental in denying his son and other JSA children membership in the JSA, leading directly to the formation of [[Infinity, Inc.]]\n\nFollowing ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', some of Hall's history was [[retroactive continuity|retconned]] by DC when the parallel worlds were combined into one, but one piece of [[retroactive continuity]] was written before ''Crisis'' and fills out early Hall history:\n''[[All-Star Squadron|All-Star Squadron Annual]]'' #3 states that during a JSA battle against Ian Karkull, the villain imbued them with energy which retarded their aging, allowing Hall and many others - as well as their spouses - to remain active into the late 20th century without infirmity.\n\nAlso, following the Crisis, the Golden Age and the [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Silver Age]] Hawkmen lived on the same Earth, until Carter was cast off into Limbo in the ''[[Last Days of the Justice Society of America|Last Days of the Justice Society]]'' one-shot.\n\nOriginally, the ''Hawkworld'' miniseries retold the origins of [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Katar Hol]] and [[Hawkwoman#Shayera Thal|Shayera Thal]] from a modern perspective, but following its success, DC launched a ''Hawkworld'' regular series, taking place ''after'' the miniseries, resulting in a complete [[reboot (continuity)|reboot]] of Hawkman's continuity.\n\n===Post-''Hawkworld'' (or current) origin===\nMuch of Carter Hall's post-Hawkworld history is fleshed out in the pages of DC's ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'' and ''Hawkman'' (vol. 4). These two titles, penned to a great extent by writers [[David S. Goyer]], [[Geoff Johns]], and [[James Robinson (comics)|James Dale Robinson]], examine Hall's previous lives.\n\nAccording to the post-Hawkworld origin, Prince Khufu lives during the reign of [[Ramesses II]] in the 19th dynasty of [[ancient Egypt]]. Khufu believes that his ''[[Egyptian soul|ka]]'', or soul, will not journey on to the land of the afterlife. Rather, his soul and that of his betrothed, [[Hawkgirl#Golden Age|Chay-Ara]], are fated to remain in the mortal world.\n\nAs prophesied by the [[magician (fantasy)|wizard]] [[Nabu (comics)|Nabu]], a [[spacecraft]] lands in Egypt. Prince Khufu, [[Nabu (comics)|Nabu]], and the champion [[Black Adam|Teth-Adam]] search the desert, finally coming across the remains of a [[Thanagar]]ian ship styled with a hawk-like motif. Nabu casts a spell translating the strange language of the female space traveler. Just before dying, she whispers the words, \"[[Nth metal]]\", the name of the substance that powered the downed ship.\n\nTeth-Adam lifts the ship back to Khufu's palace, where it is studied inside the Temple of [[Horus]] at Erdu. The remaining Nth metal is examined, and its most obvious property proves to be its ability to negate [[gravity]]. The remaining sample from the ship is melted and used to create several remarkable devices, including a [[Scarab (artifact)|scarab]] which allows Khufu to fly, a deadly knife, and a battle glove referred to as the ''Claw of Horus''. However, the metal also strengthens the souls of Khufu and Chay-Ara, binding them together in their love and imprinting them with the collective knowledge of Thanagar. Although the villainous priest [[Hath-Set]] murders the two with the knife of Nth metal, their souls live on in the mortal plane. They are [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] over many lifetimes, always finding true love in each other, but cursed to be repeatedly killed at the hands of a reincarnated Hath-Set.\n\n====From Khufu to Carter Hall====\nAfter his death, Khufu's soul is reincarnated countless times in markedly different eras and locations. Some of his known reincarnated identities have been depicted in ''Hawkman'' (vol. 4) and include, but are not limited to:\n\n*Brian Kent (also known as the [[Silent Knight]]), alive during 5th-century Britain, love of Lady Celia Penbrook;\n*Koenrad Von Grimm, the son of a blacksmith in 14th-century Germany;\n*[[John Smith (explorer)|Captain John Smith]] of the 16th-century [[Colony of Virginia]];\n*Hannibal Hawkes, the [[Nighthawk (DC Comics)|Nighthawk]], a [[gunfighter]] in the American Old West, love of [[Cinnamon (comics)|Cinnamon]];\n*Detective James Wright, a [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton]] detective in the early 20th century, love of Sheila Carr.\n\nEventually, the soul of Prince Khufu is reborn as Carter Hall, an archaeologist active during the 1940s. After regaining the memories of his first life in Egypt, Hall uses the hawk motif of the Egyptian god [[Horus]] to inspire his role as the original Hawkman.\n[[Image:Hawk lives.jpg|thumb|300px|Some of Carter Hall's lives and wives. Art by [[Joe Bennett (artist)|Joe Bennett]].]]\nDuring the same period, his love Chay-Ara is reborn as archaeologist Shiera Saunders. After the two meet and marry, she becomes [[Hawkgirl]], fighting at Carter's side. They become founding members of the [[Justice Society of America]], and Hawkman takes the role of chairman. The pair reduce their activities in the early 1950s but became fully active again in the early 1980s when Hall briefly joins the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] as a mentor. The two have a son, [[Hector Hall]], who later becomes an incarnation of [[Doctor Fate]]. Just following the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' maxiseries, Hawkman and the JSA become trapped in a battle in an ever-repeating [[Ragnar\u00f6k]].\n\nYears after they vanish, Hawkman and the JSA return to the modern day when a primitive but superpowered tribe volunteer to substitute themselves in the Ragnar\u00f6k cycle. Soon after, however, death finds Carter once again during the events of ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]''. He and his wife Shiera merge with [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Katar Hol]] and a \"hawk god\" creature in a new version of Hawkman, attributed to them being fundamentally unstable due to their complex origins as a result of the last [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]]. This individual is active for a brief time, but soon loses his sanity and is banished to Limbo.\n\n====Alive again====\nYears later, JSA member [[Hawkgirl#Kendra Saunders|Kendra Saunders]] is transported to a ravaged Thanagar by the High Priests of the Downsiders. Seeking a champion to stop the evil [[Onimar Synn]] from enslaving the planet, the priests use Kendra's centuries-old connection to Carter to bring him back to the mortal [[Plane (esotericism)|plane]]. Following this unorthodox resurrection, Hall retains all the memories of his past lives, as well as those of [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)#Post-Hawkworld|Katar Hol]], the [[Thanagar]]ian [[Hawkman]]. However, Kendra has no interest in renewing the relationship due to her lack of memories of their past time together, and the role as chairman in the JSA goes to [[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Mister Terrific]] by majority vote (over both Sand and Hawkman) . During the ''Black Reign'' storyline, however, Hawkman takes over as chairman to lead the team against [[Black Adam]]'s recent takeover of Khandaq, but after his actions result in two deaths and their main objective-to bring Adam's team back to America-fails, he is asked to temporarily step down from the JSA.\n\nAfter defeating [[Onimar Synn]], Hall once again becomes a member of the JSA. Operating both with the JSA as well as with Hawkgirl, Hall embarks on a wide variety of exotic adventures. His quest as a hero takes him from the streets of St. Roch to exotic dimensions and even into outer space as he fights in the [[Rann-Thanagar War]]. Following this event Carter stays in space to help mediate the truce on Rann and avenge the murder of [[Hawkwoman#Shayera Thal|Hawkwoman]].\n\nAs a result, Hawkman is absent during [[DC Comics]]' ''[[One Year Later]]'' event. ''Hawkman (vol. 4)'' becomes ''Hawkgirl'' at issue #50 and Hawkgirl is left by herself to patrol and protect St. Roch. During the events of the missing year, Hall serves as a member of the Thanagarian police force, attaining the rank of Commissioner.\n \nIn 2007, Hall returns to Earth in a 4-part story-arc presented in ''Hawkgirl'' #59-60 and ''JSA Classified'' #21-22 and appears as an active member of the [[Justice Society of America|JSA]] in the pages of ''Justice Society of America''. This series was canceled with ''Hawkgirl'' issue #66 in July 2007.\n\nAfter that, it was stated that Katar Hol's soul has passed on from the realm of limbo, as have his memories that existed in Carter's mind. Despite this, Carter still existed in a reconstructed version of Katar Hol's body. However, in a Hawkman Special published in August 2008, the mysterious being called Demiurge told Carter Hall that his previous existence as Prince Khufu was all an illusion created by some unknown force.  As Demiurge departs, he calls Hawkman \"Katar Hol\", indicating that Hawkman is in reality Katar Hol who believed he was Carter Hall.\n\nHe briefly assisted the Justice League during their battle with the [[Shadow Cabinet (comics)|Shadow Cabinet]] by knocking out [[Hardware (comics)|Hardware]] as he tried to flee from the [[Justice League Watchtower|JLA Watchtower]] with [[Arthur Light]]'s corpse. In the aftermath of the battle, Carter reunited with Kendra after she was dumped by [[Roy Harper (comics)|Red Arrow]].\n\n====''Final Crisis''====\nDuring the ''[[Final Crisis]]'' crossover event, Hawkman, like all the other heroes, fights to stop [[Darkseid]] from destroying the DC [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]]. In an attempt to save civilians, [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] creates a dimensional tunnel between universes. It begins breaking down, and [[OMAC (comics)|Lord Eye]] tries to close it, which will kill all the people still in the tunnel. Hawkman and Hawkgirl manage to destroy Lord Eye, but are caught in the explosion. In the meantime all the other people are safely transported via a second [[Boom Tube]]. This fulfills the prophecy of the Demiurge.<ref>''Final Crisis'' #7 (March 2009)</ref> While it is implied that Hawkman and Hawkgirl are dead, author [[Geoff Johns]] has stated they are alive at the beginning of the upcoming event, the ''[[Blackest Night]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19906 |title=NYYC: DC Nation |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=2009-02-06 |accessdate=2011-04-11}}</ref> It is later confirmed in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' that Hawkgirl is alive, but is hospitalized.\n\n====''Blackest Night''====\n{{Main|Blackest Night}}\nIn ''Blackest Night'' #1, Kendra is shown having an argument with Hawkman over whether or not to visit [[Jean Loring]]'s grave with the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]]. As the two heroes quarrel, the reanimated corpses of [[Elongated Man|Ralph]] and [[Sue Dibny]], now members of the [[Black Lantern Corps]], enter Hawkman's sanctuary. The Black Lanterns attack, Sue impaling Hawkgirl on a spear. Ralph taunts Hawkman, telling him that Hawkgirl never loved him; a claim she refutes with her dying breath. Hawkman is killed shortly afterward, and both heroes are reanimated as Black Lanterns by [[Black Hand (comics)|Black Hand]] himself.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #1 (July 2009)</ref>\n\nIt was also revealed in ''Green Lantern'' #46 that Khufu and Chay-Ara's bodies were taken from Earth by the [[Zamaron]]s and placed in the violet central power battery. Their love is the source of the Star Sapphire's powers. The pair receive black rings during the battle on Zamaron. Their escape from the central power battery causes widespread destruction on the planet, enough for the Star Sapphires to abandon the planet, and sets the Predator free; it does not seem to have affected the Star Sapphires' powers.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #46 (September 2009)</ref>\n\nDuring the battle at [[Coast City]], the Atom is chosen by the [[Indigo Tribe]] to be more effective against [[Nekron]]'s forces.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #6 (December 2009)</ref> The Atom tells Indigo-1 to keep his involvement in the deployment of the troops a secret, and asks that she help him find a way to legitimately resurrect Hawkman and Hawkgirl.<ref>''The Atom and Hawkman'' #46 (January 2010)</ref> In the final battle, Hawkman and Hawkgirl are both resurrected by the white light. Kendra is revealed to be Shiera Hall and remembers all her past lives; she and Carter joyfully reunite.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #8 (March 2010)</ref>\n\n====''Brightest Day''====\n{{main|Brightest Day}}\nIn the ''[[Brightest Day]]'' crossover event, Carter and Shiera follow Hath-Set, who has collected the bones from all of their past bodies, and created from them a portal to [[Hawkworld]]. While there, Carter is told by the [[White Lantern Corps|Entity]] to \"stop the Queen Khea\" from leaving.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #7 (August 2010)</ref> While Hawkgirl is held by Hath-Set and his Queen Khea, Hawkman and his group of the panthera attack the Manhawks homeworld. Hawkman hears Hawkgirl's cries and charges toward to rescue her. His arrival leads to a confrontation with Queen Khea, who turns out to be the mother of Shiera Hall. During the fight, Queen Khea controls his Nth metal mace and armor, and Hawkman is tied together with Hawkgirl. Queen Khea opens the gateway and enters the portal to the [[Zamaron]] homeworld.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #13 (November 2010)</ref> When she arrives on the Zamaron homeworld, Star Sapphire ([[Carol Ferris]]) frees them both to stop Queen Khea's invasion. The two attack Queen Khea as Hawkgirl wants to face her, but the Predator Entity bonds with the Queen.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #17 (January 2011)</ref>\n\nShiera and Carter manage to eventually separate both of them by stabbing Khea at the same time with weapons made of Zamaronian crystals. The bones of the past lives of Hawkman and Hawkgirl separate from the gateway, and, animated by the violet light of love, grab Khea and imprison her in the Zamaronian central power battery. Shiera and Carter, with both of their missions accomplished and their lives returned, are teleported back to St. Roch by Carol. Carter and Shiera are interrupted by Deadman, whose white ring tells the two of them that they should lead separate lives. Carter refuses and says they are not going to live apart again, the ring responds \"So be it\" and unleashes a blast of white light that kills Hawkman and Hawkgirl, turning them into dust.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #18 (January 2011)</ref> Deadman orders the ring to resurrect both Hawkman and Hawkgirl, but the ring refuses, saying that Hawkman was brought back to life to overcome what held him back in his past life because he was essential in saving Earth.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #19 (February 2011)</ref>\n\nWhen the \"Dark Avatar\" made his presence known, Hawkman and Hawkgirl are revealed to be part of the Elementals, guardians of the forest located in [[Star City (comics)|Star City]]. They were transformed by the Entity to become the element of air and protect the Star City forest from the \"Dark Avatar\", which appears to be the Black Lantern version of the [[Swamp Thing]].<ref>''Brightest Day'' #23 (April 2011)</ref> The Elementals are then fused with the body of Alec Holland in order for him to be transformed by the Entity into the new Swamp Thing and battle against the Dark Avatar. After the Dark Avatar is defeated, Swamp Thing appears to have brought the Elementals back to normal; however, as Hawkman looks around for Shiera, he discovers that she was not brought back like he was. He is later told by Swamp Thing that Shiera is everywhere, revealing that she was still the elemental of air. Afterward, Hawkman returns home yelling \"Shiera!\"<ref>''Brightest Day'' #24 (April 2011)</ref>\n\n===''The New 52''===\nIn September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Hall tries to rid himself of his Hawkman armor by burning and burying it in a forest.

His origin of him as a pharaoh who is constantly being reincarnated is used for the character. Carter Hall is an archaeologist once again who is researching the origin of [[Nth metal]] and how it gives him his powers. At some point, Carter encountered Barbatos and hit him with his mace.\n\nWhen the aged Batman and Superman arrive at the World Forge, they realise they were too late and it has fallen to darkness and are met by a gigantic hammer wielding hawk-like beast who proclaims that it is Carter Hall, the dragon of Barbatos and Keeper of the Dark Forge, and that only endings are at the World Forge.<ref>''Dark Nights: Metal'' #4</ref>\n\nA new ''Hawkman'' series was announced in March with writing by Robert Venditti and art by Bryan Hitch, the book will explore Carter Hall's experiences after the events that happened during ''Dark Nights: Metal'', alongside his relationship to Hawkgirl.<ref>http://comicbook.com/dc/2018/03/14/hawkman-dc-comics-series-rob-venditti/</ref>\n\nThe first arc of the comic deals with Hall, believing there are gaps in the memories of his past lives, recovering a mystical artefact that allows him to unlock all his memories. He becomes aware of multiple previous incarnations of himself, which include [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Katar Hol]], and also has a vision of Earth in the future, destroyed by gigantic winged creatures (later revealed to be spaceships) known as the Deathbringers. Hall deduces that his first human incarnation, Prince Khufu, had the same vision, resulting in a winged figure becoming an important symbol throughout all his lives. \n\nCarter Hall also discovers that, as well as reincarnating over time on Earth, he has also lived multiple lives on alien worlds, and at least once two or more of his reincarnations have existed simultaneously. The other lives revealed are:\n\n* [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Katar Hol]] of Thanagar\n* Catar-Ol of Krypton\n* Golden Hawk, a legendary hero of an unnamed planet destroyed by the returning Deathbringers\n* Avion, an ancient hero of the Microverse\n* The Dragon of Barabatos\n* Airwing of New Genesis\n* Katarthul of Rann\n* Red Harrier\n\nHis lives throughout Earth's history include:\n\n* Prince Khufu, the Ancient Egyptian warrior prince.\n* Silent Knight, a medieval hero.\n* Birdman, of the Easter Islands.\n* Nighthawk, the gunslinging western hero.\n\nHe also spent centuries being reincarnated on the planet Nebulen, which was being fought over by two alien armies in a seemingly endless war. Hawkman was endlessly reincarnated as a common foot soldier, alternately being part of each side. He eventually ended the war by walking into the no man's land alone and unarmed, offering his food to the opposing side. A redheaded female enemy soldier, potentially a reincarnation of Hawkgirl, left her trenches to meet with him, and exchanged food. Both sides then abandoned the conflict and made peace, deserting en masse to settle together on Nebulen, which grew into an advanced and peaceful society. A statue memorialises the anonymous soldier whose gesture of peace ended the war.<ref>''Hawkman'' #13 (June 2019). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nWith the aid of the descendants of people he saved in previous lives, Carter begins following a trail of clues left by his past selves to uncover the mystery of his vision, while also randomly being pulled through time and space by unknown means to encounter his past selves. This journey leads him from the ends of the Earth, to the Microverse, and into the depths of space. He deduces that his past selves knew the purpose of the visions of the Deathbringers and realised that they were starting to forget, and therefore left the trail for their future incarnations.\n\nCarter experiences a vision of his original incarnation, Ktar Deathbringer. Ktar was general of the Deathbringers, a race of winged humanoid aliens who cut a swathe through the galaxy in the distant past, slaughtering millions on Earth, [[Rann (fictional planet)|Rann]], [[Thanagar]], [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]], and many others. The Deathbringers would sacrifice the few survivors on their temple world of Qgga to a being known as the \"Lord Beyond the Void\" that resides behind a rift in space. At each battlefield, Ktar would be visited by an apparition of a [[Hawkgirl|red-haired woman]]. With each slaughter, his guilt and self-loathing grew. On Qgga, while preparing the final sacrifice that would allow the Lord to enter the universe, Ktar was visited by the woman again and turned on the Deathbringers, destroying Qgga and sending the Deathbringers into the void. Upon his death, Ktar was offered a chance to atone by endlessly reincarnating, only being allowed to finally pass on when he had saved as many people as he had killed. He was also ordered to prepare for the return of the Deathbringers, who are shown to be active in the galaxy under the leadership of Idamm, Ktar's long-term second in command.<ref>''Hawkman'' #7 (December 2018). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nCarter's search ultimately beings him to the former site of Krypton. Transported through time to Krypton's last day he encounters his past self Catar-Ol, a historian and tutor to Kara Zor-El, the future [[Supergirl]]. Unlike other prior reincarnations, Catar also possesses past life memories and is aware of the Deathbringers. He was working to build a weapon to defeat the Deathbringers, which the trail of clues lead to, however, he was unable to complete it before Krypton's destruction. Carter is disheartened, but Catar encourages him to find another way to save Earth, telling him that he must \"be the weapon\".<ref>''Hawkman'' #8 (January 2019).

Utilising his centuries of combat experience, Carter viciously beats Idamm down, repeatedly inflicting what would be lethal damage to another opponent. Idamm eventually yields and surrenders the role of general to Carter. Carter orders the Deathbringers to stand down, with none daring to question his leadership. Before returning to their proper places in the timestream, the other Hawkmen transfer their memories to Hall, allowing him to remember his full history for the first time.<ref>''Hawkman'' #12 (May 2019).

This life learned about his origins as Ktar Deathbringer and the debt he must pay. However, Sky Tyrant is afraid of dying and decided to prolong his 'immortality' and add to the debt by killing people on his Earth. After dying by unknown means, Sky Tyrant was locked away in Carter's subconscious until the latter was unknowingly infected by the Batman Who Laughs and a recent encounter with Shadow Thief caused Sky Tyrant to reemerge and trap Carter in his own consciousness. Sky Tyrant was confronted by Shayera Hol/Hawkwoman but soon escaped before she could defeat him.

Promotional image for the cover to ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'' #23 by Andrew Robinson.]]\nThe [[Nth metal]] in Hawkman's wings, belt, harness, and boots is controlled mentally and allows him to defy [[gravity]]. His wings allow him to control flight, though they can be \"flapped\" through use of shoulder motions.\n\nHall's Nth metal also enhances his strength and eyesight, speeds healing, and regulates body temperature, preventing the need for heavy protective clothing while flying at high altitudes. Nth metal is known to affect [[electromagnetism]] as well as the [[strong interaction|strong]] and [[weak interaction|weak]] nuclear forces of the universe, but only if one has the knowledge of how to use it in those ways. It is also mentioned in ''Hawkman: Secret Files and Origins'' #1 (2002) that Nth metal possesses powers still unknown to Hall.\n\nDue to his multiple incarnations and having the memories of all of them, Khufu/Hall has become proficient in many types of weaponry. As a result, he is an expert with a wide array of archaic weapons from his past lives, including [[battle axe]]s, [[mace (bludgeon)|maces]], [[sword]]s, [[spear]]s, and [[shield]]s. As Nighthawk, he was a marksman with a pistol. In addition, Carter Hall is sometimes depicted handling futuristic technology. He has used a Thanagarian ship called \"The Brontadon\", and during the [[Rann-Thanagar War]] used Rannian hard-light armor. Hawkman is even depicted using technologically advanced laser weaponry in a possible future (''Hawkman'', vol. 4, #9). Reincarnation has also given Hawkman knowledge of hundreds of languages.\n\nAs a result of his many lives and vast amount of experience, Hall is a brilliant tactician, fierce warrior, and strong leader; indeed, during the ''Public Enemies'' story arc in the ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' series, he was selected as the perfect hero to confront [[Batman]], possessing the significant advantage of his flight and strength but otherwise being Batman's equal (although Batman outsmarted Hawkman). At the same time, however, he is extremely intelligent (considered a leader in his field of history and archaeology) and expresses a deeply romantic side in relation to his beloved soulmate.\n\n==Characterization==\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2011}}\nHe has been characterized in comics as having a quick, fierce temper with adamant views and opinions. Even in the Golden Age, he had no problem blowing up a villain's lair with the villain inside.<ref>''All Star Comics'' #1 (Summer 1940)</ref> At the same time, Carter finds it difficult to balance the \"savage barbarian\" of his past lives with the \"gentleman\" of his current incarnation.{{original research inline|date=February 2011}}\n\nAnother prominent aspect of his personality is his staunch conservative views; this has brought him into conflict with [[Green Arrow]] (a liberal) several times. During the miniseries ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'', it was revealed that the main reason for this animosity was the opposing views that he and Green Arrow took on the [[mindwipe]] of [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]], to the point that they came to blows.\n\nIt appears, since his rebirth, that Carter Hall has integrated a lot of Katar Hol into his core being. He physically looks like a merger of Katar and himself, while also using the more rugged superhero attire that was a trademark of Katar Hol. Although he has Katar's dark hair, his voice and face appear to be his own as he is easily recognized by Jay Garrick upon return.\n\nPost-Metal, Carter has become a much more reserved character, in stark contrast of his personality Pre-Flashpoint. He now shows a deeper understanding of history and spirituality. He has also shown more reservation to entering battle, but is still willing to fight.\n\n==Other versions==\n* In Mark Waid's ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', Carter Hall is portrayed as an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]], literal Hawkman, who has become an [[Eco-terrorism|eco-terrorist]] in the absence of [[Superman]], wielding a large [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]].

Created by [[Gardner Fox]] and [[Dennis Neville]], the character first appeared in ''[[Flash Comics]]'' #1 (January 1940). There are two separate origins for Carter Hall: the Golden Age origin and the Post-Hawkworld (or current) origin.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Golden Age origin===\nIn the days of [[ancient Egypt]], Prince Khufu is engaged in a feud with his rival, the [[Egypt]]ian [[priest]] [[Hath-Set]]. The priest eventually captures both Khufu and his consort Chay-Ara, and kills them. Millennia later, in 1940, Khufu is reincarnated as [[United States|American]] [[archaeology|archaeologist]] '''Carter Hall''', and Chay-Ara as [[Hawkgirl#Golden Age|Shiera Sanders]]. Hath-Set himself is reincarnated as a scientist named Anton Hastor. Upon finding the ancient knife Hath-Set used to kill him, Hall regains his memories of his past life and recognizes Hastor as the reincarnated evil priest.\n\nUsing the properties of \"Nth metal\" to craft a gravity-defying belt, Hall creates wings and a costume, ultimately confronting Hastor as Hawkman after Anton captured Shiera with a spell that drew her to his lair. He also encounters and remembers Shiera during this time. Following Hastor's defeat, the two begin a romance.\n\nHawkman becomes a charter member of the [[Justice Society of America]], and takes the position of permanent chairman, following the [[Jay Garrick|Flash]] and [[Alan Scott|Green Lantern]]. Shiera, meanwhile, adopts the identity of [[Hawkgirl#Golden Age|Hawkgirl]] and fights beside Hall throughout the 1940s. In 1942, Carter enlists in the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Force]] as an Airman<ref>''All-Star Squadron'' #16 (Dec. 1982)</ref> and serves as a pilot with the [[I Fighter Command|1st Interceptor Command]] during [[World War II]].<ref>''All-Star Comics'' #11 (June\u2013July 1942)</ref>\n\nHawkman is JSA chairman in 1951 when the team is investigated by the \"Joint Congressional Un-American Activities Committee\" (based on the real-life [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]) for possible [[communist]] sympathies. Congress asks members of the JSA to reveal their [[secret identity|identities]]. The heroes decline, and Hawkman and most of the JSA retire for the bulk of the 1950s.\n\n[[Image:Carter-Hall-knife.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Carter Hall finds the ancient knife connected to his past life. Interior panel of ''Flash Comics'' #1 (1940).<br> Art by Dennis Neville.]]\nThe JSA and Hawkman regroup in the early 1960s following the Flash's [[Flash of Two Worlds|meeting]] with [[Flash (Barry Allen)|his counterpart]] on the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]] [[Earth-One|Earth-1]], the JSA being active on [[Earth-Two|Earth-2]]. Around this time, the Halls, having married, have a son, [[Hector Hall|Hector]]. Little is known of Hawkman's activities during the 1960s, other than the JSA's annual meeting with Earth-1's [[Justice League|Justice League of America]].\n\nIn the early 1980s, Hawkman is instrumental in denying his son and other JSA children membership in the JSA, leading directly to the formation of [[Infinity, Inc.]]\n\nFollowing ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', some of Hall's history was [[retroactive continuity|retconned]] by DC when the parallel worlds were combined into one, but one piece of [[retroactive continuity]] was written before ''Crisis'' and fills out early Hall history:\n''[[All-Star Squadron|All-Star Squadron Annual]]'' #3 states that during a JSA battle against Ian Karkull, the villain imbued them with energy which retarded their aging, allowing Hall and many others - as well as their spouses - to remain active into the late 20th century without infirmity.\n\nAlso, following the Crisis, the Golden Age and the [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Silver Age]] Hawkmen lived on the same Earth, until Carter was cast off into Limbo in the ''[[Last Days of the Justice Society of America|Last Days of the Justice Society]]'' one-shot.\n\nOriginally, the ''Hawkworld'' miniseries retold the origins of [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Katar Hol]] and [[Hawkwoman#Shayera Thal|Shayera Thal]] from a modern perspective, but following its success, DC launched a ''Hawkworld'' regular series, taking place ''after'' the miniseries, resulting in a complete [[reboot (continuity)|reboot]] of Hawkman's continuity.\n\n===Post-''Hawkworld'' (or current) origin===\nMuch of Carter Hall's post-Hawkworld history is fleshed out in the pages of DC's ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'' and ''Hawkman'' (vol. 4). These two titles, penned to a great extent by writers [[David S. Goyer]], [[Geoff Johns]], and [[James Robinson (comics)|James Dale Robinson]], examine Hall's previous lives.\n\nAccording to the post-Hawkworld origin, Prince Khufu lives during the reign of [[Ramesses II]] in the 19th dynasty of [[ancient Egypt]]. Khufu believes that his ''[[Egyptian soul|ka]]'', or soul, will not journey on to the land of the afterlife. Rather, his soul and that of his betrothed, [[Hawkgirl#Golden Age|Chay-Ara]], are fated to remain in the mortal world.\n\nAs prophesied by the [[magician (fantasy)|wizard]] [[Nabu (comics)|Nabu]], a [[spacecraft]] lands in Egypt. Prince Khufu, [[Nabu (comics)|Nabu]], and the champion [[Black Adam|Teth-Adam]] search the desert, finally coming across the remains of a [[Thanagar]]ian ship styled with a hawk-like motif. Nabu casts a spell translating the strange language of the female space traveler. Just before dying, she whispers the words, \"[[Nth metal]]\", the name of the substance that powered the downed ship.\n\nTeth-Adam lifts the ship back to Khufu's palace, where it is studied inside the Temple of [[Horus]] at Erdu. The remaining Nth metal is examined, and its most obvious property proves to be its ability to negate [[gravity]]. The remaining sample from the ship is melted and used to create several remarkable devices, including a [[Scarab (artifact)|scarab]] which allows Khufu to fly, a deadly knife, and a battle glove referred to as the ''Claw of Horus''. However, the metal also strengthens the souls of Khufu and Chay-Ara, binding them together in their love and imprinting them with the collective knowledge of Thanagar. Although the villainous priest [[Hath-Set]] murders the two with the knife of Nth metal, their souls live on in the mortal plane. They are [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] over many lifetimes, always finding true love in each other, but cursed to be repeatedly killed at the hands of a reincarnated Hath-Set.\n\n====From Khufu to Carter Hall====\nAfter his death, Khufu's soul is reincarnated countless times in markedly different eras and locations. Some of his known reincarnated identities have been depicted in ''Hawkman'' (vol. 4) and include, but are not limited to:\n\n*Brian Kent (also known as the [[Silent Knight]]), alive during 5th-century Britain, love of Lady Celia Penbrook;\n*Koenrad Von Grimm, the son of a blacksmith in 14th-century Germany;\n*[[John Smith (explorer)|Captain John Smith]] of the 16th-century [[Colony of Virginia]];\n*Hannibal Hawkes, the [[Nighthawk (DC Comics)|Nighthawk]], a [[gunfighter]] in the American Old West, love of [[Cinnamon (comics)|Cinnamon]];\n*Detective James Wright, a [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton]] detective in the early 20th century, love of Sheila Carr.\n\nEventually, the soul of Prince Khufu is reborn as Carter Hall, an archaeologist active during the 1940s. After regaining the memories of his first life in Egypt, Hall uses the hawk motif of the Egyptian god [[Horus]] to inspire his role as the original Hawkman.\n[[Image:Hawk lives.jpg|thumb|300px|Some of Carter Hall's lives and wives. Art by [[Joe Bennett (artist)|Joe Bennett]].]]\nDuring the same period, his love Chay-Ara is reborn as archaeologist Shiera Saunders. After the two meet and marry, she becomes [[Hawkgirl]], fighting at Carter's side. They become founding members of the [[Justice Society of America]], and Hawkman takes the role of chairman. The pair reduce their activities in the early 1950s but became fully active again in the early 1980s when Hall briefly joins the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] as a mentor. The two have a son, [[Hector Hall]], who later becomes an incarnation of [[Doctor Fate]]. Just following the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' maxiseries, Hawkman and the JSA become trapped in a battle in an ever-repeating [[Ragnar\u00f6k]].\n\nYears after they vanish, Hawkman and the JSA return to the modern day when a primitive but superpowered tribe volunteer to substitute themselves in the Ragnar\u00f6k cycle. Soon after, however, death finds Carter once again during the events of ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]''. He and his wife Shiera merge with [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Katar Hol]] and a \"hawk god\" creature in a new version of Hawkman, attributed to them being fundamentally unstable due to their complex origins as a result of the last [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]]. This individual is active for a brief time, but soon loses his sanity and is banished to Limbo.\n\n====Alive again====\nYears later, JSA member [[Hawkgirl#Kendra Saunders|Kendra Saunders]] is transported to a ravaged Thanagar by the High Priests of the Downsiders. Seeking a champion to stop the evil [[Onimar Synn]] from enslaving the planet, the priests use Kendra's centuries-old connection to Carter to bring him back to the mortal [[Plane (esotericism)|plane]]. Following this unorthodox resurrection, Hall retains all the memories of his past lives, as well as those of [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)#Post-Hawkworld|Katar Hol]], the [[Thanagar]]ian [[Hawkman]]. However, Kendra has no interest in renewing the relationship due to her lack of memories of their past time together, and the role as chairman in the JSA goes to [[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Mister Terrific]] by majority vote (over both Sand and Hawkman) . During the ''Black Reign'' storyline, however, Hawkman takes over as chairman to lead the team against [[Black Adam]]'s recent takeover of Khandaq, but after his actions result in two deaths and their main objective-to bring Adam's team back to America-fails, he is asked to temporarily step down from the JSA.\n\nAfter defeating [[Onimar Synn]], Hall once again becomes a member of the JSA. Operating both with the JSA as well as with Hawkgirl, Hall embarks on a wide variety of exotic adventures. His quest as a hero takes him from the streets of St. Roch to exotic dimensions and even into outer space as he fights in the [[Rann-Thanagar War]]. Following this event Carter stays in space to help mediate the truce on Rann and avenge the murder of [[Hawkwoman#Shayera Thal|Hawkwoman]].\n\nAs a result, Hawkman is absent during [[DC Comics]]' ''[[One Year Later]]'' event. ''Hawkman (vol. 4)'' becomes ''Hawkgirl'' at issue #50 and Hawkgirl is left by herself to patrol and protect St. Roch. During the events of the missing year, Hall serves as a member of the Thanagarian police force, attaining the rank of Commissioner.\n \nIn 2007, Hall returns to Earth in a 4-part story-arc presented in ''Hawkgirl'' #59-60 and ''JSA Classified'' #21-22 and appears as an active member of the [[Justice Society of America|JSA]] in the pages of ''Justice Society of America''. This series was canceled with ''Hawkgirl'' issue #66 in July 2007.\n\nAfter that, it was stated that Katar Hol's soul has passed on from the realm of limbo, as have his memories that existed in Carter's mind. Despite this, Carter still existed in a reconstructed version of Katar Hol's body. However, in a Hawkman Special published in August 2008, the mysterious being called Demiurge told Carter Hall that his previous existence as Prince Khufu was all an illusion created by some unknown force.  As Demiurge departs, he calls Hawkman \"Katar Hol\", indicating that Hawkman is in reality Katar Hol who believed he was Carter Hall.\n\nHe briefly assisted the Justice League during their battle with the [[Shadow Cabinet (comics)|Shadow Cabinet]] by knocking out [[Hardware (comics)|Hardware]] as he tried to flee from the [[Justice League Watchtower|JLA Watchtower]] with [[Arthur Light]]'s corpse. In the aftermath of the battle, Carter reunited with Kendra after she was dumped by [[Roy Harper (comics)|Red Arrow]].\n\n====''Final Crisis''====\nDuring the ''[[Final Crisis]]'' crossover event, Hawkman, like all the other heroes, fights to stop [[Darkseid]] from destroying the DC [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]]. In an attempt to save civilians, [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] creates a dimensional tunnel between universes. It begins breaking down, and [[OMAC (comics)|Lord Eye]] tries to close it, which will kill all the people still in the tunnel. Hawkman and Hawkgirl manage to destroy Lord Eye, but are caught in the explosion. In the meantime all the other people are safely transported via a second [[Boom Tube]]. This fulfills the prophecy of the Demiurge.<ref>''Final Crisis'' #7 (March 2009)</ref> While it is implied that Hawkman and Hawkgirl are dead, author [[Geoff Johns]] has stated they are alive at the beginning of the upcoming event, the ''[[Blackest Night]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19906 |title=NYYC: DC Nation |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=2009-02-06 |accessdate=2011-04-11}}</ref> It is later confirmed in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' that Hawkgirl is alive, but is hospitalized.\n\n====''Blackest Night''====\n{{Main|Blackest Night}}\nIn ''Blackest Night'' #1, Kendra is shown having an argument with Hawkman over whether or not to visit [[Jean Loring]]'s grave with the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]]. As the two heroes quarrel, the reanimated corpses of [[Elongated Man|Ralph]] and [[Sue Dibny]], now members of the [[Black Lantern Corps]], enter Hawkman's sanctuary. The Black Lanterns attack, Sue impaling Hawkgirl on a spear. Ralph taunts Hawkman, telling him that Hawkgirl never loved him; a claim she refutes with her dying breath. Hawkman is killed shortly afterward, and both heroes are reanimated as Black Lanterns by [[Black Hand (comics)|Black Hand]] himself.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #1 (July 2009)</ref>\n\nIt was also revealed in ''Green Lantern'' #46 that Khufu and Chay-Ara's bodies were taken from Earth by the [[Zamaron]]s and placed in the violet central power battery. Their love is the source of the Star Sapphire's powers. The pair receive black rings during the battle on Zamaron. Their escape from the central power battery causes widespread destruction on the planet, enough for the Star Sapphires to abandon the planet, and sets the Predator free; it does not seem to have affected the Star Sapphires' powers.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #46 (September 2009)</ref>\n\nDuring the battle at [[Coast City]], the Atom is chosen by the [[Indigo Tribe]] to be more effective against [[Nekron]]'s forces.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #6 (December 2009)</ref> The Atom tells Indigo-1 to keep his involvement in the deployment of the troops a secret, and asks that she help him find a way to legitimately resurrect Hawkman and Hawkgirl.<ref>''The Atom and Hawkman'' #46 (January 2010)</ref> In the final battle, Hawkman and Hawkgirl are both resurrected by the white light. Kendra is revealed to be Shiera Hall and remembers all her past lives; she and Carter joyfully reunite.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #8 (March 2010)</ref>\n\n====''Brightest Day''====\n{{main|Brightest Day}}\nIn the ''[[Brightest Day]]'' crossover event, Carter and Shiera follow Hath-Set, who has collected the bones from all of their past bodies, and created from them a portal to [[Hawkworld]]. While there, Carter is told by the [[White Lantern Corps|Entity]] to \"stop the Queen Khea\" from leaving.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #7 (August 2010)</ref> While Hawkgirl is held by Hath-Set and his Queen Khea, Hawkman and his group of the panthera attack the Manhawks homeworld. Hawkman hears Hawkgirl's cries and charges toward to rescue her. His arrival leads to a confrontation with Queen Khea, who turns out to be the mother of Shiera Hall. During the fight, Queen Khea controls his Nth metal mace and armor, and Hawkman is tied together with Hawkgirl. Queen Khea opens the gateway and enters the portal to the [[Zamaron]] homeworld.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #13 (November 2010)</ref> When she arrives on the Zamaron homeworld, Star Sapphire ([[Carol Ferris]]) frees them both to stop Queen Khea's invasion. The two attack Queen Khea as Hawkgirl wants to face her, but the Predator Entity bonds with the Queen.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #17 (January 2011)</ref>\n\nShiera and Carter manage to eventually separate both of them by stabbing Khea at the same time with weapons made of Zamaronian crystals. The bones of the past lives of Hawkman and Hawkgirl separate from the gateway, and, animated by the violet light of love, grab Khea and imprison her in the Zamaronian central power battery. Shiera and Carter, with both of their missions accomplished and their lives returned, are teleported back to St. Roch by Carol. Carter and Shiera are interrupted by Deadman, whose white ring tells the two of them that they should lead separate lives. Carter refuses and says they are not going to live apart again, the ring responds \"So be it\" and unleashes a blast of white light that kills Hawkman and Hawkgirl, turning them into dust.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #18 (January 2011)</ref> Deadman orders the ring to resurrect both Hawkman and Hawkgirl, but the ring refuses, saying that Hawkman was brought back to life to overcome what held him back in his past life because he was essential in saving Earth.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #19 (February 2011)</ref>\n\nWhen the \"Dark Avatar\" made his presence known, Hawkman and Hawkgirl are revealed to be part of the Elementals, guardians of the forest located in [[Star City (comics)|Star City]]. They were transformed by the Entity to become the element of air and protect the Star City forest from the \"Dark Avatar\", which appears to be the Black Lantern version of the [[Swamp Thing]].<ref>''Brightest Day'' #23 (April 2011)</ref> The Elementals are then fused with the body of Alec Holland in order for him to be transformed by the Entity into the new Swamp Thing and battle against the Dark Avatar. After the Dark Avatar is defeated, Swamp Thing appears to have brought the Elementals back to normal; however, as Hawkman looks around for Shiera, he discovers that she was not brought back like he was. He is later told by Swamp Thing that Shiera is everywhere, revealing that she was still the elemental of air.

At some point, Carter encountered Barbatos and hit him with his mace.\n\nWhen the aged Batman and Superman arrive at the World Forge, they realise they were too late and it has fallen to darkness and are met by a gigantic hammer wielding hawk-like beast who proclaims that it is Carter Hall, the dragon of Barbatos and Keeper of the Dark Forge, and that only endings are at the World Forge.<ref>''Dark Nights: Metal'' #4</ref>\n\nA new ''Hawkman'' series was announced in March with writing by Robert Venditti and art by Bryan Hitch, the book will explore Carter Hall's experiences after the events that happened during ''Dark Nights: Metal'', alongside his relationship to Hawkgirl.<ref>http://comicbook.com/dc/2018/03/14/hawkman-dc-comics-series-rob-venditti/</ref>\n\nThe first arc of the comic deals with Hall, believing there are gaps in the memories of his past lives, recovering a mystical artefact that allows him to unlock all his memories. He becomes aware of multiple previous incarnations of himself, which include [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Katar Hol]], and also has a vision of Earth in the future, destroyed by gigantic winged creatures (later revealed to be spaceships) known as the Deathbringers. Hall deduces that his first human incarnation, Prince Khufu, had the same vision, resulting in a winged figure becoming an important symbol throughout all his lives. \n\nCarter Hall also discovers that, as well as reincarnating over time on Earth, he has also lived multiple lives on alien worlds, and at least once two or more of his reincarnations have existed simultaneously. The other lives revealed are:\n\n* [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Katar Hol]] of Thanagar\n* Catar-Ol of Krypton\n* Golden Hawk, a legendary hero of an unnamed planet destroyed by the returning Deathbringers\n* Avion, an ancient hero of the Microverse\n* The Dragon of Barabatos\n* Airwing of New Genesis\n* Katarthul of Rann\n* Red Harrier\n\nHis lives throughout Earth's history include:\n\n* Prince Khufu, the Ancient Egyptian warrior prince.\n* Silent Knight, a medieval hero.\n* Birdman, of the Easter Islands.\n* Nighthawk, the gunslinging western hero.\n\nHe also spent centuries being reincarnated on the planet Nebulen, which was being fought over by two alien armies in a seemingly endless war. Hawkman was endlessly reincarnated as a common foot soldier, alternately being part of each side. He eventually ended the war by walking into the no man\u2019s land alone and unarmed, offering his food to the opposing side. A redheaded female enemy soldier, potentially a reincarnation of Hawkgirl, left her trenches to meet with him, and exchanged food. Both sides then abandoned the conflict and made peace, deserting en masse to settle together on Nebulen, which grew into an advanced and peaceful society. A statue memorialises the anonymous soldier whose gesture of peace ended the war.<ref>''Hawkman'' #13 (June 2019). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nWith the aid of the descendants of people he saved in previous lives, Carter begins following a trail of clues left by his past selves to uncover the mystery of his vision, while also randomly being pulled through time and space by unknown means to encounter his past selves. This journey leads him from the ends of the Earth, to the Microverse, and into the depths of space. He deduces that his past selves knew the purpose of the visions of the Deathbringers and realised that they were starting to forget, and therefore left the trail for their future incarnations.\n\nCarter experiences a vision of his original incarnation, Ktar Deathbringer. Ktar was general of the Deathbringers, a race of winged humanoid aliens who cut a swathe through the galaxy in the distant past, slaughtering millions on Earth, [[Rann (fictional planet)|Rann]], [[Thanagar]], [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]], and many others. The Deathbringers would sacrifice the few survivors on their temple world of Qgga to a being known as the \"Lord Beyond the Void\" that resides behind a rift in space. At each battlefield, Ktar would be visited by an apparition of a [[Hawkgirl|red-haired woman]]. With each slaughter, his guilt and self-loathing grew. On Qgga, while preparing the final sacrifice that would allow the Lord to enter the universe, Ktar was visited by the woman again and turned on the Deathbringers, destroying Qgga and sending the Deathbringers into the void. Upon his death, Ktar was offered a chance to atone by endlessly reincarnating, only being allowed to finally pass on when he had saved as many people as he had killed. He was also ordered to prepare for the return of the Deathbringers, who are shown to be active in the galaxy under the leadership of Idamm, Ktar's long-term second in command.<ref>''Hawkman'' #7 (December 2018). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nCarter's search ultimately beings him to the former site of Krypton. Transported through time to Krypton's last day he encounters his past self Catar-Ol, a historian and tutor to Kara Zor-El, the future [[Supergirl]]. Unlike other prior reincarnations, Catar also possesses past life memories and is aware of the Deathbringers. He was working to build a weapon to defeat the Deathbringers, which the trail of clues lead to, however, he was unable to complete it before Krypton's destruction. Carter is disheartened, but Catar encourages him to find another way to save Earth, telling him that he must \"be the weapon\".<ref>''Hawkman'' #8 (January 2019).

Utilising his centuries of combat experience, Carter viciously beats Idamm down, repeatedly inflicting what would be lethal damage to another opponent. Idamm eventually yields and surrenders the role of general to Carter. Carter orders the Deathbringers to stand down, with none daring to question his leadership. Before returning to their proper places in the timestream, the other Hawkmen transfer their memories to Hall, allowing him to remember his full history for the first time.<ref>''Hawkman'' #12 (May 2019). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nCarter discovered another one of his past lives in the form of Sky Tyrant. Sky Tyrant was Carter Hall's reincarnation on Earth-3. This life learned about his origins as Ktar Deathbringer and the debt he must pay. However, Sky Tyrant is afraid of dying and decided to prolong his 'immortality' and add to the debt by killing people on his Earth. After dying by unknown means, Sky Tyrant was locked away in Carter's subconscious until the latter was unknowingly infected by the Batman Who Laughs and a recent encounter with Shadow Thief caused Sky Tyrant to reemerge and trap Carter in his own consciousness. Sky Tyrant was confronted by Shayera Hol/Hawkwoman but soon escaped before she could defeat him. Using their shared consciousness, Sky Tyrant wished to learn more about their history through the secret Black Journal.<ref>''Hawkman'' #17-19 (2019)</ref>\n\nIn the \"[[Watchmen]]\" sequel \"[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]],\" Lois Lane finds a flash-drive among the mess while at the Daily Planet.

Promotional image for the cover to ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'' #23 by Andrew Robinson.]]\nThe [[Nth metal]] in Hawkman's wings, belt, harness, and boots is controlled mentally and allows him to defy [[gravity]]. His wings allow him to control flight, though they can be \"flapped\" through use of shoulder motions.\n\nHall's Nth metal also enhances his strength and eyesight, speeds healing, and regulates body temperature, preventing the need for heavy protective clothing while flying at high altitudes. Nth metal is known to affect [[electromagnetism]] as well as the [[strong interaction|strong]] and [[weak interaction|weak]] nuclear forces of the universe, but only if one has the knowledge of how to use it in those ways. It is also mentioned in ''Hawkman: Secret Files and Origins'' #1 (2002) that Nth metal possesses powers still unknown to Hall.\n\nDue to his multiple incarnations and having the memories of all of them, Khufu/Hall has become proficient in many types of weaponry. As a result, he is an expert with a wide array of archaic weapons from his past lives, including [[battle axe]]s, [[mace (bludgeon)|maces]], [[sword]]s, [[spear]]s, and [[shield]]s. As Nighthawk, he was a marksman with a pistol. In addition, Carter Hall is sometimes depicted handling futuristic technology. He has used a Thanagarian ship called \"The Brontadon\", and during the [[Rann-Thanagar War]] used Rannian hard-light armor. Hawkman is even depicted using technologically advanced laser weaponry in a possible future (''Hawkman'', vol. 4, #9). Reincarnation has also given Hawkman knowledge of hundreds of languages.\n\nAs a result of his many lives and vast amount of experience, Hall is a brilliant tactician, fierce warrior, and strong leader; indeed, during the ''Public Enemies'' story arc in the ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' series, he was selected as the perfect hero to confront [[Batman]], possessing the significant advantage of his flight and strength but otherwise being Batman's equal (although Batman outsmarted Hawkman). At the same time, however, he is extremely intelligent (considered a leader in his field of history and archaeology) and expresses a deeply romantic side in relation to his beloved soulmate.\n\n==Characterization==\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2011}}\nHe has been characterized in comics as having a quick, fierce temper with adamant views and opinions. Even in the Golden Age, he had no problem blowing up a villain's lair with the villain inside.<ref>''All Star Comics'' #1 (Summer 1940)</ref> At the same time, Carter finds it difficult to balance the \"savage barbarian\" of his past lives with the \"gentleman\" of his current incarnation.{{original research inline|date=February 2011}}\n\nAnother prominent aspect of his personality is his staunch conservative views; this has brought him into conflict with [[Green Arrow]] (a liberal) several times. During the miniseries ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'', it was revealed that the main reason for this animosity was the opposing views that he and Green Arrow took on the [[mindwipe]] of [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]], to the point that they came to blows.\n\nIt appears, since his rebirth, that Carter Hall has integrated a lot of Katar Hol into his core being. He physically looks like a merger of Katar and himself, while also using the more rugged superhero attire that was a trademark of Katar Hol. Although he has Katar's dark hair, his voice and face appear to be his own as he is easily recognized by Jay Garrick upon return.\n\nPost-Metal, Carter has become a much more reserved character, in stark contrast of his personality Pre-Flashpoint. He now shows a deeper understanding of history and spirituality. He has also shown more reservation to entering battle, but is still willing to fight.\n\n==Other versions==\n* In Mark Waid's ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', Carter Hall is portrayed as an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]], literal Hawkman, who has become an [[Eco-terrorism|eco-terrorist]] in the absence of [[Superman]], wielding a large [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]]. He dies in a nuclear explosion that kills nearly all the [[metahumans]].\n* In [[Tangent Comics]] (now part of the DC Multiverse as Earth-9) Carter Hall was an architect who attempted to commit suicide, dragging police officer [[Harvey Dent]] with him and ultimately triggering Dent's evolution into the Superman.\n* Carter Hall appeared in ''[[Justice League Adventures]]'' #20 as a member of the Justice Society. He is seen wearing a more hawk-like mask.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n\n====Live-action====\n* In ''[[The Flash (1990 TV series)|The Flash]]'' episode \"Watching The Detectives\", [[Tina McGee]] mentions that she is expecting a call from Carter Hall.\n[[Image:Smallville Hawkman.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Carter Hall as he appears in ''[[Smallville]],'' played by [[Michael Shanks]].]]\n* Actor [[Michael Shanks]] played Carter Hall in several episodes of seasons [[Smallville (season 9)|9]] and [[Smallville (season 10)|10]] of ''[[Smallville]]'', including the two-hour television movie ''[[Absolute Justice]]'' (which includes several other members of the Justice Society of America).<ref>{{cite web|author=Eric Goldman |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/103/1036548p1.html |title=Exclusive: Two of Smallville's Justice Society - TV News at IGN |publisher=Tv.ign.com |date=2009-10-19 |accessdate=2011-04-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0788218/#Actor|title=Michael Shanks (I)|publisher=[[IMDb.com]]|accessdate=2015-06-13}}</ref> In season 10 of ''[[Smallville]]'' episode 11, Carter Hall dies at the hands of [[Deathstroke|Slade Wilson]].

This version of Carter Hall is amalgamated with Katar Hol. He thinks that he and Hawkgirl are reincarnations of the two lovers and so, using Nth metal, he becomes Hawkman. He tries to get Shayera to love him, but soon realizes he is not really a reincarnation, but was under the influence of a Thanagarian telepathic ship's log.\n* Carter Hall appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode \"The Golden Age of Justice!\", voiced by [[William Katt]].
