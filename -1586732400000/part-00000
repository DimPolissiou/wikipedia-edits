Browngardt, who grew up the youngest in a large family of eight children (his eldest brother Tom would go on to work as the show's film editor), based the character upon the various and often eccentric relatives who would often drop by and visit them, as well as aspects of his own personality. The style of the show was inspired by his love of comics and [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]]. The pilot was produced in 2008, then aired online in 2009 on Cartoon Network Video as part of ''[[The Cartoonstitute]]''.<ref name=\"cartoonbrew1\">{{cite web|last=Amidi |first=Amid |url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/tv/uncle-grandpa-by-peter-browngardt-24524.html |title=Uncle Grandpa by Peter Browngardt |publisher=[[Cartoon Brew]] |date=June 15, 2010 |accessdate=August 8, 2013}}</ref> Akin to the ''[[Regular Show]]'' pilot, the ''Uncle Grandpa'' pilot was successful, but it had yet to have been [[Green-light|green-lit]] into its own series.<ref name=\"cartoonbrew1\"/>\n\nIn 2011, the TV series ''[[Secret Mountain Fort Awesome]]'' (based on the creatures that appear in the original short) aired on [[Cartoon Network]], but was not as well-received as the other ''Cartoon Network'' series at the time, and was eventually put on hiatus in February 2012.<ref name=\"cartoonbrew2\">{{cite web|last=Amidi|first=Amid|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/tv/secret-mountain-fort-awesome-talkback-50297.html|title=\"Secret Mountain Fort Awesome\" Talkback|publisher=[[Cartoon Brew]]|date=October 3, 2011|accessdate=August 8, 2013}}</ref> Despite the failure, ''Secret Mountain Fort Awesome'' went on to win several awards, including the coveted Crystal Award for \"Best Television Production\" at  [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival]], the first US-based production to do so.<ref name=\"cartoonbrew2\"/> This helped boost Browngardt's profile in getting ''Uncle Grandpa'' greenlit as a series.<ref name=\"cartoonbrew2\"/> Another factor that contributed to the launch of the show was the redesign of the character by [[John Kricfalusi]], ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]''{{'}}s creator.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/tv/john-k-draws-uncle-grandpa-76314.html|title=John K.

The children he visits have a problem of their own and Uncle Grandpa tries to help them through a series of chaotic and surreal misadventures. He is a clowny sort of person who sometimes eats inedible objects (paper, and mostly books). He drives/lives in a UG-2000 model robotic [[recreational vehicle|RV]] known as the Perpetual Persistence and is accompanied by a talking red [[fanny pack]] named Belly Bag, a green [[Stenonychosaurus|dinosauroid]] named Mr. Gus, a static photographic cutout of a [[tiger]] named Giant Realistic Flying Tiger, and an anthropomorphic pepperoni [[pizza]] slice named Pizza Steve.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Stack|[[File:Uncle Grandpa.png|thumb|Main characters from the series; from left to right: Uncle Grandpa and Belly Bag, Pizza Steve, Mr. Gus and Giant Realistic Flying Tiger (bottom)]]|float=right}}\n{{main|List of Secret Mountain Fort Awesome and Uncle Grandpa characters}}\n===Main===\n* Uncle Larry Jeff \"Bobo\" Grandpa (voiced by [[Peter Browngardt]], [[Pendleton Ward]] in \"For Pete! Love, Pen\"). Uncle Grandpa is a magical shapeshifting humanoid who is the uncle-grandpa of everyone in the world with a large, rectangular head, a brown [[horseshoe moustache]], a pink nose, a [[Beanie (seamed cap)#Propeller beanie|propeller hat]] that talks and an outfit consisting of a white T-shirt, [[lederhosen]] with rainbow [[suspenders]], knee high [[tube sock]]s, and black slippers. His outward appearance is depicted as rather clownish and unsophisticated, but he is well-meaning, fun-loving, supportive, and surprisingly competent when need be. His catchphrase is \"Good morning!\"\n* Baby Belly Bag (voiced by [[Eric Bauza]])&nbsp;\u2212 Uncle Grandpa's talking red fanny pack nephew and best friend who carries all of his priceless valuables, especially Uncle Grandpa's weapon of choice, which is his UG-series robotic laser hammer daughter named Samantha Grandpa. Belly Bag's insides contain many weird objects and dimensions, including a castle where Frankenstein lives. Despite being practically attached to Uncle Grandpa, he has the ability to walk and can produce multiple hands from inside his body. He even has the ability to see despite having no visible eyes. In the second Uncle Grandpa short \"Secret Mountain Uncle Grandpa\", he is referred to as Fanny Pack and voiced by [[Paul Rugg]]. His catchphrase is \"What's cookin', good-lookin'?\"\n*Little Mr. Michael Marshal \"Breakfast-Mysterious Gus\" Gusford (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]) \u2212 Mr. Gus is usually the voice of reason. He is a large, serious, yet somewhat grouchy green dinosaur (Reptoid) who was Uncle Grandpa's rival in \"Leg Wrestler\", but eventually became his friend and bodyguard. He is unfazed by most of Uncle Grandpa's eccentricities and seems to have an even temper despite his roommates, but often loses his temper, especially where Pizza Steve's antics are concerned. He's older, and more mature than Uncle Grandpa. One of Mr. Gus' favorite parts of the day is 9:00 PM, which is his designated bathroom time, and during that period he likes to take a bubble bath and read for an hour. His catchphrase is \"You're just sayin' that to get under my skin.\"\n* Little Nacho Pizza Dough James Walter Stevens \"Steve\" Cheese (voiced by [[Adam DeVine]], [[Pendleton Ward]] in 'For Pete! Love, Pen')&nbsp;\u2212 Pizza Steve is an anthropomorphic pepperoni pizza slice with sunglasses and a member of Uncle Grandpa's crew. He is depicted as extremely vain, troublesome, and often brags about how cool and awesome he is, which annoys his friend Mr. Gus. Despite this, he pretends to be very popular and a hit with women. He is a good friend of Uncle Grandpa. Pizza Steve is featured in his own cartoon shorts entitled \"A Slice of Life with Pizza Steve\", which usually involve Pizza Steve exaggerating his abilities. In \"Tiger Trails\", he claims to be a black belt in Italian Karate, but he wears the black belt over his eyes instead of around his waist. He also is meant to cheat, like for instance in \u201cLeg Wrestler\u201d, he trained Uncle Grandpa, and forced Mr. Gus to do his chores, so uncle Grandpa could Cream him. His catchphrase is \"I'm like a modern-day Thomas Einstein except a brazillion times better!\"\n* Tiny-Giant Realistic Flying Baby Tiger \u2212 A static photographic cutout of a [[tiger]] that Uncle Grandpa rides on to get around. Tiger is his pet and other best friend, and while she exhibits normal tiger traits such as only being able to communicate by roaring, she is able to fly and leaves a rainbow trail as she goes. The rainbow trail is also expelled from Tiger's rear end when she passes gas. Her personality is a cross between that of a stereotypical [[teenage]] girl, a house cat, and a real-life tiger. In order for Tiger's emotions to be shown, only certain parts of her body (specifically her facial ones) are animated. This is done in a stop-motion style.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Michael \"Tiny Miracle\" Grandpa, Jr. the Robot Boy (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]])&nbsp;\u2013 Uncle Grandpa's imaginary UG-series robot grandson that can perform tiny miracles by just a series of unnecessary moves and then technically performing one only to lead up to another tiny miracle. He sounds like a 1980s microphone. According to Uncle Grandpa, he is his trusty robot helper buddy. He can be summoned by a person saying something that includes the words \"tiny miracle\" in it and then the task he/she is attempting. His catchphrase is \"Did somebody say \"tiny miracle\"?\"\n* Beary Nice (voiced by Audie Harrison) and Hot Dog Person (voiced by [[Eric Bauza]])&nbsp;\u2013 These two are the stars of their own recurring segment, \"New Experiences\". Beary is an anthropomorphic teddy bear with a red nose and a bow tie and Hot Dog Person is an anthropomorphic cyborg [[Hot dog|frankfurter]] with a face.

Browngardt, who grew up the youngest in a large family of eight children (his eldest brother Tom would go on to work as the show's film editor), based the character upon the various and often eccentric relatives who would often drop by and visit them, as well as aspects of his own personality. The style of the show was inspired by his love of comics and [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]]. The pilot was produced in 2008, then aired online in 2009 on Cartoon Network Video as part of ''[[The Cartoonstitute]]''.<ref name=\"cartoonbrew1\">{{cite web|last=Amidi |first=Amid |url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/tv/uncle-grandpa-by-peter-browngardt-24524.html |title=Uncle Grandpa by Peter Browngardt |publisher=[[Cartoon Brew]] |date=June 15, 2010 |accessdate=August 8, 2013}}</ref> Akin to the ''[[Regular Show]]'' pilot, the ''Uncle Grandpa'' pilot was successful, but it had yet to have been [[Green-light|green-lit]] into its own series.<ref name=\"cartoonbrew1\"/>\n\nIn 2011, the TV series ''[[Secret Mountain Fort Awesome]]'' (based on the creatures that appear in the original short) aired on [[Cartoon Network]], but was not as well-received as the other ''Cartoon Network'' series at the time, and was eventually put on hiatus in February 2012.<ref name=\"cartoonbrew2\">{{cite web|last=Amidi|first=Amid|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/tv/secret-mountain-fort-awesome-talkback-50297.html|title=\"Secret Mountain Fort Awesome\" Talkback|publisher=[[Cartoon Brew]]|date=October 3, 2011|accessdate=August 8, 2013}}</ref> Despite the failure, ''Secret Mountain Fort Awesome'' went on to win several awards, including the coveted Crystal Award for \"Best Television Production\" at  [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival]], the first US-based production to do so.<ref name=\"cartoonbrew2\"/> This helped boost Browngardt's profile in getting ''Uncle Grandpa'' greenlit as a series.<ref name=\"cartoonbrew2\"/> Another factor that contributed to the launch of the show was the redesign of the character by [[John Kricfalusi]], ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]''{{'}}s creator.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/tv/john-k-draws-uncle-grandpa-76314.html|title=John K.

The children he visits have a problem of their own and Uncle Grandpa tries to help them through a series of chaotic and surreal misadventures. He is a clowny sort of person who sometimes eats inedible objects (paper, and mostly books). He drives/lives in a UG-2000 model robotic [[recreational vehicle|RV]] known as the Perpetual Persistence and is accompanied by a talking red [[fanny pack]] named Belly Bag, a green [[Stenonychosaurus|dinosauroid]] named Mr. Gus, a static photographic cutout of a [[tiger]] named Giant Realistic Flying Tiger, and an anthropomorphic pepperoni [[pizza]] slice named Pizza Steve.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Stack|[[File:Uncle Grandpa.png|thumb|Main characters from the series; from left to right: Uncle Grandpa and Belly Bag, Pizza Steve, Mr. Gus and Giant Realistic Flying Tiger (bottom)]]|float=right}}\n{{main|List of Secret Mountain Fort Awesome and Uncle Grandpa characters}}\n===Main===\n* Uncle Grandpa (voiced by [[Peter Browngardt]], [[Pendleton Ward]] in \"For Pete! Love, Pen\"). Uncle \"Larry\" Grandpa is a magical shapeshifting humanoid who is the uncle-grandpa of everyone in the world with a large, rectangular head, a brown [[horseshoe moustache]], a pink nose, a [[Beanie (seamed cap)#Propeller beanie|propeller hat]] that talks and an outfit consisting of a white T-shirt, [[lederhosen]] with rainbow [[suspenders]], knee high [[tube sock]]s, and black slippers. His outward appearance is depicted as rather clownish and unsophisticated, but he is well-meaning, fun-loving, supportive, and surprisingly competent when need be. His catchphrase is \"Good morning!\"\n* Belly Bag (voiced by [[Eric Bauza]])&nbsp;\u2212 Uncle Grandpa's talking red fanny pack nephew and best friend who carries all of his priceless valuables, especially Uncle Grandpa's weapon of choice, which is his UG-series robotic laser hammer daughter named Samantha Grandpa. Belly Bag's insides contain many weird objects and dimensions, including a castle where Frankenstein lives. Despite being practically attached to Uncle Grandpa, he has the ability to walk and can produce multiple hands from inside his body. He even has the ability to see despite having no visible eyes. In the second Uncle Grandpa short \"Secret Mountain Uncle Grandpa\", he is referred to as Fanny Pack and voiced by [[Paul Rugg]]. His catchphrase is \"What's cookin', good-lookin'?\"\n*Mr. Gus (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]) \u2212 Michael Marshal Breakfast Gusford, Jr., currently better known as Mr. Gus, is usually the voice of reason. He is a large, serious, yet somewhat grouchy green dinosaur (Reptoid) who was Uncle Grandpa's rival in \"Leg Wrestler\", but eventually became his friend and bodyguard. He is unfazed by most of Uncle Grandpa's eccentricities and seems to have an even temper despite his roommates, but often loses his temper, especially where Pizza Steve's antics are concerned. He's older, and more mature than Uncle Grandpa. One of Mr. Gus' favorite parts of the day is 9:00 PM, which is his designated bathroom time, and during that period he likes to take a bubble bath and read for an hour. His catchphrase is \"You're just sayin' that to get under my skin.\"\n* Pizza Steve (voiced by [[Adam DeVine]], [[Pendleton Ward]] in 'For Pete! Love, Pen')&nbsp;\u2212 Pizza J. Stevens, currently better known as Pizza Steve, is an anthropomorphic pepperoni pizza slice with sunglasses and a member of Uncle Grandpa's crew. He is depicted as extremely vain, troublesome, and often brags about how cool and awesome he is, which annoys his friend Mr. Gus. Despite this, he pretends to be very popular and a hit with women. He is a good friend of Uncle Grandpa. Pizza Steve is featured in his own cartoon shorts entitled \"A Slice of Life with Pizza Steve\", which usually involve Pizza Steve exaggerating his abilities. In \"Tiger Trails\", he claims to be a black belt in Italian Karate, but he wears the black belt over his eyes instead of around his waist. He also is meant to cheat, like for instance in \u201cLeg Wrestler\u201d, he trained Uncle Grandpa, and forced Mr. Gus to do his chores, so uncle Grandpa could Cream him. His catchphrase is \"I'm like a modern-day Thomas Einstein except a brazillion times better!\"\n* Giant Realistic Flying Tiger \u2212 A static photographic cutout of a [[tiger]] that Uncle Grandpa rides on to get around. Tiger is his pet and other best friend, and while she exhibits normal tiger traits such as only being able to communicate by roaring, she is able to fly and leaves a rainbow trail as she goes. The rainbow trail is also expelled from Tiger's rear end when she passes gas. Her personality is a cross between that of a stereotypical [[teenage]] girl, a house cat, and a real-life tiger. In order for Tiger's emotions to be shown, only certain parts of her body (specifically her facial ones) are animated. This is done in a stop-motion style.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Michael \"Tiny Miracle\" Grandpa, Jr. the Robot Boy (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]])&nbsp;\u2013 Uncle Grandpa's imaginary UG-series robot grandson that can perform tiny miracles by just a series of unnecessary moves and then technically performing one only to lead up to another tiny miracle. He sounds like a 1980s microphone. According to Uncle Grandpa, he is his trusty robot helper buddy. He can be summoned by a person saying something that includes the words \"tiny miracle\" in it and then the task he/she is attempting. His catchphrase is \"Did somebody say \"tiny miracle\"?\"\n* Beary Nice (voiced by Audie Harrison) and Hot Dog Person (voiced by [[Eric Bauza]])&nbsp;\u2013 These two are the stars of their own recurring segment, \"New Experiences\". Beary is an anthropomorphic teddy bear with a red nose and a bow tie and Hot Dog Person is an anthropomorphic cyborg [[Hot dog|frankfurter]] with a face. Beary has a positive outlook on life while Hot Dog Person is more gloomy. Each of their segments consist of the two of them trying something different for the first time (taking a bath, getting a haircut, etc.). Beary is always excited to try whatever they're doing, while Hot Dog Person is more reluctant as it seems every time he tries something new, something bad happens to him. Beary's excitement also leads to him being self-centered, as he is so wrapped up in his own emotions that he pays no attention to Hot Dog Person's plight.\n* Charlie Burgers the Ball-Loving Dog Next Door (voiced by [[Brian Posehn]])&nbsp;\u2013 A talking dog that befriends Uncle Grandpa and his friends. He can be well behaved and he enjoys going on adventures with Uncle Grandpa.

His catchphrase is \"Behold! I am Evil Wizard!\"\n* Little Priscilla-Aunt Jones-Grandma (voiced by [[Lena Headey]])&nbsp;\u2212 Uncle Grandpa's nemesis with a British accent and is the main [[antagonist]] of the series who wants revenge on him for ruining her science project and rather than help her played hacky sack instead resulting in her getting second place in the science fair.

Her catchphrase is \"Beautiful Morning!\"\n\n===Human children and adults===\n* Belly Kid (voiced by [[Zachary Gordon]])&nbsp;\u2013 A kid who has a big belly.

Adam appears in \"Brain Game\".\n* Angry Man Johnson (voiced by [[Roger Craig Smith]])&nbsp;\u2013 Angry Man Johnson is a grumpy old man who hates Charlie Burgers.

Unified into a [[Epirus (ancient state)|single state]] in 370 BC by the [[Aeacidae]] dynasty, Epirus achieved fame during the reign of [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]] who fought the [[Roman Republic]] in [[Pyrrhic War|a series of campaigns]]. Epirus subsequently became part of the Roman Republic along with the rest of Greece in 146 BC, which was followed by the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Eastern Roman Empire]].\n\nFollowing [[Fall of Constantinople|the fall]] of [[Constantinople]] to the [[Fourth Crusade]], Epirus became the center of the [[Despotate of Epirus]], one of the successor states to the Byzantine Empire. Conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 15th century, Epirus became semi-independent during the rule of [[Ali Pasha of Tepelena|Ali Pasha]] in the early 19th century, but the Ottomans re-asserted their control in 1821.

The island of [[Corfu]] is situated off the Epirote coast but is not regarded as part of Epirus.\n\nThe definition of Epirus has changed over time, such that modern administrative boundaries do not correspond to the boundaries of ancient Epirus. The [[Epirus (region)|region of Epirus]] in Greece only comprises a fraction of classical Epirus and does not include its easternmost portions, which lie in Thessaly. In Albania, where the concept of Epirus is never used in an official context, the counties of Gjirokast\u00ebr, [[Vlor\u00eb County|Vlor\u00eb]], and [[Berat County|Berat]] extend well beyond the northern and northeastern boundaries of classical Epirus.\n\n==Geography and ecology==\n[[File:Smolikas IMG 0118.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Smolikas|Mount Smolikas]] (2637m/8652f), the highest point in Epirus.]]\n[[File:Zagori Vikos gorge Oxia towards Vikos.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Vikos Gorge]] in [[Vikos\u2013Ao\u00f6s National Park]].]]\n\nEpirus is a predominantly rugged and mountainous region.

The ridges of the Pindus are parallel to the sea and generally so steep that the valleys between them are mostly suitable for pasture rather than large-scale agriculture.<ref name=Britannica/> Altitude increases as one moves east, away from the coast, reaching a maximum of 2,637&nbsp;m at [[Smolikas|Mount Smolikas]], the highest point in Epirus. Other important ranges include [[Tymfi]] (2,496&nbsp;m at Mount Gamila), [[Lygkos]] (2,249&nbsp;m), to the west and east of Smolikas respectively, [[Gramos]] (2,523&nbsp;m) in the northeast, Tzoumerka (2,356&nbsp;m) in the southeast, Tomaros (1,976&nbsp;m) in the southwest, [[Mitsikeli]] near [[Ioannina]] (1,810&nbsp;m), [[Mourgana]] (1,806&nbsp;m) and [[Nemercke|Nemercke/Aeoropos]] (2,485&nbsp;m) on the border between Greece and Albania, and the [[Ceraunian Mountains]] (2,000&nbsp;m) near [[Himara]] in Albania. Most of Epirus lies on the windward side of the Pindus, and the prevailing winds from the Ionian Sea make the region the rainiest in mainland Greece.<ref name=Britannica/>\n\nSignificant lowlands are to be found only near the coast, in the southwest near [[Arta, Greece|Arta]] and [[Preveza]], in the Acheron plain between [[Paramythia]] and [[Fanari, Preveza|Fanari]], between [[Igoumenitsa]] and [[Sagiada]], and also near [[Saranda]]. The [[Zagori]] area is a scenic upland plateau surrounded by mountain on all sides.\n\nThe main river flowing through Epirus is the [[Vjos\u00eb]] (''Ao\u00f6s'' in Greek), which flows in a northwesterly direction from the Pindus mountains in Greece to its mouth north of the [[Bay of Vlor\u00eb]] in Albania. Other important rivers include the [[Acheron|Acheron river]], famous for its religious significance in ancient Greece and site of the [[Necromanteion]], the [[Arachthos river]], crossed by the historic [[Bridge of Arta]], the [[Louros (river)|Louros]], the [[Thyamis]] or Kalamas, and the Voidomatis, a tributary of the Vjos\u00eb flowing through the [[Vikos Gorge]]. The Vikos Gorge, one of the deepest in the world, forms the centerpiece of the [[Vikos\u2013Ao\u00f6s National Park]], known for its scenic beauty. The only significant lake in Epirus is [[Lake Pamvotis]], on whose shores lies the city of [[Ioannina]], the region's largest and traditionally most important city.\n\nThe climate of Epirus is [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] along the coast and [[Alpine climate|Alpine]] in the interior. Epirus is heavily forested, mainly by coniferous species. The fauna in Epirus is especially rich and features species such as [[bear]]s, [[wolf|wolves]], [[fox]]es, [[deer]] and [[lynx]]es.\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\n[[File:Proto Greek Area reconstruction.png|thumb|left|200px|Epirus was part of the [[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]] area according to linguist [[Vladimir I.

The linguistic analysis of the toponyms reveals that they date mostly to the early wave of Slavic settlement at the turn of the 6th/7th centuries. Due to scarcity of textual evidence, it is unclear how much the area was affected by the second wave of Slavic migration, which began in the middle of the 8th century due to [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgar]] pressure in the northern Balkans.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|pp=51\u201352}}\n\nAs in eastern Greece, the restoration of Byzantine rule seems to have proceeded from the islands, chiefly Cephallonia, which was certainly under firm control in ca. 702, when [[Philippicus Bardanes]] was banished there.

The sovereignty of Greece over Crete was now recognised, but her ambition to annex Northern Epirus with its large Greek population was stopped by the annexation of the area to an independent Albania.\"}}\n\nThis outcome was unpopular among local Greeks, as a substantial Greek population existed on the Albanian side of the border.<ref>{{harvnb|Pettifer|2001|p=4}}.</ref> Among Greeks, [[northern Epirus]] was henceforth regarded as ''[[irredentism|terra irredenta]]''.<ref name=\"Konidaris\">{{harvnb|Konidaris|2005|pp=64\u201392}}.</ref> Local Greeks in northern Epirus revolted, declared [[Northern Epirote Declaration of Independence|their independence]] and proclaimed the [[Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus]] in February 1914.{{sfn|Winnifrith|2002|p=130}} After fierce guerrilla fighting, they managed to gain full autonomy under the terms of the [[Protocol of Corfu]], signed by Albanian and Northern Epirote representatives and approved by the Great Powers.

In 1924, the area was again ceded to Albania.<ref name=\"Miller\">{{harvnb|Miller|1966|pp=543\u2013544}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1939, Italy [[Italian invasion of Albania|occupied Albania]], and in 1940 [[Greco-Italian War|invaded Greece]]. The Italians were driven back into Albania, however, and Greek forces again took control of northern Epirus. The conflict marked the first tactical victory of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in [[World War II]]. [[Benito Mussolini]] himself supervised the massive counter-attack of his divisions in spring 1941, only to be decisively defeated again by the poorly equipped, but determined, Greeks. [[Nazi Germany]] then [[Battle of Greece|intervened]] in April 1941 to avert an embarrassing, wholesale Italian defeat. The German military performed rapid military maneuvers through [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and forced the encircled Greek forces of the Epirus front to surrender.\n\nThe whole of Epirus was then placed under Italian [[Axis Occupation of Greece|occupation]] until 1943, when the Germans took over following the [[Italian armistice|Italian surrender]] to the Allies. Due to the extensive activity of the anti-Nazi Greek resistance (mainly under [[EDES]]), the Germans carried out large scaled anti-partisan sweeps, making wide use of [[Axis-Cham Albanian collaboration|Nazi-collaborationist bands]] of [[Cham Albanians]], who committed numerous atrocities against the civilian population.{{sfn|Ruches|1965|pp=162\u2013167}}\n\nTo deal with the situation, the Allied Military Mission in the Axis-occupied Greece (under Colonel C. M. Woodhouse), gave EDES partisans direct orders to counter-attack and chase out of their villages those units that used them as bases and local strongholds. Helped by Allied war material transferred from the recently liberated southern Italy, EDES forces succeeded and as a result several thousands of Muslim [[Cham Albanians]] fled the area and took refuge in nearby Albania.\n\nWith the liberation of Greece and the start of the first round of the [[Greek Civil War]] at the end of 1944, the highlands of Epirus became a major theater of guerrilla warfare between the leftist [[Greek People's Liberation Army]] (ELAS) and the right-wing [[National Republican Greek League]] (EDES). In subsequent years (1945\u20131949), the mountains of Epirus also became the scene of some of the fiercest fighting of the second and bloodier round of the Greek Civil War. The final episode of the war took place on [[Gramos|Mount Grammos]] in 1949, ending with the defeat of the Communists. Peace returned to the region in 1949, although because of official Albanian active involvement in the civil war on the side of the communists, the formal state of war between Greece and Albania remained in effect until 1987. Another reason for the continuation of the state of war until 1987 was that during the entire period of Communist rule in Albania, the Greek population of [[Northern Epirus]] experienced forced [[Albanisation]].{{sfn|Pettifer|2001|p=7}} Although a Greek minority was recognized by the Hoxha regime, this recognition only applied to an \"official minority zone\" consisting of 99 villages, leaving out important areas of Greek settlement, such as [[Himara]].<ref name=\"Konidaris\"/> People outside the official minority zone received no education in the Greek language, which was prohibited in public.<ref name=\"Konidaris\"/> The Hoxha regime also diluted the ethnic demographics of the region by relocating Greeks living there and settling in their stead Albanians from other parts of the country.<ref name=\"Konidaris\"/> Relations began to improve in the 1980s with Greece's abandonment of any territorial claims over Northern Epirus and the lifting of the official state of war between the two countries.<ref name=\"Konidaris\"/>\n\nThe collapse of the communist regime in Albania in 1990\u20131991 triggered a massive migration of Albanian citizens to Greece, which included many members of the Greek minority. Since the end of the [[Cold War]], many Greeks in Northern Epirus are re-discovering their Greek heritage thanks to the opening of Greek schools in the region, while Cham Albanians have called for compensation for their lost property. In the post-Cold War era, relations have continued to improve though tensions remain over the availability of education in the Greek language outside the official minority zone, the minority's property rights, and occasional violent incidents targeting members of the Greek minority.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:New port of igoumenitsa.JPG|thumb|right|225px|[[Igoumenitsa]] is the main port in Epirus, and links the region to [[Italy]].]]\nA rugged topography, poor soils, and fragmented landholdings have kept agricultural production low and have resulted in a low population density.<ref name=Britannica/> Animal husbandry is the main industry and corn the chief crop.<ref name=Britannica/> Oranges and olives are grown in the western lowlands, while tobacco is grown around Ioannina.<ref name=Britannica/> Epirus has few natural resources and industries, and the population has been depleted by migration.<ref name=Britannica/> The population is centered around Ioannina, which has the largest number of industrial establishments.<ref name=Britannica/>\n\n==Transportation==\nEpirus has historically been a remote and isolated region due to its location between the Pindus mountains and the sea. In antiquity, the Roman [[Via Egnatia]] passed through [[Epirus Nova]], which linked Byzantium and Thessalonica to [[Dyrrachium]] on the [[Adriatic Sea]]. The modern [[Egnatia Odos (modern road)|Egnatia highway]], which links [[Ioannina]] to the Greek province of Macedonia and terminating at [[Igoumenitsa]], is the only highway through the Pindus mountains and has served to greatly reduce the region's isolation from the east, while the [[Ionia Odos|Ionia highway]], connecting Epirus with [[Western Greece]], helped reducing the region's isolation from the south. Also, the [[Aktio-Preveza Undersea Tunnel]] connects the southernmost tip of Epirus, near [[Preveza]], with [[Aetolia-Acarnania]] in western Greece. Ferry services from [[Igoumenitsa]] to the [[Ionian islands]] and [[Italy]] exist. The only airport in Epirus is the [[Ioannina National Airport]], while the [[Aktion National Airport]] is located just south of Preveza in [[Aetolia-Acarnania]]. There are no railroads in Epirus.\n\n==Gallery==\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:Br\u00fccke Arta.jpg|The [[Bridge of Arta]].\nFile:Aetomilitsa-Densko.jpg|The village of Aetomilitsa on Mount [[Gramos]], in the [[Pindus mountains]].\nFile:Vikos river, Epirus, Greece.jpg|The Vikos river, [[Vikos\u2013Ao\u00f6s National Park]].\nFile:Vikos Gorge from Beloe.jpg|The [[Vikos Gorge]].\nFile:120 2821-Aoos-Onno-Zweers.jpg|The old bridge of [[Konitsa]] over the [[Vjose|Aoos]] river.\nFile:Zagori Dragonlake and Gamila summit.jpg|The high altitude [[Lake Drakolimni]] (Dragon Lake), on Mount Gamila in the [[Pindus mountains]].\nFile:Acherons utspr\u00e5ng, Grekland.JPG|A canyon of the [[Acheron]] river.\nFile:Sirrako Village in Epirus, Greece.jpg|The village of [[Sirako]].\nFile:Nicopolis LR wall.jpg|The walls of ancient [[Nicopolis]].\nFile:Dodona Theatre 1.jpg|The Hellenistic theater of [[Dodona]].\nFile:Sheep in shadow, Konitsa, Ioannina prefecture, Greece.jpg|Sheep under the shade of a tree near [[Konitsa]].\nFile:BaiedeParga.jpg|The bay of [[Parga]].\nFile:ALB 20070718 img 1368.jpg|The region of [[Himara]] seen from the Llogara pass.\nFile:07Vjosa02.jpg|The [[Ao\u00f6s]] or [[Vjosa]] river near [[Tepelena]].\nFile:A2 Motorway, Greece - Section Paramythia-Igoumenitsa - 16.jpg|Section of the [[Egnatia Odos (modern road)|Egnatia Odos]], the only freeway in Epirus, near [[Igoumenitsa]].\nFile:Gjirokastra01.jpg|[[Gjirokaster]], a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].\nFile:Preveza Greece from above dsc06080.jpg|[[Preveza]] seen from the air.\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of cities in ancient Epirus]]\n*[[List of Epirotes]]\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin|2}}\n*{{cite book | last=Anson | first=Edward M. | chapter=Why Study Ancient Macedonia and What This Companion is About | editor-last1=Roisman | editor-first1=Joseph | editor-last2=Worthington | editor-first2=Ian | title=A Companion to Ancient Macedonia | pages=3\u201320 | location=Oxford, Chichester, & Malden | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | year=2010 | isbn=978-1-4051-7936-2| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lkYFVJ3U-BIC | ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book | last=Antoniadis | first=Vyron | year=2016 | title=Tabula Imperii Romani : J 34 - Athens : Epirus | location=Athens | publisher=Academy of Athens | isbn=978-960-404-308-8 | url=https://books.google.gr/books/about/Tabula_Imperii_Romani.html?id=S99NvgAACAAJ&redir_esc=y | ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book | last=Babiniotis | first=Georgios | title=Lexiko tis Neas Ellinikis Glossas | location=Athens, Greece | publisher=Kentro Lexikologias | year=1998 | isbn=960-86190-0-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L7j7YQEACAAJ | ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book | last1=Bahr | first1=Lauren S. | last2=Johnston | first2=Bernard | last3=Bloomfield | first3=Louise A. | title=Collier's Encyclopedia | volume=11 | location=New York, NY | publisher=Collier | year=1997 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0EgUAQAAIAAJ | ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book | last=Blumi | first=Isa | chapter=The Role of Education in the Albanian Identity and its Myths | pages=49\u201359 | editor-last1=Schwandner-Sievers | editor-first1=Stephanie | editor-last2=Fischer | editor-first2=Bernd J\u00fcrgen | title=Albanian Identities: Myth and History | location=Bloomington, IN | publisher=Indiana University Press | year=2002 | isbn=0-253-21570-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RnDeHFOX8yIC | ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book | last=Borza | first=Eugene N. | title=In the Shadow of Olympus: The Emergence of Macedon (Revised Edition) | location=Princeton, NJ | publisher=Princeton University Press | year=1992 | isbn=0-691-00880-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=614pd07OtfQC | ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book | last=Bowden | first=William | title=Epirus Vetus: The Archaeology of a Late Antique Province | year=2003 | location=London | publisher= Gerald Duckworth & Co.

The largest city in Epirus is [[Ioannina]], seat of the region of Epirus, with [[Gjirokast\u00ebr]] the largest city in the Albanian part of Epirus.<ref name=Britannica/>\n\nA rugged and mountainous region, Epirus was the north-west area of [[ancient Greece]].<ref name=\"OCD527\"/> It was inhabited by the Greek tribes of the [[Chaonians]], [[Molossians]], and [[Thesprotians]], and home to the sanctuary of [[Dodona]], the oldest ancient Greek [[oracle]], and the most prestigious one after [[Delphi]]. Unified into a [[Epirus (ancient state)|single state]] in 370 BC by the [[Aeacidae]] dynasty, Epirus achieved fame during the reign of [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]] who fought the [[Roman Republic]] in [[Pyrrhic War|a series of campaigns]]. Epirus subsequently became part of the Roman Republic along with the rest of Greece in 146 BC, which was followed by the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Eastern Roman Empire]].\n\nFollowing [[Fall of Constantinople|the fall]] of [[Constantinople]] to the [[Fourth Crusade]], Epirus became the center of the [[Despotate of Epirus]], one of the successor states to the Byzantine Empire. Conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 15th century, Epirus became semi-independent during the rule of [[Ali Pasha of Tepelena|Ali Pasha]] in the early 19th century, but the Ottomans re-asserted their control in 1821. Following the [[Balkan Wars]] and [[World War I]], southern Epirus became part of [[Greece]], while [[northern Epirus]] became part of [[Albania]].\n\n==Name and etymology==\n[[File:Epirus234bc.jpg|thumb|right|Coin of the Epirote League, depicting Zeus (left) and a lightning bolt with the word \"\u0391\u03a0\u0395\u0399\u03a1\u03a9\u03a4\u0391\u039d\" \u2013 of the Epirotes (right).]]\nThe name ''Epirus'' is derived from the {{lang-el|\u1f2c\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2|translit=\u1e16peiros}} ({{lang-grc-dor|\u1f0c\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2|translit=\u00c1peiros}}), meaning \"mainland\" or ''[[wikt:terra firma|terra firma]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Liddell|Scott|1940|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2347463 \u1f24\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1-\u03bf\u03c2]}}.</ref> It is thought to come from an [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root ''<nowiki>*</nowiki>apero-'' 'coast',<ref>{{harvnb|Babiniotis|1998}}.</ref> and was originally applied to the mainland opposite [[Corfu]] and the [[Ionian islands]].<ref>{{harvnb|Winnifrith|2002|p=22}}.</ref> The local name was struck on the coinage of the [[Epirote League|unified Epirote commonwealth]]: \"\u0391\u03a0\u0395\u0399\u03a1\u03a9\u03a4\u0391\u039d\" ({{lang-grc|\u1f08\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u1fb6\u03bd|translit=\u0100peir\u014dt\u00e2n}}, {{lang-grc-x-attic|\u1f28\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd|translit=\u0112peir\u014dt\u00f4n}}, i.e. \"of the Epirotes\", see image right).

The island of [[Corfu]] is situated off the Epirote coast but is not regarded as part of Epirus.\n\nThe definition of Epirus has changed over time, such that modern administrative boundaries do not correspond to the boundaries of ancient Epirus. The [[Epirus (region)|region of Epirus]] in Greece only comprises a fraction of classical Epirus and does not include its easternmost portions, which lie in Thessaly. In Albania, where the concept of Epirus is never used in an official context, the counties of Gjirokast\u00ebr, [[Vlor\u00eb County|Vlor\u00eb]], and [[Berat County|Berat]] extend well beyond the northern and northeastern boundaries of classical Epirus.\n\n==Geography and ecology==\n[[File:Smolikas IMG 0118.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Smolikas|Mount Smolikas]] (2637m/8652f), the highest point in Epirus.]]\n[[File:Zagori Vikos gorge Oxia towards Vikos.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Vikos Gorge]] in [[Vikos\u2013Ao\u00f6s National Park]].]]\n\nEpirus is a predominantly rugged and mountainous region.

The ridges of the Pindus are parallel to the sea and generally so steep that the valleys between them are mostly suitable for pasture rather than large-scale agriculture.<ref name=Britannica/> Altitude increases as one moves east, away from the coast, reaching a maximum of 2,637&nbsp;m at [[Smolikas|Mount Smolikas]], the highest point in Epirus. Other important ranges include [[Tymfi]] (2,496&nbsp;m at Mount Gamila), [[Lygkos]] (2,249&nbsp;m), to the west and east of Smolikas respectively, [[Gramos]] (2,523&nbsp;m) in the northeast, Tzoumerka (2,356&nbsp;m) in the southeast, Tomaros (1,976&nbsp;m) in the southwest, [[Mitsikeli]] near [[Ioannina]] (1,810&nbsp;m), [[Mourgana]] (1,806&nbsp;m) and [[Nemercke|Nemercke/Aeoropos]] (2,485&nbsp;m) on the border between Greece and Albania, and the [[Ceraunian Mountains]] (2,000&nbsp;m) near [[Himara]] in Albania. Most of Epirus lies on the windward side of the Pindus, and the prevailing winds from the Ionian Sea make the region the rainiest in mainland Greece.<ref name=Britannica/>\n\nSignificant lowlands are to be found only near the coast, in the southwest near [[Arta, Greece|Arta]] and [[Preveza]], in the Acheron plain between [[Paramythia]] and [[Fanari, Preveza|Fanari]], between [[Igoumenitsa]] and [[Sagiada]], and also near [[Saranda]]. The [[Zagori]] area is a scenic upland plateau surrounded by mountain on all sides.\n\nThe main river flowing through Epirus is the [[Vjos\u00eb]] (''Ao\u00f6s'' in Greek), which flows in a northwesterly direction from the Pindus mountains in Greece to its mouth north of the [[Bay of Vlor\u00eb]] in Albania. Other important rivers include the [[Acheron|Acheron river]], famous for its religious significance in ancient Greece and site of the [[Necromanteion]], the [[Arachthos river]], crossed by the historic [[Bridge of Arta]], the [[Louros (river)|Louros]], the [[Thyamis]] or Kalamas, and the Voidomatis, a tributary of the Vjos\u00eb flowing through the [[Vikos Gorge]]. The Vikos Gorge, one of the deepest in the world, forms the centerpiece of the [[Vikos\u2013Ao\u00f6s National Park]], known for its scenic beauty. The only significant lake in Epirus is [[Lake Pamvotis]], on whose shores lies the city of [[Ioannina]], the region's largest and traditionally most important city.\n\nThe climate of Epirus is [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] along the coast and [[Alpine climate|Alpine]] in the interior. Epirus is heavily forested, mainly by coniferous species. The fauna in Epirus is especially rich and features species such as [[bear]]s, [[wolf|wolves]], [[fox]]es, [[deer]] and [[lynx]]es.\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\n[[File:Proto Greek Area reconstruction.png|thumb|left|200px|Epirus was part of the [[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]] area according to linguist [[Vladimir I.

Although this territory was not traditionally part of Epirus proper as defined by the ancient geographers, and was historically inhabited predominantly by Illyrian tribes, the name reflects the fact that under Roman rule, the area had been subject to increasing Hellenization and settlement by Epirote tribes from the south.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=47}}\n\nThe two Epirote provinces became part of the [[Diocese of Moesia]], until it was divided in ca. 369 into the dioceses of [[Diocese of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Diocese of Dacia|Dacia]], when they became part of the former.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|pp=47\u201348}} In the 4th century, Epirus was still a stronghold of [[paganism]], and was aided by Emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] (r. 361\u2013363) and his [[praetorian prefect]] [[Claudius Mamertinus]] through reduction in taxes and the rebuilding of the provincial capital, [[Nicopolis]].{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=48}} According to [[Jordanes]], in 380 the [[Visigoths]] raided the area.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=48}} With the division of the Empire on the death of [[Theodosius I]] in 395, Epirus became part of the Eastern Roman or [[Byzantine Empire]].{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=48}} In 395\u2013397, the Visigoths under [[Alaric I|Alaric]] plundered Greece.

With the exception of some few toponyms on Corfu, the Ionian Islands seem to not have been affected. The linguistic analysis of the toponyms reveals that they date mostly to the early wave of Slavic settlement at the turn of the 6th/7th centuries. Due to scarcity of textual evidence, it is unclear how much the area was affected by the second wave of Slavic migration, which began in the middle of the 8th century due to [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgar]] pressure in the northern Balkans.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|pp=51\u201352}}\n\nAs in eastern Greece, the restoration of Byzantine rule seems to have proceeded from the islands, chiefly Cephallonia, which was certainly under firm control in ca. 702, when [[Philippicus Bardanes]] was banished there. The gradual restoration of imperial rule is evidenced further from the participation of local bishops in councils in [[Constantinople]]: whereas only the bishop of Dyrrhachium participated in the Ecumenical Councils of [[Third Council of Constantinople|680/1]] and [[Quinisext Council|692]], a century later the bishops of Dyrrhachium, Nicopolis, Corfu, Cephallonia, and Zakynthos are attested in the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=52}} In about the middle of the 8th century, the [[Theme of Cephallenia]] was established, but at least initially it was more oriented towards restoring Byzantine control over the Ionian and Adriatic seas, combating Saracen piracy, and securing communications with the remaining Byzantine possessions in Italy, rather than any systematic effort at subduing the Epirote mainland.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=52}} Nevertheless, following the onset of the [[Muslim conquest of Sicily]] in 827, the Ionian became particularly exposed to Arab raids.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=53}}\n\n[[File:Byzantine Greece ca 900 AD.svg|thumb|right|200 px|Map of [[Byzantine Greece]] ca. 900 AD, with the themes and major settlements]]\nThe 9th century, however, saw great progress in the restoration of imperial control in the mainland, as evidenced by the participation of the bishops of Ioannina, [[Naupaktos]], Hadrianopolis, and Vagenetia (evidently by now organized as a ''[[Sklavinia]]'' under imperial rule) in the Ecumenical Councils of [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Roman Catholic)|869/70]] and [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Eastern Orthodox)|879/80]].{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=53}} The Byzantine recovery resulted in an influx of Greeks from southern Italy and [[Asia Minor]] into the Greek interior, while remaining Slavs were Christianized and [[Hellenization|Hellenized]].<ref name=\"Fine1991\">{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=64}}.</ref> The success of the Hellenization campaign also suggests continuity of the original Greek population and that the Slavs had settled among many Greeks, in contrast to areas further north in what is now Bulgaria and the former Yugoslavia, as those areas could not be Hellenized when they were recovered by the Byzantines in the early 11th century.<ref name=\"Fine1991\"/> Following the [[Battle of Cephalonia|great naval victory]] of admiral [[Nasar]] in 880, and the beginning of the Byzantine offensive against the Arabs in southern Italy in the 880s, the situation improved and the [[Theme of Nicopolis]] was established, most likely after 886.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=53}}{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|p=1485}} As the ancient capital of Epirus had been laid waste by the Slavs, the capital of the new theme became Naupaktos further south.

Vagenetia notably no longer appears as a bishopric.

During this period, the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] managed to shut down the few Albanian schools, considering teaching in Albanian a factor that would diminish its influence and lead to the creation of separate Albanian church, while publications in Albanian were banned by the Ottoman Empire.{{sfn|Jelavich|Jelavich|1977|p=226}}<ref name=\"Ramet1998\">{{harvnb|Ramet|1998|p=205}}.</ref> In the late 19th century, the Kingdom of Italy opened various schools in the regions of [[Ioannina]] and [[Preveza]] in order to influence the local population. These schools began to attract students from the Greek language schools, but were ultimately closed after intervention and harassment by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople.{{sfn|Blumi|2002|p=57}} Throughout, the late period of Ottoman rule (from the 18th century) Greek and Aromanian population of the region suffered from Albanians raiders, that sporadically continued after Ali Pasha's death, until 1912\u20131913.{{sfn|Hammond|1976|loc=p. 41: \"Throughout this period bands of Albanians raiders pillaged and destroyed the villages of the Vlachs and the Greeks in Epirus, northern Pindus, the lakeland of Prespa and Ochrid, and parts of western Macedonia. One Albanian leader, 'Ali the Lion', emulated the achievements of 'John the Sword' and 'Peter the Pockmark' when he established himself as Ali Pasha, independent ruler of Ioannina. He and his Albanian soldiers, recruited mainly from his homeland in the Kurvelesh and the Drin valley of North Epirus, controlled the whole of Epirus and carried their raids far into western Macedonia and Thessaly. As we have seen, they destroyed the Vlach settlements in the lakeland and weakened those farther south. After the assassination of Ali Pasha in 1822 sporadic raids by bands of Albanians were a feature of life in northern Greece until the liberation of 1912\u201313.\"}}\n\n===20th-century Epirus===\n[[File:Epirote women Aug1914.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Detachment of armed Epirote women in the [[Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus]].]]\n\nWhile the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)]] awarded large parts of Epirus to Greece, opposition by the Ottomans and the [[League of Prizren]] resulted in only the region of [[Arta (regional unit)|Arta]] being ceded to Greece in 1881.<ref name=\"Gawrych2006\">{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=68\u201369}}.</ref> It was only following the [[First Balkan War]] of 1912\u20131913 and the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] that the rest of southern Epirus, including [[Ioannina]], was incorporated into Greece.<ref>{{harvnb|Clogg|2002|p=105}}: \"In February 1913 the Greek Army seized Ioannina, the capital of Epirus.

The sovereignty of Greece over Crete was now recognised, but her ambition to annex Northern Epirus with its large Greek population was stopped by the annexation of the area to an independent Albania.\"}}\n\nThis outcome was unpopular among local Greeks, as a substantial Greek population existed on the Albanian side of the border.<ref>{{harvnb|Pettifer|2001|p=4}}.</ref> Among Greeks, [[northern Epirus]] was henceforth regarded as ''[[irredentism|terra irredenta]]''.<ref name=\"Konidaris\">{{harvnb|Konidaris|2005|pp=64\u201392}}.</ref> Local Greeks in northern Epirus revolted, declared [[Northern Epirote Declaration of Independence|their independence]] and proclaimed the [[Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus]] in February 1914.{{sfn|Winnifrith|2002|p=130}} After fierce guerrilla fighting, they managed to gain full autonomy under the terms of the [[Protocol of Corfu]], signed by Albanian and Northern Epirote representatives and approved by the Great Powers.

In 1924, the area was again ceded to Albania.<ref name=\"Miller\">{{harvnb|Miller|1966|pp=543\u2013544}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1939, Italy [[Italian invasion of Albania|occupied Albania]], and in 1940 [[Greco-Italian War|invaded Greece]]. The Italians were driven back into Albania, however, and Greek forces again took control of northern Epirus. The conflict marked the first tactical victory of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in [[World War II]]. [[Benito Mussolini]] himself supervised the massive counter-attack of his divisions in spring 1941, only to be decisively defeated again by the poorly equipped, but determined, Greeks. [[Nazi Germany]] then [[Battle of Greece|intervened]] in April 1941 to avert an embarrassing, wholesale Italian defeat. The German military performed rapid military maneuvers through [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and forced the encircled Greek forces of the Epirus front to surrender.\n\nThe whole of Epirus was then placed under Italian [[Axis Occupation of Greece|occupation]] until 1943, when the Germans took over following the [[Italian armistice|Italian surrender]] to the Allies. Due to the extensive activity of the anti-Nazi Greek resistance (mainly under [[EDES]]), the Germans carried out large scaled anti-partisan sweeps, making wide use of [[Axis-Cham Albanian collaboration|Nazi-collaborationist bands]] of [[Cham Albanians]], who committed numerous atrocities against the civilian population.{{sfn|Ruches|1965|pp=162\u2013167}}\n\nTo deal with the situation, the Allied Military Mission in the Axis-occupied Greece (under Colonel C. M. Woodhouse), gave EDES partisans direct orders to counter-attack and chase out of their villages those units that used them as bases and local strongholds. Helped by Allied war material transferred from the recently liberated southern Italy, EDES forces succeeded and as a result several thousands of Muslim [[Cham Albanians]] fled the area and took refuge in nearby Albania.\n\nWith the liberation of Greece and the start of the first round of the [[Greek Civil War]] at the end of 1944, the highlands of Epirus became a major theater of guerrilla warfare between the leftist [[Greek People's Liberation Army]] (ELAS) and the right-wing [[National Republican Greek League]] (EDES). In subsequent years (1945\u20131949), the mountains of Epirus also became the scene of some of the fiercest fighting of the second and bloodier round of the Greek Civil War. The final episode of the war took place on [[Gramos|Mount Grammos]] in 1949, ending with the defeat of the Communists. Peace returned to the region in 1949, although because of official Albanian active involvement in the civil war on the side of the communists, the formal state of war between Greece and Albania remained in effect until 1987. Another reason for the continuation of the state of war until 1987 was that during the entire period of Communist rule in Albania, the Greek population of [[Northern Epirus]] experienced forced [[Albanisation]].{{sfn|Pettifer|2001|p=7}} Although a Greek minority was recognized by the Hoxha regime, this recognition only applied to an \"official minority zone\" consisting of 99 villages, leaving out important areas of Greek settlement, such as [[Himara]].<ref name=\"Konidaris\"/> People outside the official minority zone received no education in the Greek language, which was prohibited in public.<ref name=\"Konidaris\"/> The Hoxha regime also diluted the ethnic demographics of the region by relocating Greeks living there and settling in their stead Albanians from other parts of the country.<ref name=\"Konidaris\"/> Relations began to improve in the 1980s with Greece's abandonment of any territorial claims over Northern Epirus and the lifting of the official state of war between the two countries.<ref name=\"Konidaris\"/>\n\nThe collapse of the communist regime in Albania in 1990\u20131991 triggered a massive migration of Albanian citizens to Greece, which included many members of the Greek minority. Since the end of the [[Cold War]], many Greeks in Northern Epirus are re-discovering their Greek heritage thanks to the opening of Greek schools in the region, while Cham Albanians have called for compensation for their lost property. In the post-Cold War era, relations have continued to improve though tensions remain over the availability of education in the Greek language outside the official minority zone, the minority's property rights, and occasional violent incidents targeting members of the Greek minority.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:New port of igoumenitsa.JPG|thumb|right|225px|[[Igoumenitsa]] is the main port in Epirus, and links the region to [[Italy]].]]\nA rugged topography, poor soils, and fragmented landholdings have kept agricultural production low and have resulted in a low population density.<ref name=Britannica/> Animal husbandry is the main industry and corn the chief crop.<ref name=Britannica/> Oranges and olives are grown in the western lowlands, while tobacco is grown around Ioannina.<ref name=Britannica/> Epirus has few natural resources and industries, and the population has been depleted by migration.<ref name=Britannica/> The population is centered around Ioannina, which has the largest number of industrial establishments.<ref name=Britannica/>\n\n==Transportation==\nEpirus has historically been a remote and isolated region due to its location between the Pindus mountains and the sea. In antiquity, the Roman [[Via Egnatia]] passed through [[Epirus Nova]], which linked Byzantium and Thessalonica to [[Dyrrachium]] on the [[Adriatic Sea]]. The modern [[Egnatia Odos (modern road)|Egnatia highway]], which links [[Ioannina]] to the Greek province of Macedonia and terminating at [[Igoumenitsa]], is the only highway through the Pindus mountains and has served to greatly reduce the region's isolation from the east, while the [[Ionia Odos|Ionia highway]], connecting Epirus with [[Western Greece]], helped reducing the region's isolation from the south. Also, the [[Aktio-Preveza Undersea Tunnel]] connects the southernmost tip of Epirus, near [[Preveza]], with [[Aetolia-Acarnania]] in western Greece. Ferry services from [[Igoumenitsa]] to the [[Ionian islands]] and [[Italy]] exist. The only airport in Epirus is the [[Ioannina National Airport]], while the [[Aktion National Airport]] is located just south of Preveza in [[Aetolia-Acarnania]].

For since he was an incorporeal power, and the Nous (mind) of the unborn father, he transfigured himself as he pleased, and thus ascended to him who had sent him, deriding them, inasmuch as he could not be laid hold of, and was invisible to all\" ([http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103124.htm Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', book I, ch. 24, 4]).</ref>\n\n=== Gnosticism ===\nSome scriptures identified as Gnostic reject the atonement of Jesus' death by distinguishing the earthly body of Jesus and his divine and immaterial essence.

Their father was a pilot for [[Japan Airlines|JAL]] and due to his job, the family moved to [[Anchorage]], [[Alaska]] when Suguri was three.<ref name=JBM1999 /><ref name=ST041121 /> She is bilingual in Japanese and English.<ref name=ST041121 />\n\nSuguri graduated from [[Waseda University]]. She has a degree in social sciences.<ref name=ST041121 />\n\nIn November 2014, Suguri came out as bisexual.<ref>[http://cyclestyle.net/article/2016/07/16/38454.html \u6751\u4e3b\u7ae0\u679d\u3001\u30b8\u30a7\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u3067\u60a9\u307e\u306a\u3044\u793e\u4f1a\u3078\uff01\u300c\u65e5\u672c\u306f\u307e\u3060\u53b3\u3057\u3044\u300d\u300c\u50cd\u304d\u304b\u3051\u9811\u5f35\u308b\uff01\u300d] cyclestyle.net on July 16, 2016</ref>\n\n==Career==\nSuguri began skating at age 5 in Alaska. When she returned to Japan, she began formal training under coach [[Nobuo Sato]], a ten-time Japanese national champion.\n\nIn 1994, while visiting the practice rink for the [[1994 World Figure Skating Championships|1994 World Championships]], Suguri was taught the [[lutz jump|triple Lutz]] jump by [[Michelle Kwan]], who was competing in the event.\n\n=== 1996\u201397 to 2001\u201302 ===\nSuguri became Japan's national champion for the first time in 1997. Her second national title came in the 2000\u201301 season. She went on to win gold at the [[2001 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2001 Four Continents]], becoming the first Japanese woman to win the competition.\n\nIn 2001\u201302, Suguri won her third national title and competed at the [[2002 Winter Olympics]], where she placed 5th. A month later, she won the bronze medal at the [[2002 World Figure Skating Championships|2002 World Championships]] behind [[Michelle Kwan]] and [[Irina Slutskaya]]. Her bronze medal at Worlds was the first medal for a Japanese woman at the World Championships since [[Yuka Sato]] won the title in 1994.\n\n=== 2002\u201303 to 2005\u201306 ===\nIn the 2002\u201303 season, Suguri won her fourth national title. She was awarded gold at Four Continents and repeated as the bronze medalist at the World Championships, this time behind Kwan and [[Elena Sokolova]].\n\nIn 2003\u201304, Suguri won gold at the [[2003 NHK Trophy|NHK Trophy]] and bronze at [[2003 Cup of China|Cup of China]], thus qualifying for the [[2003\u201304 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|Grand Prix Final]]. She stood atop the podium at the Final after defeating [[Sasha Cohen]] to become the first Japanese woman to take gold at the competition. Suguri left Sato after the 2004 World Championships after she lost two competitions to [[Miki Ando]], who was also coached by Sato at the time. She moved to [[Chicago]] in the United States to train with [[Oleg Kimovich Vasiliev|Oleg Vasiliev]] in the autumn of 2004.<ref name=ST041121 />\n\nIn the 2004\u201305 season, Suguri placed fourth at both of her Grand Prix assignments. After placing third at the Japanese Championships, she won her [[2005 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|third Four Continents title]].  She finished fifth at the [[2005 World Figure Skating Championships|World Championships]]. After the Japan Skating Federation refused to let her continue working with Vasiliev, Suguri returned to Sato and soon after Ando left him.\n\nIn the 2005\u201306 season, Suguri won her fifth national title, competing against [[Mao Asada]] and [[Shizuka Arakawa]]. She placed fourth at the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] in [[Turin]], Italy, and concluded her season with a silver medal at the [[2006 World Figure Skating Championships|2006 World Championships]], having finished second to [[Kimmie Meissner]]. She became the first Japanese woman to earn three World Championship medals.\n\n=== 2006\u201307 to 2009\u201310 ===\nIn the 2006\u201307 season, Suguri finished fourth at the Japanese championships behind younger competitors [[Mao Asada]], [[Miki Ando]] and [[Yukari Nakano]], and missed a spot to the World Championships held in her home country. She competed at the Four Continents Championships but withdrew due to injury after falling on two jumps in her short program. At the end of the season, Suguri left Sato again as she felt overshadowed by Nakano, who was also training with Sato at the time.\n\nFor the 2007\u201308 season, Suguri decided to train in Russia with [[Alexander Zhulin]], who had choreographed her programs in the previous season. Due to Zhulin's marital problems, she had to spend most of her time with [[Igor Pashkevich]]. At the Japanese National Championships, Suguri placed third after her short program, but she stumbled in the free program, finishing fourth overall, and, again, she missed a spot on the World Championship team.\n\nDuring the 2008\u201309 season, Suguri chose to train with coach [[Nikolai Morozov (figure skater)|Nikolai Morozov]] in [[Hackensack, New Jersey]]. There, she was able to improve her jumping ability. Her first competition of the season was [[Skate Canada International|Skate Canada]] where she placed second behind [[Joannie Rochette]]. Her next competition was [[Cup of Russia]], where she led after the short program, then placed third in the free skate, and finished third, overall. At the 2008/2009 Japanese Championships she was 5th after the short program due to a fall on a triple flip. In her long program she landed five triples and scored 121.27 points, winning the long program and placing second overall behind Mao Asada. Suguri made the World team for the first time in three years. She placed 6th at the [[2009 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2009 Four Continents]] and 8th at the [[2009 World Figure Skating Championships|2009 World Championships]].\n\nSuguri left Morozov in the summer of 2009 to train with [[Alexei Mishin]] in Russia, saying she wanted to work on triple/triple combinations and the triple axel. Mishin neglected Suguri and she spent most of her time with Igor Pashkevich. She finished 7th at the 2010 Japanese National Championships.\n\n=== 2010\u201311 to present ===\nIn March 2011, Suguri stated that she would continue competing the next season, and possibly until 2014.<ref name=IN110310 /> She began working as a regular employee in the Sports Marketing Division at Sunny Side Up and gained a sponsorship at a medical company, Yoshindo.<ref name=SSU />\n\nSuguri was unsuccessful in her effort to reach the 2011\u201312 Japanese Nationals, finishing 12th in her qualifying competition. She was dealing with an ankle injury.<ref name=1112nats /> In 2016, she competed in her first adult skating event.<ref name=IN160707 />\n\n== Programs ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n!

She is a three-time [[World Figure Skating Championships|World]] medalist, a three-time [[Four Continents Championships|Four Continents]] champion, the 2003 [[Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|Grand Prix Final]] champion, and a five-time [[Japanese Figure Skating Championships|Japanese national]] champion.\n\n==Personal life==\nSuguri was born in [[Chiba, Chiba]], Japan.<ref name=\"ISU-1011\" /><ref name=sanspo /> Her younger sister, Chika, is also a figure skater. Their father was a pilot for [[Japan Airlines|JAL]] and due to his job, the family moved to [[Anchorage]], [[Alaska]] when Suguri was three.<ref name=JBM1999 /><ref name=ST041121 /> She is bilingual in Japanese and English.<ref name=ST041121 />\n\nSuguri graduated from [[Waseda University]]. She has a degree in social sciences.<ref name=ST041121 />\n\nIn November 2014, Suguri came out as bisexual.<ref>[http://cyclestyle.net/article/2016/07/16/38454.html \u6751\u4e3b\u7ae0\u679d\u3001\u30b8\u30a7\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u3067\u60a9\u307e\u306a\u3044\u793e\u4f1a\u3078\uff01\u300c\u65e5\u672c\u306f\u307e\u3060\u53b3\u3057\u3044\u300d\u300c\u50cd\u304d\u304b\u3051\u9811\u5f35\u308b\uff01\u300d] cyclestyle.net on July 16, 2016</ref>\n\n==Career==\nSuguri began skating at age 5 in Alaska. When she returned to Japan, she began formal training under coach [[Nobuo Sato]], a ten-time Japanese national champion.\n\nIn 1994, while visiting the practice rink for the [[1994 World Figure Skating Championships|1994 World Championships]], Suguri was taught the [[lutz jump|triple Lutz]] jump by [[Michelle Kwan]], who was competing in the event.\n\n=== 1996\u201397 to 2001\u201302 ===\nSuguri became Japan's national champion for the first time in 1997. Her second national title came in the 2000\u201301 season. She went on to win gold at the [[2001 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2001 Four Continents]], becoming the first Japanese woman to win the competition.\n\nIn 2001\u201302, Suguri won her third national title and competed at the [[2002 Winter Olympics]], where she placed 5th. A month later, she won the bronze medal at the [[2002 World Figure Skating Championships|2002 World Championships]] behind [[Michelle Kwan]] and [[Irina Slutskaya]]. Her bronze medal at Worlds was the first medal for a Japanese woman at the World Championships since [[Yuka Sato]] won the title in 1994.\n\n=== 2002\u201303 to 2005\u201306 ===\nIn the 2002\u201303 season, Suguri won her fourth national title. She was awarded gold at Four Continents and repeated as the bronze medalist at the World Championships, this time behind Kwan and [[Elena Sokolova]].\n\nIn 2003\u201304, Suguri won gold at the [[2003 NHK Trophy|NHK Trophy]] and bronze at [[2003 Cup of China|Cup of China]], thus qualifying for the [[2003\u201304 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|Grand Prix Final]]. She stood atop the podium at the Final after defeating [[Sasha Cohen]] to become the first Japanese woman to take gold at the competition. Suguri left Sato after the 2004 World Championships after she lost two competitions to [[Miki Ando]], who was also coached by Sato at the time. She moved to [[Chicago]] in the United States to train with [[Oleg Kimovich Vasiliev|Oleg Vasiliev]] in the autumn of 2004.<ref name=ST041121 />\n\nIn the 2004\u201305 season, Suguri placed fourth at both of her Grand Prix assignments. After placing third at the Japanese Championships, she won her [[2005 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|third Four Continents title]].  She finished fifth at the [[2005 World Figure Skating Championships|World Championships]]. After the Japan Skating Federation refused to let her continue working with Vasiliev, Suguri returned to Sato and soon after Ando left him.\n\nIn the 2005\u201306 season, Suguri won her fifth national title, competing against [[Mao Asada]] and [[Shizuka Arakawa]]. She placed fourth at the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] in [[Turin]], Italy, and concluded her season with a silver medal at the [[2006 World Figure Skating Championships|2006 World Championships]], having finished second to [[Kimmie Meissner]]. She became the first Japanese woman to earn three World Championship medals.\n\n=== 2006\u201307 to 2009\u201310 ===\nIn the 2006\u201307 season, Suguri finished fourth at the Japanese championships behind younger competitors [[Mao Asada]], [[Miki Ando]] and [[Yukari Nakano]], and missed a spot to the World Championships held in her home country. She competed at the Four Continents Championships but withdrew due to injury after falling on two jumps in her short program. At the end of the season, Suguri left Sato again as she felt overshadowed by Nakano, who was also training with Sato at the time.\n\nFor the 2007\u201308 season, Suguri decided to train in Russia with [[Alexander Zhulin]], who had choreographed her programs in the previous season. Due to Zhulin's marital problems, she had to spend most of her time with [[Igor Pashkevich]]. At the Japanese National Championships, Suguri placed third after her short program, but she stumbled in the free program, finishing fourth overall, and, again, she missed a spot on the World Championship team.\n\nDuring the 2008\u201309 season, Suguri chose to train with coach [[Nikolai Morozov (figure skater)|Nikolai Morozov]] in [[Hackensack, New Jersey]]. There, she was able to improve her jumping ability. Her first competition of the season was [[Skate Canada International|Skate Canada]] where she placed second behind [[Joannie Rochette]]. Her next competition was [[Cup of Russia]], where she led after the short program, then placed third in the free skate, and finished third, overall. At the 2008/2009 Japanese Championships she was 5th after the short program due to a fall on a triple flip. In her long program she landed five triples and scored 121.27 points, winning the long program and placing second overall behind Mao Asada. Suguri made the World team for the first time in three years. She placed 6th at the [[2009 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2009 Four Continents]] and 8th at the [[2009 World Figure Skating Championships|2009 World Championships]].\n\nSuguri left Morozov in the summer of 2009 to train with [[Alexei Mishin]] in Russia, saying she wanted to work on triple/triple combinations and the triple axel. Mishin neglected Suguri and she spent most of her time with Igor Pashkevich. She finished 7th at the 2010 Japanese National Championships.\n\n=== 2010\u201311 to present ===\nIn March 2011, Suguri stated that she would continue competing the next season, and possibly until 2014.<ref name=IN110310 /> She began working as a regular employee in the Sports Marketing Division at Sunny Side Up and gained a sponsorship at a medical company, Yoshindo.<ref name=SSU />\n\nSuguri was unsuccessful in her effort to reach the 2011\u201312 Japanese Nationals, finishing 12th in her qualifying competition. She was dealing with an ankle injury.<ref name=1112nats /> In 2016, she competed in her first adult skating event.<ref name=IN160707 />\n\n== Programs ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n!
