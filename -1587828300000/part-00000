Sara Olson of [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]], [[Michigan]] is an obsessive fan of Christopher Wilde who seeks to use her family's trip to [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]], [[California]] to visit her widowed grandmother as an opportunity to meet him for spring break. Christopher, meanwhile, is on the brink of landing a movie deal and has agreed to remain out of the [[supermarket tabloid|tabloids]] in order to prove that he is serious about landing the role.\n\nOnce in California, Sara convinces her younger sister Jessica, to accompany her to a [[nightclub]] where he is rumored to be delivering a surprise performance for his pseudo-girlfriend Alexis Bender. Sara leaves Jessica outside the club to watch the car while she goes inside in a futile attempt to meet Christopher.\n\nFed up with waiting, Jessica leaves the car in search for Sara and meets Christopher when he hits her in the head while opening a door. Eager to avoid being caught by the [[paparazzi]], Christopher takes Jessica to a hospital to be examined, then brings her to his house so that he can make an appearance for the film director. He then brings Jessica home, and Jessica allows him to stay in her grandmother's garage for the night when he learns the paparazzi have followed him.\n\nThe next day Sara brings Jessica to [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] in the hopes of running into Christopher there. Sara goes off to sit down on the beach, but Jessica recognizes Christopher's disguise and sits down with him. The two are forced to make a quick exit from the beach when the paparazzi arrive; once they get away, Christopher shows Jessica around [[Los Angeles]].\n\nWhile attempting to return to Malibu, they are again spotted by the paparazzi, but manage to elude them by driving off the main road, losing Jessica's grandmother's car in a mud pool [[quicksand]] in the process. While walking back to Malibu, they get into a heated argument, with Jessica calling Christopher's life \"fake\". He tries to convince her his life is real. Christopher drags Jessica into a river and they forget their argument. Eventually, Christopher confides that he enjoyed hanging out with Jessica because she was not actually asking for anything from him. She agrees that it was fun having him alone.\n\nWhen they return to the beach they almost kiss, but are interrupted when Christopher panics about being recognized. Christopher tells Jessica that no one can know what happened between them that day, telling her that the paparazzi would ruin her life as well as his. Heartbroken and angry, Jessica returns home to Kalamazoo with her family, but not before the paparazzi establish a connection between her and Christopher.\n\nBack in Kalamazoo, Jessica watches Christopher tell a talk show host that he had never met her. Angry with the way the paparazzi forced Christopher to lie and hide himself from the real world, she confronts the paparazzi camped outside her house, and tells them that they destroyed him and that she \"never met the Christopher that they were all so obsessed with\". Christopher's best friend, Stubby convinces Christopher to make his own choices. Alexis finds out that Christopher has been with someone who is not famous, and she breaks up with him. Christopher realizes that he is free to pursue Jessica. Christopher then proceeds to fire his parents as his managers and turn down the movie role that made him lie and lose himself in the tabloids.\n\nAfter Sara's equally Christopher-obsessed friend A.J. viciously insults Jessica for what she said on television, Sara kicks A.J. out of the house and offers to take Jessica to the school dance with her. Jessica accepts, and Sara helps her get ready for the dance. At the dance, Christopher makes an appearance and apologizes to Jessica through a song. She wants more than just his apology though.\n\nWhen the paparazzi appear at the dance, he tells them that he was the one that lied and says he is crazy about Jessica. She smiles and accepts his apology, and he becomes her boyfriend. He gives her a pair of \"Christopher Wilde\" sunglasses.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kyle Skinner]] as  Christopher Wilde\n* [[Danielle Campbell]] as Jessica Olson\n* [[Brandon Mychal Smith]] as Albert Joshua \"Stubby\" Stubbins\n* [[Chelsea Kane]] as Alexis Bender\n* [[Maggie Castle]] as Sara Olson\n* [[Matt Winston]]  as Alan Smith\n* [[Toni Trucks]]   as Libby Lam\n* [[Beth Littleford]] as Barbara Olson\n* [[Dan O'Connor (actor)|Dan O'Connor]] as Dean Olson\n* [[Lauren Bowles]] as Sheri Wilde\n* [[Ron Pearson]] as  Daniel Wilde\n* [[Abbie Cobb]] as AJ\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot in 2009 on location in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].\n\n==Reception==\nThe movie premiere generated 6.0 million viewers, the first to debut on a Sunday night, becoming the channel's most-watched February original movie premiere in Total Viewers, Kids 7-11 and Teenagers.<ref name=\"TVBythenumbers\">{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2010/02/15/disneys-starstruck-shines-in-debut-with-6-0-million-viewers/ |title=Disney's \"Starstruck\" Shines in Debut With 6.0 Million Viewers |work=[[TV by the Numbers]] |date=February 15, 2010}}</ref> [[Disney Channel]]'s highest numbers ever in the time period among teens (2.3 million), and second-highest on record in Total Viewers (6.0 million) and Kids 7\u201311 (2.4 million), behind only the August 19, 2007 encore of ''[[High School Musical 2]]''.<ref name=\"TVBythenumbers\" /> There were 987,000 viewers when it premiered in the [[UK]] and [[Ireland]] on May 14, 2010.<ref name=\"barb\">[[BARB]], via [http://www.barb.co.uk/viewing/weekly-top-10?]</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Starstruck Soundtrack\n| type       = [[Soundtrack]]\n| artist     = Various artists\n| cover      =\n| caption    ={{deletable image-caption|Friday, 24 January 2020|PROD}} \n| alt        =\n| released   = February 9, 2010\n| recorded   = 2009\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Teen pop]]\n| length     = 37:43\n| label      = [[Walt Disney Records]]\n| producer   = Various artists\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n| misc       = {{Singles\n | name        = Starstruck Soundtrack\n | type        = soundtrack\n | single1     = Starstruck\n | single1date = January 27, 2010\n | single2     = Hero\n | single2date = February 12, 2010\n}}\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{rating|2.5|5}}<ref name=\"Starstruck\"/>\n}}\nThe soundtrack was released on February 9, 2010 by [[Walt Disney Records]].<ref name=\"amazon\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002YICNCY |title=Starstruck: Various Artists: Music |date= |accessdate=2012-03-10}}</ref> The soundtrack peaked at number 23 on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].

Pre-adaptations and evolution after the initial introduction also play a role in the success of the introduced species. If the species has adapted to a similar ecosystem or contains traits that happen to be well suited to the area that it is introduced, it is more likely to fare better in the new environment.

However, even in an empty ballast tank, there remains a puddle of water filled with organisms that could be released at the next port (when the tank is filled with water after unloading the cargo, the ship takes on ballast water which mixes with the puddles and then everything including the living organisms in the puddles is discharged at the next port).<ref name=cargo/> Current regulations for the [[Great Lakes]] rely on \u2018[[salinity]] shock\u2019 to kill [[Fresh water|freshwater]] organisms left in ballast tanks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.glc.org/wp-content/uploads/GLC-BW-Reg-Summary-11.14.16.pdf|title=Status of Ballast Water Discharge Regulations in the Great Lakes Region|last=Great Lake Commission}}</ref>\n\nEven though ballast water regulations are in place to protect against potentially invasive species, there exists a loophole for organisms in the 10\u201350 micron size class.

The crews can bring invasive seeds with them. If any of these stowaway seeds become established, a thriving colony of invasives can erupt in as few as six weeks, after which controlling the outbreak can need years of continued attention to prevent further spread. Also, disturbing the soil surface, such as cutting firebreaks, destroys native cover, exposes soil, and can accelerate invasions. In suburban and [[wildland-urban interface]] areas, the vegetation clearance and brush removal ordinances of municipalities for [[Defensible space (fire control)|defensible space]] can result in excessive removal of native shrubs and [[perennials]] that exposes the soil to more light and less competition for invasive plant species.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nFire suppression vehicles are often major culprits in such outbreaks, as the vehicles are often driven on back roads overgrown with invasive plant species. The undercarriage of the vehicle becomes a prime vessel of transport. In response, on large fires, washing stations \"decontaminate\" vehicles before engaging in suppression activities.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Large wildfires attract firefighters from remote places, further increasing the potential for seed transport.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n==Effects==\n[[File:Gator and Python.jpg|thumb|right|An [[American alligator]] attacking a [[Burmese python in Florida]]; the [[Burmese python]] is an invasive species which is posing a threat to many indigenous species, including the alligator]]\n\n===Ecological===\nLand clearing and human habitation put significant pressure on local species. Disturbed habitats are prone to invasions that can have adverse effects on local ecosystems, changing ecosystem functions. A species of wetland plant known as {{okina}}ae{{okina}}ae in [[Hawaii]] (the indigenous ''[[Bacopa monnieri]]'') is regarded as a [[Pest (organism)|pest]] species in artificially manipulated water bird refuges because it quickly covers shallow [[mudflat]]s established for endangered Hawaiian stilt (''[[black-winged stilt|Himantopus mexicanus knudseni]]''), making these undesirable feeding areas for the birds.\n\nMultiple successive introductions of different non-native species can have interactive effects; the introduction of a second non-native species can enable the first invasive species to flourish. Examples of this are the introductions of the [[amethyst gem clam]] (''Gemma gemma'') and the European green crab (''[[Carcinus maenas]]''). The gem clam was introduced into California's [[Bodega Bay|Bodega Harbor]] from the [[East Coast of the United States]] a century ago. It had been found in small quantities in the harbor but had never displaced the native clam species (''Nutricola'' spp.). In the mid-1990s, the introduction of the European green crab, found to prey preferentially on the native clams, resulted in a decline of the native clams and an increase of the introduced clam populations.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Grosholz |first= E.D. |year= 2005 |title=Recent biological invasion may hasten invasional meltdown by accelerating historical introductions|journal= [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |volume=102 |pages=1088\u20131091 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0308547102 |pmid=15657121 |issue=4 |pmc=545825|bibcode= 2005PNAS..102.1088G }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Waterberg Biosphere|Waterberg]] region of South Africa, cattle grazing over the past six centuries has allowed invasive scrub and small trees to displace much of the original [[grassland]], resulting in a massive reduction in [[Fodder|forage]] for native bovids and other grazers. Since the 1970s, large scale efforts have been underway to reduce invasive species; partial success has led to re-establishment of many species that had dwindled or left the region. Examples of these species are [[giraffe]], [[blue wildebeest]], [[impala]], [[kudu]] and [[white rhino]].\n\nInvasive species can change the functions of ecosystems. For example, invasive plants can alter the fire regime (cheatgrass, ''[[Drooping Brome|Bromus tectorum]]''), [[nutrient cycling]] (smooth cordgrass ''[[Spartina alterniflora]]''), and hydrology (''[[Tamarix]]'') in native ecosystems.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mack |first= R. |year=2000 |title=Biotic invasions: Causes, epidemiology, global consequences, and control |journal=[[Ecological Applications]] |volume=10 |pages=689\u2013710 |doi=10.1890/1051-0761(2000)010[0689:BICEGC]2.0.CO;2 |issue=3|url= https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3073e8d84afa5584c00aca60073705d2891b133b }}</ref> Invasive species that are closely related to rare native species have the potential to hybridize with the native species.

In areas where a native has become extinct or reached a point that it cannot be restored, non-native species can fill their role. An example of this is the [[Tamarix|Tamarisk]], a non-native woody plant, and the [[Southwestern Willow Flycatcher]], an endangered bird. 75% of Southwestern Willow Flycatchers were found to nest in these plants and their success was the same as the flycatchers that had [[nest]]ed in native plants. The removal of Tamarisk would be detrimental to Southwestern Willow Flycatcher as their native nesting sites are unable to be restored.<ref name=potential/>\n\nThe second way that non-native species can be beneficial is that they act as catalysts for restoration. This is because the presence of non-native species increases the [[heterogeneity]] and biodiversity in an ecosystem. This increase in heterogeneity can create microclimates in sparse and eroded ecosystems, which then promotes the growth and reestablishment of native species. Another benefit of non-native species is that they can act as a substitute for an existing ecosystem engineer. In many cases, non-native species can be introduced to fill a niche that had previously been occupied by a native species.<ref name=potential/>\n\nMany non-native species have similar characteristics and functions and can keep an ecosystem functioning properly without collapse. An example of this is the [[Aldabra giant tortoise]]s, which were introduced on several small islands and have successfully taken over the roles of herbivore and seed disperser. The last benefit of non-native species is that they provided ecosystem services.<ref name=potential/> The major example are [[pollinator]]s. The American [[Honey bee]] was introduced in the rainforest{{Which|date=January 2019}} to pollinate fragmented landscapes that native species cannot. Also, non-native species can function as [[biocontrol]] agents to limit the effects of invasive species.

For example, Kudzu [[Pueraria montana]], a vine native to Asia was widely introduced in the [[Southeastern US|southeastern USA]] in the early 20th century to control [[soil erosion]].  While primary effects of invasive animals are [[bioturbation]], [[bioerosion]], and bioconstruction.  For example, invasion of Chinese mitten crab [[Eriocheir sinensis]] have resulted in higher bioturbation and bioerosion rates.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fei |first= S. |year=2015 |title=Biogeomorphic Impacts of Invasive Species |journal=[[Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics]] |volume=45 |pages=69\u201387 |doi=10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-120213-091928|url= https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2da7c8b96a7ace236d4d418807ad8234f2a5242e }}</ref>\n\n===Economic===\nGlobally, 1.4 trillion dollars are spent every year in managing and controlling invasive species.<ref name=\":4\" /> Some invaders can negatively affect the economy of the local area.

In its original habitat, the sea lamprey used co-evolution to act as a [[Parasitism|parasite]] without killing the [[host organism]].

Much of the study of invasive species has been influenced by [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton's]] 1958 book ''The Ecology of Invasion by Animals and Plants'' which drew upon the limited amount of research done within disparate fields to create a generalized picture of biological invasions.<ref name=IE>{{cite book|last=Lockwood|first=Julie L.|title=Invasion Ecology|year=2007|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|page=7|url=http://www.planta.cn/forum/files_planta/invasion_ecology1_208.pdf|author2=Hoopes, Martha F. |author3=Marchetti, Michael P. |accessdate=January 21, 2014}}</ref><ref name=Lowry>{{cite journal|pmid=23404636|year=2012|last1=Lowry|first1=E|last2=Rollinson|first2=EJ|last3=Laybourn|first3=AJ|last4=Scott|first4=TE|last5=Aiello-Lammens|first5=ME|last6=Gray|first6=SM|last7=Mickley|first7=J|last8=Gurevitch|first8=J|title=Biological invasions: A field synopsis, systematic review, and database of the literature|volume=3|issue=1|pages=182\u201396|doi=10.1002/ece3.431|pmc=3568853|journal=Ecology and Evolution}}</ref> Studies on invasive species remained sparse until the 1990s when research in the field experienced a large amount of growth which continues to this day.<ref name=Lowry/> This research, which has largely consisted of field observational studies, has disproportionately been concerned with [[terrestrial plant]]s.<ref name=Lowry/> The rapid growth of the field has driven a need to standardize the language used to describe invasive species and events.

The model evaluated individual populations rather than entire species. It classified each population based on its success in that environment. This model applied equally to indigenous and to introduced species, and did not automatically categorize successful introductions as harmful.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Introduced species on islands ===\nPerhaps the best place to study problems associated with introduced species is on islands. Depending upon the isolation (how far an island is located from continental biotas), native island biological communities may be poorly adapted to the threat posed by exotic introductions. Often this can mean that no natural [[predator]] of an introduced species is present, and the non-native spreads uncontrollably into open or occupied [[ecological niche|niche]].\n\nAn additional problem is that birds native to small islands may have become flightless because of the absence of predators prior to introductions and cannot readily escape the danger brought to them by introduced predators. The tendency of [[rail (bird)|rail]]s in particular to evolve flightless forms on islands making them vulnerable  has led to the disproportionate number of extinctions in that family.\n\nThe field of [[island restoration]] has developed as a field of [[conservation biology]] and [[ecological restoration]], a large part of which deals with the eradication of invasive species. A 2019 study suggests that if eradications of invasive animals were conducted on just 169 islands the survival prospects of 9.4% of the Earth's most highly threatened terrestrial insular vertebrates would be improved.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Holmes |first1=Nick |date=March 27, 2019 |title= Globally important islands where eradicating invasive mammals will benefit highly threatened vertebrates |journal=PLOS One |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=e0212128 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0212128|pmid=30917126 |pmc=6436766 |bibcode=2019PLoSO..1412128H }}</ref>\n\n====Hawaii====\n{{main|Invasive species in Hawaii}}\n\nThe islands of Hawaii have many invasive species affecting the islands' native plants and animals. Invasive insects, plants, hoofed animals such as deer, goats and pigs endanger native plants, [[rosy wolfsnail]]s from Africa feed  on the island's native snails, and plants such as [[Australian tree fern]] and ''[[Miconia calvescens]]'' shade out native plants.

This is key in adaptive evolution because the main goal is how to best be suited to the ecosystem that the species has been introduced. The ability to accomplish this as quickly as possible will lead to a population with a very high fitness. Pre-adaptations and evolution after the initial introduction also play a role in the success of the introduced species. If the species has adapted to a similar ecosystem or contains traits that happen to be well suited to the area that it is introduced, it is more likely to fare better in the new environment. This, in addition to evolution that takes place after introduction, all determine if the species will be able to become established in the new ecosystem and if it will reproduce and thrive.\n\nThe [[Enemy release hypothesis|enemy-release hypothesis]] states that the process of evolution has led to every ecosystem having an ecological balance. Any one species cannot occupy a majority of the ecosystem due to the presences of competitors, predators, and diseases. Introduced species moved to a novel habitat can become invasive when these controls - competitors, predators, and diseases - do not exist in the new ecosystem.

Since some studies have suggested increased temperature tolerance of \u201chijackers\u201d on ships\u2019 hulls or in ballast water, it is necessary to develop more comprehensive fouling and ballast water management plans in an effort to prevent against future possible invasions as environmental conditions continue to change around the world.\n\n===Effects of wildfire and firefighting===\nInvasive species often exploit disturbances to an ecosystem ([[wildfire]]s, [[road]]s, [[foot trail]]s) to colonize an area. Large wildfires can [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilize]] soils, while adding a variety of [[nutrient]]s.<ref name=\"Davis 2000 528\u2013534\"/>  In the resulting free-for-all, formerly entrenched species lose their advantage, leaving more room for invasives. In such circumstances plants that can regenerate from their roots have an advantage. Non-natives with this ability can benefit from a low intensity fire burns that removes surface [[vegetation]], leaving natives that rely on seeds for propagation to find their niches occupied when their seeds finally sprout.<ref name=\"Brooks 2004 677\u2013688\"/>\n\nWildfires often occur in remote areas, needing fire suppression crews to travel through pristine forest to reach the site. The crews can bring invasive seeds with them. If any of these stowaway seeds become established, a thriving colony of invasives can erupt in as few as six weeks, after which controlling the outbreak can need years of continued attention to prevent further spread. Also, disturbing the soil surface, such as cutting firebreaks, destroys native cover, exposes soil, and can accelerate invasions. In suburban and [[wildland-urban interface]] areas, the vegetation clearance and brush removal ordinances of municipalities for [[Defensible space (fire control)|defensible space]] can result in excessive removal of native shrubs and [[perennials]] that exposes the soil to more light and less competition for invasive plant species.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nFire suppression vehicles are often major culprits in such outbreaks, as the vehicles are often driven on back roads overgrown with invasive plant species. The undercarriage of the vehicle becomes a prime vessel of transport. In response, on large fires, washing stations \"decontaminate\" vehicles before engaging in suppression activities.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Large wildfires attract firefighters from remote places, further increasing the potential for seed transport.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n==Effects==\n[[File:Gator and Python.jpg|thumb|right|An [[American alligator]] attacking a [[Burmese python in Florida]]; the [[Burmese python]] is an invasive species which is posing a threat to many indigenous species, including the alligator]]\n\n===Ecological===\nLand clearing and human habitation put significant pressure on local species. Disturbed habitats are prone to invasions that can have adverse effects on local ecosystems, changing ecosystem functions. A species of wetland plant known as {{okina}}ae{{okina}}ae in [[Hawaii]] (the indigenous ''[[Bacopa monnieri]]'') is regarded as a [[Pest (organism)|pest]] species in artificially manipulated water bird refuges because it quickly covers shallow [[mudflat]]s established for endangered Hawaiian stilt (''[[black-winged stilt|Himantopus mexicanus knudseni]]''), making these undesirable feeding areas for the birds.\n\nMultiple successive introductions of different non-native species can have interactive effects; the introduction of a second non-native species can enable the first invasive species to flourish. Examples of this are the introductions of the [[amethyst gem clam]] (''Gemma gemma'') and the European green crab (''[[Carcinus maenas]]''). The gem clam was introduced into California's [[Bodega Bay|Bodega Harbor]] from the [[East Coast of the United States]] a century ago. It had been found in small quantities in the harbor but had never displaced the native clam species (''Nutricola'' spp.). In the mid-1990s, the introduction of the European green crab, found to prey preferentially on the native clams, resulted in a decline of the native clams and an increase of the introduced clam populations.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Grosholz |first= E.D. |year= 2005 |title=Recent biological invasion may hasten invasional meltdown by accelerating historical introductions|journal= [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |volume=102 |pages=1088\u20131091 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0308547102 |pmid=15657121 |issue=4 |pmc=545825|bibcode= 2005PNAS..102.1088G }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Waterberg Biosphere|Waterberg]] region of South Africa, cattle grazing over the past six centuries has allowed invasive scrub and small trees to displace much of the original [[grassland]], resulting in a massive reduction in [[Fodder|forage]] for native bovids and other grazers. Since the 1970s, large scale efforts have been underway to reduce invasive species; partial success has led to re-establishment of many species that had dwindled or left the region. Examples of these species are [[giraffe]], [[blue wildebeest]], [[impala]], [[kudu]] and [[white rhino]].\n\nInvasive species can change the functions of ecosystems. For example, invasive plants can alter the fire regime (cheatgrass, ''[[Drooping Brome|Bromus tectorum]]''), [[nutrient cycling]] (smooth cordgrass ''[[Spartina alterniflora]]''), and hydrology (''[[Tamarix]]'') in native ecosystems.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mack |first= R. |year=2000 |title=Biotic invasions: Causes, epidemiology, global consequences, and control |journal=[[Ecological Applications]] |volume=10 |pages=689\u2013710 |doi=10.1890/1051-0761(2000)010[0689:BICEGC]2.0.CO;2 |issue=3|url= https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3073e8d84afa5584c00aca60073705d2891b133b }}</ref> Invasive species that are closely related to rare native species have the potential to hybridize with the native species.

In areas where a native has become extinct or reached a point that it cannot be restored, non-native species can fill their role. An example of this is the [[Tamarix|Tamarisk]], a non-native woody plant, and the [[Southwestern Willow Flycatcher]], an endangered bird. 75% of Southwestern Willow Flycatchers were found to nest in these plants and their success was the same as the flycatchers that had [[nest]]ed in native plants. The removal of Tamarisk would be detrimental to Southwestern Willow Flycatcher as their native nesting sites are unable to be restored.<ref name=potential/>\n\nThe second way that non-native species can be beneficial is that they act as catalysts for restoration. This is because the presence of non-native species increases the [[heterogeneity]] and biodiversity in an ecosystem. This increase in heterogeneity can create microclimates in sparse and eroded ecosystems, which then promotes the growth and reestablishment of native species. Another benefit of non-native species is that they can act as a substitute for an existing ecosystem engineer. In many cases, non-native species can be introduced to fill a niche that had previously been occupied by a native species.<ref name=potential/>\n\nMany non-native species have similar characteristics and functions and can keep an ecosystem functioning properly without collapse. An example of this is the [[Aldabra giant tortoise]]s, which were introduced on several small islands and have successfully taken over the roles of herbivore and seed disperser. The last benefit of non-native species is that they provided ecosystem services.<ref name=potential/> The major example are [[pollinator]]s. The American [[Honey bee]] was introduced in the rainforest{{Which|date=January 2019}} to pollinate fragmented landscapes that native species cannot. Also, non-native species can function as [[biocontrol]] agents to limit the effects of invasive species.

For example, Kudzu [[Pueraria montana]], a vine native to Asia was widely introduced in the [[Southeastern US|southeastern USA]] in the early 20th century to control [[soil erosion]].

In its original habitat, the sea lamprey used co-evolution to act as a [[Parasitism|parasite]] without killing the [[host organism]].

The model evaluated individual populations rather than entire species. It classified each population based on its success in that environment. This model applied equally to indigenous and to introduced species, and did not automatically categorize successful introductions as harmful.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Introduced species on islands ===\nPerhaps the best place to study problems associated with introduced species is on islands. Depending upon the isolation (how far an island is located from continental biotas), native island biological communities may be poorly adapted to the threat posed by exotic introductions. Often this can mean that no natural [[predator]] of an introduced species is present, and the non-native spreads uncontrollably into open or occupied [[ecological niche|niche]].\n\nAn additional problem is that birds native to small islands may have become flightless because of the absence of predators prior to introductions and cannot readily escape the danger brought to them by introduced predators. The tendency of [[rail (bird)|rail]]s in particular to evolve flightless forms on islands making them vulnerable  has led to the disproportionate number of extinctions in that family.\n\nThe field of [[island restoration]] has developed as a field of [[conservation biology]] and [[ecological restoration]], a large part of which deals with the eradication of invasive species. A 2019 study suggests that if eradications of invasive animals were conducted on just 169 islands the survival prospects of 9.4% of the Earth's most highly threatened terrestrial insular vertebrates would be improved.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Holmes |first1=Nick |date=March 27, 2019 |title= Globally important islands where eradicating invasive mammals will benefit highly threatened vertebrates |journal=PLOS One |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=e0212128 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0212128|pmid=30917126 |pmc=6436766 |bibcode=2019PLoSO..1412128H }}</ref>\n\n====Hawaii====\n{{main|Invasive species in Hawaii}}\n\nThe islands of Hawaii have many invasive species affecting the islands' native plants and animals.
