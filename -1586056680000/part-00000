Multiple objects may also be coupled to each other simultaneously, such as with [[globular cluster]]s and [[galaxy group]]s.

{"title_page": "Sungrazing comet", "text_new": "[[File:Kreutz Comet Orbits.ogv|thumb|300px|The representative orbit of a sungrazing comet.]]\n\nA '''sungrazing comet''' is a [[comet]] that passes extremely close to the [[Sun]] at [[perihelion]] \u2013 sometimes within a few thousand kilometres of the Sun's surface. Although small sungrazers can completely [[evaporation|evaporate]] during such a close approach to the Sun, larger sungrazers can survive many perihelion passages. However, the strong evaporation and [[tidal force]]s they experience often lead to their fragmentation.\n\nUp until the 1880s, it was thought that all bright comets near the Sun were the repeated return of a single sungrazing comet. Then, German astronomer [[Heinrich Kreutz]] and American astronomer [[Daniel Kirkwood]] determined that, instead of the return of the same comet, each appearance was a different comet, but each were related to a group of comets that had separated from each other at an earlier passage near the Sun (at [[perihelion]]).<ref name=Kirkwood>{{cite journal|last=Kirkwood|first=Daniel|title=On the great southern comet of 1880|journal=The Observatory|date=November 1880|volume=3|pages=590\u2013592|bibcode=1880Obs.....3..590K}}</ref>   Very little was known about the population of sungrazing comets until 1979 when [[coronagraph]]ic observations allowed the detection of sungrazers.  As of October 21, 2017, there are 1495 known comets that come within ~12 solar radii (~0.055 AU).<ref>[http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb_query.cgi#x JPL Small-Body Database Search Engine]</ref>  This accounts for nearly one third of all comets.<ref>{{cite web |last=Johnston |first=Robert |title=Known populations of solar system objects |url=http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/astro/sslist.html |date=27 July 2013 |accessdate=30 July 2013}}</ref>  Most of these objects vaporize during their close approach, but a comet with a nucleus radius larger than 2\u20133&nbsp;km is likely to survive the perihelion passage with a final radius of ~1&nbsp;km.\n\nSungrazer comets were some of the earliest observed comets because they can appear very bright. Some are even considered [[Great Comet]]s. The close passage of a comet to the Sun will brighten the comet not only because the reflection off the comet nucleus when it is closer to the Sun, but the Sun also vaporizes a large amount of gas from the comet and the gas reflects more light. This extreme brightening will allow for possible naked eye observations from Earth depending on how [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] the gases are and if the comet is large enough to survive perihelion. These comets provide a useful tool for understanding the composition of comets as we observe the outgassing activity and they also offer a way to probe the effects solar radiation has on other Solar System bodies.\n\n== History of Sungrazers ==\n\n=== Pre-19th Century ===\nOne of the first comets to have its orbit computed was the sungrazing comet (and Great Comet) of 1680, now designated [[C/1680 V1]].  It was observed by [[Isaac Newton]] and he published the orbit results in 1687.<ref name=Marsden>{{cite journal|last=Marsden|first=Brian G.|title=Sungrazing Comets|journal=Annual Review of Astronomy & Astrophysics|date=September 2005|volume=43|issue=1|pages=75\u2013102|doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.43.072103.150554|bibcode=2005ARA&A..43...75M}}</ref> Later, in 1699, [[Jacques Cassini]] proposed that comets could have relatively short orbital periods and that C/1680 V1 was the same as a comet observed by [[Tycho Brahe]] in 1577, but in 1705 [[Edmond Halley]] determined that the difference between the perihelion distances of the two comets was too great for them to be the same object.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cassini|first=JD|journal=Hist. Acad. R. Sci. Paris|date=1699|volume=Amsterdam ed. 1734|pages=95\u2013100}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Halley|first=Edmund|journal=Phil.

Astronomi\u00e6 cometic\u00e6 synopsis, Autore Edmundo Halleio apud Oxonienses Geometri\u00e6 Professore Saviliano, & Reg. Soc. S}}</ref> However, this marked the first time that it was hypothesized that Great Comets were related or perhaps the same comet. Later, [[Johann Franz Encke]] computed the orbit of C/1680 V1 and found a period of approximately 9000 years, leading him to conclude that Cassini's theory of short period sungrazers was flawed. C/1680 V1 had the smallest measured perihelion distance until the observation in 1826 of comet C/1826 U1.<ref name=Marsden />\n\n=== 19th Century ===\nAdvances were made in understanding sungrazing comets in the 19th century with the Great Comets of [[C/1843 D1|1843]], C/1880 C1, and [[C/1882 R1|1882]]. C/1880 C1 and C/1843 D1 had very similar appearances and also resembled the [[X/1106 C1|Great Comet of 1106]], therefore Daniel Kirkwood proposed that C/1880 C1 and C/1843 D1 were separate fragments of the same object.<ref name=Kirkwood />   He also hypothesized that the [[parent body]] was a comet seen by [[Aristotle]] and [[Ephorus]] in 371 BC because there was a supposed claim that Ephorus witnessed the comet splitting after perihelion.<ref name=Marsden />\n\nComet [[C/1882 R1]] appeared only two years after the previously observed sungrazer so this convinced astronomers that these bright comets were not all the same object.  Some astronomers theorized that the comet might pass through a resisting medium near the Sun and that would shorten its period.<ref name=Marsden />   When astronomers observed C/1882 R1, they measured the period before and after perihelion and saw no shortening in the period which disproved the theory.  After perihelion this object was also seen to split into several fragments and therefore Kirkwood's theory of these comets coming from a parent body seemed like a good explanation.\n\nIn an attempt to link the 1843 and 1880 comets to the comet in 1106 and 371 BC, Kreutz measured the fragments of the 1882 comet and determined that it was likely a fragment of the 1106 comet.  He then designated that all sungrazing comets with similar orbital characteristics as these few comets would be part of the [[Kreutz Sungrazers|Kreutz Group]].<ref name=Marsden />\n\nThe 19th century also provided the first spectrum taken of a comet near the Sun which was taken by Finlay & Elkin in 1882.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Finlay|first=W.H.|author2=W.L Elkin |title=Observations of the Great Comet 1882|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|date=November 1992|volume=43|pages=21\u201325|doi=10.1093/mnras/43.1.21|bibcode=1882MNRAS..43...22E|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1431845}}</ref> Later the spectrum was analyzed and [[Iron|Fe]] and [[Nickel|Ni]] spectral lines were confirmed.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Orlov|first=A.|journal=Astron.

Although small sungrazers can completely [[evaporation|evaporate]] during such a close approach to the Sun, larger sungrazers can survive many perihelion passages. However, the strong evaporation and [[tidal force]]s they experience often lead to their fragmentation.\n\nUp until the 1880s, it was thought that all bright comets near the Sun were the repeated return of a single sungrazing comet. Then, German astronomer [[Heinrich Kreutz]] and American astronomer [[Daniel Kirkwood]] determined that, instead of the return of the same comet, each appearance was a different comet, but each were related to a group of comets that had separated from each other at an earlier passage near the Sun (at [[perihelion]]).<ref name=Kirkwood>{{cite journal|last=Kirkwood|first=Daniel|title=On the great southern comet of 1880|journal=The Observatory|date=November 1880|volume=3|pages=590\u2013592|bibcode=1880Obs.....3..590K}}</ref>   Very little was known about the population of sungrazing comets until 1979 when [[coronagraph]]ic observations allowed the detection of sungrazers.  As of October 21, 2017, there are 1495 known comets that come within ~12 solar radii (~0.055 AU).<ref>[http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb_query.cgi#x JPL Small-Body Database Search Engine]</ref>  This accounts for nearly one third of all comets.<ref>{{cite web |last=Johnston |first=Robert |title=Known populations of solar system objects |url=http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/astro/sslist.html |date=27 July 2013 |accessdate=30 July 2013}}</ref>  Most of these objects vaporize during their close approach, but a comet with a nucleus radius larger than 2\u20133&nbsp;km is likely to survive the perihelion passage with a final radius of ~1&nbsp;km.\n\nSungrazer comets were some of the earliest observed comets because they can appear very bright. Some are even considered [[Great Comet]]s. The close passage of a comet to the Sun will brighten the comet not only because the reflection off the comet nucleus when it is closer to the Sun, but the Sun also vaporizes a large amount of gas from the comet and the gas reflects more light. This extreme brightening will allow for possible naked eye observations from Earth depending on how [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] the gases are and if the comet is large enough to survive perihelion. These comets provide a useful tool for understanding the composition of comets as we observe the outgassing activity and they also offer a way to probe the effects solar radiation has on other Solar System bodies.\n\n== History of Sungrazers ==\n\n=== Pre-19th Century ===\nOne of the first comets to have its orbit computed was the sungrazing comet (and Great Comet) of 1680, now designated [[C/1680 V1]].  It was observed by [[Isaac Newton]] and he published the orbit results in 1687.<ref name=Marsden>{{cite journal|last=Marsden|first=Brian G.|title=Sungrazing Comets|journal=Annual Review of Astronomy & Astrophysics|date=September 2005|volume=43|issue=1|pages=75\u2013102|doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.43.072103.150554|bibcode=2005ARA&A..43...75M}}</ref> Later, in 1699, [[Jacques Cassini]] proposed that comets could have relatively short orbital periods and that C/1680 V1 was the same as a comet observed by [[Tycho Brahe]] in 1577, but in 1705 [[Edmond Halley]] determined that the difference between the perihelion distances of the two comets was too great for them to be the same object.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cassini|first=JD|journal=Hist.

S}}</ref> However, this marked the first time that it was hypothesized that Great Comets were related or perhaps the same comet. Later, [[Johann Franz Encke]] computed the orbit of C/1680 V1 and found a period of approximately 9000 years, leading him to conclude that Cassini's theory of short period sungrazers was flawed. C/1680 V1 had the smallest measured perihelion distance until the observation in 1826 of comet C/1826 U1.<ref name=Marsden />\n\n=== 19th Century ===\nAdvances were made in understanding sungrazing comets in the 19th century with the Great Comets of [[C/1843 D1|1843]], C/1880 C1, and [[C/1882 R1|1882]]. C/1880 C1 and C/1843 D1 had very similar appearances and also resembled the [[X/1106 C1|Great Comet of 1106]], therefore Daniel Kirkwood proposed that C/1880 C1 and C/1843 D1 were separate fragments of the same object.<ref name=Kirkwood />   He also hypothesized that the [[parent body]] was a comet seen by [[Aristotle]] and [[Ephorus]] in 371 BC because there was a supposed claim that Ephorus witnessed the comet splitting after perihelion.<ref name=Marsden />\n\nComet [[C/1882 R1]] appeared only two years after the previously observed sungrazer so this convinced astronomers that these bright comets were not all the same object.  Some astronomers theorized that the comet might pass through a resisting medium near the Sun and that would shorten its period.<ref name=Marsden />   When astronomers observed C/1882 R1, they measured the period before and after perihelion and saw no shortening in the period which disproved the theory.  After perihelion this object was also seen to split into several fragments and therefore Kirkwood's theory of these comets coming from a parent body seemed like a good explanation.\n\nIn an attempt to link the 1843 and 1880 comets to the comet in 1106 and 371 BC, Kreutz measured the fragments of the 1882 comet and determined that it was likely a fragment of the 1106 comet.  He then designated that all sungrazing comets with similar orbital characteristics as these few comets would be part of the [[Kreutz Sungrazers|Kreutz Group]].<ref name=Marsden />\n\nThe 19th century also provided the first spectrum taken of a comet near the Sun which was taken by Finlay & Elkin in 1882.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Finlay|first=W.H.|author2=W.L Elkin |title=Observations of the Great Comet 1882|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|date=November 1992|volume=43|pages=21\u201325|doi=10.1093/mnras/43.1.21|bibcode=1882MNRAS..43...22E|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1431845}}</ref> Later the spectrum was analyzed and [[Iron|Fe]] and [[Nickel|Ni]] spectral lines were confirmed.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Orlov|first=A.|journal=Astron.

An extremely bright comet seen by [[Aristotle]] and [[Ephorus]] in 371 BC is a possible candidate for this parent comet.\n\nThe [[Great Comet]]s of [[C/1843 D1|1843]] and [[C/1882 R1|1882]], [[Comet Ikeya\u2013Seki]] in 1965 and [[C/2011 W3 (Lovejoy)]] in 2011 were all fragments of the original comet.  Each of these four was briefly bright enough to be visible in the daytime sky, next to the Sun, outshining even the [[full moon]].\n\nIn 1979, C/1979 Q1 (SOLWIND) was the first sungrazer to be spotted by US satellite [[P78-1]], in [[coronagraph]]s taken on 30 and 31 Aug 1979.<ref>[http://cometography.com/lcomets/1979q1.html cometography.com, ''C/1979 Q1 \u2013 SOLWIND 1'']</ref>\n\nSince the launch of the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] satellite in 1995, hundreds of tiny Kreutz Sungrazers have been discovered, all of which have either plunged into the Sun or been destroyed completely during their perihelion passage, with the exception of [[C/2011 W3 (Lovejoy)]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}  The Kreutz family of comets is apparently much larger than previously suspected.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n=== Other sungrazers ===\n\n[[File:A Unique Hubble View of Comet ISON.jpg|thumb|[[Comet ISON]]<ref name=\"ARXIV-20140508\" /> taken with the Wide Field Camera 3 on April 30, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Unique Hubble View of Comet ISON|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/opo1331a/|work=Image Gallery|publisher=ESA/Hubble|accessdate=15 August 2013}}</ref> ]]\n\nAbout 83% of the sungrazers observed with SOHO are members of the Kreutz group.<ref>[http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~jds/klist.htm Complete list of SOHO comets]</ref>  The other 17% contains some sporadic sungrazers, but three other related groups of comets have been identified among them: the Kracht, Marsden and Meyer groups.  The Marsden and Kracht groups both appear to be related to Comet [[96P/Machholz]]. These comets have also been linked to several [[meteor]] streams, including the Daytime [[Arietids]], the [[delta Aquariids]], and the [[Quadrantids]]. Linked comet orbits suggest that both Marsden and Kracht groups have a small period, on the order of five years, but the Meyer group may have intermediate- or long-period orbits. The Meyer group comets are typically small, faint, and never have tails. The [[Great Comet of 1680]] was a sungrazer and while used by Newton to verify Kepler's equations on orbital motion, it was not a member of any larger groups.

One study has suggested that [[Comet Hale\u2013Bopp]] has about a 15% chance of eventually becoming a sungrazer.\n\n== Role in solar astronomy ==\n\nThe motion of tails of sungrazers that survive perihelion (such as Comet Lovejoy) can provide solar astronomers with information about the structure of the solar [[corona]], particularly the detailed magnetic structure.<ref>[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23657-deathdefying-comet-wags-its-tail-during-solar-embrace.html Death-defying comet wags its tail during solar embrace]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Helion (meteoroid)]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite journal |last=Bailey |first=M.

Because of this rule, the championship is defended across all of WWE's brands\u2014[[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]], [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]], [[205 Live (WWE brand)|205 Live]], [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]], and [[NXT UK (WWE brand)|NXT UK]]\u2014as well as outside of regular shows, often with videos posted on the promotion's website and social media accounts. The current champion is [[Mojo Rawley]], who is in his seventh reign.\n\nThe title was unveiled by [[Mick Foley]] on the May 20, 2019 episode of ''[[Monday Night Raw]]'', where [[Titus O'Neil]] from Raw became the inaugural champion. It is similar to the previous [[WWE Hardcore Championship]], which also had a 24/7 rule.

Because of this rule, the championship is defended across all of WWE's brands\u2014[[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]], [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]], [[205 Live (WWE brand)|205 Live]], [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]], and [[NXT UK (WWE brand)|NXT UK]]\u2014as well as outside of regular shows, often with videos posted on the promotion's website and social media accounts. The current champion is [[Mojo Rawley]], who is in his seventh reign.\n\nThe title was unveiled by [[Mick Foley]] on the May 20, 2019 episode of ''[[Monday Night Raw]]'', where [[Titus O'Neil]] from Raw became the inaugural champion. It is similar to the previous [[WWE Hardcore Championship]], which also had a 24/7 rule.
