Cox lead the team to three NCAA tournament bids and two NIT bids while in Boulder. \n\nArguably the greatest team in CU Basketball history was the 1940 squad which not only got invited to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] but to the [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT Tournament]] as well.  The Buffs won the more prestigious at the time NIT Tournament, which leads some to claim that the 1940 team was National Champs.<ref>Daily Camera: \"Historical Hoops: CU-Boulder Basketball Players Ruled the Court in 1940\" http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_19293467</ref> In 1942, the Buffs lost in the NCAA Tournament Championship game to the Stanford Cardinal, which is the school's all-time best finish in that tournament.\n\nIn 1947, the Buffs left the [[Mountain States Conference]] and joined the Big Seven Conference.

However, the star of this era was [[Burdette Haldorson|Burdette \"Burdie\" Haldorson]]. Also known as \"The Big Burd,\" Haldorson was arguably the best player in Colorado Men's Basketball history.  An All-American whose number is retired at CU, Haldorson was named to All-Big 7 Conference team two times and is also a member of the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Basketball Hall of Fame]], The Colorado Sports Hall of Fame, the University of Colorado Athletic Hall of Fame and the Pac-12 Basketball Hall of Honor.

In fact, all three years he was at Colorado he was named to the All-Big 8 First Team.  Because of his dominant play, he was not only named to the 1970s Big 8 All-Decade First Team, but in 1996 he was named to the AP's All-time Big 8 Conference Basketball first team along with [[Wayman Tisdale]] ([[Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball|Oklahoma]]), [[Danny Manning]] ([[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]]), [[Jo Jo White]] (Kansas) and [[Rolando Blackman]] ([[Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball|Kansas State]]).<ref>Media Guide: Honor Roll http://www.cubuffs.com/fls/600/mbb/2011-12_Info_Guide/110-117_honor_roll.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=600 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524165324/http://www.cubuffs.com/fls/600/mbb/2011-12_Info_Guide/110-117_honor_roll.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=600 |date=2015-05-24 }}</ref>\n\nColorado has retired the #20 that he wore while in Boulder.\n\n===Individual talents lead the way===\nThe lackluster results of Walseth's latter tenure would become the norm for Colorado over the next two decades. From 1977-78 to 1995-96, the Buffs would only have four winning seasons, and only once would even get to .500 in Big Eight play.\n\nWhile the Buffs struggled record-wise in the '80s and early '90s, they did have a few individual standouts that brought the team national attention.  From 1980\u201384, the Buffs were led by [[Jay Humphries]], an exciting guard who made his mark all over CU's record book in just those three seasons.  On offense, he became the school's all-time [[Assist (basketball)|assist]] leader and also finished fourth all-time in scoring.  Even with that though, Humphries was best known for his defense.

He finished his time as the number three scorer in school history and is still in the top 10 for assists in school history.  Wise & Vandiver led the team on their run to the 1991 NIT Final Four.  It was the school's first postseason appearance since 1969, and when it was said & done, they got to cut down the nets in front of a standing room only crowd at the Events Center before heading to the NIT Final Four in NYC where they ended up third.\n\nThe next player to make his mark on the record books was [[Donnie Boyce]].  The Illinois product spent four years at CU and when he left he was the school's all-time leading scorer with 1,995 points.  He was the first Buff to lead the team in scoring all four years at CU, and only the second Buff to ever do it.  While Boyce was lighting it up, the team struggled.  It appeared that Boyce was finally going to get to play in a postseason tournament in 1995, but he broke his leg in the opening round of the Big Eight Tournament against Oklahoma.  The team went on to earn an NIT bid\u2013their first postseason bid of any sort since 1969\u2013but he was unable to play.\n\n===The Chauncey Billups years===\nThe most beloved player in school history, [[Chauncey Billups]] is usually the first person that people think of when they think Colorado basketball. The three-time winner of Colorado's Mr. Basketball award and a member of the [[McDonald's All-American]] team his senior year, the Denver native could have gone anywhere in the nation to play college ball.<ref>JockBio: Chauncey Billups Biography http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/Billups/Billups_bio.html</ref> Even though it was obvious he wouldn't be staying for the entire four years due to a pro career calling his name, he had no shortage of suitors. With all of that, he decided to stay close to home and enroll at CU.\n\nIn his first year at Colorado, he set a school record for points scored by a freshman and was named to the Big 8 All-Freshman team as well as the All-Big 8 Conference Second Team and the Kansas City Star Big 8 team\u2014an honor that was voted on by the players themselves. Unfortunately, Chauncey's first year in Boulder was filled only with individual accolades as the team underperformed and head coach Joe Harrington was relieved of duties. His sophomore year however, Chauncey was able to get the team going. Behind new head coach Ricardo Patton, and in a new conference (the [[Big 12 Conference]]), Chauncey at one point had led the Buffs to a 14\u20133 record and the #18 ranking in the nation. This team would make the Buffs' first NCAA Tournament appearance in 28 years, and notched their first winning conference record in 24 years. They would upset [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana]] in the first round before losing to [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]] in the second round. For his work, Chauncey was named not only to the All-[[Big 12 Conference]] First Team, but was named an All-American as well.  Chauncey declared for the [[1997 NBA draft|NBA Draft]], where he was picked third overall by the [[Boston Celtics]], and he went on to play 17 years in the NBA.\n\n===The Buffs enter The Big 12===\nOnce Chauncey left, the Buffs were faced with a rough conference slate, but still managed to have some success behind head coach [[Ricardo Patton]].  Players such as [[Jaquay Walls]] (Big 12 All-Newcomer Team) and Jamahl Mosley helped lead the team to back-to-back NIT bids, but things started to improve once [[David Harrison (basketball)|David Harrison]] showed up on campus for the 2001\u201302 season.  Harrison was named to the Big 12 All-Freshman team and lead the school in scoring, while also setting a school record with a field goal percentage of 63.8% \u2013 good enough for third nationally.<ref>Media Guide: Basketball History/Polls http://www.cubuffs.com/fls/600/mbb/2011-12_Info_Guide/66-71_history_polls.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=600 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230233434/http://www.cubuffs.com/fls/600/mbb/2011-12_Info_Guide/66-71_history_polls.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=600 |date=2013-12-30 }}</ref>  Harrison had help though in the form of [[St\u00e9phane Pelle]]. Pelle was the first player in 11 years to average a double-double, putting up 12.8 points and 10.8 rebounds per game in the 2001\u201302 season.  The next season, with Harrison & Pelle down low and Michel Morandais coming in to form on the wing, the Buffs won 20 games and capped it off with an NCAA Tournament bid.  They made the NIT the next season after Harrison left early to go into the NBA Draft.\n\n===New all-time scoring leaders===\n[[Richard Roby]] stepped on the CU campus in 2004 and became the first freshman since Chauncey Billups to lead the team in scoring and he ended up joining Donnie Boyce as the only Buffs to lead the team in scoring all four years on campus.  In his sophomore season, Roby & the Buffs won twenty games and ended up in the NIT Tournament, while also being named to the All-Big 12 First Team.  Unfortunately, he was faced with a freshmen laden team the next season, as there were eight first year players (a school record) on the 2006\u201307 squad.

Higgins & Burks became the first tandem to net over 500 points in the same season since the 1990\u201391 campaign<ref>Media Guide: Basketball History/Polls http://www.cubuffs.com/fls/600/mbb/2011-12_Info_Guide/66-71_history_polls.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=600 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230233434/http://www.cubuffs.com/fls/600/mbb/2011-12_Info_Guide/66-71_history_polls.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=600 |date=2013-12-30 }}</ref> and were rewarded as Higgins was named to the All-Big 12 Third Team and Burks was named All-Big 12 Freshman of the Year.\n\n===The Tad Boyle era===\n[[Tad Boyle]] was named the 18th coach in University of Colorado men's basketball history on April 19, 2010. In his first season in Boulder, Boyle led the Buffs to a school-record 18 home wins and their highest Big 12 finish (t-5th) since 2005\u201306. CU ranked first in the Big 12 and fifth nationally in free throw percentage (77.8) for the 2010\u201311 season. Boyle's efficient attack also ranked 12th nationally in scoring (79.6 ppg) and 19th nationally in field goal percentage (47.3).\n\nBoyle earned National Coach of the Week honors (Hoops Report, Jan. 10\u201316) after leading the Buffs to a 3\u20130 conference start, including wins over No. 9/8 Missouri and No. 21/20 Kansas State. The win over the Wildcats gave CU its first road win over a nationally ranked opponent since defeating No. 20 Texas Tech in January 1997. For the season, CU defeated four ranked teams, including a comeback of 22 points down (ranking second all-time in school history) to upset No. 5/5 Texas, 91\u201389.<ref>Tad Boyle CUBUFFS.com BIO {{cite web |url=http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=3897&SPID=257&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=600&ATCLID=204940904&Q_SEASON=2011 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829152526/http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=3897&SPID=257&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=600&ATCLID=204940904&Q_SEASON=2011 |archivedate=2011-08-29 }}</ref> Despite having a very solid season and getting to the semi-finals of the conference tournament, Boyle and the Buffs were snubbed of a bid in the NCAA tournament. CU ended up making it all the way to the NIT semi-finals but lost to [[Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball|Alabama]].\n\nIn his second season at the helm Tad faced an uphill battle, losing 4 starters, 78% of the scoring and most notably Alec Burks to the NBA (#12 overall pick to the [[Utah Jazz]]). He was able turn all of this into his second 24 win season in a row, a Pac-12 tournament championship and a trip to the NCAA Tournament as a #11 seed where CU advanced to the round of 32 for the first time in 15 years after beating #6 seed [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|UNLV]] 68\u201364 in Albuquerque. CU's magical run was ended by Baylor in the round of 32, but in just two seasons, Boyle became the most successful post-season coach in the history of Colorado Basketball.\n\n===The AllBuffs.com All-Time Men's Basketball Team===\nThe users on AllBuffs.com had a vote in the summer of 2012 to decide who they considered to be the members of the [https://archive.is/20130116110904/http://www.allbuffs.com/entry.php/182-The-AllBuffs-All-Time-Men-s-Basketball-Team \"All-Time Men's Basketball Team\"] at the University of Colorado.

The first one was in 2008 when the Buffs became the first #12 seed to upset a #5 seed as they beat Baylor in the opening round.  The other one was during their last year in the conference when they beat Iowa State in the opening round and followed that up with their third win of the season over Kansas State before falling just short to Kansas in the semi-finals.\n\n===Pac-12 Conference Tournament===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The CEC opened in 1979 and the first game played there was the CU Men's Basketball team hosting the USSR basketball team.  The largest crowd ever to witness a game was on December 5, 2012 when 11,708 people watched CU play [[Colorado State Rams#Basketball|CSU]] (CU won the game 70\u201361).   The facility has also hosted its fair share of concerts as Bob Dylan, U2 and Stevie Wonder are some of the artists to have performed there.<ref>Coors Event Center History http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=600&ATCLID=119110</ref>\n\nThe facility was originally named the CU Events/Conference Center and cost $7.7 million to build.  In September 1990, it was renamed the Coors Event Center to honor a $5 million gift from the Adolph Coors Foundation.

Under Cox, the Buffs had quite a bit of success\u2014both individually and as a team.

From 1980\u201384, the Buffs were led by [[Jay Humphries]], an exciting guard who made his mark all over CU's record book in just those three seasons.  On offense, he became the school's all-time [[Assist (basketball)|assist]] leader and also finished fourth all-time in scoring.  Even with that though, Humphries was best known for his defense.

It was the school's first postseason appearance since 1969, and when it was said & done, they got to cut down the nets in front of a standing room only crowd at the Events Center before heading to the NIT Final Four in NYC where they ended up third.\n\nThe next player to make his mark on the record books was [[Donnie Boyce]].  The Illinois product spent four years at CU and when he left he was the school's all-time leading scorer with 1,995 points.  He was the first Buff to lead the team in scoring all four years at CU, and only the second Buff to ever do it.  While Boyce was lighting it up, the team struggled.  It appeared that Boyce was finally going to get to play in a postseason tournament in 1995, but he broke his leg in the opening round of the Big Eight Tournament against Oklahoma.  The team went on to earn an NIT bid\u2013their first postseason bid of any sort since 1969\u2013but he was unable to play.\n\n===The Chauncey Billups years===\nThe most beloved player in school history, [[Chauncey Billups]] is usually the first person that people think of when they think Colorado basketball. The three-time winner of Colorado's Mr. Basketball award and a member of the [[McDonald's All-American]] team his senior year, the Denver native could have gone anywhere in the nation to play college ball.<ref>JockBio: Chauncey Billups Biography http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/Billups/Billups_bio.html</ref> Even though it was obvious he wouldn't be staying for the entire four years due to a pro career calling his name, he had no shortage of suitors. With all of that, he decided to stay close to home and enroll at CU.\n\nIn his first year at Colorado, he set a school record for points scored by a freshman and was named to the Big 8 All-Freshman team as well as the All-Big 8 Conference Second Team and the Kansas City Star Big 8 team\u2014an honor that was voted on by the players themselves. Unfortunately, Chauncey's first year in Boulder was filled only with individual accolades as the team underperformed and head coach Joe Harrington was relieved of duties. His sophomore year however, Chauncey was able to get the team going. Behind new head coach Ricardo Patton, and in a new conference (the [[Big 12 Conference]]), Chauncey at one point had led the Buffs to a 14\u20133 record and the #18 ranking in the nation. This team would make the Buffs' first NCAA Tournament appearance in 28 years, and notched their first winning conference record in 24 years. They would upset [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana]] in the first round before losing to [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]] in the second round. For his work, Chauncey was named not only to the All-[[Big 12 Conference]] First Team, but was named an All-American as well.  Chauncey declared for the [[1997 NBA draft|NBA Draft]], where he was picked third overall by the [[Boston Celtics]], and he went on to play 17 years in the NBA.\n\n===The Buffs enter The Big 12===\nOnce Chauncey left, the Buffs were faced with a rough conference slate, but still managed to have some success behind head coach [[Ricardo Patton]].  Players such as [[Jaquay Walls]] (Big 12 All-Newcomer Team) and Jamahl Mosley helped lead the team to back-to-back NIT bids, but things started to improve once [[David Harrison (basketball)|David Harrison]] showed up on campus for the 2001\u201302 season.

Pelle was the first player in 11 years to average a double-double, putting up 12.8 points and 10.8 rebounds per game in the 2001\u201302 season.  The next season, with Harrison & Pelle down low and Michel Morandais coming in to form on the wing, the Buffs won 20 games and capped it off with an NCAA Tournament bid.  They made the NIT the next season after Harrison left early to go into the NBA Draft.\n\n===New all-time scoring leaders===\n[[Richard Roby]] stepped on the CU campus in 2004 and became the first freshman since Chauncey Billups to lead the team in scoring and he ended up joining Donnie Boyce as the only Buffs to lead the team in scoring all four years on campus.  In his sophomore season, Roby & the Buffs won twenty games and ended up in the NIT Tournament, while also being named to the All-Big 12 First Team.  Unfortunately, he was faced with a freshmen laden team the next season, as there were eight first year players (a school record) on the 2006\u201307 squad.  The next season showed improvement and the Buffs became the first team in Big 12 history to be a 12 seed and upset a number 5 seed ([[Baylor Bears basketball|Baylor]]) in the Big 12 Tournament.<ref>Media Guide: Basketball History/Polls http://www.cubuffs.com/fls/600/mbb/2011-12_Info_Guide/66-71_history_polls.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=600 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230233434/http://www.cubuffs.com/fls/600/mbb/2011-12_Info_Guide/66-71_history_polls.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=600 |date=2013-12-30 }}</ref>  When he finally graduated from CU, he left the school as the all-time leading scorer with 2,001 points\u2014a record that still stands to this day.\n\nBut it is a record that is shared, because during his senior year, he shared time on the floor with a freshman named [[Cory Higgins]] who would one day tie him as the school's all-time leading scorer.

In his first season in Boulder, Boyle led the Buffs to a school-record 18 home wins and their highest Big 12 finish (t-5th) since 2005\u201306. CU ranked first in the Big 12 and fifth nationally in free throw percentage (77.8) for the 2010\u201311 season. Boyle's efficient attack also ranked 12th nationally in scoring (79.6 ppg) and 19th nationally in field goal percentage (47.3).\n\nBoyle earned National Coach of the Week honors (Hoops Report, Jan. 10\u201316) after leading the Buffs to a 3\u20130 conference start, including wins over No. 9/8 Missouri and No. 21/20 Kansas State. The win over the Wildcats gave CU its first road win over a nationally ranked opponent since defeating No. 20 Texas Tech in January 1997.

He was able turn all of this into his second 24 win season in a row, a Pac-12 tournament championship and a trip to the NCAA Tournament as a #11 seed where CU advanced to the round of 32 for the first time in 15 years after beating #6 seed [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|UNLV]] 68\u201364 in Albuquerque.

The CEC opened in 1979 and the first game played there was the CU Men's Basketball team hosting the USSR basketball team.  The largest crowd ever to witness a game was on December 5, 2012 when 11,708 people watched CU play [[Colorado State Rams#Basketball|CSU]] (CU won the game 70\u201361).   The facility has also hosted its fair share of concerts as Bob Dylan, U2 and Stevie Wonder are some of the artists to have performed there.<ref>Coors Event Center History http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=600&ATCLID=119110</ref>\n\nThe facility was originally named the CU Events/Conference Center and cost $7.7 million to build.  In September 1990, it was renamed the Coors Event Center to honor a $5 million gift from the Adolph Coors Foundation.

He actually works as a security service provider for an [[Prostitution in South Korea|illegal prostitution business]] under the name \"Uncle\" with the help of Lee Whang-chul, also called \"Old Man\", who protects the sex workers and transfers the money to Ji-soo. His classmate Seo Min-hee is one of the workers, though she does not know who \"Uncle\" is. One weekend, Ji-soo has a study project to do with Bae Gyu-ri, a girl he has a crush on, and thus tells Mr. Lee to take the day off. Knowing that she won't be protected, Min-hee still accepts the offer of a client unaware that he had previously assaulted one of the sex workers and that she is walking into a trap. She sends the alert and Ji-soo eventually leaves Gyu-ri to save her, calling the police but giving the wrong motel room only to scare the client. The latter takes a picture of Min-hee before leaving and intents to upload it on the high school's website at a [[PC bang]] before he is stopped by Mr. Lee. In a bus, it is revealed that Gyu-ri is the one who stole the expensive phone case that Min-hee had bought for her boyfriend as she receives a message from a potential buyer and tries to resell it at a higher price. Back at school, as Ji-soo is sleeping alone at his desk, Gyu-ri who noticed before that Ji-soo had another phone confirms what she previously saw. \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = Episode 2\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = Gyu-ri steals Ji-soo's business phone, finds the password and starts blackmailing him. Through the app, Gyu-ri accepts Min-hee's request to go to a client's room where she has a panic attack due to her [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] and requires Mr. Lee's help. Ji-soo starts tracking his second phone, having a violent encounter with Ki-tae \u2013 Min-hee's bully boyfriend \u2013 in the process, but Gyu-ri outsmarts him. Ji-soo's father wants to take him to [[Ulsan]] where he now lives but his son sees that he is only doing so because he needs money. Afraid of leaving his home because the blackmailer threatened to expose him, Ji-soo is visited by Gyu-ri who finds a way to make him leave the apartment and searches for the money. She hides when Ji-soo's father sneaks into the apartment and accidentally discovers the money before stealing it. She chases him, in vain. In the street, Ji-soo sees his father fleeing with the money and discovers that Gyu-ri is the blackmailer. The following day, she tells her classmates that Ji-soo is her boyfriend in order to stop Ki-tae from bullying him. She takes Ji-soo to a baseball [[batting cage]] and shows off her muscly friends, offering him to recruit them to expand his business and make up for the loss of money.\n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |Title           = Episode 3\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = Gyu-ri follows Ji-soo to Ulsan where they break into Ji-soo's father's house and search for the stolen money but find nothing. Gyu-ri argues that Ji-soo is a [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]] but he insists that he is only a security service provider and falls asleep after she refuses to explain why she needs money when her family is rich. In the morning, they catch Ji-soo's father and learn that he invested all the money in [[cryptocurrency]]. They witness as he looses more than 90% of the money and Ji-soo glares at a kitchen knife but restrains himself from stabbing his father. Back in Seoul, Ji-soo is struggling financially and cannot pay Mr. Lee who refuses to work until he receives his monthly payment. Mr. Lee tries to convince Min-hee to stop working but she refuses, and when Sung-mi \u2013 Min-hee's colleague who was assaulted by the same client \u2013 pressures other sex workers to look for another security service provider, Min-hee says she will only work with Mr. Lee who himself will only work with Uncle. Gyu-ri offers money to Ji-soo in exchange for a partnership in his business but he refuses. After failing his midterm exam, because he had to work part-time and was too mentally and physically exhausted to study, Ji-soo has a breakdown and hits his classmate Chae-bin in the face before accepting Ji-soo's offer.\n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 4\n |Title           = Episode 4\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n

He actually works as a security service provider for an [[Prostitution in South Korea|illegal prostitution business]] under the name \"Uncle\" with the help of Lee Whang-chul, also called \"Old Man\", who protects the sex workers and transfers the money to Ji-soo. His classmate Seo Min-hee is one of the workers, though she does not know who \"Uncle\" is. One weekend, Ji-soo has a study project to do with Bae Gyu-ri, a girl he has a crush on, and thus tells Mr. Lee to take the day off. Knowing that she won't be protected, Min-hee still accepts the offer of a client unaware that he had previously assaulted one of the sex workers and that she is walking into a trap. She sends the alert and Ji-soo eventually leaves Gyu-ri to save her, calling the police but giving the wrong motel room only to scare the client. The latter takes a picture of Min-hee before leaving and intents to upload it on the high school's website at a [[PC bang]] before he is stopped by Mr. Lee. In a bus, it is revealed that Gyu-ri is the one who stole the expensive phone case that Min-hee had bought for her boyfriend as she receives a message from a potential buyer and tries to resell it at a higher price. Back at school, as Ji-soo is sleeping alone at his desk, Gyu-ri who noticed before that Ji-soo had another phone confirms what she previously saw. \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = Episode 2\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = Gyu-ri steals Ji-soo's business phone, finds the password and starts blackmailing him. Through the app, Gyu-ri accepts Min-hee's request to go to a client's room where she has a panic attack due to her [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] and requires Mr. Lee's help. Ji-soo starts tracking his second phone, having a violent encounter with Ki-tae \u2013 Min-hee's bully boyfriend \u2013 in the process, but Gyu-ri outsmarts him. Ji-soo's father wants to take him to [[Ulsan]] where he now lives but his son sees that he is only doing so because he needs money. Afraid of leaving his home because the blackmailer threatened to expose him, Ji-soo is visited by Gyu-ri who finds a way to make him leave the apartment and searches for the money. She hides when Ji-soo's father sneaks into the apartment and accidentally discovers the money before stealing it. She chases him, in vain. In the street, Ji-soo sees his father fleeing with the money and discovers that Gyu-ri is the blackmailer. The following day, she tells her classmates that Ji-soo is her boyfriend in order to stop Ki-tae from bullying him. She takes Ji-soo to a baseball [[batting cage]] and shows off her muscly friends, offering him to recruit them to expand his business and make up for the loss of money.\n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |Title           = Episode 3\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = Gyu-ri follows Ji-soo to Ulsan where they break into Ji-soo's father's house and search for the stolen money but find nothing. Gyu-ri argues that Ji-soo is a [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]] but he insists that he is only a security service provider and falls asleep after she refuses to explain why she needs money when her family is rich. In the morning, they catch Ji-soo's father and learn that he invested all the money in [[cryptocurrency]]. They witness as he looses more than 90% of the money and Ji-soo glares at a kitchen knife but restrains himself from stabbing his father. Back in Seoul, Ji-soo is struggling financially and cannot pay Mr. Lee who refuses to work until he receives his monthly payment. Mr. Lee tries to convince Min-hee to stop working but she refuses, and when Sung-mi \u2013 Min-hee's colleague who was assaulted by the same client \u2013 pressures other sex workers to look for another security service provider, Min-hee says she will only work with Mr. Lee who himself will only work with Uncle. Gyu-ri offers money to Ji-soo in exchange for a partnership in his business but he refuses. After failing his midterm exam, because he had to work part-time and was too mentally and physically exhausted to study, he has a breakdown and hits a classmate, Chae-bin, in the face, before accepting Ji-soo's offer.\n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 4\n |Title           = Episode 4\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |Title           = Episode 5\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |Title           = Episode 6\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 7\n |Title           = Episode 7\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 8\n |Title           = Episode 8\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 9\n |Title           = Episode 9\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 10\n |Title           = Episode 10\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe series is written by [[Song Ji-na]]'s son Jin Han-sae, directed by {{illm|Kim Jin-min|ko|\uae40\uc9c4\ubbfc (\uc5f0\ucd9c\uac00)}} (''[[Time Between Dog and Wolf]]'', ''[[Road No. 1]]'', ''[[Lawless Lawyer]]''), and produced by Studio 329, the same company behind [[YouTube Premium]]'s first and only Korean original series ''[[Top Management (TV series)|Top Management]]''.\n\n===Filming===\nFilming ended on August 6, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Park|first1=So-hee|url=https://entertain.v.daum.net/v/20190807164206994|date=August 7, 2019|work=Daum|title=\uae40\ub3d9\ud76c, '\uc778\uac04\uc218\uc5c5' \ucd2c\uc601 \ub05d \"\ud568\uaed8 \ud574\uc900 \uc2a4\ud15d\ub4e4 \uac10\uc0ac\ud574\uc694\"|language=ko|accessdate=August 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* ''[https://www.netflix.com/title/80990668 Extracurricular]'' on [[Netflix]]\n* {{IMDb title|tt10262630}}\n* {{Hancinema drama|Human_Lessons}}\n\n{{Netflix original series}}\n\n[[Category:Korean-language Netflix original programming]]\n[[Category:2020s South Korean television series]]\n[[Category:2020 South Korean television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Teen drama television series]]\n[[Category:South Korean crime television series]]\n[[Category:Prostitution in television]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Seoul]]\n", "name_user": "Seokgjin", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEpisodes", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracurricular_(TV_series)"}

The first computer-animated film by DreamWorks Animation to be produced at their [[Glendale, California|Glendale]] studio, the film stars the voices of [[Smith]], [[L De Niro]], [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]], [[Jack ]], [[Angelina Jolie]], and [[Martin Scorsese]] (in his only voice acting role) while [[Ziggy Marley]], [[Doug E. Doug]], [[Michael Imperioli]], [[Vincent Pastore]], [[Peter Falk]], and [[Katie Couric]] voice the film's secondary characters. It tells the story of a fish named Oscar (Smith) who falsely claims to have killed Frankie (Imperioli), the son of a shark mob boss named Don Lino (De Nirolup with the mobster's other son Lenny (Black) to keep up the other facade.\n\n''Shark Tale'' premiered at the [[Venice Film Festival]] on September 10, 2004, and was theatrically released by [[DreamWorks Pictures]] on October 1. The film was a box office success and opened at #1 with $47.6 million, which was the second-highest opening for a DreamWorks Animation film at the time, behind ''[[Shrek 2]]'' ($108 million). It remained as the #1 film in the U.S. and Canada for its second and third weekends, and made $367 million worldwide against its $75 million budget. It was also nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]], losing to ''[[The Incredibles]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the Southside Reef, a [[bluestreak cleaner wrasse]] named Oscar fantasizes about being rich and famous. Soon after arriving for work at the Whale Wash, he is called to the office of his boss, a [[Tetraodontidae|pufferfish]] named Sykes, to discuss the fact that he owes a large sum of money and must pay it back by the next day. He remembers being humiliated as a child because his father was a tongue scrubber, so his [[Pomacanthidae|angelfish]] best friend, Angie, offers him a shiny pink pearl that was a gift from her grandmother to pawn and pay his debt. Oscar brings the money to the race track to meet Sykes, but hears that the race is rigged and bets it all on a [[seahorse]] named \"Lucky Day\". Sykes is annoyed that Oscar bet the money but agrees to see how the race turns out. Moments before Lucky Day crosses the finish line, he trips and loses.\n\nMeanwhile, a family of criminally-inclined sharks which has associates such as killer whales, swordfish, and octopuses has a problem with one of their sons, Lenny, who is a vegetarian and refuses to act the part of a killer. His crime lord father, Don Edward Lino, orders his violent eldest son, Frankie, to mentor his brother in the family business. Frankie sees Oscar left for dead in the middle of the ocean by Sykes' two jellyfish enforcers, Ernie and Bernie, and urges Lenny to eat Oscar, but Lenny instead frees Oscar and tells him to escape. Furious, Frankie charges at Oscar, but suddenly an anchor falls on his head, killing him. Devastated and frightened, Lenny flees. As there were no other witnesses and Oscar was seen near the body, everyone comes to believe that he killed Frankie, an opportunity that Oscar decides to exploit for fame.\n\nOscar returns to the city with a new title of \"Sharkslayer\". Sykes becomes his manager and Oscar moves to the \"top of the reef\" to live in luxury. At the same time, Don Lino has everyone search for Lenny. When several sharks approach Oscar's neighborhood, his neighbors expect him to drive them away so he goes and encounters Lenny. Since he does not wish to return home, Lenny begs Oscar to let him stay at Oscar's house. Soon, Angie finds out about the lie and threatens to tell everyone. Oscar and Lenny stage an event in which Lenny pretends to terrorize the town and Oscar defeats him. Though this further cements Oscar's reputation and causes the beautiful, but vindictive Lola to become his girlfriend, it infuriates Don Lino. Afterwards, Oscar and an angered Angie get into an argument, where she reveals that she had feelings for Oscar even before he became the \"Sharkslayer\", causing Oscar to dump Lola and reflect on the consequences of his selfishness.\n\nSoon, Oscar buys some gifts for Angie, only to discover that Don Lino has kidnapped her to stage a meeting. Lenny attends disguised as a dolphin named Sebastian. Don Lino threatens to eat Angie if Oscar does not comply. Lenny grabs Angie into his mouth, but later regurgitates her and unintentionally reveals himself in front of everyone. Enraged, Don Lino chases Oscar through the reef. Oscar heads for the Whale Wash and ends up trapping Don Lino and (by accident) Lenny in the machinery. Oscar is given an ovation by everyone, but he finally confesses the truth behind Frankie's death. He then tells Don Lino that everyone likes Lenny for who he is and urges him to respect everyone's individual choices. Inspired by Oscar's confession, Don Lino reconciles with his son and states that he and his gang bear the city no ill will. Oscar forsakes all the wealth he has acquired, makes peace with the sharks, becomes co-manager of the Whale Wash (now frequented by sharks, killer whales, and swordfish), and lives happily ever after with Angie.\n\nIn the mid-credits, Lola shows up at Oscar's apartment to apologize only to encounter Crazy Joe, Oscar's eccentric hermit crab neighbor.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Will Smith]] as Oscar, a comical street wise bluestreak cleaner wrasse who works in the Whale Wash of Reef City who wants to be rich, but his schemes always fail and he ends up in-debt to his boss with five thousand clams.\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Don Edward Lino, a shark and leader of a mob consisting of criminally-inclined great white sharks, who wants his two sons to take over his business and run it together, but becomes enraged when Oscar inadvertently gets in the way following one of his sons' death.

The first computer-animated film by DreamWorks Animation to be produced at their [[Glendale, California|Glendale]] studio, the film stars the voices of [[Will Smith]], [[Robert De Niro]], [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]], [[Jack Black]], [[Angelina Jolie]], and [[Martin Scorsese]] (in his only voice acting role) while [[Ziggy Marley]], [[Doug E. Doug]], [[Michael Imperioli]], [[Vincent Pastore]], [[Peter Falk]], and [[Katie Couric]] voice the film's secondary characters. It tells the story of a fish named Oscar (Smith) who falsely claims to have killed Frankie (Imperioli), the son of a shark mob boss named Don Lino (De Niro) to advance his own community standing and teams up with the mobster's other son Lenny (Black) to keep up the other facade.\n\n''Shark Tale'' premiered at the [[Venice Film Festival]] on September 10, 2004, and was theatrically released by [[DreamWorks Pictures]] on October 1. The film was a box office success and opened at #1 with $47.6 million, which was the second-highest opening for a DreamWorks Animation film at the time, behind ''[[Shrek 2]]'' ($108 million). It remained as the #1 film in the U.S. and Canada for its second and third weekends, and made $367 million worldwide against its $75 million budget. It was also nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]], losing to ''[[The Incredibles]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the Southside Reef, a [[bluestreak cleaner wrasse]] named Oscar fantasizes about being rich and famous. Soon after arriving for work at the Whale Wash, he is called to the office of his boss, a [[Tetraodontidae|pufferfish]] named Sykes, to discuss the fact that he owes a large sum of money and must pay it back by the next day. He remembers being humiliated as a child because his father was a tongue scrubber, so his [[Pomacanthidae|angelfish]] best friend, Angie, offers him a shiny pink pearl that was a gift from her grandmother to pawn and pay his debt. Oscar brings the money to the race track to meet Sykes, but hears that the race is rigged and bets it all on a [[seahorse]] named \"Lucky Day\". Sykes is annoyed that Oscar bet the money but agrees to see how the race turns out. Moments before Lucky Day crosses the finish line, he trips and loses.\n\nMeanwhile, a family of criminally-inclined sharks which has associates such as killer whales, swordfish, and octopuses has a problem with one of their sons, Lenny, who is a vegetarian and refuses to act the part of a killer. His crime lord father, Don Edward Lino, orders his violent eldest son, Frankie, to mentor his brother in the family business. Frankie sees Oscar left for dead in the middle of the ocean by Sykes' two jellyfish enforcers, Ernie and Bernie, and urges Lenny to eat Oscar, but Lenny instead frees Oscar and tells him to escape. Furious, Frankie charges at Oscar, but suddenly an anchor falls on his head, killing him. Devastated and frightened, Lenny flees. As there were no other witnesses and Oscar was seen near the body, everyone comes to believe that he killed Frankie, an opportunity that Oscar decides to exploit for fame.\n\nOscar returns to the city with a new title of \"Sharkslayer\". Sykes becomes his manager and Oscar moves to the \"top of the reef\" to live in luxury. At the same time, Don Lino has everyone search for Lenny. When several sharks approach Oscar's neighborhood, his neighbors expect him to drive them away so he goes and encounters Lenny. Since he does not wish to return home, Lenny begs Oscar to let him stay at Oscar's house. Soon, Angie finds out about the lie and threatens to tell everyone. Oscar and Lenny stage an event in which Lenny pretends to terrorize the town and Oscar defeats him. Though this further cements Oscar's reputation and causes the beautiful, but vindictive Lola to become his girlfriend, it infuriates Don Lino. Afterwards, Oscar and an angered Angie get into an argument, where she reveals that she had feelings for Oscar even before he became the \"Sharkslayer\", causing Oscar to dump Lola and reflect on the consequences of his selfishness.\n\nSoon, Oscar buys some gifts for Angie, only to discover that Don Lino has kidnapped her to stage a meeting. Lenny attends disguised as a dolphin named Sebastian. Don Lino threatens to eat Angie if Oscar does not comply. Lenny grabs Angie into his mouth, but later regurgitates her and unintentionally reveals himself in front of everyone. Enraged, Don Lino chases Oscar through the reef. Oscar heads for the Whale Wash and ends up trapping Don Lino and (by accident) Lenny in the machinery. Oscar is given an ovation by everyone, but he finally confesses the truth behind Frankie's death. He then tells Don Lino that everyone likes Lenny for who he is and urges him to respect everyone's individual choices. Inspired by Oscar's confession, Don Lino reconciles with his son and states that he and his gang bear the city no ill will. Oscar forsakes all the wealth he has acquired, makes peace with the sharks, becomes co-manager of the Whale Wash (now frequented by sharks, killer whales, and swordfish), and lives happily ever after with Angie.\n\nIn the mid-credits, Lola shows up at Oscar's apartment to apologize only to encounter Crazy Joe, Oscar's eccentric hermit crab neighbor.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Will Smith]] as Oscar, a comical street wise bluestreak cleaner wrasse who works in the Whale Wash of Reef City who wants to be rich, but his schemes always fail and he ends up in-debt to his boss with five thousand clams.\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Don Edward Lino, a shark and leader of a mob consisting of criminally-inclined great white sharks, who wants his two sons to take over his business and run it together, but becomes enraged when Oscar inadvertently gets in the way following one of his sons' death.
