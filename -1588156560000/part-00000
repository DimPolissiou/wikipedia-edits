Chagang was formed in 1949, after being demarcated from North Pyongan.  The provincial capital is [[Kanggye]]. Chagang is the only province of North Korea which is completely inaccessible to tourists.\n\n==Geography==\nChagang Province is located in the northwestern part of [[Korea]]. It is a mountainous province; with the mountainous area amounting to 98 per cent of its total area. The mean height above sea level is 750 meters and the slope of most regions is 15 to 40 degrees.\n\nThe province has a distinct continental climate under the influence of the [[Asia]]n continent. It has very cold and long winters, and brief springs and falls. The climate is characterized by great differences in daily and yearly temperature. In summer, downpours of rain and hail are frequent. Thus thunder and lightning occur frequently.\n\nThe province has great mineral wealth, and is North Korea's main source of [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[gold]], [[copper]], [[molybdenum]], [[tungsten]], [[antimony]], [[graphite]], [[apatite]], [[alunite]], [[limestone]], [[calcium carbonate]], [[anthracite]] and [[iron]] ores. There are also [[crystals]] and valuable [[Gemstone|gems]] there.\n\n==Main cities and economic activities==\nThe province abounds in underground, forest and water resources. Before the [[Korean War]], Chagang province was an isolated land with only two primitive mines, one timber mill and a distillery.\n\nNowadays, it has power, machine, chemical, light, mining and timber industries. Its total industrial output is 1000 times as much as just before the war.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nThe majority of North Korea's underground military industrial facilities are located in Chagang Province,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fas.org/irp/world/rok/nis-docs/defense09.htm|title=Defense|publisher=Federation of American Scientists|accessdate=October 11, 2013}}</ref> including portions of their [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nti.org/gsn/article/north-korea-expanding-wmd-production-capabilities-south-lawmaker/|title=North Korea Expanding WMD Production Capabilities|publisher=Nuclear Threat Initiative |date=October 27, 2011|accessdate=October 11, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Kanggye]] is the capital city of Chagang Province.

Its development dates back to the [[Korean War]], when it became one of the cities of industrial relocation, as it was isolated and far from the main battlefields.\n\nNowadays, Huichon has several industries, such as a huge [[Korea General Machinery Trading Corporation|machine tool factory]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190945/http://www.kcckp.net/en/news/news_view.php?0+4931 silk mill] and a [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930050155/http://www.kcckp.net/en/periodic/korea/index.php?contents+1308+2006-03+49+12 hard glassware factory]. In Huichon there is the main North Korean [[Huichon University of Telecommunications|University of Telecommunications]].\n\nChagang was one of the less developed and isolated provinces in [[North Korea]] after liberation in 1945. The terrain made farming difficult and only slash-and-burn farmers tilled mountain plots to eke out a living.\n\nNowadays, farming activities are mainly linked with livestock activities. One example is Hungju Farm.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Fabrica de cristal duro Huichon2.jpg|Huichon Hard Glassware Factory\nImage:F\u00e1brica_m\u00e1quinas-herramienta_Huich\u00f3n (5).jpg|Huichon Machine Tool Factory\nImage:Granja de Pollos Hungju.jpg|Hungju Chicken Farm\n</gallery>\n\n==Small and medium-size power stations==\nThe province has been converted into a power base for the country, with the construction of [[Kanggye Youth Power Station]], [[Unbong Power Station]], [[Jangjagang Power Station]] and other large hydroelectric power stations.\n\nThe province has built since the 90s many small and medium-sized power stations, as a duty of the local authorities. Log-dam, water-course, raft and sluice were among the efficient methods practised in their construction.\n\nSmall hydraulic turbines, with a capacity of 2&nbsp;kW to 70&nbsp;kW, were developed by local technicians to dramatically increase the generating capacity.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nChagang is divided into 3 [[city|cities]] (''si'') and 15 [[county|counties]] (''gun'').\n\n===Cities===\n* [[Kanggye]]-si (\uac15\uacc4\uc2dc;

{{IPA-ko|tsa.\u0261a\u014b.do}}) is a [[Administrative divisions of North Korea|province]] in [[North Korea]]; it is bordered by [[China]]'s [[Jilin]] and [[Liaoning]] provinces to the north, [[Ryanggang]] and [[South Hamgyong]] to the east, [[South Pyongan]] to the south, and [[North Pyongan]] to the west.  Chagang was formed in 1949, after being demarcated from North Pyongan.  The provincial capital is [[Kanggye]]. Chagang is the only province of North Korea which is completely inaccessible to tourists.\n\n==Geography==\nChagang Province is located in the northwestern part of [[Korea]]. It is a mountainous province; with the mountainous area amounting to 98 per cent of its total area. The mean height above sea level is 750 meters and the slope of most regions is 15 to 40 degrees.\n\nThe province has a distinct continental climate under the influence of the [[Asia]]n continent. It has very cold and long winters, and brief springs and falls. The climate is characterized by great differences in daily and yearly temperature. In summer, downpours of rain and hail are frequent. Thus thunder and lightning occur frequently.\n\nThe province has great mineral wealth, and is North Korea's main source of [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[gold]], [[copper]], [[molybdenum]], [[tungsten]], [[antimony]], [[graphite]], [[apatite]], [[alunite]], [[limestone]], [[calcium carbonate]], [[anthracite]] and [[iron]] ores. There are also [[crystals]] and valuable [[Gemstone|gems]] there.\n\n==Main cities and economic activities==\nThe province abounds in underground, forest and water resources. Before the [[Korean War]], Chagang province was an isolated land with only two primitive mines, one timber mill and a distillery.\n\nNowadays, it has power, machine, chemical, light, mining and timber industries. Its total industrial output is 1000 times as much as just before the war.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nThe majority of North Korea's underground military industrial facilities are located in Chagang Province,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fas.org/irp/world/rok/nis-docs/defense09.htm|title=Defense|publisher=Federation of American Scientists|accessdate=October 11, 2013}}</ref> including portions of their [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nti.org/gsn/article/north-korea-expanding-wmd-production-capabilities-south-lawmaker/|title=North Korea Expanding WMD Production Capabilities|publisher=Nuclear Threat Initiative |date=October 27, 2011|accessdate=October 11, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Kanggye]] is the capital city of Chagang Province.

Its development dates back to the [[Korean War]], when it became one of the cities of industrial relocation, as it was isolated and far from the main battlefields.\n\nNowadays, Huichon has several industries, such as a huge [[Korea General Machinery Trading Corporation|machine tool factory]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190945/http://www.kcckp.net/en/news/news_view.php?0+4931 silk mill] and a [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930050155/http://www.kcckp.net/en/periodic/korea/index.php?contents+1308+2006-03+49+12 hard glassware factory]. In Huichon there is the main North Korean [[Huichon University of Telecommunications|University of Telecommunications]].\n\nChagang was one of the less developed and isolated provinces in [[North Korea]] after liberation in 1945. The terrain made farming difficult and only slash-and-burn farmers tilled mountain plots to eke out a living.\n\nNowadays, farming activities are mainly linked with livestock activities. One example is Hungju Farm.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Fabrica de cristal duro Huichon2.jpg|Huichon Hard Glassware Factory\nImage:F\u00e1brica_m\u00e1quinas-herramienta_Huich\u00f3n (5).jpg|Huichon Machine Tool Factory\nImage:Granja de Pollos Hungju.jpg|Hungju Chicken Farm\n</gallery>\n\n==Small and medium-size power stations==\nThe province has been converted into a power base for the country, with the construction of [[Kanggye Youth Power Station]], [[Unbong Power Station]], [[Jangjagang Power Station]] and other large hydroelectric power stations.\n\nThe province has built since the 90s many small and medium-sized power stations, as a duty of the local authorities. Log-dam, water-course, raft and sluice were among the efficient methods practised in their construction.\n\nSmall hydraulic turbines, with a capacity of 2&nbsp;kW to 70&nbsp;kW, were developed by local technicians to dramatically increase the generating capacity.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nChagang is divided into 3 [[city|cities]] (''si'') and 15 [[county|counties]] (''gun'').\n\n===Cities===\n* [[Kanggye]]-si (\uac15\uacc4\uc2dc; \u6c5f\u754c\u5e02; made into \"si\" from \"gun\" December 1949)\n* [[Huichon]]-si (\ud76c\ucc9c\uc2dc; \u7199\u5ddd\u5e02; made into \"si\" October 1967)\n* [[Manpo]]-si (\ub9cc\ud3ec\uc2dc; \u6eff\u6d66\u5e02; made into \"si\" October 1967)\n\n=== Counties ===\n* [[Changgang County]] (\uc7a5\uac15\uad70; \u9577\u6c5f\u90e1)\n* [[Chasong County]] (\uc790\uc131\uad70; \u6148\u57ce\u90e1)\n* [[Chonchon County]] (\uc804\ucc9c\uad70; \u524d\u5ddd\u90e1)\n* [[Chosan County]] (\ucd08\uc0b0\uad70; \u695a\u5c71\u90e1)\n* [[Chunggang County]] (\uc911\uac15\uad70; \u4e2d\u6c5f\u90e1)\n* [[Hwapyong County]] (\ud654\ud3c9\uad70; \u548c\u576a\u90e1)\n* [[Kopung County]] (\uace0\ud48d\uad70; \u53e4\u8c50\u90e1)\n* [[Rangnim County]] (\ub791\ub9bc\uad70; \u72fc\u6797\u90e1)\n* [[Ryongnim County]] (\ub8e1\ub9bc\uad70; \u9f8d\u6797\u90e1)\n* [[Sijung County]] (\uc2dc\uc911\uad70; \u6642\u4e2d\u90e1)\n* [[Songgan County]] (\uc131\uac04\uad70; \u57ce\u5e72\u90e1)\n* [[Songwon County]] (\uc1a1\uc6d0\uad70; \u677e\u539f\u90e1)\n* [[Tongsin County]] (\ub3d9\uc2e0\uad70; \u6771\u65b0\u90e1)\n* [[Usi County]] (\uc6b0\uc2dc\uad70; \u96e9\u6642\u90e1)\n* [[Wiwon County]] (\uc704\uc6d0\uad70; \u6e2d\u539f\u90e1)\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|North Korea}}\n* [[Outline of North Korea]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060109202822/http://nk.chosun.com/map/map.html?ACT=geo_01 \ud589\uc815 \uad6c\uc5ed \ud604\ud669 (''Haengjeong Guyeok Hyeonhwang'')] (in Korean only)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20041018022439/http://www.xzqh.org/waiguo/asia/1002.htm Administrative divisions of North Korea] (in simplified Chinese; used as reference for Hanja)\n* Panorama Korea, Foreign Language Publishing House, Pyongyang, 1999.\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikivoyage|Baekdu Mountains}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040514171020/http://210.145.168.243/pk/084th_issue/9903303.htm The People's Korea: Chagang]\n\n{{Geographic location\n|Centre    = Chagang\n|North     = \n|Northeast = [[Ryanggang]]\n|East      = \n|Southeast = [[South Hamgyong]]\n|South     = [[South Pyongan]]\n|Southwest = [[North Pyongan]]\n|West      = \n|Northwest = {{flagdeco|PRC}} [[Jilin]], China\n}}\n{{Chagang}}\n{{regions and administrative divisions of North Korea}}\n{{coord|40.9706|N|126.5925|E|source:wikidata-and-enwiki-cat-tree_region:KP|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Chagang Province| ]]\n[[Category:Provinces of North Korea]]\n", "name_user": "Rakoon", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagang_Province"}
{"title_page": "Wildlife of Zambia", "text_new": "[[Image:SouthLuangwanationalparklioness.jpg|right|thumb|South Luangwa National Park]]\nThe '''wildlife of Zambia''' refers to the natural [[flora]] and [[fauna]] of [[Zambia]]. This article provides an overview, and outline of the main wildlife areas or regions, and compact lists of animals focusing on prevalence and distribution in the country rather than on taxonomy. More specialized articles on particular groups are linked from here.\n\nWhat do you do when you get home from work \n\n===Biomes and ecoregions===\n{{Main|Ecoregions of Zambia}}\nWildlife ecologists use the [[World Wildlife Fund]]'s classification of biomes and ecoregions. The most widespread in Zambia are those comprising [[miombo]], [[mopane]] and [[Baikiaea]] woodland savanna, with [[grassland]]s (mainly [[Floodplain|flooded grasslands]]) and evergreen forest also present. The chief determinant of the distribution of ecoregions and wildlife is climate, see ''[[Climate of Zambia]]'' for more detail.\n\n===Animals outside the national parks===\nZambia's \"big game\" wildlife (including sports fishing) is the foundation of its tourism industry, now one of its biggest employers and foreign-exchange earners; [[Victoria Falls]] and cultural events come second and third in importance. However for domestic tourism, this order is reversed, and wildlife is not as important, since the national parks and game viewing tours, through which the great majority of the wildlife is experienced, are priced and marketed to international tourism.\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century most of Zambia's rural areas supported wildlife at levels similar to that seen in national parks today, and the 'big five' game animals were widespread outside reserves and parks. Of them today, the [[black rhinoceros|rhinoceros]] is almost extinct, the [[African bush elephant|elephant]] and [[Panthera leo melanochaita|lion]] are found almost exclusively in parks, the [[African buffalo]] is found in or close to parks. Of the other large animals, only the [[spotted hyena]], [[Nile crocodile]], [[hippopotamus]], and [[lechwe]] are found in numbers outside parks, the former from its success as a scavenger, the latter three since their aquatic habit has less overlap with human activities.\n[[Image:Hippo pod edit.jpg|thumb|left|Pod of [[hippopotamus]]es.]]\n\nThe cause of this decline is the [[Demographics of Zambia|four-fold increase]] in human population in the last fifty years and consequent loss of habitat, especially of forest and woodland. Although commercial farming and ranching is responsible for land-clearing and the elimination of carnivores and competing herbivores, the amount of land used commercially is actually small, and the more widespread and less intensive subsistence farming known as ''chitemene'' shifting cultivation is more to blame (responsible for about 9000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of woodland deforestation per year), along with [[charcoal]] production (responsible for about 2000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of woodland deforestation per year).<ref>[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Itigi-Sumbu_thicket World Wildlife Fund; Mark McGinley (2007). \"Itigi-Sumbu thicket.\"] In: ''Encyclopedia of Earth.'' Eds. Cutler J. Cleveland (Washington, D.C.: Environmental Information Coalition, National Council for Science and the Environment). [Published in the Encyclopedia of Earth March 19, 2009; Retrieved November 8, 2007].</ref>\n\nSecondly, poverty has accompanied the population growth. In the economic boom of the 1940s and 1950s, the mines and factories of the [[Copperbelt]] provided wages to pay for food grown commercially on a relatively small amount of land. A large decrease in such employment over the past two or three decades has forced more people back to the rural areas to carry out subsistence agriculture and fishing, which puts pressure on a greater area of wildlife habitat. Increased unreliability of [[rainy season|wet season]] rainfall, perhaps caused by global warming, exacerbates the problem.\n\nThirdly, poor environmental management by government and a certain amount of corruption in some quarters has allowed poaching and uncontrolled exploitation of resources. Some national parks have had no management at all. In previous centuries traditional rulers had greater control of hunting and natural resources, for example [[Lewanika]], king of [[Barotseland]], established the [[Liuwa Plain National Park|Liuwa Plain]] game reserve which today is a national park. The possibility of recruiting chiefs as modern-day managers of natural resources is hampered by rivalries with political leaders, the downgrading of their status and power by government and the erosion of traditional culture by modern materialism.\n\nAgainst this background the animals which continue to flourish in Zambia outside parks are those with little food or other resource value, with less overlap with human habitat, or which can survive in human habitats. These include most birds, except those whose breeding habitats are reduced; smaller mammals, such as [[Chiroptera|bats]], [[shrew]]s, [[rodent]]s, [[mongoose]]s, the nocturnal small [[Felidae|cats]], [[vervet monkey]]s and [[galago]]s; and reptiles such as the [[Nile monitor]] and most snakes and lizards, except forest species.\n\n===Animals in protected areas===\n\n[[Image:Zambia National Parks Map.png|thumb|440px|Map showing Zambia's 20 national parks.]]\n\n{{Main|List of national parks of Zambia}}\n\nFive out of 20 national parks have lost most of their wildlife due to a lack of management. Of the remaining 15, two exist primarily for features other than wildlife (Nyika Plateau and Victoria Falls), and the rest have reasonably good wildlife resources despite some poaching.\n\nNational parks protect 6.4% of the country, and all have larger game management areas (GMAs) as buffer zones around them in which hunting is subject to regulation, as it is in forest reserves which have additional regulations about land clearing and timber harvesting. Adequate patrolling and the enforcing of regulations has always been a problem, and illegal hunting and bush clearing still happens within protected areas.\n\nGMAs cover 15.6% of the country and forest reserves cover 7.2%, so 29.2% of the country is protected in theory (based on 1992 figures).<ref>[ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/004/AC428E/AC428E00.pdf Anne Chileshe, 2001: \"Forestry Outlook Studies in Africa: Zambia.\"] Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism, Lusaka, and FAO, Rome.\n(Source for figures is given as ''Forestry Department, 1992''.)</ref>\n\n==Wildlife regions==\nThe main wildlife-rich areas of the country are:\n\n===[[Northern Province, Zambia|Northern Province]]===\n\n*[[Nsumbu National Park]]/Kaputa GMA/[[Mweru Wantipa National Park]] is a contiguous area stretching from the hills at the north-east end of [[Lake Mweru]] to [[Lake Tanganyika]], rich in wildlife particularly at the eastern end, on the shores of Lake Tanganyika. It has been under pressure due to the [[Second Congo War]] in neighbouring DR Congo and a consequent influx of refugees. Mweru Wantipa has seen an influx of people engaged in fishing, and protection in the west of this region has not been enforced for decades.\n*The transnational waters of [[Lake Tanganyika]] support a great diversity of fish, much of it unique and exploited by the international aquarium trade, as well as crocodile, hippo and aquatic birds. The often precipitous sides of the rift valley extending around the south-eastern extremity of the lake to [[Kalambo Falls]] are also a wildlife habitat for birds, smaller mammals, reptiles and leopards.\n*[[Bangweulu Wetlands]]: these internationally recognised wetlands and their south-eastern buffer zone include [[Lavushi Manda National Park|Lavushi Manda]] and [[Isangano National Park]]s, and the Chambeshi, Luwingu and Bangweulu GMAs. [[Kasanka National Park|Kasanka]] in Central Province is also part of the southern buffer zone. The wetlands are vital for the breeding of a number of bird species and as a feeding ground for migratory birds, as well as for the [[black lechwe]], [[sitatunga]] and numerous large mammals. They are under pressure from poaching, fishing and livestock grazing, and ''chitemene'' cultivation on the margins.\n\n===[[Muchinga Province, Zambia|Muchinga Province]]===\n*Muchinga escarpment overlooking the [[Luangwa Valley]]: the rocky hills and scarps do not host a huge amount of wildlife, but smaller mammals, birds and leopards do make it their home. Although [[North Luangwa National Park|North]] and the northern part of [[South Luangwa National Park]] are technically in the Muchinga Province, primary access to the parks is from Eastern Province so they are covered in that section.\n*[[Nyika National Park, Zambia|Nyika National Park]]: the [[Nyika Plateau]] in the north-east is mostly in [[Malawi]], Zambia's small portion is noted for its montane vegetation, orchids and other vegetation, as well as herds of eland, zebra and other animals such as leopards.\n\n===[[Luapula Province]]===\n\n*[[Lake Mweru]]-[[Luapula River]] system: the Zambian side of this transnational lake and river system has a relatively high human population. Wildlife is restricted mainly to the plentiful bird life, and aquatic animals in the lake and swamps, such as hippos, crocodiles and otters. The [[lechwe]] population which grazed the floodplain mainly on the Congolese side has been hunted out. The lake and swamp lagoons have been heavily fished and stocks depleted.\n*The inaccessible Lusenga Plain National Park on the plateau east of the lake has been heavily depleted by poaching.\n*[[Lake Bangweulu]]: the south-east of Luapula Province extends over the lake and into the swamps: see the wetlands ecosystem under Northern Province, above. Crocodiles are plentiful in the lake which is also home to hippo. The lake fish stocks have been depleted.\n\n===[[Eastern Province, Zambia|Eastern Province]]===\n\n*Most of the Luangwa Valley is protected by national parks or GMAs comprising one of the world's greatest wildlife areas: [[North Luangwa National Park]], [[South Luangwa National Park]], [[Luambe National Park]] and [[Lukusuzi National Park]]s, and Munyamadzi, Musalangu, Mukumgule, Lupande, Lumimba, Sandwe, Chisomo GMAs. Animals are plentiful and mostly well-protected, though poaching of elephant and rhinoceros has been a problem in the recent past.\n*In the Luangwa Valley over 100,000 elephants were killed by poachers in a twelve-year period between 1973-1985. Zambia as a whole lost over 80% of its elephant population during that period.<ref>\"Comments of the Humane Society of the United States Regarding Proposals by Zimbabwe, Botswana, South Africa, Namibia, Malawi, and Zambia to Transfer Populations of the Afreican Elephant from CITES Appendix I to II\" (Humane Society of the United States, January 30, 1992).</ref>\n\n===[[Copperbelt Province]]===\n\nThe most urban and industrial of Zambia's provinces lacks wildlife, except in the south-west where in flooded grassland habitats interspersed with miombo woodland, and except for   birdlife, which is well represented near rivers and small lakes between towns.\n*Chembe Bird Sanctuary west of [[Kitwe]] includes crocodiles and [[sitatunga]] as well as plentiful bird life.\n\n===[[Central Province, Zambia|Central Province]]===\n\n*The north-east of this province reaches the margins of the Bangweulu wetlands - see Northern Province \u2014 and includes [[Kasanka National Park]].\n*The eastern end of the province reaches South Luangwa National Park but the latter's access is in Eastern Province, see above.\n*[[Kafue National Park]] and the Mulobezi, Sichifulo, Mumbwa, Kasonso-Busanga, Lunga-Luswishi, Namwala, Bilili Springs, and Nkala GMAs are the second most important wildlife area in the country, so large that it is spread across two other provinces \u2014 Southern and North Western. The Busanga Swamps and plain in the north hosts the largest concentration of mammals and birds, while the Kafue River and lake of the [[Itezhi-Tezhi Dam]] are home to hippos, crocodiles and aquatic birds as well as being well stocked with fish.\n*The northern part of the [[Kafue Flats]] and [[Blue Lagoon National Park]] are in Central Province, but are treated under Southern Province, below.\n*The [[Lunsemfwa River|Lunsemfwa]] and [[Lukusashi River]] valleys and their northern escarpment, at the western end of the Luangwa Valley, lie in Central Province and represent a wildlife area with some potential, protected by GMAs to some extent.\n*[[Lukanga Swamp]] bordering the Lunga-Luswishi GMA and its less populated western margin is potentially a wildlife haven, especially for aquatic birds and animals, but is heavily fished.\n\n===[[Lusaka Province]]===\n\n*[[Lower Zambezi National Park]] and adjacent Chiawa, Luano, and Rufunsa GMAs make up the third most important wildlife region, with most of the Zambian fauna represented. The Zambezi river also provides aquatic habitats. The opposite bank of the river in [[Zimbabwe]] is also national park and animals may cross the river.\n*The southern side of the Lunsemfwa River valley and the lower Luangwa valley border Lusaka province, and provide good wildlife habitats protected by GMAs.\n*The [[Kafue Flats]] extend slightly into the south-western part of Lusaka Province, but are treated under Southern Province, below.\n*[[Lusaka National Park]], a small wildlife reserve established in 2011.\n\n===[[North-Western Province, Zambia|North-Western Province]]===\n\n* Game-rich Busanga in Kafue National Park is part of North-Western Province and animals from the park range into the Kasonso-Busanga GMA.\n* West Lunga National Park and its adjacent Chibwika-Ntambo, Lukwakwa and Musele-Matebo GMAs are undeveloped and have been depleted but hold promise for recovery.\n*The western extremity of the province include the Zambezi and its floodplain, treated under Western Province, below.\n\n===[[Western Province, Zambia|Western Province]]===\n\n*The [[Zambezi River]] and its wide [[Barotse Floodplain]] represent a vast fish and aquatic wildlife habitat, important also for many grazing animals and birds. Islands in the river and floodplain present habitats where birds may nest with relative freedom from predators.\n*The [[Liuwa Plain National Park|Liuwa Plain]] and [[Sioma Ngwezi National Park]]s and the vast West Zambezi GMA comprise plains which are home to thousands of grazing animals.

This article provides an overview, and outline of the main wildlife areas or regions, and compact lists of animals focusing on prevalence and distribution in the country rather than on taxonomy. More specialized articles on particular groups are linked from here.\n\n==Overview==\n\n===Biomes and ecoregions===\n{{Main|Ecoregions of Zambia}}\nWildlife ecologists use the [[World Wildlife Fund]]'s classification of biomes and ecoregions. The most widespread in Zambia are those comprising [[miombo]], [[mopane]] and [[Baikiaea]] woodland savanna, with [[grassland]]s (mainly [[Floodplain|flooded grasslands]]) and evergreen forest also present. The chief determinant of the distribution of ecoregions and wildlife is climate, see ''[[Climate of Zambia]]'' for more detail.\n\n===Animals outside the national parks===\nZambia's \"big game\" wildlife (including sports fishing) is the foundation of its tourism industry, now one of its biggest employers and foreign-exchange earners; [[Victoria Falls]] and cultural events come second and third in importance. However for domestic tourism, this order is reversed, and wildlife is not as important, since the national parks and game viewing tours, through which the great majority of the wildlife is experienced, are priced and marketed to international tourism.\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century most of Zambia's rural areas supported wildlife at levels similar to that seen in national parks today, and the 'big five' game animals were widespread outside reserves and parks. Of them today, the [[black rhinoceros|rhinoceros]] is almost extinct, the [[African bush elephant|elephant]] and [[Panthera leo melanochaita|lion]] are found almost exclusively in parks, the [[African buffalo]] is found in or close to parks. Of the other large animals, only the [[spotted hyena]], [[Nile crocodile]], [[hippopotamus]], and [[lechwe]] are found in numbers outside parks, the former from its success as a scavenger, the latter three since their aquatic habit has less overlap with human activities.\n[[Image:Hippo pod edit.jpg|thumb|left|Pod of [[hippopotamus]]es.]]\n\nThe cause of this decline is the [[Demographics of Zambia|four-fold increase]] in human population in the last fifty years and consequent loss of habitat, especially of forest and woodland. Although commercial farming and ranching is responsible for land-clearing and the elimination of carnivores and competing herbivores, the amount of land used commercially is actually small, and the more widespread and less intensive subsistence farming known as ''chitemene'' shifting cultivation is more to blame (responsible for about 9000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of woodland deforestation per year), along with [[charcoal]] production (responsible for about 2000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of woodland deforestation per year).<ref>[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Itigi-Sumbu_thicket World Wildlife Fund; Mark McGinley (2007). \"Itigi-Sumbu thicket.\"] In: ''Encyclopedia of Earth.'' Eds. Cutler J. Cleveland (Washington, D.C.: Environmental Information Coalition, National Council for Science and the Environment). [Published in the Encyclopedia of Earth March 19, 2009; Retrieved November 8, 2007].</ref>\n\nSecondly, poverty has accompanied the population growth. In the economic boom of the 1940s and 1950s, the mines and factories of the [[Copperbelt]] provided wages to pay for food grown commercially on a relatively small amount of land. A large decrease in such employment over the past two or three decades has forced more people back to the rural areas to carry out subsistence agriculture and fishing, which puts pressure on a greater area of wildlife habitat. Increased unreliability of [[rainy season|wet season]] rainfall, perhaps caused by global warming, exacerbates the problem.\n\nThirdly, poor environmental management by government and a certain amount of corruption in some quarters has allowed poaching and uncontrolled exploitation of resources. Some national parks have had no management at all. In previous centuries traditional rulers had greater control of hunting and natural resources, for example [[Lewanika]], king of [[Barotseland]], established the [[Liuwa Plain National Park|Liuwa Plain]] game reserve which today is a national park. The possibility of recruiting chiefs as modern-day managers of natural resources is hampered by rivalries with political leaders, the downgrading of their status and power by government and the erosion of traditional culture by modern materialism.\n\nAgainst this background the animals which continue to flourish in Zambia outside parks are those with little food or other resource value, with less overlap with human habitat, or which can survive in human habitats. These include most birds, except those whose breeding habitats are reduced; smaller mammals, such as [[Chiroptera|bats]], [[shrew]]s, [[rodent]]s, [[mongoose]]s, the nocturnal small [[Felidae|cats]], [[vervet monkey]]s and [[galago]]s; and reptiles such as the [[Nile monitor]] and most snakes and lizards, except forest species.\n\n===Animals in protected areas===\n\n[[Image:Zambia National Parks Map.png|thumb|440px|Map showing Zambia's 20 national parks.]]\n\n{{Main|List of national parks of Zambia}}\n\nFive out of 20 national parks have lost most of their wildlife due to a lack of management. Of the remaining 15, two exist primarily for features other than wildlife (Nyika Plateau and Victoria Falls), and the rest have reasonably good wildlife resources despite some poaching.\n\nNational parks protect 6.4% of the country, and all have larger game management areas (GMAs) as buffer zones around them in which hunting is subject to regulation, as it is in forest reserves which have additional regulations about land clearing and timber harvesting. Adequate patrolling and the enforcing of regulations has always been a problem, and illegal hunting and bush clearing still happens within protected areas.\n\nGMAs cover 15.6% of the country and forest reserves cover 7.2%, so 29.2% of the country is protected in theory (based on 1992 figures).<ref>[ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/004/AC428E/AC428E00.pdf Anne Chileshe, 2001: \"Forestry Outlook Studies in Africa: Zambia.\"] Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism, Lusaka, and FAO, Rome.\n(Source for figures is given as ''Forestry Department, 1992''.)</ref>\n\n==Wildlife regions==\nThe main wildlife-rich areas of the country are:\n\n===[[Northern Province, Zambia|Northern Province]]===\n\n*[[Nsumbu National Park]]/Kaputa GMA/[[Mweru Wantipa National Park]] is a contiguous area stretching from the hills at the north-east end of [[Lake Mweru]] to [[Lake Tanganyika]], rich in wildlife particularly at the eastern end, on the shores of Lake Tanganyika. It has been under pressure due to the [[Second Congo War]] in neighbouring DR Congo and a consequent influx of refugees. Mweru Wantipa has seen an influx of people engaged in fishing, and protection in the west of this region has not been enforced for decades.\n*The transnational waters of [[Lake Tanganyika]] support a great diversity of fish, much of it unique and exploited by the international aquarium trade, as well as crocodile, hippo and aquatic birds. The often precipitous sides of the rift valley extending around the south-eastern extremity of the lake to [[Kalambo Falls]] are also a wildlife habitat for birds, smaller mammals, reptiles and leopards.\n*[[Bangweulu Wetlands]]: these internationally recognised wetlands and their south-eastern buffer zone include [[Lavushi Manda National Park|Lavushi Manda]] and [[Isangano National Park]]s, and the Chambeshi, Luwingu and Bangweulu GMAs. [[Kasanka National Park|Kasanka]] in Central Province is also part of the southern buffer zone. The wetlands are vital for the breeding of a number of bird species and as a feeding ground for migratory birds, as well as for the [[black lechwe]], [[sitatunga]] and numerous large mammals. They are under pressure from poaching, fishing and livestock grazing, and ''chitemene'' cultivation on the margins.\n\n===[[Muchinga Province, Zambia|Muchinga Province]]===\n*Muchinga escarpment overlooking the [[Luangwa Valley]]: the rocky hills and scarps do not host a huge amount of wildlife, but smaller mammals, birds and leopards do make it their home. Although [[North Luangwa National Park|North]] and the northern part of [[South Luangwa National Park]] are technically in the Muchinga Province, primary access to the parks is from Eastern Province so they are covered in that section.\n*[[Nyika National Park, Zambia|Nyika National Park]]: the [[Nyika Plateau]] in the north-east is mostly in [[Malawi]], Zambia's small portion is noted for its montane vegetation, orchids and other vegetation, as well as herds of eland, zebra and other animals such as leopards.\n\n===[[Luapula Province]]===\n\n*[[Lake Mweru]]-[[Luapula River]] system: the Zambian side of this transnational lake and river system has a relatively high human population. Wildlife is restricted mainly to the plentiful bird life, and aquatic animals in the lake and swamps, such as hippos, crocodiles and otters. The [[lechwe]] population which grazed the floodplain mainly on the Congolese side has been hunted out. The lake and swamp lagoons have been heavily fished and stocks depleted.\n*The inaccessible Lusenga Plain National Park on the plateau east of the lake has been heavily depleted by poaching.\n*[[Lake Bangweulu]]: the south-east of Luapula Province extends over the lake and into the swamps: see the wetlands ecosystem under Northern Province, above. Crocodiles are plentiful in the lake which is also home to hippo. The lake fish stocks have been depleted.\n\n===[[Eastern Province, Zambia|Eastern Province]]===\n\n*Most of the Luangwa Valley is protected by national parks or GMAs comprising one of the world's greatest wildlife areas: [[North Luangwa National Park]], [[South Luangwa National Park]], [[Luambe National Park]] and [[Lukusuzi National Park]]s, and Munyamadzi, Musalangu, Mukumgule, Lupande, Lumimba, Sandwe, Chisomo GMAs. Animals are plentiful and mostly well-protected, though poaching of elephant and rhinoceros has been a problem in the recent past.\n*In the Luangwa Valley over 100,000 elephants were killed by poachers in a twelve-year period between 1973-1985. Zambia as a whole lost over 80% of its elephant population during that period.<ref>\"Comments of the Humane Society of the United States Regarding Proposals by Zimbabwe, Botswana, South Africa, Namibia, Malawi, and Zambia to Transfer Populations of the Afreican Elephant from CITES Appendix I to II\" (Humane Society of the United States, January 30, 1992).</ref>\n\n===[[Copperbelt Province]]===\n\nThe most urban and industrial of Zambia's provinces lacks wildlife, except in the south-west where in flooded grassland habitats interspersed with miombo woodland, and except for   birdlife, which is well represented near rivers and small lakes between towns.\n*Chembe Bird Sanctuary west of [[Kitwe]] includes crocodiles and [[sitatunga]] as well as plentiful bird life.\n\n===[[Central Province, Zambia|Central Province]]===\n\n*The north-east of this province reaches the margins of the Bangweulu wetlands - see Northern Province \u2014 and includes [[Kasanka National Park]].\n*The eastern end of the province reaches South Luangwa National Park but the latter's access is in Eastern Province, see above.\n*[[Kafue National Park]] and the Mulobezi, Sichifulo, Mumbwa, Kasonso-Busanga, Lunga-Luswishi, Namwala, Bilili Springs, and Nkala GMAs are the second most important wildlife area in the country, so large that it is spread across two other provinces \u2014 Southern and North Western. The Busanga Swamps and plain in the north hosts the largest concentration of mammals and birds, while the Kafue River and lake of the [[Itezhi-Tezhi Dam]] are home to hippos, crocodiles and aquatic birds as well as being well stocked with fish.\n*The northern part of the [[Kafue Flats]] and [[Blue Lagoon National Park]] are in Central Province, but are treated under Southern Province, below.\n*The [[Lunsemfwa River|Lunsemfwa]] and [[Lukusashi River]] valleys and their northern escarpment, at the western end of the Luangwa Valley, lie in Central Province and represent a wildlife area with some potential, protected by GMAs to some extent.\n*[[Lukanga Swamp]] bordering the Lunga-Luswishi GMA and its less populated western margin is potentially a wildlife haven, especially for aquatic birds and animals, but is heavily fished.\n\n===[[Lusaka Province]]===\n\n*[[Lower Zambezi National Park]] and adjacent Chiawa, Luano, and Rufunsa GMAs make up the third most important wildlife region, with most of the Zambian fauna represented. The Zambezi river also provides aquatic habitats.

Therefore, intracellular proteins do not need to develop acid stability through evolution. However, other acidophiles, such as ''[[Acetobacter]] aceti'', have an acidified cytoplasm which forces nearly all proteins in the genome to evolve acid stability.<ref>{{cite journal\n|author=Menzel, U.\n|author2=Gottschalk, G.\n|date=1985\n|volume=143\n|title=The internal pH of ''Acetobacterium wieringae'' and ''Acetobacter aceti'' during growth and production of acetic acid\n|issue=1\n|journal=Arch Microbiol\n|pages=47\u201351\n|doi=10.1007/BF00414767\n}}</ref> For this reason, ''Acetobacter aceti'' has become a valuable resource for understanding the mechanisms by which proteins can attain acid stability.\n\nStudies of proteins adapted to low pH have revealed a few general mechanisms by which proteins can achieve acid stability.  In most acid stable proteins (such as pepsin and the [[soxF]] [[protein]] from ''Sulfolobus acidocaldarius''), there is an overabundance of acidic residues which minimizes low pH destabilization induced by a buildup of positive charge. Other mechanisms include minimization of solvent accessibility of acidic residues or binding of metal cofactors. In a specialized case of acid stability, the NAPase protein from ''Nocardiopsis alba'' was shown to have relocated acid-sensitive [[salt bridge (protein)|salt bridges]] away from regions that play an important role in the unfolding process. In this case of kinetic acid stability, protein longevity is accomplished across a wide range of pH, both acidic and basic.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Acidophiles in acid mine drainage]]\n* [[Neutrophile]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal\n|author=Cooper, J.

Therefore, intracellular proteins do not need to develop acid stability through evolution. However, other acidophiles, such as ''[[Acetobacter]] aceti'', have an acidified cytoplasm which forces nearly all proteins in the genome to evolve acid stability.<ref>{{cite journal\n|author=Menzel, U.\n|author2=Gottschalk, G.\n|date=1985\n|volume=143\n|title=The internal pH of ''Acetobacterium wieringae'' and ''Acetobacter aceti'' during growth and production of acetic acid\n|issue=1\n|journal=Arch Microbiol\n|pages=47\u201351\n|doi=10.1007/BF00414767\n}}</ref> For this reason, ''Acetobacter aceti'' has become a valuable resource for understanding the mechanisms by which proteins can attain acid stability.\n\nStudies of proteins adapted to low pH have revealed a few general mechanisms by which proteins can achieve acid stability.  In most acid stable proteins (such as pepsin and the [[soxF]] [[protein]] from ''Sulfolobus acidocaldarius''), there is an overabundance of acidic residues which minimizes low pH destabilization induced by a buildup of positive charge. Other mechanisms include minimization of solvent accessibility of acidic residues or binding of metal cofactors. In a specialized case of acid stability, the NAPase protein from ''Nocardiopsis alba'' was shown to have relocated acid-sensitive [[salt bridge (protein)|salt bridges]] away from regions that play an important role in the unfolding process. In this case of kinetic acid stability, protein longevity is accomplished across a wide range of pH, both acidic and basic.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Acidophiles in acid mine drainage]]\n* [[Neutrophile]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal\n|author=Cooper, J.

It is carried out to allow medical procedures that would otherwise be intolerably painful for the patient; or where the nature of the procedure itself precludes the patient being awake.\n\nA variety of [[General anesthetic|drugs]] may be administered, with the overall aim of ensuring [[unconsciousness]], [[amnesia]], [[Analgesic|analgesia]], loss of reflexes of the [[autonomic nervous system]], and in some cases [[paralysis]] of [[skeletal muscle]]s. The optimal combination of drugs for any given patient and procedure is typically selected by an [[anesthesiologist|anaesthetist]], or another provider such as an operating department practitioner, anaesthetist practitioner, [[physician assistant]] or [[nurse anesthetist|nurse anaesthetist]] (depending on local practice), in consultation with the patient and the surgeon, dentist, or other practitioner performing the operative procedure.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of general anesthesia}}\n{{Further|History of tracheal intubation}}\nAttempts at producing a state of general anaesthesia can be traced throughout recorded history in the writings of the ancient [[Sumer]]ians, [[Babylonia]]ns, [[Assyria]]ns, [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indians]], and [[History of China#Ancient era|Chinese]].  During the [[Middle Ages]], scientists and other scholars made significant advances in the [[Eastern world]], while their European counterparts also made important advances.\n\nThe [[Renaissance]] saw significant advances in [[anatomy]] and [[surgery|surgical technique]]. However, despite all this progress, surgery remained a treatment of last resort. Largely because of the associated [[pain]], many patients chose certain death rather than undergo surgery. Although there has been a great deal of debate as to who deserves the most credit for the discovery of general anaesthesia, several scientific discoveries in the late 18th and early 19th centuries were critical to the eventual introduction and development of modern anaesthetic techniques.\n\nTwo enormous leaps occurred in the late 19th century, which together allowed the transition to modern surgery. An appreciation of the [[germ theory of disease]] led rapidly to the development and application of [[antiseptic]] techniques in surgery. Antisepsis, which soon gave way to [[asepsis]], reduced the overall [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] of surgery to a far more acceptable rate than in previous eras. Concurrent with these developments were the significant advances in [[pharmacology]] and [[physiology]] which led to the development of general anaesthesia and the control of pain. On 14 November 1804, [[Hanaoka Seish\u016b]], a Japanese doctor, became the first person to successfully perform surgery using general anaesthesia.\n\nIn the 20th century, the safety and efficacy of general anaesthesia was improved by the routine use of [[tracheal intubation]] and other advanced [[airway management]] techniques. Significant advances in [[Medical monitor|monitoring]] and new [[anesthetic|anaesthetic agents]] with improved [[Pharmacokinetics|pharmacokinetic]] and [[Pharmacodynamics|pharmacodynamic]] characteristics also contributed to this trend. Finally, standardized training programs for anaesthesiologists and [[nurse anesthetist|nurse anaesthetist]]s emerged during this period.\n\n== Purpose ==\nGeneral anaesthesia has many purposes, including:\n#Analgesia (loss of response to pain)\n#Amnesia (loss of memory)\n#Immobility (loss of motor reflexes)\n#Hypnosis (unconsciousness)\n#Paralysis (skeletal muscle relaxation and normal muscle relaxation)\n\nGeneral anaesthesia should not be used as prophylaxis in patients with a history of contrast medium-induced anaphylaxis<ref name=\"pmid28876979\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Boehm I, Nairz K, Morelli J, Silva Hasembank Keller P, Heverhagen JT |title=General anaesthesia for patients with a history of a contrast medium-induced anaphylaxis: a useful prophylaxis? |journal=Br J Radiol |volume=90 |issue=1079 |pages=20160647 |year=2017 |pmid=28876979 | doi=10.1259/bjr.20160647 |pmc=5963380}}</ref>  \n\n== Biochemical mechanism of action ==\nThe [[biochemistry|biochemical]] [[Theories of general anaesthetic action|mechanism of action of general anaesthetics]] is not well understood {{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}.

Despite newer anaesthetic agents and delivery techniques, which have led to more rapid onset of\u2014and recovery from\u2014anaesthesia (in some cases bypassing some of the stages entirely), the principles remain.\n\n;Stage 1: Stage 1, also known as ''induction'', is the period between the administration of induction agents and loss of consciousness. During this stage, the patient progresses from analgesia without amnesia to analgesia with amnesia. Patients can carry on a conversation at this time.\n;Stage 2: Stage 2, also known as the ''excitement stage'', is the period following loss of consciousness and marked by excited and delirious activity. During this stage, the patient's [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] and [[heart rate]] may become irregular. In addition, there may be uncontrolled movements, vomiting, [[Apnea|suspension of breathing]], and [[Pupillary response|pupillary dilation]]. Because the combination of spastic movements, vomiting, and irregular respiration may compromise the patient's airway, rapidly acting drugs are used to minimize time in this stage and reach Stage 3 as fast as possible.\n{{anchor|Surgical anaesthesia}}\n;Stage 3: In Stage 3, also known as ''surgical anaesthesia'', the skeletal muscles relax, vomiting stops, respiratory depression occurs, and eye movements slow and then stop. The patient is unconscious and ready for surgery. This stage is divided into four planes:\n:# The eyes roll, then become fixed;\n:# Corneal and laryngeal reflexes are lost;\n:# The pupils dilate and light reflex is lost;\n:# Intercostal paralysis and shallow abdominal respiration occur.\n;Stage 4: Stage 4, also known as ''overdose'', occurs when too much anaesthetic medication is given relative to the amount of surgical stimulation and the patient has severe [[brainstem]] or [[Medulla oblongata|medullary]] depression, resulting in a cessation of respiration and potential cardiovascular collapse. This stage is lethal without cardiovascular and respiratory support.\n\n== Induction ==\nGeneral anaesthesia is usually induced in a [[medical facility]], most commonly in an [[Operating theater|operating theatre]] or in a dedicated anaesthetic room adjacent to the theatre. However, it may also be conducted in other locations, such as an [[endoscopy]] suite, [[radiology]] or [[cardiology]] department, [[emergency department]], or ambulance, or at the site of a [[disaster]] where extrication of the patient may be impossible or impractical.\n\nAnaesthetic agents may be administered by various routes, including [[inhalation]], [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] ([[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]], [[Intramuscular injection|intramuscular]], or [[Subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]]), [[mouth|oral]], and [[rectum|rectal]]. Once they enter the [[circulatory system]], the agents are transported to their biochemical [[Active site|sites of action]] in the [[Central nervous system|central]] and [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] nervous systems.\n\nMost general anaesthetics are induced either intravenously or by inhalation. Intravenous injection works faster than inhalation, taking about 10\u201320 seconds to induce total unconsciousness. This minimizes the excitatory phase (Stage 2) and thus reduces complications related to the induction of anaesthesia.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Commonly used intravenous induction agents include [[propofol]], [[sodium thiopental]], [[etomidate]], [[methohexital]], and [[ketamine]]. [[Inhalational anaesthetic|Inhalational anaesthesia]] may be chosen when intravenous access is difficult to obtain (e.g., children), when difficulty maintaining the airway is anticipated, or when the patient prefers it. [[Sevoflurane]] is the most commonly used agent for inhalational induction, because it is less irritating to the [[tracheobronchial tree]] than other agents.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nAs an example sequence of induction drugs:\n# Pre-oxygenation to fill lungs with oxygen to permit a longer period of apnea during intubation without affecting blood oxygen levels\n# [[Fentanyl]] for systemic analgesia for intubation\n# [[Propofol]] for sedation for intubation\n# Switching from oxygen to a mixture of oxygen and [[inhalational anesthetic]]\n\n[[Laryngoscopy]] and intubation are both very stimulating and induction blunts the response to these maneuvers while simultaneously inducing a near-coma state to prevent awareness.\n\n=== Physiologic monitoring ===\nSeveral [[monitoring (medicine)|monitoring]] technologies allow for a controlled induction of, maintenance of, and emergence from general anaesthesia.\n# '''Continuous [[electrocardiography]]''' (ECG or EKG): [[Electrode]]s are placed on the patient's skin to monitor heart rate and rhythm. This may also help the anaesthesiologist to identify early signs of heart [[ischemia|ischaemia]]. Typically lead II and V5 are monitored for arrhythmias and ischemia, respectively.\n# '''Continuous [[pulse oximetry]]''' (SpO2): A device is placed, usually on a finger, to allow for early detection of a fall in a patient's [[hemoglobin|haemoglobin]] saturation with oxygen ([[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxaemia]]).\n# '''Blood pressure monitoring''': There are two methods of measuring the patient's blood pressure. The first, and most common, is non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitoring. This involves placing a [[Sphygmomanometer|blood pressure cuff]] around the patient's arm, forearm, or leg. A machine takes blood pressure readings at regular, preset intervals throughout the surgery. The second method is invasive blood pressure (IBP) monitoring. This method is reserved for patients with significant heart or lung disease, the critically ill, and those undergoing major procedures such as cardiac or transplant surgery, or when large blood loss is expected. It involves placing a special type of plastic [[cannula]] in an artery, usually in the wrist ([[radial artery]]) or groin ([[femoral artery]]).\n# '''Agent concentration measurement''': [[anaesthetic machine]]s typically have monitors to measure the percentage of inhalational anaesthetic agents used as well as exhalation concentrations. These monitors include measuring [[oxygen]], [[carbon dioxide]], and [[inhalational anaesthetic]]s (e.g., [[nitrous oxide]], [[isoflurane]]).\n# '''Oxygen measurement''': Almost all circuits have an alarm in case oxygen delivery to the patient is compromised. The alarm goes off if the fraction of inspired oxygen drops below a set threshold.\n# A '''circuit disconnect alarm''' or '''low pressure alarm''' indicates failure of the circuit to achieve a given pressure during [[mechanical ventilation]].\n# '''[[Capnography]]''' measures the amount of [[carbon dioxide]] exhaled by the patient in percent or mmHg, allowing the anaesthesiologist to assess the adequacy of [[Ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]]. MmHg is usually used to allow the provider to see more subtle changes.  \n# '''Temperature measurement''' to discern [[hypothermia]] or fever, and to allow early detection of [[malignant hyperthermia]].\n# '''[[Electroencephalography]]''', '''[[entropy monitoring]]''', or other systems may be used to verify the depth of anaesthesia. This reduces the likelihood of [[anaesthesia awareness]] and of overdose.\n\n=== Airway management ===\n{{main|Airway management}}\nAnaesthetized patients lose protective airway reflexes (such as coughing), [[Airway management|airway patency]], and sometimes a regular breathing pattern due to the effects of anaesthetics, [[opioid]]s, or [[muscle relaxant]]s.\nTo maintain an open airway and regulate breathing, some form of [[tracheal tube|breathing tube]] is inserted after the patient is unconscious.\nTo enable [[mechanical ventilation]], an [[Tracheal intubation|endotracheal tube]] is often used, although there are alternative devices that can assist respiration, such as face masks or [[laryngeal mask airway]]s.\nGenerally, full mechanical ventilation is only used if a very deep state of general anaesthesia is to be induced for a major procedure, and/or with a profoundly ill or injured patient.\nThat said, induction of general anaesthesia usually results in [[apnea]] and requires ventilation until the drugs wear off and spontaneous breathing starts.\nIn other words, ventilation may be required for both induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia or just during the induction.\nHowever, mechanical ventilation can provide ventilatory support during spontaneous breathing to ensure adequate gas exchange.\n\nGeneral anaesthesia can also be induced with the patient spontaneously breathing and therefore maintaining their own oxygenation which can be beneficial in certain scenarios (e.g. difficult airway or tubeless surgery). Spontaneous ventilation has been traditionally maintained with inhalational agents (i.e. halothane or sevoflurane) which is called a gas or inhalational induction. Spontaneous ventilation can also be maintained using intravenous anaesthesia (e.g. propofol). Intravenous anaesthesia to maintain spontaneous respiration has certain advantages over inhalational agents (i.e. suppressed laryngeal reflexes) however it requires careful titration. SponTaneous Respiration using IntraVEnous anaesthesia and High-flow nasal oxygen (STRIVE Hi) is a technique that has been used in difficult and obstructed airways.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Booth AW, Vidhani K, Lee PK, Thomsett CM | title = SponTaneous Respiration using IntraVEnous anaesthesia and Hi-flow nasal oxygen (STRIVE Hi) maintains oxygenation and airway patency during management of the obstructed airway: an observational study | journal = British Journal of Anaesthesia | volume = 118 | issue = 3 | pages = 444\u2013451 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28203745 | pmc = 5409133 | doi = 10.1093/bja/aew468 | url = https://academic.oup.com/bja/article/118/3/444/2999638/SponTaneous-Respiration-using-IntraVEnous }}</ref>\n\n=== Eye management ===\n{{Main|Eye injuries during general anaesthesia}}\nGeneral anaesthesia reduces the [[Tetanic contraction|tonic contraction]] of the [[orbicularis oculi muscle]], causing [[lagophthalmos]], or incomplete eye closure, in 59% of patients.<ref name=\"contractor\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Contractor S, Hardman JG |title=Injury during anaesthesia |journal=Continuing Education in Anaesthesia Critical Care & Pain |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=67\u201370 |year=2006 |doi=10.1093/bjaceaccp/mkl004}}</ref> In addition, tear production and tear-film stability are reduced, resulting in corneal epithelial drying and reduced [[Lysosome|lysosomal]] protection.

The first drug used for this purpose was [[curare]], introduced in the 1940s, which has now been superseded by drugs with fewer side effects and, generally, shorter duration of action. Muscle relaxation allows surgery within major [[body cavity|body cavities]], such as the [[abdomen]] and [[thorax]], without the need for very deep anaesthesia, and also facilitates [[endotracheal intubation]].\n\n[[Acetylcholine]], the natural [[neurotransmitter]] at the [[neuromuscular junction]], causes muscles to contract when it is released from nerve endings. Muscle relaxants work by preventing acetylcholine from attaching to its receptor. Paralysis of the muscles of respiration\u2014the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]] and [[intercostal muscle]]s of the chest\u2014requires that some form of artificial respiration be implemented. Because the muscles of the [[larynx]] are also paralysed, the airway usually needs to be protected by means of an [[endotracheal tube]].\n\nParalysis is most easily monitored by means of a peripheral nerve stimulator. This device intermittently sends short electrical pulses through the skin over a peripheral nerve while the contraction of a muscle supplied by that nerve is observed. The effects of muscle relaxants are commonly reversed at the end of surgery by [[Cholinesterase inhibitor|anticholinesterase]] drugs, which are administered in combination with muscarinic [[anticholinergic]] drugs to minimize side effects. Novel neuromuscular blockade reversal agents such as [[sugammadex]] may also be used. Examples of skeletal muscle relaxants in use today are [[pancuronium]], [[rocuronium]], [[vecuronium]], [[cisatracurium]], [[atracurium]], [[mivacurium]], and [[succinylcholine]].\n\n== Maintenance ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe duration of action of intravenous induction agents is generally 5 to 10 minutes, after which spontaneous recovery of consciousness will occur. In order to prolong unconsciousness for the required duration (usually the duration of surgery), anaesthesia must be maintained. This is achieved by allowing the patient to breathe a carefully controlled mixture of oxygen, sometimes [[nitrous oxide]], and a [[volatile anaesthetic]] agent, or by administering medication (usually [[propofol]]) through an [[Peripheral venous catheter|intravenous catheter]]. Inhaled agents are frequently supplemented by intravenous anaesthetics, such as [[opioid]]s (usually [[fentanyl]] or a fentanyl derivative) and [[sedative]]s (usually propofol or midazolam). With propofol-based anaesthetics, however, supplementation by inhalation agents is not required.\n\nAt the end of surgery, administration of anaesthetic agents is discontinued. Recovery of consciousness occurs when the concentration of anaesthetic in the brain drops below a certain level (usually within 1 to 30 minutes, depending on the duration of surgery).\n\n{{anchor|tci}}\nIn the 1990s, a novel method of maintaining anaesthesia was developed in [[Glasgow]], Scotland. Called [[target controlled infusion]] (TCI), it involves using a computer-controlled syringe driver (pump) to infuse propofol throughout the duration of surgery, removing the need for a volatile anaesthetic and allowing pharmacologic principles to more precisely guide the amount of the drug used by setting the desired drug concentration. Advantages include faster recovery from anaesthesia, reduced incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and absence of a trigger for [[malignant hyperthermia]]. At present, TCI is not permitted in the United States, but a syringe pump delivering a specific rate of medication is commonly used instead.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nOther medications are occasionally used to treat side effects or prevent complications. They include [[antihypertensives]] to treat high blood pressure; [[ephedrine]] or [[phenylephrine]] to treat low blood pressure; [[salbutamol]] to treat [[asthma]], [[laryngospasm]], or [[bronchospasm]]; and [[epinephrine]] or [[diphenhydramine]] to treat allergic reactions. [[Glucocorticoids]] or [[antibiotics]] are sometimes given to prevent inflammation and infection, respectively.\n\n== Emergence ==\nEmergence is the return to baseline physiologic function of all organ systems after the cessation of general anaesthetics. This stage may be accompanied by temporary neurologic phenomena, such as [[agitated emergence]] (acute mental confusion), [[aphasia]] (impaired production or comprehension of speech), or focal impairment in sensory or motor function. [[Postanesthetic shivering|Shivering]] is also fairly common and can be clinically significant because it causes an increase in [[oxygen]] consumption, [[carbon dioxide]] production, [[cardiac output]], [[heart rate]], and [[blood pressure|systemic blood pressure]]. The proposed mechanism is based on the observation that the spinal cord recovers at a faster rate than the brain. This results in uninhibited spinal reflexes manifested as [[clonic]] activity (shivering). This theory is supported by the fact that [[doxapram]], a [[Central nervous system|CNS]] stimulant, is somewhat effective in abolishing postoperative shivering.<ref>Basics of Anesthesia, 5th Edition Authors: Robert K.

It is carried out to allow medical procedures that would otherwise be intolerably painful for the patient; or where the nature of the procedure itself precludes the patient being awake.\n\nA variety of [[General anesthetic|drugs]] may be administered, with the overall aim of ensuring [[unconsciousness]], [[amnesia]], [[Analgesic|analgesia]], loss of reflexes of the [[autonomic nervous system]], and in some cases [[paralysis]] of [[skeletal muscle]]s. The optimal combination of drugs for any given patient and procedure is typically selected by an [[anesthesiologist|anaesthetist]], or another provider such as an operating department practitioner, anaesthetist practitioner, [[physician assistant]] or [[nurse anesthetist|nurse anaesthetist]] (depending on local practice), in consultation with the patient and the surgeon, dentist, or other practitioner performing the operative procedure.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of general anesthesia}}\n{{Further|History of tracheal intubation}}\nAttempts at producing a state of general anaesthesia can be traced throughout recorded history in the writings of the ancient [[Sumer]]ians, [[Babylonia]]ns, [[Assyria]]ns, [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indians]], and [[History of China#Ancient era|Chinese]].  During the [[Middle Ages]], scientists and other scholars made significant advances in the [[Eastern world]], while their European counterparts also made important advances.\n\nThe [[Renaissance]] saw significant advances in [[anatomy]] and [[surgery|surgical technique]]. However, despite all this progress, surgery remained a treatment of last resort. Largely because of the associated [[pain]], many patients chose certain death rather than undergo surgery. Although there has been a great deal of debate as to who deserves the most credit for the discovery of general anaesthesia, several scientific discoveries in the late 18th and early 19th centuries were critical to the eventual introduction and development of modern anaesthetic techniques.\n\nTwo enormous leaps occurred in the late 19th century, which together allowed the transition to modern surgery. An appreciation of the [[germ theory of disease]] led rapidly to the development and application of [[antiseptic]] techniques in surgery. Antisepsis, which soon gave way to [[asepsis]], reduced the overall [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] of surgery to a far more acceptable rate than in previous eras. Concurrent with these developments were the significant advances in [[pharmacology]] and [[physiology]] which led to the development of general anaesthesia and the control of pain. On 14 November 1804, [[Hanaoka Seish\u016b]], a Japanese doctor, became the first person to successfully perform surgery using general anaesthesia.\n\nIn the 20th century, the safety and efficacy of general anaesthesia was improved by the routine use of [[tracheal intubation]] and other advanced [[airway management]] techniques. Significant advances in [[Medical monitor|monitoring]] and new [[anesthetic|anaesthetic agents]] with improved [[Pharmacokinetics|pharmacokinetic]] and [[Pharmacodynamics|pharmacodynamic]] characteristics also contributed to this trend. Finally, standardized training programs for anaesthesiologists and [[nurse anesthetist|nurse anaesthetist]]s emerged during this period.\n\n== Purpose ==\nGeneral anaesthesia has many purposes, including:\n#Analgesia (loss of response to pain)\n#Amnesia (loss of memory)\n#Immobility (loss of motor reflexes)\n#Hypnosis (unconsciousness)\n#Paralysis (skeletal muscle relaxation and normal muscle relaxation)\n\nGeneral anaesthesia should not be used as prophylaxis in patients with a history of contrast medium-induced anaphylaxis<ref name=\"pmid28876979\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Boehm I, Nairz K, Morelli J, Silva Hasembank Keller P, Heverhagen JT |title=General anaesthesia for patients with a history of a contrast medium-induced anaphylaxis: a useful prophylaxis? |journal=Br J Radiol |volume=90 |issue=1079 |pages=20160647 |year=2017 |pmid=28876979 | doi=10.1259/bjr.20160647}}</ref>  \n\n== Biochemical mechanism of action ==\nThe [[biochemistry|biochemical]] [[Theories of general anaesthetic action|mechanism of action of general anaesthetics]] is not well understood {{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}.

Despite newer anaesthetic agents and delivery techniques, which have led to more rapid onset of\u2014and recovery from\u2014anaesthesia (in some cases bypassing some of the stages entirely), the principles remain.\n\n;Stage 1: Stage 1, also known as ''induction'', is the period between the administration of induction agents and loss of consciousness. During this stage, the patient progresses from analgesia without amnesia to analgesia with amnesia. Patients can carry on a conversation at this time.\n;Stage 2: Stage 2, also known as the ''excitement stage'', is the period following loss of consciousness and marked by excited and delirious activity. During this stage, the patient's [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] and [[heart rate]] may become irregular. In addition, there may be uncontrolled movements, vomiting, [[Apnea|suspension of breathing]], and [[Pupillary response|pupillary dilation]]. Because the combination of spastic movements, vomiting, and irregular respiration may compromise the patient's airway, rapidly acting drugs are used to minimize time in this stage and reach Stage 3 as fast as possible.\n{{anchor|Surgical anaesthesia}}\n;Stage 3: In Stage 3, also known as ''surgical anaesthesia'', the skeletal muscles relax, vomiting stops, respiratory depression occurs, and eye movements slow and then stop. The patient is unconscious and ready for surgery. This stage is divided into four planes:\n:# The eyes roll, then become fixed;\n:# Corneal and laryngeal reflexes are lost;\n:# The pupils dilate and light reflex is lost;\n:# Intercostal paralysis and shallow abdominal respiration occur.\n;Stage 4: Stage 4, also known as ''overdose'', occurs when too much anaesthetic medication is given relative to the amount of surgical stimulation and the patient has severe [[brainstem]] or [[Medulla oblongata|medullary]] depression, resulting in a cessation of respiration and potential cardiovascular collapse. This stage is lethal without cardiovascular and respiratory support.\n\n== Induction ==\nGeneral anaesthesia is usually induced in a [[medical facility]], most commonly in an [[Operating theater|operating theatre]] or in a dedicated anaesthetic room adjacent to the theatre. However, it may also be conducted in other locations, such as an [[endoscopy]] suite, [[radiology]] or [[cardiology]] department, [[emergency department]], or ambulance, or at the site of a [[disaster]] where extrication of the patient may be impossible or impractical.\n\nAnaesthetic agents may be administered by various routes, including [[inhalation]], [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] ([[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]], [[Intramuscular injection|intramuscular]], or [[Subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]]), [[mouth|oral]], and [[rectum|rectal]]. Once they enter the [[circulatory system]], the agents are transported to their biochemical [[Active site|sites of action]] in the [[Central nervous system|central]] and [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] nervous systems.\n\nMost general anaesthetics are induced either intravenously or by inhalation. Intravenous injection works faster than inhalation, taking about 10\u201320 seconds to induce total unconsciousness. This minimizes the excitatory phase (Stage 2) and thus reduces complications related to the induction of anaesthesia.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Commonly used intravenous induction agents include [[propofol]], [[sodium thiopental]], [[etomidate]], [[methohexital]], and [[ketamine]]. [[Inhalational anaesthetic|Inhalational anaesthesia]] may be chosen when intravenous access is difficult to obtain (e.g., children), when difficulty maintaining the airway is anticipated, or when the patient prefers it. [[Sevoflurane]] is the most commonly used agent for inhalational induction, because it is less irritating to the [[tracheobronchial tree]] than other agents.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nAs an example sequence of induction drugs:\n# Pre-oxygenation to fill lungs with oxygen to permit a longer period of apnea during intubation without affecting blood oxygen levels\n# [[Fentanyl]] for systemic analgesia for intubation\n# [[Propofol]] for sedation for intubation\n# Switching from oxygen to a mixture of oxygen and [[inhalational anesthetic]]\n\n[[Laryngoscopy]] and intubation are both very stimulating and induction blunts the response to these maneuvers while simultaneously inducing a near-coma state to prevent awareness.\n\n=== Physiologic monitoring ===\nSeveral [[monitoring (medicine)|monitoring]] technologies allow for a controlled induction of, maintenance of, and emergence from general anaesthesia.\n# '''Continuous [[electrocardiography]]''' (ECG or EKG): [[Electrode]]s are placed on the patient's skin to monitor heart rate and rhythm. This may also help the anaesthesiologist to identify early signs of heart [[ischemia|ischaemia]]. Typically lead II and V5 are monitored for arrhythmias and ischemia, respectively.\n# '''Continuous [[pulse oximetry]]''' (SpO2): A device is placed, usually on a finger, to allow for early detection of a fall in a patient's [[hemoglobin|haemoglobin]] saturation with oxygen ([[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxaemia]]).\n# '''Blood pressure monitoring''': There are two methods of measuring the patient's blood pressure. The first, and most common, is non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitoring. This involves placing a [[Sphygmomanometer|blood pressure cuff]] around the patient's arm, forearm, or leg. A machine takes blood pressure readings at regular, preset intervals throughout the surgery. The second method is invasive blood pressure (IBP) monitoring. This method is reserved for patients with significant heart or lung disease, the critically ill, and those undergoing major procedures such as cardiac or transplant surgery, or when large blood loss is expected. It involves placing a special type of plastic [[cannula]] in an artery, usually in the wrist ([[radial artery]]) or groin ([[femoral artery]]).\n# '''Agent concentration measurement''': [[anaesthetic machine]]s typically have monitors to measure the percentage of inhalational anaesthetic agents used as well as exhalation concentrations. These monitors include measuring [[oxygen]], [[carbon dioxide]], and [[inhalational anaesthetic]]s (e.g., [[nitrous oxide]], [[isoflurane]]).\n# '''Oxygen measurement''': Almost all circuits have an alarm in case oxygen delivery to the patient is compromised. The alarm goes off if the fraction of inspired oxygen drops below a set threshold.\n# A '''circuit disconnect alarm''' or '''low pressure alarm''' indicates failure of the circuit to achieve a given pressure during [[mechanical ventilation]].\n# '''[[Capnography]]''' measures the amount of [[carbon dioxide]] exhaled by the patient in percent or mmHg, allowing the anaesthesiologist to assess the adequacy of [[Ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]]. MmHg is usually used to allow the provider to see more subtle changes.  \n# '''Temperature measurement''' to discern [[hypothermia]] or fever, and to allow early detection of [[malignant hyperthermia]].\n# '''[[Electroencephalography]]''', '''[[entropy monitoring]]''', or other systems may be used to verify the depth of anaesthesia. This reduces the likelihood of [[anaesthesia awareness]] and of overdose.\n\n=== Airway management ===\n{{main|Airway management}}\nAnaesthetized patients lose protective airway reflexes (such as coughing), [[Airway management|airway patency]], and sometimes a regular breathing pattern due to the effects of anaesthetics, [[opioid]]s, or [[muscle relaxant]]s.\nTo maintain an open airway and regulate breathing, some form of [[tracheal tube|breathing tube]] is inserted after the patient is unconscious.\nTo enable [[mechanical ventilation]], an [[Tracheal intubation|endotracheal tube]] is often used, although there are alternative devices that can assist respiration, such as face masks or [[laryngeal mask airway]]s.\nGenerally, full mechanical ventilation is only used if a very deep state of general anaesthesia is to be induced for a major procedure, and/or with a profoundly ill or injured patient.\nThat said, induction of general anaesthesia usually results in [[apnea]] and requires ventilation until the drugs wear off and spontaneous breathing starts.\nIn other words, ventilation may be required for both induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia or just during the induction.\nHowever, mechanical ventilation can provide ventilatory support during spontaneous breathing to ensure adequate gas exchange.\n\nGeneral anaesthesia can also be induced with the patient spontaneously breathing and therefore maintaining their own oxygenation which can be beneficial in certain scenarios (e.g. difficult airway or tubeless surgery). Spontaneous ventilation has been traditionally maintained with inhalational agents (i.e. halothane or sevoflurane) which is called a gas or inhalational induction. Spontaneous ventilation can also be maintained using intravenous anaesthesia (e.g. propofol). Intravenous anaesthesia to maintain spontaneous respiration has certain advantages over inhalational agents (i.e. suppressed laryngeal reflexes) however it requires careful titration. SponTaneous Respiration using IntraVEnous anaesthesia and High-flow nasal oxygen (STRIVE Hi) is a technique that has been used in difficult and obstructed airways.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Booth AW, Vidhani K, Lee PK, Thomsett CM | title = SponTaneous Respiration using IntraVEnous anaesthesia and Hi-flow nasal oxygen (STRIVE Hi) maintains oxygenation and airway patency during management of the obstructed airway: an observational study | journal = British Journal of Anaesthesia | volume = 118 | issue = 3 | pages = 444\u2013451 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28203745 | pmc = 5409133 | doi = 10.1093/bja/aew468 | url = https://academic.oup.com/bja/article/118/3/444/2999638/SponTaneous-Respiration-using-IntraVEnous }}</ref>\n\n=== Eye management ===\n{{Main|Eye injuries during general anaesthesia}}\nGeneral anaesthesia reduces the [[Tetanic contraction|tonic contraction]] of the [[orbicularis oculi muscle]], causing [[lagophthalmos]], or incomplete eye closure, in 59% of patients.<ref name=\"contractor\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Contractor S, Hardman JG |title=Injury during anaesthesia |journal=Continuing Education in Anaesthesia Critical Care & Pain |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=67\u201370 |year=2006 |doi=10.1093/bjaceaccp/mkl004}}</ref> In addition, tear production and tear-film stability are reduced, resulting in corneal epithelial drying and reduced [[Lysosome|lysosomal]] protection.

The first drug used for this purpose was [[curare]], introduced in the 1940s, which has now been superseded by drugs with fewer side effects and, generally, shorter duration of action. Muscle relaxation allows surgery within major [[body cavity|body cavities]], such as the [[abdomen]] and [[thorax]], without the need for very deep anaesthesia, and also facilitates [[endotracheal intubation]].\n\n[[Acetylcholine]], the natural [[neurotransmitter]] at the [[neuromuscular junction]], causes muscles to contract when it is released from nerve endings. Muscle relaxants work by preventing acetylcholine from attaching to its receptor. Paralysis of the muscles of respiration\u2014the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]] and [[intercostal muscle]]s of the chest\u2014requires that some form of artificial respiration be implemented. Because the muscles of the [[larynx]] are also paralysed, the airway usually needs to be protected by means of an [[endotracheal tube]].\n\nParalysis is most easily monitored by means of a peripheral nerve stimulator. This device intermittently sends short electrical pulses through the skin over a peripheral nerve while the contraction of a muscle supplied by that nerve is observed. The effects of muscle relaxants are commonly reversed at the end of surgery by [[Cholinesterase inhibitor|anticholinesterase]] drugs, which are administered in combination with muscarinic [[anticholinergic]] drugs to minimize side effects. Novel neuromuscular blockade reversal agents such as [[sugammadex]] may also be used. Examples of skeletal muscle relaxants in use today are [[pancuronium]], [[rocuronium]], [[vecuronium]], [[cisatracurium]], [[atracurium]], [[mivacurium]], and [[succinylcholine]].\n\n== Maintenance ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe duration of action of intravenous induction agents is generally 5 to 10 minutes, after which spontaneous recovery of consciousness will occur. In order to prolong unconsciousness for the required duration (usually the duration of surgery), anaesthesia must be maintained. This is achieved by allowing the patient to breathe a carefully controlled mixture of oxygen, sometimes [[nitrous oxide]], and a [[volatile anaesthetic]] agent, or by administering medication (usually [[propofol]]) through an [[Peripheral venous catheter|intravenous catheter]]. Inhaled agents are frequently supplemented by intravenous anaesthetics, such as [[opioid]]s (usually [[fentanyl]] or a fentanyl derivative) and [[sedative]]s (usually propofol or midazolam). With propofol-based anaesthetics, however, supplementation by inhalation agents is not required.\n\nAt the end of surgery, administration of anaesthetic agents is discontinued. Recovery of consciousness occurs when the concentration of anaesthetic in the brain drops below a certain level (usually within 1 to 30 minutes, depending on the duration of surgery).\n\n{{anchor|tci}}\nIn the 1990s, a novel method of maintaining anaesthesia was developed in [[Glasgow]], Scotland. Called [[target controlled infusion]] (TCI), it involves using a computer-controlled syringe driver (pump) to infuse propofol throughout the duration of surgery, removing the need for a volatile anaesthetic and allowing pharmacologic principles to more precisely guide the amount of the drug used by setting the desired drug concentration. Advantages include faster recovery from anaesthesia, reduced incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and absence of a trigger for [[malignant hyperthermia]]. At present, TCI is not permitted in the United States, but a syringe pump delivering a specific rate of medication is commonly used instead.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nOther medications are occasionally used to treat side effects or prevent complications. They include [[antihypertensives]] to treat high blood pressure; [[ephedrine]] or [[phenylephrine]] to treat low blood pressure; [[salbutamol]] to treat [[asthma]], [[laryngospasm]], or [[bronchospasm]]; and [[epinephrine]] or [[diphenhydramine]] to treat allergic reactions. [[Glucocorticoids]] or [[antibiotics]] are sometimes given to prevent inflammation and infection, respectively.\n\n== Emergence ==\nEmergence is the return to baseline physiologic function of all organ systems after the cessation of general anaesthetics. This stage may be accompanied by temporary neurologic phenomena, such as [[agitated emergence]] (acute mental confusion), [[aphasia]] (impaired production or comprehension of speech), or focal impairment in sensory or motor function. [[Postanesthetic shivering|Shivering]] is also fairly common and can be clinically significant because it causes an increase in [[oxygen]] consumption, [[carbon dioxide]] production, [[cardiac output]], [[heart rate]], and [[blood pressure|systemic blood pressure]]. The proposed mechanism is based on the observation that the spinal cord recovers at a faster rate than the brain. This results in uninhibited spinal reflexes manifested as [[clonic]] activity (shivering).

It is claimed that the name Montrose stems from 'Mouth Hrossay' due to the location at the outlets of the [[River North Esk|River Esk]] near Rossie Island (Norse: horse island). The etymology is alternatively attributed to the [[G\u00e0idhlig|gaelic]] words ''Monadh'' (meaning moor) and Rois or Ros (meaning peninsula or promontory).

The town imported flax and timber from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]; salt, fruit and wine from [[France]] and [[Portugal]].<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\"/> The wealth this brought to the town is demonstrated in the surviving houses built by landowning and merchant families as well as local street names of \"America Street\", \"California Street\", \"Baltic Street\" and \"India Street\" evidencing its trading heritage.\n[[File:A Park at Montrose - geograph.org.uk - 1311715.jpg|left|thumb|Park in Montrose]]\nThe site of the castle, now known as Castlestead was the birthplace of the famous [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]]. Graham signed the National Covenant against [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s reorganisation of the Kirk in Scotland, fighting in the ensuing Bishops' Wars, but later switched to the King's side only to be captured and executed in [[Edinburgh]] in the year 1650.\n\nThe final chapter of the ill-fated 1715 Jacobite rebellion was also played out in Montrose. Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour.\n\nDuring the 18th century the town was a major [[smuggling]] centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial. Wealthy merchants in the 18th and 19th centuries dominated the town and built their houses gable to gable. Hence Montrosians have inherited the sobriquet, \"gable-enders\".<ref>Alan Murphy, Scotland, Footprint Travel Guides. 2004, p504</ref> A statistical account taken between 1791 and 1799 estimates the population in the 1750s as 4248; in 1776 as 4465; in 1784 as 4866 and in 1790 as 5194.

The Norse settlement was named Stroma which translates as 'Tide race river', referring to the speed of the tidal emptying and filling of the aforementioned basin, (est 9 knots). It is claimed that the name Montrose stems from 'Mouth Hrossay' due to the location at the outlets of the [[River North Esk|River Esk]] near Rossie Island (Norse: horse island). The etymology is alternatively attributed to the [[G\u00e0idhlig|gaelic]] words ''Monadh'' (meaning moor) and Rois or Ros (meaning peninsula or promontory). The first documentary evidence of the existence of Montrose is the burgh charter issued by [[David I of Scotland|David I]] who founded the town around 1140 as ''Sallorch'' or ''Sallork''.<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\">[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm \"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\", Angus Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623025501/http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}</ref> By 1178 the name had taken the form ''Munross'' before becoming ''Montrose''.<ref>A.D Mills, ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names''.

During the 1140s it was an important trading town. The trading revenues received from Montrose as well as [[Forfar]] and [[Dundee]] were acquired by [[Malcolm IV]] and contributed to [[Restenneth Priory]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In 1178 [[William the Lion]] built a castle nearby in which he would occasionally reside.

The lairds are said to have arrived in the middle of one night on horseback heavily armed. The burghesses of the town immediately sent out an appeal to the Duke of Montrose for protection but the messenger was purportedly murdered before the appeal arrived.

The town imported flax and timber from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]; salt, fruit and wine from [[France]] and [[Portugal]].<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\"/> The wealth this brought to the town is demonstrated in the surviving houses built by landowning and merchant families as well as local street names of \"America Street\", \"California Street\", \"Baltic Street\" and \"India Street\" evidencing its trading heritage.\n[[File:A Park at Montrose - geograph.org.uk - 1311715.jpg|left|thumb|Park in Montrose]]\nThe site of the castle, now known as Castlestead was the birthplace of the famous [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]]. Graham signed the National Covenant against [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s reorganisation of the Kirk in Scotland, fighting in the ensuing Bishops' Wars, but later switched to the King's side only to be captured and executed in [[Edinburgh]] in the year 1650.\n\nThe final chapter of the ill-fated 1715 Jacobite rebellion was also played out in Montrose. Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour.\n\nDuring the 18th century the town was a major [[smuggling]] centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial. Wealthy merchants in the 18th and 19th centuries dominated the town and built their houses gable to gable. Hence Montrosians have inherited the sobriquet, \"gable-enders\".<ref>Alan Murphy, Scotland, Footprint Travel Guides. 2004, p504</ref> A statistical account taken between 1791 and 1799 estimates the population in the 1750s as 4248; in 1776 as 4465; in 1784 as 4866 and in 1790 as 5194.

Its facilities were expanded several in the next few decades and it underwent various changes in name, finally becoming Sunnyside Royal Hospital in 1962.

As well as a training base Montrose was also an operational airfield for [[Hawker Hurricane]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire]] squadrons, which flew sorties over [[Norway]] and were a part of the air defences for [[Edinburgh]]. Of course, this also made the town a target for German aircraft and it was bombed on more than one occasion.

found fame writing [[Western music (North America)|Western]] songs such as \"They Cut Down the Old Pine Tree\", \"The Last Round-Up\", \"[[Wagon Wheels (song)|Wagon Wheels]]\", and \"[[Empty Saddles (in the Old Corral)|Empty Saddles]]\". Hill's most popular song was \"[[The Glory of Love (song)|The Glory of Love]]\", recorded by [[Benny Goodman]] in 1936, and subsequently by [[Peggy Lee]], [[Otis Redding]], [[Paul McCartney]], and others.\n\n==Early years==\n'''William Joseph Hill''' was born on July 14, 1899 in the [[Jamaica Plain]] neighborhood of [[Boston, Massachusetts]].  He studied the [[violin]] at the [[New England Conservatory of Music]] under [[Karl Muck]], and played with the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]]. Hill left home at the age of seventeen and headed west, where he worked as a [[cowboy]] in [[Montana]], and as a surveyor and prospector in [[Death Valley]], [[California]]. He returned to music and played violin and piano in [[dance hall]]s until forming his own jazz band in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]].<ref name=\"bio\">{{cite web |title=Billy Hill Biography |publisher=Songwriters Hall of Fame |url=http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/bio/C89 |accessdate=July 21, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928202116/http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/bio/C89 |archive-date=2012-09-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Songwriting career==\nIn 1930, Hill moved to New York City seeking success as a songwriter while working another series of odd jobs.
