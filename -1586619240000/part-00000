The dinar was subdivided into 100 ''para'' (Cyrillic script: \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430). In the early 1990s, economic mismanagement made the government bankrupt and forced it to take money from the savings of the country's citizens.

Engraved and printed by the [[American Bank Note Company]], Allegory \"Progress\" engraved by Robert Savage.]]\n===1920\u201341; Serbian dinar===\nUntil 1918, the [[Serbian dinar|dinar]] was the currency of [[Serbia]]. It then became the currency of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], circulating alongside the [[Yugoslav krone|krone]] in [[Croatia]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], with 1 dinar = 4 kronen. The first coins and banknotes bearing the name of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes were issued in 1920, until which time Serbian coins and banknotes circulated. In 1929, the name of the country changed to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and this was reflected on the currency.<ref>Cuhaj, 2010, p. 1255.</ref>\n\nIn 1931, an exchange rate of 56.4 dinara to the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]] was set, which changed to 44 dinara in 1933. In 1937, a tourist exchange rate of 250 dinara to the [[Pound sterling|British pound]] was established.\n\n===World War II (1941\u201345)===\nIn 1941, Yugoslavia was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] and split up, with the dinar remaining currency in [[Nedi\u0107's Serbia]] as [[Serbian dinar]]). The [[Independent State of Croatia kuna|kuna]] was introduced in [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] ([[Independent State of Croatia]]) at par with the dinar, whilst the [[Bulgarian lev]], [[Italian lira]] and [[German reichsmark|German Reichsmark]] circulated in those part of Yugoslavia occupied by these countries.\n\n===1944\u201365; Federation dinar===\nIn 1944, as Yugoslavia began to be reconstituted, the Yugoslav dinar replaced the [[Serbian dinar]], [[Independent State of Croatia kuna]] and other occupation currencies, with the rates of exchanged being 1 Yugoslav dinar = 20 Serbian dinara = 40 kuna. In May 1945, a peg of 50 dinara = 1 [[U.S. dollar]] was established but was not maintained.\n\n===1966\u201389; Hard dinar, YUD===\nOn January 1, 1966, the first of five revaluations took place, at a ratio of 100 to 1. This currency was never very stable, suffering from an inflation rate of 15 to 25 percent per year. In the late 1980s the inflation rate accelerated, causing the currency to be revalued at the beginning of 1990.\n\n===1990\u201392; Convertible dinar, YUN===\n{|align=\"right\" style=\"margin-right: 1em;\"\n|[[File:Emblem of SFR Yugoslavia.svg|thumb|150px|Coat of arms of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.]]\n|}\nThe second revaluation took place on January 1, 1990, at a ratio of 10,000 to 1. During this period, the constituent republics began to leave the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. Four of the six republics declared independence and issued their own currencies shortly after. This was the last dinar that bore the [[Coat of arms of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|coat of arms]] and the name of the \"Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\" in multiple languages.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Country\n!Currency\n!ISO code\n!Date adopted\n!Value\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[Slovenia]]\n|align=\"left\"|[[Slovenian tolar]]\n|SIT\n| 8 October 1991\n| 1 dinar of 1990\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[Croatia]]\n|align=\"left\"|[[Croatian dinar]]\n|HRD\n| 23 December 1991\n| 1 dinar of 1990\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[North Macedonia]]\n|align=\"left\"|[[Macedonian denar]]\n|MKN\n| 26 April 1992\n| 1 dinar of 1990\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]\n|align=\"left\"|[[Bosnia and Herzegovina dinar|Bosnian dinar]]\n|BAD\n| 1 July 1992\n| 1 dinar of 1992\n|-\n|}\nSerbian enclaves in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina also issued currencies in dinar, equivalent to and revalued together with the Yugoslav dinar. These were the [[Krajina dinar]] and the [[Republika Srpska dinar]].\n\n===July 1992 \u2013 September 1993; Reformed dinar, YUR===\nThe third revaluation took place on 1 July 1992, at a ratio of 10 to 1. [[Hyperinflation in Yugoslavia|Hyperinflation in the country]] began during this currency's period of circulation. This dinar was issued in the then [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], which consisted of the remaining republics of [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]. People started to use foreign [[hard currency]], such as Deutschmarks, to mitigate some of the problems of hyperinflation. (This federation split in 2006 and Montenegro currently uses the Euro as its currency, though it [[International status and usage of the euro|does not mint it]].)\n\n===October\u2013December 1993 dinar, YUO===\n[[File:500000000000 dinars.jpg|150px|right]]\nYugoslavia re-denominated the dinar for the fourth time on 1 October 1993, at a ratio of 1 million to 1. This did not mitigate the hyperinflation, and the 1993 dinar ([[ISO 4217|ISO 4217 code]]: YUO) lasted for only three months.\n\nCoinage became redundant. The 1993 dinar had the largest denomination out of all incarnations of Yugoslavian currency: the banknote, featuring [[Jovan Jovanovi\u0107 Zmaj]] had a face value of 500 billion ({{val|5|e=11}}) dinara (right). Wages became worthless; if paid in cash, workers had to rush out and spend their wages before they lost their value overnight. Many businesses started to pay wages in goods instead, and a simple barter system developed. Businesses with good connections to politicians could still get access to hard currency. Some shops, instead of [[Menu cost|rewriting their prices]] several times a day, started pricing goods in \"bods\" (points), often equivalent to hard currency such as one Deutschmark. The winter of 1993 was particularly hard for pensioners; if a monthly pension was spent immediately, it was still barely enough to buy three litres of milk. Many people relied on connections to friends and family abroad (who could provide hard currency) or in the countryside (who could grow food).<ref>{{cite book|last=Judah|title=The Serbs|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-15826-7}}</ref>\n\n===1994 dinar, YUG===\n[[File:10000000-Dinara-1994.JPG|150px|right]]\nYugoslavia re-denominated the dinar for the fifth time on 1 January 1994, at a ratio of 1 billion ({{val|e=9}}) to 1.\n\nThe 1994 dinar ([[ISO 4217|ISO 4217 code]]: YUG) was the shortest-lived out of all incarnations of Yugoslavian currency, as [[hyperinflation]] continued to intensify<ref name=\"RadioNetherlands\">[http://www.radionetherlandsarchives.org/yugoslavia-on-the-brink/ Yugoslavia on the brink, Radio Netherlands Archives, August 8, 1994]</ref>, and only one coin (1 dinar) was issued for it. Towards the end of the 1994 dinar, the National Bank overprinted and reissued 10 million dinara banknotes from the 1992 dinar (right).\n\n===1994\u20132006; Novi dinar, YUM===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\"\n|+'''Reforms of the Yugoslav dinar'''\n!Date\n!Conversion Rate\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|29 November 1944\n|align=\"center\"|20\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|1 January 1966\n|align=\"center\"|100\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|1 January 1990\n|align=\"center\"|10,000\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|1 July 1992\n|align=\"center\"|10\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|1 October 1993\n|align=\"center\"|1,000,000\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|1 January 1994\n|align=\"center\"|1,000,000,000\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|24 January 1994\n|align=\"center\"|~13 million\n|}\nOn 24 January 1994, the ''novi dinar'' (nominative plural: ''novi dinari'', Cyrillic script: \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0440, \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0438; genitive plural: ''novih dinara'', Cyrillic: \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0430; novi means new) was introduced. This was not a revaluation of the dinar. Instead, the novi dinar was pegged at par to the [[German mark|Deutsche Mark]]. On the day of the introduction of the novi dinar, the exchange rate of the previous dinar to the Deutsche Mark, and, hence, to the novi dinar, was approximately 1 DM = 13 million dinara. Despite not being pegged to the newest currency, the previous dinar did not fall further in value, remaining at about 12 million \"1994\" dinar to the novi dinar.<ref>[http://www.scc.rutgers.edu/serbian_digest/242/t242-6.htm]</ref> The overall impact of the hyperinflation was that 1 novi dinar equalled approximately 1.2{{E|27}} third (hard) dinara from before 1990, 1.2{{E|29}} Federation dinara, or 2.4 {{E|30}} pre-war dinara. The \"novi\" portion of the name was abandoned in 2000.\n\n===Replacement of the dinar===\nOn 6 November 1999, [[Montenegro]] decided that, besides the Yugoslav dinar, the [[Deutsche Mark]] would also be an official currency. On November 13, 2000, the dinar was dropped in Montenegro and the Deutsche Mark (by that time defined in terms of the [[euro]]) became the only currency there. In 2006, with the end of Serbia and Montenegro's union following Montenegro's independence declaration, the dinar, by then only used in Serbia, was replaced by the [[Serbian dinar]].\n\n== Coins ==\n=== 1920 dinar ===\n[[File:Jugoslawien1Dinar1938.jpg|thumb|1 Dinar 1938]]\nIn 1920, the first coins were minted in the name of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. They were zinc 5 and 10 para and nickel-bronze 25 para. These were followed, in 1925, by nickel-bronze 50 para, 1 and 2 dinara. From 1931, coins were minted in the name of Yugoslavia, starting with silver 10 and 20 dinara, followed by silver 50 dinara in 1932. In 1938, aluminium-bronze 50 para, 1 and 2 dinara, nickel 10 dinara and reduced size, silver 20 and 50 dinara were introduced. These were the last coins issued before the [[World War II|Second World War]].\n\n=== 1944 dinar ===\nIn 1945, zinc 50 para, 1, 2 and 5 dinara were introduced, followed in 1953 by aluminium coins for the same denominations. In 1955, aluminium-bronze 10, 20 and 50 dinara were added.\n\n=== 1966 dinar ===\n<gallery mode=packed style=\"line-height:130%\">\nFile:Jugoslavia 5 para.JPG|5 para coin, 1965, front and reverse\nFile:10 para Yugoslav dinar (1965) front.JPG|10 para coin, 1965, front\nFile:10 para Yugoslav dinar (1965) reverse.JPG|10 para coin, 1965, reverse\nFile:20 para Yugoslav dinar (1974) front.JPG|20 para coin, 1974, front\nFile:20 para Yugoslav dinar (1974) reverse.JPG|20 para coin, 1974, reverse\nFile:50 para Yugoslav dinar (1977) front.JPG|50 para coin, 1977, front\nFile:50 para Yugoslav dinar (1977) reverse.JPG|50 para coin, 1977, reverse\nFile:1 Yugoslav dinar (1978) front.JPG|1 dinar coin, 1978, front\nFile:1 Yugoslav Dinar (1978) reverse.JPG|1 dinar coin, 1978, reverse\nFile:Yugoslav Dinar 977 02.PNG|additional assorted coins, front\nFile:Yugoslav Dinar 977 01.PNG|additional assorted coins, reverse\n</gallery>\nIn 1966, brass 5, 10, 20 and 50 para, and cupro-nickel 1 dinar coins (dated 1965) were introduced. In 1971, nickel-brass 2 and 5 dinara were introduced, followed by cupro-nickel 10 dinara in 1976. Production of 5, 10 and 20 para coins ceased in 1981, with bronze 25 and 50 para being introduced the following year. Nickel-brass 20, 50 and 100 dinara were introduced in 1985 and production of all coins less than 10 dinara stopped the next year. In 1988, brass 10, 20, 50 and 100 dinara were introduced. These four coins were issued until 1989.\n\n=== 1990 dinar ===\nIn 1990, coins for 10, 20 and 50 para, 1, 2 and 5 dinara were introduced.  The highest two denominations were minted in small numbers in 1992, the other denominations having ceased production in 1991.\n\n=== 1992 dinar ===\nCoins were issued for this currency in 1992 in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 50 dinara. The 1, 2 and 5 dinara were bronze, whilst the 10 and 50 dinara were nickel-brass. The coins bore the state title \"Yugoslavia\" (Jugoslavija in the [[Gaj's Latin alphabet|Latin]] alphabet and \u0408\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0458\u0430 in [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]) in its simplest form without any modifier.\n\n=== 1993 dinar ===\nCoins were issued in 1993 in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 50 dinara struck in nickel-brass, and 100 dinara struck in brass. Brass 500 dinara coins were also struck but not issued, most being remelted. The design of these coins was similar to that of coins of the fifth dinar, except that the sixth dinar coins bore the state title \"FR Yugoslavia\" (SR Jugoslavija in Latin and \u0421\u0420 \u0408\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0458\u0430 in Cyrillic).\n\n=== 1994 dinar ===\nOnly one coin type was struck for this short-lived currency, a brass 1 dinar.\n\n=== Novi dinar ===\nIn 1994, brass 1 and 5 para, and nickel-brass 10 and 50 para, and 1 novi dinar were introduced. In 2000 the word novi was dropped from the currency and new, brass 50 para, 1, 2 and 5 dinara coins were introduced.\n\n== Banknotes ==\n{{main|Banknotes of the Yugoslav dinar}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Money|Numismatics}}\n* [[Serbian dinar]]\n* [[Hyperinflation]]\n* [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]\n* [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]\n* [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]\n* [[Economy of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]\n* [[Alija Sirotanovi\u0107]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Cuhaj |first1=George S. |year=2010|title=Standard Catalog of World Paper Money General Issues (1368-1960)|work= |volume= |issue= |pages = |publisher=Krause Publications |doi= |url= https://books.google.com/books/about/Standard_Catalog_Of_World_Paper_Money_Ge.html?id=BuNA39dnuHsC  |accessdate=|edition=13|isbn=978-1-4402-1293-2}}\n* {{numis cite SCWC | date=1991}}\n* {{numis cite SCWPM | date=1994}}\n* {{numis cite SCWPM | date=1960.8}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110713032744/http://www.infotech2003.com/catalogue/World/cata.asp?Country=Yugoslavia Yugoslavia] n banknotes at Infotech 2003\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Money of Yugoslavia}}\n* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1022731.stm BBC News: Montenegro drops Yugoslav dinar]\n* http://www.rogershermansociety.com/yugoslavia.htm\n\n{{Currencies of Former Yugoslavia}}\n\n{{Dinar}}\n\n[[Category:Modern obsolete currencies]]\n[[Category:Currencies of Europe]]\n[[Category:Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Dinar]]\n[[Category:Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Dinar]]\n[[Category:Serbia and Montenegro]]\n[[Category:1918 establishments in Yugoslavia|Dinar]]\n[[Category:2003 disestablishments in Serbia and Montenegro]]\n[[Category:Currencies of Yugoslavia|Dinar]]\n[[Category:Currencies introduced in 1918]]\n", "text_old": "{{More footnotes|date=May 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2014}}\n{{Infobox Currency\n|currency_name_in_local = \u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0440 / dinar <small>{{in lang|sh|mk|sl}}</small>\n|image_1 = Jugoslawien1Dinar1938.jpg\n|image_2 = 1000-Dinara-1920.jpg\n|image_title_1 = 1 dinar (1938)\n|image_title_2 = 1000 dinara (1920)\n|plural_slavic = Y\n|iso_code = YUM\n|using_countries = None, previously:<br/>{{flag|Kingdom of Yugoslavia}}<br />{{flag|SFR Yugoslavia}}<br />{{flag|FR Yugoslavia}}\n|subunit_ratio_1 = 1/100\n|subunit_name_1 = para\n|symbol = din. and \u0434\u0438\u043d.\n|used_coins = 1, 5, 10, 50 para, 1, 2, 5 dinara\n|used_banknotes = 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 1000, 5000 dinara\n|obsolete_notice=1\n|issuing_authority =[[National Bank of Serbia|National Bank of Yugoslavia]]\n}}\nThe '''dinar''' ([[Cyrillic script]]: \u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0440) was the [[currency]] of the three [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] states: the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] (formerly the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]), the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], and the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] between 1918 and 2006.

This caused severe and prolonged [[hyperinflation]], which has been described as the worst in history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/hyper.htm#YUGO |work=San Jose State University |author=Thayer Watkins |title=The Worst Episode of Hyperinflation in History: Yugoslavia 1993-94 |accessdate=21 June 2019}}</ref> Large amounts of money were printed, with coins becoming redundant and inflation rates reaching over one billion per cent per year.<ref name=\"RadioNetherlands\"/> This hyperinflation caused five revaluations between 1990 and 1994; in total there were eight distinct dinari. Six of the eight have been given distinguishing names and separate [[ISO 4217]] codes. The highest denomination banknote was 500 billion dinars, which became worthless a [[fortnight]] after it was printed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Judah|title=The Serbs|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-15826-7}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:YUG-21a-National Bank-Kingdom of Serbs, Croats & Slovenes-10 Dinara (1920).jpg|thumb|National Bank of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats & Slovenes, 10 Dinara (1920). Engraved and printed by the [[American Bank Note Company]], Allegory \"Progress\" engraved by Robert Savage.]]\n===1920\u201341; Serbian dinar===\nUntil 1918, the [[Serbian dinar|dinar]] was the currency of [[Serbia]]. It then became the currency of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], circulating alongside the [[Yugoslav krone|krone]] in [[Croatia]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], with 1 dinar = 4 kronen. The first coins and banknotes bearing the name of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes were issued in 1920, until which time Serbian coins and banknotes circulated. In 1929, the name of the country changed to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and this was reflected on the currency.<ref>Cuhaj, 2010, p. 1255.</ref>\n\nIn 1931, an exchange rate of 56.4 dinara to the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]] was set, which changed to 44 dinara in 1933. In 1937, a tourist exchange rate of 250 dinara to the [[Pound sterling|British pound]] was established.\n\n===World War II (1941\u201345)===\nIn 1941, Yugoslavia was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] and split up, with the dinar remaining currency in [[Nedi\u0107's Serbia]] as [[Serbian dinar]]). The [[Independent State of Croatia kuna|kuna]] was introduced in [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] ([[Independent State of Croatia]]) at par with the dinar, whilst the [[Bulgarian lev]], [[Italian lira]] and [[German reichsmark|German Reichsmark]] circulated in those part of Yugoslavia occupied by these countries.\n\n===1944\u201365; Federation dinar===\nIn 1944, as Yugoslavia began to be reconstituted, the Yugoslav dinar replaced the [[Serbian dinar]], [[Independent State of Croatia kuna]] and other occupation currencies, with the rates of exchanged being 1 Yugoslav dinar = 20 Serbian dinara = 40 kuna. In May 1945, a peg of 50 dinara = 1 [[U.S. dollar]] was established but was not maintained.\n\n===1966\u201389; Hard dinar, YUD===\nOn January 1, 1966, the first of five revaluations took place, at a ratio of 100 to 1. This currency was never very stable, suffering from an inflation rate of 15 to 25 percent per year. In the late 1980s the inflation rate accelerated, causing the currency to be revalued at the beginning of 1990.\n\n===1990\u201392; Convertible dinar, YUN===\n{|align=\"right\" style=\"margin-right: 1em;\"\n|[[File:Emblem of SFR Yugoslavia.svg|thumb|150px|Coat of arms of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.]]\n|}\nThe second revaluation took place on January 1, 1990, at a ratio of 10,000 to 1. During this period, the constituent republics began to leave the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. Four of the six republics declared independence and issued their own currencies shortly after. This was the last dinar that bore the [[Coat of arms of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|coat of arms]] and the name of the \"Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\" in multiple languages.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Country\n!Currency\n!ISO code\n!Date adopted\n!Value\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[Slovenia]]\n|align=\"left\"|[[Slovenian tolar]]\n|SIT\n| 8 October 1991\n| 1 dinar of 1990\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[Croatia]]\n|align=\"left\"|[[Croatian dinar]]\n|HRD\n| 23 December 1991\n| 1 dinar of 1990\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[North Macedonia]]\n|align=\"left\"|[[Macedonian denar]]\n|MKN\n| 26 April 1992\n| 1 dinar of 1990\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]\n|align=\"left\"|[[Bosnia and Herzegovina dinar|Bosnian dinar]]\n|BAD\n| 1 July 1992\n| 1 dinar of 1992\n|-\n|}\nSerbian enclaves in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina also issued currencies in dinar, equivalent to and revalued together with the Yugoslav dinar. These were the [[Krajina dinar]] and the [[Republika Srpska dinar]].\n\n===July 1992 \u2013 September 1993; Reformed dinar, YUR===\nThe third revaluation took place on 1 July 1992, at a ratio of 10 to 1. [[Hyperinflation in Yugoslavia|Hyperinflation in the country]] began during this currency's period of circulation. This dinar was issued in the then [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], which consisted of the remaining republics of [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]. People started to use foreign [[hard currency]], such as Deutschmarks, to mitigate some of the problems of hyperinflation. (This federation split in 2006 and Montenegro currently uses the Euro as its currency, though it [[International status and usage of the euro|does not mint it]].)\n\n===October\u2013December 1993 dinar, YUO===\n[[File:500000000000 dinars.jpg|150px|right]]\nYugoslavia re-denominated the dinar for the fourth time on 1 October 1993, at a ratio of 1 million to 1. This did not mitigate the hyperinflation, and the 1993 dinar ([[ISO 4217|ISO 4217 code]]: YUO) lasted for only three months.\n\nCoinage became redundant. The 1993 dinar had the largest denomination out of all incarnations of Yugoslavian currency: the banknote, featuring [[Jovan Jovanovi\u0107 Zmaj]] had a face value of 500 billion ({{val|5|e=11}}) dinara (right). Wages became worthless; if paid in cash, workers had to rush out and spend their wages before they lost their value overnight. Many businesses started to pay wages in goods instead, and a simple barter system developed. Businesses with good connections to politicians could still get access to hard currency. Some shops, instead of [[Menu cost|rewriting their prices]] several times a day, started pricing goods in \"bods\" (points), often equivalent to hard currency such as one Deutschmark. The winter of 1993 was particularly hard for pensioners; if a monthly pension was spent immediately, it was still barely enough to buy three litres of milk. Many people relied on connections to friends and family abroad (who could provide hard currency) or in the countryside (who could grow food).<ref>{{cite book|last=Judah|title=The Serbs|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-15826-7}}</ref>\n\n===1994 dinar, YUG===\n[[File:10000000-Dinara-1994.JPG|150px|right]]\nYugoslavia re-denominated the dinar for the fifth time on 1 January 1994, at a ratio of 1 billion ({{val|e=9}}) to 1.\n\nThe 1994 dinar ([[ISO 4217|ISO 4217 code]]: YUG) was the shortest-lived out of all incarnations of Yugoslavian currency, as [[hyperinflation]] continued to intensify<ref name=\"RadioNetherlands\">[http://www.radionetherlandsarchives.org/yugoslavia-on-the-brink/ Yugoslavia on the brink, Radio Netherlands Archives, August 8, 1994]</ref>, and only one coin (1 dinar) was issued for it. Towards the end of the 1994 dinar, the National Bank overprinted and reissued 10 million dinara banknotes from the 1992 dinar (right).\n\n===1994\u20132006; Novi dinar, YUM===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\"\n|+'''Reforms of the Yugoslav dinar'''\n!Date\n!Conversion Rate\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|29 November 1944\n|align=\"center\"|20\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|1 January 1966\n|align=\"center\"|100\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|1 January 1990\n|align=\"center\"|10,000\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|1 July 1992\n|align=\"center\"|10\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|1 October 1993\n|align=\"center\"|1,000,000\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|1 January 1994\n|align=\"center\"|1,000,000,000\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|24 January 1994\n|align=\"center\"|~13 million\n|}\nOn 24 January 1994, the ''novi dinar'' (nominative plural: ''novi dinari'', Cyrillic script: \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0440, \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0438; genitive plural: ''novih dinara'', Cyrillic: \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0430; novi means new) was introduced. This was not a revaluation of the dinar. Instead, the novi dinar was pegged at par to the [[German mark|Deutsche Mark]]. On the day of the introduction of the novi dinar, the exchange rate of the previous dinar to the Deutsche Mark, and, hence, to the novi dinar, was approximately 1 DM = 13 million dinara. Despite not being pegged to the newest currency, the previous dinar did not fall further in value, remaining at about 12 million \"1994\" dinar to the novi dinar.<ref>[http://www.scc.rutgers.edu/serbian_digest/242/t242-6.htm]</ref> The overall impact of the hyperinflation was that 1 novi dinar equalled approximately 1.2{{E|27}} third (hard) dinara from before 1990, 1.2{{E|29}} Federation dinara, or 2.4 {{E|30}} pre-war dinara. The \"novi\" portion of the name was abandoned in 2000.\n\n===Replacement of the dinar===\nOn 6 November 1999, [[Montenegro]] decided that, besides the Yugoslav dinar, the [[Deutsche Mark]] would also be an official currency. On November 13, 2000, the dinar was dropped in Montenegro and the Deutsche Mark (by that time defined in terms of the [[euro]]) became the only currency. In 2006, the end of Serbia and Montenegro's union following Montenegro's independence declaration led to the dinar, by then only used in Serbia, being replaced by the [[Serbian dinar]].\n\n== Coins ==\n=== 1920 dinar ===\n[[File:Jugoslawien1Dinar1938.jpg|thumb|1 Dinar 1938]]\nIn 1920, the first coins were minted in the name of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. They were zinc 5 and 10 para and nickel-bronze 25 para. These were followed, in 1925, by nickel-bronze 50 para, 1 and 2 dinara. From 1931, coins were minted in the name of Yugoslavia, starting with silver 10 and 20 dinara, followed by silver 50 dinara in 1932. In 1938, aluminium-bronze 50 para, 1 and 2 dinara, nickel 10 dinara and reduced size, silver 20 and 50 dinara were introduced. These were the last coins issued before the [[World War II|Second World War]].\n\n=== 1944 dinar ===\nIn 1945, zinc 50 para, 1, 2 and 5 dinara were introduced, followed in 1953 by aluminium coins for the same denominations. In 1955, aluminium-bronze 10, 20 and 50 dinara were added.\n\n=== 1966 dinar ===\n<gallery mode=packed style=\"line-height:130%\">\nFile:Jugoslavia 5 para.JPG|5 para coin, 1965, front and reverse\nFile:10 para Yugoslav dinar (1965) front.JPG|10 para coin, 1965, front\nFile:10 para Yugoslav dinar (1965) reverse.JPG|10 para coin, 1965, reverse\nFile:20 para Yugoslav dinar (1974) front.JPG|20 para coin, 1974, front\nFile:20 para Yugoslav dinar (1974) reverse.JPG|20 para coin, 1974, reverse\nFile:50 para Yugoslav dinar (1977) front.JPG|50 para coin, 1977, front\nFile:50 para Yugoslav dinar (1977) reverse.JPG|50 para coin, 1977, reverse\nFile:1 Yugoslav dinar (1978) front.JPG|1 dinar coin, 1978, front\nFile:1 Yugoslav Dinar (1978) reverse.JPG|1 dinar coin, 1978, reverse\nFile:Yugoslav Dinar 977 02.PNG|additional assorted coins, front\nFile:Yugoslav Dinar 977 01.PNG|additional assorted coins, reverse\n</gallery>\nIn 1966, brass 5, 10, 20 and 50 para, and cupro-nickel 1 dinar coins (dated 1965) were introduced. In 1971, nickel-brass 2 and 5 dinara were introduced, followed by cupro-nickel 10 dinara in 1976. Production of 5, 10 and 20 para coins ceased in 1981, with bronze 25 and 50 para being introduced the following year. Nickel-brass 20, 50 and 100 dinara were introduced in 1985 and production of all coins less than 10 dinara stopped the next year. In 1988, brass 10, 20, 50 and 100 dinara were introduced. These four coins were issued until 1989.\n\n=== 1990 dinar ===\nIn 1990, coins for 10, 20 and 50 para, 1, 2 and 5 dinara were introduced.  The highest two denominations were minted in small numbers in 1992, the other denominations having ceased production in 1991.\n\n=== 1992 dinar ===\nCoins were issued for this currency in 1992 in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 50 dinara. The 1, 2 and 5 dinara were bronze, whilst the 10 and 50 dinara were nickel-brass. The coins bore the state title \"Yugoslavia\" (Jugoslavija in the [[Gaj's Latin alphabet|Latin]] alphabet and \u0408\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0458\u0430 in [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]) in its simplest form without any modifier.\n\n=== 1993 dinar ===\nCoins were issued in 1993 in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 50 dinara struck in nickel-brass, and 100 dinara struck in brass. Brass 500 dinara coins were also struck but not issued, most being remelted. The design of these coins was similar to that of coins of the fifth dinar, except that the sixth dinar coins bore the state title \"FR Yugoslavia\" (SR Jugoslavija in Latin and \u0421\u0420 \u0408\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0458\u0430 in Cyrillic).\n\n=== 1994 dinar ===\nOnly one coin type was struck for this short-lived currency, a brass 1 dinar.\n\n=== Novi dinar ===\nIn 1994, brass 1 and 5 para, and nickel-brass 10 and 50 para, and 1 novi dinar were introduced. In 2000 the word novi was dropped from the currency and new, brass 50 para, 1, 2 and 5 dinara coins were introduced.\n\n== Banknotes ==\n{{main|Banknotes of the Yugoslav dinar}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Money|Numismatics}}\n* [[Serbian dinar]]\n* [[Hyperinflation]]\n* [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]\n* [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]\n* [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]\n* [[Economy of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]\n* [[Alija Sirotanovi\u0107]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Cuhaj |first1=George S. |year=2010|title=Standard Catalog of World Paper Money General Issues (1368-1960)|work= |volume= |issue= |pages = |publisher=Krause Publications |doi= |url= https://books.google.com/books/about/Standard_Catalog_Of_World_Paper_Money_Ge.html?id=BuNA39dnuHsC  |accessdate=|edition=13|isbn=978-1-4402-1293-2}}\n* {{numis cite SCWC | date=1991}}\n* {{numis cite SCWPM | date=1994}}\n* {{numis cite SCWPM | date=1960.8}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110713032744/http://www.infotech2003.com/catalogue/World/cata.asp?Country=Yugoslavia Yugoslavia] n banknotes at Infotech 2003\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Money of Yugoslavia}}\n* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1022731.stm BBC News: Montenegro drops Yugoslav dinar]\n* http://www.rogershermansociety.com/yugoslavia.htm\n\n{{Currencies of Former Yugoslavia}}\n\n{{Dinar}}\n\n[[Category:Modern obsolete currencies]]\n[[Category:Currencies of Europe]]\n[[Category:Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Dinar]]\n[[Category:Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Dinar]]\n[[Category:Serbia and Montenegro]]\n[[Category:1918 establishments in Yugoslavia|Dinar]]\n[[Category:2003 disestablishments in Serbia and Montenegro]]\n[[Category:Currencies of Yugoslavia|Dinar]]\n[[Category:Currencies introduced in 1918]]\n", "name_user": "Illegitimate Barrister", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReplacement of the dinar", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslav_dinar"}

He is known as the discoverer of [[Grimm's law]] of linguistics, the co-author of the monumental ''[[Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch]]'', the author of ''[[Deutsche Mythologie]]'', and the editor of ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tales]]''. He was the elder of the [[Brothers Grimm]].\n\n==Life and books==\n\nJacob Grimm was born 4 January 1785,<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.upi.com/Top_News/2019/01/04/UPI-Almanac-for-Friday-Jan-4-2019/5471546221584/|title=UPI Almanac for Friday, Jan. 4, 2019|agency=[[United Press International]]|date=4 January 2019|accessdate=4 September 2019|archivedate=5 January 2019 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20190105012355/http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2019/01/04/UPI-Almanac-for-Friday-Jan-4-2019/5471546221584/|url-status=live|quote=German folklore/fairy tale collector Jacob Grimm in 1785}}</ref> in [[Hanau]] in [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]]. His father, [[Philipp Grimm]], was a lawyer who died while Jacob was a child, and his mother was left with a very small income. Her sister was lady of the chamber to the [[Landgravine]] of Hesse, and she helped to support and educate the family. Jacob was sent to the public school at [[Kassel]] in 1798 with his younger brother [[Wilhelm Grimm|Wilhelm]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn 1802, he went to the [[University of Marburg]] where he studied law, a profession for which he had been intended by his father. His brother joined him at Marburg a year later, having just recovered from a severe illness, and likewise began the study of law.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Meeting von Savigny===\nJacob Grimm became inspired by the lectures of [[Friedrich Karl von Savigny]], a noted expert of [[Roman law]]; Wilhelm Grimm, in the preface to the ''Deutsche Grammatik'' (German Grammar), credits Savigny with giving the brothers an awareness of science. Savigny's lectures also awakened in Jacob a love for [[history|historical]] and [[classical antiquity|antiquarian]] investigation, which underlies all his work. It was in Savigny's library that Grimm first saw [[Johann Jakob Bodmer|Bodmer]]'s edition of the [[Middle High German]] minnesingers and other early texts, which gave him a desire to study their language.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn the beginning of 1805, he was invited by Savigny to Paris, to help him in his literary work. There Grimm strengthened his taste for the [[Medieval literature|literature of the Middle Ages]]. Towards the close of the year, he returned to Kassel, where his mother and brother had settled after Wilhelm finished his studies. The following year, Jacob obtained a position in the war office with a small salary of 100 [[thalers]]. He complained that he had to exchange his stylish Paris suit for a stiff uniform and pigtail, but the role gave him spare time for the pursuit of his studies.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Librarianship===\nIn 1808, soon after the death of his mother, he was appointed superintendent of the private library of [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte]], King of [[Kingdom of Westphalia|Westphalia]], into which [[Electorate of Hesse|Hesse-Kassel]] had been incorporated by [[Napoleon]]. Grimm was appointed an auditor to the state council, while retaining his superintendent post. His salary rose to 4000 francs and his official duties were nominal. In 1813, after the expulsion of Bonaparte and the reinstatement of an elector, Grimm was appointed Secretary of Legation accompanying the Hessian minister to the headquarters of the allied army. In 1814, he was sent to Paris to demand restitution of books taken by the French, and he attended the [[Congress of Vienna]] as Secretary of Legation in 1814\u20131815. Upon his return from Vienna, he was sent to Paris again to secure book restitutions. Meanwhile, Wilhelm had obtained a job at the [[Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek Kassel|Kassel library]], and Jacob was made second librarian under Volkel in 1816. Upon the death of Volkel in 1828, the brothers both expected promotion, and they were dissatisfied when the role of first librarian was given to Rommel, the keeper of the archives. Consequently, they moved the following year to [[university of G\u00f6ttingen|G\u00f6ttingen]], where Jacob was appointed professor and librarian, and Wilhelm under-librarian. Jacob Grimm lectured on legal antiquities, [[historical linguistics|historical grammar]], [[literary history]], and [[diplomatics]], explained Old German poems, and commented on the ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' of [[Tacitus]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Later work===\n[[File:Elisabet Ney - Bust of Jacob Grimm (1856-58).jpg|thumb|[[Jacob Grimm (sculpture)|Marble bust]] of Grimm by [[Elisabet Ney]], carved 1856\u201358 in Berlin]]\nGrimm joined other academics, known as the [[G\u00f6ttingen Seven]], who signed a protest against the [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover|King of Hanover]]'s abrogation of the liberal constitution which had been established some years before.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nichols |first1=Stephen G. |title=Medievalism and the Modernist Temper |date=1996 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |page=143}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Andrews |first1=Charles McLean |title=The Historical Development of Modern Europe: From the Congress of Vienna to the Present Time, Volumes 1-2 |date=1898 |publisher=G.

He returned to Kassel with his brother, who had also signed the protest. They remained there until 1840, when they accepted King [[Frederick William IV]]'s invitation to move to Berlin, where they both received professorships and were elected members of the Academy of Sciences. Grimm was not under any obligation to lecture, and seldom did so; he spent his time working with his brother on their dictionary project. During their time in Kassel, he regularly attended the meetings of the academy and read papers on varied subjects, including [[Karl Konrad Friedrich Wilhelm Lachmann]], [[Friedrich Schiller]], old age, and the origin of language. He described his impressions of Italian and Scandinavian travel, interspersing more general observations with linguistic details.<ref name=EB1911/> He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1857.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780\u20132010: Chapter G|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterG.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=9 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nGrimm died in Berlin at the age of 78, working until the very end of his life. He describes his own work at the end of his autobiography:\n\n<blockquote>\nNearly all my labours have been devoted, either directly or indirectly, to the investigation of our earlier language, poetry and laws. These studies may have appeared to many, and may still appear, useless; to me they have always seemed a noble and earnest task, definitely and inseparably connected with our common fatherland, and calculated to foster the love of it. My principle has always been in these investigations to under-value nothing, but to utilize the small for the illustration of the great, the popular tradition for the elucidation of the written monuments.<ref name=EB1911/>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Linguistic work==\n\n===''History of the German Language''===\n[[File:Letter from Jacob Grimm to Jan Frans Willems, Berlin, 26 april 1844.jpg|thumb|During the research for his 'History of the German Language' Grimm corresponded with numerous colleagues. Ghent University Library holds several letters between Jacob Grimm and Jan Frans Willems.]]\nGrimm's ''Geschichte der deutschen Sprache'' (History of the German Language) explores German history hidden in the words of the German language and is the oldest linguistic history of the Teutonic tribes. He collected scattered words and allusions from classical literature and tried to determine the relationship between the German language and those of the [[Getae]], Thracians, Scythians, and other nations whose languages were known only through Greek and Latin authors. Grimm's results were later greatly modified by a wider range of available comparison and improved methods of investigation. Many questions that he raised remain obscure due to the lack of surviving records of the languages, but his book's influence was profound.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===''German Grammar''===\nGrimm's famous ''Deutsche Grammatik'' (German Grammar) was the outcome of his purely philological work. He drew on the work of past generations, from the humanists onwards, consulting an enormous collection of materials in the form of text editions, dictionaries, and grammars, mostly uncritical and unreliable. Some work had been done in the way of comparison and determination of general laws, and the concept of a comparative Germanic grammar had been grasped by the Englishman [[George Hickes (divine)|George Hickes]] by the beginning of the 18th century, in his ''Thesaurus''. [[Jan Jakob Lodewijk ten Kate|Ten Kate]] in the Netherlands had made valuable contributions to the history and comparison of Germanic languages. Grimm himself did not initially intend to include all the languages in his ''Grammar'', but he soon found that [[Old High German]] postulated [[Gothic language|Gothic]], and that the later stages of German could not be understood without the help of other [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] varieties including English, and that the [[literature of Scandinavia]] could not be ignored. The first edition of the first part of the ''Grammar'', which appeared in 1819, treated the inflections of all these languages, and included a general introduction in which he vindicated the importance of an historical study of the German language against the quasi-philosophical methods then in vogue.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn 1822 the book appeared in a second edition (really a new work, for, as Grimm himself says in the preface, he had to \"mow the first crop down to the ground\"). The considerable gap between the two stages of Grimm's development of these editions is shown by the fact that the second volume addresses phonology in 600 pages \u2013 more than half the volume. Grimm had concluded that all philology must be based on rigorous adherence to the laws of [[sound change]], and he subsequently never deviated from this principle. This gave to all his investigations a consistency and force of conviction that had been lacking in the study of philology before his day.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nHis advances have been attributed mainly to the influence of his contemporary [[Rasmus Christian Rask]]. Rask was two years younger than Grimm, but the Icelandic paradigms in Grimm's first editions, his Icelandic paradigms are based entirely on Rask's grammar; in his second edition, he relied almost entirely on Rask for Old English. His debt to Rask is shown by comparing his treatment of [[Old English language|Old English]] in the two editions. For example, in the first edition he declines ''d\u00e6g, d\u00e6ges'', plural ''d\u00e6gas'', without having observed the law of [[vowel shift|vowel-change]] pointed out by Rask. (The correct plural is ''dagas.'') The appearance of Rask's Old English grammar was probably the primary impetus for Grimm to recast his work from the beginning. Rask was also the first to clearly formulate the laws of sound-correspondence in the different languages, especially in the vowels (previously ignored by [[etymologist]]s).<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe ''Grammar'' was continued in three volumes, treating principally derivation, composition and [[syntax]], the last of which was unfinished. Grimm then began a third edition, of which only one part, comprising the vowels, appeared in 1840, his time being afterwards taken up mainly by the dictionary. The ''Grammar'' is noted for its comprehensiveness, method and fullness of detail, with all his points illustrated by an almost exhaustive mass of material, and it has served as a model for all succeeding investigators. [[Friedrich Christian Diez|Diez]]'s grammar of the [[Romance language]]s is founded entirely on Grimm's methods, which have had a profound influence on the wider study of the [[Indo-European languages]] in general.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Grimm's law===\n{{Main|Grimm's law}}\nJacob is recognized for enunciating [[Grimm's law]], the Germanic Sound Shift, which was first observed by the Danish philologist [[Rasmus Christian Rask]]. Grimm's law was the first non-trivial systematic [[sound change]] to be discovered. Grimm's law, also known as the \"Rask-Grimm Rule\" or the First Germanic Sound Shift, was the first law in linguistics concerning a non-trivial [[sound change]].  It was a turning point in the development of linguistics, allowing the introduction of a rigorous methodology to historic linguistic research.  It concerns the correspondence of consonants between the ancestral [[Proto-Indo-European language]] and its [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] descendants, [[Low German|Low Saxon]] and [[High German languages|High German]], and was first fully stated by Grimm in the second edition of the first part of his ''Grammar''. The correspondence of single consonants had been more or less clearly recognized by several of his predecessors, including [[Friedrich von Schlegel]], Rasmus Christian Rask and [[Johan Ihre]], the last having established a considerable number of ''literarum permutationes'', such as '''b''' for '''f''', with the examples ''b\u0153ra''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''ferre'' (\"to bear\"), ''befwer''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''fibra'' (\"fiber\"). Rask, in his essay on the origin of the [[Icelandic language]], gave the same comparisons, with a few additions and corrections, and even the same examples in most cases. As Grimm in the preface to his first edition expressly mentioned Rask's essay, there is every probability that it inspired his own investigations. But there is a wide difference between the isolated permutations described by his predecessors and his own comprehensive generalizations. The extension of the law to High German in any case is entirely Grimm's work.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe idea that Grimm wished to deprive Rask of his claims to priority is based on the fact that he does not expressly mention Rask's results in his second edition, but it was always his plan to refrain from all controversy or reference to the works of others. In his first edition, he calls attention to Rask's essay, and praises it ungrudgingly. Nevertheless, a certain bitterness of feeling afterwards sprang up between Grimm and Rask, after Rask refused to consider the value of Grimm's views when they clashed with his own.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===''German Dictionary''===\nGrimm's monumental [[dictionary]] of the [[German Language]], the ''[[Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch]]'', was started in 1838 and first published in 1854. The Brothers anticipated it would take 10 years and encompass some six to seven volumes. However, it was undertaken on so large a scale as to make it impossible for them to complete it. The dictionary, as far as it was worked on by Grimm himself, has been described as a collection of disconnected antiquarian essays of high value.<ref name=EB1911/> It was finally finished by subsequent scholars in 1961 and supplemented in 1971. At 33 volumes at some 330,000 headwords, it remains a standard work of reference to the present day. A current project at the [[Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities]] is underway to update the ''Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch'' to modern academic standards. Volumes A\u2013F were scheduled for release in 2012.\n\n==Literary work==\nThe first work Jacob Grimm published, ''\u00dcber den altdeutschen Meistergesang'' (1811), was of a purely literary character. Yet even in this essay Grimm showed that ''[[Minnesang]]'' and ''[[Meistersinger|Meistergesang]]'' were really one form of poetry, of which they merely represented different stages of development, and also announced his important discovery of the invariable division of the ''Lied'' into three strophic parts.\n\nGrimm's text-editions were mostly prepared in conjunction with his brother. In 1812 they published the two ancient fragments of the ''[[Lay of Hildebrand|Hildebrandslied]]'' and the ''[[Wessobrunn Prayer|Wei\u00dfenbrunner Gebet]]'', Jacob having discovered what till then had never been suspected \u2014 namely the [[alliteration]] in these poems. However, Jacob had little taste for text editing, and, as he himself confessed, working on a critical text gave him little pleasure. He therefore left this department to others, especially Lachmann, who soon turned his brilliant critical genius, trained in the severe school of classical philology, to Old and [[Middle High German]] poetry and metre.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nBoth Brothers were attracted from the beginning by all national poetry, whether in the form of epics, ballads or popular tales. They published In 1816\u20131818 a collection of legends culled from diverse sources and published the two-volume ''Deutsche Sagen'' (German Legends). At the same time they collected all the folktales they could find, partly from the mouths of the people, partly from manuscripts and books, and published in 1812\u20131815 the first edition of those ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen]]'' (Children's and Household Tales), which has carried the name of the brothers Grimm into every household of the western world. The closely related subject of the satirical [[beast epic]] of the [[Middle Ages]] also held great charm for Jacob Grimm, and he published an edition of the ''Reinhart Fuchs'' in 1834. His first contribution to mythology was the first volume of an edition of the [[Edda]]ic songs, undertaken jointly with his brother, and was published in 1815. However, this work was not followed by any others on the subject.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe first edition of his ''[[Deutsche Mythologie]]'' (German Mythology) appeared in 1835. This work covered the whole range of the subject, attempting to trace the mythology and superstitions of the old [[Teutons]] back to the very dawn of direct evidence, and following their evolution to modern-day popular traditions, tales, and expressions.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==Legal scholarship==\nGrimm's work as a jurist was influential for the development of the [[history of law]], particularly in Northern Europe.\n\nHis essay ''Von der Poesie im Recht'' (''Poetry in Law'', 1816) developed a far-reaching, suprapositivist Romantic conception of law. The ''Deutsche Rechtsalterth\u00fcmer'' (''German Legal Antiquities'', 1828) was a comprehensive compilation of sources of law from all Germanic languages, whose structure allowed an initial understanding of older German legal traditions not influenced by Roman law. Grimm's ''[[Weisth\u00fcmer]]'' (4 vol., 1840\u201363), a compilation of partially oral legal traditions from rural Germany, allows research of the development of written law in Northern Europe.<ref>{{cite book | last= Dilcher | first= Gerhard |pages= 262 | chapter= Grimm, Jakob\n|editor= Michael Stolleis |title= Juristen: ein biographisches Lexikon; von der Antike bis zum 20.

His work on both fairy tales and philology dealt with the country's origins. He wished for a united Germany, and, like his brother, supported the [[liberalism|Liberal]] movement for a constitutional monarchy and civil liberties, as demonstrated by their involvement in the [[G\u00f6ttingen Seven|G\u00f6ttingen Seven protest]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Zipes |first1=Jack |title=The Brothers Grimm: From Enchanted Forests to the Modern World, Second Edition |date=2002 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |pages=19\u201320 & 158}}</ref><ref name=\"NYTimes\" /> In the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German revolution of 1848]], he was elected to the [[Frankfurt Parliament|Frankfurt National Parliament]]. The people of Germany had demanded a constitution, so the Parliament, formed of elected members from various German states, met to form one. Grimm was selected for the office largely because of his part in the University of Goettingen's refusal to swear to the king of Hanover. He then went to Frankfurt, where he made some speeches, and was adamant that the Danish-ruled but German-speaking duchy of [[Holstein]] to be under German control. Grimm soon became disillusioned with the National Assembly and asked to be released from his duties to return to his studies.\n\n== Death ==\nJacob Grimm died on 20 September 1863, in Berlin, Germany from disease<ref name=\"NYTimes\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1863/10/09/archives/obituary-death-of-jacob-grimm.html|title=Obituary.; DEATH OF JACOB GRIMM.|date=9 October 1863|work=The New York Times|access-date=6 March 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/jacob-grimm-21085187|title=Jacob Grimm|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=6 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\nThe following is a complete list of Grimm's separately published works.

He is known as the discoverer of [[Grimm's law]] of linguistics, the co-author of the monumental ''[[Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch]]'', the author of ''[[Deutsche Mythologie]]'', and the editor of ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tales]]''. He was the elder of the [[Brothers Grimm]].\n\n==Life and books==\n\nJacob Grimm was born 4 January 1785,<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.upi.com/Top_News/2019/01/04/UPI-Almanac-for-Friday-Jan-4-2019/5471546221584/|title=UPI Almanac for Friday, Jan. 4, 2019|agency=[[United Press International]]|date=4 January 2019|accessdate=4 September 2019|archivedate=5 January 2019 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20190105012355/http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2019/01/04/UPI-Almanac-for-Friday-Jan-4-2019/5471546221584/|url-status=live|quote=German folklore/fairy tale collector Jacob Grimm in 1785}}</ref> in [[Hanau]] in [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]]. His father, [[Philipp Grimm]], was a lawyer who died while Jacob was a child, and his mother was left with a very small income. Her sister was lady of the chamber to the [[Landgravine]] of Hesse, and she helped to support and educate the family. Jacob was sent to the public school at [[Kassel]] in 1798 with his younger brother [[Wilhelm Grimm|Wilhelm]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn 1802, he went to the [[University of Marburg]] where he studied law, a profession for which he had been intended by his father. His brother joined him at Marburg a year later, having just recovered from a severe illness, and likewise began the study of law.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Meeting von Savigny===\nJacob Grimm became inspired by the lectures of [[Friedrich Karl von Savigny]], a noted expert of [[Roman law]]; Wilhelm Grimm, in the preface to the ''Deutsche Grammatik'' (German Grammar), credits Savigny with giving the brothers an awareness of science. Savigny's lectures also awakened in Jacob a love for [[history|historical]] and [[classical antiquity|antiquarian]] investigation, which underlies all his work. It was in Savigny's library that Grimm first saw [[Johann Jakob Bodmer|Bodmer]]'s edition of the [[Middle High German]] minnesingers and other early texts, which gave him a desire to study their language.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn the beginning of 1805, he was invited by Savigny to Paris, to help him in his literary work. There Grimm strengthened his taste for the [[Medieval literature|literature of the Middle Ages]]. Towards the close of the year, he returned to Kassel, where his mother and brother had settled after Wilhelm finished his studies. The following year, Jacob obtained a position in the war office with a small salary of 100 [[thalers]]. He complained that he had to exchange his stylish Paris suit for a stiff uniform and pigtail, but the role gave him spare time for the pursuit of his studies.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Librarianship===\nIn 1808, soon after the death of his mother, he was appointed superintendent of the private library of [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte]], King of [[Kingdom of Westphalia|Westphalia]], into which [[Electorate of Hesse|Hesse-Kassel]] had been incorporated by [[Napoleon]]. Grimm was appointed an auditor to the state council, while retaining his superintendent post. His salary rose to 4000 francs and his official duties were nominal. In 1813, after the expulsion of Bonaparte and the reinstatement of an elector, Grimm was appointed Secretary of Legation accompanying the Hessian minister to the headquarters of the allied army. In 1814, he was sent to Paris to demand restitution of books taken by the French, and he attended the [[Congress of Vienna]] as Secretary of Legation in 1814\u20131815. Upon his return from Vienna, he was sent to Paris again to secure book restitutions. Meanwhile, Wilhelm had obtained a job at the [[Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek Kassel|Kassel library]], and Jacob was made second librarian under Volkel in 1816. Upon the death of Volkel in 1828, the brothers both expected promotion, and they were dissatisfied when the role of first librarian was given to Rommel, the keeper of the archives. Consequently, they moved the following year to [[university of G\u00f6ttingen|G\u00f6ttingen]], where Jacob was appointed professor and librarian, and Wilhelm under-librarian. Jacob Grimm lectured on legal antiquities, [[historical linguistics|historical grammar]], [[literary history]], and [[diplomatics]], explained Old German poems, and commented on the ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' of [[Tacitus]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Later work===\n[[File:Elisabet Ney - Bust of Jacob Grimm (1856-58).jpg|thumb|[[Jacob Grimm (sculpture)|Marble bust]] of Grimm by [[Elisabet Ney]], carved 1856\u201358 in Berlin]]\nGrimm joined other academics, known as the [[G\u00f6ttingen Seven]], who signed a protest against the [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover|King of Hanover]]'s abrogation of the liberal constitution which had been established some years before.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nichols |first1=Stephen G. |title=Medievalism and the Modernist Temper |date=1996 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |page=143}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Andrews |first1=Charles McLean |title=The Historical Development of Modern Europe: From the Congress of Vienna to the Present Time, Volumes 1-2 |date=1898 |publisher=G.

He returned to Kassel with his brother, who had also signed the protest. They remained there until 1840, when they accepted King [[Frederick William IV]]'s invitation to move to Berlin, where they both received professorships and were elected members of the Academy of Sciences. Grimm was not under any obligation to lecture, and seldom did so; he spent his time working with his brother on their dictionary project. During their time in Kassel, he regularly attended the meetings of the academy and read papers on varied subjects, including [[Karl Konrad Friedrich Wilhelm Lachmann]], [[Friedrich Schiller]], old age, and the origin of language. He described his impressions of Italian and Scandinavian travel, interspersing more general observations with linguistic details.<ref name=EB1911/> He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1857.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780\u20132010: Chapter G|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterG.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=9 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nGrimm died in Berlin at the age of 78, working until the very end of his life. He describes his own work at the end of his autobiography:\n\n<blockquote>\nNearly all my labours have been devoted, either directly or indirectly, to the investigation of our earlier language, poetry and laws. These studies may have appeared to many, and may still appear, useless; to me they have always seemed a noble and earnest task, definitely and inseparably connected with our common fatherland, and calculated to foster the love of it. My principle has always been in these investigations to under-value nothing, but to utilize the small for the illustration of the great, the popular tradition for the elucidation of the written monuments.<ref name=EB1911/>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Linguistic work==\n\n===''History of the German Language''===\n[[File:Letter from Jacob Grimm to Jan Frans Willems, Berlin, 26 april 1844.jpg|thumb|During the research for his 'History of the German Language' Grimm corresponded with numerous colleagues. Ghent University Library holds several letters between Jacob Grimm and Jan Frans Willems.]]\nGrimm's ''Geschichte der deutschen Sprache'' (History of the German Language) explores German history hidden in the words of the German language and is the oldest linguistic history of the Teutonic tribes. He collected scattered words and allusions from classical literature and tried to determine the relationship between the German language and those of the [[Getae]], Thracians, Scythians, and other nations whose languages were known only through Greek and Latin authors. Grimm's results were later greatly modified by a wider range of available comparison and improved methods of investigation. Many questions that he raised remain obscure due to the lack of surviving records of the languages, but his book's influence was profound.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===''German Grammar''===\nGrimm's famous ''Deutsche Grammatik'' (German Grammar) was the outcome of his purely philological work. He drew on the work of past generations, from the humanists onwards, consulting an enormous collection of materials in the form of text editions, dictionaries, and grammars, mostly uncritical and unreliable. Some work had been done in the way of comparison and determination of general laws, and the concept of a comparative Germanic grammar had been grasped by the Englishman [[George Hickes (divine)|George Hickes]] by the beginning of the 18th century, in his ''Thesaurus''. [[Jan Jakob Lodewijk ten Kate|Ten Kate]] in the Netherlands had made valuable contributions to the history and comparison of Germanic languages. Grimm himself did not initially intend to include all the languages in his ''Grammar'', but he soon found that [[Old High German]] postulated [[Gothic language|Gothic]], and that the later stages of German could not be understood without the help of other [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] varieties including English, and that the [[literature of Scandinavia]] could not be ignored. The first edition of the first part of the ''Grammar'', which appeared in 1819, treated the inflections of all these languages, and included a general introduction in which he vindicated the importance of an historical study of the German language against the quasi-philosophical methods then in vogue.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn 1822 the book appeared in a second edition (really a new work, for, as Grimm himself says in the preface, he had to \"mow the first crop down to the ground\"). The considerable gap between the two stages of Grimm's development of these editions is shown by the fact that the second volume addresses phonology in 600 pages \u2013 more than half the volume. Grimm had concluded that all philology must be based on rigorous adherence to the laws of [[sound change]], and he subsequently never deviated from this principle. This gave to all his investigations a consistency and force of conviction that had been lacking in the study of philology before his day.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nHis advances have been attributed mainly to the influence of his contemporary [[Rasmus Christian Rask]]. Rask was two years younger than Grimm, but the Icelandic paradigms in Grimm's first editions, his Icelandic paradigms are based entirely on Rask's grammar; in his second edition, he relied almost entirely on Rask for Old English. His debt to Rask is shown by comparing his treatment of [[Old English language|Old English]] in the two editions. For example, in the first edition he declines ''d\u00e6g, d\u00e6ges'', plural ''d\u00e6gas'', without having observed the law of [[vowel shift|vowel-change]] pointed out by Rask. (The correct plural is ''dagas.'') The appearance of Rask's Old English grammar was probably the primary impetus for Grimm to recast his work from the beginning. Rask was also the first to clearly formulate the laws of sound-correspondence in the different languages, especially in the vowels (previously ignored by [[etymologist]]s).<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe ''Grammar'' was continued in three volumes, treating principally derivation, composition and [[syntax]], the last of which was unfinished. Grimm then began a third edition, of which only one part, comprising the vowels, appeared in 1840, his time being afterwards taken up mainly by the dictionary. The ''Grammar'' is noted for its comprehensiveness, method and fullness of detail, with all his points illustrated by an almost exhaustive mass of material, and it has served as a model for all succeeding investigators. [[Friedrich Christian Diez|Diez]]'s grammar of the [[Romance language]]s is founded entirely on Grimm's methods, which have had a profound influence on the wider study of the [[Indo-European languages]] in general.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Grimm's law===\n{{Main|Grimm's law}}\nJacob is recognized for enunciating [[Grimm's law]], the Germanic Sound Shift, which was first observed by the Danish philologist [[Rasmus Christian Rask]]. Grimm's law was the first non-trivial systematic [[sound change]] to be discovered. Grimm's law, also known as the \"Rask-Grimm Rule\" or the First Germanic Sound Shift, was the first law in linguistics concerning a non-trivial [[sound change]].  It was a turning point in the development of linguistics, allowing the introduction of a rigorous methodology to historic linguistic research.  It concerns the correspondence of consonants between the ancestral [[Proto-Indo-European language]] and its [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] descendants, [[Low German|Low Saxon]] and [[High German languages|High German]], and was first fully stated by Grimm in the second edition of the first part of his ''Grammar''. The correspondence of single consonants had been more or less clearly recognized by several of his predecessors, including [[Friedrich von Schlegel]], Rasmus Christian Rask and [[Johan Ihre]], the last having established a considerable number of ''literarum permutationes'', such as '''b''' for '''f''', with the examples ''b\u0153ra''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''ferre'' (\"to bear\"), ''befwer''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''fibra'' (\"fiber\"). Rask, in his essay on the origin of the [[Icelandic language]], gave the same comparisons, with a few additions and corrections, and even the same examples in most cases. As Grimm in the preface to his first edition expressly mentioned Rask's essay, there is every probability that it inspired his own investigations. But there is a wide difference between the isolated permutations described by his predecessors and his own comprehensive generalizations. The extension of the law to High German in any case is entirely Grimm's work.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe idea that Grimm wished to deprive Rask of his claims to priority is based on the fact that he does not expressly mention Rask's results in his second edition, but it was always his plan to refrain from all controversy or reference to the works of others. In his first edition, he calls attention to Rask's essay, and praises it ungrudgingly. Nevertheless, a certain bitterness of feeling afterwards sprang up between Grimm and Rask, after Rask refused to consider the value of Grimm's views when they clashed with his own.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===''German Dictionary''===\nGrimm's monumental [[dictionary]] of the [[German Language]], the ''[[Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch]]'', was started in 1838 and first published in 1854. The Brothers anticipated it would take 10 years and encompass some six to seven volumes. However, it was undertaken on so large a scale as to make it impossible for them to complete it. The dictionary, as far as it was worked on by Grimm himself, has been described as a collection of disconnected antiquarian essays of high value.<ref name=EB1911/> It was finally finished by subsequent scholars in 1961 and supplemented in 1971. At 33 volumes at some 330,000 headwords, it remains a standard work of reference to the present day. A current project at the [[Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities]] is underway to update the ''Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch'' to modern academic standards. Volumes A\u2013F were scheduled for release in 2012.\n\n==Literary work==\nThe first work Jacob Grimm published, ''\u00dcber den altdeutschen Meistergesang'' (1811), was of a purely literary character. Yet even in this essay Grimm showed that ''[[Minnesang]]'' and ''[[Meistersinger|Meistergesang]]'' were really one form of poetry, of which they merely represented different stages of development, and also announced his important discovery of the invariable division of the ''Lied'' into three strophic parts.\n\nGrimm's text-editions were mostly prepared in conjunction with his brother. In 1812 they published the two ancient fragments of the ''[[Lay of Hildebrand|Hildebrandslied]]'' and the ''[[Wessobrunn Prayer|Wei\u00dfenbrunner Gebet]]'', Jacob having discovered what till then had never been suspected \u2014 namely the [[alliteration]] in these poems. However, Jacob had little taste for text editing, and, as he himself confessed, working on a critical text gave him little pleasure. He therefore left this department to others, especially Lachmann, who soon turned his brilliant critical genius, trained in the severe school of classical philology, to Old and [[Middle High German]] poetry and metre.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nBoth Brothers were attracted from the beginning by all national poetry, whether in the form of epics, ballads or popular tales. They published In 1816\u20131818 a collection of legends culled from diverse sources and published the two-volume ''Deutsche Sagen'' (German Legends). At the same time they collected all the folktales they could find, partly from the mouths of the people, partly from manuscripts and books, and published in 1812\u20131815 the first edition of those ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen]]'' (Children's and Household Tales), which has carried the name of the brothers Grimm into every household of the western world. The closely related subject of the satirical [[beast epic]] of the [[Middle Ages]] also held great charm for Jacob Grimm, and he published an edition of the ''Reinhart Fuchs'' in 1834. His first contribution to mythology was the first volume of an edition of the [[Edda]]ic songs, undertaken jointly with his brother, and was published in 1815. However, this work was not followed by any others on the subject.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe first edition of his ''[[Deutsche Mythologie]]'' (German Mythology) appeared in 1835. This work covered the whole range of the subject, attempting to trace the mythology and superstitions of the old [[Teutons]] back to the very dawn of direct evidence, and following their evolution to modern-day popular traditions, tales, and expressions.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==Legal scholarship==\nGrimm's work as a jurist was influential for the development of the [[history of law]], particularly in Northern Europe.\n\nHis essay ''Von der Poesie im Recht'' (''Poetry in Law'', 1816) developed a far-reaching, suprapositivist Romantic conception of law. The ''Deutsche Rechtsalterth\u00fcmer'' (''German Legal Antiquities'', 1828) was a comprehensive compilation of sources of law from all Germanic languages, whose structure allowed an initial understanding of older German legal traditions not influenced by Roman law. Grimm's ''[[Weisth\u00fcmer]]'' (4 vol., 1840\u201363), a compilation of partially oral legal traditions from rural Germany, allows research of the development of written law in Northern Europe.<ref>{{cite book | last= Dilcher | first= Gerhard |pages= 262 | chapter= Grimm, Jakob\n|editor= Michael Stolleis |title= Juristen: ein biographisches Lexikon; von der Antike bis zum 20.

His work on both fairy tales and philology dealt with the country's origins. He wished for a united Germany, and, like his brother, supported the [[liberalism|Liberal]] movement for a constitutional monarchy and civil liberties, as demonstrated by their involvement in the [[G\u00f6ttingen Seven|G\u00f6ttingen Seven protest]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Zipes |first1=Jack |title=The Brothers Grimm: From Enchanted Forests to the Modern World, Second Edition |date=2002 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |pages=19\u201320 & 158}}</ref><ref name=\"NYTimes\" /> In the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German revolution of 1848]], he was elected to the [[Frankfurt Parliament|Frankfurt National Parliament]]. The people of Germany had demanded a constitution, so the Parliament, formed of elected members from various German states, met to form one. Grimm was selected for the office largely because of his part in the University of Goettingen's refusal to swear to the king of Hanover. He then went to Frankfurt, where he made some speeches, and was adamant that the Danish-ruled but German-speaking duchy of [[Holstein]] to be under German control. Grimm soon became disillusioned with the National Assembly and asked to be released from his duties to return to his studies.\n\n== Death ==\nJacob Grimm died on 20 September 1863, in Berlin, Germany from disease<ref name=\"NYTimes\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1863/10/09/archives/obituary-death-of-jacob-grimm.html|title=Obituary.; DEATH OF JACOB GRIMM.|date=9 October 1863|work=The New York Times|access-date=6 March 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/jacob-grimm-21085187|title=Jacob Grimm|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=6 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\nThe following is a complete list of Grimm's separately published works.

While it is difficult to study human-like theory of mind and mental states in species which we do not yet describe as \"minded\" at all, and about whose potential mental states we have an incomplete understanding, researchers can focus on simpler components of more complex capabilities.\n\nFor example, many researchers focus on animals' understanding of intention, gaze, perspective, or knowledge (or rather, what another being has seen). Part of the difficulty in this line of research is that observed phenomena can often be explained as simple stimulus-response learning, as it is in the nature of any theorizers of mind to have to extrapolate internal mental states from observable behavior. Recently, most non-human theory of mind research has focused on monkeys and great apes, who are of most interest in the study of the evolution of human social cognition.\n\nThere has been some controversy over the interpretation of evidence purporting to show theory of mind ability\u2014or inability\u2014in animals. Two examples serve as demonstration: first, Povinelli et al. (1990)<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0735-7036.104.3.203 | last1 = Povinelli | first1 = D.J. | last2 = Nelson | first2 = K.E. | last3 = Boysen | first3 = S.T. | year = 1990 | title = Inferences about guessing and knowing by chimpanzees (''Pan troglodytes'') | url = https://animalstudiesrepository.org/acwp_asie/143| journal = Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 104 | issue = 3| pages = 203\u2013210 | pmid = 2225758 }}</ref> presented chimpanzees with the choice of two experimenters from which to request food: one who had seen where food was hidden, and one who, by virtue of one of a variety of mechanisms (having a bucket or bag over his head; a blindfold over his eyes; or being turned away from the baiting) does not know, and can only guess. They found that the animals failed in most cases to differentially request food from the \"knower.\" By contrast, Hare, Call, and Tomasello (2001)<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hare | first1 = B. | last2 = Call | first2 = J. | last3 = Tomasello | first3 = M. | year = 2001 | title = Do chimpanzees know what conspecifics know and do not know? | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 61 | issue = 1| pages = 139\u2013151 | pmid = 11170704 | doi = 10.1006/anbe.2000.1518 }}</ref> found that subordinate chimpanzees were able to use the knowledge state of dominant rival chimpanzees to determine which container of hidden food they approached.\n\nTomasello and like-minded colleagues who originally argued that great apes did not have theory of mind have since reversed their position. Povinelli and his colleagues, however, maintain that Tomasello's group has misinterpreted the results of their experiments. They point out that most evidence in support of great ape theory of mind involves naturalistic settings to which the apes may have already adapted through past learning. Their \"reinterpretation hypothesis\" explains away all current evidence supporting attribution of mental states to others in chimpanzees as merely evidence of risk-based learning; that is, the chimpanzees learn through experience that certain behaviors in other chimpanzees have a probability of leading to certain responses, without necessarily attributing knowledge or other intentional states to those other chimpanzees. They therefore propose testing theory of mind abilities in great apes in novel, and not naturalistic settings. Kristin Andrews takes the reinterpretation hypothesis one step further, arguing that it implies that even the well-known [[Sally\u2013Anne test|false-belief test]] used to test children's theory of mind is susceptible to being interpreted as a result of learning.\n\n===Language===\nThe modelling of human language in animals is known as [[animal language]] research. There have been many examples of modelling of human language through entrainment in primates. Most notably are [[Nim Chimpsky]], a chimpanzee; [[Koko (gorilla)|Koko]], a gorilla and [[Kanzi]], a bonobo.  Cognitive abilities are also demonstrated through the natural communication through vocalizations performed by non-human primates in the wild, with sophisticated systems of alarm calls and emotional vocalizations as well as adaptive behavioural responses to other animal's calls.\n\n==== Modeling of human language ====\nThe experiment called Project Nim was one of the first experiments that aimed to show nonhuman primates could be taught a human form of language. The experiment conducted on the chimpanzee dubbed \"[[Nim Chimpsky]]\" took place in the 1970s and was the idea of [[Herbert S. Terrace|Herbet S. Terrace]], to try to disprove the notion put forth by [[Noam Chomsky]], for whom the chimp was named, stating that language is an exclusively human ability. Nim was taught 125 signs in his life, and constantly impressed those he met with his ability to seemingly understand human nature and his mischievous behaviours. Similar experiments took place on two other primates, Koko and Kanzi. Koko was able to learn many signs, as well as some novel vocalizations to indicate emotional state. Kanzi learned to model human language in an entirely different way. He was able to learn 348 geometrical symbols that represented different words, and to combine symbols in a type of proto-grammar to convey meaning and understanding. His keepers also claim that he understands the meaning of up to 3,000 human words. These examples of stunning cognition demonstrate the near-human ability of some trained primates to learn and retain the ability to communicate with humans.{{Citation needed|reason=There is controversy over whether observed primate sign language is a Clever Hans effect|date=April 2019}}\n\n==== Communication in the wild ====\nCommunication of animals in the wild has been studied extensively. Calls with specific intent, such as alarm calls or mating calls has been observed in many orders of animals, including primates.  A study done on East African [[Vervet monkey]]s showed that in the wild this species was able to produce at least 5 acoustically different alarm calls in response to danger, and that other monkeys responded differently according to which alarm had been sounded. This indicated a clear communication that there is a predator nearby and what kind of predator it is, eliciting a specific response.  A different species of monkeys, the wild Campbell's monkeys have also been known to produce a sequence of vocalization that require a specific order to elicit a specific behaviour in other monkeys. Changing the order of the sounds changes the resulting behaviour, or meaning, of the call. [[Diana monkey]]s were studied in a habituation-dishabituation experiment that demonstrated the ability to attend to the semantic content of calls rather than simply to acoustic nature.  Primates have also been observed responding to alarm calls of other species. [[Crested guineafowl|Crested Guinea fowl]], a ground-dwelling fowl, produce a single type of alarm call for all predators it detects. Diana monkeys have been observed to respond to the most likely reason for the call, typically a human or leopard, based on the situation and respond according to that. If they deem a leopard is the more likely predator in the vicinity they will produce their own leopard-specific alarm call but if they think it is a human, they will remain silent and hidden.\n\n===Tool use===\n{{further|Tool use by animals#Primates}}\n[[File:Gorrila tool use-Efi.jpg|thumb|Tool use by a gorilla]]\nThere are many reports of primates making or using tools, both in the wild or when captive. [[Chimpanzee]]s, [[gorilla]]s, [[orangutan]]s, [[capuchin monkeys]], [[baboons]], and [[mandrills]] have all been reported as using tools. The use of tools by primates is varied and includes hunting (mammals, invertebrates,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7922109.stm Chimpanzee making and using a termite \"fishing rod\"]</ref> fish), collecting honey,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7949335.stm Chimpanzee using tool to break into beehive to get honey]</ref> processing food (nuts, fruits, vegetables and seeds), collecting water, weapons and shelter.\n\nTool making is much rarer, but has been documented in orangutans,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Van Schaik | first1 = C. | last2 = Fox | first2 = E. | last3 = Sitompul | first3 = A. | year = 1996 | title = Manufacture and use of tools in wild Sumatran orangutans | url = | journal = Naturwissenschaften | volume = 83 | issue = 4| pages = 186\u2013188 | doi=10.1007/s001140050271}}</ref> [[bonobo]]s and [[bearded capuchin]] monkeys.

In this research, K\u00f6hler observed the manner in which chimpanzees solve problems, such as that of retrieving bananas when positioned out of reach. He found that they stacked wooden crates to use as makeshift ladders in order to retrieve the food. If the bananas were placed on the ground outside of the cage, they used sticks to lengthen the reach of their arms.\n\nK\u00f6hler concluded that the chimps had not arrived at these methods through [[trial-and-error]] (which American psychologist [[Edward Thorndike]] had claimed to be the basis of all animal learning, through his [[law of effect]]), but rather that they had experienced an [[insight]] (sometimes known as the [[Eureka effect]] or an \"aha\" experience), in which, having realized the answer, they then proceeded to carry it out in a way that was, in K\u00f6hler's words, \"unwaveringly purposeful.\"\n\n===Asking questions and giving negative answers===\nIn the 1970s and the 1980s there had been suggestions that apes are unable to ask questions and to give negative answers.  According to numerous published studies, apes are able to answer human questions, and the vocabulary of the acculturated apes contains question words.<ref>Terrace, H. S. 1980. ''Nim''.

Ann and David Premacks designed a potentially promising methodology to teach apes to ask questions in the 1970s: \"In principle interrogation can be taught either by removing an element from a familiar situation in the animal's world or by removing the element from a language that maps the animal's world. It is probable that one can induce questions by purposefully removing key elements from a familiar situation. Suppose a chimpanzee received its daily ration of food at a specific time and place, and then one day the food was not there. A chimpanzee trained in the interrogative might inquire \"Where is my food?\" or, in Sarah's case, \"My food is?\" Sarah was never put in a situation that might induce such interrogation because for our purposes it was easier to teach Sarah to answer questions\".<ref>Premack, D., and A. J. Premack (1972) \"[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/terrace/w1001/readings/premack.pdf Teaching language to an ape].\"  ''[[Scientific American]]'', Vol. 227, No. 4.  W. H. Freeman and Company.</ref>\n\nA decade later Premacks wrote: \"Though she [Sarah] understood the question, she did not herself ask any questions\u2014unlike the child who asks interminable questions, such as What that? Who making noise? When Daddy come home? Me go Granny's house? Where puppy? Sarah never delayed the departure of her trainer after her lessons by asking where the trainer was going, when she was returning, or anything else\".<ref>Premack, D., and A. J. Premack (1983) ''The mind of an ape''. New York, London: W.W. Norton & Company. Pg. 29</ref>\n\nDespite all their achievements, Kanzi and Panbanisha also have not demonstrated the ability to ask questions so far. [[Joseph Jordania]] suggested that the ability to ask [[question]]s could be the crucial cognitive threshold between [[human]] and other [[ape]] mental abilities.<ref>J. Jordania, ''[[Who Asked the First Question?]]'', Logos, 2006</ref> Jordania suggested that asking questions is not a matter of the ability of using syntactic structures, that it is primarily a matter of cognitive ability.\n\n==''g'' factor of intelligence in primates==\n\n{{main|g Factor in Non-Humans}}\n\nThe general factor of intelligence, or [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor]], is a psychometric construct that summarizes the correlations observed between an individual\u2019s scores on various measures of [[cognitive abilities]].

While it is difficult to study human-like theory of mind and mental states in species which we do not yet describe as \"minded\" at all, and about whose potential mental states we have an incomplete understanding, researchers can focus on simpler components of more complex capabilities.\n\nFor example, many researchers focus on animals' understanding of intention, gaze, perspective, or knowledge (or rather, what another being has seen). Part of the difficulty in this line of research is that observed phenomena can often be explained as simple stimulus-response learning, as it is in the nature of any theorizers of mind to have to extrapolate internal mental states from observable behavior. Recently, most non-human theory of mind research has focused on monkeys and great apes, who are of most interest in the study of the evolution of human social cognition.\n\nThere has been some controversy over the interpretation of evidence purporting to show theory of mind ability\u2014or inability\u2014in animals. Two examples serve as demonstration: first, Povinelli et al. (1990)<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0735-7036.104.3.203 | last1 = Povinelli | first1 = D.J. | last2 = Nelson | first2 = K.E. | last3 = Boysen | first3 = S.T. | year = 1990 | title = Inferences about guessing and knowing by chimpanzees (''Pan troglodytes'') | url = https://animalstudiesrepository.org/acwp_asie/143| journal = Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 104 | issue = 3| pages = 203\u2013210 | pmid = 2225758 }}</ref> presented chimpanzees with the choice of two experimenters from which to request food: one who had seen where food was hidden, and one who, by virtue of one of a variety of mechanisms (having a bucket or bag over his head; a blindfold over his eyes; or being turned away from the baiting) does not know, and can only guess. They found that the animals failed in most cases to differentially request food from the \"knower.\" By contrast, Hare, Call, and Tomasello (2001)<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hare | first1 = B. | last2 = Call | first2 = J. | last3 = Tomasello | first3 = M. | year = 2001 | title = Do chimpanzees know what conspecifics know and do not know? | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 61 | issue = 1| pages = 139\u2013151 | pmid = 11170704 | doi = 10.1006/anbe.2000.1518 }}</ref> found that subordinate chimpanzees were able to use the knowledge state of dominant rival chimpanzees to determine which container of hidden food they approached.\n\nTomasello and like-minded colleagues who originally argued that great apes did not have theory of mind have since reversed their position. Povinelli and his colleagues, however, maintain that Tomasello's group has misinterpreted the results of their experiments. They point out that most evidence in support of great ape theory of mind involves naturalistic settings to which the apes may have already adapted through past learning. Their \"reinterpretation hypothesis\" explains away all current evidence supporting attribution of mental states to others in chimpanzees as merely evidence of risk-based learning; that is, the chimpanzees learn through experience that certain behaviors in other chimpanzees have a probability of leading to certain responses, without necessarily attributing knowledge or other intentional states to those other chimpanzees. They therefore propose testing theory of mind abilities in great apes in novel, and not naturalistic settings. Kristin Andrews takes the reinterpretation hypothesis one step further, arguing that it implies that even the well-known [[Sally\u2013Anne test|false-belief test]] used to test children's theory of mind is susceptible to being interpreted as a result of learning.\n\n===Language===\nThe modelling of human language in animals is known as [[animal language]] research. There have been many examples of modelling of human language through entrainment in primates. Most notably are [[Nim Chimpsky]], a chimpanzee; [[Koko (gorilla)|Koko]], a gorilla and [[Kanzi]], a bonobo.  Cognitive abilities are also demonstrated through the natural communication through vocalizations performed by non-human primates in the wild, with sophisticated systems of alarm calls and emotional vocalizations as well as adaptive behavioural responses to other animal's calls.\n\n==== Modeling of Human Language ====\nThe experiment called Project Nim was one of the first experiments that aimed to show nonhuman primates could be taught a human form of language. The experiment conducted on the chimpanzee dubbed \"[[Nim Chimpsky]]\" took place in the 1970's and was the idea of [[Herbert S. Terrace|Herbet S. Terrace]], to try to disprove the notion put forth by [[Noam Chomsky]], for whom the chimp was named, stating that language is an exclusively human ability. Nim was taught 125 signs in his life, and constantly impressed those he met with his ability to seemingly understand human nature and his mischievous behaviours. Similar experiments took place on two other primates, Koko and Kanzi. Koko was able to learn many signs, as well as some novel vocalizations to indicate emotional state.  Kanzi learned to model human language in an entirely different way. He was able to learn 348 geometrical symbols that represented different words, and to combine symbols in a type of proto-grammar to convey meaning and understanding. His keepers also claim that he understands the meaning of up to 3000 human words.  These examples of stunning cognition demonstrate the near-human ability of some trained primates to learn and retain the ability to communicate with humans.{{Citation needed|reason=There is controversy over whether observed primate sign language is a Clever Hans effect|date=April 2019}}\n\n==== Communication in the wild ====\nCommunication of animals in the wild has been studied extensively. Calls with specific intent, such as alarm calls or mating calls has been observed in many orders of animals, including primates.  A study done on East African [[Vervet monkey]]s showed that in the wild this species was able to produce at least 5 acoustically different alarm calls in response to danger, and that other monkeys responded differently according to which alarm had been sounded. This indicated a clear communication that there is a predator nearby and what kind of predator it is, eliciting a specific response.  A different species of monkeys, the wild Campbell's monkeys have also been known to produce a sequence of vocalization that require a specific order to elicit a specific behaviour in other monkeys. Changing the order of the sounds changes the resulting behaviour, or meaning, of the call. [[Diana monkey]]s were studied in a habituation-dishabituation experiment that demonstrated the ability to attend to the semantic content of calls rather than simply to acoustic nature.  Primates have also been observed responding to alarm calls of other species. [[Crested guineafowl|Crested Guinea fowl]], a ground-dwelling fowl, produce a single type of alarm call for all predators it detects. Diana monkeys have been observed to respond to the most likely reason for the call, typically a human or leopard, based on the situation and respond according to that. If they deem a leopard is the more likely predator in the vicinity they will produce their own leopard-specific alarm call but if they think it is a human, they will remain silent and hidden.\n\n===Tool use===\n{{further|Tool use by animals#Primates}}\n[[File:Gorrila tool use-Efi.jpg|thumb|Tool use by a gorilla]]\nThere are many reports of primates making or using tools, both in the wild or when captive. [[Chimpanzee]]s, [[gorilla]]s, [[orangutan]]s, [[capuchin monkeys]], [[baboons]], and [[mandrills]] have all been reported as using tools. The use of tools by primates is varied and includes hunting (mammals, invertebrates,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7922109.stm Chimpanzee making and using a termite \"fishing rod\"]</ref> fish), collecting honey,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7949335.stm Chimpanzee using tool to break into beehive to get honey]</ref> processing food (nuts, fruits, vegetables and seeds), collecting water, weapons and shelter.\n\nTool making is much rarer, but has been documented in orangutans,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Van Schaik | first1 = C. | last2 = Fox | first2 = E. | last3 = Sitompul | first3 = A. | year = 1996 | title = Manufacture and use of tools in wild Sumatran orangutans | url = | journal = Naturwissenschaften | volume = 83 | issue = 4| pages = 186\u2013188 | doi=10.1007/s001140050271}}</ref> [[bonobo]]s and [[bearded capuchin]] monkeys.

Some studies suggest primates could use tools due to environmental or motivational clues, rather than an understanding of [[folk physics]] or a capacity for future planning.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Emery | first1 = N. | last2 = Clayton | first2 = N. | year = 2009 | title = Tool use and physical cognition in birds and mammals | url = | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 27\u201333 | doi=10.1016/j.conb.2009.02.003}}</ref>\n\n===Problem solving===\nIn 1913, [[Wolfgang K\u00f6hler]] started writing a book on problem solving titled ''The Mentality of Apes'' (1917). In this research, K\u00f6hler observed the manner in which chimpanzees solve problems, such as that of retrieving bananas when positioned out of reach. He found that they stacked wooden crates to use as makeshift ladders in order to retrieve the food. If the bananas were placed on the ground outside of the cage, they used sticks to lengthen the reach of their arms.\n\nK\u00f6hler concluded that the chimps had not arrived at these methods through [[trial-and-error]] (which American psychologist [[Edward Thorndike]] had claimed to be the basis of all animal learning, through his [[law of effect]]), but rather that they had experienced an [[insight]] (sometimes known as the [[Eureka effect]] or an \"aha\" experience), in which, having realized the answer, they then proceeded to carry it out in a way that was, in K\u00f6hler's words, \"unwaveringly purposeful.\"\n\n===Asking questions and giving negative answers===\nIn the 1970s and the 1980s there had been suggestions that apes are unable to ask questions and to give negative answers.  According to numerous published studies, apes are able to answer human questions, and the vocabulary of the acculturated apes contains question words.<ref>Terrace, H. S. 1980. ''Nim''.

New York: Holt, Renchart and Winston.</ref> Despite these abilities, according to the published research literature, apes are not able to ask questions themselves, and in human-primate conversations questions are asked by the humans only. Ann and David Premacks designed a potentially promising methodology to teach apes to ask questions in the 1970s: \"In principle interrogation can be taught either by removing an element from a familiar situation in the animal's world or by removing the element from a language that maps the animal's world. It is probable that one can induce questions by purposefully removing key elements from a familiar situation. Suppose a chimpanzee received its daily ration of food at a specific time and place, and then one day the food was not there. A chimpanzee trained in the interrogative might inquire \"Where is my food?\" or, in Sarah's case, \"My food is?\" Sarah was never put in a situation that might induce such interrogation because for our purposes it was easier to teach Sarah to answer questions\".<ref>Premack, D., and A. J. Premack (1972) \"[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/terrace/w1001/readings/premack.pdf Teaching language to an ape].\"  ''[[Scientific American]]'', Vol. 227, No. 4.  W. H. Freeman and Company.</ref>\n\nA decade later Premacks wrote: \"Though she [Sarah] understood the question, she did not herself ask any questions\u2014unlike the child who asks interminable questions, such as What that? Who making noise? When Daddy come home? Me go Granny's house? Where puppy? Sarah never delayed the departure of her trainer after her lessons by asking where the trainer was going, when she was returning, or anything else\".<ref>Premack, D., and A. J. Premack (1983) ''The mind of an ape''. New York, London: W.W. Norton & Company. Pg. 29</ref>\n\nDespite all their achievements, Kanzi and Panbanisha also have not demonstrated the ability to ask questions so far. [[Joseph Jordania]] suggested that the ability to ask [[question]]s could be the crucial cognitive threshold between [[human]] and other [[ape]] mental abilities.<ref>J. Jordania, ''[[Who Asked the First Question?]]'', Logos, 2006</ref> Jordania suggested that asking questions is not a matter of the ability of using syntactic structures, that it is primarily a matter of cognitive ability.\n\n==''g'' factor of intelligence in primates==\n\n{{main|g Factor in Non-Humans}}\n\nThe general factor of intelligence, or [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor]], is a psychometric construct that summarizes the correlations observed between an individual\u2019s scores on various measures of [[cognitive abilities]]. First described in [[humans]], the ''g'' factor has since been identified in a number of non-human species.<ref name=\"Reader\">{{cite journal | last1 = Reader | first1 = S.

W. (2005). Clinical assessment of child and adolescent intelligence. Springer Science & Business Media.</ref>\n\nHowever, there is some debate as to the influence of ''g'' on all primates equally.

In North America it is called the '''goldenrod crab spider''' or '''flower (crab) spider''',<ref>Acorn, John and Sheldon, Ian. (2003). ''Bugs of Ontario'' Edmonton: Lone Pine Publishing.</ref> because it is commonly found hunting in [[Solidago|goldenrod]] sprays in the autumn. Young males in the early summer may be quite small and easily overlooked, but females can grow up to {{cvt|10|mm}} (excluding legs); males reach {{cvt|5|mm}} at most.\n\n==Description==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2019}}\nThese spiders may be yellow or white, depending on the flower in which they are hunting ([[active camouflage]]). Especially younger females, which may hunt on a variety of flowers such as [[Bellis perennis|daisies]] and [[sunflower]]s, may change color at will. However, the color changing process is not instant and can require up to 25 days to complete.<ref>https://usaspiders.com/misumena-vatia-flower-crab-spider/</ref> Older females require large amounts of relatively large prey to produce the best possible clutch of eggs. They are therefore, in North America, most commonly found in goldenrod (''[[Solidago]]'' sp.), a bright yellow flower which attracts large numbers of insects, especially in autumn. It is often very hard even for a searching human to recognize one of these spiders on a yellow flower. These spiders are sometimes called banana spiders because of their striking yellow color.\n\n==Reproduction==\nThe much smaller males scamper from flower to flower in search of females and are often seen missing one or more of their legs. This may be due either to near misses by predators such as birds or to fighting with other males.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nWhen a male finds a female, he climbs over her head over her [[opisthosoma]] onto her underside, where he inserts his [[pedipalps]] to inseminate her.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe young reach a size of about {{cvt|5|mm}} by autumn and spend the winter on the ground. They [[Ecdysis|molt]] for the last time in May of the next year.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nBecause ''Misumena vatia'' employs camouflaging, it is able to focus more energy on growth and reproduction rather than finding food and escaping from predators. As in many [[Thomisidae]] species, there is a positive correlation between female weight and egg clutch size, or fecundity.<ref>Fritz, Robert S., and Douglass H. Morse (1985). \"Reproductive success and foraging of the crab spider ''Misumena vatia''.\" ''Oecologia'' 65(2):194&ndash;200.</ref> Selection for larger female body size thus increases reproductive success.<ref>Head, Graham (1995). \"Selection on Fecundity and Variation in the Degree of Sexual Size Dimorphism Among Spider Species (Class Araneae).\" ''Evolution'' 49(4):776.</ref>\n\n==Color change==\nThese spiders change color by secreting a liquid yellow pigment into the outer cell layer of the body. On a white base, this pigment is transported into lower layers, so that inner glands, filled with white [[guanine]], become visible. The color similarity between the spider and the flower is well matched with a white flower, in particular the ''Chaerophyllum temulum'', compared to a yellow flower based on the spectral reflectance functions.<ref>Chittka, Lars (2001). \"Camouflage of predatory crab spiders on flowers and the colour perception of bees (Aranida: Thomisidae/Hymenoptera: Apidae).\" ''Entomologia Generalis'' 25(3):181-187.</ref> If the spider dwells longer on a white plant, the yellow pigment is often excreted.
