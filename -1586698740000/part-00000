The Congress had no power to [[tax levies|levy]] and [[tax collector|collect]] taxes, nor was there a tangible basis for securing funds from foreign investors or governments. The delegates resolved to issue paper money in the form of [[bills of credit]], promising [[fiat money|redemption]] in [[coin]] on faith in the revolutionary cause. On June 22, 1775\u2014only a few days after the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]]\u2014Congress issued $2&nbsp;million in bills; on July 25, 28 citizens of Philadelphia were employed by Congress to sign and number the currency.\n\nOn July 29, 1775, the [[Second Continental Congress]] assigned the responsibility for the administration of the revolutionary government's finances to joint Continental treasurers [[George Clymer]] and [[Michael Hillegas]]. Congress stipulated that each of the colonies contribute to the Continental government's funds. To ensure proper and efficient handling of the growing [[national debt]] in the face of weak economic and political ties between the colonies, the Congress, on February 17, 1776, designated a committee of five to superintend the Treasury, [[settlement (finance)|settle accounts]], and report periodically to the Congress. On April 1, a [[Treasury Office of Accounts]], consisting of an Auditor General and [[clerk]]s, was established to facilitate the settlement of claims and to keep the public accounts for the government of the United Colonies. With the signing of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] on July 4, 1776, the newborn republic as a [[sovereign nation]] was able to secure loans from abroad.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Banks and Politics in America: From the Revolution to the Civil War|last=Hammond|first=Bray|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1957|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=}}</ref>\n\nDespite the infusion of foreign and domestic loans, the united colonies were unable to establish a well-organized agency for financial administration. Michael Hillegas was first called Treasurer of the United States on May 14, 1777. The Treasury Office was reorganized three times between 1778 and 1781. The $241.5&nbsp;million in paper Continental bills [[devaluation|devalued]] rapidly. By May 1781, the dollar [[hyperinflation|collapsed]] at a rate of from 500 to 1000 to 1 against [[hard currency]]. Protests against the worthless money swept the colonies, giving rise to the expression \"[[early American currency#Continental currency|not worth a Continental]]\".\n\n[[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] was designated Superintendent of Finance in 1781 and restored stability to the nation's finances. Morris, a wealthy colonial [[merchant]], was nicknamed \"the Financier\" because of his reputation for procuring funds or goods on a moment's notice. His staff included a [[comptroller]], a [[treasurer]], a [[Register of the Treasury|register]], and [[auditor]]s, who managed the country's finances through 1784, when Morris resigned because of ill health. The treasury board, consisting of three commissioners, continued to oversee the finances of the confederation of former colonies until September 1789.\n\n===Hamilton and the Establishment of the Department of the Treasury===\n[[Image:Seal of the United States Department of the Treasury (1789-1968).png|thumb|Original seal, dating from before 1968]]\nThe First Congress of the United States was called to convene in New York on March 4, 1789, marking the beginning of government under the Constitution. On September 2, 1789, Congress created a permanent institution for the management of government finances:<blockquote>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That there shall be a Department of Treasury, in which shall be the following officers, namely: a Secretary of the Treasury, to be deemed head of the department; a Comptroller, an Auditor, a Treasurer, a Register, and an [[United States Assistant Secretary of the Treasury|Assistant to the Secretary of the Treasury]], which assistant shall be appointed by the said Secretary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://legisworks.org/sal/1/stats/STATUTE-1-Pg65.pdf|title=Chapter 12, 1 Statue. 65|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref></blockquote>[[Alexander Hamilton]] took the oath of office as the first [[Secretary of the Treasury]] on September 11, 1789. Hamilton had served as George Washington's ''[[aide-de-camp]]'' during the Revolution and was of great importance in the [[United States Constitution#1788 ratification|ratification]] of the Constitution. Because of his [[business acumen|financial and managerial acumen]], Hamilton was a logical choice for solving the problem of the new nation's heavy [[war debt]]. Hamilton's first official act was to submit a report to Congress in which he laid the foundation for the nation's financial health.\n\nTo the surprise of many legislators, he insisted upon [[Debt Assumption|federal assumption]] and dollar-for-dollar repayment of the country's $75&nbsp;million debt in order to revitalize the [[public credit]]: \"[T]he debt of the United States was the price of liberty. The faith of America has been repeatedly pledged for it, and with solemnities that give peculiar force to the obligation.\"<ref name=\"syrett1962vol6\">{{cite book|last1=Syrett|first1=Harold C.

He submitted bills to Congress in 1780 that authorized the design of department seals, including the seal for the Board of Treasury. While it is it not certain that Hopkinson designed the seal, it is very similar to others he's done.<ref>Friedberg, A.L. (2017). Paper money of the US 21st Edition. Coin & Currency Institute.

Effective January 24, 2003, the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (ATF), which had been a bureau of the Department since 1972, was extensively reorganized under the provisions of the [[Homeland Security Act|Homeland Security Act of 2002]]. The [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] functions of ATF, including the regulation of legitimate traffic in [[firearms]] and [[explosives]], were transferred to the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (BATFE). The regulatory and tax collection functions of ATF related to legitimate traffic in alcohol and tobacco remained with the Treasury at its new [[Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau]] (TTB).\n\nEffective March 1, 2003, the [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Center]], the [[United States Customs Service]], and the [[United States Secret Service]] were transferred to the newly created [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\")]].\n\n==Responsibilities==\n[[File:Treasury department official 1907.jpg|thumb|Treasury Department official, surrounded by packages of newly minted currency, counting and wrapping dollar bills.

The Congress had no power to [[tax levies|levy]] and [[tax collector|collect]] taxes, nor was there a tangible basis for securing funds from foreign investors or governments. The delegates resolved to issue paper money in the form of [[bills of credit]], promising [[fiat money|redemption]] in [[coin]] on faith in the revolutionary cause. On June 22, 1775\u2014only a few days after the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]]\u2014Congress issued $2 million in bills; on July 25, 28 citizens of Philadelphia were employed by Congress to sign and number the currency.\n\nOn July 29, 1775, the [[Second Continental Congress]] assigned the responsibility for the administration of the revolutionary government's finances to joint Continental treasurers [[George Clymer]] and [[Michael Hillegas]]. Congress stipulated that each of the colonies contribute to the Continental government's funds. To ensure proper and efficient handling of the growing [[national debt]] in the face of weak economic and political ties between the colonies, the Congress, on February 17, 1776, designated a committee of five to superintend the Treasury, [[settlement (finance)|settle accounts]], and report periodically to the Congress. On April 1, a [[Treasury Office of Accounts]], consisting of an Auditor General and [[clerk]]s, was established to facilitate the settlement of claims and to keep the public accounts for the government of the United Colonies. With the signing of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] on July 4, 1776, the newborn republic as a [[sovereign nation]] was able to secure loans from abroad.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Banks and Politics in America: From the Revolution to the Civil War|last=Hammond|first=Bray|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1957|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=}}</ref>\n\nDespite the infusion of foreign and domestic loans, the united colonies were unable to establish a well-organized agency for financial administration. Michael Hillegas was first called Treasurer of the United States on May 14, 1777. The Treasury Office was reorganized three times between 1778 and 1781. The $241.5 million in paper Continental bills [[devaluation|devalued]] rapidly. By May 1781, the dollar [[hyperinflation|collapsed]] at a rate of from 500 to 1000 to 1 against [[hard currency]]. Protests against the worthless money swept the colonies, giving rise to the expression \"[[early American currency#Continental currency|not worth a Continental]]\".\n\n[[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] was designated Superintendent of Finance in 1781 and restored stability to the nation's finances. Morris, a wealthy colonial [[merchant]], was nicknamed \"the Financier\" because of his reputation for procuring funds or goods on a moment's notice. His staff included a [[comptroller]], a [[treasurer]], a [[Register of the Treasury|register]], and [[auditor]]s, who managed the country's finances through 1784, when Morris resigned because of ill health. The treasury board, consisting of three commissioners, continued to oversee the finances of the confederation of former colonies until September 1789.\n\n===Hamilton and the Establishment of the Department of the Treasury===\n[[Image:Seal of the United States Department of the Treasury (1789-1968).png|thumb|Original seal, dating from before 1968]]\nThe First Congress of the United States was called to convene in New York on March 4, 1789, marking the beginning of government under the Constitution. On September 2, 1789, Congress created a permanent institution for the management of government finances:<blockquote>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That there shall be a Department of Treasury, in which shall be the following officers, namely: a Secretary of the Treasury, to be deemed head of the department; a Comptroller, an Auditor, a Treasurer, a Register, and an [[United States Assistant Secretary of the Treasury|Assistant to the Secretary of the Treasury]], which assistant shall be appointed by the said Secretary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://legisworks.org/sal/1/stats/STATUTE-1-Pg65.pdf|title=Chapter 12, 1 Statue. 65|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref></blockquote>[[Alexander Hamilton]] took the oath of office as the first [[Secretary of the Treasury]] on September 11, 1789. Hamilton had served as George Washington's ''[[aide-de-camp]]'' during the Revolution and was of great importance in the [[United States Constitution#1788 ratification|ratification]] of the Constitution. Because of his [[business acumen|financial and managerial acumen]], Hamilton was a logical choice for solving the problem of the new nation's heavy [[war debt]]. Hamilton's first official act was to submit a report to Congress in which he laid the foundation for the nation's financial health.\n\nTo the surprise of many legislators, he insisted upon [[Debt Assumption|federal assumption]] and dollar-for-dollar repayment of the country's $75 million debt in order to revitalize the [[public credit]]: \"[T]he debt of the United States was the price of liberty. The faith of America has been repeatedly pledged for it, and with solemnities that give peculiar force to the obligation.\"<ref name=\"syrett1962vol6\">{{cite book|last1=Syrett|first1=Harold C.

He submitted bills to Congress in 1780 that authorized the design of department seals, including the seal for the Board of Treasury. While it is it not certain that Hopkinson designed the seal, it is very similar to others he's done.<ref>Friedberg, A.L. (2017). Paper money of the US 21st Edition. Coin & Currency Institute.

Effective January 24, 2003, the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (ATF), which had been a bureau of the Department since 1972, was extensively reorganized under the provisions of the [[Homeland Security Act|Homeland Security Act of 2002]]. The [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] functions of ATF, including the regulation of legitimate traffic in [[firearms]] and [[explosives]], were transferred to the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (BATFE).
