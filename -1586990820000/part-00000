'''Choral music''', in turn, is the music written specifically for such an ensemble to perform. Choirs may perform music from the [[classical music]] repertoire, which spans from the [[Medieval music|medieval era]] to the present, or [[popular music]] repertoire. Most choirs are led by a [[conducting|conductor]], who leads the performances with arm and face gestures.\n\nA body of singers who perform together as a group is called a choir or chorus. The former term is very often applied to groups affiliated with a church (whether or not they occupy the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]]) and the second to groups that perform in theatres or concert halls, but this distinction is far from rigid. Choirs may sing without instrumental accompaniment, with the accompaniment of a [[piano]] or [[pipe organ]], with a small ensemble (e.g., [[harpsichord]], [[cello]] and [[double bass]] for a [[Baroque music|Baroque]] piece), or with a full [[orchestra]] of 70 to 100 musicians.\n\nThe term ''choir'' has the secondary definition of a subset of an ensemble; thus one speaks of the \"woodwind choir\" of an orchestra, or different \"choirs\" of voices or instruments in a [[Venetian polychoral style|polychoral]] composition. In typical 18th- to 21st-century [[oratorio]]s and [[mass (music)|mass]]es, chorus or choir is usually understood to imply more than one singer per part, in contrast to the quartet of soloists also featured in these works.\n\n==Structure==\nChoirs are often led by a [[Conducting|conductor]] or choirmaster. Most often choirs consist of four sections intended to sing in four-part harmony, but there is no limit to the number of possible parts as long as there is a singer available to sing the part: [[Thomas Tallis]] wrote a 40-part [[motet]] entitled ''[[Spem in alium]]'', for eight choirs of five parts each; [[Krzysztof Penderecki]]'s ''Stabat Mater'' is for three choirs of 16 voices each, a total of 48 parts. Other than four, the most common number of parts are three, five, six, and eight.\n\nChoirs can sing with or without instrumental accompaniment. Singing without accompaniment is called [[a cappella]] singing (although the [[American Choral Directors Association]]<ref>[http://acda.org/page.asp?page=choralreviewinformationcj See \"Choral Reviews Format\" on ACDA.org]</ref> discourages this usage in favor of \"unaccompanied\" since a cappella denotes singing \"as in the chapel\" and much-unaccompanied music today is [[secular]]). Accompanying instruments vary widely, from only one instrument (a piano or pipe organ) to a full [[orchestra]] of 70 to 100 musicians; for rehearsals, a [[piano]] or [[Organ (music)|organ]] accompaniment is often used, even if different instrumentation is planned for performance, or if the choir is rehearsing unaccompanied music.\n\nMany choirs perform in one or many locations such as a church, opera house, or school hall. In some cases, choirs join up to become one \"mass\" choir that performs for a special concert. In this case, they provide a series of songs or musical works to celebrate and provide entertainment to others.\n\n===Role of conductor===\n[[Conducting]] is the art of directing a [[music]]al performance, such as a choral [[concert]], by way of visible gestures with the hands, arms, face and head. The primary duties of the conductor or choirmaster are to unify [[musician|performers]], set the [[tempo]], execute clear preparations and beats ([[meter (music)|meter]]), and to listen critically and shape the sound of the ensemble.<ref>{{cite book|quote=Conducting|title=Oxford Concise Dictionary of Music|author1=Michael Kennedy|authorlink1=Michael Kennedy (music critic)|author2=Joyce Bourne Kennedy|edition=Fifth|publisher=Oxford University Press, Oxford|date=2007|isbn=9780199203833|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/conciseoxforddic2007kenn}}</ref>\n\nThe conductor or choral director typically stands on a raised platform and he or she may or may not use a [[Baton (conducting)|baton]]; using a baton gives the conductor's gestures greater visibility, but many choral conductors prefer conducting with their hands for greater expressiveness, particularly when working with a smaller ensemble. In the 2010s, most conductors do not play an instrument when conducting, although in earlier periods of [[classical music]] history, leading an ensemble while playing an instrument was common. In [[Baroque music]] from the 1600s to the 1750s, conductors performing in the 2010s may lead an ensemble while playing a [[harpsichord]] or the violin (see [[Concertmaster]]). Conducting while playing a [[piano]] may also be done with [[musical theatre]] [[pit orchestra]]s. Communication is typically non-verbal during a performance (this is strictly the case in [[art music]], but in jazz [[big band]]s or large pop ensembles, there may be occasional spoken instructions). However, in [[rehearsal]]s, the conductor will often give verbal instructions to the ensemble, since they generally also serve as an artistic director who crafts the ensemble's interpretation of the music.\n\nConductors act as guides to the choirs they conduct. They choose the works to be performed and study their [[sheet music|scores]], to which they may make certain adjustments (e.g., regarding tempo, repetitions of sections, assignment of vocal solos and so on), work out their interpretation, and relay their vision to the singers. Choral conductors may also have to conduct instrumental ensembles such as [[orchestra]]s if the choir is singing a piece for choir and orchestra. They may also attend to organizational matters, such as scheduling rehearsals,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.liveabout.com/what-is-a-conductor-2456662|title=The Conductor of an Ensemble|author=Espie Estrella|website=about.com|accessdate=26 September 2019|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415012250/http://musiced.about.com/od/musiccareer1/p/theconductor.htm |archivedate=April 15, 2013 }}</ref> planning a concert season, hearing [[audition]]s, and promoting their ensemble in the media.\n\n== In worship services ==\n\n===Accompaniment===\n[[File: Egyptian Alexandria Jews. Choir of Rabbin Moshe Cohen in Samuel Menashe synagogue. Alexandria.jpg|thumb|Egyptian Alexandria Jewish choir of Rabbin Moshe Cohen at Samuel Menashe synagogue, [[Alexandria]], Egypt]]\nMost [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christian churches, some American Protestant groups, and traditional Jewish [[synagogue]]s do not accompany their songs with musical instruments. In churches of the [[Latin liturgical rites|Western Rite]] the accompanying instrument is usually the organ, although in [[colonial America]], the [[Moravian Church]] used groups of strings and winds. Many churches that use a contemporary worship format use a small amplified band to accompany the singing and Roman Catholic Churches may use, at their discretion, additional orchestral accompaniment.\n\n===Liturgical function===\n\nIn addition to leading of singing in which the [[Wiktionary: congregation|congregation]] participates, such as [[hymn]]s and service music, some church choirs sing full liturgies, including [[proper (liturgy)|propers]] (introit, gradual, communion antiphons appropriate for the different times of the [[liturgical year]]). Chief among these are the [[Anglican church music|Anglican]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] churches; far more common however is the performance of [[anthem]]s or [[motet]]s at designated times in the service.\n\n== Types==\n\n* Mixed choir (with male and female voices). This is perhaps the most common type, usually consisting of [[soprano]], [[alto]], [[tenor]], and [[bass (voice type)|bass]] voices, often abbreviated as [[SATB]]. Often one or more voices are divided into two, e.g., SSAATTBB, where each voice is divided into two parts, and SATB SATB, where the choir is divided into two semi-independent four-part choirs. Occasionally [[baritone]] voice is also used (e.g., SATBarB), often sung by the higher basses. In smaller choirs with fewer men, SAB, or Soprano, Alto, and Baritone arrangements allow the few men to share the role of both the tenor and bass in a single part.\n* Male choirs with the same SATB voicing as mixed choirs, but with boys singing the upper part (often called [[Choirboy|trebles]] or [[boy soprano]]s) and men singing alto (in [[falsetto]]), also known as [[countertenor]]s. This format is typical of the British cathedral choir (e.g. [[Peterborough Cathedral]], [[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]], [[Westminster Abbey]]).\n* [[Women's choir]], a choir of adult women, high voices only, usually consisting of soprano and alto voices, two parts in each, often abbreviated as [[SSAA (choir)|SSAA]], or as soprano I, soprano II, and alto, abbreviated SSA.\n* [[Men's chorus]] ([[M\u00e4nnerchor]]), a choir of adult men, low voices only, usually consisting of two tenors, baritone, and bass, often abbreviated as TTBB (or ATBB if the upper part sings [[falsetto]] in alto range). ATBB may be seen in some [[barbershop quartet]] music.\n* Children's choir, often two-part SA or three-part SSA, sometimes more voices. This includes [[boy choir]]s. Boy choirs typically sing SSA or SSAA, sometimes including a cambiata/tenor part for boys/young men whose voices are changing and a baritone part for boys/youg men whose voices have changed.\n* [[Boys' choir]], a choir of boys\n* [[Girls' choir]], a choir of girls, high voices only\n* Indian music choral group, takes the elements of western music in Indian music. [[Madras Youth Choir]] is a pioneer in this.\nChoirs are also categorized by the institutions in which they operate:\n[[File:School choir.jpg|thumb|[[Lambrook| Lambrook School]] choir in the 1960s, a typical school choir]]\n* [[Church (building)|Church]] (including cathedral) choirs\n* [[Chorale]] (Kantorei), dedicated to mostly sacred Christian music\n* Collegiate and university choir\n* Community choir (of children or adults)\n* Professional choir, either independent (e.g. [[An\u00fana]], [[The Sixteen]]) or state-supported (e.g., [[BBC Singers]], [[National Chamber Choir of Ireland]], [[Canadian Chamber Choir]], [[Swedish Radio Choir]], [[Nederlands Kamerkoor]])\n* School choirs\n* [[Sign singing|Signing choir]] using [[sign language]] rather than voices\n* Integrated signing and singing choir, using both sign language and voices and led by both a signductor and a musical director\n* Cambiata choirs, often the same SATB, but with girls singing soprano and alto, along with trebles and cambiatas and boy altos\nSome choirs are categorized by the type of music they perform, such as\n* [[Bach Choir (disambiguation)|Bach choir]]\n* [[Barbershop music]] group\n* [[Gospel music|Gospel choir]]\n* [[Show choir]], in which the members sing and dance, often in performances somewhat like [[Musical theater|musical]]s\n* Symphonic choir\n* [[Vocal jazz]] choir\n\n=== In schools ===\nIn the United States, middle schools and high schools often offer choir as a class or activity for students. Some choirs participate in competitions. One kind of choir popular in high schools is [[show choir]]. Middle school and high school is an important time, as it is when students' voices are changing. Although girls experience [[voice change]], it is much more drastic in boys. A lot of literature in music education has been focused on how male voice change works and how to help adolescent male singers.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Ryan A.|date=2014-10-01|title=The Impacts of the Voice Change, Grade Level, and Experience on the Singing Self-Efficacy of Emerging Adolescent Males|journal=[[Journal of Research in Music Education]]|volume=62|issue=3|pages=277\u2013290|doi=10.1177/0022429414544748|issn=0022-4294}}</ref> Research done by John Cooksey categorizes male voice change into five stages, and most middle school boys are in the early stages of change.<ref name=\":3\" /> The vocal range of both male and female students may be limited while their voice is changing, and choir teachers must be able to adapt, which can be a challenge to teaching this age range.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Russell L.|date=September 2007|title=Junior High/Middle School Choirs|url=|journal=Choral Journal|volume=48|issue=3|pages=41\u201348}}</ref>\n\nNationally, male students are enrolled in choir at much lower numbers than their female students.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Elpus|first=Kenneth|date=2015-01-02|title=National estimates of male and female enrolment in American high school choirs, bands and orchestras|journal=Music Education Research|volume=17|issue=1|pages=88\u2013102|doi=10.1080/14613808.2014.972923|issn=1461-3808}}</ref> The music education field has had a longtime interest in the \"missing males\" in music programs.<ref name=\":0\" /> Speculation as to why there aren't as many boys in choir, and possible solutions vary widely.

It is the conductor's decision on where the different voice types are placed. In symphonic choirs it is common (though by no means universal) to order the choir behind the orchestra from highest to lowest voices from left to right, corresponding to the typical string layout. In ''a cappella'' or piano-accompanied situations it is not unusual for the men to be in the back and the women in front; some conductors prefer to place the basses behind the sopranos, arguing that the outer voices need to tune to each other.\n\nMore experienced choirs may sing with the voices all mixed. Sometimes singers of the same voice are grouped in pairs or threes. Proponents of this method argue that it makes it easier for each individual singer to hear and tune to the other parts, but it requires more independence from each singer. Opponents argue that this method loses the spatial separation of individual voice lines, an otherwise valuable feature for the audience, and that it eliminates sectional resonance, which lessens the effective volume of the chorus. For music with double (or multiple) choirs, usually the members of each choir are together, sometimes significantly separated, especially in performances of 16th-century music (such as works in the [[Venetian polychoral style]]). Some composers actually specify that choirs should be separated, such as in [[Benjamin Britten]]'s ''[[War Requiem]]''. Some composers use separated choirs to create \"antiphonal\" effects, in which one choir seems to \"answer\" the other choir in a musical dialogue.\n\nConsideration is also given to the spacing of the singers. Studies have found that not only the actual formation, but the amount of space (both laterally and circumambiently) affects the perception of sound by choristers and auditors.<ref>Daugherty, J. \"Spacing, Formation, and Choral Sound: Preferences and Perceptions of Auditors and Choristers.\" ''[[Journal of Research in Music Education]]''. Vol. 47, Num. 3. 1999.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n===Antiquity===\n{{Main|Music of ancient Greece}}\n{{See also|Ancient music}}\n[[File:NAMA Bacchantes.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Relief, now in [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens|Athens]], showing [[Dionysus]] with actresses (possibly from ''[[The Bacchae]]'') carrying masks and drums]]\n\nThe origins of choral music are found in [[traditional music]], as singing in big groups is extremely widely spread in traditional cultures (both singing in one part, or in [[unison]], like in Ancient Greece, as well as singing in parts, or in [[harmony]], like in contemporary European choral music).<ref>{{cite book|first = Joseph|last = Jordania|authorlink =Joseph Jordania|date= 2011|title =Why do People Sing? Music in Human Evolution|publisher= Logos|isbn = 978-9941401862}}</ref>\n\nThe oldest unambiguously choral repertory that survives is that of [[ancient Greece]], of which the 2nd century BC [[Delphic hymns]] and the 2nd century AD. hymns of [[Mesomedes]] are the most complete. The original [[Greek chorus]] sang its part in [[Greek drama]], and fragments of works by [[Euripides]] (''[[Orestes (play)|Orestes]]'') and [[Sophocles]] (''[[Ajax (play)|Ajax]]'') are known from [[papyri]]. The [[Seikilos epitaph]] (2c BC) is a complete song (although possibly for solo voice). One of the latest examples, ''[[Oxyrhynchus hymn]]'' (3c) is also of interest as the earliest [[Christian music]].\n\nOf the [[Music of ancient Rome|Roman]] drama's music [[Flaccus (composer)|a single line]] of [[Terence]] surfaced in the 18c. However, musicologist Thomas J. Mathiesen comments that it is no longer believed to be authentic.<ref>Warren Anderson and Thomas J. Mathiesen. \"Terence\", ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', ed. [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (musicologist)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan, 2001), xxv, 296.</ref>\n\n===Medieval music===\n{{Main|Medieval music}}\n[[File:54-aspetti di vita quotidiana, canto in chiesa,Taccuino Sani.jpg|thumb|Church singing, ''[[Tacuinum Sanitatis]] Casanatensis'' (14th century)]]\n\nThe earliest notated music of western Europe is [[Gregorian chant]], along with a few other types of chant which were later subsumed (or sometimes suppressed) by the Catholic Church. This tradition of unison choir singing lasted from sometime between the times of [[St. Ambrose]] (4th century) and [[Gregory the Great]] (6th century) up to the present. During the later Middle Ages, a new type of singing involving multiple melodic parts, called [[organum]], became predominant for certain functions, but initially this [[polyphony]] was only sung by soloists. Further developments of this technique included [[Clausula (music)|clausula]]e, [[conductus]] and the [[motet]] (most notably the [[isorhythm]]ic motet), which, unlike the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] motet, describes a composition with different texts sung simultaneously in different voices. The first evidence of polyphony with more than one singer per part comes in the [[Old Hall Manuscript]] (1420, though containing music from the late 14th century), in which there are apparent'' divisi'', one part dividing into two simultaneously sounding notes.\n\n===Renaissance music===\n{{Main|Renaissance music}}\n\n[[File:Cantoria luca della robbia22.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Luca della Robbia]]'s ''Cantoria'', ''[[Museo dell'Opera del Duomo (Florence)|Museo dell'Opera del Duomo]]'', Florence]]\n\nDuring the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]], sacred choral music was the principal type of formally notated music in Western Europe. Throughout the era, hundreds of [[mass (music)|mass]]es and [[motet]]s (as well as various other forms) were composed for [[a cappella]] choir, though there is some dispute over the role of instruments during certain periods and in certain areas. Some of the better-known composers of this time include [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Josquin des Prez]], [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[John Dunstaple|John Dunstable]], and [[William Byrd]]; the glories of Renaissance [[polyphony]] were choral, sung by choirs of great skill and distinction all over Europe. Choral music from this period continues to be popular with<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/08331 |title=Dunstaple [Dunstable, Dunstapell, Dumstable, Donstaple, etc.], John|last=Bent|first=Margaret |date=1 January 2001|website=Grove Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|access-date=}}</ref> many choirs throughout the world today.\n\nThe [[madrigal]], a [[partsong]] conceived for amateurs to sing in a [[Chamber choir|chamber]] setting, originated at this period. Although madrigals were initially dramatic settings of unrequited-love poetry or mythological stories in Italy, they were imported into England and merged with the more dancelike [[balletto]], celebrating carefree songs of the seasons, or eating and drinking. To most English speakers, the word ''madrigal'' now refers to the latter, rather than to madrigals proper, which refers to a poetic form of lines consisting of seven and eleven syllables each.\n\nThe interaction of sung voices in Renaissance polyphony influenced Western music for centuries. Composers are routinely trained in the \"Palestrina style\" to this day, especially as codified by the 18c music theorist [[Johann Joseph Fux]]. Composers of the early 20th century also wrote in Renaissance-inspired styles. [[Herbert Howells]] wrote a ''Mass in the Dorian mode'' entirely in strict Renaissance style, and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]'s [[Mass in G minor (Vaughan Williams)|Mass in G minor]] is an extension of this style. [[Anton Webern]] wrote his dissertation on the ''[[Choralis Constantinus]]'' of [[Heinrich Isaac]] and the contrapuntal techniques of his [[serial music]] may be informed by this study.\n\n===Baroque music===\nThe [[Baroque music|Baroque period]] in music is associated with the development around 1600 of the ''[[figured bass]]'' and the [[basso continuo]] system. The figured bass part was performed by the basso continuo group, which at minimum included a chord-playing instrument (e.g., [[pipe organ]], [[harpsichord]], [[lute]]) and a bass instrument (e.g., [[violone]]). Baroque vocal music explored dramatic implications in the realm of solo vocal music such as the [[monody|monodies]] of the [[Florentine Camerata]] and the development of early [[opera]]. This innovation was in fact an extension of established practice of accompanying choral music at the organ, either from a skeletal reduced score (from which otherwise lost pieces can sometimes be reconstructed) or from a ''basso seguente'', a part on a single staff containing the lowest sounding part (the bass part).\n\nA new genre was the vocal [[concertato]], combining voices and instruments; its origins may be sought in the [[Venetian polychoral style|polychoral]] music of the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian school]].\n[[Claudio Monteverdi]] (1567\u20131643) brought it to perfection with his [[Vespers]] and his Eighth Book of Madrigals, which call for great virtuosity on the part of singers and instruments alike. (His Fifth Book includes a ''basso continuo'' \"for harpsichord or lute\".) His pupil [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]] (1585\u20131672) (who had earlier studied with [[Giovanni Gabrieli]]) introduced the new style to Germany. Alongside the new music of the ''[[seconda pratica]]'', contrapuntal motets in the ''[[Prima pratica|stile antico]]'' or old style continued to be written well into the 19th century. Choirs at this time were usually quite small and that singers could be [[vocal weight|classified]] as suited to church or to chamber singing. Monteverdi, himself a singer, is documented as taking part in performances of his Magnificat with one voice per part.<ref>Richard Wistreich: [http://em.oxfordjournals.org/content/XXII/1/7.citation \"'La voce e grata assai, ma..' Monteverdi on Singing\"] in ''[[Early Music (journal)|Early Music]]'', February 1994</ref>\n\nIndependent instrumental accompaniment opened up new possibilities for choral music. [[Anthem|Verse anthem]]s alternated accompanied solos with choral sections; the best-known composers of this genre were [[Orlando Gibbons]] and [[Henry Purcell]]. [[Grands motet]]s (such as those of [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]] and [[Michel-Richard Delalande|Delalande]]) separated these sections into separate movements. [[Oratorio]], (of which [[Giacomo Carissimi]] was a pioneer), extended this concept into concert-length works, usually based on Biblical or moral stories.\n\nA pinnacle of baroque choral music, (particularly oratorio), may be found in [[George Frideric Handel]]'s works, notably ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' and ''[[Israel in Egypt]]''. While the modern chorus of hundreds had to await the growth of Choral Societies and his centennial commemoration concert, we find Handel already using a variety of performing forces, from the soloists of the ''[[Chandos Anthems]]'' to larger groups (whose proportions are still quite different from modern orchestra choruses):\n\n{{quote|Yesterday [Oct. 6] there was a Rehearsal of the [[Coronation Anthems (Handel)|Coronation Anthem]] in [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster-Abby]], set to musick by the famous Mr Hendall: there being 40 voices, and about 160 [[violin family|violins]], [[Trumpet]]s, [[oboe|Hautboys]], [[timpani|Kettle-Drums]] and Bass' proportionable..!|''Norwich Gazette'', October 14, 1727}}\n\nLutheran composers wrote instrumentally accompanied [[cantata]]s, often based on [[chorale]] [[hymn tune|tunes]]. Substantial late 17th-century sacred choral works in the emerging German tradition exist (the cantatas of [[Dietrich Buxtehude]] being a prime example), though the Lutheran church cantata did not assume its more codified, recognizable form until the early 18th century. [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] (based in Frankfurt) wrote over 1000 cantatas, many of which were engraved and published (e.g. his ''Harmonische Gottesdienst'') and [[Christoph Graupner]] (based in Darmstadt) over 1400. The cantatas of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (1685\u20131750) are perhaps the most recognizable (and often-performed) contribution to this repertoire: his obituary mentions five complete cycles of [[Bach cantata|his cantata]]s, of which three, comprising some 200 works, are known today, in addition to [[motet]]s. Bach himself rarely used the term cantata. Motet refers to his church music without orchestra accompaniment, but instruments playing [[colla parte]] with the voices. His works with accompaniment consists of his [[Passions (Bach)|Passions]], [[Missa (Bach)|Mass]]es, the [[Magnificat (Bach)|Magnificat]] and the cantatas.\n\n[[File:Soloquartet and strings.jpg|thumb|right|Baroque cantata with one voice per part]]\nA point of hot controversy today is the so-called \"Rifkin hypothesis,\" which re-examines the famous \"''Entwurff''\" Bach's 1730 memo to the [[Leipzig]] City Council (''A Short but Most Necessary Draft for a Well Appointed Church Music'') calling for at least 12 singers. In light of Bach's responsibility to provide music to four churches and be able to perform double choir compositions with a substitute for each voice, [[Joshua Rifkin]] concludes that Bach's music was normally written with [[OVPP|one voice per part]] in mind. A few sets of original performing parts include ''ripieni'' who reinforce rather than slavishly double the vocal quartet.\n\n{{listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 44 hallelujah.ogg|title=Hallelujah Chorus|description=The Hallelujah Chorus, from [[George Frideric Handel]]'s [[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]], is one of the most famous choruses of all time}}\n\n===Classical and Romantic music===\nComposers of the late 18th century became fascinated with the new possibilities of the symphony and other instrumental music, and generally neglected choral music. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s mostly sacred choral works stand out as some of his greatest (such as the \"Great\" Mass in C minor and [[Requiem (Mozart)|Requiem]] in D minor, the latter of which is highly regarded). [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] became more interested in choral music near the end of his life following his visits to England in the 1790s, when he heard various Handel oratorios performed by large forces; he wrote a series of masses beginning in 1797 and his two great oratorios ''[[The Creation (Haydn)|The Creation]]'' and ''[[The Seasons (Haydn)|The Seasons]]''. [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] wrote only two masses, both intended for liturgical use, although his ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'' is probably suitable only for the grandest ceremonies due to its length, difficulty and large-scale scoring. He also pioneered the use of chorus as part of symphonic texture with his [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] and [[Choral Fantasy (Beethoven)|Choral Fantasia]].\n\nIn the 19th century, sacred music escaped from the church and leaped onto the concert stage, with large sacred works unsuitable for church use, such as [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]'s ''[[Te Deum (Berlioz)|Te Deum]]'' and [[Requiem (Berlioz)|Requiem]], and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]'s ''[[Ein deutsches Requiem]]''. [[Gioacchino Rossini|Rossini]]'s ''Stabat mater'', [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]]'s masses, and [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s [[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]] also exploited the grandeur offered by instrumental accompaniment. Oratorios also continued to be written, clearly influenced by Handel's models. Berlioz's ''[[L'enfance du Christ]]'' and [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn's]] ''[[Elijah (oratorio)|Elijah]]'' and ''[[St. Paul (oratorio)|St Paul]]'' are in the category. Schubert, Mendelssohn, and Brahms also wrote secular cantatas, the best known of which are Brahms's ''[[Schicksalslied]]'' and ''[[N\u00e4nie]]''.\n\nA few composers developed a cappella music, especially [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]], whose masses and motets startlingly juxtapose Renaissance counterpoint with chromatic harmony. Mendelssohn and Brahms also wrote significant a cappella motets. The amateur chorus (beginning chiefly as a social outlet) began to receive serious consideration as a compositional venue for the part-songs of Schubert, [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], Mendelssohn, Brahms, and others. These 'singing clubs' were often for women or men separately, and the music was typically in four-part (hence the name \"[[part-song]]\") and either a cappella or with simple instrumentation. At the same time, the [[Cecilian movement]] attempted a restoration of the pure Renaissance style in Catholic churches.\n{{listen|type=music|filename=Johannes Brahms - Op.45 Ein Deutsches Requiem - (04) Wie lieblich sind deine Wohnungen.ogg|title=\"Wie lieblich sind deine Wohnungen\"|description=(How lovely is thy dwelling place) from ''[[Ein deutsches Requiem]]'' by [[Johannes Brahms]]}}\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\n{{Unreferenced section|date= September 2016}}\n[[File:03262012Sinf\u00f3nica coro armada nal197.jpg|thumb|upright= 1.15| Chorus of the Symphonic Orchestra and Chorus of the [[Secretariat of the Navy (Mexico) |Mexican Navy]] performing at the [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Mexico City]]]]\nAs in other genres of music, choral music underwent a period of experimentation and development during the [[20th-century classical music |20th century]]. While few well-known composers focused primarily on choral music, most significant composers of the early century produced some fine examples that have entered the repertoire.\n\nThe early [[Modernism (music)| modernist]] composers, such as [[Richard Strauss]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]] and [[Max Reger]], contributed to the genre. [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]'s [[Mass in G minor (Vaughan Williams)|Mass in G minor]] harks back to the Renaissance style while exhibiting the vibrancy of new harmonic languages. Vaughan Williams also arranged English and Scottish folk songs. [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s ''Friede auf Erden'' is a tonal kaleidoscope, whose tonal centers shift constantly (his harmonically innovative ''[[Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht]]'' for strings dates from the same period). [[List of Ukrainian composers| Ukrainian composer]] [[Mykola Leontovych]] explored new ways of harmonizing and arranging [[Ukrainian folk songs]], producing masterpieces such as ''Dudaryk'' and [[Shchedryk (song)| ''Shchedryk'']], the latter of which featured a four-note [[ostinato]] theme and became a popular [[Christmas carol]] known as [[Carol of the Bells]] after [[Peter J. Wilhousky]] translated it.\n\nThe advent of [[atonality]] and other non-traditional harmonic systems and techniques in the 20th century also affected choral music. Serial music is represented by choral works by [[Arnold Schoenberg]], including the anthem ''Dreimal Tausend Jahre'', while the composer's signature use of ''[[Sprechstimme]]'' is evident in his setting of [[Psalm 130]] ''De Profundis''. [[Paul Hindemith]]'s distinctive modal language is represented both by his a cappella Mass and by his ''Six Chansons'' (to texts by [[Rainer Maria Rilke | Rilke]]), while a more contrapuntally dissonant style comes through in his secular requiem, ''When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd''. [[Olivier Messiaen]] also demonstrates dissonant counterpoint in his ''Cinq Rechants'', which tell the Tristan and Isolde story. [[Charles Ives]]' psalm settings exemplify the composer's incomparably radical harmonic language. Tone clusters and aleatory elements play a prominent role in the choral music of [[Krzysztof Penderecki]], who wrote the St. Luke Passio, and [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti]], who wrote both a Requiem and a separate ''Lux Aeterna''. [[Milton Babbitt]] incorporated integral serialism into works for children's chorus, while [[Daniel Pinkham]] wrote for choir and electronic tape. [[Meredith Monk]]'s ''Panda Chant'' and ''Astronaut Anthem'' explore overtones in an unconventional text setting. Though difficult and rarely performed by amateurs, pieces that demonstrate such unfamiliar idioms have found their way into the repertories of the finest semi-professional and professional choirs around the world.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nMore accessible styles of choral music include that of [[Benjamin Britten]], including his ''[[War Requiem]]'', ''Five Flower Songs'', and ''[[Rejoice in the Lamb]]''. [[Francis Poulenc]]'s ''Motets pour le temps de no\u00ebl'', ''Gloria'', and ''Mass in G'' are often performed. A primitivist approach is exemplified by [[Carl Orff]]'s widely performed [[Carmina Burana (Orff)| ''Carmina Burana'']]. In the United States, [[Aaron Copland]], [[Samuel Barber]], and [[Randall Thompson]] wrote signature American pieces. In Eastern Europe, [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] and [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]] wrote a small amount of music for choirs. [[Frank Martin (composer) |Frank Martin]]'s Mass for double choir combines modality and allusion to Medieval and Renaissance forms with a distinctly modern harmonic language and has become the composer's most-performed work.\n\nThe so-called [[Holy minimalism |holy minimalists]] are represented by [[Arvo P\u00e4rt]], whose ''Johannespassion'' and Magnificat have received regular performances; [[John Tavener]] (''Song for Athene'') and [[Henryk G\u00f3recki]] (''{{Lang|la|Totus Tuus}}'') share this label. American minimalism and post minimalism are represented by [[Steve Reich]]'s ''[[The Desert Music]]'', choral excerpts from [[Philip Glass]]'s ''[[Einstein on the Beach]]'' and [[John Adams (composer) |John Adams]]' ''[[The Death of Klinghoffer]]'', and [[David Lang (composer)|David Lang]]'s Pulitzer Prize-winning'' Little Match Girl Passion''.\n[[File:XXV laulupidu (3).jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A choir of more than 30,000 participants performing to an audience of 80,000 in the 25th [[Estonian Song Festival]]]]\n\nAt the turn of the 21st century, choral music has received a resurgence of interest partly due to a renewed interest in accessible choral idioms.{{Citation needed|reason= Broad statement with limited scope needs to be researched.|date= February 2011}} Multi-cultural influences appear in [[Osvaldo Golijov]]'s St. Mark Passion, which melds the Bach-style passion form with Latin American street-music, and [[Chen Yi (composer) |Chen Yi]]'s Chinese Myths Cantata melds atonal idioms with traditional Chinese melodies played on traditional Chinese instruments. Some composers began to earn their reputation based foremost on their choral output, including the highly popular [[John Rutter]] and [[Eric Whitacre]]. The large-scale dramatic works of [[Karl Jenkins]] seem to hark back to the theatricality of Orff, and the music of [[James MacMillan (composer) |James MacMillan]] continues the tradition of boundary-pushing choral works from the United Kingdom begun by Britten, [[William Walton| Walton]], and [[Kenneth Leighton| Leighton]]. Meanwhile, composers such as [[John Williams]] (known primarily for film scores) and prominent concert orchestral composers such as [[Augusta Read Thomas]], [[Sofia Gubaidulina]], [[Aaron Jay Kernis]], and [[Thomas Ad\u00e8s]] also contribute vital additions to the choral repertoire.\n\nA number of traditions originating outside of classical concert-music have enriched the choral repertoire as well as providing new outlets to composers:\n\n* At the end of the 19th century, male voice choirs became popular with the [[coal miner]]s of [[South Wales]], and numerous choirs were established including the [[Treorchy Male Choir]], [[Morriston Orpheus Choir]] and Cor Meibion [[Pontypridd]] [[male voice choir | male-voice choir]]s. Although the mining communities which gave rise to these choirs largely died out in the 1970s and 1980s with the decline of the Welsh coal-industry, many of these choirs continue, and are seen{{by whom?|date=September 2019}} as a traditional part of [[Welsh culture]] and perform worldwide. Not all of the choirs were based on coal &ndash; some started in the rugby clubs, such as [[Cardiff Arms Park Male Choir]] and Morriston Rugby Choir, while others such as [[Pontarddulais Male Choir]] formed out of youth choirs.\n*Black [[Spiritual (music)| Spiritual]]s entered the concert repertoire with the tours of the [[Fisk University |Fisk College]] [[Fisk Jubilee Singers| Jubilee Singers]], and arrangements of such spirituals have become part of the standard choral repertoire.{{cn|date=September 2019}} Notable composers and arrangers of choral music in this tradition include [[William L. Dawson (composer) |William Dawson]], [[Jester Hairston]] and [[Moses Hogan]].\n* During the mid-20th century, [[barbershop music| barbershop]] quartets began experimenting with combining larger ensembles together into choruses which sing barbershop music in 4 parts, often with staging, choreography and costumes. The international barbershop chorus contest started in 1953 and continues to this day.\n* Contemporary choirs, such as [[Rock Choir]] and London Contemporary Voices in the United Kingdom, have become popular since the beginning of the 21st century.{{cn|date=September 2019}} They usually perform rock, pop, soul and [[Motown]] songs in close-part vocal harmony, often incorporating dance moves.\n\nApart from their roles in liturgy and entertainment, choirs and choruses may also have social-service functions,<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| last1                 = Hilliard\n| first1                = R.

'''Choral music''', in turn, is the music written specifically for such an ensemble to perform. Choirs may perform music from the [[classical music]] repertoire, which spans from the [[Medieval music|medieval era]] to the present, or [[popular music]] repertoire. Most choirs are led by a [[conducting|conductor]], who leads the performances with arm and face gestures.\n\nA body of singers who perform together as a group is called a choir or chorus. The former term is very often applied to groups affiliated with a church (whether or not they actually occupy the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]]) and the second to groups that perform in theatres or concert halls, but this distinction is far from rigid. Choirs may sing without instrumental accompaniment, with the accompaniment of a [[piano]] or [[pipe organ]], with a small ensemble (e.g., [[harpsichord]], [[cello]] and [[double bass]] for a [[Baroque music|Baroque]] piece), or with a full [[orchestra]] of 70 to 100 musicians.\n\nThe term ''choir'' has the secondary definition of a subset of an ensemble; thus one speaks of the \"woodwind choir\" of an orchestra, or different \"choirs\" of voices or instruments in a [[Venetian polychoral style|polychoral]] composition. In typical 18th- to 21st-century [[oratorio]]s and [[mass (music)|mass]]es, chorus or choir is usually understood to imply more than one singer per part, in contrast to the quartet of soloists also featured in these works.\n\n==Structure==\nChoirs are often led by a [[Conducting|conductor]] or choirmaster. Most often choirs consist of four sections intended to sing in four part harmony, but there is no limit to the number of possible parts as long as there is a singer available to sing the part: [[Thomas Tallis]] wrote a 40-part [[motet]] entitled ''[[Spem in alium]]'', for eight choirs of five parts each; [[Krzysztof Penderecki]]'s ''Stabat Mater'' is for three choirs of 16 voices each, a total of 48 parts. Other than four, the most common number of parts are three, five, six, and eight.\n\nChoirs can sing with or without instrumental accompaniment. Singing without accompaniment is called [[a cappella]] singing (although the [[American Choral Directors Association]]<ref>[http://acda.org/page.asp?page=choralreviewinformationcj See \"Choral Reviews Format\" on ACDA.org]</ref> discourages this usage in favor of \"unaccompanied\", since a cappella denotes singing \"as in the chapel\" and much unaccompanied music today is [[secular]]). Accompanying instruments vary widely, from only one instrument (a piano or pipe organ) to a full [[orchestra]] of 70 to 100 musicians; for rehearsals a [[piano]] or [[Organ (music)|organ]] accompaniment is often used, even if a different instrumentation is planned for performance, or if the choir is rehearsing unaccompanied music.\n\nMany choirs perform in one or many locations such as a church, opera house, or school hall. In some cases choirs join up to become one \"mass\" choir that performs for a special concert. In this case they provide a series of songs or musical works to celebrate and provide entertainment to others.\n\n===Role of conductor===\n[[Conducting]] is the art of directing a [[music]]al performance, such as a choral [[concert]], by way of visible gestures with the hands, arms, face and head. The primary duties of the conductor or choirmaster are to unify [[musician|performers]], set the [[tempo]], execute clear preparations and beats ([[meter (music)|meter]]), and to listen critically and shape the sound of the ensemble.<ref>{{cite book|quote=Conducting|title=Oxford Concise Dictionary of Music|author1=Michael Kennedy|authorlink1=Michael Kennedy (music critic)|author2=Joyce Bourne Kennedy|edition=Fifth|publisher=Oxford University Press, Oxford|date=2007|isbn=9780199203833|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/conciseoxforddic2007kenn}}</ref>\n\nThe conductor or choral director typically stands on a raised platform and he or she may or may not use a [[Baton (conducting)|baton]]; using a baton gives the conductor's gestures greater visibility, but many choral conductors prefer conducting with their hands for greater expressiveness, particularly when working with a smaller ensemble. In the 2010s, most conductors do not play an instrument when conducting, although in earlier periods of [[classical music]] history, leading an ensemble while playing an instrument was common. In [[Baroque music]] from the 1600s to the 1750s, conductors performing in the 2010s may lead an ensemble while playing a [[harpsichord]] or the violin (see [[Concertmaster]]). Conducting while playing a [[piano]] may also be done with [[musical theatre]] [[pit orchestra]]s. Communication is typically non-verbal during a performance (this is strictly the case in [[art music]], but in jazz [[big band]]s or large pop ensembles, there may be occasional spoken instructions). However, in [[rehearsal]]s, the conductor will often give verbal instructions to the ensemble, since they generally also serve as an artistic director who crafts the ensemble's interpretation of the music.\n\nConductors act as guides to the choirs they conduct. They choose the works to be performed and study their [[sheet music|scores]], to which they may make certain adjustments (e.g., regarding tempo, repetitions of sections, assignment of vocal solos and so on), work out their interpretation, and relay their vision to the singers. Choral conductors may also have to conduct instrumental ensembles such as [[orchestra]]s if the choir is singing a piece for choir and orchestra. They may also attend to organizational matters, such as scheduling rehearsals,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.liveabout.com/what-is-a-conductor-2456662|title=The Conductor of an Ensemble|author=Espie Estrella|website=about.com|accessdate=26 September 2019|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415012250/http://musiced.about.com/od/musiccareer1/p/theconductor.htm |archivedate=April 15, 2013 }}</ref> planning a concert season, hearing [[audition]]s, and promoting their ensemble in the media.\n\n== In worship services ==\n\n===Accompaniment===\n[[File:Egyptian Alexandria Jews. Choir of Rabbin Moshe Cohen in Samuel Menashe synagogue. Alexandria.jpg|thumb|Egyptian Alexandria Jewish choir of Rabbin Moshe Cohen at Samuel Menashe synagogue, [[Alexandria]], Egypt]]\nMost [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christian churches, some American Protestant groups, and traditional Jewish [[synagogue]]s do not accompany their songs with musical instruments. In churches of the [[Latin liturgical rites|Western Rite]] the accompanying instrument is usually the organ, although in [[colonial America]], the [[Moravian Church]] used groups of strings and winds. Many churches which use a contemporary worship format use a small amplified band to accompany the singing, and Roman Catholic Churches may use, at their discretion, additional orchestral accompaniment.\n\n===Liturgical function===\n\nIn addition to leading of singing in which the [[Wiktionary:congregation|congregation]] participates, such as [[hymn]]s and service music, some church choirs sing full liturgies, including [[proper (liturgy)|propers]] (introit, gradual, communion antiphons appropriate for the different times of the [[liturgical year]]). Chief among these are the [[Anglican church music|Anglican]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] churches; far more common however is the performance of [[anthem]]s or [[motet]]s at designated times in the service.\n\n== Types==\n\n* Mixed choir (with male and female voices). This is perhaps the most common type, usually consisting of [[soprano]], [[alto]], [[tenor]], and [[bass (voice type)|bass]] voices, often abbreviated as [[SATB]]. Often one or more voices is divided into two, e.g., SSAATTBB, where each voice is divided into two parts, and SATBSATB, where the choir is divided into two semi-independent four-part choirs. Occasionally [[baritone]] voice is also used (e.g., SATBarB), often sung by the higher basses. In smaller choirs with fewer men, SAB, or Soprano, Alto, and Baritone arrangements allow the few men to share the role of both the tenor and bass in a single part.\n* Male choirs with the same SATB voicing as mixed choirs, but with boys singing the upper part (often called [[Choirboy|trebles]] or [[boy soprano]]s) and men singing alto (in [[falsetto]]), also known as [[countertenor]]s. This format is typical of the British cathedral choir (e.g. [[Peterborough Cathedral]], [[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]], [[Westminster Abbey]]).\n* [[Women's choir]], a choir of adult women, high voices only, usually consisting of soprano and alto voices, two parts in each, often abbreviated as [[SSAA (choir)|SSAA]], or as soprano I, soprano II, and alto, abbreviated SSA.\n* [[Men's chorus]] ([[M\u00e4nnerchor]]), a choir of adult men, low voices only, usually consisting of two tenors, baritone, and bass, often abbreviated as TTBB (or ATBB if the upper part sings [[falsetto]] in alto range). ATBB may be seen in some [[barbershop quartet]] music.\n* Children's choir, often two-part SA or three-part SSA, sometimes more voices. This includes [[boy choir]]s. Boy choirs typically sing SSA or SSAA, sometimes including a cambiata/tenor part for boys/young men whose voices are changing and a baritone part for boys/youg men whose voices have changed.\n* [[Boys' choir]], a choir of boys\n* [[Girls' choir]], a choir of girls, high voices only\n* Indian music choral group, takes the elements of western music in Indian music. [[Madras Youth Choir]] is a pioneer in this.\nChoirs are also categorized by the institutions in which they operate:\n[[File:School choir.jpg|thumb|[[Lambrook| Lambrook School]] choir in the 1960s, a typical school choir]]\n* [[Church (building)|Church]] (including cathedral) choirs\n* [[Chorale]] (Kantorei), dedicated to mostly sacred Christian music\n* Collegiate and university choir\n* Community choir (of children or adults)\n* Professional choir, either independent (e.g. [[An\u00fana]], [[The Sixteen]]) or state-supported (e.g., [[BBC Singers]], [[National Chamber Choir of Ireland]], [[Canadian Chamber Choir]], [[Swedish Radio Choir]], [[Nederlands Kamerkoor]])\n* School choirs\n* [[Sign singing|Signing choir]] using [[sign language]] rather than voices\n* Integrated signing and singing choir, using both sign language and voices and led by both a signductor and a musical director\n* Cambiata choirs, often the same SATB, but with girls singing soprano and alto, along with trebles and cambiatas and boy altos\nSome choirs are categorized by the type of music they perform, such as\n* [[Bach Choir (disambiguation)|Bach choir]]\n* [[Barbershop music]] group\n* [[Gospel music|Gospel choir]]\n* [[Show choir]], in which the members sing and dance, often in performances somewhat like [[Musical theater|musical]]s\n* Symphonic choir\n* [[Vocal jazz]] choir\n\n=== In schools ===\nIn the United States, middle schools and high schools often offer choir as a class or activity for students. Some choirs participate in competitions. One kind of choir popular in high schools is [[show choir]]. Middle school and high school is an important time, as it is when students' voices are changing. Although girls experience [[voice change]], it is much more drastic in boys. A lot of literature in music education has been focused on how male voice change works and how to help adolescent male singers.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Ryan A.|date=2014-10-01|title=The Impacts of the Voice Change, Grade Level, and Experience on the Singing Self-Efficacy of Emerging Adolescent Males|journal=[[Journal of Research in Music Education]]|volume=62|issue=3|pages=277\u2013290|doi=10.1177/0022429414544748|issn=0022-4294}}</ref> Research done by John Cooksey categorizes male voice change into five stages, and most middle school boys are in the early stages of change.<ref name=\":3\" /> The vocal range of both male and female students may be limited while their voice is changing, and choir teachers must be able to adapt, which can be a challenge to teaching this age range.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Russell L.|date=September 2007|title=Junior High/Middle School Choirs|url=|journal=Choral Journal|volume=48|issue=3|pages=41\u201348}}</ref>\n\nNationally, male students are enrolled in choir at much lower numbers than their female students.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Elpus|first=Kenneth|date=2015-01-02|title=National estimates of male and female enrolment in American high school choirs, bands and orchestras|journal=Music Education Research|volume=17|issue=1|pages=88\u2013102|doi=10.1080/14613808.2014.972923|issn=1461-3808}}</ref> The music education field has had a longtime interest in the \"missing males\" in music programs.<ref name=\":0\" /> Speculation as to why there aren't as many boys in choir, and possible solutions vary widely.

It is the conductor's decision on where the different voice types are placed. In symphonic choirs it is common (though by no means universal) to order the choir behind the orchestra from highest to lowest voices from left to right, corresponding to the typical string layout. In ''a cappella'' or piano-accompanied situations it is not unusual for the men to be in the back and the women in front; some conductors prefer to place the basses behind the sopranos, arguing that the outer voices need to tune to each other.\n\nMore experienced choirs may sing with the voices all mixed. Sometimes singers of the same voice are grouped in pairs or threes. Proponents of this method argue that it makes it easier for each individual singer to hear and tune to the other parts, but it requires more independence from each singer. Opponents argue that this method loses the spatial separation of individual voice lines, an otherwise valuable feature for the audience, and that it eliminates sectional resonance, which lessens the effective volume of the chorus. For music with double (or multiple) choirs, usually the members of each choir are together, sometimes significantly separated, especially in performances of 16th-century music (such as works in the [[Venetian polychoral style]]). Some composers actually specify that choirs should be separated, such as in [[Benjamin Britten]]'s ''[[War Requiem]]''. Some composers use separated choirs to create \"antiphonal\" effects, in which one choir seems to \"answer\" the other choir in a musical dialogue.\n\nConsideration is also given to the spacing of the singers. Studies have found that not only the actual formation, but the amount of space (both laterally and circumambiently) affects the perception of sound by choristers and auditors.<ref>Daugherty, J. \"Spacing, Formation, and Choral Sound: Preferences and Perceptions of Auditors and Choristers.\" ''[[Journal of Research in Music Education]]''.

The original [[Greek chorus]] sang its part in [[Greek drama]], and fragments of works by [[Euripides]] (''[[Orestes (play)|Orestes]]'') and [[Sophocles]] (''[[Ajax (play)|Ajax]]'') are known from [[papyri]]. The [[Seikilos epitaph]] (2c BC) is a complete song (although possibly for solo voice). One of the latest examples, ''[[Oxyrhynchus hymn]]'' (3c) is also of interest as the earliest [[Christian music]].\n\nOf the [[Music of ancient Rome|Roman]] drama's music [[Flaccus (composer)|a single line]] of [[Terence]] surfaced in the 18c. However, musicologist Thomas J. Mathiesen comments that it is no longer believed to be authentic.<ref>Warren Anderson and Thomas J.

This tradition of unison choir singing lasted from sometime between the times of [[St. Ambrose]] (4th century) and [[Gregory the Great]] (6th century) up to the present. During the later Middle Ages, a new type of singing involving multiple melodic parts, called [[organum]], became predominant for certain functions, but initially this [[polyphony]] was only sung by soloists. Further developments of this technique included [[Clausula (music)|clausula]]e, [[conductus]] and the [[motet]] (most notably the [[isorhythm]]ic motet), which, unlike the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] motet, describes a composition with different texts sung simultaneously in different voices. The first evidence of polyphony with more than one singer per part comes in the [[Old Hall Manuscript]] (1420, though containing music from the late 14th century), in which there are apparent'' divisi'', one part dividing into two simultaneously sounding notes.\n\n===Renaissance music===\n{{Main|Renaissance music}}\n\n[[File:Cantoria luca della robbia22.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Luca della Robbia]]'s ''Cantoria'', ''[[Museo dell'Opera del Duomo (Florence)|Museo dell'Opera del Duomo]]'', Florence]]\n\nDuring the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]], sacred choral music was the principal type of formally notated music in Western Europe. Throughout the era, hundreds of [[mass (music)|mass]]es and [[motet]]s (as well as various other forms) were composed for [[a cappella]] choir, though there is some dispute over the role of instruments during certain periods and in certain areas. Some of the better-known composers of this time include [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Josquin des Prez]], [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[John Dunstaple|John Dunstable]], and [[William Byrd]]; the glories of Renaissance [[polyphony]] were choral, sung by choirs of great skill and distinction all over Europe. Choral music from this period continues to be popular with<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/08331 |title=Dunstaple [Dunstable, Dunstapell, Dumstable, Donstaple, etc.], John|last=Bent|first=Margaret |date=1 January 2001|website=Grove Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|access-date=}}</ref> many choirs throughout the world today.\n\nThe [[madrigal]], a [[partsong]] conceived for amateurs to sing in a [[Chamber choir|chamber]] setting, originated at this period. Although madrigals were initially dramatic settings of unrequited-love poetry or mythological stories in Italy, they were imported into England and merged with the more dancelike [[balletto]], celebrating carefree songs of the seasons, or eating and drinking. To most English speakers, the word ''madrigal'' now refers to the latter, rather than to madrigals proper, which refers to a poetic form of lines consisting of seven and eleven syllables each.\n\nThe interaction of sung voices in Renaissance polyphony influenced Western music for centuries. Composers are routinely trained in the \"Palestrina style\" to this day, especially as codified by the 18c music theorist [[Johann Joseph Fux]]. Composers of the early 20th century also wrote in Renaissance-inspired styles. [[Herbert Howells]] wrote a ''Mass in the Dorian mode'' entirely in strict Renaissance style, and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]'s [[Mass in G minor (Vaughan Williams)|Mass in G minor]] is an extension of this style. [[Anton Webern]] wrote his dissertation on the ''[[Choralis Constantinus]]'' of [[Heinrich Isaac]] and the contrapuntal techniques of his [[serial music]] may be informed by this study.\n\n===Baroque music===\nThe [[Baroque music|Baroque period]] in music is associated with the development around 1600 of the ''[[figured bass]]'' and the [[basso continuo]] system. The figured bass part was performed by the basso continuo group, which at minimum included a chord-playing instrument (e.g., [[pipe organ]], [[harpsichord]], [[lute]]) and a bass instrument (e.g., [[violone]]). Baroque vocal music explored dramatic implications in the realm of solo vocal music such as the [[monody|monodies]] of the [[Florentine Camerata]] and the development of early [[opera]]. This innovation was in fact an extension of established practice of accompanying choral music at the organ, either from a skeletal reduced score (from which otherwise lost pieces can sometimes be reconstructed) or from a ''basso seguente'', a part on a single staff containing the lowest sounding part (the bass part).\n\nA new genre was the vocal [[concertato]], combining voices and instruments; its origins may be sought in the [[Venetian polychoral style|polychoral]] music of the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian school]].\n[[Claudio Monteverdi]] (1567\u20131643) brought it to perfection with his [[Vespers]] and his Eighth Book of Madrigals, which call for great virtuosity on the part of singers and instruments alike. (His Fifth Book includes a ''basso continuo'' \"for harpsichord or lute\".) His pupil [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]] (1585\u20131672) (who had earlier studied with [[Giovanni Gabrieli]]) introduced the new style to Germany. Alongside the new music of the ''[[seconda pratica]]'', contrapuntal motets in the ''[[Prima pratica|stile antico]]'' or old style continued to be written well into the 19th century. Choirs at this time were usually quite small and that singers could be [[vocal weight|classified]] as suited to church or to chamber singing. Monteverdi, himself a singer, is documented as taking part in performances of his Magnificat with one voice per part.<ref>Richard Wistreich: [http://em.oxfordjournals.org/content/XXII/1/7.citation \"'La voce e grata assai, ma..' Monteverdi on Singing\"] in ''[[Early Music (journal)|Early Music]]'', February 1994</ref>\n\nIndependent instrumental accompaniment opened up new possibilities for choral music. [[Anthem|Verse anthem]]s alternated accompanied solos with choral sections; the best-known composers of this genre were [[Orlando Gibbons]] and [[Henry Purcell]]. [[Grands motet]]s (such as those of [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]] and [[Michel-Richard Delalande|Delalande]]) separated these sections into separate movements. [[Oratorio]], (of which [[Giacomo Carissimi]] was a pioneer), extended this concept into concert-length works, usually based on Biblical or moral stories.\n\nA pinnacle of baroque choral music, (particularly oratorio), may be found in [[George Frideric Handel]]'s works, notably ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' and ''[[Israel in Egypt]]''. While the modern chorus of hundreds had to await the growth of Choral Societies and his centennial commemoration concert, we find Handel already using a variety of performing forces, from the soloists of the ''[[Chandos Anthems]]'' to larger groups (whose proportions are still quite different from modern orchestra choruses):\n\n{{quote|Yesterday [Oct. 6] there was a Rehearsal of the [[Coronation Anthems (Handel)|Coronation Anthem]] in [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster-Abby]], set to musick by the famous Mr Hendall: there being 40 voices, and about 160 [[violin family|violins]], [[Trumpet]]s, [[oboe|Hautboys]], [[timpani|Kettle-Drums]] and Bass' proportionable..!|''Norwich Gazette'', October 14, 1727}}\n\nLutheran composers wrote instrumentally accompanied [[cantata]]s, often based on [[chorale]] [[hymn tune|tunes]]. Substantial late 17th-century sacred choral works in the emerging German tradition exist (the cantatas of [[Dietrich Buxtehude]] being a prime example), though the Lutheran church cantata did not assume its more codified, recognizable form until the early 18th century. [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] (based in Frankfurt) wrote over 1000 cantatas, many of which were engraved and published (e.g. his ''Harmonische Gottesdienst'') and [[Christoph Graupner]] (based in Darmstadt) over 1400. The cantatas of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (1685\u20131750) are perhaps the most recognizable (and often-performed) contribution to this repertoire: his obituary mentions five complete cycles of [[Bach cantata|his cantata]]s, of which three, comprising some 200 works, are known today, in addition to [[motet]]s. Bach himself rarely used the term cantata. Motet refers to his church music without orchestra accompaniment, but instruments playing [[colla parte]] with the voices. His works with accompaniment consists of his [[Passions (Bach)|Passions]], [[Missa (Bach)|Mass]]es, the [[Magnificat (Bach)|Magnificat]] and the cantatas.\n\n[[File:Soloquartet and strings.jpg|thumb|right|Baroque cantata with one voice per part]]\nA point of hot controversy today is the so-called \"Rifkin hypothesis,\" which re-examines the famous \"''Entwurff''\" Bach's 1730 memo to the [[Leipzig]] City Council (''A Short but Most Necessary Draft for a Well Appointed Church Music'') calling for at least 12 singers. In light of Bach's responsibility to provide music to four churches and be able to perform double choir compositions with a substitute for each voice, [[Joshua Rifkin]] concludes that Bach's music was normally written with [[OVPP|one voice per part]] in mind. A few sets of original performing parts include ''ripieni'' who reinforce rather than slavishly double the vocal quartet.\n\n{{listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 44 hallelujah.ogg|title=Hallelujah Chorus|description=The Hallelujah Chorus, from [[George Frideric Handel]]'s [[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]], is one of the most famous choruses of all time}}\n\n===Classical and Romantic music===\nComposers of the late 18th century became fascinated with the new possibilities of the symphony and other instrumental music, and generally neglected choral music. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s mostly sacred choral works stand out as some of his greatest (such as the \"Great\" Mass in C minor and [[Requiem (Mozart)|Requiem]] in D minor, the latter of which is highly regarded). [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] became more interested in choral music near the end of his life following his visits to England in the 1790s, when he heard various Handel oratorios performed by large forces; he wrote a series of masses beginning in 1797 and his two great oratorios ''[[The Creation (Haydn)|The Creation]]'' and ''[[The Seasons (Haydn)|The Seasons]]''. [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] wrote only two masses, both intended for liturgical use, although his ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'' is probably suitable only for the grandest ceremonies due to its length, difficulty and large-scale scoring. He also pioneered the use of chorus as part of symphonic texture with his [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] and [[Choral Fantasy (Beethoven)|Choral Fantasia]].\n\nIn the 19th century, sacred music escaped from the church and leaped onto the concert stage, with large sacred works unsuitable for church use, such as [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]'s ''[[Te Deum (Berlioz)|Te Deum]]'' and [[Requiem (Berlioz)|Requiem]], and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]'s ''[[Ein deutsches Requiem]]''. [[Gioacchino Rossini|Rossini]]'s ''Stabat mater'', [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]]'s masses, and [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s [[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]] also exploited the grandeur offered by instrumental accompaniment. Oratorios also continued to be written, clearly influenced by Handel's models. Berlioz's ''[[L'enfance du Christ]]'' and [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn's]] ''[[Elijah (oratorio)|Elijah]]'' and ''[[St. Paul (oratorio)|St Paul]]'' are in the category. Schubert, Mendelssohn, and Brahms also wrote secular cantatas, the best known of which are Brahms's ''[[Schicksalslied]]'' and ''[[N\u00e4nie]]''.\n\nA few composers developed a cappella music, especially [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]], whose masses and motets startlingly juxtapose Renaissance counterpoint with chromatic harmony. Mendelssohn and Brahms also wrote significant a cappella motets. The amateur chorus (beginning chiefly as a social outlet) began to receive serious consideration as a compositional venue for the part-songs of Schubert, [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], Mendelssohn, Brahms, and others. These 'singing clubs' were often for women or men separately, and the music was typically in four-part (hence the name \"[[part-song]]\") and either a cappella or with simple instrumentation. At the same time, the [[Cecilian movement]] attempted a restoration of the pure Renaissance style in Catholic churches.\n{{listen|type=music|filename=Johannes Brahms - Op.45 Ein Deutsches Requiem - (04) Wie lieblich sind deine Wohnungen.ogg|title=\"Wie lieblich sind deine Wohnungen\"|description=(How lovely is thy dwelling place) from ''[[Ein deutsches Requiem]]'' by [[Johannes Brahms]]}}\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\n{{Unreferenced section|date= September 2016}}\n[[File:03262012Sinf\u00f3nica coro armada nal197.jpg|thumb|upright= 1.15| Chorus of the Symphonic Orchestra and Chorus of the [[Secretariat of the Navy (Mexico) |Mexican Navy]] performing at the [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Mexico City]]]]\nAs in other genres of music, choral music underwent a period of experimentation and development during the [[20th-century classical music |20th century]]. While few well-known composers focused primarily on choral music, most significant composers of the early century produced some fine examples that have entered the repertoire.\n\nThe early [[Modernism (music)| modernist]] composers, such as [[Richard Strauss]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]] and [[Max Reger]], contributed to the genre. [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]'s [[Mass in G minor (Vaughan Williams)|Mass in G minor]] harks back to the Renaissance style while exhibiting the vibrancy of new harmonic languages. Vaughan Williams also arranged English and Scottish folk songs. [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s ''Friede auf Erden'' is a tonal kaleidoscope, whose tonal centers shift constantly (his harmonically innovative ''[[Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht]]'' for strings dates from the same period). [[List of Ukrainian composers| Ukrainian composer]] [[Mykola Leontovych]] explored new ways of harmonizing and arranging [[Ukrainian folk songs]], producing masterpieces such as ''Dudaryk'' and [[Shchedryk (song)| ''Shchedryk'']], the latter of which featured a four-note [[ostinato]] theme and became a popular [[Christmas carol]] known as [[Carol of the Bells]] after [[Peter J. Wilhousky]] translated it.\n\nThe advent of [[atonality]] and other non-traditional harmonic systems and techniques in the 20th century also affected choral music. Serial music is represented by choral works by [[Arnold Schoenberg]], including the anthem ''Dreimal Tausend Jahre'', while the composer's signature use of ''[[Sprechstimme]]'' is evident in his setting of [[Psalm 130]] ''De Profundis''. [[Paul Hindemith]]'s distinctive modal language is represented both by his a cappella Mass and by his ''Six Chansons'' (to texts by [[Rainer Maria Rilke | Rilke]]), while a more contrapuntally dissonant style comes through in his secular requiem, ''When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd''. [[Olivier Messiaen]] also demonstrates dissonant counterpoint in his ''Cinq Rechants'', which tell the Tristan and Isolde story. [[Charles Ives]]' psalm settings exemplify the composer's incomparably radical harmonic language. Tone clusters and aleatory elements play a prominent role in the choral music of [[Krzysztof Penderecki]], who wrote the St. Luke Passio, and [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti]], who wrote both a Requiem and a separate ''Lux Aeterna''. [[Milton Babbitt]] incorporated integral serialism into works for children's chorus, while [[Daniel Pinkham]] wrote for choir and electronic tape. [[Meredith Monk]]'s ''Panda Chant'' and ''Astronaut Anthem'' explore overtones in an unconventional text setting. Though difficult and rarely performed by amateurs, pieces that demonstrate such unfamiliar idioms have found their way into the repertories of the finest semi-professional and professional choirs around the world.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nMore accessible styles of choral music include that of [[Benjamin Britten]], including his ''[[War Requiem]]'', ''Five Flower Songs'', and ''[[Rejoice in the Lamb]]''. [[Francis Poulenc]]'s ''Motets pour le temps de no\u00ebl'', ''Gloria'', and ''Mass in G'' are often performed. A primitivist approach is exemplified by [[Carl Orff]]'s widely performed [[Carmina Burana (Orff)| ''Carmina Burana'']]. In the United States, [[Aaron Copland]], [[Samuel Barber]], and [[Randall Thompson]] wrote signature American pieces. In Eastern Europe, [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] and [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]] wrote a small amount of music for choirs. [[Frank Martin (composer) |Frank Martin]]'s Mass for double choir combines modality and allusion to Medieval and Renaissance forms with a distinctly modern harmonic language and has become the composer's most-performed work.\n\nThe so-called [[Holy minimalism |holy minimalists]] are represented by [[Arvo P\u00e4rt]], whose ''Johannespassion'' and Magnificat have received regular performances; [[John Tavener]] (''Song for Athene'') and [[Henryk G\u00f3recki]] (''{{Lang|la|Totus Tuus}}'') share this label. American minimalism and post minimalism are represented by [[Steve Reich]]'s ''[[The Desert Music]]'', choral excerpts from [[Philip Glass]]'s ''[[Einstein on the Beach]]'' and [[John Adams (composer) |John Adams]]' ''[[The Death of Klinghoffer]]'', and [[David Lang (composer)|David Lang]]'s Pulitzer Prize-winning'' Little Match Girl Passion''.\n[[File:XXV laulupidu (3).jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A choir of more than 30,000 participants performing to an audience of 80,000 in the 25th [[Estonian Song Festival]]]]\n\nAt the turn of the 21st century, choral music has received a resurgence of interest partly due to a renewed interest in accessible choral idioms.{{Citation needed|reason= Broad statement with limited scope needs to be researched.|date= February 2011}} Multi-cultural influences appear in [[Osvaldo Golijov]]'s St. Mark Passion, which melds the Bach-style passion form with Latin American street-music, and [[Chen Yi (composer) |Chen Yi]]'s Chinese Myths Cantata melds atonal idioms with traditional Chinese melodies played on traditional Chinese instruments. Some composers began to earn their reputation based foremost on their choral output, including the highly popular [[John Rutter]] and [[Eric Whitacre]]. The large-scale dramatic works of [[Karl Jenkins]] seem to hark back to the theatricality of Orff, and the music of [[James MacMillan (composer) |James MacMillan]] continues the tradition of boundary-pushing choral works from the United Kingdom begun by Britten, [[William Walton| Walton]], and [[Kenneth Leighton| Leighton]]. Meanwhile, composers such as [[John Williams]] (known primarily for film scores) and prominent concert orchestral composers such as [[Augusta Read Thomas]], [[Sofia Gubaidulina]], [[Aaron Jay Kernis]], and [[Thomas Ad\u00e8s]] also contribute vital additions to the choral repertoire.\n\nA number of traditions originating outside of classical concert-music have enriched the choral repertoire as well as providing new outlets to composers:\n\n* At the end of the 19th century, male voice choirs became popular with the [[coal miner]]s of [[South Wales]], and numerous choirs were established including the [[Treorchy Male Choir]], [[Morriston Orpheus Choir]] and Cor Meibion [[Pontypridd]] [[male voice choir | male-voice choir]]s. Although the mining communities which gave rise to these choirs largely died out in the 1970s and 1980s with the decline of the Welsh coal-industry, many of these choirs continue, and are seen{{by whom?|date=September 2019}} as a traditional part of [[Welsh culture]] and perform worldwide. Not all of the choirs were based on coal &ndash; some started in the rugby clubs, such as [[Cardiff Arms Park Male Choir]] and Morriston Rugby Choir, while others such as [[Pontarddulais Male Choir]] formed out of youth choirs.\n*Black [[Spiritual (music)| Spiritual]]s entered the concert repertoire with the tours of the [[Fisk University |Fisk College]] [[Fisk Jubilee Singers| Jubilee Singers]], and arrangements of such spirituals have become part of the standard choral repertoire.{{cn|date=September 2019}} Notable composers and arrangers of choral music in this tradition include [[William L. Dawson (composer) |William Dawson]], [[Jester Hairston]] and [[Moses Hogan]].\n* During the mid-20th century, [[barbershop music| barbershop]] quartets began experimenting with combining larger ensembles together into choruses which sing barbershop music in 4 parts, often with staging, choreography and costumes. The international barbershop chorus contest started in 1953 and continues to this day.\n* Contemporary choirs, such as [[Rock Choir]] and London Contemporary Voices in the United Kingdom, have become popular since the beginning of the 21st century.{{cn|date=September 2019}} They usually perform rock, pop, soul and [[Motown]] songs in close-part vocal harmony, often incorporating dance moves.\n\nApart from their roles in liturgy and entertainment, choirs and choruses may also have social-service functions,<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| last1                 = Hilliard\n| first1                = R.

In modern times, the smiley has become known for its yellow face and has evolved from a simple smiling face to display a range of facial emotions. Drawings of smileys have been traced back to ancient times, often displayed in caves and were often just two eyes and a curved upwards mouth.\n\nThe classic form desined by [[Harvey Ball]] in 1963 comprise a yellow circle with two black dots representing eyes and a black arc representing the mouth ('''{{emoji|263A}}'''). On the Internet and in other [[plain text]] communication channels, the [[emoticon]] form (sometimes also called the '''smiley-face emoticon''') has traditionally been most popular, typically employing a [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] and a right [[parenthesis]] to form sequences such as '''<code>:-)</code>''', '''<code>:)</code>''', '''<code>=)</code>''', '''<code>=D</code>''', or '''<code>(:</code>''' that resemble a smiling face when viewed after rotation through 90 degrees. \"Smiley\" is also sometimes used as a generic term for any emoticon (see [[Emoji]]). The smiley has been referenced in nearly all areas of Western culture including music, movies, and art. The smiley has also been associated with late 1980s and early 1990s [[rave]] culture.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/feb/21/smiley-face-design-history |title=Smiley Face Design History |author= Jon Savage |date=February 21, 2009 |accessdate= October 5, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://thump.vice.com/en_ca/article/history-smiley-face-acid-house-rave-culture-shoom|title=A Brief History of the Smiley Face, Rave Culture's Most Ubiquitous Symbol |author=Michaelangelo Matos |date=December 21, 2016 |accessdate=May 1, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youredm.com/2015/07/23/the-evolution-of-rave-fashion/|title=The Evolution of Rave Fashion  |first=Brian |last= Lim |date=July 23, 2015 |accessdate=May 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe plural form \"smilies\" is commonly used,<ref>[[Google Ngram Viewer]]: [https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=smileys%2Csmilies&year_start=1900 smilies vs smileys]</ref> but the variant spelling \"[[wikt:smilie|smilie]]\" is not as common as the \"y\" spelling.<ref>[[Google Ngram Viewer]]: [https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=smiley%2Csmilie&year_start=1900 smilie vs smiley]</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:--- Museo Arqueol\u00f3gico Nacional (34616548673).jpg|thumb|right|Bronze Age stelae in the [[Museo Arqueol\u00f3gico Nacional]], Madrid, Spain]]\nIn 2017, a team of [[archaeology|archaeologists]] led by Nicol\u00f2 Marchetti of the [[University of Bologna]] pieced together the fragments of a [[Hittites|Hittite]] pot from approximately 1700 BC that had been found in [[Karkam\u0131\u015f]], [[Turkey]].

Jensen]] was amongst other things famous for experimenting with the form of his writing. In a letter sent to publisher Ernst Bojesen in December 1900, he includes both a happy face and a sad face, resembling the modern smiley.\n\nA commercial version of a smiley face with the word \"THANKS\" above it was available in 1919 and applied as a sticker on receipts issued by the Buffalo Steam Roller Company in [[Buffalo, New York]]. The round face was much more detailed than the one depicted above, having eyebrows, nose, teeth, chin, facial creases and shading, and is reminiscent of \"man-in-the-moon\" style characterizations.\n\n[[Ingmar Bergman]]'s 1948 film ''[[Port of Call (1948 film)|Port of Call]]'' includes a scene where the unhappy Berit draws a ''sad'' face {{ndash}} closely resembling the modern \"frowny\", but including a dot for the nose {{ndash}} in lipstick on her mirror, before being interrupted.<ref>''Ingmarbergman.se''. [http://ingmarbergman.se/sites/default/files/hamnstad_1948-26_005_huvudbild_webb.jpg A still from the scene].</ref> In 1953 and 1958, similar happy faces were used in promotional campaigns for the films ''[[Lili]]'' (1953) and ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]'' (1958).\n\nA smiley was used in a promotion by New York radio station [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA]] beginning in 1962. Listeners who answered their phone \"WMCA Good Guys!\" were rewarded with a \"WMCA good guys\" sweatshirt that incorporated a happy face into its design. Thousands of these sweatshirts were given away.<ref>{{citation |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9059885/Smileys-People-Radio-4-The-million-dollar-smile.html |title= Smiley's People (Radio 4): The million-dollar smile |author= Alastair Sooke |date= February 3, 2012 |work= The Telegraph |quote= [Loufrani] points out that a smily face was a key feature of a well-known promotional campaign for a radio network on America\u2019s East Coast in the late Fifties.}}</ref><ref name=nyt2001 /><ref name=lennox /> The WMCA smiley was yellow with black dots as eyes, had a slightly crooked smile, and had no creases at the sides of the mouth.<ref name=lennox>{{citation |title= Now You Know More: The Book of Answers |series= Now You Know |volume= 2 |author= Doug Lennox, illustrated by Catriona Wight |edition= illustrated |publisher= Dundurn |year= 2004 |isbn= 9781550025309 |page= 50 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=P4gCzZsOY0UC&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=smiley+wmca&source=bl&ots=bQzVepXuqN&sig=BOcZ7SGOWHMENa5Yyuirjn6S_mg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rbgaUJGHLNO00QWl_oGgDQ&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=smiley%20wmca&f=false }}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = NYHT Smiley 10th March 1953.jpg\n| width1    = 160\n| caption1  = A poster for ''[[Lili]]'' in 1953\n| image2    = WMCA good guys sweatshirt 1962.gif\n| width2    = 300\n| caption2  = The [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA]] 1962 sweatshirt\n}}\n\nAccording to the [[Smithsonian Institution]], the smiley face as we know it today was created by [[Harvey Ross Ball]], an [[American people|American]] [[graphic artist]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stamp|first1=Jimmy|title=Who really invented the Smiley face|date=March 13, 2013|publisher=Smithsonian|location=Washington DC|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/who-really-invented-the-smiley-face-2058483/?no-ist|accessdate=May 29, 2015}}</ref> In 1963, Ball was employed by State Mutual Life Assurance Company of [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] (now known as [[Hanover Insurance]]) to create a happy face to raise the morale of the employees. Ball created the design in ten minutes and was paid $45 ({{Inflation|US|45|1963|fmt=eq}}). His rendition, with a bright yellow background, dark oval eyes, full smile, and creases at the sides of the mouth,<ref name=lennox/> was imprinted on more than fifty million buttons and became familiar around the world. The design is so simple that it is certain that similar versions were produced before 1963, including those cited above.

Tenagi's design was used in an advertising campaign for Seattle-based University Federal Savings & Loan. The ad campaign was inspired by [[Lee Adams]]'s lyrics in \"Put on a Happy Face\" from the musical ''[[Bye Bye Birdie]]''. Stern, the man behind this campaign, also later incorporated the Happy Face in his run for Seattle mayor in 1993.<ref name=\"Adams\"/>\n\nThe graphic was further popularized in the early 1970s by Philadelphia brothers Bernard and Murray Spain, who seized upon it in September 1970 in a campaign to sell novelty items. The two produced buttons as well as coffee mugs, [[t-shirts]], [[bumper stickers]] and many other items emblazoned with the symbol and the phrase \"Have a happy day\", which mutated into \"[[Have a nice day]]\". Working with New York button manufacturer NG Slater, some 50 million happy face badges were produced by 1972.<ref name=\"Peter Shapiro 2001, pp44-49\">Peter Shapiro, \"Smiling Faces Sometimes\", in ''The Wire'', issue 203, January 2001, pp. 44\u201349.</ref>\n\nIn 1972, Frenchman Franklin Loufrani became the first person to legally [[trademark]] the use of a smiley face. He used it to highlight the good news parts of the newspaper ''[[France Soir]]''. He simply called the design \"Smiley\" and launched [[The Smiley Company]]. In 1996 Loufrani's son Nicolas Loufrani took over the family business and built it into a multinational corporation. Nicolas Loufrani was outwardly skeptical of Harvey Ball's claim to creating the first smiley face. While noting that the design that his father came up with and Ball's design were nearly identical, Loufrani argued that the design is so simple that no one person can lay claim to having created it. As evidence for this, Loufrani's website points to early cave paintings found in France (2500 BC) that he claims are the first depictions of a smiley face. Loufrani also points to a 1960 radio ad campaign that reportedly made use of a similar design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/who-really-invented-the-smiley-face-2058483/?no-ist|title=Who Invented the Smiley Face?|author=Jimmy Stamp|work=Smithsonian}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Authentic Worcester-made smiley face, Harvey Ball.jpg|thumb|right|\"Authentic [[Hanover Insurance|Worcester]]-made smiley face\", by Harvey Ball]]\nThe rights to the Smiley trademark in one hundred countries are owned by the Smiley Company.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/05/business/worldbusiness/05smiley.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Thomas | last=Crampton | title=Smiley Face Is Serious to Company | date=July 5, 2006}}</ref> Its subsidiary SmileyWorld Ltd, in London, headed by Nicolas Loufrani, creates or approves all the Smiley products sold in countries where it holds the trademark.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_id/article/j5pyyb/the-man-who-owns-the-smiley-face|title=The Man Who Owns the Smiley Face|date=August 10, 2017|work=Vice|access-date=January 24, 2018|language=en-id}}</ref> The Smiley brand and logo have significant exposure through licensees in sectors such as clothing, home decoration, perfumery, plush, stationery, publishing, and through promotional campaigns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.licensing.biz/company-profiles/24/Smiley-Licensing |title=Smiley Licensing &#124; Company Profile by |website=Licensing.biz |accessdate=March 14, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229123013/http://www.licensing.biz/company-profiles/24/Smiley-Licensing |archivedate=February 29, 2012 }}</ref> The Smiley Company is one of the 100 biggest licensing companies in the world, with a turnover of US$167 million in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rankingthebrands.com/PDF/Top%20125%20Global%20Licensors%202011,%20License%20Global.pdf|format=PDF|title=Global License : Ranking the brands|website=Rankingthebrands.com|accessdate=September 21, 2018}}</ref> The first Smiley shop opened in London in the [[Boxpark]] shopping centre in December 2011.<ref>{{cite web |author=Giedrius Ivanauskas |url=http://madeinshoreditch.co.uk/2012/01/16/boxpark-shoreditch-interview-with-nicolas-loufrani-ceo-of-smiley/ |title=Boxpark Shoreditch: Interview with Nicolas Loufrani CEO of Smiley &#124; Made in Shoreditch - A Magazine About Style, Innovation, Dining, Nightlife and People in Shoreditch |publisher=Made in Shoreditch |date=January 16, 2012 |accessdate=March 14, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307075637/http://madeinshoreditch.co.uk/2012/01/16/boxpark-shoreditch-interview-with-nicolas-loufrani-ceo-of-smiley/ |archivedate=March 7, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, Franklin Loufrani and Smiley World attempted to acquire trademark rights to the symbol (and even to the word \"smiley\" itself) in the United States. This brought Loufrani into conflict with [[Wal-Mart]], which had begun prominently featuring a happy face in its \"Rolling Back Prices\" campaign over a year earlier.

Despite that, Wal-Mart sued an online parodist for alleged \"trademark infringement\" after he used the symbol (as well as various [[portmanteau]]s of \"Wal-\", such as \"Walocaust\").

Its origins in popular culture began during the 1970s when it was frequently used across multiple platforms. The smiley was also used frequently in cartoons and [[comics]]. The smiley's first use in print was in 1971, where Franklin Loufrani designed a smiley face for the newspaper, ''[[France-Soir]]''. The newspaper used Loufrani's smiley to highlight stories that they defined as ''\"feel-good news.\"''<ref name=vice>{{cite web |last1=Golby |first1=Joel |title=The Man Who Owns the Smiley Face |url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/j5pyyb/the-man-who-owns-the-smiley-face |publisher=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |date=August 9, 2017}}</ref> This particular smiley went onto form [[The Smiley Company]].\n\n[[Mad (magazine)|'' Mad'']] magazine notably used the smiley a year later in 1972 across their entire front page for the April edition of the magazine.

The association was cemented when the band [[Bomb the Bass]] used an extracted smiley from the comic book series ''[[Watchmen]]'' on the center of its \"[[Beat Dis]]\" hit single.\n\n[[File:Watchmen-smiley.svg|thumb|The ''[[Watchmen]]'' comic series logo]]\n\nIn 1980, [[Namco]] released the now famous [[Pac-man]], a yellow-faced cartoon character. In the late-1980s, the smiley again became a prominent image within the [[music industry]]. It was adopted during the growth of [[acid house]] across [[Europe]] and the UK in the late 1980s.

In modern times, the smiley has become known for its yellow face and has evolved from a simple smiling face to display a range of facial emotions. Drawings of smileys have been traced back to ancient times, often displayed in caves and were often just two eyes and a curved upwards mouth.\n\nThe classic form designed by [[Harvey Ball]] in 1963 comprises a yellow circle with two black dots representing eyes and a black arc representing the mouth ('''{{emoji|263A}}'''). On the Internet and in other [[plain text]] communication channels, the [[emoticon]] form (sometimes also called the '''smiley-face emoticon''') has traditionally been most popular, typically employing a [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] and a right [[parenthesis]] to form sequences such as '''<code>:-)</code>''', '''<code>:)</code>''', '''<code>=)</code>''', '''<code>=D</code>''', or '''<code>(:</code>''' that resemble a smiling face when viewed after rotation through 90 degrees. \"Smiley\" is also sometimes used as a generic term for any emoticon (see [[Emoji]]). The smiley has been referenced in nearly all areas of Western culture including music, movies, and art. The smiley has also been associated with late 1980s and early 1990s [[rave]] culture.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/feb/21/smiley-face-design-history |title=Smiley Face Design History |author= Jon Savage |date=February 21, 2009 |accessdate= October 5, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://thump.vice.com/en_ca/article/history-smiley-face-acid-house-rave-culture-shoom|title=A Brief History of the Smiley Face, Rave Culture's Most Ubiquitous Symbol |author=Michaelangelo Matos |date=December 21, 2016 |accessdate=May 1, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youredm.com/2015/07/23/the-evolution-of-rave-fashion/|title=The Evolution of Rave Fashion  |first=Brian |last= Lim |date=July 23, 2015 |accessdate=May 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe plural form \"smilies\" is commonly used,<ref>[[Google Ngram Viewer]]: [https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=smileys%2Csmilies&year_start=1900 smilies vs smileys]</ref> but the variant spelling \"[[wikt:smilie|smilie]]\" is not as common as the \"y\" spelling.<ref>[[Google Ngram Viewer]]: [https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=smiley%2Csmilie&year_start=1900 smilie vs smiley]</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:--- Museo Arqueol\u00f3gico Nacional (34616548673).jpg|thumb|right|Bronze Age stelae in the [[Museo Arqueol\u00f3gico Nacional]], Madrid, Spain]]\nIn 2017, a team of [[archaeology|archaeologists]] led by Nicol\u00f2 Marchetti of the [[University of Bologna]] pieced together the fragments of a [[Hittites|Hittite]] pot from approximately 1700 BC that had been found in [[Karkam\u0131\u015f]], [[Turkey]].

In a letter sent to publisher Ernst Bojesen in December 1900, he includes both a happy face and a sad face, resembling the modern smiley.\n\nA commercial version of a smiley face with the word \"THANKS\" above it was available in 1919 and applied as a sticker on receipts issued by the Buffalo Steam Roller Company in [[Buffalo, New York]].

Tenagi's design was used in an advertising campaign for Seattle-based University Federal Savings & Loan.

Stern, the man behind this campaign, also later incorporated the Happy Face in his run for Seattle mayor in 1993.<ref name=\"Adams\"/>\n\nThe graphic was further popularized in the early 1970s by Philadelphia brothers Bernard and Murray Spain, who seized upon it in September 1970 in a campaign to sell novelty items. The two produced buttons as well as coffee mugs, [[t-shirts]], [[bumper stickers]] and many other items emblazoned with the symbol and the phrase \"Have a happy day\", which mutated into \"[[Have a nice day]]\". Working with New York button manufacturer NG Slater, some 50 million happy face badges were produced by 1972.<ref name=\"Peter Shapiro 2001, pp44-49\">Peter Shapiro, \"Smiling Faces Sometimes\", in ''The Wire'', issue 203, January 2001, pp. 44\u201349.</ref>\n\nIn 1972, Frenchman Franklin Loufrani became the first person to legally [[trademark]] the use of a smiley face. He used it to highlight the good news parts of the newspaper ''[[France Soir]]''. He simply called the design \"Smiley\" and launched [[The Smiley Company]]. In 1996 Loufrani's son Nicolas Loufrani took over the family business and built it into a multinational corporation. Nicolas Loufrani was outwardly skeptical of Harvey Ball's claim to creating the first smiley face. While noting that the design that his father came up with and Ball's design were nearly identical, Loufrani argued that the design is so simple that no one person can lay claim to having created it. As evidence for this, Loufrani's website points to early cave paintings found in France (2500 BC) that he claims are the first depictions of a smiley face. Loufrani also points to a 1960 radio ad campaign that reportedly made use of a similar design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/who-really-invented-the-smiley-face-2058483/?no-ist|title=Who Really Invented the Smiley Face?|author=Jimmy Stamp|work=Smithsonian}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Authentic Worcester-made smiley face, Harvey Ball.jpg|thumb|right|\"Authentic [[Hanover Insurance|Worcester]]-made smiley face\", by Harvey Ball]]\nThe rights to the Smiley trademark in one hundred countries are owned by the Smiley Company.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/05/business/worldbusiness/05smiley.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Thomas | last=Crampton | title=Smiley Face Is Serious to Company | date=July 5, 2006}}</ref> Its subsidiary SmileyWorld Ltd, in London, headed by Nicolas Loufrani, creates or approves all the Smiley products sold in countries where it holds the trademark.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_id/article/j5pyyb/the-man-who-owns-the-smiley-face|title=The Man Who Owns the Smiley Face|date=August 10, 2017|work=Vice|access-date=January 24, 2018|language=en-id}}</ref> The Smiley brand and logo have significant exposure through licensees in sectors such as clothing, home decoration, perfumery, plush, stationery, publishing, and through promotional campaigns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.licensing.biz/company-profiles/24/Smiley-Licensing |title=Smiley Licensing &#124; Company Profile by |website=Licensing.biz |accessdate=March 14, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229123013/http://www.licensing.biz/company-profiles/24/Smiley-Licensing |archivedate=February 29, 2012 }}</ref> The Smiley Company is one of the 100 biggest licensing companies in the world, with a turnover of US$167 million in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rankingthebrands.com/PDF/Top%20125%20Global%20Licensors%202011,%20License%20Global.pdf|format=PDF|title=Global License : Ranking the brands|website=Rankingthebrands.com|accessdate=September 21, 2018}}</ref> The first Smiley shop opened in London in the [[Boxpark]] shopping centre in December 2011.<ref>{{cite web |author=Giedrius Ivanauskas |url=http://madeinshoreditch.co.uk/2012/01/16/boxpark-shoreditch-interview-with-nicolas-loufrani-ceo-of-smiley/ |title=Boxpark Shoreditch: Interview with Nicolas Loufrani CEO of Smiley &#124; Made in Shoreditch - A Magazine About Style, Innovation, Dining, Nightlife and People in Shoreditch |publisher=Made in Shoreditch |date=January 16, 2012 |accessdate=March 14, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307075637/http://madeinshoreditch.co.uk/2012/01/16/boxpark-shoreditch-interview-with-nicolas-loufrani-ceo-of-smiley/ |archivedate=March 7, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, Franklin Loufrani and Smiley World attempted to acquire trademark rights to the symbol (and even to the word \"smiley\" itself) in the United States.

Its origins in popular culture began during the 1970s when it was frequently used across multiple platforms. The smiley was also used frequently in cartoons and [[comics]]. The smiley's first use in print was in 1971, where Franklin Loufrani designed a smiley face for the newspaper, ''[[France-Soir]]''. The newspaper used Loufrani's smiley to highlight stories that they defined as ''\"feel-good news.\"''<ref name=vice>{{cite web |last1=Golby |first1=Joel |title=The Man Who Owns the Smiley Face |url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/j5pyyb/the-man-who-owns-the-smiley-face |publisher=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |date=August 9, 2017}}</ref> This particular smiley went onto form [[The Smiley Company]].\n\n[[Mad (magazine)|''Mad'']] magazine notably used the smiley a year later in 1972 across their entire front page for the April edition of the magazine.

The single cover was a collage aimed to look like that of a [[Nazi]] rally prior to [[World War II]].

The association was cemented when the band [[Bomb the Bass]] used an extracted smiley from the comic book series ''[[Watchmen]]'' on the center of its \"[[Beat Dis]]\" hit single.\n\n[[File:Watchmen-smiley.svg|thumb|The ''[[Watchmen]]'' comic series logo]]\n\nIn 1980, [[Namco]] released the now famous [[Pac-man]], a yellow faced cartoon character. In the late-1980s, the smiley again became a prominent image within the [[music industry]]. It was adopted during the growth of [[acid house]] across [[Europe]] and the UK in the late 1980s. According to many, this began when DJ, [[Danny Rampling]], used the smiley to celebrate [[Paul Oakenfold]]'s birthday.<ref>{{cite web |title=The strange, tangled history of the acid house smiley |url=https://www.redbull.com/gb-en/history-of-the-acid-house-smiley |publisher=[[Red Bull]]}}</ref> This sparked a movement where the smiley moved into various dance genres, becoming a symbol of 1980s dance music.<ref>{{cite web |title=Acid History: How The Smiley Became The Iconic Face Of Rave |url=https://www.electronicbeats.net/the-feed/untold-history-rave-smiley/ |publisher=ElectronicBeats magazine}}</ref>\n\nThe logo for the ''[[Watchmen]]'' comic book series includes a smiley with blood on top of it.

The first of his major works that included a smiley was his Flying Copper portrait, which was completed in 2004. It was during a period when Banksy experimented with working on canvas and paper portraits. He also used the smiley in 2005 to replace the face of the [[grim reaper]].

{"title_page": "Derryragh", "text_new": "'''Derryragh''' ({{Irish derived place name|Doire R\u00e1tha meaning 'The Oakwood of the Fort'}}) is a [[townland]] in the [[civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] of [[Templeport]], [[County Cavan]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]]. The local pronunciation is Dharraugh.\n\n==Geography==\n\nDerryragh is bounded on the north by [[Porturlan]] and [[Killywillin]] townlands, on the west by [[Ballymagauran]] townland, on the south by [[Sruhagh]] and [[Gorteen, Templeport]] townlands and on the east by [[Camagh]] townland. Its chief geographical features are Ballymagauran Lough, streams, five spring wells, dug wells and forestry plantations. Derryragh is traversed by the national secondary [[R205 road (Ireland)]], minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 208 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nAlthough J.P. Dalton suggested that the fort on top on Derryragh hill was the centre of the worship of the pagan idol [[Crom Cruach]], there is no evidence to support this.<ref name=\"Magh Slecht' 1921 pp. 23-67\">''Cromm Cruaich of Magh Slecht'' by Dalton, J.P., in Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy 36,(1921) pp. 23-67.</ref> Kevin White carried out an archaeological survey and found no such evidence [http://www.templeport.ie/magh-slecht-dara-fort/plain-of-blood.pdf ] and there is no mention in the Patrician sources or in the Book of Magauran to support such a suggestion. The fact that there are five spring wells in the townland and none of them are associated with [[Saint Patrick]], unlike others in the parish, is also a negative point. All the evidence points to the [[Killycluggin Stone]] being the Crom idol. At best the Darragh fort was an assembly or camping place for the Royal visitors on their pilgrimage to the idol. The placename may also be a corruption of 'Doire R\u00ed' meaning \"The King's Oakwood\". The only tradition connected with the fort is about a fairy living there.

It chanced one evening that he seen a gankeynogue in the field, sitting in under a bush, and he says: \"Yon lad will surely be worth a powerful weight of gold.\" With that he went over and caught a hold of the gankey. [According to Patrick Joyce in ''English as we speak it in Ireland'' (London 1910) Gankinna means a fairy or a leprechaun, from the Irish gann meaning small.]\n\n\"Let you discover a treasure.\" says he, \"or else I'll keep you like a dog on a chain from this out.\" \"Keep away!\" says the gankey. \"How would a poor creature like myself be finding treasure for a strong farmer!\" \"Let you not let on to be miserable,\" says the man, \"for well I know it's great wealth you enjoy.\" \"Is it me!\" says the gankeynogue. \"Sure I support a lengthy family entirely by my own industry.\" But the farmer would not believe a word of the sort. He carried the gankey to his house and put him into a big oak chest. \"You'll never get out except for to show me where treasure is lodged,\" he allows. But the gankeynogue wasn't in notion of giving the least information. He sat up in the oak chest, hammering, shouting and singing until he had the people's heads light.

It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]]. The local pronunciation is Dharraugh.\n\n==Geography==\n\nDerryragh is bounded on the north by [[Porturlan]] and [[Killywillin]] townlands, on the west by [[Ballymagauran]] townland, on the south by [[Sruhagh]] and [[Gorteen, Templeport]] townlands and on the east by [[Camagh]] townland. Its chief geographical features are Ballymagauran Lough, streams, five spring wells, dug wells and forestry plantations. Derryragh is traversed by the national secondary [[R205 road (Ireland)]], minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 208 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nAlthough J.P. Dalton suggested that the fort on top on Derryragh hill was the centre of the worship of the pagan idol [[Crom Cruach]], there is no evidence to support this.<ref name=\"Magh Slecht' 1921 pp. 23-67\">''Cromm Cruaich of Magh Slecht'' by Dalton, J.P., in Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy 36,(1921) pp. 23-67.</ref> Kevin White carried out an archaeological survey and found no such evidence [http://www.templeport.ie/magh-slecht-dara-fort/plain-of-blood.pdf ] and there is no mention in the Patrician sources or in the Book of Magauran to support such a suggestion. The fact that there are five spring wells in the townland and none of them are associated with [[Saint Patrick]], unlike others in the parish, is also a negative point. All the evidence points to the [[Killycluggin Stone]] being the Crom idol. At best the Darragh fort was an assembly or camping place for the Royal visitors on their pilgrimage to the idol. The placename may also be a corruption of 'Doire R\u00ed' meaning \"The King's Oakwood\". The only tradition connected with the fort is about a fairy living there. A book published in 1912 entitled \"''Folk Tales of Breffny''\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/folktalesofbreff00hunt|title=Folk tales of Breffny|first=Bampton|last=Hunt|date=April 11, 1912|publisher=London : Macmillan|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> by a Templeport author Mrs Augusta Wardell, n\u00e9e Hunt, under the pen name 'Bunda Hunt' gives a version of the tale which she learned it at the age of seven from an old man named Dolan. It goes as follows-\n\n{{blockquote|There was once a man of these parts and he had a great longing for to find a treasure. It chanced one evening that he seen a gankeynogue in the field, sitting in under a bush, and he says: \"Yon lad will surely be worth a powerful weight of gold.\" With that he went over and caught a hold of the gankey. [According to Patrick Joyce in ''English as we speak it in Ireland'' (London 1910) Gankinna means a fairy or a leprechaun, from the Irish gann meaning small.]\n\n\"Let you discover a treasure.\" says he, \"or else I'll keep you like a dog on a chain from this out.\" \"Keep away!\" says the gankey. \"How would a poor creature like myself be finding treasure for a strong farmer!\" \"Let you not let on to be miserable,\" says the man, \"for well I know it's great wealth you enjoy.\" \"Is it me!\" says the gankeynogue. \"Sure I support a lengthy family entirely by my own industry.\" But the farmer would not believe a word of the sort. He carried the gankey to his house and put him into a big oak chest. \"You'll never get out except for to show me where treasure is lodged,\" he allows. But the gankeynogue wasn't in notion of giving the least information. He sat up in the oak chest, hammering, shouting and singing until he had the people's heads light. All the while the farmer was determined to get the better of him and he never agreed to let him go. The lad was his tenth day in the chest when the man of the house came running in that evening, shouting at the top of his voice: \"Darragh fort's on fire!

Cohen discovered that most therapists either didn\u2019t have a clue how to help him, or simply told him he was born that way and to embrace a gay life.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nPursuing his dream for marriage led to an exhaustive search for answers. Cohen discovered the root causes of his same-sex attractions, and began to resolve each underlying issue with the help of therapy, family, friends, and faith. He dedicated the rest of his life to promote healing and wholeness for those who struggled as he had, and for all people regardless of their race, religion, ethnicity, gender identity, or sexual orientation.<ref>[http://ex-gaytruth.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/richard-cohen.pdf Richard Cohen], ex-gaytruth</ref>\n\nCohen lives in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area with his wife of forty years, while his three adult children are making their mark in the world.\n\n==Education==\nCohen received a [[Bachelor of Arts|Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree from [[Boston University]] and a [[Master of Arts|Master of Arts degree]] in [[counseling psychology|Counseling Psychology]] from [[Antioch University]].<ref name=\"post\" /> In Seattle, Washington, he worked for the American Red Cross as an HIV/AIDS educator and authored a statewide curriculum for child-care provider and foster parents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timetouchandtalk.com/author/|title=Author Biography|last=|first=|date=|website=Healing Heterosexuality: Time, Touch and Talk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n=== International Healing Foundation / Positive Approaches to Healthy Sexuality ===\nCohen founded the International Healing Foundation (IHF) in 1990, a [[nonprofit]] organization, to assist those who experience unwanted same-sex attraction (SSA) through Sexual Orientation Therapy.

The capital of the district, [[Bragan\u00e7a, Portugal|Bragan\u00e7a]], is {{convert|217|km}} from [[Porto]], the second largest town in Portugal, {{convert|107|km}} from the Spanish town of [[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]] and {{convert|169|km}} from   [[Salamanca]], also in Spain.<ref name=\"Quantitative\">Sreko Devjak et al.

It is bordered by [[Spain]] ([[Castile and Leon]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]) in the north and northeast, [[Vila Real District]] in the west, [[Viseu District]] in the southwest and [[Guarda District]] in the south.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Domus Municipalis 4.jpg|thumb|235px|left|The ancient ''[[Domus Municipalis]]'' in the Roman [[civitas]] of ''Brigantia'' was the base of organized settlement]]\n[[File:Afonso first Duke of Braganza.jpg|left|235px|left|thumb|[[Afonso, Duke of Braganza|Afonso]], first [[Duke of Braganza]], whose Dukedom developed from the Bragan\u00e7\u00e3o family lands established in [[Castro de Avel\u00e3s]]]]\nDuring the Roman era, the territory was part of the much larger province of [[Gallaecia]], dependent administratively on [[Astorga, Spain|Astorga]] and the gold, iron and silver trade route. Although names similar to Bragan\u00e7a appeared around 666 B.C. (Wamba) or 569 A.D. (Council of Lugo), a territory identifiable as ''Bragan\u00e7a'' only appeared after the [[Celt]]s who baptised one of their main settlements ''Brigantia'', in the second century, which was later Latinized to ''Bragan\u00e7a''. But this settlement was limited.\n\nThe region's name was derived from the traditional feudal history of the northern region: the Bragan\u00e7\u00e3os family of [[Castro de Avel\u00e3s]] were the basis of this lineage that included Fern\u00e3o Mendes, who later married the Infanta Sancha (daughter of [[Afonso Henriques]]), inheriting the region on the death of the King. The Bragan\u00e7\u00e3os would maintain their hold on the region until 1258, when [[Afonso III of Portugal|Afonso III]] transferred the title to Nuno Martins, but the name ''Bragan\u00e7\u00e3o'' would continue to influence the region. Eventually, the King [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]] established the [[Duchy|Dukedom]] of the ''[[Duchy of Braganza]]'' for his uncle, [[Afonso, Duke of Braganza|Afonso, Count of Barcelos]] to strengthen the ties of the crown to the land. When the royal [[House of Braganza]] ascended to the throne of Portugal (through [[John IV of Portugal|John IV]]), the significance of ''Bragan\u00e7a'', as the hereditary seat of the Kings and Emperors of Portugal was sealed.\n\nThe district of Bragan\u00e7a was constituted upon the creation of the district system on 25 April 1835; a creation of the Liberal government, it was inspired by the [[France|French]] ''[[d\u00e9partements]]'', with the objective to ''\"facilitate the action of government...and permit access to the authorities\"''.<ref>Lu\u00eds Silveira (1997)</ref> The establishment of the districts was primarily done to counteract the centralizing tendencies of the governmental authority.<ref>Governador Civil de Braga (2002), p.1</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Physical geography===\nThe district is composed of two distinct regions described in terms of its geographic differences: the northern areas, with the higher altitudes constitute the ''Terra Fria Transmontana'' (''Cold lands''), and the [[Alto Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes]], where the landscape is dominated gentler slopes of the plateau; and the southern areas, the ''Terra Quente Trasmontana'' (''Hot Lands''), where the climate is milder, marked by the valleys of the [[Douro River]] and its tributaries. Its area allows a wide diversity of landscapes, and the district is known for its climatic differences (nine months of winter and three of heat), its rugged geomorphology, an aging population and urban to rural migration of its residents over time.\n\nIt is the [[Douro River]] that characterizes the geography, dividing the borders within the district, its southern frontier and extreme northeast borders with Spain. It is in the Douro valley that the lowlands of the district are primarily located, although almost all are 400 metres above sea level, with the exception of the municipality of [[Mirandela Municipality|Mirandela]] and its rivers. In addition to the Douro, the rivers of the district run north to south (or northeast to southwest) within the Douro watershed. The principal rivers are the Tua River, which springs from the mountains of Mirandela, at the confluence of Tuela and Raba\u00e7al Rivers, and the Sabor River, which springs in Spain, and crosses the eastern part of the district. Both rivers have a network of tributaries, such as the Baceiro River (feeding the Tuela), the Mente River (serving the Raba\u00e7al), and the Azibo River (supporting the Sabor).\n\nThe mountain ranges divide these water courses: the Serra da Nogueira (approximately 1320 metres) separates the Tuela and Sabor valleys; more to the south, the Serra de Bornes (1199 metres), in the municipalities of [[Macedo de Cavaleiros Municipality|Macedo de Cavaleiros]] and [[Alf\u00e2ndega da F\u00e9 Municipality|Alf\u00e2ndega da F\u00e9]] separate the Tua and Sabor Rivers; to the east, the columns of the Serra do Mogadouro (997 metres) separate the Sabor and Douro; and in the north, at the border with Spain, the largest mountains in the region the Serra da Coroa (1274 metres), north of [[Vinhais Municipality|Vinhais]], and the Serra de Montesinho (1400 metres) at the frontier, shield the Spanish autonomous communities from Portugal. A major part of the dams in the district are located along the Douro; the Valeira, Pocinho, Saucelle, Aldead\u00e1vila, Bemposta, Picote and Miranda Dams, along the main river, and the Azibo, Nuzedo de Baixo and Rebordelo, along its tributaries.\n\n====Ecoregions/protected areas====\nBragan\u00e7a includes several natural sanctuaries, such as the ''[[Montesinho Natural Park|Parque Natural de Montesinho]]'', the ''[[Parque Natural do Douro Internacional]]'', and the ''Paisagem Protegida da Albufeira do Azibo'', oasises in the northwest part of the [[Iberian peninsula|peninsula]].\n\n===Human geography===\nConsisting of twelve municipalities, the district of Bragan\u00e7a is the fifth largest district of Portugal: \n* [[Alf\u00e2ndega da F\u00e9 Municipality|Alf\u00e2ndega da F\u00e9]]\n* [[Bragan\u00e7a Municipality|Bragan\u00e7a]]\n* [[Carrazeda de Ansi\u00e3es Municipality|Carrazeda de Ansi\u00e3es]]\n* [[Freixo de Espada \u00e0 Cinta Municipality|Freixo de Espada \u00e0 Cinta]]\n* [[Macedo de Cavaleiros Municipality|Macedo de Cavaleiros]]\n* [[Miranda do Douro Municipality|Miranda do Douro]]\n* [[Mirandela Municipality|Mirandela]]\n* [[Mogadouro Municipality|Mogadouro]]\n* [[Torre de Moncorvo|Moncorvo]]\n* [[Vila Flor]]\n* [[Vimioso Municipality|Vimioso]]\n* [[Vinhais Municipality|Vinhais]]\n\n==Politics==\nOne of 18 Portuguese districts, this administrative division serves to define electoral units for proportional representation in national elections; administrative centres for police, courts and other public orders; and some local offices of ministries.<ref name=\"Game\">James P.

It is bordered by [[Spain]] ([[Castile and Leon]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]) in the north and northeast, [[Vila Real District]] in the west, [[Viseu District]] in the southwest and [[Guarda District]] in the south.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Domus Municipalis 4.jpg|thumb|235px|left|The ancient ''[[Domus Municipalis]]'' in the Roman [[civitas]] of ''Brigantia'' was the base of organized settlement]]\n[[File:Afonso first Duke of Braganza.jpg|left|235px|left|thumb|[[Afonso, Duke of Braganza|Afonso]], first [[Duke of Braganza]], whose Dukedom developed from the Bragan\u00e7\u00e3o family lands established in [[Castro de Avel\u00e3s]]]]\nDuring the Roman era, the territory was part of the much larger province of [[Gallaecia]], dependent administratively on [[Astorga, Spain|Astorga]] and the gold, iron and silver trade route. Although names similar to Bragan\u00e7a appeared around 666 B.C. (Wamba) or 569 A.D. (Council of Lugo), a territory identifiable as ''Bragan\u00e7a'' only appeared after the [[Celt]]s who baptised one of their main settlements ''Brigantia'', in the second century, which was later Latinized to ''Bragan\u00e7a''. But this settlement was limited.\n\nThe region's name was derived from the traditional feudal history of the northern region: the Bragan\u00e7\u00e3os family of [[Castro de Avel\u00e3s]] were the basis of this lineage that included Fern\u00e3o Mendes, who later married the Infanta Sancha (daughter of [[Afonso Henriques]]), inheriting the region on the death of the King. The Bragan\u00e7\u00e3os would maintain their hold on the region until 1258, when [[Afonso III of Portugal|Afonso III]] transferred the title to Nuno Martins, but the name ''Bragan\u00e7\u00e3o'' would continue to influence the region. Eventually, the King [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]] established the [[Duchy|Dukedom]] of the ''[[Duchy of Braganza]]'' for his uncle, [[Afonso, Duke of Braganza|Afonso, Count of Barcelos]] to strengthen the ties of the crown to the land. When the royal [[House of Braganza]] ascended to the throne of Portugal (through [[John IV of Portugal|John IV]]), the significance of ''Bragan\u00e7a'', as the hereditary seat of the Kings and Emperors of Portugal was sealed.\n\nThe district of Bragan\u00e7a was constituted upon the creation of the district system on 25 April 1835; a creation of the Liberal government, it was inspired by the [[France|French]] ''[[d\u00e9partements]]'', with the objective to ''\"facilitate the action of government...and permit access to the authorities\"''.<ref>Lu\u00eds Silveira (1997)</ref> The establishment of the districts was primarily done to counteract the centralizing tendencies of the governmental authority.<ref>Governador Civil de Braga (2002), p.1</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Physical geography===\nThe district is composed of two distinct regions described in terms of its geographic differences: the northern areas, with the higher altitudes constitute the ''Terra Fria Transmontana'' (''Cold lands''), and the [[Alto Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes]], where the landscape is dominated gentler slopes of the plateau; and the southern areas, the ''Terra Quente Trasmontana'' (''Hot Lands''), where the climate is milder, marked by the valleys of the [[Douro River]] and its tributaries. Its area allows a wide diversity of landscapes, and the district is known for its climatic differences (nine months of winter and three of heat), its rugged geomorphology, an aging population and urban to rural migration of its residents over time.\n\nIt is the [[Douro River]] that characterizes the geography, dividing the borders within the district, its southern frontier and extreme northeast borders with Spain. It is in the Douro valley that the lowlands of the district are primarily located, although almost all are 400 metres above sea level, with the exception of the municipality of [[Mirandela Municipality|Mirandela]] and its rivers. In addition to the Douro, the rivers of the district run north to south (or northeast to southwest) within the Douro watershed. The principal rivers are the Tua River, which springs from the mountains of Mirandela, at the confluence of Tuela and Raba\u00e7al Rivers, and the Sabor River, which springs in Spain, and crosses the eastern part of the district. Both rivers have a network of tributaries, such as the Baceiro River (feeding the Tuela), the Mente River (serving the Raba\u00e7al), and the Azibo River (supporting the Sabor).\n\nThe mountain ranges divide these water courses: the Serra da Nogueira (approximately 1320 metres) separates the Tuela and Sabor valleys; more to the south, the Serra de Bornes (1199 metres), in the municipalities of [[Macedo de Cavaleiros Municipality|Macedo de Cavaleiros]] and [[Alf\u00e2ndega da F\u00e9 Municipality|Alf\u00e2ndega da F\u00e9]] separate the Tua and Sabor Rivers; to the east, the columns of the Serra do Mogadouro (997 metres) separate the Sabor and Douro; and in the north, at the border with Spain, the largest mountains in the region the Serra da Coroa (1274 metres), north of [[Vinhais Municipality|Vinhais]], and the Serra de Montesinho (1400 metres) at the frontier, shield the Spanish autonomous communities from Portugal. A major part of the dams in the district are located along the Douro; the Valeira, Pocinho, Saucelle, Aldead\u00e1vila, Bemposta, Picote and Miranda Dams, along the main river, and the Azibo, Nuzedo de Baixo and Rebordelo, along its tributaries.\n\n====Ecoregions/protected areas====\nBragan\u00e7a includes several natural sanctuaries, such as the ''[[Montesinho Natural Park|Parque Natural de Montesinho]]'', the ''[[Parque Natural do Douro Internacional]]'', and the ''Paisagem Protegida da Albufeira do Azibo'', oasises in the northwest part of the [[Iberian peninsula|peninsula]].\n\n===Human geography===\nConsisting of twelve municipalities, the district of Bragan\u00e7a is the fifth largest district of Portugal: \n* [[Alf\u00e2ndega da F\u00e9 Municipality|Alf\u00e2ndega da F\u00e9]]\n* [[Bragan\u00e7a Municipality|Bragan\u00e7a]]\n* [[Carrazeda de Ansi\u00e3es Municipality|Carrazeda de Ansi\u00e3es]]\n* [[Freixo de Espada \u00e0 Cinta Municipality|Freixo de Espada \u00e0 Cinta]]\n* [[Macedo de Cavaleiros Municipality|Macedo de Cavaleiros]]\n* [[Miranda do Douro Municipality|Miranda do Douro]]\n* [[Mirandela Municipality|Mirandela]]\n* [[Mogadouro Municipality|Mogadouro]]\n* [[Torre de Moncorvo|Moncorvo]]\n* [[Vila Flor]]\n* [[Vimioso Municipality|Vimioso]]\n* [[Vinhais Municipality|Vinhais]]\n\n==Politics==\nOne of 18 Portuguese districts, this administrative division serves to define electoral units for proportional representation in national elections; administrative centres for police, courts and other public orders; and some local offices of ministries.<ref name=\"Game\">James P.
