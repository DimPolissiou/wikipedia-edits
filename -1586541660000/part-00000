However, members of the kicking team (excluding the kicker) line up at the receiving team's 35-yard line and blockers on the receiving team must line up at their 30-yard line. Only the kicker and returner(s) can move until the ball is either caught or three seconds after it hits the ground.\n*Kickoffs that go out of bounds, or fall short of the receiving team's 20-yard line,<ref name=\"XFL Rules\" /> come to the kicking team's 45-yard line.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/patriciatraina/2019/09/03/why-former-giants-offensive-coordinator-kevin-gilbride-joined-the-xfl/|title=Why Former Giants Offensive Coordinator Kevin Gilbride Joined The XFL|first=Patricia|last=Traina|website=Forbes}}</ref> (The NFL and NCAA only require a kick travel 10 yards; kicks out of bounds are placed at the receiving team's 40 yard line.)\n*The XFL uses two different types of touchbacks. A major touchback occurs when a kick travels into the endzone in the air, which results in the receiving team taking possession at the 35. A minor touchback occurs when the ball bounces into the endzone, which results in the receiving team taking possession at the 15. These rules discourage either team from purposefully taking a touchback.\n*Teams can request to attempt an [[onside kick]] under more conventional kickoff rules. If a team opts for an onside kick, the ball must travel at least ten yards before it can be recovered by the kicking team (as with other leagues) but may not travel more than 20 yards downfield in the air from the spot of the kick, to prevent the formation from being used as a [[loophole]].<ref name=\"teamnine\">{{cite web|url=https://xfl2k.com/news/oliver-luck-talks-tv-deals-draft-and-xfls-team-9/|title=Oliver Luck talks TV deals, Draft and XFL's \"Team 9\" {{!}} XFL2k|last=Rachuk|first=Stephan|date=April 24, 2019|website=XFL2K.com|language=en-US|access-date=April 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Punts ====\n\n*The XFL does not allow [[gunner (gridiron football)|gunners]]; all players on a punting team must remain on or behind the line of scrimmage until the ball is kicked.<ref>McAfee, Pat.

In the event the defense secures a turnover and returns the ball for a touchdown, the defensive team scores the same number of points as the offense was aiming to score.\n\n==== Double-forward pass ====\nTeams are able to attempt two forward passes on the same play, so long as the ball never crosses the line of scrimmage before the second pass.\n\n==== Overtime ====\nOvertime is decided by a five-round [[penalty shootout|shootout]] of two-point conversions similar to a penalty shootout in soccer or ice hockey. Such a shootout had never been attempted in organized football at the time the rule was proposed; in April 2019, the [[NCAA]] adopted a similar concept for games that reach a fifth overtime starting with the [[2019 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2019 FBS season]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/04/07/spring-league-returns-with-revolutionary-overtime-idea/|title=Spring League returns with revolutionary overtime idea|last=Florio|first=Mike|date=April 7, 2019|work=Profootballtalk.com|accessdate=April 7, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Greg |title=Targeting protocols approved for football |url=http://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/media-center/news/targeting-protocols-approved-football |publisher=NCAA |accessdate=July 11, 2019}}</ref> Unlike other football leagues, a coin toss is not used to determine who is on offense first; instead, the visiting team is on offense first and home team on defense first for each round, similar to baseball.

Pre-snap offensive penalties result in the ball being respotted pursuant to regular rules, while post-snap offensive penalties result in a loss of down and no score. If both teams remain tied after five rounds, multiple rounds of conversions will be played until one team succeeds, thus ensuring that no game can end in a draw.<ref name=\"XFL Rules\" />\n\n==== Clock changes ====\n*Outside of the [[two-minute warning]], the clock runs continuously.

([[Arena football]] has long used a continuous clock with even fewer stoppages; Canadian football does not use a continuous clock, but stops the clock after all plays from scrimmage following that code's [[three-minute warning]].)\n*The [[play clock]] is 25 seconds long measured from the spotting of the ball, roughly the same as the NCAA rule for plays when the clock is stopped. (This is five seconds longer than the CFL rule, which is 20 seconds from the spotting of the ball. The XFL's efforts to speed up spotting are aimed to make the two lengths of time nearly the same, 30 to 32 seconds overall.) The NFL standard is 40 seconds from the end of the previous play, also used during the NCAA during plays when the clock is running; the former AAF and previous XFL measure was 35 seconds from the end of the previous play.<ref name=\"auto\"/> In conjunction with this rule, the XFL has a one-way radio in all offensive players' helmets to allow the [[offensive coordinator]] to run a [[no-huddle offense]] and call plays directly to all of the players from the sidelines.

This is in contrast to the former [[Alliance of American Football|AAF]], which eliminated kickoffs outright, and the NFL and college football, both of which imposed rules minimizing the impact of the kickoff in the mid-2010s to improve player safety.<ref name=\"ap51019\" /> Many of these kickoff rules were adapted from rules created by The Spring League's predecessor, the [[Fall Experimental Football League]].<ref name=\"espn2\">{{cite news|last1=Seifert|first1=Kevin|title=Inside slant: FXFL set to debut, ready or not|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/143981/inside-slant-fxfl-set-to-debut-ready-or-not|accessdate=October 8, 2014|work=ESPN.com|publisher=ESPN|date=October 8, 2014}}</ref>\n*The spot of the kickoff is set at the kicking team's 30-yard line.<ref name=\"seifertrulesreveal\">{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/28438441/xfl-rule-changes-focus-faster-pace-more-excitement|title=XFL rule changes to focus on faster pace, more excitement|first=Kevin|last=Seifert|work=[[ESPN.com]]|date=January 7, 2020|access-date=January 7, 2020}}</ref> (The NFL and college standard is the 35-yard line.) However, members of the kicking team (excluding the kicker) line up at the receiving team's 35-yard line and blockers on the receiving team must line up at their 30-yard line. Only the kicker and returner(s) can move until the ball is either caught or three seconds after it hits the ground.\n*Kickoffs that go out of bounds, or fall short of the receiving team's 20-yard line,<ref name=\"XFL Rules\" /> come to the kicking team's 45-yard line.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/patriciatraina/2019/09/03/why-former-giants-offensive-coordinator-kevin-gilbride-joined-the-xfl/|title=Why Former Giants Offensive Coordinator Kevin Gilbride Joined The XFL|first=Patricia|last=Traina|website=Forbes}}</ref> (The NFL and NCAA only require a kick travel 10 yards; kicks out of bounds are placed at the receiving team's 40 yard line.)\n*The XFL uses two different types of touchbacks. A major touchback occurs when a kick travels into the endzone in the air, which results in the receiving team taking possession at the 35. A minor touchback occurs when the ball bounces into the endzone, which results in the receiving team taking possession at the 15. These rules discourage either team from purposefully taking a touchback.\n*Teams can request to attempt an [[onside kick]] under more conventional kickoff rules. If a team opts for an onside kick, the ball must travel at least ten yards before it can be recovered by the kicking team (as with other leagues) but may not travel more than 20 yards downfield in the air from the spot of the kick, to prevent the formation from being used as a [[loophole]].<ref name=\"teamnine\">{{cite web|url=https://xfl2k.com/news/oliver-luck-talks-tv-deals-draft-and-xfls-team-9/|title=Oliver Luck talks TV deals, Draft and XFL's \"Team 9\" {{!}} XFL2k|last=Rachuk|first=Stephan|date=April 24, 2019|website=XFL2K.com|language=en-US|access-date=April 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Punts ====\n\n*The XFL does not allow [[gunner (gridiron football)|gunners]]; all players on a punting team must remain on or behind the line of scrimmage until the ball is kicked.<ref>McAfee, Pat.

The attempts to neutralize punt coverage are made with the intention of encouraging more [[Glossary of American football#F|fourth-down conversions]]; Luck conceded halfway through the inaugural season that the effort was largely unsuccessful, as coaches continued to punt as usual.<ref name=sixmidseasontakeaways/>\n*The same touchback rules for kickoffs also applies to punts.\n\n==== Points after touchdown ====\nThe conventional [[extra point]] kick was replaced with a scrimmage play, varying in point value depending on how far the touchdown-scoring team chooses to take the snap from the goal line: a two-yard attempt scores a single point, a five-yard attempt [[two-point conversion|two points]], and a ten-yard attempt three points.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/04/08/xfl-to-use-one-two-three-point-conversions/|title=XFL to use one-, two-, three-point conversions|last=Florio|first=Mike|date=April 8, 2019|website=ProFootballTalk|language=en|access-date=April 9, 2019}}</ref> (This rule is also a carryover from the original XFL, which added the rule only for the playoffs. The [[Stars Football League]] also used the rule during its existence.) In the event the defense secures a turnover and returns the ball for a touchdown, the defensive team scores the same number of points as the offense was aiming to score.\n\n==== Double-forward pass ====\nTeams are able to attempt two forward passes on the same play, so long as the ball never crosses the line of scrimmage before the second pass.\n\n==== Overtime ====\nOvertime is decided by a five-round [[penalty shootout|shootout]] of two-point conversions similar to a penalty shootout in soccer or ice hockey. Such a shootout had never been attempted in organized football at the time the rule was proposed; in April 2019, the [[NCAA]] adopted a similar concept for games that reach a fifth overtime starting with the [[2019 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2019 FBS season]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/04/07/spring-league-returns-with-revolutionary-overtime-idea/|title=Spring League returns with revolutionary overtime idea|last=Florio|first=Mike|date=April 7, 2019|work=Profootballtalk.com|accessdate=April 7, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Greg |title=Targeting protocols approved for football |url=http://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/media-center/news/targeting-protocols-approved-football |publisher=NCAA |accessdate=July 11, 2019}}</ref> Unlike other football leagues, a coin toss is not used to determine who is on offense first; instead, the visiting team is on offense first and home team on defense first for each round, similar to baseball.

Pre-snap offensive penalties result in the ball being respotted pursuant to regular rules, while post-snap offensive penalties result in a loss of down and no score. If both teams remain tied after five rounds, multiple rounds of conversions will be played until one team succeeds, thus ensuring that no game can end in a draw.<ref name=\"XFL Rules\" />\n\n==== Clock changes ====\n*Outside of the [[two-minute warning]], the clock runs continuously. During this time, the clock only stops during a change of possession.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://xfl2k.com/news/wwe-issues-fan-survey-asking-fans-what-they-would-like-to-see-in-the-xfl/|title=WWE issues fan survey asking fans what they would like to see in the XFL {{!}} XFL2k|last=Rachuk|first=Stephan|date=April 12, 2019|website=XFL2K.com|language=en-US|access-date=April 12, 2019}}</ref> This reverses after the [[two-minute warning]] (which the XFL uses), after which the clock stops after all plays from scrimmage<ref name=tbt7119>{{cite web|url=https://www.tampabay.com/sports/bucs/2019/07/01/how-the-xfl-will-be-different-from-the-nfl/|title=How the XFL will be different from the NFL|first=Thomas|last=Bassinger|work=Tampa Bay Times|date=July 1, 2019|accessdate=July 1, 2019}}</ref> until the ball is spotted and reverts to NFL timing rules otherwise, stopping after incomplete passes, advancing the ball out of bounds and spiking the football. ([[Arena football]] has long used a continuous clock with even fewer stoppages; Canadian football does not use a continuous clock, but stops the clock after all plays from scrimmage following that code's [[three-minute warning]].)\n*The [[play clock]] is 25 seconds long measured from the spotting of the ball, roughly the same as the NCAA rule for plays when the clock is stopped. (This is five seconds longer than the CFL rule, which is 20 seconds from the spotting of the ball. The XFL's efforts to speed up spotting are aimed to make the two lengths of time nearly the same, 30 to 32 seconds overall.) The NFL standard is 40 seconds from the end of the previous play, also used during the NCAA during plays when the clock is running; the former AAF and previous XFL measure was 35 seconds from the end of the previous play.<ref name=\"auto\"/> In conjunction with this rule, the XFL has a one-way radio in all offensive players' helmets to allow the [[offensive coordinator]] to run a [[no-huddle offense]] and call plays directly to all of the players from the sidelines.

It holds a maximum of 40 players at a time and is meant to prepare players for call up to one of the XFL's 8 teams to fill roster vacancies due to injuries of other players or if the teams see a player as a \"hidden gem\". The team shares practice facilities and support staff with the [[Dallas Renegades]] but maintains its own coaching staff; its head coach is [[Bart Andrus]] and is assisted by [[Pete Kuharchek]] and [[Peter Vaas]].\n\nDuring the first two weeks of the season, teams are encouraged to use players from Team 9 to fill roster spots, but are not required to do so, as they may prefer to sign a player unaffiliated with the XFL or re-sign a player who participated in their preseason camps but was cut. After Week 2, exclusively using Team 9 players to fill rosters will become a requirement, with Team 9 constantly replenishing itself by adding new players from outside the XFL.\n\nOn March 10, each team's maximum roster size increased from 52 to 57 players and the majority of Team 9 was dispersed.

War broke out in April 1861 when [[Confederate States of America|secessionist]] forces attacked [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]] in [[South Carolina]] shortly after [[Abraham Lincoln]] had been [[First inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|inaugurated]] as the [[President of the United States]]. The loyalists of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in the North, which also included some geographically western and southern states, proclaimed support for the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]]. They faced secessionists of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]] in the South, who advocated for [[states' rights]] in order to uphold slavery.\n\nOf the 34 [[U.S. state]]s in February 1861, seven Southern [[Slave states and free states|slave-holding states\"]] were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country, and the  [[Confederate States of America]] was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government. The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states, and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from [[Government in exile|native secessionists fleeing Union authority]]. These states were given full representation in the [[Confederate States Congress|Confederate Congress]] throughout the Civil War. The two remaining \"slave states\", Delaware and Maryland, were invited to join the Confederacy, but nothing substantial developed due to [[Ex parte Merryman|intervention]] [[Habeas Corpus Suspension Act (1863)|by federal troops]].\n\nThe Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the [[Federal government of the United States|government of the United States]], nor by that of any foreign country.{{Efn|Although the United Kingdom and France granted it [[Belligerent|belligerent status]].}} The states that remained loyal to the U.S. were known as the Union.{{Efn|Including the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]] where slavery was legal.}} The Union and the Confederacy quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over the course of four years. Intense combat left between 620,000 and 750,000 people dead. The Civil War remains the deadliest military conflict in American history,{{Efn|Assuming Union and Confederate casualties are counted together - more Americans were killed in [[World War II]] than in either the Union or Confederate Armies if their casualty totals are counted separately.}} and accounted for more American military deaths than all other wars combined until around the [[Vietnam War]].{{Efn|At least until approximately the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>{{cite web\n | url =https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/civil-war-facts\n | title =Civil War Facts\n | last =\n | first =\n | date =August 16, 2011\n | website =American Battlefield Trust\n | publisher = American Battlefield Trust\n | access-date = October 7, 2018\n | quote =}}</ref>}}\n\nThe war [[Conclusion of the American Civil War|effectively ended]] April 9, 1865, when General [[Robert E.

The Southern states viewed this as a violation of their constitutional rights, and as the first step in a grander Republican plan to eventually abolish slavery. The three pro-Union candidates together received an overwhelming 82% majority of the votes cast nationally: Republican Lincoln's votes centered in the north, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Stephen A. Douglas]]' votes were distributed nationally and [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Unionist]] [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]]'s votes centered in [[Tennessee]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Virginia]]. The Republican Party, dominant in the North, secured a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the popular votes and a majority of the electoral votes nationally; thus Lincoln was constitutionally elected president. He was the first Republican Party candidate to win the presidency. However, before [[First inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|his inauguration]], seven slave states with [[cotton]]-based economies declared secession and formed the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].

At first, the new states carved out of these territories entering the union were apportioned equally between slave and free states. Pro- and anti-slavery forces collided over the territories west of the Mississippi.{{sfn|Krannawitter|2008|p=49\u201350}}\n\nWith the conquest of northern [[Mexico]] west to [[Alta California|California]] in 1848, slaveholding interests looked forward to expanding into these lands and perhaps Cuba and Central America as well.{{sfn|McPherson|2007|p=14}}{{sfn|Stampp|1990|p=190\u201393}}\nNorthern \"free soil\" interests vigorously sought to curtail any further expansion of slave territory. The [[Compromise of 1850]] over California balanced a free-soil state with stronger fugitive slave laws for a political settlement after four years of strife in the 1840s. But the states admitted following California were all free: Minnesota (1858), Oregon (1859) and Kansas (1861). In the Southern states the question of the territorial expansion of slavery westward again became explosive.{{sfn|McPherson|2007|pp=13\u201314}} Both the South and the North drew the same conclusion: \"The power to decide the question of slavery for the territories was the power to determine the future of slavery itself.\"{{sfn|Bestor|1964|p=19}}{{sfn|McPherson|2007|p=16}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align =\n| direction =\n| width =\n| image1 = Stephen Arnold Douglas.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| caption1 = Sen.

Sectionalism increased steadily between 1800 and 1860 as the North, which phased slavery out of existence, industrialized, urbanized, and built prosperous farms, while the deep South concentrated on plantation agriculture based on slave labor, together with [[subsistence agriculture]] for poor whites. In the 1840s and 1850s, the issue of accepting slavery (in the guise of rejecting slave-owning bishops and missionaries) split the nation's largest religious denominations (the Methodist, Baptist, and Presbyterian churches) into separate Northern and Southern denominations.{{sfn|Ahlstrom|1972|p=648\u2013649}}\n\nHistorians have debated whether economic differences between the mainly industrial North and the mainly agricultural South helped cause the war.

Before Lincoln took office in March 1861, seven slave states had declared their secession and joined to form the Confederacy.\n\nAccording to Lincoln, the American people had shown that they had been successful in ''establishing'' and ''administering'' a republic, but a third challenge faced the nation, ''maintaining'' a republic based on the people's vote against an attempt to overthrow it.<ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=u1xgWBntGYICA|page=1}}|title=A New Birth of Freedom: Abraham Lincoln and the Coming of the Civil War|last=Jaffa|first=Harry V.|date=2004|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=9780847699537|language=en|p=1}} {{dead link|date=November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Outbreak of the war==\n\n===Secession crisis===\nThe election of Lincoln provoked the legislature of South Carolina to call a state convention to consider secession. Prior to the war, South Carolina did more than any other Southern state to advance the notion that a state had the right to [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullify]] federal laws, and even to secede from the United States.

The U.S. Navy eventually gained control of the Red, Tennessee, Cumberland, Mississippi, and Ohio rivers. In the East, the Navy supplied and moved army forces about, and occasionally shelled Confederate installations.\n\n===Modern navy evolves===\n[[File:NavalBattleOfFortPillow.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Clashes on the rivers were melees of [[ironclads]], [[Cottonclad warship|cottonclads]], [[gunboats]] and rams, complicated by torpedoes and [[Fire ship|fire rafts]].]]The Civil War occurred during the early stages of the industrial revolution. Many naval innovations emerged during this time, most notably the advent of the [[ironclad warship]]. It began when the Confederacy, knowing they had to meet or match the Union's naval superiority, responded to the Union blockade by building or converting more than 130 vessels, including twenty-six ironclads and floating batteries.{{sfn|Nelson|2005|p=92}} Only half of these saw active service. Many were equipped with ram bows, creating \"ram fever\" among Union squadrons wherever they threatened. But in the face of overwhelming Union superiority and the Union's ironclad warships, they were unsuccessful.{{sfn|Anderson|1989|p=300}}\n\n[[File:Battle of Hampton Roads 3g01752u.jpg|240px|thumb|left| Battle between the Monitor and Merrimack.]]\n\nIn addition to ocean-going warships coming up the Mississippi, the Union Navy used timberclads, tinclads, and armored gunboats. Shipyards at Cairo, Illinois, and St. Louis built new boats or modified steamboats for action.<ref>Myron J.

On its first foray on March 8, 1862, ''Virginia'' inflicted significant damage to the Union's wooden fleet, but the next day the first Union ironclad, {{USS|Monitor}}, arrived to challenge it in the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. The resulting three hour [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] was a draw, but it proved that ironclads were effective warships.{{sfn|Nelson|2005|p=345}} Not long after the battle the Confederacy was forced to scuttle the ''Virginia'' to prevent its capture, while the Union built many copies of the ''Monitor''.

Public opinion, however, demanded an immediate attack by the army to capture Richmond.{{sfn|Johnson|1998|p=228}}\n\nIn April 1861, Lincoln announced the Union blockade of all Southern ports; commercial ships could not get insurance and regular traffic ended. The South blundered in embargoing cotton exports in 1861 before the blockade was effective; by the time they realized the mistake, it was too late. \"King Cotton\" was dead, as the South could export less than 10 percent of its cotton. The blockade shut down the ten Confederate seaports with railheads that moved almost all the cotton, especially New Orleans, Mobile, and Charleston. By June 1861, warships were stationed off the principal Southern ports, and a year later nearly 300 ships were in service.{{sfn|Anderson|1989|pp=288\u201389, 296\u201398}}\n\n==== Blockade runners ====\n{{Main|Blockade runners of the American Civil War}}\n[[File:First Charleston Harbor.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Gunline of nine Union ironclads.

Many of the ships were designed for speed and were so small that only a small amount of cotton went out.{{sfn|Stern|1962|pp=224\u2013225}} When the Union Navy seized a blockade runner, the ship and cargo were condemned as a [[Prize of war]] and sold, with the proceeds given to the Navy sailors; the captured crewmen were mostly British, and they were released.<ref>Mark E.

There were multiple reasons for this: the severe deterioration of food supplies, especially in cities, the failure of Southern railroads, the loss of control of the main rivers, foraging by Northern armies, and the seizure of animals and crops by Confederate armies.\n\nMost historians agree that the blockade was a major factor in ruining the Confederate economy; however, Wise argues that the blockade runners provided just enough of a lifeline to allow Lee to continue fighting for additional months, thanks to fresh supplies of 400,000 rifles, lead, blankets, and boots that the homefront economy could no longer supply.<ref>Stephen R. Wise, ''Lifeline of the Confederacy: Blockade Running during the Civil War'' (1991)</ref>\n\nSurdam argues that the blockade was a powerful weapon that eventually ruined the Southern economy, at the cost of few lives in combat. Practically, the entire Confederate cotton crop was useless (although it was sold to Union traders), costing the Confederacy its main source of income. Critical imports were scarce and the coastal trade was largely ended as well.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Surdam |first1=David G. |year=1998 |title=The Union Navy's blockade reconsidered |journal=Naval War College Review |volume=51 |issue=4|pages=85\u2013107}}</ref> The measure of the blockade's success was not the few ships that slipped through, but the thousands that never tried it. Merchant ships owned in Europe could not get insurance and were too slow to evade the blockade, so they stopped calling at Confederate ports.<ref>David G. Surdam, ''Northern Naval Superiority and the Economics of the American Civil War'' (University of South Carolina Press, 2001).</ref>\n\nTo fight an offensive war, the Confederacy purchased ships from Britain, converted them to warships, and raided American merchant ships in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Insurance rates skyrocketed and the American flag virtually disappeared from international waters. However, the same ships were reflagged with European flags and continued unmolested.{{sfn|Anderson|1989|p=300}} After the war, the U.S. demanded that Britain pay for the damage done, and Britain paid the U.S. $15&nbsp;million in 1871.{{sfn|Jones|2002|p=225}}\n\n==Diplomacy==\n{{Main|Diplomacy of the American Civil War}}\n\nAlthough the Confederacy hoped that Britain and France would join them against the Union, this was never likely, and so they instead tried to bring Britain and France in as mediators.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=546\u201357}}{{sfn|Herring|2011|p=237}} The Union, under Lincoln and Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] worked to block this, and threatened war if any country officially recognized the existence of the Confederate States of America. In 1861, Southerners voluntarily embargoed cotton shipments, hoping to start an economic depression in Europe that would force Britain to enter the war to get cotton, but this did not work. Worse, Europe developed other cotton suppliers, which they found superior, hindering the South's recovery after the war.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=386}}\n[[File:USS Wissahickon Crewmembers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Crewmembers of {{USS|Wissahickon|1861|6}} by the ship's {{convert|11|in|mm|adj=on}} [[Dahlgren gun]], circa 1863|alt=A group of twenty-six sailors posing around a rifled naval cannon]]\n[[Cotton diplomacy]] proved a failure as Europe had a surplus of cotton, while the 1860\u201362 crop failures in Europe made the North's grain exports of critical importance. It also helped to turn European opinion further away from the Confederacy. It was said that \"King Corn was more powerful than King Cotton\", as U.S. grain went from a quarter of the British import trade to almost half.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=386}} When Britain did face a cotton shortage, it was temporary, being replaced by increased cultivation in Egypt and India. Meanwhile, the war created employment for arms makers, ironworkers, and British ships to transport weapons.<ref name=\"nevins73\" />\n\nLincoln's administration failed to appeal to European public opinion. Diplomats explained that the United States was not committed to the ending of slavery, and instead repeated legalistic arguments about the unconstitutionality of secession. Confederate representatives, on the other hand, were much more successful by ignoring slavery and instead focusing on their struggle for liberty, their commitment to free trade, and the essential role of cotton in the European economy. The European aristocracy was \"absolutely gleeful in pronouncing the American debacle as proof that the entire experiment in popular government had failed. European government leaders welcomed the fragmentation of the ascendant American Republic.\"<ref>Don H.

The Confederacy purchased several warships from commercial shipbuilders in Britain ({{ship|CSS|Alabama}}, {{ship|CSS|Shenandoah}}, {{ship|CSS|Tennessee|1863|6}}, {{ship|CSS|Tallahassee}}, {{ship|CSS|Florida}}, and some others). The most famous, the {{ship|CSS|Alabama}}, did considerable damage and led to serious [[Alabama Claims|postwar disputes]]. However, public opinion against slavery created a political liability for politicians in Britain, where the antislavery movement was powerful.<ref>Richard Huzzeym, ''Freedom Burning: Anti-Slavery and Empire in Victorian Britain'' (2013)</ref>\n\nWar loomed in late 1861 between the U.S. and Britain over the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' affair]], involving the U.S. Navy's boarding of the British ship {{RMS|Trent||2}} and seizure of two Confederate diplomats. However, London and Washington were able to smooth over the problem after Lincoln released the two. In 1862, the British considered mediation between North and South, though even such an offer would have risked war with the United States. British Prime Minister [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] reportedly read ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' three times when deciding on this.<ref name=\"approaching\" />\n\nThe Union victory in the [[Battle of Antietam]] caused them to delay this decision. The [[Emancipation Proclamation]] over time would reinforce the political liability of supporting the Confederacy. Despite sympathy for the Confederacy, France's [[French intervention in Mexico|seizure of Mexico]] ultimately deterred them from war with the Union. Confederate offers late in the war to end slavery in return for diplomatic recognition were not seriously considered by London or Paris. After 1863, the [[January Uprising|Polish revolt against Russia]] further distracted the European powers, and ensured that they would remain neutral.{{sfn|Herring|2011|p=261}}\n\n==Eastern theater==\n[[File:American Civil War Battles by Theater, Year.png|thumb|[[County (United States)|County]] map of Civil War battles by theater and year]]\n\n{{Details|Eastern Theater of the American Civil War}}The Eastern theater refers to the military operations east of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], including the states of [[Virginia]], [[West Virginia]], [[Maryland]], and [[Pennsylvania]], the [[District of Columbia]], and the coastal fortifications and seaports of [[North Carolina]].\n\n=== Background ===\n\n; Army of the Potomac \nMaj. Gen. [[George B. McClellan]] took command of the Union [[Army of the Potomac]] on July 26 (he was briefly general-in-chief of all the Union armies, but was subsequently relieved of that post in favor of Maj. Gen. [[Henry Halleck|Henry W. Halleck]]), and the war began in earnest in 1862. The 1862 Union strategy called for simultaneous advances along four axes:{{sfn|Anderson|1989|p=91}}\n\n# McClellan would lead the main thrust in Virginia towards Richmond.\n# Ohio forces would advance through Kentucky into Tennessee.\n# The Missouri Department would drive south along the Mississippi River.\n# The westernmost attack would originate from Kansas.\n[[File:Robert Edward Lee.jpg|thumb|left|145px|Robert E. Lee]]\n; Army of Northern Virginia\n\nThe primary Confederate force in the Eastern theater was the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. The Army originated as the [[Confederate Army of the Potomac|(Confederate) Army of the Potomac]], which was organized on June 20, 1861, from all operational forces in northern Virginia. On July 20 and 21, the [[Army of the Shenandoah (Confederate)|Army of the Shenandoah]] and forces from the District of Harpers Ferry were added. Units from the [[Army of the Northwest (Confederate)|Army of the Northwest]] were merged into the Army of the Potomac between March 14 and May 17, 1862. The Army of the Potomac was renamed ''Army of Northern Virginia'' on March 14. The [[Army of the Peninsula]] was merged into it on April 12, 1862.\n\nWhen Virginia declared its secession in April 1861, [[Robert E. Lee]] chose to follow his home state, despite his desire for the country to remain intact and an offer of a senior Union command.\n\nLee's biographer, [[Douglas S. Freeman]], asserts that the army received its final name from Lee when he issued orders assuming command on June 1, 1862.<ref>Freeman, Vol. II, p. 78 and footnote 6.</ref> However, Freeman does admit that Lee corresponded with Brigadier General [[Joseph E. Johnston]], his predecessor in army command, prior to that date and referred to Johnston's command as the Army of Northern Virginia. Part of the confusion results from the fact that Johnston commanded the Department of Northern Virginia (as of October 22, 1861) and the name Army of Northern Virginia can be seen as an informal consequence of its parent department's name. Jefferson Davis and Johnston did not adopt the name, but it is clear that the organization of units as of March 14 was the same organization that Lee received on June 1, and thus it is generally referred to today as the Army of Northern Virginia, even if that is correct only in retrospect. [[File:Bayonet-charge-1250.jpg|thumb|Union forces performing a bayonet charge, 1862]]On July 4 at Harper's Ferry, Colonel [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. Jackson]] assigned [[Jeb Stuart]] to command all the cavalry companies of the Army of the Shenandoah. He eventually commanded the Army of Northern Virginia's cavalry.\n\n=== Battles ===\n\n;First Bull Run\n\nIn one of the first highly visible battles, in July 1861, a march by Union troops under the command of [[Major General|Maj. Gen.]] [[Irvin McDowell]] on the Confederate forces led by Gen. [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] near Washington was repulsed at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] (also known as First Manassas). \n[[File:Stonewall Jackson by Routzahn, 1862.png|thumb|left|140px|\"Stonewall\" got his nickname at Bull Run.]]\nThe Union had the upper hand at first, nearly pushing confederate forces holding a defensive position into a rout, but Confederate reinforcements under. Joseph E. Johnston arrived from the [[Shenandoah Valley]] by railroad, and the course of the battle quickly changed. A [[Stonewall Brigade|brigade of Virginians]] under the relatively unknown brigadier general from the [[Virginia Military Institute]], Thomas J. Jackson, stood its ground, which resulted in Jackson receiving his famous nickname, \"Stonewall\".\n\n; McClellan's Peninsula Campaign; Jackson's Valley Campaign\n[[File:George B McClellan - retouched.jpg|thumb|200x200px|George McClellan]]\nUpon the strong urging of President Lincoln to begin offensive operations, McClellan attacked Virginia in the spring of 1862 by way of the [[Virginia Peninsula|peninsula]] between the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] and [[James River]], southeast of Richmond. McClellan's army reached the gates of Richmond in the [[Peninsula Campaign]],{{sfn|Foote|1974|p=464\u2013519}}<ref name=\"terrible\" />{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=424\u201327}}\n\nAlso in the spring of 1862, in the Shenandoah Valley, Stonewall Jackson led his [[Jackson's Valley Campaign|Valley Campaign]]. Employing audacity and rapid, unpredictable movements on interior lines, Jackson's 17,000 men marched 646 miles (1,040&nbsp;km) in 48 days and won several minor battles as they successfully engaged three Union armies (52,000 men), including those of [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] and [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont|John C. Fremont]], preventing them from reinforcing the Union offensive against Richmond. The swiftness of Jackson's men earned them the nickname of \"[[foot cavalry]]\".\n\nJohnston halted McClellan's advance at the [[Battle of Seven Pines]], but he was wounded in the battle, and Robert E. Lee assumed his position of command. General Lee and top subordinates [[James Longstreet]] and Stonewall Jackson defeated McClellan in the [[Seven Days Battles]] and forced his retreat.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=538\u201344}}\n\n;Second Bull Run\nThe [[Northern Virginia Campaign]], which included the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], ended in yet another victory for the South.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=528\u201333}} McClellan resisted General-in-Chief Halleck's orders to send reinforcements to [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope's]] Union [[Army of Virginia]], which made it easier for Lee's Confederates to defeat twice the number of combined enemy troops.\n\n;Antietam\n[[File:Battle of Antietam by Thulstrup.jpg|thumb|240px|The [[Battle of Antietam]], the Civil War's deadliest one-day fight.]]\n\nEmboldened by Second Bull Run, the Confederacy made its first invasion of the North with the [[Maryland Campaign]]. General Lee led 45,000 men of the Army of Northern Virginia across the [[Potomac River]] into Maryland on September 5. Lincoln then restored Pope's troops to McClellan. McClellan and Lee fought at the [[Battle of Antietam]] near [[Sharpsburg, Maryland|Sharpsburg]], Maryland, on September 17, 1862, the bloodiest single day in United States military history.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=538\u201344}}{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=543\u201345}} Lee's army, checked at last, returned to Virginia before McClellan could destroy it.

After Meade's inconclusive fall campaign, Lincoln turned to the Western Theater for new leadership. At the same time, the Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg surrendered, giving the Union control of the Mississippi River, permanently isolating the western Confederacy, and producing the new leader Lincoln needed, [[Ulysses S. Grant]].\n\n; Army of Tennessee \nThe primary Confederate force in the Western theater was the [[Army of Tennessee]]. The army was formed on November 20, 1862, when General [[Braxton Bragg]] renamed the former [[Army of Mississippi]]. While the Confederate forces had numerous successes in the Eastern Theater, they were defeated many times in the West.\n\n=== Battles ===\n;Fort Henry and Fort Donelson\n\nThe Union's key strategist and tactician in the West was Ulysses S. Grant, who won victories at Forts [[Battle of Fort Henry|Henry]] (February 6, 1862) and [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Donelson]] (February 11 to 16, 1862), earning him the nickname of \"Unconditional Surrender\" Grant, by which the Union seized control of the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers. [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] rallied nearly 4,000 Confederate troops and led them to escape across the Cumberland. [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and central [[Tennessee]] thus fell to the Union, leading to attrition of local food supplies and livestock and a breakdown in social organization.\n\n[[Leonidas Polk]]'s invasion of [[Columbus, Kentucky|Columbus]] ended Kentucky's policy of neutrality and turned it against the Confederacy. Grant used river transport and [[Andrew H. Foote|Andrew Foote's]] gunboats of the Western Flotilla to threaten the Confederacy's \"Gibraltar of the West\" at Columbus, Kentucky. Although rebuffed at Belmont, Grant cut off Columbus. The Confederates, lacking their own gunboats, were forced to retreat and the Union took control of western Kentucky and opened Tennessee in March 1862.\n\n[[File:ASJohnston.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Albert Sidney Johnston died at Shiloh.]]\n;Shiloh\nAt [[Battle of Shiloh|the Battle of Shiloh]] (Pittsburg Landing), in Tennessee in April 1862, the Confederates made a surprise attack that pushed Union forces against the river as night fell.

Union Naval activities were dictated by the Anaconda Plan.\n\n=== Battles ===\n;South Carolina\nOne of the earliest battles of the war was fought at [[Battle of Port Royal|Port Royal Sound]], south of Charleston. Much of the war along the South Carolina coast concentrated on capturing [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. In attempting to capture Charleston, the Union military tried two approaches, by land over James or Morris Islands or through the harbor. However, the Confederates were able to drive back each Union attack. One of the most famous of the land attacks was the [[Second Battle of Fort Wagner]], in which the [[54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|54th Massachusetts Infantry]] took part. The Federals suffered a serious defeat in this battle, losing 1,500 men while the Confederates lost only 175.\n\n;Georgia\nFort Pulaski on the Georgia coast was an early target for the Union navy. Following the capture of Port Royal, an expedition was organized with engineer troops under the command of Captain [[Quincy Adams Gillmore|Quincy A. Gillmore]], forcing a Confederate surrender. The Union army occupied the fort for the rest of the war after making repair.\n\n;Louisiana\n[[File:New Orleans h76369k.jpg|220px|thumb| New Orleans captured.]]\nIn April 1862, a Union naval task force commanded by Commander [[David Dixon Porter|David D. Porter]] attacked [[Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip|Forts Jackson and St. Philip]], which guarded the river approach to New Orleans from the south. While part of the fleet bombarded the forts, other vessels forced a break in the obstructions in the river and enabled the rest of the fleet to steam upriver to the city. A Union army force commanded by Major General [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] landed near the forts and forced their surrender. Butler's controversial command of New Orleans earned him the nickname \"Beast\".\n\nThe following year, the Union [[Army of the Gulf]] commanded by Major General Nathaniel P. Banks laid [[Siege of Port Hudson|siege to Port Hudson]] for nearly eight weeks, the longest siege in US military history. The Confederates attempted to defend with the [[Bayou Teche Campaign]], but surrendered after Vicksburg. These two surrenders gave the Union control over the entire Mississippi.\n\n;Florida\nSeveral small skirmishes were fought in Florida, but no major battles. The biggest was the [[Battle of Olustee]] in early 1864.\n\n==Pacific Coast theater==\n{{details|Pacific Coast Theater of the American Civil War}}\nThe Pacific Coast theater refers to military operations on the Pacific Ocean and in the states and Territories west of the Continental Divide.\n\n==Conquest of Virginia==\n[[File:William-Tecumseh-Sherman.jpg|thumb|160px|William Tecumseh Sherman]]\nAt the beginning of 1864, Lincoln made Grant commander of all Union armies. Grant made his headquarters with the Army of the Potomac, and put Maj. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] in command of most of the western armies. Grant understood the concept of [[total war]] and believed, along with Lincoln and Sherman, that only the utter defeat of Confederate forces and their economic base would end the war.<ref name=\"history\" /> This was total war not in killing civilians but rather in taking provisions and forage and destroying homes, farms, and railroads, that Grant said \"would otherwise have gone to the support of secession and rebellion.

The Union army first attempted to maneuver past Lee and fought several battles, notably at the [[Battle of the Wilderness|Wilderness]], [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House|Spotsylvania]], and [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]]. These battles resulted in heavy losses on both sides, and forced Lee's Confederates to fall back repeatedly. At the [[Battle of Yellow Tavern]], the Confederates lost Jeb Stuart.\n\nAn attempt to outflank Lee from the south failed under Butler, who was trapped inside the [[Bermuda Hundred Campaign|Bermuda Hundred]] river bend. Each battle resulted in setbacks for the Union that mirrored what they had suffered under prior generals, though unlike those prior generals, Grant fought on rather than retreat. Grant was tenacious and kept pressing Lee's Army of Northern Virginia back to Richmond. While Lee was preparing for an attack on Richmond, Grant unexpectedly turned south to cross the [[James River]] and began the protracted [[Siege of Petersburg]], where the two armies engaged in [[trench warfare]] for over nine months.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=724\u201342}}\n[[File:Philip Sheridan 1-restored.jpg|thumb|160px|Philip Sheridan]]\n\n=== Sheridan's Valley Campaign ===\nGrant finally found a commander, General Philip Sheridan, aggressive enough to prevail in the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. Sheridan was initially repelled at the [[Battle of New Market]] by former U.S. Vice President and Confederate Gen. [[John C. Breckinridge]]. The Battle of New Market was the Confederacy's last major victory of the war, and included a charge by teenage VMI cadets. After redoubling his efforts, Sheridan defeated Maj. Gen. [[Jubal Early|Jubal A. Early]] in a series of battles, including a final decisive defeat at the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]]. Sheridan then proceeded to destroy the agricultural base of the [[Shenandoah Valley]], a strategy similar to the tactics Sherman later employed in Georgia.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=778\u201379}}\n\n=== Sherman's March to the Sea ===\nMeanwhile, Sherman maneuvered from Chattanooga to Atlanta, defeating Confederate Generals [[Joseph E.

The [[Battle of Atlanta|fall of Atlanta]] on September 2, 1864, guaranteed the reelection of Lincoln as president.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=773\u201376}} Hood left the Atlanta area to swing around and menace Sherman's supply lines and invade Tennessee in the [[Franklin\u2013Nashville Campaign]].

He reached the Atlantic Ocean at [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], Georgia, in December 1864. Sherman's army was followed by thousands of freed slaves; there were no major battles along the March. Sherman turned north through South Carolina and North Carolina to approach the Confederate Virginia lines from the south, increasing the pressure on Lee's army.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=825\u201330}}\n\n=== The Waterloo of the Confederacy ===\nLee's army, thinned by desertion and casualties, was now much smaller than Grant's. One last Confederate attempt to break the Union hold on Petersburg failed at the decisive [[Battle of Five Forks]] (sometimes called \"the [[Waterloo in popular culture#Other|Waterloo]] of the Confederacy\") on April 1. This meant that the Union now controlled the entire perimeter surrounding Richmond-Petersburg, completely cutting it off from the Confederacy. Realizing that the capital was now lost, Lee decided to evacuate his army. The Confederate capital fell to the [[XXV Corps (Union Army)|Union XXV Corps]], composed of black troops.

The North and West grew rich while the once-rich South became poor for a century. The national political power of the slaveowners and rich Southerners ended. Historians are less sure about the results of the postwar Reconstruction, especially regarding the second-class citizenship of the Freedmen and their poverty.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=851}}\n\nHistorians have debated whether the Confederacy could have won the war. Most scholars, including [[James M. McPherson|James McPherson]], argue that Confederate victory was at least possible.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=855}} McPherson argues that the North's advantage in population and resources made Northern victory likely but not guaranteed. He also argues that if the Confederacy had fought using unconventional tactics, they would have more easily been able to hold out long enough to exhaust the Union.<ref name=\"confederacy\" />\n\nConfederates did not need to invade and hold enemy territory to win, but only needed to fight a defensive war to convince the North that the cost of winning was too high. The North needed to conquer and hold vast stretches of enemy territory and defeat Confederate armies to win.<ref name=\"confederacy\" /> Lincoln was not a military dictator, and could continue to fight the war only as long as the American public supported a continuation of the war. The Confederacy sought to win independence by out-lasting Lincoln; however, after Atlanta fell and Lincoln defeated McClellan in the election of 1864, all hope for a political victory for the South ended. At that point, Lincoln had secured the support of the Republicans, War Democrats, the border states, emancipated slaves, and the neutrality of Britain and France. By defeating the Democrats and McClellan, he also defeated the [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]] and their peace platform.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=771\u201372}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center; margin:2em;\"\n|+ Comparison of Union and Confederacy, 1860\u20131864<ref name=\"census74\" />\n!\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Union\n! scope=\"col\" | Confederacy\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|'''Population'''\n|1860\n| 22,100,000 (71%)\n| 9,100,000 (29%)\n|-\n|1864\n| 28,800,000 (90%){{refn|name=UnionPop|group=lower-alpha|\"Union population 1864\" aggregates 1860 population, average annual immigration 1855\u20131864, and population governed formerly by CSA per Kenneth Martis source.

The memory includes the home front, military affairs, the treatment of soldiers, both living and dead, in the war's aftermath, depictions of the war in literature and art, evaluations of heroes and villains, and considerations of the moral and political lessons of the war.<ref name=\"controversy\" /> The last theme includes moral evaluations of [[racism]] and slavery, heroism in combat and heroism behind the lines, and the issues of democracy and minority rights, as well as the notion of an \"[[Empire of Liberty]]\" influencing the world.<ref name=\"american83\" />\n\nProfessional historians have paid much more attention to the causes of the war, than to the war itself. Military history has largely developed outside academia, leading to a proliferation of studies by non-scholars who nevertheless are familiar with the primary sources and pay close attention to battles and campaigns, and who write for the general public, rather than the scholarly community. [[Bruce Catton]] and [[Shelby Foote]] are among the best-known writers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Steven E.

Ritter and Jon L. Wakelyn, eds., ''Leaders of the American Civil War: A Biographical and Historiographical Dictionary'' (1998) Provide short biographies and valuable historiographical summaries</ref> Deeply religious Southerners saw the hand of God in history, which demonstrated His wrath at their sinfulness, or His rewards for their suffering. Historian Wilson Fallin has examined the sermons of white and black [[Baptists|Baptist]] preachers after the War. Southern white preachers said:\n{{quote|God had chastised them and given them a special mission\u2014to maintain orthodoxy, strict biblicism, personal piety, and traditional race relations. Slavery, they insisted, had not been sinful. Rather, emancipation was a historical tragedy and the end of Reconstruction was a clear sign of God's favor.<ref>Wilson Fallin Jr, ''Uplifting the People: Three Centuries of Black Baptists in Alabama'' (2007), pp. 52\u201353.</ref>}}\n\nIn sharp contrast, Black preachers interpreted the Civil War as:\n{{quote|God's gift of freedom. They appreciated opportunities to exercise their independence, to worship in their own way, to affirm their worth and dignity, and to proclaim the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. Most of all, they could form their own churches, associations, and conventions. These institutions offered self-help and racial uplift, and provided places where the gospel of liberation could be proclaimed. As a result, black preachers continued to insist that God would protect and help him; God would be their rock in a stormy land.<ref>Fallin, ''Uplifting the People: Three Centuries of Black Baptists in Alabama'' (2007), pp. 52\u201353.</ref>}}\n\n===Lost Cause===\n{{main|Lost Cause of the Confederacy}}\nMemory of the war in the white South crystallized in the myth of the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|\"Lost Cause\"]]: that the Confederate cause was a just and heroic one. The myth shaped regional identity and race relations for generations.<ref name=\"confederacy84\" /> Alan T. Nolan notes that the Lost Cause was expressly \"a rationalization, a cover-up to vindicate the name and fame\" of those in rebellion. Some claims revolve around the insignificance of slavery; some appeals highlight cultural differences between North and South; the military conflict by Confederate actors is idealized; in any case, secession was said to be lawful.<ref>Nolan, Alan T., in Gallagher, Gary W., and Alan T. Nolan, ''The Myth of the Lost Cause and Civil War history'' (2000), pp. 12\u201319.</ref> Nolan argues that the adoption of the Lost Cause perspective facilitated the reunification of the North and the South while excusing the [[Nadir of American race relations|\"virulent racism\" of the 19th century]], sacrificing African-American progress to a white man's reunification. He also deems the Lost Cause \"a caricature of the truth. This caricature wholly misrepresents and distorts the facts of the matter\" in every instance.<ref>Nolan, ''The Myth of the Lost Cause'', pp. 28\u201329.</ref>\n\n===Beardian historiography===\nThe economic and political-power determinism forcefully presented by [[Charles A. Beard]] and Mary R. Beard in ''The Rise of American Civilization'' (1927) was highly influential among historians and the general public until the [[civil rights movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s. The Beards downplayed slavery, abolitionism, and issues of morality. They ignored constitutional issues of states' rights and even ignored American nationalism as the force that finally led to victory in the war. Indeed, the ferocious combat itself was passed over as merely an ephemeral event. Much more important was the calculus of class conflict. The Beards announced that the Civil War was really:\n\n{{quote|[A] social cataclysm in which the capitalists, laborers, and farmers of the North and West drove from power in the national government the planting aristocracy of the South.<ref>Charles A. Beard and Mary R. Beard, ''The Rise of American Civilization'' (1927), 2:54.</ref>}}\n\nThe Beards themselves abandoned their interpretation by the 1940s and it became defunct among historians in the 1950s, when scholars shifted to an emphasis on slavery. However, Beardian themes still echo among Lost Cause writers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard Hofstadter|title=Progressive Historians|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=iLdMzbv2IDQC|page=459}}|origyear=1968|year=2012|publisher=Knopf Doubleday|page=304|isbn=9780307809605}}</ref>\n\n===Battlefield preservation===\n[[File:Civil War centennial issues.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|Beginning in 1961 the U.S. Post Office released [[Commemorative stamp]]s for five famous battles, each issued on the 100th anniversary of the respective battle.]]\n\nThe first efforts at Civil War battlefield preservation and memorialization came during the war itself with the establishment of National Cemeteries at Gettysburg, Mill Springs and Chattanooga. Soldiers began erecting markers on battlefields beginning with the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] in July 1861, but the oldest surviving monument is the [[Hazen Brigade Monument]] near [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee]], built in the summer of 1863 by soldiers in Union Col. [[William Babcock Hazen|William B.

The [[Shiloh National Military Park]] was established in 1894, followed by the [[Gettysburg National Military Park]] in 1895 and [[Vicksburg National Military Park]] in 1899. In 1933, these five parks and other national monuments were transferred to the jurisdiction of the National Park Service.<ref>Timothy B. Smith, \"The Golden Age of Battlefield Preservation\" (2008; The University of Tennessee Press).</ref>\n\nThe modern Civil War battlefield preservation movement began in 1987 with the founding of the Association for the Preservation of Civil War Sites (APCWS), a grassroots organization created by Civil War historians and others to preserve battlefield land by acquiring it. In 1991, the original Civil War Trust was created in the mold of the Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island Foundation, but failed to attract corporate donors and soon helped manage the disbursement of U.S. Mint Civil War commemorative coin revenues designated for battlefield preservation. Although the two non-profit organizations joined forces on a number of battlefield acquisitions, ongoing conflicts prompted the boards of both organizations to facilitate a merger, which happened in 1999 with the creation of the Civil War Preservation Trust.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/behind-the-bitter-war-to-preserve-the-civil-war-battlefields/2017/07/21/6a1c8dd4-6591-11e7-9928-22d00a47778f_story.html] The Washington Post, July 21, 2007, \"\"Behind the bitter war to preserve Civil War battlefields.\" Accessed May 30, 2018.</ref> In 2011, the organization was renamed, again becoming the [[Civil War Trust]].

This varied advent occurred in greater proportions on the 100th and 150th anniversary.\n<ref name=\"gallagher\" />\n[[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]'s take on the war has been especially influential in shaping public memory, as seen in such film classics as ''[[Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915), ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939), and more recently ''[[Lincoln (film)|Lincoln]]'' (2012).

War broke out in April 1861 when [[Confederate States of America|secessionist]] forces attacked [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]] in [[South Carolina]] shortly after [[Abraham Lincoln]] had been [[First inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|inaugurated]] as the [[President of the United States]]. The loyalists of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in the North, which also included some geographically western and southern states, proclaimed support for the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]]. They faced secessionists of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]] in the South, who advocated for [[states' rights]] in order to uphold slavery.\n\nOf the 34 [[U.S. state]]s in February 1861, seven Southern [[Slave states and free states|slave-holding states\"]] were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country, and the  [[Confederate States of America]] was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government. The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states, and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from [[Government in exile|native secessionists fleeing Union authority]]. These states were given full representation in the [[Confederate States Congress|Confederate Congress]] throughout the Civil War. The two remaining \"slave states\", Delaware and Maryland, were invited to join the Confederacy, but nothing substantial developed due to [[Ex parte Merryman|intervention]] [[Habeas Corpus Suspension Act (1863)|by federal troops]].\n\nThe Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the [[Federal government of the United States|government of the United States]], nor by that of any foreign country.{{Efn|Although the United Kingdom and France granted it [[Belligerent|belligerent status]].}} The states that remained loyal to the U.S. were known as the Union.{{Efn|Including the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]] where slavery was legal.}} The Union and the Confederacy quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over the course of four years. Intense combat left between 620,000 and 750,000 people dead. The Civil War remains the deadliest military conflict in American history,{{Efn|Assuming Union and Confederate casualties are counted together - more Americans were killed in [[World War II]] than in either the Union or Confederate Armies if their casualty totals are counted separately.}} and accounted for more American military deaths than all other wars combined until around the [[Vietnam War]].{{Efn|At least until approximately the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>{{cite web\n | url =https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/civil-war-facts\n | title =Civil War Facts\n | last =\n | first =\n | date =August 16, 2011\n | website =American Battlefield Trust\n | publisher = American Battlefield Trust\n | access-date = October 7, 2018\n | quote =}}</ref>}}\n\nThe war [[Conclusion of the American Civil War|effectively ended]] April 9, 1865, when General [[Robert E.

The Southern states viewed this as a violation of their constitutional rights, and as the first step in a grander Republican plan to eventually abolish slavery. The three pro-Union candidates together received an overwhelming 82% majority of the votes cast nationally: Republican Lincoln's votes centered in the north, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Stephen A. Douglas]]' votes were distributed nationally and [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Unionist]] [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]]'s votes centered in [[Tennessee]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Virginia]]. The Republican Party, dominant in the North, secured a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the popular votes and a majority of the electoral votes nationally; thus Lincoln was constitutionally elected president. He was the first Republican Party candidate to win the presidency. However, before [[First inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|his inauguration]], seven slave states with [[cotton]]-based economies declared secession and formed the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. The first six to declare secession had the highest proportions of slaves in their populations, with an average of 49 percent.<ref>[https://cwemancipation.wordpress.com/2011/04/17/slavery-and-secession-1860-census-statistics/ \"Date of Secession Related to 1860 Black Population\"], America's Civil War</ref> Of those states whose legislatures resolved for secession, the first seven voted with split majorities for unionist candidates Douglas and Bell ([[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] with 51% and [[Louisiana]] with 55%), or with sizable minorities for those unionists ([[Alabama]] with 46%, [[Mississippi]] with 40%, [[Florida]] with 38%, [[Texas]] with 25%, and [[South Carolina]], which cast [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] votes without a popular vote for president).<ref>Burnham, Walter Dean.

Outgoing Democratic President [[James Buchanan]] and the incoming Republicans rejected secession as illegal. [[Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address|Lincoln's March 4, 1861, inaugural address]] declared that his administration would not initiate a [[civil war]]. Speaking directly to the \"Southern States\", he attempted to calm their fears of any threats to slavery, reaffirming, \"I have no purpose, directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the United States where it exists.

The successful 1863 Union [[siege of Vicksburg]] split the Confederacy in two at the [[Mississippi River]]. In 1863, [[Robert E.

Inflicting an ever-tightening [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] of Confederate ports, the Union marshaled the resources and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all directions, leading to the [[fall of Atlanta]] to [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] and [[Sherman's March to the Sea|his march to the sea]]. The last significant battles raged around the [[Siege of Petersburg]]. Lee's escape attempt ended with his [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|surrender at Appomattox Court House]], on April 9, 1865.

At first, the new states carved out of these territories entering the union were apportioned equally between slave and free states. Pro- and anti-slavery forces collided over the territories west of the Mississippi.{{sfn|Krannawitter|2008|p=49\u201350}}\n\nWith the conquest of northern [[Mexico]] west to [[Alta California|California]] in 1848, slaveholding interests looked forward to expanding into these lands and perhaps Cuba and Central America as well.{{sfn|McPherson|2007|p=14}}{{sfn|Stampp|1990|p=190\u201393}}\nNorthern \"free soil\" interests vigorously sought to curtail any further expansion of slave territory. The [[Compromise of 1850]] over California balanced a free-soil state with stronger fugitive slave laws for a political settlement after four years of strife in the 1840s. But the states admitted following California were all free: Minnesota (1858), Oregon (1859) and Kansas (1861). In the Southern states the question of the territorial expansion of slavery westward again became explosive.{{sfn|McPherson|2007|pp=13\u201314}} Both the South and the North drew the same conclusion: \"The power to decide the question of slavery for the territories was the power to determine the future of slavery itself.\"{{sfn|Bestor|1964|p=19}}{{sfn|McPherson|2007|p=16}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align =\n| direction =\n| width =\n| image1 = Stephen Arnold Douglas.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| caption1 = Sen.

Sectionalism increased steadily between 1800 and 1860 as the North, which phased slavery out of existence, industrialized, urbanized, and built prosperous farms, while the deep South concentrated on plantation agriculture based on slave labor, together with [[subsistence agriculture]] for poor whites. In the 1840s and 1850s, the issue of accepting slavery (in the guise of rejecting slave-owning bishops and missionaries) split the nation's largest religious denominations (the Methodist, Baptist, and Presbyterian churches) into separate Northern and Southern denominations.{{sfn|Ahlstrom|1972|p=648\u2013649}}\n\nHistorians have debated whether economic differences between the mainly industrial North and the mainly agricultural South helped cause the war.

Before Lincoln took office in March 1861, seven slave states had declared their secession and joined to form the Confederacy.\n\nAccording to Lincoln, the American people had shown that they had been successful in ''establishing'' and ''administering'' a republic, but a third challenge faced the nation, ''maintaining'' a republic based on the people's vote against an attempt to overthrow it.<ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=u1xgWBntGYICA|page=1}}|title=A New Birth of Freedom: Abraham Lincoln and the Coming of the Civil War|last=Jaffa|first=Harry V.|date=2004|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=9780847699537|language=en|p=1}} {{dead link|date=November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Outbreak of the war==\n\n===Secession crisis===\nThe election of Lincoln provoked the legislature of South Carolina to call a state convention to consider secession.

The convention summoned unanimously voted to secede on December 20, 1860, and adopted the \"[[Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union]]\". It argued for states' rights for slave owners in the South, but contained a complaint about states' rights in the North in the form of opposition to the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]], claiming that Northern states were not fulfilling their federal obligations under the Constitution.

On its first foray on March 8, 1862, ''Virginia'' inflicted significant damage to the Union's wooden fleet, but the next day the first Union ironclad, {{USS|Monitor}}, arrived to challenge it in the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. The resulting three hour [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] was a draw, but it proved that ironclads were effective warships.{{sfn|Nelson|2005|p=345}} Not long after the battle the Confederacy was forced to scuttle the ''Virginia'' to prevent its capture, while the Union built many copies of the ''Monitor''.

Public opinion, however, demanded an immediate attack by the army to capture Richmond.{{sfn|Johnson|1998|p=228}}\n\nIn April 1861, Lincoln announced the Union blockade of all Southern ports; commercial ships could not get insurance and regular traffic ended. The South blundered in embargoing cotton exports in 1861 before the blockade was effective; by the time they realized the mistake, it was too late. \"King Cotton\" was dead, as the South could export less than 10 percent of its cotton. The blockade shut down the ten Confederate seaports with railheads that moved almost all the cotton, especially New Orleans, Mobile, and Charleston. By June 1861, warships were stationed off the principal Southern ports, and a year later nearly 300 ships were in service.{{sfn|Anderson|1989|pp=288\u201389, 296\u201398}}\n\n==== Blockade runners ====\n{{Main|Blockade runners of the American Civil War}}\n[[File:First Charleston Harbor.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Gunline of nine Union ironclads.

Many of the ships were designed for speed and were so small that only a small amount of cotton went out.{{sfn|Stern|1962|pp=224\u2013225}} When the Union Navy seized a blockade runner, the ship and cargo were condemned as a [[Prize of war]] and sold, with the proceeds given to the Navy sailors; the captured crewmen were mostly British, and they were released.<ref>Mark E.

There were multiple reasons for this: the severe deterioration of food supplies, especially in cities, the failure of Southern railroads, the loss of control of the main rivers, foraging by Northern armies, and the seizure of animals and crops by Confederate armies.\n\nMost historians agree that the blockade was a major factor in ruining the Confederate economy; however, Wise argues that the blockade runners provided just enough of a lifeline to allow Lee to continue fighting for additional months, thanks to fresh supplies of 400,000 rifles, lead, blankets, and boots that the homefront economy could no longer supply.<ref>Stephen R. Wise, ''Lifeline of the Confederacy: Blockade Running during the Civil War'' (1991)</ref>\n\nSurdam argues that the blockade was a powerful weapon that eventually ruined the Southern economy, at the cost of few lives in combat. Practically, the entire Confederate cotton crop was useless (although it was sold to Union traders), costing the Confederacy its main source of income. Critical imports were scarce and the coastal trade was largely ended as well.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Surdam |first1=David G. |year=1998 |title=The Union Navy's blockade reconsidered |journal=Naval War College Review |volume=51 |issue=4|pages=85\u2013107}}</ref> The measure of the blockade's success was not the few ships that slipped through, but the thousands that never tried it. Merchant ships owned in Europe could not get insurance and were too slow to evade the blockade, so they stopped calling at Confederate ports.<ref>David G. Surdam, ''Northern Naval Superiority and the Economics of the American Civil War'' (University of South Carolina Press, 2001).</ref>\n\nTo fight an offensive war, the Confederacy purchased ships from Britain, converted them to warships, and raided American merchant ships in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Insurance rates skyrocketed and the American flag virtually disappeared from international waters. However, the same ships were reflagged with European flags and continued unmolested.{{sfn|Anderson|1989|p=300}} After the war, the U.S. demanded that Britain pay for the damage done, and Britain paid the U.S. $15&nbsp;million in 1871.{{sfn|Jones|2002|p=225}}\n\n==Diplomacy==\n{{Main|Diplomacy of the American Civil War}}\n\nAlthough the Confederacy hoped that Britain and France would join them against the Union, this was never likely, and so they instead tried to bring Britain and France in as mediators.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=546\u201357}}{{sfn|Herring|2011|p=237}} The Union, under Lincoln and Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] worked to block this, and threatened war if any country officially recognized the existence of the Confederate States of America. In 1861, Southerners voluntarily embargoed cotton shipments, hoping to start an economic depression in Europe that would force Britain to enter the war to get cotton, but this did not work. Worse, Europe developed other cotton suppliers, which they found superior, hindering the South's recovery after the war.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=386}}\n[[File:USS Wissahickon Crewmembers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Crewmembers of {{USS|Wissahickon|1861|6}} by the ship's {{convert|11|in|mm|adj=on}} [[Dahlgren gun]], circa 1863|alt=A group of twenty-six sailors posing around a rifled naval cannon]]\n[[Cotton diplomacy]] proved a failure as Europe had a surplus of cotton, while the 1860\u201362 crop failures in Europe made the North's grain exports of critical importance. It also helped to turn European opinion further away from the Confederacy. It was said that \"King Corn was more powerful than King Cotton\", as U.S. grain went from a quarter of the British import trade to almost half.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=386}} When Britain did face a cotton shortage, it was temporary, being replaced by increased cultivation in Egypt and India. Meanwhile, the war created employment for arms makers, ironworkers, and British ships to transport weapons.<ref name=\"nevins73\" />\n\nLincoln's administration failed to appeal to European public opinion. Diplomats explained that the United States was not committed to the ending of slavery, and instead repeated legalistic arguments about the unconstitutionality of secession. Confederate representatives, on the other hand, were much more successful by ignoring slavery and instead focusing on their struggle for liberty, their commitment to free trade, and the essential role of cotton in the European economy. The European aristocracy was \"absolutely gleeful in pronouncing the American debacle as proof that the entire experiment in popular government had failed. European government leaders welcomed the fragmentation of the ascendant American Republic.\"<ref>Don H.

The Confederacy purchased several warships from commercial shipbuilders in Britain ({{ship|CSS|Alabama}}, {{ship|CSS|Shenandoah}}, {{ship|CSS|Tennessee|1863|6}}, {{ship|CSS|Tallahassee}}, {{ship|CSS|Florida}}, and some others). The most famous, the {{ship|CSS|Alabama}}, did considerable damage and led to serious [[Alabama Claims|postwar disputes]]. However, public opinion against slavery created a political liability for politicians in Britain, where the antislavery movement was powerful.<ref>Richard Huzzeym, ''Freedom Burning: Anti-Slavery and Empire in Victorian Britain'' (2013)</ref>\n\nWar loomed in late 1861 between the U.S. and Britain over the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' affair]], involving the U.S. Navy's boarding of the British ship {{RMS|Trent||2}} and seizure of two Confederate diplomats. However, London and Washington were able to smooth over the problem after Lincoln released the two. In 1862, the British considered mediation between North and South, though even such an offer would have risked war with the United States. British Prime Minister [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] reportedly read ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' three times when deciding on this.<ref name=\"approaching\" />\n\nThe Union victory in the [[Battle of Antietam]] caused them to delay this decision. The [[Emancipation Proclamation]] over time would reinforce the political liability of supporting the Confederacy. Despite sympathy for the Confederacy, France's [[French intervention in Mexico|seizure of Mexico]] ultimately deterred them from war with the Union. Confederate offers late in the war to end slavery in return for diplomatic recognition were not seriously considered by London or Paris. After 1863, the [[January Uprising|Polish revolt against Russia]] further distracted the European powers, and ensured that they would remain neutral.{{sfn|Herring|2011|p=261}}\n\n==Eastern theater==\n[[File:American Civil War Battles by Theater, Year.png|thumb|[[County (United States)|County]] map of Civil War battles by theater and year]]\n\n{{Details|Eastern Theater of the American Civil War}}The Eastern theater refers to the military operations east of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], including the states of [[Virginia]], [[West Virginia]], [[Maryland]], and [[Pennsylvania]], the [[District of Columbia]], and the coastal fortifications and seaports of [[North Carolina]].\n\n=== Background ===\n\n; Army of the Potomac \nMaj. Gen. [[George B. McClellan]] took command of the Union [[Army of the Potomac]] on July 26 (he was briefly general-in-chief of all the Union armies, but was subsequently relieved of that post in favor of Maj. Gen. [[Henry Halleck|Henry W. Halleck]]), and the war began in earnest in 1862. The 1862 Union strategy called for simultaneous advances along four axes:{{sfn|Anderson|1989|p=91}}\n\n# McClellan would lead the main thrust in Virginia towards Richmond.\n# Ohio forces would advance through Kentucky into Tennessee.\n# The Missouri Department would drive south along the Mississippi River.\n# The westernmost attack would originate from Kansas.\n[[File:Robert Edward Lee.jpg|thumb|left|145px|Robert E. Lee]]\n; Army of Northern Virginia\n\nThe primary Confederate force in the Eastern theater was the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. The Army originated as the [[Confederate Army of the Potomac|(Confederate) Army of the Potomac]], which was organized on June 20, 1861, from all operational forces in northern Virginia. On July 20 and 21, the [[Army of the Shenandoah (Confederate)|Army of the Shenandoah]] and forces from the District of Harpers Ferry were added. Units from the [[Army of the Northwest (Confederate)|Army of the Northwest]] were merged into the Army of the Potomac between March 14 and May 17, 1862. The Army of the Potomac was renamed ''Army of Northern Virginia'' on March 14. The [[Army of the Peninsula]] was merged into it on April 12, 1862.\n\nWhen Virginia declared its secession in April 1861, [[Robert E. Lee]] chose to follow his home state, despite his desire for the country to remain intact and an offer of a senior Union command.\n\nLee's biographer, [[Douglas S. Freeman]], asserts that the army received its final name from Lee when he issued orders assuming command on June 1, 1862.<ref>Freeman, Vol. II, p. 78 and footnote 6.</ref> However, Freeman does admit that Lee corresponded with Brigadier General [[Joseph E. Johnston]], his predecessor in army command, prior to that date and referred to Johnston's command as the Army of Northern Virginia. Part of the confusion results from the fact that Johnston commanded the Department of Northern Virginia (as of October 22, 1861) and the name Army of Northern Virginia can be seen as an informal consequence of its parent department's name. Jefferson Davis and Johnston did not adopt the name, but it is clear that the organization of units as of March 14 was the same organization that Lee received on June 1, and thus it is generally referred to today as the Army of Northern Virginia, even if that is correct only in retrospect. [[File:Bayonet-charge-1250.jpg|thumb|Union forces performing a bayonet charge, 1862]]On July 4 at Harper's Ferry, Colonel [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. Jackson]] assigned [[Jeb Stuart]] to command all the cavalry companies of the Army of the Shenandoah. He eventually commanded the Army of Northern Virginia's cavalry.\n\n=== Battles ===\n\n;First Bull Run\n\nIn one of the first highly visible battles, in July 1861, a march by Union troops under the command of [[Major General|Maj. Gen.]] [[Irvin McDowell]] on the Confederate forces led by Gen. [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] near Washington was repulsed at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] (also known as First Manassas). \n[[File:Stonewall Jackson by Routzahn, 1862.png|thumb|left|140px|\"Stonewall\" got his nickname at Bull Run.]]\nThe Union had the upper hand at first, nearly pushing confederate forces holding a defensive position into a rout, but Confederate reinforcements under. Joseph E. Johnston arrived from the [[Shenandoah Valley]] by railroad, and the course of the battle quickly changed. A [[Stonewall Brigade|brigade of Virginians]] under the relatively unknown brigadier general from the [[Virginia Military Institute]], Thomas J. Jackson, stood its ground, which resulted in Jackson receiving his famous nickname, \"Stonewall\".\n\n; McClellan's Peninsula Campaign; Jackson's Valley Campaign\n[[File:George B McClellan - retouched.jpg|thumb|200x200px|George McClellan]]\nUpon the strong urging of President Lincoln to begin offensive operations, McClellan attacked Virginia in the spring of 1862 by way of the [[Virginia Peninsula|peninsula]] between the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] and [[James River]], southeast of Richmond. McClellan's army reached the gates of Richmond in the [[Peninsula Campaign]],{{sfn|Foote|1974|p=464\u2013519}}<ref name=\"terrible\" />{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=424\u201327}}\n\nAlso in the spring of 1862, in the Shenandoah Valley, Stonewall Jackson led his [[Jackson's Valley Campaign|Valley Campaign]]. Employing audacity and rapid, unpredictable movements on interior lines, Jackson's 17,000 men marched 646 miles (1,040&nbsp;km) in 48 days and won several minor battles as they successfully engaged three Union armies (52,000 men), including those of [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] and [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont|John C. Fremont]], preventing them from reinforcing the Union offensive against Richmond. The swiftness of Jackson's men earned them the nickname of \"[[foot cavalry]]\".\n\nJohnston halted McClellan's advance at the [[Battle of Seven Pines]], but he was wounded in the battle, and Robert E. Lee assumed his position of command. General Lee and top subordinates [[James Longstreet]] and Stonewall Jackson defeated McClellan in the [[Seven Days Battles]] and forced his retreat.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=538\u201344}}\n\n;Second Bull Run\nThe [[Northern Virginia Campaign]], which included the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], ended in yet another victory for the South.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=528\u201333}} McClellan resisted General-in-Chief Halleck's orders to send reinforcements to [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope's]] Union [[Army of Virginia]], which made it easier for Lee's Confederates to defeat twice the number of combined enemy troops.\n\n;Antietam\n[[File:Battle of Antietam by Thulstrup.jpg|thumb|240px|The [[Battle of Antietam]], the Civil War's deadliest one-day fight.]]\n\nEmboldened by Second Bull Run, the Confederacy made its first invasion of the North with the [[Maryland Campaign]]. General Lee led 45,000 men of the Army of Northern Virginia across the [[Potomac River]] into Maryland on September 5. Lincoln then restored Pope's troops to McClellan. McClellan and Lee fought at the [[Battle of Antietam]] near [[Sharpsburg, Maryland|Sharpsburg]], Maryland, on September 17, 1862, the bloodiest single day in United States military history.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=538\u201344}}{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=543\u201345}} Lee's army, checked at last, returned to Virginia before McClellan could destroy it.

That same day, [[John Sedgwick]] advanced across the [[Rappahannock River]], defeated the small Confederate force at Marye's Heights in the [[Second Battle of Fredericksburg]], and then moved to the west.

After Meade's inconclusive fall campaign, Lincoln turned to the Western Theater for new leadership. At the same time, the Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg surrendered, giving the Union control of the Mississippi River, permanently isolating the western Confederacy, and producing the new leader Lincoln needed, [[Ulysses S. Grant]].\n\n; Army of Tennessee \nThe primary Confederate force in the Western theater was the [[Army of Tennessee]]. The army was formed on November 20, 1862, when General [[Braxton Bragg]] renamed the former [[Army of Mississippi]]. While the Confederate forces had numerous successes in the Eastern Theater, they were defeated many times in the West.\n\n=== Battles ===\n;Fort Henry and Fort Donelson\n\nThe Union's key strategist and tactician in the West was Ulysses S. Grant, who won victories at Forts [[Battle of Fort Henry|Henry]] (February 6, 1862) and [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Donelson]] (February 11 to 16, 1862), earning him the nickname of \"Unconditional Surrender\" Grant, by which the Union seized control of the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers. [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] rallied nearly 4,000 Confederate troops and led them to escape across the Cumberland. [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and central [[Tennessee]] thus fell to the Union, leading to attrition of local food supplies and livestock and a breakdown in social organization.\n\n[[Leonidas Polk]]'s invasion of [[Columbus, Kentucky|Columbus]] ended Kentucky's policy of neutrality and turned it against the Confederacy. Grant used river transport and [[Andrew H. Foote|Andrew Foote's]] gunboats of the Western Flotilla to threaten the Confederacy's \"Gibraltar of the West\" at Columbus, Kentucky. Although rebuffed at Belmont, Grant cut off Columbus. The Confederates, lacking their own gunboats, were forced to retreat and the Union took control of western Kentucky and opened Tennessee in March 1862.\n\n[[File:ASJohnston.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Albert Sidney Johnston died at Shiloh.]]\n;Shiloh\nAt [[Battle of Shiloh|the Battle of Shiloh]] (Pittsburg Landing), in Tennessee in April 1862, the Confederates made a surprise attack that pushed Union forces against the river as night fell.

The [[Battle of Glorieta Pass]] was the decisive [[battle]] of the [[New Mexico Campaign]]. The Union repulsed Confederate incursions into New Mexico in 1862, and the exiled Arizona government withdrew into Texas. In the Indian Territory, civil war broke out within tribes.

Although he lacked resources to beat Union armies, he built up a formidable arsenal at Tyler, along with his own Kirby Smithdom economy, a virtual \"independent fiefdom\" in Texas, including railroad construction and international smuggling. The Union in turn did not directly engage him.{{sfn|Keegan|2009|p=220\u201321}} Its 1864 [[Red River Campaign]] to take Shreveport, Louisiana, was a failure and Texas remained in Confederate hands throughout the war.\n\n== Lower Seaboard theater ==\n{{details|Lower Seaboard Theater of the American Civil War}}\n\n=== Background ===\nThe Lower Seaboard theater refers to military and naval operations that occurred near the coastal areas of the Southeast (Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas) as well as southern part of the Mississippi River (Port Hudson and south). Union Naval activities were dictated by the Anaconda Plan.\n\n=== Battles ===\n;South Carolina\nOne of the earliest battles of the war was fought at [[Battle of Port Royal|Port Royal Sound]], south of Charleston. Much of the war along the South Carolina coast concentrated on capturing [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. In attempting to capture Charleston, the Union military tried two approaches, by land over James or Morris Islands or through the harbor. However, the Confederates were able to drive back each Union attack. One of the most famous of the land attacks was the [[Second Battle of Fort Wagner]], in which the [[54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|54th Massachusetts Infantry]] took part. The Federals suffered a serious defeat in this battle, losing 1,500 men while the Confederates lost only 175.\n\n;Georgia\nFort Pulaski on the Georgia coast was an early target for the Union navy. Following the capture of Port Royal, an expedition was organized with engineer troops under the command of Captain [[Quincy Adams Gillmore|Quincy A. Gillmore]], forcing a Confederate surrender. The Union army occupied the fort for the rest of the war after making repair.\n\n;Louisiana\n[[File:New Orleans h76369k.jpg|220px|thumb| New Orleans captured.]]\nIn April 1862, a Union naval task force commanded by Commander [[David Dixon Porter|David D. Porter]] attacked [[Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip|Forts Jackson and St. Philip]], which guarded the river approach to New Orleans from the south. While part of the fleet bombarded the forts, other vessels forced a break in the obstructions in the river and enabled the rest of the fleet to steam upriver to the city. A Union army force commanded by Major General [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] landed near the forts and forced their surrender. Butler's controversial command of New Orleans earned him the nickname \"Beast\".\n\nThe following year, the Union [[Army of the Gulf]] commanded by Major General Nathaniel P. Banks laid [[Siege of Port Hudson|siege to Port Hudson]] for nearly eight weeks, the longest siege in US military history. The Confederates attempted to defend with the [[Bayou Teche Campaign]], but surrendered after Vicksburg. These two surrenders gave the Union control over the entire Mississippi.\n\n;Florida\nSeveral small skirmishes were fought in Florida, but no major battles. The biggest was the [[Battle of Olustee]] in early 1864.\n\n==Pacific Coast theater==\n{{details|Pacific Coast Theater of the American Civil War}}\nThe Pacific Coast theater refers to military operations on the Pacific Ocean and in the states and Territories west of the Continental Divide.\n\n==Conquest of Virginia==\n[[File:William-Tecumseh-Sherman.jpg|thumb|160px|William Tecumseh Sherman]]\nAt the beginning of 1864, Lincoln made Grant commander of all Union armies. Grant made his headquarters with the Army of the Potomac, and put Maj. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] in command of most of the western armies. Grant understood the concept of [[total war]] and believed, along with Lincoln and Sherman, that only the utter defeat of Confederate forces and their economic base would end the war.<ref name=\"history\" /> This was total war not in killing civilians but rather in taking provisions and forage and destroying homes, farms, and railroads, that Grant said \"would otherwise have gone to the support of secession and rebellion.

The Union army first attempted to maneuver past Lee and fought several battles, notably at the [[Battle of the Wilderness|Wilderness]], [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House|Spotsylvania]], and [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]]. These battles resulted in heavy losses on both sides, and forced Lee's Confederates to fall back repeatedly. At the [[Battle of Yellow Tavern]], the Confederates lost Jeb Stuart.\n\nAn attempt to outflank Lee from the south failed under Butler, who was trapped inside the [[Bermuda Hundred Campaign|Bermuda Hundred]] river bend. Each battle resulted in setbacks for the Union that mirrored what they had suffered under prior generals, though unlike those prior generals, Grant fought on rather than retreat. Grant was tenacious and kept pressing Lee's Army of Northern Virginia back to Richmond. While Lee was preparing for an attack on Richmond, Grant unexpectedly turned south to cross the [[James River]] and began the protracted [[Siege of Petersburg]], where the two armies engaged in [[trench warfare]] for over nine months.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=724\u201342}}\n[[File:Philip Sheridan 1-restored.jpg|thumb|160px|Philip Sheridan]]\n\n=== Sheridan's Valley Campaign ===\nGrant finally found a commander, General Philip Sheridan, aggressive enough to prevail in the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. Sheridan was initially repelled at the [[Battle of New Market]] by former U.S. Vice President and Confederate Gen. [[John C. Breckinridge]]. The Battle of New Market was the Confederacy's last major victory of the war, and included a charge by teenage VMI cadets. After redoubling his efforts, Sheridan defeated Maj. Gen. [[Jubal Early|Jubal A. Early]] in a series of battles, including a final decisive defeat at the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]]. Sheridan then proceeded to destroy the agricultural base of the [[Shenandoah Valley]], a strategy similar to the tactics Sherman later employed in Georgia.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=778\u201379}}\n\n=== Sherman's March to the Sea ===\nMeanwhile, Sherman maneuvered from Chattanooga to Atlanta, defeating Confederate Generals [[Joseph E. Johnston]] and [[John Bell Hood]] along the way. The [[Battle of Atlanta|fall of Atlanta]] on September 2, 1864, guaranteed the reelection of Lincoln as president.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=773\u201376}} Hood left the Atlanta area to swing around and menace Sherman's supply lines and invade Tennessee in the [[Franklin\u2013Nashville Campaign]]. Union Maj. Gen. [[John Schofield]] defeated Hood at the [[Battle of Franklin (1864)|Battle of Franklin]], and [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas]] dealt Hood a massive defeat at the [[Battle of Nashville]], effectively destroying Hood's army.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=812\u201315}}[[File:The Peacemakers 1868.jpg|thumb|''[[The Peacemakers]]'' by [[George Peter Alexander Healy]] portrays [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman]], [[Ulysses S.

He reached the Atlantic Ocean at [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], Georgia, in December 1864. Sherman's army was followed by thousands of freed slaves; there were no major battles along the March. Sherman turned north through South Carolina and North Carolina to approach the Confederate Virginia lines from the south, increasing the pressure on Lee's army.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=825\u201330}}\n\n=== The Waterloo of the Confederacy ===\nLee's army, thinned by desertion and casualties, was now much smaller than Grant's. One last Confederate attempt to break the Union hold on Petersburg failed at the decisive [[Battle of Five Forks]] (sometimes called \"the [[Waterloo in popular culture#Other|Waterloo]] of the Confederacy\") on April 1. This meant that the Union now controlled the entire perimeter surrounding Richmond-Petersburg, completely cutting it off from the Confederacy. Realizing that the capital was now lost, Lee decided to evacuate his army. The Confederate capital fell to the [[XXV Corps (Union Army)|Union XXV Corps]], composed of black troops. The remaining Confederate units fled west after a defeat at [[Battle of Sayler's Creek|Sayler's Creek]].{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=846\u201347}}\n\n==Confederacy surrenders==\n{{Main|Conclusion of the American Civil War}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| total_width =400\n\n| image1    = 18650410 Surrender of General Lee and His Whole Army - The New York Times.png\n| alt1      = \n| width1    = \n| caption1  = This ''New York Times'' front page celebrated Lee's surrender, headlining how Grant let Confederate officers retain their sidearms and \"paroled\" the Confederate officers and men.<ref name=NYTimes_18650410>{{cite news |title=Union / Victory! / Peace! / Surrender of General Lee and His Whole Army. |url=https://newspaperarchive.com/new-york-times-apr-10-1865-p-1/ |work=The New York Times |date=April 10, 1865 |page=1 }}</ref>\n\n| image2    = 18650416 Lee Has Surrendered to Grant - Savannah Daily Herald.png\n| caption2  = News of Lee's April 9 surrender reached this southern newspaper (Savannah, Georgia) on April 15\u2014after the April 14 shooting of President Lincoln.<ref name=SavannahDailyHerald_18650416/> The article quotes Grant's terms of surrender.<ref name=SavannahDailyHerald_18650416>{{cite news |title=Most Glorious News of the War / Lee Has Surrendered to Grant ! / All Lee's Officers and Men Are Paroled |url=https://newspaperarchive.com/savannah-daily-herald-apr-16-1865-p-1/ |work=Savannah Daily Herald |date=April 16, 1865 |location=Savannah, Georgia, U.S. |pages=1, 4}}</ref>\n}}\nInitially, Lee did not intend to surrender, but planned to regroup at the [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|village of Appomattox Court House]], where supplies were to be waiting, and then continue the war. Grant chased Lee and got in front of him, so that when Lee's army reached Appomattox Court House, they were surrounded. After an initial battle, Lee decided that the fight was now hopeless, and surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, at the [[McLean House (Appomattox, Virginia)|McLean House]].<ref name=\"appomattox\" /> In an untraditional gesture and as a sign of Grant's respect and anticipation of peacefully restoring Confederate states to the Union, Lee was permitted to keep his sword and his horse, [[Traveller (horse)|Traveller]].\n\nOn April 14, 1865, President Lincoln was [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|shot]] by [[John Wilkes Booth]], a Southern sympathizer.

The North and West grew rich while the once-rich South became poor for a century. The national political power of the slaveowners and rich Southerners ended. Historians are less sure about the results of the postwar Reconstruction, especially regarding the second-class citizenship of the Freedmen and their poverty.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=851}}\n\nHistorians have debated whether the Confederacy could have won the war. Most scholars, including [[James M. McPherson|James McPherson]], argue that Confederate victory was at least possible.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=855}} McPherson argues that the North's advantage in population and resources made Northern victory likely but not guaranteed. He also argues that if the Confederacy had fought using unconventional tactics, they would have more easily been able to hold out long enough to exhaust the Union.<ref name=\"confederacy\" />\n\nConfederates did not need to invade and hold enemy territory to win, but only needed to fight a defensive war to convince the North that the cost of winning was too high. The North needed to conquer and hold vast stretches of enemy territory and defeat Confederate armies to win.<ref name=\"confederacy\" /> Lincoln was not a military dictator, and could continue to fight the war only as long as the American public supported a continuation of the war. The Confederacy sought to win independence by out-lasting Lincoln; however, after Atlanta fell and Lincoln defeated McClellan in the election of 1864, all hope for a political victory for the South ended. At that point, Lincoln had secured the support of the Republicans, War Democrats, the border states, emancipated slaves, and the neutrality of Britain and France. By defeating the Democrats and McClellan, he also defeated the [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]] and their peace platform.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=771\u201372}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center; margin:2em;\"\n|+ Comparison of Union and Confederacy, 1860\u20131864<ref name=\"census74\" />\n!\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Union\n! scope=\"col\" | Confederacy\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|'''Population'''\n|1860\n| 22,100,000 (71%)\n| 9,100,000 (29%)\n|-\n|1864\n| 28,800,000 (90%){{refn|name=UnionPop|group=lower-alpha|\"Union population 1864\" aggregates 1860 population, average annual immigration 1855\u20131864, and population governed formerly by CSA per Kenneth Martis source.

The Emancipation Proclamation was an effective use of the President's war powers.<ref name=\"WarLeader\" /> The Confederate government failed in its attempt to get Europe involved in the war militarily, particularly Britain and France. Southern leaders needed to get European powers to help break up the blockade the Union had created around the Southern ports and cities. Lincoln's naval blockade was 95 percent effective at stopping trade goods; as a result, imports and exports to the South declined significantly. The abundance of European cotton and Britain's hostility to the institution of slavery, along with Lincoln's Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico naval blockades, severely decreased any chance that either Britain or France would enter the war.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=382\u201388}}\n\nHistorian Don Doyle has argued that the Union victory had a major impact on the course of world history.<ref>Don H.

See Catton, Bruce. ''Never Call Retreat'', p.&nbsp;335. The American Missionary Association entered the war effort by sending teachers south to such contraband camps, for instance establishing schools in Norfolk and on nearby plantations. In addition, approximately 180,000 or more African-American men served as soldiers and sailors with Union troops. Most of those were escaped slaves. Probably the most prominent of these African-American soldiers is the [[54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry]].}} About 190,000 volunteered, further enhancing the numerical advantage the Union armies enjoyed over the Confederates, who did not dare emulate the equivalent manpower source for fear of fundamentally undermining the legitimacy of slavery.{{refn|name=SlavesinConfedArmy|group=lower-alpha|In spite of the South's shortage of soldiers, most Southern leaders\u2014until 1865\u2014opposed enlisting slaves.

Some claims revolve around the insignificance of slavery; some appeals highlight cultural differences between North and South; the military conflict by Confederate actors is idealized; in any case, secession was said to be lawful.<ref>Nolan, Alan T., in Gallagher, Gary W., and Alan T. Nolan, ''The Myth of the Lost Cause and Civil War history'' (2000), pp. 12\u201319.</ref> Nolan argues that the adoption of the Lost Cause perspective facilitated the reunification of the North and the South while excusing the [[Nadir of American race relations|\"virulent racism\" of the 19th century]], sacrificing African-American progress to a white man's reunification. He also deems the Lost Cause \"a caricature of the truth. This caricature wholly misrepresents and distorts the facts of the matter\" in every instance.<ref>Nolan, ''The Myth of the Lost Cause'', pp. 28\u201329.</ref>\n\n===Beardian historiography===\nThe economic and political-power determinism forcefully presented by [[Charles A. Beard]] and Mary R. Beard in ''The Rise of American Civilization'' (1927) was highly influential among historians and the general public until the [[civil rights movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s. The Beards downplayed slavery, abolitionism, and issues of morality. They ignored constitutional issues of states' rights and even ignored American nationalism as the force that finally led to victory in the war. Indeed, the ferocious combat itself was passed over as merely an ephemeral event. Much more important was the calculus of class conflict. The Beards announced that the Civil War was really:\n\n{{quote|[A] social cataclysm in which the capitalists, laborers, and farmers of the North and West drove from power in the national government the planting aristocracy of the South.<ref>Charles A. Beard and Mary R. Beard, ''The Rise of American Civilization'' (1927), 2:54.</ref>}}\n\nThe Beards themselves abandoned their interpretation by the 1940s and it became defunct among historians in the 1950s, when scholars shifted to an emphasis on slavery. However, Beardian themes still echo among Lost Cause writers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard Hofstadter|title=Progressive Historians|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=iLdMzbv2IDQC|page=459}}|origyear=1968|year=2012|publisher=Knopf Doubleday|page=304|isbn=9780307809605}}</ref>\n\n===Battlefield preservation===\n[[File:Civil War centennial issues.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|Beginning in 1961 the U.S. Post Office released [[Commemorative stamp]]s for five famous battles, each issued on the 100th anniversary of the respective battle.]]\n\nThe first efforts at Civil War battlefield preservation and memorialization came during the war itself with the establishment of National Cemeteries at Gettysburg, Mill Springs and Chattanooga. Soldiers began erecting markers on battlefields beginning with the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] in July 1861, but the oldest surviving monument is the [[Hazen Brigade Monument]] near [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee]], built in the summer of 1863 by soldiers in Union Col.

The [[Shiloh National Military Park]] was established in 1894, followed by the [[Gettysburg National Military Park]] in 1895 and [[Vicksburg National Military Park]] in 1899. In 1933, these five parks and other national monuments were transferred to the jurisdiction of the National Park Service.<ref>Timothy B. Smith, \"The Golden Age of Battlefield Preservation\" (2008; The University of Tennessee Press).</ref>\n\nThe modern Civil War battlefield preservation movement began in 1987 with the founding of the Association for the Preservation of Civil War Sites (APCWS), a grassroots organization created by Civil War historians and others to preserve battlefield land by acquiring it. In 1991, the original Civil War Trust was created in the mold of the Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island Foundation, but failed to attract corporate donors and soon helped manage the disbursement of U.S. Mint Civil War commemorative coin revenues designated for battlefield preservation. Although the two non-profit organizations joined forces on a number of battlefield acquisitions, ongoing conflicts prompted the boards of both organizations to facilitate a merger, which happened in 1999 with the creation of the Civil War Preservation Trust.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/behind-the-bitter-war-to-preserve-the-civil-war-battlefields/2017/07/21/6a1c8dd4-6591-11e7-9928-22d00a47778f_story.html] The Washington Post, July 21, 2007, \"\"Behind the bitter war to preserve Civil War battlefields.\" Accessed May 30, 2018.</ref> In 2011, the organization was renamed, again becoming the [[Civil War Trust]].
