The organization has been designated as a [[List of designated terrorist groups|terrorist group]] by the [[United Nations Security Council]], the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), the [[European Union]], the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, India, and various other countries (see [[#Designation as a terrorist group|below]]). Al-Qaeda has mounted attacks on non-military and military targets in various countries, including the [[1998 United States embassy bombings]], the [[September 11 attacks]], and the [[2002 Bali bombings]].\n\nThe United States government responded to the September 11 attacks by launching the \"[[War on Terror]]\", which sought to undermine al-Qaeda and its allies. The deaths of key leaders, including that of [[death of Osama bin Laden|Osama bin Laden]], have led al-Qaeda's operations to shift from the top down organization and planning of attacks, to the planning of attacks which are carried out by associated groups and ''[[Lone wolf (terrorism)|lone-wolf]]'' operators.
