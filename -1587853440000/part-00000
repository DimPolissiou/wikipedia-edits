It is the world's largest partnership of conservation organisations, with over 120 partner organisations.<ref>{{cite web|title=BirdLife Partners|url=http://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/partnership/birdlife-partners|publisher=BirdLife International|accessdate=30 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIt has a membership of more than 2.5 million people and partner organizations in more than 100 countries. Major partners include [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]], the [[Wild Bird Society of Japan]], and the [[National Audubon Society|U.S. National Audubon Society]]. The group's headquarters are located in [[Cambridge|Cambridge, UK]].\n\nBirdLife International's priorities include preventing extinction of bird species, identifying and safeguarding important sites for birds, maintaining and restoring key bird habitats, and empowering conservationists worldwide. Guided by a global council, member organizations implement the group's strategies on local, regional, and national levels.\n\nBirdLife International has identified 7,500 important bird areas and manages more than 2,500,000 million acres (1,000,000 hectares) of wildlife habitat. As the official listing authority for birds for the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|World Conservation Union]]\u2019s [[IUCN Red List|Red List of threatened species]], BirdLife International has identified more than 1,000 bird species threatened with extinction and has developed conservation strategies for each of them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iucn.org/theme/species/our-work/birds|title=Red List Authority for birds}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:ICBP warden La Digue Seychelles 1970s.jpg|thumb|right|A warden with a ICBP mark on his uniform on [[La Digue]], Seychelles in the 1970s]]\nBirdLife International is a worldwide alliance of nongovernmental organizations that promotes the conservation of birds and their habitats. BirdLife International was founded in 1922 as the ''International Council for Bird Preservation'' by American [[ornithologist]]s [[T.
