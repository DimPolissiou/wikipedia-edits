Its daily energy intake from food is only slightly greater than its energy need for daily activities, and anteaters probably coordinate their body temperatures so they keep cool during periods of rest, and heat up during foraging.<ref name=\"Grzimek-171-175\" />\n\n===Reproduction===\nAdult males are slightly larger and more muscular than females, and have wider heads and necks. Visual sex determination can, however, be difficult, since the penis and [[testes]] are located internally between the rectum and urinary bladder in males and females have a single pair of [[Mammary gland|mammae]] near the armpits. Fertilization occurs by contact transfer without intromission, similar to some lizards. [[Polygyny|Polygynous]] mating usually results in a single offspring; twins are possible but rare. The large foreclaws prevent mothers from grasping their newborns and they therefore have to carry the offspring until they are self-sufficient.<ref name=\"Grzimek-171-175\" />\n\n===Feeding===\nAnteaters are specialized to feed on small insects, with each anteater species having its own insect preferences: small species are specialized on arboreal insects living on small branches, while large species can penetrate the hard covering of the nests of terrestrial insects.  To avoid the jaws, sting, and other defences of the invertebrates, anteaters have adopted the feeding strategy of licking up large numbers of ants and termites as quickly as possible&nbsp;\u2014 an anteater normally spends about a minute at a nest before moving on to another&nbsp;\u2014 and a giant anteater has to visit up to 200 nests per day to consume the thousands of insects it needs to satisfy its caloric requirements.<ref name=\"Grzimek-171-175\" />\n\nThe anteater's tongue is covered with thousands of tiny hooks called [[filiform papilla]]e which are used to hold the insects together with large amounts of saliva.  Swallowing and the movement of the tongue are aided by side-to-side movements of the jaws.  The tongue is attached to the sternum and moves very quickly, flicking 150 times per minute.  The anteater's stomach, similar to a bird's [[gizzard]], has hardened folds and uses strong contractions to grind the insects; a digestive process assisted by small amounts of ingested sand and dirt.<ref name=\"Grzimek-171-175\" />\n\n==Distribution==\n===Range===\nSilky anteaters and northern tamanduas extend their ranges as far north as southeastern Mexico, while giant anteaters can be found as far north as Central America.  Southern tamanduas range south to Uruguay (giant anteaters did also until their recent extirpation there) and the ranges of all species except the northern tamandua overlap in eastern Brazil. Anteaters were confined to South America, which was formerly an island continent, during most of the [[Cenozoic]] Era. Once the [[Isthmus of Panama]] formed about three million years ago, however, anteaters expanded their range into Central America as part of the [[Great American Interchange]].\n\n===Habitat===\nAnteater habitats include [[dry tropical forest]]s, [[rainforest]]s, [[grassland]]s, and [[savanna]]s.  The silky anteater (''Cyclopes didactylus'') is specialized to an arboreal environment, but the more opportunistic tamanduas find their food both on the ground and in trees, typically in dry forests near streams and lakes.
