A [[book of hours]] normally contains a version of, or selection from, such prayers.<ref>John Harthan \"The Book of Hours: With a Historical Survey and Commentary by John Harthan.: New York: Crowell, 1977.</ref>\n\nThe practice of daily prayers grew from the [[Judaism|Jewish]] practice of reciting prayers at set times of the day known as ''[[zmanim]]'': for example, in the ''[[Acts of the Apostles]]'', [[Saint Peter]] and [[John the Evangelist]] visit the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] for the afternoon prayers.<ref>{{bibleverse||Acts|3:1}}</ref> [[Psalm 119]]:164 states: \"Seven times a day I praise you for your righteous laws\" (of this, [[Symeon of Thessalonica]] writes that \"the times of prayer and the services are seven in number, like the number of gifts of the Spirit, since the holy prayers are from the Spirit\").<ref>St. Symeon, p 18</ref>\n\nAround the year 484, the Greek-Cappadocian monk [[Sabbas the Sanctified]] began the process of recording the [[liturgy|liturgical]] practices around [[Jerusalem]], while the cathedral and parish rites in the Patriarchate of Constantinople evolved in an entirely different manner.<ref>Taft, Mount Athos:, pp 180, 181, 182, 187, and 189</ref> The two major practices were synthesized, commencing in the [[8th century]], to yield an office of great complexity.<ref name=Byzantine_Synthesis>Taft, Mount Athos:, pp 180, 182, 184, 185, 187, and 191</ref>\n\nIn 525, [[Benedict of Nursia]] set out one of the earliest schemes for the recitation of the Psalter at the Office. The [[Cluniac Reforms]] of the [[11th century]] renewed an emphasis on liturgy and the canonical hours in the reformed priories of the [[Order of Saint Benedict]], with [[Cluny Abbey]] at their head.\n\nIn general, when modern secular books reference canonical hours in the [[Middle Ages]], these are the equivalent times:\n* [[Vigil]] (eighth hour of night: 2 a.m.) \n* [[Matins]] (a later portion of Vigil, from 3 a.m. to dawn)\n* [[Lauds]] (dawn; approximately 5 a.m., but varies seasonally)\n* [[Prime (liturgy)|Prime]] (early morning, the first hour of daylight, approximately 6 a.m.)\n* [[Terce]] (third hour, 9 a.m.)\n* [[Sext]] (sixth hour, noon)\n* [[Nones (liturgy)|Nones]] (ninth hour, 3 p.m.)\n* [[Vespers]] (sunset, approximately 6 p.m.)\n* [[Compline]] (end of the day before retiring, approximately 7 p.m.)\n\nIn the [[Roman Rite]], canonical hours are also called ''offices'', since they refer to the official set of prayers of the Church, which is known variously as the ''officium divinum'' (\"divine service\" or \"divine duty\"), and the ''opus Dei'' (\"work of God\"). The current official version of the hours in the [[Roman Rite]] of the Catholic Church is called the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] (Latin: ''liturgia horarum'') in North America or '''divine office''' in Ireland and Britain.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn [[Anglicanism]], they are often known as the '''daily''' or '''divine office''', to distinguish them from the other 'offices' of the Church (holy communion, baptism, etc.), which are commonly observed weekly or less often.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Byzantine Rite|Byzantine]] [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Catholic]] Churches, the canonical hours may be referred to as the '''[[Divine Service (Eastern Orthodoxy)|divine services]]''', and the ''book of hours'' is called the ''[[horologion]]'' ({{lang-el|\u1f69\u03c1\u03bf\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd}}). Despite numerous small differences in practice according to local custom, the overall order is the same among Byzantine Rite monasteries, although parish and cathedral customs vary rather more so by locale.\n\nThe usage in [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Churches]], the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], and their Eastern Catholic counterparts all differ from each other and from other rites.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== Judaism and the early church ===\nThe canonical hours stemmed from [[Jewish prayer]]. In the [[Old Testament]], God commanded the Israelite priests to offer sacrifices of animals in the morning and evening ({{bibleverse||Exodus|29:38\u201339}}). Eventually, these sacrifices moved from the [[Tabernacle]] to [[Solomon's Temple]] in [[Jerusalem]]. During the [[Babylonian captivity]], when the Temple was no longer in use, [[synagogue]]s carried on the practice, and the services (at fixed hours of the day) of [[Torah readings]], [[psalms]], and [[hymn]]s began to evolve. This \"sacrifice of praise\" began to be substituted for the sacrifices of animals. After the people returned to [[Judea]], the prayer services were incorporated into Temple worship as well. The miraculous healing of the crippled beggar described in Acts 3:1 of the apostles, took place as Peter and John went to the Temple for the three o\u2019clock hour of prayer. In Act 10: 9, the decision to include [[Gentile]]s among the community of believers, arose from a vision Peter had while praying about noontime.\n\nEarly Christians prayed the Psalms ({{bibleverse||Acts|4:23\u201330}}), which have remained the principal part of the canonical hours. By 60 AD, the [[Didache]], recommends disciples to pray the [[Lord's Prayer]] three times a day; this practice found its way into the canonical hours as well. By the second and third centuries, such [[Church Fathers]] as [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Origen]], and [[Tertullian]] wrote of the practice of Morning and Evening Prayer, and of the prayers at the third, sixth and ninth hours.\n\nIn the early church, during the night before every feast, a [[vigil]] was kept. The word \"Vigils\", at first applied to the Night Office, comes from a Latin source, namely the ''Vigiliae'' or nocturnal watches or guards of the soldiers. The night from six o'clock in the evening to six o'clock in the morning was divided into four watches or vigils of three hours each, the first, the second, the third, and the fourth vigil.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10050a.htm Cabrol, Fernand. \"Matins.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 10. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 6 October 2019{{PD-notice}}</ref> In the evening the faithful assembled in the place or church where the feast was to be celebrated and prepared themselves by prayers, readings, and sometimes also by hearing a sermon. [[Pliny the Younger]] (63 \u2013 c. 113) mentions not only fixed times of prayer by believers, but also specific services\u2014other than the Eucharist\u2014assigned to those times: \"they met on a stated day before it was light, and addressed a form of prayer to Christ, as to a divinity ... after which it was their custom to separate, and then reassemble, to eat in common a harmless meal.\"<ref>Pliny the Younger, ''Epistulae'', Book X, [http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?pageno=117&fk_files=2025 Letter xcvii].</ref> This vigil was a regular institution of Christian life and was defended and highly recommended by St. Augustine and St. Jerome.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05647a.htm Holweck, Frederick. \"Eve of a Feast.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 6 October 2019{{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nThe Office of the Vigils was a single Office, recited without interruption at midnight. Probably in the fourth century, in order to break the monotony of this long night prayer the custom of dividing it into three parts or [[Nocturns]] was introduced. [[John Cassian]] in speaking of the solemn Vigils mentions three divisions of this Office.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11087b.htm Carrol, F. \"Nocturns.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 6 October 2019{{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nAs the form of fixed-hour prayer developed in the [[Christian monastic]] communities in the East and West, the Offices grew both more elaborate and more complex, but the basic cycle of prayer still provided the structure for daily life in [[monastery|monasteries]]. By the fourth century, the elements of the canonical hours were more or less established. For secular (non-monastic) clergy and lay people, the fixed-hour prayers were by necessity much shorter, though in many churches, the form of the fixed-hour prayers became a hybrid of secular and monastic practice (sometimes referred to as 'cathedral' and 'monastic' models).\n\nIn the East, the development of the Divine Services shifted from the area around Jerusalem to [[Constantinople]]. In particular, [[Theodore the Studite]] (c. 758 \u2013 c. 826) combined a number of influences from the Byzantine court ritual with monastic practices common in [[Anatolia]],<ref name=Byzantine_Synthesis /> and added thereto a number of hymns composed by himself and his brother Joseph (see ''[[typikon]]'' for further details).\n\nIn the West, the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] was modeled on his guidelines for the prayers on the customs of the [[basilica]]s of [[Rome]]. It was he who expounded the concept in Christian prayer of the inseparability of the spiritual life from the physical life. St. Benedict set down the dictum ''Ora et labora'' \u2013 \"Pray and work\". The Order of Saint Benedict began to call the prayers the ''Opus Dei'' or \"Work of God.\" By the time of Saint [[Benedict of Nursia]], the monastic Liturgy of the Hours was composed of seven daytime hours and one at night. He associated the practice with Psalm 118/119:164, \"Seven times a day I praise you\", and Psalm 118/119:62, \"At midnight I rise to praise you\".<ref>[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/benedict.html Rule of Saint Benedict, chapter 16 (original Latin)]; [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/50040/50040-h/50040-h.html#chapter-16-nl-how-the-work-of-god-is-to-be-performed-during-the-day English translation by Leonard J. Doyle]</ref> The fixed-hour prayers came to be known as the \"Divine Office\" (office coming from the Latin word for duty).\n\nInitially, the term \"[[Matins]] from [[Latin]] ''matutinus'', meaning \"of or belonging to the morning\",<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2328254 Lewis and Short, ''Latin Dictionary'']</ref> was applied to the psalms recited at dawn. At first \"[[Lauds]]\" (i.e. praises) derived from the three last psalms in the office (148, 149, 150), in all of which the word ''laudate'' is repeated frequently, and to such an extent that originally the word Lauds designated the end, that is to say, these three psalms with the conclusion. By the fourth century the word \"matins\" became attached to the prayer originally offered at cockcrow.<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-07/anf07-49.htm#P7253_2430086 Constitutions of the Holy Apostles], VIII, iv, 34</ref> and, according to the sixth-century ''Rule of Saint Benedict'', could be calculated to be the eighth hour of the night (the hour that began at about 2 a.m.).<ref name=Doyle8>[https://www.ewtn.com/library/priests/benrule.htm#Chapter%208%20-%20Divine%20Office%20at%20Night Rule of Saint Benedict, 8]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=e4lKAwAAQBAJ&dq=Delatte+Rule+Benedict&q=oscillated#v=snippet&q=oscillated&f=false Delatte, ''Commentary on the Rule of St. Benedict'' (Wipf and Stock 1922), p. 141]</ref> Outside of monasteries few rose at night to pray. The canonical hour of the vigil was said in the morning, followed immediately by lauds, and the name of \"matins\" replaced that of \"vigils\". Gradually the title \"Lauds\" was applied to the early morning office.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09038a.htm Cabrol, Fernand. \"Lauds.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 9.

Praying the Office already required various books, such as a [[Psalter]] for the psalms, a [[lectionary]] to find the assigned Scripture reading for the day, a [[Bible]] to proclaim the reading, a [[hymnal]] for singing, etc. As parishes grew in the Middle Ages away from [[cathedral]]s and basilicas, a more concise way of arranging the hours was needed. So, a sort of list developed called the [[breviary]], which gave the format of the daily office and the texts to be used. The spread of breviaries eventually reached Rome, where [[Pope Innocent III]] extended their use to the [[Roman Curia]]. The [[Franciscans]] sought a one-volume breviary for their [[friar]]s to use during travels, so the order adopted the ''Breviarium Curiae'', but substituting the [[Gallican Rite]] Psalter for the Roman. The Franciscans gradually spread this breviary throughout Europe. Eventually, [[Pope Nicholas III]] adopted the widely used Franciscan breviary to be the breviary used in Rome. By the 14th century, the breviary contained the entire text of the canonical hours.\n\n== Roman Rite==\n{{Main|Liturgy of the Hours}}\n[[File:BenedictineVespers.jpg|thumb|left|[[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine monks]] singing [[Vespers]]]]\n\nIn the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church, bishops, priests, and deacons planning to become priests are obliged to recite the full sequence of the hours each day, keeping as far as possible to the true time of day, and using the text of the approved liturgical books that apply to them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/curia/cdwgilh.htm |title=General Instruction of the Liturgy of the Hours, 29 |publisher=Ewtn.com |accessdate=20 May 2019}}</ref><ref name=CIC276>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PY.HTM canon 276 \u00a72 3\u00b2] of the [[Code of Canon Law]]</ref> The laity are strongly encouraged to also pray the Hours.\n\n=== Revisions===\nThe [[Council of Trent]], in its final session on 4 December 1563, entrusted the reform of the Breviary to the Pope.<ref>Council of Trent, ''Decree on Reformation'', [http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/trentall.html Chapter XXI]</ref> On 9 July 1568, [[Pope Pius V]], the successor of the Pope who closed the Council of Trent, promulgated an edition, known as the [[Roman Breviary]], with his [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''Quod a nobis'', imposing it in the same way in which, two years later, he imposed his [[Roman Missal]].\"<ref>[http://matt1618.freeyellow.com/novusordo.html In Defense of the Pauline Mass]</ref> Later Popes altered the Roman Breviary of Pope Pius V. \n[[Pope Pius XII]] also began reforming the Roman Breviary, allowing use of a new translation of the [[Psalms]] and establishing a special commission to study a general revision, with a view to which all the Catholic bishops were consulted in 1955. His successor, [[Pope John XXIII]], made a further revision in 1960.\n\n===Second Vatican Council revisions===\nFollowing the [[Second Vatican Council]], the Catholic Church's [[Roman Rite]] simplified the observance of the canonical hours and sought to make them more suited to the needs of today's apostolate and accessible to the laity, hoping to restore their character as the prayer of the entire Church.\n\nThe Council abolished the office of Prime, and envisioned a manner of distributing the psalms over a period of more than 1 week.<ref>''Sacrosanctum Concilium'' Art 91. So that it may really be possible in practice to observe the course of the hours proposed in Art. 89, the psalms are no longer to be distributed throughout one week, but through some longer period of time.</ref> The Roman breviary is now published under the title ''Liturgia Horarum''.

The character of Morning Prayer is that of praise; of Evening Prayer, that of thanksgiving. Night prayer has the character of reflection on the day that is past and preparing the soul for its passage to eternal life. In each office, the psalms and canticle are framed by antiphons, and each concludes with the traditional Catholic [[doxology]].\n\n== Byzantine Rite usage ==\n\n=== Historical development ===\n{{further|Typicon#Historical development}}\n\n[[File:Monks and Seminarians on Cliros in Jordanville.jpg|thumb|300px|Monks and Seminarians on Cliros.

For example, in the Russian tradition, the \"[[all-night vigil]]\" is served in every church on Saturday nights and the eves of feast days (all though it may be abridged to be as short as two hours) while elsewhere, it is usual to have [[Matins]] on the morning of the feast; however, in the latter instance, [[Vespers]] and matins are rather less abridged but the [[Divine Liturgy]] commences at the end of matins and the hours are not read, as was the case in the extinct cathedral rite of Constantinople.\n\nAlso, as the rite evolved in sundry places, different customs arose; an essay on some of these has been written by Archbishop Basil Krivoshein and is posted on the web.<ref>[http://www.holy-trinity.org/liturgics/krivoshein-greekandrussian.html \"Some differences between Greek and Russian divine services and their significance by Basil Krivoshein, Archbishop of Brussels and Belgium\"], retrieved 1 January 2012</ref>\n\n=== Liturgical books ===\nThe '''[[Horologion]]''' ({{lang|grc|\u1ffe\u03a9\u03c1\u03bf\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd}}; [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]]: ''Chasoslov'', ''\u0427\u0430\u0441oc\u043bo\u0432\u044a''), or  ''Book of Hours'', provides the [[Acolouthia|fixed portions]] of the Daily Cycle of services ({{lang-el|akolouthies}}, {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03af\u03b5\u03c2}}) as used by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic churches]].\n\nInto this fixed framework, numerous moveable parts of the service are inserted.

These are services of a similar structure to, but briefer than, the hours. their usage varies with local custom, but generally they are used only during the Nativity Fast, Apostles Fast, and Dormition Fast on days when the lenten alleluia replaces \"God is the Lord\" at matins, which may be done at the discretion of the [[ecclesiarch]] when the Divine Liturgy is not celebrated.\n\nIn addition to these public prayers, there are also private prayers prescribed for both monastics and laypersons; in some monasteries, however, these are read in church. These include Morning and Evening Prayers and prayers (and, in Russia, [[canon (hymnography)|canons]]) to be prayed in preparation for receiving the [[Eucharist]].\n\nThe full cycle of services are usually served only in monasteries, cathedrals, and other [[Katholikon|katholika]]. In monasteries and parishes of the Russian tradition, the Third and Sixth Hours are read during the [[Liturgy of Preparation|Prothesis ( Liturgy of Preparation)]]; otherwise, the Prothesis is served during Matins, the final portion of which is omitted, the [[Liturgy of the Catechumens]] commencing straightway after the [[troparion]] following the [[Great Doxology]].\n\nThe [[Midnight Office]] is seldom served in parishes churches except at the [[Easter Vigil|Paschal Vigil]] as the essential office wherein the [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|burial shroud]] is removed from the tomb and carried to the altar.\n\n===Aggregates===<!-- [[Aggregate (liturgy)]] redirects here -->\nThe sundry Canonical Hours are, in practice, grouped together into aggregates<ref>Sokolof, p 36</ref> so that there are three major times of prayer a day: Evening, Morning and Midday.<ref group=note>This is to conform with Psalm 55:17, \"Evening, morning, and noonday will I tell of it and will declare it, and He will hear my voice.\"</ref> The most common groupings are as follows:\n\n==== Ordinary days ====\n* Evening \u2013 Ninth Hour, Vespers, Compline<ref group=note>In monasteries, when there is an evening meal, compline is often separated from vespers and read after the meal; in Greek (\u03b1\u03c0\u03cc\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd/''apodeipnon'') and Slavonic (\u041f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440i\u0435/''Pov'echeriye''), the name for Compline literally means, \"After-supper.\"</ref>\n* Morning Watches \u2013 Midnight Office,<ref group=note>Midnight Office is often omitted in parish churches.</ref> Matins, First Hour\n* Morning \u2013 Third Hour, Sixth Hour, and the [[Divine Liturgy]] or [[Typica]]<ref group=note>Though the Liturgy (and Typica) are not, strictly speaking, a part of the daily cycle of services, their placement is fixed by the Typicon in relation to the daily cycle.</ref>\n\n==== Weekdays during lent ====\n* Evening \u2013 Great Compline\n* Morning Watches \u2013 Midnight Office, Matins, First Hour\n* Morning \u2013 Third Hour, Sixth Hour, Ninth Hour, [[Typica]], Vespers (sometimes with the [[Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts]] or, on the Annunciation, the Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom)\n\n==== When there is an all-night vigil ====\nOn the eves before [[Great Feasts of the Orthodox Church|Great Feasts]] and, in some traditions, on all Sundays, this grouping is used.

The cycle of canonical hours is largely monastic, primarily composed of psalm readings. The Coptic equivalent of the Byzantine ''Horologion'' is the [[Agpeya]].\n\nSeven canonical hours exist, corresponding largely to the Byzantine order, with an additional \"Prayer of the Veil\" which is said by Bishops, Priests, and Monks (something like the Byzantine [[Midnight Office]]).\n\nThe hours are chronologically laid out, each containing a theme corresponding to events in the life of Jesus Christ:\n* '''\"Midnight Praise\"''' (said in the early morning before dawn) commemorates the Second Coming of Christ. It consists of three watches, corresponding to the three stages of Christ's [[Agony in the Garden|prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane]] ( {{bibleverse||Matthew|25:1\u201313}} ).\n* '''Prime''' (dawn) is said upon waking in the morning or after the Midnight Praise the previous night. Associated with the Eternity of God, the Incarnation of Christ, and his Resurrection from the dead.\n* '''Terce''' (9 a.m.) commemorates Christ's [[Pilate's court|trial before Pilate]], the descent of the Holy Spirit at [[Pentecost]].\n* '''Sext''' (noon) commemorates the Passion of Christ.\n:Terce and Sext are prayed before each Divine Liturgy.\n* '''None''' (3 p.m.) commemorates the death of Christ on the Cross. This hour is also read during fasting days.\n* '''Vespers''' (sunset) commemorates the taking down of Christ from the Cross.\n* '''Compline''' (9 p.m. \u2013 before bedtime) commemorates the burial of Christ, the Final Judgment.\n:Vespers and Compline are both read before the Liturgy during Lent and the [[Fast of Nineveh]].\n* The '''Veil''' is reserved for bishops, priests and monks, as an examination of conscience.\n\nEvery one of the Hours follows the same basic outline:\n* Introduction, which includes the Lord's Prayer\n* Prayer of Thanksgiving\n* Psalm 50 (LXX).\n* Various Psalms\n* An excerpt from the Holy Gospel\n* Short Litanies\n* Some prayers (Only during Prime and Compline)\n* Lord Have Mercy is then chanted 41 times (representing the 39 lashes Christ received before the crucifixion, plus one for the spear in His side, plus one for the crown of thorns)\n* Prayer of \"Holy Holy Holy...\" and Lord's Prayer\n* Prayer of Absolution\n* Prayer of Every Hour\n\n== East Syriac Rite ==\nThe [[East Syriac Rite]] (also known as the Chaldean, Assyrian, or Persian Rite) has historically been used in Syria, Mesopotamia, Persia, and [[Saint Thomas Christians|Malabar]]. The nucleus of the Daily Office is of course the recitation of the Psalter. There are only three regular hours of service (Evening, Midnight, and Morning), with a rarely used Compline. When East Syriac monasteries existed (which is no longer the case) seven hours of prayer were the custom in them, and three ''hulali'' (sections) of the Psalter were recited at each service. This would accomplish the unique feat of the common recitation of the entire Psalter each day.\n\nThe present arrangement provides for seven ''hulali'' at each ferial night service, ten on Sundays, three on \"Memorials\", and the whole Psalter on Feasts of the Lord. At the evening service there is a selection of from four to seven psalms, varying with the day of the week, and also a ''Shuraya'', or short psalm, with generally a portion of [[Psalm 119|Psalm 118]], varying with the day of the fortnight. At the morning service the invariable psalms are 109, 90, 103:1\u20136, 112, 92, 148, 150, 116. On ferias and \"Memorials\" Psalm 146 is said after Psalm 148, and on ferias Psalm 1:1\u201318, comes at the end of the psalms.\n\nThe rest of the services consist of prayers, antiphons, litanies, and verses (''giyura'') inserted\u2014like the Greek [[stichera]], but more extensively\u2014between verses of psalms. On Sundays the [[Gloria in Excelsis]] and [[Benedicte (prayer)|Benedicte]] are said instead of Psalm 146. Both morning and evening services end with several prayers, a blessing, (''Khuthama'', \"Sealing\" ), the kiss of peace, and the Creed.\n\nThe variables, besides the psalms, are those of the feast or day, which are very few, and those of the day of the fortnight. These fortnights consist of weeks called \"Before\" (''Qdham'') and \"After\" (''Wathar''), according to which of the two choirs begins the service. Hence the book of the Divine Office is called ''Qdham u wathar'', or at full length ''Kthawa daqdham wadhwathar'', the \"Book of Before and After\".\n\nThe East Syriac liturgical Calendar is unique. The year is divided into periods of about seven weeks each, called ''Shawu'i''; these are Advent (called ''Subara'', \"Annunciation\"), Epiphany, Lent, Easter, the Apostles, Summer, \"Elias and the Cross\", \"Moses\", and the \"Dedication\" (''Qudash idta''). \"Moses\" and the \"Dedication\" have only four weeks each. The Sundays are generally named after the ''Shawu'a'' in which they occur, \"Fourth Sunday of Epiphany\", \"Second Sunday of the Annunciation \", etc., though sometimes the name changes in the middle of a ''Shawu'a''. Most of the \"Memorials\" (''dukhrani''), or saints' days, which have special lections, occur on the Fridays between Christmas and Lent, and are therefore movable feasts; but some, such as [[Christmas]], [[Theophany]], the [[Dormition]], and about thirty smaller days without proper readings, are on fixed days.\n\nThere are four shorter fasting periods besides the [[Great Lent]]; these are:\n* the ''Fast of Mar Zaya'' (three days after the second Sunday of the Nativity)\n* the ''Fast of the Virgins'' (after the first Sunday of the Epiphany)\n* the ''Fast of the Ninevites'' (seventy days before Easter)\n* the ''Fast of Mart Mariam'' (Our Lady) (from the first to the fourteenth of August)\n\nThe Fast of the Ninevites commemorates the repentance of Nineveh at the preaching of Jonas, and is carefully kept. Those of Mar Zaya and the Virgins are nearly obsolete. The Malabar Rite has largely adopted the Roman Calendar, and several Roman days have been added to that of the [[Chaldean Catholics]]. The Chaldean Easter coincides with that of the Eastern Orthodox Church, as the [[Julian Calendar]] is used to calculate Easter. The years are numbered, not from the birth of Christ, but from the [[Seleucid era]] (year 1 = 311 B.C.).\n\n== West Syriac Rite ==\nThe [[West Syriac Rite]], used in [[Syria]] by the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] (Jacobites) and [[Syriac Catholic Church|Syriac Rite Catholic]] is in its origin simply the old rite of [[Antioch]] in the Syriac language. The translation must have been made very early, evidently before the division in the church over [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]], before the influence of [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople]] over the Antiochian Rite had begun. No doubt as soon as Christian communities arose in the rural areas of Syria the prayers which in the cities (Antioch, Jerusalem, etc.) were said in Greek, were, as a matter of course, translated into Syriac for common use.\n\nIn accordance with [[Psalm 119]]:164, \"Seven times in the day have I praised Thee for Thy judgments, O Righteous One,\"<ref>Psalm 119:164</ref> the Syriac Orthodox Church observes seven services of prayer each day:\n* '''Evening''' or ''Ramsho'' prayer (Vespers)\n* '''Drawing of the Veil''' or ''Sootoro'', meaning \"Protection\", from Psalm 91, which is sung at this prayer, \"He who sits under the protection of the Most High\" (Compline)\n* '''Midnight''' or ''Lilyo'' prayer (Matins)\n* '''Morning''' or ''Saphro'' prayer (Prime, 6 a.m.)\n* '''Third Hour''' or ''Tloth sho`in'' prayer (Terce, 9 a.m.)\n* '''Sixth Hour''' or ''Sheth sho`in'' prayer (Sext, noon)\n* '''Ninth Hour''' or ''Tsha' sho`in'' prayer (None, 3 p.m.)\n\nThe Midnight prayer (Matins) consists of three ''qawme'' or \"watches\" (literally \"standings\"). As in other traditional rites, the ecclesiastical day begins in the evening at sunset with Vespers (''Ramsho''). Today, even in monasteries, the services are grouped together: Vespers and Compline are said together; Matins and Prime are said together; and the Third, Sixth and Ninth Hours are said together; resulting in three times of prayer each day.\n\nThe Syriac Orthodox Book of Hours is called the ''Shhimo'', \"simple prayer.\" The ''shhimo'' has offices for the canonical hours for each day of the week. Each canonical office begins and ends with a ''qawmo'', a set of prayers that includes the [[Lord's Prayer]]. At the end of the office, the [[Nicene Creed]] is recited. The great part of the office consists of lengthy liturgical poems composed for the purpose, similar to the Byzantine [[Canon (hymnography)|odes]].\n\n== Armenian Rite ==\nThe Daily Services in the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] and the [[Armenian Catholic Church]] are made up of nine services. The daily cycle of prayer begins with the Night Service, according to the ancient belief that a new day begins at nightfall.\n\nThe '''Night Service''' (midnight) Dedicated to the praising of [[God the Father]]. Themes of the service are: thanksgiving to God for the blessing of sleep and asking that the remainder of the night pass in peace and tranquility, and that the next day be spent in purity and righteousness.\n\nThe '''Morning Service''' (dawn) Dedicated to the praising of [[God the Son]]. Symbolizes the Resurrection of Christ and his appearance to the [[Myrrh-bearing Women]].\n\nThe '''Sunrise Service''' (6:00&nbsp;a.m.)<ref group=note>Originally, the Sunrise Service was joined to the Morning Service.</ref> Dedicated to the praising of the [[Holy Spirit]]. Symbolizes the appearance to Christ to the disciples after the Resurrection.\n\nThe '''Third Hour''' (9:00&nbsp;a.m.) Dedicated to the Holy Spirit. Symbolizes Eve's original tasting the forbidden fruit and eventual liberation from condemnation through Jesus Christ. The service has a profound penitential meaning.\n\nThe '''Sixth Hour''' (noon) Dedicated to God the Father. Symbolizes Christ's Crucifixion. The prayers at the service ask for God's help towards feeble human nature.\n\nThe '''Ninth Hour''' (3:00&nbsp;p.m.) Dedicated to God the Son. Symbolizes Christ's death and liberation of humanity from the power of the Hell.\n\nThe '''Evening Service''' (before sunset) Dedicated to God the Son. Symbolizes Christ's burial, asks God for a quiet night and a peaceful sleep.\n\nThe '''Peace Service''' (after sunset) Dedicated to the Holy Spirit. Symbolizes Christ's descent into Hell and liberation of the righteous from torments.\n\nThe '''Rest Service''' (before retiring for sleep) Dedicated to God the Father. In early times it was the continuation of the Peace Service.\n\nIn ancient times all nine services were offered every day, especially in monasteries. At present the following services are conducted in churches daily for the majority of the year:\n* In the morning: Night and Morning Services together\n* In the evening: Evening Service\n\nDuring [[Great Lent]], all of the services are offered on weekdays (except Saturday and Sunday) according to the following schedule:\n* In the morning: Night, Morning and Sunrise Services\n* In the afternoon: Third, Sixth, Ninth Hours\n* In the evening:\n** Monday, Tuesday, Thursday: Peace Service\n** Wednesday, Friday: Rest Service\n** Saturday, Sunday: Evening Service\n\nThe book which contains the hymns which constitute the substance of the musical system of [[Armenian chant|Armenian liturgical chant]] is the ''Sharagnots'' (see [[Octoechos (liturgy)#Armenian Usage|Armenian Octoechos]]), a collection of hymns known as ''Sharakan''. Originally, these hymns were [[Psalms]] and biblical [[Canticle]]s that were chanted during the services, similar to the Byzantine [[Canon (hymnography)|Canon]]. In addition, the eight modes are applied to the psalms of the Night office, called ''ganonaklookh'' (Canon head).\n\n== Anglican usage ==\n{{Main|Daily Office (Anglican)}}\n[[File:Anglican Breviary.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Anglican Rosary]] sitting atop [[Anglican Breviary|The Anglican Breviary]] and [[The Book of Common Prayer]]]]\n\nThe daily offices have always had an important place in Anglican spirituality. Until comparatively recently Mattins and Evensong were the principal Sunday services in most Anglican churches, sung to settings by composers both ancient and modern. While Evensong with its musical repertory spanning five centuries continues to play an important role in Anglican worship, the [[eucharist]] has replaced Morning Prayer as the principal service on Sunday mornings in most Anglican parishes and cathedrals.\n\nThe [[Book of Common Prayer]], first published in 1549 and revised down the centuries, constitutes the basis of the liturgy for [[Anglicans]] and [[Anglican Use]] Roman Catholics. All Anglican prayer books provide offices for [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|Morning Prayer]] (often called Mattins or Matins) and [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evening Prayer]] (colloquially known as Evensong).<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://anglicanhistory.org/liturgy/clarke_evensong.html|title=Evensong Explained, with Notes on Matins and the Litany|last=Lowther Clarke|first=W. K.|publisher=SPCK|year=1922|location=London}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional structure of Matins and Evensong in most Anglican prayer books reflects the intention by the reforming Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Thomas Cranmer]], to return to the office's older roots as the daily prayer of parish churches. For this purpose, he eliminated the lesser hours and conflated the medieval offices of Matins and Lauds, incorporating the canticles associated with each: the [[Benedictus (Song of Zechariah)|Benedictus]] and [[Te Deum]]. Similarly, Evening Prayer incorporated both the [[Magnificat]] from Vespers and the [[Nunc Dimittis]] from Compline. In Cranmer's design, each canticle was preceded by a reading from scripture. This parallelism of two readings, each followed by a canticle, is a distinctive feature of the Anglican daily office. For the sake of simplicity, Cranmer also eliminated [[responsory|responsories]] and [[antiphon]]s, although these have been restored in many contemporary Anglican prayer books. Since his time, every edition of the Book of Common Prayer has included the complete psalter, usually arranged to be read over the course of a month. One distinctive contribution of Anglican worship is a broad repertory of [[Anglican Chant]] settings for the psalms and canticles.\n\nSince the early 20th century, revised editions of the Book of Common Prayer or supplemental service books published by Anglican churches have often added offices for midday prayer and [[Compline]]. In England and other Anglican provinces, service books now include four offices:\n* [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|Morning Prayer]], corresponding to [[Matins]] and [[Lauds]].\n* [[Prayer During the Day]], conflating the lesser hours of [[Terce]], [[Sext]], and [[None (liturgy)|None]].\n* [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evening Prayer]], corresponding to [[Vespers]].\n* [[Compline|Night Prayer, or Compline]].\n\nSome prayer books also include a selection of prayers and devotions specifically for family use. The 1979 Book of Common Prayer of the Episcopal Church in the U.S. also provides an \"Order of Worship for the Evening\" as a prelude to Evensong with blessings for the lighting of candles and the singing of the ancient Greek lamp-lighting hymn, the [[Phos Hilaron]]. In the [[Church of England]], the publication in 2005 of ''Daily Prayer'', the third volume of [[Common Worship]], adds \"Prayer During the Day\" to the services for Morning Prayer, Evening Prayer and Compline, and adds a selection of antiphons and responsories for the seasons of the [[Church Year]]. The 1989 New Zealand Prayer Book provides different outlines for Mattins and Evensong on each day of the week, as well as \"Midday Prayer,\" \"Night Prayer,\" and \"Family Prayer.\" In 1995, the [[Episcopal Church (United States)]] published the ''Contemporary Office Book'' in one volume with the complete psalter and all readings from the two-year Daily Office lectionary.\n\nMost Anglican monastic communities use a Daily Office based on the Book of Common Prayer or on Common Worship but with additional antiphons and devotions. The [[Order of the Holy Cross]] and [[Order of St. Helena]] published ''A Monastic Breviary'' (Wilton, Conn.: Morehouse-Barlow) in 1976. The Order of St. Helena published the ''St. Helena Breviary'' (New York: Church Publishing) in 2006 with a revised psalter eliminating male pronouns in reference to God. The [[All Saints Sisters of the Poor]] also use an elaborated version of the Anglican Daily Office. The [[Society of St. Francis]] publishes ''Celebrating Common Prayer'', which has become especially popular for use among Anglicans.\n\nSome [[Anglo-Catholics]] use the [[Anglican Breviary]], an adaptation of the Pre-Vatican II Roman Rite and the [[Sarum Rite]] in the style of Cranmer's original Book of Common Prayer, along with supplemental material from other western sources, including a common of Octaves, a common of Holy Women, and other material. It provides for the eight historical offices in one volume, but does not include the [[Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary]], which was bound along with many editions of the ''Breviarium Romanum''. Other Anglo-Catholics use the Roman Catholic ''Liturgy of the Hours'' (US) or ''Divine Office'' (UK). Various Anglican adaptations of pre-Vatican II Roman office-books have appeared over the years, among the best known being Canon W. Douglas' translation of the 'Monastic Diurnal' into the idiom of the 'Book of Common Prayer'.\n\nHistorically, Anglican clergy have vested in [[cassock]], [[surplice]] and [[tippet]] for Morning and Evening Prayer, while bishops wear the [[rochet]] and [[chimere]]. In some monastic communities and Anglo-Catholic parishes, the officiant wears surplice or [[alb]], stole and [[cope]] when Evensong is celebrated solemnly.\n\nThe canons of the Church of England and some other Anglican provinces require clergy to read Morning and Evening Prayer daily, either in public worship or privately. According to Canon C.24, \"Every priest having a cure of souls shall provide that, in the absence of reasonable hindrance, Morning and Evening Prayer daily and on appointed days the Litany shall be said in the church, or one of the churches, of which he is the minister.\"<ref>Canon C.24</ref> Canon C.26 stipulates that \"Every clerk (cleric) in Holy Orders is under obligation, not being let (prevented) by sickness or some other urgent cause, to say daily the Morning and Evening Prayer....\"<ref>Canon C.26</ref> In other Anglican provinces, the Daily Office is not a canonical obligation but is strongly encouraged.\n\n== Methodist usage ==\n[[File:Methodist canonical hours.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A Lukan Book of Hours (in purple) and The Book of Offices and Services (in red), both liturgical texts of [[Order of St. Luke|The Order of Saint Luke]], a Methodist religious order]]\nF. W. Macdonald, the biographer of [[John Fletcher Hurst|The Rt. Rev. John Fletcher Hurst]], stated that Oxford Methodism \"with its almost monastic rigors, its living by rule, its canonical hours of prayer, is a fair and noble phase of the many-sided life of the Church of England\".<ref name=\"Hurst1902\">{{cite book|last=Hurst|first=John Fletcher|title=The History of Methodism|year=1902|publisher=Eaton & Mains|pages=310\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional 1784 Methodist Daily Office is contained in ''The Sunday Service of the Methodists'', which was written by [[John Wesley]] himself. It was consequently updated in the ''Book of Offices'', published in 1936 in Great Britain, and ''[[The United Methodist Book of Worship (1992)|The United Methodist Book of Worship]]'', published in 1992 in the United States.<ref name=\"Bradshaw2013\">{{cite book|last=Bradshaw|first=Paul F.|title=New SCM Dictionary of Liturgy and Worship|date=April 2013|publisher=Hymns Ancient and Modern Ltd|isbn=978-0-334-04932-6|page=82|quote=The Church in 1935 approved ''Divine Worship'' (versions of morning prayer, other services and numerous collects) and in 1936 authorized the ''Book of Offices'' and, bound in with it, the ''Order for Morning Prayer'': both still exhibited connections to the ''BCP'' and thus Wesley's orders, though the former showed a willingness to include newly composed prayers and those borrowed from other Free Church sources.}}<!--|accessdate=2 May 2015--></ref> Some Methodist religious orders publish the Daily Office to be used for that community, for example, ''The Book of Offices and Services of The Order of Saint Luke'' contains [[Lauds|Morning]], [[Terce|Mid-Morning]], [[Sext|Noon]], [[Nones (liturgy)|Mid-Afternoon]], [[Vespers|Evening]], [[Compline]] and [[Vigil]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Book of Offices and Services|date=6 September 2012|publisher=[[Order of St. Luke]]}}</ref>\n\n== Liberal Catholic usage ==\nThe [[Liberal Catholic Church]], and many groups in the [[Liberal Catholic movement]], also use a simple version of the Western canonical hours, said with various scripture reading and collects. According to the ''Liturgy of the Liberal Catholic Church,'' the Scriptures used are generally limited to the readings of the day, and the complete psalter is not incorporated unless at the discretion of the priest presiding, if as a public service, or of the devotee in private use. The Hours of the Liberal Rite consist of: Lauds, Prime, Sext, Vespers, and Complin. Its recitation is not obligatory on Liberal Catholic priests or faithful, according to current directs from the General Episcopal Synod.\n\n== Reformed and Lutheran usage ==\nSome Reformed churches\u2014notably the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]] and the [[United Church of Christ]]\u2014have published daily office books adapted from the ancient structure of morning and evening prayer in the Western church, usually revised for the purpose of [[inclusive language]].\n\n''The New Century Psalter'', published in 1999 by The Pilgrim Press, includes an inclusive-language revision of the psalms adapted from the [[New Revised Standard Version]] of the Bible with refrains and complete orders for Morning and Evening Prayer. Simple family prayers for morning, evening and the close of day are also provided.\n\n''Book of Common Worship Daily Prayer'', published in 1994 by [[Westminster John Knox Press]], includes the daily offices from [[The Book of Common Worship of 1993]], the liturgy of the [[Presbyterian Church USA]]. In addition to Morning and Evening Prayer there is a complete service for Compline. Its psalter\u2014an inclusive-language revision of the psalter from the 1979 American [[Book of Common Prayer]]\u2014also includes a collect for each psalm. Antiphons and litanies are provided for the seasons of the church year. A new ''Book of Common Worship Daily Prayer'' with expanded content was published in 2018. It adds a service for Mid-Day Prayer. Its new psalter is from [[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]].\n\nBoth books are intended for ecumenical use and can be used with any daily lectionary.\n\nLutheran worship books usually include orders for Morning and Evening Prayer as well as Compline. English-language liturgies published by immigrant Lutheran communities in North America were based at first on the [[Book of Common Prayer]]. In recent years, under the impact of [[liturgical movement|the liturgical movement]], Lutheran churches have restored the historic form of the Western office. Both ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]]'' published by the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada]] as well as the ''[[Lutheran Service Book]]'' of the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]] provide daily offices along with a complete psalter.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Plenarium]]\n* [[Salah times]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=note|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* {{Citation\n|year = 1907\n|title  =\u0422v\u043f\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0301\u043d\u044a \u0441\u0456\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0301\u0432\u044a (Title here transliterated into Russian; actually in Church Slavonic) (The Typicon which is the Order)\n|publisher = \u0421\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0442\u0438\u043f\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u044f (The Synodal Printing House)\n|publication-place = \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430 (Moscow, Russian Empire)\n|page = 1154\n}}\n* {{Citation\n|year=1992\n|publication-date=1997\n|title=The Unabbreviated Horologion\n|place=[[Jordanville, New York]]\n|publisher=[[Holy Trinity Monastery (Jordanville, New York)|Holy Trinity Monastery]]\n}}\n* [http://www.orthlib.info/Chasoslov/Chasoslov.html On-line text (in [[Church Slavonic]] \u0427\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432 \u2013 Chasoslov, Horologion, Retrieved 31 December 2011]\n* {{Citation\n|author=Saint [[Symeon of Thessaloniki]]\n|others=Translated by Harry L.N.

A [[book of hours]] normally contains a version of, or selection from, such prayers.<ref>John Harthan \"The Book of Hours: With a Historical Survey and Commentary by John Harthan.: New York: Crowell, 1977.</ref>\n\nThe practice of daily prayers grew from the [[Judaism|Jewish]] practice of reciting prayers at set times of the day known as ''[[zmanim]]'': for example, in the ''[[Acts of the Apostles]]'', [[Saint Peter]] and [[John the Evangelist]] visit the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] for the afternoon prayers.<ref>{{bibleverse||Acts|3:1}}</ref> [[Psalm 119]]:164 states: \"Seven times a day I praise you for your righteous laws\" (of this, [[Symeon of Thessalonica]] writes that \"the times of prayer and the services are seven in number, like the number of gifts of the Spirit, since the holy prayers are from the Spirit\").<ref>St. Symeon, p 18</ref>\n\nAround the year 484, the Greek-Cappadocian monk [[Sabbas the Sanctified]] began the process of recording the [[liturgy|liturgical]] practices around [[Jerusalem]], while the cathedral and parish rites in the Patriarchate of Constantinople evolved in an entirely different manner.<ref>Taft, Mount Athos:, pp 180, 181, 182, 187, and 189</ref> The two major practices were synthesized, commencing in the [[8th century]], to yield an office of great complexity.<ref name=Byzantine_Synthesis>Taft, Mount Athos:, pp 180, 182, 184, 185, 187, and 191</ref>\n\nIn 525, [[Benedict of Nursia]] set out one of the earliest schemes for the recitation of the Psalter at the Office. The [[Cluniac Reforms]] of the [[11th century]] renewed an emphasis on liturgy and the canonical hours in the reformed priories of the [[Order of Saint Benedict]], with [[Cluny Abbey]] at their head.\n\nIn general, when modern secular books reference canonical hours in the [[Middle Ages]], these are the equivalent times:\n* [[Vigil]] (eighth hour of night: 2 a.m.) \n* [[Matins]] (a later portion of Vigil, from 3 a.m. to dawn)\n* [[Lauds]] (dawn; approximately 5 a.m., but varies seasonally)\n* [[Prime (liturgy)|Prime]] (early morning, the first hour of daylight, approximately 6 a.m.)\n* [[Terce]] (third hour, 9 a.m.)\n* [[Sext]] (sixth hour, noon)\n* [[Nones (liturgy)|Nones]] (ninth hour, 3 p.m.)\n* [[Vespers]] (sunset, approximately 6 p.m.)\n* [[Compline]] (end of the day before retiring, approximately 7 p.m.)\n\nIn the [[Roman Rite]], canonical hours are also called ''offices'', since they refer to the official set of prayers of the Church, which is known variously as the ''officium divinum'' (\"divine service\" or \"divine duty\"), and the ''opus Dei'' (\"work of God\"). The current official version of the hours in the [[Roman Rite]] of the Catholic Church is called the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] (Latin: ''liturgia horarum'') in North America or '''divine office''' in Ireland and Britain.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn [[Anglicanism]], they are often known as the '''daily''' or '''divine office''', to distinguish them from the other 'offices' of the Church (holy communion, baptism, etc.), which are commonly observed weekly or less often.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Byzantine Rite|Byzantine]] [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Catholic]] Churches, the canonical hours may be referred to as the '''[[Divine Service (Eastern Orthodoxy)|divine services]]''', and the ''book of hours'' is called the ''[[horologion]]'' ({{lang-el|\u1f69\u03c1\u03bf\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd}}). Despite numerous small differences in practice according to local custom, the overall order is the same among Byzantine Rite monasteries, although parish and cathedral customs vary rather more so by locale.\n\nThe usage in [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Churches]], the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], and their Eastern Catholic counterparts all differ from each other and from other rites.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== Judaism and the early church ===\nThe canonical hours stemmed from [[Jewish prayer]]. In the [[Old Testament]], God commanded the Israelite priests to offer sacrifices of animals in the morning and evening ({{bibleverse||Exodus|29:38\u201339}}). Eventually, these sacrifices moved from the [[Tabernacle]] to [[Solomon's Temple]] in [[Jerusalem]]. During the [[Babylonian captivity]], when the Temple was no longer in use, [[synagogue]]s carried on the practice, and the services (at fixed hours of the day) of [[Torah readings]], [[psalms]], and [[hymn]]s began to evolve. This \"sacrifice of praise\" began to be substituted for the sacrifices of animals. After the people returned to [[Judea]], the prayer services were incorporated into Temple worship as well. The miraculous healing of the crippled beggar described in Acts 3:1 of the apostles, took place as Peter and John went to the Temple for the three o\u2019clock hour of prayer. In Act 10: 9, the decision to include [[Gentile]]s among the community of believers, arose from a vision Peter had while praying about noontime.\n\nEarly Christians prayed the Psalms ({{bibleverse||Acts|4:23\u201330}}), which have remained the principal part of the canonical hours. By 60 AD, the [[Didache]], recommends disciples to pray the [[Lord's Prayer]] three times a day; this practice found its way into the canonical hours as well. By the second and third centuries, such [[Church Fathers]] as [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Origen]], and [[Tertullian]] wrote of the practice of Morning and Evening Prayer, and of the prayers at the third, sixth and ninth hours.\n\nIn the early church, during the night before every feast, a [[vigil]] was kept. The word \"Vigils\", at first applied to the Night Office, comes from a Latin source, namely the ''Vigiliae'' or nocturnal watches or guards of the soldiers. The night from six o'clock in the evening to six o'clock in the morning was divided into four watches or vigils of three hours each, the first, the second, the third, and the fourth vigil.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10050a.htm Cabrol, Fernand. \"Matins.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 10. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 6 October 2019{{PD-notice}}</ref> In the evening the faithful assembled in the place or church where the feast was to be celebrated and prepared themselves by prayers, readings, and sometimes also by hearing a sermon. [[Pliny the Younger]] (63 \u2013 c. 113) mentions not only fixed times of prayer by believers, but also specific services\u2014other than the Eucharist\u2014assigned to those times: \"they met on a stated day before it was light, and addressed a form of prayer to Christ, as to a divinity ... after which it was their custom to separate, and then reassemble, to eat in common a harmless meal.\"<ref>Pliny the Younger, ''Epistulae'', Book X, [http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?pageno=117&fk_files=2025 Letter xcvii].</ref> This vigil was a regular institution of Christian life and was defended and highly recommended by St. Augustine and St. Jerome.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05647a.htm Holweck, Frederick. \"Eve of a Feast.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 6 October 2019{{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nThe Office of the Vigils was a single Office, recited without interruption at midnight. Probably in the fourth century, in order to break the monotony of this long night prayer the custom of dividing it into three parts or [[Nocturns]] was introduced. [[John Cassian]] in speaking of the solemn Vigils mentions three divisions of this Office.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11087b.htm Carrol, F. \"Nocturns.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 6 October 2019{{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nAs the form of fixed-hour prayer developed in the [[Christian monastic]] communities in the East and West, the Offices grew both more elaborate and more complex, but the basic cycle of prayer still provided the structure for daily life in [[monastery|monasteries]]. By the fourth century, the elements of the canonical hours were more or less established. For secular (non-monastic) clergy and lay people, the fixed-hour prayers were by necessity much shorter, though in many churches, the form of the fixed-hour prayers became a hybrid of secular and monastic practice (sometimes referred to as 'cathedral' and 'monastic' models).\n\nIn the East, the development of the Divine Services shifted from the area around Jerusalem to [[Constantinople]]. In particular, [[Theodore the Studite]] (c. 758 \u2013 c. 826) combined a number of influences from the Byzantine court ritual with monastic practices common in [[Anatolia]],<ref name=Byzantine_Synthesis /> and added thereto a number of hymns composed by himself and his brother Joseph (see ''[[typikon]]'' for further details).\n\nIn the West, the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] was modeled on his guidelines for the prayers on the customs of the [[basilica]]s of [[Rome]]. It was he who expounded the concept in Christian prayer of the inseparability of the spiritual life from the physical life. St. Benedict set down the dictum ''Ora et labora'' \u2013 \"Pray and work\". The Order of Saint Benedict began to call the prayers the ''Opus Dei'' or \"Work of God.\" By the time of Saint [[Benedict of Nursia]], the monastic Liturgy of the Hours was composed of seven daytime hours and one at night. He associated the practice with Psalm 118/119:164, \"Seven times a day I praise you\", and Psalm 118/119:62, \"At midnight I rise to praise you\".<ref>[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/benedict.html Rule of Saint Benedict, chapter 16 (original Latin)]; [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/50040/50040-h/50040-h.html#chapter-16-nl-how-the-work-of-god-is-to-be-performed-during-the-day English translation by Leonard J.

Praying the Office already required various books, such as a [[Psalter]] for the psalms, a [[lectionary]] to find the assigned Scripture reading for the day, a [[Bible]] to proclaim the reading, a [[hymnal]] for singing, etc. As parishes grew in the Middle Ages away from [[cathedral]]s and basilicas, a more concise way of arranging the hours was needed. So, a sort of list developed called the [[breviary]], which gave the format of the daily office and the texts to be used. The spread of breviaries eventually reached Rome, where [[Pope Innocent III]] extended their use to the [[Roman Curia]]. The [[Franciscans]] sought a one-volume breviary for their [[friar]]s to use during travels, so the order adopted the ''Breviarium Curiae'', but substituting the [[Gallican Rite]] Psalter for the Roman. The Franciscans gradually spread this breviary throughout Europe. Eventually, [[Pope Nicholas III]] adopted the widely used Franciscan breviary to be the breviary used in Rome. By the 14th century, the breviary contained the entire text of the canonical hours.\n\n== Roman Rite==\n{{Main|Liturgy of the Hours}}\n[[File:BenedictineVespers.jpg|thumb|left|[[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine monks]] singing [[Vespers]]]]\n\nIn the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church, bishops, priests, and deacons planning to become priests are obliged to recite the full sequence of the hours each day, keeping as far as possible to the true time of day, and using the text of the approved liturgical books that apply to them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/curia/cdwgilh.htm |title=General Instruction of the Liturgy of the Hours, 29 |publisher=Ewtn.com |accessdate=20 May 2019}}</ref><ref name=CIC276>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PY.HTM canon 276 \u00a72 3\u00b2] of the [[Code of Canon Law]]</ref> The laity are strongly encouraged to also pray the Hours.\n\n=== Revisions===\nThe [[Council of Trent]], in its final session on 4 December 1563, entrusted the reform of the Breviary to the Pope.<ref>Council of Trent, ''Decree on Reformation'', [http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/trentall.html Chapter XXI]</ref> On 9 July 1568, [[Pope Pius V]], the successor of the Pope who closed the Council of Trent, promulgated an edition, known as the [[Roman Breviary]], with his [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''Quod a nobis'', imposing it in the same way in which, two years later, he imposed his [[Roman Missal]].\"<ref>[http://matt1618.freeyellow.com/novusordo.html In Defense of the Pauline Mass]</ref> Later Popes altered the Roman Breviary of Pope Pius V. \n[[Pope Pius XII]] also began reforming the Roman Breviary, allowing use of a new translation of the [[Psalms]] and establishing a special commission to study a general revision, with a view to which all the Catholic bishops were consulted in 1955.

The character of Morning Prayer is that of praise; of Evening Prayer, that of thanksgiving. Night prayer has the character of reflection on the day that is past and preparing the soul for its passage to eternal life.

The cycle of the ''Octoechos'' continues through the following great lent, so the variable parts of the lenten services are determined by both the preceding year's and the current year's dates of Easter.\n\n===== 8 Week Cycle of the Octoechos =====\nThe cycle of the [[Octoechos|eight Tones]] is found in the ''[[Octoechos (liturgy)|Octoechos]]'' and is dependent on the date of Easter and commences with the [[Thomas Sunday#Eastern churches|Sunday after (eighth day of) Easter]], that week using the first [[echos|tone]], the next week using the second tone, and so, repeating through the week preceding the subsequent [[Palm Sunday]].<ref group=\"note\">Each day of [[Bright Week]] (Easter Week) uses propers in a different tone, Sunday: Tone One, Monday: Tone Two, skipping the [[grave tone]] (Tone Seven)</ref>\n\n===== 11 Week Cycle of the Matins Gospels =====\nThe portions of each of the Gospels from the narration of the Resurrection through the end are divided into eleven readings which are read on successive Sundays at matins; there are hymns sung at Matins that correspond with that day's [[Matins Gospel]].\n\n=== Daily cycle of services ===\nThe Daily Cycle begins with [[Vespers]]<ref group=note>In accordance with Old Testament practice, the day is considered to begin in the evening (Genesis 1:5).</ref> and proceeds throughout the night and day according to the following table:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name of service in Greek\n!Name of service in English\n!Historical time of service\n!Theme<ref>Sokolof, pp 36\u201338</ref>\n|-\n|Esperinos ({{lang|grc|\u1f19\u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2}}) || [[Vespers#Eastern/Oriental Catholic & Orthodox|Vespers]] || At sunset || Glorification of God, the Creator of the world and its Providence\n|-\n|Apodepnon ({{lang|grc|\u1f08\u03c0\u03cc\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd}})||[[Compline]]|| At bedtime || Sleep as the image of death, illumined by Christ's [[Harrowing of Hell]] after His death\n|-\n|Mesonyktikon ({{lang|grc|\u039c\u03b5\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd\u03c5\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd}}) || [[Midnight Office]] || At midnight || Christ's midnight prayer in Gethsemane; a reminder to be ready for the Bridegroom coming at midnight and the [[Last Judgment]]\n|-\n|Orthros ({{lang|grc|\u1f4c\u03c1\u03b8\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2}}) || [[Matins#Eastern Christianity|Matins]] or Orthros || Morning watches, ending at dawn || The Lord having given us not only daylight but spiritual light, Christ the Savior\n|-\n|Prote Ora ({{lang|grc|\u03a0\u03c1\u1ff6\u03c4\u03b7 \u1f6d\u03c1\u03b1}}) || [[Prime (liturgy)#Eastern Christianity|First Hour]] (Prime)|| At ~6 AM || Christ's being [[Pilate's court|brought before Pilate]].\n|-\n|Trite Ora ({{lang|grc|\u03a4\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 \u1f6d\u03c1\u03b1}}) || [[Terce#Eastern Christian Office|Third Hour]] (Terce)|| At ~9 AM || Pilate's judgement of Christ and the descent of the [[Holy Spirit]] at [[Pentecost#New Testament|Pentecost]], which happened at this hour.\n|-\n|Ekte Ora ({{lang|grc|\u1f1d\u03ba\u03c4\u03b7 \u1f6d\u03c1\u03b1}}) || [[Sext#Eastern Christian Office|Sixth Hour]] (Sext) || At noon || [[Christ's crucifixion]], which happened at this hour\n|-\n|Ennate Ora ({{lang|grc|\u1f18\u03bd\u03bd\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7 \u1f6d\u03c1\u03b1}}) || [[None (liturgy)#Eastern Christian Office|Ninth Hour]] (None) || At ~3 PM || Christ's death which happened at this hour.\n|-\n| Typica ({{lang|grc|\u03c4\u03c5\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac}}) ''or'' Pro-Liturgy<ref name=\"Sokolof, p 93\">Sokolof, p 93</ref>|| [[Typica]] || follows sixth or ninth hour|| .\n|}\n\nThe '''[[Typica]]''' is served whenever the [[Divine Liturgy]] is not celebrated at its usual time, i.e., when there is a vesperal Liturgy or no Liturgy at all. On days when the Liturgy may be celebrated at its usual hour, the Typica follows the sixth hour (or Matins, where the custom is to serve the Liturgy then) and the Epistle and Gospel readings for the day are read therein;<ref group=note>The Typica has a certain correspondence to the [[Missa Sicca]] of the Mediaeval West.</ref></blockquote> otherwise, on [[aliturgical days]] or when the Liturgy is served at vespers, the Typica has a much shorter form and is served between the ninth hour and vespers.<ref name=\"Sokolof, p 93\"/>\n\nAlso, there are [[Inter-Hours]] for the First, Third, Sixth and Ninth Hours. These are services of a similar structure to, but briefer than, the hours. their usage varies with local custom, but generally they are used only during the Nativity Fast, Apostles Fast, and Dormition Fast on days when the lenten alleluia replaces \"God is the Lord\" at matins, which may be done at the discretion of the [[ecclesiarch]] when the Divine Liturgy is not celebrated.\n\nIn addition to these public prayers, there are also private prayers prescribed for both monastics and laypersons; in some monasteries, however, these are read in church. These include Morning and Evening Prayers and prayers (and, in Russia, [[canon (hymnography)|canons]]) to be prayed in preparation for receiving the [[Eucharist]].\n\nThe full cycle of services are usually served only in monasteries, cathedrals, and other [[Katholikon|katholika]]. In monasteries and parishes of the Russian tradition, the Third and Sixth Hours are read during the [[Liturgy of Preparation|Prothesis ( Liturgy of Preparation)]]; otherwise, the Prothesis is served during Matins, the final portion of which is omitted, the [[Liturgy of the Catechumens]] commencing straightway after the [[troparion]] following the [[Great Doxology]].\n\nThe [[Midnight Office]] is seldom served in parishes churches except at the [[Easter Vigil|Paschal Vigil]] as the essential office wherein the [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|burial shroud]] is removed from the tomb and carried to the altar.\n\n===Aggregates===<!-- [[Aggregate (liturgy)]] redirects here -->\nThe sundry Canonical Hours are, in practice, grouped together into aggregates<ref>Sokolof, p 36</ref> so that there are three major times of prayer a day: Evening, Morning and Midday.<ref group=note>This is to conform with Psalm 55:17, \"Evening, morning, and noonday will I tell of it and will declare it, and He will hear my voice.\"</ref> The most common groupings are as follows:\n\n==== Ordinary days ====\n* Evening \u2013 Ninth Hour, Vespers, Compline<ref group=note>In monasteries, when there is an evening meal, compline is often separated from vespers and read after the meal; in Greek (\u03b1\u03c0\u03cc\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd/''apodeipnon'') and Slavonic (\u041f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440i\u0435/''Pov'echeriye''), the name for Compline literally means, \"After-supper.\"</ref>\n* Morning Watches \u2013 Midnight Office,<ref group=note>Midnight Office is often omitted in parish churches.</ref> Matins, First Hour\n* Morning \u2013 Third Hour, Sixth Hour, and the [[Divine Liturgy]] or [[Typica]]<ref group=note>Though the Liturgy (and Typica) are not, strictly speaking, a part of the daily cycle of services, their placement is fixed by the Typicon in relation to the daily cycle.</ref>\n\n==== Weekdays during lent ====\n* Evening \u2013 Great Compline\n* Morning Watches \u2013 Midnight Office, Matins, First Hour\n* Morning \u2013 Third Hour, Sixth Hour, Ninth Hour, [[Typica]], Vespers (sometimes with the [[Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts]] or, on the Annunciation, the Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom)\n\n==== When there is an all-night vigil ====\nOn the eves before [[Great Feasts of the Orthodox Church|Great Feasts]] and, in some traditions, on all Sundays, this grouping is used.

The cycle of canonical hours is largely monastic, primarily composed of psalm readings. The Coptic equivalent of the Byzantine ''Horologion'' is the [[Agpeya]].\n\nSeven canonical hours exist, corresponding largely to the Byzantine order, with an additional \"Prayer of the Veil\" which is said by Bishops, Priests, and Monks (something like the Byzantine [[Midnight Office]]).\n\nThe hours are chronologically laid out, each containing a theme corresponding to events in the life of Jesus Christ:\n* '''\"Midnight Praise\"''' (said in the early morning before dawn) commemorates the Second Coming of Christ. It consists of three watches, corresponding to the three stages of Christ's [[Agony in the Garden|prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane]] ( {{bibleverse||Matthew|25:1\u201313}} ).\n* '''Prime''' (dawn) is said upon waking in the morning or after the Midnight Praise the previous night. Associated with the Eternity of God, the Incarnation of Christ, and his Resurrection from the dead.\n* '''Terce''' (9 a.m.) commemorates Christ's [[Pilate's court|trial before Pilate]], the descent of the Holy Spirit at [[Pentecost]].\n* '''Sext''' (noon) commemorates the Passion of Christ.\n:Terce and Sext are prayed before each Divine Liturgy.\n* '''None''' (3 p.m.) commemorates the death of Christ on the Cross. This hour is also read during fasting days.\n* '''Vespers''' (sunset) commemorates the taking down of Christ from the Cross.\n* '''Compline''' (9 p.m. \u2013 before bedtime) commemorates the burial of Christ, the Final Judgment.\n:Vespers and Compline are both read before the Liturgy during Lent and the [[Fast of Nineveh]].\n* The '''Veil''' is reserved for bishops, priests and monks, as an examination of conscience.\n\nEvery one of the Hours follows the same basic outline:\n* Introduction, which includes the Lord's Prayer\n* Prayer of Thanksgiving\n* Psalm 50 (LXX).\n* Various Psalms\n* An excerpt from the Holy Gospel\n* Short Litanies\n* Some prayers (Only during Prime and Compline)\n* Lord Have Mercy is then chanted 41 times (representing the 39 lashes Christ received before the crucifixion, plus one for the spear in His side, plus one for the crown of thorns)\n* Prayer of \"Holy Holy Holy...\" and Lord's Prayer\n* Prayer of Absolution\n* Prayer of Every Hour\n\n== East Syriac Rite ==\nThe [[East Syriac Rite]] (also known as the Chaldean, Assyrian, or Persian Rite) has historically been used in Syria, Mesopotamia, Persia, and [[Saint Thomas Christians|Malabar]]. The nucleus of the Daily Office is of course the recitation of the Psalter. There are only three regular hours of service (Evening, Midnight, and Morning), with a rarely used Compline. When East Syriac monasteries existed (which is no longer the case) seven hours of prayer were the custom in them, and three ''hulali'' (sections) of the Psalter were recited at each service. This would accomplish the unique feat of the common recitation of the entire Psalter each day.\n\nThe present arrangement provides for seven ''hulali'' at each ferial night service, ten on Sundays, three on \"Memorials\", and the whole Psalter on Feasts of the Lord. At the evening service there is a selection of from four to seven psalms, varying with the day of the week, and also a ''Shuraya'', or short psalm, with generally a portion of [[Psalm 119|Psalm 118]], varying with the day of the fortnight. At the morning service the invariable psalms are 109, 90, 103:1\u20136, 112, 92, 148, 150, 116. On ferias and \"Memorials\" Psalm 146 is said after Psalm 148, and on ferias Psalm 1:1\u201318, comes at the end of the psalms.\n\nThe rest of the services consist of prayers, antiphons, litanies, and verses (''giyura'') inserted\u2014like the Greek [[stichera]], but more extensively\u2014between verses of psalms. On Sundays the [[Gloria in Excelsis]] and [[Benedicte (prayer)|Benedicte]] are said instead of Psalm 146. Both morning and evening services end with several prayers, a blessing, (''Khuthama'', \"Sealing\" ), the kiss of peace, and the Creed.\n\nThe variables, besides the psalms, are those of the feast or day, which are very few, and those of the day of the fortnight. These fortnights consist of weeks called \"Before\" (''Qdham'') and \"After\" (''Wathar''), according to which of the two choirs begins the service. Hence the book of the Divine Office is called ''Qdham u wathar'', or at full length ''Kthawa daqdham wadhwathar'', the \"Book of Before and After\".\n\nThe East Syriac liturgical Calendar is unique. The year is divided into periods of about seven weeks each, called ''Shawu'i''; these are Advent (called ''Subara'', \"Annunciation\"), Epiphany, Lent, Easter, the Apostles, Summer, \"Elias and the Cross\", \"Moses\", and the \"Dedication\" (''Qudash idta''). \"Moses\" and the \"Dedication\" have only four weeks each. The Sundays are generally named after the ''Shawu'a'' in which they occur, \"Fourth Sunday of Epiphany\", \"Second Sunday of the Annunciation \", etc., though sometimes the name changes in the middle of a ''Shawu'a''. Most of the \"Memorials\" (''dukhrani''), or saints' days, which have special lections, occur on the Fridays between Christmas and Lent, and are therefore movable feasts; but some, such as [[Christmas]], [[Theophany]], the [[Dormition]], and about thirty smaller days without proper readings, are on fixed days.\n\nThere are four shorter fasting periods besides the [[Great Lent]]; these are:\n* the ''Fast of Mar Zaya'' (three days after the second Sunday of the Nativity)\n* the ''Fast of the Virgins'' (after the first Sunday of the Epiphany)\n* the ''Fast of the Ninevites'' (seventy days before Easter)\n* the ''Fast of Mart Mariam'' (Our Lady) (from the first to the fourteenth of August)\n\nThe Fast of the Ninevites commemorates the repentance of Nineveh at the preaching of Jonas, and is carefully kept. Those of Mar Zaya and the Virgins are nearly obsolete. The Malabar Rite has largely adopted the Roman Calendar, and several Roman days have been added to that of the [[Chaldean Catholics]]. The Chaldean Easter coincides with that of the Eastern Orthodox Church, as the [[Julian Calendar]] is used to calculate Easter. The years are numbered, not from the birth of Christ, but from the [[Seleucid era]] (year 1 = 311 B.C.).\n\n== West Syriac Rite ==\nThe [[West Syriac Rite]], used in [[Syria]] by the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] (Jacobites) and [[Syriac Catholic Church|Syriac Rite Catholic]] is in its origin simply the old rite of [[Antioch]] in the Syriac language. The translation must have been made very early, evidently before the division in the church over [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]], before the influence of [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople]] over the Antiochian Rite had begun. No doubt as soon as Christian communities arose in the rural areas of Syria the prayers which in the cities (Antioch, Jerusalem, etc.) were said in Greek, were, as a matter of course, translated into Syriac for common use.\n\nIn accordance with [[Psalm 119]]:164, \"Seven times in the day have I praised Thee for Thy judgments, O Righteous One,\"<ref>Psalm 119:164</ref> the Syriac Orthodox Church observes seven services of prayer each day:\n* '''Evening''' or ''Ramsho'' prayer (Vespers)\n* '''Drawing of the Veil''' or ''Sootoro'', meaning \"Protection\", from Psalm 91, which is sung at this prayer, \"He who sits under the protection of the Most High\" (Compline)\n* '''Midnight''' or ''Lilyo'' prayer (Matins)\n* '''Morning''' or ''Saphro'' prayer (Prime, 6 a.m.)\n* '''Third Hour''' or ''Tloth sho`in'' prayer (Terce, 9 a.m.)\n* '''Sixth Hour''' or ''Sheth sho`in'' prayer (Sext, noon)\n* '''Ninth Hour''' or ''Tsha' sho`in'' prayer (None, 3 p.m.)\n\nThe Midnight prayer (Matins) consists of three ''qawme'' or \"watches\" (literally \"standings\"). As in other traditional rites, the ecclesiastical day begins in the evening at sunset with Vespers (''Ramsho''). Today, even in monasteries, the services are grouped together: Vespers and Compline are said together; Matins and Prime are said together; and the Third, Sixth and Ninth Hours are said together; resulting in three times of prayer each day.\n\nThe Syriac Orthodox Book of Hours is called the ''Shhimo'', \"simple prayer.\" The ''shhimo'' has offices for the canonical hours for each day of the week. Each canonical office begins and ends with a ''qawmo'', a set of prayers that includes the [[Lord's Prayer]]. At the end of the office, the [[Nicene Creed]] is recited. The great part of the office consists of lengthy liturgical poems composed for the purpose, similar to the Byzantine [[Canon (hymnography)|odes]].\n\n== Armenian Rite ==\nThe Daily Services in the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] and the [[Armenian Catholic Church]] are made up of nine services. The daily cycle of prayer begins with the Night Service, according to the ancient belief that a new day begins at nightfall.\n\nThe '''Night Service''' (midnight) Dedicated to the praising of [[God the Father]]. Themes of the service are: thanksgiving to God for the blessing of sleep and asking that the remainder of the night pass in peace and tranquility, and that the next day be spent in purity and righteousness.\n\nThe '''Morning Service''' (dawn) Dedicated to the praising of [[God the Son]]. Symbolizes the Resurrection of Christ and his appearance to the [[Myrrh-bearing Women]].\n\nThe '''Sunrise Service''' (6:00&nbsp;a.m.)<ref group=note>Originally, the Sunrise Service was joined to the Morning Service.</ref> Dedicated to the praising of the [[Holy Spirit]]. Symbolizes the appearance to Christ to the disciples after the Resurrection.\n\nThe '''Third Hour''' (9:00&nbsp;a.m.) Dedicated to the Holy Spirit. Symbolizes Eve's original tasting the forbidden fruit and eventual liberation from condemnation through Jesus Christ. The service has a profound penitential meaning.\n\nThe '''Sixth Hour''' (noon) Dedicated to God the Father. Symbolizes Christ's Crucifixion. The prayers at the service ask for God's help towards feeble human nature.\n\nThe '''Ninth Hour''' (3:00&nbsp;p.m.) Dedicated to God the Son. Symbolizes Christ's death and liberation of humanity from the power of the Hell.\n\nThe '''Evening Service''' (before sunset) Dedicated to God the Son. Symbolizes Christ's burial, asks God for a quiet night and a peaceful sleep.\n\nThe '''Peace Service''' (after sunset) Dedicated to the Holy Spirit. Symbolizes Christ's descent into Hell and liberation of the righteous from torments.\n\nThe '''Rest Service''' (before retiring for sleep) Dedicated to God the Father. In early times it was the continuation of the Peace Service.\n\nIn ancient times all nine services were offered every day, especially in monasteries. At present the following services are conducted in churches daily for the majority of the year:\n* In the morning: Night and Morning Services together\n* In the evening: Evening Service\n\nDuring [[Great Lent]], all of the services are offered on weekdays (except Saturday and Sunday) according to the following schedule:\n* In the morning: Night, Morning and Sunrise Services\n* In the afternoon: Third, Sixth, Ninth Hours\n* In the evening:\n** Monday, Tuesday, Thursday: Peace Service\n** Wednesday, Friday: Rest Service\n** Saturday, Sunday: Evening Service\n\nThe book which contains the hymns which constitute the substance of the musical system of [[Armenian chant|Armenian liturgical chant]] is the ''Sharagnots'' (see [[Octoechos (liturgy)#Armenian Usage|Armenian Octoechos]]), a collection of hymns known as ''Sharakan''. Originally, these hymns were [[Psalms]] and biblical [[Canticle]]s that were chanted during the services, similar to the Byzantine [[Canon (hymnography)|Canon]]. In addition, the eight modes are applied to the psalms of the Night office, called ''ganonaklookh'' (Canon head).\n\n== Anglican usage ==\n{{Main|Daily Office (Anglican)}}\n[[File:Anglican Breviary.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Anglican Rosary]] sitting atop [[Anglican Breviary|The Anglican Breviary]] and [[The Book of Common Prayer]]]]\n\nThe daily offices have always had an important place in Anglican spirituality. Until comparatively recently Mattins and Evensong were the principal Sunday services in most Anglican churches, sung to settings by composers both ancient and modern. While Evensong with its musical repertory spanning five centuries continues to play an important role in Anglican worship, the [[eucharist]] has replaced Morning Prayer as the principal service on Sunday mornings in most Anglican parishes and cathedrals.\n\nThe [[Book of Common Prayer]], first published in 1549 and revised down the centuries, constitutes the basis of the liturgy for [[Anglicans]] and [[Anglican Use]] Roman Catholics. All Anglican prayer books provide offices for [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|Morning Prayer]] (often called Mattins or Matins) and [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evening Prayer]] (colloquially known as Evensong).<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://anglicanhistory.org/liturgy/clarke_evensong.html|title=Evensong Explained, with Notes on Matins and the Litany|last=Lowther Clarke|first=W. K.|publisher=SPCK|year=1922|location=London}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional structure of Matins and Evensong in most Anglican prayer books reflects the intention by the reforming Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Thomas Cranmer]], to return to the office's older roots as the daily prayer of parish churches. For this purpose, he eliminated the lesser hours and conflated the medieval offices of Matins and Lauds, incorporating the canticles associated with each: the [[Benedictus (Song of Zechariah)|Benedictus]] and [[Te Deum]]. Similarly, Evening Prayer incorporated both the [[Magnificat]] from Vespers and the [[Nunc Dimittis]] from Compline. In Cranmer's design, each canticle was preceded by a reading from scripture. This parallelism of two readings, each followed by a canticle, is a distinctive feature of the Anglican daily office. For the sake of simplicity, Cranmer also eliminated [[responsory|responsories]] and [[antiphon]]s, although these have been restored in many contemporary Anglican prayer books. Since his time, every edition of the Book of Common Prayer has included the complete psalter, usually arranged to be read over the course of a month. One distinctive contribution of Anglican worship is a broad repertory of [[Anglican Chant]] settings for the psalms and canticles.\n\nSince the early 20th century, revised editions of the Book of Common Prayer or supplemental service books published by Anglican churches have often added offices for midday prayer and [[Compline]]. In England and other Anglican provinces, service books now include four offices:\n* [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|Morning Prayer]], corresponding to [[Matins]] and [[Lauds]].\n* [[Prayer During the Day]], conflating the lesser hours of [[Terce]], [[Sext]], and [[None (liturgy)|None]].\n* [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evening Prayer]], corresponding to [[Vespers]].\n* [[Compline|Night Prayer, or Compline]].\n\nSome prayer books also include a selection of prayers and devotions specifically for family use. The 1979 Book of Common Prayer of the Episcopal Church in the U.S. also provides an \"Order of Worship for the Evening\" as a prelude to Evensong with blessings for the lighting of candles and the singing of the ancient Greek lamp-lighting hymn, the [[Phos Hilaron]]. In the [[Church of England]], the publication in 2005 of ''Daily Prayer'', the third volume of [[Common Worship]], adds \"Prayer During the Day\" to the services for Morning Prayer, Evening Prayer and Compline, and adds a selection of antiphons and responsories for the seasons of the [[Church Year]]. The 1989 New Zealand Prayer Book provides different outlines for Mattins and Evensong on each day of the week, as well as \"Midday Prayer,\" \"Night Prayer,\" and \"Family Prayer.\" In 1995, the [[Episcopal Church (United States)]] published the ''Contemporary Office Book'' in one volume with the complete psalter and all readings from the two-year Daily Office lectionary.\n\nMost Anglican monastic communities use a Daily Office based on the Book of Common Prayer or on Common Worship but with additional antiphons and devotions. The [[Order of the Holy Cross]] and [[Order of St. Helena]] published ''A Monastic Breviary'' (Wilton, Conn.: Morehouse-Barlow) in 1976. The Order of St. Helena published the ''St. Helena Breviary'' (New York: Church Publishing) in 2006 with a revised psalter eliminating male pronouns in reference to God. The [[All Saints Sisters of the Poor]] also use an elaborated version of the Anglican Daily Office. The [[Society of St. Francis]] publishes ''Celebrating Common Prayer'', which has become especially popular for use among Anglicans.\n\nSome [[Anglo-Catholics]] use the [[Anglican Breviary]], an adaptation of the Pre-Vatican II Roman Rite and the [[Sarum Rite]] in the style of Cranmer's original Book of Common Prayer, along with supplemental material from other western sources, including a common of Octaves, a common of Holy Women, and other material. It provides for the eight historical offices in one volume, but does not include the [[Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary]], which was bound along with many editions of the ''Breviarium Romanum''. Other Anglo-Catholics use the Roman Catholic ''Liturgy of the Hours'' (US) or ''Divine Office'' (UK). Various Anglican adaptations of pre-Vatican II Roman office-books have appeared over the years, among the best known being Canon W. Douglas' translation of the 'Monastic Diurnal' into the idiom of the 'Book of Common Prayer'.\n\nHistorically, Anglican clergy have vested in [[cassock]], [[surplice]] and [[tippet]] for Morning and Evening Prayer, while bishops wear the [[rochet]] and [[chimere]]. In some monastic communities and Anglo-Catholic parishes, the officiant wears surplice or [[alb]], stole and [[cope]] when Evensong is celebrated solemnly.\n\nThe canons of the Church of England and some other Anglican provinces require clergy to read Morning and Evening Prayer daily, either in public worship or privately. According to Canon C.24, \"Every priest having a cure of souls shall provide that, in the absence of reasonable hindrance, Morning and Evening Prayer daily and on appointed days the Litany shall be said in the church, or one of the churches, of which he is the minister.\"<ref>Canon C.24</ref> Canon C.26 stipulates that \"Every clerk (cleric) in Holy Orders is under obligation, not being let (prevented) by sickness or some other urgent cause, to say daily the Morning and Evening Prayer....\"<ref>Canon C.26</ref> In other Anglican provinces, the Daily Office is not a canonical obligation but is strongly encouraged.\n\n== Methodist usage ==\n[[File:Methodist canonical hours.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A Lukan Book of Hours (in purple) and The Book of Offices and Services (in red), both liturgical texts of [[Order of St. Luke|The Order of Saint Luke]], a Methodist religious order]]\nF. W. Macdonald, the biographer of [[John Fletcher Hurst|The Rt. Rev. John Fletcher Hurst]], stated that Oxford Methodism \"with its almost monastic rigors, its living by rule, its canonical hours of prayer, is a fair and noble phase of the many-sided life of the Church of England\".<ref name=\"Hurst1902\">{{cite book|last=Hurst|first=John Fletcher|title=The History of Methodism|year=1902|publisher=Eaton & Mains|pages=310\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional 1784 Methodist Daily Office is contained in ''The Sunday Service of the Methodists'', which was written by [[John Wesley]] himself. It was consequently updated in the ''Book of Offices'', published in 1936 in Great Britain, and ''[[The United Methodist Book of Worship (1992)|The United Methodist Book of Worship]]'', published in 1992 in the United States.<ref name=\"Bradshaw2013\">{{cite book|last=Bradshaw|first=Paul F.|title=New SCM Dictionary of Liturgy and Worship|date=April 2013|publisher=Hymns Ancient and Modern Ltd|isbn=978-0-334-04932-6|page=82|quote=The Church in 1935 approved ''Divine Worship'' (versions of morning prayer, other services and numerous collects) and in 1936 authorized the ''Book of Offices'' and, bound in with it, the ''Order for Morning Prayer'': both still exhibited connections to the ''BCP'' and thus Wesley's orders, though the former showed a willingness to include newly composed prayers and those borrowed from other Free Church sources.}}<!--|accessdate=2 May 2015--></ref> Some Methodist religious orders publish the Daily Office to be used for that community, for example, ''The Book of Offices and Services of The Order of Saint Luke'' contains [[Lauds|Morning]], [[Terce|Mid-Morning]], [[Sext|Noon]], [[Nones (liturgy)|Mid-Afternoon]], [[Vespers|Evening]], [[Compline]] and [[Vigil]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Book of Offices and Services|date=6 September 2012|publisher=[[Order of St. Luke]]}}</ref>\n\n== Liberal Catholic usage ==\nThe [[Liberal Catholic Church]], and many groups in the [[Liberal Catholic movement]], also use a simple version of the Western canonical hours, said with various scripture reading and collects. According to the ''Liturgy of the Liberal Catholic Church,'' the Scriptures used are generally limited to the readings of the day, and the complete psalter is not incorporated unless at the discretion of the priest presiding, if as a public service, or of the devotee in private use. The Hours of the Liberal Rite consist of: Lauds, Prime, Sext, Vespers, and Complin. Its recitation is not obligatory on Liberal Catholic priests or faithful, according to current directs from the General Episcopal Synod.\n\n== Reformed and Lutheran usage ==\nSome Reformed churches\u2014notably the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]] and the [[United Church of Christ]]\u2014have published daily office books adapted from the ancient structure of morning and evening prayer in the Western church, usually revised for the purpose of [[inclusive language]].\n\n''The New Century Psalter'', published in 1999 by The Pilgrim Press, includes an inclusive-language revision of the psalms adapted from the [[New Revised Standard Version]] of the Bible with refrains and complete orders for Morning and Evening Prayer. Simple family prayers for morning, evening and the close of day are also provided.\n\n''Book of Common Worship Daily Prayer'', published in 1994 by [[Westminster John Knox Press]], includes the daily offices from [[The Book of Common Worship of 1993]], the liturgy of the [[Presbyterian Church USA]]. In addition to Morning and Evening Prayer there is a complete service for Compline. Its psalter\u2014an inclusive-language revision of the psalter from the 1979 American [[Book of Common Prayer]]\u2014also includes a collect for each psalm. Antiphons and litanies are provided for the seasons of the church year. A new ''Book of Common Worship Daily Prayer'' with expanded content was published in 2018. It adds a service for Mid-Day Prayer. Its new psalter is from [[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]].\n\nBoth books are intended for ecumenical use and can be used with any daily lectionary.\n\nLutheran worship books usually include orders for Morning and Evening Prayer as well as Compline. English-language liturgies published by immigrant Lutheran communities in North America were based at first on the [[Book of Common Prayer]]. In recent years, under the impact of [[liturgical movement|the liturgical movement]], Lutheran churches have restored the historic form of the Western office. Both ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]]'' published by the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada]] as well as the ''[[Lutheran Service Book]]'' of the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]] provide daily offices along with a complete psalter.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Plenarium]]\n* [[Salah times]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=note|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* {{Citation\n|year = 1907\n|title  =\u0422v\u043f\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0301\u043d\u044a \u0441\u0456\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0301\u0432\u044a (Title here transliterated into Russian; actually in Church Slavonic) (The Typicon which is the Order)\n|publisher = \u0421\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0442\u0438\u043f\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u044f (The Synodal Printing House)\n|publication-place = \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430 (Moscow, Russian Empire)\n|page = 1154\n}}\n* {{Citation\n|year=1992\n|publication-date=1997\n|title=The Unabbreviated Horologion\n|place=[[Jordanville, New York]]\n|publisher=[[Holy Trinity Monastery (Jordanville, New York)|Holy Trinity Monastery]]\n}}\n* [http://www.orthlib.info/Chasoslov/Chasoslov.html On-line text (in [[Church Slavonic]] \u0427\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432 \u2013 Chasoslov, Horologion, Retrieved 31 December 2011]\n* {{Citation\n|author=Saint [[Symeon of Thessaloniki]]\n|others=Translated by Harry L.N.

{"title_page": "Larry Ochs", "text_new": "{{For|the jazz saxophonist|Larry Ochs (musician)}}\n[[File:LarryPortrait001e.jpg|alt=Mayor Larry Ochs|thumb|Larry Ochs]]\n\n== '''Highlights''' ==\nLawrence (Larry) David Ochs (March 9, 1924 \u2013 April 23, 2003) was the last mayor of Colorado Springs, Colorado to be elected by the city council. He served on the Colorado Springs City Council from 1967 to 1975 and was mayor from 1975 to 1979. Since then, the mayor has been elected by popular vote. He also served four years as a member of the Colorado Springs Planning Commission, the last two years as Chairman. \n\nLarry Ochs was born in Russell, Kansas, and was good friends with former Senator Bob Dole, who said about Ochs: \u201cLarry was about my age, so we became close friends. He joined me as a member of the Kappa Sigma fraternity at KU. I knew the Ochs family well, and they were a big asset to our community. Harlan, Larry, Ruth, Donald and Kenny were all wonderful role models for the younger children in Russell.\u201d\n\nHe moved his family to Colorado Springs in 1956, where he founded Acorn Petroleum Inc. with his three brothers.\n\nDuring the Viet Nam war, Larry actively worked for better treatment and the release of U.S. prisoners and was sent as a delegate to Paris for that purpose. In 1976 he participated in the Air Force Chaplain Visitation Program in Greece, Crete and Turkey where he carried a message of Christian love, hope and concern to our troops and their families. \n\nOchs was a long-time member of the First United Methodist Church, downtown Kiwanis Club, El Paso Club, Winter Night Club, and Pikes Peak Ranger Riders who awarded him their highest honor, the Silver Spur Award in 2002 for extraordinary service to the community. After his death, the City Council of Colorado Springs named a new city sports complex to be built in the Briargate area after him. \n\nAs Mayor, Ochs played a key role in bringing the U.S. Olympic Training Center to Colorado Springs. He oversaw annexation of the southwest area of Colorado Springs and the first delivery of water from Pueblo Reservoir to Colorado Springs and helped bring a propane storage facility to town.\n\nIn the early 1970's, the Ochs brothers purchased the old train depot on Sierra Madre and converted it into a restaurant (Giuseppe's Old Depot Restaurant), shops and offices, and the headquarters for Acorn Petroleum, Inc. \n\n== '''Early Life''' ==\nLarry was born on March 24, 1924 in Russell, KS \u2013 the second of five children of David and Matilda Emma (Strecker) Ochs. Larry grew up in Russell where his father was a pioneer Chevrolet dealer. He received his education in Russell public schools where he excelled academically as well as in music, oratory, debate, basketball and student government. He became a member of Trinity Methodist Church which in later years he would credit with having a profound effect on his character. Larry became an Eagle Scout, mixing his activities with his work at his father\u2019s auto dealership. \n\nIn the fall of 1942, he enrolled at the University of Kansas and became a member of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity which later would induct him into its Hall of Fame. Larry and Bob Dole had been schoolmates since the first grade and continued that relationship into college. 1943 saw Larry\u2019s induction into the army, subsequent officer\u2019s commission through OCS and overseas service until he was relieved from active duty in 1946.  \n\nLarry married Martha (Marti) Lou Norton on September 4, 1946, then returned to KU where he graduated in 1948. On February 12, 1948, the birth of Stephen Drew Ochs blessed this couple. Out of college, Larry went to work for Prudential Insurance Company in Lawrence, then Wichita, Kansas, where on March 21, 1951, David Norton Ochs joined the family. Both sons were highly allergic to wheat spores which prompted a move to Colorado Springs and a more hospitable climate in 1955.\n\n== '''Middle Life''' ==\nIn Colorado Springs, Larry joined with brothers Harlan, Kenneth and Donald Ochs in a business partnership and opened the PDQ Car Wash in Colorado Springs, followed by launching Acorn Petroleum in 1959. More than 60 years later, the third generation of the Ochs family is still operating the company. Headquartered in Colorado Springs, CO, Acorn Petroleum is a leading distributor of oil, fuel, chemicals, lubricants and filters in the Colorado Front Range urban corridor. \n\nIn 1967, Larry was elected to the Colorado Springs City Council. \n\nIn 1970, Larry was named Vice Mayor under Mayor Eugene McCleary. \n\nIn December 1970, Vice Mayor Larry Ochs traveled to Paris with a League of Wives delegation and attempted to meet with North Vietnamese representatives. They delivered 125,000 letters of support for the POWS to the North Vietnamese Embassy with the assistance of King Hussein of Jordan and the Jordanian Embassy. Throughout the war, Larry supported the POW-MIA cause. \n\n\u201cLarry responded to requests by several women in Colorado Springs whose husbands were missing in action or prisoners of war,\u201d said brother Harlan Ochs. \u201cHe made the trip to Paris at his own expense and on his own time. He went above and beyond the call of duty.\u201d\n\nIn 1975, Larry was elected Mayor by the Colorado Springs City Council, the last mayor to be elected by City Council rather than popular vote. As mayor, Larry worked aggressively to expand business and other opportunities for Colorado Springs. He played an instrumental role in courting the United States Olympic Committee (USOC), and facilitated the arrangements that brought USOC to Colorado Springs, where the USOC moved into the campus that formerly was the home of Ent Air Force Base in downtown Colorado Springs. Larry enthusiastically supported the \u201csister city\u201d relationship with Fujiyoshida, Japan (which began in 1962), and facilitated goodwill visits between the officials of both cities. He led the city in the airport expansion, building of a new propane storage facility to ease the natural gas shortage, further procurement of water rights and development of water storage, transmission and treatment facilities \u2013 crucial to the expansion and growth of the city\u2019s population and businesses. \n\nIn 1977, a devastating tragedy struck with the untimely death of Marti. Larry remarried in 1978 to Jean Mitchell, a widow from Dallas. Larry was acquainted with Jean and her late husband, Gene Ronald Mitchell (who also died in 1977) through mutual friends. As he finished his term as mayor, Larry and Jean began to travel extensively, visiting numerous countries including Russia, China, India, Israel, England, France, Turkey, South America, Africa and Canada, and many parts of the United States.  \n\n== '''Later Life''' ==\nFrom 1979 to 2003, Larry and Jean lived a quiet life in Colorado Springs. Out of politics, Larry continued to manage Acorn Petroleum with his brothers, participated in the Pikes Peak Range Riders, and was an active member of the First United Methodist Church in Colorado Springs. Larry was a loving husband, father, stepfather and grandfather. \n\nIn 1996, Jean was diagnosed with colon cancer, and underwent a treatment program that included chemotherapy, radiation, and extensive surgery. Larry was devoted to her care, spending months away from home at the Mayo Clinic, and attending to Jean\u2019s care at home. \n[[File:Larry and Jean Ochs 2.jpg|thumb|Larry and Jean Ochs]] \n\n== '''Illness and Death''' ==\nIn 2001, Larry was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis, a disease of the lungs that is typically incurable and fatal. He succumbed to the disease on April 23, 2003 at the age of 79. Larry was preceded in death by his parents, his sister Ruth (Ochs) Wolfe and his first wife Martha Lou (Norton) Ochs. He was survived by his wife Jean; his daughter, Carol (Charles) Stowell; his sons, Dr. Stephen (Gretchen) Ochs and David (Linda) Ochs; by his brothers, Harlan (Alice Ann), Kenneth (Dolores) and Don (Shirley) Ochs.\n\n== '''Legacy''' ==\nLarry believed in the Biblical admonition, \"To whom much is given, much will be required\u201d (Luke 12:48). He felt that he had been so richly blessed by his Lord, his family, his friends, his community and his nation that he worked unceasingly through his efforts and his philanthropy to repay a part of the wonderful gifts that had been granted to him.\n\n=='''References'''==\nhttps://www.kuendowment.org/News-Stories/KU-Giving-Magazine/Fall-2017-Issue-25/Voices-of-Freedom\n\nhttps://gazette.com/news/commentary-on-the-demolition-of-olympic-house-and-what-it/article_31087d94-0b88-5e73-9214-b902753f845c.html\n<br />{{reflist}}\n\n=='''External links'''==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110616054559/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4191/is_20030409/ai_n10021489/]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110616054618/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4191/is_20030424/ai_n10018066/]\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{S-off\n}}\n{{S-bef\n| before = Eugene McCleary\n}}\n{{S-ttl\n| title = [[Colorado Springs, Colorado#Colorado Springs City Government|Mayors of Colorado Springs]]\n| years = 1967 &ndash; 1975\n}}\n{{S-aft\n| after = [[Robert M.

It was built by [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]]-based Talon International Development Inc., which is owned by Canadian businessmen Val Levitan and [[Alex Shnaider]]. The hotel portion of the building is owned by InnVest Hotels LP, which acquired it in 2017.<ref name=InnVest/>\n\nThe building is located in Toronto's [[Financial District, Toronto|Financial District]], at 325 [[Bay Street]], on the southeast corner of Bay and Adelaide streets. Including the [[spire]], it is the [[List of tallest buildings in Canada|second-tallest building in Canada]], the [[List of tallest buildings in Toronto|tallest mixed-use building in Toronto]] and the [[List of tallest structures in Canada|fourth-tallest structure in Toronto]], as of 2020.\n\nAfter it opened in 2012 as the '''Trump International Hotel and Tower Toronto''', the hotel was controversial for its affiliation with [[Donald Trump]], who was a real estate developer at the time, later the [[President of the United States]]. In 2017, this affiliation led to calls from the public for the hotel to drop its Trump branding following the president's [[Executive Order 13769]], which restricted people from a number of predominantly Muslim countries from traveling to the United States.\n\n[[The Trump Organization]], a company owned by the [[Trump family]], previously held the management contract for the hotel and was a minority shareholder in the project. The management contract was bought out by JCF Capital in June 2017, and the hotel portion of the building was then purchased by InnVest Hotels LP, a subsidiary of Bluesky Hotels and Resorts.<ref name=InnVest>{{cite web |title=InnVest Hotels acquires former Trump Tower in Toronto |url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2017/06/29/innvest-hotels-acquires-former-trump-tower-in-toronto.html |website=The Toronto Star |accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref> The hotel management shifted to [[Marriott International]], which operated it on an unbranded basis as '''The Adelaide Hotel Toronto''' during renovations.<ref name=Nast>{{cite web |url=https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/canada/toronto/trump-international-hotel---tower-toronto |title=The Adelaide Hotel Toronto \u2013 Hotel Review |work=Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller |date=2018 |accessdate=2020-04-14}}</ref> After the renovations were completed, the hotel became part of Marriott's [[St. Regis Hotels & Resorts]] on 28 November 2018, adopting its present name.<ref>{{cite web |title=St. Regis Hotels and Resorts Marks Canadian Debut at The Best Address in Toronto |url=https://news.marriott.com/2018/11/st-regis-hotels-and-resorts-marks-canadian-debut-at-the-best-address-in-toronto/ |website=news.marriott.com |accessdate=November 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Specifications ==\n[[File:Trump Toronto entrance at night.JPG|left|thumb|Main entrance on Adelaide Street]]\n[[File:Trump Tower viewed from exec office Toronto-Dominion Building during 2011 Doors Open Toronto.jpg|thumb|left|The building under construction in May 2011.]]\nThe tower has 65 storeys, 57 occupiable floors, is {{convert|276.9|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall,<ref name=\"skyscraper\">{{cite web| title=Trump International Hotel & Tower Toronto| url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=6167| publisher=SkyscraperPage.com| accessdate=August 16, 2013}}</ref> and is clad with a steel, glass, and stone facade.

Suite prices started at [[Canadian dollar|C$]]1.2 million. There are 4-6 suites per floor. Residents have a separate entrance and elevators from hotel guests.\n\nBuilders planned to connect the building to Toronto's underground [[PATH (Toronto)|PATH]] network, however this plan was dropped because of the high costs associated with tunnelling under the city.<ref name=\"digital\">{{cite news| title=Trump opens his latest hotel in Toronto| url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/318854| work=Digital Journal| last=Mullins| first=KJ| date=February 1, 2012| accessdate=August 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Rivalry with Sapphire Tower===\nDeveloper [[Harry Stinson]] intended to create a friendly rivalry with Trump for the tallest mixed-use building in Canada with the [[Sapphire Tower]]. As a result, the planned heights of both projects were revised several times in an attempt to outdo each other, and Stinson's skyscraper would have been 17 metres taller in its last design. However, the Sapphire Tower failed to gain approval of city council, in part because it would have cast a shadow over [[Toronto City Hall]]'s [[Nathan Phillips Square]], and its development company filed for bankruptcy in 2007. At that time, the Trump Tower's design was also scaled back and the height was reduced because of the real estate market slowdown.<ref name=\"wong\">{{cite news| title=Condo king files for bankruptcy protection| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/2007/03/09/condo_king_files_for_bankruptcy_protection.html| last=Wong| first=Tony| work=[[Toronto Star]]| date=March 9, 2007| accessdate=August 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Construction===\nThe building was built on a previously vacant lot, used only for parking, between [[Scotia Plaza]] and [[The National Club]]. Lewis Builds Corporation, a construction and development manager in [[downtown Toronto]], was the construction manager for this project.\n\nOn March 23, 2007, Talon International Development Incorporated of [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]] announced that it had reached an agreement with international bank [[Raiffeisen Zentralbank|Raiffeisen Zentralbank \u00d6sterreich AG]] (RZB) to arrange C$310 million in construction financing for its Trump International Hotel & Tower development.\n\nConstruction began with the removal of the sales centre in September 2007. The official groundbreaking was on October 12, 2007. The hotel portion of the tower was planned to be completed in late 2011. The tower was projected to be completed in early 2012. The building topped out in early September 2011, and the spire was raised on September 24, 2011. The hotel opened for business on January 31, 2012, and its grand opening occurred on April 16, 2012.<ref name=\"urbantor\">{{cite web|title=Putting The Finishing Touches on Trump International as Official Launch Date Arrives|url=http://urbantoronto.ca/news/2012/04/putting-finishing-touches-trump-international-official-launch-date-arrives#disqus_thread|date=April 13, 2012|website=urbantoronto.ca|publisher=UrbanToronto.ca|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}</ref> Work on the top of the building continued until completion in July 2012 with the activation of two high-intensity [[aircraft warning lights]].\n\n==Issues and controversies==\n===Investor disputes===\nIn May 2017, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that Russian state-owned [[Vnesheconombank]] (VEB) provided financing for the construction of the hotel in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |title=Russian State-Run Bank Financed Deal Involving Trump Hotel Partner |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-state-run-bank-financed-deal-involving-trump-hotel-partner-1495031708 |website=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=May 17, 2017|access-date=March 6, 2018 |last1=Barry |first1=Rob |last2=Stewart |first2=Christopher S. |last3=Forrest |first3=Brett}}</ref> According to the [[Panama Papers]], in 2010, Shnaider sold at least half of [[Midland Group]]'s ownership in the [[Zaporizhstal]] steel mill to buyers financed by VEB, who were then themselves acquired by the bank.<ref name=NYT5june17>{{cite news|last1=Protess|first1=Ben|last2=Kramer|first2=Andrew E.|last3=McIntire|first3=Mike|title=Bank at Center of U.S. Inquiry Projects Russian \u2018Soft Power\u2019|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/04/business/vnesheconombank-veb-bank-russia-trump-kushner.html|accessdate=June 5, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 5, 2017|page=A1}}</ref>  Shnaider then used proceeds from the sale to partially meet cost overruns at the Tower.<ref name=NYT5june17/>  Shnaider's lawyer told ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' that $15 million from the sale to the Russian bank went into the tower, and then recanted.<ref name=NYT5june17/> \n\nThe tower has been controversial since its opening because of lower than expected occupancy rates in the \"hotel-condo\" portion of the building that led to a legal battle between real estate investors and Talon International Development.

It was built by [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]]-based Talon International Development Inc., which is owned by Canadian businessmen Val Levitan and [[Alex Shnaider]]. The hotel portion of the building is owned by InnVest Hotels LP, which acquired it in 2017.<ref name=InnVest/>\n\nThe building is located in Toronto's [[Financial District, Toronto|Financial District]], at 325 [[Bay Street]], on the southeast corner of Bay and Adelaide streets. Including the [[spire]], it is the [[List of tallest buildings in Canada|second-tallest building in Canada]], the [[List of tallest buildings in Toronto|tallest mixed-use building in Toronto]] and the [[List of tallest structures in Canada|fourth-tallest structure in Toronto]], as of 2020.\n\nAfter it opened in 2012 as the '''Trump International Hotel and Tower Toronto''', the hotel was controversial for its affiliation with [[Donald Trump]], who was a real estate developer at the time, later the [[President of the United States]]. In 2017, this affiliation led to calls from the public for the hotel to drop its Trump branding following the president's [[Executive Order 13769]], which restricted people from a number of predominantly Muslim countries from traveling to the United States.\n\n[[The Trump Organization]], a company owned by the [[Trump family]], previously held the management contract for the hotel and was a minority shareholder in the project. The management contract was bought out by JCF Capital in June 2017, and the hotel portion of the building was then purchased by InnVest Hotels LP, a subsidiary of Bluesky Hotels and Resorts.<ref name=InnVest>{{cite web |title=InnVest Hotels acquires former Trump Tower in Toronto |url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2017/06/29/innvest-hotels-acquires-former-trump-tower-in-toronto.html |website=The Toronto Star |accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref> The hotel management shifted to [[Marriott International]], which operated it on an unbranded basis as '''The Adelaide Hotel Toronto''' during renovations.<ref name=Nast>{{cite web |url=https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/canada/toronto/trump-international-hotel---tower-toronto |title=The Adelaide Hotel Toronto \u2013 Hotel Review |work=Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller |accessdate=2020-04-14}}</ref> After the renovations were completed, the hotel became part of Marriott's [[St. Regis Hotels & Resorts]] on 28 November 2018, adopting its present name.<ref>{{cite web |title=St. Regis Hotels and Resorts Marks Canadian Debut at The Best Address in Toronto |url=https://news.marriott.com/2018/11/st-regis-hotels-and-resorts-marks-canadian-debut-at-the-best-address-in-toronto/ |website=news.marriott.com |accessdate=November 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Specifications ==\n[[File:Trump Toronto entrance at night.JPG|left|thumb|Main entrance on Adelaide Street]]\n[[File:Trump Tower viewed from exec office Toronto-Dominion Building during 2011 Doors Open Toronto.jpg|thumb|left|The building under construction in May 2011.]]\nThe tower has 65 storeys, 57 occupiable floors, is {{convert|276.9|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall,<ref name=\"skyscraper\">{{cite web| title=Trump International Hotel & Tower Toronto| url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=6167| publisher=SkyscraperPage.com| accessdate=August 16, 2013}}</ref> and is clad with a steel, glass, and stone facade.

As a result, the planned heights of both projects were revised several times in an attempt to outdo each other, and Stinson's skyscraper would have been 17 metres taller in its last design. However, the Sapphire Tower failed to gain approval of city council, in part because it would have cast a shadow over [[Toronto City Hall]]'s [[Nathan Phillips Square]], and its development company filed for bankruptcy in 2007. At that time, the Trump Tower's design was also scaled back and the height was reduced because of the real estate market slowdown.<ref name=\"wong\">{{cite news| title=Condo king files for bankruptcy protection| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/2007/03/09/condo_king_files_for_bankruptcy_protection.html| last=Wong| first=Tony| work=[[Toronto Star]]| date=March 9, 2007| accessdate=August 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Construction===\nThe building was built on a previously vacant lot, used only for parking, between [[Scotia Plaza]] and [[The National Club]].

The official groundbreaking was on October 12, 2007. The hotel portion of the tower was planned to be completed in late 2011. The tower was projected to be completed in early 2012. The building topped out in early September 2011, and the spire was raised on September 24, 2011.

Joey confides in Steve about his feelings for Ava and is shocked to learn about Ava's past and that she may have given birth to Steve's son. Ava knocks Kayla unconscious (causing a hematoma) and kidnaps her.  Ava then coerces Steve to either have sex with her or she'll let Kayla die to which Steve agrees under duress in order to secure Kayla's release. She then gives Joey Kayla's location to free her. Steve is reunited with his family but Steve's \"betrayal\" leaves Joey angry and bitter. Learning that Ava planned on framing his mother for attempted murder (she drugged herself with morphine in Kayla's home) a drunken Joey smothers a drugged Ava in a hospital bed, with Steve willingly implicating himself in the murder.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://soapcentral.com/days/whoswho/ava.php Soapcentral.com | '''About DAYS: Who's Who in Salem''' | Ava Vitali]\n*[http://soaps.sheknows.com/daysofourlives/cast/652/Ava_Vitali/ Days of our Lives Cast - Ava Vitali]\n\n{{Navboxes\n| title = ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' related articles\n| list={{Days of Our Lives}}\n{{Days of Our Lives characters}}\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vitali, Ava}}\n[[Category:Days of Our Lives characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional mobsters]]\n[[Category:Fictional businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2008]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Ava Vitali\n| series         = Days of Our Lives\n| portrayer      = {{Plainlist |\n* [[Tamara Braun]]\n* [[Sara Fletcher]] (2017, voice)\n}}\n| first          = {{Start date|mf=yes|2008|02|08}}\n| last           = {{Plainlist |\n* March 1, 2016 (appearance)\n* April 10, 2017 (voice)\n}}\n| cause          = Death\n| years          = {{Flatlist |\n* 2008\n* 2015\u201317\n}}\n| introducer   = {{Plainlist |\n* [[Ken Corday]] and [[Edward J.

Joey confides in Steve about his feelings for Ava and is shocked to learn about Ava's past and that she may have given birth to Steve's son. Ava knocks Kayla unconscious (causing a hematoma) and kidnaps her.

Learning that Ava planned on framing his mother for attempted murder (she drugged herself with morphine in Kayla's home) a drunken Joey smothers a drugged Ava in a hospital bed, with Steve willingly implicating himself in the murder.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://soapcentral.com/days/whoswho/ava.php Soapcentral.com | '''About DAYS: Who's Who in Salem''' | Ava Vitali]\n*[http://soaps.sheknows.com/daysofourlives/cast/652/Ava_Vitali/ Days of our Lives Cast - Ava Vitali]\n\n{{Navboxes\n| title = ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' related articles\n| list={{Days of Our Lives}}\n{{Days of Our Lives characters}}\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vitali, Ava}}\n[[Category:Days of Our Lives characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional mobsters]]\n[[Category:Fictional businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2008]]\n", "name_user": "Wbm1058", "label": "safe", "comment": "Salemis a redirect, not an article.
