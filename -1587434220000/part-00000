The branches are straight, and the leaves are thin, opaque, oval, and taper at the extremities. A marked characteristic of the leaf is an areolated portion bounded by two longitudinal curved lines, one line on each side of the midrib, and more conspicuous on the under face of the leaf.\n\nThe flowers are small, and disposed in clusters on short stalks; the corolla is composed of five yellowish-white [[petal]]s, the [[anther]]s are heart-shaped, and the [[pistil]] consists of three carpels united to form a three-chambered ovary. The flowers mature into red [[berry (botany)|berries]].\n\nThe leaves are sometimes eaten by the [[larva]]e of the [[moth]] ''[[Eloria noyesi]]''.\n\n== Species and evolution ==\nThere are two species of cultivated coca, each with two varieties:\n*''[[Erythroxylum coca]]''\n**''Erythroxylum coca'' var. ''coca'' (Bolivian or [[Hu\u00e1nuco]] Coca) \u2013 well adapted to the eastern [[Andes]] of Peru and Bolivia, an area of humid, tropical, [[montane forest]].\n**''Erythroxylum coca'' var. ''ipadu'' (Amazonian Coca) \u2013 cultivated in the lowland [[Amazon Basin]] in Peru and Colombia.\n*''[[Erythroxylum novogranatense]]''\n**''Erythroxylum novogranatense'' var. ''novogranatense'' (Colombian Coca) \u2013 a highland variety that is utilized in lowland areas. It is cultivated in drier regions found in Colombia. However, ''E. novogranatense'' is very adaptable to varying ecological conditions. The leaves have parallel lines on either side of the central vein.\n**''Erythroxylum novogranatense'' var. ''truxillense'' ([[Trujillo Province, Peru|Trujillo]] Coca) \u2013 grown primarily in Peru and Colombia. the leaves of ''E. novogranatense'' var. ''truxillense'' do not have parallel lines on either side of the central vein like all other varieties.\n\nAll four of the cultivated cocas were domesticated in pre-Columbian times and are more closely related to each other than to any other species.<ref name=\"Plowman1979\"/>\n\nThere are two main theories relating to the evolution of the cultivated cocas. The first (put forth by [[Timothy Plowman|Plowman]]<ref name=\"Plowman1984\">Plowman T.  \"The Origin, Evolution, and Diffusion of Coca, Erythroxylum spp., in South and Central America.\"  In: Stone D, ed.

''coca'' are found in the eastern [[Andes]]; the other 3 [[taxon|taxa]] are only known as cultivated plants.\n\nThe two subspecies of ''[[Erythroxylum coca]]'' are almost indistinguishable phenotypically. ''[[Erythroxylum novogranatense]]'' var. ''novogranatense'' and ''[[Erythroxylum novogranatense]]'' var. ''truxillense'' are phenotypically similar, but morphologically distinguishable. Under the older [[Cronquist system]] of classifying [[flowering plant]]s, this was placed in an [[order (biology)|order]] [[Linales]]; more modern systems place it in the order [[Malpighiales]].\n\n=== Herbicide resistant varieties ===\nAlso known as ''supercoca'' or ''la millionaria'', [[Boliviana negra]] is a relatively new form of coca that is resistant to a [[herbicide]] called [[glyphosate]]. Glyphosate is a key ingredient in the multibillion-dollar aerial [[coca eradication]] campaign undertaken by the government of Colombia with U.S. financial and military backing known as [[Plan Colombia]].\n\nThe herbicide resistance of this strain has at least two possible explanations: that a \"[[peer-to-peer]]\" network of coca farmers used [[plant breeding|selective breeding]] to enhance this trait through tireless effort, or the plant was [[genetic engineering|genetically modified]] in a laboratory. In 1996, a [[biological patent|patented]] glyphosate-resistant [[soybean]] was marketed by [[Monsanto Company]], suggesting that it would be possible to genetically modify coca in an analogous manner. Spraying ''Boliviana negra'' with glyphosate would serve to strengthen its growth by eliminating the non-resistant [[weed]]s surrounding it. Joshua Davis, in the ''Wired'' article cited below, found no evidence of CP4 EPSPS, a protein produced by the glyphosate-resistant soybean, suggesting ''Bolivana negra'' was either created in a lab by a different technique or bred in the field.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=DExN86ryRuwC&dq\n|title=Evolutionary History: Uniting History and Biology to Understand Life on Earth, Edmund Russell |publisher=Cambridge University Press |accessdate=2011-03-12|isbn=978-0-521-74509-3|year=2011}}</ref><ref>{{Citation\n| last  = Davis\n| first = Joshua\n| title = The Mystery of the Coca Plant That Wouldn't Die\n| journal = WIRED\n| volume  = 12\n| issue   = 11\n| year    = 2004\n| url     = https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.11/columbia.html\n}}</ref>\n\n== Cultivation ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2018}}\n{{See also|Coca production in Colombia}}\n[[File:Colcoca01.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Coca tree in Colombia]]\n\nCoca is traditionally cultivated in the lower altitudes of the eastern slopes of the [[Andes]] (the [[Yungas]]), or the highlands depending on the species grown.

The leaves are gathered from plants varying in age from one and a half to upwards of forty years, but only the new fresh growth is harvested. They are considered ready for plucking when they break on being bent. The first and most abundant harvest is in March after the rainy season, the second is at the end of June, and the third in October or November.

As the plant was viewed as having a divine origin, its cultivation became subject to a [[state monopoly]] and its use restricted to nobles and a few favored classes (court orators, couriers, favored public workers, and the army) by the rule of the [[Topa Inca]] (1471\u20131493). As the Incan empire declined, the leaf became more widely available. After some deliberation, [[Philip II of Spain]] issued a decree recognizing the drug as essential to the well-being of the Andean Indians but urging missionaries to end its religious use. The Spanish are believed to have effectively encouraged use of coca by an increasing majority of the population to increase their labor output and tolerance for starvation, but it is not clear that this was planned deliberately.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.taironatrust.org/about-the-kogi/the-culture/logi-culture-and-cultivating-harmony|title=Tairona Heritage Trust|last=http://feastcreative.com|first=Feast Creative |website=www.taironatrust.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref>\n\nCoca was first introduced to Europe in the 16th century, but did not become popular until the mid-19th century, with the publication of an influential paper by Dr. [[Paolo Mantegazza]] praising its stimulating effects on cognition. This led to invention of [[coca wine]] and the first production of pure cocaine. Coca wine (of which [[Vin Mariani]] was the best-known brand) and other coca-containing preparations were widely sold as patent medicines and tonics, with claims of a wide variety of health benefits. The original version of [[Coca-Cola]] was among these. These products became illegal in most countries outside of South America in the early 20th century, after the addictive nature of cocaine was widely recognized.

The coca plant was also the inspiration for Bolivia's [[Coca Museum]].\n\n==Coca Use by the Incas==\n\n===Ethnohistorical Sources===\nWhile many historians are in agreement that coca was a contributing factor to the daily life of the [[Inca]], there are many different theories as to how this civilization came to adopt it as one of its staple crops and as a valued commodity. The Incas were able to accomplish significant things while stimulated by the effects of coca. The Incas did not have a graphical written language, but used the ''[[quipu]]'', a fiber recording device. [[Ethnohistory|Ethnohistoric]] Spanish documents make it clear that coca was one of the most important elements of Inca culture. Coca was used in Inca feasts and religious rituals, among many other things.<ref>Mortimer, W. Golden. Peru History of Coca: \"The Divine Plant\" of the Incas. New York: J. H. Vail & Company, 1901.</ref> It was a driving factor in the labor efforts that Inca kings asked of their citizens, and also used to barter for other goods. Coca was vital to the Inca civilization and its culture. The Incas valued coca so much that they colonized tropical rain forests to the north and east of their capital in [[Cuzco]] so that they could increase and control their supply. The Incas colonized more human regions because coca cannot grow above 2600 meters in elevation (coca is not frost-resistant).<ref>Valdez, Lidio M., Juan Taboada, and J. Ernesto Valdez. 2015. \u201cAncient Use of Coca Leaves in the Peruvian Central Highlands.\u201d Journal of Anthropological Research 71 (2): 231\u201358. doi:10.3998/jar.0521004.0071.204.</ref>\n\n===Coca Use in Labor and Military Service===\nOne of the most common uses of coca during the reign of the Inca was in the context of ''[[mit'a]]'' labor, a labor tax required of all able-bodied men in the Inca empire, and also in military service. [[Pedro Cieza de Le\u00f3n]] wrote that the indigenous people of the Andes always seemed to have coca in their mouths. ''Mit'a'' laborers, soldiers, and others chewed coca to alleviate hunger and thirst while they were working and fighting. The results of this are evident in monumental construction and the successful expansion of the Inca empire through conquest. By chewing coca, laborers and soldiers were able to work harder and for longer periods. Some historians believe that coca and ''chicha'' (fermented corn beer) made it possible for the Incas to move large stones in order to create architectural masterpieces, especially ones of [[monolith|monolithic]] construction such as [[Sacsayhuaman]].<ref>Valdez, Lidio M., Juan Taboada, and J. Ernesto Valdez. 2015. \u201cAncient Use of Coca Leaves in the Peruvian Central Highlands.\u201d Journal of Anthropological Research 71 (2): 231\u201358. doi:10.3998/jar.0521004.0071.204</ref> . Many of the artifacts and statues that are found may have been the product of laborers under the effects of coca .\n\n===Coca Use in Religious Rituals===\nDue to the [[Spanish conquest]] of the Inca Empire, the Spaniards had direct access to the Inca. They had insight to their everyday lives, and it is through their lens that we learn about [[religion in the Inca empire]]. While the indigenous author [[Pedro Cieza de Le\u00f3n]] wrote about the effects coca had on the Inca, multiple Spanish men wrote about the importance of coca in their spirituality. For example [[Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa]], Father [[Bernab\u00e9 Cobo]], and Juan de Ulloa Mogoll\u00f3n noted how the Incas would leave coca leaves at important locations throughout the empire. They considered coca to be the highest form of plant offering that the Incas made.<ref>Valdez, Lidio M., Juan Taboada, and J. Ernesto Valdez. 2015. \u201cAncient Use of Coca Leaves in the Peruvian Central Highlands.\u201d Journal of Anthropological Research 71 (2): 231\u201358. doi:10.3998/jar.0521004.0071.204.</ref>\n\nThe Incas would put coca leaves in the mouths of mummies, which were a sacred part of Inca culture. Mummies of Inca emperors were regarded for their wisdom and often consulted for important matters long after the body had deteriorated. Not only did many Inca mummies have coca leaves in their mouths, but they also carried coca leaves in bags.<ref>Valdez, Lidio M., Juan Taboada, and J. Ernesto Valdez. 2015. \u201cAncient Use of Coca Leaves in the Peruvian Central Highlands.\u201d Journal of Anthropological Research 71 (2): 231\u201358. doi:10.3998/jar.0521004.0071.204.</ref> These are believed to be Inca sacrifices, and like the Aztecs, the Inca participated in sacrifices as well. It is clear that the Incas had a strong belief in the divinity of the coca leaf as there is now evidence that both the living and the dead were subjected to coca use. They even sent their sacrifices off to their death with a sacrificial bag of coca leaves. The coca leaf affected all stages of life for the Inca.\n\n===Coca Use After the Spanish Conquest===\nAfter the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire, it was time for the rest of the world to be introduced to the wonders of the coca leaf. But it was not like this at first. By many historical accounts, the Spaniards actually tried to eradicate the coca leaf from Inca life. The Spaniards saw the Incas as nothing more than slaves and laborers and did not want them to have the luxury of the coca leaf. Although the Spaniards noticed the state-controlled storage facilities that the Inca had built to distribute to its workers<ref>Valdez, Lidio M., Juan Taboada, and J. Ernesto Valdez. 2015. \u201cAncient Use of Coca Leaves in the Peruvian Central Highlands.\u201d Journal of Anthropological Research 71 (2): 231\u201358. doi:10.3998/jar.0521004.0071.204.</ref>, they were still oblivious to the affinity that the Inca had with this divine plant. Not only that, the Inca were being treated as slaves and had to do arduous work for the Spaniards. Finally, the Spaniards noticed that the Inca could not do the work without coca. Even though they were trying to push their religion onto the Inca, which did not allow them to eat before the [[Eucharist]] (the Spaniards thought coca to be food) they allowed them to continue to use coca to achieve their work.<ref>Mortimer, W. Golden. Peru History of Coca: \"The Divine Plant\" of the Incas. New York: J. H. Vail & Company, 1901.</ref> The Spanish conquest drastically altered the lives of the Inca civilization, but the Inca also altered the life of Spaniards, and quite frankly, the rest of the world. After seeing the effects and powers of coca, many Spaniards themselves starting growing and selling coca.\n\n== Traditional uses ==\n[[File:Folha de coca.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Man holding coca leaf in Bolivia]]\n\n=== Medicine ===\nTraditional medical uses of coca are foremost as a stimulant to overcome fatigue, hunger, and thirst. It is considered particularly effective against [[altitude sickness]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tni.org/en/primer/coca-leaf-myths-and-reality|title=Coca leaf: Myths and Reality|author=|date=5 August 2014|website=tni.org}}</ref> It also is used as an [[anesthetic]] and analgesic to alleviate the pain of headache, [[rheumatism]], wounds and sores, etc. Before stronger anaesthetics were available, it also was used for broken bones, childbirth, and during [[trepanning]] operations on the skull.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The high calcium content in coca explains why people used it for bone fractures.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Because coca constricts blood vessels, it also serves to oppose bleeding, and coca seeds were used for [[nosebleed]]s. Indigenous use of coca has also been reported as a treatment for [[malaria]], [[peptic ulcer|ulcers]], [[asthma]], to improve [[digestion]], to guard against bowel laxity, as an [[aphrodisiac]], and credited with improving [[longevity]]. Modern studies have supported a number of these medical applications.<ref name=\"Weil\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n=== Nutrition ===\nRaw coca leaves, chewed or consumed as tea or mate de coca, are rich in nutritional properties. Specifically, the coca plant contains essential minerals (calcium, potassium, phosphorus), vitamins ([[vitamin B1|B1]], [[vitamin B2|B2]], [[vitamin C|C]], and [[vitamin E|E]]) and nutrients such as protein and fiber.<ref>James, A., Aulick, D., Plowman, T., 1975 \"Nutritional Value of Coca\", Botanical Museum Leaflets, Harvard University 24 (6): 113\u2013119.</ref><ref>Harvard Study \u2013 Nutritional Value of Coca Leaf (Duke, Aulick, Plowman 1975)</ref>\n\n=== Religion ===\nCoca has also been a vital part of the religious cosmology of the Andean peoples of Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, northern Argentina, and Chile from the [[Pre-Inca cultures|pre-Inca period]] through to the present. Coca leaves play a crucial part in offerings to the [[apus]] (mountains), [[Inti]] (the sun), or [[Pachamama]] (the earth). Coca leaves are also often read in a form of [[divination]] analogous to [[reading tea leaves]] in other cultures. As one example of the many traditional beliefs about coca, it is believed by the miners of [[Cerro de Pasco]] to soften the veins of [[ore]], if masticated (chewed) and thrown upon them (see '''Cocomama''' in [[Inca mythology]]).{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} In addition, coca use in shamanic rituals is well documented wherever local native populations have cultivated the plant. For example, the Tayronas of Colombia's Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta would chew the plant before engaging in extended meditation and prayer.<ref name=\"banrep.gov.co\">{{cite web |author=Museo del Oro, Banco de la Republica |url=http://www.banrep.gov.co/museo/eng/expo_bogota3c.htm |title=Museo del Oro, Colombia |language=es |publisher=Banrep.gov.co |accessdate=2012-11-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511180916/http://www.banrep.gov.co/museo/eng/expo_bogota3c.htm |archivedate=2013-05-11 }}</ref>\n\n=== Traditional preparation ===\nTraditionally, coca leaves are prepared either to chew or as a tea ([[coca tea|mate de coca]]).<ref name=\"Coca Myths 2009\"/><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.tni.org/primer/coca-leaf-myths-and-reality |title=Drugs and Democracy &#124; Coca leaf: Myths and Reality\n|publisher=Tni.org |date=2011-02-18 |accessdate=2012-11-09}}</ref> \n\n==== Chew ====\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2011}}\nIn Bolivia bags of coca leaves are sold in local markets and by street vendors. The activity of chewing coca is called ''mambear'', ''chacchar'' or ''acullicar'', borrowed from [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], ''coquear'' (northern Argentina), or in Bolivia, ''picchar'', derived from the [[Aymara language]]. The Spanish ''masticar'' is also frequently used, along with the slang term \"bolear,\" derived from the word \"bola\" or ball of coca pouched in the cheek while chewing. Typical coca consumption varies between 20 and 60 grams per day,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1952-01-01_2_page009.html|title=UNODC - Bulletin on Narcotics - 1952 Issue 2 - 008|last=ZAPATA-ORTIZ|first=Vicente|website=www.unodc.org|access-date=2018-06-20}}</ref> and contemporary methods are believed to be unchanged from ancient times.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Coca is kept in a woven pouch (''[[Chuspas|chuspa]]'' or ''huallqui''). A few leaves are chosen to form a quid ''(acullico)'' held between the mouth and gums. Doing so may cause a tingling and numbing sensation in their mouths. (The formerly ubiquitous dental anaesthetic [[procaine|novocaine / procaine]] has a similar effect.)\n\nChewing coca leaves is most common in indigenous communities across the central Andean region,<ref name=\"banrep.gov.co\"/> particularly in places like the highlands of Argentina, Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru, where the cultivation and consumption of coca is a part of the national culture, similar to [[chicha]]. It also serves as a powerful symbol of indigenous cultural and religious identity, amongst a diversity of indigenous nations throughout South America.<ref name=\"banrep.gov.co\"/> [[Tobacco]] leaves were also traditionally chewed in the same way in North America, though modern [[chewing tobacco]] is typically heavily processed.\n\n[[File:Llipta on coca leaf.jpeg|thumb|''Llipta'' is used to improve extraction when chewing coca (Museo de la Coca, [[Cusco]], Peru)]]\nOne option for chewing coca is with a tiny quantity of ''ilucta'' (a preparation of the ashes of the [[quinoa]] plant) added to the coca leaves; it softens their [[astringent]] flavor and activates the [[alkaloids]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Other names for this basifying substance are ''llipta'' in Peru and the Spanish word ''lej\u00eda'', ''[[bleach]]'' in English. The consumer carefully uses a wooden stick (formerly often a spatula of precious metal) to transfer an alkaline component into the quid without touching his flesh with the corrosive substance. The alkali component, usually kept in a gourd (''ishcupuro'' or ''poporo''), can be made by burning [[limestone]] to form unslaked [[quicklime]], burning quinoa stalks, or the bark from certain trees, and may be called ''llipta'', ''tocra'' or ''mambe'' depending on its composition.<ref name=\"Petersen\"/><ref name=\"Carroll\"/> Many of these materials are salty in flavor, but there are variations. The most common base{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} in the [[La Paz]] area of Bolivia is a product known as ''lej\u00eda dulce'' (''sweet lye''), which is made from quinoa ashes mixed with [[aniseed]] and cane sugar, forming a soft black putty with a sweet and pleasing flavor. In some places, [[baking soda]] is used under the name ''bico''.\n\nIn the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]], on the Caribbean Coast of Colombia, coca is consumed<ref name=\"banrep.gov.co\"/> by the [[Kogi people|Kogi]], [[Arhuaco]], and [[Wiwa language|Wiwa]] by using a special device called [[poporo]].<ref name=\"banrep.gov.co\"/> It represents the womb and the stick is a phallic symbol. The movements of the stick in the poporo symbolize the sexual act. For a man the poporo is a good companion that means \"food\", \"woman\", \"memory\", and \"meditation\". The poporo is the mark of manhood. When a boy is ready to be married, his mother initiates him in the use of the coca. This act of initiation is carefully supervised by the Mamo, a traditional priest-teacher-leader.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nFresh samples of the dried leaves, uncurled, are a deep green colour on the upper surface, and a grey-green on the lower surface, and have a strong [[tea]]-like aroma. When chewed, they produce a pleasurable numbness in the mouth, and have a pleasant, [[Piquance|pungent]] taste. They are traditionally chewed with [[lime (material)|lime]] or some other reagent such as [[bicarbonate of soda]] to increase the release of the active ingredients from the leaf. Older species have a [[camphor]]aceous smell and a brownish color, and lack the pungent taste.\n\n==== Tea ====\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2011}}\n[[File:Mate de Coca Cusco.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A cup of ''[[mate de coca]]'' served in a coffee shop in [[Cuzco]], Peru.]]\n{{Main|Coca tea}}\nAlthough coca leaf chewing is common only among the indigenous populations,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> the consumption of coca tea (''[[Mate de coca]]'') is common among all sectors of society in the Andean countries, especially due to their high elevations from sea level,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> and is widely held to be beneficial to health, mood, and energy.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Coca leaf is sold packaged into teabags in most grocery stores in the region, and establishments that cater to tourists generally feature coca tea.\n\n==== Controversy ====\nCoca users ingest between 60 and 80 milligrams of cocaine each time they chew the leaves according to [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC).<ref>{{cite web |title=UNODC - Bulletin on Narcotics - 1952 Issue 2 - 008 |url=https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1952-01-01_2_page009.html |website=www.unodc.org}}</ref> However, other sources claims that the [[coca]] leaf, when consumed in its natural form or as coca tea, does not induce a physiological or psychological dependence, nor does abstinence after long-term use produce symptoms typical to substance addiction.<ref name=\"Hanna\">Hanna JM, Hornick CA., \"Use of coca leaf in southern Peru: adaptation or addiction,\" Bull Narc. 1977 Jan\u2013Mar;29(1):63\u201374.</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Report of the Commission of Enquiry on the Coca Leaf|journal=United Nations Economic and Social Council|date=May 1950|page=31|url=http://www.ungassondrugs.org/images/stories/cocainquiry-e.pdf|accessdate=August 4, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jenkins|first1=Amanda J.|last2=Llosa|first2=Teobaldo|last3=Montoya|first3=Ivan|last4=Cone|first4=Edward J.|title=Identification and quantitation of alkaloids in coca tea|journal=Forensic Science International|date=9 February 1996|volume=77|issue=3|pages=179\u2013189|issn=0379-0738|pmc=2705900|pmid=8819993|doi=10.1016/0379-0738(95)01860-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Biondich|first1=Amy Sue|last2=Joslin|first2=Jeremy David|title=Coca: The History and Medical Significance of an Ancient Andean Tradition|journal=Emergency Medicine International|date=2016|volume=2016|pages=4048764|doi=10.1155/2016/4048764|pmid=27144028|issn=2090-2840|pmc=4838786}}</ref> See also ''[[Erythroxylum coca]], and [[Erythroxylum novogranatense]]'' spp.\n\n== Commercial and industrial uses ==\nIn the Andes commercially manufactured coca teas, granola bars, cookies, hard candies, etc. are available in most stores and supermarkets, including upscale suburban supermarkets.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nCoca is used industrially in the cosmetics and food industries.

In the series of Aubrey-Maturin novels by Patrick O'Brien, set during the Napoleonic wars, Dr. Stephen Maturin, a naval physician, naturalist, and British intelligence agent discovers the use of coca leaves on a mission to Peru, and makes regular use of them in several of the later novels in the series.\n\n== International prohibition of coca leaf ==\nCoca leaf is the raw material for the manufacture of the [[psychoactive drug|drug]] cocaine, a powerful stimulant and [[anaesthetic]] extracted chemically from large quantities of coca leaves. Today, since it has mostly been replaced as a medical anaesthetic by synthetic analogues such as [[procaine]], cocaine is best known as an illegal [[recreational drug]]. The cultivation, sale, and possession of unprocessed coca leaf (but not of any processed form of cocaine) is generally legal in the countries \u2013 such as Bolivia, Peru, Chile, and [[Argentine Northwest]] \u2013 where traditional use is established, although cultivation is often restricted in an attempt to control the production of cocaine. \nIn the case of Argentina, it is legal only in some northwest provinces where the practice is so common that the state has accepted it.\n\nThe prohibition of the use of the coca leaf except for medical or scientific purposes was established by the United Nations in the 1961 [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]]. The coca leaf is listed on [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Schedules of drugs|Schedule I]] of the 1961 Single Convention together with cocaine and heroin. The Convention determined that \"The Parties shall so far as possible enforce the uprooting of all coca bushes which grow wild. They shall destroy the coca bushes if illegally cultivated\" (Article 26), and that, \"Coca leaf chewing must be abolished within twenty-five years from the coming into force of this Convention\" (Article 49, 2.e).<ref name=single>[http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/conv/convention_1961_en.pdf Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509063404/http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/conv/convention_1961_en.pdf |date=2008-05-09 }}</ref>\n\nThe historic rationale for international prohibition of coca leaf in the 1961 Single Convention comes from \"The Commission of Enquiry on the Coca Leaf study\" published in 1950.

The flowers mature into red [[berry (botany)|berries]].\n\nThe leaves are sometimes eaten by the [[larva]]e of the [[moth]] ''[[Eloria noyesi]]''.\n\n== Species and evolution ==\nThere are two species of cultivated coca, each with two varieties:\n*''[[Erythroxylum coca]]''\n**''Erythroxylum coca'' var.

''novogranatense'' (Colombian Coca) \u2013 a highland variety that is utilized in lowland areas. It is cultivated in drier regions found in Colombia. However, ''E. novogranatense'' is very adaptable to varying ecological conditions. The leaves have parallel lines on either side of the central vein.\n**''Erythroxylum novogranatense'' var. ''truxillense'' ([[Trujillo Province, Peru|Trujillo]] Coca) \u2013 grown primarily in Peru and Colombia. the leaves of ''E. novogranatense'' var. ''truxillense'' do not have parallel lines on either side of the central vein like all other varieties.\n\nAll four of the cultivated cocas were domesticated in pre-Columbian times and are more closely related to each other than to any other species.<ref name=\"Plowman1979\"/>\n\nThere are two main theories relating to the evolution of the cultivated cocas. The first (put forth by [[Timothy Plowman|Plowman]]<ref name=\"Plowman1984\">Plowman T.  \"The Origin, Evolution, and Diffusion of Coca, Erythroxylum spp., in South and Central America.\"  In: Stone D, ed.

There may be a common, but undiscovered ancestor.<ref name=\"Emche2011\"/>\n\nWild populations of ''[[Erythroxylum coca]]'' var. ''coca'' are found in the eastern [[Andes]]; the other 3 [[taxon|taxa]] are only known as cultivated plants.\n\nThe two subspecies of ''[[Erythroxylum coca]]'' are almost indistinguishable phenotypically. ''[[Erythroxylum novogranatense]]'' var. ''novogranatense'' and ''[[Erythroxylum novogranatense]]'' var. ''truxillense'' are phenotypically similar, but morphologically distinguishable. Under the older [[Cronquist system]] of classifying [[flowering plant]]s, this was placed in an [[order (biology)|order]] [[Linales]]; more modern systems place it in the order [[Malpighiales]].\n\n=== Herbicide resistant varieties ===\nAlso known as ''supercoca'' or ''la millionaria'', [[Boliviana negra]] is a relatively new form of coca that is resistant to a [[herbicide]] called [[glyphosate]]. Glyphosate is a key ingredient in the multibillion-dollar aerial [[coca eradication]] campaign undertaken by the government of Colombia with U.S. financial and military backing known as [[Plan Colombia]].\n\nThe herbicide resistance of this strain has at least two possible explanations: that a \"[[peer-to-peer]]\" network of coca farmers used [[plant breeding|selective breeding]] to enhance this trait through tireless effort, or the plant was [[genetic engineering|genetically modified]] in a laboratory. In 1996, a [[biological patent|patented]] glyphosate-resistant [[soybean]] was marketed by [[Monsanto Company]], suggesting that it would be possible to genetically modify coca in an analogous manner.

As the plant was viewed as having a divine origin, its cultivation became subject to a [[state monopoly]] and its use restricted to nobles and a few favored classes (court orators, couriers, favored public workers, and the army) by the rule of the [[Topa Inca]] (1471\u20131493). As the Incan empire declined, the leaf became more widely available. After some deliberation, [[Philip II of Spain]] issued a decree recognizing the drug as essential to the well-being of the Andean Indians but urging missionaries to end its religious use. The Spanish are believed to have effectively encouraged use of coca by an increasing majority of the population to increase their labor output and tolerance for starvation, but it is not clear that this was planned deliberately.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.taironatrust.org/about-the-kogi/the-culture/logi-culture-and-cultivating-harmony|title=Tairona Heritage Trust|last=http://feastcreative.com|first=Feast Creative |website=www.taironatrust.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref>\n\nCoca was first introduced to Europe in the 16th century, but did not become popular until the mid-19th century, with the publication of an influential paper by Dr. [[Paolo Mantegazza]] praising its stimulating effects on cognition. This led to invention of [[coca wine]] and the first production of pure cocaine. Coca wine (of which [[Vin Mariani]] was the best-known brand) and other coca-containing preparations were widely sold as patent medicines and tonics, with claims of a wide variety of health benefits. The original version of [[Coca-Cola]] was among these. These products became illegal in most countries outside of South America in the early 20th century, after the addictive nature of cocaine was widely recognized. In 1859, [[Albert Niemann (chemist)|Albert Niemann]] of the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] became the first person to isolate the chief alkaloid of coca, which he named \"cocaine\".<ref>{{cite book\n  |last = Inciardi\n  |first = James A.\n  |title = The War on Drugs II\n  |publisher = Mayfield Publishing Company\n  |year = 1992\n  |page = 6\n  |isbn = 1-55934-016-9}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, the Dutch colony of [[Java]] became a leading exporter of [[coca leaf]].

The coca plant was also the inspiration for Bolivia's [[Coca Museum]].\n\n==Coca Use by the Incas==\n\n===Ethnohistorical Sources===\nWhile many historians are in agreement that coca was a contributing factor to the daily life of the [[Inca]], there are many different theories as to how this civilization came to adopt it as one of its staple crops and as a valued commodity. The Incas were able to accomplish significant things while stimulated by the effects of coca. The Incas did not have a graphical written language, but used the ''[[quipu]]'', a fiber recording device. [[Ethnohistory|Ethnohistoric]] Spanish documents make it clear that coca was one of the most important elements of Inca culture. Coca was used in Inca feasts and religious rituals, among many other things.<ref>Mortimer, W. Golden. Peru History of Coca: \"The Divine Plant\" of the Incas. New York: J. H. Vail & Company, 1901.</ref> It was a driving factor in the labor efforts that Inca kings asked of their citizens, and also used to barter for other goods. Coca was vital to the Inca civilization and its culture. The Incas valued coca so much that they colonized tropical rain forests to the north and east of their capital in [[Cuzco]] so that they could increase and control their supply. The Incas colonized more human regions because coca cannot grow above 2600 meters in elevation (coca is not frost-resistant).<ref>Valdez, Lidio M., Juan Taboada, and J. Ernesto Valdez. 2015. \u201cAncient Use of Coca Leaves in the Peruvian Central Highlands.\u201d Journal of Anthropological Research 71 (2): 231\u201358. doi:10.3998/jar.0521004.0071.204.</ref>\n\n===Coca Use in Labor and Military Service===\nOne of the most common uses of coca during the reign of the Inca was in the context of ''[[mit'a]]'' labor, a labor tax required of all able-bodied men in the Inca empire, and also in military service. [[Pedro Cieza de Le\u00f3n]] wrote that the indigenous people of the Andes always seemed to have coca in their mouths. ''Mit'a'' laborers, soldiers, and others chewed coca to alleviate hunger and thirst while they were working and fighting. The results of this are evident in monumental construction and the successful expansion of the Inca empire through conquest. By chewing coca, laborers and soldiers were able to work harder and for longer periods. Some historians believe that coca and ''chicha'' (fermented corn beer) made it possible for the Incas to move large stones in order to create architectural masterpieces, especially ones of [[monolith|monolithic]] construction such as [[Sacsayhuaman]].<ref>Valdez, Lidio M., Juan Taboada, and J. Ernesto Valdez. 2015. \u201cAncient Use of Coca Leaves in the Peruvian Central Highlands.\u201d Journal of Anthropological Research 71 (2): 231\u201358. doi:10.3998/jar.0521004.0071.204</ref> . Many of the artifacts and statues that are found may have been the product of laborers under the effects of coca .\n\n===Coca Use in Religious Rituals===\nDue to the [[Spanish conquest]] of the Inca Empire, the Spaniards had direct access to the Inca. They had insight to their everyday lives, and it is through their lens that we learn about [[religion in the Inca empire]]. While the indigenous author [[Pedro Cieza de Le\u00f3n]] wrote about the effects coca had on the Inca, multiple Spanish men wrote about the importance of coca in their spirituality. For example [[Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa]], Father [[Bernab\u00e9 Cobo]], and Juan de Ulloa Mogoll\u00f3n noted how the Incas would leave coca leaves at important locations throughout the empire. They considered coca to be the highest form of plant offering that the Incas made.<ref>Valdez, Lidio M., Juan Taboada, and J. Ernesto Valdez. 2015. \u201cAncient Use of Coca Leaves in the Peruvian Central Highlands.\u201d Journal of Anthropological Research 71 (2): 231\u201358. doi:10.3998/jar.0521004.0071.204.</ref>\n\nThe Incas would put coca leaves in the mouths of mummies, which were a sacred part of Inca culture. Mummies of Inca emperors were regarded for their wisdom and often consulted for important matters long after the body had deteriorated. Not only did many Inca mummies have coca leaves in their mouths, but they also carried coca leaves in bags.<ref>Valdez, Lidio M., Juan Taboada, and J. Ernesto Valdez. 2015. \u201cAncient Use of Coca Leaves in the Peruvian Central Highlands.\u201d Journal of Anthropological Research 71 (2): 231\u201358. doi:10.3998/jar.0521004.0071.204.</ref> These are believed to be Inca sacrifices, and like the Aztecs, the Inca participated in sacrifices as well. It is clear that the Incas had a strong belief in the divinity of the coca leaf as there is now evidence that both the living and the dead were subjected to coca use. They even sent their sacrifices off to their death with a sacrificial bag of coca leaves. The coca leaf affected all stages of life for the Inca.\n\n===Coca Use After the Spanish Conquest===\nAfter the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire, it was time for the rest of the world to be introduced to the wonders of the coca leaf. But it was not like this at first. By many historical accounts, the Spaniards actually tried to eradicate the coca leaf from Inca life. The Spaniards saw the Incas as nothing more than slaves and laborers and did not want them to have the luxury of the coca leaf. Although the Spaniards noticed the state-controlled storage facilities that the Inca had built to distribute to its workers<ref>Valdez, Lidio M., Juan Taboada, and J. Ernesto Valdez. 2015. \u201cAncient Use of Coca Leaves in the Peruvian Central Highlands.\u201d Journal of Anthropological Research 71 (2): 231\u201358. doi:10.3998/jar.0521004.0071.204.</ref>, they were still oblivious to the affinity that the Inca had with this divine plant. Not only that, the Inca were being treated as slaves and had to do arduous work for the Spaniards. Finally, the Spaniards noticed that the Inca could not do the work without coca. Even though they were trying to push their religion onto the Inca, which did not allow them to eat before the [[Eucharist]] (the Spaniards thought coca to be food) they allowed them to continue to use coca to achieve their work.<ref>Mortimer, W. Golden. Peru History of Coca: \"The Divine Plant\" of the Incas. New York: J. H. Vail & Company, 1901.</ref> The Spanish conquest drastically altered the lives of the Inca civilization, but the Inca also altered the life of Spaniards, and quite frankly, the rest of the world. After seeing the effects and powers of coca, many Spaniards themselves starting growing and selling coca.\n\n== Traditional uses ==\n[[File:Folha de coca.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Man holding coca leaf in Bolivia]]\n\n=== Medicine ===\nTraditional medical uses of coca are foremost as a stimulant to overcome fatigue, hunger, and thirst. It is considered particularly effective against [[altitude sickness]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tni.org/en/primer/coca-leaf-myths-and-reality|title=Coca leaf: Myths and Reality|author=|date=5 August 2014|website=tni.org}}</ref> It also is used as an [[anesthetic]] and analgesic to alleviate the pain of headache, [[rheumatism]], wounds and sores, etc. Before stronger anaesthetics were available, it also was used for broken bones, childbirth, and during [[trepanning]] operations on the skull.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The high calcium content in coca explains why people used it for bone fractures.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Because coca constricts blood vessels, it also serves to oppose bleeding, and coca seeds were used for [[nosebleed]]s. Indigenous use of coca has also been reported as a treatment for [[malaria]], [[peptic ulcer|ulcers]], [[asthma]], to improve [[digestion]], to guard against bowel laxity, as an [[aphrodisiac]], and credited with improving [[longevity]]. Modern studies have supported a number of these medical applications.<ref name=\"Weil\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n=== Nutrition ===\nRaw coca leaves, chewed or consumed as tea or mate de coca, are rich in nutritional properties. Specifically, the coca plant contains essential minerals (calcium, potassium, phosphorus), vitamins ([[vitamin B1|B1]], [[vitamin B2|B2]], [[vitamin C|C]], and [[vitamin E|E]]) and nutrients such as protein and fiber.<ref>James, A., Aulick, D., Plowman, T., 1975 \"Nutritional Value of Coca\", Botanical Museum Leaflets, Harvard University 24 (6): 113\u2013119.</ref><ref>Harvard Study \u2013 Nutritional Value of Coca Leaf (Duke, Aulick, Plowman 1975)</ref>\n\n=== Religion ===\nCoca has also been a vital part of the religious cosmology of the Andean peoples of Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, northern Argentina, and Chile from the [[Pre-Inca cultures|pre-Inca period]] through to the present. Coca leaves play a crucial part in offerings to the [[apus]] (mountains), [[Inti]] (the sun), or [[Pachamama]] (the earth). Coca leaves are also often read in a form of [[divination]] analogous to [[reading tea leaves]] in other cultures. As one example of the many traditional beliefs about coca, it is believed by the miners of [[Cerro de Pasco]] to soften the veins of [[ore]], if masticated (chewed) and thrown upon them (see '''Cocomama''' in [[Inca mythology]]).{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} In addition, coca use in shamanic rituals is well documented wherever local native populations have cultivated the plant. For example, the Tayronas of Colombia's Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta would chew the plant before engaging in extended meditation and prayer.<ref name=\"banrep.gov.co\">{{cite web |author=Museo del Oro, Banco de la Republica |url=http://www.banrep.gov.co/museo/eng/expo_bogota3c.htm |title=Museo del Oro, Colombia |language=es |publisher=Banrep.gov.co |accessdate=2012-11-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511180916/http://www.banrep.gov.co/museo/eng/expo_bogota3c.htm |archivedate=2013-05-11 }}</ref>\n\n=== Traditional preparation ===\nTraditionally, coca leaves are prepared either to chew or as a tea ([[coca tea|mate de coca]]).<ref name=\"Coca Myths 2009\"/><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.tni.org/primer/coca-leaf-myths-and-reality |title=Drugs and Democracy &#124; Coca leaf: Myths and Reality\n|publisher=Tni.org |date=2011-02-18 |accessdate=2012-11-09}}</ref> \n\n==== Chew ====\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2011}}\nIn Bolivia bags of coca leaves are sold in local markets and by street vendors. The activity of chewing coca is called ''mambear'', ''chacchar'' or ''acullicar'', borrowed from [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], ''coquear'' (northern Argentina), or in Bolivia, ''picchar'', derived from the [[Aymara language]]. The Spanish ''masticar'' is also frequently used, along with the slang term \"bolear,\" derived from the word \"bola\" or ball of coca pouched in the cheek while chewing. Typical coca consumption varies between 20 and 60 grams per day,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1952-01-01_2_page009.html|title=UNODC - Bulletin on Narcotics - 1952 Issue 2 - 008|last=ZAPATA-ORTIZ|first=Vicente|website=www.unodc.org|access-date=2018-06-20}}</ref> and contemporary methods are believed to be unchanged from ancient times.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Coca is kept in a woven pouch (''[[Chuspas|chuspa]]'' or ''huallqui''). A few leaves are chosen to form a quid ''(acullico)'' held between the mouth and gums. Doing so may cause a tingling and numbing sensation in their mouths. (The formerly ubiquitous dental anaesthetic [[procaine|novocaine / procaine]] has a similar effect.)\n\nChewing coca leaves is most common in indigenous communities across the central Andean region,<ref name=\"banrep.gov.co\"/> particularly in places like the highlands of Argentina, Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru, where the cultivation and consumption of coca is a part of the national culture, similar to [[chicha]]. It also serves as a powerful symbol of indigenous cultural and religious identity, amongst a diversity of indigenous nations throughout South America.<ref name=\"banrep.gov.co\"/> [[Tobacco]] leaves were also traditionally chewed in the same way in North America, though modern [[chewing tobacco]] is typically heavily processed.\n\n[[File:Llipta on coca leaf.jpeg|thumb|''Llipta'' is used to improve extraction when chewing coca (Museo de la Coca, [[Cusco]], Peru)]]\nOne option for chewing coca is with a tiny quantity of ''ilucta'' (a preparation of the ashes of the [[quinoa]] plant) added to the coca leaves; it softens their [[astringent]] flavor and activates the [[alkaloids]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Other names for this basifying substance are ''llipta'' in Peru and the Spanish word ''lej\u00eda'', ''[[bleach]]'' in English. The consumer carefully uses a wooden stick (formerly often a spatula of precious metal) to transfer an alkaline component into the quid without touching his flesh with the corrosive substance.

In the series of Aubrey-Maturin novels by Patrick O'Brien, set during the Napoleonic wars, Dr. Stephen Maturin, a naval physician, naturalist, and British intelligence agent discovers the use of coca leaves on a mission to Peru, and makes regular use of them in several of the later novels in the series.\n\n== International prohibition of coca leaf ==\nCoca leaf is the raw material for the manufacture of the [[psychoactive drug|drug]] cocaine, a powerful stimulant and [[anaesthetic]] extracted chemically from large quantities of coca leaves. Today, since it has mostly been replaced as a medical anaesthetic by synthetic analogues such as [[procaine]], cocaine is best known as an illegal [[recreational drug]]. The cultivation, sale, and possession of unprocessed coca leaf (but not of any processed form of cocaine) is generally legal in the countries \u2013 such as Bolivia, Peru, Chile, and [[Argentine Northwest]] \u2013 where traditional use is established, although cultivation is often restricted in an attempt to control the production of cocaine. \nIn the case of Argentina, it is legal only in some northwest provinces where the practice is so common that the state has accepted it.\n\nThe prohibition of the use of the coca leaf except for medical or scientific purposes was established by the United Nations in the 1961 [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]]. The coca leaf is listed on [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Schedules of drugs|Schedule I]] of the 1961 Single Convention together with cocaine and heroin. The Convention determined that \"The Parties shall so far as possible enforce the uprooting of all coca bushes which grow wild. They shall destroy the coca bushes if illegally cultivated\" (Article 26), and that, \"Coca leaf chewing must be abolished within twenty-five years from the coming into force of this Convention\" (Article 49, 2.e).<ref name=single>[http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/conv/convention_1961_en.pdf Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509063404/http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/conv/convention_1961_en.pdf |date=2008-05-09 }}</ref>\n\nThe historic rationale for international prohibition of coca leaf in the 1961 Single Convention comes from \"The Commission of Enquiry on the Coca Leaf study\" published in 1950. It was requested of the United Nations by the permanent representative of Peru, and was prepared by a commission that visited Bolivia and Peru briefly in 1949 to \"investigate the effects of chewing the coca leaf and the possibilities of limiting its production and controlling its distribution.\" It concluded that the effects of chewing coca leaves were negative, even though chewing coca was defined as a habit, not an addiction.<ref name=com>[https://www.tni.org/en/issues/unscheduling-the-coca-leaf/item/995-report-of-the-commission-of-enquiry-on-the-coca-leaf Commission of Enquiry on the Coca Leaf], UNGASS 10-year review website, Transnational Institute</ref><ref name=bul>[http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1949-01-01_1_page006.html The Commission of Enquiry on the Coca Leaf], Bulletin on Narcotics{{snd}}1949 Issue 1</ref>\n\nThe report was sharply criticised for its arbitrariness, lack of precision, and racist connotations.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The team members' professional qualifications and parallel interests were also criticised, as were the methodology used and the incomplete selection and use of existing scientific literature on the coca leaf.

The colony of New South Wales was initially a penal settlement, with the military garrison being armed. Firearms were also used for hunting, protection of persons and crops, in crime and fighting crime, and in many military engagements. From the landing of the [[First Fleet]] there was conflict with Aborigines over game, access to fenced land, and spearing of livestock. Firearms were used to protect explorers and settlers from Aboriginal attack. A number of punitive raids and [[List of massacres of Indigenous Australians|massacres of Aboriginals]] were carried out in a series of local conflicts.\n\nThe firearms issued to convicts (for meat hunting) and settlers (for hunting and protection) were stolen and misused, resulting in more controls.  In January 1796, Colonel [[David Collins (lieutenant governor)|David Collins]] wrote that \"several attempts had been made to ascertain the number of arms in the possession of individuals, as many were feared to be in the hands of those who committed depredations; the crown recalled but of between two and three hundred arms which belonged to the crown, not more than 50 were accounted for\".<ref>Christopher Halls 1974, Guns in Australia, Paul Hamlyn Pty Ltd Dee Why NSW</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ol5dAAAAcAAJ&dq=david+collins+number+of+arms+in+the+possession+of+individuals|title=On Account of the English Colony in New South Wales, from Its First Settlement in January 1788, to August 1801 ...

In 1987, the [[Hoddle Street massacre]] and the [[Queen Street massacre]] took place in [[Melbourne]].  In response, several states required the registration of all guns, and restricted the availability of [[Semi-automatic rifle|self-loading rifle]]s and shotguns.  In the [[Strathfield massacre]] in New South Wales, 1991, two were killed with a knife, and five more with a firearm.  Tasmania passed a law in 1991 for firearm purchasers to obtain a licence, though enforcement was light.  Firearm laws in [[Tasmania]] and [[Queensland]] remained relatively relaxed for longarms.\n\n====Port Arthur massacre====\n{{Main|Port Arthur massacre (Australia)}}\nThe Port Arthur massacre took place in 1996 when the gunman opened fire on shop owners and tourists with two semi-automatic rifles that left 35 people dead and 23 wounded.

In two federally funded [[Gun buyback program|gun buybacks]] and voluntary surrenders and State Governments' gun amnesties before and after the [[Port Arthur massacre (Australia)|Port Arthur Massacre]] were collected and destroyed, more than a million firearms, possibly 1/3 of the national stock.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Alpers |first1=Philip |title=Gun control: Change is possible -- and fast |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/16/opinion/australia-gun-laws/index.html |accessdate=6 May 2019 |work=In two nationwide, federally funded gun buybacks, plus large-scale voluntary surrenders and state gun amnesties both before and after Port Arthur, Australia collected and destroyed more than a million firearms, perhaps one-third of the national stock. |agency=CNN |date=11 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nA person must have a [[firearms license|firearm licence]] to possess or use a firearm.

The colony of New South Wales was initially a penal settlement, with the military garrison being armed. Firearms were also used for hunting, protection of persons and crops, in crime and fighting crime, and in many military engagements. From the landing of the [[First Fleet]] there was conflict with Aborigines over game, access to fenced land, and spearing of livestock. Firearms were used to protect explorers and settlers from Aboriginal attack. A number of punitive raids and [[List of massacres of Indigenous Australians|massacres of Aboriginals]] were carried out in a series of local conflicts.\n\nThe firearms issued to convicts (for meat hunting) and settlers (for hunting and protection) were stolen and misused, resulting in more controls.  In January 1796, Colonel [[David Collins (lieutenant governor)|David Collins]] wrote that \"several attempts had been made to ascertain the number of arms in the possession of individuals, as many were feared to be in the hands of those who committed depredations; the crown recalled but of between two and three hundred arms which belonged to the crown, not more than 50 were accounted for\".<ref>Christopher Halls 1974, Guns in Australia, Paul Hamlyn Pty Ltd Dee Why NSW</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ol5dAAAAcAAJ&dq=david+collins+number+of+arms+in+the+possession+of+individuals|title=On Account of the English Colony in New South Wales, from Its First Settlement in January 1788, to August 1801 ...

In 1987, the [[Hoddle Street massacre]] and the [[Queen Street massacre]] took place in [[Melbourne]].  In response, several states required the registration of all guns, and restricted the availability of [[Semi-automatic rifle|self-loading rifle]]s and shotguns.  In the [[Strathfield massacre]] in New South Wales, 1991, two were killed with a knife, and five more with a firearm.  Tasmania passed a law in 1991 for firearm purchasers to obtain a licence, though enforcement was light.  Firearm laws in [[Tasmania]] and [[Queensland]] remained relatively relaxed for longarms.\n\n====Port Arthur massacre====\n{{Main|Port Arthur massacre (Australia)}}\nThe Port Arthur massacre took place in 1996 when the gunman opened fire on shop owners and tourists with two semi-automatic rifles that left 35 people dead and 23 wounded.

Nemo appears in two of Verne's science-fiction classics, ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1870) and ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' (1875). He also makes a cameo appearance in a play on which Verne may have collaborated, ''[[Journey Through the Impossible]]'' (1882).\n\nNemo is a mysterious figure. Though originally of unknown nationality, he's later described as the son of an East Indian [[Maharaja|raja]]. A scientific visionary, he roams the depths of the seas in his [[submarine]], the ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'', which was assembled from parts manufactured in several different countries, then shipped to Nemo's cover address. The captain is consumed by a hunger for vengeance and hatred of [[imperialism]]; the [[British Empire]] is ultimately revealed as his main antagonist. \n\nNemo has appeared in various film adaptations of Verne's novels, where he has been portrayed by such celebrated actors as [[James Mason]], [[Herbert Lom]], and [[Michael Caine]]. He has also been appropriated by other authors for their own novels, including [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', [[Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer]]'s ''[[The Other Log of Phileas Fogg]]'',  [[Kevin J. Anderson]]'s ''[[Captain Nemo: The Fantastic History of a Dark Genius]]'', and [[Thomas F. Monteleone]]'s ''The Secret Sea''.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\n''Nemo'' is [[Latin language|Latin]] for \"no one\" or \"nobody\".\n\nMoreover ''Nemo'' is itself the Latin translation of [[Ancient Greek]] ''[[Outis]]'' (\"Nobody\"), the pseudonym adopted by [[Odysseus]], in [[Greek mythology]]\u2014a ruse employed to outwit the [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]]. This appears to be the intended meaning, since in ''The Mysterious Island'', when Cyrus Smith addresses him as Captain Nemo, the latter replies, \"I have no name!\"\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\n[[File:OrchhaPalace.jpg|thumb|[[Jahangir Mahal, Orchha|Jahangir Mahal]], home to the real-life rajas of [[Orchha State|Orchha]], Bundelkhand]]\n[[File:Nemo s death.jpg|upright|thumb|Captain Nemo's death in ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'']]\nChief among the few details of Nemo's history given in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' are his hatred of imperialism and his grief over the loss of his loved ones in years past.\n\nIn ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'', Captain Nemo identifies himself as Prince Dakkar, son of the Hindu [[Maharaja|raja]] of [[Bundelkhand]], and a descendant of the Muslim [[Sultan]] [[Tipu Sultan|Fateh Ali Khan Tipu]] of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], famous for the [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]] (1767\u20131799) and [[Mysorean rockets|Mysorean rocket]] technology. After the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], in which Dakkar lost both his family and his kingdom, the prince devoted himself to scientific research, ultimately building the [[Nautilus (Verne)|''Nautilus'']] and crusing the seven seas with a crew of devoted followers. They gather [[bullion]] from various shipwrecks in the ocean, most notably from the hulks of the Spanish treasure fleet sunk during the [[Battle of Vigo Bay]]. Nemo claims to have no interest in terrestrial affairs but occasionally intervenes to aid people in distress, e.g.,  by giving salvaged treasure to participants in the [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)]] against the island's [[Ottoman Turks|Turkish]] rulers ... by saving (both physically and financially) a [[Sinhalese people|Ceylonese]] or [[Tamil people|Tamil]] pearl hunter from a shark attack ... by rescuing the castaways in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' ... and by covertly protecting another set of castaways in ''[[The Mysterious Island]]''.\n\nLike many actual [[Princely state|Indian princes]] of the era, Nemo had a Western education, during which, as he states, he spent his youth touring and studying throughout Europe. In his first meeting with Professor Aronnax and his companions, the three castaways speak to him in French, English, [[Latin]], and German; Nemo later reveals that he is fluent in all of these tongues. Aronnax praises the captain's French, noting that he \"expressed himself with perfect ease and without any accent.\" Relying on his intuition and knowledge of [[ethnology]], the professor concludes that \"there's southern blood\" in him but can't determine the captain's exact origin. The ''Nautilus''{{'s}} library, lounge, and art collections reveal that Nemo is intimately acquainted with European culture, also that he's an accomplished performer on the [[pipe organ|organ]].\n\nNemo dies of unspecified natural causes on board the ''Nautilus'', docked permanently inside Dakkar Grotto on [[The Mysterious Island|Lincoln Island]] in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]. Cyrus Smith, leader of the castaways whom Nemo protected, administered the last rites, then submerged the ''Nautilus'' in the grotto's waters.\n\n== Character ==\n[[File:20000 Nemo organ.jpg|upright|thumb|Captain Nemo playing the [[organ (music)|organ]], at which he was a master.]]\n\nNemo's characteristics are largely presented through the observations of Professor Pierre Aronnax, narrator of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas''. At their first meeting, the professor remarks: \"Whether this individual was thirty-five or fifty years of age, I couldn't tell.\" He goes on to describe Nemo as a tall, self-contained man with a straight nose, broad brow, and wide-set eyes\u2014\"certainly the most wonderful physical specimen I'd ever met up with.\" In ''The Mysterious Island'', the captain is in his late sixties and sports a long white beard.\n\nHe avoids dry land, except when it's uninhabited, as with [[Antarctica]] and [[desert islands]]. In keeping with his contempt for the nations of the surface, he uses no products that are not marine in nature, be it food, clothing, furnishing, or even [[tobacco]]. Little is revealed about his political opinions except an almost maniacal hatred of oppression, with which he identifies all the [[imperialistic]] nations of the world. He therefore identifies himself with those oppressed, be they [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)|Cretans]] rising against the [[Ottoman Turks|Turks]], [[Ceylonese]] [[pearl hunting|pearl divers]], or even [[Right whale|black whales]] attacked by [[sperm whales|cachalots (sperm whales)]]. When Professor Aronnax alleges that Nemo violates maritime and international law by sinking warships, Nemo responds that he is merely defending himself from his attackers, and that the laws of the world on the surface no longer apply to him. In one scene, Nemo exclaims:\n\n{{quotation|On its surface they can still exercise their iniquitous claims, battle each other, devour each other, haul every earthly horror. But thirty feet below sea level, their dominion ceases, their influence fades, their power vanishes! Ah, sir, live! Live in the heart of the seas! Here alone lies independence!

He shows the same compassion in his treatment of the castaways in ''The Mysterious Island'', and retains a strong attachment to his deceased wife and children. Though short-tempered, he rarely expresses his anger. He is also a man of immense courage, in the forefront of every activity, from releasing the ''Nautilus'' from the Antarctic ice to fighting squid in the Caribbean; and notable for having worked consecutive eight-hour shifts without a break, with little oxygen, to free the ''Nautilus'' from the ice. He was also identified as having discovered [[Atlantis]].\n\nAn extraordinary engineer, Nemo has designed and built the ''Nautilus'', besides inventing her electric propulsion and navigation systems. He has an exceptional mastery of underwater navigation, taking upon himself the most difficult submarine passages, such as those under the [[Suez|Isthmus of Suez]] and the Antarctic ice sheet.\n\n[[File:20000 Nautilus Salon.jpg|upright|thumb|The Grand Salon of the ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'']]\n\nHe has a comprehensive knowledge of [[marine biology]], and it is his respect for Professor Aronnax's expertise in the field which led to his befriending the professor when the latter was cast upon the ''Nautilus''. Further, he is said to have read and annotated all the books he possessed in the ''Nautilus''{{'s}} vast library.\n\nHe has very fine taste in art, possessing several masterpieces of both painting and sculpture, from ancient and modern European masters, all of which are housed in the Grand Salon of the ''Nautilus'', along with his collection of [[pearl]]s, [[coral]]s and other such marine products, which he had gathered himself. In the opinion of Professor Aronnax, the collection of the Grand Salon far outstrips that of the [[Louvre]]. Despite the opulence visible all through the ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'', Nemo's cabin was furnished with little beside a bed and the navigational instruments integral to the ''Nautilus''. Captain Nemo is believed to be extremely affluent, in that while he never states exactly how much he is worth, he claims that 'without missing it, he could pay the national debt of France'.  At the time of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea''{{'s}} publication, this was worth 4.6 billion francs, or $18.4 billion U.S. dollars in 2018.\n\nNemo tells Professor Aronnax that his intention was to have his autobiography sealed in an unsinkable casket and thrown overboard by the last survivor of the ''Nautilus''{{'s}} crew, in the hope that it would be washed up somewhere. Accordingly an unsinkable casket does wash up in ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' (wherein is revealed Nemo's background story), containing tools, guns, navigation instruments, an atlas, books, blank paper, and even clothing. The crate is lashed to empty barrels, and the contents sealed in a waterproof zinc envelope, showing careful preparation and packing. Throughout the same book, Nemo acts as an agent of [[Divine Providence]], as when the sailor Pencroff laments the absence of [[tobacco]], and a hunting party discover a plant that the young naturalist Harbert identifies as such. The other castaways keep the discovery secret until they can dry and cure the leaves. One evening, Pencroff is offered some coffee by his friends.

Nemo appears in two of Verne's science-fiction classics, ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1870) and ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' (1875). He also makes a cameo appearance in a play on which Verne may have collaborated, ''[[Journey Through the Impossible]]'' (1882).\n\nNemo is a mysterious figure. Though originally of unknown nationality, he's later described as the son of an East Indian [[Maharaja|raja]]. A scientific visionary, he roams the depths of the seas in his [[submarine]], the ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'', which was assembled from parts manufactured in several different countries, then shipped to Nemo's cover address. The captain is consumed by a hunger for vengeance and hatred of [[imperialism]]; the [[British Empire]] is ultimately revealed as his main antagonist. \n\nNemo has appeared in various film adaptations of Verne's novels, where he has been portrayed by such celebrated actors as [[James Mason]], [[Herbert Lom]], and [[Michael Caine]]. He has also been appropriated by other authors for their own novels, including [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', [[Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer]]'s ''[[The Other Log of Phileas Fogg]]'',  [[Kevin J. Anderson]]'s ''[[Captain Nemo: The Fantastic History of a Dark Genius]]'', and [[Thomas F. Monteleone]]'s ''The Secret Sea''.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\n''Nemo'' is [[Latin language|Latin]] for \"no one\" or \"nobody\".\n\nMoreover ''Nemo'' is itself the Latin translation of [[Ancient Greek]] ''[[Outis]]'' (\"Nobody\"), the pseudonym adopted by [[Odysseus]], in [[Greek mythology]]\u2014a ruse employed to outwit the [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]]. This appears to be the intended meaning, since in ''The Mysterious Island'', when Cyrus Smith addresses him as Captain Nemo, the latter replies, \"I have no name!\"\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\n[[File:OrchhaPalace.jpg|thumb|[[Jahangir Mahal, Orchha|Jahangir Mahal]], home to the real-life rajas of [[Orchha State|Orchha]], Bundelkhand]]\n[[File:Nemo s death.jpg|upright|thumb|Captain Nemo's death in ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'']]\nChief among the few details of Nemo's history given in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' are his hatred of imperialism and his grief over the loss of his loved ones in years past.\n\nIn ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'', Captain Nemo identifies himself as Prince Dakkar, son of the Hindu [[Maharaja|raja]] of [[Bundelkhand]], and a descendant of the Muslim [[Sultan]] [[Tipu Sultan|Fateh Ali Khan Tipu]] of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], famous for the [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]] (1767\u20131799) and [[Mysorean rockets|Mysorean rocket]] technology. After the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], in which Dakkar lost both his family and his kingdom, the prince devoted himself to scientific research, ultimately building the [[Nautilus (Verne)|''Nautilus'']] and crusing the seven seas with a crew of devoted followers. They gather [[bullion]] from various shipwrecks in the ocean, most notably from the hulks of the Spanish treasure fleet sunk during the [[Battle of Vigo Bay]]. Nemo claims to have no interest in terrestrial affairs but occasionally intervenes to aid people in distress, e.g.,  by giving salvaged treasure to participants in the [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)]] against the island's [[Ottoman Turks|Turkish]] rulers ... by saving (both physically and financially) a [[Sinhalese people|Ceylonese]] or [[Tamil people|Tamil]] pearl hunter from a shark attack ... by rescuing the castaways in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' ... and by covertly protecting another set of castaways in ''[[The Mysterious Island]]''.\n\nLike many actual [[Princely state|Indian princes]] of the era, Nemo had a Western education, during which, as he states, he spent his youth touring and studying throughout Europe. In his first meeting with Professor Aronnax and his companions, the three castaways speak to him in French, English, [[Latin]], and German; Nemo later reveals that he is fluent in all of these tongues. Aronnax praises the captain's French, noting that he \"expressed himself with perfect ease and without any accent.\" Relying on his intuition and knowledge of [[ethnology]], the professor concludes that \"there's southern blood\" in him but can't determine the captain's exact origin. The ''Nautilus''{{'s}} library, lounge, and art collections reveal that Nemo is intimately acquainted with European culture, also that he's an accomplished performer on the [[pipe organ|organ]].\n\nNemo dies of unspecified natural causes on board the ''Nautilus'', docked permanently inside Dakkar Grotto on [[The Mysterious Island|Lincoln Island]] in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]. Cyrus Smith, leader of the castaways whom Nemo protected, administered the last rites, then submerged the ''Nautilus'' in the grotto's waters.\n\n== Character ==\n[[File:20000 Nemo organ.jpg|upright|thumb|Captain Nemo playing the [[organ (music)|organ]], at which he was a master.]]\n\nNemo's characteristics are largely presented through the observations of Professor Pierre Aronnax, narrator of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas''. At their first meeting, the professor remarks: \"Whether this individual was thirty-five or fifty years of age, I couldn't tell.\" He goes on to describe Nemo as a tall, self-contained man with a straight nose, broad brow, and wide-set eyes\u2014\"certainly the most wonderful physical specimen I'd ever met up with.\" In ''The Mysterious Island'', the captain is in his late sixties and sports a long white beard.\n\nHe avoids dry land, except when it's uninhabited, as with [[Antarctica]] and [[desert islands]]. In keeping with his contempt for the nations of the surface, he uses no products that are not marine in nature, be it food, clothing, furnishing, or even [[tobacco]]. Little is revealed about his political opinions except an almost maniacal hatred of oppression, with which he identifies all the [[imperialistic]] nations of the world. He therefore identifies himself with those oppressed, be they [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)|Cretans]] rising against the [[Ottoman Turks|Turks]], [[Ceylonese]] [[pearl hunting|pearl divers]], or even [[Right whale|black whales]] attacked by [[sperm whales|cachalots (sperm whales)]]. When Professor Aronnax alleges that Nemo violates maritime and international law by sinking warships, Nemo responds that he is merely defending himself from his attackers, and that the laws of the world on the surface no longer apply to him. In one scene, Nemo exclaims:\n\n{{quotation|On its surface they can still exercise their iniquitous claims, battle each other, devour each other, haul every earthly horror. But thirty feet below sea level, their dominion ceases, their influence fades, their power vanishes! Ah, sir, live! Live in the heart of the seas! Here alone lies independence!

He shows the same compassion in his treatment of the castaways in ''The Mysterious Island'', and retains a strong attachment to his deceased wife and children. Though short-tempered, he rarely expresses his anger. He is also a man of immense courage, in the forefront of every activity, from releasing the ''Nautilus'' from the Antarctic ice to fighting squid in the Caribbean; and notable for having worked consecutive eight-hour shifts without a break, with little oxygen, to free the ''Nautilus'' from the ice. He was also identified as having discovered [[Atlantis]].\n\nAn extraordinary engineer, Nemo has designed and built the ''Nautilus'', besides inventing her electric propulsion and navigation systems. He has an exceptional mastery of underwater navigation, taking upon himself the most difficult submarine passages, such as those under the [[Suez|Isthmus of Suez]] and the Antarctic ice sheet.\n\n[[File:20000 Nautilus Salon.jpg|upright|thumb|The Grand Salon of the ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'']]\n\nHe has a comprehensive knowledge of [[marine biology]], and it is his respect for Professor Aronnax's expertise in the field which led to his befriending the professor when the latter was cast upon the ''Nautilus''. Further, he is said to have read and annotated all the books he possessed in the ''Nautilus''{{'s}} vast library.\n\nHe has very fine taste in art, possessing several masterpieces of both painting and sculpture, from ancient and modern European masters, all of which are housed in the Grand Salon of the ''Nautilus'', along with his collection of [[pearl]]s, [[coral]]s and other such marine products, which he had gathered himself. In the opinion of Professor Aronnax, the collection of the Grand Salon far outstrips that of the [[Louvre]]. Despite the opulence visible all through the ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'', Nemo's cabin was furnished with little beside a bed and the navigational instruments integral to the ''Nautilus''. Captain Nemo is believed to be extremely affluent, in that while he never states exactly how much he is worth, he claims that 'without missing it, he could pay the national debt of France'.  At the time of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea''{{'s}} publication, this was worth 4.6 billion francs, or $18.4 billion U.S. dollars in 2018.\n\nNemo tells Professor Aronnax that his intention was to have his autobiography sealed in an unsinkable casket and thrown overboard by the last survivor of the ''Nautilus''{{'s}} crew, in the hope that it would be washed up somewhere. Accordingly an unsinkable casket does wash up in ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' (wherein is revealed Nemo's background story), containing tools, guns, navigation instruments, an atlas, books, blank paper, and even clothing. The crate is lashed to empty barrels, and the contents sealed in a waterproof zinc envelope, showing careful preparation and packing. Throughout the same book, Nemo acts as an agent of [[Divine Providence]], as when the sailor Pencroff laments the absence of [[tobacco]], and a hunting party discover a plant that the young naturalist Harbert identifies as such. The other castaways keep the discovery secret until they can dry and cure the leaves. One evening, Pencroff is offered some coffee by his friends. When he declines, they say, \"A pipe, then?\" and produce a homemade pipe stuffed full, with a coal to light it. Pencroff exclaims, \"O, divine Providence! sacred Author of all things!&nbsp;...

They are various [[ester]]s of [[cyanoacrylic acid]]. The [[acryl group]]s in the [[resin]] rapidly [[polymer]]ize in the presence of water to form long, strong chains. They have some minor toxicity.\n \nSpecific cyanoacrylates include [[methyl cyanoacrylate|methyl 2-cyanoacrylate]] (MCA), [[ethyl cyanoacrylate|ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate]] (ECA, commonly sold under trade names such as \"Super Glue\" and \"Krazy Glue\", or Toagosei), [[butyl cyanoacrylate|''n''-butyl cyanoacrylate]] (n-BCA), [[octyl cyanoacrylate]] and [[2-octyl cyanoacrylate]] (used in medical, veterinary and first aid applications). Octyl cyanoacrylate was developed to address toxicity concerns and to reduce skin irritation and allergic response. Cyanoacrylate adhesives are sometimes known generically as '''instant glues''', '''power glues''' or '''superglues'''. The abbreviation \"CA\" is commonly used for industrial grade cyanoacrylate.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Harry Wesley Coover Jr.png|thumb|Harry Wesley Coover Jr. shortly before being awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation in 2010]]\nThe original patent for cyanoacrylate was filed in 1942 by the B.F. Goodrich Company<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ardis|first1=Alan|title=Patent for synthesis of cyanoacrylate|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US2467927|website=Google patents|accessdate=22 February 2016}}</ref> as an outgrowth of a search for materials suitable for clear plastic [[Sight (device)|gun sights]] for [[World War II|the war]] effort. In 1942, a team of scientists headed by [[Harry Coover]] Jr. stumbled upon a formulation that stuck to everything with which it came in contact.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/coover.html |title=Inventor of the Week Archive |date=September 2004 |publisher=Lemelson-MIT Program |accessdate=13 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503111504/http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/coover.html |archivedate=3 May 2009 }}</ref> The team quickly rejected the substance for the wartime application, but in 1951, while working as researchers for [[Eastman Kodak]], Coover and a colleague, Fred Joyner, rediscovered cyanoacrylates. The two realized the true commercial potential, and a form of the adhesive was first sold in 1958 under the title \"Eastman #910\" (later \"Eastman 910\").\n\nDuring the 1960s, Eastman Kodak sold cyanoacrylate to [[Loctite]], which in turn repackaged and distributed it under a different brand name \"Loctite Quick Set 404\". In 1971, Loctite developed its own manufacturing technology and introduced its own line of cyanoacrylate, called \"Super Bonder\". Loctite quickly gained market share, and by the late 1970s it was believed to have exceeded Eastman Kodak's share in the North American industrial cyanoacrylate market. National Starch and Chemical Company purchased Eastman Kodak's cyanoacrylate business and combined it with several acquisitions made throughout the 1970s forming Permabond. Other manufacturers of cyanoacrylate include LePage (a Canadian company acquired by [[Henkel]] in 1996), the Permabond Division of National Starch and Chemical, which was a subsidiary of [[Unilever]]. Together, Loctite, Eastman and Permabond accounted for approximately 75% of the industrial cyanoacrylate market.<ref>HBS, \"Loctite Corporation: Industrial Product Group,\" 15 July 1991, p.3</ref> {{As of|2019}} Permabond continued to manufacture the original 910 formula.<ref>https://www.permabond.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/910_TDS.pdf |date=August 2019</ref>\n\n==Properties==\nIn its liquid form, cyanoacrylate consists of [[monomer]]s of cyanoacrylate ester molecules. Methyl 2-cyanoacrylate (CH<sub>2</sub>=C(C\u2261N)COOCH<sub>3</sub>) has a [[Molecular mass|molecular weight]] of 111.1&nbsp;g/mol, a [[Flash point|flashpoint]] of {{Cvt|79|C|F K}}, and a density of 1.1&nbsp;g/mL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/icsc/icsc/eics1272.htm|title=ICSC 1272 - METHYL 2-CYANOACRYLATE}}</ref> Ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate ((CH<sub>2</sub>=C(C\u2261N)COOCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>)) has a molecular weight of 125&nbsp;g/mol and a flashpoint of more than {{Cvt|75|C|F K}}. To facilitate easy handling, a cyanoacrylate adhesive is frequently formulated with an ingredient such as [[fumed silica]] to make it more [[viscous]] or gel-like. More recently, formulations are available with additives to increase [[shear strength]], creating a more impact resistant bond. Such additives may include [[Natural rubber|rubber]], as in Loctite's \"Ultra Gel\", or others which are not specified.\n\nIn general, the acryl groups rapidly undergo [[chain-growth polymerisation]] in the presence of water (specifically [[hydroxide ion]]s), forming long, strong chains, joining the bonded surfaces together. Because the presence of moisture causes the glue to set, exposure to normal levels of [[humidity]] in the air causes a thin skin to start to form within seconds, which very greatly slows the reaction; hence, cyanoacrylates are applied as thin coats to ensure that the reaction proceeds rapidly for bonding.\n\nCyanoacrylate adhesives have a short [[shelf life]]\u2014about one year from manufacture if unopened, and one month once opened. The reaction with moisture can cause a container of glue which has been opened and resealed to become unusable more quickly than if never opened. To minimise this reduction in shelf life, cyanoacrylate, once opened, should be stored in an airtight container with a package of [[silica gel]] [[desiccant]]. Another technique is to insert a [[hypodermic needle]] into the opening of a tube. After using the glue, residual glue soon clogs the needle, keeping moisture out. The clog is removed by heating the needle (e.g. with a lighter) before use.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} The polymerisation is also temperature-dependent: storage below freezing point of water, {{Cvt|0|C|F K}}, stops the reaction, so keeping it in the freezer is also effective.\n[[Image:Cyanacrylat polymerisation.svg|thumb|center|585px|Polymerization of methyl 2-cyanoacrylate]]\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:Super glue.jpg|thumb|A tube of \"Super Glue\", a cyanoacrylate glue]]\n\n===Behaviours===\nCyanoacrylates are mainly used as adhesives. They require some care and knowledge for effective use: they do not bond some materials; they do not fill spaces, unlike [[epoxy|epoxies]], and a very thin layer bonds more effectively than a thicker one that does not cure properly; they bond many substances, including human skin and tissues. They have an [[exothermic]] reaction to natural fibres: cotton, wool, leather, see [[Cyanoacrylate#cotton|reaction with cotton]] below.\n\nCyanoacrylate glue has a low [[Shearing (physics)|shearing]] strength, which has led to its use as a temporary adhesive in cases where the piece needs to be sheared off later. Common examples include mounting a workpiece to a sacrificial glue block on a [[lathe]], and tightening pins and bolts. It is also used in conjunction with another, slower, but more resilient adhesive as a way of rapidly forming a joint, which then holds the pieces in the appropriate configuration until the second adhesive has set.\n\nCyanoacrylate-based glue has a weak bond with smooth surfaces and as such easily gives to friction; a good example of this is the fact that cyanoacrylates may be removed from human skin by means of abrasives (e.g. sugar or sandpaper).\n\n===Electronics===\nCyanoacrylates are used to assemble prototype [[electronics]] (used in [[wire wrap]]), flying [[model aircraft]], and as retention dressings for [[nut (hardware)|nut]]s and [[screw#bolt|bolt]]s. Their effectiveness in bonding metal and general versatility have made them popular among [[scale model|modeling]] and [[Miniature figure (gaming)|miniatures]] hobbyists.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n===Aquaria===\nCyanoacrylate glue's ability to resist water has made it popular with [[marine aquarium]] hobbyists for [[Fragmentation (reproduction)|fragmenting]] corals. The cut branches of [[Scleractinia|hard corals]], such as [[Acropora]], can be glued to a piece of [[live rock]] (harvested reef coral) or [[Milliput]] (epoxy putty) to allow the new fragment to grow out. It is safe to use directly in the tank, unlike [[silicone]] which must be cured to be safe. However, as a class of adhesives, traditional cyanoacrylates are classified as having \"weak\" resistance to both moisture and heat<ref>{{Cite book |last = Petrie |first = Edward M. |title = Handbook of adhesives and sealants |publisher = McGraw-Hill |year = 2000 |location = New York |page = 354 |isbn = 978-0-07-049888-4}}</ref> although the inclusion of [[phthalic anhydride]] reportedly counteracts both of these characteristics.<ref>{{Cite book |last = Petrie |first = Edward M. |title = Handbook of adhesives and sealants |publisher = McGraw-Hill |year = 2000 |location = New York |page = 389 |isbn = 978-0-07-049888-4}}</ref> Cyanoacrylate glue is also used frequently in [[aquascaping]] both freshwater and marine aquariums for the purpose of securing the rhizomes of live plants to pieces of wood or stone.\n\n===Smooth surfaces===\nMost standard cyanoacrylate adhesives do not bond well with smooth [[glass]], although they can be used as a quick, temporary bond prior to application of an epoxy or cyanoacrylate specifically formulated for use on glass.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nautarch.tamu.edu/crl/conservationmanual/File5.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141203232512/http://nautarch.tamu.edu/crl/conservationmanual/File5.htm |archivedate=3 December 2014 }}</ref> A [[Adhesion#Mechanical|mechanical adhesive]] bond may be formed around [[glass fibre]] mat or tissue to reinforce joints or to fabricate small parts.\n\n===Filler===\nWhen added to baking soda ([[sodium bicarbonate]]), cyanoacrylate glue forms a hard, lightweight adhesive filler. This works well with porous materials that do not work well with the adhesive alone. This method is sometimes used by aircraft modelers to assemble or repair [[polystyrene]] foam parts. It is also used to repair small nicks in the leading edge of wood [[propeller]] blades on light aircraft,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eaavideo.org/detail/video/1674033145|title=Propeller Field Repair|website=www.eaavideo.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131024307/http://www.eaavideo.org/detail/video/1674033145|archive-date=31 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> although this technique is limited to use on aircraft registered in the \"experimental\" category (composite propellers can be repaired in a similar way using two-part epoxies<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eaavideo.org/detail/video/2111048001|title=Composite Propeller Repair|website=www.eaavideo.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131023800/http://www.eaavideo.org/detail/video/2111048001|archive-date=31 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>). This technique can also be used to fill in the slots in the [[Nut (string instrument)|nut of a guitar]] so that new ones can be cut. The reaction between cyanoacrylate and baking soda is very exothermic (heat-producing) and also produces noxious vapors.\n\nOne brand of cyanoacrylate, \"SupaFix\", uses [[calcium oxide]] as a filler giving an even harder (mortar-like in texture) result that can be used to join hard materials and even repair cracked castings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ffx.co.uk/tools/product/Supafix-Apx4-700461275251-Ultra-Strength-Superglue-Adhesive-And-Powders-Kit|title=S-FIXX APX4 Ultra Strength Superglue Adhesive and Powders Kit}}</ref>\n\n===Forensics===\nCyanoacrylate is used as a [[forensic]] tool to capture [[latent fingerprint]]s on non-porous surfaces like glass, [[plastic]], etc.<ref>[http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/feneric/cyanoacrylate.html Eric W.

The ridges can then be recorded. The developed fingerprints are, on most surfaces (except on white plastic or similar), visible to the naked eye. Invisible or poorly visible prints can be further enhanced by applying a luminescent or non-luminescent stain.\n\n===Woodworking===\nThin cyanoacrylate glue has application in [[woodworking]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.finewoodworking.com/2016/03/30/super-glue-to-the-rescue|title=Fine Woodworking: Super Glue to the Rescue|language=en|access-date=2018-06-30|date=30 March 2016}}</ref> It can be used as a fast-drying, glossy finish. The use of oil, such as [[boiled linseed oil]], may be used to control the rate at which the cyanoacrylate cures. Cyanoacrylate glue is also used in combination with [[sawdust]] (from a saw or sanding) to fill voids and cracks. These repair methods are used on piano [[Sound board (music)|soundboards]], wood instruments, and wood furniture. Cyanoacrylate glue is also used in the finishing of pen blanks (wooden blanks for turning pens) that have been turned on a lathe by applying multiple thin layers to build up a hard, clear finish that can then be sanded and polished to a glossy finish.\n\n===Medical and veterinary===\n[[File:Incision wound on child's arm, closed with Dermabond.jpg|alt=The arm of a child with a small cut, with a shiny layer of adhesive covering the cut region|thumb|An incision wound closed with Dermabond, a cyanoacrylate-based medical adhesive]]\nCyanoacrylate glue was in veterinary use for mending bone, hide, and tortoise shell by the early 1970s or before.

They are various [[ester]]s of [[cyanoacrylic acid]]. The [[acryl group]]s in the [[resin]] rapidly [[polymer]]ize in the presence of water to form long, strong chains. They have some minor toxicity.\n \nSpecific cyanoacrylates include [[methyl cyanoacrylate|methyl 2-cyanoacrylate]] (MCA), [[ethyl cyanoacrylate|ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate]] (ECA, commonly sold under trade names such as \"Super Glue\" and \"Krazy Glue\", or Toagosei), [[butyl cyanoacrylate|''n''-butyl cyanoacrylate]] (n-BCA), [[octyl cyanoacrylate]] and [[2-octyl cyanoacrylate]] (used in medical, veterinary and first aid applications). Octyl cyanoacrylate was developed to address toxicity concerns and to reduce skin irritation and allergic response. Cyanoacrylate adhesives are sometimes known generically as '''instant glues''', '''power glues''' or '''superglues'''. The abbreviation \"CA\" is commonly used for industrial grade cyanoacrylate.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Harry Wesley Coover Jr.png|thumb|Harry Wesley Coover Jr. shortly before being awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation in 2010]]\nThe original patent for cyanoacrylate was filed in 1942 by the B.F.

The two realized the true commercial potential, and a form of the adhesive was first sold in 1958 under the title \"Eastman #910\" (later \"Eastman 910\").\n\nDuring the 1960s, Eastman Kodak sold cyanoacrylate to [[Loctite]], which in turn repackaged and distributed it under a different brand name \"Loctite Quick Set 404\". In 1971, Loctite developed its own manufacturing technology and introduced its own line of cyanoacrylate, called \"Super Bonder\". Loctite quickly gained market share, and by the late 1970s it was believed to have exceeded Eastman Kodak's share in the North American industrial cyanoacrylate market. National Starch and Chemical Company purchased Eastman Kodak's cyanoacrylate business and combined it with several acquisitions made throughout the 1970s forming Permabond. Other manufacturers of cyanoacrylate include LePage (a Canadian company acquired by [[Henkel]] in 1996), the Permabond Division of National Starch and Chemical, which was a subsidiary of [[Unilever]]. Together, Loctite, Eastman and Permabond accounted for approximately 75% of the industrial cyanoacrylate market.<ref>HBS, \"Loctite Corporation: Industrial Product Group,\" 15 July 1991, p.3</ref> {{As of|2019}} Permabond continued to manufacture the original 910 formula.<ref>https://www.permabond.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/910_TDS.pdf |date=August 2019</ref>\n\n==Properties==\nIn its liquid form, cyanoacrylate consists of [[monomer]]s of cyanoacrylate ester molecules. Methyl 2-cyanoacrylate (CH<sub>2</sub>=C(C\u2261N)COOCH<sub>3</sub>) has a [[Molecular mass|molecular weight]] of 111.1&nbsp;g/mol, a [[Flash point|flashpoint]] of {{Cvt|79|C|F K}}, and a density of 1.1&nbsp;g/mL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/icsc/icsc/eics1272.htm|title=ICSC 1272 - METHYL 2-CYANOACRYLATE}}</ref> Ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate ((CH<sub>2</sub>=C(C\u2261N)COOCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>)) has a molecular weight of 125&nbsp;g/mol and a flashpoint of more than {{Cvt|75|C|F K}}. To facilitate easy handling, a cyanoacrylate adhesive is frequently formulated with an ingredient such as [[fumed silica]] to make it more [[viscous]] or gel-like. More recently, formulations are available with additives to increase [[shear strength]], creating a more impact resistant bond. Such additives may include [[Natural rubber|rubber]], as in Loctite's \"Ultra Gel\", or others which are not specified.\n\nIn general, the acryl groups rapidly undergo [[chain-growth polymerisation]] in the presence of water (specifically [[hydroxide ion]]s), forming long, strong chains, joining the bonded surfaces together. Because the presence of moisture causes the glue to set, exposure to normal levels of [[humidity]] in the air causes a thin skin to start to form within seconds, which very greatly slows the reaction; hence, cyanoacrylates are applied as thin coats to ensure that the reaction proceeds rapidly for bonding.\n\nCyanoacrylate adhesives have a short [[shelf life]]\u2014about one year from manufacture if unopened, and one month once opened. The reaction with moisture can cause a container of glue which has been opened and resealed to become unusable more quickly than if never opened. To minimise this reduction in shelf life, cyanoacrylate, once opened, should be stored in an airtight container with a package of [[silica gel]] [[desiccant]]. Another technique is to insert a [[hypodermic needle]] into the opening of a tube. After using the glue, residual glue soon clogs the needle, keeping moisture out. The clog is removed by heating the needle (e.g. with a lighter) before use.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} The polymerisation is also temperature-dependent: storage below freezing point of water, {{Cvt|0|C|F K}}, stops the reaction, so keeping it in the freezer is also effective.\n[[Image:Cyanacrylat polymerisation.svg|thumb|center|585px|Polymerization of methyl 2-cyanoacrylate]]\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:Super glue.jpg|thumb|A tube of \"Super Glue\", a cyanoacrylate glue]]\n\n===Behaviours===\nCyanoacrylates are mainly used as adhesives. They require some care and knowledge for effective use: they do not bond some materials; they do not fill spaces, unlike [[epoxy|epoxies]], and a very thin layer bonds more effectively than a thicker one that does not cure properly; they bond many substances, including human skin and tissues. They have an [[exothermic]] reaction to natural fibres: cotton, wool, leather, see [[Cyanoacrylate#cotton|reaction with cotton]] below.\n\nCyanoacrylate glue has a low [[Shearing (physics)|shearing]] strength, which has led to its use as a temporary adhesive in cases where the piece needs to be sheared off later. Common examples include mounting a workpiece to a sacrificial glue block on a [[lathe]], and tightening pins and bolts. It is also used in conjunction with another, slower, but more resilient adhesive as a way of rapidly forming a joint, which then holds the pieces in the appropriate configuration until the second adhesive has set.\n\nCyanoacrylate-based glue has a weak bond with smooth surfaces and as such easily gives to friction; a good example of this is the fact that cyanoacrylates may be removed from human skin by means of abrasives (e.g. sugar or sandpaper).\n\n===Electronics===\nCyanoacrylates are used to assemble prototype [[electronics]] (used in [[wire wrap]]), flying [[model aircraft]], and as retention dressings for [[nut (hardware)|nut]]s and [[screw#bolt|bolt]]s. Their effectiveness in bonding metal and general versatility have made them popular among [[scale model|modeling]] and [[Miniature figure (gaming)|miniatures]] hobbyists.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n===Aquaria===\nCyanoacrylate glue's ability to resist water has made it popular with [[marine aquarium]] hobbyists for [[Fragmentation (reproduction)|fragmenting]] corals.

The use of oil, such as [[boiled linseed oil]], may be used to control the rate at which the cyanoacrylate cures. Cyanoacrylate glue is also used in combination with [[sawdust]] (from a saw or sanding) to fill voids and cracks. These repair methods are used on piano [[Sound board (music)|soundboards]], wood instruments, and wood furniture.
