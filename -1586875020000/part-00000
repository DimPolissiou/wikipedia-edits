Joicey was a [[fellow]] of the [[Zoological Society of London]], the [[Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society|Royal Geographical Society]], the [[Royal Entomological Society]], the [[Royal Horticultural Society]], and the [[Linnean Society of London]].\n\nJoicey employed specialist entomologists including [[George Talbot (entomologist)|George Talbot]] to curate his collection and financed numerous expeditions throughout the world to obtain previously unknown varieties. Over 190 scientific articles were produced during the active period of the Hill Museum. This body of research was described as \"a contribution to the study of the exotic Lepidoptera of very great scientific value.\"<ref name=\"Riley\" />{{Rp|144}}\n\nJoicey's donations from his collection, made both during his life and following his death, contributed significantly to the quality and numerical predominance of the Lepidoptera collection held by the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], [[London]].

In that year, ''Farmer and Settler'' published the account of a local historian who had interviewed two men who had known Smith. One of those interviewed recalled that, in 1868, he (then twelve years old) and his father had been invited to Smith's farm to inspect a [[chance seedling]] that had sprung near a creek. Smith had dumped there, among the ferns, the remains of French [[Malus|crab-apples]] that had been grown in [[Tasmania]].<ref name=\"Martin 2005\">{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Megan|title=Smith, Maria Ann (1799\u20131870)|year=2005|publisher=Australian Dictionary of Biography|location=Canberra, ACT|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/smith-maria-ann-13199}}</ref> Another story recounted that Smith had been testing French crab-apples for cooking, and, throwing the apple cores out her window as she worked, had found that the new cultivar had sprung up underneath her kitchen windowsill. Whatever the case, Smith took it upon herself to [[Fruit tree propagation|propagate]] the new cultivar on her property, finding the apples good for cooking and for general consumption.<ref name =Symons>{{cite book|last=Symons|first=Michael|title=One Continuous Picnic: A Gastronomic History of Australia|year=2007|publisher=Melbourne University Press|location=Carlton, Victoria|isbn=978-0522853230|pages=110\u2013112|edition=2nd}}</ref> Having \"all the appearances of a cooking apple,\" they were not tart but instead were \"sweet and crisp to eat.\"<ref name=Christie/> She took a stall at Sydney's George Street market, where the apples stored \"exceptionally well and became popular\" and \"once a week sold her produce there.\"<ref name=Christie/>\nMoo\nSmith died only a couple of years after her discovery (in 1870), but her work had been noticed by other local planters. Edward Gallard was one such planter, who extensively planted Granny Smith trees on his property and bought the Smith farm when Thomas died in 1876. Gallard was successful in marketing the apple locally, but it did not receive widespread attention until 1890. In that year, it was exhibited as \"Smith's Seedling\" at the [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]] Agricultural and Horticultural Show, and the following year it won the prize for cooking apples under the name ''\"Granny'' Smith's Seedling.\" The apple was so highly successful that the following year, many were exhibiting Granny Smith apples at horticultural shows.<ref name= RydeCouncil/>\n\nIn 1895, the New South Wales Department of Agriculture recognised the cultivar and had begun growing the trees at the Government Experimental Station in [[Bathurst, New South Wales]], recommending the gazette its properties as a late-picking cooking apple for potential export.

In that year, ''Farmer and Settler'' published the account of a local historian who had interviewed two men who had known Smith. One of those interviewed recalled that, in 1868, he (then twelve years old) and his father had been invited to Smith's farm to inspect a [[chance seedling]] that had sprung near a creek. Smith had dumped there, among the ferns, the remains of French [[Malus|crab-apples]] that had been grown in [[Tasmania]].<ref name=\"Martin 2005\">{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Megan|title=Smith, Maria Ann (1799\u20131870)|year=2005|publisher=Australian Dictionary of Biography|location=Canberra, ACT|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/smith-maria-ann-13199}}</ref> Another story recounted that Smith had been testing French crab-apples for cooking, and, throwing the apple cores out her window as she worked, had found that the new cultivar had sprung up underneath her kitchen windowsill. Whatever the case, Smith took it upon herself to [[Fruit tree propagation|propagate]] the new cultivar on her property, finding the apples good for cooking and for general consumption.<ref name =Symons>{{cite book|last=Symons|first=Michael|title=One Continuous Picnic: A Gastronomic History of Australia|year=2007|publisher=Melbourne University Press|location=Carlton, Victoria|isbn=978-0522853230|pages=110\u2013112|edition=2nd}}</ref> Having \"all the appearances of a cooking apple,\" they were not tart but instead were \"sweet and crisp to eat.\"<ref name=Christie/> She took a stall at Sydney's George Street market, where the apples stored \"exceptionally well and became popular\" and \"once a week sold her produce there.\"<ref name=Christie/>\n\nSmith died only a couple of years after her discovery (in 1870), but her work had been noticed by other local planters. Edward Gallard was one such planter, who extensively planted Granny Smith trees on his property and bought the Smith farm when Thomas died in 1876. Gallard was successful in marketing the apple locally, but it did not receive widespread attention until 1890. In that year, it was exhibited as \"Smith's Seedling\" at the [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]] Agricultural and Horticultural Show, and the following year it won the prize for cooking apples under the name ''\"Granny'' Smith's Seedling.\" The apple was so highly successful that the following year, many were exhibiting Granny Smith apples at horticultural shows.<ref name= RydeCouncil/>\n\nIn 1895, the New South Wales Department of Agriculture recognised the cultivar and had begun growing the trees at the Government Experimental Station in [[Bathurst, New South Wales]], recommending the gazette its properties as a late-picking cooking apple for potential export.

It resides through most of eastern and central United States, although western populations may be migratory. Resident populations are also found in Newfoundland, Canada, while breeding populations can be found across southern Canada. It breeds in both [[deciduous]] and [[coniferous]] forests, and is common in residential areas. It is predominantly blue with a white chest and underparts, and a blue crest; it has a black, U-shaped collar around its neck and a black border behind the crest. Males and females are similar in size and plumage, and plumage does not vary throughout the year. Four subspecies of the blue jay have been recognized.\n\nThe blue jay mainly feeds on nuts and seeds such as [[acorn]]s, soft fruits, [[arthropods]], and occasionally small vertebrates. It typically [[gleaning (birds)|gleans]] food from trees, shrubs, and the ground, though it sometimes [[hawking (birds)|hawks]] insects from the air. Like squirrels, blue jays are known to hide nuts for later consumption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/seriouslyscience/2014/05/07/blue-jays-coming-hide-kids-hide-nuts/|title=The blue jays are coming!

The clutch can contain two to seven eggs, which are blueish or light brown with brown spots. Young are [[altricial]], and are brooded by the female for 8\u201312 days after hatching. They may remain with their parents for one to two months.\n\nThe name \"jay\" derives from its noisy, garrulous nature and has been applied to other birds of the same family, which are also mostly gregarious.<ref>{{cite book |last=Coues |first=Elliot |title=Key to North American birds |edition=5th |date=1890 |publisher=Estes and Lauriat |location=Boston, MA |oclc=469020022 |page=326}}</ref> It is sometimes called a \"jaybird\".<ref>{{cite web |title=jaybird \u2013 definition of jaybird by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/jaybird |accessdate=April 20, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe blue jay was first described as  ''Pica glandaria c\u00e6rulea cristata'' in [[England|English]] naturalist [[Mark Catesby]]'s 1731 publication of ''Natural History of Carolina, Florida, and the Bahamas''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Catesby|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Catesby|title=Natural History of Carolina, Florida, and the Bahamas|edition=1st|date=1731|publisher=Royal Society House|location=[[London]]|page=87|url=http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/dmisc/id/1658/show/1487}}</ref> It was later described as ''Corvus cristatus'' in [[Carl Linnaeus]]' 1758 edition of ''[[Systema Naturae]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Linnaeus|first=C.|authorlink=Carl Linnaeus|title=Systema Naturae per Regna Tria Naturae, Secundum Classes, Ordines, Genera, Species, cum Characteribus, Differentiis, Synonymis, Locis.

It may withdraw several hundred kilometres south in the northernmost parts of its range. Thousands of blue jays have been observed to migrate in flocks along the Great Lakes and Atlantic coasts. It migrates during the daytime, in loose flocks of 5 to 250 birds. Much about their migratory behavior remains a mystery. Some are present throughout winter in all parts of their range. Young jays may be more likely to migrate than adults, but many adults also migrate. Some individual jays migrate south one year, stay north the next winter, and then migrate south again the next year. To date, no one has concretely worked out why they migrate when they do. Likely, it is related to weather conditions and how abundant the winter food sources are, which can determine whether other northern birds will move south.<ref name=eggeater/>\n\nThe blue jay occupies a variety of habitats within its large range, from the [[pine]] woods of Florida to the [[spruce]]-[[fir]] forests of northern Ontario. It is less abundant in denser forests, preferring mixed woodlands with [[oak]]s and [[beech]]es.<ref name=nero1991/> It has expertly adapted to human activity, occurring in parks and residential areas, and can adapt to wholesale [[deforestation]] with relative ease if human activity creates other means for the jays to get by.<ref name=henninger1906/>\n\n==Subspecies==\nFour [[subspecies]] are generally accepted, though the variation within this species is rather subtle and essentially [[cline (population genetics)|clinal]]. No firm boundaries can be drawn between the inland subspecies. The ranges of the coastal races are better delimited.<ref name=Madge/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Image !! Subspecies!!

Any suitable tree or large bush may be used for nesting, though an evergreen is preferred. The nest is preferentially built at a height in the trees of {{convert|3|to|10|m|ft|abbr=on}}. It is cup-shaped and composed of twigs, small roots, bark strips, moss, other plant material, cloth, paper, and feathers, with occasional mud added to the cup.\n\nBlue jays are not very picky about nesting locations. If no better place is available \u2013 e.g. in a heavily [[deforestation|deforested]] area \u2013 they will even use places like the large [[Letter box|mailboxes]] typical of the rural United States.<ref name=henninger1906/> They also appropriate nests of other mid-sized songbirds as long as these are placed in suitable spots; [[American robin]] nests are commonly used by blue jays, for example.\n[[File:Blue Jay Cyanocitta cristata Fledgling.jpg|thumb|left|Fledgling in mid-June]]\n[[File:Blue Jay fledgling head.JPG|thumb|Fledgling head]]\nBlue jays typically form [[monogamy|monogamous]] pair bonds for life. Both sexes build the nest and rear the young, though only the female broods them. The male feeds the female while she is brooding the eggs.

Like other [[corvid]]s, they may learn to mimic human speech. Blue jays can also copy the cries of local hawks so well that it is sometimes difficult to tell which it is.<ref name=George2003/> Their voice is typical of most [[jay]]s in being varied, but the most commonly recognized sound is the alarm call, which is a loud, almost [[gull]]-like scream. There is also a high-pitched ''jayer-jayer'' call that increases in speed as the bird becomes more agitated. This particular call can be easily confused with the chickadee's song because of the slow starting ''chick-ah-dee-ee''. Blue jays will use these calls to band together to [[Mobbing behavior|mob]] potential predators such as [[hawk]]s and drive them away from the jays' nests.\n\n{{Listen\n| filename=Cyanocitta cristata - Blue Jay - XC86756.ogg\n| title=\"Rusty pump\" calls\n}}\n\nBlue jays also have quiet, almost subliminal calls which they use among themselves in proximity. One of the most distinctive calls of this type is often referred to as the \"rusty pump\" owing to its squeaky resemblance to the sound of an old hand-operated [[water pump]]. The blue jay (and other corvids) are distinct from most other songbirds for using their call as a song.\n\n==Cultural symbolism and interpretation==\nIn old [[African-American folktales|African American folklore]] of the southern United States, the blue jay was a significant metaphysical creature. In some tales the blue jay was credited with making the earth \"when all de worl' was water\" by bringing the first \"grit\" or \"dirt\". In other tales the blue jay was temporarily conscripted as a servant of the Devil to bring \"kindling\" to the \"bad place\": and \"was not encountered on a Friday as he was fetching sticks down to Hell; furthermore, he was so happy and chirpy on a Saturday as he was relieved to return from Hell\". <ref name=ingersoll23>{{cite book |last=Ingersoll |first=Ernest |authorlink=Ernest Ingersoll |title=Birds in legend, fable and folklore |publisher=Longmans, Green and Co. |location=New York |date=1923 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/birdsinlegendfab00inge/page/166 166]\u2013167 |url=https://archive.org/details/birdsinlegendfab00inge |accessdate=2009-08-08}}</ref>\n\nThe blue jay was adopted as the team symbol of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] [[Major League Baseball]] team, as well as some of their [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] affiliates. Their [[mascot]], [[Toronto Blue Jays mascots|Ace]], is an anthropomorphic blue jay. The blue jay is also the official mascot for [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[Elmhurst College]], and [[Creighton University]]. The latter two spell the name as one word - Bluejay. It is also the [[List of Canadian provincial and territorial symbols|provincial bird]] of the province of [[Prince Edward Island]] in Canada.\n\nIn the 1966 Western film ''[[The Shooting]]'', the blue jay is cited as a sign of good luck.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em|refs=\n<ref name=CLO>[http://www.birds.cornell.edu/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Blue_Jay_dtl.html Blue Jay, Life History, All About Birds - Cornell Lab of Ornithology<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n<ref name=Frysinger>{{cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Cyanocitta_cristata.html|title=ADW: Cyanocitta cristata: INFORMATION|work=Animal Diversity Web}}</ref><!-- there is some more information here e.g. on predators and status -->\n\n<ref name=George2003>George, Philip Brandt.

It resides through most of eastern and central United States, although western populations may be migratory. Resident populations are also found in Newfoundland, Canada, while breeding populations can be found across southern Canada. It breeds in both [[deciduous]] and [[coniferous]] forests, and is common in residential areas. It is predominantly blue with a white chest and underparts, and a blue crest; it has a black, U-shaped collar around its neck and a black border behind the crest. Males and females are similar in size and plumage, and plumage does not vary throughout the year. Four subspecies of the blue jay have been recognized.\n\nThe blue jay mainly feeds on nuts and seeds such as [[acorn]]s, soft fruits, [[arthropods]], and occasionally small vertebrates. It typically [[gleaning (birds)|gleans]] food from trees, shrubs, and the ground, though it sometimes [[hawking (birds)|hawks]] insects from the air. Like squirrels, blue jays are known to hide nuts for later consumption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/seriouslyscience/2014/05/07/blue-jays-coming-hide-kids-hide-nuts/|title=The blue jays are coming!

The clutch can contain two to seven eggs, which are blueish or light brown with brown spots. Young are [[altricial]], and are brooded by the female for 8\u201312 days after hatching. They may remain with their parents for one to two months.\n\nThe name \"jay\" derives from its noisy, garrulous nature and has been applied to other birds of the same family, which are also mostly gregarious.<ref>{{cite book |last=Coues |first=Elliot |title=Key to North American birds |edition=5th |date=1890 |publisher=Estes and Lauriat |location=Boston, MA |oclc=469020022 |page=326}}</ref> It is sometimes called a \"jaybird\".<ref>{{cite web |title=jaybird \u2013 definition of jaybird by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/jaybird |accessdate=April 20, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe blue jay was first described as  ''Pica glandaria c\u00e6rulea cristata'' in [[England|English]] naturalist [[Mark Catesby]]'s 1731 publication of ''Natural History of Carolina, Florida, and the Bahamas''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Catesby|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Catesby|title=Natural History of Carolina, Florida, and the Bahamas|edition=1st|date=1731|publisher=Royal Society House|location=[[London]]|page=87|url=http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/dmisc/id/1658/show/1487}}</ref> It was later described as ''Corvus cristatus'' in [[Carl Linnaeus]]' 1758 edition of ''[[Systema Naturae]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Linnaeus|first=C.|authorlink=Carl Linnaeus|title=Systema Naturae per Regna Tria Naturae, Secundum Classes, Ordines, Genera, Species, cum Characteribus, Differentiis, Synonymis, Locis.

It may withdraw several hundred kilometres south in the northernmost parts of its range. Thousands of blue jays have been observed to migrate in flocks along the Great Lakes and Atlantic coasts. It migrates during the daytime, in loose flocks of 5 to 250 birds. Much about their migratory behavior remains a mystery. Some are present throughout winter in all parts of their range. Young jays may be more likely to migrate than adults, but many adults also migrate. Some individual jays migrate south one year, stay north the next winter, and then migrate south again the next year. To date, no one has concretely worked out why they migrate when they do. Likely, it is related to weather conditions and how abundant the winter food sources are, which can determine whether other northern birds will move south.<ref name=eggeater/>\n\nThe blue jay occupies a variety of habitats within its large range, from the [[pine]] woods of Florida to the [[spruce]]-[[fir]] forests of northern Ontario. It is less abundant in denser forests, preferring mixed woodlands with [[oak]]s and [[beech]]es.<ref name=nero1991/> It has expertly adapted to human activity, occurring in parks and residential areas, and can adapt to wholesale [[deforestation]] with relative ease if human activity creates other means for the jays to get by.<ref name=henninger1906/>\n\n==Subspecies==\nFour [[subspecies]] are generally accepted, though the variation within this species is rather subtle and essentially [[cline (population genetics)|clinal]].

Any suitable tree or large bush may be used for nesting, though an evergreen is preferred. The nest is preferentially built at a height in the trees of {{convert|3|to|10|m|ft|abbr=on}}. It is cup-shaped and composed of twigs, small roots, bark strips, moss, other plant material, cloth, paper, and feathers, with occasional mud added to the cup.\n\nBlue jays are not very picky about nesting locations. If no better place is available \u2013 e.g. in a heavily [[deforestation|deforested]] area \u2013 they will even use places like the large [[Letter box|mailboxes]] typical of the rural United States.<ref name=henninger1906/> They also appropriate nests of other mid-sized songbirds as long as these are placed in suitable spots; [[American robin]] nests are commonly used by blue jays, for example.\n[[File:Blue Jay Cyanocitta cristata Fledgling.jpg|thumb|left|Fledgling in mid-June]]\n[[File:Blue Jay fledgling head.JPG|thumb|Fledgling head]]\nBlue jays typically form [[monogamy|monogamous]] pair bonds for life. Both sexes build the nest and rear the young, though only the female broods them. The male feeds the female while she is brooding the eggs. There are usually between 3 and 6 (averaging 4 or 5) eggs laid and [[avian incubation|incubated]] over 16\u201318 days. The young [[fledge]] usually between 17\u201321 days after hatching.<ref name=oiseauxnet2008/>\n\nAfter the juveniles fledge, the family travels and forages together until early fall, when the young birds disperse to avoid competition for food during the winter. Sexual maturity is reached after one year of age. Blue jays have been recorded to live for more than 26 years in captivity and one wild jay was found to have been around 16\u201317, and a half years old.<ref>{{cite web |title=Longevity Records Of North American Birds |publisher=U.

However, despite several major local declines, overall blue jays have not seemed to have been depleted by the disease.<ref name=ADW/>\n\n==Vocalizations==\nBlue jays can make a large variety of sounds, and individuals may vary perceptibly in their calling style. Like other [[corvid]]s, they may learn to mimic human speech. Blue jays can also copy the cries of local hawks so well that it is sometimes difficult to tell which it is.<ref name=George2003/> Their voice is typical of most [[jay]]s in being varied, but the most commonly recognized sound is the alarm call, which is a loud, almost [[gull]]-like scream. There is also a high-pitched ''jayer-jayer'' call that increases in speed as the bird becomes more agitated. This particular call can be easily confused with the chickadee's song because of the slow starting ''chick-ah-dee-ee''. Blue jays will use these calls to band together to [[Mobbing behavior|mob]] potential predators such as [[hawk]]s and drive them away from the jays' nests.\n\n{{Listen\n| filename=Cyanocitta cristata - Blue Jay - XC86756.ogg\n| title=\"Rusty pump\" calls\n}}\n\nBlue jays also have quiet, almost subliminal calls which they use among themselves in proximity. One of the most distinctive calls of this type is often referred to as the \"rusty pump\" owing to its squeaky resemblance to the sound of an old hand-operated [[water pump]]. The blue jay (and other corvids) are distinct from most other songbirds for using their call as a song.\n\n==Cultural symbolism and interpretation==\nIn old [[African-American folktales|African American folklore]] of the southern United States, the blue jay was a significant metaphysical creature. In some tales the blue jay was credited with making the earth \"when all de worl' was water\" by bringing the first \"grit\" or \"dirt\". In other tales the blue jay was temporarily conscripted as a servant of the Devil to bring \"kindling\" to the \"bad place\": and \"was not encountered on a Friday as he was fetching sticks down to Hell; furthermore, he was so happy and chirpy on a Saturday as he was relieved to return from Hell\". <ref name=ingersoll23>{{cite book |last=Ingersoll |first=Ernest |authorlink=Ernest Ingersoll |title=Birds in legend, fable and folklore |publisher=Longmans, Green and Co. |location=New York |date=1923 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/birdsinlegendfab00inge/page/166 166]\u2013167 |url=https://archive.org/details/birdsinlegendfab00inge |accessdate=2009-08-08}}</ref>\n\nThe blue jay was adopted as the team symbol of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] [[Major League Baseball]] team, as well as some of their [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] affiliates. Their [[mascot]], [[Toronto Blue Jays mascots|Ace]], is an anthropomorphic blue jay. The blue jay is also the official mascot for [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[Elmhurst College]], and [[Creighton University]]. The latter two spell the name as one word - Bluejay. It is also the [[List of Canadian provincial and territorial symbols|provincial bird]] of the province of [[Prince Edward Island]] in Canada.\n\nIn the 1966 Western film ''[[The Shooting]]'', the blue jay is cited as a sign of good luck.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em|refs=\n<ref name=CLO>[http://www.birds.cornell.edu/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Blue_Jay_dtl.html Blue Jay, Life History, All About Birds - Cornell Lab of Ornithology<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n<ref name=Frysinger>{{cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Cyanocitta_cristata.html|title=ADW: Cyanocitta cristata: INFORMATION|work=Animal Diversity Web}}</ref><!-- there is some more information here e.g. on predators and status -->\n\n<ref name=George2003>George, Philip Brandt.

It links the principal urban areas with the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] and the [[AsiaWorld\u2013Expo]] exhibition and convention centre.\n\nIt is not primarily a [[rapid transit|rapid transit or metro]] line but a premium-fare express service for the airport and exhibition centre. It uses specially designed [[rolling stock]] intended to provide levels of comfort similar to that found on an [[airliner]].  The average maximum speed between stations is {{convert|200|km/h|mph}}.\n\nIt is the only rail link to the airport's terminal.  It runs parallel to the [[Tung Chung line]], a traditional rapid transit line, from [[Hong Kong station]] to just south of the channel between [[Lantau Island]] and [[Chek Lap Kok]] Island, on which the airport was constructed.  The line continues to the airport and terminates at AsiaWorld\u2013Expo.  The Tung Chung Line terminates in the adjacent [[Tung Chung]] new town, with bus service to various areas at the airport, including the passenger terminals.\n\nThe journey from [[Hong Kong station]] to the airport takes 24 minutes.  The line is coloured [[teal]] on MTR system maps.\n\n==History==\nIn October 1989, the [[Government of Hong Kong|Hong Kong government]] decided to replace the over-crowded [[Kai Tak Airport]], located in [[Kowloon]], with a new airport to be constructed at Chek Lap Kok. The government also invited the Mass Transit Railway Corporation to build an express line to the airport. The project began when the Chinese and British governments settled the financial and land agreements in November 1994.\n\nThe Lantau Airport Railway was developed as two separate MTR lines, the Tung Chung&nbsp;Line and the Airport Express, with the two lines sharing tracks in some sections. It cost HK$35.1 billion.<ref name=davis>{{cite news|last1=Davis|first1=Chris|title=Rail \"rocket\" set to whisk passengers in comfort|work=South China Morning Post|date=18 December 1997|page=26}}</ref> The Airport Express began service on 6 July 1998, the opening date of the new Hong Kong International Airport. The line initially terminated at [[Airport Station (MTR)|Airport Station]] and the entire journey time was 23 minutes.<ref name=davis/>\n\nWith the opening of [[Sunny Bay (MTR)|Sunny Bay Station]] on the Tung Chung Line in June 2005, the total journey time between the Airport and Hong Kong stations was increased to 24 minutes. With the opening of AsiaWorld\u2013Expo, the line was extended to [[AsiaWorld\u2013Expo Station]] on 20 December 2005 and a journey on the entire route takes 28 minutes.\n\n==Route==\n{| border=0 style=\"margin:auto\"\n|[[Image:MTR_Airport_Express_Geograpical_Map.png|center|thumb|900px|Route map showing both Airport Express and Tung Chung Line]]\n|}\nThe Airport Express line runs from [[Hong Kong station]] in the [[Central and Western District]], crosses under the harbour to [[West Kowloon]] and stops at [[Kowloon Station (MTR)|Kowloon Station]]. The line then runs along the western side of the Kowloon peninsula, crosses over the [[Tsing Lai Bridge]] to [[Tsing Yi Island]], and stops at [[Tsing Yi Station]]. The line continues on the [[Lantau Link]] and runs parallel to the North Lantau Highway to Airport Station before terminating at AsiaWorld\u2013Expo Station.\n\nThe line shares tracks with the Tung Chung Line only in the cross-harbour tunnel and from the Lantau Link through the split before reaching the airport island. The two lines have their own tracks and platforms at all stations.\n\n==Features==\n[[File:Airport check-in at Hong Kong Station.jpg|thumbnail|In-Town Check-In counters at Hong Kong station]]\n[[File:SN6418 at HK West Kowloon Station (20181004155129).jpg|thumbnail|Airport Express Shuttle Bus]]\nThe Airport Express offers more spacious and comfortable trains and stations than other MTR services.<ref name=jrtr/> On the trains, there are luggage racks next to each door, and each seat is equipped with in-seat loudspeakers for current news, advertisements and announcements shown on LCD televisions in front.\n\n===In-town check-in===\nThe Airport Express provides In-Town Check-In at the Hong Kong and Kowloon stations, where passengers on flights with selected airlines can receive [[boarding pass]]es and check luggage, and travel to the airport bags-free.

It links the principal urban areas with the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] and the [[AsiaWorld\u2013Expo]] exhibition and convention centre.\n\nIt is not primarily a [[rapid transit|rapid transit or metro]] line but a premium-fare express service for the airport and exhibition centre. It uses specially designed [[rolling stock]] intended to provide levels of comfort similar to that found on an [[airliner]].  The average maximum speed between stations is {{convert|200|km/h|mph}}.\n\nIt is the only rail link to the airport's terminal.  It runs parallel to the [[Tung Chung Line]], a traditional rapid transit line, from [[Hong Kong Station]] to just south of the channel between [[Lantau Island]] and [[Chek Lap Kok]] Island, on which the airport was constructed.  The line continues to the airport and terminates at AsiaWorld\u2013Expo.  The Tung Chung Line terminates in the adjacent [[Tung Chung]] new town, with bus service to various areas at the airport, including the passenger terminals.\n\nThe journey from [[Hong Kong station]] to the airport takes 24 minutes.  The line is coloured [[teal]] on MTR system maps.\n\n==History==\nIn October 1989, the [[Government of Hong Kong|Hong Kong government]] decided to replace the over-crowded [[Kai Tak Airport]], located in [[Kowloon]], with a new airport to be constructed at Chek Lap Kok. The government also invited the Mass Transit Railway Corporation to build an express line to the airport. The project began when the Chinese and British governments settled the financial and land agreements in November 1994.\n\nThe Lantau Airport Railway was developed as two separate MTR lines, the Tung Chung&nbsp;Line and the Airport Express, with the two lines sharing tracks in some sections. It cost HK$35.1 billion.<ref name=davis>{{cite news|last1=Davis|first1=Chris|title=Rail \"rocket\" set to whisk passengers in comfort|work=South China Morning Post|date=18 December 1997|page=26}}</ref> The Airport Express began service on 6 July 1998, the opening date of the new Hong Kong International Airport. The line initially terminated at [[Airport Station (MTR)|Airport Station]] and the entire journey time was 23 minutes.<ref name=davis/>\n\nWith the opening of [[Sunny Bay (MTR)|Sunny Bay Station]] on the Tung Chung Line in June 2005, the total journey time between the Airport and Hong Kong Stations was increased to 24 minutes. With the opening of AsiaWorld\u2013Expo, the line was extended to [[AsiaWorld\u2013Expo Station]] on 20 December 2005 and a journey on the entire route takes 28 minutes.\n\n==Route==\n{| border=0 style=\"margin:auto\"\n|[[Image:MTR_Airport_Express_Geograpical_Map.png|center|thumb|900px|Route map showing both Airport Express and Tung Chung Line]]\n|}\nThe Airport Express line runs from [[Hong Kong Station]] in the [[Central and Western District]], crosses under the harbour to [[West Kowloon]] and stops at [[Kowloon Station (MTR)|Kowloon Station]]. The line then runs along the western side of the Kowloon peninsula, crosses over the [[Tsing Lai Bridge]] to [[Tsing Yi Island]], and stops at [[Tsing Yi Station]]. The line continues on the [[Lantau Link]] and runs parallel to the North Lantau Highway to Airport Station before terminating at AsiaWorld\u2013Expo Station.\n\nThe line shares tracks with the Tung Chung Line only in the cross-harbour tunnel and from the Lantau Link through the split before reaching the airport island.

[[German Empire|Germany]] and [[British Empire|Britain]] controlled the eastern half of New Guinea.]]\n\nThe country's dual name results from its complex administrative history before independence. \nIn the nineteenth century, Germany ruled the northern half of the country for some decades, beginning in 1884, as a colony named [[German New Guinea]]. In 1914 after the outbreak of [[World War I]], Australian forces landed and [[Australian occupation of German New Guinea|captured German New Guinea in a small military campaign]] and occupied it throughout the war. After the war, in which Germany and the Central Powers were defeated, the [[League of Nations]] authorised Australia to administer this area as a [[League of Nations mandate]] territory.\n\nThe southern half of the country had been colonised in 1884 by the United Kingdom as [[Territory of Papua|British New Guinea]]. With the [[Papua Act 1905]], the UK transferred this territory to the newly formed [[Australia|Commonwealth of Australia]], which took on its administration. Additionally, from 1905, British New Guinea was renamed as the [[Territory of Papua]]. In contrast to establishing an Australian mandate in former German New Guinea, the League of Nations determined that Papua was an External Territory of the Australian Commonwealth; as a matter of law it remained a British possession. The difference in legal status meant that until 1949, Papua and New Guinea had entirely separate administrations, both controlled by Australia. These conditions contributed to the complexity of organising the country's post-independence legal system.\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Buna (AWM 014008).jpg|thumb|left|Australian forces attack Japanese positions during the [[Battle of Buna\u2013Gona]], 7 January 1943.]]\nDuring [[World War II]], the [[New Guinea campaign]] (1942\u20131945) was one of the major military campaigns and conflicts between Japan and the Allies.

The nation established independence from [[Australia]] on 16 September 1975, becoming a [[Commonwealth realm]], continuing to share [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] as its head of state. It maintains close ties with Australia, which continues to be its largest aid donor.

A renewed [[Bougainville Civil War|uprising]] on Bougainville started in 1988 and claimed 20,000 lives until it was resolved in 1997. Bougainville had been the primary mining region of the country, generating 40% of the national budget. The native peoples felt they were bearing the adverse environmental effects of the mining, which poisoned the land, water and air, without gaining a fair share of the profits.<ref>\"[http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/radio/onairhighlights/428966 New report doubles death toll on Bougainville to 20,000]\".

As part of the current peace settlement, a non-binding [[2019 Bougainvillean independence referendum|independence referendum]] was held, between 23 November and 7 December 2019.

The constitutional convention, which prepared the draft constitution, and Australia, the outgoing metropolitan power, had thought that Papua New Guinea would not remain a monarchy. The founders, however, considered that imperial honours had a cachet.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bradford |first=Sarah |title=Elizabeth: A Biography of Britain's Queen |year=1997 |publisher=Riverhead Books |isbn=978-1-57322-600-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/elizabethbiograp00brad_0 }}</ref> The monarch is represented by the [[Governor-General of Papua New Guinea]], currently [[Bob Dadae]]. Papua New Guinea (and the [[Solomon Islands]]) are unusual among Commonwealth realms in that governors-general are elected by the legislature, rather than chosen by the executive branch.\n\nThe [[Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea|Prime Minister]] heads the [[Cabinet of Papua New Guinea|cabinet]], which consists of 31 MPs from the ruling coalition, which make up the government. The current prime minister is [[James Marape]]. The [[unicameralism|unicameral]] [[National Parliament of Papua New Guinea|National Parliament]] has 111 seats, of which 22 are occupied by the governors of the 22 provinces and the [[National Capital District (Papua New Guinea)|National Capital District]] (NCD). Candidates for members of parliament are voted upon when the prime minister asks the governor-general to call a national election, a maximum of five years after the previous national election.\n\nIn the early years of independence, the instability of the party system led to frequent [[motion of no confidence|votes of no confidence]] in parliament, with resulting changes of the government, but with referral to the electorate, through national elections only occurring every five years. In recent years, successive governments have passed legislation preventing such votes sooner than 18 months after a national election and within 12 months of the next election. In December 2012, the first two (of three) readings were passed to prevent votes of no confidence occurring within the first 30 months. This restriction on votes of no confidence has arguably resulted in greater stability, although perhaps at a cost of reducing the accountability of the executive branch of government.\n\nElections in PNG attract numerous candidates. After independence in 1975, members were elected by the [[first past the post|first-past-the-post]] system, with winners frequently gaining less than 15% of the vote. Electoral reforms in 2001 introduced the Limited Preferential Vote system (LPV), a version of the [[instant-runoff voting|Alternative Vote]]. The [[2007 Papua New Guinean general election|2007 general election]] was the first to be conducted using LPV.\n\n[[File:James Marape, in 2012.png|thumb|upright|Prime Minister [[James Marape]].]]\n\n{{update|section|date=October 2012}}\nIn 2011 there was a [[2011\u201312 Papua New Guinean constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis]] between the parliament-elect Prime Minister, Peter O'Neill (voted into office by a large majority of MPs), and [[Michael Somare|Sir Michael Somare]], who was deemed by the supreme court (in a December Opinion, 3:2) to retain office. The stand-off between parliament and the supreme court continued until the July 2012 national elections, with legislation passed effectively removing the chief justice and subjecting the supreme court members to greater control by the legislature, as well as a series of other laws passed, for example limiting the age for a prime minister. The confrontation reached a peak, with the Deputy Prime Minister entering the supreme court during a hearing, escorted by some police, ostensibly to arrest the Chief Justice. There was strong pressure among some MPs to defer the national elections for a further six months to one year, although their powers to do that were highly questionable.\n\nThe parliament-elect prime minister and other cooler-headed MPs carried the votes for the writs for the new election to be issued, slightly late, but for the election itself to occur on time, thereby avoiding a continuation of the constitutional crisis. The crisis was tense at times, but largely restricted to the political and legal fraternity, plus some police factions. The public and public service (including most police and military) stood back. It was a period when, with increased telecommunication access and use of social media (notably Facebook and mobile phones), the public and students played some part in helping maintain restraint and demanding the leadership to adhere to constitutional processes. They insisted on having the elections so that the people could say who should be their legitimate representatives for the next five years.\n\nUnder a 2002 amendment, the leader of the party winning the largest number of seats in the election is invited by the governor-general to form the government, if he can muster the necessary majority in parliament. The process of forming such a coalition in PNG, where parties do not have much ideology, involves considerable horsetrading right up until the last moment. Peter O'Neill emerged as Papua New Guinea's prime minister after the July 2012 election, and formed a government with [[Leo Dion]], the former Governor of East New Britain Province, as deputy prime minister.\n\n=== Law ===\n[[File:Port Moresby parliament building front, by Steve Shattuck.jpg|thumb|upright|The Parliament building of Papua New Guinea in [[Port Moresby]]]]\n{{Main|Law of Papua New Guinea}}\nThe unicameral Parliament enacts legislation in the same manner as in other Commonwealth realms that use the Westminster system of government. The cabinet collectively agree government policy, then the relevant minister introduces bills to Parliament, depending on which government department is responsible for implementation of a particular law. Back bench members of parliament can also introduce bills. Parliament debates bills, and if approved the bill is forwarded to the Governor-General for Royal assent, following which it becomes law.\n\nAll ordinary statutes enacted by Parliament must be consistent with the Constitution. The courts have jurisdiction to rule on the constitutionality of statutes, both in disputes before them and on a reference where there is no dispute but only an abstract question of law. Unusually among developing countries, the judicial branch of government in Papua New Guinea has remained remarkably independent, and successive executive governments have continued to respect its authority.\n\nThe \"underlying law\" (Papua New Guinea's [[common law]]) consists of principles and rules of common law and equity in English<ref>Papua New Guinea Constitution Schedule 2.2.2</ref> common law as it stood on 16 September 1975 (the date of independence), and thereafter the decisions of PNG's own courts. The courts are directed by the Constitution and, latterly, the ''Underlying Law Act'', to take note of the \"custom\" of traditional communities. They are to determine which customs are common to the whole country and may be declared also to be part of the underlying law. In practice, this has proved extremely difficult and has been largely neglected. Statutes are largely adapted from overseas jurisdictions, primarily Australia and England. Advocacy in the courts follows the adversarial pattern of other common-law countries.\n\nThis national court system, used in towns and cities, is supported by a village court system in the more remote areas. The law underpinning the village courts is 'customary law'.\n\n=== Foreign policy ===\n[[File:APEC Leaders Photo - Papua New Guinea 2018.jpg|thumb|APEC 2018 in Papua New Guinea]]\nIn foreign policy, Papua New Guinea is a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[Pacific Community]] (SPC), Pacific Islands Forum, and the Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) of countries. It was accorded Observer status within [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] in 1976, followed later by Special Observer status in 1981.

It consists of three wings. The Land Element, a land force consisting of the [[Royal Pacific Islands Regiment]], a small special forces unit, a battalion of engineers, and three other small units primarily dealing with signals and health, as well as a military academy, is concerned with defence of the nation on land. The Air Element is a small, underfunded aircraft squadron consisting of two utility aircraft, with another three on order, two leased helicopters, and two trainers once they are delivered. Its present purpose is transportation for the other military wings. The Maritime Element is a small navy consisting of four [[Pacific-class]] patrol boats, three ex-Australian [[Balikpapan-class landing craft]], and one [[Guardian-class patrol boat]]. One of the landing craft is used as a training ship. Three more Guardian-class patrol boats are under construction in Australia, to replace the old Pacific-class vessels. The main tasks of the Maritime Element are patrol of inshore waters and transport of the Land Element. Papua New Guinea has such a large [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] that patrols by the small Pacific-class patrol boats, which are often unserviceable due to underfunding, are ineffective, so the Maritime Element is heavily reliant on satellite imagery for surveillance of its waters. This problem will be partially corrected when all of the larger Guardian-class patrol boats enter service.\n\n=== Human rights ===\n[[File:Papua New Guinean children, men and women show their support for putting an end to violence against women during a White Ribbon Day march (21614943268).jpg|thumb|left|Papua New Guinean children, men and women show their support for putting an end to violence against women during a [[White Ribbon Campaign|White Ribbon Day]] march]]\n{{Main|Human rights in Papua New Guinea}}\n{{See also|Sexual violence in Papua New Guinea}}\n\nPapua New Guinea is often ranked as likely the worst place in the world for [[violence against women]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/05/papua-new-guinea-abuse-clinic|author=Davidson, Helen|date=5 July 2013|title=M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res opens Papua New Guinea clinic for abuse victims|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=12 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/19/papua-new-guinea-spiralling-violence|author=Davidson, Helen|date=19 July 2013|title=Papua New Guinea: a country suffering spiralling violence|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=17 January 2014}}</ref> A 2013 study in ''[[The Lancet]]'' found that 27% of men on Bougainville Island, Papua New Guinea, reported having raped a non-partner, while 14.1% reported having committed [[gang rape]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Jewkes |first=Rachel |first2=Emma|last2=Fulu|first3=Tim|last3=Roselli|first4=Claudia|last4=Garcia-Moreno |title=Prevalence of and factors associated with non-partner rape perpetration: findings from the UN Multi-country Cross-sectional Study on Men and Violence in Asia and the Pacific |journal=[[The Lancet]] |date= 2013 |doi=10.1016/S2214-109X(13)70069-X |volume=323 |issue=4 |pages=e208-18 |pmid=25104346|doi-access=free }}</ref> According to [[UNICEF]], nearly half of reported rape victims are under 15 years of age and 13% are under 7 years of age.<ref name=\"UNICEF2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/papuang_45211.html|title=UNICEF strives to help Papua New Guinea break cycle of violence|publisher=[[UNICEF]]|accessdate=26 February 2014|date=18 August 2008}}</ref> A report by [[ChildFund]] Australia, citing former Parliamentarian Dame [[Carol Kidu]], claimed 50% of those seeking medical help after rape are under 16, 25% are under 12, and 10% are under 8.<ref>{{cite web |author=Wiseman H |title=Stop Violence Against Women and Children in Papua New Guinea |url=https://www.childfund.org.au/sites/default/files/publications/Stop%20Violence%20Against%20Women%20and%20Children%20in%20PNG%202013.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150827092248/https://www.childfund.org.au/sites/default/files/publications/Stop%20Violence%20Against%20Women%20and%20Children%20in%20PNG%202013.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 August 2015 |website=ChildFund |date=August 2013 |accessdate=18 May 2015 |page=5 }}</ref>\n\nThe 1971 Sorcery Act imposed a penalty of up to 2 years in prison for the practice of [[black magic|\"black\" magic]], until the Act was repealed in 2013.<ref>\"[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-22698668 PNG repeals sorcery law and expands death penalty]\".

Dense [[rainforest]]s can be found in the lowland and coastal areas as well as very large [[wetland]] areas surrounding the [[Sepik]] and [[Fly River|Fly]] rivers. This terrain has made it difficult for the country to develop transportation infrastructure.

Papua New Guinea is surrounded by [[coral reef]]s which are under close watch, in the interests of preservation.\n\nThe country is situated on the Pacific [[Ring of Fire]], at the point of collision of several [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]]. There are a number of active [[volcano]]es, and eruptions are frequent.

It is connected to the Australian segment by a shallow [[continental shelf]] across the [[Torres Strait]], which in former ages lay exposed as a [[land bridge]], particularly during [[ice age]]s when sea levels were lower than at present.\n\nConsequently, many species of birds and mammals found on New Guinea have close genetic links with corresponding species found in Australia. One notable feature in common for the two landmasses is the existence of several species of [[marsupial]] [[mammal]]s, including some [[kangaroo]]s and [[Phalangeriformes|possums]], which are not found elsewhere. Papua New Guinea is a [[Megadiverse countries|megadiverse country]].\n\nMany of the other islands within PNG territory, including New Britain, New Ireland, Bougainville, the [[Admiralty Islands]], the [[Trobriand Islands]], and the [[Louisiade Archipelago]], were never linked to New Guinea by land bridges. As a consequence, they have their own flora and fauna; in particular, they lack many of the land mammals and flightless birds that are common to New Guinea and Australia.\n\n[[File:Baby tree kangaroo on the chiefs wifes shoulder -Papua New Guinea-17Oct2008.jpg|thumb|A [[tree-kangaroo]] in Papua New Guinea]]\nAustralia and New Guinea are portions of the ancient supercontinent of [[Gondwana]], which started to break into smaller continents in the [[Cretaceous]] period, 65\u2013130 million years ago. Australia finally broke free from [[Antarctica]] about 45 million years ago. All the Australasian lands are home to the [[Antarctic flora]], descended from the flora of southern Gondwana, including the [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] [[podocarpaceae|podocarps]] and ''[[Araucaria]]'' pines, and the broad-leafed southern beech (''[[Nothofagus]]''). These plant families are still present in Papua New Guinea.\n\nAs the Indo-Australian Plate (which includes landmasses of [[India]], Australia, and the Indian Ocean floor in between) drifts north, it collides with the [[Eurasian Plate]]. The collision of the two plates pushed up the [[Himalayas]], the Indonesian islands, and New Guinea's Central Range. The Central Range is much younger and higher than the mountains of Australia, so high that it is home to rare equatorial [[glacier]]s. New Guinea is part of the humid tropics, and many [[Indomalayan realm|Indomalayan]] rainforest plants spread across the narrow straits from Asia, mixing together with the old Australian and Antarctic floras.\n\nPNG includes a number of terrestrial [[ecoregion]]s:\n\n*[[Admiralty Islands]] lowland rain forests \u2013 forested islands to the north of the mainland, home to a distinct flora.\n*[[New Guinea Highlands|Central Range montane rain forests]] [[File:PNG-climate.png|thumb|Green [[tropical rainforest]] of Papua New Guinea bears a sharp contrast to nearby [[arid]] Australia.]]\n*[[Huon Peninsula]] montane rain forests\n*[[Louisiade Archipelago]] rain forests\n*New Britain-New Ireland lowland rain forests\n*New Britain-New Ireland montane rain forests\n*[[New Guinea mangroves]]\n*[[Northern New Guinea lowland rain and freshwater swamp forests]]\n*Northern New Guinea montane rain forests\n*[[Solomon Islands rain forests]] (includes Bougainville Island and Buka)\n*Southeastern Papuan rain forests\n*Southern New Guinea freshwater swamp forests\n*Southern New Guinea lowland rain forests\n*[[Trobriand Islands rain forests]]\n*[[Trans-Fly savanna and grasslands]]\n*Central Range sub-alpine grasslands\n\nThree new species of mammals were discovered in the forests of Papua New Guinea by an Australian-led expedition.

The rugged terrain\u2014including high mountain ranges and valleys, swamps and islands\u2014and high cost of developing infrastructure, combined with other factors (including serious law and order problems in some centres and the system of customary land title) makes it difficult for outside developers. Local developers are handicapped by years of deficient investment in education, health, ICT and access to finance. Agriculture, for subsistence and cash crops, provides a livelihood for 85% of the population and continues to provide some 30% of GDP. Mineral deposits, including gold, [[Petroleum|oil]], and copper, account for 72% of export earnings. [[Elaeis guineensis|Oil palm]] production has grown steadily over recent years (largely from estates and with extensive outgrower output), with [[palm oil]] now the main agricultural export. In households participating, coffee remains the major export crop (produced largely in the Highlands provinces); followed by [[cocoa bean|cocoa]] and [[coconut oil]]/[[copra]] from the coastal areas, each largely produced by smallholders; tea, produced on estates; and rubber.

There is virtually no freehold title; the few existing freeholds are automatically converted to state lease when they are transferred between vendor and purchaser. Unalienated land is owned under customary title by traditional landowners. The precise nature of the [[seisin]] varies from one culture to another. Many writers portray land as in the communal ownership of traditional clans; however, closer studies usually show that the smallest portions of land whose ownership cannot be further divided are held by the individual heads of extended families and their descendants or their descendants alone if they have recently died.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nThis is a matter of vital importance because a problem of economic development is identifying the membership of customary landowning groups and the owners. Disputes between mining and forestry companies and landowner groups often devolve on the issue of whether the companies entered into contractual relations for the use of land with the true owners. Customary property\u2014usually land\u2014cannot be devised by will. It can only be inherited according to the custom of the deceased's people.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The Lands Act was amended in 2010 along with the Land Group Incorporation Act, intended to improve the management of state land, mechanisms for dispute resolution over land, and to enable customary landowners to be better able to access finance and possible partnerships over portions of their land, if they seek to develop it for urban or rural economic activities. The Land Group Incorporation Act requires more specific identification of the customary landowners than hitherto and their more specific authorisation before any land arrangements are determined; (a major issue in recent years has been a land grab, using, or rather misusing, the Lease-Leaseback provision under the Land Act, notably using 'Special Agricultural and Business Leases' (SABLs) to acquire vast tracts of customary land, purportedly for agricultural projects, but in an almost all cases as a back-door mechanism for securing tropical forest resources for logging\u2014circumventing the more exacting requirements of the Forest Act, for securing Timber Permits (which must comply with sustainability requirements and be competitively secured, and with the customary landowners approval).

At its gathering in November 2014, the Council re-emphasised the need to focus on sustainable development through [[Science and technology in Pacific Island countries|science and technology]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=Paris|pages=693\u2013731}}</ref>\n\n''Vision 2050''<nowiki/>'s medium-term priorities are:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* emerging industrial technology for downstream processing;\n* infrastructure technology for the economic corridors;\n* knowledge-based technology;\n* science and engineering education; and\n* to reach the target of investing 5% of GDP in research and development by 2050. (There is no recent data for this indicator.)\nAccording to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science, Papua New Guinea had the largest number of publications (110) among Pacific Island states in 2014, followed by Fiji (106). Nine out of ten scientific publications from Papua New Guinea focused on immunology, genetics, biotechnology and microbiology. Nine out of ten were also co-authored by scientists from other countries, mainly Australia, the United States of America, United Kingdom, Spain and Switzerland.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nForestry is an important economic resource for Papua New Guinea but the industry uses low and semi-intensive technological inputs. As a result, product ranges are limited to sawed timber, veneer, plywood, block board, moulding, poles and posts and wood chips. Only a few limited finished products are exported. Lack of automated machinery, coupled with inadequately trained local technical personnel, are some of the obstacles to introducing automated machinery and design. Policy-makers need to turn their attention to eliminating these barriers, in order for forestry to make a more efficient and sustainable contribution to national economic development.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n{{anchor|Renewable energy}}In Papua New Guinea, renewable energy sources represent two-thirds of the total electricity supply.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 2015, the Secretariat of the [[Pacific Community]] observed that, 'while Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and Samoa are leading the way with large-scale hydropower projects, there is enormous potential to expand the deployment of other renewable energy options such as solar, wind, geothermal and ocean-based energy sources'.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.spc.int/edd/fr/section-01/energy-overview/energy?start=12|title=Pacific-first centre of excellence for renewable energy and energy efficiency takes shape|date=18 June 2015|work=Secretariat of Pacific Community press release|access-date=17 March 2017}}</ref> The European Union has funded the Renewable Energy in Pacific Island Countries Developing Skills and Capacity programme (EPIC).

The programme resulted from the signing of an agreement in February 2014 between the European Union and the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat. The other beneficiaries are the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Transport ==\n{{Main|Transport in Papua New Guinea}}\n\nTransport in Papua New Guinea is heavily limited by the country's mountainous terrain. As a result, air travel is the single most important form of transport for human and high density/value freight. Airplanes made it possible to open up the country during its early colonial period. Even today the two largest cities, [[Port Moresby]] and [[Lae]], are only directly connected by planes. Port Moresby is not linked by road to any of the other major towns, and many remote villages can only be reached by light aircraft or on foot.\n\n[[Jacksons International Airport]] is the major international airport in Papua New Guinea, located {{convert|5|mi|km|0|order=flip}} from Port Moresby. In addition to two international airfields, Papua New Guinea has 578 airstrips, most of which are unpaved.<ref name=\"cia\">{{cite web |title=Papua New Guinea |work=The World Factbook |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |location=Langley, Virginia |year=2012 |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pp.html |accessdate=5 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Outline of Papua New Guinea]]{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Refbegin}}\n{{Free-content attribution\n\n | title = UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030\n| author = UNESCO\n| publisher = UNESCO Publishing\n| page numbers = 535\u2013555\n| source = \n| documentURL = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf\n| licence statement URL = \n| licence = CC-BY-SA IGO 3.0\n}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Biskup, Peter, B.

[[German Empire|Germany]] and [[British Empire|Britain]] controlled the eastern half of New Guinea.]]\n\nThe country's dual name results from its complex administrative history before independence. \nIn the nineteenth century, Germany ruled the northern half of the country for some decades, beginning in 1884, as a colony named [[German New Guinea]]. In 1914 after the outbreak of [[World War I]], Australian forces landed and [[Australian occupation of German New Guinea|captured German New Guinea in a small military campaign]] and occupied it throughout the war. After the war, in which Germany and the Central Powers were defeated, the [[League of Nations]] authorised Australia to administer this area as a [[League of Nations mandate]] territory.\n\nThe southern half of the country had been colonised in 1884 by the United Kingdom as [[Territory of Papua|British New Guinea]]. With the [[Papua Act 1905]], the UK transferred this territory to the newly formed [[Australia|Commonwealth of Australia]], which took on its administration. Additionally, from 1905, British New Guinea was renamed as the [[Territory of Papua]]. In contrast to establishing an Australian mandate in former German New Guinea, the League of Nations determined that Papua was an External Territory of the Australian Commonwealth; as a matter of law it remained a British possession. The difference in legal status meant that until 1949, Papua and New Guinea had entirely separate administrations, both controlled by Australia. These conditions contributed to the complexity of organising the country's post-independence legal system.\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Buna (AWM 014008).jpg|thumb|left|Australian forces attack Japanese positions during the [[Battle of Buna\u2013Gona]], 7 January 1943.]]\nDuring [[World War II]], the [[New Guinea campaign]] (1942\u20131945) was one of the major military campaigns and conflicts between Japan and the Allies.

A renewed [[Bougainville Civil War|uprising]] on Bougainville started in 1988 and claimed 20,000 lives until it was resolved in 1997. Bougainville had been the primary mining region of the country, generating 40% of the national budget. The native peoples felt they were bearing the adverse environmental effects of the mining, which poisoned the land, water and air, without gaining a fair share of the profits.<ref>\"[http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/radio/onairhighlights/428966 New report doubles death toll on Bougainville to 20,000]\".

The constitutional convention, which prepared the draft constitution, and Australia, the outgoing metropolitan power, had thought that Papua New Guinea would not remain a monarchy. The founders, however, considered that imperial honours had a cachet.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bradford |first=Sarah |title=Elizabeth: A Biography of Britain's Queen |year=1997 |publisher=Riverhead Books |isbn=978-1-57322-600-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/elizabethbiograp00brad_0 }}</ref> The monarch is represented by the [[Governor-General of Papua New Guinea]], currently [[Bob Dadae]]. Papua New Guinea (and the [[Solomon Islands]]) are unusual among Commonwealth realms in that governors-general are elected by the legislature, rather than chosen by the executive branch.\n\nThe [[Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea|Prime Minister]] heads the [[Cabinet of Papua New Guinea|cabinet]], which consists of 31 MPs from the ruling coalition, which make up the government. The current prime minister is [[James Marape]]. The [[unicameralism|unicameral]] [[National Parliament of Papua New Guinea|National Parliament]] has 111 seats, of which 22 are occupied by the governors of the 22 provinces and the [[National Capital District (Papua New Guinea)|National Capital District]] (NCD). Candidates for members of parliament are voted upon when the prime minister asks the governor-general to call a national election, a maximum of five years after the previous national election.\n\nIn the early years of independence, the instability of the party system led to frequent [[motion of no confidence|votes of no confidence]] in parliament, with resulting changes of the government, but with referral to the electorate, through national elections only occurring every five years. In recent years, successive governments have passed legislation preventing such votes sooner than 18 months after a national election and within 12 months of the next election. In December 2012, the first two (of three) readings were passed to prevent votes of no confidence occurring within the first 30 months. This restriction on votes of no confidence has arguably resulted in greater stability, although perhaps at a cost of reducing the accountability of the executive branch of government.\n\nElections in PNG attract numerous candidates. After independence in 1975, members were elected by the [[first past the post|first-past-the-post]] system, with winners frequently gaining less than 15% of the vote. Electoral reforms in 2001 introduced the Limited Preferential Vote system (LPV), a version of the [[instant-runoff voting|Alternative Vote]]. The [[2007 Papua New Guinean general election|2007 general election]] was the first to be conducted using LPV.\n\n[[File:James Marape, in 2012.png|thumb|upright|Prime Minister [[James Marape]].]]\n\n{{update|section|date=October 2012}}\nIn 2011 there was a [[2011\u201312 Papua New Guinean constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis]] between the parliament-elect Prime Minister, Peter O'Neill (voted into office by a large majority of MPs), and [[Michael Somare|Sir Michael Somare]], who was deemed by the supreme court (in a December Opinion, 3:2) to retain office. The stand-off between parliament and the supreme court continued until the July 2012 national elections, with legislation passed effectively removing the chief justice and subjecting the supreme court members to greater control by the legislature, as well as a series of other laws passed, for example limiting the age for a prime minister. The confrontation reached a peak, with the Deputy Prime Minister entering the supreme court during a hearing, escorted by some police, ostensibly to arrest the Chief Justice. There was strong pressure among some MPs to defer the national elections for a further six months to one year, although their powers to do that were highly questionable.\n\nThe parliament-elect prime minister and other cooler-headed MPs carried the votes for the writs for the new election to be issued, slightly late, but for the election itself to occur on time, thereby avoiding a continuation of the constitutional crisis. The crisis was tense at times, but largely restricted to the political and legal fraternity, plus some police factions. The public and public service (including most police and military) stood back. It was a period when, with increased telecommunication access and use of social media (notably Facebook and mobile phones), the public and students played some part in helping maintain restraint and demanding the leadership to adhere to constitutional processes. They insisted on having the elections so that the people could say who should be their legitimate representatives for the next five years.\n\nUnder a 2002 amendment, the leader of the party winning the largest number of seats in the election is invited by the governor-general to form the government, if he can muster the necessary majority in parliament. The process of forming such a coalition in PNG, where parties do not have much ideology, involves considerable horsetrading right up until the last moment. Peter O'Neill emerged as Papua New Guinea's prime minister after the July 2012 election, and formed a government with [[Leo Dion]], the former Governor of East New Britain Province, as deputy prime minister.\n\n=== Law ===\n[[File:Port Moresby parliament building front, by Steve Shattuck.jpg|thumb|upright|The Parliament building of Papua New Guinea in [[Port Moresby]]]]\n{{Main|Law of Papua New Guinea}}\nThe unicameral Parliament enacts legislation in the same manner as in other Commonwealth realms that use the Westminster system of government. The cabinet collectively agree government policy, then the relevant minister introduces bills to Parliament, depending on which government department is responsible for implementation of a particular law. Back bench members of parliament can also introduce bills. Parliament debates bills, and if approved the bill is forwarded to the Governor-General for Royal assent, following which it becomes law.\n\nAll ordinary statutes enacted by Parliament must be consistent with the Constitution. The courts have jurisdiction to rule on the constitutionality of statutes, both in disputes before them and on a reference where there is no dispute but only an abstract question of law. Unusually among developing countries, the judicial branch of government in Papua New Guinea has remained remarkably independent, and successive executive governments have continued to respect its authority.\n\nThe \"underlying law\" (Papua New Guinea's [[common law]]) consists of principles and rules of common law and equity in English<ref>Papua New Guinea Constitution Schedule 2.2.2</ref> common law as it stood on 16 September 1975 (the date of independence), and thereafter the decisions of PNG's own courts. The courts are directed by the Constitution and, latterly, the ''Underlying Law Act'', to take note of the \"custom\" of traditional communities. They are to determine which customs are common to the whole country and may be declared also to be part of the underlying law. In practice, this has proved extremely difficult and has been largely neglected. Statutes are largely adapted from overseas jurisdictions, primarily Australia and England. Advocacy in the courts follows the adversarial pattern of other common-law countries.\n\nThis national court system, used in towns and cities, is supported by a village court system in the more remote areas. The law underpinning the village courts is 'customary law'.\n\n=== Foreign policy ===\n[[File:APEC Leaders Photo - Papua New Guinea 2018.jpg|thumb|APEC 2018 in Papua New Guinea]]\nIn foreign policy, Papua New Guinea is a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[Pacific Community]] (SPC), Pacific Islands Forum, and the Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) of countries. It was accorded Observer status within [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] in 1976, followed later by Special Observer status in 1981.

It consists of three wings. The Land Element, a land force consisting of the [[Royal Pacific Islands Regiment]], a small special forces unit, a battalion of engineers, and three other small units primarily dealing with signals and health, as well as a military academy, is concerned with defence of the nation on land. The Air Element is a small, underfunded aircraft squadron consisting of two utility aircraft, with another three on order, two leased helicopters, and two trainers once they are delivered. Its present purpose is transportation for the other military wings. The Maritime Element is a small navy consisting of four [[Pacific-class]] patrol boats, three ex-Australian [[Balikpapan-class landing craft]], and one [[Guardian-class patrol boat]]. One of the landing craft is used as a training ship. Three more Guardian-class patrol boats are under construction in Australia, to replace the old Pacific-class vessels. The main tasks of the Maritime Element are patrol of inshore waters and transport of the Land Element. Papua New Guinea has such a large [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] that patrols by the small Pacific-class patrol boats, which are often unserviceable due to underfunding, are ineffective, so the Maritime Element is heavily reliant on satellite imagery for surveillance of its waters. This problem will be partially corrected when all of the larger Guardian-class patrol boats enter service.\n\n=== Human rights ===\n[[File:Papua New Guinean children, men and women show their support for putting an end to violence against women during a White Ribbon Day march (21614943268).jpg|thumb|left|Papua New Guinean children, men and women show their support for putting an end to violence against women during a [[White Ribbon Campaign|White Ribbon Day]] march]]\n{{Main|Human rights in Papua New Guinea}}\n{{See also|Sexual violence in Papua New Guinea}}\n\nPapua New Guinea is often ranked as likely the worst place in the world for [[violence against women]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/05/papua-new-guinea-abuse-clinic|author=Davidson, Helen|date=5 July 2013|title=M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res opens Papua New Guinea clinic for abuse victims|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=12 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/19/papua-new-guinea-spiralling-violence|author=Davidson, Helen|date=19 July 2013|title=Papua New Guinea: a country suffering spiralling violence|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=17 January 2014}}</ref> A 2013 study in ''[[The Lancet]]'' found that 27% of men on Bougainville Island, Papua New Guinea, reported having raped a non-partner, while 14.1% reported having committed [[gang rape]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Jewkes |first=Rachel |first2=Emma|last2=Fulu|first3=Tim|last3=Roselli|first4=Claudia|last4=Garcia-Moreno |title=Prevalence of and factors associated with non-partner rape perpetration: findings from the UN Multi-country Cross-sectional Study on Men and Violence in Asia and the Pacific |journal=[[The Lancet]] |date= 2013 |doi=10.1016/S2214-109X(13)70069-X |volume=323 |issue=4 |pages=e208-18 |pmid=25104346|doi-access=free }}</ref> According to [[UNICEF]], nearly half of reported rape victims are under 15 years of age and 13% are under 7 years of age.<ref name=\"UNICEF2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/papuang_45211.html|title=UNICEF strives to help Papua New Guinea break cycle of violence|publisher=[[UNICEF]]|accessdate=26 February 2014|date=18 August 2008}}</ref> A report by [[ChildFund]] Australia, citing former Parliamentarian Dame [[Carol Kidu]], claimed 50% of those seeking medical help after rape are under 16, 25% are under 12, and 10% are under 8.<ref>{{cite web |author=Wiseman H |title=Stop Violence Against Women and Children in Papua New Guinea |url=https://www.childfund.org.au/sites/default/files/publications/Stop%20Violence%20Against%20Women%20and%20Children%20in%20PNG%202013.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150827092248/https://www.childfund.org.au/sites/default/files/publications/Stop%20Violence%20Against%20Women%20and%20Children%20in%20PNG%202013.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 August 2015 |website=ChildFund |date=August 2013 |accessdate=18 May 2015 |page=5 }}</ref>\n\nThe 1971 Sorcery Act imposed a penalty of up to 2 years in prison for the practice of [[black magic|\"black\" magic]], until the Act was repealed in 2013.<ref>\"[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-22698668 PNG repeals sorcery law and expands death penalty]\".

Dense [[rainforest]]s can be found in the lowland and coastal areas as well as very large [[wetland]] areas surrounding the [[Sepik]] and [[Fly River|Fly]] rivers. This terrain has made it difficult for the country to develop transportation infrastructure. Some areas are accessible only on foot or by aeroplane.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} The highest peak is [[Mount Wilhelm]] at {{convert|4509|m}}. Papua New Guinea is surrounded by [[coral reef]]s which are under close watch, in the interests of preservation.\n\nThe country is situated on the Pacific [[Ring of Fire]], at the point of collision of several [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]].

It is connected to the Australian segment by a shallow [[continental shelf]] across the [[Torres Strait]], which in former ages lay exposed as a [[land bridge]], particularly during [[ice age]]s when sea levels were lower than at present.\n\nConsequently, many species of birds and mammals found on New Guinea have close genetic links with corresponding species found in Australia. One notable feature in common for the two landmasses is the existence of several species of [[marsupial]] [[mammal]]s, including some [[kangaroo]]s and [[Phalangeriformes|possums]], which are not found elsewhere. Papua New Guinea is a [[Megadiverse countries|megadiverse country]].\n\nMany of the other islands within PNG territory, including New Britain, New Ireland, Bougainville, the [[Admiralty Islands]], the [[Trobriand Islands]], and the [[Louisiade Archipelago]], were never linked to New Guinea by land bridges. As a consequence, they have their own flora and fauna; in particular, they lack many of the land mammals and flightless birds that are common to New Guinea and Australia.\n\n[[File:Baby tree kangaroo on the chiefs wifes shoulder -Papua New Guinea-17Oct2008.jpg|thumb|A [[tree-kangaroo]] in Papua New Guinea]]\nAustralia and New Guinea are portions of the ancient supercontinent of [[Gondwana]], which started to break into smaller continents in the [[Cretaceous]] period, 65\u2013130 million years ago. Australia finally broke free from [[Antarctica]] about 45 million years ago. All the Australasian lands are home to the [[Antarctic flora]], descended from the flora of southern Gondwana, including the [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] [[podocarpaceae|podocarps]] and ''[[Araucaria]]'' pines, and the broad-leafed southern beech (''[[Nothofagus]]''). These plant families are still present in Papua New Guinea.\n\nAs the Indo-Australian Plate (which includes landmasses of [[India]], Australia, and the Indian Ocean floor in between) drifts north, it collides with the [[Eurasian Plate]]. The collision of the two plates pushed up the [[Himalayas]], the Indonesian islands, and New Guinea's Central Range. The Central Range is much younger and higher than the mountains of Australia, so high that it is home to rare equatorial [[glacier]]s. New Guinea is part of the humid tropics, and many [[Indomalayan realm|Indomalayan]] rainforest plants spread across the narrow straits from Asia, mixing together with the old Australian and Antarctic floras.\n\nPNG includes a number of terrestrial [[ecoregion]]s:\n\n*[[Admiralty Islands]] lowland rain forests \u2013 forested islands to the north of the mainland, home to a distinct flora.\n*[[New Guinea Highlands|Central Range montane rain forests]] [[File:PNG-climate.png|thumb|Green [[tropical rainforest]] of Papua New Guinea bears a sharp contrast to nearby [[arid]] Australia.]]\n*[[Huon Peninsula]] montane rain forests\n*[[Louisiade Archipelago]] rain forests\n*New Britain-New Ireland lowland rain forests\n*New Britain-New Ireland montane rain forests\n*[[New Guinea mangroves]]\n*[[Northern New Guinea lowland rain and freshwater swamp forests]]\n*Northern New Guinea montane rain forests\n*[[Solomon Islands rain forests]] (includes Bougainville Island and Buka)\n*Southeastern Papuan rain forests\n*Southern New Guinea freshwater swamp forests\n*Southern New Guinea lowland rain forests\n*[[Trobriand Islands rain forests]]\n*[[Trans-Fly savanna and grasslands]]\n*Central Range sub-alpine grasslands\n\nThree new species of mammals were discovered in the forests of Papua New Guinea by an Australian-led expedition.

The rugged terrain\u2014including high mountain ranges and valleys, swamps and islands\u2014and high cost of developing infrastructure, combined with other factors (including serious law and order problems in some centres and the system of customary land title) makes it difficult for outside developers. Local developers are handicapped by years of deficient investment in education, health, ICT and access to finance. Agriculture, for subsistence and cash crops, provides a livelihood for 85% of the population and continues to provide some 30% of GDP. Mineral deposits, including gold, [[Petroleum|oil]], and copper, account for 72% of export earnings. [[Elaeis guineensis|Oil palm]] production has grown steadily over recent years (largely from estates and with extensive outgrower output), with [[palm oil]] now the main agricultural export. In households participating, coffee remains the major export crop (produced largely in the Highlands provinces); followed by [[cocoa bean|cocoa]] and [[coconut oil]]/[[copra]] from the coastal areas, each largely produced by smallholders; tea, produced on estates; and rubber.

There is virtually no freehold title; the few existing freeholds are automatically converted to state lease when they are transferred between vendor and purchaser. Unalienated land is owned under customary title by traditional landowners. The precise nature of the [[seisin]] varies from one culture to another. Many writers portray land as in the communal ownership of traditional clans; however, closer studies usually show that the smallest portions of land whose ownership cannot be further divided are held by the individual heads of extended families and their descendants or their descendants alone if they have recently died.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nThis is a matter of vital importance because a problem of economic development is identifying the membership of customary landowning groups and the owners. Disputes between mining and forestry companies and landowner groups often devolve on the issue of whether the companies entered into contractual relations for the use of land with the true owners. Customary property\u2014usually land\u2014cannot be devised by will. It can only be inherited according to the custom of the deceased's people.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The Lands Act was amended in 2010 along with the Land Group Incorporation Act, intended to improve the management of state land, mechanisms for dispute resolution over land, and to enable customary landowners to be better able to access finance and possible partnerships over portions of their land, if they seek to develop it for urban or rural economic activities. The Land Group Incorporation Act requires more specific identification of the customary landowners than hitherto and their more specific authorisation before any land arrangements are determined; (a major issue in recent years has been a land grab, using, or rather misusing, the Lease-Leaseback provision under the Land Act, notably using 'Special Agricultural and Business Leases' (SABLs) to acquire vast tracts of customary land, purportedly for agricultural projects, but in an almost all cases as a back-door mechanism for securing tropical forest resources for logging\u2014circumventing the more exacting requirements of the Forest Act, for securing Timber Permits (which must comply with sustainability requirements and be competitively secured, and with the customary landowners approval).

The country, however, has no elements inscribed yet in the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]], despite having one of the widest array of intangible cultural heritage elements in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/887|title=Kuk Early Agricultural Site|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=whc.unesco.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/state/papua-new-guinea-PG|title=Papua New Guinea \u2013 intangible heritage \u2013 Culture Sector \u2013 UNESCO|website=ich.unesco.org}}</ref>\n\n=== Sport ===\n{{Main|Sport in Papua New Guinea}}\n\nSport is an important part of Papua New Guinean culture and [[rugby league]] is by far the most popular sport.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hadfield |first=Dave |title=Island gods high in a dream world |work=[[The Independent]] |date=8 October 1995 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/island-gods-high-in-a-dream-world-1576603.html |accessdate=6 October 2009}}</ref> In a nation where communities are far apart and many people live at a minimal subsistence level, rugby league has been described as a replacement for tribal warfare as a way of explaining the local enthusiasm for the game (a matter of life or death). Many Papua New Guineans have become instant celebrities by representing their country or playing in an overseas professional league. Even Australian rugby league players who have played in the annual [[State of Origin series]], which is celebrated feverishly every year in PNG, are among the most well-known people throughout the nation.\n\nState of Origin is a highlight of the year for most Papua New Guineans, although the support is so passionate that many people have died over the years in violent clashes supporting their team.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/world/three-dead-in-png-after-state-of-origin-violence-20090626-cywd.html |title=Three dead in PNG after State of Origin violence |publisher=BrisbaneTimes.com.au |date=26 June 2009 |accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref> The [[Papua New Guinea national rugby league team]] usually plays against the Australian Prime Minister's XIII (a selection of NRL players) each year, normally in Port Moresby.\n\nAlthough not as popular, [[Australian rules football]] is more significant in another way, as [[Papua New Guinea national Australian rules football team|the national team]] is ranked second, only after Australia. Other major sports which have a part in the Papua New Guinea sporting landscape are [[association football]], [[rugby union]], [[basketball]] and, in eastern Papua, [[cricket]].\n\nThe capital city, Port Moresby, hosted the [[Pacific Games]] in 2015.\n\n== Education ==\n{{Main|Education in Papua New Guinea}}\n\nA large proportion of the population is [[Literacy|illiterate]],<ref name=\"hdrstats.undp.org\">{{cite web|url=http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/data_sheets/cty_ds_PNG.html|title=Papua New Guinea HDI Rank \u2013 145|work=2007/2008 Human Development Report, Hdrstats.undp.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429193232/http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/data_sheets/cty_ds_PNG.html|archivedate=29 April 2009|accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref> with women predominating in this area.<ref name=\"hdrstats.undp.org\" /> Much of the education in PNG is provided by church institutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirche-in-not.de/aktuelle-meldungen/2009/03-06-papua-neuguinea-weltgebetstag-frauen-2009 |title=Kichte-in-not.de |publisher=Kirche-in-not.de |date= 6 March 2009|accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref> This includes 500 schools of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Papua New Guinea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nmz-mission.de/de.partner/de.papua-neuguinea/de.papua-neuguinea.2/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231014835/http://www.nmz-mission.de/de.partner/de.papua-neuguinea/de.papua-neuguinea.2/index.html |archivedate=31 December 2010 |title=Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Papua-Neuguinea |publisher=NMZ-mission.de |accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref> Papua New Guinea has six universities apart from other major tertiary institutions.

This has led to the establishment of the Research, Science and Technology Council. At its gathering in November 2014, the Council re-emphasised the need to focus on sustainable development through [[Science and technology in Pacific Island countries|science and technology]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=Paris|pages=693\u2013731}}</ref>\n\n''Vision 2050''<nowiki/>'s medium-term priorities are:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* emerging industrial technology for downstream processing;\n* infrastructure technology for the economic corridors;\n* knowledge-based technology;\n* science and engineering education; and\n* to reach the target of investing 5% of GDP in research and development by 2050.

Nine out of ten scientific publications from Papua New Guinea focused on immunology, genetics, biotechnology and microbiology. Nine out of ten were also co-authored by scientists from other countries, mainly Australia, the United States of America, United Kingdom, Spain and Switzerland.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nForestry is an important economic resource for Papua New Guinea but the industry uses low and semi-intensive technological inputs. As a result, product ranges are limited to sawed timber, veneer, plywood, block board, moulding, poles and posts and wood chips. Only a few limited finished products are exported. Lack of automated machinery, coupled with inadequately trained local technical personnel, are some of the obstacles to introducing automated machinery and design. Policy-makers need to turn their attention to eliminating these barriers, in order for forestry to make a more efficient and sustainable contribution to national economic development.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n{{anchor|Renewable energy}}In Papua New Guinea, renewable energy sources represent two-thirds of the total electricity supply.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 2015, the Secretariat of the [[Pacific Community]] observed that, 'while Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and Samoa are leading the way with large-scale hydropower projects, there is enormous potential to expand the deployment of other renewable energy options such as solar, wind, geothermal and ocean-based energy sources'.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.spc.int/edd/fr/section-01/energy-overview/energy?start=12|title=Pacific-first centre of excellence for renewable energy and energy efficiency takes shape|date=18 June 2015|work=Secretariat of Pacific Community press release|access-date=17 March 2017}}</ref> The European Union has funded the Renewable Energy in Pacific Island Countries Developing Skills and Capacity programme (EPIC).

As a result, air travel is the single most important form of transport for human and high density/value freight. Airplanes made it possible to open up the country during its early colonial period. Even today the two largest cities, [[Port Moresby]] and [[Lae]], are only directly connected by planes. Port Moresby is not linked by road to any of the other major towns, and many remote villages can only be reached by light aircraft or on foot.\n\n[[Jacksons International Airport]] is the major international airport in Papua New Guinea, located {{convert|5|mi|km|0|order=flip}} from Port Moresby.

The decree, to become law, must be passed by a vote of the Congress of Deputies. The conservative [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP) and the centre-right party [[Citizens (Spanish political party)|Ciudadanos]] (Cs) have announced they will not support the decree. The PP further stated it will appeal the measure to the Constitutional Court arguing that using a decree to change the Historical Memory Law is not valid because the proposed modifications to the Historical Memory Law do not respond to a situation of urgent need.

The decree, to become law, must be passed by a vote of the Congress of Deputies. The conservative [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP) and the centre-right party [[Citizens (Spanish political party)|Ciudadanos]] (Cs) have announced they will not support the decree. The PP further stated it will appeal the measure to the Constitutional Court arguing that using a decree to change the Historical Memory Law is not valid because the proposed modifications to the Historical Memory Law do not respond to a situation of urgent need.

These two factors had a significant impact on the 1918 college football season. \n\nA huge military offensive was planned by the Allied countries in the spring of 1919, so all able-bodied men of ages 18 to 20 were scheduled to be enlisted in the fall of 1918. As an alternative, the men were offered the option of enlisting in the [[Student Army Training Corps]], known as SATC, which would give them a chance to pursue (or continue pursuing) their educations at the same time as they participated in a 12-week war-training session. This was essentially an alternative to boot camp. The colleges were paid by the government to train the future soldiers, which enabled many of them to avoid closure. The program began on October 1, 1918. Most of the students who were potential football players were under the auspices of the War Department's SATC program.\n\nIn an early September meeting between college and War Department officials in [[Plattsburg, Missouri]] it became clear that the training regimen envisioned for the soldiers could be incompatible with participation in intercollegiate athletics.<ref name=\"Detroit\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/29942079/detroit_free_press_opinion_piece_on/|title=War Department's action makes serious problem for college athletics: Whether usual sports can be continued is question that must be threshed out; Difficult problem faces colleges on account of military training edict|last=Bushnell|first=Edward R.|date=September 8, 1918|work=Detroit Free Press|access-date=March 26, 2019}}</ref>  Coach Charles Bernier was one of those who successfully argued that athletics training was an important part of military training.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/29896334/opinion_piece_of_football_for_satc/|title=Sports Review|last=Tranter|first=Edward|date=September 13, 1918|work=The Buffalo Enquirer|access-date=March 25, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/29896202/general_story_about_football_in_1918/|title=Football season opens this week:  Gridiron game will prosper in all of Uncle Sam's camps|last=|first=|date=September 22, 1918|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 25, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/29703566/|title=Football season in United States to open within very short time:|last=|first=|date=September 26, 1918|work=Winston-Salem Journal|access-date=}}</ref> Virginia Tech made plans to continue its football program in conjunction with the [[Student Army Training Corps|SATC]] program.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/29739318/announcement_that_virginia_tech_would/|title=Tech will play football schedule as planned:  Coach Bernier says athletics important part of military training|last=|first=|date=August 18, 1918|work=Times Dispatch - Richmond|access-date=March 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nNotably, since Tech was an all-male military school in 1918, it did not have to make as many adjustments as other colleges which had to cooperate with the military to have football programs, or even remain open.\n\n====Original schedule====\nTech originally had a nine-game schedule which was supposed to start the first weekend of October.

This not only enabled colleges to justify the inclusion of football in the SATC regimen, it also helped fill the gaps left by some of their star athletes. For instance, at Virginia Tech, one of the team captains, [[Monk Younger]], was actually in the military in France during the season.

These two factors had a significant impact on the 1918 college football season. \n\nA huge military offensive was planned by the Allied countries in the spring of 1919, so all able-bodied men of ages 18 to 20 were scheduled to be enlisted in the fall of 1918. As an alternative, the men were offered the option of enlisting in the [[Student Army Training Corps]], known as SATC, which would give them a chance to pursue (or continue pursuing) their educations at the same time as they participated in a 12-week war-training session. This was essentially an alternative to boot camp. The colleges were paid by the government to train the future soldiers, which enabled many of them to avoid closure. The program began on October 1, 1918.
