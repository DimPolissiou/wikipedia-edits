A few minor references to Uther appear in [[Old Welsh language|Old Welsh]] [[Medieval Welsh literature|poems]], but his biography was first written down by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in his ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (''History of the Kings of Britain''), and Geoffrey's account of the character was used in most later versions. He is a fairly ambiguous individual throughout the literature, but is described as a strong king and a defender of the people.\n\nAccording to [[Matter of Britain|Arthurian legend]], [[Merlin]] magically disguises Uther to look like his enemy [[Gorlois]], enabling Uther to sleep with Gorlois' wife Lady [[Igraine]]. Thus Arthur, \"the once and future king\", is an illegitimate child (though later legend, as found in [[Thomas Malory|Malory]], emphasises that the conception occurred after Gorlois's death and that he was legitimated by Uther's subsequent marriage to Igraine<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/MaloryWks2|title=Morte d \u00c0rthur|last=Malory|first=Thomas|date=1997}}</ref>). This act of conception occurs the very night that Uther's troops dispatch Gorlois. The theme of [[illegitimacy|illegitimate conception]] is repeated in Arthur's siring of [[Mordred]] by his own half-sister [[Morgause]] in the 13th century ad French prose cycles, which was invented by them; it is Mordred who mortally wounds [[King Arthur]] in the [[Battle of Camlann]].\n\n==Epithet==\nUther's epithet ''Pendragon'' (composed of [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''pen'', \"head, chief, top\" and ''[[dragon]]'', \"dragon; [[warrior]]\"; borrowed from the Latin word {{lang|la|drac\u014d}}, plural {{lang|la|drac\u014dn\u0113s}}, \"dragon[s]\") literally means \"Chief-Dragon\" or \"Head-Dragon\", but in a figurative sense, \"chief leader\", \"chief of warriors\", \"commander-in-chief\", \"generalissimo\", or \"chief governor\".<ref>Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru, University of Wales Press, Vol III, 1994, p. 2726-2739, \"pen\", \"pendragon\"; Vol I, 1963 p. 1081, \"dragon\".</ref><ref name=\"Bromwich512\">Bromwich, ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein'', p. 512\u2013513.</ref> The name was misinterpreted by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' to mean \"dragon's head\".<ref name=\"Bromwich512\"/> According to Geoffrey and works based on his version, Uther acquired the epithet when he witnessed a portentous [[dragon]]-shaped comet, which inspired him to use dragons on his [[flag|standards]]. According to [[Robert de Boron]]<ref>de Boron, Robert. ''Merlin and the Grail''. Tr. Nigel Bryant. Cambridge: D.S. Brewer, 2001.</ref> and the cycles based on his work, it was Uther's older brother (elsewhere called [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius Ambrosius]]) who saw the comet and received the name \"Pendragon\", Uther taking his epithet after his death.\n\n==Early Welsh poetry==\nThough the Welsh tradition of the Arthurian legend is fragmentary, some material exists through the [[Welsh Triads]] and various poems. Uther appears in these fragments, where he is associated with Arthur and, in some cases, even appears as his father.\n\nHe is mentioned in the circa-10th-century Arthurian poem \"[[Pa gur]] yv y porthaur?\" (\"What man is the gatekeeper?\"), where it is only said of him that [[Mabon ap Modron|Mabon son of Modron]] is his servant. He is also memorialised with \"The Death-song of Uther Pen\" from the ''[[Book of Taliesin]]''.<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/t48.html \"The death-song of Uther Pendragon\"]</ref> The latter includes a reference to Arthur, so the marginal addition of \"dragon\" to Uther's name is probably justified. \"The Colloquy of Arthur and the Eagle,\" a modern manuscript from the 16th century but believed to have originated from the 13th century, mentions another son of Uther named Madoc, the father of Arthur's nephew [[Eliwlod]].<ref name=\"Bromwich512\"/>\n\nIn Triad 28, Uthyr is named the creator of one of the Three Great Enchantments of the Island of Britain, which he taught to the wizard [[Menw]].<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/triads1.html The Hergest Triads]</ref> Since Menw is a shapeshifter according to ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', it might be that Uther was one as well. If this is so, it opens up the possibility that Geoffrey of Monmouth's narrative about Uther impregnating Igerna with [[Merlin]]'s help (see below) was taken from a Welsh legend where Uthyr changed his own shape, Merlin possibly being added to the story by Geoffrey.<ref>Bromwich, ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein'', p. 56</ref>\n\nUthyr's other reference, Triad 51, however, shows influence from Geoffrey's ''Historia''. It follows Geoffrey's description of Uther as son of [[Constantine III (usurper)#Legend|Constantine III]], now called \"Custennin the Blessed\", and brother of both [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius Ambrosius]] (\"Emrys Wledig\") and [[Constans II (usurper)|Constans II]] (\"Custennin the Younger\").<ref>Bromwich, ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein'', pp. 132\u2013133</ref>\n\n==''Historia Regum Britanniae''==\n[[File:History of the Kings (f.72) Uthr Bendragon.jpg|thumb|left|Uther Pendragon in a crude illustration from a 15th-century Welsh version of ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'']]\nUther is best known from Geoffrey's ''Historia Regum Britanniae'' (1136) where he is the youngest son of King of Britannia, Constantine III. His eldest brother Constans succeeds to the throne on their father's death, but is murdered at the instigation of his adviser [[Vortigern]], who seizes the throne. Uther and his other brother, [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius Ambrosius]], still children, flee to [[Brittany]]. Vortigern makes an alliance with the [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxons]] under [[Hengest|Hengist]], but it goes disastrously wrong. Aurelius and Uther return, now adults. Aurelius burns Vortigern in his castle and becomes king.\n\nWith Aurelius on the throne, Uther leads his brother in arms to [[Celtic Ireland|Ireland]] to help [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]] bring the stones of [[Stonehenge]] from there to Britain. Later, while Aurelius is ill, Uther leads his army against Vortigern's son Paschent and his Saxon allies. On the way to the battle, he sees a comet in the shape of a dragon, which Merlin interprets as presaging Aurelius's death and Uther's glorious future. Uther wins the battle and takes the epithet \"Pendragon\", and returns to find that Aurelius has been poisoned by an assassin. He becomes king and orders the construction of two gold dragons, one of which he uses as his standard. \n\nHe secures Britain's frontiers and quells Saxon uprisings with the aids of his retainers, one of whom is [[Gorlois]], [[Duke of Cornwall]]. At a banquet celebrating their victories, Uther becomes obsessively enamoured of Gorlois' wife Igerna (Igraine), and a war ensues between Uther and his vassal. Gorlois sends Igerna to the impregnable castle of [[Tintagel]] for protection while he himself is besieged by Uther in another town. Uther consults with Merlin who uses his magic to transform the king into the likeness of Gorlois and thus gain access to Igerna at Tintagel. He spends the night with her and they conceive Arthur, but the next morning it is discovered that Gorlois had been killed. Uther marries Igerna and they have a daughter called Anna (in later romances she is called [[Morgause]] and is usually Igerna's daughter by her previous marriage). Morgause later marries [[King Lot]] and becomes the mother of [[Gawain]] and [[Mordred]].\n\nUther later falls ill and the wars begin to go badly against the Saxons. He insists on leading his army himself, propped up on his horse. He defeats Hengist's son [[Octa of Kent|Octa]] at [[Verulamium]] ([[St Albans]]), despite the Saxons calling him the \"Half-Dead King\". However, the Saxons soon contrive his death by poisoning a spring which he drinks from near Verulamium.<ref>[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], ''Historia Regum Britanniae'' [[Wikisource:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 6#5|6.5\u20139]], [[Wikisource:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 8#1|8.1\u201324]]</ref>\n\nUther's family is based on some historical figures; Constantine on the historical Constantine III, an [[Roman usurper|usurper]] claimant to the Roman throne from 407\u2013411, and Constans on his son. Aurelius Ambrosius is Ambrosius Aurelianus, mentioned by [[Gildas]], though his connection to Constantine and Constans is unrecorded.\n\n==Other medieval literature==\nIn [[Robert de Boron]]'s ''[[Merlin (poem)|Merlin]]'' Uther Pendragon kills Hengist after an assassination attempt by the Saxon leader and Merlin creates the [[Round Table (Camelot)|Round Table]] for him. In the ''[[Lancelot-Grail|Prose Lancelot]]'' Uther Pendragon claims to have been born in [[Bourges]]. He takes an army to [[Brittany]] to fight against King [[Claudas]] of Bourges, a situation resembling that of the historical ruler [[Riothamus]] who went to Brittany to fight ravagers based in Bourges.\n\nThere is an alternative account of Uther Pendragon's background in [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]'s ''[[Parzival]]''. A certain Mazad\u00e2n went with a fairy named Terdelaschoye to the land of Feimurg\u00e2n. (This looks like a garbling of some source that told of Mazad\u00e2n's alliance with the [[Morgan the Fay|Fay Morgan]] in Terre de la Joye; the \"Land of Joy\".) Mazad\u00e2n becomes father of two sons, Lazaliez and Brickus. Brickus becomes father of Utepandrag\u00fbn, father of Arthur, while the elder son, Lazaliez, becomes father of Gandin of [[Anjou]], father of Gahmuret, father of Parzival ([[Percival]]). Uther Pendragon and Arthur here appear as the scions of the junior branch of an unattested House of [[Anjou]]. In some early German literature, believed to have relied on some now lost Celtic material, Uther was sometimes said to have been descended from fairies. It may have been meant to explain Arthur\u2019s connection with Avalon. Since according to Geoffrey of Monmouth, Caliburn was a gift from Avalon, and Arthur was taken to Avalon to be healed. Layamon also said that, Arthur was given various blessings by fairies in his Brut. \n\nUther also appears in the [[chivalric romance]] ''[[Sir Cleges]]'' as the king to whom Sir Cleges brings the Christmas cherries, obtained by miracle.<ref>Laura A. Hibbard, ''Medieval Romance in England''. New York Burt Franklin, 1963. p.79.</ref>\n\n==Modern works==\n[[File:Pelleas and Igraine.jpg|thumb|Uther, on horseback and disguised as Pelleas, watches [[Igraine]] picking flowers in ''Uther and Igraine'' by [[Warwick Deeping]], illustrated by [[Wladyslaw T. Benda]]]]\n\nUther Pendragon remains a widely used character in modern [[List of books about King Arthur|Arthurian literature]] and other fiction. \n\n*In [[T. H. White]]'s ''[[The Once and Future King]]'', Uther the Conqueror is the Norman King of England.\n*[[Mary Stewart (novelist)|Mary Stewart]]'s first two books in her Arthurian saga, ''[[The Crystal Cave]]'' and ''[[The Hollow Hills]]'', feature Uther Pendragon as [[Merlin]]'s uncle, Merlin being his brother [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Ambrosius]]' illegitimate son. Uther is depicted as a mostly decent but rather oversexed character, who becomes impotent in later life because of a groin injury, a [[Fisher King]] figure. \n*In [[Bernard Cornwell]]'s ''[[The Warlord Chronicles]]'', Uther is the King of [[Dumnonia]] as well as the High King of Britain ruling from [[Dumnonia]]. In these novels, Arthur is his illegitimate son and Morgan is his illegitimate daughter. Cornwell's Uther is highly sceptical of Christianity.\n*In [[Jack Whyte]]'s ''[[The Camulod Chronicles]]'', Uther is King of the Pendragon, the Celtic people of South Cambria, cousin to Caius Merlyn Britannicus and Ambrose Ambrosianus Britannicus. Whyte's novel ''Uther'', written in 2000, revolves around a fictionalised version of Uther's life.\n*In contrast to traditional versions, [[Stephen R. Lawhead]]'s ''[[Pendragon Cycle]]'' makes Uther's brother [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius]], whose widow ([[Igraine|Ygerna]]) he marries, Arthur's true father.\n*In [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]'s ''[[Mists of Avalon]]'', Uther is the nephew of [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelianus]] instead of his brother; while Aurelianus is the son of a [[List of Roman Emperors|Roman Emperor]], Uther has no Roman blood. \n*In [[Valerio Massimo Manfredi]]'s ''[[The Last Legion]]'', Uther is himself the last Roman Emperor, [[Romulus Augustus]]. While the real Romulus Augustus disappeared from history after being deposed by [[Goths]], in the novel he escapes to Britain, where he adopts the name Pendragon and eventually sires Arthur.\n*In D. J. MacHale's ''Pendragon'' series, the main character, Bobby Pendragon, is the reincarnation of either Uther or his son Arthur.\n*In [[John Boorman]]'s film ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'', [[Gabriel Byrne]] plays an ambitious but somewhat obtuse Uther Pendragon, whose uncontrollable lust for Igrayne, while necessary for the birth of Arthur, proves also his own undoing.\n*In the [[BBC]] television series ''[[Merlin (TV series)|Merlin]]'', Uther, played by [[Anthony Head]], has banned magic in Camelot and slaughtered any who openly practise the art. It is revealed his wife Ygraine was unable to conceive, so [[Nimueh]], a sorceress and friend, helped in the conception of Arthur. However, to keep balance in the world, a life had to be taken in exchange. Thus, Ygraine died at Arthur's birth, and Uther's guilt spurred him to purge all magic from Camelot. His wanton cruelty eventually causes his ward [[Morgan le Fay|Morgana]], who possesses magic herself, to turn against him. She is later revealed as his illegitimate daughter, and covets control of Camelot from then on. In series 4, Uther is wounded during an assassination attempt on Arthur. Merlin tries to heal him but due to Morgana's meddling, the spell instead kills him.\n*In the television series ''[[Camelot (TV series)|Camelot]]'' Uther is poisoned by Morgana in the first episode.

A few minor references to Uther appear in [[Old Welsh language|Old Welsh]] [[Medieval Welsh literature|poems]], but his biography was first written down by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in his ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (''History of the Kings of Britain''), and Geoffrey's account of the character was used in most later versions. He is a fairly ambiguous individual throughout the literature, but is described as a strong king and a defender of the people.\n\nAccording to [[Matter of Britain|Arthurian legend]], [[Merlin]] magically disguises Uther to look like his enemy [[Gorlois]], enabling Uther to sleep with Gorlois' wife Lady [[Igraine]]. Thus Arthur, \"the once and future king\", is an illegitimate child (though later legend, as found in [[Thomas Malory|Malory]], emphasises that the conception occurred after Gorlois's death and that he was legitimated by Uther's subsequent marriage to Igraine<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/MaloryWks2|title=Morte d \u00c0rthur|last=Malory|first=Thomas|date=1997}}</ref>). This act of conception occurs the very night that Uther's troops dispatch Gorlois. The theme of [[illegitimacy|illegitimate conception]] is repeated in Arthur's siring of [[Mordred]] by his own half-sister [[Morgause]] in the 13th century ad French prose cycles, which was invented by them; it is Mordred who mortally wounds [[King Arthur]] in the [[Battle of Camlann]].\n\n==Epithet==\nUther's epithet ''Pendragon'' (composed of [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''pen'', \"head, chief, top\" and ''[[dragon]]'', \"dragon; [[warrior]]\"; borrowed from the Latin word {{lang|la|drac\u014d}}, plural {{lang|la|drac\u014dn\u0113s}}, \"dragon[s]\") literally means \"Chief-Dragon\" or \"Head-Dragon\", but in a figurative sense, \"chief leader\", \"chief of warriors\", \"commander-in-chief\", \"generalissimo\", or \"chief governor\".<ref>Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru, University of Wales Press, Vol III, 1994, p. 2726-2739, \"pen\", \"pendragon\"; Vol I, 1963 p. 1081, \"dragon\".</ref><ref name=\"Bromwich512\">Bromwich, ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein'', p. 512\u2013513.</ref> The name was misinterpreted by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' to mean \"dragon's head\".<ref name=\"Bromwich512\"/> According to Geoffrey and works based on his version, Uther acquired the epithet when he witnessed a portentous [[dragon]]-shaped comet, which inspired him to use dragons on his [[flag|standards]]. According to [[Robert de Boron]]<ref>de Boron, Robert. ''Merlin and the Grail''. Tr. Nigel Bryant. Cambridge: D.S. Brewer, 2001.</ref> and the cycles based on his work, it was Uther's older brother (elsewhere called [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius Ambrosius]]) who saw the comet and received the name \"Pendragon\", Uther taking his epithet after his death.\n\n==Early Welsh poetry==\nThough the Welsh tradition of the Arthurian legend is fragmentary, some material exists through the [[Welsh Triads]] and various poems. Uther appears in these fragments, where he is associated with Arthur and, in some cases, even appears as his father.\n\nHe is mentioned in the circa-10th-century Arthurian poem \"[[Pa gur]] yv y porthaur?\" (\"What man is the gatekeeper?\"), where it is only said of him that [[Mabon ap Modron|Mabon son of Modron]] is his servant. He is also memorialised with \"The Death-song of Uther Pen\" from the ''[[Book of Taliesin]]''.<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/t48.html \"The death-song of Uther Pendragon\"]</ref> The latter includes a reference to Arthur, so the marginal addition of \"dragon\" to Uther's name is probably justified. \"The Colloquy of Arthur and the Eagle,\" a modern manuscript from the 16th century but believed to have originated from the 13th century, mentions another son of Uther named Madoc, the father of Arthur's nephew [[Eliwlod]].<ref name=\"Bromwich512\"/>\n\nIn Triad 28, Uthyr is named the creator of one of the Three Great Enchantments of the Island of Britain, which he taught to the wizard [[Menw]].<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/triads1.html The Hergest Triads]</ref> Since Menw is a shapeshifter according to ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', it might be that Uther was one as well. If this is so, it opens up the possibility that Geoffrey of Monmouth's narrative about Uther impregnating Igerna with [[Merlin]]'s help (see below) was taken from a Welsh legend where Uthyr changed his own shape, Merlin possibly being added to the story by Geoffrey.<ref>Bromwich, ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein'', p. 56</ref>\n\nUthyr's other reference, Triad 51, however, shows influence from Geoffrey's ''Historia''. It follows Geoffrey's description of Uther as son of [[Constantine III (usurper)#Legend|Constantine III]], now called \"Custennin the Blessed\", and brother of both [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius Ambrosius]] (\"Emrys Wledig\") and [[Constans II (usurper)|Constans II]] (\"Custennin the Younger\").<ref>Bromwich, ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein'', pp. 132\u2013133</ref>\n\n==''Historia Regum Britanniae''==\n[[File:History of the Kings (f.72) Uthr Bendragon.jpg|thumb|left|Uther Pendragon in a crude illustration from a 15th-century Welsh version of ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'']]\nUther is best known from Geoffrey's ''Historia Regum Britanniae'' (1136) where he is the youngest son of King of Britannia, Constantine III. His eldest brother Constans succeeds to the throne on their father's death, but is murdered at the instigation of his adviser [[Vortigern]], who seizes the throne. Uther and his other brother, [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius Ambrosius]], still children, flee to [[Brittany]]. Vortigern makes an alliance with the [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxons]] under [[Hengest|Hengist]], but it goes disastrously wrong. Aurelius and Uther return, now adults. Aurelius burns Vortigern in his castle and becomes king.\n\nWith Aurelius on the throne, Uther leads his brother in arms to [[Celtic Ireland|Ireland]] to help [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]] bring the stones of [[Stonehenge]] from there to Britain. Later, while Aurelius is ill, Uther leads his army against Vortigern's son Paschent and his Saxon allies. On the way to the battle, he sees a comet in the shape of a dragon, which Merlin interprets as presaging Aurelius's death and Uther's glorious future. Uther wins the battle and takes the epithet \"Pendragon\", and returns to find that Aurelius has been poisoned by an assassin. He becomes king and orders the construction of two gold dragons, one of which he uses as his standard. \n\nHe secures Britain's frontiers and quells Saxon uprisings with the aids of his retainers, one of whom is [[Gorlois]], [[Duke of Cornwall]]. At a banquet celebrating their victories, Uther becomes obsessively enamoured of Gorlois' wife Igerna (Igraine), and a war ensues between Uther and his vassal. Gorlois sends Igerna to the impregnable castle of [[Tintagel]] for protection while he himself is besieged by Uther in another town. Uther consults with Merlin who uses his magic to transform the king into the likeness of Gorlois and thus gain access to Igerna at Tintagel. He spends the night with her and they conceive Arthur, but the next morning it is discovered that Gorlois had been killed. Uther marries Igerna and they have a daughter called Anna (in later romances she is called [[Morgause]] and is usually Igerna's daughter by her previous marriage). Morgause later marries [[King Lot]] and becomes the mother of [[Gawain]] and [[Mordred]].\n\nUther later falls ill and the wars begin to go badly against the Saxons. He insists on leading his army himself, propped up on his horse. He defeats Hengist's son [[Octa of Kent|Octa]] at [[Verulamium]] ([[St Albans]]), despite the Saxons calling him the \"Half-Dead King\". However, the Saxons soon contrive his death by poisoning a spring which he drinks from near Verulamium.<ref>[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], ''Historia Regum Britanniae'' [[Wikisource:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 6#5|6.5\u20139]], [[Wikisource:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 8#1|8.1\u201324]]</ref>\n\nUther's family is based on some historical figures; Constantine on the historical Constantine III, an [[Roman usurper|usurper]] claimant to the Roman throne from 407\u2013411, and Constans on his son. Aurelius Ambrosius is Ambrosius Aurelianus, mentioned by [[Gildas]], though his connection to Constantine and Constans is unrecorded.\n\n==Other medieval literature==\nIn [[Robert de Boron]]'s ''[[Merlin (poem)|Merlin]]'' Uther Pendragon kills Hengist after an assassination attempt by the Saxon leader and Merlin creates the [[Round Table (Camelot)|Round Table]] for him. In the ''[[Lancelot-Grail|Prose Lancelot]]'' Uther Pendragon claims to have been born in [[Bourges]]. He takes an army to [[Brittany]] to fight against King [[Claudas]] of Bourges, a situation resembling that of the historical ruler [[Riothamus]] who went to Brittany to fight ravagers based in Bourges.\n\nThere is an alternative account of Uther Pendragon's background in [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]'s ''[[Parzival]]''. A certain Mazad\u00e2n went with a fairy named Terdelaschoye to the land of Feimurg\u00e2n. (This looks like a garbling of some source that told of Mazad\u00e2n's alliance with the [[Morgan the Fay|Fay Morgan]] in Terre de la Joye; the \"Land of Joy\".) Mazad\u00e2n becomes father of two sons, Lazaliez and Brickus. Brickus becomes father of Utepandrag\u00fbn, father of Arthur, while the elder son, Lazaliez, becomes father of Gandin of [[Anjou]], father of Gahmuret, father of Parzival ([[Percival]]). Uther Pendragon and Arthur here appear as the scions of the junior branch of an unattested House of [[Anjou]]. In some early German literature, believed to have relied on some now lost Celtic material, Uther was sometimes said to have been descended from fairies. It may have been meant to explain Arthur\u2019s connection with Avalon. Since according to Geoffrey of Monmouth, Caliburn was a gift from Avalon, and Arthur was taken to Avalon to be healed. Layamon also said that, Arthur was given various blessings by fairies in his Brut. \n\nUther also appears in the [[chivalric romance]] ''[[Sir Cleges]]'' as the king to whom Sir Cleges brings the Christmas cherries, obtained by miracle.<ref>Laura A. Hibbard, ''Medieval Romance in England''. New York Burt Franklin, 1963. p.79.</ref>\n\n==Modern works==\n[[File:Pelleas and Igraine.jpg|thumb|Uther, on horseback and disguised as Pelleas, watches [[Igraine]] picking flowers in ''Uther and Igraine'' by [[Warwick Deeping]], illustrated by [[Wladyslaw T. Benda]]]]\n\nUther Pendragon remains a widely used character in modern [[List of books about King Arthur|Arthurian literature]] and other fiction. \n\n*In [[T. H. White]]'s ''[[The Once and Future King]]'', Uther the Conqueror is the Norman King of England.\n*[[Mary Stewart (novelist)|Mary Stewart]]'s first two books in her Arthurian saga, ''[[The Crystal Cave]]'' and ''[[The Hollow Hills]]'', feature Uther Pendragon as [[Merlin]]'s uncle, Merlin being his brother [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Ambrosius]]' illegitimate son. Uther is depicted as a mostly decent but rather oversexed character, who becomes impotent in later life because of a groin injury, a [[Fisher King]] figure. \n*In [[Bernard Cornwell]]'s ''[[The Warlord Chronicles]]'', Uther is the King of [[Dumnonia]] as well as the High King of Britain ruling from [[Dumnonia]]. In these novels, Arthur is his illegitimate son and Morgan is his illegitimate daughter. Cornwell's Uther is highly sceptical of Christianity.\n*In [[Jack Whyte]]'s ''[[The Camulod Chronicles]]'', Uther is King of the Pendragon, the Celtic people of South Cambria, cousin to Caius Merlyn Britannicus and Ambrose Ambrosianus Britannicus. Whyte's novel ''Uther'', written in 2000, revolves around a fictionalised version of Uther's life.\n*In contrast to traditional versions, [[Stephen R. Lawhead]]'s ''[[Pendragon Cycle]]'' makes Uther's brother [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius]], whose widow ([[Igraine|Ygerna]]) he marries, Arthur's true father.\n*In [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]'s ''[[Mists of Avalon]]'', Uther is the nephew of [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelianus]] instead of his brother; while Aurelianus is the son of a [[List of Roman Emperors|Roman Emperor]], Uther has no Roman blood. \n*In [[Valerio Massimo Manfredi]]'s ''[[The Last Legion]]'', Uther is himself the last Roman Emperor, [[Romulus Augustus]]. While the real Romulus Augustus disappeared from history after being deposed by [[Goths]], in the novel he escapes to Britain, where he adopts the name Pendragon and eventually sires Arthur.\n*In D. J. MacHale's ''Pendragon'' series, the main character, Bobby Pendragon, is the reincarnation of either Uther or his son Arthur.\n*In [[John Boorman]]'s film ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'', [[Gabriel Byrne]] plays an ambitious but somewhat obtuse Uther Pendragon, whose uncontrollable lust for Igrayne, while necessary for the birth of Arthur, proves also his own undoing.\n*In the [[BBC]] television series ''[[Merlin (TV series)|Merlin]]'', Uther, played by [[Anthony Head]], has banned magic in Camelot and slaughtered any who openly practise the art. It is revealed his wife Ygraine was unable to conceive, so [[Nimueh]], a sorceress and friend, helped in the conception of Arthur. However, to keep balance in the world, a life had to be taken in exchange. Thus, Ygraine died at Arthur's birth, and Uther's guilt spurred him to purge all magic from Camelot. His wanton cruelty eventually causes his ward [[Morgan le Fay|Morgana]], who possesses magic herself, to turn against him. She is later revealed as his illegitimate daughter, and covets control of Camelot from then on. In series 4, Uther is wounded during an assassination attempt on Arthur. Merlin tries to heal him but due to Morgana's meddling, the spell instead kills him.\n*In the television series ''[[Camelot (TV series)|Camelot]]'' Uther is poisoned by Morgana in the first episode. Here she is his daughter, but was sent to the convent after he married Igraine.\n\n*In [[Guy Ritchie]]'s 2017 film ''[[King Arthur: Legend of the Sword]]'', [[Eric Bana]] plays Uther Pendragon, betrayed and murdered by his brother [[Vortigern]] for control over Camelot.\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category}}\n* [[King Arthur's family]]\n* [[List of legendary kings of Britain]]\n* [[Pendragon Castle]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* [[Rachel Bromwich|Bromwich, Rachel]] (2006).

East Cobb consists primarily of unincorporated areas near Marietta, and a significant portion of unincorporated area near [[Roswell, Georgia|Roswell]], as defined by [[United States Postal Service]] [[ZIP code]]s (though Roswell itself was in Cobb until 1932).  A small sliver of an unincorporated area near Atlanta is in the extreme southern tip near [[Vinings, Georgia|Vinings]], and a portion of the northwest is in  an unincorporated area near [[Kennesaw, Georgia|Kennesaw]] (30144). ZIP codes that are associated with this area are (30144), (30188), (30062), (30066), (30067), (30068), and some of (30075).

The area was developed as a suburb of Atlanta beginning in the 1960s. The \"city\" of [[Chattahoochee Plantation]], which never had a [[city government]], was established along the river by the [[Georgia General Assembly]] entirely to prevent Atlanta from [[annexation]] in 1961, and was officially abolished in 1995 along with dozens of other Georgia towns with defunct governments.\n\n===Incorporation as a city===\nIn contrast to other northern suburbs of Atlanta, East Cobb has remained [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated]].

There is no complicated science. When you have been doing this for so many years, you bring the skill to automatism.

I constantly find common themes in my songs, but I never had the feeling that I was working on a pattern. It would be immoral and unnatural, and I would not want to.

Common themes include religion, violence and dysfunctional relationships; often they are intertwined. His increasingly narrative songs often feature banjo and, since the recording of his fourth album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', strings.\n\nOne topic that Munly deliberately does not write about is politics, since he \"hates\" music that veers into that kind of territory.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he admits that the stories and songs that he writes can be applied to real-world events in a way that coincidentally fits.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" />\n\nHis written works have been compared to that of: [[Edward Gorey]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Charles Portis]],<ref name=\"SC NARC\">{{cite news |last1=Fisher |first1=Lee |title=Interview: Slim Cessna's Auto Club |url=https://narcmagazine.com/slim-cessnas-auto-club/ |accessdate=18 April 2020 |work=NARC. |publisher=NARC Magazine |date=October 10, 2016 |ref=SC NARC}}</ref> [[Flannery O'Connor]],<ref name=\"SC Lonesome\">{{cite news |last1=Rapid |first1=Steve |title=Slim Cessna: An Introduction to Young and Old Ireland |url=https://www.lonesomehighway.com/interviewsold/2017/10/3/slim-cessna-interview.html |accessdate=18 April 2020 |work=Lonesome Highway |date=October 3, 2017 |ref=SC Lonesome}}</ref> [[David Byrne]],<ref name=\"SCAC San Diego\">{{cite news |last1=Roche |first1=Donovan |title=Slim Cessna's hillbilly hootenanny |url=https://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2017/feb/24/concert-slim-cessnas-hillbilly-hootenany/ |accessdate=18 April 2020 |work=San Diego Reader |date=February 24, 2017 |ref=SCAC San Diego}}</ref> and [[Nick Cave]].\n\n===Vocals===\n\nTechnically, Munly is a baritone, but his [[vocal range]] extends from A1 to F5.<ref name=\"Munly Vocal Range 1\">{{cite news |title=Jay \"Munly\" Munly |url=https://therangeplanet.proboards.com/thread/14/jay-munly |accessdate=9 April 2020 |work=The Range Planet |date=September 22, 2019 |ref=Munly Vocal Range 1}}</ref> Audio samples can be found on Youtube.<ref name=\"Munly Vocal Range 2\">{{cite web |title=The Vocal Range of Jay Munly |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_hVoW0VwVA |via=YouTube |accessdate=April 9, 2020 |ref=Munly Vocal Range 2}}</ref> \n\nEarly on in his solo career, he sang at a higher register than what he usually sounds like on his later records. \n\nOn the expanded DVDs of ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004) and ''The Commandments According to SCAC'' (2016), Munly read the lyrics of each song as poetry, employing a wide range of voices to the characters in his songs.\n\n===Controversial lyrics===\n\nAs stated in a few interviews, people have found some of Munly's material controversial and politically incorrect.

''Munly de Dar He'' and ''Galvanized Yankee'' were also released through Top Notch in 1997 and 1999, respectively. His fourth and final solo album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', was released through [[Alternative Tentacles]] in 2002.

In a 2012 interview with [[Westword]], he says that his brother took him to the [[Bob Johnson (ice hockey, born 1931)|Bob Johnson]] ice hockey school to play.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\n===Interest in music===\n\nHis interest in music initially stemmed from boredom as he was recovering from an ice hockey injury.

There is no complicated science. When you have been doing this for so many years, you bring the skill to automatism. I can start with a melody, but I can with a text \u2013 I always have a lot of words, I write a lot. I constantly find common themes in my songs, but I never had the feeling that I was working on a pattern. It would be immoral and unnatural, and I would not want to.

Common themes include religion, violence and dysfunctional relationships; often they are intertwined. His increasingly narrative songs often feature banjo and, since the recording of his fourth album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', strings.\n\nOne topic that Munly deliberately does not write about is politics, since he \"hates\" music that veers into that kind of territory.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he admits that the stories and songs that he writes can be applied to real-world events in a way that coincidentally fits.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" />\n\nHis written works have been compared to that of: [[Edward Gorey]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Charles Portis]],<ref name=\"SC NARC\">{{cite news |last1=Fisher |first1=Lee |title=Interview: Slim Cessna's Auto Club |url=https://narcmagazine.com/slim-cessnas-auto-club/ |accessdate=18 April 2020 |work=NARC. |publisher=NARC Magazine |date=October 10, 2016 |ref=SC NARC}}</ref> [[Flannery O'Connor]],<ref name=\"SC Lonesome\">{{cite news |last1=Rapid |first1=Steve |title=Slim Cessna: An Introduction to Young and Old Ireland |url=https://www.lonesomehighway.com/interviewsold/2017/10/3/slim-cessna-interview.html |accessdate=18 April 2020 |work=Lonesome Highway |date=October 3, 2017 |ref=SC Lonesome}}</ref> [[David Byrne]],<ref name=\"SCAC San Diego\">{{cite news |last1=Roche |first1=Donovan |title=Slim Cessna's hillbilly hootenanny |url=https://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2017/feb/24/concert-slim-cessnas-hillbilly-hootenany/ |accessdate=18 April 2020 |work=San Diego Reader |date=February 24, 2017 |ref=SCAC San Diego}}</ref> and [[Nick Cave]].\n\n===Vocals===\n\nTechnically, Munly is a baritone, but his [[vocal range]] extends from A1 to F5.<ref name=\"Munly Vocal Range 1\">{{cite news |title=Jay \"Munly\" Munly |url=https://therangeplanet.proboards.com/thread/14/jay-munly |accessdate=9 April 2020 |work=The Range Planet |date=September 22, 2019 |ref=Munly Vocal Range 1}}</ref> Audio samples can be found on Youtube.<ref name=\"Munly Vocal Range 2\">{{cite web |title=The Vocal Range of Jay Munly |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_hVoW0VwVA |via=YouTube |accessdate=April 9, 2020 |ref=Munly Vocal Range 2}}</ref> \n\nEarly on in his solo career, he sang at a higher register than what he usually sounds like on his later records. \n\nOn the expanded DVDs of ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004) and ''The Commandments According to SCAC'' (2016), Munly read the lyrics of each song as poetry, employing a wide range of voices to the characters in his songs.\n\n===Controversial lyrics===\n\nAs stated in a few interviews, people have found some of Munly's material controversial and politically incorrect.

''Munly de Dar He'' and ''Galvanized Yankee'' were also released through Top Notch in 1997 and 1999, respectively. His fourth and final solo album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', was released through [[Alternative Tentacles]] in 2002. Each of these albums were re-mastered by Bob Ferbrache and re-released as limited editions through Smooch Records in 2006. Only 1,000 copies of each were printed.\n\nHe has worked with several musicians that are featured on his albums, such as John Ellison of The Reejers and Chris Mars of The Replacements.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he makes a point of not listing the exact musical contributions of each member in liner notes, preferring the simplicity of the 'Modern Library book' aesthetic.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />\n\nAlthough Munly is the primary vocalist and lyricist on each of his albums, he hesitates to call himself a \"singer-songwriter\":\n\n''{{quote|\"It's kind of rough being a solo artist.

Among them was [[Heber J. Grant]], who was then a member of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve]] and later became the church's [[List of presidents of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|7th]] [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|president]]. Horace S. Ensign, Louis A. Kelsch and Alma O. Taylor accompanied Grant. The LDS Church's first baptism in Japan was on March 8, 1902, when Grant baptized Hajime Nakazawa, a former [[Kannushi]] ([[Shinto]] priest). The [[Book of Mormon]] was translated three times. The first translation, which took over six years, was completed by Taylor in 1909. It was then recommended that the Book of Mormon be translated into ''bunsh\u014d'', a more elegant literary style, which was done by Ch\u014dk\u014d Ikuta in 1909, shortly before it was published and distributed. The second translation in 1957 was done by Tatsui Sato. In 1995, the Book of Mormon was translated again into a more colloquial style.\n\nMissionary work from the opening of the Japan [[Mission (LDS Church)|Mission]] through 1924 was challenging due to language barriers and cultural differences, as well as the [[1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake|1923 Tokyo earthquake]] and the [[Immigration Act of 1924]]. Few baptisms were performed during this time period. Due to these difficulties, the Japan Mission was closed from 1924 to 1945, until after the end of [[World War II]]. During the twenty years missionary work was halted in Japan, the work was moved to Hawaii in order to reach Japanese people living there. A small number of [[Latter-day Saints]] in Japan met together privately in their homes from 1924 to 1945, under the leadership of Fujiya Nara and later Fujiwara Takeo.\n\nThe mission was reopened in 1948 with [[Edward L. Clissold]] as [[mission president|president]]. Missionary work flourished after 1948 with the number of baptisms increasing, requiring new missions to be opened. The LDS Church decided to open the Mormon Pavilion during the [[Expo '70]] in Osaka. After the Expo, baptisms doubled from 1969 to 1970. Two days after the Expo finished, the church's first [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stake]] in Japan was established in Tokyo in 1970. The [[Tokyo Japan Temple]], the first temple in Japan and in Asia, was [[dedication|dedicated]] in 1980.\n\nAs of 2018, the LDS Church reported 129,335 members, 7 missions, and 3 temples in Japan.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== 1901\u20131924: Establishment of the Japan Mission ===\n==== Missionary efforts ====\n[[Walter M. Gibson]], sent by [[Brigham Young]], attempted to send missionaries to the Pacific in 1861, but stopped his mission in Hawaii.{{sfn|Andrade|1996|p=11}} He wrote a book of strict instructions for a morally and physically clean life that the Hawaiian people should follow, called the \"Sanitary Instructions\".{{sfn|Gibson|1881}} He was excommunicated from the church in 1864 for selling church offices to islanders and using the money to buy large amounts of land on Lanai.{{sfn|Adler|Kamins|1984|p=96}} In 1895, the Japanese Consul in San Francisco asked [[Abraham H. Cannon]] if there were plans to open up a mission in Japan. However, he died before the mission could be established. Then in 1901, the church's [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] announced the opening of the Japan Mission.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=24}}\n\nHeber J. Grant, of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and later the church's 7th president, was assigned to establish the first LDS Church mission in [[Asia]], headquartered in [[Tokyo]].<ref>{{harvnb|Grant|2002}}; {{harvnb|Hinckley|1964|p=168}}</ref> The [[Panic of 1893]] caused him to go into a lot of debt, so at the time, he was in serious financial distress.{{sfn|Walker|1986|p=24}} The First Presidency allowed him one year to get out of debt, which he did in the allotted time.{{sfn|Walker|1986|p=24}}\n\nGrant handpicked the first three missionaries to serve with him in Japan: Horace S. Ensign, Louis A. Kelsch, and Alma O. Taylor. They became known as the \"Japanese Quartet\".{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|pp=24\u201325}} They arrived in Japan on August 12, 1901. Despite their arrival, the missionaries did not yet have permission from the government to proselyte, so they spent their time learning the language. After lobbying with the chief of police, the missionaries received permission to preach in early October.{{sfn|Britsch|1968|pp=214\u2013222}} The missionaries, particularly Grant, had great difficulties learning the language.{{sfn|Britsch|1968|p=225}} The missionaries met Takahashi Gor\u014d, who had previously published a defense of the Mormons in the periodical ''The Sun''. Takahashi spoke good English and had a knowledge of other languages. He decided to help Grant by writing a book that would introduce the mission of the Latter-day Saints to the Japanese people.{{sfn|Britsch|1968|pp=238\u2013241}} Nakazawa Hajime became the first baptized member in Japan.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=25}} Nakazawa soon began asking Grant for money to start a new business, and because the LDS Church is prohibited in loaning members money to start businesses, Grant refused. Nakazawa was caught robbing the mission house and was excommunicated from the church and arrested. After the arrest of Nakazawa, Takahashi no longer supported the missionaries, describing Grant as cruel and \"cold-blooded\" for refusing to pay Nazakawa.{{sfn|Brady|1983|p=170}}\n\nFrom 1902 to 1924, eighty-eight missionaries proselyted in twenty-nine locations, laboring largely in Tokyo, [[Sapporo]], and [[Osaka]], performing 166 baptisms.{{sfn|Britsch|1992|p=77}} However, on August 7, 1924, Grant, then president of the church, closed the mission to await a more favorable time, due to the low number of baptisms.<ref>{{harvnb|Britsch|1975|pp=171\u2013190}}; {{harvnb|Neilson|Gessel|2006|pp=229}}</ref>\n\nSeveral issues contributed to the low number of baptisms. Ongoing problems in the mission included the difficulty of the language, as well as cultural differences. Also, the small number of missionaries and their extended service caused fatigue among them and hardships for their loved ones. There were also external problems: the earthquake in Tokyo in 1923 stalled proselytizing, the United States' [[Immigration Act of 1924]] caused racial tensions between Japan and the United States. Finally, the general sense of defeatism of the missionaries in Japan and Church leaders in Salt Lake City influenced the decision to close the mission in Japan.<ref>{{harvnb|Britsch|1975|pp=1\u201313}}; {{harvnb|Hoffman|2007|pp=28\u201329}}</ref> Nevertheless, even though they did not baptize many members, they translated the [[Book of Mormon]] into Japanese. They also wrote a Japanese hymnbook, a history of the Church, a biography of [[Joseph Smith]], and other literature. Missionaries, as well as the Church in general, gained experience that would make the reestablishment of the mission in 1948 more successful.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=230}}\n\n==== First Japanese church members ====\nThe first baptized Japanese member was Hajime Nakazawa, a former [[Shinto]] priest. He was baptized on March 8, 1902, on the shore of [[\u014cmori, \u014cta, Tokyo|Omori]] in [[Tokyo Bay]].{{sfn|Takagi|2000|p=73}} Although he was the first baptized member, he was not the first active member of the LDS Church. After he was baptized, he and his wife asked the missionaries for a significant amount of money. The missionaries refused and he was later caught attempting to rob the missionaries' home, possibly indicating that he only agreed to get baptized in hopes of obtaining money from the church. He was then excommunicated and subsequently arrested.{{sfn|Britsch|1968|pp=240\u2013269}}\n\nOne of the most prominent first Japanese church members was Tomizo Katsunuma, a veterinarian and immigration inspector in Honolulu, honored as the \"Father of Immigrants\". He is notable as one of the first members of LDS Church with Japanese ancestry.{{sfn|Takagi|2000|p=74}} He moved to the United States during the emigration fever.{{sfn|Takagi|2000|p=74}} He had many contacts with LDS Church members in Logan, Utah, which influenced his decision to get baptized on August 8, 1895. After his death, the headline of the obituary read \"Dr. Katsunuma, first Japanese Mormon, dies.\"{{sfn|Takagi|2000|pp=83\u201384}}\n\nTokujiro Sato was another one of the church's first Japanese converts. Tokujiro immigrated to Hawaii from Japan. Tukujiro supposedly joined the church in 1892, though because of the lack of records, it is unclear when he was baptized or whether he was baptized at all. He was listed in membership records in the Waipio [[Branch (LDS Church)|Branch]], but there is no baptism record. However, the baptisms of his children were recorded and, despite the lack of records, Taokujiro attended the LDS Church throughout his life.{{sfn|Takagi|2000|pp=94\u201395}}\n\n==== Portrayal of the church in Japan ====\nOther Christian churches often preached against the LDS Church, criticizing its doctrines, yet admitting the strange propensity it seemed to have in attracting followers. The doctrine of the church, and polygamy in particular, was seen as a threat to Japanese culture and the Meiji society's ideals of civilization. Even though the Japanese people heard about the church through the [[Iwakura Mission]] to the United States in 1872, the earliest official printed introduction of the Japanese people to the LDS Church was likely the 1879 Japanese translation of [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[Around the World in 80 Days]]''. [[Jean Passepartout]], a character in the book, heard a lecture on Mormonism and polygamy which disturbed him. Magazine articles helped to spread the knowledge of the church in Japan, however, the articles focused on polygamy and its dangers to women and society in an increasingly Westernizing country.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|pp=128\u2013129}} Some Japanese saw the polygamous practices of Latter-day Saints as a direct offense to the attempts to eliminate laws and traditions surrounding concubines.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2016|p=143}} When the church missionaries taught about church's doctrine the to the Japanese, it was often necessary to counter the assumptions the Japanese people had about the church and polygamy. The Japanese translation of the book ''A Brief History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'' included an extra chapter on polygamy in order to provide some clarification that the LDS Church no longer practiced it.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=137}}\n\n==== Translation of the Book of Mormon ====\nThe translation of the [[Book of Mormon]] began in 1904 and went through 1909, taking almost six years. The elders had no working knowledge of Japanese and the reputation of the LDS Church made it difficult for them to find native speakers who were willing to help them with the language. Mission president Horace S. Ensign requested that each missionary use his spare time translating the Book of Mormon into Japanese. Seven months later, the compiled translation was assigned to Alma O. Taylor who worked full-time to complete it. Taylor finished the translation in 1906, after working 21 months. The next 18 months were used to edit, re-read, and correct the Book of Mormon.{{sfn|Britsch|1968|pp=293\u2013300}}\n\nNoguchi Zenshir\u014d, a delegate to the [[Parliament of the World's Religions|World's Parliament of Religions]], and Susuzki Genta recommended to Taylor that the style of the Book of Mormon should be changed from the colloquial ''genbun'itchi'' style to ''bunsh\u014d'', a more elegant written style historically used in literature, records, and official documents.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=139}} [[Ikuta Ch\u014dk\u014d|Ch\u014dk\u014d Ikuta]] changed the style of the translation to ''bunsh\u014d'' and finished in May 1909. Final corrections were made July 24, 1909.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=140}} The first five thousand copies were released October 11, 1909, with special editions made for monarchs and government leaders.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=141}} The task of translating of the Book of Mormon into Japanese was taken with great care. Taylor read his translations about fourteen times, while critics read the translation seven times. They recruited help from some of the best Japanese authors of the time such as [[Tsubouchi Sh\u014dy\u014d]] and [[H\u014dmei Iwano]].{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|pp=139\u2013140}}\n\nA second translation of the Book of Mormon was published in 1957. The translation was made by [[Tatsui Sato (translator)|Tatsui Sato]], who belonged to the first baptized Japanese family after the closure of the mission in 1924.{{sfn|Mori|Harris|2005|pp=53, 141}} The most recent translation of the Book of Mormon was published in 1995 in a colloquial style. This style became more widely used after World War II.{{sfn|Shill|2012}}\n\n=== 1924\u20131945: Closed Japan Mission ===\nFrom 1924 to 1945, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints withdrew its missionaries, leadership, and organizational structure, leaving the Japanese Latter-day Saints on their own. Losing contact with their mother church created a challenge for the remaining Japanese Latter-day Saints: they had no one to lead their congregation.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=285}} Because of the lack of church leadership in Japan, the LDS Church in Japan was maintained by a man named Fujiya Nara. Born May 10, 1898 in Japan, he started attending Sunday School in the Sapporo Branch at age thirteen. He was baptized four years later on July 6, 1915 in the [[Tama River]] in Tokyo by Joseph H. Stimpson, the Japan Mission president at the time. In 1923, he became the first native Japanese to be ordained an [[Elder (LDS Church)|Elder]]. On April 6, 1924, his own wedding to Motoko Yoshimizu was to be the first and last LDS marriage performed in Japan for some time, as the Japan Mission closed down a few months later.{{sfn|Yukiko|1993}} In 1927, Fujiya Nara was appointed presiding elder, similar to a [[branch president]] who leads a small group of church members, by the First Presidency over the small group of Japanese members (137) that remained and restored some priesthood activities. Nara published a newsletter, \"Shuro\" (Palm) and held meetings with the remaining members. After the release of Nara, Fujiwara Takeo was set apart as presiding elder.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=29}} Fujiwara was born in 1905 and was baptized on May 10, 1924, right before the close of the Japan Mission. He was invited to study at Brigham Young University (BYU), where he earned a Master's in history. He spent seven years in Utah, where LDS Church leaders prepared him to become presiding elder.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=292}}\n\nFujiwara focused his work in the Church in Japan on reactivation of baptized Latter Day Saints.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=293}} In the mid-1930s, with World War II imminent, President Grant decided to pursue efforts to work among the Japanese in Hawaii.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=30}} On February 24, 1937, the Japanese-Central Pacific Mission, a mission primarily aimed at teaching Japanese people in Hawaii, was opened and headquartered in [[Honolulu]], Hawaii, with [[Hilton A. Robertson]] as president.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=298}} Following World War II, the period from 1945 to 1951, or the [[Occupation of Japan]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] has been called the \"Christian boom\". With newly declared religious freedom and tough post-war conditions, the Japanese people were more interested in Christianity than they had been for a long time.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|pp=307\u2013308}}\n\n=== 1948\u20131965: Reestablishment of the Japan Mission ===\nIt was not until March 6, 1948, that [[Edward L. Clissold]] was given permission to return to Japan, leading the missionary work as the mission president. Clissold had been part of the United States military occupation forces in Japan after World War II. His new task was to find what remained of the Latter-day Saints from twenty-four years before. He put a small advertisement in Japanese (with a translation error) in the newspaper, \"URGENT NOTICE\u2014I would like any member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Near-Day {{sic}} Saints (Mormon Church) to contact me as soon as possible. Daiichi Hotel, Room 548. Lt. Col. Edward Clissold.\" Nara Fujiya noticed the advertisement, responded, and some Japanese Saints were located and started to take part in Clissold and other servicemen's church activities.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=309}} From 1943 to 1944, Clissold had been acting president of the Central Pacific Mission, a mission in Hawaii that was primarily aimed at teaching Japanese people. His next task was to establish a mission headquarters. He obtained a partially burned mansion which had belonged to the Japanese Minister of Welfare during the war. After renovation of the mission home, the first five missionaries arrived in Japan on June 26, 1948. Harrison Theodore \"Ted\" Price, became the first missionary in 1947. Other missionaries included a Japanese born abroad (''[[nisei]]'') and two American soldiers who had fought the Japanese in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] just years prior.{{sfn|Mori|Harris|2005|p=96}}\n\nAfter Clissold's eighteen-month long presidency, Vinal G. Mauss succeeded him and served from 1949 to 1953. Membership in the church in Japan increased from 211 to more than 800, with the number of districts increasing from one to five, the number of branches grew to twenty-five, and the number of missionaries increased to eighty-four.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=315}} 184 people were baptized in 1950, more than had joined the church in the twenty years that it had been open in the early 1900s. Hilton A. Robertson replaced Mauss as mission president. Robertson was one of the missionaries in the early Japan mission, and had presided over the Japanese-Central Pacific Mission from 1937 to 1940. When Robertson was set apart as president of the Japan Mission, he was told he would also be in charge of presiding over the Chinese Mission.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=318}} He supported Tatsui Sato in re-translating the Book of Mormon as well as translating the Mormon works [[Doctrine and Covenants]] and the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]]. He bought more land for the church to use as chapels and living quarters for missionaries. He strengthened auxiliary organizations such as the [[Young Men (organization)|Young Men]] and [[Young Women (organization)|Young Women]] programs (collectively known as the Mutual Improvement Association, [[Sunday School (LDS Church)|Sunday School]], and [[Relief Society]].{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|pp=319\u2013321}} On July 28, 1955, the Japan Mission was split into the Northern and the Southern Far East Mission.{{sfn|LDS Church News, 2010}} This split created the largest transfer within a mission boundary in the world from [[Naha]], Okinawa, to [[Asahikawa, Hokkaido|Asahigawa, Hokkaid\u014d]].{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=346}}\n\nPaul C. Andrus became the next mission president, serving from 1955 to 1962.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=322}} Membership grew from 1,000 to more than 6,600. The church grew rapidly in Korea, so a separate Korean mission was made, as it had previously been included in the Japan Mission. The number of missionaries grew from 82 to 179. After inventing a new proselytizing plan based on teaching the Bible, bearing testimony, and inviting the investigator to be baptized, baptisms grew from 129 in 1956 to 616 in 1957. Andrus was also instrumental in preparing Japan and Korea for stakes by advancing the priesthood of the members.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|pp=322\u2013323}} He also worked to make other church material like auxiliary manuals and handbooks available in Japanese. The number of branches grew from 26 to 37. One of the most profitable purchases of the church at the time was the purchase of a Yoyogi Street property in Omote Sando, Tokyo, serving as the Central Branch meetinghouse. Eventually, the church sold the building in 1973 for $24,150,943, having originally spent less than $150,000 for it.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|pp=324\u2013326}}\n\nHaving served as a missionary under Mauss, Dwayne N. Anderson became the new mission president in 1962. At the time, there was 7,000 church members in Japan, with the number of missionaries exceeding 180.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=326}} Anderson made large strides in constructing new church buildings and remodeling older ones.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=327}} The number of [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] holders increased significantly. Fundraising was done for members to travel to the [[Hawaii Temple]] to receive [[Temple (LDS Church)|temple]] ordinances. On April 26, 1964, the first meetinghouse in Asia, the Tokyo North Branch, was dedicated by [[Gordon B. Hinckley]], then a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.<ref>{{harvnb|LDS Church News, 2010}}; {{harvnb|LDS Church News, 1964}}</ref> In July 1965, 164 Japanese Latter-day Saints traveled to Hawaii to attend the temple.

Komatsu.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|pp=328\u2013330}}\n\n==== Relief Society ====\nFor much of the early history of the LDS Church in Japan, few church meetings were held. The charity organization called Relief Society began in the early 1950s. In a normal Latter-day Saint church meeting, the Relief Society meetings serves as one hour of the three hour block, where women meet together and are taught lessons about various topics concerning Jesus Christ by another member of the Relief Society who is assigned to teach. Unable to organize an official Relief Society, women would often meet together in sister missionaries' apartments and learn to cook. The women would deliver welfare supplies from the Relief Society in the United States to families with children in Sunday School. In Japan, the members of the Relief Society held bazaars selling cheap goods for low prices to raise money in postwar Japan. The Relief Society worked to help repair missionary clothing and wash missionaries' bedding.{{sfn|Toshiko|2005|pp=148\u2013149}} Eventually, branches formed small, official groups of the Relief Society; however, auxiliary manuals had not yet been translated into Japanese, so Relief Society materials came from sister missionaries. From 1965 to 1966, materials for Christian instruction came in ''Seito-No-Michi'' (a worldwide church magazine), but sometimes no lessons were featured, as only issues October through May contained lesson plans. During the months when the Relief Society didn't have lessons, they had \"work meetings\", creating their own manual to be approved by the Relief Society General Board.{{sfn|Toshiko|2005|p=152}}\n\n=== 1968\u20131980: Church expansion ===\nOn September 1, 1968, Walter Bills was named the new mission president of the Northern Far-East Mission, renamed the Japan Mission. The Southern Far-East Mission was named the Japan-Okinawa Mission and was presided over by Edward Okazaki. Due to the Japan Mission being headquartered in Tokyo, it grew much more quickly than the Japan-Okinawa Mission. Bills opened three new branches and nine cities for proselytizing and instituted the Book of Mormon placement program, stating that the Book of Mormon would lead to conversion. In 1969, Japanese missionaries carried more copies of the Book of Mormon, distributing over 208,000 books. Bills attributed at least 60% of the baptisms during his presidency to the program. Bills also focused on training people to run [[stake (LDS Church)|stakes]], the administrative units of the LDS Church. In this way, he was preparing for a stake in Tokyo. All auxiliaries were established in Japan at this time, including the Primary, the children's organization. Okazaki was the second mission president of Japanese ancestry. At the end of Bill's service in 1971, baptisms were up to one baptism per missionary per month, which was about 200 baptisms total.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=346-348}}\n\nIn 1969, a language-training center for Japanese and other Asian and African languages was established at [[Brigham Young University\u2013Hawaii|BYU-Hawaii]]. Future missionaries assigned to Japan were sent to Hawaii for two months where they learned the language, as well as working to learn about the Japanese people, food and culture.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|pp=349\u2013350}} Within the same week, the church opened a display at [[Expo '70]] in Osaka, featuring a new version of the LDS film ''[[Man's Search for Happiness]]'' created specially for this event.{{sfn|Deseret News, 1970a|pp=B1-B2}} BYU's [[Young Ambassadors]] also performed at the expo.{{sfn|Deseret News, 1970b|p=B5}} The church received a lot of attention due to the World Fair.

Even though the period after WWII had been characterized by a \"de-deification\" of the emperor,{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=7}} after the death of Emperor Hirohito, his death rituals were widely publicized. This reignited an interest in old Japanese symbols, rites, and rituals.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=9}} Due to deeply rooted religious and cultural belief systems that have lasted for centuries, converting to another religion was associated with becoming non-Japanese.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=10}} The second event that created challenges for LDS missionaries in Japan was the [[Tokyo subway sarin attack]] by Aum Shinriky\u014d. This attack, which killed twelve and injured more than five thousand people, greatly affected the Japanese people. It caused fear of and a resentment to [[Japanese New Religions]] and the Japanese people had a hard time distinguishing between proselytizing LDS missionaries and New Religions.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=176}}\n\n=== Cultural obstacles ===\n[[File:The Plan of Salvation japanese.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|Plan of salvation]] in [[Japanese language]].]]\nJapan is culturally and historically a non-Christian nation. This poses problems in LDS missionary work, because the Japanese are culturally not familiar with the western notion of God. However, despite the Japanese unfamiliarity with Christian or Western religiosity, the Japanese are a religious people. Many Japanese people state to be a part of one or more religion, mostly Shinto and Buddhism and these religions affect their world view deeply. Thus, the cultural differences in ethics and morality challenge missionary work.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoffman|2007|pp=99\u2013101}}; {{harvnb|Josephson|2012}}</ref>\n\nAnother cultural difference is the impact of [[Confucian]] ethics. Western culture puts emphasis on the individual, while Japanese culture values the group over the individual. The Japanese culture values harmony over individual ambition and aggressiveness. Large decisions are often made together. For example, a Japanese person may be more willing to be baptized if their family joined them in their decision. If not, they will likely not choose to be baptized, in order to avoid isolation from their family. Mormonism emphasizes individual agency and the individual's relationship with Jesus Christ, values which make Mormon baptism in Japan less likely.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|pp=190\u2013191}}\n\nSeveral scholars have pointed out that little study has been made of the internal factors that have limited the success of the LDS missions in Japan.

Among them was [[Heber J. Grant]], who was then a member of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve]] and later became the church's [[List of presidents of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|7th]] [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|president]]. Horace S. Ensign, Louis A. Kelsch and Alma O. Taylor accompanied Grant. The LDS Church's first baptism in Japan was on March 8, 1902, when Grant baptized Hajime Nakazawa, a former [[Kannushi]] ([[Shinto]] priest). The [[Book of Mormon]] was translated three times. The first translation, which took over six years, was completed by Taylor in 1909. It was then recommended that the Book of Mormon be translated into ''bunsh\u014d'', a more elegant literary style, which was done by Ch\u014dk\u014d Ikuta in 1909, shortly before it was published and distributed. The second translation in 1957 was done by Tatsui Sato. In 1995, the Book of Mormon was translated again into a more colloquial style.\n\nMissionary work from the opening of the Japan [[Mission (LDS Church)|Mission]] through 1924 was challenging due to language barriers and cultural differences, as well as the [[1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake|1923 Tokyo earthquake]] and the [[Immigration Act of 1924]]. Few baptisms were performed during this time period. Due to these difficulties, the Japan Mission was closed from 1924 to 1945, until after the end of [[World War II]]. During the twenty years missionary work was halted in Japan, the work was moved to Hawaii in order to reach Japanese people living there. A small number of [[Latter-day Saints]] in Japan met together privately in their homes from 1924 to 1945, under the leadership of Fujiya Nara and later Fujiwara Takeo.\n\nThe mission was reopened in 1948 with [[Edward L. Clissold]] as [[mission president|president]]. Missionary work flourished after 1948 with the number of baptisms increasing, requiring new missions to be opened. The LDS Church decided to open the Mormon Pavilion during the [[Expo '70]] in Osaka. After the Expo, baptisms doubled from 1969 to 1970. Two days after the Expo finished, the church's first [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stake]] in Japan was established in Tokyo in 1970. The [[Tokyo Japan Temple]], the first temple in Japan and in Asia, was [[dedication|dedicated]] in 1980.\n\nAs of 2018, the LDS Church reported 129,335 members, 7 missions, and 3 temples in Japan.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== 1901\u20131924: Establishment of the Japan Mission ===\n==== Missionary efforts ====\n[[Walter M. Gibson]], sent by [[Brigham Young]], attempted to send missionaries to the Pacific in 1861, but stopped his mission in Hawaii.{{sfn|Andrade|1996|p=11}} He wrote a book of strict instructions for a morally and physically clean life that the Hawaiian people should follow, called the \"Sanitary Instructions\".{{sfn|Gibson|1881}} He was excommunicated from the church in 1864 for selling church offices to islanders and using the money to buy large amounts of land on Lanai.{{sfn|Adler|Kamins|1984|p=96}} In 1895, the Japanese Consul in San Francisco asked [[Abraham H. Cannon]] if there were plans to open up a mission in Japan. However, he died before the mission could be established. Then in 1901, the church's [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] announced the opening of the Japan Mission.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=24}}\n\nHeber J. Grant, of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and later the church's 7th president, was assigned to establish the first LDS Church mission in [[Asia]], headquartered in [[Tokyo]].<ref>{{harvnb|Grant|2002}}; {{harvnb|Hinckley|1964|p=168}}</ref> The [[Panic of 1893]] caused him to go into a lot of debt, so at the time, he was in serious financial distress.{{sfn|Walker|1986|p=24}} The First Presidency allowed him one year to get out of debt, which he did in the allotted time.{{sfn|Walker|1986|p=24}}\n\nGrant handpicked the first three missionaries to serve with him in Japan: Horace S. Ensign, Louis A. Kelsch, and Alma O. Taylor. They became known as the \"Japanese Quartet\".{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|pp=24\u201325}} They arrived in Japan on August 12, 1901. Despite their arrival, the missionaries did not yet have permission from the government to proselyte, so they spent their time learning the language. After lobbying with the chief of police, the missionaries received permission to preach in early October.{{sfn|Britsch|1968|pp=214\u2013222}} The missionaries, particularly Grant, had great difficulties learning the language.{{sfn|Britsch|1968|p=225}} The missionaries met Takahashi Gor\u014d, who had previously published a defense of the Mormons in the periodical ''The Sun''. Takahashi spoke good English and had a knowledge of other languages. He decided to help Grant by writing a book that would introduce the mission of the Latter-day Saints to the Japanese people.{{sfn|Britsch|1968|pp=238\u2013241}} Nakazawa Hajime became the first baptized member in Japan.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=25}} Nakazawa soon began asking Grant for money to start a new business, and because the LDS Church is prohibited in loaning members money to start businesses, Grant refused. Nakazawa was caught robbing the mission house and was excommunicated from the church and arrested. After the arrest of Nakazawa, Takahashi no longer supported the missionaries, describing Grant as cruel and \"cold-blooded\" for refusing to pay Nazakawa.{{sfn|Brady|1983|p=170}}\n\nFrom 1902 to 1924, eighty-eight missionaries proselyted in twenty-nine locations, laboring largely in Tokyo, [[Sapporo]], and [[Osaka]], performing 166 baptisms.{{sfn|Britsch|1992|p=77}} However, on August 7, 1924, Grant, then president of the church, closed the mission to await a more favorable time, due to the low number of baptisms.<ref>{{harvnb|Britsch|1975|pp=171\u2013190}}; {{harvnb|Neilson|Gessel|2006|pp=229}}</ref>\n\nSeveral issues contributed to the low number of baptisms. Ongoing problems in the mission included the difficulty of the language, as well as cultural differences. Also, the small number of missionaries and their extended service caused fatigue among them and hardships for their loved ones. There were also external problems: the earthquake in Tokyo in 1923 stalled proselytizing, the United States' [[Immigration Act of 1924]] caused racial tensions between Japan and the United States. Finally, the general sense of defeatism of the missionaries in Japan and Church leaders in Salt Lake City influenced the decision to close the mission in Japan.<ref>{{harvnb|Britsch|1975|pp=1\u201313}}; {{harvnb|Hoffman|2007|pp=28\u201329}}</ref> Nevertheless, even though they did not baptize many members, they translated the [[Book of Mormon]] into Japanese. They also wrote a Japanese hymnbook, a history of the Church, a biography of [[Joseph Smith]], and other literature. Missionaries, as well as the Church in general, gained experience that would make the reestablishment of the mission in 1948 more successful.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=230}}\n\n==== First Japanese church members ====\nThe first baptized Japanese member was Hajime Nakazawa, a former [[Shinto]] priest. He was baptized on March 8, 1902, on the shore of [[\u014cmori, \u014cta, Tokyo|Omori]] in [[Tokyo Bay]].{{sfn|Takagi|2000|p=73}} Although he was the first baptized member, he was not the first active member of the LDS Church. After he was baptized, he and his wife asked the missionaries for a significant amount of money. The missionaries refused and he was later caught attempting to rob the missionaries' home, possibly indicating that he only agreed to get baptized in hopes of obtaining money from the church. He was then excommunicated and subsequently arrested.{{sfn|Britsch|1968|pp=240\u2013269}}\n\nOne of the most prominent first Japanese church members was Tomizo Katsunuma, a veterinarian and immigration inspector in Honolulu, honored as the \"Father of Immigrants\". He is notable as one of the first members of LDS Church with Japanese ancestry.{{sfn|Takagi|2000|p=74}} He moved to the United States during the emigration fever.{{sfn|Takagi|2000|p=74}} He had many contacts with LDS Church members in Logan, Utah, which influenced his decision to get baptized on August 8, 1895. After his death, the headline of the obituary read \"Dr. Katsunuma, first Japanese Mormon, dies.\"{{sfn|Takagi|2000|pp=83\u201384}}\n\nTokujiro Sato was another one of the church's first Japanese converts. Tokujiro immigrated to Hawaii from Japan. Tukujiro supposedly joined the church in 1892, though because of the lack of records, it is unclear when he was baptized or whether he was baptized at all. He was listed in membership records in the Waipio [[Branch (LDS Church)|Branch]], but there is no baptism record. However, the baptisms of his children were recorded and, despite the lack of records, Taokujiro attended the LDS Church throughout his life.{{sfn|Takagi|2000|pp=94\u201395}}\n\n==== Portrayal of the church in Japan ====\nOther Christian churches often preached against the LDS Church, criticizing its doctrines, yet admitting the strange propensity it seemed to have in attracting followers. The doctrine of the church, and polygamy in particular, was seen as a threat to Japanese culture and the Meiji society's ideals of civilization. Even though the Japanese people heard about the church through the [[Iwakura Mission]] to the United States in 1872, the earliest official printed introduction of the Japanese people to the LDS Church was likely the 1879 Japanese translation of [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[Around the World in 80 Days]]''. [[Jean Passepartout]], a character in the book, heard a lecture on Mormonism and polygamy which disturbed him. Magazine articles helped to spread the knowledge of the church in Japan, however, the articles focused on polygamy and its dangers to women and society in an increasingly Westernizing country.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|pp=128\u2013129}} Some Japanese saw the polygamous practices of Latter-day Saints as a direct offense to the attempts to eliminate laws and traditions surrounding concubines.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2016|p=143}} When the church missionaries taught about church's doctrine the to the Japanese, it was often necessary to counter the assumptions the Japanese people had about the church and polygamy. The Japanese translation of the book ''A Brief History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'' included an extra chapter on polygamy in order to provide some clarification that the LDS Church no longer practiced it.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=137}}\n\n==== Translation of the Book of Mormon ====\nThe translation of the [[Book of Mormon]] began in 1904 and went through 1909, taking almost six years. The elders had no working knowledge of Japanese and the reputation of the LDS Church made it difficult for them to find native speakers who were willing to help them with the language. Mission president Horace S. Ensign requested that each missionary use his spare time translating the Book of Mormon into Japanese. Seven months later, the compiled translation was assigned to Alma O. Taylor who worked full-time to complete it. Taylor finished the translation in 1906, after working 21 months. The next 18 months were used to edit, re-read, and correct the Book of Mormon.{{sfn|Britsch|1968|pp=293\u2013300}}\n\nNoguchi Zenshir\u014d, a delegate to the [[Parliament of the World's Religions|World's Parliament of Religions]], and Susuzki Genta recommended to Taylor that the style of the Book of Mormon should be changed from the colloquial ''genbun'itchi'' style to ''bunsh\u014d'', a more elegant written style historically used in literature, records, and official documents.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=139}} [[Ikuta Ch\u014dk\u014d|Ch\u014dk\u014d Ikuta]] changed the style of the translation to ''bunsh\u014d'' and finished in May 1909. Final corrections were made July 24, 1909.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=140}} The first five thousand copies were released October 11, 1909, with special editions made for monarchs and government leaders.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=141}} The task of translating of the Book of Mormon into Japanese was taken with great care. Taylor read his translations about fourteen times, while critics read the translation seven times. They recruited help from some of the best Japanese authors of the time such as [[Tsubouchi Sh\u014dy\u014d]] and [[H\u014dmei Iwano]].{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|pp=139\u2013140}}\n\nA second translation of the Book of Mormon was published in 1957. The translation was made by [[Tatsui Sato (translator)|Tatsui Sato]], who belonged to the first baptized Japanese family after the closure of the mission in 1924.{{sfn|Mori|Harris|2005|pp=53, 141}} The most recent translation of the Book of Mormon was published in 1995 in a colloquial style. This style became more widely used after World War II.{{sfn|Shill|2012}}\n\n=== 1924\u20131945: Closed Japan Mission ===\nFrom 1924 to 1945, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints withdrew its missionaries, leadership, and organizational structure, leaving the Japanese Latter-day Saints on their own. Losing contact with their mother church created a challenge for the remaining Japanese Latter-day Saints: they had no one to lead their congregation.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=285}} Because of the lack of church leadership in Japan, the LDS Church in Japan was maintained by a man named Fujiya Nara. Born May 10, 1898 in Japan, he started attending Sunday School in the Sapporo Branch at age thirteen. He was baptized four years later on July 6, 1915 in the [[Tama River]] in Tokyo by Joseph H. Stimpson, the Japan Mission president at the time. In 1923, he became the first native Japanese to be ordained an [[Elder (LDS Church)|Elder]]. On April 6, 1924, his own wedding to Motoko Yoshimizu was to be the first and last LDS marriage performed in Japan for some time, as the Japan Mission closed down a few months later.{{sfn|Yukiko|1993}} In 1927, Fujiya Nara was appointed presiding elder, similar to a [[branch president]] who leads a small group of church members, by the First Presidency over the small group of Japanese members (137) that remained and restored some priesthood activities. Nara published a newsletter, \"Shuro\" (Palm) and held meetings with the remaining members. After the release of Nara, Fujiwara Takeo was set apart as presiding elder.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=29}} Fujiwara was born in 1905 and was baptized on May 10, 1924, right before the close of the Japan Mission. He was invited to study at Brigham Young University (BYU), where he earned a Master's in history. He spent seven years in Utah, where LDS Church leaders prepared him to become presiding elder.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=292}}\n\nFujiwara focused his work in the Church in Japan on reactivation of baptized Latter Day Saints.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=293}} In the mid-1930s, with World War II imminent, President Grant decided to pursue efforts to work among the Japanese in Hawaii.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=30}} On February 24, 1937, the Japanese-Central Pacific Mission, a mission primarily aimed at teaching Japanese people in Hawaii, was opened and headquartered in [[Honolulu]], Hawaii, with [[Hilton A. Robertson]] as president.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=298}} Following World War II, the period from 1945 to 1951, or the [[Occupation of Japan]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] has been called the \"Christian boom\". With newly declared religious freedom and tough post-war conditions, the Japanese people were more interested in Christianity than they had been for a long time.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|pp=307\u2013308}}\n\n=== 1948\u20131965: Reestablishment of the Japan Mission ===\nIt was not until March 6, 1948, that [[Edward L. Clissold]] was given permission to return to Japan, leading the missionary work as the mission president. Clissold had been part of the United States military occupation forces in Japan after World War II. His new task was to find what remained of the Latter-day Saints from twenty-four years before. He put a small advertisement in Japanese (with a translation error) in the newspaper, \"URGENT NOTICE\u2014I would like any member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Near-Day {{sic}} Saints (Mormon Church) to contact me as soon as possible. Daiichi Hotel, Room 548. Lt. Col. Edward Clissold.\" Nara Fujiya noticed the advertisement, responded, and some Japanese Saints were located and started to take part in Clissold and other servicemen's church activities.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=309}} From 1943 to 1944, Clissold had been acting president of the Central Pacific Mission, a mission in Hawaii that was primarily aimed at teaching Japanese people. His next task was to establish a mission headquarters. He obtained a partially burned mansion which had belonged to the Japanese Minister of Welfare during the war. After renovation of the mission home, the first five missionaries arrived in Japan on June 26, 1948. Harrison Theodore \"Ted\" Price, became the first missionary in 1947. Other missionaries included a Japanese born abroad (''[[nisei]]'') and two American soldiers who had fought the Japanese in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] just years prior.{{sfn|Mori|Harris|2005|p=96}}\n\nAfter Clissold's eighteen-month long presidency, Vinal G. Mauss succeeded him and served from 1949 to 1953. Membership in the church in Japan increased from 211 to more than 800, with the number of districts increasing from one to five, the number of branches grew to twenty-five, and the number of missionaries increased to eighty-four.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=315}} 184 people were baptized in 1950, more than had joined the church in the twenty years that it had been open in the early 1900s. Hilton A. Robertson replaced Mauss as mission president. Robertson was one of the missionaries in the early Japan mission, and had presided over the Japanese-Central Pacific Mission from 1937 to 1940. When Robertson was set apart as president of the Japan Mission, he was told he would also be in charge of presiding over the Chinese Mission.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=318}} He supported Tatsui Sato in re-translating the Book of Mormon as well as translating the Mormon works [[Doctrine and Covenants]] and the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]]. He bought more land for the church to use as chapels and living quarters for missionaries. He strengthened auxiliary organizations such as the [[Young Men (organization)|Young Men]] and [[Young Women (organization)|Young Women]] programs (collectively known as the Mutual Improvement Association, [[Sunday School (LDS Church)|Sunday School]], and [[Relief Society]].{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|pp=319\u2013321}} On July 28, 1955, the Japan Mission was split into the Northern and the Southern Far East Mission.{{sfn|LDS Church News, 2010}} This split created the largest transfer within a mission boundary in the world from [[Naha]], Okinawa, to [[Asahikawa, Hokkaido|Asahigawa, Hokkaid\u014d]].{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=346}}\n\nPaul C. Andrus became the next mission president, serving from 1955 to 1962.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=322}} Membership grew from 1,000 to more than 6,600. The church grew rapidly in Korea, so a separate Korean mission was made, as it had previously been included in the Japan Mission. The number of missionaries grew from 82 to 179. After inventing a new proselytizing plan based on teaching the Bible, bearing testimony, and inviting the investigator to be baptized, baptisms grew from 129 in 1956 to 616 in 1957. Andrus was also instrumental in preparing Japan and Korea for stakes by advancing the priesthood of the members.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|pp=322\u2013323}} He also worked to make other church material like auxiliary manuals and handbooks available in Japanese. The number of branches grew from 26 to 37. One of the most profitable purchases of the church at the time was the purchase of a Yoyogi Street property in Omote Sando, Tokyo, serving as the Central Branch meetinghouse. Eventually, the church sold the building in 1973 for $24,150,943, having originally spent less than $150,000 for it.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|pp=324\u2013326}}\n\nHaving served as a missionary under Mauss, Dwayne N. Anderson became the new mission president in 1962. At the time, there was 7,000 church members in Japan, with the number of missionaries exceeding 180.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=326}} Anderson made large strides in constructing new church buildings and remodeling older ones.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=327}} The number of [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] holders increased significantly. Fundraising was done for members to travel to the [[Hawaii Temple]] to receive [[Temple (LDS Church)|temple]] ordinances. On April 26, 1964, the first meetinghouse in Asia, the Tokyo North Branch, was dedicated by [[Gordon B. Hinckley]], then a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.<ref>{{harvnb|LDS Church News, 2010}}; {{harvnb|LDS Church News, 1964}}</ref> In July 1965, 164 Japanese Latter-day Saints traveled to Hawaii to attend the temple. Trips such as these occurred almost yearly until the [[Tokyo Temple]] was built in 1980. In 1965, Anderson was succeeded by Adney Y. Komatsu.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|pp=328\u2013330}}\n\n==== Relief Society ====\nFor much of the early history of the LDS Church in Japan, few church meetings were held. The charity organization called Relief Society began in the early 1950s. In a normal Latter-day Saint church meeting, the Relief Society meetings serves as one hour of the three hour block, where women meet together and are taught lessons about various topics concerning Jesus Christ by another member of the Relief Society who is assigned to teach. Unable to organize an official Relief Society, women would often meet together in sister missionaries' apartments and learn to cook. The women would deliver welfare supplies from the Relief Society in the United States to families with children in Sunday School. In Japan, the members of the Relief Society held bazaars selling cheap goods for low prices to raise money in postwar Japan. The Relief Society worked to help repair missionary clothing and wash missionaries' bedding.{{sfn|Toshiko|2005|pp=148\u2013149}} Eventually, branches formed small, official groups of the Relief Society; however, auxiliary manuals had not yet been translated into Japanese, so Relief Society materials came from sister missionaries. From 1965 to 1966, materials for Christian instruction came in ''Seito-No-Michi'' (a worldwide church magazine), but sometimes no lessons were featured, as only issues October through May contained lesson plans. During the months when the Relief Society didn't have lessons, they had \"work meetings\", creating their own manual to be approved by the Relief Society General Board.{{sfn|Toshiko|2005|p=152}}\n\n=== 1968\u20131980: Church expansion ===\nOn September 1, 1968, Walter Bills was named the new mission president of the Northern Far-East Mission, renamed the Japan Mission. The Southern Far-East Mission was named the Japan-Okinawa Mission and was presided over by Edward Okazaki. Due to the Japan Mission being headquartered in Tokyo, it grew much more quickly than the Japan-Okinawa Mission. Bills opened three new branches and nine cities for proselytizing and instituted the Book of Mormon placement program, stating that the Book of Mormon would lead to conversion. In 1969, Japanese missionaries carried more copies of the Book of Mormon, distributing over 208,000 books. Bills attributed at least 60% of the baptisms during his presidency to the program. Bills also focused on training people to run [[stake (LDS Church)|stakes]], the administrative units of the LDS Church. In this way, he was preparing for a stake in Tokyo. All auxiliaries were established in Japan at this time, including the Primary, the children's organization. Okazaki was the second mission president of Japanese ancestry. At the end of Bill's service in 1971, baptisms were up to one baptism per missionary per month, which was about 200 baptisms total.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=346-348}}\n\nIn 1969, a language-training center for Japanese and other Asian and African languages was established at [[Brigham Young University\u2013Hawaii|BYU-Hawaii]]. Future missionaries assigned to Japan were sent to Hawaii for two months where they learned the language, as well as working to learn about the Japanese people, food and culture.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|pp=349\u2013350}} Within the same week, the church opened a display at [[Expo '70]] in Osaka, featuring a new version of the LDS film ''[[Man's Search for Happiness]]'' created specially for this event.{{sfn|Deseret News, 1970a|pp=B1-B2}} BYU's [[Young Ambassadors]] also performed at the expo.{{sfn|Deseret News, 1970b|p=B5}} The church received a lot of attention due to the World Fair. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was the only Christian denomination to have its own pavilion at the fair.{{sfn|Desert Sun|1970}} Ten percent (6,658,532) of the guests who attended the Expo visited the Mormon Pavilion, which was a temporary display that introduced the people of Japan to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|pp=350\u2013351}} Fifty thousand copies of the Book of Mormon were distributed and there were 779 baptisms in Japan in 1970, double that of 1969.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|pp=350\u2013351}} The Tokyo Stake was the church's first stake in Asia.

The Japan Mission became the Japan East Mission and the Japan-Okinawa Mission. The Japan-Okinawa Mission became the Japan Central Mission and the Japan West Mission. Two new mission presidents were introduced, while Bills and Okazaki retained their positions over their respective missions. Russell Horiuchi, a professor at BYU, became president of the Japan East Mission. Watanabe Kan became president of the Japan West Mission and became the first native Japanese mission president.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=352}} In 1965, Adney Y.

Retrieved on 3 April 2020.</ref>\n\n== Recent problems ==\nTwo events that created challenges to Latter-day Saint missionary work in Japan were the death of [[Hirohito|Emperor Hirohito]] in 1989 and the Tokyo subway attack in 1995 by the religious group [[Aum Shinrikyo|Aum Shinriky\u014d]].{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=7}} The death of the emperor made Japanese citizens reevaluate the role of the emperor in the state and in their lives. Even though the period after WWII had been characterized by a \"de-deification\" of the emperor,{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=7}} after the death of Emperor Hirohito, his death rituals were widely publicized. This reignited an interest in old Japanese symbols, rites, and rituals.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=9}} Due to deeply rooted religious and cultural belief systems that have lasted for centuries, converting to another religion was associated with becoming non-Japanese.{{sfn|Neilson|Gessel|2006|p=10}} The second event that created challenges for LDS missionaries in Japan was the [[Tokyo subway sarin attack]] by Aum Shinriky\u014d. This attack, which killed twelve and injured more than five thousand people, greatly affected the Japanese people. It caused fear of and a resentment to [[Japanese New Religions]] and the Japanese people had a hard time distinguishing between proselytizing LDS missionaries and New Religions.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=176}}\n\n=== Cultural obstacles ===\n[[File:The Plan of Salvation japanese.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|Plan of salvation]] in [[Japanese language]].]]\nJapan is culturally and historically a non-Christian nation. This poses problems in LDS missionary work, because the Japanese are culturally not familiar with the western notion of God. However, despite the Japanese unfamiliarity with Christian or Western religiosity, the Japanese are a religious people. Many Japanese people state to be a part of one or more religion, mostly Shinto and Buddhism and these religions affect their world view deeply. Thus, the cultural differences in ethics and morality challenge missionary work.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoffman|2007|pp=99\u2013101}}; {{harvnb|Josephson|2012}}</ref>\n\nAnother cultural difference is the impact of [[Confucian]] ethics. Western culture puts emphasis on the individual, while Japanese culture values the group over the individual. The Japanese culture values harmony over individual ambition and aggressiveness. Large decisions are often made together. For example, a Japanese person may be more willing to be baptized if their family joined them in their decision. If not, they will likely not choose to be baptized, in order to avoid isolation from their family. Mormonism emphasizes individual agency and the individual's relationship with Jesus Christ, values which make Mormon baptism in Japan less likely.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|pp=190\u2013191}}\n\nSeveral scholars have pointed out that little study has been made of the internal factors that have limited the success of the LDS missions in Japan.
