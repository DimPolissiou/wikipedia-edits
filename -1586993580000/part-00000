In 1862 the [[Hull Corporation]] established a cemetery adjacent, now known as '''Western Cemetery''', and in {{circa|1890}} expanded the cemetery west across Chanterlands Avenue onto an adjacent site.\n\nThe General Cemetery contains several notable monument and burials, including a monument to a [[cholera]] outbreak in 1849, as well as the graves of many notable persons of the [[Victoria era]] and early 20th&nbsp;century of Kingston upon Hull. The General Cemetery closed in 1972, the Western Cemetery is, as of 2018, still in use.\n\nIn 2018 a community group of volunteers, [https://friendsofhullgeneralcemetery.com The Friends of Hull General Cemetery], was formed and have taken on the challenge of caring for this heritage site of special natural interest.\u00a0 The group was formed as a subcommittee of the Hull Civic Society. It meets regularly at the Avenues Centre, Park Avenue, Hull. During its short life it has generated a significant amount of interest in the cemetery from the general public and plans are afoot to bid for local and national funding to make the cemetery a more hospitable place for the community to visit yet still retain its historical significance and environmental importance for future generations.  \n\nIn 2018  a short introduction to the Hull General Cemetery 1847 \u2013 1972, was published by Pete Lowden and Bill Longbone<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pete Lowden and Bill Longbone|first=|title=Hull General Cemetery 1847 \u2013 1972, A Short Introduction|publisher=Independently published (9 Sept. 2018)|year=2018|isbn=1720182663|location=|pages=}}</ref>  \n\n==History==\n\n===Hull General Cemetery===\n[[File:Entrance to the Spring Bank Cemetery, showing the Botanic Gardens Level Crossing, 1889.jpg|thumb|left|Main cemetery entrance and railway level crossing, view from Spring Bank ({{circa|1889}}, F.S.

Eventually, after questions asked in Parliament the site was sold to Hull City Council for a nominal sum of \u00a31 in 1974. At the time the local press was calling the site an \u2018eyesore\u2019 and demanding that it was cleaned up. What the aims of the council were when it acquired the land initially is open to question and it could be argued the local authority was reacting to events rather than having a strategic goal for the site.\n\nHowever, within a short space of time the local authority made clear that the cemetery should be re-developed. There had been earlier demonstrations of cemetery \u2018re-development\u2019 in the city when Trippet Street, Division Road and the Drypool graveyards in the early 1960s and 70\u2019s suffered this process. Redevelopment in this sense meant that the vast majority of headstones would be removed and the cemetery landscaped. This took the form of harrowing and grass seeding the ground so that it could be mown.\n\nPublic opposition to this plan for Hull General Cemetery, including such names as Philip Larkin and John Betjeman, was overruled and the wholesale destruction of irreparable historical artefacts took place. The whole process took about 18 months. However, because of Hull General Cemetery\u2019s conspicuous role in Victorian Hull, a number of headstones, principally of more notable members of the public, were allowed to remain. Also, as an indication of how \u2018bad\u2019 the cemetery had become until the council stepped in, a number of rows of headstones were left in situ. These are the rows next to and surrounding the Quaker plot. By 1979 the site had been \u2018developed\u2019.\n\nAt first the council maintained the grounds. Grass cutting took place on a regular basis and paths were re-laid every year with sand and gravel. The council maintained the trees. The cemetery resembled a park with headstones dotted around. Children played there, families picnicked and dogs were walked. Apart from the headstones, the cemetery may well have been, to a casual observer, either West Park or Pearson Park.\n\nUnfortunately, over time, with the council suffering significant funding cuts, the maintenance of the cemetery fell by the wayside and it began to acquire a neglected feel. The dumping of rubbish began to happen more regularly, paths became quagmires; sycamore saplings began to destroy the remaining stones whilst ivy swamped them. The entire cemetery was quickly becoming a place to avoid rather than to visit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://friendsofhullgeneralcemetery.com/history/introduction/4/|title=Introduction to the history of Hull General Cemetery|last=|first=|date=|website=The Friends of Hull General Cemetery|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWith the formation of the Friends of Hull General Cemetery in 2018 unpaid volunteers began to address the neglect of the Cemetery and thoughtfully, carefully and sensitively began to reclaim the cemetery and began encouraging the diversity of flora and wildlife and also to encourage local residents to enjoy the diversity the Cemetery has to offer. As a result the Hull General Cemetery woke from it's slumber in 2018 and started to come alive and the undesirables left to leave it an oasis of tranquility almost in the very heart of the city. The hard work of the Friends of Hull General Cemetery has brought enjoyment and relaxation to so many people ... many of whom have lived near to but avoided the cemetery because of the what it had deterioted to but now look at it with loving eyes. Wildlife has started to return to the cemetery and The Friends of Hull General Cemetery are mindful to of the need to strike a balance between the needs of the flauna and fauna and also the needs of the public to enjoy been able to escape an inner city envrionment and step into an 'ancient' woodland.\n\n''To this end the original objectives of Friends of Hull General Cemetery (to be achieved by working in close consultation with the land owners, Hull City Council) are as follows\u2026''\n\n* Landscape and Woodland Management: To employ sustainable, multi-objective woodland management to preserve and improve the important function of the mature, broadleaved woodland on the site in the urban landscape.\n* Social History: To conserve the burial monuments and associated features in their woodland setting and to encourage their interpretation and appreciation.\n* Education: To encourage the educational use of the area, including its use as a local nature-site and its use to engage the local community in the Hull Biodiversity Action Plan process.\n* Access, Recreation and Inclusion: To ensure that the open, public-access to the site is maintained, that it is safe and welcoming to everyone and wherein the formal path network is well managed and accessible to all.\n* Biodiversity: To conserve and enhance the flora and fauna at the site, their habitats and diversity, including protected species.\n* Community Involvement: To enable the engagement of the local community in the active management of the site.\n* Safety and Public Amenity: To ensure the site is maintained in a safe condition and manner.\n* Implementation, Funding and Partnerships: To set out a programme of implementation for the practical and administrative management of the proposed project which identifies responsibilities, costs and potential means of funding the management of the site, including possible community and voluntary sector partners to work with the City Council. Community involvement will be central to the development and implementation of the plan.\n* Involvement of local businesses: To provide assistance, both financial and practical help with tools, equipment and materials.\n* CWGC: Identify, locate and record all Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) graves within the cemetery.\n* Photographic Record Project: Record all of the remaining headstones in the cemetery.\n* Litter: Remove litter and fly-tipped material and provide litter bins throughout the cemetery which will be regularly emptied by the volunteers.\n* Ivy: Remove ivy and invasive plants from around headstones to prevent damage by same. Care to be taken not to damage stones or interfere with nesting birds.\n* Pathways: Tidy and re-establish cemetery pathways, and maintain where possible.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://friendsofhullgeneralcemetery.com/about-us/objectives/|title=The objectives of 'The Friends of Hull General Cemetery'|last=|first=|date=|website=Friends of Hull General Cemetery|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Conclusion ===\nHull General Cemetery is one of the greatest historical resources that the city of Hull has. That it has been abused, neglected and damaged by its custodians is not in doubt but it still breathes charm and exudes magic. Walking there, within 100 yards of a major thoroughfare, one can forget the modern world.\n\nThe ''Friends of Hull General Cemetery'' are actively working to create an oasis for the community in the heart of the city. The ''Friends of Hull General Cemetery'' Facebook group<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/friendsofhullgeneralcemetery/|title=The Friends of Hull General Cemetery|last=|first=|date=|website=Facebook : The Friends of Hull General Cemetery|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> was formed to promote and celebrate the unique historical and environmental attributes of the cemetery. It is the \u2018Friends\u2019 intention to try and turn this long-overgrown and disused burial ground into a place which can once more be enjoyed by all in the local neighbourhood. The 'Friends' hope to achieve this over time by clearing-up the graves and headstones, by encouraging the diversity of flora and wildlife, by promoting historical research, and most importantly of all by getting and keeping local people and organisations involved in its upkeep.\n\nThe goals of the 'Friends' could never be achievable without the marvelous input of time, energy and ideas by its members and volunteers who throughout the years (and whatever the weather) make themselves available to help in the upkeep and ongoing improvements of the cemetery and its overall environment.\n\n====Notable graves and monuments ====\n[[File:Life after death - geograph.org.uk - 683617.jpg|thumb|upright|Plain graves in the Quaker burial section of the General Cemetery (2008)]]\n*Monument to the victims of the 1849 cholera epidemic, erected through private contributions.

It meets regularly at the Avenues Centre, Park Ave, Hull.  \n\n==History==\n\n===Hull General Cemetery===\n[[File:Entrance to the Spring Bank Cemetery, showing the Botanic Gardens Level Crossing, 1889.jpg|thumb|left|Main cemetery entrance and railway level crossing, view from Spring Bank ({{circa|1889}}, F.S.

It expanded to 3/8 mile (still dirt) in August 1969, operating through 1971. \n\nIt was expanded again to 1/2 mile in February 1972. Dick Murphy bought the racetrack in 1982, and paved it in 1989. Murphy sold it in 1992, and re-purchased it in 1997, when it was converted back to dirt.<ref>[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1998-02-05/sports/9802050474_1_volusia-speedway-park-dirt-track-asphalt-track Track's Altered State] - [[Juliet Macur]], Orlando Sentinel, 5 February 1998</ref>\n\nThe [[NASCAR Southeast Series]] had ran 9 races in the complex between 1991 and 1998, the first 8 events were in the 1/2 mile paved track. The last event, in 1998 was in the 3/8 mile recently paved oval but since it was converted back into dirt for 1999, the track was removed from Southeast schedule.\n\nThe 3/8 mile dirt oval opened behind turn 4 of the original oval, operating from 1993 until it was paved in 1998 for a [[NASCAR Southeast Series]] event, but in 1999 it was converted back into dirt. In late 2004 the former paved surface was torn up and removed and the karting track that was located inside of the asphalt track was redesigned and took over all of the former track.\n\nThe 1/5 mile dirt karting track complex is known as Volusia Karting.\n\nMurphy sold the racetrack in 2005 to DIRT Motorsports, later renamed the [[World of Outlaws|World Racing Group]].<ref>[https://www.news-journalonline.com/sports/20161004/volusia-speedway-park-closes-but-will-return-for-dirtcar-nationals Volusia Speedway Park closes but will return for DIRTcar Nationals] - Godwin Kelly, The Daytona Beach News-Journal, 4 October 2016</ref>\n\n==NASCAR events==\nFrom 1989 until 1992, the track hosted a [[NASCAR]] [[Busch Series]] race in the 1/2 mile layout. <ref>[http://racing-reference.info/tracks?id=185 Track history at racing-reference.info]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
