A French army under the command of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] was defeated by two of the armies of the [[Seventh Coalition]]: an army consisting of units from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Hanover, Brunswick and Nassau, under the command of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], referred to by many authors as the Anglo-allied army or Wellington's army, and a [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] army under the command of Field Marshal [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher|von Bl\u00fccher]] referred also as Bl\u00fccher's army. The battle marked the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nUpon Napoleon's return to power in March 1815, many states that had opposed him formed the Seventh Coalition and began to mobilise armies. Wellington and Bl\u00fccher's armies were [[canton (military)|cantoned]] close to the northeastern border of France. Napoleon planned to attack them separately in the hope of destroying them before they could join in a coordinated invasion of France with other members of the coalition. On 16 June, Napoleon successfully attacked the bulk of the Prussian army at the [[Battle of Ligny]] with his main force, causing the Prussians to [[Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo|withdraw northwards on the 17th]], parallel to Wellington and in good order. Napoleon sent a third of his forces to pursue the Prussians, which resulted in the separate [[Battle of Wavre]] with the Prussian rear-guard on 18\u201319 June, and prevented that French force from participating at Waterloo. Also on 16 June, a small portion of the French army contested the [[Battle of Quatre Bras]] with the Anglo-allied army. The Anglo-allied army held their ground on 16 June, but the withdrawal of the Prussians caused Wellington to [[Waterloo campaign: Quatre Bras to Waterloo|withdraw north to Waterloo on the 17th.]]\n \nUpon learning that the Prussian army was able to support him, Wellington decided to offer battle on the [[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Mont-Saint-Jean]] escarpment across the Brussels road, near the village of Waterloo. Here he withstood repeated attacks by the French throughout the afternoon of the 18th, aided by the progressively arriving Prussians who attacked the French flank and inflicted heavy casualties. In the evening Napoleon assaulted the Anglo-allied line with his last reserves, the senior infantry battalions of the [[French Imperial Guard]]. With the Prussians breaking through on the French right flank, the Anglo-allied army withstood and repulsed the [[French Imperial Guard]], and the French army was routed.\n\nWaterloo was the decisive engagement of the [[Waterloo Campaign]] and Napoleon's last. According to Wellington, the battle was \"the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life\".<ref>[[q:Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wikiquote:Wellington]] citing ''Creevey Papers'', ch. x, p. 236</ref> [[Abdication of Napoleon, 1815|Napoleon abdicated]] four days later, and coalition forces entered Paris on 7 July. The defeat at Waterloo ended Napoleon's rule as [[Emperor of the French]] and marked the end of his [[Hundred Days]] return from exile. This ended the [[First French Empire]] and set a chronological milestone between serial European wars and decades of [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)|relative peace]], often referred to as the ''[[Pax Britannica]]''.\n\nThe battlefield is located in the Belgian municipalities of [[Braine-l'Alleud]] and [[Lasne]],{{sfn|Marcelis|2015}} about {{convert|15|km|mi}} south of [[Brussels]], and about {{convert|2|km|mi}} from the town of Waterloo.

Also, coalition troops in Belgium were largely second-line, as many units were of dubious quality and loyalty, and most of the British veterans of the [[Peninsular War]] had been sent to North America to fight in the [[War of 1812]].{{sfn|Chandler|1966|pp=1016, 1017, 1093}}\n\nThe initial dispositions of British commander [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], were intended to counter the threat of Napoleon enveloping the Coalition armies by moving through [[Mons]] to the south-west of Brussels.{{sfn|Siborne<!--W-->|1895|p=82}} This would have pushed Wellington closer to the Prussian forces, led by [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher]], but might have cut Wellington's communications with his base at [[Ostend]].

The force at his disposal at Waterloo was less than one third that size, but the rank and file were nearly all loyal and experienced soldiers.{{sfn|Herold|1967|pp= 53, 58, 110}} Napoleon divided his army into a left wing commanded by [[Michel Ney|Marshal Ney]], a right wing commanded by [[Emmanuel, marquis de Grouchy|Marshal Grouchy]] and a reserve under his command (although all three elements remained close enough to support one another).

In the early hours of 16 June, at the [[Duchess of Richmond's ball]] in Brussels, he received a dispatch from the [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]] and was shocked by the speed of Napoleon's advance. He hastily ordered his army to concentrate on [[Quatre Bras]], where the Prince of Orange, with the brigade of [[Bernhard Carl of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar]], was holding a tenuous position against the soldiers of Ney's left wing.{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=508}}\n\nNey's orders were to secure the crossroads of Quatre Bras, so that he could later swing east and reinforce Napoleon if necessary. Ney found the crossroads of [[Battle of Quatre Bras|Quatre Bras]] lightly held by the Prince of Orange, who repelled Ney's initial attacks but was gradually driven back by overwhelming numbers of French troops. First reinforcements, and then Wellington arrived. He took command and drove Ney back, securing the crossroads by early evening, too late to send help to the Prussians, who had already been defeated.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061125023608/http://waterloobattletours.users.btopenworld.com/page14.html |title= The Battle of Quatre Bras (June 16th 1815)    |publisher= Archive Org | date=  | author=   | accessdate= April 17, 2020  }}</ref><ref name=\"Simner\"/><ref name=\"Perr2013\">{{cite book|author=Bryan Perrett|title=Why the Germans Lost: The Rise and Fall of the Black Eagle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b8o7BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA51|date=20 November 2013|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=978-1-78159-197-0|pages=51\u2013}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 16 June, Napoleon attacked and defeated Bl\u00fccher's Prussians at the [[Battle of Ligny]] using part of the reserve and the right wing of his army. The Prussian centre gave way under heavy French assaults, but the flanks held their ground. [[Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo|The Prussian retreat from Ligny]] went uninterrupted and seemingly unnoticed by the French.

Instead, they, too, fell back northwards\u2014parallel to Wellington's line of march, still within supporting distance and in communication with him throughout. The Prussians rallied on [[Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von B\u00fclow|B\u00fclow]]'s IV Corps, which had not been engaged at Ligny and was in a strong position south of [[Wavre]].{{sfn|Chesney|1874|pp=144\u2013145}}\n\nWith the Prussian retreat from Ligny, Wellington's position at Quatre Bras was untenable.

A late start, uncertainty about the direction the Prussians had taken, and the vagueness of the orders given to him, meant that Grouchy was too late to prevent the Prussian army reaching Wavre, from where it could march to support Wellington.

With the exception of the British and some from Hanover and Brunswick who had fought with the British army in Spain, many of the professional soldiers in the Coalition armies had spent some of their time in the French army or in armies allied to the Napoleonic regime. The historian [[Alessandro Barbero]] states that in this heterogeneous army the difference between British and foreign troops did not prove significant under fire.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|p=19}}\n\nWellington was also acutely short of heavy cavalry, having only seven British and three Dutch regiments. The [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] imposed many of his staff officers on Wellington, including his second-in-command the [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Earl of Uxbridge]]. Uxbridge commanded the cavalry and had [[Blank cheque|carte blanche]] from Wellington to commit these forces at his discretion. Wellington stationed a further 17,000 troops at [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]], {{convert|8|mi|km}} away to the west. They were mostly composed of Dutch troops under the Prince of Orange's younger brother [[Prince Frederick of the Netherlands]]. They were placed as a guard against any possible wide flanking movement by the French forces, and also to act as a rearguard if Wellington was forced to retreat towards Antwerp and the coast.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=239\u2013240}}{{efn|The straight-line distance from Halle to Braine-l'Alleud, Wellington's far right flank is nearly the same as the straight-line distance from Wavre to [[Frichermont]], Wellington's far left flank, around {{convert|8|mi|km}}.}}\n\nThe Prussian army was in the throes of reorganisation. In 1815, the former Reserve regiments, Legions, and ''Freikorps'' volunteer formations from the wars of 1813\u20131814 were in the process of being absorbed into the line, along with many ''[[Landwehr]]'' (militia) regiments. The ''Landwehr'' were mostly untrained and unequipped when they arrived in Belgium. The Prussian cavalry were in a similar state.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|p=59}} Its artillery was also reorganising and did not give its best performance\u2014guns and equipment continued to arrive during and after the battle.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nOffsetting these handicaps, the Prussian Army had excellent and professional leadership in its [[German General Staff|General Staff]] organisation. These officers came from four schools developed for this purpose and thus worked to a common standard of training. This system was in marked contrast to the conflicting, vague orders issued by the French army.

It consisted of a long ridge running east\u2013west, perpendicular to, and bisected by, the main road to Brussels. Along the crest of the ridge ran the [[Ohain, Belgium|Ohain]] road, a deep [[sunken lane]]. Near the crossroads with the Brussels road was [[Waterloo Elm|a large elm tree]] that was roughly in the centre of Wellington's position and served as his command post for much of the day. Wellington deployed his infantry in a line just behind the crest of the ridge following the Ohain road.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=78\u201379}}\n\nUsing the [[Reverse slope defence|reverse slope]], as he had many times previously, Wellington concealed his strength from the French, with the exception of his [[skirmisher]]s and artillery.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=78\u201379}} The length of front of the battlefield was also relatively short at {{convert|2.5|mi|0}}. This allowed Wellington to draw up his forces in depth, which he did in the centre and on the right, all the way towards the village of [[Braine-l'Alleud]], in the expectation that the Prussians would reinforce his left during the day.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=80}}\n\nIn front of the ridge, there were three positions that could be fortified. On the extreme right were the ch\u00e2teau, garden, and orchard of [[Hougoumont (farmhouse)|Hougoumont]]. This was a large and well-built country house, initially hidden in trees. The house faced north along a sunken, covered lane (usually described by the British as \"the hollow-way\") along which it could be supplied. On the extreme left was the hamlet of [[Papelotte]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=149}}\n\nBoth Hougoumont and Papelotte were fortified and garrisoned, and thus anchored Wellington's [[Flanking maneuver|flanks]] securely. Papelotte also commanded the road to Wavre that the Prussians would use to send reinforcements to Wellington's position. On the western side of the main road, and in front of the rest of Wellington's line, was the farmhouse and orchard of [[La Haye Sainte]], which was garrisoned with 400 light infantry of the King's German Legion.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=149}} On the opposite side of the road was a disused sand quarry, where the [[95th Rifles]] were posted as sharpshooters.{{sfn|Parry|1900|p=58}}\n\nWellington's forces positioning presented a formidable challenge to any attacking force. Any attempt to turn Wellington's right would entail taking the entrenched Hougoumont position. Any attack on his right centre would mean the attackers would have to march between [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilading fire]] from Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte. On the left, any attack would also be enfiladed by fire from La Haye Sainte and its adjoining sandpit, and any attempt at turning the left flank would entail fighting through the lanes and hedgerows surrounding Papelotte and the [[List of Waterloo Battlefield locations#Eastern end of the line of battle|other garrisoned buildings]] on that flank, and some very wet ground in the Smohain [[defile (geography)|defile]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=141, 235}}\n\nThe French army formed on the slopes of another ridge to the south. Napoleon could not see Wellington's positions, so he drew his forces up symmetrically about the Brussels road. On the right was I Corps under [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon|d'Erlon]] with 16,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry, plus a cavalry reserve of 4,700. On the left was II Corps under [[Honor\u00e9 Charles Reille|Reille]] with 13,000 infantry, and 1,300 cavalry, and a cavalry reserve of 4,600. In the centre about the road south of the inn ''[[La Belle Alliance]]'' were a reserve including Lobau's VI Corps with 6,000 men, the 13,000 infantry of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]], and a cavalry reserve of 2,000.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=83\u201385}}\n\nIn the right rear of the French position was the substantial village of [[Plancenoit]], and at the extreme right, the ''Bois de Paris'' wood. Napoleon initially commanded the battle from Rossomme farm, where he could see the entire battlefield, but moved to a position near ''La Belle Alliance'' early in the afternoon. Command on the battlefield (which was largely hidden from his view) was delegated to Ney.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=91}}\n{{wide image|Panorama waterloo v2.jpg|1100px|align-cap=center|Panorama of the Waterloo battlefield, (2012)}}\n\n==Battle==\n===Preparation===\n[[File:Waterloo Campaign map-alt3.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Map of the Waterloo campaign]]\n\nWellington rose at around 02:00 or 03:00 on 18 June, and wrote letters until dawn. He had earlier written to Bl\u00fccher confirming that he would give battle at Mont-Saint-Jean if Bl\u00fccher could provide him with at least one corps; otherwise he would retreat towards Brussels. At a late-night council, Bl\u00fccher's chief of staff, [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau]], had been distrustful of Wellington's strategy, but Bl\u00fccher persuaded him that they should march to join Wellington's army. In the morning Wellington duly received a reply from Bl\u00fccher, promising to support him with three corps.{{sfn|Longford|1971|pp=535\u2013536}}\n\nFrom 06:00 Wellington was in the field supervising the deployment of his forces. At Wavre, the Prussian IV Corps under B\u00fclow was designated to lead the march to Waterloo as it was in the best shape, not having been involved in the Battle of Ligny. Although they had not taken casualties, IV Corps had been marching for two days, covering the retreat of the three other corps of the Prussian army from the battlefield of Ligny. They had been posted farthest away from the battlefield, and progress was very slow. The roads were in poor condition after the night's heavy rain, and B\u00fclow's men had to pass through the congested streets of Wavre and move 88&nbsp;artillery pieces. Matters were not helped when a fire broke out in Wavre, blocking several streets along B\u00fclow's intended route. As a result, the last part of the corps left at 10:00, six hours after the leading elements had moved out towards Waterloo. B\u00fclow's men were followed to Waterloo first by I Corps and then by II Corps.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=141}}<ref name=\"Gre2015\">{{cite book|author=John Grehan|title=Voices from the Past: Waterloo 1815: History's most famous battle told through eyewitness accounts, newspaper reports, parliamentary debate, memoirs and diaries.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0KuCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA342|date=30 May 2015|publisher=Frontline Books|isbn=978-1-78383-199-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref>\n\nNapoleon breakfasted off silver plate at ''Le Caillou'', the house where he had spent the night. When [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Soult]] suggested that Grouchy should be recalled to join the main force, Napoleon said, \"Just because you have all been beaten by Wellington, you think he's a good general. I tell you Wellington is a bad general, the English are bad troops, and this affair is nothing more than eating breakfast\".{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=547}}<ref name=\"Gre2015\"/>\n\nNapoleon's seemingly dismissive remark may have been strategic, given his maxim \"in war, morale is everything\". He had acted similarly in the past, and on the morning of the battle of Waterloo may have been responding to the pessimism and objections of his chief of staff and senior generals.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|pp=163\u2013166}}\n\n[[File:Napoleon.Waterloo.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Battle of Mont-Saint-Jean]]]]\n\nLater on, being told by his brother, [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte|Jerome]], of some gossip overheard by a waiter between British officers at lunch at the 'King of Spain' inn in Genappe that the Prussians were to march over from Wavre, Napoleon declared that the Prussians would need at least two days to recover and would be dealt with by Grouchy.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=73}} Surprisingly, Jerome's overheard gossip aside, the French commanders present at the pre-battle conference at ''Le Caillou'' had no information about the alarming proximity of the Prussians and did not suspect that Bl\u00fccher's men would start erupting onto the field of battle in great numbers just five hours later.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=xxxii}}\n\nNapoleon had delayed the start of the battle owing to the sodden ground, which would have made manoeuvring cavalry and artillery difficult. In addition, many of his forces had [[bivouac shelter|bivouacked]] well to the south of ''La Belle Alliance''. At 10:00, in response to a dispatch he had received from Grouchy six hours earlier, he sent a reply telling Grouchy to \"head for Wavre [to Grouchy's north] in order to draw near to us [to the west of Grouchy]\" and then \"push before him\" the Prussians to arrive at Waterloo \"as soon as possible\".{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=548}}<ref name=\"Gre2015\"/>\n\nAt 11:00, Napoleon drafted his general order: Reille's Corps on the left and d'Erlon's Corps to the right were to attack the village of Mont-Saint-Jean and keep abreast of one another. This order assumed Wellington's battle-line was in the village, rather than at the more forward position on the ridge.{{sfn|Bonaparte|1869|pp=292\u2013293}} To enable this, Jerome's division would make an initial attack on Hougoumont, which Napoleon expected would draw in Wellington's reserves,{{sfn|Fletcher|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=US-QQxjHnn8C&pg=PA20 20]}} since its loss would threaten his communications with the sea. A ''[[Grand Battery|grande batterie]]'' of the reserve artillery of I, II, and VI Corps was to then bombard the centre of Wellington's position from about 13:00. D'Erlon's corps would then attack Wellington's left, break through, and roll up his line from east to west. In his memoirs, Napoleon wrote that his intention was to separate Wellington's army from the Prussians and drive it back towards the sea.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=95\u201398}}\n\n===Hougoumont===\n{{Main|Hougoumont}}\n[[File:Nassau - Hougoumont - Papendrecht.jpg|thumb|Nassau troops at the Hougoumont farm]]\n[[File:800px-North gate Hougoumont.jpg|thumb|Gate on the north side assaulted by the ''1st L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' who were led by ''[[sous-lieutenant]]'' Legros{{sfn|Lamar|2000|p=119}}]]\n\nThe historian Andrew Roberts notes that \"It is a curious fact about the Battle of Waterloo that no one is absolutely certain when it actually began\".{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=55}} Wellington recorded in his dispatches that at \"about ten o'clock [Napoleon] commenced a furious attack upon our post at Hougoumont\".{{sfn|Wellesley|1815|loc=''To Earl Bathurst.

The Duke of Wellington puts it at 10:00. General Alava says half-past eleven, Napoleon and Drouet say noon, and Ney 13:00. Lord Hill may be credited with having settled this minute question of fact. He took two watches with him into the fight, one a stop-watch, and he marked with it the sound of the first shot fired, and this evidence is now accepted as proving that the first flash of red flame which marked the opening of the world-shaking tragedy of Waterloo took place at exactly ten minutes to twelve\" {{Harv|Fitchett|2006|loc=Chapter: King-making Waterloo}}. \"...watches had to be set by solar time, this meant that it was rare for two watches to agree... For example, on 9 June, ... the French I Corps had been at Lille, while the IV Corps was at Metz. Assuming an officer had set his watch at noon and then meticulously wound it twice a day but not reset it during the approach march, by the time the two corps reached the vicinity of Waterloo, the I Corps officer's watch would have read 12:40 p.m. at a time when the IV Corps officer's read 11:20 a.m., and it was noon at Waterloo. This is an extreme example, and unlikely to have actually been the case, but it demonstrates the problem quite well\" {{harv|Nofi|1998|p=182}}.}} The house and its immediate environs were defended by four light companies of [[Foot guards|Guards]], and the wood and park by Hanoverian ''[[J\u00e4ger (military)|J\u00e4ger]]'' and the 1/2nd Nassau.{{efn|That is, the 1st battalion of the 2nd Regiment.

As the British guns were distracted by a duel with French artillery, a second attack by Soye's brigade and what had been Bauduin's succeeded in reaching the north gate of the house. Sous-Lieutenant Legros, a French officer, broke the gate open with an axe, and some French troops managed to enter the courtyard.{{sfn|Thiers|1862|p=215}} The [[Coldstream Guards]] and the [[Scots Guards]] arrived to support the defence. There was a fierce melee, and the British managed to close the gate on the French troops streaming in. The Frenchmen trapped in the courtyard were all killed. Only a young drummer boy was spared.\n\nFighting continued around Hougoumont all afternoon. Its surroundings were heavily invested by French light infantry, and coordinated attacks were made against the troops behind Hougoumont. Wellington's army defended the house and the hollow way running north from it. In the afternoon, Napoleon personally ordered the house to be shelled to set it on fire,{{efn|Seeing the flames, Wellington sent a note to the house's commander stating that he must hold his position whatever the cost {{Harv|Barbero|2005|p=298}}.}} resulting in the destruction of all but the chapel. Du Plat's brigade of the King's German Legion was brought forward to defend the hollow way, which they had to do without senior officers. Eventually they were relieved by the [[71st (Highland) Regiment of Foot|71st Highlanders]], a British infantry regiment. Adam's brigade was further reinforced by [[Hugh Halkett]]'s 3rd Hanoverian Brigade, and successfully repulsed further infantry and cavalry attacks sent by Reille. Hougoumont held out until the end of the battle.\n\n{{quote|I had occupied that post with a detachment from General Byng's brigade of Guards, which was in position in its rear; and it was some time under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel MacDonald, and afterwards of Colonel Home; and I am happy to add that it was maintained, throughout the day, with the utmost gallantry by these brave troops, notwithstanding the repeated efforts of large bodies of the enemy to obtain possession of it.|Wellington.{{sfn|Booth|1815|p=10}} }}\n\n{{quote|When I reached Lloyd's abandoned guns, I stood near them for about a minute to contemplate the scene: it was grand beyond description.

Similarly, though the house never contained a large number of troops, Wellington devoted 21&nbsp;battalions (12,000&nbsp;troops) over the course of the afternoon in keeping the hollow way open to allow fresh troops and ammunition to reach the buildings. He moved several artillery batteries from his hard-pressed centre to support Hougoumont,{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=305, 306}} and later stated that \"the success of the battle turned upon closing the gates at Hougoumont\".{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=57}}\n\n===The Grand Battery starts its bombardment===\n[[File:Battle of Waterloo.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Map of the battle: Napoleon's units are in blue, Wellington's in red, Bl\u00fccher's in grey.]]\n\nThe 80 guns of Napoleon's ''grande batterie'' drew up in the centre.

The farmhouse was defended by the [[King's German Legion]]. While one French battalion engaged the defenders from the front, the following battalions fanned out to either side and, with the support of several squadrons of [[cuirassiers]], succeeded in isolating the farmhouse. The King's German Legion resolutely defended the farmhouse. Each time the French tried to scale the walls the outnumbered Germans somehow held them off. The [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]] saw that La Haye Sainte had been cut off and tried to reinforce it by sending forward the Hanoverian L\u00fcneburg Battalion in line. Cuirassiers concealed in a fold in the ground caught and destroyed it in minutes and then rode on past La Haye Sainte, almost to the crest of the ridge, where they covered d'Erlon's left flank as his attack developed.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=289\u2013293}}\n\nAt about 13:30, d'Erlon started to advance his three other divisions, some 14,000&nbsp;men over a front of about {{convert|1,000|m|yd|abbr=off}}, against Wellington's left wing. At the point they aimed for they faced 6,000&nbsp;men: the first line consisted of the Dutch 1st \"[[Brigade van Bylandt]]\" of the 2nd Dutch division, flanked by the British brigades of Kempt and Pack on either side. The second line consisted of British and Hanoverian troops under [[Sir Thomas Picton]], who were lying down in dead ground behind the ridge. All had suffered badly at Quatre Bras. In addition, the Bijlandt brigade had been ordered to deploy its skirmishers in the hollow road and on the forward slope.

Van Zuylen rallied 400 men, according to his estimate, who were ready to join the counterattack and even captured two French fanions ({{Harvnb|Bas|Wommersom|1909|pp=338\u2013341}}(vol. 3); {{Harvnb|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=293\u2013295}}).}} A moment later the Prince of Orange ordered a counterattack, which actually occurred around 10 minutes later.

It was lined on both sides by thick hedges, with [[Willem Frederik van Bylandt|Bylandt]]'s brigade just across the road while the British brigades had been lying down some 100 yards back from the road, Pack's to Bylandt's left and Kempt's to Bylandt's right. Kempt's 1,900 men were engaged by Bourgeois' brigade of 1,900 men of Quiot's division. In the centre, Donzelot's division had pushed back Bylandt's brigade. On the right of the French advance was Marcognet's division led by Grenier's brigade consisting of the ''45e R\u00e9giment de Ligne'' and followed by the ''25e R\u00e9giment de Ligne'', somewhat less than 2,000 men, and behind them, Nogue's brigade of the ''21e'' and ''45e'' regiments. Opposing them on the other side of the road was [[Denis Pack|Pack]]'s 9th Brigade consisting of the [[44th Foot]] and three Scottish regiments: the [[Royal Scots]], the 42nd [[Black Watch]], and the 92nd Gordons, totalling something over 2,000 men. A very even fight between British and French infantry was about to occur.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|pp=134\u2013138}}\n\nThe French advance drove in the British skirmishers and reached the sunken road. As they did so, Pack's men stood up, formed into a four deep line formation for fear of the French cavalry, advanced, and opened fire. However, a firefight had been anticipated and the French infantry had accordingly advanced in more linear formation. Now, fully deployed into line, they returned fire and successfully pressed the British troops; although the attack faltered at the centre, the line in front of d'Erlon's right started to crumble. Picton was killed shortly after ordering the counter-attack and the British and Hanoverian troops also began to give way under the pressure of numbers.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=296\u2013297}} Pack's regiments, all four ranks deep, advanced to attack the French in the road but faltered and began to fire on the French instead of charging. The 42nd Black Watch halted at the hedge and the resulting fire-fight drove back the British 92nd Foot while the leading French ''45e Ligne'' burst through the hedge cheering. Along the sunken road, the French were forcing the Anglo-allies back, the British line was dispersing, and at two o'clock in the afternoon Napoleon was winning the Battle of Waterloo.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|p=138}}\n\nReports from [[Karl Freiherr von M\u00fcffling|Baron von M\u00fcffling]], the Prussian liaison officer attached to Wellington's army, relate that: \"After 3 o'clock the Duke's situation became critical, unless the succour of the Prussian army arrived soon\".{{sfn|Uffindell|Corum|2002|p=211}}\n\n===Charge of the British heavy cavalry===\n{{quote|Our officers of cavalry have acquired a trick of galloping at everything.

On they came until they got near enough, whilst the very earth seemed to vibrate beneath the thundering tramp of the mounted host. One might suppose that nothing could have resisted the shock of this terrible moving mass. They were the famous cuirassiers, almost all old soldiers, who had distinguished themselves on most of the battlefields of Europe. In an almost incredibly short period they were within twenty yards of us, shouting ''\"Vive l'Empereur!\"'' The word of command, \"Prepare to receive cavalry\", had been given, every man in the front ranks knelt, and a wall bristling with steel, held together by steady hands, presented itself to the infuriated cuirassiers.|Captain Rees Howell Gronow, Foot Guards.{{sfn|Gronow|1862|loc=''The Duke of Wellington in our square''}} }}\n\n[[File:Artillery in Battle of Waterloo by Jones.jpg|thumb|\"The artillery officers had the range so accurately, that every shot and shell fell into the very centre of their masses\" (Original inscription and drawing after [[George Jones (painter)|George Jones]])]]\n\nIn essence this type of massed cavalry attack relied almost entirely on psychological shock for effect.{{sfn|Weller|1992|pp=211, 212}} Close artillery support could disrupt infantry squares and allow cavalry to penetrate; at Waterloo, however, co-operation between the French cavalry and artillery was not impressive. The French artillery did not get close enough to the Anglo-allied infantry in sufficient numbers to be decisive.{{sfn|Adkin|2001|pp=252, 361}} Artillery fire between charges did produce mounting casualties, but most of this fire was at relatively long range and was often indirect, at targets beyond the ridge. If infantry being attacked held firm in their square defensive formations, and were not panicked, cavalry on their own could do very little damage to them. The French cavalry attacks were repeatedly repelled by the steadfast infantry squares, the harrying fire of British artillery as the French cavalry recoiled down the slopes to regroup, and the decisive countercharges of Wellington's light cavalry regiments, the Dutch heavy cavalry brigade, and the remaining effectives of the Household Cavalry. At least one artillery officer disobeyed Wellington's order to seek shelter in the adjacent squares during the charges. [[Cavali\u00e9 Mercer|Captain Mercer]], who commanded [[G Parachute Battery (Mercer's Troop) Royal Horse Artillery|'G' Troop]], [[Royal Horse Artillery]], thought the Brunswick troops on either side of him so shaky that he kept his battery of six nine-pounders in action against the cavalry throughout, to great effect.{{sfn|Mercer|1870a|pp=313\u2013315}}{{efn|This qualification may have been self-serving on Mercer's part. Wellington himself sought refuge in the \"shaky\" Brunswick squares at the time and observed what he interpreted as acts of cowardice by British artillerymen, who \"...&nbsp;ran off the field entirely, taking with them limbers, ammunition, and everything&nbsp;...\" as he wrote in a letter of 21 December 1815 to the Master-General of the Ordnance, Lord Mulgrave.

A French army under the command of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] was defeated by two of the armies of the [[Seventh Coalition]]: an army consisting of units from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Hanover, Brunswick and Nassau, under the command of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], referred to by many authors as the Anglo-allied army or Wellington's army, and a [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] army under the command of Field Marshal [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher|von Bl\u00fccher]] referred also as Bl\u00fccher's army. The battle marked the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nUpon Napoleon's return to power in March 1815, many states that had opposed him formed the Seventh Coalition and began to mobilise armies. Wellington and Bl\u00fccher's armies were [[canton (military)|cantoned]] close to the northeastern border of France. Napoleon planned to attack them separately in the hope of destroying them before they could join in a coordinated invasion of France with other members of the coalition. On 16 June, Napoleon successfully attacked the bulk of the Prussian army at the [[Battle of Ligny]] with his main force, causing the Prussians to [[Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo|withdraw northwards on the 17th]], parallel to Wellington and in good order. Napoleon sent a third of his forces to pursue the Prussians, which resulted in the separate [[Battle of Wavre]] with the Prussian rear-guard on 18\u201319 June, and prevented that French force from participating at Waterloo. Also on 16 June, a small portion of the French army contested the [[Battle of Quatre Bras]] with the Anglo-allied army. The Anglo-allied army held their ground on 16 June, but the withdrawal of the Prussians caused Wellington to [[Waterloo campaign: Quatre Bras to Waterloo|withdraw north to Waterloo on the 17th.]]\n \nUpon learning that the Prussian army was able to support him, Wellington decided to offer battle on the [[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Mont-Saint-Jean]] escarpment across the Brussels road, near the village of Waterloo. Here he withstood repeated attacks by the French throughout the afternoon of the 18th, aided by the progressively arriving Prussians who attacked the French flank and inflicted heavy casualties. In the evening Napoleon assaulted the Anglo-allied line with his last reserves, the senior infantry battalions of the [[French Imperial Guard]]. With the Prussians breaking through on the French right flank, the Anglo-allied army withstood and repulsed the [[French Imperial Guard]], and the French army was routed.\n\nWaterloo was the decisive engagement of the [[Waterloo Campaign]] and Napoleon's last. According to Wellington, the battle was \"the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life\".<ref>[[q:Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wikiquote:Wellington]] citing ''Creevey Papers'', ch. x, p. 236</ref> [[Abdication of Napoleon, 1815|Napoleon abdicated]] four days later, and coalition forces entered Paris on 7 July. The defeat at Waterloo ended Napoleon's rule as [[Emperor of the French]] and marked the end of his [[Hundred Days]] return from exile. This ended the [[First French Empire]] and set a chronological milestone between serial European wars and decades of [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)|relative peace]], often referred to as the ''[[Pax Britannica]]''.\n\nThe battlefield is located in the Belgian municipalities of [[Braine-l'Alleud]] and [[Lasne]],{{sfn|Marcelis|2015}} about {{convert|15|km|mi}} south of [[Brussels]], and about {{convert|2|km|mi}} from the town of Waterloo. The site of the battlefield today is dominated by the monument of the [[Lion's Mound]], a large artificial hill constructed from earth taken from the battlefield itself; the topography of the battlefield near the mound has not been preserved.\n\n==Prelude==\n{{Main|Waterloo Campaign}}\n[[File:Strategic Situation of Western Europe 1815.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|The strategic situation in Western Europe in 1815: 250,000 Frenchmen faced a coalition of about 850,000 soldiers on four [[Front (military)|fronts]].

With the exception of the British and some from Hanover and Brunswick who had fought with the British army in Spain, many of the professional soldiers in the Coalition armies had spent some of their time in the French army or in armies allied to the Napoleonic regime. The historian [[Alessandro Barbero]] states that in this heterogeneous army the difference between British and foreign troops did not prove significant under fire.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|p=19}}\n\nWellington was also acutely short of heavy cavalry, having only seven British and three Dutch regiments. The [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] imposed many of his staff officers on Wellington, including his second-in-command the [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Earl of Uxbridge]]. Uxbridge commanded the cavalry and had [[Blank cheque|carte blanche]] from Wellington to commit these forces at his discretion. Wellington stationed a further 17,000 troops at [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]], {{convert|8|mi|km}} away to the west. They were mostly composed of Dutch troops under the Prince of Orange's younger brother [[Prince Frederick of the Netherlands]]. They were placed as a guard against any possible wide flanking movement by the French forces, and also to act as a rearguard if Wellington was forced to retreat towards Antwerp and the coast.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=239\u2013240}}{{efn|The straight-line distance from Halle to Braine-l'Alleud, Wellington's far right flank is nearly the same as the straight-line distance from Wavre to [[Frichermont]], Wellington's far left flank, around {{convert|8|mi|km}}.}}\n\nThe Prussian army was in the throes of reorganisation. In 1815, the former Reserve regiments, Legions, and ''Freikorps'' volunteer formations from the wars of 1813\u20131814 were in the process of being absorbed into the line, along with many ''[[Landwehr]]'' (militia) regiments. The ''Landwehr'' were mostly untrained and unequipped when they arrived in Belgium. The Prussian cavalry were in a similar state.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|p=59}} Its artillery was also reorganising and did not give its best performance\u2014guns and equipment continued to arrive during and after the battle.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nOffsetting these handicaps, the Prussian Army had excellent and professional leadership in its [[German General Staff|General Staff]] organisation. These officers came from four schools developed for this purpose and thus worked to a common standard of training. This system was in marked contrast to the conflicting, vague orders issued by the French army. This staff system ensured that before Ligny, three-quarters of the Prussian army concentrated for battle with 24 hours' notice.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nAfter Ligny, the Prussian army, although defeated, was able to realign its supply train, reorganise itself, and intervene decisively on the Waterloo battlefield within 48 hours.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}} Two and a half Prussian army corps, or 48,000 men, were engaged at Waterloo; two brigades under B\u00fclow, commander of IV Corps, attacked [[Georges Mouton|Lobau]] at 16:30, while [[Hans Ernst Karl, Graf von Zieten|Zieten]]'s I Corps and parts of [[Pirch I]]'s II Corps engaged at about 18:00.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Prussian March |url=https://www.waterlooassociation.org.uk/2018/06/04/prussian-advance/ |website=Waterloo Association |accessdate=9 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Battlefield==\n{{further|List of Waterloo Battlefield locations}}\n[[File:Waterloo.1816.02.jpg|thumb|left|An 1816 map of the local topography and the location of the battle]]\n[[File:Belgium-6773 - Battlefield View (14152126362).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A view of the battlefield from the Lion's mound. On the top right are the buildings of [[La Haye Sainte]].]]\n\nThe Waterloo position was a strong one. It consisted of a long ridge running east\u2013west, perpendicular to, and bisected by, the main road to Brussels. Along the crest of the ridge ran the [[Ohain, Belgium|Ohain]] road, a deep [[sunken lane]]. Near the crossroads with the Brussels road was [[Waterloo Elm|a large elm tree]] that was roughly in the centre of Wellington's position and served as his command post for much of the day. Wellington deployed his infantry in a line just behind the crest of the ridge following the Ohain road.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=78\u201379}}\n\nUsing the [[Reverse slope defence|reverse slope]], as he had many times previously, Wellington concealed his strength from the French, with the exception of his [[skirmisher]]s and artillery.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=78\u201379}} The length of front of the battlefield was also relatively short at {{convert|2.5|mi|0}}. This allowed Wellington to draw up his forces in depth, which he did in the centre and on the right, all the way towards the village of [[Braine-l'Alleud]], in the expectation that the Prussians would reinforce his left during the day.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=80}}\n\nIn front of the ridge, there were three positions that could be fortified. On the extreme right were the ch\u00e2teau, garden, and orchard of [[Hougoumont (farmhouse)|Hougoumont]]. This was a large and well-built country house, initially hidden in trees. The house faced north along a sunken, covered lane (usually described by the British as \"the hollow-way\") along which it could be supplied. On the extreme left was the hamlet of [[Papelotte]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=149}}\n\nBoth Hougoumont and Papelotte were fortified and garrisoned, and thus anchored Wellington's [[Flanking maneuver|flanks]] securely. Papelotte also commanded the road to Wavre that the Prussians would use to send reinforcements to Wellington's position. On the western side of the main road, and in front of the rest of Wellington's line, was the farmhouse and orchard of [[La Haye Sainte]], which was garrisoned with 400 light infantry of the King's German Legion.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=149}} On the opposite side of the road was a disused sand quarry, where the [[95th Rifles]] were posted as sharpshooters.{{sfn|Parry|1900|p=58}}\n\nWellington's forces positioning presented a formidable challenge to any attacking force. Any attempt to turn Wellington's right would entail taking the entrenched Hougoumont position. Any attack on his right centre would mean the attackers would have to march between [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilading fire]] from Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte. On the left, any attack would also be enfiladed by fire from La Haye Sainte and its adjoining sandpit, and any attempt at turning the left flank would entail fighting through the lanes and hedgerows surrounding Papelotte and the [[List of Waterloo Battlefield locations#Eastern end of the line of battle|other garrisoned buildings]] on that flank, and some very wet ground in the Smohain [[defile (geography)|defile]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=141, 235}}\n\nThe French army formed on the slopes of another ridge to the south. Napoleon could not see Wellington's positions, so he drew his forces up symmetrically about the Brussels road. On the right was I Corps under [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon|d'Erlon]] with 16,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry, plus a cavalry reserve of 4,700. On the left was II Corps under [[Honor\u00e9 Charles Reille|Reille]] with 13,000 infantry, and 1,300 cavalry, and a cavalry reserve of 4,600. In the centre about the road south of the inn ''[[La Belle Alliance]]'' were a reserve including Lobau's VI Corps with 6,000 men, the 13,000 infantry of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]], and a cavalry reserve of 2,000.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=83\u201385}}\n\nIn the right rear of the French position was the substantial village of [[Plancenoit]], and at the extreme right, the ''Bois de Paris'' wood. Napoleon initially commanded the battle from Rossomme farm, where he could see the entire battlefield, but moved to a position near ''La Belle Alliance'' early in the afternoon. Command on the battlefield (which was largely hidden from his view) was delegated to Ney.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=91}}\n{{wide image|Panorama waterloo v2.jpg|1100px|align-cap=center|Panorama of the Waterloo battlefield, (2012)}}\n\n==Battle==\n===Preparation===\n[[File:Waterloo Campaign map-alt3.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Map of the Waterloo campaign]]\n\nWellington rose at around 02:00 or 03:00 on 18 June, and wrote letters until dawn. He had earlier written to Bl\u00fccher confirming that he would give battle at Mont-Saint-Jean if Bl\u00fccher could provide him with at least one corps; otherwise he would retreat towards Brussels. At a late-night council, Bl\u00fccher's chief of staff, [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau]], had been distrustful of Wellington's strategy, but Bl\u00fccher persuaded him that they should march to join Wellington's army. In the morning Wellington duly received a reply from Bl\u00fccher, promising to support him with three corps.{{sfn|Longford|1971|pp=535\u2013536}}\n\nFrom 06:00 Wellington was in the field supervising the deployment of his forces. At Wavre, the Prussian IV Corps under B\u00fclow was designated to lead the march to Waterloo as it was in the best shape, not having been involved in the Battle of Ligny. Although they had not taken casualties, IV Corps had been marching for two days, covering the retreat of the three other corps of the Prussian army from the battlefield of Ligny. They had been posted farthest away from the battlefield, and progress was very slow. The roads were in poor condition after the night's heavy rain, and B\u00fclow's men had to pass through the congested streets of Wavre and move 88&nbsp;artillery pieces. Matters were not helped when a fire broke out in Wavre, blocking several streets along B\u00fclow's intended route. As a result, the last part of the corps left at 10:00, six hours after the leading elements had moved out towards Waterloo. B\u00fclow's men were followed to Waterloo first by I Corps and then by II Corps.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=141}}<ref name=\"Gre2015\">{{cite book|author=John Grehan|title=Voices from the Past: Waterloo 1815: History's most famous battle told through eyewitness accounts, newspaper reports, parliamentary debate, memoirs and diaries.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0KuCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA342|date=30 May 2015|publisher=Frontline Books|isbn=978-1-78383-199-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref>\n\nNapoleon breakfasted off silver plate at ''Le Caillou'', the house where he had spent the night.

In addition, many of his forces had [[bivouac shelter|bivouacked]] well to the south of ''La Belle Alliance''. At 10:00, in response to a dispatch he had received from Grouchy six hours earlier, he sent a reply telling Grouchy to \"head for Wavre [to Grouchy's north] in order to draw near to us [to the west of Grouchy]\" and then \"push before him\" the Prussians to arrive at Waterloo \"as soon as possible\".{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=548}}<ref name=\"Gre2015\"/>\n\nAt 11:00, Napoleon drafted his general order: Reille's Corps on the left and d'Erlon's Corps to the right were to attack the village of Mont-Saint-Jean and keep abreast of one another. This order assumed Wellington's battle-line was in the village, rather than at the more forward position on the ridge.{{sfn|Bonaparte|1869|pp=292\u2013293}} To enable this, Jerome's division would make an initial attack on Hougoumont, which Napoleon expected would draw in Wellington's reserves,{{sfn|Fletcher|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=US-QQxjHnn8C&pg=PA20 20]}} since its loss would threaten his communications with the sea. A ''[[Grand Battery|grande batterie]]'' of the reserve artillery of I, II, and VI Corps was to then bombard the centre of Wellington's position from about 13:00. D'Erlon's corps would then attack Wellington's left, break through, and roll up his line from east to west.

He took two watches with him into the fight, one a stop-watch, and he marked with it the sound of the first shot fired, and this evidence is now accepted as proving that the first flash of red flame which marked the opening of the world-shaking tragedy of Waterloo took place at exactly ten minutes to twelve\" {{Harv|Fitchett|2006|loc=Chapter: King-making Waterloo}}. \"...watches had to be set by solar time, this meant that it was rare for two watches to agree...

As the British guns were distracted by a duel with French artillery, a second attack by Soye's brigade and what had been Bauduin's succeeded in reaching the north gate of the house. Sous-Lieutenant Legros, a French officer, broke the gate open with an axe, and some French troops managed to enter the courtyard.{{sfn|Thiers|1862|p=215}} The [[Coldstream Guards]] and the [[Scots Guards]] arrived to support the defence.

Only a young drummer boy was spared.\n\nFighting continued around Hougoumont all afternoon. Its surroundings were heavily invested by French light infantry, and coordinated attacks were made against the troops behind Hougoumont. Wellington's army defended the house and the hollow way running north from it. In the afternoon, Napoleon personally ordered the house to be shelled to set it on fire,{{efn|Seeing the flames, Wellington sent a note to the house's commander stating that he must hold his position whatever the cost {{Harv|Barbero|2005|p=298}}.}} resulting in the destruction of all but the chapel.

The farmhouse was defended by the [[King's German Legion]]. While one French battalion engaged the defenders from the front, the following battalions fanned out to either side and, with the support of several squadrons of [[cuirassiers]], succeeded in isolating the farmhouse. The King's German Legion resolutely defended the farmhouse. Each time the French tried to scale the walls the outnumbered Germans somehow held them off. The [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]] saw that La Haye Sainte had been cut off and tried to reinforce it by sending forward the Hanoverian L\u00fcneburg Battalion in line. Cuirassiers concealed in a fold in the ground caught and destroyed it in minutes and then rode on past La Haye Sainte, almost to the crest of the ridge, where they covered d'Erlon's left flank as his attack developed.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=289\u2013293}}\n\nAt about 13:30, d'Erlon started to advance his three other divisions, some 14,000&nbsp;men over a front of about {{convert|1,000|m|yd|abbr=off}}, against Wellington's left wing. At the point they aimed for they faced 6,000&nbsp;men: the first line consisted of the Dutch 1st \"[[Brigade van Bylandt]]\" of the 2nd Dutch division, flanked by the British brigades of Kempt and Pack on either side. The second line consisted of British and Hanoverian troops under [[Sir Thomas Picton]], who were lying down in dead ground behind the ridge. All had suffered badly at Quatre Bras. In addition, the Bijlandt brigade had been ordered to deploy its skirmishers in the hollow road and on the forward slope.

It was lined on both sides by thick hedges, with [[Willem Frederik van Bylandt|Bylandt]]'s brigade just across the road while the British brigades had been lying down some 100 yards back from the road, Pack's to Bylandt's left and Kempt's to Bylandt's right. Kempt's 1,900 men were engaged by Bourgeois' brigade of 1,900 men of Quiot's division. In the centre, Donzelot's division had pushed back Bylandt's brigade. On the right of the French advance was Marcognet's division led by Grenier's brigade consisting of the ''45e R\u00e9giment de Ligne'' and followed by the ''25e R\u00e9giment de Ligne'', somewhat less than 2,000 men, and behind them, Nogue's brigade of the ''21e'' and ''45e'' regiments. Opposing them on the other side of the road was [[Denis Pack|Pack]]'s 9th Brigade consisting of the [[44th Foot]] and three Scottish regiments: the [[Royal Scots]], the 42nd [[Black Watch]], and the 92nd Gordons, totalling something over 2,000 men. A very even fight between British and French infantry was about to occur.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|pp=134\u2013138}}\n\nThe French advance drove in the British skirmishers and reached the sunken road. As they did so, Pack's men stood up, formed into a four deep line formation for fear of the French cavalry, advanced, and opened fire. However, a firefight had been anticipated and the French infantry had accordingly advanced in more linear formation. Now, fully deployed into line, they returned fire and successfully pressed the British troops; although the attack faltered at the centre, the line in front of d'Erlon's right started to crumble. Picton was killed shortly after ordering the counter-attack and the British and Hanoverian troops also began to give way under the pressure of numbers.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=296\u2013297}} Pack's regiments, all four ranks deep, advanced to attack the French in the road but faltered and began to fire on the French instead of charging. The 42nd Black Watch halted at the hedge and the resulting fire-fight drove back the British 92nd Foot while the leading French ''45e Ligne'' burst through the hedge cheering.

Squares were much smaller than usually depicted in paintings of the battle\u2014a 500-man battalion square would have been no more than {{convert|60|ft}} in length on a side. Squares that stood their ground were deadly to cavalry, as cavalry could not engage with soldiers behind a hedge of bayonets, but were themselves vulnerable to fire from the squares. Horses would not charge a square, nor could they be outflanked, but they were vulnerable to artillery or infantry. Wellington ordered his artillery crews to take shelter within the squares as the cavalry approached, and to return to their guns and resume fire as they retreated.{{sfn|Siborne<!--W-->|1895|pp=444, 447}}{{sfn|Adkin|2001|pp=273, 414}}\n\nWitnesses in the British infantry recorded as many as 12&nbsp;assaults, though this probably includes successive waves of the same general attack; the number of general assaults was undoubtedly far fewer.

On they came until they got near enough, whilst the very earth seemed to vibrate beneath the thundering tramp of the mounted host. One might suppose that nothing could have resisted the shock of this terrible moving mass. They were the famous cuirassiers, almost all old soldiers, who had distinguished themselves on most of the battlefields of Europe. In an almost incredibly short period they were within twenty yards of us, shouting ''\"Vive l'Empereur!\"'' The word of command, \"Prepare to receive cavalry\", had been given, every man in the front ranks knelt, and a wall bristling with steel, held together by steady hands, presented itself to the infuriated cuirassiers.|Captain Rees Howell Gronow, Foot Guards.{{sfn|Gronow|1862|loc=''The Duke of Wellington in our square''}} }}\n\n[[File:Artillery in Battle of Waterloo by Jones.jpg|thumb|\"The artillery officers had the range so accurately, that every shot and shell fell into the very centre of their masses\" (Original inscription and drawing after [[George Jones (painter)|George Jones]])]]\n\nIn essence this type of massed cavalry attack relied almost entirely on psychological shock for effect.{{sfn|Weller|1992|pp=211, 212}} Close artillery support could disrupt infantry squares and allow cavalry to penetrate; at Waterloo, however, co-operation between the French cavalry and artillery was not impressive. The French artillery did not get close enough to the Anglo-allied infantry in sufficient numbers to be decisive.{{sfn|Adkin|2001|pp=252, 361}} Artillery fire between charges did produce mounting casualties, but most of this fire was at relatively long range and was often indirect, at targets beyond the ridge. If infantry being attacked held firm in their square defensive formations, and were not panicked, cavalry on their own could do very little damage to them. The French cavalry attacks were repeatedly repelled by the steadfast infantry squares, the harrying fire of British artillery as the French cavalry recoiled down the slopes to regroup, and the decisive countercharges of Wellington's light cavalry regiments, the Dutch heavy cavalry brigade, and the remaining effectives of the Household Cavalry. At least one artillery officer disobeyed Wellington's order to seek shelter in the adjacent squares during the charges. [[Cavali\u00e9 Mercer|Captain Mercer]], who commanded [[G Parachute Battery (Mercer's Troop) Royal Horse Artillery|'G' Troop]], [[Royal Horse Artillery]], thought the Brunswick troops on either side of him so shaky that he kept his battery of six nine-pounders in action against the cavalry throughout, to great effect.{{sfn|Mercer|1870a|pp=313\u2013315}}{{efn|This qualification may have been self-serving on Mercer's part.

The Prince of Orange then ordered a single battalion of the KGL, the Fifth, to recapture the farm despite the obvious presence of enemy cavalry. Their Colonel, [[Christian Friedrich Wilhelm von Ompteda]] obeyed and led the battalion down the slope, chasing off some French skirmishers until French cuirassiers fell on his open flank, killed him, destroyed his battalion and took its colour.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|p=234}} A Dutch\u2013Belgian cavalry regiment ordered to charge retreated from the field instead, fired on by their own infantry. Merlen's Light Cavalry Brigade charged the French artillery taking position near La Haye Sainte but were shot to pieces and the brigade fell apart. The Netherlands Cavalry Division, Wellington's last cavalry reserve behind the centre having lost half their strength was now useless and the French cavalry, despite its losses, were masters of the field, compelling the Anglo-allied infantry to remain in square. More and more French artillery was brought forward.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|pp=235\u2013236}}\n\nA French battery advanced to within 300 yards of the 1/1st Nassau square causing heavy casualties. When the Nassauers attempted to attack the battery they were ridden down by a squadron of cuirassiers. Yet another battery deployed on the flank of Mercer's battery and shot up its horses and limbers and pushed Mercer back. Mercer later recalled, \"The rapidity and precision of this fire was quite appalling. Every shot almost took effect, and I certainly expected we should all be annihilated. ... The saddle-bags, in many instances were torn from horses' backs ... One shell I saw explode under the two finest wheel-horses in the troop down they dropped\".{{sfn|Barbero|2006|pp=235\u2013236}}{{sfn|Mercer|1870a|pp=325\u2013326}}\n\nFrench ''tirailleurs'' occupied the dominant positions, especially one on a knoll overlooking the square of the 27th.

Each square was led by a general and Marshal Ney, mounted on his 5th horse of the day, led the advance.{{sfn|Field|2013|pp=191\u2013192}} Behind them, in reserve, were the three battalions of the Old Guard, right to left 1st/2nd Grenadiers, 2nd/2nd Chasseurs and 1st/2nd Chasseurs. Napoleon left Ney to conduct the assault; however, Ney led the Middle Guard on an oblique towards the Anglo-allied centre right instead of attacking straight up the centre. Napoleon sent Ney's senior ADC Colonel Crabb\u00e9 to order Ney to adjust, but Crabb\u00e9 was unable to get there in time.\n\nOther troops rallied to support the advance of the Guard. On the left infantry from Reille's corps that was not engaged with Hougoumont and cavalry advanced. On the right all the now rallied elements of D'\u00c9rlon's corps once again ascended the ridge and engaged the Anglo-allied line. Of these, P\u00e9got's brigade broke into skirmish order and moved north and west of La Haye Sainte and provided fire support to Ney, once again unhorsed, and Friant's 1st/3rd Grenadiers. The Guards first received fire from some Brunswick battalions, but the return fire of the grenadiers forced them to retire. Next, Colin Halket's brigade front line consisting of the 30th Foot and 73rd traded fire but they were driven back in confusion into the 33rd and 69th regiments, Halket was shot in the face and seriously wounded and the whole brigade retreated in a mob. Other Anglo-allied troops began to give way as well. A counterattack by the Nassauers and the remains of Kielmansegge's brigade from the Anglo-allied second line, led by the Prince of Orange, was also thrown back and the Prince of Orange was seriously wounded.

A dynamo requires three things: a [[Electrical conductor|conducting]] liquid, rotation, and [[convection]].

On Earth, convection occurs in the liquid outer layer of the core because the bottom of the liquid layer is much higher in temperature than the top. On Venus, a global resurfacing event may have shut down plate tectonics and led to a reduced heat flux through the crust. This would cause the mantle temperature to increase, thereby reducing the heat flux out of the core. As a result, no internal geodynamo is available to drive a magnetic field. Instead, the heat from the core is being used to reheat the crust.<ref name=\"nimmo02\">{{cite journal |first=Francis |last=Nimmo |date=November 2002 |title=Why does Venus lack a magnetic field? |journal=Geology |volume=30 |issue=11 |pages=987\u2013990 |url=http://www2.ess.ucla.edu/~nimmo/website/paper25.pdf |accessdate=28 June 2009 |doi=10.1130/0091-7613(2002)030<0987:WDVLAM>2.0.CO;2 |issn=0091-7613 |bibcode=2002Geo....30..987N}}</ref>\n\nOne possibility is that Venus has no solid inner core,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Konopliv, A.

Here, ions of hydrogen and oxygen are being created by the dissociation of neutral molecules from ultraviolet radiation. The solar wind then supplies energy that gives some of these ions sufficient velocity to escape Venus's gravity field. This erosion process results in a steady loss of low-mass hydrogen, helium, and oxygen ions, whereas higher-mass molecules, such as carbon dioxide, are more likely to be retained.

Nonetheless, a [[cylinder seal]] from the [[Jemdet Nasr period]] indicates that the ancient [[Sumer]]ians already knew that the morning and evening stars were the same celestial object. The Sumerians associated the planet with the [[goddess]] [[Inanna]] (known as [[Ishtar]] by the later [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]ians and Babylonians), and their myths of Inanna are often allegories for the apparent motions and cycles of the planet.<ref name=Cooley/> In the Old [[Babylonia]]n period, the planet Venus was known as Ninsi'anna, and later as Dilbat.<ref>Enn Kasak, Raul Veede.

On Earth, convection occurs in the liquid outer layer of the core because the bottom of the liquid layer is much higher in temperature than the top. On Venus, a global resurfacing event may have shut down plate tectonics and led to a reduced heat flux through the crust. This would cause the mantle temperature to increase, thereby reducing the heat flux out of the core. As a result, no internal geodynamo is available to drive a magnetic field. Instead, the heat from the core is being used to reheat the crust.<ref name=\"nimmo02\">{{cite journal |first=Francis |last=Nimmo |date=November 2002 |title=Why does Venus lack a magnetic field? |journal=Geology |volume=30 |issue=11 |pages=987\u2013990 |url=http://www2.ess.ucla.edu/~nimmo/website/paper25.pdf |accessdate=28 June 2009 |doi=10.1130/0091-7613(2002)030<0987:WDVLAM>2.0.CO;2 |issn=0091-7613 |bibcode=2002Geo....30..987N}}</ref>\n\nOne possibility is that Venus has no solid inner core,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Konopliv, A.

Here, ions of hydrogen and oxygen are being created by the dissociation of neutral molecules from ultraviolet radiation. The solar wind then supplies energy that gives some of these ions sufficient velocity to escape Venus's gravity field. This erosion process results in a steady loss of low-mass hydrogen, helium, and oxygen ions, whereas higher-mass molecules, such as carbon dioxide, are more likely to be retained.

It met in the [[Stadt Huys]], the [[City Hall]] of [[Albany, New York]] (demolished after a fire in 1836). The original purpose of the Conference was to coordinate relations with the Indians and common defensive measures against the French threat from Canada (see [[French and Indian War#Albany Conference|French and Indian War]]). However, the major topic of discussion at that meeting was the [[Albany Plan]], presented by [[Benjamin Franklin]], delegate from [[Pennsylvania]], setting up a unified (though not independent) government for the colonies. Although the delegates approved the plan (after modifications) unanimously, it was not approved by any of the territorial governments, or by the British government. It was used later in the drafting of the [[Articles of Confederation]].\n* The [[Stamp Act Congress]] (October 7\u201325, 1765), or First Congress of the American Colonies, met in City Hall, later named [[Federal Hall]], in [[New York City]]. Demolished in 1812.\n* The [[Continental Congress]], later called the First Continental Congress (September 5 \u2013 October 26, 1774), embryo of what would become the United States government, met in [[Carpenters' Hall]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], today (2018) part of [[Independence National Historical Park]]. Delegate [[Joseph Galloway]] presented the [[Galloway's Plan of Union|Galloway Plan]] for a unified government, incorporating some elements of the Albany Plan, but it was not accepted.\n* The [[Second Continental Congress]] (1775\u20131781), in which the [[U.S. Declaration of Independence]] was debated and signed, and which starting in 1775 coordinated the [[American Revolutionary War]], met primarily in the Pennsylvania State House, today [[Independence Hall]], in Independence National Historic Park.

Others, like the Iroquois, had long-standing, pre-Columbian traditions of a 'capitol' longhouse where wampum and council fires were maintained with special status. Since they did business with the U.S. Federal Government, these capitals can be seen as officially recognized in some sense.\n\n=== Cherokee Nation ===\n* [[New Echota]] 1825\u20131832\nNew Echota, now near [[Calhoun, Georgia|Calhoun]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] was founded in 1825, realizing the dream and plans of Cherokee Chief [[Major Ridge]]. Major Ridge chose the site because of its centrality in [[Cherokee Nation (1794\u20131907)|the historic Cherokee Nation]] which spanned parts of Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Alabama, and because it was near the confluence of the [[Conasauga River|Conasauga]] and [[Coosawattee River|Coosawattee]] rivers. The town's layout was partly inspired by Ridge's many visits to Washington D.C. and to Baltimore, but also invoked traditional themes of the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex|Southeastern ceremonial complex]]. Complete with the Council House, Supreme Court, [[Cherokee syllabary]] printing press, and the houses of several of the Nation's constitutional officers, New Echota served as the capital until 1832 when the state of Georgia outlawed Native American assembly in an attempt to undermine the Nation. Thousands of Cherokee would gather in New Echota for the annual National Councils, camping along the nearby rivers and holding long [[stomp dance]]s in the park-like woods that were typical of many Southeastern Native American settlements.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n* [[Red Clay State Park|Red Clay]] 1832\u20131838\nThe Cherokee National council grounds were moved to Red Clay, Tennessee on the Georgia state line in order to evade the Georgia state militia. The log cabins, limestone springs and park-like woods of Red Clay served as the capital until the Cherokee Nation was removed to [[Indian Territory]] ([[Oklahoma]]) on the [[Trail of Tears]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Trail of Tears: The Rise and Fall of the Cherokee Nation|last=Ehle|first=John|publisher=Anchor Books Doubleday|year=1988|isbn=0385239548|location=New York|pages=|quote=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/trailoftearsrise00ehle}}</ref> \n* [[Tahlequah, Oklahoma|Tahlequah]] 1839\u20131907, 1938\u2013present\nTahlequah, in present-day Oklahoma, served as the capital of [[Cherokee Nation (1794\u20131907)|the original Cherokee Nation]] after [[Indian removal|Removal]]. After the Civil War, a turbulent period for the Nation which was involved in its own civil war resulting from pervasive anger and disagreements over removal from Georgia, the Cherokee Nation built a new [[Cherokee National Capitol|National Capitol]] in Tahlequah out of brick. The building served as the capitol until 1907, when the [[Dawes Act]] finally dissolved the Cherokee Nation and Tahlequah became the county seat of [[Cherokee County, Oklahoma]]. The Cherokee National government was re-established in 1938 and Tahlequah remains the capital of the modern [[Cherokee Nation]]; it is also the capital of the [[United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians]].\n* [[Cherokee, North Carolina|Cherokee]] 20th century\u2013present ([[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians|Eastern Band of Cherokee]])\nApproximately four to eight hundred Cherokees escaped removal because they lived on a separated tract, purchased later with the help of Confederate Colonel [[William Holland Thomas]], along the [[Oconaluftee River]] deep in the Smoky Mountains of North Carolina. Some Cherokees fleeing the Federal Army sent for the \"round up,\" fled to the remote settlements separated from the rest of the Cherokee Territory in Georgia and North Carolina in order to remain in their homeland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncpedia.org/qualla-boundary|title=Qualla Boundary {{!}} NCpedia|website=www.ncpedia.org|language=en|access-date=September 18, 2017}}</ref> In the 20th century, their descendants organized as the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]]; its capital is at [[Cherokee, North Carolina]], in the tribally-controlled [[Qualla Boundary]].\n\n=== Muscogee Creek Nation ===\n* [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]] c. 1837\u20131866\nAfter Removal from their Alabama-Georgia homeland, the Creek national government met near Hot Springs which was then part of their new territory as prescribed in the Treaty of Cusseta. However, the Union forced the [[Muscogee (Creek) Nation|Creeks]] to cede over {{convert|3000000|acre|ha|adj=on}} acres (half of their land) of what is now Arkansas, after some Creeks fought with the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] in the [[American Civil War]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mcn-nsn.gov/culturehistory/|title=Muscogee Creek Nation -Culture/history|last=|first=|date=|website=Muscogee Creek Nation|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n* [[Okmulgee, Oklahoma|Okmulgee]] 1867\u20131906\nServed as the National capital after the American Civil War. It was probably named after [[Ocmulgee National Monument|Ocmulgee]], on the [[Ocmulgee River|Ocmulgee river]] in [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]], a principle [[Coosa chiefdom|Coosa]] and later [[Muscogee|Creek]] town built with mounds and functioning as part of the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex|Southeastern ceremonial complex]]. However, there were other traditional Creek \"mother-towns\" before removal. The Ocmulgee mounds were ceded illegally in 1821 with the [[Treaty of Indian Springs (1821)|Treaty of Indian Springs]].\n\n=== Iroquois Confederacy ===\n* [[Onondaga Reservation|Onondaga]] (Onondaga privilege c. 1450\u2013present)\nThe [[Iroquois|Iroquois Confederacy]] or '''Haudenosaunee''', which means \"People of the Longhouse,\" was an alliance between the Five and later Six-Nations of Iroquoian language and culture of upstate [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref>{{Citation|last=nysmuseum|title=Haudenosaunee or Iroquois?|date=September 30, 2014|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSXL33JiKLY|accessdate=January 24, 2017}}</ref> These include the [[Seneca people|Seneca]], [[Cayuga people|Cayuga]], [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]], [[Oneida people|Oneida]], [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], and, after 1722, the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] Nations.

Jimerson Town was founded in the 1960s following the formation of the [[Allegheny Reservoir]]. The Senecas also have an administrative longhouse in [[Steamburg, New York|Steamburg]] but do not consider that location to be a capital.\n\n===Navajo Nation===\n* [[Window Rock, Arizona|Window Rock]]\n[[Window Rock]] ([[Navajo language|Navajo]]: ''Ts\u00e9gh\u00e1hoodz\u00e1n\u00ed''), Arizona, is a small city that serves as the seat of government and capital of the [[Navajo Nation]] (1936\u2013present), the largest territory of a sovereign Native American nation in North America. It lies within the boundaries of the St. Michaels Chapter, adjacent to the Arizona and New Mexico state line. Window Rock hosts the Navajo Nation governmental campus which contains the Navajo Nation Council, Navajo Nation Supreme Court, the offices of the Navajo Nation President and Vice President, and many Navajo government buildings.\n\n==Unrecognized national capitals==\nThere have been a handful of nations within the current borders of the United States which were never officially recognized as legally independent sovereign entities; however, these nations did have ''[[de facto]]'' control over their respective regions during their existence.\n\n===Vermont Republic===\nBefore joining the United States as the fourteenth state, Vermont was an independent republic known as the [[Vermont Republic]]. Two cities served as the capital of the Republic:\n*[[Westminster (town), Vermont|Westminster]], 1777\n*[[Windsor, Vermont|Windsor]], 1777\u2013?\n*[[Castleton, Vermont|Castleton]], ?\u20131791\n\nThe current capital of the [[Vermont|State of Vermont]] is [[Montpelier, Vermont|Montpelier]].\n\n===State of Franklin===\nThe [[State of Franklin]] was an autonomous, secessionist United States territory created, not long after the end of the American Revolution, from territory that later was ceded by North Carolina to the federal government. Franklin's territory later became part of the state of Tennessee. Franklin was never officially admitted into the Union of the United States and existed for only four years.\n*[[Jonesborough, Tennessee]], 1784\u2013?\n*[[Greeneville, Tennessee]], 1785?\u2013?\n\n===State of Muskogee===\nThe [[State of Muskogee]] was a short-lived [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] state in Florida, created by the Englishman [[William Augustus Bowles]], who was its \"Director General\", author of its Constitution and designer of its flag.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Landers|first1=Jane|title=Atlantic Creoles in the Age of Revolutions|date=2010|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=London|pages=102\u2013103}}</ref> It consisted of several tribes of [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creeks]] and [[Seminole]]s.

The area was soon seized by the [[United States]] under President [[James Madison]] and incorporated into the [[Territory of Orleans]]. None of the Republic of West Florida was within the boundaries of modern Florida.\n*[[St. Francisville, Louisiana]], 1810\n\n===Republic of Indian Stream===\nThe [[Republic of Indian Stream]] was an unrecognized independent nation within the present state of [[New Hampshire]].\n*The area that would become [[Pittsburg, New Hampshire]], 1832\u20131835\n\n===California Republic===\nBefore being annexed by the United States in 1848 (following the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]), a small portion of north-central California declared itself the [[California Republic]], in an act of independence from Mexico, in 1846 (see [[Bear Flag Revolt]]).  The republic only existed a month before it disbanded itself, to join the advancing American army and therefore became part of the United States.\n\nThe very short-lived California Republic was never recognized by the United States, Mexico or any other nation.  There was one ''[[de facto]]'' capital of the California Republic:\n*[[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]], 1846\n\n===Confederate States===\nThe [[Confederate States of America]] (C.S.A.) had two capitals during its existence. The first capital was established February 4, 1861, in [[History of Montgomery, Alabama#Montgomery in the Civil War|Montgomery]], Alabama, and remained there until it was moved to [[Richmond in the American Civil War|Richmond]], Virginia, on May 29, 1861, after Virginia seceded on May 23.\n\nThe individual state capitals remained the same in the Confederacy as they had been in the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] (U.S.A.), although as the advancing [[Union Army]] used those cities for military districts, some of the Confederate governments were relocated or moved out of state, traveling along with [[Confederate States Army|secessionist armies]].\n\n* [[History of Montgomery, Alabama#Montgomery in the Civil War|Montgomery]], February 4, 1861 \u2013 May 29, 1861\n* [[Richmond in the American Civil War|Richmond]], May 29, 1861 \u2013 April 3, 1865\n\n==Historical state, colonial, and territorial capitals==\nMost of the original [[Thirteen Colonies]] had their capitals occupied or attacked by the British during the [[American Revolutionary War]].  State governments operated where and as they could.  The [[New York City|City of New York]] was occupied by [[British Armed Forces|British troops]] from 1776 to 1783.  A similar situation occurred during the [[War of 1812]], during the [[American Civil War]] in many [[Confederate States of America|Confederate states]], and during the [[Pueblo Revolt]] of 1680&ndash;1692 in [[New Mexico]].\n\nTwenty-two state capitals have been a capital longer than their state has been a state, since they served as the capital of a predecessor territory, colony, or republic. [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], has been a capital city since 1630; it is the oldest continuously-running capital in the United States. [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], is the oldest capital city, having become capital in 1610 and interrupted only by the aforementioned Pueblo Revolt. An even older [[New Spain|Spanish]] city, [[St. Augustine, Florida]], served as a colonial capital from 1565 until about 1820, more than 250 years.\n\nThe table below includes the following information:\n#The state, the year in which statehood was granted, and the state's capital are shown in '''bold''' type.  NOTE: For the first thirteen states, formerly the [[Thirteen Colonies]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] on the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic seaboard]], the year of statehood is shown as 1776 ([[United States Declaration of Independence]]) rather than the subsequent year each state ratified the 1787 [[United States Constitution]]. (See [[List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union]].) \n#The year listed for each capital is the starting date; the ending date is the starting date for the successor unless otherwise indicated.\n#In many cases, capital cities of historical jurisdictions were outside of a state's present borders. (Those cities are generally indicated with the [[List of U.S. state abbreviations|two-letter abbreviation]] for the [[U.S. state]] in which the former administrative capital is now located.)\n{{clear}}\n<!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: This section consists of a complex table.

In 1881, the [[Arkansas General Assembly]] passed the following concurrent resolution (Arkansas Statutes, Title 1, Chapter 4, Section 105):\n<blockquote>Whereas, confusion of practice has arisen in the pronunciation of the name of our state and it is deemed important that the true pronunciation should be determined for use in oral official proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>And, whereas, the matter has been thoroughly investigated by the State Historical Society and the Eclectic Society of Little Rock, which have agreed upon the correct pronunciation as derived from history, and the early usage of the American immigrants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Be it therefore resolved by both houses of the General Assembly, that the only true pronunciation of the name of the state, in the opinion of this body, is that received by the French from the Native Americans and committed to writing in the French word representing the sound. It should be pronounced in three (3) syllables, with the final \"s\" silent, the \"a\" in each syllable with the Italian sound, and the accent on the first and last syllables. The pronunciation with the accent on the second syllable with the sound of \"a\" in \"man\" and the sounding of the terminal \"s\" is an innovation to be discouraged.</blockquote>\nCitizens of the [[Kansas|State of Kansas]] often pronounce the [[Arkansas River]] {{IPAc-en|\u0251r|\u02c8|k|\u00e6|n|z|\u0259|s}} in a manner similar to the common pronunciation of the name of their state.</ref>\n|-\n|rowspan=2|'''[[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]]'''||1821\n|-\n|'''1836'''||'''Capital of the [[Arkansas|State of Arkansas]]'''.<ref name=Arkansas/><br />([[Washington, Arkansas|Washington]] was the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] state capital 1863\u20131865.)\n|- style=\"border-top: solid 2px #000\"\n|rowspan=10|'''[[California]]'''<ref>{{cite book\n|editor-last=Ebbert\n|editor-first=Brian S.\n|author=E.

Each [[U.S. state]] has its own capital city, as do many of its [[insular area]]s. Most states have not changed their capital city since becoming a state, but the capital cities of their respective preceding colonies, territories, kingdoms, and republics typically changed multiple times. There have also been other governments within the current borders of the United States with their own capitals, such as the Republic of Texas, Native American nations, and other unrecognized governments.\n\n==Capitals of the US==\n[[File:Albany Congress.jpeg|thumb|The [[Albany Congress]] of 1754 was a conference attended by seven colonies, which presaged later efforts at cooperation. Mural in the U.S. Capitol. The two figures at left are [[William Franklin]] and his father [[Benjamin Franklin|Benjamin]]]]\n* The [[Albany Conference]] (June 18 \u2013 July 11, 1754), or \"The Conference of Albany\", was the first meeting at which representatives of British colonies in North America (seven of them) gathered to discuss questions of common interest. It met in the [[Stadt Huys]], the [[City Hall]] of [[Albany, New York]] (demolished after a fire in 1836). The original purpose of the Conference was to coordinate relations with the Indians and common defensive measures against the French threat from Canada (see [[French and Indian War#Albany Conference|French and Indian War]]). However, the major topic of discussion at that meeting was the [[Albany Plan]], presented by [[Benjamin Franklin]], delegate from [[Pennsylvania]], setting up a unified (though not independent) government for the colonies. Although the delegates approved the plan (after modifications) unanimously, it was not approved by any of the territorial governments, or by the British government. It was used later in the drafting of the [[Articles of Confederation]].\n* The [[Stamp Act Congress]] (October 7\u201325, 1765), or First Congress of the American Colonies, met in City Hall, later named [[Federal Hall]], in [[New York City]]. Demolished in 1812.\n* The [[Continental Congress]], later called the First Continental Congress (September 5 \u2013 October 26, 1774), embryo of what would become the United States government, met in [[Carpenters' Hall]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], today (2018) part of [[Independence National Historical Park]]. Delegate [[Joseph Galloway]] presented the [[Galloway's Plan of Union|Galloway Plan]] for a unified government, incorporating some elements of the Albany Plan, but it was not accepted.\n* The [[Second Continental Congress]] (1775\u20131781), in which the [[U.S. Declaration of Independence]] was debated and signed, and which starting in 1775 coordinated the [[American Revolutionary War]], met primarily in the Pennsylvania State House, today [[Independence Hall]], in Independence National Historic Park. The room as it was then is inaccurately depicted<ref>https://www.aoc.gov/art/historic-rotunda-paintings/declaration-independence</ref> in the famous painting [[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|''Declaration of Independence'']] by [[John Trumbull]], commissioned by Congress, which has hung in the [[U.S. Capitol Rotunda]] since 1825. The [[Articles of Confederation]], though drafted in [[York, Pennsylvania]], were adopted in Philadelphia in 1777, subject to the states' approval. The Second Continental Congress also met briefly in the following locations:\n**[[Henry Fite House]], [[Baltimore, Maryland]]: December 20, 1776, to February 27, 1777, to avoid capture by British forces. The building was destroyed by fire in 1904.\n** Court House, [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]]: September 27, 1777 (one day)\n** Court House, [[York, Pennsylvania]]: September 30, 1777, to June 2, 1778\n** College Hall, [[College of Philadelphia]]: July 2, 1778, to July 20, 1778<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unitedstatescapitals.org/p/college-hall.html|title=United States Capitols|publisher=}}</ref>\n* The [[Congress of the Confederation]] (1781\u20131789) did not have an official capital. It met in the following locations:\n** Independence Hall, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: March 1, 1781, to June 21, 1783 (In 1783, Congress moved from Philadelphia after a soldiers' riot.

This led to the establishment of the [[History of the District of Columbia|District of Columbia]] and the founding of Washington as the nation's capital. Until the Capitol building was completed, and after it was [[Burning of Washington|burned by the British]] in 1814, requiring its rebuilding, Congress met in various places:\n**[[Federal Hall]], New York City, New York: March 4, 1789, to December 5, 1790.

Others, like the Iroquois, had long-standing, pre-Columbian traditions of a 'capitol' longhouse where wampum and council fires were maintained with special status. Since they did business with the U.S. Federal Government, these capitals can be seen as officially recognized in some sense.\n\n=== Cherokee Nation ===\n* [[New Echota]] 1825\u20131832\nNew Echota, now near [[Calhoun, Georgia|Calhoun]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] was founded in 1825, realizing the dream and plans of Cherokee Chief [[Major Ridge]]. Major Ridge chose the site because of its centrality in [[Cherokee Nation (1794\u20131907)|the historic Cherokee Nation]] which spanned parts of Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Alabama, and because it was near the confluence of the [[Conasauga River|Conasauga]] and [[Coosawattee River|Coosawattee]] rivers. The town's layout was partly inspired by Ridge's many visits to Washington D.C. and to Baltimore, but also invoked traditional themes of the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex|Southeastern ceremonial complex]]. Complete with the Council House, Supreme Court, [[Cherokee syllabary]] printing press, and the houses of several of the Nation's constitutional officers, New Echota served as the capital until 1832 when the state of Georgia outlawed Native American assembly in an attempt to undermine the Nation. Thousands of Cherokee would gather in New Echota for the annual National Councils, camping along the nearby rivers and holding long [[stomp dance]]s in the park-like woods that were typical of many Southeastern Native American settlements.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n* [[Red Clay State Park|Red Clay]] 1832\u20131838\nThe Cherokee National council grounds were moved to Red Clay, Tennessee on the Georgia state line in order to evade the Georgia state militia. The log cabins, limestone springs and park-like woods of Red Clay served as the capital until the Cherokee Nation was removed to [[Indian Territory]] ([[Oklahoma]]) on the [[Trail of Tears]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Trail of Tears: The Rise and Fall of the Cherokee Nation|last=Ehle|first=John|publisher=Anchor Books Doubleday|year=1988|isbn=0385239548|location=New York|pages=|quote=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/trailoftearsrise00ehle}}</ref> \n* [[Tahlequah, Oklahoma|Tahlequah]] 1839\u20131907, 1938\u2013present\nTahlequah, in present-day Oklahoma, served as the capital of [[Cherokee Nation (1794\u20131907)|the original Cherokee Nation]] after [[Indian removal|Removal]]. After the Civil War, a turbulent period for the Nation which was involved in its own civil war resulting from pervasive anger and disagreements over removal from Georgia, the Cherokee Nation built a new [[Cherokee National Capitol|National Capitol]] in Tahlequah out of brick. The building served as the capitol until 1907, when the [[Dawes Act]] finally dissolved the Cherokee Nation and Tahlequah became the county seat of [[Cherokee County, Oklahoma]]. The Cherokee National government was re-established in 1938 and Tahlequah remains the capital of the modern [[Cherokee Nation]]; it is also the capital of the [[United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians]].\n* [[Cherokee, North Carolina|Cherokee]] 20th century\u2013present ([[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians|Eastern Band of Cherokee]])\nApproximately four to eight hundred Cherokees escaped removal because they lived on a separated tract, purchased later with the help of Confederate Colonel [[William Holland Thomas]], along the [[Oconaluftee River]] deep in the Smoky Mountains of North Carolina. Some Cherokees fleeing the Federal Army sent for the \"round up,\" fled to the remote settlements separated from the rest of the Cherokee Territory in Georgia and North Carolina in order to remain in their homeland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncpedia.org/qualla-boundary|title=Qualla Boundary {{!}} NCpedia|website=www.ncpedia.org|language=en|access-date=September 18, 2017}}</ref> In the 20th century, their descendants organized as the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]]; its capital is at [[Cherokee, North Carolina]], in the tribally-controlled [[Qualla Boundary]].\n\n=== Muscogee Creek Nation ===\n* [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]] c. 1837\u20131866\nAfter Removal from their Alabama-Georgia homeland, the Creek national government met near Hot Springs which was then part of their new territory as prescribed in the Treaty of Cusseta. However, the Union forced the [[Muscogee (Creek) Nation|Creeks]] to cede over {{convert|3000000|acre|ha|adj=on}} acres (half of their land) of what is now Arkansas, after some Creeks fought with the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] in the [[American Civil War]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mcn-nsn.gov/culturehistory/|title=Muscogee Creek Nation -Culture/history|last=|first=|date=|website=Muscogee Creek Nation|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n* [[Okmulgee, Oklahoma|Okmulgee]] 1867\u20131906\nServed as the National capital after the American Civil War. It was probably named after [[Ocmulgee National Monument|Ocmulgee]], on the [[Ocmulgee River|Ocmulgee river]] in [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]], a principle [[Coosa chiefdom|Coosa]] and later [[Muscogee|Creek]] town built with mounds and functioning as part of the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex|Southeastern ceremonial complex]]. However, there were other traditional Creek \"mother-towns\" before removal. The Ocmulgee mounds were ceded illegally in 1821 with the [[Treaty of Indian Springs (1821)|Treaty of Indian Springs]].\n\n=== Iroquois Confederacy ===\n* [[Onondaga Reservation|Onondaga]] (Onondaga privilege c. 1450\u2013present)\nThe [[Iroquois|Iroquois Confederacy]] or '''Haudenosaunee''', which means \"People of the Longhouse,\" was an alliance between the Five and later Six-Nations of Iroquoian language and culture of upstate [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref>{{Citation|last=nysmuseum|title=Haudenosaunee or Iroquois?|date=September 30, 2014|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSXL33JiKLY|accessdate=January 24, 2017}}</ref> These include the [[Seneca people|Seneca]], [[Cayuga people|Cayuga]], [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]], [[Oneida people|Oneida]], [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], and, after 1722, the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] Nations.

Jimerson Town was founded in the 1960s following the formation of the [[Allegheny Reservoir]]. The Senecas also have an administrative longhouse in [[Steamburg, New York|Steamburg]] but do not consider that location to be a capital.\n\n===Navajo Nation===\n* [[Window Rock, Arizona|Window Rock]]\n[[Window Rock]] ([[Navajo language|Navajo]]: ''Ts\u00e9gh\u00e1hoodz\u00e1n\u00ed''), Arizona, is a small city that serves as the seat of government and capital of the [[Navajo Nation]] (1936\u2013present), the largest territory of a sovereign Native American nation in North America. It lies within the boundaries of the St. Michaels Chapter, adjacent to the Arizona and New Mexico state line. Window Rock hosts the Navajo Nation governmental campus which contains the Navajo Nation Council, Navajo Nation Supreme Court, the offices of the Navajo Nation President and Vice President, and many Navajo government buildings.\n\n==Unrecognized national capitals==\nThere have been a handful of nations within the current borders of the United States which were never officially recognized as legally independent sovereign entities; however, these nations did have ''[[de facto]]'' control over their respective regions during their existence.\n\n===Vermont Republic===\nBefore joining the United States as the fourteenth state, Vermont was an independent republic known as the [[Vermont Republic]]. Two cities served as the capital of the Republic:\n*[[Westminster (town), Vermont|Westminster]], 1777\n*[[Windsor, Vermont|Windsor]], 1777\u2013?\n*[[Castleton, Vermont|Castleton]], ?\u20131791\n\nThe current capital of the [[Vermont|State of Vermont]] is [[Montpelier, Vermont|Montpelier]].\n\n===State of Franklin===\nThe [[State of Franklin]] was an autonomous, secessionist United States territory created, not long after the end of the American Revolution, from territory that later was ceded by North Carolina to the federal government. Franklin's territory later became part of the state of Tennessee. Franklin was never officially admitted into the Union of the United States and existed for only four years.\n*[[Jonesborough, Tennessee]], 1784\u2013?\n*[[Greeneville, Tennessee]], 1785?\u2013?\n\n===State of Muskogee===\nThe [[State of Muskogee]] was a short-lived [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] state in Florida, created by the Englishman [[William Augustus Bowles]], who was its \"Director General\", author of its Constitution and designer of its flag.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Landers|first1=Jane|title=Atlantic Creoles in the Age of Revolutions|date=2010|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=London|pages=102\u2013103}}</ref> It consisted of several tribes of [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creeks]] and [[Seminole]]s.

The area was soon seized by the [[United States]] under President [[James Madison]] and incorporated into the [[Territory of Orleans]]. None of the Republic of West Florida was within the boundaries of modern Florida.\n*[[St. Francisville, Louisiana]], 1810\n\n===Republic of Indian Stream===\nThe [[Republic of Indian Stream]] was an unrecognized independent nation within the present state of [[New Hampshire]].\n*The area that would become [[Pittsburg, New Hampshire]], 1832\u20131835\n\n===California Republic===\nBefore being annexed by the United States in 1848 (following the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]), a small portion of north-central California declared itself the [[California Republic]], in an act of independence from Mexico, in 1846 (see [[Bear Flag Revolt]]).  The republic only existed a month before it disbanded itself, to join the advancing American army and therefore became part of the United States.\n\nThe very short-lived California Republic was never recognized by the United States, Mexico or any other nation.  There was one ''[[de facto]]'' capital of the California Republic:\n*[[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]], 1846\n\n===Confederate States===\nThe [[Confederate States of America]] (C.S.A.) had two capitals during its existence. The first capital was established February 4, 1861, in [[History of Montgomery, Alabama#Montgomery in the Civil War|Montgomery]], Alabama, and remained there until it was moved to [[Richmond in the American Civil War|Richmond]], Virginia, on May 29, 1861, after Virginia seceded on May 23.\n\nThe individual state capitals remained the same in the Confederacy as they had been in the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] (U.S.A.), although as the advancing [[Union Army]] used those cities for military districts, some of the Confederate governments were relocated or moved out of state, traveling along with [[Confederate States Army|secessionist armies]].\n\n* [[History of Montgomery, Alabama#Montgomery in the Civil War|Montgomery]], February 4, 1861 \u2013 May 29, 1861\n* [[Richmond in the American Civil War|Richmond]], May 29, 1861 \u2013 April 3, 1865\n\n==Historical state, colonial, and territorial capitals==\nMost of the original [[Thirteen Colonies]] had their capitals occupied or attacked by the British during the [[American Revolutionary War]].  State governments operated where and as they could.  The [[New York City|City of New York]] was occupied by [[British Armed Forces|British troops]] from 1776 to 1783.  A similar situation occurred during the [[War of 1812]], during the [[American Civil War]] in many [[Confederate States of America|Confederate states]], and during the [[Pueblo Revolt]] of 1680&ndash;1692 in [[New Mexico]].\n\nTwenty-two state capitals have been a capital longer than their state has been a state, since they served as the capital of a predecessor territory, colony, or republic. [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], has been a capital city since 1630; it is the oldest continuously-running capital in the United States. [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], is the oldest capital city, having become capital in 1610 and interrupted only by the aforementioned Pueblo Revolt. An even older [[New Spain|Spanish]] city, [[St. Augustine, Florida]], served as a colonial capital from 1565 until about 1820, more than 250 years.\n\nThe table below includes the following information:\n#The state, the year in which statehood was granted, and the state's capital are shown in '''bold''' type.  NOTE: For the first thirteen states, formerly the [[Thirteen Colonies]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] on the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic seaboard]], the year of statehood is shown as 1776 ([[United States Declaration of Independence]]) rather than the subsequent year each state ratified the 1787 [[United States Constitution]]. (See [[List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union]].) \n#The year listed for each capital is the starting date; the ending date is the starting date for the successor unless otherwise indicated.\n#In many cases, capital cities of historical jurisdictions were outside of a state's present borders. (Those cities are generally indicated with the [[List of U.S. state abbreviations|two-letter abbreviation]] for the [[U.S. state]] in which the former administrative capital is now located.)\n{{clear}}\n<!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: This section consists of a complex table.

In 1881, the [[Arkansas General Assembly]] passed the following concurrent resolution (Arkansas Statutes, Title 1, Chapter 4, Section 105):\n<blockquote>Whereas, confusion of practice has arisen in the pronunciation of the name of our state and it is deemed important that the true pronunciation should be determined for use in oral official proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>And, whereas, the matter has been thoroughly investigated by the State Historical Society and the Eclectic Society of Little Rock, which have agreed upon the correct pronunciation as derived from history, and the early usage of the American immigrants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Be it therefore resolved by both houses of the General Assembly, that the only true pronunciation of the name of the state, in the opinion of this body, is that received by the French from the Native Americans and committed to writing in the French word representing the sound. It should be pronounced in three (3) syllables, with the final \"s\" silent, the \"a\" in each syllable with the Italian sound, and the accent on the first and last syllables. The pronunciation with the accent on the second syllable with the sound of \"a\" in \"man\" and the sounding of the terminal \"s\" is an innovation to be discouraged.</blockquote>\nCitizens of the [[Kansas|State of Kansas]] often pronounce the [[Arkansas River]] {{IPAc-en|\u0251r|\u02c8|k|\u00e6|n|z|\u0259|s}} in a manner similar to the common pronunciation of the name of their state.</ref>\n|-\n|rowspan=2|'''[[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]]'''||1821\n|-\n|'''1836'''||'''Capital of the [[Arkansas|State of Arkansas]]'''.<ref name=Arkansas/><br />([[Washington, Arkansas|Washington]] was the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] state capital 1863\u20131865.)\n|- style=\"border-top: solid 2px #000\"\n|rowspan=10|'''[[California]]'''<ref>{{cite book\n|editor-last=Ebbert\n|editor-first=Brian S.\n|author=E.

Teaching from [[pre-kindergarten]] through to twelfth grade, it is located on Manhattan's [[Upper East Side]] at East 91st Street and [[Fifth Avenue]]. However, this one is indeed for the boys with the booming system. Those top down, air conditioner with the cooling system. When he does come up into the club, he is blazing up. He has stacks on deck like he is saving up. He is real, he is ill, he might have acquired a deal. He is frigid, he is dope, however he might sell Coca Cola\u00ae\ufe0f. \n\nThe school is housed in the former [[Otto H. Kahn House]] and [[James A. Burden House]], both of which are [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|New York City-Designated Landmark]]s, and are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\n==History==\nFounded in 1881 by the [[Society of the Sacred Heart]], a [[Religious congregation|Roman Catholic congregation]] established in [[France]] in 1800, the school is New York City's oldest private school for girls. The school was originally housed in a Manhattan [[brownstone]] on [[Madison Avenue]] at [[54th Street (Manhattan)|East 54th Street]].\n\nBy the 1930s, the school had outgrown its Madison Avenue space and moved into the Kahn mansion.  In 1940, the Society acquired the Burden mansion next door.\n\n==Membership and accreditation==\nIn addition to being a member of the Society of the Sacred Heart and a part of the global [[Schools of the Sacred Heart|Network of Sacred Heart Schools]], a worldwide network of over 150 schools committed to the mission of a Sacred Heart education, the school is accredited by the [[New York State Association of Independent Schools]] and is a member of the [[National Association of Independent Schools]].\n\nIt is operated independently as part of the Network of Sacred Heart Schools. The school is also associated with the [[New York Interschool|New York Interschool Association]].\n\nSacred Heart is accredited by the New York State Association of Independent Schools (NYSAIS).  It is a member of the National Association of Independent Schools, the Independent Schools Association of Greater New York, the National Coalition of Girls\u2019 Schools, the European Council of International Schools, the International Schools Association and the Network of Sacred Heart Schools in the United States.\n\n==Facilities==\nSacred Heart is located in two historic mansions in the [[Carnegie Hill Historic District]] on the [[Upper East Side]] of [[Manhattan]], at 1 East 91st Street and 7 East 91st Street, next to  [[Central Park]]/5th Avenue and across the street from the [[Cooper-Hewitt Museum]].\n\n*1 East 91st Street ([[Otto H.

Kahn House]] and [[James A. Burden House]], both of which are [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|New York City-Designated Landmark]]s, and are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\n==History==\nFounded in 1881 by the [[Society of the Sacred Heart]], a [[Religious congregation|Roman Catholic congregation]] established in [[France]] in 1800, the school is New York City's oldest private school for girls. The school was originally housed in a Manhattan [[brownstone]] on [[Madison Avenue]] at [[54th Street (Manhattan)|East 54th Street]].\n\nBy the 1930s, the school had outgrown its Madison Avenue space and moved into the Kahn mansion.  In 1940, the Society acquired the Burden mansion next door.\n\n==Membership and accreditation==\nIn addition to being a member of the Society of the Sacred Heart and a part of the global [[Schools of the Sacred Heart|Network of Sacred Heart Schools]], a worldwide network of over 150 schools committed to the mission of a Sacred Heart education, the school is accredited by the [[New York State Association of Independent Schools]] and is a member of the [[National Association of Independent Schools]].\n\nIt is operated independently as part of the Network of Sacred Heart Schools. The school is also associated with the [[New York Interschool|New York Interschool Association]].\n\nSacred Heart is accredited by the New York State Association of Independent Schools (NYSAIS).  It is a member of the National Association of Independent Schools, the Independent Schools Association of Greater New York, the National Coalition of Girls\u2019 Schools, the European Council of International Schools, the International Schools Association and the Network of Sacred Heart Schools in the United States.\n\n==Facilities==\nSacred Heart is located in two historic mansions in the [[Carnegie Hill Historic District]] on the [[Upper East Side]] of [[Manhattan]], at 1 East 91st Street and 7 East 91st Street, next to  [[Central Park]]/5th Avenue and across the street from the [[Cooper-Hewitt Museum]].\n\n*1 East 91st Street ([[Otto H.

web|url=http://www.nwslsoccer.com/rules-regulations|title=Rules & Regulations|publisher=NWSL}}</ref> going down the list until all teams are ranked.\n\n# Head to Head win/loss record between the teams

teams).\n# Apply #1\u20133 to games played on the road.\n# Apply #1\u20133 to games played at home.\n# If teams are still equal, ranking will be determined by a coin toss.\nNOTE: If two clubs remain

women's soccer in the United States. Including the NWSL's two professional predecessors, [[Women's Professional Soccer]] (2009\u20132011) and the [[Women's United Soccer Association]] (2001\u20132003), it was the eleventh overall season of FIFA- and USSF-sanctioned top-division women's soccer in the United States. The league is operated by the [[United States Soccer Federation]] and receives major financial backing from that body. Further financial backing is provided by the [[Canadian Soccer Association]]; both national federations pay the league salaries of many of their respective national team members in an effort to nurture talent in those nations.\n\nThe reigning champions [[Western New York Flash]] did not play under that name; the franchise was sold, relocated to [[Cary, North Carolina]] and rebranded as the [[North Carolina Courage]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Yang|first1=Stephanie|title=Western New York Flash sold, will move to North Carolina|url=https://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2017/1/6/14186554/western-new-york-flash-nwsl-sold-north-carolina-fc-ownership|publisher=SB Nation|accessdate=13 January 2017}}</ref> \n\nAfter schedule disruptions in the previous two years caused by the [[2015 FIFA Women's World Cup]] and the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], NWSL teams in 2017 once again played 24 games, a schedule last played during the [[2014 National Women's Soccer League season|2014 season]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lineman|first1=Meg|title=The top 10 things you need to know from the NWSL Draft|url=http://www.excellesports.com/news/the-top-10-things-you-need-to-know-from-the-nwsl-draft/|accessdate=13 January 2017|publisher=Excelle Sports|date=12 January 2017}}</ref> The Courage won the [[NWSL Shield]] (the regular season), topping the [[Portland Thorns FC|Portland Thorns]] by two points.\n\nThe [[NWSL Playoffs|NWSL Playoff]] semifinals were held October 7\u20138, 2017, and were won by the Thorns and the Courage.

teams).\n# Apply #1\u20133 to games played on the road.\n# Apply #1\u20133 to games played at home.\n# If teams are still equal, ranking will be determined by a coin toss.\nNOTE: If two clubs remain

Including the NWSL's two professional predecessors, [[Women's Professional Soccer]] (2009\u20132011) and the [[Women's United Soccer Association]] (2001\u20132003), it was the tenth overall season of FIFA and USSF-sanctioned top division women's soccer in the United States. The league is operated by the [[United States Soccer Federation]] and receives major financial backing from that body. Further financial backing is expected to be provided by the [[Canadian Soccer Association]]. Both national federations pay the league salaries of many of their respective national team members in an effort to nurture talent in those nations.\n\nTo accommodate the [[Football at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament|2016 Olympics]] the league suspended play for most of the month of August.  In addition, the league did not schedule games during FIFA windows, leaving the 20-game, 19-week regular season ending in late September for the second year in a row.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nwslsoccer.com/home/907239.html|title=NWSL ANNOUNCES FULL 2016 SCHEDULE|date=February 18, 2016|accessdate=February 18, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222011844/http://www.nwslsoccer.com/home/907239.html|archive-date=February 22, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Teams, stadiums, and personnel ==\n\n=== Stadiums and locations ===\n{{see also|List of National Women's Soccer League stadiums}}\n\nTwo teams, the Dash and Reign, do not make their stadiums' entire capacity available for home games, instead restricting ticket sales at a lower level.

Women's Soccer League, the top division of women's soccer in the United States. Including the NWSL's two professional predecessors, [[Women's Professional Soccer]] (2009\u20132011) and the [[Women's United Soccer Association]] (2001\u20132003), it was the tenth overall season of FIFA and USSF-sanctioned top division women's soccer in the United States. The league is operated by the [[United States Soccer Federation]] and receives major financial backing from that body. Further financial backing is expected to be provided by the [[Canadian Soccer Association]]. Both national federations pay the league salaries of many of their respective national team members in an effort to nurture talent in those nations.\n\nTo accommodate the [[Football at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament|2016 Olympics]] the league suspended play for most of the month of August.  In addition, the league did not schedule games during FIFA windows, leaving the 20-game, 19-week regular season ending in late September for the second year in a row.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nwslsoccer.com/home/907239.html|title=NWSL ANNOUNCES FULL 2016 SCHEDULE|date=February 18, 2016|accessdate=February 18, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222011844/http://www.nwslsoccer.com/home/907239.html|archive-date=February 22, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Teams, stadiums, and personnel ==\n\n=== Stadiums and locations ===\n{{see also|List of National Women's Soccer League stadiums}}\n\nTwo teams, the Dash and Reign, do not make their stadiums' entire capacity available for home games, instead restricting ticket sales at a lower level.

The university consists of the College of Arts and Sciences, Freeman College of Management, and the College of Engineering. Bucknell was founded in 1846, and features programs in the arts, humanities, sciences, social sciences, engineering, management, education, and music, as well as programs and pre-professional advising that prepare students for study in law and medicine. It offers nearly 50 majors and over 60 minors. South of central Lewisburg, the {{convert|445|acre|km2|adj=on}} campus is along the west bank of the [[West Branch Susquehanna River|West Branch]] of the [[Susquehanna River]], at an [[elevation]] of {{convert|530|ft|round=5}} above [[sea level]].\n\nPrimarily an undergraduate school (with about 3,600 students), Bucknell has about 50 graduate students.

The charter for the University at Lewisburg, granted by the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly]] and approved by the governor on February 5, 1846, carried one stipulation\u2013that $100,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100000|1846|r=-5}}}} today) be raised before the new institution would be granted full [[Incorporation (business)|corporate status]]. More than 4,000 subscribers ultimately contributed, including a small boy who gave 12 cents (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|0.12|1846|r=0}}}} today).\n\nIn 1846, the \"school preparatory to the University\" opened in the basement of the [[First Baptist Church (Lewisburg, Pennsylvania)|First Baptist Church]] in Lewisburg. Known originally as the Lewisburg High School, it became in 1848 the Academic and Primary Department of the University at Lewisburg.<ref>[http://www.bucknell.edu/x1177.xml The Early Years] Bucknell University.</ref>\n\nIn 1850, the department moved into the first building completed on campus, now called Taylor Hall. Built for $8,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|8000|1850|r=-4}}}} today), the building housed both women's and men's studies until the opening of the Female Institute in 1852. While studying together, women were required to face east while men faced west.\n\nThe school's first commencement was held on August 20, 1851, for a graduation class of seven men. Among the board members attending was [[James Buchanan]], who would become the 15th President of the United States. Stephen Taylor officiated as his last act before assuming office as president of Madison University. One day earlier, the trustees had elected [[Howard Malcom]] as the first president of the university, a post he held for six years.\n\n===Female Institute===\n[[Image:Bucknell University, 1870s.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Bucknell University in the 1870s]]\nAlthough the Female Institute began instruction in 1852, it wasn't until 1883 that college courses were opened to [[women]]. Bucknell, though, was committed to equal educational opportunities for women.\n\nThis commitment was reflected in the words of [[David Jayne Hill]] of the Class of 1874, and president of the university from 1879 to 1888: \"We need in Pennsylvania, in the geographical centre of the state, a University, not in the German but in the American sense, where every branch of non-professional knowledge can be pursued, regardless of distinction of sex. I have no well-matured plan to announce as to the sexes; but the Principal of the Female Seminary proposes to inaugurate a course for females equal to that pursued at [[Vassar College|Vassar]]; the two sexes having equal advantages, though not reciting together.\"<ref>[http://www.bucknell.edu/x1178.xml The Female Institute] Bucknell University.</ref>\n\nWithin five years of opening, enrollment had grown so sharply that the university built a new hall\u2013Larison Hall\u2013to accommodate the Female Institute. Women could venture into town only in the company of a female teacher who had a minimum of six years' experience in handling girls.\n\n===Benefactor William Bucknell===\nIn 1881, facing dire financial circumstances, the university turned to [[William Bucknell]], a [[charter member]] of the [[board of trustees]], for help. His donation of $50,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50000|1881|r=-4}}}} today) saved the university from ruin. In 1886, in recognition of Bucknell's support of the school, the trustees voted unanimously to change the name of the University at Lewisburg to Bucknell University.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brackney|first1=William H.|title=Congregation and Campus: North American Baptists in Higher Education|date=2008|publisher=Mercer University Press|location=Macon, Georgia|isbn=978-0-88146-130-5|page=206|edition=1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wq8w4rJ4Am8C&pg=PA277&q=john%20p.%20crozer|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref> Bucknell Hall, the first of several buildings given to the university by Bucknell, was initially a [[chapel]] and for more than a half century the site of student theatrical and musical performances.

When [[the Depression]] brought a drop in enrollment in 1933, several members of the faculty were \"loaned\" to found a new institution: Bucknell Junior College in [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]]. Today, that institution is a four-year university, [[Wilkes University]], independent of Bucknell since 1947.\n\nSignificant new construction in the 1970s included the Elaine Langone Center, the Gerhard Fieldhouse, and the Computer Center. During the early 1980s, the capacity of the Bertrand Library was doubled and facilities for engineering were substantially renovated. In 1988, the Weis Center for the Performing Arts was completed.\n\nNew facilities for the sciences included the renovation of the Olin Science Building, the construction of the Rooke Chemistry Building in 1990 and the completion of a new Biology Building in 1991. The McDonnell Residence Hall and Weis Music Building were completed in 2000. In addition, the O'Leary Building for Psychology and Geology opened in the fall of 2002 and the new Kenneth Langone Recreational Athletic Center opened during the 2002\u201303 academic year. The newest engineering facility, the Breakiron Engineering Building, opened in 2004.<ref>[http://www.bucknell.edu/x1182.xml Continued Expansion] Bucknell University.</ref>\n\nAcademic West opened in fall 2013.

Academic East was inaugurated in 2019. It houses the Department of Education and programs in the College of Engineering. A new building that will house the Freeman College of Management and the Department of Art and Art History is currently under construction. \n\n==Campus==\n[[File:Cherry blossoms on academic quad.jpg|thumb|left|Cherry blossoms in April on the Academic Quad with Bertrand Library in the background.]]Bucknell's {{convert|450|acre|ha|adj=on}} campus comprises more than 100 buildings that range over a gentle rise adjacent to the [[West Branch Susquehanna River]]. The campus is divided into Lower Campus and Upper Campus by [[Miller Run]] and the Grove, a stand of oak trees that ascends the slope. Lower campus consists primarily of student housing and the university's sports facilities. Upper campus consists primarily of academic buildings. It offers views northwest across the Buffalo Valley toward Nittany Mountain and southeast across the [[Susquehanna River]] toward Montour Ridge.\n\nBucknell's campus forms a cohesive architectural ensemble due to the sustained use of brick and the recurrent themes of Georgian style. The university's first building, Taylor Hall, was constructed in 1848.<ref>[http://www.bucknell.edu/info-about-attending-bucknell/visit-bucknell/the-bucknell-campus.html \"The Bucknell Campus\"] University website.

Attached to the chapel is a one-story wing, which houses the Office of Religious Life, the Chaplain's office, a meditation chapel and kitchen. The chapel was dedicated on October 25, 1964. The chapel was a gift of the late Robert L. Rooke, an alumnus of the class of 1913 and a member of the university's board of trustees. The chapel is named in memory of Mr. Rooke's parents. The main portion of the chapel includes the [[narthex]], sanctuary, chancel area, organ chamber, choir rooms, and balconies that surround the sanctuary on three sides. Approximately 850 persons can be seated in the sanctuary and balconies.<ref>[http://www.bucknell.edu/x4676.xml Charles M. and Olive S.

The school guarantees on-campus housing for all four years.\n\nThe campus is roughly divided into \"uphill\" and \"downhill\" areas by a large slope between Moore Avenue and Dent Drive. The uphill area flanks [[U.S. Route 15]] and the [[West Branch Susquehanna River]] and features many of the academic buildings, including the main academic quadrangle, the Observatory, and library as well as some dormitories, [[Christy Mathewson\u2013Memorial Stadium]], and Fraternity Road. Downhill borders the [[Victorian-era]] neighborhoods of downtown Lewisburg and features mainly residential buildings, including the majority of first-year dormitories, the Gateway apartment complex, the President's house, many of the indoor athletic facilities, and Hunt Hall, home to the school's sororities. Bucknell West, which is separated from the rest of campus by Route 15, features some housing, athletic fields, art and psychology/animal behavior laboratories, and an 18-hole golf course.\n\nAll on-campus students must purchase a campus meal plan. There are several dining options on campus for students, including the Bostwick Cafeteria, Bison snack bar, and Terrace Room in the Langone Student Center, and the Library and 7th Street Cafe.

Downtown Lewisburg is a short walking distance from the campus and features a variety of shops, museums, galleries, and restaurants in addition to old-fashioned [[gingerbread house]]s.\n\nSpratt House is the home of the university's Army Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) program.\n\nBucknell's student newspaper, ''[[The Bucknellian]]'', is printed weekly. Its radio station is [[WVBU-FM]].\n\nBucknell has active religious life involvement on campus.

The charter for the University at Lewisburg, granted by the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly]] and approved by the governor on February 5, 1846, carried one stipulation\u2013that $100,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100000|1846|r=-5}}}} today) be raised before the new institution would be granted full [[Incorporation (business)|corporate status]]. More than 4,000 subscribers ultimately contributed, including a small boy who gave 12 cents (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|0.12|1846|r=0}}}} today).\n\nIn 1846, the \"school preparatory to the University\" opened in the basement of the [[First Baptist Church (Lewisburg, Pennsylvania)|First Baptist Church]] in Lewisburg. Known originally as the Lewisburg High School, it became in 1848 the Academic and Primary Department of the University at Lewisburg.<ref>[http://www.bucknell.edu/x1177.xml The Early Years] Bucknell University.</ref>\n\nIn 1850, the department moved into the first building completed on campus, now called Taylor Hall. Built for $8,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|8000|1850|r=-4}}}} today), the building housed both women's and men's studies until the opening of the Female Institute in 1852. While studying together, women were required to face east while men faced west.\n\nThe school's first commencement was held on August 20, 1851, for a graduation class of seven men. Among the board members attending was [[James Buchanan]], who would become the 15th President of the United States. Stephen Taylor officiated as his last act before assuming office as president of Madison University. One day earlier, the trustees had elected [[Howard Malcom]] as the first president of the university, a post he held for six years.\n\n===Female Institute===\n[[Image:Bucknell University, 1870s.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Bucknell University in the 1870s]]\nAlthough the Female Institute began instruction in 1852, it wasn't until 1883 that college courses were opened to [[women]]. Bucknell, though, was committed to equal educational opportunities for women.\n\nThis commitment was reflected in the words of [[David Jayne Hill]] of the Class of 1874, and president of the university from 1879 to 1888: \"We need in Pennsylvania, in the geographical centre of the state, a University, not in the German but in the American sense, where every branch of non-professional knowledge can be pursued, regardless of distinction of sex. I have no well-matured plan to announce as to the sexes; but the Principal of the Female Seminary proposes to inaugurate a course for females equal to that pursued at [[Vassar College|Vassar]]; the two sexes having equal advantages, though not reciting together.\"<ref>[http://www.bucknell.edu/x1178.xml The Female Institute] Bucknell University.</ref>\n\nWithin five years of opening, enrollment had grown so sharply that the university built a new hall\u2013Larison Hall\u2013to accommodate the Female Institute. Women could venture into town only in the company of a female teacher who had a minimum of six years' experience in handling girls.\n\n===Benefactor William Bucknell===\nIn 1881, facing dire financial circumstances, the university turned to [[William Bucknell]], a [[charter member]] of the [[board of trustees]], for help. His donation of $50,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50000|1881|r=-4}}}} today) saved the university from ruin. In 1886, in recognition of Bucknell's support of the school, the trustees voted unanimously to change the name of the University at Lewisburg to Bucknell University.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brackney|first1=William H.|title=Congregation and Campus: North American Baptists in Higher Education|date=2008|publisher=Mercer University Press|location=Macon, Georgia|isbn=978-0-88146-130-5|page=206|edition=1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wq8w4rJ4Am8C&pg=PA277&q=john%20p.%20crozer|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref> Bucknell Hall, the first of several buildings given to the university by Bucknell, was initially a [[chapel]] and for more than a half century the site of student theatrical and musical performances.

When [[the Depression]] brought a drop in enrollment in 1933, several members of the faculty were \"loaned\" to found a new institution: Bucknell Junior College in [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]]. Today, that institution is a four-year university, [[Wilkes University]], independent of Bucknell since 1947.\n\nSignificant new construction in the 1970s included the Elaine Langone Center, the Gerhard Fieldhouse, and the Computer Center. During the early 1980s, the capacity of the Bertrand Library was doubled and facilities for engineering were substantially renovated. In 1988, the Weis Center for the Performing Arts was completed.\n\nNew facilities for the sciences included the renovation of the Olin Science Building, the construction of the Rooke Chemistry Building in 1990 and the completion of a new Biology Building in 1991. The McDonnell Residence Hall and Weis Music Building were completed in 2000. In addition, the O'Leary Building for Psychology and Geology opened in the fall of 2002 and the new Kenneth Langone Recreational Athletic Center opened during the 2002\u201303 academic year. The newest engineering facility, the Breakiron Engineering Building, opened in 2004.<ref>[http://www.bucknell.edu/x1182.xml Continued Expansion] Bucknell University.</ref>\n\nAcademic West opened in fall 2013.

In 2018, Hildreth-Mirza Hall opened as the home to Bucknell's Center for the Humanities, Bucknell University Press, and the Griot Institute for the Study of Black Lives and Culture. Academic East was inaugurated in 2019. It houses the Department of Education and programs in the College of Engineering. A new building that will house the Freeman College of Management and the Department of Art and Art History is currently under construction. \n\n==Campus==\n[[File:Cherry blossoms on academic quad.jpg|thumb|left|Cherry blossoms in April on the Academic Quad with Bertrand Library in the background.]]Bucknell's {{convert|450|acre|ha|adj=on}} campus comprises more than 100 buildings that range over a gentle rise adjacent to the [[West Branch Susquehanna River]]. The campus is divided into Lower Campus and Upper Campus by [[Miller Run]] and the Grove, a stand of oak trees that ascends the slope. Lower campus consists primarily of student housing and the university's sports facilities. Upper campus consists primarily of academic buildings. It offers views northwest across the Buffalo Valley toward Nittany Mountain and southeast across the [[Susquehanna River]] toward Montour Ridge.\n\nBucknell's campus forms a cohesive architectural ensemble due to the sustained use of brick and the recurrent themes of Georgian style. The university's first building, Taylor Hall, was constructed in 1848.<ref>[http://www.bucknell.edu/info-about-attending-bucknell/visit-bucknell/the-bucknell-campus.html \"The Bucknell Campus\"] University website.

[[File:Engineering Quad Vaughn Lit, Fall.jpg|thumb|left|Fall on the Engineering Quad]]\n\nDesigned in Georgian colonial style, the non-denominational Rooke Chapel is the setting for campus worship, weddings, and celebrations. Attached to the chapel is a one-story wing, which houses the Office of Religious Life, the Chaplain's office, a meditation chapel and kitchen. The chapel was dedicated on October 25, 1964. The chapel was a gift of the late Robert L. Rooke, an alumnus of the class of 1913 and a member of the university's board of trustees. The chapel is named in memory of Mr. Rooke's parents. The main portion of the chapel includes the [[narthex]], sanctuary, chancel area, organ chamber, choir rooms, and balconies that surround the sanctuary on three sides. Approximately 850 persons can be seated in the sanctuary and balconies.<ref>[http://www.bucknell.edu/x4676.xml Charles M. and Olive S.

Originally built in 1924, the stadium was renovated and renamed in honor of Mathewson in 1989. It is home to the Bucknell University Bison football team and the Lewisburg High School Green Dragons football team. It is named for [[Christy Mathewson]], a Bucknell alumnus who went on to become a Hall of Fame pitcher for the New York Giants in the early 20th century.<ref>[http://www.historicbaseball.com/players/m/mathewson_christy.html Christy Mathewson] Historic Baseball.

There are a few loan words from these languages i.e. 'pek chek' is often taken as being annoyed or frustrated and originate [[Singaporean Hokkien|from the Hokkien dialect]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160919-the-language-the-government-tried-to-suppress|title=The language the government tried to suppress|last=Harbeck|first=James|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}</ref> It is used in casual contexts between Singaporeans, but is avoided in formal events when certain Singlish phrases may be considered unedifying.

For instance, local media have \"sports pages\" (''sport'' in British English) and \"[[soccer]] coverage\" (soccer&mdash;originally slang for ''as'''soc'''iation football''&mdash;while used in Britain, is more usually called just ''football''). Singlish also uses many words borrowed from [[Min Nan|Hokkien]], the non-Mandarin Chinese language native to more than 75% of the [[Chinese Singaporeans|Chinese in Singapore]], and from [[Malay language|Malay]]. In many cases, English words take on the meaning of their Chinese counterparts, resulting in a shift in meaning. Vocabulary is also taken from Indian words such as ''dai'' meaning 'hey', ''goondu'' meaning 'fat', etc. This is most obvious in such cases as ''borrow''/''lend'', which are functionally equivalent in Singlish and mapped to the same Mandarin word, {{Lang|zh|{{linktext|\u501f}}}} (''ji\u00e8''), which can mean to lend or to borrow. For example: \"Oi, can I borrow your calculator?\" / \"Hey, can you lend me your calculator?\"\n\n==Singlish dictionaries and word lists==\n[[File:Coxford Singlish Dictionary.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The ''Coxford Singlish Dictionary'', a light-hearted lexicon of Singlish published in 2002]]\nThere have been several efforts to compile lexicons of Singlish, some for scholarly purposes, but most for entertainment. Two early humorous works were [[Sylvia Toh Paik Choo]]'s ''Eh, Goondu!'' (1982)<ref>{{cite book \n| last = Toh\n| first = Paik Choo\n| title = Eh, Goondu!\n| publisher = Eastern Universities Press\n| year=1982\n| location = Singapore\n| isbn = 978-9971-71-168-9}}</ref> and ''Lagi Goondu!'' (1986).<ref>{{cite book \n| last = Toh\n| first = Paik Choo\n| title = Lagi Goondu!\n| publisher = Times Books International\n| year=1986\n| location = Singapore\n| isbn = 978-9971-65-224-1}}</ref> In 1997 the second edition of the ''Times-Chambers Essential English Dictionary''<ref>{{cite book \n| title = Times-Chambers Essential English Dictionary\n| edition = 2nd\n| publisher = Federal Publications\n| year=1997\n| location = Singapore\n| isbn = 978-981-01-3727-4}}</ref> was published. To date, this is the only formal dictionary containing a substantial number of Singaporean English terms. Such entries and sub-entries are arranged alphabetically amongst the standard English entries. A list of common words borrowed from local languages such as Hokkien and Malay appears in an appendix. It appears that no subsequent editions have been published.\n\n2002 saw the publication of the ''Coxford Singlish Dictionary'',<ref>{{cite book \n| title = The Coxford Singlish Dictionary\n| publisher = Angsana Books\n|year=2002\n| location = Singapore\n| isbn = 978-981-3056-50-3}}</ref> a light-hearted lexicon which was developed from material posted on the website [http://www.talkingcock.com/html/lexec.php Talkingcock.com]. In 2004 a website, [http://www.singlishdictionary.com ''A Dictionary of Singlish and Singapore English''], was launched to document the actual usage of Singlish and Singapore English in published material, in the way that the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] does for standard English. Compiled by an amateur [[lexicographer]], the ''Dictionary'' appears to be one of the more comprehensive and professionally written dictionaries dealing exclusively with Singlish and Singapore English available so far.\n\nThe [[Singapore Tourism Board]] and tourism-related businesses have also produced short lists of commonly used Singlish terms, ostensibly to allow foreigners visiting Singapore to comprehend the local language better. Such lists have been printed in brochures or booklets, and also published on websites.\n\nThe lack of an officially printed version of a Singlish dictionary is due to the fact that the Singapore government frowns upon the use of Singlish, their official stand being that the speaking of Singlish will make Singaporeans difficult to understand when communicating with foreigners who are not familiar with Singlish. Thus, the government has made an effort to quash the use of Singlish and to promote the use of standard English through the [[Speak Good English Movement]] over the past few years. Though failing to discourage the use of Singlish, it has resulted in Singlish having a bad reputation in recent years, further stalling efforts to document actual Singlish usage.\n\nLetters contributed to the forum of ''[[The Straits Times]]'', the main local newspaper, by readers have called for Singlish to be kept alive in Singapore. Community efforts to do so include the aptly named \"Speak Good Singlish Movement\". The idea of promoting Singlish was raised as part of a larger debate on creating a uniquely Singaporean identity. However, the government has yet to officially change its stand regarding Singlish.\n\nA list of Singlish terms and expressions widely used in Singapore is set out below. It is not exhaustive and is meant to provide some representative examples of Singlish usage in Singapore. The origins of the Singlish terms are indicated where possible, and literal translations are provided where necessary.\n\n== Phonological sounds used in Singlish ==\nBelow are the phonological sounds used from the International Phonetic Alphabet used in Singlish.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 10px auto;\"\n|+ Consonants Used in Singlish Vocabulary<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Leimgruber|first=Jakob R.

For instance, local media have \"sports pages\" (''sport'' in British English) and \"[[soccer]] coverage\" (soccer&mdash;originally slang for ''as'''soc'''iation football''&mdash;while used in Britain, is more usually called just ''football''). Singlish also uses many words borrowed from [[Min Nan|Hokkien]], the non-Mandarin Chinese language native to more than 75% of the [[Chinese Singaporeans|Chinese in Singapore]], and from [[Malay language|Malay]]. In many cases, English words take on the meaning of their Chinese counterparts, resulting in a shift in meaning. Vocabulary is also taken from Indian words such as ''dai'' meaning 'hey', ''goondu'' meaning 'fat', etc. This is most obvious in such cases as ''borrow''/''lend'', which are functionally equivalent in Singlish and mapped to the same Mandarin word, {{Lang|zh|{{linktext|\u501f}}}} (''ji\u00e8''), which can mean to lend or to borrow. For example: \"Oi, can I borrow your calculator?\" / \"Hey, can you lend me your calculator?\"\n\n==Singlish dictionaries and word lists==\n[[File:Coxford Singlish Dictionary.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The ''Coxford Singlish Dictionary'', a light-hearted lexicon of Singlish published in 2002]]\nThere have been several efforts to compile lexicons of Singlish, some for scholarly purposes, but most for entertainment. Two early humorous works were [[Sylvia Toh Paik Choo]]'s ''Eh, Goondu!'' (1982)<ref>{{cite book \n| last = Toh\n| first = Paik Choo\n| title = Eh, Goondu!\n| publisher = Eastern Universities Press\n| year=1982\n| location = Singapore\n| isbn = 978-9971-71-168-9}}</ref> and ''Lagi Goondu!''

To date, this is the only formal dictionary containing a substantial number of Singaporean English terms. Such entries and sub-entries are arranged alphabetically amongst the standard English entries. A list of common words borrowed from local languages such as Hokkien and Malay appears in an appendix. It appears that no subsequent editions have been published.\n\n2002 saw the publication of the ''Coxford Singlish Dictionary'',<ref>{{cite book \n| title = The Coxford Singlish Dictionary\n| publisher = Angsana Books\n|year=2002\n| location = Singapore\n| isbn = 978-981-3056-50-3}}</ref> a light-hearted lexicon which was developed from material posted on the website [http://www.talkingcock.com/html/lexec.php Talkingcock.com]. In 2004 a website, [http://www.singlishdictionary.com ''A Dictionary of Singlish and Singapore English''], was launched to document the actual usage of Singlish and Singapore English in published material, in the way that the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] does for standard English. Compiled by an amateur [[lexicographer]], the ''Dictionary'' appears to be one of the more comprehensive and professionally written dictionaries dealing exclusively with Singlish and Singapore English available so far.\n\nThe [[Singapore Tourism Board]] and tourism-related businesses have also produced short lists of commonly used Singlish terms, ostensibly to allow foreigners visiting Singapore to comprehend the local language better. Such lists have been printed in brochures or booklets, and also published on websites.\n\nThe lack of an officially printed version of a Singlish dictionary is due to the fact that the Singapore government frowns upon the use of Singlish, their official stand being that the speaking of Singlish will make Singaporeans difficult to understand when communicating with foreigners who are not familiar with Singlish. Thus, the government has made an effort to quash the use of Singlish and to promote the use of standard English through the [[Speak Good English Movement]] over the past few years. Though failing to discourage the use of Singlish, it has resulted in Singlish having a bad reputation in recent years, further stalling efforts to document actual Singlish usage.\n\nLetters contributed to the forum of ''[[The Straits Times]]'', the main local newspaper, by readers have called for Singlish to be kept alive in Singapore. Community efforts to do so include the aptly named \"Speak Good Singlish Movement\". The idea of promoting Singlish was raised as part of a larger debate on creating a uniquely Singaporean identity. However, the government has yet to officially change its stand regarding Singlish.\n\nA list of Singlish terms and expressions widely used in Singapore is set out below. It is not exhaustive and is meant to provide some representative examples of Singlish usage in Singapore. The origins of the Singlish terms are indicated where possible, and literal translations are provided where necessary.\n\n== Phonological sounds used in Singlish ==\nBelow are the phonological sounds used from the International Phonetic Alphabet used in Singlish.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 10px auto;\"\n|+ Consonants Used in Singlish Vocabulary<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Leimgruber|first=Jakob R.

In singles, she reached a career-high ranking of world No. 3 in May 2006, reached two Grand Slam semifinals at the French Open in 2003 and 2005, and reached seven additional Grand Slam quarterfinals across all four major tournaments. She won the Tier-I tournaments in Charleston and Berlin in 2006 as well as Tokyo 2012. In doubles, Petrova won the year-ending [[WTA Championships]] in 2004 with [[Meghann Shaughnessy]], and in 2012 with [[Maria Kirilenko]]. With Kirilenko, she also won the bronze medal in the doubles competition at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nPetrova was born in Moscow. Her parents were both very athletic: her father Viktor was a leading hammer thrower, while her mother [[Nadezhda Ilyina]] won a bronze medal at the [[1976 Montreal Olympics]] in the 400 meter relay. Her father is still an athletics coach, and her mother was an athletics coach until her death in 2013. As a child, Nadia did a lot of travelling around the world with her parents. She eventually settled in [[Egypt]], where she trained with Mohammed Saif and her parents.\n\n===Playing style===\nPetrova is an all-court aggressive player who is capable of hitting winners off both wings, but particularly off her back-hand and which she hits flat and with slice. Petrova's serve is considered her biggest asset and one of the best serves in the women's game. In 2010, she hit the most aces on the tour with 306. She had an impressive 70% of first serve points won and also won over 74% of her service games. As an accomplished doubles player, Petrova's volleying skills are considered exceptional and she is not afraid to come into the net to finish off points. Petrova's main weakness is her movement around the court as she is often slow to retrieve balls and can sometimes struggle to defend well during rallies. Also, her forehand is sometimes erratic and can produce many unforced errors. Petrova states [[hard courts]] as her preferred surface, however, she has been most successful on [[clay courts]] where she can dictate play easier because it gives her more time on the ball. She is known for her unpredictability and inconsistency.\n\n==Career==\n===Early years===\nAs a junior, Petrova won the [[1998 French Open]], beating [[Jelena Doki\u0107]] in the final.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gimelstob-V. Williams halfway to grand slam|last=Smith|first=Doug|date=8 June 1998|work=USA Today |page=11C|location=McLean, Virginia}}</ref> The same year, she finished runner-up at the [[Dunlop Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] to [[Elena Dementieva]] and she also finished runner-up at the junior [[1999 US Open (tennis)|1999 US Open]] to [[Lina Krasnoroutskaya]]. In May 1998, she played her first WTA tournament at the [[J&S Cup]] as a wild-card entrant. She also received a wild card for her home event in Moscow, the [[Kremlin Cup]], where she picked up her first top-twenty win over [[Iva Majoli]]. By the end of 1999, Petrova had reached the top 100.\n\nIn 2000, she reached the third round of the [[2000 Australian Open|Australian Open]] and the quarterfinals of the [[Ericsson Open]], beating [[Julie Halard-Decugis]] for her first top ten win before losing to [[Lindsay Davenport]]. She finished the season at No. 50. She reached the fourth round of both [[2001 French Open|French Open]] and the [[2001 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] in 2001 and her ranking hit a high of No. 38 during the season. However, her 2002 season was marred by injuries causing her ranking to drop out of the top 100.\n\n===2003\u20132004: First Grand Slam semifinal and top 10 ranking===\nAt the [[2003 Australian Open]], Petrova defeated [[Gr\u00e9ta Arn]] 6\u20132, 6\u20131 and then defeated 21st seed [[Ai Sugiyama]] 6\u20134, 6\u20134 in the second round. Petrova then lost to world No. 15 [[Patty Schnyder]] 2\u20136, 6\u20134, 3\u20136 in the third round.\n\nPetrova was ranked world No. 76 going into the [[2003 French Open|French Open]]. In the first round she beat the three-time champion and world No. 12 [[Monica Seles]] 6\u20134, 6\u20130, on what was to be Seles' last professional match. She then defeated [[Silvija Talaja]] 6\u20131, 6\u20131 and [[Marissa Irvin]] 6\u20131, 6\u20131 to reach the fourth round. Here, Petrova stunned seventh seed [[Jennifer Capriati]] 6\u20133, 4\u20136, 6\u20133. In the quarterfinals, Petrova won again in three sets over 21st seed [[Vera Zvonareva]] 6\u20131, 4\u20136, 6\u20133 to reach her first ever Grand Slam semifinal. Petrova faced world No. 2, [[Kim Clijsters]], and despite having a set point in the first set, Petrova was beaton in straight sets 7\u20135, 6\u20131.

However, she fell to Ai Sugiyama 5\u20137, 4\u20136.\nPetrova ended 2003 ranked world No. 12 with a 45\u201323 singles record.\n\nPetrova reached her second WTA final at [[Mondial Australian Women's Hardcourts|Gold Coast]], losing once again to Ai Sugiyama 6\u20131, 1\u20136, 4\u20136. She was upset in the first round of the [[2004 Australian Open]] to [[Anik\u00f3 Kapros]], losing 3\u20136, 3\u20136.\n\nIn March 2004, she hit the top ten at No. 9 after reaching the semifinals of the Tier 1 [[NASDAQ-100 Open]] in Miami. She reached the semifinals at the [[Bausch & Lomb Championships]], beating second-seeded Serena Williams before losing to Lindsay Davenport. After this, her ranking elevated to a career high of No. 7. However, she failed to defend her semifinal points from the 2003 French Open, losing to [[Marlene Weing\u00e4rtner]] in the third round 3\u20136, 2\u20136.\n\nAt the [[2004 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], she pulled off the biggest win of her career by defeating world No. 1 and defending champion Justine Henin 6\u20133, 6\u20132 in the fourth round. It was Petrova's first victory over a world No. 1. She lost in the quarterfinals to eventual champion [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]] 6\u20137, 3\u20136.\n\nPetrova reached the semifinals of Linz, losing to [[Elena Bovina]] in three sets. She also reached the semifinals of Philadelphia, losing to Vera Zvonareva. She finished the year ranked world No. 12 with a 40\u201325 singles record.\n\n===2005: First career title and top-10 finish===\nPetrova reached the fourth round of the [[2005 Australian Open|Australian Open]], losing to the eventual champion [[Serena Williams]], in three sets. She reached her third career final at the [[Qatar Total German Open]] in May, beating [[Mary Pierce]], [[Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo]] and [[Jelena Jankovi\u0107]], before losing to Justine Henin. Her ranking rose to No. 9, where she stayed for the next two years before dropping out in May 2007.\n\nAt the [[2005 French Open|French Open]], Petrova defeated 17-year-old [[Ana Ivanovic]] in the quarterfinals before losing to Henin-Hardenne 6\u20132, 6\u20133 in the semifinals; her performance at the tournament saw her ranking rise to world No. 8. A few weeks later at [[2005 Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], she reached the quarterfinals before losing to defending champion [[Maria Sharapova]] 6\u20137, 3\u20136. After Wimbledon, she reached five straight quarterfinals at [[JPMorgan Chase Open|Los Angeles]], [[Canada Masters|Toronto]], the [[2005 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], [[Fortis Championships Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], and [[Porsche Tennis Grand Prix|Filderstadt]].\n\nPetrova finally won her first title at the [[Generali Ladies Linz]] held in [[Linz]], Austria. She beat Patty Schnyder in the final.\nHer successful season meant she qualified for the [[2005 WTA Tour Championships|Sony Ericsson Championships]] in Los Angeles. She ended 2005 ranked world No. 9, her first top ten finish.\n\n===2006: Top-3 ranking===\nAt the [[2006 Australian Open|Australian Open]], Petrova was seeded sixth and defeated [[Sophie Ferguson]], [[Martina M\u00fcller (tennis)|Martina M\u00fcller]], [[Maria Elena Camerin]], and [[Elena Vesnina]] on her way to her first quarterfinal at the Australian Open. She lost to fourth-seeded Maria Sharapova, 6\u20137, 4\u20136 in the quarterfinals.\n\nAt the [[Qatar Total Open]], Petrova picked up her first title of the year and second overall by beating second-ranked and top-seeded Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo, 6\u20133, 7\u20135, in the final. The victory took her ranking to No. 7. She followed it with a quarterfinal showing at the NASDAQ-100 Open, losing to Mauresmo, 3\u20136, 1\u20136.\n\nPetrova then began a run that would take her to three titles, winning fifteen straight matches. At the [[Bausch & Lomb Championships]], she defeated [[Francesca Schiavone]] in the final to pick up her third title in the past six months. One week later, she won her second straight title and fourth overall at the [[Family Circle Cup]] with a victory over Patty Schnyder.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/sport/content/200604/s1617190.htm Petrova captures Charleston title]</ref>\n\nShe next entered the [[Qatar Telecom German Open]] in Berlin, defeating Justine Henin.<ref>[https://sports.yahoo.com/ten/news?slug=berlintennis&prov=st&type=lgns Petrova beats Henin-Hardenne to win German Open]</ref> With this win, she ascended to her career-high ranking of No. 3.\n\nHowever, Petrova was defeated in the first round of the [[2006 French Open|French Open]] by [[Akiko Morigami]], 2\u20136, 2\u20136. This may have been caused by an ankle injury Petrova suffered during training for the tournament. She then withdrew from Wimbledon and did not win a match in the [[US Open Series]], going 0\u20133. At the [[2006 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Petrova was upset in the third round by [[Tatiana Golovin]].\n\nAt the [[Porsche Tennis Grand Prix|Stuttgart]], Petrova won her first tournament title since the Qatar Telecom German Open in May 2006.

The loss meant that she had not gone past the fourth round of any Grand Slam tournament all year, the first time since 2002.\n\nShe finished 2007 ranked No. 14, her lowest year-end ranking in five years.\n\n===2008===\nPetrova started her 2008 season on a two-match losing streak going into the [[2008 Australian Open|Australian Open]], losing in the first round in Gold Coast as the second seed to [[Tathiana Garbin]], 7\u20135, 5\u20137, 3\u20136, and in Sydney 5\u20137, 3\u20136 to [[Sybille Bammer]]. She still managed to reach the fourth round of the Australian Open though as the 14th seed with wins over [[Nicole Pratt]], [[Anne Kremer]], and [[Ekaterina Makarova]], all in straight sets. There she played [[Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska]] of Poland, who beat her 6\u20131, 5\u20137, 0\u20136. Petrova held a 6\u20131, 3\u20130 lead and looked to be on her way to an easy victory. In the third set, she won just four points.\n\nAt the [[Open Gaz de France]] in Paris, Petrova was the defending champion and seeded fifth, but lost in the first round to [[Kateryna Bondarenko]], 6\u20137, 6\u20133, 4\u20136. Petrova retired in her first\u2013round match at the [[2008 Qatar Total Open]] against [[Anabel Medina Garrigues]] due to an upset stomach while trailing 2\u20136, 2\u20131. At [[2008 Dubai Tennis Championships|Dubai]], she lost 4\u20136, 4\u20136 to [[Katarina Srebotnik]].\n\nPetrova's injuries continued to strike -when she was forced to retire in the second round of Miami with a right quad strain while trailing 1\u20132 in the first set against [[Zheng Jie]].\n\nAt the [[2008 German Open|German Open]] in Berlin, Petrova returned to action as the 16th seed and defeated Katarina Srebotnik, 7\u20136, 3\u20136, 7\u20136, in the first round, before losing in the second round to Maria Kirilenko, 3\u20136, 3\u20136. Petrova was once again defeated by Kirilenko in the first round of Rome, but this time in three sets, 6\u20133, 5\u20137, 4\u20136. At her final warm-up tournament in Istanbul, Nadia was seeded third and got past [[Lilia Osterloh]] in the first and [[Marta Domachowska]] in the second round. She lost to [[Akgul Amanmuradova]], 6\u20137, 6\u20131, 4\u20136, in the quarterfinals.\n\n[[File:Petrova cincy 2008.JPG|upright|thumb|left|Petrova won the 2008 Western & Southern Financial Group Women's Open beating Nathalie Dechy in the final]]\nThese losses put Petrova in poor stead going into the [[2008 French Open|French Open]]. As the 25th seed, she beat [[Aravane Reza\u00ef]] and [[Alisa Kleybanova]] in straight sets, before being thrashed by Svetlana Kuznetsova, 2\u20136, 1\u20136.\n\nPetrova's grass-court season began at [[Aegon International|Eastbourne]], where she reached her first final of the year showing good form. She was beaten in a close match by Pole Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska, 4\u20136, 7\u20136, 4\u20136.\n\nAt Wimbledon, Petrova was 21st seed and was on track after wins over [[Olga Govortsova]] and [[Mara Santangelo]]. Petrova then pulled off an excellent win over the in-form teenager and 16th seed [[Victoria Azarenka]] in the third round. In the fourth round, she faced unseeded [[Alla Kudryavtseva]] who just came off a win over third seed Maria Sharapova; Petrova won to reach her second quarterfinal at Wimbledon. This was also the first time that Petrova had reached a Grand Slam quarterfinal since the 2006 Australian Open. She lost a cracker two and a half hour marathon match against the fifth seed Elena Dementieva, 1\u20136, 7\u20136, 3\u20136.

\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430}}; born 8 June 1982) is a retired [[Russians|Russian]] tennis player.\n\nIn her career, she won 37 titles on the [[WTA Tour]], 13 in singles and 24 in doubles. In singles, she reached a career-high ranking of world No. 3 in May 2006, reached two Grand Slam semifinals at the French Open in 2003 and 2005, and reached seven additional Grand Slam quarterfinals across all four major tournaments. She won the Tier-I tournaments in Charleston and Berlin in 2006 as well as Tokyo 2012. In doubles, Petrova won the year-ending [[WTA Championships]] in 2004 with [[Meghann Shaughnessy]], and in 2012 with [[Maria Kirilenko]]. With Kirilenko, she also won the bronze medal in the doubles competition at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nPetrova was born in Moscow. Her parents were both very athletic: her father Viktor was a leading hammer thrower, while her mother [[Nadezhda Ilyina]] won a bronze medal at the [[1976 Montreal Olympics]] in the 400 meter relay. Her father is still an athletics coach, and her mother was an athletics coach until her death in 2013. As a child, Nadia did a lot of travelling around the world with her parents. She eventually settled in [[Egypt]], where she trained with Mohammed Saif and her parents.\n\n===Playing style===\nPetrova is an all-court aggressive player who is capable of hitting winners off both wings, but particularly off her back-hand and which she hits flat and with slice. Petrova's serve is considered her biggest asset and one of the best serves in the women's game. In 2010, she hit the most aces on the tour with 306. She had an impressive 70% of first serve points won and also won over 74% of her service games. As an accomplished doubles player, Petrova's volleying skills are considered exceptional and she is not afraid to come into the net to finish off points. Petrova's main weakness is her movement around the court as she is often slow to retrieve balls and can sometimes struggle to defend well during rallies. Also, her forehand is sometimes erratic and can produce many unforced errors. Petrova states [[hard courts]] as her preferred surface, however, she has been most successful on [[clay courts]] where she can dictate play easier because it gives her more time on the ball. She is known for her unpredictability and inconsistency.\n\n==Career==\n===Early years===\nAs a junior, Petrova won the [[1998 French Open]], beating [[Jelena Doki\u0107]] in the final.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gimelstob-V. Williams halfway to grand slam|last=Smith|first=Doug|date=8 June 1998|work=USA Today |page=11C|location=McLean, Virginia}}</ref> The same year, she finished runner-up at the [[Dunlop Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] to [[Elena Dementieva]] and she also finished runner-up at the junior [[1999 US Open (tennis)|1999 US Open]] to [[Lina Krasnoroutskaya]]. In May 1998, she played her first WTA tournament at the [[J&S Cup]] as a wild-card entrant. She also received a wild card for her home event in Moscow, the [[Kremlin Cup]], where she picked up her first top-twenty win over [[Iva Majoli]]. By the end of 1999, Petrova had reached the top 100.\n\nIn 2000, she reached the third round of the [[2000 Australian Open|Australian Open]] and the quarterfinals of the [[Ericsson Open]], beating [[Julie Halard-Decugis]] for her first top ten win before losing to [[Lindsay Davenport]]. She finished the season at No. 50. She reached the fourth round of both [[2001 French Open|French Open]] and the [[2001 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] in 2001 and her ranking hit a high of No. 38 during the season. However, her 2002 season was marred by injuries causing her ranking to drop out of the top 100.\n\n===2003\u20132004: First Grand Slam semifinal and top 10 ranking===\nAt the [[2003 Australian Open]], Petrova defeated [[Gr\u00e9ta Arn]] 6\u20132, 6\u20131 and then defeated 21st seed [[Ai Sugiyama]] 6\u20134, 6\u20134 in the second round. Petrova then lost to world No. 15 [[Patty Schnyder]] 2\u20136, 6\u20134, 3\u20136 in the third round.\n\nPetrova was ranked world No. 76 going into the [[2003 French Open|French Open]]. In the first round she beat the three-time champion and world No. 12 [[Monica Seles]] 6\u20134, 6\u20130, on what was to be Seles' last professional match. She then defeated [[Silvija Talaja]] 6\u20131, 6\u20131 and [[Marissa Irvin]] 6\u20131, 6\u20131 to reach the fourth round. Here, Petrova stunned seventh seed [[Jennifer Capriati]] 6\u20133, 4\u20136, 6\u20133. In the quarterfinals, Petrova won again in three sets over 21st seed [[Vera Zvonareva]] 6\u20131, 4\u20136, 6\u20133 to reach her first ever Grand Slam semifinal. Petrova faced world No. 2, [[Kim Clijsters]], and despite having a set point in the first set, Petrova was beaton in straight sets 7\u20135, 6\u20131. However, her ranking increased to world No. 30.\n\nPetrova reached the semifinals of 's Hertogenbosch, defeating [[Elena Dementieva]] en route but lost to world No. 3 [[Justine Henin]] in three sets.

Petrova continued her success by reaching the semifinals of Zurich, beating world No. 8 and US Open finalist before losing to Henin 4\u20136, 4\u20136.\n\nThe following week in Linz, Petrova beat [[Paola Su\u00e1rez]] and Patty Schnyder to reach her first Sony Ericsson WTA Tour final. However, she fell to Ai Sugiyama 5\u20137, 4\u20136.\nPetrova ended 2003 ranked world No. 12 with a 45\u201323 singles record.\n\nPetrova reached her second WTA final at [[Mondial Australian Women's Hardcourts|Gold Coast]], losing once again to Ai Sugiyama 6\u20131, 1\u20136, 4\u20136. She was upset in the first round of the [[2004 Australian Open]] to [[Anik\u00f3 Kapros]], losing 3\u20136, 3\u20136.\n\nIn March 2004, she hit the top ten at No. 9 after reaching the semifinals of the Tier 1 [[NASDAQ-100 Open]] in Miami. She reached the semifinals at the [[Bausch & Lomb Championships]], beating second-seeded Serena Williams before losing to Lindsay Davenport. After this, her ranking elevated to a career high of No. 7. However, she failed to defend her semifinal points from the 2003 French Open, losing to [[Marlene Weing\u00e4rtner]] in the third round 3\u20136, 2\u20136.\n\nAt the [[2004 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], she pulled off the biggest win of her career by defeating world No. 1 and defending champion Justine Henin 6\u20133, 6\u20132 in the fourth round. It was Petrova's first victory over a world No. 1. She lost in the quarterfinals to eventual champion [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]] 6\u20137, 3\u20136.\n\nPetrova reached the semifinals of Linz, losing to [[Elena Bovina]] in three sets. She also reached the semifinals of Philadelphia, losing to Vera Zvonareva. She finished the year ranked world No. 12 with a 40\u201325 singles record.\n\n===2005: First career title and top-10 finish===\nPetrova reached the fourth round of the [[2005 Australian Open|Australian Open]], losing to the eventual champion [[Serena Williams]], in three sets. She reached her third career final at the [[Qatar Total German Open]] in May, beating [[Mary Pierce]], [[Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo]] and [[Jelena Jankovi\u0107]], before losing to Justine Henin. Her ranking rose to No. 9, where she stayed for the next two years before dropping out in May 2007.\n\nAt the [[2005 French Open|French Open]], Petrova defeated 17-year-old [[Ana Ivanovic]] in the quarterfinals before losing to Henin-Hardenne 6\u20132, 6\u20133 in the semifinals; her performance at the tournament saw her ranking rise to world No. 8. A few weeks later at [[2005 Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], she reached the quarterfinals before losing to defending champion [[Maria Sharapova]] 6\u20137, 3\u20136. After Wimbledon, she reached five straight quarterfinals at [[JPMorgan Chase Open|Los Angeles]], [[Canada Masters|Toronto]], the [[2005 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], [[Fortis Championships Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], and [[Porsche Tennis Grand Prix|Filderstadt]].\n\nPetrova finally won her first title at the [[Generali Ladies Linz]] held in [[Linz]], Austria. She beat Patty Schnyder in the final.\nHer successful season meant she qualified for the [[2005 WTA Tour Championships|Sony Ericsson Championships]] in Los Angeles. She ended 2005 ranked world No. 9, her first top ten finish.\n\n===2006: Top-3 ranking===\nAt the [[2006 Australian Open|Australian Open]], Petrova was seeded sixth and defeated [[Sophie Ferguson]], [[Martina M\u00fcller (tennis)|Martina M\u00fcller]], [[Maria Elena Camerin]], and [[Elena Vesnina]] on her way to her first quarterfinal at the Australian Open. She lost to fourth-seeded Maria Sharapova, 6\u20137, 4\u20136 in the quarterfinals.\n\nAt the [[Qatar Total Open]], Petrova picked up her first title of the year and second overall by beating second-ranked and top-seeded Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo, 6\u20133, 7\u20135, in the final. The victory took her ranking to No. 7. She followed it with a quarterfinal showing at the NASDAQ-100 Open, losing to Mauresmo, 3\u20136, 1\u20136.\n\nPetrova then began a run that would take her to three titles, winning fifteen straight matches. At the [[Bausch & Lomb Championships]], she defeated [[Francesca Schiavone]] in the final to pick up her third title in the past six months. One week later, she won her second straight title and fourth overall at the [[Family Circle Cup]] with a victory over Patty Schnyder.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/sport/content/200604/s1617190.htm Petrova captures Charleston title]</ref>\n\nShe next entered the [[Qatar Telecom German Open]] in Berlin, defeating Justine Henin.<ref>[https://sports.yahoo.com/ten/news?slug=berlintennis&prov=st&type=lgns Petrova beats Henin-Hardenne to win German Open]</ref> With this win, she ascended to her career-high ranking of No. 3.\n\nHowever, Petrova was defeated in the first round of the [[2006 French Open|French Open]] by [[Akiko Morigami]], 2\u20136, 2\u20136. This may have been caused by an ankle injury Petrova suffered during training for the tournament. She then withdrew from Wimbledon and did not win a match in the [[US Open Series]], going 0\u20133. At the [[2006 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Petrova was upset in the third round by [[Tatiana Golovin]].\n\nAt the [[Porsche Tennis Grand Prix|Stuttgart]], Petrova won her first tournament title since the Qatar Telecom German Open in May 2006. She then continued her return to form by reaching the final of the [[Kremlin Cup]] in Moscow, losing to Russian [[Anna Chakvetadze]].\n\nAt the [[2006 WTA Tour Championships|Sony Ericsson Championships]] in Madrid in November 2006, her lone victory was over top-ranked Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo, 6\u20132, 6\u20132. She finished the year at No. 6.\n\n===2007===\nAt the [[2007 Australian Open|Australian Open]], she reached the third round, before falling to Serena Williams, the eventual champion, after holding a 5\u20133 lead in the second set.\n\n[[File:Nadia Petrova 2007 Australian Open R1.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Nadia Petrova at the 2007 Australian Open]]\nAt the [[Open Gaz de France]] in Paris, Petrova picked up her seventh tour title and first of the season by beating [[Lucie \u0160af\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1]].

While the effect of rising [[Effects of global warming on oceans|ocean temperatures]] is still being studied, an infectious outbreak in the mid 2000s played a large role in the drop.

Most Antarctic penguin species nest in large high density aggregations of birds. For an example see the photo of nesting [[emperor penguin]]. In contrast yellow-eyed penguins do not nest within visual sight of each other. While they can be seen coming ashore in groups of four to six or more individuals then disperse along track to individual nests sites out of sight of each other.  The consensus view of New Zealand penguin workers is that it is preferable to use habitat rather than colony to refer to areas where yellow-eyed penguins nest. Nest sites are selected in August and normally two eggs are laid in September. The incubation duties (lasting 39\u201351 days) are shared by both parents who may spend several days on the nest at a time. For the first six weeks after hatching, the chicks are guarded during the day by one parent while the other is at sea feeding. The foraging adult returns at least daily to feed the chicks and relieve the partner.\n\nAfter the chicks are six weeks of age, both parents go to sea to supply food to their rapidly growing offspring. Chicks usually fledge in mid-February and are totally independent from then on. Chick fledge weights are generally between 5 and 6&nbsp;kg.\n\nFirst breeding occurs at three to four years of age and long-term partnerships are formed.\n\n==Conservation==\nThe yellow-eyed penguin is considered one of the rarest penguin species in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yellow-eyedpenguin.org.nz/penguins/population-recent-trends/|title=Population and recent trends|website=Yellow-eyed Penguin Trust|access-date=2019-09-29}}</ref> It is listed on the [[IUCN Red List]] as being endangered.

Most Antarctic penguin species nest in large high density aggregations of birds. For an example see the photo of nesting [[emperor penguin]]. In contrast yellow-eyed penguins do not nest within visual sight of each other. While they can be seen coming ashore in groups of four to six or more individuals then disperse along track to individual nests sites out of sight of each other.  The consensus view of New Zealand penguin workers is that it is preferable to use habitat rather than colony to refer to areas where yellow-eyed penguins nest. Nest sites are selected in August and normally two eggs are laid in September. The incubation duties (lasting 39\u201351 days) are shared by both parents who may spend several days on the nest at a time. For the first six weeks after hatching, the chicks are guarded during the day by one parent while the other is at sea feeding. The foraging adult returns at least daily to feed the chicks and relieve the partner.\n\nAfter the chicks are six weeks of age, both parents go to sea to supply food to their rapidly growing offspring. Chicks usually fledge in mid-February and are totally independent from then on. Chick fledge weights are generally between 5 and 6&nbsp;kg.\n\nFirst breeding occurs at three to four years of age and long-term partnerships are formed.\n\n==Conservation==\nThe yellow-eyed penguin is considered one of the rarest penguin species in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yellow-eyedpenguin.org.nz/penguins/population-recent-trends/|title=Population and recent trends|website=Yellow-eyed Penguin Trust|access-date=2019-09-29}}</ref> It is listed on the [[IUCN Red List]] as being endangered.

The disease has been linked to an [[infection]] of ''[[Corynebacterium]]'', a genus of bacteria that also causes [[diphtheria]] in humans. It has recently been described as [[diphtheritic stomatitis]]. However, it seems as if this is just a secondary infection. The primary [[pathogen]] remains unknown.

In addition, commercial tourist operations on [[Otago Peninsula]] also provide hides to view yellow-eyed penguins.

It was intended to be set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) and acknowledge the continuity of [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the franchise's films]] and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|other television series]]. The episode was produced by [[ABC Studios#ABC Signature|ABC Signature Studios]] and [[Marvel Television]], and written by [[Kevin Biegel]].\n\nThe pilot stars [[Milana Vayntrub]] as [[Squirrel Girl|Doreen Green / Squirrel Girl]] and [[Derek Theler]] as [[Mister Immortal|Craig Hollis / Mister Immortal]], who make up the New Warriors with [[Jeremy Tardy]], [[Calum Worthy]], [[Matthew Moy]], and [[Kate Comer]]. The young group learn to cope with their new abilities in a terrifying world. By August 2016, Marvel Television had developed a series centered on the New Warriors and began offering it to cable networks and streaming outlets. In April 2017, ''New Warriors'' received a series order of 10 episodes from [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]], with Biegel joining as showrunner and writing the first script. The pilot had been produced by November 2017.\n\n''New Warriors'' was planned to premiere in 2018 on Freeform, and had the potential to launch multiple spinoff series based on each of the New Warriors characters. However, by November 2018 the network no longer had room in its schedule to begin airing the series that year, and returned it to Marvel Television so the studio could shop the series to other Disney-owned networks. These efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, and the series was officially considered dead by the end of September 2019.\n\n==Premise==\nSix superpowered young people with abilities very different from the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] want to make a positive impact in the world, even if they are not quite ready to be heroes.<ref name=\"MarvelPressRelease\" />\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Milana Vayntrub]] as [[Squirrel Girl|Doreen Green / Squirrel Girl]]:<br />A tough, optimistic [[Fan (person)|fangirl]], who is also a natural leader with acrobat skills and superhuman strength, and can move and fight like a squirrel.

[[Kevin Biegel]] was nearing a deal to write a script and serve as [[showrunner]] for the series, after Marvel had attached him to the project before Freeform's involvement.<ref name=\"THRApril2017\" /> [[Jeph Loeb]], the head of Marvel Television, and Jim Chory were set to executive produce the series alongside Biegel.<ref name=\"THRApril2017\" /><ref name=\"USATodayApr2017\" />\n\nKarey Burke, Executive Vice President of Programming and Development at Freeform, said the network had interest in a Squirrel Girl series before Marvel was moving forward with the project, and before Freeform ordered their other Marvel series, ''[[Cloak & Dagger (TV series)|Marvel's Cloak & Dagger]]''. Burke also felt Freeform was the best network for ''New Warriors'', believing that Marvel had \"started to see our strength with young adults\" following the success of ''Cloak & Dagger'', and both companies wanted to \"find the right characters that felt like they would speak directly to Freeform's audience. [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]] wouldn't work here but the about-to-be-Avengers works here.\"<ref name=\"THRApril2017\" /> On whether the network would consider spinoff series for each of the characters on the New Warriors team, in a similar fashion to [[Marvel's Netflix television series]], Burke felt they \"absolutely\" could given the characters Marvel chose \"are all really singular and could each carry the show that they're on. They're bound together ... for as long as we choose with this show but it's conceptually tailor-made for spinoffs.\"<ref name=\"THRApril2017\" /> Biegel was confirmed as showrunner in July 2017,<ref name=\"THRJuly2017\" /> and production on the pilot episode had taken place by that November.<ref name=\"NoFreeform\" />\n\n===Casting===\nCasting was expected to begin \"shortly\" after the series was announced in April 2017. Burke noted that actresses [[Anna Kendrick]] and [[Shannon Purser]], who had both publicly expressed interest in portraying Squirrel Girl, had been discussed for that role. She added that the network had historically \"made a lot of stars\", but noted that the character put them in a unique position, saying \"The character is such a calling card. I'm interested to see if name actresses feel right for it.\"<ref name=\"THRApril2017\" /> Kendrick later admitted that she thought she had given \"one of those answers that just goes away\" and had no real interest in the role.<ref name=\"Kendrick\" /> By July 2017, Purser and [[Mae Whitman]], who had also publicly expressed interest in the role, were among those that had been seriously considered for the part, with the character having been written with Whitman in mind. Discussions of Whitman were cut short due to her commitments to the series ''[[Good Girls (TV series)|Good Girls]]''. In early July, the series cast was announced, with [[Milana Vayntrub]] as Doreen Green / Squirrel Girl, and [[Derek Theler]] as the series' co-lead [[Mister Immortal|Craig Hollis / Mister Immortal]]. Also announced were [[Jeremy Tardy]] as [[Night Thrasher (Dwayne Taylor)|Dwayne Taylor / Night Thrasher]], [[Calum Worthy]] as [[Robbie Baldwin|Robbie Baldwin / Speedball]], [[Matthew Moy]] as [[Microbe (comics)|Zach Smith / Microbe]], and [[Kate Comer]] as [[Debrii|Deborah Fields / Debrii]].<ref name=\"THRJuly2017\" /> In late July 2017, [[Keith David]] was cast in the recurring role of Ernest Vigman for the series.<ref name=\"KeithDavid\" />\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\nDiscussing the potential for ''New Warriors'' to connect to ''Cloak & Dagger'' in April 2017, Burke said that the two properties were \"not particularly connected\" given \"their tones are so wildly different\", adding, \"There are many degrees of separation with where they fall in the Marvel universe. But anything is possible with Marvel.\"<ref name=\"THRApril2017\" /> That July, Loeb said there were no plans to crossover the two series, nor to crossover them across networks with the similarly youth-oriented ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Marvel's Runaways]]'' on [[Hulu]]. He added that Marvel wanted ''New Warriors'' to find its footing before further connecting with other elements of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], saying \"You'll see things that comment on each other; we try to touch base wherever we can... It's being aware of it and trying to find a way for it to be able to discuss in a way that makes sense.\"<ref name=\"TCAJul2017THR\" />\n\n==Cancellation==\nIn November 2017, ''New Warriors'' was no longer set to air on Freeform. The completed pilot was said to have \"tested through the roof\", with high-level executives at [[Disney]] taking interest in the project. Marvel wanted the series to air in 2018, but Freeform found that it did not have room in its schedule for the series, and agreed to give the project back to Marvel; the studio would shop the series to new partners who could release the series in 2018, potentially only looking at companies that are Disney-owned, and hoping to secure a two-season pick-up from the new network. The series was still considered to be likely to produce multiple spinoffs in a similar model to Marvel's Netflix shows. Production on the remainder of ''New Warriors'' was scheduled to resume in January 2018, pending the series being picked-up by a new network.<ref name=\"NoFreeform\" />\n\nLoeb stated in June 2018 that Marvel Television was still looking for a network to air the series.<ref name=\"LoebAMAJun2018\" /> The studio discussed moving the series to Disney's streaming services [[Disney+]] and Hulu, but neither broadcaster was interested in picking-up the series.<ref name=\"NWCanceled\" /> By the end of September 2019, ''New Warriors'' was officially considered to be dead.<ref name=\"NWCanceled2\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of unproduced television projects based on Marvel Comics]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"MarvelPressRelease\">{{Cite web |url=https://news.marvel.com/tv/62577/marvels-new-warriors-headed-freeform-straight-series-order/ |title='Marvel's New Warriors' Headed to Freeform With Straight to Series Order |last=Storm |first=Marc |date=April 5, 2017 |website=[[Marvel Comics|Marvel.com]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6pVBsHJXC?url=https://news.marvel.com/tv/62577/marvels-new-warriors-headed-freeform-straight-series-order/ |archive-date=April 5, 2017 |access-date=April 5, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"THRApril2017\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/squirrel-girl-tv-series-freeform-orders-marvels-new-warriors-991277 |title=Marvel's 'New Warriors,' With Squirrel Girl, Ordered Straight-to-Series at Freeform (Exclusive) |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |date=April 5, 2017 |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6pVBsNbPa?url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/squirrel-girl-tv-series-freeform-orders-marvels-new-warriors-991277 |archive-date=April 5, 2017 |access-date=April 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"TVLineAug2016\">{{Cite web |url=http://tvline.com/2016/08/30/squirrel-girl-tv-series-comedy-new-warriors-marvel/ |title=Squirrel Girl on TV?

Comics]] superhero team [[New Warriors|of the same name]]. It was intended to be set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) and acknowledge the continuity of [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the franchise's films]] and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|other television series]]. The episode was produced by [[ABC Studios#ABC Signature|ABC Signature Studios]] and [[Marvel Television]], and written by [[Kevin Biegel]].\n\nThe pilot stars [[Milana Vayntrub]] as [[Squirrel Girl|Doreen Green / Squirrel Girl]] and [[Derek Theler]] as [[Mister Immortal|Craig Hollis / Mister Immortal]], who make up the New Warriors with [[Jeremy Tardy]], [[Calum Worthy]], [[Matthew Moy]], and [[Kate Comer]]. The young group learn to cope with their new abilities in a terrifying world. By August 2016, Marvel Television had developed a series centered on the New Warriors and began offering it to cable networks and streaming outlets. In April 2017, ''New Warriors'' received a series order of 10 episodes from [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]], with Biegel joining as showrunner and writing the first script. The pilot had been produced by November 2017.\n\n''New Warriors'' was planned to premiere in 2018 on Freeform, and had the potential to launch multiple spinoff series based on each of the New Warriors characters. However, by November 2018 the network no longer had room in its schedule to begin airing the series that year, and returned it to Marvel Television so the studio could shop the series to other Disney-owned networks. These efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, and the series was officially considered dead by the end of September 2019.\n\n==Premise==\nSix superpowered young people with abilities very different from the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] want to make a positive impact in the world, even if they are not quite ready to be heroes.<ref name=\"MarvelPressRelease\" />\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Milana Vayntrub]] as [[Squirrel Girl|Doreen Green / Squirrel Girl]]:<br />A tough, optimistic [[Fan (person)|fangirl]], who is also a natural leader with acrobat skills and superhuman strength, and can move and fight like a squirrel.

[[Kevin Biegel]] was nearing a deal to write a script and serve as [[showrunner]] for the series, after Marvel had attached him to the project before Freeform's involvement.<ref name=\"THRApril2017\" /> [[Jeph Loeb]], the head of Marvel Television, and Jim Chory were set to executive produce the series alongside Biegel.<ref name=\"THRApril2017\" /><ref name=\"USATodayApr2017\" />\n\nKarey Burke, Executive Vice President of Programming and Development at Freeform, said the network had interest in a Squirrel Girl series before Marvel was moving forward with the project, and before Freeform ordered their other Marvel series, ''[[Cloak & Dagger (TV series)|Marvel's Cloak & Dagger]]''. Burke also felt Freeform was the best network for ''New Warriors'', believing that Marvel had \"started to see our strength with young adults\" following the success of ''Cloak & Dagger'', and both companies wanted to \"find the right characters that felt like they would speak directly to Freeform's audience. [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]] wouldn't work here but the about-to-be-Avengers works here.\"<ref name=\"THRApril2017\" /> On whether the network would consider spinoff series for each of the characters on the New Warriors team, in a similar fashion to [[Marvel's Netflix television series]], Burke felt they \"absolutely\" could given the characters Marvel chose \"are all really singular and could each carry the show that they're on. They're bound together ... for as long as we choose with this show but it's conceptually tailor-made for spinoffs.\"<ref name=\"THRApril2017\" /> Biegel was confirmed as showrunner in July 2017,<ref name=\"THRJuly2017\" /> and production on the pilot episode had taken place by that November.<ref name=\"NoFreeform\" />\n\n===Casting===\nCasting was expected to begin \"shortly\" after the series was announced in April 2017. Burke noted that actresses [[Anna Kendrick]] and [[Shannon Purser]], who had both publicly expressed interest in portraying Squirrel Girl, had been discussed for that role. She added that the network had historically \"made a lot of stars\", but noted that the character put them in a unique position, saying \"The character is such a calling card. I'm interested to see if name actresses feel right for it.\"<ref name=\"THRApril2017\" /> Kendrick later admitted that she thought she had given \"one of those answers that just goes away\" and had no real interest in the role.<ref name=\"Kendrick\" /> By July 2017, Purser and [[Mae Whitman]], who had also publicly expressed interest in the role, were among those that had been seriously considered for the part, with the character having been written with Whitman in mind. Discussions of Whitman were cut short due to her commitments to the series ''[[Good Girls (TV series)|Good Girls]]''. In early July, the series cast was announced, with [[Milana Vayntrub]] as Doreen Green / Squirrel Girl, and [[Derek Theler]] as the series' co-lead [[Mister Immortal|Craig Hollis / Mister Immortal]]. Also announced were [[Jeremy Tardy]] as [[Night Thrasher (Dwayne Taylor)|Dwayne Taylor / Night Thrasher]], [[Calum Worthy]] as [[Robbie Baldwin|Robbie Baldwin / Speedball]], [[Matthew Moy]] as [[Microbe (comics)|Zach Smith / Microbe]], and [[Kate Comer]] as [[Debrii|Deborah Fields / Debrii]].<ref name=\"THRJuly2017\" /> In late July 2017, [[Keith David]] was cast in the recurring role of Ernest Vigman for the series.<ref name=\"KeithDavid\" />\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\nDiscussing the potential for ''New Warriors'' to connect to ''Cloak & Dagger'' in April 2017, Burke said that the two properties were \"not particularly connected\" given \"their tones are so wildly different\", adding, \"There are many degrees of separation with where they fall in the Marvel universe. But anything is possible with Marvel.\"<ref name=\"THRApril2017\" /> That July, Loeb said there were no plans to crossover the two series, nor to crossover them across networks with the similarly youth-oriented ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Marvel's Runaways]]'' on [[Hulu]]. He added that Marvel wanted ''New Warriors'' to find its footing before further connecting with other elements of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], saying \"You'll see things that comment on each other; we try to touch base wherever we can... It's being aware of it and trying to find a way for it to be able to discuss in a way that makes sense.\"<ref name=\"TCAJul2017THR\" />\n\n==Cancellation==\nIn November 2017, ''New Warriors'' was no longer set to air on Freeform. The completed pilot was said to have \"tested through the roof\", with high-level executives at [[Disney]] taking interest in the project. Marvel wanted the series to air in 2018, but Freeform found that it did not have room in its schedule for the series, and agreed to give the project back to Marvel; the studio would shop the series to new partners who could release the series in 2018, potentially only looking at companies that are Disney-owned, and hoping to secure a two-season pick-up from the new network. The series was still considered to be likely to produce multiple spinoffs in a similar model to Marvel's Netflix shows. Production on the remainder of ''New Warriors'' was scheduled to resume in January 2018, pending the series being picked-up by a new network.<ref name=\"NoFreeform\" />\n\nLoeb stated in June 2018 that Marvel Television was still looking for a network to air the series.<ref name=\"LoebAMAJun2018\" /> The studio discussed moving the series to Disney's streaming services [[Disney+]] and Hulu, but neither broadcaster was interested in picking-up the series.<ref name=\"NWCanceled\" /> By the end of September 2019, ''New Warriors'' was officially considered to be dead.<ref name=\"NWCanceled2\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of unproduced television projects based on Marvel Comics]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"MarvelPressRelease\">{{Cite web |url=https://news.marvel.com/tv/62577/marvels-new-warriors-headed-freeform-straight-series-order/ |title='Marvel's New Warriors' Headed to Freeform With Straight to Series Order |last=Storm |first=Marc |date=April 5, 2017 |website=[[Marvel Comics|Marvel.com]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6pVBsHJXC?url=https://news.marvel.com/tv/62577/marvels-new-warriors-headed-freeform-straight-series-order/ |archive-date=April 5, 2017 |access-date=April 5, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"THRApril2017\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/squirrel-girl-tv-series-freeform-orders-marvels-new-warriors-991277 |title=Marvel's 'New Warriors,' With Squirrel Girl, Ordered Straight-to-Series at Freeform (Exclusive) |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |date=April 5, 2017 |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6pVBsNbPa?url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/squirrel-girl-tv-series-freeform-orders-marvels-new-warriors-991277 |archive-date=April 5, 2017 |access-date=April 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"TVLineAug2016\">{{Cite web |url=http://tvline.com/2016/08/30/squirrel-girl-tv-series-comedy-new-warriors-marvel/ |title=Squirrel Girl on TV?
