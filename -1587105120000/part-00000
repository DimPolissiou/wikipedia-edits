[[Earthquake]]s occurred prior to this first day of eruption. Once the cinder cone started erupting, it continued for 15 years, eventually stopping in 1774. El Jorullo destroyed what had been a rich agricultural area. It grew approximately 820 feet (250 meters) from the ground in the first six weeks. The eruptions from El Jorullo were primarily [[phreatic eruption|phreatic]] and [[phreatomagmatic]]. They covered the area with sticky mud flows, water flows and [[Volcanic ash|ash falls]]. All but the youngest lava flows were covered by this ash fall.\n\nLater eruptions from El Jorullo were magmatic with neither mud nor water flows. This 15 year eruption was the longest one El Jorullo has had, and was the longest cinder cone eruption known. Lava flows can still be seen to the north and west of the cinder cone. The eruption had a [[VEI]] of 4.<ref>{{cite gvp|vnum=1401\u201306=&volpage=erupt|title=Michoac\u00e1n-Guanajuato: Eruptive History}}</ref>\n\nIts current elevation is 1,320 meters (4,331&nbsp;ft), and its crater is about 1,300 by 1,640 feet (400 by 500 meters) wide and 490 feet (150 meters) deep.\n\nEl Jorullo has four smaller cinder cones which have grown from its flanks. The vents of El Jorullo are aligned in a northeast to southwest direction. Lava from these vents cover nine km<sup>2</sup> around the volcano. Later eruptions produced lavas that had higher [[silica]] contents making them more viscous than the earlier [[basalt]]s and [[basaltic andesite]] lavas.\n\n===El Par\u00edcutin \u2014 1943\u22121952===\n{{Main|Par\u00edcutin}}\nThe [[Par\u00edcutin]] volcano began as a [[fissure vent|fissure]] in a cornfield owned by a [[Pur\u00e9pecha people|Pur\u00e9pecha]] farmer, Dionisio Pulido, on February 20, 1943. Pulido, his wife, and their son all witnessed the initial [[eruption]] of ash and stones first-hand as they ploughed the field. El Par\u00edcutin grew quickly, reaching five stories tall in just a week, and it could be seen from afar in a month. Much of the volcano's growth occurred during its first year, while it was still in the explosive [[pyroclastic flow|pyroclastic]] phase. The nearby villages of Paricut\u00edn (after which the volcano was named) and [[Nuevo San Juan Parangaricutiro|San Juan Parangaricutiro]] were both buried in lava and ash;. The residents relocated to nearby lands.\n\nAt the end of the first phase, after roughly one year, the cinder cone had grown {{cvt|336|m}} tall.  For the next eight years El Par\u00edcutin would continue erupting, although this was dominated by relatively quiet eruptions of lava that would scorch the surrounding {{cvt|25|km2|mi2}} of land. The cinder cone's activity would slowly decline during this period until the last six months of the eruption, during which violent and explosive activity was frequent.\n\nIn 1952 the eruption ended and Par\u00edcutin went quiet, attaining a final height of {{cvt|424|m}} from the cornfield where it began. Like most [[cinder cone]]s, Par\u00edcutin is believed to be a [[monogenetic volcano]], which means that once it has finished erupting, it will never erupt again.

See [[list of particles]] for a more detailed list of particles found in [[particle physics]].''\n\nThis article contains a '''list of mesons''', unstable [[subatomic particle]]s composed of one [[quark]] and one [[antiquark]]. They are part of the [[hadron]] particle family \u2013 particles made of quarks. The other members of the hadron family are the [[baryon]]s \u2013 subatomic particles composed of three quarks. The main difference between [[meson]]s and baryons is that mesons have integer [[spin (physics)|spin]] (thus are [[boson]]s) while baryons are [[fermion]]s (half-integer spin). [[Spin-statistics theorem|Because mesons are bosons]], the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] does not apply to them. Because of this, they can act as [[force carrier|force mediating particle]]s on short distances, and thus play a part in processes such as the [[nuclear interaction]].\n\nSince mesons are composed of quarks, they participate in both the [[weak interaction|weak]] and [[strong interaction]]s. Mesons with net [[electric charge]] also participate in the [[electromagnetic interaction]]. They are classified according to their quark content, [[total angular momentum]], [[parity (physics)|parity]], and various other properties such as [[C-parity]] and [[G-parity]]. While no meson is stable, those of lower [[mass]] are nonetheless more stable than the most massive mesons, and are easier to observe and study in [[particle accelerator]]s or in [[cosmic ray]] experiments. They are also typically less massive than baryons, meaning that they are more easily produced in experiments, and will exhibit higher-energy phenomena sooner than baryons would. For example, the charm quark was first seen in the [[J/\u03c8 meson|J/Psi meson]] ({{Subatomic particle|J/psi}}) in 1974,<ref>J.J. Aubert ''et al.'' (1974)</ref><ref>J.E. Augustin ''et al.'' (1974)</ref> and the bottom quark in the [[upsilon meson]] ({{Subatomic particle|Upsilon}}) in 1977.<ref>S.W. Herb ''et al.'' (1977)</ref>The top quark was first observed at Fermilab in 1995.\n\nEach meson has a corresponding [[antiparticle]] (antimeson) where quarks are replaced by their corresponding antiquarks and vice versa. For example, a positive [[pion]] ({{Subatomic particle|Pion+}}) is made of one up quark and one down antiquark; and its corresponding antiparticle, the negative pion ({{Subatomic particle|Pion-}}), is made of one up antiquark and one down quark. Some experiments show the evidence of ''[[tetraquark]]s'' \u2013 \"exotic\" mesons made of two quarks and two antiquarks, but the particle physics community as a whole does not view their existence as likely, although still possible.<ref name=PDGTetraquarks2008>C. Amsler ''et al.'' (2008): [http://pdg.lbl.gov/2008/reviews/charmonium_states_m801.pdf Charmonium States]</ref>\n\nThe symbols encountered in these lists are: I (''[[isospin]]''), J (''[[total angular momentum]]''), P (''[[parity (physics)|parity]]''), C (''[[C-parity]]''), G (''[[G-parity]]''), u (''[[up quark]]''), d (''[[down quark]]''), s (''[[strange quark]]''), c (''[[charm quark]]''), b (''[[bottom quark]]''), Q (''[[charge (physics)|charge]]''), B (''[[baryon number]]''), S (''[[strangeness]]''), C (''[[charm (quantum number)|charm]]''), and B\u2032 (''[[bottomness]]''), as well as a wide array of subatomic particles (hover for name).\n\n==Summary table==\nBecause this table was initially derived from published results and many of those results were preliminary, as many as 64 of the mesons in the following table may not exist or have the wrong mass or quantum numbers. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Meson summary table<ref>K.A.

See [[list of particles]] for a more detailed list of particles found in [[particle physics]].''\n\nThis article contains a '''list of mesons''', unstable [[subatomic particle]]s composed of one [[quark]] and one [[antiquark]]. They are part of the [[hadron]] particle family \u2013 particles made of quarks. The other members of the hadron family are the [[baryon]]s \u2013 subatomic particles composed of three quarks. The main difference between [[meson]]s and baryons is that mesons have integer [[spin (physics)|spin]] (thus are [[boson]]s) while baryons are [[fermion]]s (half-integer spin). [[Spin-statistics theorem|Because mesons are bosons]], the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] does not apply to them. Because of this, they can act as [[force carrier|force mediating particle]]s on short distances, and thus play a part in processes such as the [[nuclear interaction]].\n\nSince mesons are composed of quarks, they participate in both the [[weak interaction|weak]] and [[strong interaction]]s. Mesons with net [[electric charge]] also participate in the [[electromagnetic interaction]]. They are classified according to their quark content, [[total angular momentum]], [[parity (physics)|parity]], and various other properties such as [[C-parity]] and [[G-parity]]. While no meson is stable, those of lower [[mass]] are nonetheless more stable than the most massive mesons, and are easier to observe and study in [[particle accelerator]]s or in [[cosmic ray]] experiments. They are also typically less massive than baryons, meaning that they are more easily produced in experiments, and will exhibit higher-energy phenomena sooner than baryons would. For example, the charm quark was first seen in the [[J/\u03c8 meson|J/Psi meson]] ({{Subatomic particle|J/psi}}) in 1974,<ref>J.J. Aubert ''et al.'' (1974)</ref><ref>J.E. Augustin ''et al.'' (1974)</ref> and the bottom quark in the [[upsilon meson]] ({{Subatomic particle|Upsilon}}) in 1977.<ref>S.W. Herb ''et al.'' (1977)</ref>\n\nEach meson has a corresponding [[antiparticle]] (antimeson) where quarks are replaced by their corresponding antiquarks and vice versa. For example, a positive [[pion]] ({{Subatomic particle|Pion+}}) is made of one up quark and one down antiquark; and its corresponding antiparticle, the negative pion ({{Subatomic particle|Pion-}}), is made of one up antiquark and one down quark. Some experiments show the evidence of ''[[tetraquark]]s'' \u2013 \"exotic\" mesons made of two quarks and two antiquarks, but the particle physics community as a whole does not view their existence as likely, although still possible.<ref name=PDGTetraquarks2008>C. Amsler ''et al.'' (2008): [http://pdg.lbl.gov/2008/reviews/charmonium_states_m801.pdf Charmonium States]</ref>\n\nThe symbols encountered in these lists are: I (''[[isospin]]''), J (''[[total angular momentum]]''), P (''[[parity (physics)|parity]]''), C (''[[C-parity]]''), G (''[[G-parity]]''), u (''[[up quark]]''), d (''[[down quark]]''), s (''[[strange quark]]''), c (''[[charm quark]]''), b (''[[bottom quark]]''), Q (''[[charge (physics)|charge]]''), B (''[[baryon number]]''), S (''[[strangeness]]''), C (''[[charm (quantum number)|charm]]''), and B\u2032 (''[[bottomness]]''), as well as a wide array of subatomic particles (hover for name).\n\n==Summary table==\nBecause this table was initially derived from published results and many of those results were preliminary, as many as 64 of the mesons in the following table may not exist or have the wrong mass or quantum numbers. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Meson summary table<ref>K.A.

The US government threatened to place 100 percent [[tariffs]] on all Japanese luxury import cars, but not including SUVs. The LX 450 was produced as a [[badge engineering|rebadged]] model (in contrast with other Lexus efforts which were independently or divergently developed from Toyota vehicles), giving a model that was exempt from the tariff.<ref name=relentless>Dawson, Chester. ''Lexus: The Relentless Pursuit'', p.  161. 2004: Jon Wiley & Sons, NJ.</ref>  Ultimately a [[gentlemen's agreement]] was reached and the threatened tariffs did not materialize.\n\nThe LX 450 replaced the Land Cruiser in the Canadian market starting after 1996, reducing internal competition (big expensive SUVs have traditionally faced a difficult market in Canada) and avoiding the issue of selling a rebadged model (except for GM, Ford and Chrysler, rebadged models in Canada have not met with success).

Suspension included [[Adjustable Height Control]] (AHC) hydraulic suspension and [[Adaptive Variable Suspension]] (AVS). The AHC could raise the vehicle for off-roading and return to a normal driving height reducing the center of gravity and wind resistance. The lowest setting for when the vehicle was stopped allowed for easier entry, exit and loading. AVS alters [[shock absorber]] firmness in under 2.5 milliseconds at each wheel, individually selecting from a range of 64 settings depending on road conditions and driver input such as steering-wheel activity, braking and acceleration. The AVS system used a switch for the driver's preferences including \"normal\", \"comfort\" and \"sport\" modes.\n\nA DVD-based [[automotive navigation system|navigation system]] was offered starting in 2001, [[Nakamichi]] stereo with in-dash six-disc CD changer (discontinued after 2000 - Mark and Levinson was offered from 2001 up), [[electrochromic]] power folding [[side mirror]]s, and a smog sensor for the [[HVAC]] system were offered.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.insideline.com/lexus/lx-470/1999/full-test-1999-lexus-lx470.html |title=Full Test: 1999 Lexus LX470 All Hail the King! |publisher=Edmunds.com |date=1999-01-01 |accessdate=2010-10-30}}</ref> For 2000 models, [[Vehicle Stability Control]] and [[brake assist]] were made standard, along with Toyota's new A-TRAC (Active Traction Control System). \n\n=== 2002\u20132005 ===\nDuring 2002 for the 2003 model year, Lexus introduced minor tweaks to the exterior, a 5 speed transmission{{cn|date=July 2019}} including larger standard 18-inch wheels, a new front bumper, etc. The interior was substantially overhauled, adopting the corresponding updates to the Land Cruiser's interior, and with [[Bluetooth]] and a [[backup camera]] now available. In the US, both were optional with the camera coupled with the navigation system, due to the shared screen. Lexus increased power from {{convert|230|hp|kW|abbr=on|0|order=flip}} to {{convert|235|hp|kW|abbr=on|0|order=flip}}.  The updated engine now met CARB ULEV-II emission standards.  Lexus added front row [[side torso airbag]]s and [[side curtain airbag]]s, [[electronic brakeforce distribution]] and [[rain sensor|rain-sensing]] [[windshield wipers]] as standard. An 11-speaker [[Mark Levinson Audio Systems|Mark Levinson]] premium sound system and a DVD Rear-Seat Entertainment System (RSES) were made optional. Other new features included [[Lexus Link]], an emergency service similar to GM's [[Onstar]], in North America.\n\n[[Night View]] infrared camera safety system was offered as an option in 2002, the world's first active automotive [[night vision]] system, projecting information on the windshield using a [[head-up display]]; the driver could vary brightness using a dimmer knob. The 2003 LX 470 came with [[Variable Gear Ratio Steering (VGRS)]] system, varying steering ratios from 12.4 to 1 to 18.0 to 1 (previously fixed at 19.8 to 1), allowing the driver to apply less steering input to maneuver in tight places such as parking lots.

The final design was approved in 2004, with testing being conducted into early 2007 on development prototypes and late 2007 on pre-production models. The final design patent for the J200 series Lexus LX was filed on March 27, 2007.\n\n[[File:2008-2011 Lexus LX 570 (URJ201R) Sports Luxury wagon (2011-04-28) 03.jpg|thumb|left|2010 Lexus LX 570 Sport]]\n\nThe LX 570 is {{convert|102|mm|in|abbr=on|0}} longer overall and {{convert|1|in|abbr=on|order=flip}} wider, while retaining the same wheelbase. It loses the plastic lower body side cladding leaving the paint exposed. A third of the frame's body mass is made from high-tensile steel, along with the entire [[B-pillar]], and all three [[crossmember]]s are [[hydroformed]] steel. Like the Toyota Tundra the tow hitch is integrated into the frame. The front suspension now uses [[double wishbone]]s, replacing the [[torsion beam]], which gives {{convert|9|in|abbr=on|order=flip|round=5}} of suspension travel, while the rear continues to use a [[multi-link suspension]] with a [[solid axle|solid rear axle]] for strength and durability. The LX platform has logged 240,000 test kilometers through subtropical forests, the Australian [[Outback]] and American [[deserts]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pressroom.com.au/press_kit_detail.asp?clientID=3&navSectionID=6&categoryID=1000&kitID=252 |title=LX 570 tried and tested around the globe |publisher=Pressroom.com.au |date=2008-03-31 |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref>\n\nThe LX 570 comes standard with 20-inch-wheels, a four-wheel electro-hydraulic suspension with an updated six-setting AHC system that can raise the vehicle by {{convert|3|in|abbr=on|0|order=flip|round=5}} or lower it by {{convert|2|in|abbr=on|0|order=flip|round=5}} from its normal ride height using a knob in the [[center console (automobile)|center console]].  The front suspension's [[airbag suspension|air bag]] spring rates are variable, but not continuously like a fully [[active suspension]] arrangement. The AVS provides more immediate [[shock absorber|damper]] firmness adjustments that are diagonally cross-linked through a mechanical system using hydraulic fluid, similar to the [[Toyota 4Runner#Fourth generation (2003\u20132009)|4Runner]]'s X-REAS system.\n\nOther performance features include a [[Crawl Control]] (more advanced version of [[Downhill Assist Control]]) system that negotiates off-road obstacles in both forward and reverse at low speeds by automatically providing throttle and braking inputs for less experienced off-road drivers: an interior lever allows the driver to reduce speed. A multi-terrain [[anti-lock braking system]] gives shorter stopping distances on surfaces such as sand or gravel. [[Hill-start Assist Control]] (HAC) prevents rolling backwards on hills or slippery surfaces.<ref name=LX570/>\n\nThe interior includes amenities, standard and optional, featured in the 2007 [[Lexus LS|LS 460]], such as semi-[[aniline leather]] seats, four-zone climate control, a 19-speaker 450 Watt [[Mark Levinson Audio Systems|Mark Levinson]] surround-sound stereo system with hard-drive memory storage, a hard-drive-based navigation system, [[XM satellite radio]] with NavTraffic as standard, a two-piece power liftgate/tailgate and Lexus Intuitive Park Assist, sonar parking assistance. Other features include [[Bubinga]] wood trim (a form of [[Rosewood (timber)|African rosewood]] also used in private aircraft and high-quality instruments), a center console cooler for storage of cold drinks, power sliding rear seats, power third row seats, and a {{convert|9|in|0|order=flip|round=5}} DVD rear-seat entertainment system.<ref name=LX570/>\n\nIt also has the updated Lexus fifth-generation hard-drive-based navigation system with an 8&nbsp;inch high-resolution VGA display. Lexus' [[keyless entry|keyless]] [[SmartAccess]] with an ultra-thin \"smart card\" key is standard with 10 airbags including [[knee airbag]]s for driver and front passenger and second row side torso airbags, and the [[Adaptive Front-lighting System]] (AFS) is standard, while the [[Pre-Collision System]] (PCS) and [[Dynamic Radar Cruise Control]] systems are options.<ref name=LX570/> Active front headrests debut this Lexus safety feature for the first time on an SUV in the U.S. A new Wide-view Front and Side Monitor system uses a camera mounted on the grille giving a 180-degree view in front and a camera mounted on the passenger side of the [[side mirror]] helps eliminate blind spots at low speeds useful in parking lots or off-road adventures. Night View was discontinued.\n\nIn 2009, the LX 570 received J.D.

Suspension included [[Adjustable Height Control]] (AHC) hydraulic suspension and [[Adaptive Variable Suspension]] (AVS). The AHC could raise the vehicle for off-roading and return to a normal driving height reducing the center of gravity and wind resistance. The lowest setting for when the vehicle was stopped allowed for easier entry, exit and loading. AVS alters [[shock absorber]] firmness in under 2.5 milliseconds at each wheel, individually selecting from a range of 64 settings depending on road conditions and driver input such as steering-wheel activity, braking and acceleration.

An 11-speaker [[Mark Levinson Audio Systems|Mark Levinson]] premium sound system and a DVD Rear-Seat Entertainment System (RSES) were made optional. Other new features included [[Lexus Link]], an emergency service similar to GM's [[Onstar]], in North America.\n\n[[Night View]] infrared camera safety system was offered as an option in 2002, the world's first active automotive [[night vision]] system, projecting information on the windshield using a [[head-up display]]; the driver could vary brightness using a dimmer knob. The 2003 LX 470 came with [[Variable Gear Ratio Steering (VGRS)]] system, varying steering ratios from 12.4 to 1 to 18.0 to 1 (previously fixed at 19.8 to 1), allowing the driver to apply less steering input to maneuver in tight places such as parking lots.

This granted her all of the quintessential Spider-Man powers, and Stacy began her career as Spider-Woman. In her regular life, she begins a relationship with Peter Parker, forms a friend group with Parker, and ostracizes new student Harry Osborn, who is later revealed to have had a crush on her. Meanwhile, Peter becomes infatuated with Spider-Woman, without knowing that she is Stacy. The bullied Peter's suffering worsens, and eventually, he creates a formula that turns him into a lizard mutant.\n\nOn [[prom]] night, after he is being bullied yet again, he injects himself with the formula and transforms, going psycho. Gwen Stacy dons her Spider-Woman costume and fights Peter, defeating and accidentally killing him. Peter regresses to his human form in Gwen's arms, telling her he just wanted to \"be special\" like her and prompting her to realize what she has done. She runs from the scene, creating the public misconception that Spider-Woman has murdered Peter Parker and is a menace to society and setting up the ''Spider-Gwen'' series.\n\n=== Volume 0 ===\n\nBefore the [[Spider-Verse]] event that introduced Spider-Gwen, Stacy's father George Stacy was ordered as captain of the NYPD to hunt down and detain Spider-Woman, considered a public menace. Captain Stacy\u2014unaware of Spider-Gwen's secret identity\u2014is more than happy to do so. Upon hearing about this, Wilson Fisk, aka the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], one of New York's most prominent crime bosses, decides to ally himself with Spider-Gwen\u2014for reasons unexplained\u2014and has corrupt lawyer [[Matt Murdock]] ([[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] on [[Earth-616]], the main Marvel universe) send the assassin [[Rhino (comics)|Aleksei Sytsevich]] to kill Captain Stacy. Gwen arrives and saves her father, who corners her at gunpoint. To avoid getting shot, she reveals to her father that she is Spider-Woman.\n\nAfter the Spider-verse event, Gwen goes back to her ordinary life of bumming around by day and Spider-Woman-ing by night. Her father passes the Spider-Woman investigation on to detective [[Punisher|Frank Castle]]. Suddenly the villain Vulture appears, secretly working for the Kingpin, and causes trouble for Gwen (Spider Ham appears for a short time as a hallucination because of an attack). Gwen defeats Vulture and in the end he is put away, Murdock continuing to influence him from behind bars. Frank Castle increases his efforts against Spider-Woman, becoming more and more ruthless. Castle eventually makes the connection with Spider-Woman's identity and enlists the help of [[Kraven the Hunter]] to perform a siege on the Stacy house. Castle and Kraven brutally beat down Gwen after she gets her father to safety. The volume concludes when Gwen decides to take a stand against Castle and not run any longer, blindsiding him as he unmasks her while trying to get away.\n\n=== Volume 1 ===\nGwen is unsure of how secure her secret identity is as she hides from her father and awaits the recollection of Frank Castle. Her problems are put to the side when a Lizard appears on the streets, seemingly having taken something similar to Peter Parker's formula. The dog of Spider-Gwen's \"arch-nemesis\", Bodega Bandit, is eaten by the Lizard. Tracking the Lizard into the sewer, Spider-Woman encounters a pack of Lizard men. Earth 65's [[Falcon (comics)|Captain America]], Samantha Wilson, shows up to capture the Lizards and Spider Gwen as well. Gwen battles CA while avoiding the Lizards. Gwen saves CA from the Lizards and they part ways on good terms. After a quick chat with Jessica Drew of Earth 616, Gwen and the Mary Janes go on a camping trip where Harry Osborn makes a surprise appearance. He explains his connection with S.H.I.E.L.D. and his motive to go after Spider-Woman. He appears nights later in a green mechanical suit accompanied by an army of orange robots to kill Spider-Woman. After an issue-long battle, Harry sets off an explosion to even the playing field. As Gwen lies on the floor, Harry drinks a vial of the Lizard formula and unmasks her to his surprise. After an issue break from the fight, involving a story line of George Stacy conversing with Matt Murdock, Gwen resumes her fight with a now mutated Harry Osborn with the assistance of Captain America. Gwen eventually convinces Harry that he is in the wrong and allows him to run from S.H.I.E.L.D. Gwen reconciles with her father in the end and he quits his job.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''[[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Gwen Stacy / Spider-Woman / Ghost-Spider]]''' \u2013 A variation of [[Gwen Stacy]] that was bitten by the radioactive spider that turned Peter Parker into Spider-Man.

''Spider-Gwen'' explores a universe where Gwen Stacy was bitten by the radioactive spider instead of Peter Parker, forcing her into a career as the [[Spider-Woman]] of her world, Earth-65.\n\n==Publication history==\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Spider-Gwen concept.png|thumb|Detailed Costume Design]] -->\nA spider-powered Gwen Stacy was first envisioned by longtime Spider-Man writer [[Dan Slott]] for the 2014\u201315 \"[[Spider-Verse]]\" storyline.

This granted her all of the quintessential Spider-Man powers, and Stacy began her career as Spider-Woman. In her regular life, she begins a relationship with Peter Parker, forms a friend group with Parker, and ostracizes new student Harry Osborn, who is later revealed to have had a crush on her. Meanwhile, Peter becomes infatuated with Spider-Woman, without knowing that she is Stacy. The bullied Peter's suffering worsens, and eventually, he creates a formula that turns him into a lizard mutant.\n\nOn [[prom]] night, after he is being bullied yet again, he injects himself with the formula and transforms, going psycho. Gwen Stacy dons her Spider-Woman costume and fights Peter, defeating and accidentally killing him. Peter regresses to his human form in Gwen's arms, telling her he just wanted to \"be special\" like her and prompting her to realize what she has done. She runs from the scene, creating the public misconception that Spider-Woman has murdered Peter Parker and is a menace to society and setting up the ''Spider-Gwen'' series.\n\n=== Volume 0 ===\n\nBefore the [[Spider-Verse]] event that introduced Spider-Gwen, Stacy's father George Stacy was ordered as captain of the NYPD to hunt down and detain Spider-Woman, considered a public menace. Captain Stacy\u2014unaware of Spider-Gwen's secret identity\u2014is more than happy to do so. Upon hearing about this, Wilson Fisk, aka the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], one of New York's most prominent crime bosses, decides to ally himself with Spider-Gwen\u2014for reasons unexplained\u2014and has corrupt lawyer [[Matt Murdock]] ([[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] on [[Earth-616]], the main Marvel universe) send the assassin [[Rhino (comics)|Aleksei Sytsevich]] to kill Captain Stacy. Gwen arrives and saves her father, who corners her at gunpoint. To avoid getting shot, she reveals to her father that she is Spider-Woman.\n\nAfter the Spider-verse event, Gwen goes back to her ordinary life of bumming around by day and Spider-Woman-ing by night. Her father passes the Spider-Woman investigation on to detective [[Punisher|Frank Castle]]. Suddenly the villain Vulture appears, secretly working for the Kingpin, and causes trouble for Gwen (Spider Ham appears for a short time as a hallucination because of an attack). Gwen defeats Vulture and in the end he is put away, Murdock continuing to influence him from behind bars. Frank Castle increases his efforts against Spider-Woman, becoming more and more ruthless. Castle eventually makes the connection with Spider-Woman's identity and enlists the help of [[Kraven the Hunter]] to perform a siege on the Stacy house. Castle and Kraven brutally beat down Gwen after she gets her father to safety. The volume concludes when Gwen decides to take a stand against Castle and not run any longer, blindsiding him as he unmasks her while trying to get away.\n\n=== Volume 1 ===\nGwen is unsure of how secure her secret identity is as she hides from her father and awaits the recollection of Frank Castle. Her problems are put to the side when a Lizard appears on the streets, seemingly having taken something similar to Peter Parker's formula. The dog of Spider-Gwen's \"arch-nemesis\", Bodega Bandit, is eaten by the Lizard. Tracking the Lizard into the sewer, Spider-Woman encounters a pack of Lizard men. Earth 65's [[Falcon (comics)|Captain America]], Samantha Wilson, shows up to capture the Lizards and Spider Gwen as well. Gwen battles CA while avoiding the Lizards. Gwen saves CA from the Lizards and they part ways on good terms. After a quick chat with Jessica Drew of Earth 616, Gwen and the Mary Janes go on a camping trip where Harry Osborn makes a surprise appearance. He explains his connection with S.H.I.E.L.D. and his motive to go after Spider-Woman. He appears nights later in a green mechanical suit accompanied by an army of orange robots to kill Spider-Woman. After an issue-long battle, Harry sets off an explosion to even the playing field. As Gwen lies on the floor, Harry drinks a vial of the Lizard formula and unmasks her to his surprise. After an issue break from the fight, involving a story line of George Stacy conversing with Matt Murdock, Gwen resumes her fight with a now mutated Harry Osborn with the assistance of Captain America. Gwen eventually convinces Harry that he is in the wrong and allows him to run from S.H.I.E.L.D. Gwen reconciles with her father in the end and he quits his job.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''[[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Gwen Stacy / Spider-Woman / Ghost-Spider]]''' \u2013 A variation of [[Gwen Stacy]] that was bitten by the radioactive spider that turned Peter Parker into Spider-Man.
