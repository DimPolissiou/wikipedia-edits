Basically, an arch dam is a structure that curves upstream and the water pressure is transferred either directly to the valley sides or indirectly through concrete abutments.<ref name=Chanson/><ref name=History/> Theoretically, the ideal constant angle arch in a \"V\"-shaped valley for such an arch dam has a central angle of 133\u00b0 of curvature. This theory led to the development of the \"constant-angle\" (or variable radius) arch dam, which was also thinner in design. The theory was first initiated in North America for several dams, and in Alaska in particular, in 1913 with the building of the Salmon Creek Dam, which was completed in 1914.<ref name=Chanson/><ref name=History/> In this regard, [[Bartlett L. Thane|Bartlett Lee Thane]], the mining engineer, who made a lasting impact in the mining industry \u2013 in the [[Alaska-Gastineau Mining Company]] \u2013  was instrumental in introducing this design of thin arch dam with help from his former football team mates.<ref name=magazine/><ref name=Develop/><ref name=Thane>{{Cite web|url=http://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/thane.php|title= Bartlett Lee Thane|accessdate=2010-07-15|publisher= Alaska Mining Hall of Fame}}</ref><ref name=structure>{{Cite web |url=\nhttp://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?ID=s0000933|title= Salmon Creek Dam|accessdate=2010-07-15|publisher= Structurae}}</ref> Lars Jorgensen evolved the specific first design of the constant arch dam.<ref name= Jackson>{{Cite book|last= Jackson|first= Donald Conrad|title= Building the ultimate dam: John S.

Wallenberg for the Salmon Creek Dam. The idea for building such a dam had been thought about 30 years earlier to economize on the use of construction material for building the dam. However, it was only in 1913 that the concept was transformed on ground by the pioneer mining engineer Thane.<ref name=Chanson/><ref name=Thane/><ref name=structure/>\n\n==Theory and design==\nIn arch dam design, two basic shapes are adopted. These are the constant\u2013radius arch and the constant-angle arch, the latter design is more complex. In the constant-radius arch design, which is also known as the single-radius arch, the shape of the dam is cylindrical with vertical upstream face while the downstream face is [[Batter (walls)|battered]].<ref name=Develop>{{Cite web|url=http://www.traianvs.net/textos/archdams_en.htm|title=Historical Development of Arch Dams|work= Terminology and Discussion of Fig 10 |accessdate=2010-07-14|publisher=Traianvs}}</ref> The constant-angle arch design has also a variable\u2013radius arch. In this design, the central opening angle is constant whereas the arch radius increases from the base to the crest; this increase towards the crest is proportional to the increase of the canyon width of the gorge. Further, according to the theory of constant-arch design, the arch action at the base of the dam exerts the maximum pressure on the base. A \"V\" shaped gorge in particular is considered an ideal feature for building this type of dam. This design ensures substantial savings in use of construction material as opposed to the constant\u2013radius arch design. Lars R. Jorgenson who had conceived this concept had proved that the most economic design of the dam was obtained with an optimum opening angle of 133.6\u00b0, with the least quantity of concrete.<ref name=Develop/> This design was applied with some modifications for the Salmon Creek Dam, which was designed with constant opening angle of 113\u00b0 with radius varying from {{Convert|147.5|ft|m|sp=us}} at the base to {{Convert|331|ft|m|sp=us}} at the crest.<ref name=Develop/>\n[[File:Salmon Creek Dam Spillway pipe of 4 ft dia in full flow and an adventurous Climb down the dam slope.jpg|left|thumb|The spillway pipe has a diameter of {{convert|4|ft|m}}.

The aggregates were mixed in designed proportions with cement and with a small admixture of lime to manufacture concrete for placing on the dam. The first batch of [[concrete]] was placed on the dam on July 14, 1913. The dam was completed, over a 13 months period, on August 13, 1914. A concrete quantity of {{convert|54000|cuyd|m3}} was placed on the dam. Concrete was placed at the rate of {{convert|400|cuyd|m3}} per day.<ref name=History/><ref name=magazine/>\n\nBetween 1912 and 1914, two power stations were built to utilize the water stored in the reservoir created by the dam. The first power station, the upper powerhouse titled 'Powerhouse 2', was located {{convert|1|mi|km}} below the dam and had an installation of two units of 1.5 MW capacity each operating under a [[hydraulic head]] of {{Convert|600|ft|m}}. The tail waters from this power station was conveyed through a {{Convert|10000|ft|m}} long power channel to the second power station titled 'Powerhouse 1' located on the shore of the Gastineau Channel. The power house at this location also had two units of 1.5 MW capacity each operating under a head of {{Convert|500|ft|m}}. Thus, the total generation from the two power stations was {{convert|6000|kW|hp|abbr=on}}. In 1916, the average load on the two power stations was {{convert|5187|hp|kW}}. Near Powerhouse 1 on the shore, office buildings, machine shops, saw mills, canteen and housing facilities for staff were also built.<ref name=History/><ref name=Mines/>\n\n==Rehabilitation==\nSince its completion, the dam and its two power stations have gone through many rehabilitation measures. Power House 2 was damaged in a fire in 1923. It was rehabilitated in 1935. It was finally abandoned in 1998.<ref name=History/><ref name=energy/>\n\nWith aging, the dam also needed to be rehabilitated and work was carried out in 1967. Deteriorated concrete was removed, the dam body was regrouted and the upstream face of the dam was provided with a layer of high strength concrete in the top {{convert|45|ft}}.<ref name=History/><ref name=energy/>\n\nThe lower power house also underwent major rehabilitation measures. It was shut down in December 1974 due to the high cost of operation and maintenance.

The generating capacity of the power station is 29.5 GWh annually, which accounts for nearly 10% of Juneau's power demand. Alaska Electric Light and Power operates and maintains the system.<ref name=History/>\n\n===Drinking water supply===\nSalmon Creek reservoir is a secondary source of drinking water which is provided in conjunction with Alaska Electric Light and Power Company (AEL&P). Water is drawn from near the Salmon Creek power generation plant, which is located near sea level. Tail waters from the power station are then pumped to a water treatment plant for membrane filtration, chlorination, and pH and alkalinity adjustment with soda ash before the water is supplied to the distribution system. This system was commissioned by the City Borough of Juneau (CBJ) in 2015. The reservoir is also used as chlorine contact tanks, where [[chlorine]] is added for purification and given time to react with any [[pathogens]], before it is supplied to the city. However, this source is subject to seasonal high turbidity and also interruptions due to the annual maintenance of the generator units. This system is able to supply {{convert|2000000|USgal|m3}} of water. The water resources are generally pollution-free and quality is monitored and tested every month to check for drinking-water standards set by the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] and Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC).<ref name=water>{{Cite web|url=http://www.juneau.lib.ak.us/water/h2odistr.php\\|title= Water Utility|accessdate=2010-07-15|publisher=City Borough of Juneau Alaska capital City}}</ref><ref name=Environ>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/of/text/of95-0412.PDF|format=pdf|title= Overview of Environmental and Hydrogeologic Conditions near Juneau, Alaska|pages=12\u201313|accessdate=2010-07-15|publisher= U.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with the Federal Aviation Administration}}</ref>\n\n===Fisheries===\nIn 1880, the Salmon Creek was named by Richard Harris and Joe Juneau (during their first visit to the area for gold prospecting).

Basically, an arch dam is a structure that curves upstream and the water pressure is transferred either directly to the valley sides or indirectly through concrete abutments.<ref name=Chanson/><ref name=History/> Theoretically, the ideal constant angle arch in a \"V\"-shaped valley for such an arch dam has a central angle of 133\u00b0 of curvature. This theory led to the development of the \"constant-angle\" (or variable radius) arch dam, which was also thinner in design. The theory was first initiated in North America for several dams, and in Alaska in particular, in 1913 with the building of the Salmon Creek Dam, which was completed in 1914.<ref name=Chanson/><ref name=History/> In this regard, [[Bartlett L. Thane|Bartlett Lee Thane]], the mining engineer, who made a lasting impact in the mining industry \u2013 in the [[Alaska-Gastineau Mining Company]] \u2013  was instrumental in introducing this design of thin arch dam with help from his former football team mates.<ref name=magazine/><ref name=Develop/><ref name=Thane>{{Cite web|url=http://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/thane.php|title= Bartlett Lee Thane|accessdate=2010-07-15|publisher= Alaska Mining Hall of Fame}}</ref><ref name=structure>{{Cite web |url=\nhttp://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?ID=s0000933|title= Salmon Creek Dam|accessdate=2010-07-15|publisher= Structurae}}</ref> Lars Jorgensen evolved the specific first design of the constant arch dam.<ref name= Jackson>{{Cite book|last= Jackson|first= Donald Conrad|title= Building the ultimate dam: John S.

Wallenberg for the Salmon Creek Dam. The idea for building such a dam had been thought about 30 years earlier to economize on the use of construction material for building the dam. However, it was only in 1913 that the concept was transformed on ground by the pioneer mining engineer Thane.<ref name=Chanson/><ref name=Thane/><ref name=structure/>\n\n==Theory and design==\nIn arch dam design, two basic shapes are adopted. These are the constant\u2013radius arch and the constant-angle arch, the latter design is more complex. In the constant-radius arch design, which is also known as the single-radius arch, the shape of the dam is cylindrical with vertical upstream face while the downstream face is [[Batter (walls)|battered]].<ref name=Develop>{{Cite web|url=http://www.traianvs.net/textos/archdams_en.htm|title=Historical Development of Arch Dams|work= Terminology and Discussion of Fig 10 |accessdate=2010-07-14|publisher=Traianvs}}</ref> The constant-angle arch design has also a variable\u2013radius arch. In this design, the central opening angle is constant whereas the arch radius increases from the base to the crest; this increase towards the crest is proportional to the increase of the canyon width of the gorge. Further, according to the theory of constant-arch design, the arch action at the base of the dam exerts the maximum pressure on the base. A \"V\" shaped gorge in particular is considered an ideal feature for building this type of dam. This design ensures substantial savings in use of construction material as opposed to the constant\u2013radius arch design. Lars R. Jorgenson who had conceived this concept had proved that the most economic design of the dam was obtained with an optimum opening angle of 133.6\u00b0, with the least quantity of concrete.<ref name=Develop/> This design was applied with some modifications for the Salmon Creek Dam, which was designed with constant opening angle of 113\u00b0 with radius varying from {{Convert|147.5|ft|m|sp=us}} at the base to {{Convert|331|ft|m|sp=us}} at the crest.<ref name=Develop/>\n[[File:Salmon Creek Dam Spillway pipe of 4 ft dia in full flow and an adventurous Climb down the dam slope.jpg|left|thumb|The spillway pipe has a diameter of {{convert|4|ft|m}}.

The aggregates were mixed in designed proportions with cement and with a small admixture of lime to manufacture concrete for placing on the dam. The first batch of [[concrete]] was placed on the dam on July 14, 1913. The dam was completed, over a 13 months period, on August 13, 1914. A concrete quantity of {{convert|54000|cuyd|m3}} was placed on the dam. Concrete was placed at the rate of {{convert|400|cuyd|m3}} per day.<ref name=History/><ref name=magazine/>\n\nBetween 1912 and 1914, two power stations were built to utilize the water stored in the reservoir created by the dam. The first power station, the upper powerhouse titled 'Powerhouse 2', was located {{convert|1|mi|km}} below the dam and had an installation of two units of 1.5 MW capacity each operating under a [[hydraulic head]] of {{Convert|600|ft|m}}. The tail waters from this power station was conveyed through a {{Convert|10000|ft|m}} long power channel to the second power station titled 'Powerhouse 1' located on the shore of the Gastineau Channel. The power house at this location also had two units of 1.5 MW capacity each operating under a head of {{Convert|500|ft|m}}. Thus, the total generation from the two power stations was {{convert|6000|kW|hp|abbr=on}}. In 1916, the average load on the two power stations was {{convert|5187|hp|kW}}. Near Powerhouse 1 on the shore, office buildings, machine shops, saw mills, canteen and housing facilities for staff were also built.<ref name=History/><ref name=Mines/>\n\n==Rehabilitation==\nSince its completion, the dam and its two power stations have gone through many rehabilitation measures. Power House 2 was damaged in a fire in 1923. It was rehabilitated in 1935. It was finally abandoned in 1998.<ref name=History/><ref name=energy/>\n\nWith aging, the dam also needed to be rehabilitated and work was carried out in 1967. Deteriorated concrete was removed, the dam body was regrouted and the upstream face of the dam was provided with a layer of high strength concrete in the top {{convert|45|ft}}.<ref name=History/><ref name=energy/>\n\nThe lower power house also underwent major rehabilitation measures. It was shut down in December 1974 due to the high cost of operation and maintenance. In 1984 a new power plant was built adjoining the old powerhouse, with installation of 6.7 MW capacity.<ref name=History/><ref name=energy/>\n\n==Benefits==\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 = Salmon Creek Dam Top of the dam 6 ft walkway.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Salmon Creek Dam - Full Arch Ds view.jpg\n| width2 = 150\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left: Salmon Creek Dam in 2006 after rehabilitation; top of the dam {{convert|6.5|ft|m|abbr=on}} walkway.

The generating capacity of the power station is 29.5 GWh annually, which accounts for nearly 10% of Juneau's power demand. Alaska Electric Light and Power operates and maintains the system.<ref name=History/>\n\n===Drinking water supply===\nSalmon Creek reservoir is a secondary source of drinking water which is provided in conjunction with Alaska Electric Light and Power Company (AEL&P). Water is drawn from near the Salmon Creek power generation plant, which is located near sea level. Tail waters from the power station are then pumped to a water treatment plant for membrane filtration, chlorination, and pH and alkalinity adjustment with soda ash before the water is supplied to the distribution system. This system was commissioned by the City Borough of Juneau (CBJ) in 2015. The reservoir is also used as chlorine contact tanks, where [[chlorine]] is added for purification and given time to react with any [[pathogens]], before it is supplied to the city. However, this source is subject to seasonal high turbidity and also interruptions due to the annual maintenance of the generator units. This system is able to supply {{convert|2000000|USgal|m3}} of water. The water resources are generally pollution-free and quality is monitored and tested every month to check for drinking-water standards set by the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] and Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC).<ref name=water>{{Cite web|url=http://www.juneau.lib.ak.us/water/h2odistr.php\\|title= Water Utility|accessdate=2010-07-15|publisher=City Borough of Juneau Alaska capital City}}</ref><ref name=Environ>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/of/text/of95-0412.PDF|format=pdf|title= Overview of Environmental and Hydrogeologic Conditions near Juneau, Alaska|pages=12\u201313|accessdate=2010-07-15|publisher= U.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with the Federal Aviation Administration}}</ref>\n\n===Fisheries===\nIn 1880, the Salmon Creek was named by Richard Harris and Joe Juneau (during their first visit to the area for gold prospecting).
