He made his professional debut in January 2002, reaching the top ''[[makuuchi]]'' division in September 2004. He has been a runner-up in five tournaments, and has earned ten [[sansho (sumo)|special prizes]]. His highest rank has been ''[[sekiwake]]'', which he first reached in September 2008 and has held for five tournaments to date. Following a suspension in July 2010 he was demoted to the ''[[j\u016bry\u014d]]'' division, but upon his return to ''makuuchi'' in November 2010 he took part in a playoff for the championship. He has been runner-up in four other top division tournaments. He has four ''[[kinboshi]]'' or gold stars awarded for ''[[yokozuna]]'' upsets, three of them earned by defeating [[Harumafuji]] from 2013 to 2015. He wrestled for [[Tokitsukaze stable]]. He retired in 2020 and is now an [[toshiyori|elder]] of the [[Japan Sumo Association]] under the name of Izutsu Oyakata.\n\n==Early life and sumo background==\n\nToyonoshima is the oldest son of a [[tofu]] maker.  In his early years, he was an avid [[soccer]] player.  However, his destiny changed after winning an area boys' sumo tournament championship. In junior high and high school, he was rivals with another future sumo wrestler who would go on to take the [[shikona|fighting name]] [[Kotosh\u014dgiku Kazuhiro|Kotosh\u014dgiku]].  Kotosh\u014dgiku is now a rival of his in professional sumo as well. After graduating from high school, Toyonoshima joined [[Tokitsukaze stable]] through a connection a friend of his father's had with the stable. He was below the minimum height requirement of 173&nbsp;cm but was allowed to make his debut after passing a secondary physical exam.\n\n==Career==\n===Early career and rise to sekiwake===\nOn entering the sumo world, Toyonoshima rose quickly through the lower ranks of sumo, winning two championships or ''[[y\u016bsh\u014d]]'' in the ''[[jonokuchi]]'' and ''[[jonidan]]'' divisions with perfect 7\u20130 records. He reached [[sekitori]] status in March 2004 after a 5\u20132 result at the rank of ''[[makushita]]'' 2. He moved through the ''[[j\u016bry\u014d]]'' in just two tournaments with consecutive 11\u20134 records. Upon reaching the top ''[[makuuchi]]'' division he initially had little success and was demoted back to ''j\u016bry\u014d'' twice. However, after winning the ''j\u016bry\u014d'' championship in September 2005 with a strong 14\u20131 record, his fortunes began to turn and after some initial struggles, he rose steadily through the ranks of ''makuuchi''.\n\nIn May 2006 Toyonoshima recorded only his second ''[[kachi-koshi]]'' or winning score in the top division, in his ninth tournament there. His first big success came in January 2007 when ranked at ''[[maegashira]]'' 9 he finished as runner up to ''[[Yokozuna (sumo)|yokozuna]]'' [[Asash\u014dry\u016b Akinori|Asash\u014dry\u016b]] with an outstanding 12\u20133 record and earned his first [[sansh\u014d (Sumo)|special prizes]] for Fighting Spirit and Technique. In March he defeated two ''[[\u014dzeki]]'', [[Koto\u014dsh\u016b Katsunori|Koto\u014dsh\u016b]] and [[Chiyotaikai Ry\u016bji|Chiyotaikai]], and earned promotion to ''komusubi'' for May. At just 168&nbsp;cm, or {{convert|5|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}} tall, he was the shortest wrestler to make ''komusubi'' in fifty years.<ref>{{cite web | author=Hardy, James| title=Summer Grand Sumo Tournament Preview | publisher=Daily Yomiuri Online| url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/sports/20070513TDY26001.htm | date=2007-05-13 | accessdate=2007-06-09 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070520211054/http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/sports/20070513TDY26001.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-05-20}}</ref> However, before the tournament began he sprained his knee and ankle ligaments in a practice session with Asash\u014dry\u016b at his [[heya (sumo)|heya]]<ref>{{cite web | title=New komusubi Toyonoshima to take part in tourney | publisher=[[Japan Today]] | url=http://www.japantoday.com/jp/news/406333 | date=2007-05-10 | accessdate=2007-06-09 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013153843/http://www.japantoday.com/jp/news/406333 | archivedate=2007-10-13 }}</ref> and could only manage four wins in his ''[[san'yaku]]'' (titled rank) debut.\n\n[[File:Toyonoshima hakuho.JPG|thumb|left|A bout between Toyonoshima and [[Hakuh\u014d Sh\u014d|Hakuh\u014d]], 2007]]\nIn September 2007 Toyonoshima became the first ''[[maegashira]]'' to defeat [[Hakuh\u014d Sh\u014d|Hakuh\u014d]] since his promotion to ''yokozuna'', earning his first ''[[kinboshi]]''. He also defeated ''\u014dzeki'' Koto\u014dsh\u016b and [[Kotomitsuki Keiji|Kotomitsuki]]. He finished with an 8\u20137 score and was awarded the Outstanding Performance prize. He achieved another winning record in the next tournament but faltered slightly with two 6\u20139 scores in January and March 2008. In May, however, he was on the leaderboard for much of the tournament and finished with joint runner-up honours and a share of the Fighting Spirit prize. He was one of seven wrestlers who [[NHK]] commentator Shuhei Nagao (the former [[Mainoumi]]) in 2008 called the \"[[Seven Samurai]]\" and identified as \"holding the key\" to a Japanese resurgence in sumo, which was dominated by foreigners in the top ranks.<ref>{{cite web|author=Alexander Hermann|title=Ones to Watch-Haru 2008|publisher=Sumo Fan Magazine|url=http://www.sumofanmag.com/content/Issue_17/Ones_to_Watch.pdf|date=February 2008|accessdate=2008-04-14}}</ref> (The others were [[G\u014deid\u014d]], [[Kisenosato]], [[Kotoshogiku]], [[Homasho]], [[Toyohibiki]] and [[Tochiozan]]).\n\n[[File:Sumo May09 Toyonoshima.jpg|thumb|right|Toyonoshima in May 2009, wearing a support for his left elbow after being injured in January.]]\nToyonoshima returned to the ''san'yaku'' ranks at ''komusubi'' for the July 2008 tournament, where he defeated Asash\u014dry\u016b for the first time on the opening day. He finished with ten wins and another Outstanding Performance prize, and Kotoshogiku's losing record meant Toyonoshima was promoted to ''[[sekiwake]]'' for the September tournament, becoming the first wrestler from Tokitsukaze stable to reach the rank since [[Kurama Tatsuya|Kurama]] in 1978. He fell short with a 6\u20139 score and was demoted to ''maegashira'' 1, but returned to ''komusubi'' for the January 2009 tournament.\n\nOn the 7th day of the January 2009 tournament, Toyonoshima fell victim to ''[[\u014dzeki]]'' [[Kai\u014d Hiroyuki|Kai\u014d]]'s \"kotenage\" armbar throw.  Toyonoshima appeared to suffer a severely hyper-extended elbow during the throw.  Despite being doubled over in pain, Toyonoshima managed to bow to the \u014dzeki and left the ''[[dohy\u014d]]'' unassisted, until he was safely back in the dressing area, where medical attention appeared to be prompt.  [[NHK]] English-language announcers later reported that Toyonoshima said he heard the elbow snap.  The online-edition of the [[Yomiuri Shimbun]] reported that Toyonoshima was diagnosed with left-elbow sprain\" and he was forced to forfeit the next day's scheduled bout against [[Kotosh\u014dgiku]].<ref>url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/sports/20090118TDY24305.htm</ref> Later news reports indicated that the [[Japan Sumo Association]] doctors told the 25-year-old ''[[rikishi]]'' to take a 6-week medical leave,<ref>url=http://www.47news.jp/CN/200901/CN2009011801000078.html</ref> and that Toyonoshima would bow out of the remainder of the 2009 Hatsu basho at the [[Ry\u014dgoku Kokugikan]] in [[Tokyo]]. This is the first occasion since his debut that he has missed any tournament bouts.\n\nToyonoshima returned to action in the March tournament in [[Osaka]] with his elbow strapped, but secured a winning record of 8\u20137 on the final day. In May, ranked at ''maegashira'' 3, he could manage only two wins in the first twelve days before winning his last three bouts. He produced his best performance of the year in November, a promising 11\u20134 score which won him his second Technique prize and opened up the possibility of promotion back to ''san'yaku'' in January 2010. However, due to [[Chiyotaikai Ry\u016bji|Chiyotaikai]]'s demotion to ''sekiwake'' and [[Kakury\u016b Rikisabur\u014d|Kakury\u016b]] finishing 7\u20138, he had to settle for the ''maegashira'' 1 east position. He recovered from 3\u20136 down in the January tournament to post his majority of wins, and this returned him to the ''san'yaku'' ranks for the first time in seven tournaments, at ''sekiwake''. He began brightly in the March tournament, opening with three consecutive wins, but he then faded and finished with just six wins against nine losses.\n\n===Tournament playoff===\nHe was suspended along with over a dozen other wrestlers from the July 2010 tournament after admitting involvement in illegal betting on baseball. As a result, he was demoted to the ''j\u016bry\u014d'' division for the following September.  He bounced back from this penalty with an impressive 14\u20131 record and took his second ''j\u016bry\u014d'' championship, exactly five years after his first, guaranteeing himself promotion back into the top division. Fighting from ''maegashira'' 9 in November, he produced another 14\u20131 score, losing only to [[Kyokutenh\u014d Masaru|Kyokutenh\u014d]] and defeating two ''\u014dzeki''. He lost to [[Hakuh\u014d Sh\u014d|Hakuh\u014d]] in a playoff for the ''y\u016bsh\u014d'' on the final day, narrowly failing to become the first wrestler ever to win back-to-back ''j\u016bry\u014d'' and ''makuuchi'' championships (and the first Japanese-born winner of a top division tournament since 2006), but he received special prizes for Fighting Spirit and Technique. He was promoted to ''maegashira'' 1 East for the following tournament in January, the first time that a ''maegashira'' has won fourteen bouts and not been promoted to a ''san'yaku'' rank. He made a poor start to the January ''honbasho'', losing seven of his first eight matches, but he recovered to earn his 8\u20137 majority of wins on the final day. This returned him to ''san'yaku'' for the (subsequently cancelled) March tournament. In the May 'technical examination' tournament he had an even worse start, losing nine of his first ten bouts and finishing on 5\u201310.\n\nHe returned to ''komusubi'' in September 2011 and recovered from a 1\u20137 start for the second time in his career to keep his rank with an 8\u20137 score. He rose to ''sekiwake'' in January 2012 but lost his rank after only scoring 5\u201310. He had a fine tournament in March, beating the ''\u014dzeki'' Kotosh\u014dgiku and Koto\u014dsh\u016b and sharing the Technique prize, which returned him immediately to ''sekiwake''. In the May 2012 basho he defeated Hakuh\u014d for just the second time in the top division, sending the ''yokozuna'' crashing to his fourth loss of the tournament.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hakuho defeated again; Kisenosato shares lead|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/ss20120515b1.html|publisher=Jaan Times|accessdate=16 May 2012|date=15 May 2012}}</ref>  In this period he managed to achieve enough winning tournaments to stay in the higher ranks of ''makuuchi'', and also earned two [[kinboshi|gold star]] wins against ''yokozuna'' [[Harumafuji]], which were ironically both losing tournaments for Toyonoshima.\n\n===Later career and fall to makushita===\nToyonoshima maintained his position in the upper ''maegashira'' ranks in 2015, earning a fourth ''kinboshi'' in March when he again defeated Harumafuji. In January 2016 he produced his best performance for several years when his 12\u20133 record included a win over the eventual winner [[Kotosh\u014dgiku]] and saw him tying for second place and being awarded the prize for Outstanding Performance. This was his tenth special prize, putting him level with Harumafuji and behind only [[G\u014deid\u014d G\u014dtar\u014d|G\u014deid\u014d]] and [[Aminishiki]] amongst active wrestlers. His performance saw him being promoted to ''sekiwake'' for the fifth time, and for the first time since May 2012. His next two tournaments were disappointing: he lost his ''sekiwake'' rank after recording only three wins in March and then posted a 5\u201310 record in May. He missed the July 2016 tournament after undergoing surgery for a left [[Achilles tendon]] rupture which occurred in training and as a result was demoted to ''j\u016bry\u014d'' for the first time since 2010. He decided to skip the September tournament as well to allow his injury to fully heal, which meant a demotion to the ''makushita'' division. He is only the second wrestler to have fallen to ''makushita'' having previously taken part in a ''makuuchi'' division playoff, after [[Hokutoriki]]. He considered retiring at this point, but was persuaded to carry on by his young daughter.\n[[File:\u8c4a\u30ce\u5cf6\u95a2.jpg|thumb|left|Toyonoshima in 2017]]\nToyonoshima managed only a bare majority of four wins against three losses on his comeback in November 2016 but recorded six wins in January 2017.

His two most common winning ''[[kimarite]]'' were ''yori-kiri'', the force out, and ''oshi-dashi'', the push out.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toyonoshima bouts by kimarite|publisher=Sumo

Kajiwara''') is a former professional [[sumo]] wrestler from [[Sukumo, K\u014dchi]], [[Japan]]. He made his professional debut in January 2002, reaching the top ''[[makuuchi]]'' division in September 2004. He has been a runner-up in five tournaments, and has earned ten [[sansho (sumo)|special prizes]]. His highest rank has been ''[[sekiwake]]'', which he first reached in September 2008 and has held for five tournaments to date. Following a suspension in July 2010 he was demoted to the ''[[j\u016bry\u014d]]'' division, but upon his return to ''makuuchi'' in November 2010 he took part in a playoff for the championship. He has been runner-up in four other top division tournaments. He has four ''[[kinboshi]]'' or gold stars awarded for ''[[yokozuna]]'' upsets, three of them earned by defeating [[Harumafuji]] from 2013 to 2015. He wrestled for [[Tokitsukaze stable]]. He retired in 2020 and is now an [[toshiyori|elder]] of the [[Japan Sumo Association]] under the name of Izutsu Oyakata.\n\n==Early life and sumo background==\n\nToyonoshima is the oldest son of a [[tofu]] maker.  In his early years, he was an avid [[soccer]] player.  However, his destiny changed after winning an area boys' sumo tournament championship. In junior high and high school, he was rivals with another future sumo wrestler who would go on to take the [[shikona|fighting name]] [[Kotosh\u014dgiku Kazuhiro|Kotosh\u014dgiku]].  Kotosh\u014dgiku is now a rival of his in professional sumo as well. After graduating from high school, Toyonoshima joined [[Tokitsukaze stable]] through a connection a friend of his father's had with the stable. He was below the minimum height requirement of 173&nbsp;cm but was allowed to make his debut after passing a secondary physical exam.\n\n==Career==\n===Early career and rise to sekiwake===\nOn entering the sumo world, Toyonoshima rose quickly through the lower ranks of sumo, winning two championships or ''[[y\u016bsh\u014d]]'' in the ''[[jonokuchi]]'' and ''[[jonidan]]'' divisions with perfect 7\u20130 records. He reached [[sekitori]] status in March 2004 after a 5\u20132 result at the rank of ''[[makushita]]'' 2. He moved through the ''[[j\u016bry\u014d]]'' in just two tournaments with consecutive 11\u20134 records. Upon reaching the top ''[[makuuchi]]'' division he initially had little success and was demoted back to ''j\u016bry\u014d'' twice. However, after winning the ''j\u016bry\u014d'' championship in September 2005 with a strong 14\u20131 record, his fortunes began to turn and after some initial struggles, he rose steadily through the ranks of ''makuuchi''.\n\nIn May 2006 Toyonoshima recorded only his second ''[[kachi-koshi]]'' or winning score in the top division, in his ninth tournament there. His first big success came in January 2007 when ranked at ''[[maegashira]]'' 9 he finished as runner up to ''[[Yokozuna (sumo)|yokozuna]]'' [[Asash\u014dry\u016b Akinori|Asash\u014dry\u016b]] with an outstanding 12\u20133 record and earned his first [[sansh\u014d (Sumo)|special prizes]] for Fighting Spirit and Technique. In March he defeated two ''[[\u014dzeki]]'', [[Koto\u014dsh\u016b Katsunori|Koto\u014dsh\u016b]] and [[Chiyotaikai Ry\u016bji|Chiyotaikai]], and earned promotion to ''komusubi'' for May. At just 168&nbsp;cm, or {{convert|5|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}} tall, he was the shortest wrestler to make ''komusubi'' in fifty years.<ref>{{cite web | author=Hardy, James| title=Summer Grand Sumo Tournament Preview | publisher=Daily Yomiuri Online| url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/sports/20070513TDY26001.htm | date=2007-05-13 | accessdate=2007-06-09 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070520211054/http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/sports/20070513TDY26001.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-05-20}}</ref> However, before the tournament began he sprained his knee and ankle ligaments in a practice session with Asash\u014dry\u016b at his [[heya (sumo)|heya]]<ref>{{cite web | title=New komusubi Toyonoshima to take part in tourney | publisher=[[Japan Today]] | url=http://www.japantoday.com/jp/news/406333 | date=2007-05-10 | accessdate=2007-06-09 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013153843/http://www.japantoday.com/jp/news/406333 | archivedate=2007-10-13 }}</ref> and could only manage four wins in his ''[[san'yaku]]'' (titled rank) debut.\n\n[[File:Toyonoshima hakuho.JPG|thumb|left|A bout between Toyonoshima and [[Hakuh\u014d Sh\u014d|Hakuh\u014d]], 2007]]\nIn September 2007 Toyonoshima became the first ''[[maegashira]]'' to defeat [[Hakuh\u014d Sh\u014d|Hakuh\u014d]] since his promotion to ''yokozuna'', earning his first ''[[kinboshi]]''. He also defeated ''\u014dzeki'' Koto\u014dsh\u016b and [[Kotomitsuki Keiji|Kotomitsuki]]. He finished with an 8\u20137 score and was awarded the Outstanding Performance prize. He achieved another winning record in the next tournament but faltered slightly with two 6\u20139 scores in January and March 2008. In May, however, he was on the leaderboard for much of the tournament and finished with joint runner-up honours and a share of the Fighting Spirit prize. He was one of seven wrestlers who [[NHK]] commentator Shuhei Nagao (the former [[Mainoumi]]) in 2008 called the \"[[Seven Samurai]]\" and identified as \"holding the key\" to a Japanese resurgence in sumo, which was dominated by foreigners in the top ranks.<ref>{{cite web|author=Alexander Hermann|title=Ones to Watch-Haru 2008|publisher=Sumo Fan Magazine|url=http://www.sumofanmag.com/content/Issue_17/Ones_to_Watch.pdf|date=February 2008|accessdate=2008-04-14}}</ref> (The others were [[G\u014deid\u014d]], [[Kisenosato]], [[Kotoshogiku]], [[Homasho]], [[Toyohibiki]] and [[Tochiozan]]).\n\n[[File:Sumo May09 Toyonoshima.jpg|thumb|right|Toyonoshima in May 2009, wearing a support for his left elbow after being injured in January.]]\nToyonoshima returned to the ''san'yaku'' ranks at ''komusubi'' for the July 2008 tournament, where he defeated Asash\u014dry\u016b for the first time on the opening day. He finished with ten wins and another Outstanding Performance prize, and Kotoshogiku's losing record meant Toyonoshima was promoted to ''[[sekiwake]]'' for the September tournament, becoming the first wrestler from Tokitsukaze stable to reach the rank since [[Kurama Tatsuya|Kurama]] in 1978. He fell short with a 6\u20139 score and was demoted to ''maegashira'' 1, but returned to ''komusubi'' for the January 2009 tournament.\n\nOn the 7th day of the January 2009 tournament, Toyonoshima fell victim to ''[[\u014dzeki]]'' [[Kai\u014d Hiroyuki|Kai\u014d]]'s \"kotenage\" armbar throw.  Toyonoshima appeared to suffer a severely hyper-extended elbow during the throw.  Despite being doubled over in pain, Toyonoshima managed to bow to the \u014dzeki and left the ''[[dohy\u014d]]'' unassisted, until he was safely back in the dressing area, where medical attention appeared to be prompt.  [[NHK]] English-language announcers later reported that Toyonoshima said he heard the elbow snap.  The online-edition of the [[Yomiuri Shimbun]] reported that Toyonoshima was diagnosed with left-elbow sprain\" and he was forced to forfeit the next day's scheduled bout against [[Kotosh\u014dgiku]].<ref>url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/sports/20090118TDY24305.htm</ref> Later news reports indicated that the [[Japan Sumo Association]] doctors told the 25-year-old ''[[rikishi]]'' to take a 6-week medical leave,<ref>url=http://www.47news.jp/CN/200901/CN2009011801000078.html</ref> and that Toyonoshima would bow out of the remainder of the 2009 Hatsu basho at the [[Ry\u014dgoku Kokugikan]] in [[Tokyo]]. This is the first occasion since his debut that he has missed any tournament bouts.\n\nToyonoshima returned to action in the March tournament in [[Osaka]] with his elbow strapped, but secured a winning record of 8\u20137 on the final day. In May, ranked at ''maegashira'' 3, he could manage only two wins in the first twelve days before winning his last three bouts. He produced his best performance of the year in November, a promising 11\u20134 score which won him his second Technique prize and opened up the possibility of promotion back to ''san'yaku'' in January 2010. However, due to [[Chiyotaikai Ry\u016bji|Chiyotaikai]]'s demotion to ''sekiwake'' and [[Kakury\u016b Rikisabur\u014d|Kakury\u016b]] finishing 7\u20138, he had to settle for the ''maegashira'' 1 east position. He recovered from 3\u20136 down in the January tournament to post his majority of wins, and this returned him to the ''san'yaku'' ranks for the first time in seven tournaments, at ''sekiwake''. He began brightly in the March tournament, opening with three consecutive wins, but he then faded and finished with just six wins against nine losses.\n\n===Tournament playoff===\nHe was suspended along with over a dozen other wrestlers from the July 2010 tournament after admitting involvement in illegal betting on baseball. As a result, he was demoted to the ''j\u016bry\u014d'' division for the following September.  He bounced back from this penalty with an impressive 14\u20131 record and took his second ''j\u016bry\u014d'' championship, exactly five years after his first, guaranteeing himself promotion back into the top division. Fighting from ''maegashira'' 9 in November, he produced another 14\u20131 score, losing only to [[Kyokutenh\u014d Masaru|Kyokutenh\u014d]] and defeating two ''\u014dzeki''. He lost to [[Hakuh\u014d Sh\u014d|Hakuh\u014d]] in a playoff for the ''y\u016bsh\u014d'' on the final day, narrowly failing to become the first wrestler ever to win back-to-back ''j\u016bry\u014d'' and ''makuuchi'' championships (and the first Japanese-born winner of a top division tournament since 2006), but he received special prizes for Fighting Spirit and Technique. He was promoted to ''maegashira'' 1 East for the following tournament in January, the first time that a ''maegashira'' has won fourteen bouts and not been promoted to a ''san'yaku'' rank. He made a poor start to the January ''honbasho'', losing seven of his first eight matches, but he recovered to earn his 8\u20137 majority of wins on the final day. This returned him to ''san'yaku'' for the (subsequently cancelled) March tournament. In the May 'technical examination' tournament he had an even worse start, losing nine of his first ten bouts and finishing on 5\u201310.\n\nHe returned to ''komusubi'' in September 2011 and recovered from a 1\u20137 start for the second time in his career to keep his rank with an 8\u20137 score. He rose to ''sekiwake'' in January 2012 but lost his rank after only scoring 5\u201310. He had a fine tournament in March, beating the ''\u014dzeki'' Kotosh\u014dgiku and Koto\u014dsh\u016b and sharing the Technique prize, which returned him immediately to ''sekiwake''. In the May 2012 basho he defeated Hakuh\u014d for just the second time in the top division, sending the ''yokozuna'' crashing to his fourth loss of the tournament.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hakuho defeated again; Kisenosato shares lead|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/ss20120515b1.html|publisher=Jaan Times|accessdate=16 May 2012|date=15 May 2012}}</ref>  In this period he managed to achieve enough winning tournaments to stay in the higher ranks of ''makuuchi'', and also earned two [[kinboshi|gold star]] wins against ''yokozuna'' [[Harumafuji]], which were ironically both losing tournaments for Toyonoshima.\n\n===Later career and fall to makushita===\nToyonoshima maintained his position in the upper ''maegashira'' ranks in 2015, earning a fourth ''kinboshi'' in March when he again defeated Harumafuji. In January 2016 he produced his best performance for several years when his 12\u20133 record included a win over the eventual winner [[Kotosh\u014dgiku]] and saw him tying for second place and being awarded the prize for Outstanding Performance. This was his tenth special prize, putting him level with Harumafuji and behind only [[G\u014deid\u014d G\u014dtar\u014d|G\u014deid\u014d]] and [[Aminishiki]] amongst active wrestlers. His performance saw him being promoted to ''sekiwake'' for the fifth time, and for the first time since May 2012. His next two tournaments were disappointing: he lost his ''sekiwake'' rank after recording only three wins in March and then posted a 5\u201310 record in May. He missed the July 2016 tournament after undergoing surgery for a left [[Achilles tendon]] rupture which occurred in training and as a result was demoted to ''j\u016bry\u014d'' for the first time since 2010. He decided to skip the September tournament as well to allow his injury to fully heal, which meant a demotion to the ''makushita'' division. He is only the second wrestler to have fallen to ''makushita'' having previously taken part in a ''makuuchi'' division playoff, after [[Hokutoriki]]. He considered retiring at this point, but was persuaded to carry on by his young daughter.\n[[File:\u8c4a\u30ce\u5cf6\u95a2.jpg|thumb|left|Toyonoshima in 2017]]\nToyonoshima managed only a bare majority of four wins against three losses on his comeback in November 2016 but recorded six wins in January 2017.

He won promotion back to the ''j\u016bry\u014d'' division after a 6\u20131 record at ''makushita'' 1 in September 2018, after an absence of 13 tournaments. He is the sixth oldest wrestler post-World War II to return to ''j\u016bry\u014d'' at 35 years and four months.<ref>{{cite web|title=2018 November Grand Sumo Tournament Banzuke Topics|url=http://www.sumo.or.jp/EnHonbashoTopics/banzuke_topics/|publisher=Japan Sumo Association|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181105202313/http://www.sumo.or.jp/EnHonbashoTopics/banzuke_topics/|archivedate=5 November 2018}}</ref> In March 2019 he was promoted back to ''makuuchi''.

His career record was 703 wins over 641 losses over 109 career tournaments, and his top division record was 493 wins against 524 losses over 71 tournaments. He assumed the [[toshiyori|elder name]] of Izutsu, previously held by the late [[Sakahoko Nobushige|Sakahoko]], and will work as a coach in the [[Japan Sumo Association]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sankei.com/sports/news/200417/spo2004170020-n1.html|title=\u5143\u95a2\u8107\u8c4a\u30ce\u5cf6\u304c\u5f15\u9000\u3000\u5e74\u5bc4\u300c\u4e95\u7b52\u300d\u8972\u540d|date=17 April 2020|work=Sankei|language=Japanese|accessdate=17 April 2020}}</ref> He had reportedly been making payments towards the Nishikijima name previously intended for his ex-stablemate [[Shimotori Norio|Shimotori]] before he was forced to quit sumo, but he was ultimately unable to acquire it, and the stock went to [[Asasekiryu]] instead.\n\n==Fighting style==\nToyonoshima was equally adept at grappling techniques, or ''yotsu-sumo'', and pushing/thrusting techniques, ''oshi-sumo''. His two most common winning ''[[kimarite]]'' were ''yori-kiri'', the force out, and ''oshi-dashi'', the push out.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toyonoshima bouts by kimarite|publisher=Sumo Reference|url=http://sumodb.sumogames.de/Rikishi_kim.aspx?r=1227|accessdate=2 June 2009}}</ref> His favourite grip on his opponent's ''[[mawashi]]'' was ''hidari-yotsu'', a right hand outside, left hand inside grip, from which position he also regularly employed ''shitate-nage'', or the inner arm throw.\n\n==Personal life==\nToyonoshima was married to pop singer [[Sunaho Takeuchi]] in February 2011 and the wedding reception was held that October in Tokyo's Metropolitan Hotel with around 600 guests attending.\n\n==Career record==\n{{Sumo record box start|Toyonoshima Daiki<ref>{{cite web |
