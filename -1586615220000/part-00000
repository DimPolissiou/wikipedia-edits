The craft was launched from [[Kennedy Space Center]] on April 11, 1970, but the lunar landing was aborted after an oxygen tank in the [[Apollo command and service module#Service module (SM)|service module]] (SM) failed two days into the mission. The crew instead looped around the Moon, and returned safely to Earth on April 17. The mission was commanded by [[Jim Lovell]] with [[Jack Swigert]] as [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module]] (CM) pilot and [[Fred Haise]] as [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]] (LM) pilot. Swigert was a late replacement for [[Ken Mattingly]], who was grounded after exposure to [[rubella]].\n\nA routine stir of an oxygen tank ignited damaged wire insulation inside it, causing an explosion that vented the contents of both of the SM's oxygen tanks to space. Without oxygen, needed for breathing and for generating electric power, the SM's propulsion and life support systems could not operate. The CM's systems had to be shut down to conserve its remaining resources for reentry, forcing the crew to transfer to the LM as a lifeboat. With the lunar landing canceled, mission controllers worked to bring the crew home alive.\n\nAlthough the LM was designed to support two men on the lunar surface for two days, [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]] in Houston improvised new procedures so it could support three men for four days. The crew experienced great hardship caused by limited power, a chilly and wet cabin and a shortage of [[potable water]]. There was a critical need to adapt the CM's cartridges for the [[carbon dioxide]] removal system to work in the LM; the crew and mission controllers were successful in improvising a solution. The astronauts' peril briefly renewed interest in the Apollo program; tens of millions watched the splashdown in the [[South Pacific Ocean]] on television.\n\nAn investigative review board found fault with preflight testing of the oxygen tank and the fact that [[Teflon]] was placed inside it. The board recommended changes, including minimizing the use of potentially combustible items inside the tank; this was done for [[Apollo 14]]. The story of Apollo&nbsp;13 has been dramatized several times, most notably in the 1995 film ''[[Apollo&nbsp;13 (film)|Apollo&nbsp;13]]''.\n\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1961, U.S. President [[John F.

A \"direct abort\" would use the SM's main engine (the [[Service Propulsion System]] or SPS) to return before reaching the Moon. But the accident could have damaged the SPS, and the fuel cells would have to last at least another hour to meet its power requirements, so Kranz instead decided on a longer route: the spacecraft would swing around the Moon before heading back to Earth. Apollo&nbsp;13 was on the hybrid trajectory which was to take it to Fra Mauro; it now needed to be brought back to a free return. The LM's [[Descent Propulsion System]] (DPS), although not as powerful as the SPS, could do this, but new software for Mission Control's computers needed to be written by technicians as it had never been contemplated that the CSM/LM spacecraft would have to be maneuvered by the DPS. As the CM was being shut down, Lovell copied down its guidance system's orientation information and performed hand calculations to transfer it to the LM's guidance system, which had been turned off; at his request Mission Control checked his figures.<ref name = \"Cass 2\">{{cite web|last=Cass|first=Stephen|title=Houston, we have a solution, part 2|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/space-age/apollo-13-we-have-a-solution-part-2|date=April 1, 2005|website=IEEE|accessdate=August 31, 2019}}</ref>{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|pp=297\u2013298}} At 61:29:43.49 the DPS burn of 34.23&nbsp;seconds took Apollo&nbsp;13 back to a free return trajectory.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|p=369}}\n\n[[File:Mare Moscoviense AS13-60-8648.jpg|thumb|The Apollo&nbsp;13 crew photographed the Moon out of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]].]]\nThe change would get Apollo&nbsp;13 back to Earth in about four days' time{{snd}}though with splashdown in the [[Indian Ocean]], where NASA had few recovery forces. Jerry Bostick and other [[Flight controller#FDO|Flight Dynamics Officers]] (FIDOs) were anxious both to shorten the travel time and to move splashdown to the [[Pacific Ocean]], where the main recovery forces were located. One option would shave 36 hours off the return time, but required jettisoning the SM; this would expose the CM's heat shield to space during the return journey, something for which it had not been designed. The FIDOs also proposed other solutions. After a meeting involving NASA officials and engineers, the senior individual present, [[Manned Spaceflight Center]] director [[Robert R.

The craft was launched from [[Kennedy Space Center]] on April 11, 1970, but the lunar landing was aborted after an oxygen tank in the [[Apollo command and service module#Service module (SM)|service module]] (SM) failed two days into the mission. The crew instead looped around the Moon, and returned safely to Earth on April 17. The mission was commanded by [[Jim Lovell]] with [[Jack Swigert]] as [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module]] (CM) pilot and [[Fred Haise]] as [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]] (LM) pilot. Swigert was a late replacement for [[Ken Mattingly]], who was grounded after exposure to [[rubella]].\n\nA routine stir of an oxygen tank ignited damaged wire insulation inside it, causing an explosion that vented the contents of both of the SM's oxygen tanks to space. Without oxygen, needed for breathing and for generating electric power, the SM's propulsion and life support systems could not operate. The CM's systems had to be shut down to conserve its remaining resources for reentry, forcing the crew to transfer to the LM as a lifeboat. With the lunar landing canceled, mission controllers worked to bring the crew home alive.\n\nAlthough the LM was designed to support two men on the lunar surface for two days, [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]] in Houston improvised new procedures so it could support three men for four days. The crew experienced great hardship caused by limited power, a chilly and wet cabin and a shortage of [[potable water]]. There was a critical need to adapt the CM's cartridges for the [[carbon dioxide]] removal system to work in the LM; the crew and mission controllers were successful in improvising a solution. The astronauts' peril briefly renewed interest in the Apollo program; tens of millions watched the splashdown in the [[South Pacific Ocean]] on television.\n\nAn investigative review board found fault with preflight testing of the oxygen tank and the fact that [[Teflon]] was placed inside it. The board recommended changes, including minimizing the use of potentially combustible items inside the tank; this was done for [[Apollo 14]]. The story of Apollo&nbsp;13 has been dramatized several times, most notably in the 1995 film ''[[Apollo&nbsp;13 (film)|Apollo&nbsp;13]]''.\n\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1961, U.S. President [[John F.

Each member of the prime crew spent over 400 hours in simulators of the CM and (for Lovell and Haise) of the LM at KSC and at Houston, some of which involved the flight controllers at Mission Control.{{sfn|Apollo 13 Press Kit|1970|p=104}} Flight controllers participated in many simulations of problems with the spacecraft in flight, which taught them how to react in an emergency.<ref name = \"Cass 1\" />  Specialized simulators at other locations were also used by the crew members.{{sfn|Apollo 13 Press Kit|1970|p=104}}\n\nThe astronauts of Apollo 11 had minimal time for geology training, with only six months between crew assignment and launch; higher priorities took much of their time.{{sfn|Phinney|2015|p=100}} Apollo 12 saw more such training, including practice in the field, using a CAPCOM and a simulated backroom of scientists, to whom the astronauts had to describe what they saw.{{sfn|Phinney|2015|pp=103\u2013104}} Scientist-astronaut [[Harrison Schmitt]] saw that there was limited enthusiasm for geology field trips. Believing an inspirational teacher was needed, Schmitt arranged for Lovell and Haise to meet his old professor, [[Caltech]]'s [[Leon Silver|Lee Silver]]. The two astronauts, and backups Young and Duke, went on a field trip with Silver at their own time and expense. At the end of their week together, Lovell made Silver their geology mentor, who would be extensively involved in the geology planning for Apollo&nbsp;13.{{sfn|Phinney|2015|pp=107\u2013111}} [[Farouk El-Baz]] oversaw the training of Mattingly and his backup, Swigert, which involved describing and photographing simulated lunar landmarks from airplanes.{{sfn|Phinney|2015|p=134}} El-Baz had all three prime crew astronauts describe geologic features they saw during their flights between Houston and KSC; Mattingly's enthusiasm caused other astronauts, such as Apollo 14's CMP, Roosa, to seek out El-Baz as a teacher.{{sfn|Phinney|2015|pp=141\u2013142}}\n\nConcerned about how close Apollo 11's LM, ''Eagle'', had come to running out of propellant during its lunar descent, mission planners decided that beginning with Apollo&nbsp;13, the CSM would bring the LM to the low orbit from which the landing attempt would commence. This was a change from Apollo 11 and 12, on which the LM made the burn to bring it to the lower orbit. The change was part of an effort to increase the amount of hover time available to the astronauts as the missions headed into rougher terrain.{{sfn|Harland|1999|p=53}}\n\nThe plan was to devote the first of the two four-hour lunar surface [[extravehicular activity|extravehicular activities]] (EVAs) to setting up the [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package]] (ALSEP) group of scientific instruments; during the second, Lovell and Haise would investigate Cone crater, near the planned landing site.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|p=363}} The two astronauts wore their spacesuits for some 20 walk-throughs of EVA procedures, including sample gathering and use of tools and other equipment. They flew in the \"[[Vomit Comet]]\" in simulated microgravity or lunar gravity, including practice in donning and doffing spacesuits. To prepare for the descent to the Moon's surface, Lovell flew the [[Lunar Landing Training Vehicle]] (LLTV).{{sfn|Apollo 13 Press Kit|1970|p=105}} Despite the fact that four of the five LLTVs and similar Lunar Landing Research Vehicles crashed during the course of the Apollo program, mission commanders considered flying them invaluable experience.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Eric M.|title=Lunar Landing Training Vehicle NASA 952|date=April 29, 2006|accessdate=July 20, 2019|url=https://history.nasa.gov/alsj/LLTV-952.html|publisher=[[NASA]]|work=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal}}</ref>\n\n== Experiments and scientific objectives ==\n[[File:Lovell and Haise geology training (S70-20253).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Lovell (left) and Haise during geology training in Hawaii, January 1970]]\n\nApollo&nbsp;13's designated landing site was near [[Fra Mauro (crater)|Fra Mauro crater]]; the [[Fra Mauro formation]] was believed to contain much material spattered by the impact that had filled the [[Imbrium basin]] early in the Moon's history.

We've had a Main&nbsp;B Bus undervolt.\"<ref name = \"journal Houston\" />\n\nLovell's initial thought on hearing the noise was that Haise had activated the LM's cabin-repressurization valve, which also produced a bang (Haise enjoyed doing so to startle his crewmates) but Lovell could see that Haise had no idea what had happened. Swigert initially thought that a [[meteoroid]] might have struck the LM, but he and Lovell quickly realized there was no leak.{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|p=293}} The Main Bus&nbsp;B undervolt meant that there was insufficient voltage flowing from the SM's three power cells (fueled by hydrogen and oxygen piped from their respective tanks) to the second of the SM's two power distribution systems. Almost everything in the CSM required power. Although the bus momentarily returned to normal status, soon both buses A and B were short on voltage. Haise checked the status of the fuel cells, and found that two of them were dead. Mission rules forbade entering lunar orbit unless all fuel cells were operational.{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|pp=293\u2013294}}\n\nIn the minutes after the accident, there were several unusual readings, showing that tank{{nbsp}}2 was empty and tank{{nbsp}}1's pressure slowly falling, that the [[Apollo Guidance Computer|computer on the spacecraft]] had reset, and that the high-gain antenna was not working.

These would be needed for the final hours of the mission, but the remaining fuel cell, already starved for oxygen, was drawing from the surge tank.

A \"direct abort\" would use the SM's main engine (the [[Service Propulsion System]] or SPS) to return before reaching the Moon. But the accident could have damaged the SPS, and the fuel cells would have to last at least another hour to meet its power requirements, so Kranz instead decided on a longer route: the spacecraft would swing around the Moon before heading back to Earth. Apollo&nbsp;13 was on the hybrid trajectory which was to take it to Fra Mauro; it now needed to be brought back to a free return. The LM's [[Descent Propulsion System]] (DPS), although not as powerful as the SPS, could do this, but new software for Mission Control's computers needed to be written by technicians as it had never been contemplated that the CSM/LM spacecraft would have to be maneuvered by the DPS. As the CM was being shut down, Lovell copied down its guidance system's orientation information and performed hand calculations to transfer it to the LM's guidance system, which had been turned off; at his request Mission Control checked his figures.<ref name = \"Cass 2\">{{cite web|last=Cass|first=Stephen|title=Houston, we have a solution, part 2|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/space-age/apollo-13-we-have-a-solution-part-2|date=April 1, 2005|website=IEEE|accessdate=August 31, 2019}}</ref>{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|pp=297\u2013298}} At 61:29:43.49 the DPS burn of 34.23&nbsp;seconds took Apollo&nbsp;13 back to a free return trajectory.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|p=369}}\n\n[[File:Mare Moscoviense AS13-60-8648.jpg|thumb|The Apollo&nbsp;13 crew photographed the Moon out of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]].]]\nThe change would get Apollo&nbsp;13 back to Earth in about four days' time{{snd}}though with splashdown in the [[Indian Ocean]], where NASA had few recovery forces. Jerry Bostick and other [[Flight controller#FDO|Flight Dynamics Officers]] (FIDOs) were anxious both to shorten the travel time and to move splashdown to the [[Pacific Ocean]], where the main recovery forces were located. One option would shave 36 hours off the return time, but required jettisoning the SM; this would expose the CM's heat shield to space during the return journey, something for which it had not been designed. The FIDOs also proposed other solutions. After a meeting involving NASA officials and engineers, the senior individual present, [[Manned Spaceflight Center]] director [[Robert R. Gilruth]], decided on a burn using the DPS, that would save 12&nbsp;hours and land Apollo&nbsp;13 in the Pacific. This \"PC+2\" burn would take place two hours after [[pericynthion]], the closest approach to the Moon.<ref name = \"Cass 2\" />  At pericynthion, Apollo&nbsp;13 set the record (per the ''Guinness Book of World Records''), which still stands, for the highest absolute altitude attained by a crewed spacecraft: {{convert|400171|km|sp=us}} from Earth at 7:21&nbsp;pm EST, April 14 (00:21:00&nbsp;UTC April 15).{{sfn|Glenday|2010|p=13}}{{NoteTag|The record was set because  the Moon was nearly at [[apogee|its furthest from Earth]] during the mission.

The resulting fire quickly increased pressure inside the tank and the tank dome failed, filling the fuel cell bay (SM Sector{{nbsp}}4) with rapidly expanding gaseous oxygen and combustion products. The escaping gas was probably enough by itself to blow out the aluminum exterior panel to Sector{{nbsp}}4, but combustion products generated as nearby insulation ignited would have added to the pressure. The panel's departure exposed the sector to space, snuffing out the fire, and it probably hit the nearby high-gain antenna, disrupting communications to Earth for 1.8&nbsp;seconds.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|pp=372\u2013373}} The sectors of the SM were not airtight from each other, and had there been time for the entire SM to become as pressurized as Sector{{nbsp}}4, the force on the CM's heat shield would have separated the two modules.

Nonetheless, the switches Beech used were not rated for 65 volts.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|p=374}}\n\nAt NAR's facility, Oxygen Tank&nbsp;2 had been originally installed in an oxygen shelf placed in the [[Apollo 10]] service module, SM-106, but which was removed to fix a potential [[electromagnetic interference]] problem and another shelf substituted. During removal, the shelf was accidentally dropped at least {{convert|2|in|cm|0|order=flip|sp=us}} because a retaining bolt had not been removed. The probability of damage from this was low, but it is possible that the fill line assembly was loose and made worse by the fall. After some retesting (which did not include filling the tank with liquid oxygen), in November 1968 the shelf was re-installed in SM-109, intended for Apollo&nbsp;13, which was shipped to KSC in June 1969.{{sfn|Accident report|pp=4-19, 4-21}}\n\nThe [[Terminal countdown demonstration test|Countdown Demonstration Test]] took place with SM-109 in its place near the top of the Saturn&nbsp;V and began on March 16, 1970. During the test, the cryogenic tanks were filled, but Oxygen Tank&nbsp;2 could not be emptied through the normal drain line, and a report was written documenting the problem. After discussion among NASA and the contractors, attempts to empty the tank resumed on March 27. When it would not empty normally, the heaters in the tank were turned on to boil off the oxygen. The thermostatic switches were designed to prevent the heaters from raising the temperature higher than {{convert|80|F|C|order=flip}}, but they failed under the 65-volt power supply applied. Temperatures on the heater tube within the tank may have reached {{convert|1,000|F|C|order=flip|-1}}, most likely damaging the Teflon insulation.{{sfn|Accident report|p=4-23}} The temperature gauge was not designed to read higher than {{convert|85|F|C|order=flip}}, so the technician monitoring the procedure detected nothing unusual.

The heaters were retained since they were necessary to maintain oxygen pressure. The stirring fans, with their unsealed motors, were removed, which meant the oxygen quantity gauge was no longer accurate. This required adding a third tank so that no tank would go below half full.{{sfn|Gatland|1976|p=281}} The third tank was placed in Bay{{nbsp}}1 of the SM, on the side opposite the other two, and was given an isolation valve that could isolate it from the fuel cells and from the other two oxygen tanks in an emergency, and allow it to feed the CM's environmental system only. The quantity probe was upgraded from aluminum to stainless steel.{{sfn|Apollo 14 Press Kit|1971|pp=96\u201397}}\n\nAll electrical wiring in Bay{{nbsp}}4 was sheathed in stainless steel. The fuel cell oxygen supply valves were redesigned to isolate the Teflon-coated wiring from the oxygen. The spacecraft and Mission Control monitoring systems were modified to give more immediate and visible warnings of anomalies.{{sfn|Gatland|1976|p=281}} An emergency supply of {{convert|5|USgal|l|order=flip}} of water was stored in the CM, and an emergency battery, identical to those that powered the LM's descent stage, was placed in the SM.

Official rules treat the ''Q'' tile as just one letter, but usually Catalan players use the ''Q'' tile like the ''QU'' digraph and all Catalan Scrabble Clubs use this ''de facto'' rule.<ref>http://scrabble3mundial.wordpress.com/normes-generals/ {{in lang|ca}}</ref> While \u00c7 is a separate tile, other diacritic marks are ignored.\n\nThere is a Catalan Scrabble clone which uses the same 21x21 board as Super Scrabble.<ref>http://blocs.xtec.cat/crpesplugues/files/2012/01/scrabble.jpg</ref>\n<ref>esqueimada, \"Superscrabble...en diferido\", Club de Scrabble(R) Queimada en Castellano, May 22, 2008, 11:49:00 AM, http://scrabblequeimada.blogspot.com/2008_05_01_archive.html</ref> It includes the following 200 tiles, with the ''Q'' tile replaced with the ''QU'' digraph, because Q in Catalan is never without a U after it, and with two of the special tiles, ''\u00c7'' and ''L\u00b7L'', increased in value:\n*<span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\">5 wild (asterisk) tiles scoring 0 points</span>\n*''1 point'': <span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\">'''E''' \u00d727</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\">'''A''' \u00d725</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\">'''S''' \u00d719</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\">'''I''' \u00d717</span>, '''R''' \u00d716, '''N''' \u00d712, '''O''' \u00d710, '''T''' \u00d710, '''L''' \u00d78, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">'''U''' \u00d76</span>\n*''2 points'': <span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\">'''M''' \u00d77</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">'''C''' \u00d75</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">'''D''' \u00d75</span>\n*''3 points'': <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">'''B''' \u00d73</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">'''G''' \u00d73</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">'''P''' \u00d73</span>\n*''4 points'': '''F''' \u00d72, '''V''' \u00d72\n*''8 points'': '''H''' \u00d72, '''J''' \u00d72, '''QU''' \u00d72, '''Z''' \u00d72\n*''10 points'': '''NY''' \u00d72, '''X''' \u00d72\n*''12 points'': '''\u00c7''' \u00d72\n*''15 points'': <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">'''L\u00b7L''' \u00d71</span>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Croatian==\n\n{|class=\"infobox wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ Croatian letter distribution<br/>\n! !! \u00d71 !! \u00d72 !! \u00d73 !! \u00d74 !! \u00d75 !! \u00d76 !! \u00d79 !! \u00d710 !! \u00d711\n|- \n! 0\n| || [blank] || || || || || || ||\n|-\n! 1\n| || || || J U || R S T || N || E O || I || A\n|-\n! 2\n| || || K M P V || || || || || ||\n|-\n! 3\n| B \u010c || G L Z || D || || || || || ||\n|-\n! 4\n| C H LJ NJ \u0160 \u017d || || || || || || || ||\n|-\n! 5\n| \u0106 || || || || || || || ||\n|-\n! 8\n| F || || || || || || || ||\n|-\n! 10\n| D\u017d \u0110 || || || || || || || ||\n|}\n\n[[Croatian language|Croatian]]-language Scrabble sets use the following 103 tiles:\n\n*2 blank tiles (scoring 0 points)\n*''1 point'': '''A''' \u00d711, '''I''' \u00d710, '''E''' \u00d79, '''O''' \u00d79, '''N''' \u00d76, '''R''' \u00d75, '''S''' \u00d75, '''T''' \u00d75, '''J''' \u00d74, '''U''' \u00d74\n*''2 points'': '''K''' \u00d73, '''M''' \u00d73, '''P''' \u00d73, '''V''' \u00d73\n*''3 points'': '''D''' \u00d73, '''G''' \u00d72, '''L''' \u00d72, '''Z''' \u00d72, '''B''' \u00d71, '''\u010c''' \u00d71\n*''4 points'': '''C''' \u00d71, '''H''' \u00d71, '''LJ''' \u00d71, '''NJ''' \u00d71, '''\u0160''' \u00d71, '''\u017d''' \u00d71\n*''5 points'': '''\u0106''' \u00d71\n*''8 points'': '''F''' \u00d71\n*''10 points'': '''D\u017d''' \u00d71, '''\u0110''' \u00d71\n''Q'', ''W'', ''X'' and ''Y'' are not included, as Croatian does not use those letters.

The score of 20 for a ''K'' is the highest known point value for any letter in any Scrabble score distribution worldwide. ''Y'' is absent in all sets except the paleographic extension of the first set because it is rare in Latin. ''K'' and ''Z'' are also absent in all sets because they are rare in Latin, while ''J'' is not considered separate from ''I'' in all sets except the third one, in which it is  not included because it is rare in Latin.

The score of 20 for a ''K'' is the highest known point value for any letter in any Scrabble score distribution worldwide. ''Y'' is absent in all sets except the paleographic extension of the first set because it is rare in Latin. ''K'' and ''Z'' are also absent in all sets because they are rare in Latin, while ''J'' is not considered separate from ''I'' in all sets except the third one, in which it is  not included because it is rare in Latin.

It turns out the pig wasn't injured but just hungry, and he gets back his health when he eats Karin's [[apple]]. When Karin gets to her school called Sei Ringo Gakuen (St. Ringo School), she discovers that the pig has stowed away in her backpack which causes her more trouble.\n\nLater, she meets the pig again and finds out he can talk and fly. The pig gives her a \"Dream Tonpact\" which she opens and a pig snout appears from it and attaches itself to her nose! She finds the pig again who explains that he is actually [[Prince]] Tonrariano the 3rd (Iggy Pig) of the apple-shaped [[planet]] Buringo (Oinko). He tells her how she can transform: by saying \"Ba Bi Bu Be Burin!\" she transforms into a superpowered pink piglet called Tonde Burin (Super Pig). This is not something Karin is happy about at all as she'd rather transform into a magical girl heroine like her idol the [[tokusatsu]] character \"Cutey Chao\" (who is possibly a reference to [[Cutie Honey]]). Tonrari\u0101no (who she calls Ton-chan) tells her if she can collect 108 pearls by doing good deeds as Burin, she can do so. The pearl collection operates on karma meaning if Burin abuses her powers, she will lose pearls.\n\nWhenever someone is in danger, Karin becomes Tonde Burin to thwart the crisis and uses her new abilities to help other people in need.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main characters===\n; {{nihongo|Karin Kokubu|\u56fd\u5206\u679c\u6797|Kokubu Karin}} / Kassie Carlen\n: {{voiced by|[[Yuri Shiratori]]|[[Julie Maddalena]]}}\n: The main protagonist of the series. Karin Kokubu was an ordinary 13-year-old schoolgirl in 7th grade who came across Tonrariano the 3rd one day while on her way to school and gave him an apple. When she gets to school, Karin discovers that the pig has stowed away in her bag which causes her more trouble. Later, she meets the pig again and finds out he can talk and fly. Karin finds a compact which she opens and a pig snout appears from it and attaches itself to her nose! Karin learns that Tonrariano comes from the Buringo World and that she can transform into Tonde Burin, the Pig Girl of Love and Courage. Tonrariano tells her if she can collect 108 [[pearls]] by doing good deeds as Burin she can take on another hero form. The pearl collection operates on [[karma]] meaning if Tonde Burin abuses her powers, she will lose pearls. There is another drawback to the Tonde Burin alias...If anyone finds out her identity, she will be stuck in the form of a pig for the rest of her life. Karin has a crush on Koichi Mizuno who happens to like Burin. She has a hobby in painting. When in her Burin alias, she worries about her secret being found out by her father, her little brother, and Jimmy Matsumoto.\n; {{nihongo|Tonrariano the 3rd|\u30c8\u30f3\u30e9\u30ea\u30a2\u30fc\u30ce\uff13\u4e16|Tonrari\u0101no San-sei}} / Iggy Pig\n: {{voiced by|[[Yuriko Fuchizaki]]|[[Derek Stephen Prince]]}}\n: Tonrariano the 3rd is a yellow pig who is a prince from Buuringo and the son of Tonrariano the 2nd.

He is carefree and well-read yet regrets that Karin hates her Burin plight. Like Burin, Tonrariano can fly and acts as an advisor to Burin. On some occasions, Tonrariano can dress up as Tonde Burin in events in which Karin and Tonde Burin are to be in the same area.\n\n===Supporting characters===\n; {{nihongo|Masami Yamakawa|\u5c71\u5ddd\u771f\u5b9f|Yamakawa Masami}} / Prudence Plumm\n: {{voiced by|[[Chie Sat\u014d]]|[[Caryn Rosenthal]]}}\n: Masami Yamakawa is Karin's best friend who is on the tennis team.

An [[anime]] series based on the manga was created by [[Nippon Animation]] and was broadcast on all [[Mainichi Broadcasting System|MBS]] stations in Japan from September 3, 1994 through August 26, 1995.\n\nAn English language-version titled '''''Super Pig''''' was produced by [[Saban Entertainment]] in 1997.<ref>Credits of the show</ref><ref>http://lostmediawiki.com/Super_Pig_(Saban_dub)</ref><ref>http://www.retrojunk.com/content/child/description/page/41881/super-pig</ref><ref>http://www.jbox.com.br/materias/super-pig/</ref> This dub aired in New Zealand on [[TV2 (New Zealand)|TV2]].<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20021003102045/http://tv2.nzoom.com/tv2_subcategory/1,2559,318-325,00.html</ref><ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20021204120651/http://tv2.nzoom.com/tv2_subcategory/0,2559,318-322-saturday,00.html</ref> From 1998 to 1999 the Saban dub aired in the Netherlands on [[Fox Kids Europe|Fox Kids]] with Dutch subtitles.<ref>http://www.beaujinfulday.nl/entertainment/nostalgie-21-kinderprogrammas-die-je-waarschijnlijk-vergeten-bent/</ref> Another English dub aired only in the Philippines under the title '''''Super Boink'''''; this dub kept all the original music.\n\n==Plot==\nKarin Kokubu (Kassie Carlen) is late for school one day when she comes across an apparently injured yellow pig. It turns out the pig wasn't injured but just hungry, and he gets back his health when he eats Karin's [[apple]]. When Karin gets to her school called Sei Ringo Gakuen (St. Ringo School), she discovers that the pig has stowed away in her backpack which causes her more trouble.\n\nLater, she meets the pig again and finds out he can talk and fly. The pig gives her a \"Dream Tonpact\" which she opens and a pig snout appears from it and attaches itself to her nose! She finds the pig again who explains that he is actually [[Prince]] Tonrariano the 3rd (Iggy Pig) of the apple-shaped [[planet]] Buringo (Oinko). He tells her how she can transform: by saying \"Ba Bi Bu Be Burin!\" she transforms into a superpowered pink piglet called Tonde Burin (Super Pig). This is not something Karin is happy about at all as she'd rather transform into a magical girl heroine like her idol the [[tokusatsu]] character \"Cutey Chao\" (who is possibly a reference to [[Cutie Honey]]). Tonrari\u0101no (who she calls Ton-chan) tells her if she can collect 108 pearls by doing good deeds as Burin, she can do so. The pearl collection operates on karma meaning if Burin abuses her powers, she will lose pearls.\n\nWhenever someone is in danger, Karin becomes Tonde Burin to thwart the crisis and uses her new abilities to help other people in need.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main characters===\n; {{nihongo|Karin Kokubu|\u56fd\u5206\u679c\u6797|Kokubu Karin}} / Kassie Carlen\n: {{voiced by|[[Yuri Shiratori]]|[[Julie Maddalena]]}}\n: The main protagonist of the series. Karin Kokubu was an ordinary 13-year-old schoolgirl in 7th grade who came across Tonrariano the 3rd one day while on her way to school and gave him an apple. When she gets to school, Karin discovers that the pig has stowed away in her bag which causes her more trouble. Later, she meets the pig again and finds out he can talk and fly. Karin finds a compact which she opens and a pig snout appears from it and attaches itself to her nose! Karin learns that Tonrariano comes from the Buringo World and that she can transform into Tonde Burin, the Pig Girl of Love and Courage. Tonrariano tells her if she can collect 108 [[pearls]] by doing good deeds as Burin she can take on another hero form. The pearl collection operates on [[karma]] meaning if Tonde Burin abuses her powers, she will lose pearls. There is another drawback to the Tonde Burin alias...If anyone finds out her identity, she will be stuck in the form of a pig for the rest of her life. Karin has a crush on Koichi Mizuno who happens to like Burin. She has a hobby in painting. When in her Burin alias, she worries about her secret being found out by her father, her little brother, and Jimmy Matsumoto.\n; {{nihongo|Tonrariano the 3rd|\u30c8\u30f3\u30e9\u30ea\u30a2\u30fc\u30ce\uff13\u4e16|Tonrari\u0101no San-sei}} / Iggy Pig\n: {{voiced by|[[Yuriko Fuchizaki]]|[[Derek Stephen Prince]]}}\n: Tonrariano the 3rd is a yellow pig who is a prince from Buuringo and the son of Tonrariano the 2nd.

Unfortunately, during the trip, Fred and Barney accidentally stumble across Rockula's old laboratory, where his unfinished Frankenstone monster sleeps, and forget to close the window when they leave the lab. Lightning subsequently strikes the machines in the lab, and provide Frankenstone with life. Frankenstone awakens Rockula (who has been asleep for the past five hundred years, thus explaining his disappearance) from his secret crypt, and the two scare everyone out of the hotel, except for the Flintstones and the Rubbles, who had gone to bed early due to jet lag.\n\nRockula and Frankenstone eventually discover the Flintstones and Rubbles, and Rockula mistakes Wilma for his long-lost bride and vows to make her his, even if it means killing Fred. Wilma initially mistakes Rockula for the hotel manager, Mr. Silika, who had dressed up as Rockula, for quite some time until Rockula turns into a bat in front of her. As Fred, Barney and Betty discover Wilma's absence and begin searching for her, Wilma flees and a long cat-and-mouse chase ensues all over the castle. Rockula finds and corners Fred, but is scared off by Barney, wearing a werewolf mask. The couples eventually end up cornered inside the Rubbles' room. Fred challenges Rockula to a fight, using a bat statuette as a weapon, but the statuette turns out to actually be the switch for the trapdoor to Rockula's laboratory, which Rockula and Frankenstone were unknowingly standing on. As Fred raises the statuette to strike, both Rockula and Frankenstone fall through the trapdoor, and the Flintstones and Rubbles escape and return to Bedrock. Wilma invites Betty and Barney to stay for dinner and leaves the three of them in the living room while she goes into the kitchen to cook.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, Rockula has flown (in the form of a bat) all the way from Rocksylvania to Bedrock. Flying through the kitchen window, he begs Wilma to marry him, promising her a life of luxury if she agrees. Winking at Fred, Barney and Betty (watching surreptitiously from the doorway), Wilma agrees to consider marrying Rockula, then immediately begins nagging him about chores, upkeep of the house, and his bad habits. Aghast, Rockula (apparently forgetting that most chores would be left to the servants) changes back into a bat and flies off, claiming to need another 500 years of rest. Barney laughs and lauds Wilma for defeating Rockula by telling him \"the real truth about married life\".\n\n==Rockula and Frankenstone==\n*'''Count Rockula''': a campy and not-so-bloodthirsty vampire with a lust for women and a fear of werewolves, prompting him to build a Frankenstone monster to keep them away. Having been asleep for five hundred years, Rockula is awoken by Frankenstone and sets out to clear his castle of the guests and take Wilma, whom he thinks is his bride, for himself, even if it means killing Fred. Count Rockula also appears in the episodes \"Blood Brothers\" and \"Fred and Barney Meet the Frankenstones\" of ''The New Fred and Barney Show'', again voiced by Stephenson, albeit in a completely different continuity because Rockula then has a bride, slightly different garments, and a pet werewolf despite having a fear for them in this movie.\n*'''Frankenstone''': Count Rockula's unfinished creation, awoken prematurely when lightning strikes the machinery in Rockula's lab. His only mission in life is to carry out Rockula's orders, primarily to keep werewolves away from Rockula, although his low IQ often leads him to find difficulty in accomplishing even the simplest of tasks (in one particular scene, Frankenstone is ordered to search some barrels for Fred, and fails to notice Fred crouching right beside him).

Unfortunately, during the trip, Fred and Barney accidentally stumble across Rockula's old laboratory, where his unfinished Frankenstone monster sleeps, and forget to close the window when they leave the lab. Lightning subsequently strikes the machines in the lab, and provide Frankenstone with life. Frankenstone awakens Rockula (who has been asleep for the past five hundred years, thus explaining his disappearance) from his secret crypt, and the two scare everyone out of the hotel, except for the Flintstones and the Rubbles, who had gone to bed early due to jet lag.\n\nRockula and Frankenstone eventually discover the Flintstones and Rubbles, and Rockula mistakes Wilma for his long-lost bride and vows to make her his, even if it means killing Fred. Wilma initially mistakes Rockula for the hotel manager, Mr. Silika, who had dressed up as Rockula, for quite some time until Rockula turns into a bat in front of her. As Fred, Barney and Betty discover Wilma's absence and begin searching for her, Wilma flees and a long cat-and-mouse chase ensues all over the castle. Rockula finds and corners Fred, but is scared off by Barney, wearing a werewolf mask. The couples eventually end up cornered inside the Rubbles' room. Fred challenges Rockula to a fight, using a bat statuette as a weapon, but the statuette turns out to actually be the switch for the trapdoor to Rockula's laboratory, which Rockula and Frankenstone were unknowingly standing on. As Fred raises the statuette to strike, both Rockula and Frankenstone fall through the trapdoor, and the Flintstones and Rubbles escape and return to Bedrock. Wilma invites Betty and Barney to stay for dinner and leaves the three of them in the living room while she goes into the kitchen to cook.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, Rockula has flown (in the form of a bat) all the way from Rocksylvania to Bedrock. Flying through the kitchen window, he begs Wilma to marry him, promising her a life of luxury if she agrees. Winking at Fred, Barney and Betty (watching surreptitiously from the doorway), Wilma agrees to consider marrying Rockula, then immediately begins nagging him about chores, upkeep of the house, and his bad habits. Aghast, Rockula (apparently forgetting that most chores would be left to the servants) changes back into a bat and flies off, claiming to need another 500 years of rest. Barney laughs and lauds Wilma for defeating Rockula by telling him \"the real truth about married life\".\n\n==Rockula and Frankenstone==\n*'''Count Rockula''': a campy and not-so-bloodthirsty vampire with a lust for women and a fear of werewolves, prompting him to build a Frankenstone monster to keep them away. Having been asleep for five hundred years, Rockula is awoken by Frankenstone and sets out to clear his castle of the guests and take Wilma, whom he thinks is his bride, for himself, even if it means killing Fred. Count Rockula also appears in the episodes \"Blood Brothers\" and \"Fred and Barney Meet the Frankenstones\" of ''The New Fred and Barney Show'', again voiced by Stephenson, albeit in a completely different continuity because Rockula then has a bride, slightly different garments, and a pet werewolf despite having a fear for them in this movie.\n*'''Frankenstone''': Count Rockula's unfinished creation, awoken prematurely when lightning strikes the machinery in Rockula's lab. His only mission in life is to carry out Rockula's orders, primarily to keep werewolves away from Rockula, although his low IQ often leads him to find difficulty in accomplishing even the simplest of tasks (in one particular scene, Frankenstone is ordered to search some barrels for Fred, and fails to notice Fred crouching right beside him). Despite the resemblance, he is not to be confused with the Frank Frankenstone character that first appeared in the episode \"Fred & Barney Meet the Frankenstones\" of ''[[The New Fred and Barney Show]]'', the TV special ''[[The Flintstones' New Neighbors]]'' or ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Show (1980)|The Flintstone Comedy Show]]''. Frankenstone was one of Ted Cassidy's final roles; the actor, who was already famous for playing Frankenstein's monster-like roles due to his height (most notably [[Lurch (The Addams Family)|Lurch]] on ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]'' and several other productions), died ten months before the special was released.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Henry Corden]] - Fred Flintstone\n* [[Mel Blanc]] - Barney Rubble; Dino\n* [[Jean Vander Pyl]] - Wilma Flintstone; Frau G.

It is a humorous take on [[role-playing games]], based on the concept of [[munchkin (role-playing games)|munchkin]]s (immature role-players, playing only to \"win\" by having the most powerful character possible).\n\n''Munchkin'' won the 2001 [[Origins Award]] for ''Best Traditional Card Game'',<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/2001/list-of-winners|title=Origins Award Winners (2001)| publisher=Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design| accessdate=2007-10-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080202042430/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/2001/list-of-winners <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-02-02}}</ref> and is itself a spin-off of ''The Munchkin's Guide to Powergaming'', a gaming humor book which also won an Origins Award in 2000.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/2000/list-of-winners|title=Origins Award Winners (2000)| publisher=Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design| accessdate=2007-10-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080415213159/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/2000/list-of-winners <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-04-15}}</ref>\n\nAfter the success of the original ''Munchkin'' game several expansion packs and sequels were published.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.worldofmunchkin.com/|title=Munchkin home page| publisher=Steve Jackson Games| accessdate=2007-12-23}}</ref> Now available in 15 different languages, ''Munchkin'' accounted for more than 70% of the 2007 sales for Steve Jackson Games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sjgames.com/general/stakeholders/report08.html|title=2008 Report to the Stakeholders|publisher=Steve Jackson Games|accessdate=2008-03-01}}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\nIn ''Munchkin'', all players start at level 1, with the goal of reaching level 10 (or level 20 in Epic Level games). Players primarily progress by killing monsters, and level up every time they kill a monster. However, players can freely use cards against monsters and other players during play, allowing them to either assist or to sabotage others during their turn. Each person's turn begins when they \"kick down the door\" by drawing a Door Card face-up. A Door Card can be one of the following types: a Monster Card, which the player must engage by fighting or fleeing; a Curse Card, which applies an effect; or an Item Card, Race Card, or Class Card, which the player adds to their hand. If the card drawn is not a Monster Card, the player can either \"loot the room\" by drawing a face-down door card and adding it to their hand, or \"look for trouble\" by playing a Monster Card from their hand to fight it.\n\nWhen fighting a monster, the total level of the player (and any supporting players) is weighed against the total level of the monster(s) to determine the victor. A successful player draws the listed amount of treasure cards and levels up either 1 or 2 levels, but an unsuccessful character must roll the dice to try and flee; players who fail to roll a five or six suffer the monster's negative effects (\"Bad Stuff\") or die. Should a player die, their turn immediately ends and they discard their hand, retaining their player level but drawing a new hand for equipment.\n\nDue to the highly competitive nature of the game and the presence of rule-breaking cards, players are encouraged to use unfair tactics against others, to act [[mercenary]] to further themselves at the expense of others, or to use cheat cards to affect outcomes (such as fixing the roll of the die). Throughout a player's turn, others are free to intervene: they can passively [[status effect|buff or debuff]] the player or monsters to alter the outcome; play monster cards of matching types to make the battle more difficult; or offer to assist the player, typically in exchange for treasure cards.\n\n[[File:Munchkin card game being played , March 2014.jpeg|thumb|A game of Munchkin being played, with coins being used to denote levels.]]\nOther cards that can enter play include Items, which can be used in combat, Treasure Cards, which act as sellable loot and equipment, and Curse Cards, which apply effects. Additionally, players can equip certain cards (such as armor and weapons) to raise their total level and kill stronger monsters, and can use Class Cards and Race Cards to grant extra abilities or advantages at the cost of a balanced weakness; for example, the elf race can level when helping others kill monsters, but will take additional damage from disgusting enemies.\n\nStandard games typically last around an hour, with the game ending once a player reaches the target level and wins the match. Aside from defeating monsters, players can progress through indirect means such as selling cards (with every 1000 Gold on the sum total granting a level) or by playing special leveling cards. Most games disallow victory through indirect methods, meaning only fighting a monster can win the game. There are a few exceptions, however, such as when a player uses cards that specifically state they override rules.\n\n==Variants, Expansions & Accessories==\n===Variants===\nThese are themed \"box set\" editions of MUNCHKIN that have been released. (The overall theme parodied by each set is after the title.) Each is a stand-alone version that can be played separately or combined with any other version for a more expansive game. Most of these editions were illustrated by [[John Kovalic]], although some were done by other artists (who are noted if applicable). Some of these have been released in Deluxe versions (which include a gameboard and movers to keep track of levels) and/or Guest Artist Editions (drawn with new art by artists other than those who originally drew them). Certain versions have been co-produced with [[USAopoly]] and/or [[IDW Games]], and feature \"character cards\" that grant starting powers and keep track of levels.

It is a humorous take on [[role-playing games]], based on the concept of [[munchkin (role-playing games)|munchkin]]s (immature role-players, playing only to \"win\" by having the most powerful character possible).\n\n''Munchkin'' won the 2001 [[Origins Award]] for ''Best Traditional Card Game'',<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/2001/list-of-winners|title=Origins Award Winners (2001)| publisher=Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design| accessdate=2007-10-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080202042430/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/2001/list-of-winners <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-02-02}}</ref> and is itself a spin-off of ''The Munchkin's Guide to Powergaming'', a gaming humor book which also won an Origins Award in 2000.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/2000/list-of-winners|title=Origins Award Winners (2000)| publisher=Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design| accessdate=2007-10-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080415213159/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/2000/list-of-winners <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-04-15}}</ref>\n\nAfter the success of the original ''Munchkin'' game several expansion packs and sequels were published.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.worldofmunchkin.com/|title=Munchkin home page| publisher=Steve Jackson Games| accessdate=2007-12-23}}</ref> Now available in 15 different languages, ''Munchkin'' accounted for more than 70% of the 2007 sales for Steve Jackson Games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sjgames.com/general/stakeholders/report08.html|title=2008 Report to the Stakeholders|publisher=Steve Jackson Games|accessdate=2008-03-01}}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\nIn ''Munchkin'', all players start at level 1, with the goal of reaching level 10 (or level 20 in Epic Level games). Players primarily progress by killing monsters, and level up every time they kill a monster. However, players can freely use cards against monsters and other players during play, allowing them to either assist or to sabotage others during their turn. Each person's turn begins when they \"kick down the door\" by drawing a Door Card face-up. A Door Card can be one of the following types: a Monster Card, which the player must engage by fighting or fleeing; a Curse Card, which applies an effect; or an Item Card, Race Card, or Class Card, which the player adds to their hand. If the card drawn is not a Monster Card, the player can either \"loot the room\" by drawing a face-down door card and adding it to their hand, or \"look for trouble\" by playing a Monster Card from their hand to fight it.\n\nWhen fighting a monster, the total level of the player (and any supporting players) is weighed against the total level of the monster(s) to determine the victor. A successful player draws the listed amount of treasure cards and levels up either 1 or 2 levels, but an unsuccessful character must roll the dice to try and flee; players who fail to roll a five or six suffer the monster's negative effects (\"Bad Stuff\") or die. Should a player die, their turn immediately ends and they discard their hand, retaining their player level but drawing a new hand for equipment.\n\nDue to the highly competitive nature of the game and the presence of rule-breaking cards, players are encouraged to use unfair tactics against others, to act [[mercenary]] to further themselves at the expense of others, or to use cheat cards to affect outcomes (such as fixing the roll of the die). Throughout a player's turn, others are free to intervene: they can passively [[status effect|buff or debuff]] the player or monsters to alter the outcome; play monster cards of matching types to make the battle more difficult; or offer to assist the player, typically in exchange for treasure cards.\n\n[[File:Munchkin card game being played , March 2014.jpeg|thumb|A game of Munchkin being played, with coins being used to denote levels.]]\nOther cards that can enter play include Items, which can be used in combat, Treasure Cards, which act as sellable loot and equipment, and Curse Cards, which apply effects. Additionally, players can equip certain cards (such as armor and weapons) to raise their total level and kill stronger monsters, and can use Class Cards and Race Cards to grant extra abilities or advantages at the cost of a balanced weakness; for example, the elf race can level when helping others kill monsters, but will take additional damage from disgusting enemies.\n\nStandard games typically last around an hour, with the game ending once a player reaches the target level and wins the match. Aside from defeating monsters, players can progress through indirect means such as selling cards (with every 1000 Gold on the sum total granting a level) or by playing special leveling cards. Most games disallow victory through indirect methods, meaning only fighting a monster can win the game. There are a few exceptions, however, such as when a player uses cards that specifically state they override rules.\n\n==Variants, Expansions & Accessories==\n===Variants===\nThese are themed \"box set\" editions of MUNCHKIN that have been released. (The overall theme parodied by each set is after the title.) Each is a stand-alone version that can be played separately or combined with any other version for a more expansive game. Most of these editions were illustrated by [[John Kovalic]], although some were done by other artists (who are noted if applicable). Some of these have been released in Deluxe versions (which include a gameboard and movers to keep track of levels) and/or Guest Artist Editions (drawn with new art by artists other than those who originally drew them). Certain versions have been co-produced with [[USAopoly]] and/or [[IDW Games]], and feature \"character cards\" that grant starting powers and keep track of levels.

To address the financial demands of Stanford's growth requirements, and to provide local employment opportunities for graduating students, [[Frederick Terman]] proposed the leasing of Stanford's lands for use as an office park, named the [[Stanford Industrial Park]] (later [[Stanford Research Park]]) in the year 1951. Leases were limited to high technology companies. Its first tenant was [[Varian Associates]], founded by Stanford alumni in the 1930s to build military radar components. However, Terman also found [[venture capital]] for civilian technology start-ups. One of the major success stories was [[Hewlett-Packard]]. Founded in [[Packard's garage]] by Stanford graduates [[William Reddington Hewlett|William Hewlett]] and [[David Packard]], Hewlett-Packard moved its offices into the Stanford Research Park shortly after 1953. In 1954, Stanford created the Honors Cooperative Program to allow full-time employees of the companies to pursue graduate degrees from the University on a part-time basis. The initial companies signed five-year agreements in which they would pay double the tuition for each student in order to cover the costs.

Unlike many other researchers who used germanium as the semiconductor material, Shockley believed that silicon was the better material for making transistors. Shockley intended to replace the current transistor with a new three-element design (today known as the [[Shockley diode]]), but the design was considerably more difficult to build than the \"simple\" transistor. In 1957, Shockley decided to end research on the silicon transistor. As a result of Shockley's abusive management style, eight engineers left the company to form [[Fairchild Semiconductor]]; Shockley referred to them as the \"[[traitorous eight]]\".

Industrial space was plentiful and housing was still inexpensive. Growth during this era was fueled by the emergence of [[venture capital]] on [[Sand Hill Road]], beginning with [[Kleiner Perkins]] and [[Sequoia Capital]] in 1972; the availability of venture capital exploded after the successful $1.3&nbsp;billion [[Initial public offering|IPO]] of [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] in December 1980. Since the 1980s, Silicon Valley has been home to the largest concentration of venture capital firms in the world.<ref name=\"WRichardScott\" />\n\nIn 1971 [[Don Hoefler]] traced the origins of Silicon Valley firms, including via investments from [[Fairchild Semiconductor|Fairchild]]'s eight co-founders.<ref name=DH-71 /><ref name=\"NetValley\">[http://www.netvalley.com/silicon_valley/Legal_Bridge_From_El_Dorado_to_Silicon_Valley.html A Legal Bridge Spanning 100 Years: From the Gold Mines of El Dorado to the \"Golden\" Startups of Silicon Valley] by Gregory Gromov</ref> The key investors in [[Kleiner Perkins]] and [[Sequoia Capital]] were from the same group, directly leading to ''[[Tech Crunch]]'' 2014 estimate of 92 public firms of 130 related listed firms then worth over US$2.1 Trillion with over 2,000 firms traced back to them.<ref name=Morris-2014>{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/26/the-first-trillion-dollar-startup/ |title=The First Trillion-Dollar Startup | work=[[Tech Crunch]] |first=Rhett |last=Morris |date=July 26, 2014 |accessdate=February 22, 2019}}</ref>\n{{Wide image|Silicon Vally Venture Capital investment.png|800px|align-cap=center|Silicon Valley [[venture capital]] investment, 2002-2017.|100%|center}}\n\n===Law firms===\nPrior to 1970, most Northern California lawyers were based in San Francisco, especially the experienced [[patent attorney]]s whom the high-tech industry needed to protect its intellectual property.  During the 1970s, lawyers began to follow venture capitalists down the [[San Francisco Peninsula|Peninsula]] to serve the booming high-tech industry in Silicon Valley.

Silicon Valley has significantly influenced computer operating systems, [[software]], and user interfaces.\n\nUsing money from [[NASA]], the [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]], and [[DARPA|ARPA]], [[Doug Engelbart]] invented the [[computer mouse|mouse]] and hypertext-based collaboration tools in the mid-1960s and 1970s while at [[Stanford Research Institute]] (now SRI International), first publicly demonstrated in 1968 in what is now known as [[The Mother of All Demos]].  Engelbart's [[Augmentation Research Center]] at SRI was also involved in launching the [[ARPANET]] (precursor to the [[Internet]]) and starting the [[InterNIC|Network Information Center]] (now [[InterNIC]]). [[Xerox]] hired some of Engelbart's best researchers beginning in the early 1970s. In turn, in the 1970s and 1980s, Xerox's [[Palo Alto Research Center]] (PARC) played a pivotal role in [[object-oriented]] programming, [[graphical user interfaces]] (GUIs), [[Ethernet]], [[PostScript]], and [[laser printers]].\n\nWhile Xerox marketed equipment using its technologies, for the most part its technologies flourished elsewhere. The diaspora of Xerox inventions led directly to [[3Com]] and [[Adobe Systems]], and indirectly to [[Cisco]], [[Apple Computer]], and [[Microsoft]]. Apple's [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] GUI was largely a result of [[Steve Jobs]]' visit to PARC and the subsequent hiring of key personnel.<ref>[http://apple-history.com/gui.html Graphical User Interface (GUI)] from apple-history.com</ref> Cisco's impetus stemmed from the need to route a variety of protocols over [[Stanford University]]'s [[Ethernet]] [[campus network]].<ref>{{cite book |first = John K. |last = Waters |date= 2002 |title= John Chambers and the Cisco Way: Navigating Through Volatility  |publisher= John Wiley & Sons |isbn=  9780471273554| page = 28}}</ref>\n\n===Internet age===\n{{main|Internet}}\nCommercial use of the Internet became practical and grew slowly throughout the early 1990s.\n\nIn 1995, commercial use of the [[Internet]] grew substantially and the initial wave of internet startups, [[Amazon.com]], [[eBay]], and the predecessor to [[Craigslist]] began operations.<ref name=N1995>{{cite book|author1=W.

The word \" [[silicon]]\" in the name originally referred to the large number of innovators and manufacturers in the region specializing in silicon-based [[MOS transistor]]s and [[integrated circuit]] chips. The area is now home to many of the world's largest [[Technology company|high-tech corporations]], including the headquarters of more than 30 businesses in the [[Fortune 1000]], and thousands of [[startup company|startup companies]]. Silicon Valley also accounts for one-third of all of the [[venture capital]] investment in the United States, which has helped it to become a leading hub and [[startup ecosystem]] for high-tech innovation and scientific development. It was in Silicon Valley that the silicon-based [[integrated circuit]], the [[microprocessor]], and the [[microcomputer]], among other technologies, were developed. As of 2013, the region employed about a quarter of a million [[information technology]] workers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Monthly employment continues upward climb|url=http://www.siliconvalleyindex.org/index.php/economy/employment|publisher=Silicon Valley Index|accessdate=September 24, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130924195800/http://www.siliconvalleyindex.org/index.php/economy/employment|archivedate=September 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAs more high-tech companies were established across San Jose and the Santa Clara Valley, and then north towards the Bay Area's two other major cities, [[San Francisco]] and [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], the term \"Silicon Valley\" has come to have two definitions: a geographic one, referring to [[Santa Clara County]], and a [[metonym]]ical one, referring to all high-tech businesses in the Bay Area. The term is often used as a [[synecdoche]] for the American high-technology [[economic sector]].

It marked completion of an enterprise begun by a couple of San Francisco Merchants' Exchange members named George Sweeney and Theodore E. Baugh\u2026\"  He says, \"In 1849, the gentleman established a [[Wigwag (flag signals)|wigwag]] telegraph station a top a high hill overlooking Portsmouth Squares for signaling arriving ships\u2026 The operator at the first station caught these signals by telescope and relayed them to the Merchant's Exchange for the waiting business community.\"  Arbuckle points to the historic significance the [[Merchants Exchange Building (San Francisco)]] and [[Telegraph Hill, San Francisco]] when he goes on to say \"The first station gave the name ''Telegraph'' to the hill on which it was located.  It was known as the Inner Station; the second, as the Outer Station.  Both used their primitive mode of communication until Messrs. Sweeney and Baugh connected the Outer Station directly with the Merchants's Exchange by electric telegraph Wire.\"\n\nAccording to Arbuckle (p.&nbsp;380\u2013381) Sweeney and Baugh's line was strictly an intra-city, San Francisco-based service; that is until California State Telegraph Company enfranchised on May 3, 1852; whereas, O.E. Allen and C. Burnham led the way to \"build a line from San Francisco to Marysville via San Jose, Stockton, and Sacramento\".  Delays to construction occurred until September 1853; but, \"\u2026San Jose became the first station on the line when the wire arrived here on October 15.  The line was completed when [James] Gamble's northbound crew met a similar crew working southward from Marysville on October 24.\"\n\nThe Bay Area had long been a major site of [[United States Navy]] research and technology. In 1909, [[Charles Herrold]] started the first [[radio]] station in the United States with regularly scheduled programming in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. Later that year, Stanford University graduate [[Cyril Frank Elwell|Cyril Elwell]] purchased the U.S. patents for [[Arc converter|Poulsen arc]] radio transmission technology and founded the Federal Telegraph Corporation (FTC) in [[Palo Alto]].

To address the financial demands of Stanford's growth requirements, and to provide local employment opportunities for graduating students, [[Frederick Terman]] proposed the leasing of Stanford's lands for use as an office park, named the [[Stanford Industrial Park]] (later [[Stanford Research Park]]) in the year 1951. Leases were limited to high technology companies. Its first tenant was [[Varian Associates]], founded by Stanford alumni in the 1930s to build military radar components. However, Terman also found [[venture capital]] for civilian technology start-ups. One of the major success stories was [[Hewlett-Packard]]. Founded in [[Packard's garage]] by Stanford graduates [[William Reddington Hewlett|William Hewlett]] and [[David Packard]], Hewlett-Packard moved its offices into the Stanford Research Park shortly after 1953. In 1954, Stanford created the Honors Cooperative Program to allow full-time employees of the companies to pursue graduate degrees from the University on a part-time basis. The initial companies signed five-year agreements in which they would pay double the tuition for each student in order to cover the costs.

Unlike many other researchers who used germanium as the semiconductor material, Shockley believed that silicon was the better material for making transistors. Shockley intended to replace the current transistor with a new three-element design (today known as the [[Shockley diode]]), but the design was considerably more difficult to build than the \"simple\" transistor. In 1957, Shockley decided to end research on the silicon transistor. As a result of Shockley's abusive management style, eight engineers left the company to form [[Fairchild Semiconductor]]; Shockley referred to them as the \"[[traitorous eight]]\".

Silicon Valley has significantly influenced computer operating systems, [[software]], and user interfaces.\n\nUsing money from [[NASA]], the [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]], and [[DARPA|ARPA]], [[Doug Engelbart]] invented the [[computer mouse|mouse]] and hypertext-based collaboration tools in the mid-1960s and 1970s while at [[Stanford Research Institute]] (now SRI International), first publicly demonstrated in 1968 in what is now known as [[The Mother of All Demos]].  Engelbart's [[Augmentation Research Center]] at SRI was also involved in launching the [[ARPANET]] (precursor to the [[Internet]]) and starting the [[InterNIC|Network Information Center]] (now [[InterNIC]]). [[Xerox]] hired some of Engelbart's best researchers beginning in the early 1970s. In turn, in the 1970s and 1980s, Xerox's [[Palo Alto Research Center]] (PARC) played a pivotal role in [[object-oriented]] programming, [[graphical user interfaces]] (GUIs), [[Ethernet]], [[PostScript]], and [[laser printers]].\n\nWhile Xerox marketed equipment using its technologies, for the most part its technologies flourished elsewhere. The diaspora of Xerox inventions led directly to [[3Com]] and [[Adobe Systems]], and indirectly to [[Cisco]], [[Apple Computer]], and [[Microsoft]]. Apple's [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] GUI was largely a result of [[Steve Jobs]]' visit to PARC and the subsequent hiring of key personnel.<ref>[http://apple-history.com/gui.html Graphical User Interface (GUI)] from apple-history.com</ref> Cisco's impetus stemmed from the need to route a variety of protocols over [[Stanford University]]'s [[Ethernet]] [[campus network]].<ref>{{cite book |first = John K. |last = Waters |date= 2002 |title= John Chambers and the Cisco Way: Navigating Through Volatility  |publisher= John Wiley & Sons |isbn=  9780471273554| page = 28}}</ref>\n\n===Internet age===\n{{main|Internet}}\nCommercial use of the Internet became practical and grew slowly throughout the early 1990s.\n\nIn 1995, commercial use of the [[Internet]] grew substantially and the initial wave of internet startups, [[Amazon.com]], [[eBay]], and the predecessor to [[Craigslist]] began operations.<ref name=N1995>{{cite book|author1=W.
