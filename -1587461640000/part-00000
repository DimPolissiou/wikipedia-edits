That was why he had allowed Streicher, for example, a free hand. The man's stuff, too, was amusing, and very cleverly done. Wherever, he wondered, did Streicher get his constant supply of new material? He, Hitler, was simply on thorns to see each new issue of the ''St\u00fcrmer''.

More ominously, because of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], the people it targeted had begun to disappear from everyday life, which diminished the paper's relevance. Hitler, however, insisted that Streicher receive sufficient support to continue publishing ''Der St\u00fcrmer''. The final edition of the newspaper was published on 1 February 1945.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.thoughtco.com/der-stuermer-newspaper-1779279 |title= Der Stuermer: An Overview of the Nazi's Antisemitic Newspaper  |work= ThoughtCo |author= Jennifer Rosenberg  |date= 2 April 2017 |accessdate= 2 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Antisemitic content==\n[[File:Stuermer1934.gif|thumb|left|upright|1934 ''St\u00fcrmer'' issue: \"Storm above Judah\" \u2013 attacking institutional churches as \"Judaized\" organizations.

The newspaper's lurid content appealed to a large spectrum of readers who were lower class and less-sophisticated.<ref name=\"one\"/> ''Der St\u00fcrmer'' was known for its use of simple themes that required little thought. The newspaper often gave descriptions of how to identify Jewish people, and included racist political cartoons, including antisemitic caricatures. Besides the graphic depictions, articles often focused on imaginary fears, exaggerations, and perceived behavioral differences between Jews and other German citizens.<ref name=two>[[Dennis Showalter|Showalter, Dennis E.]] (1982) ''Little Man What Now?

His publishing and speaking activities were a major part of the evidence presented against him. In essence, the prosecutors took the line that Streicher's role in [[Julius Streicher#Trial and execution|inciting Germans to exterminate Jews]] made him an [[accessory (legal term)|accessory]] to murder, and thus as culpable as those who actually carried out the killing. Prosecutors also introduced decisive and irrefutable evidence that Streicher continued his incendiary articles and speeches when he was well aware that Jews were being slaughtered. Streicher was found guilty of being an accessory for [[crimes against humanity]], and was executed by hanging shortly afterwards.<ref name=\"Streicher judgement\" />\n\n=== Antisemitic caricatures ===\n''Der St\u00fcrmer'' was known for its virulently antisemitic caricatures, which depicted Jews as ugly characters with exaggerated facial features and misshapen bodies. In his propaganda work, Streicher furthered medieval stereotypes accusing Jews of killing children, sacrificing their bodies, and drinking their blood. The large majority of these drawings were the work of [[Philipp Rupprecht]], known as ''Fips'', who was one of the best-known antisemitic cartoonists of Nazi Germany. Through the adaptation and amalgamation of almost every existing antisemitic stereotype, myth, and tradition, Rupprecht's virulent attacks aimed predominantly at the dehumanization and demonization of Jews.<ref>Linsler, Carl-Eric.

Streicher also frequently reported attempts of child molestation by Jews. ''Der St\u00fcrmer'' never lacked details about sexual intercourse, names, and crimes in order to keep readers aroused and entertained. These accusations, articles, and crimes printed in ''Der St\u00fcrmer'' were often inaccurate, and rarely investigated by staff members. In the newspaper's opinion, if a German girl became pregnant by a Jew, the Jew would deny paternity, offer to pay for an abortion, fail to pay child support, or simply leave for the U.S. Within ''Der St\u00fcrmer'', it was not uncommon to read reports of German women aborting their children because they did not want to bring a \"Jewish bastard into the world\".<ref name=\"two\" />\n\nStreicher believed in the antisemitic [[Telegony (pregnancy)|telegony]] hypotheses of [[Artur Dinter]], whose 1917 bestseller book ''Die S\u00fcnde wider das Blut'' (\"The Sin Against the Blood\") claimed that the ejaculation of semen of a Jewish man into the vagina of a \"German-blooded\" woman was sufficient to change the woman so effectively that all of her future descendants would have Jewish blood.<ref name=bensow>{{cite book |last=Bensow |first=Laura |date=2016 |title=\"Frauen und M\u00e4dchen, die Juden sind Euer Verderben!\" Eine Untersuchung antisemitischer NS-Propaganda unter Anwendung der Analysekategorie Geschlecht. |url= |location=Hamburg |publisher=Marta Press |page=140 |isbn= |author-link=}}</ref> This theory was rejected by the Nazis in the [[Nuremberg Laws|1935 Nuremberg racial laws]], and was called a \"heresy\" by the [[Rassenpolitisches Amt|Racial Office of the NSDAP]].<ref name=bensow/> The official Nazi position stated that: \"The racial characteristics of a person are determined by heredity\".<ref name=bensow/>\n\n===Accusations of financial crimes===\nShowalter said, \"For Julius Streicher, the Jews' hatred for [[Christianity]] was concealed only for one reason: Business.\" Jewish businessmen were often portrayed as doing almost anything to obtain financial wealth, which included, in his words, \"become a usurer, a traitor, a murderer\".<ref name=two/> In the summer of 1931, Streicher focused much of the paper's attention on a Jewish-owned butchery. As an example, when a [[philanthropic]] merchant started operating a soup kitchen, ''Der St\u00fcrmer'' ran articles accusing the business of poisoning the food being served. ''Der St\u00fcrmer'' criticized and cherrypicked every single price increase and decrease in Jewish shops, as well as their charitable donations, denouncing it as a further form of financial greed. This attack on Jewish benevolence, generosity and philanthropism received the most public criticism out of all of ''Der St\u00fcrmer'''s antisemitic propaganda. Its \"Letter Box\" encouraged the reporting of Jewish illegal acts, while its unofficial style helped prevent suspicion of propaganda, and lent it an air of authenticity.<ref>Koonz, pp. 230\u2013231</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Germany|Journalism}}\n\n*Other [[:Category:Nazi newspapers|newspapers of Nazi Germany]]:\n**''[[Der Angriff]]'' (\"The Attack\"), Joseph Goebbels' newspaper\n**''[[V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter]]'' (\"[[V\u00f6lkisch]] Observer\"), official Nazi Party newspaper in Munich and, later, Berlin\n**''[[Das Schwarze Korps]]'' (\"The Black Corps\"), the official newspaper of the SS\n*''[[Arijsk\u00fd boj]]'' (\"The Aryan Struggle\", 1940\u20131945), [[Vlajka|Czech fascist]] newspaper inspired by ''Der St\u00fcrmer''\n*''[[The Daily Stormer]]'', American neo-Nazi fake news website named and modeled after ''Der St\u00fcrmer''\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n*Bytwerk, R.L.

London: Pluto Press. p. 334 {{isbn|9780745326252}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHitler considered Streicher's primitive methods to be effective in influencing \"the man in the street\".<ref name=\"one\"/> Although Streicher and his paper were increasingly isolated in the Nazi party, Hitler continued to support Streicher, and was an avid reader of ''Der St\u00fcrmer''.<ref name=bayern/> In December 1941, he stated: \"Streicher is reproached for his ''St\u00fcrmer''. The truth is the opposite of what people say: He idealized the Jew. The Jew is baser, fiercer, more diabolical than Streicher depicted him.\" In February 1942, he praised the newspaper: \"One must never forget the services rendered by the ''St\u00fcrmer''. Now that the Jews are known for what they are, nobody any longer thinks that Streicher libeled them.\"<ref name=tabletalk154331332>[[Hugh R. Trevor-Roper|Trevor-Roper, Hugh R.]] and [[Gerhard L.

That was why he had allowed Streicher, for example, a free hand. The man's stuff, too, was amusing, and very cleverly done. Wherever, he wondered, did Streicher get his constant supply of new material? He, Hitler, was simply on thorns to see each new issue of the ''St\u00fcrmer''. It was the one periodical that he always read with pleasure, from the first page to the last.<ref>Rauschning, Hermann (1939) ''Hitler Speaks''. London: Thornton Buttersworth. pp. 233\u2013234</ref></blockquote>\n\nDuring the war, the paper's circulation suffered because of paper shortages, as well as Streicher's exile from Nuremberg for corruption. More ominously, because of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], the people it targeted had begun to disappear from everyday life, which diminished the paper's relevance. Hitler, however, insisted that Streicher receive sufficient support to continue publishing ''Der St\u00fcrmer''. The final edition of the newspaper was published on 1 February 1945.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.thoughtco.com/der-stuermer-newspaper-1779279 |title= Der Stuermer: An Overview of the Nazi's Antisemitic Newspaper  |work= ThoughtCo |author= Jennifer Rosenberg  |date= 2 April 2017 |accessdate= 2 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Antisemitic content==\n[[File:Stuermer1934.gif|thumb|left|upright|1934 ''St\u00fcrmer'' issue: \"Storm above Judah\" \u2013 attacking institutional churches as \"Judaized\" organizations.

The newspaper's lurid content appealed to a large spectrum of readers who were lower class and less-sophisticated.<ref name=\"one\"/> ''Der St\u00fcrmer'' was known for its use of simple themes that required little thought. The newspaper often gave descriptions of how to identify Jewish people, and included racist political cartoons, including antisemitic caricatures. Besides the graphic depictions, articles often focused on imaginary fears, exaggerations, and perceived behavioral differences between Jews and other German citizens.<ref name=two>[[Dennis Showalter|Showalter, Dennis E.]] (1982) ''Little Man What Now?

His publishing and speaking activities were a major part of the evidence presented against him. In essence, the prosecutors took the line that Streicher's role in [[Julius Streicher#Trial and execution|inciting Germans to exterminate Jews]] made him an [[accessory (legal term)|accessory]] to murder, and thus as culpable as those who actually carried out the killing. Prosecutors also introduced decisive and irrefutable evidence that Streicher continued his incendiary articles and speeches when he was well aware that Jews were being slaughtered. Streicher was found guilty of being an accessory for [[crimes against humanity]], and was executed by hanging shortly afterwards.<ref name=\"Streicher judgement\" />\n\n=== Antisemitic caricatures ===\n''Der St\u00fcrmer'' was known for its virulently antisemitic caricatures, which depicted Jews as ugly characters with exaggerated facial features and misshapen bodies. In his propaganda work, Streicher furthered medieval stereotypes accusing Jews of killing children, sacrificing their bodies, and drinking their blood. The large majority of these drawings were the work of [[Philipp Rupprecht]], known as ''Fips'', who was one of the best-known antisemitic cartoonists of Nazi Germany. Through the adaptation and amalgamation of almost every existing antisemitic stereotype, myth, and tradition, Rupprecht's virulent attacks aimed predominantly at the dehumanization and demonization of Jews.<ref>Linsler, Carl-Eric.

Streicher also frequently reported attempts of child molestation by Jews. ''Der St\u00fcrmer'' never lacked details about sexual intercourse, names, and crimes in order to keep readers aroused and entertained. These accusations, articles, and crimes printed in ''Der St\u00fcrmer'' were often inaccurate, and rarely investigated by staff members. In the newspaper's opinion, if a German girl became pregnant by a Jew, the Jew would deny paternity, offer to pay for an abortion, fail to pay child support, or simply leave for the U.S. Within ''Der St\u00fcrmer'', it was not uncommon to read reports of German women aborting their children because they did not want to bring a \"Jewish bastard into the world\".<ref name=\"two\" />\n\nStreicher believed in the antisemitic [[Telegony (pregnancy)|telegony]] hypotheses of [[Artur Dinter]], whose 1917 bestseller book ''Die S\u00fcnde wider das Blut'' (\"The Sin Against the Blood\") claimed that the ejaculation of semen of a Jewish man into the vagina of a \"German-blooded\" woman was sufficient to change the woman so effectively that all of her future descendants would have Jewish blood.<ref name=bensow>{{cite book |last=Bensow |first=Laura |date=2016 |title=\"Frauen und M\u00e4dchen, die Juden sind Euer Verderben!\" Eine Untersuchung antisemitischer NS-Propaganda unter Anwendung der Analysekategorie Geschlecht. |url= |location=Hamburg |publisher=Marta Press |page=140 |isbn= |author-link=}}</ref> This theory was rejected by the Nazis in the [[Nuremberg Laws|1935 Nuremberg racial laws]], and was called a \"heresy\" by the [[Rassenpolitisches Amt|Racial Office of the NSDAP]].<ref name=bensow/> The official Nazi position stated that: \"The racial characteristics of a person are determined by heredity\".<ref name=bensow/>\n\n===Accusations of financial crimes===\nShowalter said, \"For Julius Streicher, the Jews' hatred for [[Christianity]] was concealed only for one reason: Business.\" Jewish businessmen were often portrayed as doing almost anything to obtain financial wealth, which included, in his words, \"become a usurer, a traitor, a murderer\".<ref name=two/> In the summer of 1931, Streicher focused much of the paper's attention on a Jewish-owned butchery. As an example, when a [[philanthropic]] merchant started operating a soup kitchen, ''Der St\u00fcrmer'' ran articles accusing the business of poisoning the food being served. ''Der St\u00fcrmer'' criticized and cherrypicked every single price increase and decrease in Jewish shops, as well as their charitable donations, denouncing it as a further form of financial greed. This attack on Jewish benevolence, generosity and philanthropism received the most public criticism out of all of ''Der St\u00fcrmer'''s antisemitic propaganda. Its \"Letter Box\" encouraged the reporting of Jewish illegal acts, while its unofficial style helped prevent suspicion of propaganda, and lent it an air of authenticity.<ref>Koonz, pp. 230\u2013231</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Germany|Journalism}}\n\n*Other [[:Category:Nazi newspapers|newspapers of Nazi Germany]]:\n**''[[Der Angriff]]'' (\"The Attack\"), Joseph Goebbels' newspaper\n**''[[V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter]]'' (\"[[V\u00f6lkisch]] Observer\"), official Nazi Party newspaper in Munich and, later, Berlin\n**''[[Das Schwarze Korps]]'' (\"The Black Corps\"), the official newspaper of the SS\n*''[[Arijsk\u00fd boj]]'' (\"The Aryan Struggle\", 1940\u20131945), [[Vlajka|Czech fascist]] newspaper inspired by ''Der St\u00fcrmer''\n*''[[The Daily Stormer]]'', American neo-Nazi fake news website named and modeled after ''Der St\u00fcrmer''\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n*Bytwerk, R.L.

It was initially applicable to commercial aviation. Then, it became also a requirement for Defense projects, including Land and Sea vehicles. As a consequence, today, many maintenance manuals are written in STE.\n\n==History==\nFirst attempts towards a form of controlled English were made as early as the 1930s and 1970s with Basic English and Caterpillar Fundamental English.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kaiser |first1=Herbert |title=A Close Look at STE |url=http://www.tcworld.info/e-magazine/technical-communication/article/a-close-look-at-simplified-technical-english/ |website=TC World |accessdate=20 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1979 aerospace documentation was written in American English ([[Boeing]], Douglas, Lockheed, etc.), in British English ([[Hawker Siddeley]], [[British Aircraft Corporation]], etc.) and by companies whose native language was not English ([[Fokker]], [[Aeritalia]], [[Aerospatiale]], and some of the companies that formed [[Airbus]] at the time). There were also European airlines that had to translate parts of their maintenance documentation into other languages for their local mechanics.\n\nThis led the European Airline industry to approach AECMA (European Association of Aerospace Industries) to ask manufacturers to investigate the possibility of using a controlled form of English.  In 1983, after an investigation into the different types of controlled languages that existed in other industries, the AECMA decided to produce its own controlled English.  The AIA (Aerospace Industries Association of America) was also invited to participate in this development.\n\nThe result of this collaborative work was a guide, known as the AECMA Simplified English Guide. After a merger of AECMA with two other associations to form ASD in 2004, the specification changed its name to become ASD Simplified Technical English, Specification [[ASD-STE100]].\n\n==Benefits==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}\nSimplified Technical English is claimed{{by whom|date=January 2014}} to:\n* Reduce [[ambiguity]]\n* Improve the clarity of technical writing, especially procedural writing\n* Improve comprehension for people whose first language is not English\n* Make human translation easier, faster and more cost effective\n* Facilitate [[computer-assisted translation]] and [[machine translation]]\n* Improve [[Reliability engineering|Reliability concerns]] of maintenance and assembly by reducing their probability to introduce defects\nHowever, these claims come mostly from those who have invested in developing it, implementing it or supporting it. In the absence of third-party endorsement or published scientific studies, such claims should be considered unconfirmed.\n\n==Specification structure==\nThe Simplified Technical English specification consists of two parts:\n# Writing Rules\n# Dictionary\n\n=== Writing Rules ===\nThe Writing Rules differentiate between two types of topics: procedure and description. The Writing Rules also specify restrictions on grammar and style usage.\nFor example, they require writers to:\n\n* Restrict the length of noun clusters to no more than 3 words\n* Restrict sentence length to no more than 20 words (procedural sentences) or 25 words (descriptive sentences)\n* Restrict paragraphs to no more than 6 sentences (in descriptive text)\n* Avoid slang and jargon while allowing for specific terminology\n* Make instructions as specific as possible\n* Use articles such as \"a/an\" and \"the\" wherever possible\n* Use simple verb tenses (past, present, and future)\n* Use active voice\n* Not use present participles or gerunds (unless part of a Technical Name)\n* Write sequential steps as separate sentences\n* Start a safety instruction (a warning or a caution) with a clear and simple command or condition.\n\n===Dictionary===\nThe following is an extract from a page of the ASD-STE100 Dictionary:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Keyword (Part of speech) !! Approved meaning/ALTERNATIVES !! APPROVED EXAMPLE !! Not approved\n|-\n| Acceptance (n) || ACCEPT (v) || BEFORE YOU ACCEPT THE UNIT, YOU MUST DO THE SPECIFIED TEST PROCEDURE. || Before acceptance of unit, carry out the specified test procedure.\n|-\n| ACCESS (n) || The ability to go into or near. || GET ACCESS TO THE ACCUMULATOR FOR THE NO. 1 HYDRAULIC SYSTEM. || \n|-\n| Accessible (adj) || ACCESS (n) || TURN THE COVER UNTIL YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THE JACK THAT HAVE \u201c+\u201d AND \u201c-\u201c MARKS. || Rotate the cover until the jack marked by + and - are accessible. \n|-\n| ACCIDENT (n) || An occurrence that causes injury or damage. || MAKE SURE THAT THE PINS ARE INSTALLED TO PREVENT ACCIDENTS. || \n|}\nAn explanation of the four columns:\n* Keyword (part of speech): This keyword has information on the type of word. Every permitted word in STE is only permitted as a specific word type. For example, \u201ctest\u201d is only permitted as a noun (the test) but not as a verb (to test).\n* Approved meaning/ALTERNATIVES: This contains the definition of the permitted word. In the example table, ACCESS and ACCIDENT are allowed. Rephrasing or alternatives that are not permitted are listed in small letters (acceptance and accessible).\n* APPROVED EXAMPLE: When the text is written in capital letters, then it means that the entire text conforms to STE. If the keyword shown in column 1 is not permitted, then sample sentences in column 3 are provided with the alternatives listed in column 2. \n* Not approved: Small letters in this column indicate sentences that do not conform to STE. Column 4 will remain empty in the case of words that do conform to STE.\n\nThe dictionary includes entries of both approved and unapproved words.  The approved words can only be used according to their specified meaning. For example, the word \"close\" can only be used in one of two meanings:\n\n# To move together, or to move to a position that stops or prevents materials from going in or out\n# To operate a circuit breaker to make an electrical circuit\n\nThe verb can express ''close a door'' or ''close a circuit'', but cannot be used in other senses (for example ''to close the meeting'' or ''to close a business'').  The adjective \"close\" appears in the Dictionary as an unapproved word with the suggested approved alternative \"near\". So STE does not allow ''do not go close to the landing gear'', but it does allow ''do not go near the landing gear''. In addition to basic STE vocabulary listed in the Dictionary, Section 1, ''Words'', gives explicit guidelines for adding technical names and technical verbs that writers need to describe technical information.  For example, words or phrases such as ''overhead panel'', ''grease'', ''propeller'', ''to ream'', and ''to drill'' are not listed in the Dictionary, but qualify as approved terms under the guidelines in Part 1, Section 1 (specifically, Writing Rules 1.5 and 1.12).\n\n==Aerospace and defense standard==\n''Simplified English'' is sometimes used as a generic term for a [[controlled language]].  The aerospace and defense specification started as an industry-regulated writing standard for aerospace maintenance documentation, but has become mandatory for an increasing number of military land vehicle, sea vehicle and weapons programs as well.  Although it was not intended for use as a general writing standard, it has been successfully adopted by other industries and for a wide range of document types. The US government's [[Plain English#United States|Plain English]]<ref>[http://www.plainlanguage.gov Plain Language: Improving Communications from the Federal Government to the Public<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref> lacks the strict vocabulary restrictions of the aerospace standard, but represents an attempt at a more general writing standard.\n\nThe regulated aerospace specification was formerly called ''AECMA Simplified English'', because AECMA originally created the standard in the 1980s. In 2005, AECMA was subsumed by the [[Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe]] (ASD), which renamed its specification to ''ASD Simplified Technical English'' or ''STE''. STE is defined by the specification ''ASD-STE100'', which is maintained by the Simplified Technical English Maintenance Group (STEMG).<ref>[http://www.asd-ste100.org/ Simplified Technical English Maintenance Group (STEMG)]</ref>  The specification contains a set of restrictions on the grammar and style of procedural and descriptive text.  It also contains a dictionary of approx. 875 approved general words.  Writers are given guidelines for adding technical names and technical verbs to their documentation.\n\nSTE is mandated by several commercial and military specifications that control the style and content of maintenance documentation, most notably [[S1000D|ASD S1000D]].\n\n==Tools==\nBoeing developed the Boeing Simplified English Checker (BSEC). This linguistic-based checker uses a sophisticated 350-rule English parser, which is augmented with special functions that check for violations of the Simplified Technical English specification.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hoard |first1=James E. |title=An Automated Grammar and Style Checker for Writers of Simplified English.

The aerospace and defense specification started as an industry-regulated writing standard for aerospace maintenance documentation, but has become mandatory for an increasing number of military land vehicle, sea vehicle and weapons programs as well.  Although it was not intended for use as a general writing standard, it has been successfully adopted by other industries and for a wide range of document types. The US government's [[Plain English#United States|Plain English]]<ref>[http://www.plainlanguage.gov Plain Language: Improving Communications from the Federal Government to the Public<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref> lacks the strict vocabulary restrictions of the aerospace standard, but represents an attempt at a more general writing standard.\n\nThe regulated aerospace specification was formerly called ''AECMA Simplified English'', because AECMA originally created the standard in the 1980s. In 2005, AECMA was subsumed by the [[Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe]] (ASD), which renamed its specification to ''ASD Simplified Technical English'' or ''STE''. STE is defined by the specification ''ASD-STE100'', which is maintained by the Simplified Technical English Maintenance Group (STEMG).<ref>[http://www.asd-ste100.org/ Simplified Technical English Maintenance Group (STEMG)]</ref>  The specification contains a set of restrictions on the grammar and style of procedural and descriptive text.  It also contains a dictionary of approx. 875 approved general words.  Writers are given guidelines for adding technical names and technical verbs to their documentation.\n\nSTE is mandated by several commercial and military specifications that control the style and content of maintenance documentation, most notably [[S1000D|ASD S1000D]].\n\n==Tools==\nBoeing developed the Boeing Simplified English Checker (BSEC). This linguistic-based checker uses a sophisticated 350-rule English parser, which is augmented with special functions that check for violations of the Simplified Technical English specification.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hoard |first1=James E. |title=An Automated Grammar and Style Checker for Writers of Simplified English.

He is considered the [[flying ace|ace-of-aces]] of the war, being officially credited with 80<!-- Please leave this at 80\u2014NOT 76, 84 or any other total\u2014if in doubt query it in discussion --> [[Aerial warfare|air combat]] victories.<!--in World War I - how many more times does this need to get repeated?-->\n\nOriginally a [[cavalryman]], Richthofen transferred to the Air Service in 1915, becoming one of the first members of fighter squadron ''[[Jagdstaffel 2]]'' in 1916. He quickly distinguished himself as a fighter pilot, and during 1917 became leader of [[Jagdstaffel 11|''Jasta 11'']] and then the larger fighter wing unit ''[[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War I)|Jagdgeschwader 1]]'', better known as \"The Flying Circus\" or \"Richthofen's Circus\" because of the bright colours of its aircraft, and perhaps also because of the way the unit was transferred from one area of allied air activity to another&nbsp;\u2013 moving like a travelling circus, and frequently setting up in tents on improvised airfields. By 1918, Richthofen was regarded as a national hero in Germany, and respected by his enemies.\n\nRichthofen was shot down and killed near [[Vaux-sur-Somme]] on 21 April 1918. There has been considerable discussion and debate regarding aspects of his career, especially the circumstances of his death. He remains one of the most widely known fighter pilots of all time, and has been [[The Red Baron in popular culture|the subject of many books, films and other media]].\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Name and nicknames==\nRichthofen was a ''[[Freiherr]]'' (literally \"Free Lord\"), a [[title of nobility]] often translated as \"[[baron]]\".<ref name=\"Kilduff6\">Kilduff, p. 6.</ref><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/218840/Freiherr \"Freiherr\"].

Typically, he would dive from above to attack with the advantage of the sun behind him, with other pilots of his squadron covering his rear and flanks.\n\n[[File:Lanoe Hawker.jpg|thumb|upright|Major Lanoe Hawker VC]]\nOn 23 November 1916, Richthofen shot down his most famous adversary, British ace Major [[Lanoe Hawker]] VC, described by Richthofen as \"the British Boelcke\".<ref name=\"Burrows p. 103\">Burrows 1970, p. 103.</ref> The victory came while Richthofen was flying an [[Albatros D.II]] and Hawker was flying the older [[Airco DH.2|DH.2]]. After a long dogfight, Hawker was shot in the back of the head as he attempted to escape back to his own lines.<ref name=\"McAllister 57\">McAllister 1982, p. 57.</ref> After this combat, Richthofen was convinced that he needed a fighter aircraft with more agility, even with a loss of speed. He switched to the [[Albatros D.III]] in January 1917, scoring two victories before suffering an in-flight crack in the spar of the aircraft's lower wing on 24 January, and he reverted to the Albatros D.II or [[Halberstadt D.II]] for the next five weeks.\n\nRichthofen was flying his Halberstadt on 6 March in combat with [[Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.8|F.E.8s]] of [[No. 40 Squadron RAF|40 Squadron RFC]] when his aircraft was shot through the fuel tank, quite possibly by [[Edwin Benbow]], who was credited with a victory from this fight.

[[Ernst Udet]] belonged to Richthofen's group and later became [[Generaloberst]] Udet. When Lothar joined, the German high command appreciated the propaganda value of two Richthofens fighting together to defeat the enemy in the air.<ref name=\"Richthofen164-165\">Richthofen, The Red Knight of the Air, (n.d.) pp. 164\u2013165.</ref>\n\nRichthofen took the flamboyant step of having his Albatros painted red when he became a squadron commander. His autobiography states, \"For whatever reasons, one fine day I came upon the idea of having my crate painted glaring red. The result was that absolutely everyone could not help but notice my red bird. In fact, my opponents also seemed to be not entirely unaware [of it]\".<ref name=\"Richthofen120\">Der rote Kampfflieger, open.cit., (n.d.) p. 120.</ref> Thereafter he usually flew in red-painted aircraft, although not all of them were entirely red, nor was the \"red\" necessarily the brilliant scarlet beloved of model- and replica-builders.\n\nOther members of ''Jasta 11'' soon took to painting parts of their aircraft red. Their official reason seems to have been to make their leader less conspicuous, to avoid having him singled out in a fight. In practice, red colouration became a unit identification. Other units soon adopted their own squadron colours, and [[Jagdstaffel#Personal colour schemes|decoration of fighters]] became general throughout the ''Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte''. The German high command permitted this practice (in spite of obvious drawbacks from the point of view of intelligence), and German propaganda made much of it by referring to Richthofen as ''Der Rote Kampfflieger''\u2014\"the Red Fighter Pilot.\"\n\n[[File:Thomsen, von Richthofen and von Hoeppner.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Richthofen (center) with [[Hermann von der Lieth-Thomsen|Hermann Thomsen]], German Air Service Chief of Staff (left) and [[Ernst von Hoeppner]], Commanding General of the Air Service (right) at Imperial Headquarters in Bad Kreuznach]]\n\nRichthofen led his new unit to unparalleled success, peaking during \"[[Bloody April]]\" 1917. In that month alone, he shot down 22 British aircraft, including four in a single day,<ref name=\"McAllister 59\">McAllister 1982, p. 59.</ref> raising his official tally to 52. By June, he had become the commander of the first of the new larger \"fighter wing\" formations; these were highly mobile, combined tactical units that could move at short notice to different parts of the front as required. Richthofen's new command, [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War I)|Jagdgeschwader 1]], was composed of fighter squadrons No. 4, 6, 10, and 11.  J.G. 1 became widely known as \"The Flying Circus\" due to the unit's brightly coloured aircraft and its mobility, including the use of tents, trains, and caravans, where appropriate.\n\nRichthofen was a brilliant tactician, building on Boelcke's tactics. Unlike Boelcke, however, he led by example and force of will rather than by inspiration. He was often described as distant, unemotional, and rather humorless, though some colleagues contended otherwise.<ref>Bodenschatz 1998</ref> He taught his pilots the basic rule which he wanted them to fight by: \"Aim for the man and don't miss him. If you are fighting a two-seater, get the observer first; until you have silenced the gun, don't bother about the pilot.\"<ref name=\"McAllister 61\">McAllister 1982, p. 61.</ref>\n\nAlthough Richthofen was now performing the duties of a lieutenant colonel (a wing commander in modern [[Royal Air Force]] terms), he was never promoted past the relatively junior rank of [[Rittmeister]], equivalent to [[Captain (armed forces)|captain]] in the British army.<ref>https://www.upi.com/Archives/1918/04/21/Germanys-Red-Baron-dies/7371524069657/</ref> The system in the British army was for an officer to hold the rank appropriate to his level of command, if only on a temporary basis, even if he had not been formally promoted. In the German army, it was not unusual for a wartime officer to hold a lower rank than his duties implied; German officers were promoted according to a schedule and not by battlefield promotion. It was also the custom for a son not to hold a higher rank than his father, and Richthofen's father was a reserve major.\n\n===Wounded in combat===\n[[File:DVa2.jpg|thumb|right|Richthofen's Albatros D.V after forced landing near [[Wervik]].

This was supported by a 2004 paper by researchers at the [[University of Texas-Austin|University of Texas]]. Richthofen's behaviour after his injury was noted as consistent with [[Traumatic brain injury|brain-injured]] patients, and such an injury could account for his perceived lack of judgement on his final flight: flying too low over enemy territory and suffering [[target fixation]].<ref name=\"lancet\">Allmers, Dr. Henning.

He is considered the [[flying ace|ace-of-aces]] of the war, being officially credited with 80<!-- Please leave this at 80\u2014NOT 76, 84 or any other total\u2014if in doubt query it in discussion --> [[Aerial warfare|air combat]] victories.<!--in World War I - how many more times does this need to get repeated?-->\n\nOriginally a [[cavalryman]], Richthofen transferred to the Air Service in 1915, becoming one of the first members of fighter squadron ''[[Jagdstaffel 2]]'' in 1916. He quickly distinguished himself as a fighter pilot, and during 1917 became leader of [[Jagdstaffel 11|''Jasta 11'']] and then the larger fighter wing unit ''[[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War I)|Jagdgeschwader 1]]'', better known as \"The Flying Circus\" or \"Richthofen's Circus\" because of the bright colours of its aircraft, and perhaps also because of the way the unit was transferred from one area of allied air activity to another&nbsp;\u2013 moving like a travelling circus, and frequently setting up in tents on improvised airfields. By 1918, Richthofen was regarded as a national hero in Germany, and respected by his enemies.\n\nRichthofen was shot down and killed near [[Vaux-sur-Somme]] on 21 April 1918. There has been considerable discussion and debate regarding aspects of his career, especially the circumstances of his death. He remains one of the most widely known fighter pilots of all time, and has been [[The Red Baron in popular culture|the subject of many books, films and other media]].\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Name and nicknames==\nRichthofen was a ''[[Freiherr]]'' (literally \"Free Lord\"), a [[title of nobility]] often translated as \"[[baron]]\".<ref name=\"Kilduff6\">Kilduff, p. 6.</ref><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/218840/Freiherr \"Freiherr\"].

[[Ernst Udet]] belonged to Richthofen's group and later became [[Generaloberst]] Udet. When Lothar joined, the German high command appreciated the propaganda value of two Richthofens fighting together to defeat the enemy in the air.<ref name=\"Richthofen164-165\">Richthofen, The Red Knight of the Air, (n.d.) pp. 164\u2013165.</ref>\n\nRichthofen took the flamboyant step of having his Albatros painted red when he became a squadron commander. His autobiography states, \"For whatever reasons, one fine day I came upon the idea of having my crate painted glaring red. The result was that absolutely everyone could not help but notice my red bird. In fact, my opponents also seemed to be not entirely unaware [of it]\".<ref name=\"Richthofen120\">Der rote Kampfflieger, open.cit., (n.d.) p. 120.</ref> Thereafter he usually flew in red-painted aircraft, although not all of them were entirely red, nor was the \"red\" necessarily the brilliant scarlet beloved of model- and replica-builders.\n\nOther members of ''Jasta 11'' soon took to painting parts of their aircraft red. Their official reason seems to have been to make their leader less conspicuous, to avoid having him singled out in a fight. In practice, red colouration became a unit identification. Other units soon adopted their own squadron colours, and [[Jagdstaffel#Personal colour schemes|decoration of fighters]] became general throughout the ''Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte''. The German high command permitted this practice (in spite of obvious drawbacks from the point of view of intelligence), and German propaganda made much of it by referring to Richthofen as ''Der Rote Kampfflieger''\u2014\"the Red Fighter Pilot.\"\n\n[[File:Thomsen, von Richthofen and von Hoeppner.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Richthofen (center) with [[Hermann von der Lieth-Thomsen|Hermann Thomsen]], German Air Service Chief of Staff (left) and [[Ernst von Hoeppner]], Commanding General of the Air Service (right) at Imperial Headquarters in Bad Kreuznach]]\n\nRichthofen led his new unit to unparalleled success, peaking during \"[[Bloody April]]\" 1917. In that month alone, he shot down 22 British aircraft, including four in a single day,<ref name=\"McAllister 59\">McAllister 1982, p. 59.</ref> raising his official tally to 52. By June, he had become the commander of the first of the new larger \"fighter wing\" formations; these were highly mobile, combined tactical units that could move at short notice to different parts of the front as required. Richthofen's new command, [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War I)|Jagdgeschwader 1]], was composed of fighter squadrons No. 4, 6, 10, and 11.  J.G. 1 became widely known as \"The Flying Circus\" due to the unit's brightly coloured aircraft and its mobility, including the use of tents, trains, and caravans, where appropriate.\n\nRichthofen was a brilliant tactician, building on Boelcke's tactics. Unlike Boelcke, however, he led by example and force of will rather than by inspiration. He was often described as distant, unemotional, and rather humorless, though some colleagues contended otherwise.<ref>Bodenschatz 1998</ref> He taught his pilots the basic rule which he wanted them to fight by: \"Aim for the man and don't miss him. If you are fighting a two-seater, get the observer first; until you have silenced the gun, don't bother about the pilot.\"<ref name=\"McAllister 61\">McAllister 1982, p. 61.</ref>\n\nAlthough Richthofen was now performing the duties of a lieutenant colonel (a wing commander in modern [[Royal Air Force]] terms), he was never promoted past the relatively junior rank of [[Rittmeister]], equivalent to [[Captain (armed forces)|captain]] in the British army.<ref>https://www.upi.com/Archives/1918/04/21/Germanys-Red-Baron-dies/7371524069657/</ref> The system in the British army was for an officer to hold the rank appropriate to his level of command, if only on a temporary basis, even if he had not been formally promoted. In the German army, it was not unusual for a wartime officer to hold a lower rank than his duties implied; German officers were promoted according to a schedule and not by battlefield promotion. It was also the custom for a son not to hold a higher rank than his father, and Richthofen's father was a reserve major.\n\n===Wounded in combat===\n[[File:DVa2.jpg|thumb|right|Richthofen's Albatros D.V after forced landing near [[Wervik]].

Written on the instructions of the \"Press and Intelligence\" ([[War propaganda|propaganda]]) section of the ''Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte'' (Air Force), it shows evidence of having been heavily [[Censorship#State secrets and prevention of attention|censored]] and edited.<ref>Burrows 1970, pp. 162\u2013163.</ref> There are, however, passages that are most unlikely to have been inserted by an official editor. Richthofen wrote: \"My father discriminates between a sportsman and a butcher. The latter shoots for fun. When I have shot down an Englishman, my hunting passion is satisfied for a quarter of a hour. Therefore I do not succeed in shooting down two Englishmen in succession. If one of them comes down, I have the feeling of complete satisfaction. Only much later have I overcome my instinct and have become a butcher\".<ref>Richthofen 2008, p.177</ref> In another passage, Richthofen wrote \"I am in wretched spirits after every aerial combat. I believe that [the war] is not as the people at home imagine it, with a hurrah and a roar; it is very serious, very grim.\"  An English translation by J. Ellis Barker was published in 1918 as ''The Red Battle Flyer''.<ref name=\"Der rote Kampfflieger\"/> Although Richthofen died before a revised version could be prepared, he is on record as repudiating the book, stating that it was \"too insolent\" and that he was no longer that kind of person.<ref name=\"WTJ\">Johnson, Karl (Contributing Editor for WTJ).

This was supported by a 2004 paper by researchers at the [[University of Texas-Austin|University of Texas]].

This was considerably faster than normal and he could easily have strayed over enemy lines without realizing it.<ref name=\"Franks and Bennett 1997\"/>\n\nAt the time of Richthofen's death, the front was in a highly fluid state, following the initial success of the [[Spring Offensive|German offensive of March\u2013April 1918]]. This was part of Germany's last opportunity to win the war. In the face of Allied air superiority, the German air service was having difficulty acquiring vital reconnaissance information, and could do little to prevent Allied squadrons from completing effective reconnaissance and close support of their armies.\n\n==Burial==\n[[File:Richthofen funeral.jpg|thumb|[[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No. 3 Squadron AFC]] officers were pallbearers and other ranks from the squadron acted as a guard of honour during the Red Baron's funeral on 22 April 1918.]]\n\nIn common with most Allied air officers, Major Blake, who was responsible for Richthofen's body, regarded the Red Baron with great respect, and he organised a full [[military funeral]], to be conducted by the personnel of No. 3 Squadron Australian Flying Corps.\n\nThe body was buried in the cemetery at the village of [[Bertangles]], near [[Amiens]], on 22 April 1918.

Some claimed that he took credit for aircraft downed by his squadron or wing.\n\nIn fact, Richthofen's victories are unusually well documented.

A study conducted by British historian [[Norman Franks]] with two colleagues, published in ''Under the Guns of the Red Baron'' in 1998, reached the same conclusion about the high degree of accuracy of Richthofen's claimed victories. There were also unconfirmed victories that would put his actual total as high as 100 or more.<ref name=\"Franks and Bailey 1992\">Franks and Bailey 1992</ref>\n\nFor comparison, the highest-scoring Allied ace, the Frenchman [[Ren\u00e9 Fonck (aviator)|Ren\u00e9 Fonck]], achieved 75 confirmed victories<ref>Ordre de la IVe Arm\u00e9e, n\u00b01599, 23 January 1919</ref> and a further 52 unconfirmed behind enemy lines.<ref name=\"Franks and Bailey 1992\"/> The highest-scoring [[British Empire]] fighter pilots were Canadian [[Billy Bishop]], who was officially credited with 72 victories,<ref>\"Distinguished Flying Cross Citation\", ''London Gazette'', 3 August 1918.</ref> [[Mick Mannock]], with 61 confirmed victories,<ref>[http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/england/mannock.php \"Mannock\".] ''The Aerodrome.com''.

Sydney]] local government area of [[New South Wales]], Australia. The station is the largest and busiest railway station in New South Wales and serves as a major [[transport interchange]] for [[NSW TrainLink]] [[inter-city rail]] services, [[Sydney Trains]] [[commuter rail]] services, [[Light rail in Sydney|Sydney light rail]] services, [[State Transit Authority|State Transit]] bus services, and private coach transport services. Often abbreviated as '''Central''' or '''Central station''', the station is also known as '''Sydney Terminal''' (especially the older, intercity section). The property is owned by [[RailCorp]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-1255>{{cite NSW SHR|5012230|Sydney Terminal and Central Railway Stations Group|hr=01255|fn=EF14/19868; 09/3179|accessdate=13 October 2018}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License].</ref> It recorded 85.4&nbsp;million passenger movements in 2018.\n\nCentral station occupies a large city block separating {{NSWcity|Haymarket}}, {{NSWcity|Surry Hills}}, and the central business district, bounded by [[Railway Square]] and [[Pitt Street]] in the west, [[Eddy Avenue]] in the north, [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney|Elizabeth Street]] in the east and the [[Devonshire Street Tunnel]] in the south. Parts of the station and [[marshalling yard]]s extend as far south as [[Cleveland Street, Sydney|Cleveland Street]], and are located on the site of the former [[Devonshire Street Cemetery]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Devonshire Street Cemetery, Sydney (2742078059).jpg|thumb|left|Central station was built on land previously occupied by the Devonshire Street Cemetery.]]\n[[File:Laying the foundation stone, Central Station 1903 (5207836628).jpg|thumb|left|Laying the foundation stone in 1903]]\n\n=== First Sydney terminal ===\nThere have been three terminal stations in Sydney.\n\nThe railway arrived in New South Wales in 1831. Proposals began in the 1840s for a railway linking the two major centres of [[Sydney]] and [[Parramatta]], with an eastern terminus close to the Sydney city centre.\n\nAlthough the Sydney Railway Company first applied to the government for four blocks of land between Hay and [[Cleveland Street, Sydney|Cleveland]] Streets in 1849, the [[Surveyor General of New South Wales|Surveyor General]] favoured Grose Farm, now the grounds of [[the University of Sydney]]. It was further from the city and less costly to develop. The Company finally exchanged land in the first, second and third blocks, between Hay and Devonshire Streets, for an increased area of {{convert|20|acre|ha|0|order=flip|spell=on}} in the fourth block, the Government Paddocks, between Devonshire and Cleveland Streets. Hence the site of the first Sydney railway terminus was located here from 1855.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe original Sydney station was opened on 26 September 1855 in an area known as Cleveland Fields. It was a temporary timber and corrugated iron building, constructed rapidly in late August to early September 1855, in time for the opening of the line to Parramatta for passenger trains.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThis station (one wooden platform in a corrugated iron shed), called Sydney Terminal, had Devonshire Street as its northern boundary.<ref name=\"central history\">{{cite web |url=http://sydneytrains.info/about/history/central_station_in-depth |title=Central Station - in-depth history |work=[[Sydney Trains]] |publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]] |date= |access-date=3 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810221634/http://sydneytrains.info/about/history/central_station_in-depth |archive-date=10 August 2013 }}</ref> It was frequently but unofficially called Redfern station,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://gallery.records.nsw.gov.au/index.php/galleries/through-the-lens-central-railway-station/|title=Central Railway Station, Sydney - Gallery - State Records NSW|work=State Records NSW - Digital Gallery|access-date=2017-04-13|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903200748/http://gallery.records.nsw.gov.au/index.php/galleries/through-the-lens-central-railway-station/|archive-date=3 September 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> while at that time the present [[Redfern railway station|Redfern station]] was officially called Eveleigh.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dictionaryofsydney.org/map/76629|title=Atlas of the Suburbs of Sydney - Redfern 1886-1888|website=dictionaryofsydney.org|access-date=2017-04-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170413235033/http://dictionaryofsydney.org/map/76629|archive-date=13 April 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Although called \"Redfern Station\", the first and second Sydney Terminals were never actually located in Redfern, being to the north of Cleveland Street which is Redfern's northern boundary.\n\nThe first and second station buildings were both in the form of a shed which covered the main line. A photograph of the exterior of the first station taken in 1871 shows vertical boarding, windows with a hood and a corrugated iron roof, with a roof vent. Internally the stud framing and timber truss roof members were exposed. The offices and public facilities were contained in the adjacent lean-to, which faced George Street. Only one platform and the main up-line served the passenger station. A similar platform and line layout was used for the Mortuary Station, constructed 15 years later; however, the level of detail and materials varied considerably.<ref name=nswshr-1255/> The first station building was extended almost immediately, a shed being constructed at the southern end to cover an additional {{convert|100|ft|m|0|order=flip}} of platform.\n\n===Second Sydney Terminal===\nWhen this station became inadequate for the traffic it carried, a new station was built in 1874 on the same site and was also called Sydney Terminal.\n\nThe Second Sydney Terminal was a more substantial brick station building, initially with two platforms. The second station building was constructed on the site of the first station, the main hall spanning the up and down mainlines. Separate platforms and facilities were provided for arriving and departing passengers. The new station building appears to have taken three years to complete: the drawings are dated 1871, while the official opening was in 1874. The second station, like the first, was constructed to allow for a future extension of the line into the city, the lines initially extending just far enough past the building to accommodate a steam locomotive.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nJohn Whitton, the Engineer-in-Chief, designed a neo-classical station building to be constructed of brick, with the decorative detail formed using polychromatic and relief work. Almost immediately the demand for platform space during peak times resulted in additional branch lines and platforms being constructed adjacent to the passenger station. These lines were brought in front of the station, obscuring it from view and isolating the verandah. By 1890 Whitton's station building had become engulfed within a sea of sheds and tram platform canopies. The second Redfern station, demolished following the completion of the first stage of the main terminal building {{circa|1906}}, was a gloomy building, the glass in the roof lantern not permitting a great deal of light to enter and the soot from the steam locomotives coating the surfaces with grime.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe second station grew to 14 platforms before it was replaced by the present-day station to the north of Devonshire Street.\n\n===Proposals for extension into the city===\nIn major metropolitan areas the rail terminus tended to be located within the inner core of the city. The site of the first and second station termini was inconveniently located for the city. Initially, a horse-bus service operated from the station to the city, and both Engineer-in-Chief, [[John Whitton]], and Chief Commissioner for Railways, B. H. Martindale, recognised the urgency of a city rail extension.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nIn 1877 John [[Young, New South Wales|Young]], a prominent Sydney builder and local politician, proposed a scheme to provide a circular city extension to the railway. The route included stations at [[Oxford Street, Sydney|Oxford Street]], [[William Street, Sydney|William Street]] and [[Woolloomooloo]] in the east, [[Circular Quay]], then [[Dawes Point, New South Wales|Dawes Point]] and a line parallel to [[Darling Harbour]] in the west. John Whitton designed a grand city terminus at the corner of Hunter and [[Castlereagh Street]]s two years later. Neither of these schemes eventuated.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nIn 1895 the Parliamentary Standing Committee on [[NSW Public Works|Public Works]] advised that a Royal Commission should be constituted to \"inquire into the question of bringing the railway from its present terminus at Redfern into the city\". The findings of the Commission, favouring a site in St James Road, were released in 1897. The term Central Station was now in common use. The public Works Annual report of 1896-7 noted that \"the Railway Construction Branch was called upon to furnish voluminous plans and estimates of the cost of the various proposals brought before the commission. After a most exhaustive investigation, the Royal Commission reported, almost unanimously, in favour of the extension of the railway into the city by the route and according to the plan as described as the St James Road Scheme\".<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nIn 1897 [[Norman Selfe]] drew up a scheme for the gradual enlargement and extension of the railway to the northern end of the city and in the same year Railway Commissioner, E. M. G. Eddy, proposed a terminal city station at the corner of [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney|Elizabeth Street]] and St James' Road. The route of the latter was virtually the same as that for 1879, however, the new site for the terminus included half of the northern end of [[Hyde Park, Sydney|Hyde Park]]. Although {{convert|16|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} of the burial ground in Devonshire Street was offered as compensation, public sentiment still opposed the loss of Hyde Park.\n\nThe initial designs for a near Sydney Terminal were prepared by Henry Deane, the Engineer-in-Chief of Railway Construction in consultation with the Railway Commissioners. Mr Deane is reputed to have prepared ten schemes for the Royal Commission. Although the St James location was preferred, a scheme that did not involve the disturbance of or use of land in Hyde Park was sought. The extension of [[Belmore Park]] was initially proposed in the 1897 scheme as compensation for the use of the northwestern corner of Hyde Park as a railway station. Following a change of government the St James scheme was abandoned and Henry Deane prepared, {{circa|1899}}, a further two schemes, one of which was for the Old Burial Ground Site.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe Royal Commission in 1897 again considered the city railway extension because of dangerous congestion at Redfern and recommended using Hyde Park. Then, after an investigative trip overseas, Henry Deane prepared alternative proposals for a new railway terminal for the government in 1900. The second scheme proposal called for the resumption of the Devonshire Street cemeteries, but this was cheaper and less contentious than the acquisition of Hyde Park. It was the second scheme which was eventually adopted.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe earlier schemes to extend the lines further into the city would have been prohibitively expensive and would have required large scale resumptions. The site of the Old Burial ground was, in comparison, relatively easily obtainable as no private land was involved. Due to the extent of the resumption there would, in addition to a terminus, be room for the extension of the goods yard and the erection of a carriage shed and post office. The existing lines were at a higher level than the Burial Ground, so rather than lowering the existing railway track, the tramlines were to be raised to serve a high level station. The Public Works Committee passed the design on 7 June 1900, however, a much modified building was actually constructed.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe total estimated cost of the works was to be {{Australian pound|561,000}} with the General Works estimated at {{Australian pound|138,000}}, the Station Building estimated at {{Australian pound|233,000}} and the Resumptions estimated at {{Australian pound|140,000}}. Almost immediately these estimates proved conservative, there was much public concern regarding the removal of bodies from the Old Burial ground and a new cemetery, the [[Botany, New South Wales|Botany]] Cemetery, had to be constructed, at public expense, at [[La Perouse, New South Wales|La Perouse]].<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\n===Third Sydney Terminal (Central station)===\nWhen the third station was built in 1906, it moved one block north, closer to the city. It fronted Garden Road, which was realigned to form Eddy Avenue. If [[Belmore Park]] is included, all the land now occupied by the railway at Central and Redfern coincides with the Company's original selection of four blocks between Hay and Cleveland Streets.<ref name=nswshr-1255/> The present station was officially opened on 4 August 1906 and opening for passengers on 5 August 1906.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article28160131? |title=The New Central Station |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=6 August 1906 |page=6 |access-date= |publisher=Trove, [[National Library of Australia]] }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Central Station, 1924 (4010230424).jpg|thumb|Western end of the colonnade and tram stop, with the [[porte-coch\u00e8re]] in the background, 1924]]\nDuring [[Lachlan Macquarie|Governor Macquarie]]'s term, the future site of the Sydney Terminal was beyond the limits of settlement, which were marked by the tollhouse located at the end of [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]] and at the entrance to [[Railway Square]].<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nCentral station was designed by the Government Architect, [[Walter Liberty Vernon]]. The new station was built on a site previously occupied by the [[Devonshire Street Cemetery]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weekendnotes.com/central-railway-station-sydney/|title=Sydney's Central Station - Now and Then Photos - Sydney|publisher=Weekend Notes|access-date=4 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327221417/http://www.weekendnotes.com/central-railway-station-sydney/|archive-date=27 March 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> South Sydney Morgue, the Convent of the Good Samaritan, the Sydney Female Refuge, police barracks and superintendent's residence (on Pitt Street), Christ Church Parsonage, the Benevolent Asylum (fronting Railway Square), a steam train depot (ad the corner of [[Pitt Street]] with Garden Road), as well as some residential properties on Railway Place.<ref name=nswshr-1255/> The convent, female refuge and police barracks were all original part of \"Carters Barracks\", built in 1819 to house convict gangs working as carters on the brick fields. The adjacent field which is today [[Belmore Park]] was known as the \"police paddock\", after the police barracks.\n\nThe remains exhumed from the cemetery were re-interred at several other Sydney cemeteries including [[Rookwood Cemetery|Rookwood]] and [[Waverley Cemetery|Waverley]] cemeteries. Bodies were moved to [[Botany, New South Wales|Botany]] by steam tram motors and flat cars.<ref name=\"central history\"/>\n\nMr E. O'Sullivan, the Minister for Works, in 1901 established the [Central] Station Advisory Board, comprising railway experts to  \"investigate the question of the design and arrangements of the station\".  The members included [[Walter Liberty Vernon]], both of the chief engineers of the NSW railway (for railway construction and existing lines respectively), and the chief engineers of the Queensland and Victorian railways.<ref name=nswshr-1255/> The committee also considered a suitable design for the new [[Flinders Street railway station|Flinders Street station]] in [[Melbourne]]. The design for the Sydney Terminus was to be a collaboration between the architect and the railway engineers.  The layout was largely determined by the planning requirements of the railway engineers, to which an appropriate architectural style was overlaid. However, the initial scheme did not contain the required accommodation and an enlargement of the building was approved by the Minister.  The cost estimate was now {{Australian pound|610,000}}. The Board were to fulfil the wishes of the Minister that \"the building should be a monumental work of stateliness and beauty\".\n\nAn early proposal for the new terminus, and the changes to the surrounding area, were reported in the ''Sydney Mail'' in 1901:<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\n{{blockquote|\"One of the reforms to be incidentally effected will be the widening of Pitt Street near the railway to 100ft.  The width will secured by taking in land on the right already resumed or in Government hands, and including the Benevolent Asylum grounds, the convent along the northern side of Pitt Street where it debouches upon George Street.  The result will be a fine, broad thoroughfare, tree bordered to form the entrance to the city...  ...Mr O'Sullivan is also conferring with Mr S Horden to see if an arrangement can be made for the purpose of widening Gipps Street, at present a narrow thoroughfare before any new buildings are erected.  By planting these broad streets on each side with trees, Mr O'Sullivan contends that a magnificent entrance to the city will be established and the trees will set off the new station. He considers that this opportunity for the improvement and ornamentation of Sydney should not be lost, especially as it will not entail a very heavy cost upon the tax payer, most of the land utilised already being the property of the crown. There will be four double and four single platforms, or practically twelve single platforms in all... Between the end of the docks and the main buildings is the assembly platform, 70ft wide.  On the platform level will be booking offices, waiting rooms, cloak and luggage offices, lavatories, convenient refreshment rooms, dining rooms, etc.  The basement will be devoted to kitchens, stores, baggage rooms, offices for minor officials, and a dining room for the Railway Commissioners and their staffs, including the clerical, professional, traffic and audit branches. The railway is to cross Devonshire Street, which as a street for heavy traffic will cease to exist.  It will be lowered and modified, to suite pedestrian, cab and light traffic only, with a width of 50ft.  The heavy traffic hitherto taken over Devonshire Street will be diverted along Belmore Road and a new street which is to be made on the east side of the station. Cabs will enter the station from Devonshire Street.  The exit for cabs will lead into Pitt Street by an inclined ramp and subway, thus avoiding any crossing on the level of the path of either pedestrians or tramcars. The main approach to the station will be opposite the intersection of George and Pitt Street, and foot passengers, and cabs and other vehicles will enter here.  Departure for vehicles will be effected by means of a ramp, descending from the north west corner of the building to Belmore Road. A subway for pedestrians to enter the building is to be provided from a point in Pitt Street, nearly opposite the north western corner of the building.  The tramway approaches have been so designed as to take them completely clear of all other classes of traffic and congestion, and interference and risk of injury will be altogether obviated. It is intended that the railway traffic should run as now arranged over the Castlereagh and Pitt Street route, but, instead of approaching the station on the ground level, the two lines begin to rise from a point in Belmore Park on a grade of 1 in 20, where they will terminate with a wide colonnade of (sic) platform level.\"}}\n\nThis design, with pavilions and a mansard roof, was strongly influenced by French Renaissance chateaux. The scale of the building, arrangement of the approaches and viaducts, the ground level colonnade and the position of the clocktower are all similar to the subsequent scheme, which was actually constructed.\n\nBy June 1901 work had begun on forming the site of the new station at Devonshire Street, the PWD Annual Report for 1900/01 noting that \"a great deal of preliminary work has had to be done in the preparation of the site for the new station and the extension of the railway, owing to the necessity of removing the bodies from the old cemetery and providing a new cemetery to receive the remains, as well as the demolition of the buildings and disposal of the material.  The work of clearing and levelling is now well in hand.\"  \"Private removals were commenced on the 29th of February 1901 and at the end of the year 1,145 bodies had been removed.\"  Families could remove the remains to a cemetery of their choosing, however, the majority of bodies removed were relocated, at government expense, to the new cemetery at La Perouse.  The Belmore Park to Fort Macquarie Electric Tramway was also constructed in 1900-1.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe earlier brick and sandstone design, with a mansard roof, was abandoned in favour of an all sandstone terminus building which largely incorporated the same passenger, tram and vehicle separation as the earlier scheme.  During 1899 a Parliamentary Standing Committee had debated whether the major public buildings should be constructed of brick with a sandstone trim or all sandstone.  This committee determined that, for major public buildings, sandstone should be used.\n\nTwo designs, by members of the Government Architects Branch, were submitted for the fa\u00e7ades in October 1901 to the Minister for Public Works and to the Railway Commissioners with the accompanying comment by the \"Board of Experts\" advising on the design of Central Station \"we are of the opinion that either one or the other of the architectural designs which accompany this report may with confidence be adopted\". Of the two fa\u00e7ade options, that of Gorrie McLeish Blair was reputedly selected. The 1901/02 Annual Report describes the progress a year later, \"''work has progressed vigorously during the year.  All the old buildings and human remains have been removed from the site and the foundation stone was laid at the corner of Pitt-street and the New Belmore road on the 30th April.  The information of New-Street, 2  chains in width, the extension of Castlereagh-street and the widening of Hay and Elizabeth Streets is well forward. The levelling of the whole site is practically finished, and great improvements have been made to Belmore and Prince Alfred Parks by filling in with the spoil excavated for the foundations''\".<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nA more detailed account is given of the excavation: \"the excavation to the docks and main building containing some 80,000 cubic yards, has been taken out and the material removed to Belmore Park, where it forms the tramway embankments and raises the general level of the park.  About 30,000 cubic yards of material from the Castlereagh-street cutting have been utilised in improving the level of Prince Alfred Park.\"<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nIn early 1902 the design of the terminus building was changed yet again, at the request of the \"Board of Experts\" advising on the design of Central.  \"...the station building has been increased in height by one storey, and considerably in length of front, and an east wing added.  A tower also of fine proportions has been included.  The completed building consequently shows a much larger building than originally proposed, but it is thought in the future it will come into use.  In the meantime, certain parts can be left out and added afterwards, but in spite of all such reduction the estimated cost of the new building and the main rood will amount to about {{Australian pound|400,000}} as compared with {{Australian pound|230,000}}\".<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nAs it was being built, it was reported that \"Everything in connection with the new station appears to have been designed on a grand scale, from the great elevated approaches down to the system of handling luggage underground.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article14790534 |title=New Railway Station.

This street will be continued to George Street and made 100ft wide. Steps are being taken to widen Pitt Street and make it 100ft wide. Hay Street and Elizabeth Street, where skirting the park, have been widened by the abolition of the pathway running alongside the park and the utilisation of the avenue in the park for the purpose.  A new street, 100ft wide on the East side of the station ground connects Elizabeth Street at the junction of Foveaux and [[Castlereagh Street]], Redfern. An inclined approach, including a width of forth feet for cabs, twenty feet for pedestrians and a sufficient width for the tramway runs parallel to Pitt Street, between Hay Street and the Station.  The return tramway descent...is made on the east side of the station.  These inclined approaches will have flat earthware slopes towards the park which will be ornamentally planted. At the southern end of the station, Devonshire Street, where it passes through traffic or skirts the railway property, will be closed to all but pedestrian traffic, the latter being accommodated by a subway. With regards to the Tramways, the Castlereagh and Pitt Street lines will be brought up by inclines to the platform level of the station...  The tramway running through Belmore Park has now been abolished and deviated via Elizabeth Street and the road in front of the station... ...From the north or City end, access to the station for pedestrians will be by a footpath twenty feet wide, starting from Hay Street and rising up with a one in sixteen grade to the colonnade in front of the main building.  From the west access will be obtained by a passenger subway fifteen feet wide opposite the new street, between George and Pitt Streets, with a one in twelve grade to platform level. A striking peculiarity and advantage in the arrangements of this station is that there are separate approaches for pedestrians, road traffic and tramways, so that there will be none of the clashing and danger incident on the present arrangement between George Street and the existing station.\"}}\n\nThe general design of the new station was also discussed:<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n{{blockquote|\"A great amount of attention was devoted to the treatment of the front and west sides, and there is an additional of a wing on the east side.  The tower, which will be situated near the north west corner of the station will be a commanding feature, and will be provided with a clock which will be visible from most parts of the city. It is expected that the whole will produce an imposing architectural effect.  The space enclosed between the wings of the building, and which is covered by the main roof, includes the assembly platform, 72 ft wide, five docks with three roads each and intervening platforms.  Outside the building, on the east side, some lines will be laid which can eventually be extended into the city should that work be authorised by [[Parliament of New South Wales|Parliament]].\n\nIt is intended that the accommodation for the public shall be specially commodious. It will be of a character that will not only be suitable and sufficient for many years to come, but it has been architecturally designed so as to be an object of admiration to visitors. A special feature of the Central Station design is its assembly platform (or one might say assembly platforms) because for the passengers leaving by train there is wide covered space to the north of the building, which to a certain extent serves the same purpose as the larger one, situated between the two wings of the building.  This latter is 348 ft long and 72 ft wide.  Although it has an analogue in space in front of the station at Redfern (Devonshire St) where arrivals from Sydney congregate, it differs in important respects from that one. Although a busy place, it will not be subject in the same way to the rush of arrivals and departures, and those using it will not only be better protected from the weather, from the hot and cold blasts and the damp that afflict the passengers at Redfern (Devonshire St), but they will have better opportunities for considering their whereabouts and looking up the traffic directions than they now enjoy.  Before them, in one line will be the barriers with openings leading on to the different platforms, and indicators plainly marked which can be read from a distance will show them the times and destinations of each departing train. The booking hall will, in accordance with modern practice be of a large size, namely 110 ft long by 54 ft broad by 36 ft high.  It is intended that it shall be a work of art and probably some special display of the latest style in station adornment will be found.\n\nWaiting rooms will be provided for both ladies and gentlemen and the best attention will be devoted towards giving those using them the latest and best designed lavatories and conveniences.  A barber's shop will be provided, accessible form the assembly platforms and to meet a demand that is often felt by those arriving by train and wishing to get rid of the dust of travelling, and to change their clothes so as to fit them to meet their friends or visit places of entertainment, there will be baths and dressing rooms... The refreshment buffet is nearly 60 ft long by a width of 41 ft, and will be got up in the latest style.  Adjoining is the ladies' and gentlemen's' dining and tea rooms 86 ft by 53, with separate entrances from the assembly platform, the serveries for which are in direct communication with the kitchens in the basement where every adjunct of the latest type is provided. The public telegraph and telephone offices...are situated in the west wing and are approached from the inside platform and also from the cab arrival platform on the outside.  The baggage room... is convenient to the cab arrival platform.  Two large lifts are provided in which the baggage is taken to the basement to be distributed through the subways and up the lifts to the various platforms.  On the other side of the arched opening to the platform is the cloak room...fitted up specially for the ready reception and delivery of parcels.  Lifts are provided for the reception and delivery of goods to large stores in the basement.\n\nAt the southern end of the west wing of the main building is situated the main parcels office  Here special facilities will be provided for parcels inwards and outwards; there is a separate road 40 ft wide, for inward and outward traffic, with all the necessary raised platforms, etc. Under the cab approach and departure roads, and facing Pitt Street, there will be 24 shops with colonnade in front...  There will also be nine similar shops in the basement of the main building facing the new street. On the upper floors of the building the Railway Commissioners and their officers will be accommodated. For the convenience and comfort of the staff, who are thus situated some distance from the centre of the town, a special dining-room and reading-room have been provided on the street level with access by lift and staircase from the offices above\".}}\n\nIn his lecture Henry Deane also discusses many of the technical aspects of the design including luggage handling, the lifts, the water towers, the train shed roof, which was subsequently deleted as a cost-cutting measure, the platforms and signalling. A novel method of luggage handling was designed for Central to \"get rid of the objectionable luggage-trolley, which is always frightening nervous people\".  A overhead luggage carrying system had been developed in England, however, in the case of Central station, \"the levels permit of its being carried on underground by means of subways and lifts at suitable points\".  The mail was also to be transferred by subway.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe train shed roof was to be designed to have a central span of 198&nbsp;ft with two sides spans of 78&nbsp;ft. Three pin trusses were to be employed, which where to be brought to the ground to provide intermediate support.  The roof was to be continuous.  This truss and roof configuration was to be based on that of the [[Union Station (St. Louis)|Union Station, St Louis]], visited by Deane in 1894.  Such a roof would have rivalled those of the major metropolitan termini in Europe and America. The platform area was to be double that of the earlier station and correspondingly double the number of passengers could be accommodated.  The maximum number of passengers that the Devonshire Street station could accommodate was 20,000; the new station would be able to accommodate 40,000. The location of the cab rank was also discussed, it having been decided not to incorporate a cab rank inside the building so that the new station could be \"kept entirely free from the smell, which the standing of horses under the roof must certainly involve\".<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe last train departed platform 5 of the 1874 station at midnight of 4 August 1906. During the remainder of that night, the passenger concourse was demolished and the line extended through the old station into the new station. The ''[[Western Mail (train)|Western Mail]]'' arrived at 05:50 on 5 August 1906 at the new station.<ref>{{cite book|last=Preston|first=Ronald George|year=1980|title=125 Years of the Sydney to Parramatta Railway|publisher=The New South Wales Rail Transport Museum|location=Burwood|isbn=0-909862-13-3|page=60}}</ref> Devonshire Street, which separated the two stations, became a pedestrian underpass to allow people to cross the railway line and is now known by many as the Devonshire Street Tunnel.<ref name=\"central history\"/>\n\nAn {{convert|85.6|m|ft|adj=mid|-tall}}<ref name=\"central history\"/> [[clock tower]] in the [[Australian non-residential architectural styles#Free Classical|Free Classical style]] was added at the north-western corner of the station, opening on 3 March 1921. The clock was designed by Richard Lamb and Alfred Fairfax, the co-founders of [[Fairfax & Roberts]].\n\n===Tram approaches and Belmore Park===\nOn a continuous axis with the first station building, Belmore Park originally fronted the first Hay and Corn Markets in Hay Street.  When the third station was located one block further north, it linked up with the southern side of Belmore Park.  The park then fortuitously provided a green foil to the commanding city front of the station.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nIn 1902 the Railway and Tramway Construction Branch, headed by Mr Deane, reported that \"plans and detail drawings have been prepared in the office for the whole of the retaining wall and shops in Pitt-Street, both north and south of the new road in front of the Station, also for the Devonshire-Street subway and for the whole of the basement floors, including drainage, telephone tunnels, &c.\"  At this stage, the estimated cost of the works was 561,600 pounds, however, it was \"probable that his estimate will be exceeded\".<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe necessary tramway deviations, 2 miles and 60 chains of track, were laid in 1901\u201302 using day labour.  The track consisted of rails laid on sleepers.  The curve and the poles were manufactured by local engineering firms including [[Clyde Engineering]] Co.  The Permanent Way (i.e. track) was imported either from England or America. The construction of the first stage of the station began in June 1902 and was completed in August 1906.  By 30 June 1903 the following works had been completed:<ref name=nswshr-1255-1255-1>Department of Public Works & Services, 1996, 25-28 & 39-72</ref><ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\n{{blockquote|\"....the total quantity earth removed is about 250,500 cubic yards.  This has been used to level up the station site as required.  Belmore Park has been raised to carry the tramways to the station... The Sports Grounds [[Moore Park, New South Wales|Moore Park]] (cycling ground) have been formed and the best of the clay had been disposed of to Messrs. Goodlet & Smith at their brickworks...  ...The whole of the foundations to the main buildings have been taken out and concreted.  On 21st July, 1902, the first order for building stone was given to Mr Saunders, at [[Pyrmont, New South Wales|Pyrmont]] Quarry.  On the 6th of August Inspector Murray went to Pyrmont Quarry to arrange for starting work dressing stone.  On the 7th August eleven masons started work, and on the 18th the first dressed stone was landed on the works from Pyrmont Quarry and was set in place on No. 3 Pier, arrival bridge, on the 19th August; and since that date 127,000 cubic feet have been built into place.\n\nThis stone has been used in the building of retaining wall, Pitt-street, between Hay-street and the Ambulance Depot, near Devonshire-street; the tramway arrival and departure bridges, the piers of which have been carried up to impost and girder-bed level.  Shop fronts and arcades in Pitt-street...the whole of [the] arcade with shop fronts and front wall to the main building from Pitt-street to the extreme eastern end of the building, including the east wing have been carried up to the first floor level.}}\n\nThe 1908 ''Royal Commission for the Improvement of the City of Sydney and its Suburbs'' offered two schemes which, in providing vehicular access, attempted to resolve the discrepancy in scale between Belmore Park and the station building.  The scheme presented by [[John Sulman]] consisted of two circular roadways, one above the other, around Belmore Park. The Commissioners, however, favoured a less grandiose Scheme prepared by Norman Selfe.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\n{{blockquote|\"Its main feature is the raising of Belmore Park to the level of the station platform between raised roads in the eastern half of a widened Pitt-street on the one hand and the western half of a widened Elizabeth-street on the other, with a connecting viaduct along Eddy-avenue and a retaining-wall to support the raised park along its Hay-street alignment\".}}\n\nAlthough neither scheme was attempted, Selfe's proposal is recalled in the Elizabeth Street ramp which was built in 1925 to allow the extension of an electric connection to the city.  The park, needless to say, was never raised to the height of the assembly platform.\n\n===Eastern fa\u00e7ade===\n[[File:Central Railway Station, Sydney (4750268718).jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Sydney Terminal before 1926, showing the simpler eastern section of the station. The eastern-most platforms (16-19) were replaced by the suburban through-platforms and viaduct in 1926.]]\nThe Elizabeth Street fa\u00e7ade of the Sydney Terminus has received less attention. Facing the working class terraces in [[Surry Hills, New South Wales|Surry Hills]], the eastern wing was finished in brick rather than stone when shortage of funds hurried completion of the first stage of the station in 1906. It was the obvious location for expansion when new platforms were added to the original complex to provide the electrical city and suburban connection in 1926.  The grand station building is eclipsed from view at street level by the Elizabeth Street ramp and the later semi-circular classical entrance portico to the city connection is in refined contrast to the rusticated blocks and heavy treatment of the main building.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\n===Battle of Central Station (1916)===\nA riot, dubbed the [[Liverpool riot of 1916|Battle of Central Station]], took place in 1916. Soldiers rebelling against camp conditions had raided hotels in [[Liverpool, New South Wales|Liverpool]] and travelled to the city by commandeered trains. Upon arrival at Central station, the rioters set about destroying the station facilities, and fire was exchanged between rampaging rioters and [[military police]]. One rioter was shot dead and several were injured. The only remaining evidence of the gun battle is a small bullet-hole in the marble by the entrance to platform 1.<ref>{{cite news |author=Baker, Jordan |title=The secret life of us&nbsp;\u2014 tunnel vision exposed |newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=2 August 2006}}</ref> This incident had a direct influence on the introduction of [[Six o'clock swill|6 o'clock closing]] of hotels in 1916, which lasted in New South Wales until 1955.<ref name=\"central history\"/>\n\n=== Electrification ===\nThe original proposal for electrification was for the [[North Shore railway line|North Shore line]], from [[Hornsby, New South Wales|Hornsby]] to {{NSWcity|Milsons Point}}, a separate line which could be electrified without impact on the remainder of the rail system. However, due to the necessity of building the City Underground Railway and the proposal for a [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]], not to mention the expansion of the [[Illawarra railway line|Illawarra]] and [[Bankstown railway line|Bankstown]] lines, the program was altered in order that the electrification could be linked with these proposed expansions. From Well Street, Redfern eight tracks would continue as the City Railway whilst four would carry the country trains to the Sydney Terminal. An above ground station would include a link to allow the transfer of passengers and baggage to the Sydney Terminal. This new station was constructed on the east side.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nSouth of the station buildings, additional works built to accommodate the electrification and expansion of the city and suburban lines included extensions to the [[Cleveland Street, Sydney|Cleveland Street]] Bridge and flyovers. The Devonshire Street subway and Devonshire Street wall were extended through the new suburban section. The new viaduct along Elizabeth Street included new bridges over Eddy Avenue, Campbell Street and Hay Street and a new retaining wall along Elizabeth Street.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\n=== Modernisation of Central Station ===\n[[File:Central Station milk bar, 1946 (4009463159).jpg|thumb|left|A [[milk bar]] inside Central station, {{circa|1946}}.]]\nModernisation programs were undertaken in 1955 and again in 1964. In the 1955 work, a booking hall was created (in the former refreshment room, now the railway bar). Murals depicting railway scenes lined the walls and a terrazzo map of Australia was installed on the floor. In October 1980 a modernisation program at the Sydney Terminal commenced. The objective of the work was to improve the facilities for both passenger convenience and comfort.  The start of this modernisation program coincided with the 125th Anniversary of the NSW Railways and it was at a time when many major service advances were being made to the State Rail System.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\n=== The Darling Harbour line ===\nIn addition to the construction of the main trunk line between Sydney and Parramatta in 1855, a branch line between Darling Harbour and the Sydney Yard, with a cutting and underpass to carry the line under George Street, was also constructed.  This line was to allow for the transfer of goods to be exported by ship, primarily wool bales. In the first decades of settlement goods were loaded and unloaded in [[Sydney Cove]], however, as the city expanded the wharves extended round into [[Cockle Bay (Sydney)|Cockle Bay]] (Darling Harbour). The presence of the rail link would have influenced the development of this harbour. The Darling Harbour Line was one of the first cuttings and overbridges to be constructed as part of the NSW Rail network. In contrast to later structures sandstone was used to line the walls of the underpass and to form the overbridge.  The Darling Harbour Line partially followed the line of an existing water course, the [[Blackwattle Creek]]. Subsequent alterations to the layout of Railway Square have resulted in extensions to the overbridge.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe line fell into disuse with the demise of Darling Harbour as a working harbour in the second half of the 20th century. Part of the railway, from Haymarket at Hay Street, near the [[Powerhouse Museum]] connecting to the [[Metropolitan Goods railway line]] to Lilyfield and Dulwich Hill, became part of the new light rail [[Dulwich Hill Line]]. Trams entering the city via the Dulwich Hill Line deviated from the Darling Harbour Line at Hay Street to run via surface streets to the Central station colonnade.\n\nFor a time, the remainder of the former Darling Harbour Line, from Sydney Yard to Hay Street, remained disused and functional, and was used to transfer trains to the Powerhouse Museum. Most of this section, from the Devonshire Street Tunnel to Hay Street, were converted to a pedestrianised linear park called \"[[The Goods Line]]\" in stages in 2012 and 2015.\n\nThe final part of the Darling Harbour Line, a tunnel under Railway Square, is intact but disused. There are proposals to also pedestrianise it.<ref name=\"Robertson\">{{cite news|last1=Robertson|first1=James|title=Sydney version of New York High Line to open between Central and Darling Harbour|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/a-dormant-goods-line-reconnects-sydneys-east-and-west-20150827-gj95kf.html|accessdate=11 September 2015|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=28 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== The Sydney Yard ===\nThe first Sydney railway workshop, constructed {{circa|1855}}, was a substantial two storey sandstone building with arched openings to both floors and a slate roof. A boiler, for the production of steam, was located at the southern end of the building. By 1865, a timber extension had been constructed over a section of track to allow the locomotives to be worked on under cover. A blacksmiths forge was located in an adjacent single storey building. In contrast with the first Redfern Station building (Sydney Terminal) the main workshop building was an elaborately detailed sandstone building, with a rock-faced ashlar base, quoins and sills.  The use of substantial and well-detailed sandstone buildings on the site was to continue with the construction of the twin-gabled goods shed, the Mortuary Station and finally the present station building and its approaches.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nOriginally the Sydney Yard occupied the area between the passenger station and the two storey workshop building. Initially, timber and corrugated iron sheds were built, however, these were soon replaced with more substantial masonry building.  Gable-ended locomotive and carriage workshops were built here.  Although no architectural drawings of these buildings have been located it is assumed that metal roof trusses and cast iron internal columns were used, similar to the structural system favoured in England, and later employed at [[Eveleigh, New South Wales|Eveleigh]]. Of these sheds, the most elaborate was the Second Goods Shed, built in the late 1860s.  The building was as, if not more, elaborate than many English examples.  It was unusual, even in the 19th century, for this level of decorative detail to be employed on such a utilitarian structure as a goods shed, the standard of building obviously representing the level of importance of the yard.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nExtensive facilities were required to keep the locomotives in good working order. The Sydney/Redfern yards were extended towards Elizabeth Street and the Exhibition Ground (Prince Alfred Park).  Until the construction of the railway workshops at Eveleigh in the mid-1880s the majority of the maintenance work was undertaken at the Sydney/Redfern Yard. In 1884 the yards included a gasworks ({{circa|1882}}), gas holder, a carriage works and the locomotive shop (by 1865). A turntable connected the now considerably extended main workshop building, one of the two blacksmiths shops and the repairing shed.  All of these structures have been demolished. Further towards the park, in the area now known as the Prince Alfred Sidings were located the carpenters shop, the second blacksmiths shop and an office. These buildings are the only remnants of the Sydney Yard.  Little physical evidence remains of the layout or the functioning of this once extensive railway yard as many of the structures were removed to allow for the construction of platforms 16-23 and subsequently the city electric station.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\n=== The Mortuary Station ===\n{{main|Regent Street railway station}}\n[[File:SLNSW 479607 104 Mortuary Redfern Front View SH 156.jpg|thumb|The Mortuary Station viewed from Regent Street]]\nThe Mortuary Station, or the Receiving House as it was known, was originally constructed for funeral parties, the mourners accompanying the coffin on the journey to the [[necropolis]] at [[Rookwood Cemetery]].  Most documentary sources date the building as being constructed in 1869, however, the outline of the station first appears on the 1865 MWS&DB (Metropolitan Water Sewerage & Drainage Board) plan. The rail lines had not yet been constructed. The inner Sydney cemetery or New Burial Ground, also known as the Sandhills or Devonshire Street station, was located in the Brickfields, a site now occupied by the main terminal building. By the 1840s this cemetery was overcrowded and a new location, in close proximity to a railway line, was required. In the early 1860s a site at Haslem's Creek was selected for the new cemetery.  To distinguish the cemetery from the surrounding residential area of Haslem's Creek the cemetery became known as the Rookwood Necropolis. A station was constructed within the Rookwood Necropolis.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe [[New South Wales Government Architect|Colonial Architect]] [[James Barnet]] designed both receiving houses (mortuary stations) in the mid 1860s. The station within the Necropolis has subsequently been relocated and modified to form the nave of [[All Saints Church, Canberra|All Saints Church of England]], {{ACTcity|Ainslie}}, [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]]. Although both stations are Gothic Revival in style, the plan and detailing of each varies considerably. Barnet's two station buildings were designed to celebrate the passage of the coffin to and from the train. In the Victorian Era, mourning the dead was a prolonged ritual with elaborate rules concerning behaviour and dress. The train trip to Rookwood became part of this ritual.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe regular funerary train service to the Rookwood Necropolis commenced in 1867, two years before Mortuary Central and the Rookwood Station had been completed. By 1908 there were four stations within the necropolis, named Mortuary Stations 1-4, with the Sydney receiving house being known as Mortuary Central. Mortuary Central was built by Stoddart & Medway from Pyrmont sandstone and completed in March 1869. The carvings were executed by Thomas Duckett and Henry Apperly.  From the variation claim submitted by the builders it would appear that a slightly larger building, with more decoration was built than originally intended. The form of the Mortuary Station, with the large porte-coch\u00e8re, clearly indicates that it is not a church. A colonnade of trefoil arches and foliated capitals forms a screen to the platform. The same arch form being employed for both ends of the platform and for the octagonal porte-coch\u00e8re to the west. The station building is above street level, with a flight of stairs leading to the platform level. Ramps to the north and south were used for carriages. Internally were the ticket office, two vestibules and retiring rooms.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nPhotographs taken in the early 1870s clearly show the decorative detail of the building. Two colours of stone were employed, a darker shade of the arches and the surrounds to the medallions, the lighter shade being reserved for the ashlar work. The two shades of stone were employed internally in the same manner. The arcade covering the platform is very elaborate, with its curved queen post truss roof, with ripple iron above following the curve, blind arcading to the west that mirrors the eastern arcade, and geometric tiled floor. Even the platform benches follow the Gothic Revival theme of the design, resembling pews.  This platform would have contrasted with the more utilitarian Redfern station building, designed by John Whitton and constructed in the early 1870s.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe stonework of the Mortuary Station was very delicately worked, with a number of different foliage motifs forming the capitals, the trefoil spandrel panel within the main arches and the medallions. A star and zig-zag motif was used on the soffit of the arch, ball flowers on the cornice brackets and a zig-zag on the cornice. The original roof covering was slate, with a pattern of half round and diamond slates being employed at the ridge and above the eaves.  The octagonal porte-coch\u00e8re terminates in a bell-cote, whose detail is a miniature of the main trefoil arch and medallion motif. The bellcote was roofed with lead. Decorative metalwork is also employed, as finals, as a cresting and as balustrades.  A leaf motif was used for the balustrade to the porte-coch\u00e8re and repeated in the panels of the elaborate timber gates that lead to the platform. A palisade fence that stepped down to follow the slope and matching gates separated the station from the street and a picket fence lined the ramps. The [[spire]] of Mortuary Station (the Bellcote) was a distinctive townscape element that could be seen from the Exhibition Grounds (Prince Alfred Park) and from Sydney University.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe arcade detail of Mortuary Central, with its pointed trefoil arches, medallions and foliated capitals, is reminiscent of the hotel at [[St Pancras Station]] by Sir [[George Gilbert Scott]], designed in 1865 and constructed in 1868\u201373. There are few other station buildings, either in Australia or the United Kingdom, with this level of decorative detail. The construction of special mortuary stations is rare, with no other examples having been located. The Mortuary station became part of the rail complex at Central after the new station was constructed in 1906, although it remained physically separate from the new station buildings.<ref name=\"nswshr2\"/>\n\nBy the late 1970s the station had deteriorated, slates were missing from the roof and the stonework, black from pollution, was also covered in graffiti.  A restoration program was undertaken in 1983.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\n=== The Railway Institute ===\nThe Railway Institute on Chalmers Street was constructed as a venue for the railway employees, providing a setting for both educational activities and social functions. It is reputed to be the first Railway Institute in Australia and provided a range of services for railway employees such as evening classes and a library. A competition was held for the design, which was won by the architect [[Henry Robinson (architect)|Henry Robinson]]. It is a Queen Anne Revival style building, based on English prototypes such as the London Board Schools. The design was the first use of Marseille roof tiles for public buildings in Australia.  Many public buildings were designed by competition c. 1890, during the period of transition between the Colonial and Government Architects Offices. The practice was abandoned in the mid-1890s due to the partiality of the judges.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nWhen the Railway Institute was constructed in 1891, the building was located on the corner of Devonshire Street and Elizabeth Street, at the northeastern corner of the Sydney rail yard. The surrounding streets and the carriage way have subsequently been modified.  A carriage-way lead to the porte-coch\u00e8re, enabling people attending social functions to enter the building without getting wet. In addition to the library there were two halls, a large hall, with a stage, and a smaller hall on the ground floor.  The detail of this space is largely intact and there are few examples of small scale halls of this period remaining in Sydney. A single storey addition to the building, designed by the Government Architect [[Walter Liberty Vernon]], was added in 1898 to the southeast of the main building.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nClasses, such as engineering drafting, and examinations for railway employees, were held in the Institute. The building was also utilised during emergencies such as the 1919 influenza epidemic when women volunteers manufactured face masks (for railway employees). There are few examples of Institutes of this period that provided such a high level of facilities for the benefit of the employees.  The names on the Honour Board reads as a who's who of railway personalities.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\n== Station layout ==\nCentral Railway Station has buildings concentrated on its northern boundaries that are fed by large rail yards behind.  Together they form part of the fabric of the city of Sydney and form boundaries to its inner suburbs.  The location of this station is on land that has been in continuous government use since the commencement of European settlement.  Various forms of public transport have radiated from this site since 1855.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\n=== Sydney Terminal building ===\n[[File:Central railway station Sydney Grand Concourse 201708.jpg|thumb|Eastward view of the Grand Concourse in 2017]]\n[[File:EternitycafeCentralSydney.jpg|thumb|Eternity Cafe within the Sydney Terminal building]]\nThe most prominent part of Sydney Central Station, visible from many parts of the City and surrounding area, is the 1906 sandstone main terminal building, referred to as the \"Sydney Terminal Building\" by railway staff. It is sited to dominate its surroundings and to mark the importance of the railways and its service to the state and the city.\n\nThe main concourse and platforms are elevated above the surrounding roads. This elevated siting also permits the use of the topography to gain road access to more than one level enabling the development of an extensive subterranean luggage network and separation of differing modes of transport.  The commanding position of the Terminus with large areas of open space sloping away from the building continues the public domain of Railway Square whilst maintaining a clear vista of the Terminus from the surrounding area. The Terminus, and in part the Parcels Post Office, create a formal edge to Railway Square.\n\nOn the main Eddy Avenue fa\u00e7ade, the Terminus comprises a [[colonnade]] and porte-coch\u00e8re, which originally provided an undercover area for passengers transferring to and from trams. After the removal of the original Sydney tram network, the upper level colonnade was used by motor vehicles, but it is now again used by trams on the [[Dulwich Hill Line]].\n\nThe main concourse, called the \"Main Assembly platform\", is located on the upper level and is the centre of the Terminus, around which all of the ancillary functions, such as refreshment rooms, waiting rooms and the booking hall, were arranged.  As originally built, the main terminal building also had terraces or \"decks\" on the east and west sides, which were accessible by vehicles. The main concourse \"platform\" was accessed from both the East and West deck. The main concourse is dominated by a large vaulted roof over the concourse and elaborate [[masonry]], primarily [[Sydney sandstone]].\n\nThe station opened on 5 August 1906 with 11 platforms, but was soon expanded to 15, and by 1913 had 19.<ref name=BulletinMar01>{{cite journal |title=Sydney's Electric Trains from 1926 to 1960 |journal=[[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]] |number=761 |date=March 2001 |pages=87, 94, 95 101 }}</ref> As part of the construction of the electrified city railway in the 1920s, the existing station was cut back to 15 platforms with new platforms built to the east of the existing station. As part of the project, platforms 10 to 15 were electrified, with platforms 1 to 9 following in 1956.<ref name=BulletinMar01/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Oakes|first1=John|title=Sydney's Central|date=2002|publisher=Australian Railway Historical Society|location=Redfern|isbn=0 909650 56 X|page=53}}</ref>\n\nThe current 15 Sydney Terminal platforms run perpendicular to the main station concourse and all are dead ended with the buffer stop. They are arranged as seven double platforms and one single platform, each with an [[awning]], servicing a total of 15 tracks.  Platforms 1\u20133 are for country and interstate services, while the remainder are for interurban services.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nPlatforms 1\u201310 have a centre run-round track, which was for locomotive-hauled trains.  It enabled the locomotive to uncouple from its train and either depart or re-couple on the other end to pull the train to the next destination.  There was extreme pressure on the speed to ready a train for the next destination due to the lack of platform space and a steady growth of rail patronage.  These centre lines are now used for storage of electric rail car sets in off peak times.  The platforms feature long timber-framed canopies over some of the platforms (incorporating Howe [[trusses]]).  Timber was used in lieu of steel because of the high cost at the time of importing steel.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe only locomotive hauled trains now using Sydney Terminal are the Indian Pacific and special trains which usually use Platform 1.  Platform 1 has always been the main out of Sydney Station with the longest platform.  Platforms 1 and 2\u20133 were lengthened to their present length in 1962 covering the skylights to the Devonshire Street Subway for diesel hauled trains like the Southern Aurora.  All long-distance [[NSW TrainLink]] [[New South Wales XPT|XPT]] and [[New South Wales Xplorer|Xplorer]] services and the [[Great Southern Rail (Australia)|Great Southern Rail]] ''[[Indian Pacific]]'' terminate at Central. These generally use Platforms 1 to 3, although when the ''Indian Pacific'' is in the station occupying both Platforms 2 and 3, some NSW TrainLink regional services use Platforms 4 to 12.\n\n=== Central Electric Station ===\n[[File:CentralStation2020January.jpg|thumb|Eddy Avenue entrance to the suburban platforms]]\nTo the east of the Sydney Terminal building are ten further platforms, used by suburban [[Sydney Trains]] services and by a limited number of NSW TrainLink intercity services during peak hours.\n\nAs part of the construction of the electrified city railway in the 1920s and the electrification and expansions of the Sydney suburban lines, the existing station was cut back to 15 platforms with new Platforms 16 to 23 built on the station's eastern side in 1926. The Electric Station was part of the construction works overseen by Bradfield that included the excavation of the tunnels, the building of the Harbour Bridge, and electrification of the suburban rail network.\n\nThe platforms continue north via a six-track viaduct paralleling [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney|Elizabeth Street]] built to the north, passing over Campbell Street and Hay Street, and ending at [[Goulburn Street]] where it enters tunnels to connect with the City Circle underground rail system and the North Shore over the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\n\nPlatforms 16 to 23 are also elevated, but are served by a lower level concourse at street level. Railway staff refer to this part of the station as the \"Central Electric Station\", or \"Central Electric System\". The two stations were managed and staffed as separate entities.<ref name=nswshr-1255/> This section of the station is also referred to as the \"suburban\" platforms. There are two major pedestrian entrances to Central Electric: one at Elizabeth Street and one at the top of Eddy Avenue ramp.  Both are constructed of Maroubra [[sandstone]] with classical detailing.<ref name=nswshr-1255/><ref name=cmp/>{{rp|page=92\u201397}}\n\nThe four island platforms allow four eight trains to use the station, four trains in each direction. South of these new platforms, a series of [[flying junction]]s were built. This involved the four southbound tracks passing beneath the northbound tracks with a series of [[Level junction|diamond crossings]] allowing trains to cross lines without impeding trains traveling in the opposite direction.<ref name=BulletinMar01/>\n\nIn February 1926, Platforms 18 and 19 of the steam station were wired for electric trains with a demonstration run from Sydney to [[Hurstville railway station|Hurstville]]. This wiring was transferred to Platforms 21 and 23 and Platforms 14 and 15 were wired for [[Bankstown railway station|Bankstown]] electric train services commencing October 1926 and later worked into [[St James railway station, Sydney|St James]]. As the [[Homebush railway station|Homebush]] electrification was completed, Platforms 17 and 18 were wired. Electric trains to [[Hornsby railway station|Hornsby]] via the main line commenced on 21 January 1929. Trains to Hornsby used Platforms 16 and 18. Steam services to [[Parramatta railway station|Parramatta]] and [[Liverpool railway station, Sydney|Liverpool]] were converted to electric in November 1929. Western electric trains began operating through to [[Wynyard railway station, Sydney|Wynyard]] from 28 February 1932.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=ARHS Bulletin|title=Unknown|year=1942|volume=56|pages=3}}</ref>\n\nTwo further underground platforms were built as part of the [[Eastern Suburbs railway line|Eastern Suburbs Railway]], bringing the total number of platforms in the suburban section to ten. Construction commenced in 1948 but the line was not finished until 1979. While the plans called for four platforms, two (for the Southern Suburbs line) were intended to be used in the future and have never been brought into service. They were for a time used for archival storage by the railways.\n\n===Metro station===\nA construction project began in 2018 to construct two new underground platforms to serve the [[Sydney Metro City & Southwest]], and a new underground concourse called Central Walk. The new platforms are being built beneath Platforms 13-14.<ref>{{cite web|title=$955 Million Central Walk, Sydney Metro Contract Awarded - securing more NSW jobs|url=https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/news-and-events/media-releases/955-million-central-walk-sydney-metro-contract-awarded-securing-more|publisher=Transport for NSW|accessdate=7 March 2018|date=7 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180307151229/https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/news-and-events/media-releases/955-million-central-walk-sydney-metro-contract-awarded-securing-more|archive-date=7 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In November and December 2018, Platforms 12/13 and 14/15 were demolished.

The underpass allows pedestrians to access the eastern \"suburban\" section from Railway Square and Chalmers Street.<ref>[http://www.sydneyarchitecture.com/SUB/SUB-08.htm Tunnelling Through the Past] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521180359/http://www.sydneyarchitecture.com/SUB/SUB-08.htm |date=21 May 2014 }} Sydney Architecture</ref> To the west, the tunnel continues under Railway Square and connects to [[The Goods Line]] &ndash; the former [[Darling Harbour Line]] railway line which has been converted to a park and pedestrian pathway to [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]] and [[Darling Harbour]].\n\n===Railway Square===\n{{main|Railway Square, Sydney}}\nThe western side of the Sydney Terminal building leads down to Railway Square, originally Central Square, at the junction of George and [[Pitt Street, Sydney|Pitt]] Streets. Although Railway Square no longer signifies the entrance to the interior of the colony, it has always channelled traffic from the southern parts of the city and out west to [[Parramatta]]. From the building of the first railway terminus at Devonshire Street in 1855, it was an important focus for the arrival of country persons to the city and later commuters into the city.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe importance of the relationship between the Sydney Terminus and Railway Square is reflected in the elevations of the main building. Here the dominating presence of the clock tower, completed in 1921, marked the arrival and departure times, the beginning and end of a workman's day. Before the spread of the suburbs, a workman could make a return trip home to eat dinner in his lunch hour.\n\n===Parcel Office building===\nTo the west of the southern end of Platform 1 is the Inwards Parcel Office.  This was the [[loading dock]] for parcels and mail from the post office.  The mail was loaded via a tunnel from the post office. The Parcels Post Office is an unusual urban building, being designed to be viewed from three sides.  Its symmetrical, boldly modelled elevations and its siting in the middle of an open space give it the presence of a public monument or sculpture.  Due to the oblique road approaches to the Railway Square this building forms a strong element within the Sydney Terminal Precinct.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe Parcel Office building is now an apartment-hotel, managed by Adina.\n\n=== Sydney Yards ===\nSouth of the Devonshire Street Tunnel, a large rail yard extends to the Cleveland Street Bridge, linking the Sydney Terminal platforms (1-15) with the railway lines extending west. The track layout to Platforms 1\u201315 have remained virtually unchanged since they were originally laid out in 1906. Major items from its period as a steam locomotive hauled train yard have been removed. These include the Eastern Carriage shed demolished in 1986, Coal Stages, and Engine Docks at the head of each platform.  Ash pits and water [[columns]] that were part of the yard have also been removed. There is only one \"yard controller\" remaining within the Yard.  Previously, at least two Signal Boxes would have been located in the Yard at any one time, but these have been removed due to the mechanical interlocking system being computerised and pneumatically operated.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe Yard buildings have been altered significantly since the Eastern Carriage Shed was demolished.  This large shed divided the central yard from the central electric lines.  The land where the shed once stood lay vacant until the construction projects begun in 2018. Remaining structures signifying the division of the yard are the Cleaners Amenities and the former Timetable Office with the garden. The Rail Yard connects to the passenger platforms of Sydney Terminal which are as originally designed and built, with the infrastructure for steam locomotives having been removed - these being water columns between each track near the buffers. However, the concrete [[plinth]]s remain.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe open space of the rail yards adds to the experience of arrival to the city from the north and south by opening up vistas to the imposing Sydney Terminal with its landmark tower.  This open space permits the imposing Terminus and its Tower to be visible when viewed from a distance much as it was intended when originally built.  The Terminus and its approaches define formal urban spaces in the city fabric.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\n=== Western Yard ===\nThe Western Rail Yard lies west of the westernmost main line track leading to Platform 1 (No. 1 Main Line), and extends to the Regent Street boundary to the west, Devonshire Street Subway to the north and Cleveland Street Bridge to the south. Until the construction project begun in 2018, the track layout of this yard had remained virtually unchanged since 1906. The rail sidings that take up the bulk of the land area were known as the \"Botany Road Yards\".  These siding lines are still in service but are seldom used. The lines were used as storage yards for making up passenger trains and for goods being loaded and unloaded at the Parcel and Goods Sidings.  This was a major activity at the Sydney Terminal that has become obsolete due to the introduction of technological changes such as fixed sets of rail cars, and the phasing out of locomotive-pulled trains. The [[Darling Harbour Line]] branch line formerly cut through the precinct providing access to Darling Harbour Goods Yard. This is no longer in use, and part of the former line is now [[the Goods Line]], a lineal park connected to Devonshire Street Tunnel.\n\nThe underpass and overbridge date from 1855. The Mortuary Station with its siding and platform is on the boundary of this rail yard, facing Regent Street, and is visible from Railway Square because of the low scale of buildings in the Western Yard. Rail access to the Mortuary Station was from the main lines near the Cleveland Street Bridge, and has remained in service since the mid-1860s.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nNearer to the present main station building were the West Carriage Shed, demolished in 1999.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Suburban Report |journal=[[Railway Digest]] |date=November 1986 |page=344}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Newsline |journal=[[Railway Digest]] |date=April 1999 |page=12 }}</ref> This was the last remaining carriage [[shed]] at Central Station.  The six rail lines that enter the shed were connected to the yard through tunnels at the end of Platform 1.\n\nThe Yard was designed for locomotive-hauled trains.  As this technology has gone out of use except for the ''Indian Pacific'' and Special Trains the yard has little present functional use.  With locomotive hauled trains the trains were marshalled for running in one direction. It has the locomotive at the head of the train and a brake van near the rear.  This meant that trains when ending their journey had to be remarshalled before commencing their journey out of Sydney Station.  The introduction of trains with driving positions at both ends of the train no longer require this process.  As the station originally handled locomotive hauled passenger trains for suburban, country and interstate service this activity was considerable.  Most of the steam loco facilities and trackwork has been removed. The decline in shunting and the removal of coal and water storage has seen a reduction in the level of activity in the yard. Although it has progressed through various configurations, the landscape has maintained the same ground level since 1856 with its final layout being enlarged in 1906 by the removal of some houses and the realignment of Regent Street to its present format.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\n===Parcel Dock===\nThe Parcel Dock was physically connected with the main station complex and had four platforms (two dock platforms) for the use of mail trains. Due to the decline of parcel delivery by rail, this was cut back to serve a [[motorail]] loading ramp (for the loading of automobiles) for the ''[[Indian Pacific]]''. The space where the mail sidings were is now a [[YHA Australia|Youth Hostels Association]] hostel named the Sydney Railway Square YHA. The hostel rooms are modelled on old train carriages.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.yha.com.au/hostels/nsw/sydney-surrounds/railway-square/ |title=Sydney Railway Square YHA |publisher=[[YHA Australia]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410201858/http://www3.yha.com.au/hostels/nsw/sydney-surrounds/railway-square/# |archive-date=10 April 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Former Prince Alfred Sidings ===\nThe Prince Alfred Sidings were formerly to the south of Platform 23 and on the eastern perimeter of the site, making up the boundary with Prince Alfred Park to the southeast.  The Prince Alfred or \"PA\" electric car sidings were built only after the flyovers. Prior to the construction of the electric lines, the yard was a goods yard containing Produce and Goods Sheds as well as the first carriage shed.  All have been removed from this precinct. The Yard is a small part of the original Sydney yard, of which a number of buildings remain which date from 1870.  Later additional buildings are associated with the 1926 Electric Suburban System.  The construction of the electric system reduced the width of the Prince Alfred Sidings, and trains within this yard needed to be protected because of vandalism.  The Electric Sub Station is part of the 1926 electrification works and is linked with the sub station at the Sydney Harbour Bridge.  It also contains air compressors for the operation of pneumatic points within the Yard and the City Circle Lines. A [[retaining wall]] forms the boundary with Prince Alfred Park; it has been incorporated into the rear wall of the blacksmiths workshops.  A number of mature trees are growing on the boundary, the largest being a Moreton Bay Fig at least 80 years old.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe Prince Alfred sidings were closed in August 1995 and then demolished to make way for the [[Airport railway line, Sydney|Airport line]], which enters a tunnel built into the retaining wall of Prince Alfred Park.<ref>{{cite journal |title=CityRail's New Timetable |journal=[[Railway Digest]] |date=August 1995 |page=13 }}</ref>\n\n==Platforms==\n[[File:Platform 20 and 21 at Central Station in Sydney.jpg|thumb|Platforms 20 and 21 in 2013]]\nCentral serves all Sydney suburban lines except for the [[Cumberland railway line|Cumberland Line]]. The platforms are numbered from 1 to 25, with 1 being the westernmost platform and 25 being one of the easternmost. Platforms 1 to 15 are above ground terminating at the Sydney Terminal Building. Platforms 16 to 23 are above ground and part of the suburban station to the east of the main building. Platforms 24 to 25 are underground. New platforms are being constructed under Platforms 13 and 14 to serve the future metro line.\n{{Central platform box}}\n\n==Connecting services==\n===Light rail===\n[[File:Central light rail station.JPG|thumb|The [[Dulwich Hill Line|Inner West Light Rail]] at Central]]\n[[File:L2LRServiceCentral.jpg|thumb|An L2 Light Rail service towards Randwick]]\n{{see also|Light rail in Sydney}}\nCentral Grand Concourse is the eastern terminus of the [[Dulwich Hill Line]] that operates to [[Chinatown, Sydney|Chinatown]], [[Darling Harbour]], [[Pyrmont, New South Wales|Pyrmont]] and the inner western suburbs.

This area was originally designed for trams, and as such was used by [[Trams in Sydney|trams]] until 1958, when the service was withdrawn. It was known as Railway Colonnade and then Central. Light rail services operate in a clockwise direction, whereas the trams operated in an anti-clockwise direction.\n\nThe [[CBD and South East Light Rail]] from [[Circular Quay]] to [[Kingsford, New South Wales|Kingsford]] and [[Randwick, New South Wales|Randwick]] also run via Central:<ref>[http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/b2b/projects/CBD-South-East_Light_Rail_Project_Update_April_2013.pdf CBD & South East Light Rail Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521163130/http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/b2b/projects/CBD-South-East_Light_Rail_Project_Update_April_2013.pdf |date=21 May 2014 }} Transport for New South Wales April 2013</ref> its nearest stops are Haymarket Stop, at Rawson Place to the northwest, and Central Chalmers Street, on Chalmers Street to the east.\n\n===Bus services===\n{{see also|Buses in Sydney}}\nMany bus services depart from the adjacent Eddy Avenue or from the nearby [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney|Elizabeth Street]] or [[Railway Square]].\n\n===Coach services===\nLong distance coaches depart from the western forecourt and Pitt Street:\n*[[Australia Wide Coaches]] operates services to [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]]\n*[[Firefly Express]] operates services to [[Southern Cross railway station|Melbourne]] and [[Adelaide]] via Melbourne<ref>[https://www.fireflyexpress.com.au/fireflynew/viewtimetable.asp?timetable=5 Timetables] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180520125103/https://www.fireflyexpress.com.au/fireflynew/viewtimetable.asp?timetable=5 |date=20 May 2018 }}  Firefly retrieved 20 May 2018.</ref>\n*[[Greyhound Australia]] operates services to [[Brisbane]], [[Byron Bay]], [[Canberra]] and Melbourne \n*[[Murrays]] operates services to Canberra\n*[[Port Stephens Coaches]] operates services to [[Fingal Bay]]\n*[[Premier Transport Group#Premier Motor Service|Premier Motor Service]] operates services to Brisbane and [[Eden, New South Wales|Eden]]<ref>[http://www.premierms.com.au/newhome/TimeTableSelect.asp Australian timetables] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410075510/http://www.premierms.com.au/newhome/TimeTableSelect.asp |date=10 April 2013 }} Premier Transport Group</ref>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nSydney Central station was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999, as a place which is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales, and in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales, as well as having a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.

of Sydney]] local government area of [[New South Wales]], Australia. The station is the largest and busiest railway station in New South Wales and serves as a major [[transport interchange]] for [[NSW TrainLink]] [[inter-city rail]] services, [[Sydney Trains]] [[commuter rail]] services, [[Light rail in Sydney|Sydney light rail]] services, [[State Transit Authority|State Transit]] bus services, and private coach transport services. Often abbreviated as '''Central''' or '''Central station''', the station is also known as '''Sydney Terminal''' (especially the older, intercity section). The property is owned by [[RailCorp]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-1255>{{cite NSW SHR|5012230|Sydney Terminal and Central Railway Stations Group|hr=01255|fn=EF14/19868; 09/3179|accessdate=13 October 2018}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License].</ref> It recorded 85.4&nbsp;million passenger movements in 2018.\n\nCentral station occupies a large city block separating {{NSWcity|Haymarket}}, {{NSWcity|Surry Hills}}, and the central business district, bounded by [[Railway Square]] and [[Pitt Street]] in the west, [[Eddy Avenue]] in the north, [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney|Elizabeth Street]] in the east and the [[Devonshire Street Tunnel]] in the south. Parts of the station and [[marshalling yard]]s extend as far south as [[Cleveland Street, Sydney|Cleveland Street]], and are located on the site of the former [[Devonshire Street Cemetery]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Devonshire Street Cemetery, Sydney (2742078059).jpg|thumb|left|Central station was built on land previously occupied by the Devonshire Street Cemetery.]]\n[[File:Laying the foundation stone, Central Station 1903 (5207836628).jpg|thumb|left|Laying the foundation stone in 1903]]\n\n=== First Sydney terminal ===\nThere have been three terminal stations in Sydney.\n\nThe railway arrived in New South Wales in 1831. Proposals began in the 1840s for a railway linking the two major centres of [[Sydney]] and [[Parramatta]], with an eastern terminus close to the Sydney city centre.\n\nAlthough the Sydney Railway Company first applied to the government for four blocks of land between Hay and [[Cleveland Street, Sydney|Cleveland]] Streets in 1849, the [[Surveyor General of New South Wales|Surveyor General]] favoured Grose Farm, now the grounds of [[the University of Sydney]]. It was further from the city and less costly to develop. The Company finally exchanged land in the first, second and third blocks, between Hay and Devonshire Streets, for an increased area of {{convert|20|acre|ha|0|order=flip|spell=on}} in the fourth block, the Government Paddocks, between Devonshire and Cleveland Streets. Hence the site of the first Sydney railway terminus was located here from 1855.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe original Sydney station was opened on 26 September 1855 in an area known as Cleveland Fields. It was a temporary timber and corrugated iron building, constructed rapidly in late August to early September 1855, in time for the opening of the line to Parramatta for passenger trains.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThis station (one wooden platform in a corrugated iron shed), called Sydney Terminal, had Devonshire Street as its northern boundary.<ref name=\"central history\">{{cite web |url=http://sydneytrains.info/about/history/central_station_in-depth |title=Central Station - in-depth history |work=[[Sydney Trains]] |publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]] |date= |access-date=3 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810221634/http://sydneytrains.info/about/history/central_station_in-depth |archive-date=10 August 2013 }}</ref> It was frequently but unofficially called Redfern station,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://gallery.records.nsw.gov.au/index.php/galleries/through-the-lens-central-railway-station/|title=Central Railway Station, Sydney - Gallery - State Records NSW|work=State Records NSW - Digital Gallery|access-date=2017-04-13|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903200748/http://gallery.records.nsw.gov.au/index.php/galleries/through-the-lens-central-railway-station/|archive-date=3 September 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> while at that time the present [[Redfern railway station|Redfern station]] was officially called Eveleigh.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dictionaryofsydney.org/map/76629|title=Atlas of the Suburbs of Sydney - Redfern 1886-1888|website=dictionaryofsydney.org|access-date=2017-04-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170413235033/http://dictionaryofsydney.org/map/76629|archive-date=13 April 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Although called \"Redfern Station\", the first and second Sydney Terminals were never actually located in Redfern, being to the north of Cleveland Street which is Redfern's northern boundary.\n\nThe first and second station buildings were both in the form of a shed which covered the main line. A photograph of the exterior of the first station taken in 1871 shows vertical boarding, windows with a hood and a corrugated iron roof, with a roof vent. Internally the stud framing and timber truss roof members were exposed. The offices and public facilities were contained in the adjacent lean-to, which faced George Street. Only one platform and the main up-line served the passenger station. A similar platform and line layout was used for the Mortuary Station, constructed 15 years later; however, the level of detail and materials varied considerably.<ref name=nswshr-1255/> The first station building was extended almost immediately, a shed being constructed at the southern end to cover an additional {{convert|100|ft|m|0|order=flip}} of platform.\n\n===Second Sydney Terminal===\nWhen this station became inadequate for the traffic it carried, a new station was built in 1874 on the same site and was also called Sydney Terminal.\n\nThe Second Sydney Terminal was a more substantial brick station building, initially with two platforms. The second station building was constructed on the site of the first station, the main hall spanning the up and down mainlines. Separate platforms and facilities were provided for arriving and departing passengers. The new station building appears to have taken three years to complete: the drawings are dated 1871, while the official opening was in 1874. The second station, like the first, was constructed to allow for a future extension of the line into the city, the lines initially extending just far enough past the building to accommodate a steam locomotive.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nJohn Whitton, the Engineer-in-Chief, designed a neo-classical station building to be constructed of brick, with the decorative detail formed using polychromatic and relief work. Almost immediately the demand for platform space during peak times resulted in additional branch lines and platforms being constructed adjacent to the passenger station. These lines were brought in front of the station, obscuring it from view and isolating the verandah. By 1890 Whitton's station building had become engulfed within a sea of sheds and tram platform canopies. The second Redfern station, demolished following the completion of the first stage of the main terminal building {{circa|1906}}, was a gloomy building, the glass in the roof lantern not permitting a great deal of light to enter and the soot from the steam locomotives coating the surfaces with grime.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe second station grew to 14 platforms before it was replaced by the present-day station to the north of Devonshire Street.\n\n===Proposals for extension into the city===\nIn major metropolitan areas the rail terminus tended to be located within the inner core of the city. The site of the first and second station termini was inconveniently located for the city. Initially, a horse-bus service operated from the station to the city, and both Engineer-in-Chief, [[John Whitton]], and Chief Commissioner for Railways, B. H. Martindale, recognised the urgency of a city rail extension.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nIn 1877 John [[Young, New South Wales|Young]], a prominent Sydney builder and local politician, proposed a scheme to provide a circular city extension to the railway. The route included stations at [[Oxford Street, Sydney|Oxford Street]], [[William Street, Sydney|William Street]] and [[Woolloomooloo]] in the east, [[Circular Quay]], then [[Dawes Point, New South Wales|Dawes Point]] and a line parallel to [[Darling Harbour]] in the west. John Whitton designed a grand city terminus at the corner of Hunter and [[Castlereagh Street]]s two years later. Neither of these schemes eventuated.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nIn 1895 the Parliamentary Standing Committee on [[NSW Public Works|Public Works]] advised that a Royal Commission should be constituted to \"inquire into the question of bringing the railway from its present terminus at Redfern into the city\". The findings of the Commission, favouring a site in St James Road, were released in 1897. The term Central Station was now in common use. The public Works Annual report of 1896-7 noted that \"the Railway Construction Branch was called upon to furnish voluminous plans and estimates of the cost of the various proposals brought before the commission. After a most exhaustive investigation, the Royal Commission reported, almost unanimously, in favour of the extension of the railway into the city by the route and according to the plan as described as the St James Road Scheme\".<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nIn 1897 [[Norman Selfe]] drew up a scheme for the gradual enlargement and extension of the railway to the northern end of the city and in the same year Railway Commissioner, E. M. G. Eddy, proposed a terminal city station at the corner of [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney|Elizabeth Street]] and St James' Road. The route of the latter was virtually the same as that for 1879, however, the new site for the terminus included half of the northern end of [[Hyde Park, Sydney|Hyde Park]]. Although {{convert|16|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} of the burial ground in Devonshire Street was offered as compensation, public sentiment still opposed the loss of Hyde Park.\n\nThe initial designs for a near Sydney Terminal were prepared by Henry Deane, the Engineer-in-Chief of Railway Construction in consultation with the Railway Commissioners. Mr Deane is reputed to have prepared ten schemes for the Royal Commission. Although the St James location was preferred, a scheme that did not involve the disturbance of or use of land in Hyde Park was sought. The extension of [[Belmore Park]] was initially proposed in the 1897 scheme as compensation for the use of the northwestern corner of Hyde Park as a railway station. Following a change of government the St James scheme was abandoned and Henry Deane prepared, {{circa|1899}}, a further two schemes, one of which was for the Old Burial Ground Site.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe Royal Commission in 1897 again considered the city railway extension because of dangerous congestion at Redfern and recommended using Hyde Park. Then, after an investigative trip overseas, Henry Deane prepared alternative proposals for a new railway terminal for the government in 1900. The second scheme proposal called for the resumption of the Devonshire Street cemeteries, but this was cheaper and less contentious than the acquisition of Hyde Park. It was the second scheme which was eventually adopted.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe earlier schemes to extend the lines further into the city would have been prohibitively expensive and would have required large scale resumptions. The site of the Old Burial ground was, in comparison, relatively easily obtainable as no private land was involved. Due to the extent of the resumption there would, in addition to a terminus, be room for the extension of the goods yard and the erection of a carriage shed and post office. The existing lines were at a higher level than the Burial Ground, so rather than lowering the existing railway track, the tramlines were to be raised to serve a high level station. The Public Works Committee passed the design on 7 June 1900, however, a much modified building was actually constructed.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe total estimated cost of the works was to be {{Australian pound|561,000}} with the General Works estimated at {{Australian pound|138,000}}, the Station Building estimated at {{Australian pound|233,000}} and the Resumptions estimated at {{Australian pound|140,000}}. Almost immediately these estimates proved conservative, there was much public concern regarding the removal of bodies from the Old Burial ground and a new cemetery, the [[Botany, New South Wales|Botany]] Cemetery, had to be constructed, at public expense, at [[La Perouse, New South Wales|La Perouse]].<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\n===Third Sydney Terminal (Central station)===\nWhen the third station was built in 1906, it moved one block north, closer to the city. It fronted Garden Road, which was realigned to form Eddy Avenue. If [[Belmore Park]] is included, all the land now occupied by the railway at Central and Redfern coincides with the Company's original selection of four blocks between Hay and Cleveland Streets.<ref name=nswshr-1255/> The present station was officially opened on 4 August 1906 and opening for passengers on 5 August 1906.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article28160131? |title=The New Central Station |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=6 August 1906 |page=6 |access-date= |publisher=Trove, [[National Library of Australia]] }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Central Station, 1924 (4010230424).jpg|thumb|Western end of the colonnade and tram stop, with the [[porte-coch\u00e8re]] in the background, 1924]]\nDuring [[Lachlan Macquarie|Governor Macquarie]]'s term, the future site of the Sydney Terminal was beyond the limits of settlement, which were marked by the tollhouse located at the end of [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]] and at the entrance to [[Railway Square]].<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nCentral station was designed by the Government Architect, [[Walter Liberty Vernon]]. The new station was built on a site previously occupied by the [[Devonshire Street Cemetery]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weekendnotes.com/central-railway-station-sydney/|title=Sydney's Central Station - Now and Then Photos - Sydney|publisher=Weekend Notes|access-date=4 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327221417/http://www.weekendnotes.com/central-railway-station-sydney/|archive-date=27 March 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> South Sydney Morgue, the Convent of the Good Samaritan, the Sydney Female Refuge, police barracks and superintendent's residence (on Pitt Street), Christ Church Parsonage, the Benevolent Asylum (fronting Railway Square), a steam train depot (ad the corner of [[Pitt Street]] with Garden Road), as well as some residential properties on Railway Place.<ref name=nswshr-1255/> The convent, female refuge and police barracks were all original part of \"Carters Barracks\", built in 1819 to house convict gangs working as carters on the brick fields. The adjacent field which is today [[Belmore Park]] was known as the \"police paddock\", after the police barracks.\n\nThe remains exhumed from the cemetery were re-interred at several other Sydney cemeteries including [[Rookwood Cemetery|Rookwood]] and [[Waverley Cemetery|Waverley]] cemeteries. Bodies were moved to [[Botany, New South Wales|Botany]] by steam tram motors and flat cars.<ref name=\"central history\"/>\n\nMr E. O'Sullivan, the Minister for Works, in 1901 established the [Central] Station Advisory Board, comprising railway experts to  \"investigate the question of the design and arrangements of the station\".  The members included [[Walter Liberty Vernon]], both of the chief engineers of the NSW railway (for railway construction and existing lines respectively), and the chief engineers of the Queensland and Victorian railways.<ref name=nswshr-1255/> The committee also considered a suitable design for the new [[Flinders Street railway station|Flinders Street station]] in [[Melbourne]]. The design for the Sydney Terminus was to be a collaboration between the architect and the railway engineers.  The layout was largely determined by the planning requirements of the railway engineers, to which an appropriate architectural style was overlaid. However, the initial scheme did not contain the required accommodation and an enlargement of the building was approved by the Minister.  The cost estimate was now {{Australian pound|610,000}}. The Board were to fulfil the wishes of the Minister that \"the building should be a monumental work of stateliness and beauty\".\n\nAn early proposal for the new terminus, and the changes to the surrounding area, were reported in the ''Sydney Mail'' in 1901:<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\n{{blockquote|\"One of the reforms to be incidentally effected will be the widening of Pitt Street near the railway to 100ft.  The width will secured by taking in land on the right already resumed or in Government hands, and including the Benevolent Asylum grounds, the convent along the northern side of Pitt Street where it debouches upon George Street.  The result will be a fine, broad thoroughfare, tree bordered to form the entrance to the city...  ...Mr O'Sullivan is also conferring with Mr S Horden to see if an arrangement can be made for the purpose of widening Gipps Street, at present a narrow thoroughfare before any new buildings are erected.  By planting these broad streets on each side with trees, Mr O'Sullivan contends that a magnificent entrance to the city will be established and the trees will set off the new station. He considers that this opportunity for the improvement and ornamentation of Sydney should not be lost, especially as it will not entail a very heavy cost upon the tax payer, most of the land utilised already being the property of the crown. There will be four double and four single platforms, or practically twelve single platforms in all... Between the end of the docks and the main buildings is the assembly platform, 70ft wide.  On the platform level will be booking offices, waiting rooms, cloak and luggage offices, lavatories, convenient refreshment rooms, dining rooms, etc.  The basement will be devoted to kitchens, stores, baggage rooms, offices for minor officials, and a dining room for the Railway Commissioners and their staffs, including the clerical, professional, traffic and audit branches. The railway is to cross Devonshire Street, which as a street for heavy traffic will cease to exist.  It will be lowered and modified, to suite pedestrian, cab and light traffic only, with a width of 50ft.  The heavy traffic hitherto taken over Devonshire Street will be diverted along Belmore Road and a new street which is to be made on the east side of the station. Cabs will enter the station from Devonshire Street.  The exit for cabs will lead into Pitt Street by an inclined ramp and subway, thus avoiding any crossing on the level of the path of either pedestrians or tramcars. The main approach to the station will be opposite the intersection of George and Pitt Street, and foot passengers, and cabs and other vehicles will enter here.  Departure for vehicles will be effected by means of a ramp, descending from the north west corner of the building to Belmore Road. A subway for pedestrians to enter the building is to be provided from a point in Pitt Street, nearly opposite the north western corner of the building.  The tramway approaches have been so designed as to take them completely clear of all other classes of traffic and congestion, and interference and risk of injury will be altogether obviated. It is intended that the railway traffic should run as now arranged over the Castlereagh and Pitt Street route, but, instead of approaching the station on the ground level, the two lines begin to rise from a point in Belmore Park on a grade of 1 in 20, where they will terminate with a wide colonnade of (sic) platform level.\"}}\n\nThis design, with pavilions and a mansard roof, was strongly influenced by French Renaissance chateaux. The scale of the building, arrangement of the approaches and viaducts, the ground level colonnade and the position of the clocktower are all similar to the subsequent scheme, which was actually constructed.\n\nBy June 1901 work had begun on forming the site of the new station at Devonshire Street, the PWD Annual Report for 1900/01 noting that \"a great deal of preliminary work has had to be done in the preparation of the site for the new station and the extension of the railway, owing to the necessity of removing the bodies from the old cemetery and providing a new cemetery to receive the remains, as well as the demolition of the buildings and disposal of the material.  The work of clearing and levelling is now well in hand.\"  \"Private removals were commenced on the 29th of February 1901 and at the end of the year 1,145 bodies had been removed.\"  Families could remove the remains to a cemetery of their choosing, however, the majority of bodies removed were relocated, at government expense, to the new cemetery at La Perouse.  The Belmore Park to Fort Macquarie Electric Tramway was also constructed in 1900-1.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe earlier brick and sandstone design, with a mansard roof, was abandoned in favour of an all sandstone terminus building which largely incorporated the same passenger, tram and vehicle separation as the earlier scheme.  During 1899 a Parliamentary Standing Committee had debated whether the major public buildings should be constructed of brick with a sandstone trim or all sandstone.  This committee determined that, for major public buildings, sandstone should be used.\n\nTwo designs, by members of the Government Architects Branch, were submitted for the fa\u00e7ades in October 1901 to the Minister for Public Works and to the Railway Commissioners with the accompanying comment by the \"Board of Experts\" advising on the design of Central Station \"we are of the opinion that either one or the other of the architectural designs which accompany this report may with confidence be adopted\". Of the two fa\u00e7ade options, that of Gorrie McLeish Blair was reputedly selected. The 1901/02 Annual Report describes the progress a year later, \"''work has progressed vigorously during the year.  All the old buildings and human remains have been removed from the site and the foundation stone was laid at the corner of Pitt-street and the New Belmore road on the 30th April.  The information of New-Street, 2  chains in width, the extension of Castlereagh-street and the widening of Hay and Elizabeth Streets is well forward. The levelling of the whole site is practically finished, and great improvements have been made to Belmore and Prince Alfred Parks by filling in with the spoil excavated for the foundations''\".<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nA more detailed account is given of the excavation: \"the excavation to the docks and main building containing some 80,000 cubic yards, has been taken out and the material removed to Belmore Park, where it forms the tramway embankments and raises the general level of the park.  About 30,000 cubic yards of material from the Castlereagh-street cutting have been utilised in improving the level of Prince Alfred Park.\"<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nIn early 1902 the design of the terminus building was changed yet again, at the request of the \"Board of Experts\" advising on the design of Central.  \"...the station building has been increased in height by one storey, and considerably in length of front, and an east wing added.  A tower also of fine proportions has been included.  The completed building consequently shows a much larger building than originally proposed, but it is thought in the future it will come into use.  In the meantime, certain parts can be left out and added afterwards, but in spite of all such reduction the estimated cost of the new building and the main rood will amount to about {{Australian pound|400,000}} as compared with {{Australian pound|230,000}}\".<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nAs it was being built, it was reported that \"Everything in connection with the new station appears to have been designed on a grand scale, from the great elevated approaches down to the system of handling luggage underground.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article14790534 |title=New Railway Station.

This street will be continued to George Street and made 100ft wide. Steps are being taken to widen Pitt Street and make it 100ft wide. Hay Street and Elizabeth Street, where skirting the park, have been widened by the abolition of the pathway running alongside the park and the utilisation of the avenue in the park for the purpose.  A new street, 100ft wide on the East side of the station ground connects Elizabeth Street at the junction of Foveaux and [[Castlereagh Street]], Redfern. An inclined approach, including a width of forth feet for cabs, twenty feet for pedestrians and a sufficient width for the tramway runs parallel to Pitt Street, between Hay Street and the Station.  The return tramway descent...is made on the east side of the station.  These inclined approaches will have flat earthware slopes towards the park which will be ornamentally planted. At the southern end of the station, Devonshire Street, where it passes through traffic or skirts the railway property, will be closed to all but pedestrian traffic, the latter being accommodated by a subway. With regards to the Tramways, the Castlereagh and Pitt Street lines will be brought up by inclines to the platform level of the station...  The tramway running through Belmore Park has now been abolished and deviated via Elizabeth Street and the road in front of the station... ...From the north or City end, access to the station for pedestrians will be by a footpath twenty feet wide, starting from Hay Street and rising up with a one in sixteen grade to the colonnade in front of the main building.  From the west access will be obtained by a passenger subway fifteen feet wide opposite the new street, between George and Pitt Streets, with a one in twelve grade to platform level. A striking peculiarity and advantage in the arrangements of this station is that there are separate approaches for pedestrians, road traffic and tramways, so that there will be none of the clashing and danger incident on the present arrangement between George Street and the existing station.\"}}\n\nThe general design of the new station was also discussed:<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n{{blockquote|\"A great amount of attention was devoted to the treatment of the front and west sides, and there is an additional of a wing on the east side.  The tower, which will be situated near the north west corner of the station will be a commanding feature, and will be provided with a clock which will be visible from most parts of the city. It is expected that the whole will produce an imposing architectural effect.  The space enclosed between the wings of the building, and which is covered by the main roof, includes the assembly platform, 72 ft wide, five docks with three roads each and intervening platforms.  Outside the building, on the east side, some lines will be laid which can eventually be extended into the city should that work be authorised by [[Parliament of New South Wales|Parliament]].\n\nIt is intended that the accommodation for the public shall be specially commodious. It will be of a character that will not only be suitable and sufficient for many years to come, but it has been architecturally designed so as to be an object of admiration to visitors. A special feature of the Central Station design is its assembly platform (or one might say assembly platforms) because for the passengers leaving by train there is wide covered space to the north of the building, which to a certain extent serves the same purpose as the larger one, situated between the two wings of the building.  This latter is 348 ft long and 72 ft wide.  Although it has an analogue in space in front of the station at Redfern (Devonshire St) where arrivals from Sydney congregate, it differs in important respects from that one. Although a busy place, it will not be subject in the same way to the rush of arrivals and departures, and those using it will not only be better protected from the weather, from the hot and cold blasts and the damp that afflict the passengers at Redfern (Devonshire St), but they will have better opportunities for considering their whereabouts and looking up the traffic directions than they now enjoy.  Before them, in one line will be the barriers with openings leading on to the different platforms, and indicators plainly marked which can be read from a distance will show them the times and destinations of each departing train. The booking hall will, in accordance with modern practice be of a large size, namely 110 ft long by 54 ft broad by 36 ft high.  It is intended that it shall be a work of art and probably some special display of the latest style in station adornment will be found.\n\nWaiting rooms will be provided for both ladies and gentlemen and the best attention will be devoted towards giving those using them the latest and best designed lavatories and conveniences.  A barber's shop will be provided, accessible form the assembly platforms and to meet a demand that is often felt by those arriving by train and wishing to get rid of the dust of travelling, and to change their clothes so as to fit them to meet their friends or visit places of entertainment, there will be baths and dressing rooms... The refreshment buffet is nearly 60 ft long by a width of 41 ft, and will be got up in the latest style.  Adjoining is the ladies' and gentlemen's' dining and tea rooms 86 ft by 53, with separate entrances from the assembly platform, the serveries for which are in direct communication with the kitchens in the basement where every adjunct of the latest type is provided. The public telegraph and telephone offices...are situated in the west wing and are approached from the inside platform and also from the cab arrival platform on the outside.  The baggage room... is convenient to the cab arrival platform.  Two large lifts are provided in which the baggage is taken to the basement to be distributed through the subways and up the lifts to the various platforms.  On the other side of the arched opening to the platform is the cloak room...fitted up specially for the ready reception and delivery of parcels.  Lifts are provided for the reception and delivery of goods to large stores in the basement.\n\nAt the southern end of the west wing of the main building is situated the main parcels office  Here special facilities will be provided for parcels inwards and outwards; there is a separate road 40 ft wide, for inward and outward traffic, with all the necessary raised platforms, etc. Under the cab approach and departure roads, and facing Pitt Street, there will be 24 shops with colonnade in front...  There will also be nine similar shops in the basement of the main building facing the new street. On the upper floors of the building the Railway Commissioners and their officers will be accommodated. For the convenience and comfort of the staff, who are thus situated some distance from the centre of the town, a special dining-room and reading-room have been provided on the street level with access by lift and staircase from the offices above\".}}\n\nIn his lecture Henry Deane also discusses many of the technical aspects of the design including luggage handling, the lifts, the water towers, the train shed roof, which was subsequently deleted as a cost-cutting measure, the platforms and signalling. A novel method of luggage handling was designed for Central to \"get rid of the objectionable luggage-trolley, which is always frightening nervous people\".  A overhead luggage carrying system had been developed in England, however, in the case of Central station, \"the levels permit of its being carried on underground by means of subways and lifts at suitable points\".  The mail was also to be transferred by subway.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe train shed roof was to be designed to have a central span of 198&nbsp;ft with two sides spans of 78&nbsp;ft. Three pin trusses were to be employed, which where to be brought to the ground to provide intermediate support.  The roof was to be continuous.  This truss and roof configuration was to be based on that of the [[Union Station (St. Louis)|Union Station, St Louis]], visited by Deane in 1894.  Such a roof would have rivalled those of the major metropolitan termini in Europe and America. The platform area was to be double that of the earlier station and correspondingly double the number of passengers could be accommodated.  The maximum number of passengers that the Devonshire Street station could accommodate was 20,000; the new station would be able to accommodate 40,000. The location of the cab rank was also discussed, it having been decided not to incorporate a cab rank inside the building so that the new station could be \"kept entirely free from the smell, which the standing of horses under the roof must certainly involve\".<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe last train departed platform 5 of the 1874 station at midnight of 4 August 1906. During the remainder of that night, the passenger concourse was demolished and the line extended through the old station into the new station. The ''[[Western Mail (train)|Western Mail]]'' arrived at 05:50 on 5 August 1906 at the new station.<ref>{{cite book|last=Preston|first=Ronald George|year=1980|title=125 Years of the Sydney to Parramatta Railway|publisher=The New South Wales Rail Transport Museum|location=Burwood|isbn=0-909862-13-3|page=60}}</ref> Devonshire Street, which separated the two stations, became a pedestrian underpass to allow people to cross the railway line and is now known by many as the Devonshire Street Tunnel.<ref name=\"central history\"/>\n\nAn {{convert|85.6|m|ft|adj=mid|-tall}}<ref name=\"central history\"/> [[clock tower]] in the [[Australian non-residential architectural styles#Free Classical|Free Classical style]] was added at the north-western corner of the station, opening on 3 March 1921. The clock was designed by Richard Lamb and Alfred Fairfax, the co-founders of [[Fairfax & Roberts]].\n\n===Tram approaches and Belmore Park===\nOn a continuous axis with the first station building, Belmore Park originally fronted the first Hay and Corn Markets in Hay Street.  When the third station was located one block further north, it linked up with the southern side of Belmore Park.  The park then fortuitously provided a green foil to the commanding city front of the station.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nIn 1902 the Railway and Tramway Construction Branch, headed by Mr Deane, reported that \"plans and detail drawings have been prepared in the office for the whole of the retaining wall and shops in Pitt-Street, both north and south of the new road in front of the Station, also for the Devonshire-Street subway and for the whole of the basement floors, including drainage, telephone tunnels, &c.\"  At this stage, the estimated cost of the works was 561,600 pounds, however, it was \"probable that his estimate will be exceeded\".<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe necessary tramway deviations, 2 miles and 60 chains of track, were laid in 1901\u201302 using day labour.  The track consisted of rails laid on sleepers.  The curve and the poles were manufactured by local engineering firms including [[Clyde Engineering]] Co.  The Permanent Way (i.e. track) was imported either from England or America. The construction of the first stage of the station began in June 1902 and was completed in August 1906.  By 30 June 1903 the following works had been completed:<ref name=nswshr-1255-1255-1>Department of Public Works & Services, 1996, 25-28 & 39-72</ref><ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\n{{blockquote|\"....the total quantity earth removed is about 250,500 cubic yards.  This has been used to level up the station site as required.  Belmore Park has been raised to carry the tramways to the station... The Sports Grounds [[Moore Park, New South Wales|Moore Park]] (cycling ground) have been formed and the best of the clay had been disposed of to Messrs. Goodlet & Smith at their brickworks...  ...The whole of the foundations to the main buildings have been taken out and concreted.  On 21st July, 1902, the first order for building stone was given to Mr Saunders, at [[Pyrmont, New South Wales|Pyrmont]] Quarry.  On the 6th of August Inspector Murray went to Pyrmont Quarry to arrange for starting work dressing stone.  On the 7th August eleven masons started work, and on the 18th the first dressed stone was landed on the works from Pyrmont Quarry and was set in place on No. 3 Pier, arrival bridge, on the 19th August; and since that date 127,000 cubic feet have been built into place.\n\nThis stone has been used in the building of retaining wall, Pitt-street, between Hay-street and the Ambulance Depot, near Devonshire-street; the tramway arrival and departure bridges, the piers of which have been carried up to impost and girder-bed level.  Shop fronts and arcades in Pitt-street...the whole of [the] arcade with shop fronts and front wall to the main building from Pitt-street to the extreme eastern end of the building, including the east wing have been carried up to the first floor level.}}\n\nThe 1908 ''Royal Commission for the Improvement of the City of Sydney and its Suburbs'' offered two schemes which, in providing vehicular access, attempted to resolve the discrepancy in scale between Belmore Park and the station building.  The scheme presented by [[John Sulman]] consisted of two circular roadways, one above the other, around Belmore Park. The Commissioners, however, favoured a less grandiose Scheme prepared by Norman Selfe.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\n{{blockquote|\"Its main feature is the raising of Belmore Park to the level of the station platform between raised roads in the eastern half of a widened Pitt-street on the one hand and the western half of a widened Elizabeth-street on the other, with a connecting viaduct along Eddy-avenue and a retaining-wall to support the raised park along its Hay-street alignment\".}}\n\nAlthough neither scheme was attempted, Selfe's proposal is recalled in the Elizabeth Street ramp which was built in 1925 to allow the extension of an electric connection to the city.  The park, needless to say, was never raised to the height of the assembly platform.\n\n===Eastern fa\u00e7ade===\n[[File:Central Railway Station, Sydney (4750268718).jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Sydney Terminal before 1926, showing the simpler eastern section of the station. The eastern-most platforms (16-19) were replaced by the suburban through-platforms and viaduct in 1926.]]\nThe Elizabeth Street fa\u00e7ade of the Sydney Terminus has received less attention. Facing the working class terraces in [[Surry Hills, New South Wales|Surry Hills]], the eastern wing was finished in brick rather than stone when shortage of funds hurried completion of the first stage of the station in 1906. It was the obvious location for expansion when new platforms were added to the original complex to provide the electrical city and suburban connection in 1926.  The grand station building is eclipsed from view at street level by the Elizabeth Street ramp and the later semi-circular classical entrance portico to the city connection is in refined contrast to the rusticated blocks and heavy treatment of the main building.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\n===Battle of Central Station (1916)===\nA riot, dubbed the [[Liverpool riot of 1916|Battle of Central Station]], took place in 1916. Soldiers rebelling against camp conditions had raided hotels in [[Liverpool, New South Wales|Liverpool]] and travelled to the city by commandeered trains. Upon arrival at Central station, the rioters set about destroying the station facilities, and fire was exchanged between rampaging rioters and [[military police]]. One rioter was shot dead and several were injured. The only remaining evidence of the gun battle is a small bullet-hole in the marble by the entrance to platform 1.<ref>{{cite news |author=Baker, Jordan |title=The secret life of us&nbsp;\u2014 tunnel vision exposed |newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=2 August 2006}}</ref> This incident had a direct influence on the introduction of [[Six o'clock swill|6 o'clock closing]] of hotels in 1916, which lasted in New South Wales until 1955.<ref name=\"central history\"/>\n\n=== Electrification ===\nThe original proposal for electrification was for the [[North Shore railway line|North Shore line]], from [[Hornsby, New South Wales|Hornsby]] to {{NSWcity|Milsons Point}}, a separate line which could be electrified without impact on the remainder of the rail system. However, due to the necessity of building the City Underground Railway and the proposal for a [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]], not to mention the expansion of the [[Illawarra railway line|Illawarra]] and [[Bankstown railway line|Bankstown]] lines, the program was altered in order that the electrification could be linked with these proposed expansions. From Well Street, Redfern eight tracks would continue as the City Railway whilst four would carry the country trains to the Sydney Terminal. An above ground station would include a link to allow the transfer of passengers and baggage to the Sydney Terminal. This new station was constructed on the east side.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nSouth of the station buildings, additional works built to accommodate the electrification and expansion of the city and suburban lines included extensions to the [[Cleveland Street, Sydney|Cleveland Street]] Bridge and flyovers. The Devonshire Street subway and Devonshire Street wall were extended through the new suburban section. The new viaduct along Elizabeth Street included new bridges over Eddy Avenue, Campbell Street and Hay Street and a new retaining wall along Elizabeth Street.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\n=== Modernisation of Central Station ===\n[[File:Central Station milk bar, 1946 (4009463159).jpg|thumb|left|A [[milk bar]] inside Central station, {{circa|1946}}.]]\nModernisation programs were undertaken in 1955 and again in 1964. In the 1955 work, a booking hall was created (in the former refreshment room, now the railway bar). Murals depicting railway scenes lined the walls and a terrazzo map of Australia was installed on the floor. In October 1980 a modernisation program at the Sydney Terminal commenced. The objective of the work was to improve the facilities for both passenger convenience and comfort.  The start of this modernisation program coincided with the 125th Anniversary of the NSW Railways and it was at a time when many major service advances were being made to the State Rail System.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\n=== The Darling Harbour line ===\nIn addition to the construction of the main trunk line between Sydney and Parramatta in 1855, a branch line between Darling Harbour and the Sydney Yard, with a cutting and underpass to carry the line under George Street, was also constructed.  This line was to allow for the transfer of goods to be exported by ship, primarily wool bales. In the first decades of settlement goods were loaded and unloaded in [[Sydney Cove]], however, as the city expanded the wharves extended round into [[Cockle Bay (Sydney)|Cockle Bay]] (Darling Harbour). The presence of the rail link would have influenced the development of this harbour. The Darling Harbour Line was one of the first cuttings and overbridges to be constructed as part of the NSW Rail network. In contrast to later structures sandstone was used to line the walls of the underpass and to form the overbridge.  The Darling Harbour Line partially followed the line of an existing water course, the [[Blackwattle Creek]]. Subsequent alterations to the layout of Railway Square have resulted in extensions to the overbridge.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe line fell into disuse with the demise of Darling Harbour as a working harbour in the second half of the 20th century. Part of the railway, from Haymarket at Hay Street, near the [[Powerhouse Museum]] connecting to the [[Metropolitan Goods railway line]] to Lilyfield and Dulwich Hill, became part of the new light rail [[Dulwich Hill Line]]. Trams entering the city via the Dulwich Hill Line deviated from the Darling Harbour Line at Hay Street to run via surface streets to the Central station colonnade.\n\nFor a time, the remainder of the former Darling Harbour Line, from Sydney Yard to Hay Street, remained disused and functional, and was used to transfer trains to the Powerhouse Museum. Most of this section, from the Devonshire Street Tunnel to Hay Street, were converted to a pedestrianised linear park called \"[[The Goods Line]]\" in stages in 2012 and 2015.\n\nThe final part of the Darling Harbour Line, a tunnel under Railway Square, is intact but disused. There are proposals to also pedestrianise it.<ref name=\"Robertson\">{{cite news|last1=Robertson|first1=James|title=Sydney version of New York High Line to open between Central and Darling Harbour|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/a-dormant-goods-line-reconnects-sydneys-east-and-west-20150827-gj95kf.html|accessdate=11 September 2015|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=28 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== The Sydney Yard ===\nThe first Sydney railway workshop, constructed {{circa|1855}}, was a substantial two storey sandstone building with arched openings to both floors and a slate roof. A boiler, for the production of steam, was located at the southern end of the building. By 1865, a timber extension had been constructed over a section of track to allow the locomotives to be worked on under cover. A blacksmiths forge was located in an adjacent single storey building. In contrast with the first Redfern Station building (Sydney Terminal) the main workshop building was an elaborately detailed sandstone building, with a rock-faced ashlar base, quoins and sills.  The use of substantial and well-detailed sandstone buildings on the site was to continue with the construction of the twin-gabled goods shed, the Mortuary Station and finally the present station building and its approaches.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nOriginally the Sydney Yard occupied the area between the passenger station and the two storey workshop building. Initially, timber and corrugated iron sheds were built, however, these were soon replaced with more substantial masonry building.  Gable-ended locomotive and carriage workshops were built here.  Although no architectural drawings of these buildings have been located it is assumed that metal roof trusses and cast iron internal columns were used, similar to the structural system favoured in England, and later employed at [[Eveleigh, New South Wales|Eveleigh]]. Of these sheds, the most elaborate was the Second Goods Shed, built in the late 1860s.  The building was as, if not more, elaborate than many English examples.  It was unusual, even in the 19th century, for this level of decorative detail to be employed on such a utilitarian structure as a goods shed, the standard of building obviously representing the level of importance of the yard.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nExtensive facilities were required to keep the locomotives in good working order. The Sydney/Redfern yards were extended towards Elizabeth Street and the Exhibition Ground (Prince Alfred Park).  Until the construction of the railway workshops at Eveleigh in the mid-1880s the majority of the maintenance work was undertaken at the Sydney/Redfern Yard. In 1884 the yards included a gasworks ({{circa|1882}}), gas holder, a carriage works and the locomotive shop (by 1865). A turntable connected the now considerably extended main workshop building, one of the two blacksmiths shops and the repairing shed.  All of these structures have been demolished. Further towards the park, in the area now known as the Prince Alfred Sidings were located the carpenters shop, the second blacksmiths shop and an office. These buildings are the only remnants of the Sydney Yard.  Little physical evidence remains of the layout or the functioning of this once extensive railway yard as many of the structures were removed to allow for the construction of platforms 16-23 and subsequently the city electric station.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\n=== The Mortuary Station ===\n{{main|Regent Street railway station}}\n[[File:SLNSW 479607 104 Mortuary Redfern Front View SH 156.jpg|thumb|The Mortuary Station viewed from Regent Street]]\nThe Mortuary Station, or the Receiving House as it was known, was originally constructed for funeral parties, the mourners accompanying the coffin on the journey to the [[necropolis]] at [[Rookwood Cemetery]].  Most documentary sources date the building as being constructed in 1869, however, the outline of the station first appears on the 1865 MWS&DB (Metropolitan Water Sewerage & Drainage Board) plan. The rail lines had not yet been constructed. The inner Sydney cemetery or New Burial Ground, also known as the Sandhills or Devonshire Street station, was located in the Brickfields, a site now occupied by the main terminal building. By the 1840s this cemetery was overcrowded and a new location, in close proximity to a railway line, was required. In the early 1860s a site at Haslem's Creek was selected for the new cemetery.  To distinguish the cemetery from the surrounding residential area of Haslem's Creek the cemetery became known as the Rookwood Necropolis. A station was constructed within the Rookwood Necropolis.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe [[New South Wales Government Architect|Colonial Architect]] [[James Barnet]] designed both receiving houses (mortuary stations) in the mid 1860s. The station within the Necropolis has subsequently been relocated and modified to form the nave of [[All Saints Church, Canberra|All Saints Church of England]], {{ACTcity|Ainslie}}, [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]]. Although both stations are Gothic Revival in style, the plan and detailing of each varies considerably. Barnet's two station buildings were designed to celebrate the passage of the coffin to and from the train. In the Victorian Era, mourning the dead was a prolonged ritual with elaborate rules concerning behaviour and dress. The train trip to Rookwood became part of this ritual.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe regular funerary train service to the Rookwood Necropolis commenced in 1867, two years before Mortuary Central and the Rookwood Station had been completed. By 1908 there were four stations within the necropolis, named Mortuary Stations 1-4, with the Sydney receiving house being known as Mortuary Central. Mortuary Central was built by Stoddart & Medway from Pyrmont sandstone and completed in March 1869. The carvings were executed by Thomas Duckett and Henry Apperly.  From the variation claim submitted by the builders it would appear that a slightly larger building, with more decoration was built than originally intended. The form of the Mortuary Station, with the large porte-coch\u00e8re, clearly indicates that it is not a church. A colonnade of trefoil arches and foliated capitals forms a screen to the platform. The same arch form being employed for both ends of the platform and for the octagonal porte-coch\u00e8re to the west. The station building is above street level, with a flight of stairs leading to the platform level. Ramps to the north and south were used for carriages. Internally were the ticket office, two vestibules and retiring rooms.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nPhotographs taken in the early 1870s clearly show the decorative detail of the building. Two colours of stone were employed, a darker shade of the arches and the surrounds to the medallions, the lighter shade being reserved for the ashlar work. The two shades of stone were employed internally in the same manner. The arcade covering the platform is very elaborate, with its curved queen post truss roof, with ripple iron above following the curve, blind arcading to the west that mirrors the eastern arcade, and geometric tiled floor. Even the platform benches follow the Gothic Revival theme of the design, resembling pews.  This platform would have contrasted with the more utilitarian Redfern station building, designed by John Whitton and constructed in the early 1870s.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe stonework of the Mortuary Station was very delicately worked, with a number of different foliage motifs forming the capitals, the trefoil spandrel panel within the main arches and the medallions. A star and zig-zag motif was used on the soffit of the arch, ball flowers on the cornice brackets and a zig-zag on the cornice. The original roof covering was slate, with a pattern of half round and diamond slates being employed at the ridge and above the eaves.  The octagonal porte-coch\u00e8re terminates in a bell-cote, whose detail is a miniature of the main trefoil arch and medallion motif. The bellcote was roofed with lead. Decorative metalwork is also employed, as finals, as a cresting and as balustrades.  A leaf motif was used for the balustrade to the porte-coch\u00e8re and repeated in the panels of the elaborate timber gates that lead to the platform. A palisade fence that stepped down to follow the slope and matching gates separated the station from the street and a picket fence lined the ramps. The [[spire]] of Mortuary Station (the Bellcote) was a distinctive townscape element that could be seen from the Exhibition Grounds (Prince Alfred Park) and from Sydney University.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe arcade detail of Mortuary Central, with its pointed trefoil arches, medallions and foliated capitals, is reminiscent of the hotel at [[St Pancras Station]] by Sir [[George Gilbert Scott]], designed in 1865 and constructed in 1868\u201373. There are few other station buildings, either in Australia or the United Kingdom, with this level of decorative detail. The construction of special mortuary stations is rare, with no other examples having been located. The Mortuary station became part of the rail complex at Central after the new station was constructed in 1906, although it remained physically separate from the new station buildings.<ref name=\"nswshr2\"/>\n\nBy the late 1970s the station had deteriorated, slates were missing from the roof and the stonework, black from pollution, was also covered in graffiti.  A restoration program was undertaken in 1983.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\n=== The Railway Institute ===\nThe Railway Institute on Chalmers Street was constructed as a venue for the railway employees, providing a setting for both educational activities and social functions. It is reputed to be the first Railway Institute in Australia and provided a range of services for railway employees such as evening classes and a library. A competition was held for the design, which was won by the architect [[Henry Robinson (architect)|Henry Robinson]]. It is a Queen Anne Revival style building, based on English prototypes such as the London Board Schools. The design was the first use of Marseille roof tiles for public buildings in Australia.  Many public buildings were designed by competition c. 1890, during the period of transition between the Colonial and Government Architects Offices. The practice was abandoned in the mid-1890s due to the partiality of the judges.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nWhen the Railway Institute was constructed in 1891, the building was located on the corner of Devonshire Street and Elizabeth Street, at the northeastern corner of the Sydney rail yard. The surrounding streets and the carriage way have subsequently been modified.  A carriage-way lead to the porte-coch\u00e8re, enabling people attending social functions to enter the building without getting wet. In addition to the library there were two halls, a large hall, with a stage, and a smaller hall on the ground floor.  The detail of this space is largely intact and there are few examples of small scale halls of this period remaining in Sydney. A single storey addition to the building, designed by the Government Architect [[Walter Liberty Vernon]], was added in 1898 to the southeast of the main building.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nClasses, such as engineering drafting, and examinations for railway employees, were held in the Institute. The building was also utilised during emergencies such as the 1919 influenza epidemic when women volunteers manufactured face masks (for railway employees). There are few examples of Institutes of this period that provided such a high level of facilities for the benefit of the employees.  The names on the Honour Board reads as a who's who of railway personalities.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\n== Station layout ==\nCentral Railway Station has buildings concentrated on its northern boundaries that are fed by large rail yards behind.  Together they form part of the fabric of the city of Sydney and form boundaries to its inner suburbs.  The location of this station is on land that has been in continuous government use since the commencement of European settlement.  Various forms of public transport have radiated from this site since 1855.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\n=== Sydney Terminal building ===\n[[File:Central railway station Sydney Grand Concourse 201708.jpg|thumb|Eastward view of the Grand Concourse in 2017]]\n[[File:EternitycafeCentralSydney.jpg|thumb|Eternity Cafe within the Sydney Terminal building]]\nThe most prominent part of Sydney Central Station, visible from many parts of the City and surrounding area, is the 1906 sandstone main terminal building, referred to as the \"Sydney Terminal Building\" by railway staff. It is sited to dominate its surroundings and to mark the importance of the railways and its service to the state and the city.\n\nThe main concourse and platforms are elevated above the surrounding roads. This elevated siting also permits the use of the topography to gain road access to more than one level enabling the development of an extensive subterranean luggage network and separation of differing modes of transport.  The commanding position of the Terminus with large areas of open space sloping away from the building continues the public domain of Railway Square whilst maintaining a clear vista of the Terminus from the surrounding area. The Terminus, and in part the Parcels Post Office, create a formal edge to Railway Square.\n\nOn the main Eddy Avenue fa\u00e7ade, the Terminus comprises a [[colonnade]] and porte-coch\u00e8re, which originally provided an undercover area for passengers transferring to and from trams. After the removal of the original Sydney tram network, the upper level colonnade was used by motor vehicles, but it is now again used by trams on the [[Dulwich Hill Line]].\n\nThe main concourse, called the \"Main Assembly platform\", is located on the upper level and is the centre of the Terminus, around which all of the ancillary functions, such as refreshment rooms, waiting rooms and the booking hall, were arranged.  As originally built, the main terminal building also had terraces or \"decks\" on the east and west sides, which were accessible by vehicles. The main concourse \"platform\" was accessed from both the East and West deck. The main concourse is dominated by a large vaulted roof over the concourse and elaborate [[masonry]], primarily [[Sydney sandstone]].\n\nThe station opened on 5 August 1906 with 11 platforms, but was soon expanded to 15, and by 1913 had 19.<ref name=BulletinMar01>{{cite journal |title=Sydney's Electric Trains from 1926 to 1960 |journal=[[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]] |number=761 |date=March 2001 |pages=87, 94, 95 101 }}</ref> As part of the construction of the electrified city railway in the 1920s, the existing station was cut back to 15 platforms with new platforms built to the east of the existing station. As part of the project, platforms 10 to 15 were electrified, with platforms 1 to 9 following in 1956.<ref name=BulletinMar01/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Oakes|first1=John|title=Sydney's Central|date=2002|publisher=Australian Railway Historical Society|location=Redfern|isbn=0 909650 56 X|page=53}}</ref>\n\nThe current 15 Sydney Terminal platforms run perpendicular to the main station concourse and all are dead ended with the buffer stop. They are arranged as seven double platforms and one single platform, each with an [[awning]], servicing a total of 15 tracks.  Platforms 1\u20133 are for country and interstate services, while the remainder are for interurban services.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nPlatforms 1\u201310 have a centre run-round track, which was for locomotive-hauled trains.  It enabled the locomotive to uncouple from its train and either depart or re-couple on the other end to pull the train to the next destination.  There was extreme pressure on the speed to ready a train for the next destination due to the lack of platform space and a steady growth of rail patronage.  These centre lines are now used for storage of electric rail car sets in off peak times.  The platforms feature long timber-framed canopies over some of the platforms (incorporating Howe [[trusses]]).  Timber was used in lieu of steel because of the high cost at the time of importing steel.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe only locomotive hauled trains now using Sydney Terminal are the Indian Pacific and special trains which usually use Platform 1.  Platform 1 has always been the main out of Sydney Station with the longest platform.  Platforms 1 and 2\u20133 were lengthened to their present length in 1962 covering the skylights to the Devonshire Street Subway for diesel hauled trains like the Southern Aurora.  All long-distance [[NSW TrainLink]] [[New South Wales XPT|XPT]] and [[New South Wales Xplorer|Xplorer]] services and the [[Great Southern Rail (Australia)|Great Southern Rail]] ''[[Indian Pacific]]'' terminate at Central. These generally use Platforms 1 to 3, although when the ''Indian Pacific'' is in the station occupying both Platforms 2 and 3, some NSW TrainLink regional services use Platforms 4 to 12.\n\n=== Central Electric Station ===\n[[File:CentralStation2020January.jpg|thumb|Eddy Avenue entrance to the suburban platforms]]\nTo the east of the Sydney Terminal building are ten further platforms, used by suburban [[Sydney Trains]] services and by a limited number of NSW TrainLink intercity services during peak hours.\n\nAs part of the construction of the electrified city railway in the 1920s and the electrification and expansions of the Sydney suburban lines, the existing station was cut back to 15 platforms with new Platforms 16 to 23 built on the station's eastern side in 1926. The Electric Station was part of the construction works overseen by Bradfield that included the excavation of the tunnels, the building of the Harbour Bridge, and electrification of the suburban rail network.\n\nThe platforms continue north via a six-track viaduct paralleling [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney|Elizabeth Street]] built to the north, passing over Campbell Street and Hay Street, and ending at [[Goulburn Street]] where it enters tunnels to connect with the City Circle underground rail system and the North Shore over the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\n\nPlatforms 16 to 23 are also elevated, but are served by a lower level concourse at street level. Railway staff refer to this part of the station as the \"Central Electric Station\", or \"Central Electric System\". The two stations were managed and staffed as separate entities.<ref name=nswshr-1255/> This section of the station is also referred to as the \"suburban\" platforms. There are two major pedestrian entrances to Central Electric: one at Elizabeth Street and one at the top of Eddy Avenue ramp.  Both are constructed of Maroubra [[sandstone]] with classical detailing.<ref name=nswshr-1255/><ref name=cmp/>{{rp|page=92\u201397}}\n\nThe four island platforms allow four eight trains to use the station, four trains in each direction. South of these new platforms, a series of [[flying junction]]s were built. This involved the four southbound tracks passing beneath the northbound tracks with a series of [[Level junction|diamond crossings]] allowing trains to cross lines without impeding trains traveling in the opposite direction.<ref name=BulletinMar01/>\n\nIn February 1926, Platforms 18 and 19 of the steam station were wired for electric trains with a demonstration run from Sydney to [[Hurstville railway station|Hurstville]]. This wiring was transferred to Platforms 21 and 23 and Platforms 14 and 15 were wired for [[Bankstown railway station|Bankstown]] electric train services commencing October 1926 and later worked into [[St James railway station, Sydney|St James]]. As the [[Homebush railway station|Homebush]] electrification was completed, Platforms 17 and 18 were wired. Electric trains to [[Hornsby railway station|Hornsby]] via the main line commenced on 21 January 1929. Trains to Hornsby used Platforms 16 and 18. Steam services to [[Parramatta railway station|Parramatta]] and [[Liverpool railway station, Sydney|Liverpool]] were converted to electric in November 1929. Western electric trains began operating through to [[Wynyard railway station, Sydney|Wynyard]] from 28 February 1932.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=ARHS Bulletin|title=Unknown|year=1942|volume=56|pages=3}}</ref>\n\nTwo further underground platforms were built as part of the [[Eastern Suburbs railway line|Eastern Suburbs Railway]], bringing the total number of platforms in the suburban section to ten. Construction commenced in 1948 but the line was not finished until 1979. While the plans called for four platforms, two (for the Southern Suburbs line) were intended to be used in the future and have never been brought into service. They were for a time used for archival storage by the railways.\n\n===Metro station===\nA construction project began in 2018 to construct two new underground platforms to serve the [[Sydney Metro City & Southwest]], and a new underground concourse called Central Walk. The new platforms are being built beneath Platforms 13-14.<ref>{{cite web|title=$955 Million Central Walk, Sydney Metro Contract Awarded - securing more NSW jobs|url=https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/news-and-events/media-releases/955-million-central-walk-sydney-metro-contract-awarded-securing-more|publisher=Transport for NSW|accessdate=7 March 2018|date=7 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180307151229/https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/news-and-events/media-releases/955-million-central-walk-sydney-metro-contract-awarded-securing-more|archive-date=7 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In November and December 2018, Platforms 12/13 and 14/15 were demolished.

The underpass allows pedestrians to access the eastern \"suburban\" section from Railway Square and Chalmers Street.<ref>[http://www.sydneyarchitecture.com/SUB/SUB-08.htm Tunnelling Through the Past] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521180359/http://www.sydneyarchitecture.com/SUB/SUB-08.htm |date=21 May 2014 }} Sydney Architecture</ref> To the west, the tunnel continues under Railway Square and connects to [[The Goods Line]] &ndash; the former [[Darling Harbour Line]] railway line which has been converted to a park and pedestrian pathway to [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]] and [[Darling Harbour]].\n\n===Railway Square===\n{{main|Railway Square, Sydney}}\nThe western side of the Sydney Terminal building leads down to Railway Square, originally Central Square, at the junction of George and [[Pitt Street, Sydney|Pitt]] Streets. Although Railway Square no longer signifies the entrance to the interior of the colony, it has always channelled traffic from the southern parts of the city and out west to [[Parramatta]]. From the building of the first railway terminus at Devonshire Street in 1855, it was an important focus for the arrival of country persons to the city and later commuters into the city.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe importance of the relationship between the Sydney Terminus and Railway Square is reflected in the elevations of the main building. Here the dominating presence of the clock tower, completed in 1921, marked the arrival and departure times, the beginning and end of a workman's day. Before the spread of the suburbs, a workman could make a return trip home to eat dinner in his lunch hour.\n\n===Parcel Office building===\nTo the west of the southern end of Platform 1 is the Inwards Parcel Office.  This was the [[loading dock]] for parcels and mail from the post office.  The mail was loaded via a tunnel from the post office. The Parcels Post Office is an unusual urban building, being designed to be viewed from three sides.  Its symmetrical, boldly modelled elevations and its siting in the middle of an open space give it the presence of a public monument or sculpture.  Due to the oblique road approaches to the Railway Square this building forms a strong element within the Sydney Terminal Precinct.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe Parcel Office building is now an apartment-hotel, managed by Adina.\n\n=== Sydney Yards ===\nSouth of the Devonshire Street Tunnel, a large rail yard extends to the Cleveland Street Bridge, linking the Sydney Terminal platforms (1-15) with the railway lines extending west. The track layout to Platforms 1\u201315 have remained virtually unchanged since they were originally laid out in 1906. Major items from its period as a steam locomotive hauled train yard have been removed. These include the Eastern Carriage shed demolished in 1986, Coal Stages, and Engine Docks at the head of each platform.  Ash pits and water [[columns]] that were part of the yard have also been removed. There is only one \"yard controller\" remaining within the Yard.  Previously, at least two Signal Boxes would have been located in the Yard at any one time, but these have been removed due to the mechanical interlocking system being computerised and pneumatically operated.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe Yard buildings have been altered significantly since the Eastern Carriage Shed was demolished.  This large shed divided the central yard from the central electric lines.  The land where the shed once stood lay vacant until the construction projects begun in 2018. Remaining structures signifying the division of the yard are the Cleaners Amenities and the former Timetable Office with the garden. The Rail Yard connects to the passenger platforms of Sydney Terminal which are as originally designed and built, with the infrastructure for steam locomotives having been removed - these being water columns between each track near the buffers. However, the concrete [[plinth]]s remain.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe open space of the rail yards adds to the experience of arrival to the city from the north and south by opening up vistas to the imposing Sydney Terminal with its landmark tower.  This open space permits the imposing Terminus and its Tower to be visible when viewed from a distance much as it was intended when originally built.  The Terminus and its approaches define formal urban spaces in the city fabric.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\n=== Western Yard ===\nThe Western Rail Yard lies west of the westernmost main line track leading to Platform 1 (No. 1 Main Line), and extends to the Regent Street boundary to the west, Devonshire Street Subway to the north and Cleveland Street Bridge to the south. Until the construction project begun in 2018, the track layout of this yard had remained virtually unchanged since 1906. The rail sidings that take up the bulk of the land area were known as the \"Botany Road Yards\".  These siding lines are still in service but are seldom used. The lines were used as storage yards for making up passenger trains and for goods being loaded and unloaded at the Parcel and Goods Sidings.  This was a major activity at the Sydney Terminal that has become obsolete due to the introduction of technological changes such as fixed sets of rail cars, and the phasing out of locomotive-pulled trains. The [[Darling Harbour Line]] branch line formerly cut through the precinct providing access to Darling Harbour Goods Yard. This is no longer in use, and part of the former line is now [[the Goods Line]], a lineal park connected to Devonshire Street Tunnel.\n\nThe underpass and overbridge date from 1855. The Mortuary Station with its siding and platform is on the boundary of this rail yard, facing Regent Street, and is visible from Railway Square because of the low scale of buildings in the Western Yard. Rail access to the Mortuary Station was from the main lines near the Cleveland Street Bridge, and has remained in service since the mid-1860s.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nNearer to the present main station building were the West Carriage Shed, demolished in 1999.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Suburban Report |journal=[[Railway Digest]] |date=November 1986 |page=344}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Newsline |journal=[[Railway Digest]] |date=April 1999 |page=12 }}</ref> This was the last remaining carriage [[shed]] at Central Station.  The six rail lines that enter the shed were connected to the yard through tunnels at the end of Platform 1.\n\nThe Yard was designed for locomotive-hauled trains.  As this technology has gone out of use except for the ''Indian Pacific'' and Special Trains the yard has little present functional use.  With locomotive hauled trains the trains were marshalled for running in one direction. It has the locomotive at the head of the train and a brake van near the rear.  This meant that trains when ending their journey had to be remarshalled before commencing their journey out of Sydney Station.  The introduction of trains with driving positions at both ends of the train no longer require this process.  As the station originally handled locomotive hauled passenger trains for suburban, country and interstate service this activity was considerable.  Most of the steam loco facilities and trackwork has been removed. The decline in shunting and the removal of coal and water storage has seen a reduction in the level of activity in the yard. Although it has progressed through various configurations, the landscape has maintained the same ground level since 1856 with its final layout being enlarged in 1906 by the removal of some houses and the realignment of Regent Street to its present format.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\n===Parcel Dock===\nThe Parcel Dock was physically connected with the main station complex and had four platforms (two dock platforms) for the use of mail trains. Due to the decline of parcel delivery by rail, this was cut back to serve a [[motorail]] loading ramp (for the loading of automobiles) for the ''[[Indian Pacific]]''. The space where the mail sidings were is now a [[YHA Australia|Youth Hostels Association]] hostel named the Sydney Railway Square YHA. The hostel rooms are modelled on old train carriages.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.yha.com.au/hostels/nsw/sydney-surrounds/railway-square/ |title=Sydney Railway Square YHA |publisher=[[YHA Australia]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410201858/http://www3.yha.com.au/hostels/nsw/sydney-surrounds/railway-square/# |archive-date=10 April 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Former Prince Alfred Sidings ===\nThe Prince Alfred Sidings were formerly to the south of Platform 23 and on the eastern perimeter of the site, making up the boundary with Prince Alfred Park to the southeast.  The Prince Alfred or \"PA\" electric car sidings were built only after the flyovers. Prior to the construction of the electric lines, the yard was a goods yard containing Produce and Goods Sheds as well as the first carriage shed.  All have been removed from this precinct. The Yard is a small part of the original Sydney yard, of which a number of buildings remain which date from 1870.  Later additional buildings are associated with the 1926 Electric Suburban System.  The construction of the electric system reduced the width of the Prince Alfred Sidings, and trains within this yard needed to be protected because of vandalism.  The Electric Sub Station is part of the 1926 electrification works and is linked with the sub station at the Sydney Harbour Bridge.  It also contains air compressors for the operation of pneumatic points within the Yard and the City Circle Lines. A [[retaining wall]] forms the boundary with Prince Alfred Park; it has been incorporated into the rear wall of the blacksmiths workshops.  A number of mature trees are growing on the boundary, the largest being a Moreton Bay Fig at least 80 years old.<ref name=nswshr-1255/>\n\nThe Prince Alfred sidings were closed in August 1995 and then demolished to make way for the [[Airport railway line, Sydney|Airport line]], which enters a tunnel built into the retaining wall of Prince Alfred Park.<ref>{{cite journal |title=CityRail's New Timetable |journal=[[Railway Digest]] |date=August 1995 |page=13 }}</ref>\n\n==Platforms==\n[[File:Platform 20 and 21 at Central Station in Sydney.jpg|thumb|Platforms 20 and 21 in 2013]]\nCentral serves all Sydney suburban lines except for the [[Cumberland railway line|Cumberland Line]]. The platforms are numbered from 1 to 25, with 1 being the westernmost platform and 25 being one of the easternmost. Platforms 1 to 15 are above ground terminating at the Sydney Terminal Building. Platforms 16 to 23 are above ground and part of the suburban station to the east of the main building. Platforms 24 to 25 are underground. New platforms are being constructed under Platforms 13 and 14 to serve the future metro line.\n{{Central platform box}}\n\n==Connecting services==\n===Light rail===\n[[File:Central light rail station.JPG|thumb|The [[Dulwich Hill Line|Inner West Light Rail]] at Central]]\n[[File:L2LRServiceCentral.jpg|thumb|An L2 Light Rail service towards Randwick]]\n{{see also|Light rail in Sydney}}\nCentral Grand Concourse is the eastern terminus of the [[Dulwich Hill Line]] that operates to [[Chinatown, Sydney|Chinatown]], [[Darling Harbour]], [[Pyrmont, New South Wales|Pyrmont]] and the inner western suburbs.
