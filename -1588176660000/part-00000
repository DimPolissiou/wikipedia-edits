This page explains the principal systems for the rolling stock of the [[Central London Railway]] (CLR), the [[Underground Electric Railways Company of London]] (UERL), the [[District Railway]] (DR) and the [[Metropolitan Railway]] (MR). For information about individual classes of locomotives and other rolling stock, see [[London Underground rolling stock]].\n\n==Electric Multiple Units==\nThe numbering and classification of [[electric multiple unit]] stock on the [[London Underground]] is usually related to the type of line that the trains are used on in the central area of the network.\n\nSub-surface lines were built using the [[Tunnel#Cut-and-cover|cut-and-cover]] tunnelling method and use trains of similar size to those on the [[National Rail]] network. These are the [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle]], [[District line|District]], [[Hammersmith & City line|Hammersmith & City]], [[Metropolitan line|Metropolitan]] lines, and formerly the [[East London line|East London]] line.\n\nTube lines are deep-level lines, built to a more restricted [[loading gauge]] using circular [[tunnelling shield]]s or [[tunnel boring machine]]s. These are the [[Bakerloo line|Bakerloo]], [[Central line (London Underground)|Central]], [[Jubilee line|Jubilee]], [[Northern line|Northern]], [[Piccadilly line|Piccadilly]], [[Victoria line|Victoria]] and [[Waterloo & City line|Waterloo & City]] lines. Outside of the central area, both types of trains run on the surface.{{efn|In a number of cases, trains designed for tube lines run on surface routes originally built to mainline standards or for sub-surface trains:\n* Central line west of [[White City tube station|White City]] runs on tracks built by the [[Great Western Railway]], and north of [[Stratford station|Stratford]] by the [[Great Eastern Railway]];\n* Jubilee line north of [[Finchley Road tube station|Finchley Road]] runs on tracks built by the Metropolitan Railway;\n* Northern line north of [[Highgate tube station|Highgate]] runs on tracks built by the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]];\n* Piccadilly line west of [[Hammersmith tube station (Piccadilly and District lines)|Hammersmith]] runs on tracks built by the [[London and South Western Railway]], the District Railway and the Metropolitan Railway.}}\n\n===Unit Classification===\nThe method of classification depends on the type of line the train operates on:\n\n====Tube Stock====\nTube Stock is classified by the anticipated year of delivery at the time of ordering.{{efn|This sometimes proves optimistic, for example the [[London Underground 1992 Stock|1992 Stock]] did not become operational until 1993.}}\n\nThis system was inaugurated by the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] (LPTB) with the [[London Underground 1935 Stock|1935 Stock]]. The large number of broadly similar Tube trains built for the UERL during 1922-1934 were called (and are commonly still referred to as) [[London Underground Standard Stock|Standard Stock]] (officially re-christened Pre-1938 tube stock upon rehabilitation), although there were many detail differences. They replaced the UERL's original Gate Stock (itself known as Standard Stock before the introduction of the then-new Pre-1938 tube stock), introduced for the opening of the Bakerloo, Piccadilly and Hampstead (Northern) lines and the replacement of the [[City & South London Railway]]'s locomotive and carriage sets, the [[London Underground Watford Joint Stock|Watford Joint Stock]] of the Bakerloo, the [[Great Northern & City Railway]]'s surface gauge stock, and the CLR's [[London Underground 1900 and 1903 Stock|Tunnel Stock]] and [[London Underground 1900 and 1903 Stock#Ealing Stock|Ealing Stock]] (which in turn comprised DMs of 1903 and 1915 vintage constructed to replace locos hauling trailers of 1900 vintage).\n\n====Sub-surface Stock====\nSub-surface Stock is classified by a letter, usually issued sequentially, and which is sometimes followed by the last two digits of the year of delivery, e.g. [[London Underground G Stock|G23 Stock]]\n.\nThis system was commenced by the DR for its stock. When the LPTB was formed, the ex-Metropolitan Railway units were incorporated into this series (types MV, MW, T, V, VT and W). By 1960, most letters had been allocated, and the decision was taken to re-issue [[London Underground A60 and A62 Stock|A]] (for the Amersham electrification) to the new Metropolitan stock.{{sfn|Bruce|1979<!-- page number required -->}} The next sub-surface types were built for the Circle and District lines, and the opportunity was taken to allocate [[London Underground C69 and C77 Stock|C]] (for the Circle line) and [[London Underground D78 Stock|D]] (for the District line) respectively, omitting B.\n\n====Types of Unit====\nOn most lines, trains are formed from a pairing or triplet of units. Units are 'single-ended', where there is a driving cab at one end only, or 'double-ended', where there is a driving cab at both ends. In addition, some units have no driving cabs, and thus must always be included in the middle of a formation of units.\n\n===Car Classification===\nThe different types of car used to make up electric multiple units are referred to by a series of codes, described below:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Code!!Description\n|-\n|DM||'''D'''riving '''M'''otor car (with motors and a driving cab) \n|-\n|NDM||'''N'''on-'''D'''riving '''M'''otor car (motored, but with no driving cab)\n|-\n|UNDM||'''U'''ncoupling '''N'''on-'''D'''riving '''M'''otor car (as NDM, but with controls at one end to permit uncoupling and shunting, but not full driving facilities)\n|-\n|MS||'''M'''otor '''S'''hunting car (as NDM, but with provision to split from the adjacent MS as required in depots)\n|-\n|T||'''T'''railer car (no motors or driving cabs)\n|-\n|CT||'''C'''ontrol (or 'Driving') '''T'''railer car (with a driving cab, but no motors) \n|}\n\nOn most lines, the end cars of units are described as 'A' end cars or 'D' end cars ('B' end until the 1930s). In general, the 'A' end is the north or west end and the 'D' end is the south or east, but the reverse applies on the Bakerloo line. On lines with a loop at the end that allows trains to turn round (e.g. at [[Piccadilly line#Extension to Heathrow|Heathrow]] on the Piccadilly line and [[Kennington tube station|Kennington]] on the Northern line), this system cannot apply rigidly.\n\n===Car Numbering===\nEach car carries its own unique number (although many numbers below 10000 have been reused by newer cars after the withdrawal of older trains), and unit numbers are not applied. Although car numbers have been allocated in a variety of different series over the years, two basic principles can be identified:\n* A-end cars have even numbers and D-end cars have odd numbers; cars will usually be renumbered if they are turned to the opposite end. This principle was applied by the DR and continued by the LPTB.\n* Cars within a unit usually either share the same last two digits, or one end uses the next odd digit after the other end's even digit; frequently when cars are swapped between units they will be renumbered to maintain this approach.

This page explains the principal systems for the rolling stock of the [[Central London Railway]] (CLR), the [[Underground Electric Railways Company of London]] (UERL), the [[District Railway]] (DR) and the [[Metropolitan Railway]] (MR). For information about individual classes of locomotives and other rolling stock, see [[London Underground rolling stock]].\n\n==Electric Multiple Units==\nThe numbering and classification of [[electric multiple unit]] stock on the [[London Underground]] is usually related to the type of line that the trains are used on in the central area of the network.\n\nSub-surface lines were built using the [[Tunnel#Cut-and-cover|cut-and-cover]] tunnelling method and use trains of similar size to those on the [[National Rail]] network. These are the [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle]], [[District line|District]], [[Hammersmith & City line|Hammersmith & City]], [[Metropolitan line|Metropolitan]] lines and the former [[East London line|East London]] line.\n\nTube lines are deep-level lines, built to a more restricted [[loading gauge]] using circular [[tunnelling shield]]s or [[tunnel boring machine]]s. These are the [[Bakerloo line|Bakerloo]], [[Central line (London Underground)|Central]], [[Jubilee line|Jubilee]], [[Northern line|Northern]], [[Piccadilly line|Piccadilly]], [[Victoria line|Victoria]] and [[Waterloo & City line|Waterloo & City]] lines. Outside of the central area, both types of trains run on the surface.{{efn|In a number of cases, trains designed for tube lines run on surface routes originally built to mainline standards or for sub-surface trains:\n* Central line west of [[White City tube station|White City]] runs on tracks built by the [[Great Western Railway]], and north of [[Stratford station|Stratford]] by the [[Great Eastern Railway]];\n* Jubilee line north of [[Finchley Road tube station|Finchley Road]] runs on tracks built by the Metropolitan Railway;\n* Northern line north of [[Highgate tube station|Highgate]] runs on tracks built by the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]];\n* Piccadilly line west of [[Hammersmith tube station (Piccadilly and District lines)|Hammersmith]] runs on tracks built by the [[London and South Western Railway]], the District Railway and the Metropolitan Railway.}}\n\n===Unit Classification===\nThe method of classification depends on the type of line the train operates on:\n\n====Tube Stock====\nTube Stock is classified by the anticipated year of delivery at the time of ordering.{{efn|This sometimes proves optimistic, for example the [[London Underground 1992 Stock|1992 Stock]] did not become operational until 1993.}}\n\nThis system was inaugurated by the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] (LPTB) with the [[London Underground 1935 Stock|1935 Stock]]. The large number of broadly similar Tube trains built for the UERL during 1922-1934 were called (and are commonly still referred to as) [[London Underground Standard Stock|Standard Stock]] (officially re-christened Pre-1938 tube stock upon rehabilitation), although there were many detail differences. They replaced the UERL's original Gate Stock (itself known as Standard Stock before the introduction of the then-new Pre-1938 tube stock), introduced for the opening of the Bakerloo, Piccadilly and Hampstead (Northern) lines and the replacement of the [[City & South London Railway]]'s locomotive and carriage sets, the [[London Underground Watford Joint Stock|Watford Joint Stock]] of the Bakerloo, the [[Great Northern & City Railway]]'s surface gauge stock, and the CLR's [[London Underground 1900 and 1903 Stock|Tunnel Stock]] and [[London Underground 1900 and 1903 Stock#Ealing Stock|Ealing Stock]] (which in turn comprised DMs of 1903 and 1915 vintage constructed to replace locos hauling trailers of 1900 vintage).\n\n====Sub-surface Stock====\nSub-surface Stock is classified by a letter, usually issued sequentially, and which is sometimes followed by the last two digits of the year of delivery, e.g. [[London Underground G Stock|G23 Stock]]\n.\nThis system was commenced by the DR for its stock. When the LPTB was formed, the ex-Metropolitan Railway units were incorporated into this series (types MV, MW, T, V, VT and W). By 1960, most letters had been allocated, and the decision was taken to re-issue [[London Underground A60 and A62 Stock|A]] (for the Amersham electrification) to the new Metropolitan stock.{{sfn|Bruce|1979<!-- page number required -->}} The next sub-surface types were built for the Circle and District lines, and the opportunity was taken to allocate [[London Underground C69 and C77 Stock|C]] (for the Circle line) and [[London Underground D78 Stock|D]] (for the District line) respectively, omitting B.\n\n====Types of Unit====\nOn most lines, trains are formed from a pairing or triplet of units. Units are 'single-ended', where there is a driving cab at one end only, or 'double-ended', where there is a driving cab at both ends. In addition, some units have no driving cabs, and thus must always be included in the middle of a formation of units.\n\n===Car Classification===\nThe different types of car used to make up electric multiple units are referred to by a series of codes, described below:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Code!!Description\n|-\n|DM||'''D'''riving '''M'''otor car (with motors and a driving cab) \n|-\n|NDM||'''N'''on-'''D'''riving '''M'''otor car (motored, but with no driving cab)\n|-\n|UNDM||'''U'''ncoupling '''N'''on-'''D'''riving '''M'''otor car (as NDM, but with controls at one end to permit uncoupling and shunting, but not full driving facilities)\n|-\n|MS||'''M'''otor '''S'''hunting car (as NDM, but with provision to split from the adjacent MS as required in depots)\n|-\n|T||'''T'''railer car (no motors or driving cabs)\n|-\n|CT||'''C'''ontrol (or 'Driving') '''T'''railer car (with a driving cab, but no motors) \n|}\n\nOn most lines, the end cars of units are described as 'A' end cars or 'D' end cars ('B' end until the 1930s). In general, the 'A' end is the north or west end and the 'D' end is the south or east, but the reverse applies on the Bakerloo line. On lines with a loop at the end that allows trains to turn round (e.g. at [[Piccadilly line#Extension to Heathrow|Heathrow]] on the Piccadilly line and [[Kennington tube station|Kennington]] on the Northern line), this system cannot apply rigidly.\n\n===Car Numbering===\nEach car carries its own unique number (although many numbers below 10000 have been reused by newer cars after the withdrawal of older trains), and unit numbers are not applied. Although car numbers have been allocated in a variety of different series over the years, two basic principles can be identified:\n* A-end cars have even numbers and D-end cars have odd numbers; cars will usually be renumbered if they are turned to the opposite end. This principle was applied by the DR and continued by the LPTB.\n* Cars within a unit usually either share the same last two digits, or one end uses the next odd digit after the other end's even digit; frequently when cars are swapped between units they will be renumbered to maintain this approach. This principle was introduced by the LPTB.\n\n====1931 Numbering Series====\nIn 1931, the UERL began a major renumbering of all its multiple unit cars. The series was adopted by the LPTB in 1933 and renumbered stock inherited from the MR was incorporated into the UERL's series. The table below shows the number ranges used for the inherited stock and initially used by the UERL/LPTB for new stock (including the LPTB-designed M and N Stock and Q38 Stock DM cars - Q38 Stock trailers were allocated numbers in one of the new numbering series described later):\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Number Series!!Car Type!!Line Type!!Numbers for Inherited Stock!!Numbers for New Stock!!Numbers for Converted Stock\n|-\n|1-37||align=center|DM||rowspan=3 align=center|Sub-surface<br>ex-DR||rowspan=3|Surviving unrefurbished B Stock (not renumbered in 1931)||||\n|-\n|1000\u20131094||align=center|T||||\n|-\n|1700\u20131717||align=center|CT||||\n|-\n|2000-2999||rowspan=3 align=center|DM||align=center|Sub-surface<br>ex-MR||2200-2247 Hammersmith line stock<br>2500-2769 Main line stock{{efn|Cars 2752 and 2707 were renumbered to 17000 and 20000 in 1946/1947 for testing as prototypes for A Stock. 17000 was renumbered 17001 following further modifications.}}<br>2900-2940 Northern City line stock||||\n|-\n|3000-3999||align=center|Tube||3000-3069 and 3282-3688 ex-[[London Electric Railway|LER]]<br>3912-3999 ex-CLR||3070-3281<br>3689-3721||3723-3784 DM cars that changed ends\n|-\n|4000-4999||align=center|Sub-surface<br>ex-DR||4000-4390 and 4591-4645||4391-4437||4620-4642 (evens) ex-CT cars\n|-\n|5000-5999||rowspan=3 align=center|CT||align=center|Tube||5000-5359 ex-LER<br>5928-5999 ex-CLR||||\n|-\n|6000-6199||align=center|Sub-surface<br>ex-DR||6000-6022||||6100-6109 ex-DM cars\n|-\n|6200-6999||align=center|Sub-surface<br>ex-MR||6201-6264 Hammersmith line stock<br>6500-6735 Main line stock<br>6900-6919 Northern City line stock||||6558/6559/6561/6562 ex-trailers<br>6736-6755 ex-hauled stock\n|-\n|7000-7999||rowspan=3 align=center|T||align=center|Tube||7000-7059 and 7190-7570 ex-LER<br>7901-7999 ex-CLR||7060-7189||\n|-\n|8000-8999||align=center|Sub-surface<br>ex-DR||8000-8048 Composites<br>8200-8258 ex-DM cars<br>8500-8535<br>8700-8780 ex-DM cars||8049-8083 Composites<br>8781-8785||8084-8095 Composites, ex-Third class<br>8786-8799 ex-DM cars<br>8801-8812 ex-Composites<br>8813-8848 & 8900-8904 ex-DM cars\n|-\n|9000-9999||align=center|Sub-surface<br>ex-MR||9200-9259 Hammersmith line stock<br>9400-9799 Main line stock<br>9582-9599 ex-DM cars<br>9900-9968 Northern City line stock||||9479-9482 ex-CT cars<br>9800-9844 ex-hauled stock\n|}\n\n'''Notes:''' \n* Ex-MR hauled stock retained their original numbers as they did not conflict with any of the numbers allocated to the multiple unit stock; they were all numbered between 41 and 510 (511-519 were later allocated to cars converted from multiple unit to hauled stock).\n* A 'Composite' car had both First and Third class seating. All Tube stock was Third class only; all ex-DR stock was Third class except those trailers identified as Composite. In the ex-MR ranges First class stock took the lowest numbers, then Composites, then Third class.

This custom dates back to 1561, when king [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]], aged 10, waiting for his accession to the throne, gave a lily of the valley to all ladies present. Today, the fiscal administration exempts individuals and workers' organizations from any tax or administrative duties related to the sales of lilies of the valley, provided they are gathered from the wild, and not bought to be resold.\n\n====Germany====\nIn April 1933, the recently installed [[Nazi Germany|Nazi government]] declared 1 May the \"Day of National Work\", an official state holiday, and announced that all celebrations were to be organized by the government. Any separate celebrations by communists, social democrats or [[trade union|labour union]]s were banned.{{cn|date=April 2020}} After [[World War II]], 1 May remained a state holiday in both [[East Germany|East]] and [[West Germany]].

After police actions against radical leftists in that year's annual demonstrations, the Autonome scattered and sought cover at the ongoing annual street fair in [[Kreuzberg]]. Three years prior to the [[reunification of Germany]], violent protests would only take place in the former [[West Berlin]]. The protesters began tipping over police cars, violently resisting arrest, and began building [[barricade]]s after the police withdrew due to the unforeseen resistance. Cars were set on fire, shops plundered and burned to the ground. The police eventually ended the riots the following night. These violent forms of protests by the radical left, later increasingly involved participants without political motivation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=April 2005|title=Geschichte des Kreuzberger 1.

They opposed economic reforms, an end to job losses and wage cuts in the face of the government's proposals of massive public spending cuts. These reforms are to fall in line with the IMF-EU-ECB loan proposals, which demand that Greece liberalize its economy and cut its public spending and private sector wages, which many believe will decrease living standards.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8655711.stm | work=BBC News | title=Protesters confront Greek police | date=1 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Hungary====\nHungary celebrates 1 May as a national holiday, with open-air festivities and fairs all over the country.

Most people celebrate together with friends and family, organising [[picnic]]s and [[barbecue]]s.

The following year, after the [[Bolshevik]] [[October Revolution|seizure of power]], the May Day celebrations were boycotted by [[Mensheviks]], [[Left Socialist Revolutionaries]] and [[anarchism in Russia|anarchists]]. It became an important official holiday of the Soviet Union, celebrated with elaborate popular parade in the centre of the major cities. The biggest celebration was traditionally organized in [[Red Square]], where the [[General Secretary of the CPSU]] and other party and government leaders stood atop [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] and waved to the crowds. Until 1969, the holiday was marked by [[military parade]]s throughout the [[RSFSR]] and the union republics.<ref>https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/parades-may-day.htm</ref> In 1991, which preceded the last year that demonstrations were held in Red Square, May Day grew into high-spirited political action. Around 50,000 people participated in a rally in Red Square in 1991 after which the tradition was interrupted for 13 years. In the early post-Soviet period the holiday turned into massive political gatherings of supporters of radically minded politicians. For instance, an action dubbed as \"a rally of communist-oriented organisations\" was held in Red Square in 1992. The rally began with performance of the Soviet Union anthem and raising the Red Flag and ended with appeals from the leader of opposition movement Working Moscow, Viktor Anpilov, \"for early dismissal of President Boris Yeltsin, ousting [[Moscow Mayor]] [[Gavriil Kharitonovich Popov|Gavriil Popov]] from power and putting the latter on trial\". Since 1992, May Day is officially called \"The Day of Spring and Labour\", and remains a major holiday in present-day Russia.\n\nSince 2014 a national civil parade is held on that day on Red Square with similar events held in major cities and regional capitals.\n\n====Serbia====\nIn Serbia, 1 May (and also 2 May) is a day off work and a day out of school. It is one of the major popular holidays, and the only official holiday from socialist times that is still officially celebrated. People celebrate it all over the country. By tradition 1 May is celebrated by countryside picnics and outdoor barbecues. May is marked by warm weather in Serbia. In [[Belgrade]], the capital, most people go to {{lang|sr|[[Avala]]|italic=no}} or {{lang|sr|[[Ko\u0161utnjak]]|italic=no}}, which are parks located in {{lang|sr|Rakovica|italic=no}} and {{lang|sr|\u010cukarica|italic=no}}.

The crowd was the biggest in Turkish workers' history with the number of people approximating 500,000.

Still, demonstrations continued with small crowds, and in 1996, three people were killed by police bullets, and a plain-clothes man who spied in the crowd was revealed and lynched by workers. On the same evening, a video broadcast on TV showed that two participants in the demonstration were lynched by far right-wing nationalist groups and this lynching occurred in front of police forces who were watching the scene with happy faces.

The protesters began tipping over police cars, violently resisting arrest, and began building [[barricade]]s after the police withdrew due to the unforeseen resistance.

These two dates combined often result in a [[long weekend]] called {{lang|pl|Maj\u00f3wka}}, which may last for up to 9 days from 28 April to 6 May, at the cost of taking only 3 days off.

After the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], 1 May continues to be an official public holiday, but without any state organized events or parades. Most people celebrate together with friends and family, organising [[picnic]]s and [[barbecue]]s.

The following year, after the [[Bolshevik]] [[October Revolution|seizure of power]], the May Day celebrations were boycotted by [[Mensheviks]], [[Left Socialist Revolutionaries]] and [[anarchism in Russia|anarchists]]. It became an important official holiday of the Soviet Union, celebrated with elaborate popular parade in the centre of the major cities. The biggest celebration was traditionally organized in [[Red Square]], where the [[General Secretary of the CPSU]] and other party and government leaders stood atop [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] and waved to the crowds. Until 1969, the holiday was marked by [[military parade]]s throughout the [[RSFSR]] and the union republics.<ref>https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/parades-may-day.htm</ref> In 1991, which preceded the last year that demonstrations were held in Red Square, May Day grew into high-spirited political action. Around 50,000 people participated in a rally in Red Square in 1991 after which the tradition was interrupted for 13 years. In the early post-Soviet period the holiday turned into massive political gatherings of supporters of radically minded politicians. For instance, an action dubbed as \"a rally of communist-oriented organisations\" was held in Red Square in 1992. The rally began with performance of the Soviet Union anthem and raising the Red Flag and ended with appeals from the leader of opposition movement Working Moscow, Viktor Anpilov, \"for early dismissal of President Boris Yeltsin, ousting [[Moscow Mayor]] [[Gavriil Kharitonovich Popov|Gavriil Popov]] from power and putting the latter on trial\". Since 1992, May Day is officially called \"The Day of Spring and Labour\", and remains a major holiday in present-day Russia.\n\nSince 2014 a national civil parade is held on that day on Red Square with similar events held in major cities and regional capitals.\n\n====Serbia====\nIn Serbia, 1 May (and also 2 May) is a day off work and a day out of school. It is one of the major popular holidays, and the only official holiday from socialist times that is still officially celebrated. People celebrate it all over the country. By tradition 1 May is celebrated by countryside picnics and outdoor barbecues. May is marked by warm weather in Serbia.

The crowd went to hear speeches by the leading figures in the [[Swedish labour movement]] such as [[Hjalmar Branting]] (later [[prime minister]]), [[August Palm]] and [[Hinke Bergegren]].

This is equal in practice to an official public holiday, but is not based on federal law and cantonal regulations may differ in details.\n* In the canton of [[Canton of Solothurn|Solothurn]] it is an official half-day holiday (starting at 12 noon).\n* In the canton of {{lang|fr|[[Canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]]|italic=no}}, public servants get the afternoon off, many companies follow this practice.\n* In the canton of {{lang|de|[[Aargau]]|italic=no}} it is not an official holiday, but most employees get the afternoon off.\n* In the municipalities of {{lang|de|[[Hildisrieden]]|italic=no}} and {{lang|de|[[Sch\u00fcpfheim]]|italic=no}} (both in the canton of [[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]]) as well as in {{lang|de|[[Muotathal]]|italic=no}} (canton of {{lang|de|[[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]]|italic=no}}), 1 May is an official public holiday, but as commemoration day of the local [[patron saint]], not as Labour Day.

In 2010, the Turkish government restored the holiday after some casualties and demonstrations.

After the establishment of the Turkish Republic, it became an official holiday. In 1924, it was forbidden by a decree and in both 1924 and 1925, demonstrations were intervened by arm floats. In 1935, The National Assembly declared Workers' Day to be a holiday again.<ref name=\"marksist.com\">[http://www.marksist.com/utku_kizilok/isgunu_mucadelesi_ve_1_mayis_in_dogusu.htm \u0130\u015fg\u00fcn\u00fc M\u00fccadelesi ve 1 May\u0131s\u2019\u0131n Do\u011fu\u015fu | s\u0131n\u0131f m\u00fccadelesinde Marksist Tutum].

The crowd was the biggest in Turkish workers' history with the number of people approximating 500,000. In the next two years, provocations and confusion continued and peaked before the 1980 coup d'etat. The Workers' Day holiday was cancelled once again. Still, demonstrations continued with small crowds, and in 1996, three people were killed by police bullets, and a plain-clothes man who spied in the crowd was revealed and lynched by workers. On the same evening, a video broadcast on TV showed that two participants in the demonstration were lynched by far right-wing nationalist groups and this lynching occurred in front of police forces who were watching the scene with happy faces. Thus, 1 May 1996 has been remembered by workers' movements.<ref name=\"marksist.com\"/>\n\nIn 2007, the 30th anniversary of the [[Taksim square massacre]], leftist workers' unions wanted to commemorate the massacre in Taksim square. Since the government would not let them into the square, 580\u2013700 people were stopped and 1 person died under police control. After these events, the government declared 1 May as \"Work and Solidarity Day\" but not as a holiday. In the next year, the day was declared as a holiday, but people were still not allowed to gather in Taksim Square.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090531134748/http://rega.basbakanlik.gov.tr/eskiler/2009/04/20090427-1.htm Ulusal bayram ve genel tati\u0307ller hakk\u0131nda kanunda]. rega.basbakanlik.gov.tr (22 April 2009).</ref> The year 2008 was remembered with police violence in Istanbul.

It is followed by the five-part sequel series '''Dragonwatch'''.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nThe series begins as 13-year-old Kendra and 11-year-old Seth Sorenson are traveling to their Grandpa and Grandma Sorenson's house while their parents are away on a 17-day cruise.  When they get there, they also meet Dale, the groundskeeper, and Lena, the housekeeper.  Grandma Sorenson is \"mysteriously\" missing.  Grandpa Sorenson does not tell Kendra and Seth about Fablehaven being a secret preserve for magical creatures at first, but instead sets up a rather complex puzzle involving six keys and a locked journal for Kendra to solve.  Once Kendra unlocks the mostly blank journal, she discovers the words \"Drink the milk.\" She and Seth drink the magical milk opening their eyes to a whole new, mystical world full of the magical beings of Fablehaven. Then Kendra and Seth must face challenges such as defeating an evil witch and a powerful demon, defending the preserve from an evil society, stopping a plague that changes creatures of light into creatures of darkness, and ultimately, protecting the world from a horde of imprisoned demons.\n\n== Motifs ==\n\n;'''[[List of Fablehaven animals|Magical creatures]]''':Fablehaven is home to a wide variety of magical creatures. Both creatures of light, such as fairies, nymphs, satyrs, unicorns, and centaurs, and dark or inherently evil beings, such as trolls, goblins, ogres, imps, and a few demons. A magical treaty protects all creatures, including humans outside creatures' domains, so long as the laws of the treaty are kept, the humans and magical beings are safe. Grandpa Sorensen explains to Kendra and Seth that some creatures are helpful, like Hugo the golem, and some are mischievous, but playful, like the satyrs. But he warns them that none of them are good in the way we think of good, and many of them are dangerous and will kill them if given the chance. \n\n;'''[[List of Magical Items in Fablehaven|Magical items]]''': Many magical items are used in the series. They range from the simple but interesting, such as a silver ball with a distraction spell on it, to the amazingly powerful, such as the five magical artifacts hidden on the five secret preserves, which if used together would unlock the demon prison.\n\n== Books ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! # !!

At first, the siblings entertain themselves with an attic full of interesting books and toys, and a pond-like swimming pool surrounded by hummingbirds, brightly colored-butterflies and exotic dragonflies that seem too beautiful to be real. But soon their attention wander to the forbidden forest that surrounds their grandparent's house. When Kendra discovers a book entitled Journal of Secrets and follows the directions to \"Drink the milk\" that is supposedly very poisonous, a whole new hidden and amazingly mysterious world is revealed to the siblings at Fablehaven. Kendra and Seth find out quickly how dangerous this new magical environment is when rules are broken, thrusting them into the middle of a fight for their lives.\n\n=== ''Fablehaven: Rise of the Evening Star'' ===\nThe second book returns us to the Sorenson siblings the following year, where a strange new student has infiltrated the school in disguise, causing mischief and Kendra is the only one who can see the charade. The Society of the Evening Star, an ancient organization determined to overthrow magical preserves and use them for their own intents and purposes, is on the move and is determined to infiltrate Fablehaven. New characters are introduced who mentor Kendra and Seth with their knowledge of magical potions, animals, and magical items. In addition, these three specialists have a more perilous assignment\u2014find an artifact of great power hidden on the grounds. When the Evening Star pervades the gates of Fablehaven, it is assumed that someone inside the preserve is a traitor. But who? If the artifact falls into the wrong hands, it could mean the downfall of other preserves and possibly the world.\n\n=== ''Fablehaven: Grip of the Shadow Plague'' ===\nThe third book starts where the second book ended, during the same summer of their second year at Fablehaven. Seth discovers that someone, or something, has released a plague that transforms beings of light into creatures of darkness. For the first time, some of the main characters visit another magical preserve, as another hidden artifact must be recovered from Lost Mesa in Arizona. New friends are introduced and new magical creatures of light and darkness are confronted, and hard sacrifices made.\n\n=== ''Fablehaven: Secrets of the Dragon Sanctuary'' ===\nThings are heating up between the Knights of the Dawn and the Society of the Evening Star, who turn to kidnapping Kendra in an attempt to discover secrets. The race to obtain the 5 magical artifacts continues, and leads the Knights, and the Sorensons, to a deadly dragon Sanctuary called Wyrmroost. They face bigger challenges than they've ever faced before, including negotiating with a wizard, an enormous evil dragon, and the biggest giant in the world.\n\n=== ''Fablehaven: Keys to the Demon Prison'' ===\nThe final book in the series has the Sorenson siblings traveling to different preserves around the earth in the attempt to secure the remaining magical artifacts before the Society gets them.  A powerful new ally joins the fight, but deadly new enemies also add to the escalation.  The conflict separates Kendra and Seth who take on different missions, each extremely dangerous and exciting.  They finally reunite just before the confrontation at Zzyzx, and the opening of the demon prison.  An unexpected event orchestrated by the Fairy Queen was their only hope to save the world. She traps the demons in her realm while claiming Zzyzx as her new kingdom which is three times bigger than her old one.\n\n=== ''Dragonwatch'' ===\nIn the new series, it's been four months since the Demon Prison was closed by Kendra and Seth, with help from the Knights of the Dawn, the Fairy Queen and her subjects, and the Dragons of Wyrmroost.  Agad the wizard had to cut a deal with Celebrant the Just, King of Dragons to gain their assistance, and he was made a co-caretaker of the sanctuary.  Now Celebrant is restless to gain more control and to ultimately release the dragons from their confinement.  Draconic unrest is happening at all the dragon sanctuaries, and Agad was called away to assist at Soaring Cliffs, leaving an opening at Wyrmroost.  The caretaker must be a Dragon Tamer, and Kendra and Seth qualify when in contact with each other.  As the new caretakers of Wyrmroost, the siblings struggle not only for acceptance among the current Blackwell Keep inhabitants, but attempt to complete a desperate mission to strengthen the defenses of the castle, securing the safety of the inhabitants within, and the world beyond.\n\n=== ''Dragonwatch: Wrath of the Dragon King'' ===\nCelebrant invites Kendra and Seth to a yearly sanctuary feast. After receiving guidance Kendra and Seth agree to attend. However, it is all part of a trap Celebrant has set up. Celebrant uses the feast to declare that war against the humans and also reveals that the second of seven dragon sanctuaries has fallen. Now Kendra and Seth must figure out a way to deal with a new deadly enemy, the Dark Unicorn Ronodin, while dealing with their first summer solstice at Wyrmroost. Making matters worse is a cursed castle that could hold secrets to help them or ruin them all; making matters even worse, Knox and Tess learn the secrets of Fablehaven and Knox finds a way to take the two of them to Wyrmroost all while the war is occurring. Knox is tricked into leaving the Fablehaven keys behind with a goblin, but it causes a huge entrance weakness to Wyrmroost when the barrel disappears stranding everyone there. Kendra, Seth, and others venture into a cursed castle called Stormguard on the summer solstice, to fight for the legendary Wizenstone in a tournament started by Humbuggle the dwarf.\n\n=== ''Dragonwatch: Master of the Phantom Isle'' ===\nCursed by the Key of Forgetting, Seth has lost all memory of his past\u2014his relationships, his experiences, and who he really is. For now he will align with his new mentor, Ronodin, the dark unicorn, who takes him to the Phantom Isle, the secret gateway to the Under Realm. Though Seth is not formally a prisoner, Ronodin wants to use him and his shadow charmer powers for his own dark ends. Kendra is frantic to find her missing brother, but the quest will take her and her companions, including Warren, Tanu, and Vanessa, far from Wyrmroost to Crescent Lagoon\u2014a recently fallen dragon sanctuary made up of many islands and underwater domains. Its caretaker has regained a foothold on one of the islands. If Kendra and her friends can save that sanctuary, they might uncover the answers they need to rescue Seth. With each sanctuary the dragons overthrow, Celebrant, the Dragon King, comes closer to the dawn of a new Age of Dragons. With the forces of darkness on the march, can Kendra and her allies gather enough power to win the epic dragon war?\n\n== Dragonwatch series ==\nIn 2013, Brandon Mull announced there would be a five book sequel series that would pick up right where ''Keys to the Demon Prison'' left off. It features the same world and characters, but with several new characters, and is titled ''Dragonwatch''. The series is based on the rivalry between Demon and Dragon, with Kendra and Seth caught in the middle.  ''Dragonwatch'' is the anciently established coalition made up of wizards, sorceresses, and dragon slayers, to keep the dragons from taking over the earth.  Book one was released on March 14, 2017, from Shadow Mountain Publishing.\n\n== Reception ==\nThe series has enjoyed positive reviews by critics.  With the release of the third book, the series was awarded a spot on the New York Times top ten best selling children's series list.  With the release of the fifth book, the series reached as high as 4th on the list.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dixler |first=Elsa |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/books/bestseller/bestchildren.html?ref=bestseller |title=Best Sellers - The New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-02}}</ref>\n\n[[Obert Skye]], the author of [[Leven Thumps and the Gateway to Foo]] - \"Imagination runs wild in Fablehaven.

They kept me turning the pages until 4:40 in the morning. Each book was better than the last! Brandon Mull is a talented new fantasy writer, and I can't wait to read more from him. The world he has created is deep, intriguing, magical, and full of surprising discoveries and unexpected dangers. I especially liked his two main characters, Kendra and Seth. They both act like real people, and unlike many fictional siblings, they help and support each other when they're in trouble.

It is followed by the five-part sequel series '''Dragonwatch'''.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nThe series begins as 13-year-old Kendra and 11-year-old Seth Sorenson are traveling to their Grandpa and Grandma Sorenson's house while their parents are away on a 17-day cruise.  When they get there, they also meet Dale, the groundskeeper, and Lena, the housekeeper.  Grandma Sorenson is \"mysteriously\" missing.  Grandpa Sorenson does not tell Kendra and Seth about Fablehaven being a secret preserve for magical creatures at first, but instead sets up a rather complex puzzle involving six keys and a locked journal for Kendra to solve.  Once Kendra unlocks the mostly blank journal, she discovers the words \"Drink the milk.\" She and Seth drink the magical milk opening their eyes to a whole new, mystical world full of the magical beings of Fablehaven. Then Kendra and Seth must face challenges such as defeating an evil witch and a powerful demon, defending the preserve from an evil society, stopping a plague that changes creatures of light into creatures of darkness, and ultimately, protecting the world from a horde of imprisoned demons.\n\n== Motifs ==\n\n;'''[[List of Fablehaven animals|Magical creatures]]''':Fablehaven is home to a wide variety of magical creatures. Both creatures of light, such as fairies, nymphs, satyrs, unicorns, and centaurs, and dark or inherently evil beings, such as trolls, goblins, ogres, imps, and a few demons. A magical treaty protects all creatures, including humans outside creatures' domains, so long as the laws of the treaty are kept, the humans and magical beings are safe. Grandpa Sorensen explains to Kendra and Seth that some creatures are helpful, like Hugo the golem, and some are mischievous, but playful, like the satyrs. But he warns them that none of them are good in the way we think of good, and many of them are dangerous and will kill them if given the chance. \n\n;'''[[List of Magical Items in Fablehaven|Magical items]]''': Many magical items are used in the series. They range from the simple but interesting, such as a silver ball with a distraction spell on it, to the amazingly powerful, such as the five magical artifacts hidden on the five secret preserves, which if used together would unlock the demon prison.\n\n== Books ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! # !!

At first, the siblings entertain themselves with an attic full of interesting books and toys, and a pond-like swimming pool surrounded by hummingbirds, brightly colored-butterflies and exotic dragonflies that seem too beautiful to be real. But soon their attention wander to the forbidden forest that surrounds their grandparent's house. When Kendra discovers a book entitled Journal of Secrets and follows the directions to \"Drink the milk\" that is supposedly very poisonous, a whole new hidden and amazingly mysterious world is revealed to the siblings at Fablehaven. Kendra and Seth find out quickly how dangerous this new magical environment is when rules are broken, thrusting them into the middle of a fight for their lives.\n\n=== ''Fablehaven: Rise of the Evening Star'' ===\nThe second book returns us to the Sorenson siblings the following year, where a strange new student has infiltrated the school in disguise, causing mischief and Kendra is the only one who can see the charade. The Society of the Evening Star, an ancient organization determined to overthrow magical preserves and use them for their own intents and purposes, is on the move and is determined to infiltrate Fablehaven. New characters are introduced who mentor Kendra and Seth with their knowledge of magical potions, animals, and magical items. In addition, these three specialists have a more perilous assignment\u2014find an artifact of great power hidden on the grounds. When the Evening Star pervades the gates of Fablehaven, it is assumed that someone inside the preserve is a traitor. But who? If the artifact falls into the wrong hands, it could mean the downfall of other preserves and possibly the world.\n\n=== ''Fablehaven: Grip of the Shadow Plague'' ===\nThe third book starts where the second book ended, during the same summer of their second year at Fablehaven. Seth discovers that someone, or something, has released a plague that transforms beings of light into creatures of darkness. For the first time, some of the main characters visit another magical preserve, as another hidden artifact must be recovered from Lost Mesa in Arizona. New friends are introduced and new magical creatures of light and darkness are confronted, and hard sacrifices made.\n\n=== ''Fablehaven: Secrets of the Dragon Sanctuary'' ===\nThings are heating up between the Knights of the Dawn and the Society of the Evening Star, who turn to kidnapping Kendra in an attempt to discover secrets. The race to obtain the 5 magical artifacts continues, and leads the Knights, and the Sorensons, to a deadly dragon Sanctuary called Wyrmroost. They face bigger challenges than they've ever faced before, including negotiating with a wizard, an enormous evil dragon, and the biggest giant in the world.\n\n=== ''Fablehaven: Keys to the Demon Prison'' ===\nThe final book in the series has the Sorenson siblings traveling to different preserves around the earth in the attempt to secure the remaining magical artifacts before the Society gets them.  A powerful new ally joins the fight, but deadly new enemies also add to the escalation.  The conflict separates Kendra and Seth who take on different missions, each extremely dangerous and exciting.  They finally reunite just before the confrontation at Zzyzx, and the opening of the demon prison.  An unexpected event orchestrated by the Fairy Queen was their only hope to save the world. She traps the demons in her realm while claiming Zzyzx as her new kingdom which is three times bigger than her old one.\n\n=== ''Dragonwatch'' ===\nIn the new series, it's been four months since the Demon Prison was closed by Kendra and Seth, with help from the Knights of the Dawn, the Fairy Queen and her subjects, and the Dragons of Wyrmroost.  Agad the wizard had to cut a deal with Celebrant the Just, King of Dragons to gain their assistance, and he was made a co-caretaker of the sanctuary.  Now Celebrant is restless to gain more control and to ultimately release the dragons from their confinement.  Draconic unrest is happening at all the dragon sanctuaries, and Agad was called away to assist at Soaring Cliffs, leaving an opening at Wyrmroost.  The caretaker must be a Dragon Tamer, and Kendra and Seth qualify when in contact with each other.  As the new caretakers of Wyrmroost, the siblings struggle not only for acceptance among the current Blackwell Keep inhabitants, but attempt to complete a desperate mission to strengthen the defenses of the castle, securing the safety of the inhabitants within, and the world beyond.\n\n=== ''Dragonwatch: Wrath of the Dragon King'' ===\nCelebrant invites Kendra and Seth to a yearly sanctuary feast. After receiving guidance Kendra and Seth agree to attend. However, it is all part of a trap Celebrant has set up. Celebrant uses the feast to declare that war against the humans and also reveals that the second of seven dragon sanctuaries has fallen. Now Kendra and Seth must figure out a way to deal with a new deadly enemy, the Dark Unicorn Ronodin, while dealing with their first summer solstice at Wyrmroost. Making matters worse is a cursed castle that could hold secrets to help them or ruin them all; making matters even worse, Knox and Tess learn the secrets of Fablehaven and Knox finds a way to take the two of them to Wyrmroost all while the war is occurring. Knox is tricked into leaving the Fablehaven keys behind with a goblin, but it causes a huge entrance weakness to Wyrmroost when the barrel disappears stranding everyone there. Kendra, Seth, and others venture into a cursed castle called Stormguard on the summer solstice, to fight for the legendary Wizenstone in a tournament started by Humbuggle the dwarf.\n\n=== ''Dragonwatch: Master of the Phantom Isle'' ===\nCursed by the Key of Forgetting, Seth has lost all memory of his past\u2014his relationships, his experiences, and who he really is. For now he will align with his new mentor, Ronodin, the dark unicorn, who takes him to the Phantom Isle, the secret gateway to the Under Realm. Though Seth is not formally a prisoner, Ronodin wants to use him and his shadow charmer powers for his own dark ends. Kendra is frantic to find her missing brother, but the quest will take her and her companions, including Warren, Tanu, and Vanessa, far from Wyrmroost to Crescent Lagoon\u2014a recently fallen dragon sanctuary made up of many islands and underwater domains. Its caretaker has regained a foothold on one of the islands. If Kendra and her friends can save that sanctuary, they might uncover the answers they need to rescue Seth. With each sanctuary the dragons overthrow, Celebrant, the Dragon King, comes closer to the dawn of a new Age of Dragons. With the forces of darkness on the march, can Kendra and her allies gather enough power to win the epic dragon war?\n\n== Dragonwatch series ==\nIn 2013, Brandon Mull announced there would be a five book sequel series that would pick up right where ''Keys to the Demon Prison'' left off. It features the same world and characters, but with several new characters, and is titled ''Dragonwatch''. The series is based on the rivalry between Demon and Dragon, with Kendra and Seth caught in the middle.  ''Dragonwatch'' is the anciently established coalition made up of wizards, sorceresses, and dragon slayers, to keep the dragons from taking over the earth.  Book one was released on March 14, 2017, from Shadow Mountain Publishing.\n\n== Reception ==\nThe series has enjoyed positive reviews by critics.  With the release of the third book, the series was awarded a spot on the New York Times top ten best selling children's series list.  With the release of the fifth book, the series reached as high as 4th on the list.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dixler |first=Elsa |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/books/bestseller/bestchildren.html?ref=bestseller |title=Best Sellers - The New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-02}}</ref>\n\n[[Obert Skye]], the author of [[Leven Thumps and the Gateway to Foo]] - \"Imagination runs wild in Fablehaven.
