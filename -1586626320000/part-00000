{"title_page": "The Infinite Way", "text_new": "'''The Infinite Way''' is a spiritual movement and activity created by 20th century [[United States|American]] healer, mystic and lecturer [[Joel S. Goldsmith]] (1892&ndash;1964). According to Goldsmith, the Message of the Infinite Way  is a spiritual teaching consisting of principles which anyone may follow and practice, irrespective of their religious affiliation. The Infinite Way reveals the nature of [[God]] to be one infinite power, intelligence, and love; the nature of the individual being to be one with God's qualities and character, expressed in infinite forms and variety; and the nature of the discords of this world to be a misconception of God's expression of Himself in His universe.\"<ref>Goldsmith, J.S.

There is no organization, no structure, no rules, no church buildings, no congregation, no dues, and no bureaucracy. 'The Infinite Way' is composed solely of the inspired works of Joel Goldsmith based on his revelations and experiences: the more than fifty-one books he authored, and the more than twelve hundred hours of his lectures and classes.\"<ref>Covell, O.D. (2005) ''Taking the Path to Spiritual Awakening.'' AuthorHouse. p IX.</ref>\n\nDuring his life Joel Goldsmith asked for no remuneration for his healing work but he did take it if offered.

Goldsmith]] (1892&ndash;1964). According to Goldsmith, the Message of the Infinite Way  is a spiritual teaching consisting of principles which anyone may follow and practice, irrespective of their religious affiliation. The Infinite Way reveals the nature of [[God]] to be one infinite power, intelligence, and love; the nature of the individual being to be one with God's qualities and character, expressed in infinite forms and variety; and the nature of the discords of this world to be a misconception of God's expression of Himself in His universe.\"<ref>Goldsmith, J.S. (1992) ''The Art of Spiritual Healing.'' HarperCollins. p 40.</ref>\n\n== History ==\nGoldsmith started teaching the lessons of the Infinite Way in 1940 and in 1947 published the book, ''The Infinite Way''.<ref>Beverely, J.A. (2009) ''Nelson's Illustrated Guide to Religions.'' Thomas Nelson Inc. p 108.</ref> He began teaching and lecturing extensively that year, first in [[New England]], then on the [[West Coast of the United States]] and finally in Hawaii. In 1950, Goldsmith began recording his lectures world-wide.<ref>Melton, J.G. (2003) ''Encyclopedia of American Religions.'' Gale. p 743-44.</ref> \n\n== Framework ==\n\"'The Infinite Way' is not a religion... but an experience in spiritual living. There is no organization, no structure, no rules, no church buildings, no congregation, no dues, and no bureaucracy. 'The Infinite Way' is composed solely of the inspired works of Joel based on his revelations and experiences: the more than fifty-one books he authored, and the more than twelve hundred hours of his lectures and classes.\"<ref>Covell, O.D. (2005) ''Taking the Path to Spiritual Awakening.'' AuthorHouse. p IX.</ref>\n\nDuring his life Joel Goldsmith asked for no remuneration for his healing work but he did take it if offered.

The team lost three and drew two of the five matches on the tour.<ref name=\"TL\" />\n\nOriginally the Taliban regime in Afghanistan had banned cricket as they had banned most other sports, but in early 2000 there was a change of heart and the government wrote to the Pakistan Cricket Board asking for the PCB's support for an Afghan application to the ICC{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}. The conflict in Afghanistan shortly afterwards led to a large number of Afghan refugees fleeing to Pakistan, where some learned to play cricket, and the presence of Pakistani peacekeeping troops in Afghanistan later helped this process.\n\nIn 2001, the Afghan side took part in a four-match tour of Pakistan, visiting Peshawar and Rawalpindi, and the team also visited in 2003 and 2004. In 2004 Afghanistan played in the Asian Cricket Council Trophy in Kuala Lumpur - the regional qualifying competition for the ICC Trophy - and performed respectably, with the highlight being a surprise win over hosts Malaysia.\n\nThey played in two Pakistani tournaments in 2003, winning their first match that year. They began playing in Asian regional tournaments in 2004, finishing sixth in their first ACC Trophy. More success began in 2006 when they were runners-up to [[Bahrain national cricket team|Bahrain]] in the Middle East Cup and beat an [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] side featuring former [[England cricket team|England]] [[Captain (cricket)|captain]] [[Mike Gatting]] by 171 runs in [[Mumbai]].

The PCB-regulated [[National Cricket Academy]] (NCA) will help in improving technical, tactical, mental and physical skills, and will host lectures on doping, anti-corruption and various codes of conduct.

The world governing body of cricket approved the grant at its IDI (ICC Development International) board meeting, which concluded in Dubai.\n\nACB chief executive officer, Noor Mohammad Murad, said the board had requested a total of $1 million in assistance. \"The ICC approved $422,000 for now. They will send a delegation to visit the ACB in two or three weeks, and will decide [from there] whether or not to approve the rest of the money,\" Murad told AFP.\n\nThe money, to be given over three years, is aimed at developing more competitive teams among ICC Full, Associate and Affiliate members. Previously, countries such as the Netherlands, Scotland, West Indies, Zimbabwe and Ireland have received assistance through a similar programme. According to an ICC statement, the funding for the ACB is for the development of the National Cricket Academy in Kabul.\n\nAfghanistan became an Affiliate member of the ICC in 2001. In 2009 it attained one-day status till 2015. Over the last two years, the ACB has undergone organisational restructuring in a bid to provide better leadership and find qualified staff to run cricket administration in the war-torn country. They are currently developing their domestic cricket infrastructure, and have signed a two-year deal with the Pakistan board for the development of Afghanistan cricket ahead of the 2015 World Cup.\n\nLast year, the Asian Cricket Council decided to nominate Afghanistan for Associate membership with the ICC, with the request being looked into at the ICC's annual conference in June.

The world governing body of cricket approved the grant at its IDI (ICC Development International) board meeting, which concluded in Dubai.\n\nACB chief executive officer, Noor Mohammad Murad, said the board had requested a total of $1 million in assistance. \"The ICC approved $422,000 for now. They will send a delegation to visit the ACB in two or three weeks, and will decide [from there] whether or not to approve the rest of the money,\" Murad told AFP.\n\nThe money, to be given over three years, is aimed at developing more competitive teams among ICC Full, Associate and Affiliate members. Previously, countries such as the Netherlands, Scotland, West Indies, Zimbabwe and Ireland have received assistance through a similar programme. According to an ICC statement, the funding for the ACB is for the development of the National Cricket Academy in Kabul.\n\nAfghanistan became an Affiliate member of the ICC in 2001. In 2009 it attained one-day status till 2015. Over the last two years, the ACB has undergone organisational restructuring in a bid to provide better leadership and find qualified staff to run cricket administration in the war-torn country. They are currently developing their domestic cricket infrastructure, and have signed a two-year deal with the Pakistan board for the development of Afghanistan cricket ahead of the 2015 World Cup.\n\nLast year, the Asian Cricket Council decided to nominate Afghanistan for Associate membership with the ICC, with the request being looked into at the ICC's annual conference in June. At present the ICC provides about $700,000 a year in funding. Based on current distributions, that will rise to $850,000 once Associate status is assured.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/afghanistan/content/story/630786.html |title=Afghanistan allocated $422,000 by ICC for assistance |first=Umar |last=Farooq |date=18 April 2013 |website=ESPN Cricinfo |accessdate=13 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119230531/http://www.espncricinfo.com/afghanistan/content/story/630786.html |archive-date=19 January 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\n===2015 Cricket World Cup===\n{{main|Afghanistan at the Cricket World Cup}}\n\nAfghanistan made their World Cup debut in the 50 over format of the game against [[Bangladesh national cricket team|Bangladesh]] at the [[Manuka Oval]] in Canberra, Australia.

The changes can be summarized as follows:<ref name=\"Murray\"/><ref name=\"Fromkin\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Great Vowel Shift\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Front vowels\n| {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Close-mid front unrounded vowel.ogg|e\u02d0}} \u2192 {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Close front unrounded vowel.ogg|i:}} \u2192 {{Audio-IPA|help=no|En-us-I.ogg|a\u026a}}\n|-\n| {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Open-mid front unrounded vowel.ogg|\u025b:}} \u2192 {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Close front unrounded vowel.ogg|i:}} ''or'' {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Close-mid front unrounded vowel.ogg|e\u02d0}}\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Back vowels\n| {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Open-mid back rounded vowel.ogg|\u0254\u02d0}} \u2192 {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Close-mid back rounded vowel.ogg|o\u02d0}} \u2192 {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Close back rounded vowel.ogg|u\u02d0}} \u2192 {{Audio-IPA|help=no|En-us-ow.ogg|a\u028a}}\n|-\n| {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Open front unrounded vowel.ogg|a}} \u2192 {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Close-mid front unrounded vowel.ogg|e\u02d0}}\n|}\n\nMost vowels shifted to a higher [[place of articulation]], so that the pronunciation of ''geese'' changed from {{IPA|/ge:s/}} to {{IPA|/gi\u02d0s/}} and ''broken'' from {{IPA|/br\u0254\u02d0ken/}} to {{IPA|/bro\u02d0k\u0259n/}}. The high vowels {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} became [[diphthongs]] (for example, ''mice'' changed from {{Audio-IPA|help=no|ME-mice.ogg|/mi\u02d0s/}} to {{Audio-IPA|help=no|ModE-mice01.ogg|/ma\u026as/}}), and the low back vowel {{IPA|/a/}} was [[Fronted (phonetics)|fronted]], causing ''name'' to change from {{Audio-IPA|help=no|ME-name.ogg|/na:m\u0259/}} to {{Audio-IPA|help=no|ModE-name.ogg|/ne\u026am/}}.<ref name=\"Fromkin\"/>\n\nThe Great Vowel Shift occurred over centuries, and not all [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of English  were affected in the same ways. For example, some speakers in [[Scotland]] still pronounce ''house'' similarly to its sound in Middle English before the shift, as {{IPA|[hus]}}.<ref name=\"Winkler\"/>\n\nA chain shift may affect only one [[regional dialect]] of a language, or it may begin in a particular regional dialect and then expand beyond the region in which it originated. A number of recent regional chain shifts have occurred in English.  Perhaps the most well-known is the [[Northern Cities Vowel Shift]], which is largely confined to the \"[[Inland Northern American English|Inland North]]\" region of the United States.  Other examples in North America are the [[California vowel shift]], [[Southern American English|Southern vowel shift]] (in the [[Southern United States]]) and the [[Canadian Shift]].

The changes can be summarized as follows:<ref name=\"Murray\"/><ref name=\"Fromkin\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Great Vowel Shift\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Front vowels\n| {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Close-mid front unrounded vowel.ogg|e\u02d0}} \u2192 {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Close front unrounded vowel.ogg|i:}} \u2192 {{Audio-IPA|help=no|En-us-I.ogg|a\u026a}}\n|-\n| {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Open-mid front unrounded vowel.ogg|\u025b:}} \u2192 {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Close front unrounded vowel.ogg|i:}} ''or'' {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Close-mid front unrounded vowel.ogg|e\u02d0}}\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Back vowels\n| {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Open-mid back rounded vowel.ogg|\u0254\u02d0}} \u2192 {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Close-mid back rounded vowel.ogg|o\u02d0}} \u2192 {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Close back rounded vowel.ogg|u\u02d0}} \u2192 {{Audio-IPA|help=no|En-us-ow.ogg|a\u028a}}\n|-\n| {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Open front unrounded vowel.ogg|a}} \u2192 {{Audio-IPA|help=no|Close-mid front unrounded vowel.ogg|e\u02d0}}\n|}\n\nMost vowels shifted to a higher [[place of articulation]], so that the pronunciation of ''geese'' changed from {{IPA|/ge:s/}} to {{IPA|/gi\u02d0s/}} and ''broken'' from {{IPA|/br\u0254\u02d0ken/}} to {{IPA|/bro\u02d0k\u0259n/}}. The high vowels {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} became [[diphthongs]] (for example, ''mice'' changed from {{Audio-IPA|help=no|ME-mice.ogg|/mi\u02d0s/}} to {{Audio-IPA|help=no|ModE-mice01.ogg|/ma\u026as/}}), and the low back vowel {{IPA|/a/}} was [[Fronted (phonetics)|fronted]], causing ''name'' to change from {{Audio-IPA|help=no|ME-name.ogg|/na:m\u0259/}} to {{Audio-IPA|help=no|ModE-name.ogg|/ne\u026am/}}.<ref name=\"Fromkin\"/>\n\nThe Great Vowel Shift occurred over centuries, and not all [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of English  were affected in the same ways. For example, some speakers in [[Scotland]] still pronounce ''house'' similarly to its sound in Middle English before the shift, as {{IPA|[hus]}}.<ref name=\"Winkler\"/>\n\nA chain shift may affect only one [[regional dialect]] of a language, or it may begin in a particular regional dialect and then expand beyond the region in which it originated. A number of recent regional chain shifts have occurred in English.  Perhaps the most well-known is the [[Northern Cities Vowel Shift]], which is largely confined to the \"[[Inland Northern American English|Inland North]]\" region of the United States.  Other examples in North America are the [[California vowel shift]], [[Southern American English|Southern vowel shift]] (in the [[Southern United States]]) and the [[Canadian Shift]].  In England, the [[Cockney]] vowel shift among working-class Londoners is familiar from its prominence in plays such as [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s [[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]] (and the related musical [[My Fair Lady]]):{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n: {{IPA|i\u02d0}} \u2192 {{IPA|ei}} \u2192 {{IPA|ai}} \u2192 {{IPA|\u0254i}} \u2192 {{IPA|oi}}\n\nMany chain shifts are [[vowel shift]]s, because many sets of vowels are naturally arranged on a multi-value scale (e.g. [[vowel height]] or frontness).
