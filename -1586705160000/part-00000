The war was fought mainly in Silesia, [[Bohemia]] and [[Upper Saxony]] and formed one [[theatre (warfare)|theatre]] of the [[Seven Years' War]]. It was the last of three [[Silesian Wars]] fought between [[Frederick the Great]]'s Prussia and [[Maria Theresa]]'s Austria in the mid-1700s, all three of which ended in Prussian control of Silesia.\n\nThis conflict can be viewed as a continuation of the [[First Silesian War|First]] and [[Second Silesian War]]s of the previous decade. After the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] ended the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], Austria enacted broad reforms and [[Diplomatic Revolution|upended its traditional diplomatic policy]] in order to prepare for renewed war with Prussia. As with the previous Silesian Wars, no particular triggering event initiated the conflict; rather, Prussia struck opportunistically to disrupt its enemies' plans. The war's cost in blood and treasure was high on both sides, and it ended inconclusively when neither of the main belligerents could sustain the conflict any longer.\n\nThe war began with a Prussian invasion of [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]] in mid-1756, and it ended in a Prussian victory with the 1763 [[Treaty of Hubertusburg]], which confirmed Prussian control of Silesia. The treaty resulted in no territorial changes, but Austria agreed to recognise Prussia's sovereignty in Silesia in return for Prussia's support for the election of Maria Theresa's son, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Joseph]], as [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. The conflict formed part of the ongoing [[Austria\u2013Prussia rivalry]] that would shape German politics for more than a century. The war greatly enhanced the prestige of Prussia, which won general recognition as a major European power, and of Frederick, who cemented his reputation as a military genius.\n\n== Context and causes ==\n{{Further|First Silesian War|Second Silesian War}}\n[[File:Europe 1748-1766 en.png|thumb|alt=Map of European political borders in 1756|Europe in the years after the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)]], with Brandenburg\u2013Prussia in violet and the Habsburg Monarchy in gold|upright=1.2]]\nWhile the [[Seven Years' War]] was a global conflict among many belligerents, its [[Central Europe]]an theatre turned on lingering grudges from the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1741\u20131748). The [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], which had concluded the earlier war, confirmed Prussian King [[Frederick the Great|Frederick II]]'s seizure of the region of [[Silesia]] from the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] through two [[Silesian Wars]].<ref name=\"Fraser 202\">{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=202}}</ref> The defeated Archduchess [[Maria Theresa]] of Austria nevertheless fully intended to retake the lost province and reassert Austria's hegemony in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]; after peace was restored, she set about rebuilding her armed forces and seeking out new alliances.<ref>{{Harvp|Wilson|2016|pp=478\u2013479}}</ref>\n\n===Unresolved conflicts===\nThough [[Early modern France|France]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] recognised Prussia's sovereignty in Silesia under the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, Austria ultimately refused to ratify the agreement, and Maria Theresa's husband, [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]], withheld the Holy Roman Empire's guarantee for Prussian control of the contested province. Prussia, in turn, still withheld its assent to the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|Pragmatic Sanction]], thus challenging Maria Theresa's legitimacy as head of the Habsburg Monarchy.<ref name=\"Fraser 202\"/> Despite dynastic links, British King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] viewed Prussia as an ally and proxy of the French, while Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia]] saw Frederick's kingdom as a rival for influence in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and feared that Prussia's growing power would obstruct the path of Russia's westward expansion.<ref name=\"Shennan 49\">{{Harvp|Shennan|2005|p=49}}</ref> The political and diplomatic conditions that had led to the previous Silesian Wars still held, and further conflict seemed likely.<ref name=\"Fraser 202\"/>\n\nIn 1746 Maria Theresa formed a defensive agreement with Elizabeth known as the [[Treaty of Two Empresses]], which aligned [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] against Prussia; a secret clause guaranteed Russia's support for Austria's claims in Silesia. In 1750 Britain joined the anti-Prussian compact in return for guarantees of Austrian and Russian defence in the case of a Prussian attack on the [[Electorate of Hanover]], which George also ruled in [[personal union]].<ref name=\"Shennan 49\"/> At the same time, Maria Theresa, who had been disappointed with Britain's performance as [[Anglo-Austrian Alliance|her ally]] in the War of the Austrian Succession, followed the controversial advice of her Chancellor [[Wenzel Anton von Kaunitz]] by pursuing warmer relations with Austria's [[French\u2013Habsburg relations|longstanding rival]], the Kingdom of France.<ref>{{Harvp|Clark|2006|pp=197\u2013198}}</ref>\n\n===Diplomatic Revolution===\nBritain elevated tensions in 1755 by offering to finance the deployment of a Russian army that would stand ready to attack Prussia's eastern frontier. Alarmed by this encirclement, Frederick began working to separate Britain from the Austrian coalition by allaying King George's concern for Hanover. On 16 January 1756 Prussia and Britain agreed to the [[Convention of Westminster]], under which Prussia now undertook to guarantee Hanover against French attack, in return for Britain's withdrawal of its offer of military subsidies to Russia. This move created a new [[Anglo-Prussian alliance (1756)|Anglo-Prussian alliance]] and incensed the French court.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=297\u2013301}}</ref>\n\nAustria was now seeking warmer relations with France to ensure that the French would not take Prussia's side in a future conflict over Silesia. King [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] responded to Prussia's realignment with Britain by accepting Maria Theresa's invitation to a new [[Franco-Austrian alliance]], formalised with the [[First Treaty of Versailles]] in May 1756. This series of political manoeuvres came to be known as the [[Diplomatic Revolution]].<ref>{{Harvp|Horn|1957|pp=449\u2013464}}</ref><ref>{{Harvp|Black|1990|pp=301\u2013323}}</ref> Russia, likewise upset by the withdrawal of Britain's promised subsidies, drew closer to Austria and France, agreeing to a more openly offensive anti-Prussian coalition in April 1756. As France turned against Prussia and Russia separated from Britain, Kaunitz's plan thus matured into a grand anti-Prussian alliance between Austria, Russia, various lesser German powers, and France.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=293\u2013294}}</ref>\n\n===Preparations for war===\n[[File:Crown of Bohemia 1648.png|thumb|alt=Map of political borders in Central Europe in the early 1700s|Map of the [[Central Europe]]an region where the bulk of the war was fought, prior to Prussia's seizure of Silesia]]\nAs Austria and Russia made open preparations for renewed war, Frederick became convinced that Prussia would be attacked in early 1757. Rather than wait for his enemies to move at a time of their choosing, he resolved instead to act preemptively, beginning with an attack against the neighbouring [[Electorate of Saxony]], which he correctly believed was a secret party to the coalition against him.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=310}}</ref> Frederick's broad strategy had three parts. First, he meant to occupy Saxony, gaining [[strategic depth]] and using the Saxon army and treasury to bolster the Prussian war effort. Second, he would advance from Saxony into [[Bohemia]], where he might set up winter quarters at Austria's expense. Third, he would invade [[Moravia]] from Silesia, seize the fortress at [[Olm\u00fctz]], and advance on [[Vienna]] to force an end to the war.<ref name=\"Asprey 427\">{{Harvp|Asprey|1986|p=427}}</ref> He hoped to receive financial support from the British, who had also promised to send a naval squadron into the [[Baltic Sea]] to deter invasion of Prussia's coast, if necessary.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=308}}</ref>\n\nTo begin, Frederick divided Prussia's armies in three. He placed a force of 20,000 under [[Field Marshal]] [[Hans von Lehwaldt]] in [[East Prussia]] to guard against any Russian invasion from the east, with a reserve of 8,000 standing in [[Farther Pomerania]]; Russia should have been able to bring irresistible force to bear against East Prussia, but the King trusted to the slowness and disorganisation of the Russian army to defend his north-eastern flank. He also stationed Field Marshal Count [[Kurt Christoph Graf von Schwerin|Kurt von Schwerin]] in Silesia with 25,000 men to deter incursions from Moravia and Hungary. Finally, he personally led the main Prussian army of 58,000 into Saxony;<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=317\u2013318}}</ref> Prussian troops crossed the Saxon frontier on 29 August 1756, beginning the Third Silesian War.<ref>{{Harvp|Clark|2006|pp=198\u2013199}}</ref>\n\n== Course ==\n=== 1756 ===\n==== Invasion of Saxony ====\n[[File:Map for the Silesian and Seven Years Wars.jpg|thumb|alt=Map of Central Europe with coloured territories|The Central European borders of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Brandenburg\u2013Prussia]] (blue-green) and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] (red) in 1756, at the outbreak of the Third Silesian War|upright=1.2]]\nThe Prussian army marched in three columns: on the right were about 15,000 men under the command of [[Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel|Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick]]; on the left were 18,000 men under the command of the [[Augustus William, Duke of Brunswick-Bevern|Duke of Brunswick-Bevern]]; in the centre was Frederick himself, with Field Marshal [[James Francis Edward Keith|James Keith]] commanding a corps of 30,000 troops. Prince Ferdinand was to advance on the town of [[Chemnitz]] and proceed to [[Leipzig]], while Bevern was to traverse [[Lusatia]] to seize [[Bautzen]]. Meanwhile, Frederick and Keith would advance through [[Torgau]] to attack the Saxon capital at [[Dresden]].<ref name=\"Asprey 427\"/><ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=317}}</ref> Saxony and Austria were unprepared for Frederick's preemptive strike, and their forces were scattered; as Prussians streamed into the Electorate, the main Saxon army fortified itself at [[Pirna]], and the Prussians occupied Dresden on 9 September against little resistance.<ref>{{Harvp|Asprey|1986|p=428}}</ref><ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=318\u2013319}}</ref>\n\nFrederick and the main Prussian army pressed on into northern Bohemia, looking to engage the Austrians under General [[Maximilian Ulysses Browne]] before they could join forces with the Saxons. Browne took up a defensible position by the village of [[Lobositz]], where the two forces fought the [[Battle of Lobositz]] on 1 October.<ref>{{Harvp|Asprey|1986|pp=430\u2013438}}</ref> The engagement ended inconclusively, with the Austrians inflicting significant losses on the Prussians and then retreating in good order; Frederick thus prevented Browne from reinforcing the isolated Saxons, but Browne stopped Frederick's advance into Bohemia.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=324}}</ref> Turning back to the north, the Prussians fully occupied Saxony, even taking [[Augustus III of Poland|Prince-Elector Frederick Augustus II]] of Saxony prisoner, although he was allowed to withdraw to his other realms on 18 October. The Saxon army was briefly [[Siege of Pirna|besieged at Pirna]] and surrendered on 14 October, after which its men were forcibly incorporated into the Prussian army under Prussian officers.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=324\u2013326}}</ref> Saxony's treasury was emptied and its [[Ephraimiten|currency debased]] to help fund the Prussian war effort.<ref>{{Harvp|Asprey|1986|p=465}}</ref>\n\n=== 1757 ===\n====Winter diplomacy====\nOver the winter of 1756\u20131757 the belligerents worked to secure their respective alliances and co-ordinate strategy with their allies. In February [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]], the new [[Leader of the House of Commons]] and a determined foe of France, persuaded the British Parliament to firmly and finally commit to the Prussian cause against Austria and France, after which Britain began delivering supplies and badly needed subsidies to Berlin. Parliament also approved the deployment of an Army of Observation to defend Hanover (and Brandenburg) against the coming [[Invasion of Hanover (1757)|French invasion]] from the west.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=334\u2013336}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Prussia's aggressive attack on Saxony galvanised the Austrian coalition, and in particular increased France's commitment to offensive war against Prussia. The [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] met in January in [[Regensburg]], where Maria Theresa won enough German princes to her cause that the Holy Roman Empire [[Reichskrieg|declared war on Prussia]] on 17 January; the Diet called for a 40,000-man ''[[Reichsarmee]]'' to be assembled and put at Austria's disposal for the liberation of Saxony.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=331\u2013332}}</ref> In May 1757 the [[Second Treaty of Versailles]] strengthened the Franco-Austrian Alliance, with the French agreeing to contribute 129,000 soldiers to the fighting in Germany, along with subsidies of 12 million [[French livre|livres]] per year until Austria had recovered Silesia.<ref name=\"Clark 199-200\">{{Harvp|Clark|2006|pp=199\u2013200}}</ref>\n\nIn return, Austria promised that after the victory was won it would grant France control of the [[Austrian Netherlands]], a long-coveted prize for the French. Russia also committed 80,000 men to the conflict, hoping to seize East Prussia and then exchange that territory with [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]] for control of [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia|Courland]]. Sweden also agreed to invade [[Province of Pomerania (1653\u20131815)|Prussian Pomerania]], looking to recovering the territories [[Treaties of Stockholm (Great Northern War)|lost to Prussia]] after the [[Great Northern War]]. In all, then, the Austrian coalition sought a total [[Partition (politics)|partition]] of the Kingdom of Prussia,<ref name=\"Clark 199-200\"/> all while portraying Frederick as the aggressor for making the first move to open war.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=311\u2013312}}</ref>\n\n==== Bohemian campaign and Battle of Kol\u00edn ====\n[[File:Johann Christoph Frisch - Death of Field Marshal Schwerin.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of Prussian Field Marshal Schwerin dying at the Battle of Prague|Prussian Field Marshal [[Kurt Christoph Graf von Schwerin|Kurt von Schwerin]] dying of wounds at the [[Battle of Prague (1757)|Battle of Prague]], as depicted by [[Johann Christoph Frisch]]|upright=1.2]]\nAfter wintering in Saxony, Frederick decided to immediately invade Bohemia again, before French or Russian forces could reach the area and support the Austrians.<ref name=\"Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=337\">{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=337}}</ref> On 18 April 1757 the main Prussian army advanced in multiple columns through the [[Ore Mountains]], seeking a decisive engagement with Browne's forces,<ref>{{Harvp|Marston|2001|p=37}}</ref> while the Silesian garrison under Schwerin advanced from [[K\u0142odzko|Glatz]] to join them.<ref name=\"Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=337\"/> On 21 April Bevern's column encountered an Austrian corps led by [[Christian Moritz Graf K\u00f6nigsegg und Rothenfels|Count K\u00f6nigsegg]] near [[Liberec|Reichenberg]]; the ensuing [[Battle of Reichenberg]] ended in a Prussian victory, and the Prussian forces continued to advance on [[Prague]].<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=340}}</ref>\n\nThe invading columns reunited north of Prague, while the retreating Austrians reformed under the command of [[Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine|Prince Charles of Lorraine]] to the city's east, and on 6 May the two armies fought the [[Battle of Prague (1757)|Battle of Prague]]. Both sides suffered heavy casualties, and both Browne and Schwerin were killed, but the Prussians forced the Austrians back into the fortified city, which the invaders then [[Siege of Prague (1757)|besieged]].<ref name=\"Luvaas 6\">Luvaas, from {{Harvp|Friedrich II, King of Prussia|2009|p=6}}</ref> Learning of the attack on Prague, Austrian commander [[Count Leopold Joseph von Daun|Count Leopold von Daun]] advanced from the east with a force of 30,000 men.<ref>{{Harvp|Marston|2001|p=39}}</ref> Daun arrived too late to join the Battle of Prague, but he collected thousands of scattered Austrians who had escaped from the battle; with these reinforcements he slowly moved to relieve the city.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=348\u2013349}}</ref>\n\nTrying to simultaneously besiege Prague and face Daun, the Prussians were compelled to divide their forces.

The resulting [[Battle of Kol\u00edn]] on 18 June ended in a decisive Austrian victory; the Prussian position was ruined, and the invaders were forced to lift the siege and withdraw from Bohemia altogether, pursued by Daun's army, which was enlarged by the Prague garrison. The failure to take Bohemia meant the ruin of Frederick's strategy, leaving no realistic prospect of a march on Vienna.<ref name=\"Luvaas 6\" />\n\n==== East Prussia and Pomerania ====\nPrussia's reversal in Bohemia paralleled the entry of new belligerents on the Austrian side. In mid-1757 a Russian force of 75,000 troops under Field Marshal [[Stepan Fyodorovich Apraksin]] invaded East Prussia and took the fortress at [[Klaip\u0117da|Memel]].<ref name=\"Asprey 460\">{{Harvp|Asprey|1986|p=460}}</ref> Advancing further, the Russians engaged and defeated a smaller Prussian force led by Marshal Lehwaldt in the [[Battle of Gross-J\u00e4gersdorf]] on 30 August. However, the victorious Russians were unable to take [[K\u00f6nigsberg]], having expended their supplies at Memel and Gross-J\u00e4gersdorf, and retreated soon afterwards; recurring difficulties with [[logistics]] limited the offensive capabilities of the large Russian army and allowed East Prussia to hold out longer than might have been expected.<ref name=\"Marston 22\">{{Harvp|Marston|2001|p=22}}</ref> Sweden, too, declared war on Prussia in September, invading Prussian Pomerania on 13 September with 17,000 men and beginning the [[Pomeranian War]].<ref name=\"Asprey 460\"/> The need to defend core territories on other fronts reduced Prussia's offensive capacity in Bohemia and Silesia.<ref>{{Harvp|Anderson|2000|p=176}}</ref>\n\n==== Battle of Rossbach ====\n[[File:Schlacht bei Ro\u00dfbach.jpg|thumb|alt=Paitning of armies in formation exchanging musket fire across a hilly landscape.|The [[Battle of Rossbach]], where a portion of Prussia's army destroyed the united French and Imperial armies in a 90-minute battle|upright=1.2]]\nIn mid-1757 Austrian forces gradually pushed into Prussian-controlled Lusatia, while a combined French and ''Reichsarmee'' force under the [[Charles de Rohan, prince de Soubise|Prince of Soubise]] approached the theatre from the west.<ref name=\"Marston 41\">{{Harvp|Marston|2001|p=41}}</ref> On 7 September the Austrians under Daun and Prince Charles, advancing into [[Upper Lusatia]], defeated a Prussian force under Bevern and [[Hans Karl von Winterfeldt]] at the [[Battle of Moys]], during which Winterfeldt was killed.<ref>{{Harvp|Anderson|2000|p=302}}</ref> Prince Charles's army then proceeded westward, hoping to link up with Soubise's force after the latter had traversed Saxony,<ref name=\"Marston 41\"/> while Bevern and his army retreated eastward to defend Lower Silesia.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=359}}</ref>\n\nDeterred by the overwhelming Austrian force in Lusatia, Frederick instead led a Prussian army westward into [[Thuringia]] to seek a decisive engagement with the approaching Franco-Imperial army before it could unite with Charles and Daun.

With that, the belligerents agreed to end the Third Silesian War with the [[Treaty of Hubertusburg]], signed 15 February 1763.<ref name=\"Carlyle XX-XIII\"/>\n\n== Outcomes ==\n[[File:Johann Esaias Nilson Hubertusburger Frieden ubs G 0335 II.jpg|thumb|alt=Engraving of the faces of the monarchs who participated in the Third Silesian War set against an allegorical scene representing the return of peace|Contemporary engraving celebrating the restoration of peace in Germany, by [[Johannes Esaias Nilson]]|upright=1.2]]\nThe return to territorial ''status quo ante'' meant that none of the belligerents in the Silesian War gained the prizes they had aimed at: Prussia was unable to keep any part of Saxony, while Austria failed to recover its lost province of Silesia. Nonetheless, the outcome of the war has generally been considered a diplomatic victory for Prussia,<ref>{{Harvp|Browning|2005|p=530}}</ref> which not only retained Silesia, but also compelled Austria to acknowledge its sovereignty in the province, forestalling any further Silesian Wars. More fundamentally, Prussia showed itself to be a credible [[Austria\u2013Prussia rivalry|rival to Austria]] by successfully surviving intact what could have become a war of partition.<ref name=\"Clark 199-200\"/><ref name=\"Fraser 469\"/><ref name=\"Schweizer 250\"/>\n\n=== Prussia ===\nPrussia emerged from the war as a [[great power]] whose importance in Europe could no longer be disputed,<ref name=\"Schweizer 250\"/> establishing itself as the leading power of Protestant Germany.<ref>{{Harvp|Clark|2006|pp=215\u2013219}}</ref> The kingdom won general recognition of its sovereignty in Silesia, putting a stop to Austria's attempts to recover the province. Frederick the Great's personal reputation was enormously enhanced, as his debts to fortune (Russia's about-face after Elizabeth's death) and to British financial support were soon forgotten, while the memories of his energetic leadership and tactical successes were strenuously kept alive.<ref name=\"Marston 90\">{{Harvp|Marston|2001|p=90}}</ref>\n\nPrussia had held its own while being simultaneously invaded by Austria, Russia, Sweden, and France, an accomplishment that appeared miraculous to contemporary observers.<ref>{{Harvp|Clark|2006|p=200}}</ref> After 1763, armies around the world sent their officers to Prussia to learn the secrets of the state's outsize military power, making Prussia one of the most imitated states in Europe.<ref name=\"Marston 90\"/> Though sometimes depicted as a key moment in Prussia's rise to greatness, the war nonetheless left the kingdom's economy and population devastated (though Frederick's agrarian reforms and encouragement of immigration eventually eased both problems). Its armed forces had experienced heavy casualties, with around 180,000 men killed,<ref name=\"Clodfelter\"/> and the officer corps was severely depleted.

In 1806 the Prussians were shattered by [[Napoleon]]'s French at the [[Battle of Jena]]; only after a series of reforms motivated by the disasters of 1806\u20131807 did Prussian military power again begin to grow.<ref>{{Harvp|Clark|2006|p=313}}</ref>\n\n=== Austria ===\nThe war exhausted Austria's finances, and its armed forces were greatly weakened, with more than 145,000 men dead or missing in the conflict.<ref name=\"Clodfelter\"/> Austria was not able to retake Silesia or realise any other territorial gains, but it did preserve Saxony from Prussian control, slowing the growth of its new northern rival. Its military performed far more respectably than during the War of the Austrian Succession, which seemed to vindicate Maria Theresa's administrative and military reforms since that war. Thus, the war in great part restored Austria's prestige and preserved its position as a major player in the European system.<ref name=\"Clark 216\">{{Harvp|Clark|2006|p=216}}</ref> By agreeing to vote for Archduke Joseph in the Imperial election, Frederick accepted the continuation of Habsburg preeminence in the Holy Roman Empire, though this was far less than Austria had hoped to win in the war.<ref name=\"Hochedlinger 346\">{{Harvp|Hochedlinger|2003|p=346}}</ref>\n\nPrussia's confirmation as a first-rate power and the enhanced prestige of its king and army were long-term threats to Austria's hegemony in Germany.<ref name=\"Clark 216\"/> Indeed, the Empire now held several ambitious middle powers eager to gain at Austria's expense. Frederick Augustus of Saxony was also King of Poland and could call on the resources of that realm to advance his interests in Germany. The Electorate of Hanover had gained tremendously through its personal union with Great Britain and could now bring British power to bear in German conflicts. [[Bavaria]]'s strength was also waxing, as it asserted military and foreign policies ever more independent from those of the Empire. The Silesian Wars made clear that the Habsburg Monarchy would need continued reform if it was to retain its dominant position in European power politics.<ref>{{Harvp|Clark|2006|p=212}}</ref> Austria's defeat by Prussia would become the driving factor behind wide-ranging efforts to modernize the Habsburg Monarchy over the next half century.<ref>{{Harvp|Hochedlinger|2003|p=267}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{Cite book|last=Anderson|first=Fred|author-link=Fred Anderson (historian)|title=Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754\u20131766|publisher=[[Vintage Books]]|location=New York|year=2000|isbn=978-0-375-70636-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jyuMqKzZJnUC|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Asprey|first=Robert B.|author-link=Robert B.

The war was fought mainly in Silesia, [[Bohemia]] and [[Upper Saxony]] and formed one [[theatre (warfare)|theatre]] of the [[Seven Years' War]]. It was the last of three [[Silesian Wars]] fought between [[Frederick the Great]]'s Prussia and [[Maria Theresa]]'s Austria in the mid-1700s, all three of which ended in Prussian control of Silesia.\n\nThis conflict can be viewed as a continuation of the [[First Silesian War|First]] and [[Second Silesian War]]s of the previous decade. After the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] ended the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], Austria enacted broad reforms and [[Diplomatic Revolution|upended its traditional diplomatic policy]] in order to prepare for renewed war with Prussia. As with the previous Silesian Wars, no particular triggering event initiated the conflict; rather, Prussia struck opportunistically to disrupt its enemies' plans. The war's cost in blood and treasure was high on both sides, and it ended inconclusively when neither of the main belligerents could sustain the conflict any longer.\n\nThe war began with a Prussian invasion of [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]] in mid-1756, and it ended in a Prussian victory with the 1763 [[Treaty of Hubertusburg]], which confirmed Prussian control of Silesia. The treaty resulted in no territorial changes, but Austria agreed to recognise Prussia's sovereignty in Silesia in return for Prussia's support for the election of Maria Theresa's son, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Joseph]], as [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. The conflict formed part of the ongoing [[Austria\u2013Prussia rivalry]] that would shape German politics for more than a century. The war greatly enhanced the prestige of Prussia, which won general recognition as a major European power, and of Frederick, who cemented his reputation as a military genius.\n\n== Context and causes ==\n{{Further|First Silesian War|Second Silesian War}}\n[[File:Europe 1748-1766 en.png|thumb|alt=Map of European political borders in 1756|Europe in the years after the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)]], with Brandenburg\u2013Prussia in violet and the Habsburg Monarchy in gold|upright=1.2]]\nWhile the [[Seven Years' War]] was a global conflict among many belligerents, its [[Central Europe]]an theatre turned on lingering grudges from the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1741\u20131748). The [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], which had concluded the earlier war, confirmed Prussian King [[Frederick the Great|Frederick II]]'s seizure of the region of [[Silesia]] from the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] through two [[Silesian Wars]].<ref name=\"Fraser 202\">{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=202}}</ref> The defeated Archduchess [[Maria Theresa]] of Austria nevertheless fully intended to retake the lost province and reassert Austria's hegemony in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]; after peace was restored, she set about rebuilding her armed forces and seeking out new alliances.<ref>{{Harvp|Wilson|2016|pp=478\u2013479}}</ref>\n\n===Unresolved conflicts===\nThough [[Early modern France|France]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] recognised Prussia's sovereignty in Silesia under the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, Austria ultimately refused to ratify the agreement, and Maria Theresa's husband, [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]], withheld the Holy Roman Empire's guarantee for Prussian control of the contested province. Prussia, in turn, still withheld its assent to the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|Pragmatic Sanction]], thus challenging Maria Theresa's legitimacy as head of the Habsburg Monarchy.<ref name=\"Fraser 202\"/> Despite dynastic links, British King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] viewed Prussia as an ally and proxy of the French, while Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia]] saw Frederick's kingdom as a rival for influence in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and feared that Prussia's growing power would obstruct the path of Russia's westward expansion.<ref name=\"Shennan 49\">{{Harvp|Shennan|2005|p=49}}</ref> The political and diplomatic conditions that had led to the previous Silesian Wars still held, and further conflict seemed likely.<ref name=\"Fraser 202\"/>\n\nIn 1746 Maria Theresa formed a defensive agreement with Elizabeth known as the [[Treaty of Two Empresses]], which aligned [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] against Prussia; a secret clause guaranteed Russia's support for Austria's claims in Silesia. In 1750 Britain joined the anti-Prussian compact in return for guarantees of Austrian and Russian defence in the case of a Prussian attack on the [[Electorate of Hanover]], which George also ruled in [[personal union]].<ref name=\"Shennan 49\"/> At the same time, Maria Theresa, who had been disappointed with Britain's performance as [[Anglo-Austrian Alliance|her ally]] in the War of the Austrian Succession, followed the controversial advice of her Chancellor [[Wenzel Anton von Kaunitz]] by pursuing warmer relations with Austria's [[French\u2013Habsburg relations|longstanding rival]], the Kingdom of France.<ref>{{Harvp|Clark|2006|pp=197\u2013198}}</ref>\n\n===Diplomatic Revolution===\nBritain elevated tensions in 1755 by offering to finance the deployment of a Russian army that would stand ready to attack Prussia's eastern frontier. Alarmed by this encirclement, Frederick began working to separate Britain from the Austrian coalition by allaying King George's concern for Hanover. On 16 January 1756 Prussia and Britain agreed to the [[Convention of Westminster]], under which Prussia now undertook to guarantee Hanover against French attack, in return for Britain's withdrawal of its offer of military subsidies to Russia. This move created a new [[Anglo-Prussian alliance (1756)|Anglo-Prussian alliance]] and incensed the French court.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=297\u2013301}}</ref>\n\nAustria was now seeking warmer relations with France to ensure that the French would not take Prussia's side in a future conflict over Silesia. King [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] responded to Prussia's realignment with Britain by accepting Maria Theresa's invitation to a new [[Franco-Austrian alliance]], formalised with the [[First Treaty of Versailles]] in May 1756. This series of political manoeuvres came to be known as the [[Diplomatic Revolution]].<ref>{{Harvp|Horn|1957|pp=449\u2013464}}</ref><ref>{{Harvp|Black|1990|pp=301\u2013323}}</ref> Russia, likewise upset by the withdrawal of Britain's promised subsidies, drew closer to Austria and France, agreeing to a more openly offensive anti-Prussian coalition in April 1756. As France turned against Prussia and Russia separated from Britain, Kaunitz's plan thus matured into a grand anti-Prussian alliance between Austria, Russia, various lesser German powers, and France.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=293\u2013294}}</ref>\n\n===Preparations for war===\n[[File:Crown of Bohemia 1648.png|thumb|alt=Map of political borders in Central Europe in the early 1700s|Map of the [[Central Europe]]an region where the bulk of the war was fought, prior to Prussia's seizure of Silesia]]\nAs Austria and Russia made open preparations for renewed war, Frederick became convinced that Prussia would be attacked in early 1757. Rather than wait for his enemies to move at a time of their choosing, he resolved instead to act preemptively, beginning with an attack against the neighbouring [[Electorate of Saxony]], which he correctly believed was a secret party to the coalition against him.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=310}}</ref> Frederick's broad strategy had three parts. First, he meant to occupy Saxony, gaining [[strategic depth]] and using the Saxon army and treasury to bolster the Prussian war effort. Second, he would advance from Saxony into [[Bohemia]], where he might set up winter quarters at Austria's expense. Third, he would invade [[Moravia]] from Silesia, seize the fortress at [[Olm\u00fctz]], and advance on [[Vienna]] to force an end to the war.<ref name=\"Asprey 427\">{{Harvp|Asprey|1986|p=427}}</ref> He hoped to receive financial support from the British, who had also promised to send a naval squadron into the [[Baltic Sea]] to deter invasion of Prussia's coast, if necessary.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=308}}</ref>\n\nTo begin, Frederick divided Prussia's armies in three.

Thus, though Frederick's army was much reduced, he was left unmolested, which allowed him to secure the northern half of Silesia. The Russian army slowly advanced through Brandenburg, still struggling to supply its men by wagon train from magazines in Poland. Deprived of men, the Prussian defenders resorted to harassing convoys to delay the enemy advance, executing a number of successful raids.<ref name=\"Harvp|Redman|2014\">{{Harvp|Redman|2014}}</ref> Meanwhile, Laudon's Austrians gradually occupied more of southern Silesia, storming the fortress at Schweidnitz on 1 October.<ref>{{Harvp|Duffy|1975}}</ref>\n\nBeginning on 22 August, Russian forces under [[Zakhar Chernyshev]] and [[Pyotr Rumyantsev]] [[Siege of Kolberg (1761)|besieged and blockaded]] the Prussian Pomeranian port of [[Kolberg]]; the town was strongly defended and held out well, but several attempts to break the siege were repulsed. Then, in October Frederick ordered much of the garrison to withdraw to Berlin and defend Brandenburg; the town finally capitulated on 16 December. The fall of Kolberg cost Prussia its last port on the Baltic Sea,<ref>{{Harvp|Anderson|2000|p=492}}</ref> and it gave Russia a way to supply its armies in Central Europe by sea, rather than overland through Poland.

A total Prussian collapse seemed imminent; the British now threatened to withdraw their subsidies if Prussia did not offer concessions to secure peace, a threat that was made good later that year by the new British prime minister, [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Lord Bute]].<ref name=\"Harvp|Redman|2014\"/> Then, on 5 January 1762 the ailing Russian Empress Elizabeth died. Her nephew and successor, Tsar [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]], was an ardent admirer of Frederick's, and he at once reversed Elizabeth's foreign policy and ordered a [[ceasefire]] with Prussia.<ref name=\"Clark 204-5\">{{Harvp|Clark|2006|pp=204\u2013205}}</ref>\n\nPeter agreed to an [[armistice]] with Prussia in March and lifted the Russian occupation of East Prussia and Pomerania, redirecting his armies to [[Mecklenburg]] to threaten [[Denmark\u2013Norway|Denmark]] with war over his claims on the [[Duchy of Holstein-Gottorp]]. On 15 May Russia and Prussia formally ended their war with the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1762)|Treaty of Saint Petersburg]], confirming Prussia's pre-war borders in the north and east. Peter went on to mediate the 22 May [[Treaty of Hamburg (1762)|Treaty of Hamburg]], ending the Pomeranian War between Prussia and Sweden, with all of Prussia's Pomeranian territory preserved. After signing a new alliance with Prussia on 1 June, he even placed Chernyshev's corps of 18,000 Russian troops under Frederick's command; a second \"Miracle of the House of Brandenburg\" had occurred.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=457\u2013460}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, French morale had been sapped by prolonged British blockades, defeats in [[French and Indian War|North America]] and [[Third Carnatic War|India]], and a lack of progress in the Rhineland.<ref>{{Harvp|Anderson|2000|p=498}}</ref><ref name=\"Fraser 469\">{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=469}}</ref> After Russia's about-face and Sweden's withdrawal, King Louis realised that France was unlikely to gain its promised reward of the Austrian Netherlands.

The warring parties eventually agreed to simply restore their respective conquests to each other: Austria would withdraw from Glatz, restoring full Prussian control of Silesia, in exchange for Prussia's evacuation of Saxony, which would be returned to Frederick Augustus, who would receive no other reparations from Prussia. With these swaps, the borders in the region arrived precisely back at the ''[[status quo ante bellum]]''.<ref name=\"Schweizer 250\"/> Austria made a further concession by formally renouncing its claim to Silesia; in return, Prussia committed to support Maria Theresa's son, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Joseph]], in the forthcoming [[1764 Imperial election]]. With that, the belligerents agreed to end the Third Silesian War with the [[Treaty of Hubertusburg]], signed 15 February 1763.<ref name=\"Carlyle XX-XIII\"/>\n\n== Outcomes ==\n[[File:Johann Esaias Nilson Hubertusburger Frieden ubs G 0335 II.jpg|thumb|alt=Engraving of the faces of the monarchs who participated in the Third Silesian War set against an allegorical scene representing the return of peace|Contemporary engraving celebrating the restoration of peace in Germany|upright=1.2]]\nThe return to territorial ''status quo ante'' meant that none of the belligerents in the Silesian War gained the prizes they had aimed at: Prussia was unable to keep any part of Saxony, while Austria failed to recover its lost province of Silesia. Nonetheless, the outcome of the war has generally been considered a diplomatic victory for Prussia,<ref>{{Harvp|Browning|2005|p=530}}</ref> which not only retained Silesia, but also compelled Austria to acknowledge its sovereignty in the province, forestalling any further Silesian Wars. More fundamentally, Prussia showed itself to be a credible [[Austria\u2013Prussia rivalry|rival to Austria]] by successfully surviving intact what could have become a war of partition.<ref name=\"Clark 199-200\"/><ref name=\"Fraser 469\"/><ref name=\"Schweizer 250\"/>\n\n=== Prussia ===\nPrussia emerged from the war as a [[great power]] whose importance in Europe could no longer be disputed,<ref name=\"Schweizer 250\"/> establishing itself as the leading power of Protestant Germany.<ref>{{Harvp|Clark|2006|pp=215\u2013219}}</ref> The kingdom won general recognition of its sovereignty in Silesia, putting a stop to Austria's attempts to recover the province. Frederick the Great's personal reputation was enormously enhanced, as his debts to fortune (Russia's about-face after Elizabeth's death) and to British financial support were soon forgotten, while the memories of his energetic leadership and tactical successes were strenuously kept alive.<ref name=\"Marston 90\">{{Harvp|Marston|2001|p=90}}</ref>\n\nPrussia had held its own while being simultaneously invaded by Austria, Russia, Sweden, and France, an accomplishment that appeared miraculous to contemporary observers.<ref>{{Harvp|Clark|2006|p=200}}</ref> After 1763, armies around the world sent their officers to Prussia to learn the secrets of the state's outsize military power, making Prussia one of the most imitated states in Europe.<ref name=\"Marston 90\"/> Though sometimes depicted as a key moment in Prussia's rise to greatness, the war nonetheless left the kingdom's economy and population devastated (though Frederick's agrarian reforms and encouragement of immigration eventually eased both problems). Its armed forces had experienced heavy casualties, with around 180,000 men killed,<ref name=\"Clodfelter\"/> and the officer corps was severely depleted. The state had neither the money nor the manpower to rebuild the army to what it had been before the war.<ref>{{Harvp|Clark|2006|pp=210\u2013213}}</ref>\n\nBy 1772 Prussia's standing army was restored to 190,000 men, but few of the officers were veterans of the Silesian Wars.<ref>{{Harvp|Duffy|1985|p=245}}</ref> In the succeeding [[War of the Bavarian Succession]] (1778\u20131779) the Prussians fought poorly, despite again being personally led by Frederick, and the Prussian army did not fare well against [[revolutionary France]] in 1792\u20131795. In 1806 the Prussians were shattered by [[Napoleon]]'s French at the [[Battle of Jena]]; only after a series of reforms motivated by the disasters of 1806\u20131807 did Prussian military power again begin to grow.<ref>{{Harvp|Clark|2006|p=313}}</ref>\n\n=== Austria ===\nThe war exhausted Austria's finances, and its armed forces were greatly weakened, with more than 145,000 men dead or missing in the conflict.<ref name=\"Clodfelter\"/> Austria was not able to retake Silesia or realise any other territorial gains, but it did preserve Saxony from Prussian control, slowing the growth of its new northern rival. Its military performed far more respectably than during the War of the Austrian Succession, which seemed to vindicate Maria Theresa's administrative and military reforms since that war. Thus, the war in great part restored Austria's prestige and preserved its position as a major player in the European system.<ref name=\"Clark 216\">{{Harvp|Clark|2006|p=216}}</ref> By agreeing to vote for Archduke Joseph in the Imperial election, Frederick accepted the continuation of Habsburg preeminence in the Holy Roman Empire, though this was far less than Austria had hoped to win in the war.<ref name=\"Hochedlinger 346\">{{Harvp|Hochedlinger|2003|p=346}}</ref>\n\nPrussia's confirmation as a first-rate power and the enhanced prestige of its king and army were long-term threats to Austria's hegemony in Germany.<ref name=\"Clark 216\"/> Indeed, the Empire now held several ambitious middle powers eager to gain at Austria's expense. Frederick Augustus of Saxony was also King of Poland and could call on the resources of that realm to advance his interests in Germany. The Electorate of Hanover had gained tremendously through its personal union with Great Britain and could now bring British power to bear in German conflicts. [[Bavaria]]'s strength was also waxing, as it asserted military and foreign policies ever more independent from those of the Empire. The Silesian Wars made clear that the Habsburg Monarchy would need continued reform if it was to retain its dominant position in European power politics.<ref>{{Harvp|Clark|2006|p=212}}</ref> Austria's defeat by Prussia would become the driving factor behind wide-ranging efforts to modernize the Habsburg Monarchy over the next half century.<ref>{{Harvp|Hochedlinger|2003|p=267}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{Cite book|last=Anderson|first=Fred|author-link=Fred Anderson (historian)|title=Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754\u20131766|publisher=[[Vintage Books]]|location=New York|year=2000|isbn=978-0-375-70636-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jyuMqKzZJnUC|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Asprey|first=Robert B.|author-link=Robert B.

Traditionally, [[English-speaking countries]] employed commas as the delimiter &ndash; 10,000 &ndash; and other European countries employed periods or spaces: 10.000 or {{val|10000}}. Because of the confusion that could result in international documents, in recent years the use of spaces as separators has been advocated by the superseded [[ISO 31-0#Numbers|SI/ISO 31-0 standard]],<ref name=\"nist.gov\"/> as well as by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] and the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]], which have also begun advocating the use of a \"[[thin space]]\" in \"groups of three\".<ref name=\"BIPM\"/><ref name=\"old.iupac.org\"/> Within the United States, the [[American Medical Association]]'s widely followed ''[[AMA Manual of Style]]'' also calls for a thin space.<ref name=\"AMA10p793\"/> In some online [[character encoding|encoding]] environments (for example, [[ASCII]]-only) a thin space is not practical or available, in which case a regular word space or no delimiter are the alternatives.\n\n===Data versus mask===\nDigit group separators can occur either as part of the data or as a mask through which the data is displayed. This is an example of the [[separation of presentation and content]], making it possible to display numbers with spaced digit grouping in a way that does not insert any [[whitespace character]]s into the string of digits in the [[digital content|content]]. In many computing contexts, it is preferred to omit digit group separators from the data and instead overlay them as a mask (an [[input mask]] or an output mask). Common examples include [[spreadsheet]]s and [[database]]s in which currency values are entered without such marks but are displayed with them inserted. (Similarly, phone numbers can have hyphens, spaces, and/or parentheses as a mask rather than as data.) In [[web content]], such digit grouping can be done with [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS style]]. It is useful because the number can be [[cut, copy, and paste|copied and pasted]] into [[calculator]]s (including a web browser's [[omnibox]]) and parsed by the computer as-is (without the user manually purging the extraneous characters). For example, [[Wikipedia]] content can display numbers this way, as in the following examples: {{val|149597870700}} metres is 1 [[astronomical unit]]; {{gaps|3.14159|26535|89793|23846}} is [[pi|\u03c0]] rounded to 20 decimal places, and {{gaps|2.71828|18284|59045|23536}} is ''[[E (mathematical constant)|e]]'' rounded to 20 decimal places.\n\nIn some [[programming language]]s, it is possible to group the digits in the program's [[source code]] to make it easier to read; see [[Integer literal#Digit separators|Integer literal: Digit separators]]. [[Ada programming language|Ada]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] (from version 7.0), [[D (programming language)|D]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] (from GHC version 8.6.1), [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[OCaml]], [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]] (from version 3.6), [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]], [[Julia_(programming_language)|Julia]], and [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]] use the [[Underscore|underscore (_)]] character for this purpose; as such, these languages allow seven hundred million to be entered as 700_000_000. Fixed-form [[Fortran]] ignores [[whitespace character|whitespace]] (in all contexts), so 700&nbsp;000&nbsp;000 is permissible. [[C++14]], [[Rebol]], and [[Red_(programming_language)|Red]] allow the use of an [[apostrophe]] for digit grouping, so 700'000'000 is permissible.\n\n===Exceptions to digit grouping===\nThe [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] states that \"when there are only four digits before or after the decimal marker, it is customary not to use a space to isolate a single digit\".<ref name=BIPM/> Likewise, some [[Style guide|manuals of style]] state that thousands separators should not be used in normal text for numbers from 1,000 to 9,999 inclusive where no decimal fractional part is shown (in other words, for four-digit whole numbers), whereas others use thousands separators, and others use both. For example, [[APA style]] stipulates a thousands separator for \"most figures of 1,000 or more\" except for page numbers, binary digits, temperatures, etc.\n\nThere are always \"common-sense\" country-specific exceptions to digit grouping, such as year numbers, [[postal code]]s and ID numbers of predefined nongrouped format, which style guides usually point out.\n\n===In non-base-10 numbering systems===\nIn binary (base-2), a full space can be used between groups of four digits, corresponding to a [[nibble]], or equivalently to a [[hexadecimal]] digit.

A similar notation remains in common use as an underbar to superscript digits, especially for monetary values without a decimal separator, e.g. 99<sup>95</sup>. Later, a \"separatrix\" (a short, roughly vertical ink stroke) between the units and tenths position became the norm among [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Arab mathematicians]] (e.g. 99'''\u02cc'''95), while an L-shaped or [[vertical bar]] ({{!}}) served as the separatrix in England.<ref>{{citation |title=Oxford English Dictionary |contribution=separatrix, ''n.'' |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press }}</ref> When this character was [[typeset]], it was convenient to use the existing [[Comma (punctuation)|comma]] (99''','''95) or [[full stop]] (99'''.'''95) instead.\n\nPositional [[decimal fraction]]s appear for the first time in a book by the Arab mathematician [[Abu'l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi]] written in the 10th century.<ref name=Berggren>{{cite book | first=J.

Traditionally, [[English-speaking countries]] employed commas as the delimiter &ndash; 10,000 &ndash; and other European countries employed periods or spaces: 10.000 or {{val|10000}}. Because of the confusion that could result in international documents, in recent years the use of spaces as separators has been advocated by the superseded [[ISO 31-0#Numbers|SI/ISO 31-0 standard]],<ref name=\"nist.gov\"/> as well as by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] and the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]], which have also begun advocating the use of a \"[[thin space]]\" in \"groups of three\".<ref name=\"BIPM\"/><ref name=\"old.iupac.org\"/> Within the United States, the [[American Medical Association]]'s widely followed ''[[AMA Manual of Style]]'' also calls for a thin space.<ref name=\"AMA10p793\"/> In some online [[character encoding|encoding]] environments (for example, [[ASCII]]-only) a thin space is not practical or available, in which case a regular word space or no delimiter are the alternatives.\n\n===Data versus mask===\nDigit group separators can occur either as part of the data or as a mask through which the data is displayed. This is an example of the [[separation of presentation and content]], making it possible to display numbers with spaced digit grouping in a way that does not insert any [[whitespace character]]s into the string of digits in the [[digital content|content]]. In many computing contexts, it is preferred to omit digit group separators from the data and instead overlay them as a mask (an [[input mask]] or an output mask). Common examples include [[spreadsheet]]s and [[database]]s in which currency values are entered without such marks but are displayed with them inserted. (Similarly, phone numbers can have hyphens, spaces, and/or parentheses as a mask rather than as data.) In [[web content]], such digit grouping can be done with [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS style]]. It is useful because the number can be [[cut, copy, and paste|copied and pasted]] into [[calculator]]s (including a web browser's [[omnibox]]) and parsed by the computer as-is (without the user manually purging the extraneous characters). For example, [[Wikipedia]] content can display numbers this way, as in the following examples: {{val|149597870700}} metres is 1 [[astronomical unit]]; {{gaps|3.14159|26535|89793|23846}} is [[pi|\u03c0]] rounded to 20 decimal places, and {{gaps|2.71828|18284|59045|23536}} is ''[[E (mathematical constant)|e]]'' rounded to 20 decimal places.\n\nIn some [[programming language]]s, it is possible to group the digits in the program's [[source code]] to make it easier to read; see [[Integer literal#Digit separators|Integer literal: Digit separators]]. [[Ada programming language|Ada]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] (from version 7.0), [[D (programming language)|D]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] (from GHC version 8.6.1), [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[OCaml]], [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]] (from version 3.6), [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]], [[Julia_(programming_language)|Julia]], and [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]] use the [[Underscore|underscore (_)]] character for this purpose; as such, these languages allow seven hundred million to be entered as 700_000_000. Fixed-form [[Fortran]] ignores [[whitespace character|whitespace]] (in all contexts), so 700&nbsp;000&nbsp;000 is permissible. [[C++14]], [[Rebol]], and [[Red_(programming_language)|Red]] allow the use of an [[apostrophe]] for digit grouping, so 700'000'000 is permissible.\n\n===Exceptions to digit grouping===\nThe [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] states that \"when there are only four digits before or after the decimal marker, it is customary not to use a space to isolate a single digit\".<ref name=BIPM/> Likewise, some [[Style guide|manuals of style]] state that thousands separators should not be used in normal text for numbers from 1,000 to 9,999 inclusive where no decimal fractional part is shown (in other words, for four-digit whole numbers), whereas others use thousands separators, and others use both. For example, [[APA style]] stipulates a thousands separator for \"most figures of 1,000 or more\" except for page numbers, binary digits, temperatures, etc.\n\nThere are always \"common-sense\" country-specific exceptions to digit grouping, such as year numbers, [[postal code]]s and ID numbers of predefined nongrouped format, which style guides usually point out.\n\n===In non-base-10 numbering systems===\nIn binary (base-2), a full space can be used between groups of four digits, corresponding to a [[nibble]], or equivalently to a [[hexadecimal]] digit. For integer numbers, dots are used as well to separate groups of four bits.<ref name=\"DR-DEBUG_H\">As an example, the [[DR-DOS]] [[DEBUG (DOS command)|DEBUG]] <code>H</code> command displays the entered number in hexadecimal, decimal, octal and binary notation:<pre>-h 1234\n1234 #4660 \\011064 %0001.0010.0011.0100</pre></ref> Alternatively, binary digits may be grouped by threes, corresponding to an [[octal]] digit.

He said that in their vitriolic response to Taseer's piece Pakistan's liberals had exposed themselves and took on Haider point-for-point, saying \"that there is not and cannot be an \"Indian threat\" to Pakistan, simply because there is absolutely nothing Pakistan possesses that India wants.\" Ejaz Haider subsequently responded strongly stating \"Like every other state in the world, Pakistan is also a self-interested state and the rest of the world must live with this fact; three, we have no intention of defenestrating our military, even as we would continue to kick them to extract obedience; four, we don\u2019t need advice from across the border, especially because the Indian pundits crawled on their bellies when Mrs Indira Gandhi slapped her two-year emergency rule.

His central argument was that India \u2013 with its massive army arrayed along its border with Pakistan \u2013 left Pakistan with no choice but to be deeply concerned with its every move. Tharoor rose to Aatish Taseer's defense; writing in the ''[[Deccan Chronicle]]'', in a piece titled \"Delusional liberals\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/columnists/shashi-tharoor/delusional-liberals|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016005035/http://www.deccanchronicle.com/columnists/shashi-tharoor/delusional-liberals|url-status=dead|title=Deccan Chronicle|archivedate=16 October 2011}}</ref> he quoted Taseer's original piece extensively and said in general he \"admired the young man\u2019s writing\", and felt he had made \"his point in language that was both sharp [...] heartfelt and accurate\". He said that in their vitriolic response to Taseer's piece Pakistan's liberals had exposed themselves and took on Haider point-for-point, saying \"that there is not and cannot be an \"Indian threat\" to Pakistan, simply because there is absolutely nothing Pakistan possesses that India wants.\" Ejaz Haider subsequently responded strongly stating \"Like every other state in the world, Pakistan is also a self-interested state and the rest of the world must live with this fact; three, we have no intention of defenestrating our military, even as we would continue to kick them to extract obedience; four, we don\u2019t need advice from across the border, especially because the Indian pundits crawled on their bellies when Mrs Indira Gandhi slapped her two-year emergency rule.
