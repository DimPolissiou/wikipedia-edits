Peoples of the [[Marksville culture]], [[Troyville culture]], [[Coles Creek culture]] and [[Plaquemine culture]] built villages and earthwork mound sites throughout the area. Notable examples include the [[Filhiol Mound Site]], located on a natural levee of the Ouachita River.<ref name=FILHIOL>{{cite web|url=http://www.crt.state.la.us/archaeology/moundsguide/filhiol.html|title=Indian Mounds of Northeast Louisiana:Filhiol Mound|accessdate=2011-10-20|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20121224124606/http://www.crt.state.la.us/archaeology/moundsguide/filhiol.html|archivedate=2012-12-24}}</ref>\n\nThe oldest and most significant is [[Watson Brake]], the most ancient mound complex in North America, dated to 5400 BP (before present), or about 3500 [[BCE]]. Its dating changed archeologists' understanding of the antiquity of mounds in North America and what types of cultures constructed them. This site is located on private land and not available for viewing.\n\n===Historic era===\nThe parish was named after the [[Ouachita River]], which flows through southern [[Arkansas]] and northeastern Louisiana, and the [[Ouachita tribe]] who lived along it. Beginning about 1720, French settlers arrived in what became organized as modern Ouachita Parish. Colonists developed a plantation on Bayou DeSiard that used African slave labor. The [[Natchez people|Natchez]] Indians destroyed the Ouachita plantations during the [[Natchez Revolt]] of 1729-1731, and the French did not return.\n\nBeginning in the 1750s, [[Choctaw]] Indians began hunting in northern Louisiana, including the Ouachita country, expanding from their traditional territory in what is now Mississippi. At the time, only a few French families moved north into this area from the [[Opelousas|Opelousas Post]] on the [[Red River of the South|Red River]].\n\nFollowing its defeat in the [[Seven Years' War]], in 1763 France ceded its territories in North America east of the Mississippi River to the victor Great Britain. Spain took over French territories west of the Mississippi, including nominally in Louisiana. In 1769, [[Alejandro O'Reilly]], the first Spanish governor to rule successfully in West Louisiana, claimed Ouachita Parish for Spain. A census of the parish that year recorded 110 white people. In 1769 Spain abolished the Indian slave trade and Indian slavery in its colonies.\n\nEven in the 19th century, after the United States acquired this territory in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, some [[mixed-race]] American slaves were able to win [[freedom suits]] by proving Indian ancestry in their maternal line; under most southern state slave laws, children were born into the status of the mother. Thus a mixed-race child of an Indian mother or grandmother was legally free in former Spanish territory west of the Mississippi River, such as Louisiana, Arkansas or Missouri, as the Indians had been free people since 1769.\n\nIn 1783, Don [[Jean-Baptiste Filhiol|Juan Filhiol]] was among Frenchmen who began to work for the Spanish colonial government in Louisiana.  (He was born Jean-Baptiste Filhiol (1740) in Eymet, France (near [[Bordeaux]]), to French Calvinists Fran\u00e7ois Filhiol and Anne Marie Teyssonni\u00e8re, cloth merchants.)<ref name=\"polston\">[http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=3539 \"Don Juan Filhiol (1740\u20131821)\"], ''Encyclopedia of Arkansas Culture and History''; accessed 29 April 2018</ref> He was assigned that year to establish the first European outpost in the area of the Ouachita River Valley, called Poste d'Ouachita. With his wife, a few soldiers and slaves, his small party made the slow, arduous journey by [[keelboat]] up the Mississippi, Red, Black and Ouachita rivers to reach this area. In 1785 the European population of the entire Ouachita District (which extended into present-day Arkansas) was only 207.<ref name=\"filhiol\"/>\n\nOriginally based in Arkansas, Filhiol surveyed his grant and settled in 1785 at Prairie des Canots (included within the present-day city of Monroe). He gradually organized settlers, including trying to train some in military skills. He built Fort Miro on his land to provide protection for settlers from the Indians. At the same time, he worked to establish trade with the [[Chickasaw people]] and other Native Americans of the area. He was tasked with organizing the settlers in the Ouachita River Valley, while keeping out Americans and establishing good relations for trade with the Native Americans. Filhio served as commandant of Poste d'Ouachita until 1800, when he retired.

This was the vast former French territory (France had reacquired it from Spain for a brief period) west of the Mississippi and outside the Southwest and California, which were still Spanish territory. In 1819 the Americans renamed Fort Miro as the Ouachita Post. A year or so later, they changed the town's name to Monroe, after the first [[steamboat]] to reach it in travel up the Ouachita River. The arrival of the powered paddle wheeler was a landmark event, as it connected the town to much easier travel to and from other markets and stimulated its growth.\n\nOn March 31, 1807, the [[Territory of Orleans]] was divided into 19 sub-districts. The very large Ouachita Parish was one of these original 19; later it was broken up into eight other parishes (Morehouse, Caldwell, Union, Franklin, Tensas, Madison, East Carroll, and West Carroll), as more settlers entered the area and developed towns and plantations. Some brought slaves with them, but many bought slaves at markets. In the early 19th century, a total of one million slaves were forcibly moved through the domestic [[slave trade]] from the Upper South to the Deep South of the cotton plantation districts. They traveled overland or were shipped in the coastwise trade to Gulf ports.\n\n===Post-Reconstruction to present===\nFollowing the [[Reconstruction era]], as white Democrats regained control of the state government, they increasingly worked to re-establish dominance over the [[freedmen]] in Ouachita Parish. Elections were often won by intimidation and fraud, and they worked to establish [[white supremacy]]. Particularly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, [[Lynching in the United States|lynchings]] mostly of black men by white mobs in Ouachita and across the South were a form of racial terror by which the whites enforced their dominance. A 2015 study of lynchings found that from 1877 to 1950, a total of 38 people were lynched in Ouachita Parish.<ref name=\"eji\">[https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-third-edition-summary.pdf  \"Supplement: Lynchings by County/ Louisiana: Ouachita \", 3rd edition], from ''Lynching in America: Confronting the Legacy of Racial Terror'', 2015, Equal Justice Institute, Montgomery, Alabama</ref> This was the third-highest total in the state,<ref name=\"eji\"/> and the fifth-highest total of lynchings of any county in the South.<ref name=\"causey\">[http://www.thenewsstar.com/story/news/local/2015/02/24/ouachita-parishs-bloody-past-appears-lynching-study/23955319/ Kaleb Causey, \"Ouachita Parish's bloody past appears in lynching study\"], ''News-Star,'' 24 February 2015; accessed 20 August 2016</ref> Among the victims was George Bolden, an illiterate black man \"accused of writing a lewd note to a white woman.\" Before he went to trial, he was lynched near Monroe on April 30, 1919.<ref name=\"causey\"/>\n\nIn 1883, the first railroad bridge across the Ouachita River was built, improving connections for the town with other markets.\n\nIn 1916, the Monroe [[natural gas field]] was discovered. The field stretched more than  {{convert|500|sqmi|km2|sigfig=1}} and was estimated to have {{convert|6500000000000|cuft|km3|sigfig=2}} of natural gas in it. As a result, for a time the city of Monroe was known as the natural gas capital of the world. The new industry generated many jobs. From 1920 to 1930, the population of Ouachita Parish increased by more than 79 percent, to 54,000 people, as migrants arrived for work. (see Demographics section and table.)\n\nThe town of [[Sterlington, Louisiana|Sterlington]] was incorporated in August 1961, and in 1974 the town of [[Richwood, Louisiana|Richwood]] was incorporated. Ouachita Parish's boundaries have changed 23 times during its history, mostly due to the formation of other parishes in the 19th century.\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:Ouachita River in Monroe, LA IMG 1303.JPG|200px|right|thumb|The [[Ouachita River]] separates [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]] from [[West Monroe, Louisiana|West Monroe]] near the parish courthouse.]]\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the parish has a total area of {{convert|632|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|610|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|21|sqmi}} (3.4%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_22.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=August 20, 2014|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928155956/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_22.txt|archivedate=September 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Major highways===\n* [[Image:I-20.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 20]]\n* [[Image:US 80.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Highway 80]]\n* [[Image:US 165.svg|25px]] [[U.S. Highway 165]]\n* [[Image:Louisiana 2.svg|20px]] [[Louisiana Highway 2]]\n* [[Image:Louisiana 15.svg|20px]] [[Louisiana Highway 15]]\n* [[Image:Louisiana 34.svg|20px]] [[Louisiana Highway 34]]\n* [[Image:Louisiana 143.svg|20px]] [[Louisiana Highway 143]]\n\n===Adjacent parishes===\n* [[Union Parish, Louisiana|Union Parish]]  (north)\n* [[Morehouse Parish, Louisiana|Morehouse Parish]]  (northeast)\n* [[Richland Parish, Louisiana|Richland Parish]]  (east)\n* [[Caldwell Parish, Louisiana|Caldwell Parish]]  (south)\n* [[Jackson Parish, Louisiana|Jackson Parish]]  (southwest)\n* [[Lincoln Parish, Louisiana|Lincoln Parish]]  (west)\n\n===National protected areas===\n* [[Black Bayou Lake National Wildlife Refuge]]\n* [[D'Arbonne National Wildlife Refuge]] (part)\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1820= 2896\n|1830= 5140\n|1840= 4640\n|1850= 5008\n|1860= 4727\n|1870= 11582\n|1880= 14685\n|1890= 17985\n|1900= 20947\n|1910= 25830\n|1920= 30319\n|1930= 54337\n|1940= 59168\n|1950= 74713\n|1960= 101663\n|1970= 115387\n|1980= 139241\n|1990= 142191\n|2000= 147250\n|2010= 153720\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=154475\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=October 28, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=August 20, 2014}}</ref><br />1790-1960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=August 20, 2014}}</ref> 1900-1990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/la190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=August 20, 2014}}</ref><br />1990-2000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

Peoples of the [[Marksville culture]], [[Troyville culture]], [[Coles Creek culture]] and [[Plaquemine culture]] built villages and earthwork mound sites throughout the area. Notable examples include the [[Filhiol Mound Site]], located on a natural levee of the Ouachita River.<ref name=FILHIOL>{{cite web|url=http://www.crt.state.la.us/archaeology/moundsguide/filhiol.html|title=Indian Mounds of Northeast Louisiana:Filhiol Mound|accessdate=2011-10-20|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20121224124606/http://www.crt.state.la.us/archaeology/moundsguide/filhiol.html|archivedate=2012-12-24}}</ref>\n\nThe oldest and most significant is [[Watson Brake]], the most ancient mound complex in North America, dated to 5400 BP (before present), or about 3500 [[BCE]]. Its dating changed archeologists' understanding of the antiquity of mounds in North America and what types of cultures constructed them. This site is located on private land and not available for viewing.\n\n===Historic era===\nThe parish was named after the [[Ouachita River]], which flows through southern [[Arkansas]] and northeastern Louisiana, and the [[Ouachita tribe]] who lived along it. Beginning about 1720, French settlers arrived in what became organized as modern Ouachita Parish. Colonists developed a plantation on Bayou DeSiard that used African slave labor. The [[Natchez people|Natchez]] Indians destroyed the Ouachita plantations during the [[Natchez Revolt]] of 1729-1731, and the French did not return.\n\nBeginning in the 1750s, [[Choctaw]] Indians began hunting in northern Louisiana, including the Ouachita country, expanding from their traditional territory in what is now Mississippi. At the time, only a few French families moved north into this area from the [[Opelousas|Opelousas Post]] on the [[Red River of the South|Red River]].\n\nFollowing its defeat in the [[Seven Years' War]], in 1763 France ceded its territories in North America east of the Mississippi River to the victor Great Britain. Spain took over French territories west of the Mississippi, including nominally in Louisiana. In 1769, [[Alejandro O'Reilly]], the first Spanish governor to rule successfully in West Louisiana, claimed Ouachita Parish for Spain. A census of the parish that year recorded 110 white people. In 1769 Spain abolished the Indian slave trade and Indian slavery in its colonies.\n\nEven in the 19th century, after the United States acquired this territory in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, some [[mixed-race]] American slaves were able to win [[freedom suits]] by proving Indian ancestry in their maternal line; under most southern state slave laws, children were born into the status of the mother. Thus a mixed-race child of an Indian mother or grandmother was legally free in former Spanish territory west of the Mississippi River, such as Louisiana, Arkansas or Missouri, as the Indians had been free people since 1769.\n\nIn 1783, Don [[Jean-Baptiste Filhiol|Juan Filhiol]] was among Frenchmen who began to work for the Spanish colonial government in Louisiana.  (He was born Jean-Baptiste Filhiol (1740) in Eymet, France (near [[Bordeaux]]), to French Calvinists Fran\u00e7ois Filhiol and Anne Marie Teyssonni\u00e8re, cloth merchants.)<ref name=\"polston\">[http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=3539 \"Don Juan Filhiol (1740\u20131821)\"], ''Encyclopedia of Arkansas Culture and History''; accessed 29 April 2018</ref> He was assigned that year to establish the first European outpost in the area of the Ouachita River Valley, called Poste d'Ouachita. With his wife, a few soldiers and slaves, his small party made the slow, arduous journey by [[keelboat]] up the Mississippi, Red, Black and Ouachita rivers to reach this area. In 1785 the European population of the entire Ouachita District (which extended into present-day Arkansas) was only 207.<ref name=\"filhiol\"/>\n\nOriginally based in Arkansas, Filhiol surveyed his grant and settled in 1785 at Prairie des Canots (included within the present-day city of Monroe). He gradually organized settlers, including trying to train some in military skills. He built Fort Miro on his land to provide protection for settlers from the Indians. At the same time, he worked to establish trade with the [[Chickasaw people]] and other Native Americans of the area. He was tasked with organizing the settlers in the Ouachita River Valley, while keeping out Americans and establishing good relations for trade with the Native Americans. Filhio served as commandant of Poste d'Ouachita until 1800, when he retired. He continued to live on his plantation here.<ref name=\"filhiol\">[http://www.knowla.org/entry/506/ Kelby Ouchley, \"Don Juan Filhiol\"], KnowLA (''Encyclopedia of Louisiana'')</ref>\n\n===Acquired by United States===\nOther settlers and merchants were attracted to the trading post, which became known as Fort Miro, with a town developing by 1805, two years after the United States acquired the [[Louisiana Purchase]] from France. This was the vast former French territory (France had reacquired it from Spain for a brief period) west of the Mississippi and outside the Southwest and California, which were still Spanish territory. In 1819 the Americans renamed Fort Miro as the Ouachita Post. A year or so later, they changed the town's name to Monroe, after the first [[steamboat]] to reach it in travel up the Ouachita River. The arrival of the powered paddle wheeler was a landmark event, as it connected the town to much easier travel to and from other markets and stimulated its growth.\n\nOn March 31, 1807, the [[Territory of Orleans]] was divided into 19 sub-districts. The very large Ouachita Parish was one of these original 19; later it was broken up into eight other parishes (Morehouse, Caldwell, Union, Franklin, Tensas, Madison, East Carroll, and West Carroll), as more settlers entered the area and developed towns and plantations. Some brought slaves with them, but many bought slaves at markets. In the early 19th century, a total of one million slaves were forcibly moved through the domestic [[slave trade]] from the Upper South to the Deep South of the cotton plantation districts. They traveled overland or were shipped in the coastwise trade to Gulf ports.\n\n===Post-Reconstruction to present===\nFollowing the [[Reconstruction era]], as white Democrats regained control of the state government, they increasingly worked to re-establish dominance over the [[freedmen]] in Ouachita Parish. Elections were often won by intimidation and fraud, and they worked to establish [[white supremacy]]. Particularly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, [[Lynching in the United States|lynching]]s mostly of black men by white mobs in Ouachita and across the South were a form of racial terror by which the whites enforced their dominance. A 2015 study of lynchings found that from 1877 to 1950, a total of 38 people were lynched in Ouachita Parish.<ref name=\"eji\">[https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-third-edition-summary.pdf  \"Supplement: Lynchings by County/ Louisiana: Ouachita \", 3rd edition], from ''Lynching in America: Confronting the Legacy of Racial Terror'', 2015, Equal Justice Institute, Montgomery, Alabama</ref> This was the third-highest total in the state,<ref name=\"eji\"/> and the fifth-highest total of lynchings of any county in the South.<ref name=\"causey\">[http://www.thenewsstar.com/story/news/local/2015/02/24/ouachita-parishs-bloody-past-appears-lynching-study/23955319/ Kaleb Causey, \"Ouachita Parish's bloody past appears in lynching study\"], ''News-Star,'' 24 February 2015; accessed 20 August 2016</ref> Among the victims was George Bolden, an illiterate black man \"accused of writing a lewd note to a white woman.\" Before he went to trial, he was lynched near Monroe on April 30, 1919.<ref name=\"causey\"/>\n\nIn 1883, the first railroad bridge across the Ouachita River was built, improving connections for the town with other markets.\n\nIn 1916, the Monroe [[natural gas field]] was discovered. The field stretched more than  {{convert|500|sqmi|km2|sigfig=1}} and was estimated to have {{convert|6500000000000|cuft|km3|sigfig=2}} of natural gas in it. As a result, for a time the city of Monroe was known as the natural gas capital of the world. The new industry generated many jobs. From 1920 to 1930, the population of Ouachita Parish increased by more than 79 percent, to 54,000 people, as migrants arrived for work. (see Demographics section and table.)\n\nThe town of [[Sterlington, Louisiana|Sterlington]] was incorporated in August 1961, and in 1974 the town of [[Richwood, Louisiana|Richwood]] was incorporated. Ouachita Parish's boundaries have changed 23 times during its history, mostly due to the formation of other parishes in the 19th century.\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:Ouachita River in Monroe, LA IMG 1303.JPG|200px|right|thumb|The [[Ouachita River]] separates [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]] from [[West Monroe, Louisiana|West Monroe]] near the parish courthouse.]]\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the parish has a total area of {{convert|632|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|610|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|21|sqmi}} (3.4%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_22.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=August 20, 2014|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928155956/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_22.txt|archivedate=September 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Major highways===\n*[[Image:I-20.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 20]]\n*[[Image:US 80.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Highway 80]]\n*[[Image:US 165.svg|25px]] [[U.S. Highway 165]]\n*[[Image:Louisiana 2.svg|20px]] [[Louisiana Highway 2]]\n*[[Image:Louisiana 15.svg|20px]] [[Louisiana Highway 15]]\n*[[Image:Louisiana 34.svg|20px]] [[Louisiana Highway 34]]\n*[[Image:Louisiana 143.svg|20px]] [[Louisiana Highway 143]]\n\n===Adjacent parishes ===\n*[[Union Parish, Louisiana|Union Parish]]  (north)\n*[[Morehouse Parish, Louisiana|Morehouse Parish]]  (northeast)\n*[[Richland Parish, Louisiana|Richland Parish]]  (east)\n*[[Caldwell Parish, Louisiana|Caldwell Parish]]  (south)\n*[[Jackson Parish, Louisiana|Jackson Parish]]  (southwest)\n*[[Lincoln Parish, Louisiana|Lincoln Parish]]  (west)\n\n===National protected areas===\n* [[Black Bayou Lake National Wildlife Refuge]]\n* [[D'Arbonne National Wildlife Refuge]] (part)\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1820= 2896\n|1830= 5140\n|1840= 4640\n|1850= 5008\n|1860= 4727\n|1870= 11582\n|1880= 14685\n|1890= 17985\n|1900= 20947\n|1910= 25830\n|1920= 30319\n|1930= 54337\n|1940= 59168\n|1950= 74713\n|1960= 101663\n|1970= 115387\n|1980= 139241\n|1990= 142191\n|2000= 147250\n|2010= 153720\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=154475\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=October 28, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=August 20, 2014}}</ref><br />1790-1960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=August 20, 2014}}</ref> 1900-1990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/la190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=August 20, 2014}}</ref><br />1990-2000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

The term was first used in English in the British ''Cooperative Magazine'' in 1827 and came to be associated with the followers of the Owen such as the [[Rochdale Pioneers]], who founded the [[co-operative movement]]. Owen's followers stressed both [[participatory democracy]] and economic socialisation in the form of consumer [[co-operative]]s, [[credit unions]] and [[Mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]] societies. In the case of the [[Owenites]], they also overlapped with a number of other [[working-class]] and [[labour movement]]s such as the [[Chartism|Chartists]] in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Vincent|2010|p=88}}\n\n[[Fenner Brockway]] identified three early democratic socialist groups during the [[English Civil War]] in his book ''Britain's First Socialists'', namely the [[Levellers]], who were pioneers of political democracy and the sovereignty of the people; the [[Agitators]], who were the pioneers of [[Workers' control|participatory control by the ranks at their workplace]]; and the [[Diggers]], who were pioneers of communal ownership, [[cooperation]] and [[egalitarianism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Brockway|1y=1980|2a1=Hain|2y=1995|2p=12}} The philosophy and tradition of the Diggers and the Levellers was continued in the period described by [[E.

Leaders in the movement also called for a more equitable distribution of income and better living conditions for the working classes. The very first [[trade union]]s and [[consumers' cooperative]] societies also emerged in the hinterland of the Chartist movement as a way of bolstering the fight for these demands.{{sfn|Brandal|Bratberg|Thorsen|2013|p=20}} The first advocates of socialism favoured social levelling in order to create a [[meritocratic]] or [[technocratic]] society based on individual talent as opposed to aristocratic privilege.

Reformism arose as an alternative to revolution, with leading social democrat [[Eduard Bernstein]] proposing the concept of evolutionary socialism. Revolutionary socialists, encompassing multiple social and political movements that may define revolution differently from one another, quickly targeted the nascent ideology of reformism and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemned Bernstein's ''[[Eduard Bernstein#Opinions|Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay titled ''[[Social Reform or Revolution?]]'' The Social Democratic Party of Germany became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe despite being an illegal organisation until the [[anti-socialist laws]] were officially repealed in 1890. In the [[1893 German federal election|1893 federal elections]], the party gained about 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast according to Engels. In 1895, the year of his death, Engels highlighted ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'''s emphasis on winning as a first step the \"battle of democracy\".{{sfnm|1a1=Engels|1a2=Marx|1y=1848|1p=52|2a1=Steger|2y=1997|2pp=247\u2013259|3a1=Steger|3y=1999|3pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nIn his introduction to the 1895 edition of Karl Marx's ''[[The Class Struggles in France 1848\u20131850|The Class Struggles in France]]'', Engels attempted to resolve the division between gradualist [[Reformist socialism|reformist]] and [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary]] socialists in the Marxist movement by declaring that he was in favour of short-term tactics of electoral politics that included gradualist and evolutionary socialist policies while maintaining his belief that [[revolutionary]] seizure of power by the [[proletariat]] should remain a key goal of the socialist movement. In spite of this attempt by Engels to merge gradualism and revolution, his effort only diluted the distinction of gradualism and revolution and had the effect of strengthening the position of the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionists]].{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} Engels' statements in the French newspaper ''Le Figaro'' in which he argued that \"revolution\" and the \"so-called socialist society\" were not fixed concepts, but rather constantly changing social phenomena and said that this made \"us [socialists] all evolutionists\", increased the public perception that Engels was gravitating towards evolutionary socialism. Engels also wrote that it would be \"suicidal\" to talk about a revolutionary seizure of power at a time when the historical circumstances favoured a parliamentary road to power which he predicted could happen \"as early as 1898\".{{sfnm|1a1=Steger|1y=1997|1pp=247\u2013259|2a1=Steger|2y=1999|2pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nEngels' stance of openly accepting gradualist, evolutionary and parliamentary tactics while claiming that the historical circumstances did not favour revolution caused confusion among political commentators and the public. Bernstein interpreted this as indicating that Engels was moving towards accepting parliamentary reformist and gradualist stances, but he ignored that Engels' stances were tactical as a response to the particular circumstances at that time and that Engels was still committed to revolutionary socialism. As a result, Engels was deeply distressed when he discovered that his introduction to a new edition of ''The Class Struggles in France'' had been edited by Bernstein and [[Karl Kautsky]] in a manner which left the impression that he had become a proponent of a peaceful road to socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} On 1 April 1895, four months before his death, Engels wrote to Kautsky as follows: <blockquote>I was amazed to see today in the ''Vorw\u00e4rts'' an excerpt from my 'Introduction' that had been printed without my knowledge and tricked out in such a way as to present me as a peace-loving proponent of legality [at all costs].

In the view of democratic socialists, capitalism, based on the primacy of private property, generates inherent inequalities of wealth and power and a dominant egoism that are incompatible with the democratic values of freedom, equality, and solidarity. Only a socialist society can fully realize democratic practices. The internal conflicts within capitalism require a transition to socialism.

In the second, mainly post-war, phase, social democrats came to believe that their ideals and values could be achieved by reforming capitalism rather than abolishing it. They favored a mixed economy in which most industries would be privately owned, with only a small number of utilities and other essential services in public ownership. The idea of social democracy is now used to describe a society the economy of which is predominantly capitalist, but where the state acts to regulate the economy in the general interest, provides welfare services outside of it and attempts to alter the distribution of income and wealth in the name of social justice.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Safra|first=Jacob E.|year=1998|title=Social democracy|encyclopedia=The New Encyclopaedia Britannica|edition=15th|volume=10|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.|page=920|isbn=|quote=[...] a peaceful, evolutionary transition of society from capitalism to socialism using established political processes.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Schweickart|first=David|editor1-last=Anderson|editor1-first=Gary L.|editor2-last=Herr|editor2-first=Kathryn G.|year=2007|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice|title=Democratic Socialism|publisher=SAGE Publications|volume=1|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=9781412918121|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Stevens|first=Mark A.|year=2000|title=Social democracy|encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Encyclopedia|publisher=Merriam-Webster|page=1504|isbn=978-0-8777-9017-4|quote=Political ideology that advocates a peaceful, evolutionary transition of society from -capitalism to -socialism, using established political processes.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Wilson|first=Fred|date=10 July 2007|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill/|title=John Stuart Mill|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=17 March 2008|ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==== Journals ====\n{{refbegin|40em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Christopher S.|date=1 September 2009|title='Empty Nets': Social Democracy and the 'Catch-All Party Thesis' in Germany and Sweden|journal=Party Politics|volume=15|issue=5|pages=635\u2013653|doi=10.1177/1354068809336389|issn=13540688|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Andreasson|first=Stefan|year=2006|title=he African National Congress and its Critics: 'Predatory Liberalism', Black Empowerment and Intra-Alliance Tensions in Post-Apartheid South Africa|journal=Democratization|volume=13|issue=2|pages=303\u2013322|doi=10.1080/13510340500524018|issn=13510347|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Appadorai|first=A.|year=1968|title=Recent Socialist Thought in India|journal=The Review of Politics|volume=30|issue=3|pages=349\u2013362|doi=10.1017/S0034670500041024|jstor=1406397|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Avrich|first=Paul|date=July 1968|title=Russian Anarchists and the Civil War|journal=Russian Review|volume=27|issue=3|pages=296\u2013306|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Bardhan|first1=Pranab|last2=Roemer|first2=John E.|year=1992|title=Market Socialism: A Case for Rejuvenation|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=6|issue=3|pages=101\u2013116|doi=10.1257/jep.6.3.101|issn=08953309|ref=harv|doi-access=free}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Batson|first=Andrew|date=March 2017|url=http://www.cebc.org.br/sites/default/files/the_state_of_the_state_sector.pdf|title=The State of the State Sector|publisher=Gavekal Dragonomics|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Benedetto|first1=Giacomo|last2=Hix|first2=Simon|last3=Mastrorocco|first3=Nicola|url=http://personal.lse.ac.uk/hix/Working_Papers/BHM_Rise_and_Fall_of_SD.pdf|title=The Rise and Fall of Social Democracy, 1918\u20132017|date=1 July 2019|journal=Trinity Economics Papers|pages=1\u201343|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Berman|first1=Sheri|last2=Snegovaya|first2=Maria|url=https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/populism-and-the-decline-of-social-democracy/|title=Populism and the Decline of Social Democracy|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=30|issue=3|pages=5\u201319|date=10 July 2019|doi=10.1353/jod.2019.0038|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Bilgrami|first=S.

In the face of growing economic instability in the Eurozone, as well as massive anti- austerity protests on the peripheries of Europe, the \"victims of communism\" narrative may be linked to a public relations effort to link all leftist political ideals to the horrors of Stalinism. Such a rhetorical move seems all the more potent when discursively combined with the idea that there is a moral equivalence between Jewish victims of the Holocaust and East European victims of Stalinism. This third coming of the German Historikerstreit is related to the precariousness of global capitalism, and perhaps the elite desire to discredit all political ideologies that threaten the primacy of private property and free markets.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Gimpel|first1=James G.|last2=Hoffman|first2=Adam H.|last3=Kaufmann|first3=Karen M.|date=May 2003|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e2be0e64b470a870fc28ac6462c58160d1432899|title=A Promise Fulfilled?

Remarks in New York|publisher=Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum|accessdate=10 February 2020|quote=The directive was drafted by Senator Taft at that famous breakfast in New York City a few weeks ago. Senator Taft left that meeting and told the press what the General stands for. Taft explained that the great issue in this campaign is \"creeping socialism.\" Now that is the patented trademark of the special interest lobbies. Socialism is a scare word they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years. Socialism is what they called public power. Socialism is what they called social security. Socialism is what they called farm price supports. Socialism is what they called bank deposit insurance. Socialism is what they called the growth of free and independent labor organizations. Socialism is their name for almost anything that helps all the people. When the Republican candidate inscribes the slogan \"Down With Socialism\" on the banner of his \"great crusade,\" that is really not what he means at all. What he really means is, \"Down with Progress\u2014down with Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal,\" and \"down with Harry Truman's Fair Deal.\" That is what he means.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite

In the case of the [[Owenites]], they also overlapped with a number of other [[working-class]] and [[labour movement]]s such as the [[Chartism|Chartists]] in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Vincent|2010|p=88}}\n\n[[Fenner Brockway]] identified three early democratic socialist groups during the [[English Civil War]] in his book ''Britain's First Socialists'', namely the [[Levellers]], who were pioneers of political democracy and the sovereignty of the people; the [[Agitators]], who were the pioneers of [[Workers' control|participatory control by the ranks at their workplace]]; and the [[Diggers]], who were pioneers of communal ownership, [[cooperation]] and [[egalitarianism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Brockway|1y=1980|2a1=Hain|2y=1995|2p=12}} The philosophy and tradition of the Diggers and the Levellers was continued in the period described by [[E.

Leaders in the movement also called for a more equitable distribution of income and better living conditions for the working classes. The very first [[trade union]]s and [[consumers' cooperative]] societies also emerged in the hinterland of the Chartist movement as a way of bolstering the fight for these demands.{{sfn|Brandal|Bratberg|Thorsen|2013|p=20}} The first advocates of socialism favoured social levelling in order to create a [[meritocratic]] or [[technocratic]] society based on individual talent as opposed to aristocratic privilege. Saint-Simon is regarded as the first individual to coin the term socialism.{{sfn|Smitha}} Saint-Simon was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and advocated a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of [[capitalism]] and would be based on [[equal opportunities]].{{sfn|Australian National University (Birth of the Socialist Idea)}} He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was [[To each according to his contribution|ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work]].{{sfn|Smitha}} The key focus of Saint-Simon's socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was the key to the progress of human civilisation.{{sfn|Newman|2005}} This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress, embodying a desire for a more directed or [[planned economy]].{{sfn|Smitha}} The British political philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] also came to advocate a form of [[Liberal socialism|economic socialism within a liberal context]]. In later editions of ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' (1848), Mill would argue that \"as far as economic theory was concerned, there is nothing in principle in economic theory that precludes an economic order based on socialist policies\".{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2007|2a1=Baum|2y=2007|2ps=: \"Mill, in contrast, advances a form of liberal democratic socialism for the enlargement of freedom as well as to realize social and distributive justice.

Reformism arose as an alternative to revolution, with leading social democrat [[Eduard Bernstein]] proposing the concept of evolutionary socialism. Revolutionary socialists, encompassing multiple social and political movements that may define revolution differently from one another, quickly targeted the nascent ideology of reformism and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemned Bernstein's ''[[Eduard Bernstein#Opinions|Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay titled ''[[Social Reform or Revolution?]]'' The Social Democratic Party of Germany became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe despite being an illegal organisation until the [[anti-socialist laws]] were officially repealed in 1890. In the [[1893 German federal election|1893 federal elections]], the party gained about 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast according to Engels. In 1895, the year of his death, Engels highlighted ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'''s emphasis on winning as a first step the \"battle of democracy\".{{sfnm|1a1=Engels|1a2=Marx|1y=1848|1p=52|2a1=Steger|2y=1997|2pp=247\u2013259|3a1=Steger|3y=1999|3pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nIn his introduction to the 1895 edition of Karl Marx's ''[[The Class Struggles in France 1848\u20131850|The Class Struggles in France]]'', Engels attempted to resolve the division between gradualist [[Reformist socialism|reformist]] and [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary]] socialists in the Marxist movement by declaring that he was in favour of short-term tactics of electoral politics that included gradualist and evolutionary socialist policies while maintaining his belief that [[revolutionary]] seizure of power by the [[proletariat]] should remain a key goal of the socialist movement. In spite of this attempt by Engels to merge gradualism and revolution, his effort only diluted the distinction of gradualism and revolution and had the effect of strengthening the position of the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionists]].{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} Engels' statements in the French newspaper ''Le Figaro'' in which he argued that \"revolution\" and the \"so-called socialist society\" were not fixed concepts, but rather constantly changing social phenomena and said that this made \"us [socialists] all evolutionists\", increased the public perception that Engels was gravitating towards evolutionary socialism. Engels also wrote that it would be \"suicidal\" to talk about a revolutionary seizure of power at a time when the historical circumstances favoured a parliamentary road to power which he predicted could happen \"as early as 1898\".{{sfnm|1a1=Steger|1y=1997|1pp=247\u2013259|2a1=Steger|2y=1999|2pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nEngels' stance of openly accepting gradualist, evolutionary and parliamentary tactics while claiming that the historical circumstances did not favour revolution caused confusion among political commentators and the public. Bernstein interpreted this as indicating that Engels was moving towards accepting parliamentary reformist and gradualist stances, but he ignored that Engels' stances were tactical as a response to the particular circumstances at that time and that Engels was still committed to revolutionary socialism. As a result, Engels was deeply distressed when he discovered that his introduction to a new edition of ''The Class Struggles in France'' had been edited by Bernstein and [[Karl Kautsky]] in a manner which left the impression that he had become a proponent of a peaceful road to socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} On 1 April 1895, four months before his death, Engels wrote to Kautsky as follows: <blockquote>I was amazed to see today in the ''Vorw\u00e4rts'' an excerpt from my 'Introduction' that had been printed without my knowledge and tricked out in such a way as to present me as a peace-loving proponent of legality [at all costs].

In the view of democratic socialists, capitalism, based on the primacy of private property, generates inherent inequalities of wealth and power and a dominant egoism that are incompatible with the democratic values of freedom, equality, and solidarity. Only a socialist society can fully realize democratic practices. The internal conflicts within capitalism require a transition to socialism.

In the second, mainly post-war, phase, social democrats came to believe that their ideals and values could be achieved by reforming capitalism rather than abolishing it. They favored a mixed economy in which most industries would be privately owned, with only a small number of utilities and other essential services in public ownership. The idea of social democracy is now used to describe a society the economy of which is predominantly capitalist, but where the state acts to regulate the economy in the general interest, provides welfare services outside of it and attempts to alter the distribution of income and wealth in the name of social justice.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Safra|first=Jacob E.|year=1998|title=Social democracy|encyclopedia=The New Encyclopaedia Britannica|edition=15th|volume=10|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.|page=920|isbn=|quote=[...] a peaceful, evolutionary transition of society from capitalism to socialism using established political processes.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Schweickart|first=David|editor1-last=Anderson|editor1-first=Gary L.|editor2-last=Herr|editor2-first=Kathryn G.|year=2007|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice|title=Democratic Socialism|publisher=SAGE Publications|volume=1|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=9781412918121|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Stevens|first=Mark A.|year=2000|title=Social democracy|encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Encyclopedia|publisher=Merriam-Webster|page=1504|isbn=978-0-8777-9017-4|quote=Political ideology that advocates a peaceful, evolutionary transition of society from -capitalism to -socialism, using established political processes.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Wilson|first=Fred|date=10 July 2007|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill/|title=John Stuart Mill|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=17 March 2008|ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==== Journals ====\n{{refbegin|40em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Christopher S.|date=1 September 2009|title='Empty Nets': Social Democracy and the 'Catch-All Party Thesis' in Germany and Sweden|journal=Party Politics|volume=15|issue=5|pages=635\u2013653|doi=10.1177/1354068809336389|issn=13540688|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Andreasson|first=Stefan|year=2006|title=he African National Congress and its Critics: 'Predatory Liberalism', Black Empowerment and Intra-Alliance Tensions in Post-Apartheid South Africa|journal=Democratization|volume=13|issue=2|pages=303\u2013322|doi=10.1080/13510340500524018|issn=13510347|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Appadorai|first=A.|year=1968|title=Recent Socialist Thought in India|journal=The Review of Politics|volume=30|issue=3|pages=349\u2013362|doi=10.1017/S0034670500041024|jstor=1406397|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Avrich|first=Paul|date=July 1968|title=Russian Anarchists and the Civil War|journal=Russian Review|volume=27|issue=3|pages=296\u2013306|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Bardhan|first1=Pranab|last2=Roemer|first2=John E.|year=1992|title=Market Socialism: A Case for Rejuvenation|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=6|issue=3|pages=101\u2013116|doi=10.1257/jep.6.3.101|issn=08953309|ref=harv|doi-access=free}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Batson|first=Andrew|date=March 2017|url=http://www.cebc.org.br/sites/default/files/the_state_of_the_state_sector.pdf|title=The State of the State Sector|publisher=Gavekal Dragonomics|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Benedetto|first1=Giacomo|last2=Hix|first2=Simon|last3=Mastrorocco|first3=Nicola|url=http://personal.lse.ac.uk/hix/Working_Papers/BHM_Rise_and_Fall_of_SD.pdf|title=The Rise and Fall of Social Democracy, 1918\u20132017|date=1 July 2019|journal=Trinity Economics Papers|pages=1\u201343|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Berman|first1=Sheri|last2=Snegovaya|first2=Maria|url=https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/populism-and-the-decline-of-social-democracy/|title=Populism and the Decline of Social Democracy|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=30|issue=3|pages=5\u201319|date=10 July 2019|doi=10.1353/jod.2019.0038|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Bilgrami|first=S.

In the face of growing economic instability in the Eurozone, as well as massive anti- austerity protests on the peripheries of Europe, the \"victims of communism\" narrative may be linked to a public relations effort to link all leftist political ideals to the horrors of Stalinism. Such a rhetorical move seems all the more potent when discursively combined with the idea that there is a moral equivalence between Jewish victims of the Holocaust and East European victims of Stalinism. This third coming of the German Historikerstreit is related to the precariousness of global capitalism, and perhaps the elite desire to discredit all political ideologies that threaten the primacy of private property and free markets.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Gimpel|first1=James G.|last2=Hoffman|first2=Adam H.|last3=Kaufmann|first3=Karen M.|date=May 2003|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e2be0e64b470a870fc28ac6462c58160d1432899|title=A Promise Fulfilled?

Remarks in New York|publisher=Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum|accessdate=10 February 2020|quote=The directive was drafted by Senator Taft at that famous breakfast in New York City a few weeks ago. Senator Taft left that meeting and told the press what the General stands for. Taft explained that the great issue in this campaign is \"creeping socialism.\" Now that is the patented trademark of the special interest lobbies. Socialism is a scare word they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years. Socialism is what they called public power. Socialism is what they called social security. Socialism is what they called farm price supports. Socialism is what they called bank deposit insurance. Socialism is what they called the growth of free and independent labor organizations. Socialism is their name for almost anything that helps all the people. When the Republican candidate inscribes the slogan \"Down With Socialism\" on the banner of his \"great crusade,\" that is really not what he means at all. What he really means is, \"Down with Progress\u2014down with Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal,\" and \"down with Harry Truman's Fair Deal.\" That is what he means.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite

The film stars [[Ava Michelle]], [[Griffin Gluck]], [[Sabrina Carpenter]], [[Paris Berelc]], Luke Eisner, Clara Wilsey, Anjelika Washington, Rico Paris, [[Angela Kinsey]], and [[Steve Zahn]]. It was released by [[Netflix]] on September 13, 2019.\n\n== Plot ==\nJodi Kreyman is sixteen years old and {{height|ft=6|in=1+1/2}} tall. She has been perceived as unusually tall since she was three, a source of insecurity for her, not helped by her dad's worry that her height is a medical risk. Students continually ask Jodi \"how's the weather up there?\", eventually causing Jodi's friend Fareeda to snap at one boy. Contrastingly, Jodi's older sister Harper is of average height and a winner of multiple [[beauty pageant]]s. A boy in Jodi's class who always carries a milk crate, Dunkleman, frequently asks her out, but she is reluctant to date somebody she has known for so long, or someone shorter than her.\n\nStig Mohlin, a Swedish foreign exchange student, joins Jodi's class, and she is immediately taken aback by his looks and intelligence. However, Kimmy Stitcher\u2014a bully\u2014starts showing him around. Dunkleman is distressed to learn that Stig will be staying in his house, his mother having volunteered to be the host family. Jodi asks her sister for help getting Stig to notice her but Harper does not believe Jodi can get an exchange student to be interested in her unless she stops dressing like a little boy. After a week of watching Kimmy follow Stig around, Jodi tells Harper that she is jealous. Harper and their mother go shopping with her to find a homecoming dress and to change Jodi's style.\n\nKimmy, now in a relationship with Stig, gets her friend Schnipper to prank call Jodi pretending to be Stig and asking her to the homecoming dance. To Fareeda's frustration, Jodi hides in the bathroom to avoid Kimmy. Stumbling across Stig playing the piano, he encourages her to play and they sing the duet \"[[I've Never Been in Love Before]]\" from the musical ''[[Guys and Dolls]]''.\n\nWhen she returns home, Jodi's father has organised a Tip Toppers chapter meeting in their house\u2014a club for tall people\u2014but rather than encouraging, she finds it upsetting. Stig calls and she yells at him, thinking it is another prank call, but he invites her to watch musicals with him. She turns up to Dunkleman's house and his shock turns to jealousy when he realizes she is there to see Stig. Dunkleman continually interrupts their evening, but as Stig escorts Jodi home, they kiss. Feeling guilty, Stig asks Dunkleman for advice and he tells him to focus on being with Kimmy. Jodi gets angry at Dunkleman when she learns this.\n\nMeanwhile, another girl\u2014Liz\u2014asks Dunkleman on a date. Schnipper likes Jodi so he gets Kimmy to ask her to join them for an [[escape room]]; Jodi ditches a concert with Fareeda to go. In the escape room, they kiss in couples: Jodi and Schnipper, Kimmy and Stig and Dunkleman and Liz, until Jodi gets frustrated and leaves. Jealous, Stig talks to Jodi and agrees to go on a date to Harper's pageant competition. Harper wins, but Stig does not turn up. At Dunkleman's party, Stig explains that he lost track of time helping Dunkleman set up.\n\nDunkleman rejects Liz when she asks him to the homecoming dance. He gives Jodi a present\u2014high heels\u2014to apologize for being a bad friend. Jodi discovers that after she left the party, Kimmy confronted Stig and he pretended that Jodi had unrequited love for him, but Dunkleman tries to hit him. Dunkleman stands up for Jodi, leading to a fight between Dunkleman and Schnipper.\n\nAt the homecoming dance, Kimmy and Stig are crowned Homecoming Queen and King, but he breaks up with her. Jodi arrives in the high heels Dunkleman gave her and makes a speech expressing newfound confidence in herself. Stig asks Jodi out but she rejects him. She talks to Dunkleman: he reveals the reason he always carries a milk crate as he stands on it and leans in to kiss her.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ava Michelle]] as Jodi Kreyman, a self-conscious 16-year-old girl who is {{height|ft=6|in=1+1/2}} tall.\n* [[Griffin Gluck]] as Jack Dunkleman, a friend of Jodi's who has made his crush on her well known for years.\n* Luke Eisner as Stig Mohlin, a Swedish foreign exchange student who is staying with Dunkleman.\n* Clara Wilsey as Kimmy Stitcher, a selfish but conventionally attractive girl who mocks Jodi.\n* [[Sabrina Carpenter]] as Harper Kreyman, Jodi's older sister and a pageant queen with horrible allergies.\n* [[Paris Berelc]] as Liz, a kind friend of Kimmy's with a crush on Dunkleman.\n* Rico Paris as Schnipper, a boy who, along with Kimmy, has tormented Jodi since they were kids.\n* Anjelika Washington as Fareeda, Jodi's best friend.\n* [[Angela Kinsey]] as Helaine Kreyman, a former pageant queen, Harper and Jodi's mother, and Richie's wife.\n* [[Steve Zahn]] as Richie Kreyman, Harper and Jodi's paranoid father, and Helaine's husband, who tries hard to help Jodi feel normal. \n* Bria Condon as Crystal Spitz\n* Shane Guilbeau as Bob Brickman\n* Christina Moses as Nina Dunkleman, Jack's mother.\n* Andrew Brodeur as Will\n* Jason Rogel as Dr. Sager\n* Gralen Bryant Banks as Principal O'Sullivan\n* Kelly Murtagh as Ms. Novey\n* Chima Chekwa as Maison Voodoo Presenter\n* Kerry Cahill as Gina, a Tip Toppers member.\n\n== Production ==\nIn November 2018, it was announced that [[Netflix]] would collaborate with [[McG]] of [[Wonderland Sound and Vision]] for a fourth time on the film ''Tall Girl'', with [[Nzingha Stewart]] set as the director.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2018/11/netflix-mcg-director-nzingha-stewart-tall-girl-teen-comedy-1202494585/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=November 2, 2018|title=Netflix, McG & Director Nzingha Stewart Team On 'Tall Girl' Teen Comedy|last=N'Duka|first=Amanda|access-date=January 29, 2019}}</ref> In January 2019, Ava Michelle, [[Griffin Gluck]], Luke Eisner, [[Sabrina Carpenter]], [[Paris Berelc]], [[Steve Zahn]], [[Angela Kinsey]], Anjelika Washington, Clara Wilsey, and Rico Paris joined the cast of the film.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/netflix-casts-ava-michelle-tall-girl-1178756|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=Billboard-Hollywood Reporter Media Group|date=January 24, 2019|title=Netflix Finds Its 'Tall Girl'|last=Kilday|first=Gregg|access-date=January 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Principal photography]] on the film began in January 2019 in [[New Orleans]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://decider.com/2019/01/24/ava-michelle-tall-girl-netflix/|website=Decider|publisher=[[News Corp (2013\u2013present)|News Corp]]|date=January 24, 2019|title=Ava Michelle to Star in Netflix Teen Romance 'Tall Girl'|last=Hipes|first=Patrick|access-date=January 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe trailer was released on August 29, 2019,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/first-trailer-netflix-tall-girl-teen-rom-com-tall-people-everywhere|title=\"Tall Girl\" Is Netflix's New Teen Rom-Com for Tall People Everywhere|last=Dodson|first=P.

{"title_page": "Anti-imperialism", "text_new": "''' Anti-imperialism''' in [[political science]] and [[international relations]] is a term used in a variety of contexts, usually by [[nationalist]] movements who want to secede from a larger polity (usually in the form of an [[empire]], but also in a multi-ethnic [[sovereign state]]) or as a specific theory opposed to [[capitalism]] in [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] discourse, derived from [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s work ''[[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism]]''. A less common usage is by supporters of a [[non-interventionist]] foreign policy.\n\nPeople who categorize themselves as anti-imperialists often state that they are opposed to [[colonialism]], colonial empires, [[hegemony]], [[imperialism]] and the territorial expansion of a country beyond its established borders.<ref>Richard Koebner and Helmut Schmidt, ''Imperialism: The Story and Significance of a Political Word, 1840\u20131960'' (2010).</ref> The phrase gained a wide currency after the [[Second World War]] and at the onset of the [[Cold War]] as political movements in colonies of European powers promoted national sovereignty. Some anti-imperialist groups who opposed the [[American imperialism|United States]] supported the power of the [[Soviet Union]], such as in [[Guevarism]], while in [[Maoism]] this was criticized as [[social imperialism]].\n\n== Theory ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1990-023-06A, Otto von Bismarck.jpg|thumb|German Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] repeatedly let it be known that he disliked imperialism, but German public opinion forced him to build an empire in Africa and the Pacific in the 1880s<ref name=OvBlautHUW>{{cite book|author=[[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]]|title=Bismarck und der Imperialismus / Bismarck and Imperialism| work=Review of Politics, [[Cambridge University Press|CUP]]|jstor=1406534|publisher=Kiepensheuer & Witsch, Cologne|date=1969}}</ref>]]\nIn the late 1870s, the term \"imperialism\" was introduced to the English language by opponents of the aggressively imperial policies of British Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] (1874\u20131880).<ref name=\"auto1\">Richard Koebner and Helmut Schmidt, ''Imperialism: The Story and Significance of a Political Word, 1840-1960'' (2010)</ref> It was shortly appropriated by supporters of \"imperialism\" such as [[Joseph Chamberlain]]. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest; and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed. [[John A. Hobson]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]] added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term. Many theoreticians on the left have followed either or both in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of \"imperialism\". Such writers have expanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a global system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to [[Christopher Columbus]] and in some facts to the [[Crusades]].  As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural and the temporal. Those changes reflect\u2014among other shifts in sensibility\u2014a growing unease with the fact of power, specifically Western power.<ref>Mark F. Proudman, \"Words for Scholars: The Semantics of 'Imperialism'\". ''Journal of the Historical Society'', September 2008, Vol. 8 Issue 3, p395-433</ref><ref>D. K. Fieldhouse, \"Imperialism\": An Historiographical Revision\", ''South African Journal of Economic History'', March 1992, Vol. 7 Issue 1, pp 45-72</ref>\n\nNEGRO ALERTThe relationships among [[capitalism]], [[aristocracy]] and [[imperialism]] have been discussed and analysed by theoreticians, historians, political scientists such as [[John A. Hobson]] and [[Thorstein Veblen]], [[Joseph Schumpeter]] and [[Norman Angell]].<ref>G.K. Peatling, \u201cGlobalism, Hegemonism and British Power: J. A. Hobson and Alfred Zimmern Reconsidered\u201d, ''History'', July 2004, Vol. 89 Issue 295, pp. 381\u201398</ref> Those intellectuals produced much of their works about imperialism before the [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918), yet their combined work informed the study of the impact of imperialism upon Europe and contributed to the political and ideologic reflections on the rise of the [[military\u2013industrial complex]] in the United States from the 1950s onwards.\n\n===Hobson===\n{{Main|Imperialism (Hobson)}}\n\n[[John A. Hobson]] strongly influenced the anti-imperialism of both Marxists  and liberals, worldwide through his 1902 book on ''Imperialism.'' He argued that the \"taproot of imperialism\" is not in [[nationalism|nationalist pride]], but in Capitalism. As a form of economic organization, imperialism is unnecessary and immoral, the result of the mis-distribution of wealth in a capitalist society. That  created an irresistible desire to extend the national markets into foreign lands, in search of profits greater than those available in the Mother Country. In the capitalist economy, rich capitalists received a disproportionately higher income than did the working class. If the owners invested their incomes to their factories, the greatly increased productive capacity would exceed the growth in demand for the products and services of said factories.  Lenin adopted Hobson's ideas to argue that capitalism was doomed and would eventually be replaced by socialism, the sooner the better.\n\nHobson was also influential in liberal circles, especially the British Liberal Party.<ref>David Long, ''Towards a new liberal internationalism: the international theory of JA Hobson'' (1996).</ref> Historians Peter Duignan and [[Lewis H. Gann]] argue that Hobson had an enormous influence in the early 20th century that caused widespread distrust of imperialism: \n\n{{quote|Hobson's ideas were not entirely original; however his hatred of moneyed men and monopolies, his loathing of secret compacts and public bluster, fused all existing indictments of imperialism into one coherent system....His ideas influenced German nationalist opponents of the British Empire as well as French Anglophobes and Marxists; they colored the thoughts of American liberals and isolationist critics of colonialism. In days to come they were to contribute to American distrust of Western Europe and of the British Empire. Hobson helped make the British averse to the exercise of colonial rule; he provided indigenous nationalists in Asia and Africa with the ammunition to resist rule from Europe.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite book|author1=Peter Duignan|author2=Lewis H.

Hobson theorized that state intervention through taxation could boost broader consumption, create wealth and encourage a peaceful multilateral world order. Conversely, should the state not intervene, rentiers (people who earn income from property or securities) would generate socially negative wealth that fostered imperialism and protectionism.<ref>P.

These movements, and their anti-imperialist ideas, were instrumental in the [[decolonization]] process of the 1950s and 1960s, which saw most European colonies in Asia and Africa achieving their independence.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n== In the United States  ==\n{{main|American Anti-Imperialist League}} \nAn early use of the term \"anti-imperialist\" occurred after the United States entered the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] in 1898.<ref>Robert L. Beisner, ''Twelve against Empire: The Anti-Imperialists, 1898\u20131900'' (1968)</ref> Most activists supported the war itself, but opposed the annexation of new territory, especially the Philippines.<ref>Julius Pratt, ''Expansionists of 1898: The Acquisition of Hawaii and the Spanish Islands'' (1936) pp 266\u201378</ref> The [[American Anti-Imperialist League|Anti-Imperialist League]] was founded on June 15, 1898, in Boston in opposition of the acquisition of the Philippines, which would happen anyway. The anti-imperialists opposed the expansion because they believed imperialism violated the [[Republicanism in the United States|credo of republicanism]], especially the need for \"[[consent of the governed]]\". Appalled by American imperialism, the Anti-Imperialist League, which included famous citizens such as [[Andrew Carnegie]], [[Henry James]], [[William James]] and [[Mark Twain]], formed a platform which stated:<!-- This quote can be cut down/ expanded based on the whims of any reader looking. -->\n<!-- At the document cited. -->\n{{quotation|We hold that the policy known as imperialism is hostile to liberty and tends toward militarism, an evil from which it has been our glory to be free. We regret that it has become necessary in the land of Washington and Lincoln to reaffirm that all men, of whatever race or color, are entitled to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We maintain that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. We insist that the subjugation of any people is \"criminal aggression\" and open disloyalty to the distinctive principles of our Government...\n\nWe cordially invite the cooperation of all men and women who remain loyal to the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1899antiimp.asp |title=Platform of the American Antilmperialist League, 1899|publisher=Fordham University|accessdate=2 February 2013}}</ref>}}\n\nFred Harrington states that \"the anti-imperialist's did not oppose expansion because of commercial, religious, constitutional, or humanitarian reasons but instead because they thought that an imperialist policy ran counter to the political doctrines of the Declaration of Independence, Washington's Farewell Address, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address\".<ref>Harrington, 1935, pp 211\u201312</ref><ref>Richard E.

(1970)</ref>\n\nAn important influence on American intellectuals was the work of British writer [[John A. Hobson]]. especially [[Imperialism (Hobson)|''Imperialism: A Study'' (1902).]]  Historians Peter Duignan and Lewis H. Gann argue that Hobson had an enormous influence in the early 20th century that caused widespread distrust of imperialism: \n\n{{quote|Hobson's ...hatred of moneyed men and monopolies, his loathing of secret compacts and public bluster, fused all existing indictments of imperialism into one coherent system....His ideas influenced German nationalist opponents of the British Empire as well as French Anglophobes and Marxists; they colored the thoughts of American liberals and isolationist critics of colonialism.

American textbooks denounced imperialism as a major cause of the World War. The uglier aspects of British colonial rule were emphasized, recalling the long-standing anti-British sentiments in the United States.<ref>{{cite book|author=Cornell University|title=The Impact of the war on America: six lectures by members of the faculty of Cornell university|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MTlnAAAAMAAJ|year=1942|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=50}}</ref>\n\n== In Britain and Canada==\nBritish anti-imperialism emerged in the 1890s, especially in the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. For over a century, back to the days of [[Adam Smith]] in 1776, economists had been hostile to imperialism on the grounds that it is a violation of the principles of free trade; they never formed a popular movement. Indeed imperialism seems to have been generally popular before the 1890s.<ref>Robert Livingston Schuyler,  \"The rise of anti-imperialism in England.\" Political science quarterly 37.3 (1922): 440-471. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2142146 in JSTOR]</ref> The key impetus around 1900 came from public disgust with the British failures and atrocities connected with the [[Second Boer War]] (1899\u20131902). The war was fought against the [[Afrikaners]], who were Dutch immigrants who had built new nations in South Africa. [[Opposition to the Second Boer War]] was modest when the war began and was always less widespread than support for it, let alone the prevailing indifference. However, influential groups formed immediately and ineffectually against the war, including the [[South African Conciliation Committee]] and [[William Thomas Stead|W. T. Stead]]'s [[Stop the War Committee]]. Much of the opposition in Britain came from the Liberal Party. Intellectuals and activists Britain based in the socialist, labour and Fabian movements generally oppose imperialism and [[John A. Hobson]], a Liberal, took many of his ideas from their writings.<ref>Gregory Claeys, ''Imperial Sceptics: British Critics of Empire, 1850\u20131920'' (2010) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=EkSU5kUscOMC  excerpt]</ref> After the Boer war, opponents of imperialism turn their attention to the British colonies in Africa and Asia.<ref>Bernard Porter, ''Critics of Empire: British Radical Attitudes to Colonialism in Africa 1895-1914'' (1968).</ref> By the 1920s, the government was sponsoring large-scale exhibits promoting imperialism, notably the 1924 [[British Empire Exhibition]] in London and the 1938 [[Glasgow Empire Exhibition]].

Heath, ''War with a Silver Lining: Canadian Protestant Churches and the South African War, 1899-1902'' (McGill-Queen's Press-MQUP, 2009).</ref> A little opposition also came from some English immigrants such as the intellectual leader [[Goldwin Smith]].<ref>R.

Much of the impetus came from colonial students studying at Oxford and Cambridge, such as [[Mahatma Gandhi]].\n\n== Marxism-Leninism ==\n[[File:Lenin 1920.jpg|thumb|200px|To the Russian revolutionary [[Vladimir Lenin]], imperialism was the highest, but degenerate, stage of capitalism]]\nIn the mid-19th century, [[Karl Marx]] mentioned imperialism to be part of the prehistory of the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] in ''[[Das Kapital]]'' (1867\u20131894). Much more important was [[Vladimir Lenin]], who defined imperialism as \"the highest stage of capitalism\", the economic stage in which [[monopoly]] finance capital becomes the dominant application of capital.<ref>\"Imperialism\", ''The Penguin Dictionary of International Relations'' (1998), by Graham Evans and Jeffrey Newnham. p. 244.</ref> As such, said financial and economic circumstances impelled national governments and private business corporations to worldwide competition for control of natural resources and human labour by means of [[colonialism]].<ref name=\"auto\">\"Colonialism\", ''The Penguin Dictionary of International Relations'' (1998) Graham Evans and Jeffrey Newnham, p. 79.</ref>\n\nThe [[Leninism|Leninist]] views of imperialism and related theories, such as [[dependency theory]], address the economic [[dominance (ethology)|dominance]] and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of a country, rather than the military and the political dominance of a people, their country and its natural resources. Hence, the primary purpose of imperialism is economic exploitation, rather than mere control of either a country or of a region. The Marxist and the Leninist denotation thus differs from the usual political science denotation of imperialism as the direct control (intervention, occupation and rule) characteristic of colonial and [[neocolonialism|neo-colonial]] empires as used in the realm of [[international relations]].<ref>\"Imperialism\", ''The Penguin Dictionary of International Relations'' (1998) Graham Evans and Jeffrey Newnham, p. 79.</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nIn ''[[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism]]'' (1917), Lenin outlined the five features of capitalist development that lead to imperialism:\n# Concentration of production and capital leading to the dominance of national and multinational monopolies and cartels.\n# Industrial capital as the dominant form of capital has been replaced by [[finance capitalism|finance capital]], with the industrial capitalists increasingly reliant on capital provided by monopolistic financial institutions. \"Again and again, the final word in the development of banking is monopoly\".\n# The export of the aforementioned finance capital is emphasized over the export of goods.\n# The economic division of the world by multinational cartels.\n# The political division of the world into colonies by the great powers, in which the great powers monopolise investment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/|accessdate=2011-02-13|title=Lenin: Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism}}</ref>\n\nGenerally, the relationship among Marxists and radical, left-wing organisations who are [[anti-war]], often involves persuading such political activists to progress from [[pacifism]] to anti-imperialism\u2014that is, to progress from the opposition of war, in general, to the condemnation of the capitalist economic system, in particular.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20020711081333/http://www.cpgb.org.uk/worker/403/pacifism_disarms.html</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century, the [[Soviet Union]] represented themselves as the foremost enemy of imperialism and thus politically and materially supported [[Third World]] revolutionary organisations who fought for national independence. The Soviet Union sent military advisors to [[Ethiopia]], [[Angola]], [[Egypt]] and [[Afghanistan]].\n\nHowever, [[anarchism|anarchists]] characterized Soviet foreign policy as imperialism and cited it as evidence that the philosophy of Marxism would not resolve and eliminate imperialism.

A less common usage is by supporters of a [[non-interventionist]] foreign policy.\n\nPeople who categorize themselves as anti-imperialists often state that they are opposed to [[colonialism]], colonial empires, [[hegemony]], [[imperialism]] and the territorial expansion of a country beyond its established borders.<ref>Richard Koebner and Helmut Schmidt, ''Imperialism: The Story and Significance of a Political Word, 1840\u20131960'' (2010).</ref> The phrase gained a wide currency after the [[Second World War]] and at the onset of the [[Cold War]] as political movements in colonies of European powers promoted national sovereignty. Some anti-imperialist groups who opposed the [[American imperialism|United States]] supported the power of the [[Soviet Union]], such as in [[Guevarism]], while in [[Maoism]] this was criticized as [[social imperialism]].\n\n== Theory ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1990-023-06A, Otto von Bismarck.jpg|thumb|German Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] repeatedly let it be known that he disliked imperialism, but German public opinion forced him to build an empire in Africa and the Pacific in the 1880s<ref name=OvBlautHUW>{{cite book|author=[[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]]|title=Bismarck und der Imperialismus / Bismarck and Imperialism| work=Review of Politics, [[Cambridge University Press|CUP]]|jstor=1406534|publisher=Kiepensheuer & Witsch, Cologne|date=1969}}</ref>]]\nIn the late 1870s, the term \"imperialism\" was introduced to the English language by opponents of the aggressively imperial policies of British Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] (1874\u20131880).<ref name=\"auto1\">Richard Koebner and Helmut Schmidt, ''Imperialism: The Story and Significance of a Political Word, 1840-1960'' (2010)</ref> It was shortly appropriated by supporters of \"imperialism\" such as [[Joseph Chamberlain]]. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest; and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed. [[John A. Hobson]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]] added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term. Many theoreticians on the left have followed either or both in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of \"imperialism\". Such writers have expanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a global system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to [[Christopher Columbus]] and in some facts to the [[Crusades]].  As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural and the temporal. Those changes reflect\u2014among other shifts in sensibility\u2014a growing unease with the fact of power, specifically Western power.<ref>Mark F.

Hobson]] strongly influenced the anti-imperialism of both Marxists  and liberals, worldwide through his 1902 book on ''Imperialism.'' He argued that the \"taproot of imperialism\" is not in [[nationalism|nationalist pride]], but in Capitalism. As a form of economic organization, imperialism is unnecessary and immoral, the result of the mis-distribution of wealth in a capitalist society. That  created an irresistible desire to extend the national markets into foreign lands, in search of profits greater than those available in the Mother Country. In the capitalist economy, rich capitalists received a disproportionately higher income than did the working class. If the owners invested their incomes to their factories, the greatly increased productive capacity would exceed the growth in demand for the products and services of said factories.  Lenin adopted Hobson's ideas to argue that capitalism was doomed and would eventually be replaced by socialism, the sooner the better.\n\nHobson was also influential in liberal circles, especially the British Liberal Party.<ref>David Long, ''Towards a new liberal internationalism: the international theory of JA Hobson'' (1996).</ref> Historians Peter Duignan and [[Lewis H. Gann]] argue that Hobson had an enormous influence in the early 20th century that caused widespread distrust of imperialism: \n\n{{quote|Hobson's ideas were not entirely original; however his hatred of moneyed men and monopolies, his loathing of secret compacts and public bluster, fused all existing indictments of imperialism into one coherent system....His ideas influenced German nationalist opponents of the British Empire as well as French Anglophobes and Marxists; they colored the thoughts of American liberals and isolationist critics of colonialism. In days to come they were to contribute to American distrust of Western Europe and of the British Empire.

Hobson theorized that state intervention through taxation could boost broader consumption, create wealth and encourage a peaceful multilateral world order. Conversely, should the state not intervene, rentiers (people who earn income from property or securities) would generate socially negative wealth that fostered imperialism and protectionism.<ref>P.

Appalled by American imperialism, the Anti-Imperialist League, which included famous citizens such as [[Andrew Carnegie]], [[Henry James]], [[William James]] and [[Mark Twain]], formed a platform which stated:<!-- This quote can be cut down/ expanded based on the whims of any reader looking. -->\n<!-- At the document cited. -->\n{{quotation|We hold that the policy known as imperialism is hostile to liberty and tends toward militarism, an evil from which it has been our glory to be free.

For over a century, back to the days of [[Adam Smith]] in 1776, economists had been hostile to imperialism on the grounds that it is a violation of the principles of free trade; they never formed a popular movement.

The war was fought against the [[Afrikaners]], who were Dutch immigrants who had built new nations in South Africa. [[Opposition to the Second Boer War]] was modest when the war began and was always less widespread than support for it, let alone the prevailing indifference. However, influential groups formed immediately and ineffectually against the war, including the [[South African Conciliation Committee]] and [[William Thomas Stead|W. T.

Much of the impetus came from colonial students studying at Oxford and Cambridge, such as [[Mahatma Gandhi]].\n\n== Marxism-Leninism ==\n[[File:Lenin 1920.jpg|thumb|200px|To the Russian revolutionary [[Vladimir Lenin]], imperialism was the highest, but degenerate, stage of capitalism]]\nIn the mid-19th century, [[Karl Marx]] mentioned imperialism to be part of the prehistory of the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] in ''[[Das Kapital]]'' (1867\u20131894). Much more important was [[Vladimir Lenin]], who defined imperialism as \"the highest stage of capitalism\", the economic stage in which [[monopoly]] finance capital becomes the dominant application of capital.<ref>\"Imperialism\", ''The Penguin Dictionary of International Relations'' (1998), by Graham Evans and Jeffrey Newnham. p. 244.</ref> As such, said financial and economic circumstances impelled national governments and private business corporations to worldwide competition for control of natural resources and human labour by means of [[colonialism]].<ref name=\"auto\">\"Colonialism\", ''The Penguin Dictionary of International Relations'' (1998) Graham Evans and Jeffrey Newnham, p. 79.</ref>\n\nThe [[Leninism|Leninist]] views of imperialism and related theories, such as [[dependency theory]], address the economic [[dominance (ethology)|dominance]] and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of a country, rather than the military and the political dominance of a people, their country and its natural resources. Hence, the primary purpose of imperialism is economic exploitation, rather than mere control of either a country or of a region. The Marxist and the Leninist denotation thus differs from the usual political science denotation of imperialism as the direct control (intervention, occupation and rule) characteristic of colonial and [[neocolonialism|neo-colonial]] empires as used in the realm of [[international relations]].<ref>\"Imperialism\", ''The Penguin Dictionary of International Relations'' (1998) Graham Evans and Jeffrey Newnham, p. 79.</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nIn ''[[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism]]'' (1917), Lenin outlined the five features of capitalist development that lead to imperialism:\n# Concentration of production and capital leading to the dominance of national and multinational monopolies and cartels.\n# Industrial capital as the dominant form of capital has been replaced by [[finance capitalism|finance capital]], with the industrial capitalists increasingly reliant on capital provided by monopolistic financial institutions. \"Again and again, the final word in the development of banking is monopoly\".\n# The export of the aforementioned finance capital is emphasized over the export of goods.\n# The economic division of the world by multinational cartels.\n# The political division of the world into colonies by the great powers, in which the great powers monopolise investment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/|accessdate=2011-02-13|title=Lenin: Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism}}</ref>\n\nGenerally, the relationship among Marxists and radical, left-wing organisations who are [[anti-war]], often involves persuading such political activists to progress from [[pacifism]] to anti-imperialism\u2014that is, to progress from the opposition of war, in general, to the condemnation of the capitalist economic system, in particular.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20020711081333/http://www.cpgb.org.uk/worker/403/pacifism_disarms.html</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century, the [[Soviet Union]] represented themselves as the foremost enemy of imperialism and thus politically and materially supported [[Third World]] revolutionary organisations who fought for national independence. The Soviet Union sent military advisors to [[Ethiopia]], [[Angola]], [[Egypt]] and [[Afghanistan]].\n\nHowever, [[anarchism|anarchists]] characterized Soviet foreign policy as imperialism and cited it as evidence that the philosophy of Marxism would not resolve and eliminate imperialism. [[Mao Zedong]] developed the theory that the Soviet Union was a [[Social imperialism|social imperialist]] nation, a socialist people with tendencies to imperialism, an important aspect of Maoist analysis of the history of the Soviet Union.<ref>''Battling Western Imperialism: Mao, Stalin, and the United States'' (1997), by Michael M. Sheng. p.00.</ref> Contemporarily, the term \"anti-imperialism\" is most commonly applied by Marxists and political organisations of like ideologic bent who propose anti-capitalism, present a [[Class struggle|class analysis]] of society and the like.<ref>''Marxist Theories of Imperialism: A Critical Survey'' (1990), by Anthony Brewer. p. 293.</ref>\n\n[[File:Che Guevara June 2, 1959.jpg|thumb|200px|To the Latin American revolutionary [[Che Guevara]], imperialism was a capitalistic geopolitical system of control and repression which must be understood as such in order to be defeated]]\nAbout the nature of imperialism and how to oppose and defeat it, the revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] said: {{quotation|imperialism is a world system, the last stage of capitalism\u2014and it must be defeated in a world confrontation. The strategic end of this struggle should be the destruction of imperialism. Our share, the responsibility of the exploited and underdeveloped of the world, is to eliminate the foundations of imperialism: our oppressed nations, from where they extract capitals, raw materials, technicians, and cheap labor, and to which they export new capitals\u2014instruments of domination\u2014arms and all kinds of articles; thus submerging us in an absolute dependence.|[[Che Guevara]], Message to the Tricontinental, 1967<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1967/04/16.htm Che Guevara: Message to the Tricontinental] Spring of 1967.</ref>}}\n\n== Right-wing anti-imperialism ==\nRight-wing [[nationalist]]s and religious fundamentalist movements that have emerged in reaction to alleged imperialism might also fall within this category. For example, [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Khomeinism]] historically derived much of its popularity from its appeal to widespread anger at American intervention or influence in [[Iran]] and the Middle East.\n\nIn Africa, examples of right wing anti-imperialist groups are [[UNITA|National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)]] and [[National Liberation Front of Angola]]\n\nThe Indian [[Jamaat-e-Islami Hind]] launched a ten-day Nationwide campaign titled Anti-Imperialism Campaign in December 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/jamaat-to-launch-nation-wide-anti-imperialism-campaign_586298.html|title=Jamaat to launch nation-wide `anti-imperialism` campaign|date=December 10, 2009|website=Zee News}}</ref>\n\nIn Europe, examples of right-wing anti-imperialism include the [[Republican Party of Armenia]] and the [[Serbian Radical Party]].\n\n== Criticism ==\n[[Antonio Negri]] and [[Michael Hardt]] assert that traditional anti-imperialism is no longer relevant. In the book ''[[Empire (Hardt and Negri book)|Empire]]'',<ref>Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt, ''Empire'', Harvard University Press (2001) {{ISBN|0-674-00671-2}}</ref> Negri and Hardt argue that imperialism is no longer the practice or domain of any one nation or state. Rather, they claim, the \"Empire\" is a conglomeration of all states, nations, corporations, media, popular and intellectual culture and so forth; and thus, traditional anti-imperialist methods and strategies can no longer be applied against them.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Politics}}\n* [[Anti-Americanism]]\n* [[Antimilitarism]]\n* [[Anti-Western sentiment]]\n* [[Colonialism]]\n* [[Decentralization]]\n* [[Empire-building]]\n* [[Historiography of the British Empire]]\n* [[League against Imperialism]]\n* [[Localism (politics)]]\n* [[National liberation wars]]\n* [[National self-determination]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* Griffiths, Martin, and Terry O'Callaghan, and [[Steven C.

Although preclinical evidence on SEGRAMs\u2019 anti-inflammatory effects are culminating,<ref name=\"Sundahl P&T 2015\"/> currently, the efficacy of these SEGRAMs on cancer are largely unknown.\n\nSelective glucocorticoid receptor agonists (SEGRAs) are historically and typically steroidal in structure while selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators (SEGRMs) are typically [[nonsteroidal]]. The combined abbreviation of selective glucocorticoid receptor agonist and modulator is '''SEGRAM'''.<ref name=\"Sundahl P&T 2015\"/>  A number of such ligands have been developed and are being evaluated in preclinical and clinical testing.\n\nSEGRAMs achieve their selectivity by triggering only a subset the [[glucocorticoid receptor]] mechanisms of action.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /><ref name=\"Biggadike\" />\n\n== History ==\n\nSynthetic [[steroid]]s with SEGRA-like properties were already discovered in the late 1990s.<ref name=\"Vayssiere\" /> During the 2000s, many potential SEGRAMs were synthesized, most of them having nonsteroidal structures. In ''in vitro studies in cellular models'' these SEGRAM molecules bind to the [[glucocorticoid receptor]] with an affinity similar to [[dexamethasone]], a potent glucocorticoid, and with an ability to repress the production of inflammatory mediators such as [[interleukin 6]] and [[prostaglandin E2]].<ref name=\"A 276575\" />  Moreover, ''in vitro'' a particular SEGRAM can promote apoptosis in [[prostate cancer]]<ref name=\"Yemelyanov 2008\"/> and [[leukemia]].<ref name=\"Lesovaya 2011\"/>\n\nIn vivo studies in mice and rats showed that a topically administered SEGRAM inhibited [[peroxidase]] activity and formation of [[oedema]], both indicators of anti-inflammatory activity, comparably to [[prednisolone]]. Systemic administration in mice or rats indicate that SEGRAMs can diminish acute [[infections]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[asthma]] and [[colitis]].<ref name=\"Sundahl P&T 2015\"/> ''In vivo'' evidence on whether particular SEGRAMs can elicit similar effects than classic glucocorticoid in cancer pathologies is currently lacking.\nCurrent preclinical tests show that the SEGRAMs available so far would elicit fewer side effect or at least less grave side effects than classic glucocorticoids would.<ref name=\"Sundahl P&T 2015\"/> For example, skin atrophy in rats was significantly less pronounced than under prednisolone in a study using the SEGRAM [[Mapracorat]], and [[metabolic]] effects like weight gain or increase of [[blood glucose]] were practically inexistent.<ref name=\"ZK 209614\" />\n\n== Mechanism of action ==\n[[File:A 276575 structure.svg|thumb|The benzopyranoquinoline A 276575, an example of a SEGRA with a more [[corticosteroid]]-like structure<ref name=\"A 276575\" />]]\nBoth non-selective glucocorticoids and selective glucocorticoid receptor agonists work by binding to and activating the [[glucocorticoid receptor]] (GR). In contrast to glucocorticoids, which activate the GR to work through (at least) two [[signal transduction]] pathways,<ref name=\"pmid16236742\" /> SEGRAMs activate the GR in such a way that it only operates through one of the two main possible pathways.<ref name=\"pmid17622575\" />\n\nIn the absence of glucocorticoids, the GR resides in the [[cytosol]] in an inactive state complexed with [[heat shock protein]]s (HSPs) and [[immunophilins]].  Binding of glucocorticoids to the GR activates the receptor by causing a [[conformational change]] in the GR and thus a dissociation of the bound HSPs.  The activated GR can then regulate gene expression via one of two pathways:<ref name=\"pmid16236742\" />\n\n;Transactivation: The first (direct) pathway is called [[transactivation]] whereby the activated GR [[protein dimer|dimer]]izes, is [[protein targeting|translocated]] into the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] and binds to specific sequences of [[DNA]] called [[hormone response element|glucocorticoid response elements]] (GREs).  The GR/DNA complex recruits other proteins which transcribe downstream DNA into [[messenger RNA|mRNA]] and eventually [[protein]].  Examples of glucocorticoid-responsive genes include those that encode [[annexin A1]], [[TSC22D3]] (also known as GILZ), [[angiotensin-converting enzyme]], [[neutral endopeptidase]] and other anti-inflammatory proteins.\n;Transrepression: The second (indirect) pathway is called [[transrepression]], in which activated [[monomer]]ic GR binds to other transcription factors such as [[NF-\u03baB]] and [[AP-1 (transcription factor)|AP-1]] and prevents these from up-regulating the expression of their target genes.  These target genes encode proteins such as [[cyclooxygenase]], [[Nitric oxide synthase|NO synthase]], [[phospholipase A2]], [[tumor necrosis factor]], [[transforming growth factor beta]], [[ICAM-1]], and a number of other pro-inflammatory proteins.\n\n[[File:SEGRAM basic mechanism.tif|thumb|Simplified overview of the mechanism of action of a classical glucocorticoid vs the mechanism of action of a SEGRAM]]\t\n\nHence the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids results from both transactivation and transrepression.  In contrast, studies in rats and mice have shown that most of the side effects of glucocorticoids, such as [[diabetogenic]] activity, [[osteoporosis]], as well as skin atrophy, are mainly caused by transactivation.<ref name=\"ZK 209614\" /><ref name=\"OEAZ\" /><ref name=\"Coghlan\" />  A selective glucocorticoid that is able to transrepress without transactivation should preserve many of the desirable therapeutic anti-inflammatory effects and minimize these particular undesired side effects.<ref name=\"pmid17622575\" />\n\nInitial evidence that transpression alone can be sufficient for an anti-inflammatory response was provided by introducing a [[point mutation]] in the GR of mice that prevented GR from dimerizing and binding to DNA and thereby blocking transactivation.<ref name=\"pmid9604929\" /><ref name=\"pmid11076028\" />  At the same time, this mutation did not interfere with transrepression.  While GR is essential for survival, these mice are still viable.<ref name=\"pmid9604929\"/>  However, when these mice were treated with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, there was no elevation of glucose.  These dexamethasone-treated mice were resistant to an inflammatory stimulus.<ref name=\"pmid11076028\"/>  Hence, these mice were responsive to the anti-inflammatory effects of dexamethasone but were resistant to at least some of the side effects.\n\nJust like glucocorticoids, SEGRAMs bind to and activate GR. However, in contrast to glucocorticoids, SEGRAMs selectively activate the GR in such a way that they yield an improved therapeutic benefit. Generally, for specific inflammation-based diseases, SEGRAMs should more strongly transrepress than transactivate, or better yet solely transrepress and fail to transactivate. This type of selective GR activation should result in fewer side effects than the expected side effects that appear with a chronic treatment with classic glucocorticoids.<ref name=\"Schaecke\" />\n\n== Clinical trials ==\n\nPhase II clinical trials with one of the candidate compounds, mapracorat (code names BOL-303242-X and ZK&nbsp;245186<ref name=\"Cavet\" />), started in summer 2009. One was a [[double blind]] dose finding study for an [[ointment]] against atopic dermatitis conducted by [[Intendis]], a part of [[Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals]] specialized on [[dermatology]].<ref name=\"NCT00944632\" /> A Phase III trial started in November 2010, evaluating an [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmic]] [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] for the treatment of inflammation following cataract surgery, conducted by [[Bausch & Lomb]].<ref name=\"NCT01230125\" />\n\nA phase II trial with another dissociated glucocorticoid [[fosdagrocorat]] (PF-04171327) (a phosphate ester [[prodrug]] of [[dagrocorat]] (PF-00251802)<ref name=\"urlAmerican College of Rheumatology\"/><ref name=\"pmid21558312\"/>) for rheumatoid arthritis was started in 2011 by [[Pfizer]].<ref name=\"NCT01393639\"/>\n\nThe results of these clinical trials have not yet been disclosed and no SEGRAM has as yet been approved for clinical use.\n\n== Potential applications ==\n\nIn chronic inflammatory diseases like atopic dermatitis (skin), rheumatoid arthritis (joints),..., the side effects of corticosteroids are problematic because of the necessary long-term treatment. Therefore, SEGRAMs are being investigated as an alternative topical treatment. Systemic long-term treatment of inflammations with corticosteroids is particularly liable to cause metabolic side-effects, which makes the development of oral SEGRAMs an interesting goal.<ref name=\"Schaecke2002\"/> It remains to be seen whether selective receptor agonists or modulators indeed cause significantly less side-effects than classical corticoids in clinical applications.\n\n== Beneficial atrophic effects ==\n\nOf note, the atrophic effects of glucocorticoids are not always a disadvantage. The treatment of hyperproliferative diseases like psoriasis makes use of this property.<ref name=\"Kerscher\"/> SEGRAMs would likely be less effective in such conditions. Recent advances have shown that the former striving towards a total separation of GR transrepression and transactivation by using SEGRAMs deserves to be nuanced as the anti-inflammatory genes stimulated by GR transactivation, such as [[TSC22D3|GILZ]] and [[DUSP1]], do seem to play an important role.<ref name=\"Newton 2014\"/><ref name=\"Ayroldi 2014\"/> Nevertheless, the more selective nature of these SEGRAMs would still reduce the number of GR-mediated side effects, and deserves further clinical testing.\n\n== Chemistry ==\n[[File:RU 24858 skeletal.svg|thumb|RU 24858, a SEGRA with steroid structure<ref name=\"Vayssiere\" />]]\n[[File:Octahydrophenanthrene-2,7-diol SEGRA.svg|thumb|An octahydrophenanthrene-2,7-diol derivative with SEGRA properties<ref name=\"Robinson\" />]]\nEarly SEGRAs were synthetic steroids.

In contrast to glucocorticoids, which activate the GR to work through (at least) two [[signal transduction]] pathways,<ref name=\"pmid16236742\" /> SEGRAMs activate the GR in such a way that it only operates through one of the two main possible pathways.<ref name=\"pmid17622575\" />\n\nIn the absence of glucocorticoids, the GR resides in the [[cytosol]] in an inactive state complexed with [[heat shock protein]]s (HSPs) and [[immunophilins]].  Binding of glucocorticoids to the GR activates the receptor by causing a [[conformational change]] in the GR and thus a dissociation of the bound HSPs.  The activated GR can then regulate gene expression via one of two pathways:<ref name=\"pmid16236742\" />\n\n;Transactivation: The first (direct) pathway is called [[transactivation]] whereby the activated GR [[protein dimer|dimer]]izes, is [[protein targeting|translocated]] into the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] and binds to specific sequences of [[DNA]] called [[hormone response element|glucocorticoid response elements]] (GREs).  The GR/DNA complex recruits other proteins which transcribe downstream DNA into [[messenger RNA|mRNA]] and eventually [[protein]].  Examples of glucocorticoid-responsive genes include those that encode [[annexin A1]], [[TSC22D3]] (also known as GILZ), [[angiotensin-converting enzyme]], [[neutral endopeptidase]] and other anti-inflammatory proteins.\n;Transrepression: The second (indirect) pathway is called [[transrepression]], in which activated [[monomer]]ic GR binds to other transcription factors such as [[NF-\u03baB]] and [[AP-1 (transcription factor)|AP-1]] and prevents these from up-regulating the expression of their target genes.  These target genes encode proteins such as [[cyclooxygenase]], [[Nitric oxide synthase|NO synthase]], [[phospholipase A2]], [[tumor necrosis factor]], [[transforming growth factor beta]], [[ICAM-1]], and a number of other pro-inflammatory proteins.\n\n[[File:SEGRAM basic mechanism.tif|thumb|Simplified overview of the mechanism of action of a classical glucocorticoid vs the mechanism of action of a SEGRAM]]\t\n\nHence the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids results from both transactivation and transrepression.  In contrast, studies in rats and mice have shown that most of the side effects of glucocorticoids, such as [[diabetogenic]] activity, [[osteoporosis]], as well as skin atrophy, are mainly caused by transactivation.<ref name=\"ZK 209614\" /><ref name=\"OEAZ\" /><ref name=\"Coghlan\" />  A selective glucocorticoid that is able to transrepress without transactivation should preserve many of the desirable therapeutic anti-inflammatory effects and minimize these particular undesired side effects.<ref name=\"pmid17622575\" />\n\nInitial evidence that transpression alone can be sufficient for an anti-inflammatory response was provided by introducing a [[point mutation]] in the GR of mice that prevented GR from dimerizing and binding to DNA and thereby blocking transactivation.<ref name=\"pmid9604929\" /><ref name=\"pmid11076028\" />  At the same time, this mutation did not interfere with transrepression.  While GR is essential for survival, these mice are still viable.<ref name=\"pmid9604929\"/>  However, when these mice were treated with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, there was no elevation of glucose.  These dexamethasone-treated mice were resistant to an inflammatory stimulus.<ref name=\"pmid11076028\"/>  Hence, these mice were responsive to the anti-inflammatory effects of dexamethasone but were resistant to at least some of the side effects.\n\nJust like glucocorticoids, SEGRAMs bind to and activate GR. However, in contrast to glucocorticoids, SEGRAMs selectively activate the GR in such a way that they yield an improved therapeutic benefit. Generally, for specific inflammation-based diseases, SEGRAMs should more strongly transrepress than transactivate, or better yet solely transrepress and fail to transactivate. This type of selective GR activation should result in fewer side effects than the expected side effects that appear with a chronic treatment with classic glucocorticoids.<ref name=\"Schaecke\" />\n\n== Clinical trials ==\n\nPhase II clinical trials with one of the candidate compounds, mapracorat (code names BOL-303242-X and ZK&nbsp;245186<ref name=\"Cavet\" />), started in summer 2009.

Systemic long-term treatment of inflammations with corticosteroids is particularly liable to cause metabolic side-effects, which makes the development of oral SEGRAMs an interesting goal.<ref name=\"Schaecke2002\"/> It remains to be seen whether selective receptor agonists or modulators indeed cause significantly less side-effects than classical corticoids in clinical applications.\n\n== Beneficial atrophic effects ==\n\nOf note, the atrophic effects of glucocorticoids are not always a disadvantage. The treatment of hyperproliferative diseases like psoriasis makes use of this property.<ref name=\"Kerscher\"/> SEGRAMs would likely be less effective in such conditions. Recent advances have shown that the former striving towards a total separation of GR transrepression and transactivation by using SEGRAMs deserves to be nuanced as the anti-inflammatory genes stimulated by GR transactivation, such as [[TSC22D3|GILZ]] and [[DUSP1]], do seem to play an important role.<ref name=\"Newton 2014\"/><ref name=\"Ayroldi 2014\"/> Nevertheless, the more selective nature of these SEGRAMs would still reduce the number of GR-mediated side effects, and deserves further clinical testing.\n\n== Chemistry ==\n[[File:RU 24858 skeletal.svg|thumb|RU 24858, a SEGRA with steroid structure<ref name=\"Vayssiere\" />]]\n[[File:Octahydrophenanthrene-2,7-diol SEGRA.svg|thumb|An octahydrophenanthrene-2,7-diol derivative with SEGRA properties<ref name=\"Robinson\" />]]\nEarly SEGRAs were synthetic steroids. An example is RU&nbsp;24858, one of the first compounds of this type to be published.<ref name=\"Vayssiere\" /> Many newer SEGRAs have a different framework, although the similarity to steroids can still be seen in molecules like the benzopyranoquinoline A&nbsp;276575 or in octahydrophenanthrene-2,7-diol derivatives. All of these compounds have been shown to exhibit SEGRA properties in cellular or in animal models.<ref name=\"Robinson\" />\n\nMapracorat is one of a number of trifluoropropanolamines and -amides which are less obviously steroid-like in structure. Other typical examples of this group are ZK&nbsp;216348<ref name=\"ZK 209614\" /> and 55D1E1.<ref name=\"Biggadike\" /> The bulky, bicyclic aromatic substituents (R<sup>1</sup> and R<sup>2</sup>) account for the structural similarity to corticoids. The [[Cahn\u2013Ingold\u2013Prelog priority rules|''R'' conformation]] of the [[asymmetric carbon]] atom seems to be essential for GR affinity.<ref name=\"ZK 209614\" />\n\n[[File:Trifluoroisopropanolamine SEGRA.svg|450px]]\n\n==List of SEGRMs==\n* [[Dagrocorat]] (PF-00251802, PF-251802)\n* [[Fosdagrocorat]] (PF-04171327, PF-4171327)\n* [[Mapracorat]] (BOL-303242-X, ZK-245186)\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Selective glucocorticoid receptor agonists}}\n* [[Selective receptor modulator]]\n* [[Selective androgen receptor modulator]]\n* [[Selective estrogen receptor modulator]]\n* [[Selective progesterone receptor modulator]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|35em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Sundahl P&T 2015\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sundahl N, Bridelance J, Libert C, De Bosscher K, Beck IM | title = Selective glucocorticoid receptor modulation: New directions with non-steroidal scaffolds | journal = Pharmacology & Therapeutics | volume = 152| date = May 2015 | pmid = 25958032 | doi = 10.1016/j.pharmthera.2015.05.001 | pages=28\u201341}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Yemelyanov 2008\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Yemelyanov A, Czwornog J, Gera L, Joshi S, Chatterton RT, Budunova I | title = Novel steroid receptor phyto-modulator compound a inhibits growth and survival of prostate cancer cells | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 68 | issue = 12 | pages = 4763\u201373 | date = Jun 2008 | pmid = 18559523 | doi = 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-6104 | url = http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/68/12/4763.long }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Lesovaya 2011\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lesovaya EA, Yemelyanov AY, Kirsanov KI, Yakubovskaya MG, Budunova IV | title = Antitumor effect of non-steroid glucocorticoid receptor ligand CpdA on leukemia cell lines CEM and K562 | journal = Biochemistry.
