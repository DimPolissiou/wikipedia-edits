The drastic change in vegetation is typically interpreted to be an effect of a sudden decrease in (annual) temperature, unfavorable for the forest vegetation that had been spreading northward rapidly.

After an examination of laminated [[varve]] sequences, Muschitiello and Wohlfarth found that the environmental changes that define the beginning of the Younger Dryas are [[diachronous]] in their time of occurrence according to latitude. According to the changes, the Younger Dryas occurred as early as AROUND 12,900\u201313,100 calendar years ago along latitude 56\u201354\u00b0N. Further north, they found that the changes occurred at roughly 12,600\u201312,750 calendar years ago.<ref name=\"MuschitielloOthers\">Muschitiello, F., and B. Wohlfarth (2015) ''Time-transgressive environmental shifts across Northern Europe at the onset of the Younger Dryas.'' Quaternary Science Reviews. 109:49\u201356.</ref>\n\nAccording to the analyses of varved sediments from [[Lake Suigetsu]], Japan, and other paleoenvironmental records from Asia, a substantial delay occurred in the onset and the end of the Younger Dryas between Asia and the North Atlantic. For example, paleoenvironmental analysis of sediment cores from Lake Suigetsu in Japan found the Younger Dryas temperature decline of 2\u20134\u00b0C between 12,300 and 11,250 varve (calendar) years BP, instead of about 12,900 calendar years BP in the North Atlantic region.\n\nIn contrast, the abrupt shift in the radiocarbon signal from apparent radiocarbon dates of 11,000 radiocarbon years to radiocarbon dates of 10,700\u201310,600 radiocarbon years BP in terrestrial macrofossils and tree rings in Europe over a 50-year period occurred at the same time in the varved sediments of Lake Suigetsu. However, this same shift in the radiocarbon signal antedates the start of Younger Dryas at Lake Suigetsu by a few hundred years. Interpretations of data from Chinese also confirm that the Younger Dryas East Asia lags the North Atlantic Younger Dryas cooling by at least 200 to 300 years. Although\nthe interpretation of the data is more murky and ambiguous, the end of the Younger Dryas and the start of Holocene warming likely were similarly delayed in Japan and in other parts of East Asia.<ref name=\"NakagawaOther2003a\">{{cite journal | last1 = Nakagawa | first1 = T | last2 = Kitagawa | first2 = H. | last3 = Yasuda | first3 = Y. | last4 = Tarasov | first4 = P.E. | last5 = Nishida | first5 = K. | last6 = Gotanda | first6 = K. | last7 = Sawai | first7 = Y. | last8 = Yangtze River | first8 = Civilization Program Members | year = 2003 | title = Asynchronous climate changes in the North Atlantic and Japan during the last termination | url = | journal = Science | volume = 299 | issue = 5607| pages = 688\u2013691 | doi=10.1126/science.1078235| pmid = 12560547 | bibcode = 2003Sci...299..688N }}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, an analysis of a [[stalagmite]] growing from a [[cave]] in [[Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park]], [[Palawan]], the [[Philippines]], found that the onset of the Younger Dryas was also delayed there.

For the early part of the sea level rise that is associated with [[deglaciation]], three major periods of accelerated sea level rise, called ''meltwater pulses'', occurred. They are commonly called ''meltwater pulse 1A0'' for the pulse between 19,000 and 19,500 calendar years ago; ''[[meltwater pulse 1A]]'' for the pulse between 14,600 and 14,300 calendar years ago and ''[[meltwater pulse 1B]]'' for the pulse between 11,400 and 11,100 calendar years ago. The Younger Dryas occurred after meltwater pulse 1A, a 13.5 m rise over about 290 years, centered at about 14,200 calendar years ago, and before meltwater pulse 1B, a 7.5 m rise over about 160 years, centered at about 11,000 calendar years ago.<ref name=\"Blanchon2011a\">Blanchon, P.

First, the plotting of data by Bard and others suggests a small drop, less than 6 m, in sea level near the onset of the Younger Dryas. There is a possible corresponding change in the rate of change of sea level rise seen in the data from both [[Barbados]] and Tahiti. Given that this change is \"within the overall uncertainty of the approach,\" it was concluded that a relatively smooth sea-level rise, with no significant accelerations, occurred then.<ref name=\"BardOthers2010a\"/> Finally, research by Lohe and others in western Norway has reported a sea-level low-stand at 13,640 calendar years ago and a subsequent Younger Dryas transgression starting at 13,080 calendar years ago. They concluded that the timing of the Aller\u00f8d low-stand and the subsequent transgression were the result of increased regional loading of the crust, and geoid changes were caused by an expanding ice sheet, which started growing and advancing in the early Aller\u00f8d about 13,600 calendar years ago, well before the start of the Younger Dryas.<ref name=\" LohneOthers2007a\">{{cite journal | last1 = Lohne | first1 = \u00d8.

Researchers who studied effects of nearby supernovae on earth uncovered suggestive correlating evidence during the Younger Dryas, including depletion of the ozone layer, increased [[Ultraviolet|UV]] exposure, nitrogen changes on the Earth's surface and in the [[troposphere]], evidence of global cooling, changes in [[Carbon-14|<sup>14</sup>C]] and [[Beryllium-10|<sup>10</sup>Be]] in ice cores, a thin layer (about 30 cm) of \u201cblack mats\u201d, and many extinctions that may have been caused by the explosion of the Vela supernova.<ref name=\":6\">Brakenridge, G. Robert. [http://floodobservatory.colorado.edu/Publications/YICAR9886.pdf Core''-Collapse Supernovae and the Younger Dryas/Terminal Rancholabrean Extinctions''.] Elsevier, 2011, Retrieved 23 September 2018</ref>\n\nWhile no cause is determined for the extinction of many species, a combination of some climatic change or being hunted by humans  is suggested as a cause. Most of the species that became extinct were cold-blooded species and [[Rancholabrean]] megafauna, including ''[[Columbian mammoth]]'', ''[[Dire wolf]]'', and ''[[Camelops]]''. Survivors of the Younger Dryas included nocturnal, low-birthrate species residing in the mountainous or forest-like terrains of the Americas, Eurasia, Australia, and Madagascar. The largest, slow-breeding, diurnal species that lived in more open spaces survived in the lower parts of Africa.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nAcross faunal and paleoindian hunting sites, evidence existed of carbon-rich \u201cblack mats\u201d that were around 30 cm in thickness, suggesting an abrupt change that occurred in a small time window and a rise in aquatic conditions. Brakenridge also discusses pollen-core research that suggests global cooling conditions not to have just occurred in the northern latitudes, but also latitudes as far as 41\u00b0S. Tree-ring evidence shows a rise in <sup>14</sup>C cosmogenic isotope. The increase may have also occurred around the same time as the increase of another cosmogenic isotope, <sup>10</sup>Be.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nAnother hypothesis discussed is that effects of a supernova could have been a factor in the Younger Dryas. Effects of a supernova have been suggested before, but without confirming evidence. Potential evidence that these effects could have been caused by a celestial event, a supernova, are observations of [[gamma-ray burst]]s and [[X-ray flash (astronomy)|X-ray flashes]] have been compared to nebular records to test this, as well as supernovae flash models, comparable to the records of in-galaxy supernovae, to study the effects of such an event on Earth. These effects include depletion of the ozone layer, increased UV exposure, global cooling, and nitrogen changes in the Earth's surface and troposphere. As Brakenridge<ref name=\":6\" /> states, the only supernova possible at that time was the Vela supernova, now classified as the Vela supernova remnant. Most geologists regard this hypothesis as an academic exercise by astronomers with little knowledge of earth system science.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brannen |first1=Peter |title=The Ends of the World: Volcanic Apocalypses, Lethal Oceans, and Our Quest to Understand Earth's Past Mass Extinctions |date=2018 |publisher=Ecco |isbn=978-0062364814 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|small=yes}}\n* {{annotated link|1500-year climate cycle}}\n* {{annotated link|8.2 kiloyear event|8.2 kiloyear climate event}}\n* {{annotated link|Heinrich event}}\n*[[Huelmo\u2013Mascardi Cold Reversal]]\n* {{annotated link|Little Ice Age}}\n* {{annotated link|Medieval Warm Period}}\n* {{annotated link|Neoglaciation}}\n* {{annotated link|Older Dryas}}\n* {{annotated link|Oldest Dryas}}\n* {{annotated link|Shutdown of thermohaline circulation}}\n* {{annotated link|Timeline of glaciation}}\n* {{annotated link|Timeline of environmental history}}\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web|url=http://oregonstate.edu/dept/ncs/newsarch/2007/Apr07/currents.html|title=Study Confirms Mechanism for Current Shutdowns, European Cooling|publisher=Oregon State University|year=2007|accessdate=11 April 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217183132/http://oregonstate.edu/dept/ncs/newsarch/2007/Apr07/currents.html|archivedate=17 December 2010}}\n* {{cite journal |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/wcalvin/teaching/Broecker99.html |author=Broecker WS|title=What If the Conveyor Were to Shut Down?|journal=GSA Today|volume=9|pages=1\u20137|year=1999 |accessdate=11 April 2011|issue=1}}\n* {{cite journal |url=http://williamcalvin.com/1990s/1998AtlanticClimate.htm |author=Calvin WH|title=The Great Climate Flip-flop|journal=The Atlantic Monthly|date=January 1998|volume=281|pages=47\u201364|accessdate=11 April 2011}}\n* {{cite journal|vauthors=Tarasov L, Peltier WR |title=Arctic freshwater forcing of the Younger Dryas cold reversal |journal=Nature |volume=435 |issue=7042 |pages=662\u2013665 |date=June 2005 |pmid=15931219 |doi=10.1038/nature03617 |url=http://ic.ucsc.edu/~acr/BeringResources/Articles%20of%20interest/Central%20Artic/Tarasov%20and%20Peltier%202005.pdf |bibcode=2005Natur.435..662T |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821001847/http://ic.ucsc.edu/~acr/BeringResources/Articles%20of%20interest/Central%20Artic/Tarasov%20and%20Peltier%202005.pdf |archivedate=21 August 2015 }}\n* Acosta ''et al''., 2018.

The drastic change in vegetation is typically interpreted to be an effect of a sudden decrease in (annual) temperature, unfavorable for the forest vegetation that had been spreading northward rapidly. The cooling not only favored the expansion of cold-tolerant, light-demanding plants and associated [[steppe]] [[fauna]], but also led to regional glacial advances in Scandinavia and a lowering of the regional [[snow line]].<ref name=\"Bjorck2007a\">[[Svante Bj\u00f6rck|Bj\u00f6rck, S.]] (2007) ''Younger Dryas oscillation, global evidence.''

For example, paleoenvironmental analysis of sediment cores from Lake Suigetsu in Japan found the Younger Dryas temperature decline of 2\u20134\u00b0C between 12,300 and 11,250 varve (calendar) years BP, instead of about 12,900 calendar years BP in the North Atlantic region.\n\nIn contrast, the abrupt shift in the radiocarbon signal from apparent radiocarbon dates of 11,000 radiocarbon years to radiocarbon dates of 10,700\u201310,600 radiocarbon years BP in terrestrial macrofossils and tree rings in Europe over a 50-year period occurred at the same time in the varved sediments of Lake Suigetsu. However, this same shift in the radiocarbon signal antedates the start of Younger Dryas at Lake Suigetsu by a few hundred years. Interpretations of data from Chinese also confirm that the Younger Dryas East Asia lags the North Atlantic Younger Dryas cooling by at least 200 to 300 years.

For the early part of the sea level rise that is associated with [[deglaciation]], three major periods of accelerated sea level rise, called ''meltwater pulses'', occurred. They are commonly called ''meltwater pulse 1A0'' for the pulse between 19,000 and 19,500 calendar years ago; ''[[meltwater pulse 1A]]'' for the pulse between 14,600 and 14,300 calendar years ago and ''[[meltwater pulse 1B]]'' for the pulse between 11,400 and 11,100 calendar years ago. The Younger Dryas occurred after meltwater pulse 1A, a 13.5 m rise over about 290 years, centered at about 14,200 calendar years ago, and before meltwater pulse 1B, a 7.5 m rise over about 160 years, centered at about 11,000 calendar years ago.<ref name=\"Blanchon2011a\">Blanchon, P.

First, the plotting of data by Bard and others suggests a small drop, less than 6 m, in sea level near the onset of the Younger Dryas. There is a possible corresponding change in the rate of change of sea level rise seen in the data from both [[Barbados]] and Tahiti. Given that this change is \"within the overall uncertainty of the approach,\" it was concluded that a relatively smooth sea-level rise, with no significant accelerations, occurred then.<ref name=\"BardOthers2010a\"/> Finally, research by Lohe and others in western Norway has reported a sea-level low-stand at 13,640 calendar years ago and a subsequent Younger Dryas transgression starting at 13,080 calendar years ago.

However, simulations indicated that a one-time-flood could not likely cause the new state to be locked for 1000 years.

Therefore, continuous freshwater input was necessary to maintain a weak AMOC for more than 1000 years.

Researchers who studied effects of nearby supernovae on earth uncovered suggestive correlating evidence during the Younger Dryas, including depletion of the ozone layer, increased [[Ultraviolet|UV]] exposure, nitrogen changes on the Earth's surface and in the [[troposphere]], evidence of global cooling, changes in [[Carbon-14|<sup>14</sup>C]] and [[Beryllium-10|<sup>10</sup>Be]] in ice cores, a thin layer (about 30 cm) of \u201cblack mats\u201d, and many extinctions that may have been caused by the explosion of the Vela supernova.<ref name=\":6\">Brakenridge, G. Robert. [http://floodobservatory.colorado.edu/Publications/YICAR9886.pdf Core''-Collapse Supernovae and the Younger Dryas/Terminal Rancholabrean Extinctions''.] Elsevier, 2011, Retrieved 23 September 2018</ref>\n\nWhile no cause is determined for the extinction of many species, a combination of some climatic change or being hunted by humans  is suggested as a cause. Most of the species that became extinct were cold-blooded species and [[Rancholabrean]] megafauna, including ''[[Columbian mammoth]]'', ''[[Dire wolf]]'', and ''[[Camelops]]''. Survivors of the Younger Dryas included nocturnal, low-birthrate species residing in the mountainous or forest-like terrains of the Americas, Eurasia, Australia, and Madagascar. The largest, slow-breeding, diurnal species that lived in more open spaces survived in the lower parts of Africa.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nAcross faunal and paleoindian hunting sites, evidence existed of carbon-rich \u201cblack mats\u201d that were around 30 cm in thickness, suggesting an abrupt change that occurred in a small time window and a rise in aquatic conditions. Brakenridge also discusses pollen-core research that suggests global cooling conditions not to have just occurred in the northern latitudes, but also latitudes as far as 41\u00b0S. Tree-ring evidence shows a rise in <sup>14</sup>C cosmogenic isotope. The increase may have also occurred around the same time as the increase of another cosmogenic isotope, <sup>10</sup>Be.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nAnother hypothesis discussed is that effects of a supernova could have been a factor in the Younger Dryas. Effects of a supernova have been suggested before, but without confirming evidence. Potential evidence that these effects could have been caused by a celestial event, a supernova, are observations of [[gamma-ray burst]]s and [[X-ray flash (astronomy)|X-ray flashes]] have been compared to nebular records to test this, as well as supernovae flash models, comparable to the records of in-galaxy supernovae, to study the effects of such an event on Earth. These effects include depletion of the ozone layer, increased UV exposure, global cooling, and nitrogen changes in the Earth's surface and troposphere. As Brakenridge<ref name=\":6\" /> states, the only supernova possible at that time was the Vela supernova, now classified as the Vela supernova remnant. Most geologists regard this hypothesis as an academic exercise by astronomers with little knowledge of earth system science.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brannen |first1=Peter |title=The Ends of the World: Volcanic Apocalypses, Lethal Oceans, and Our Quest to Understand Earth's Past Mass Extinctions |date=2018 |publisher=Ecco |isbn=978-0062364814 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|small=yes}}\n* {{annotated link|1500-year climate cycle}}\n* {{annotated link|8.2 kiloyear event|8.2 kiloyear climate event}}\n* {{annotated link|Heinrich event}}\n*[[Huelmo\u2013Mascardi Cold Reversal]]\n* {{annotated link|Little Ice Age}}\n* {{annotated link|Medieval Warm Period}}\n* {{annotated link|Neoglaciation}}\n* {{annotated link|Older Dryas}}\n* {{annotated link|Oldest Dryas}}\n* {{annotated link|Shutdown of thermohaline circulation}}\n* {{annotated link|Timeline of glaciation}}\n* {{annotated link|Timeline of environmental history}}\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web|url=http://oregonstate.edu/dept/ncs/newsarch/2007/Apr07/currents.html|title=Study Confirms Mechanism for Current Shutdowns, European Cooling|publisher=Oregon State University|year=2007|accessdate=11 April 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217183132/http://oregonstate.edu/dept/ncs/newsarch/2007/Apr07/currents.html|archivedate=17 December 2010}}\n* {{cite journal |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/wcalvin/teaching/Broecker99.html |author=Broecker WS|title=What If the Conveyor Were to Shut Down?|journal=GSA Today|volume=9|pages=1\u20137|year=1999 |accessdate=11 April 2011|issue=1}}\n* {{cite journal |url=http://williamcalvin.com/1990s/1998AtlanticClimate.htm |author=Calvin WH|title=The Great Climate Flip-flop|journal=The Atlantic Monthly|date=January 1998|volume=281|pages=47\u201364|accessdate=11 April 2011}}\n* {{cite journal|vauthors=Tarasov L, Peltier WR |title=Arctic freshwater forcing of the Younger Dryas cold reversal |journal=Nature |volume=435 |issue=7042 |pages=662\u2013665 |date=June 2005 |pmid=15931219 |doi=10.1038/nature03617 |url=http://ic.ucsc.edu/~acr/BeringResources/Articles%20of%20interest/Central%20Artic/Tarasov%20and%20Peltier%202005.pdf |bibcode=2005Natur.435..662T |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821001847/http://ic.ucsc.edu/~acr/BeringResources/Articles%20of%20interest/Central%20Artic/Tarasov%20and%20Peltier%202005.pdf |archivedate=21 August 2015 }}\n* Acosta ''et al''., 2018.

The back cover of the \"clean cover\" also contains the text: <blockquote>Hitler's syphilis-ridden dreams almost came true. How could it happen? By taking control of the media. An entire country was led by a lunatic\u2026 We must protect our First Amendment, before sick dreams become law. Nobody made fun of Hitler??!</blockquote> The \"clean cover\" was created so the CD could be distributed in stores which refused to stock items with represented nudity.\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/ritual-de-lo-habitual-mw0000314645 |title=Ritual de lo Habitual \u2013 Jane's Addiction |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=November 11, 2015 |last=Prato |first=Greg}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''\n| rev2Score = {{Rating|3|4}}<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-09-13/features/9003160876_1_star-ritual-perry-farrell |title=Jane's Addiction: Ritual De Lo Habitual (Warner) |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=September 13, 1990 |accessdate=February 23, 2013 |last=Kot |first=Greg |authorlink=Greg Kot}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n| rev3Score = A\u2212<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ew.com/article/1990/09/07/ritual-de-lo-habitual |title=Ritual De Lo Habitual |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=September 7, 2000 |accessdate=February 23, 2013 |last=Sandow |first=Greg |authorlink=Greg Sandow}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''\n| rev4Score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-09-02/entertainment/ca-1646_1_jane-s-addiction-rock-n-roll-ritual |title=Jane's Addiction 'Ritual de lo Habitual' Warner Bros. |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 2, 1990 |accessdate=September 3, 2011 |last=Gold |first=Jonathan}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[NME]]''\n| rev5Score = 9/10<ref>{{cite journal |title=Jane's Addiction: Ritual de lo Habitual |work=[[NME]] |date=1 September 1990 |last=Hobbs |first=Mary Anne |authorlink=Mary Anne Hobbs}}</ref>\n| rev6 = ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''\n| rev6Score = {{Rating|4|4}}<ref>{{cite news |title=Jane's Addiction: Ritual de lo Habitual (Warner Bros.) |work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=September 23, 1990 |last=Moon |first=Tom}}</ref>\n| rev7 = ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''\n| rev7Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |title=Jane's Addiction: Ritual de lo Habitual |work=[[Q (magazine)|Q]] |issue=49 |date=October 1990 |last=Kane |first=Peter}}</ref>\n| rev8 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev8score = {{Rating|2|5}}<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/ritual-de-lo-habitual-19901018 |title=Ritual De Lo Habitual |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=October 18, 1990 |accessdate=September 3, 2011 |last=Davis |first=Erik}}</ref>\n| rev9 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n| rev9Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Jane's Addiction |last=Hochman |first=Steve |title=[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]] |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |edition=4th |year=2004 |editor1-last=Brackett |editor1-first=Nathan |editor2-last=Hoard |editor2-first=Christian |isbn=0-7432-0169-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/421 421\u201322] }}</ref>\n| rev10 = ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]''\n| rev10Score = 5/5<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |title=Jane's Addiction: Ritual de lo Habitual |work=[[Select (magazine)|Select]] |issue=58 |date=April 1995 |last=Perry |first=Andrew |page=104}}</ref>\n}}\n\"The gigantic swerve and swagger of 'Stop', the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers|Chili Pepperish]] taunts of 'Ain't No Right', 'Of Course'{{'}}s [[raga]] rocking and, above all, the epic 'Three Days', where guitarist David Navarro gets to pile the layers shoulder high, prove to be the stuff of true compulsion,\" wrote Peter Kane in ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''. \"Enigmatic, audacious and unpredictable to the last.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n\"It all makes you realise how few bands actually bother to try and be any good, to play stuff that's inspirational,\" enthused Andrew Perry in a retrospective review for ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]''.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The same magazine later listed ''Ritual'' as the fifth best album of the '90s: \"''[[Nevermind]]'' would never have been possible without it.
