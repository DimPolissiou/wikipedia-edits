Fu\u00dfball-Club K\u00f6ln 01/07 e. V.''', commonly known as simply '''1. FC K\u00f6ln''' or '''FC Cologne''' in English ({{IPA-de|\u0294\u025bf \u02c8tse\u02d0 \u02c8k\u0153ln}}), is a [[Football in Germany|German association football club]] based in [[Cologne]]. It was formed in 1948 as a merger of the clubs ''K\u00f6lner Ballspiel-Club 1901'' and ''SpVgg S\u00fclz 07''. K\u00f6ln gained promotion back to the [[Bundesliga]] in the [[2018-19 2. Bundesliga|2018\u201319 season]] after being relegated to [[2. Bundesliga]] [[2017-18 Bundesliga|the previous season]]. The team won the first Bundesliga in 1963.\n\nThe club's nickname ''Die Gei\u00dfb\u00f6cke'' (The [[Goat|Billy Goats]]) refers to the club's [[mascot]], a male goat named ''Hennes'' after the veteran FC player and (later) manager [[Hennes Weisweiler]]. The first ''Hennes'' was donated by a circus entrepreneur as a [[Cologne carnival]] joke. The current mascot is ''Hennes'' IX as of 1 August 2019 after Hennes VIII was retired by the club due to old age.<ref>https://fc.de/en/fc-info/news/detailpage/details/fc-present-hennes-ix/</ref> Another nickname for the club, more common locally due to its ambiguity, is ''FC'' (often written as ''Effzeh''), a common German abbreviation for football clubs. Characteristic for the [[Colognian language|dialect spoken around Cologne]], this is pronounced \"EF-tsay\",{{fix|text=Colognian IPA needed|date=October 2015}} in contrast to the Standard German pronunciation of the abbreviation where the second syllable is emphasized ({{IPA-de|\u0294\u025bf \u02c8tse\u02d0|}}). K\u00f6ln play at home in white and red, both colours having been used as the main shirt colour throughout its history.\n\nLike many of Germany's other professional football clubs, 1. FC K\u00f6ln is part of a larger sports club with teams in other sports like [[handball]], [[table tennis]] and [[gymnastics]]. 1. FC K\u00f6ln has over 100,000 members, making it the fourth largest club in Germany.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.express.de/sport/fussball/1--fc-koeln/mitglieder-boom-dank-europa-fc-knackt-bald-die-100-000--27800598 | title = Mitglieder-Boom dank Europa FC knackt bald die 100.000! | language = de | trans-title=Member's boom thanks to Europa League FC will soon break the 100,000! | publisher = express.de | date = 16 June 2017 | accessdate = 12 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://fc.de/en/fc-info/news/detailpage/details/record-setting-members-meeting | title = Record-Setting Members' Meeting | publisher = fc.de | date = 26 September 2017 | accessdate = 27 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Predecessor sides===\n[[File:Kolner BC.png|thumb|left|250px|Historical logos of predecessor side ''K\u00f6lner BC'']]K\u00f6lner BC was formed on 6 June 1901 by a group of young men who were unhappy as part of the [[gymnastics]] club FC Borussia K\u00f6ln and far more interested in football. BC was a competitive side in the Zehnerliga West in the years before [[World War I]] who took the [[Western German football championship|Westdeutsche championship]] in 1912 and advanced to the preliminary rounds of the [[1912 German football championship|national finals]]. Their next best result was a losing appearance in the 1920 league final, where they lost a 1\u20133 to [[Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach]].\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SpVgg Sulz.png|thumb|right|100px|Historical logo of predecessor side ''SpVgg S\u00fclz'']] -->\nSpielvereinigung 1907 K\u00f6ln-S\u00fclz was established in 1907 as S\u00fclzer Sportverein and on 1 January 1919 merged with Fu\u00dfball Club 1908 Hertha S\u00fclz to form SpVgg. They won the Westdeutscher title in 1928 and they too went out in the early rounds of the [[1928 German football championship|national finals]] in their turn on that stage. They went on to play as a top flight club in the [[Gauliga Mittelrhein]], one of sixteen premier level divisions established in 1933 in the re-organization of German football under the [[Third Reich]]. The side earned generally good results through the 1930s&nbsp;\u2013 including a divisional championship in 1939&nbsp;\u2013 but then faltered in the early 1940s. After the 1941 season the Gauliga Mittlerhein was split into two new divisions: the [[Gauliga K\u00f6ln-Aachen]] and the [[Gauliga Moselland]], which included clubs from occupied Luxembourg. S\u00fclz struggled until they were united with [[VfL K\u00f6ln 1899]] for the 1943\u201344 season to form the combined wartime side Kriegspielgemeinschaft VfL 99/S\u00fclz 07 which promptly won the Gauliga K\u00f6ln-Aachen title by a single point over SG D\u00fcren 99 in a close race. The club did not play the next campaign as war overtook the region.\n\n===A successful new club===\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\n[[File:FC K\u00f6ln Performance Chart.png|260px|thumb|Historical chart of 1. FC K\u00f6ln league performance]]\nAfter the union of these two predecessor sides (1948), 1. FC K\u00f6ln began play in the tough [[Oberliga West (1947\u201363)|Oberliga West]] in the 1949\u201350 season and by 1954 had won their first divisional championship. That same year they lost the [[1953\u201354 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]] final 1\u20130 to [[VfB Stuttgart]]. ''Die Gei\u00dfb\u00f6cke'' won their second divisional championship in 1960 and appeared in the [[1960 German football championship|national final]] against [[Hamburger SV]], where they went down to a 2\u20133 defeat. They went on to finish first in the Oberliga West in each of the next three seasons and again played their way to the national final in [[1962 German football championship|1962]] and [[1963 German football championship|1963]]. They won the '62 match 4\u20130 over [[1. FC N\u00fcrnberg]] resulting in entry to the [[1962\u201363 European Cup]] where they were one of the favourites to win the trophy. In the first round K\u00f6ln visited [[Dundee F.C.]] of Scotland and lost 1\u20138, and despite winning the second leg back in Germany by 4\u20130 they were out of the tournament. In the following year's national final they lost 1\u20133 to [[Borussia Dortmund]].\n\n===Continuing success===\n[[File:Einweihung Carola-Williams-Park 05.jpg|thumb|Mascot Hennes VIII]]\nIn 1963, FC K\u00f6ln was selected as one of the original 16 teams to play in the [[Bundesliga]], Germany's new professional football league. K\u00f6ln continued their winning ways by becoming the first ever [[List of German football champions|Bundesliga champion]] in the league's inaugural [[1963\u201364 Bundesliga|1963\u201364 season]]. As German champions, K\u00f6ln entered the [[1964\u201365 European Cup]] where it met England's [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at the quarter-final stage. After two 0\u20130 draws, a third game was played which was also a stalemate, this time 2\u20132. As the [[kicks from the penalty mark|penalty shootout]] had not yet been introduced as the means of deciding a tie, K\u00f6ln went out of the competition on the [[Coin toss|toss of a coin]]. Ironically enough, there was the need for a second coin toss because the first time the coin stuck vertically in the ground. The club also became the first Bundesliga side to field a Brazilian player when it signed [[Z\u00e9z\u00e9]] for a then club record fee of [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] 150,000.<ref name=\"Schnee\" >[http://www.weltfussball.de/news/_n1498951_/schnee-allergie-beim-samba-kicker/ Schnee-Allergie beim Samba-Kicker] {{in lang|de}} Weltfussball.de, published: 27 March 2015. Retrieved 28 March 2015.</ref> Domestically, K\u00f6ln recorded a second-place finish in the [[1964\u201365 Bundesliga]] season and won its first [[DFB-Pokal]] in [[1967\u201368 DFB-Pokal|1967\u201368]].\n\nAt the start of the 1970s, K\u00f6ln reached three DFB-Pokal finals in four seasons, losing all three; to [[Kickers Offenbach]] in [[1969\u201370 DFB-Pokal|1970]], [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] in [[1970\u201371 DFB-Pokal|1971]] and [[Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach]] in [[1972\u201373 DFB-Pokal|1973]]. The team also achieved another second place Bundesliga finish in [[1972\u201373 Bundesliga|1973]] before reaching another DFB-Pokal final in [[1976\u201377 DFB-Pokal|1977]], beating [[Hertha BSC]] over two legs to win the trophy for the second time.\n\nIn 1977\u201378, FC K\u00f6ln enjoyed its most successful season, winning the [[1977\u201378 Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] title, its third national title overall, and retaining the [[1977\u201378 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]]. This makes K\u00f6ln one of only four clubs to have won [[Double (association football)#Germany|the double]] in [[Double (association football)#Bundesliga era|the Bundesliga era]].\n\nK\u00f6ln had another losing DFB-Pokal final appearance in [[1979\u201380 DFB-Pokal|1980]], before winning the competition for a fourth time in [[1982\u201383 DFB-Pokal|1983]]. In 1986, the club appeared in its first European final, losing 5\u20133 on aggregate to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in the [[1986 UEFA Cup Final|UEFA Cup Final]]. Two second place Bundesliga finishes, in [[1988\u201389 Bundesliga|1988\u201389]] and [[1989\u201390 Bundesliga|1989\u201390]], and another DFB-Pokal final loss in [[1990\u201391 DFB-Pokal|1991]], marked the end of a glorious thirty-year period for FC K\u00f6ln.\n\n===21st century: ups and downs===\nIn recent years, the club's performance has been mixed. The FC holds the dubious distinction of the worst goal drought in Bundesliga history: in [[2001\u201302 Bundesliga|2002]], the supporters had to wait 1034 excruciating minutes (equivalent to 11-and-a-half games) until [[Thomas Cichon]] found the back of the net again.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fussballdaten.de/bundesliga/2002/25/fckoeln-herthabsc/ | title = Das ersehnte Tor war zuwenig | language = de | publisher = fussballdaten.de | date = 2 March 2002 | accessdate = 10 December 2014}}</ref>\nIn the early years of the Bundesliga, 1. FC K\u00f6ln was the most successful club in West Germany in terms of total points won. Beginning in the early 1990s, however, the club's performance fell, and in [[1997\u201398 Bundesliga|1998]] it was relegated for the first time. Since about 2000, the side has been a \"[[yo-yo club|yo-yo team]]\", moving between the first and second divisions. It has returned to the Bundesliga at the end of the [[2004\u201305 2. Bundesliga|2004\u201305 season]] as [[2. Bundesliga]] champions after having been relegated the [[2003\u201304 Bundesliga|season before]]. There was little optimism about their return to the top flight as they were picked by German football magazine ''kicker'' as one of the clubs most likely to be relegated.\n\nThis prediction came true when K\u00f6ln lost to [[Hamburger SV]] 1\u20130 in the third-to-last match of [[2005\u201306 Bundesliga|the season]]. The club finished the season in second-last place and was relegated after conceding a league-worst 71 goals. The team's most prolific goal scorer was [[Lukas Podolski]] with a total of 12 goals, who transferred to Bayern Munich after the end of the season. He also appeared with the [[Germany national football team|Germany national team]] at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]].\n\nIn late 2006, former coach [[Christoph Daum]] was convinced to once again take the helm of the 2. Bundesliga club and succeeded in leading the club back to the Bundesliga in 2008. After a successful Bundesliga campaign in 2008\u201309, Daum left K\u00f6ln for his former club [[Fenerbah\u00e7e S.K. (football)|Fenerbah\u00e7e]]. K\u00f6ln's former star-striker Lukas Podolski returned for the [[2009\u201310 Bundesliga|2009\u201310 season]].\n\nAfter a poor run of form in the [[2010\u201311 Bundesliga|2010\u201311 season]], recording only one win from its opening nine Bundesliga fixtures, K\u00f6ln replaced coach [[Zvonimir Soldo]] with [[Frank Schaefer]]. Schaefer, who was originally in charge of the under-23 team of K\u00f6ln, decided after the season that he would rather spend more time with his family than be a coach in the Bundesliga. Former [[Norway national football team|Norwegian international]] and recent [[F.C. Copenhagen|Copenhagen]] coach [[St\u00e5le Solbakken]] replaced him. After earning just eight points in the first 13 matches of the second half of the season, Schaefer and former K\u00f6ln player [[Dirk Lottner]] replaced Solbakken.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/1956/europe/2011/05/14/2486732/koln-confirm-stale-solbakken-as-new-coach-for-next-season/ |title=K\u00f6ln confirm Stale Solbakken as new coach for next season |date=14 May 2011 |accessdate=15 May 2011 |publisher=goal.com}}</ref> The club, however, was relegated at the end of the season, finishing in 17th place, having accumulated \u20ac33m debt, and \u20ac11m [[equity (finance)|negative equity]].<ref name=dept2017>[http://www.express.de/sport/fussball/1--fc-koeln/1--fc-koeln-wehrle-schafft-das-finanz-wunder--hier-die-mega-zahlen-26913860 1.

Fu\u00dfball-Club K\u00f6ln 01/07 e. V.''', commonly known as simply '''1. FC K\u00f6ln''' or '''FC Cologne''' in English ({{IPA-de|\u0294\u025bf \u02c8tse\u02d0 \u02c8k\u0153ln}}), is a [[Football in Germany|German association football club]] based in [[Cologne]]. It was formed in 1948 as a merger of the clubs ''K\u00f6lner Ballspiel-Club 1901'' and ''SpVgg S\u00fclz 07''. K\u00f6ln gained promotion back to the [[Bundesliga]] in the [[2018-19 2. Bundesliga|2018\u201319 season]] after being relegated to [[2. Bundesliga]] [[2017-18 Bundesliga|the previous season]]. The team won the first Bundesliga in 1963.\n\nThe club's nickname ''Die Gei\u00dfb\u00f6cke'' (The [[Goat|Billy Goats]]) refers to the club's [[mascot]], a male goat named ''Hennes'' after the veteran FC player and (later) manager [[Hennes Weisweiler]]. The first ''Hennes'' was donated by a circus entrepreneur as a [[Cologne carnival]] joke. The current mascot is ''Hennes'' IX as of 1 August 2019 after Hennes VIII was retired by the club due to old age.<ref>https://fc.de/en/fc-info/news/detailpage/details/fc-present-hennes-ix/</ref> Another nickname for the club, more common locally due to its ambiguity, is ''FC'' (often written as ''Effzeh''), a common German abbreviation for football clubs. Characteristic for the [[Colognian language|dialect spoken around Cologne]], this is pronounced \"EF-tsay\",{{fix|text=Colognian IPA needed|date=October 2015}} in contrast to the Standard German pronunciation of the abbreviation where the second syllable is emphasized ({{IPA-de|\u0294\u025bf \u02c8tse\u02d0|}}). K\u00f6ln play at home in white and red, both colours having been used as the main shirt colour throughout its history.\n\nLike many of Germany's other professional football clubs, 1. FC K\u00f6ln is part of a larger sports club with teams in other sports like [[handball]], [[table tennis]] and [[gymnastics]]. 1. FC K\u00f6ln has over 100,000 members, making it the fourth largest club in Germany.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.express.de/sport/fussball/1--fc-koeln/mitglieder-boom-dank-europa-fc-knackt-bald-die-100-000--27800598 | title = Mitglieder-Boom dank Europa FC knackt bald die 100.000! | language = de | trans-title=Member's boom thanks to Europa League FC will soon break the 100,000! | publisher = express.de | date = 16 June 2017 | accessdate = 12 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://fc.de/en/fc-info/news/detailpage/details/record-setting-members-meeting | title = Record-Setting Members' Meeting | publisher = fc.de | date = 26 September 2017 | accessdate = 27 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Predecessor sides===\n[[File:Kolner BC.png|thumb|left|250px|Historical logos of predecessor side ''K\u00f6lner BC'']]K\u00f6lner BC was formed on 6 June 1901 by a group of young men who were unhappy as part of the [[gymnastics]] club FC Borussia K\u00f6ln and far more interested in football. BC was a competitive side in the Zehnerliga West in the years before [[World War I]] who took the [[Western German football championship|Westdeutsche championship]] in 1912 and advanced to the preliminary rounds of the [[1912 German football championship|national finals]]. Their next best result was a losing appearance in the 1920 league final, where they lost a 1\u20133 to [[Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach]].\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SpVgg Sulz.png|thumb|right|100px|Historical logo of predecessor side ''SpVgg S\u00fclz'']] -->\nSpielvereinigung 1907 K\u00f6ln-S\u00fclz was established in 1907 as S\u00fclzer Sportverein and on 1 January 1919 merged with Fu\u00dfball Club 1908 Hertha S\u00fclz to form SpVgg. They won the Westdeutscher title in 1928 and they too went out in the early rounds of the [[1928 German football championship|national finals]] in their turn on that stage. They went on to play as a top flight club in the [[Gauliga Mittelrhein]], one of sixteen premier level divisions established in 1933 in the re-organization of German football under the [[Third Reich]]. The side earned generally good results through the 1930s&nbsp;\u2013 including a divisional championship in 1939&nbsp;\u2013 but then faltered in the early 1940s. After the 1941 season the Gauliga Mittlerhein was split into two new divisions: the [[Gauliga K\u00f6ln-Aachen]] and the [[Gauliga Moselland]], which included clubs from occupied Luxembourg. S\u00fclz struggled until they were united with [[VfL K\u00f6ln 1899]] for the 1943\u201344 season to form the combined wartime side Kriegspielgemeinschaft VfL 99/S\u00fclz 07 which promptly won the Gauliga K\u00f6ln-Aachen title by a single point over SG D\u00fcren 99 in a close race. The club did not play the next campaign as war overtook the region.\n\n===A successful new club===\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\n[[File:FC K\u00f6ln Performance Chart.png|260px|thumb|Historical chart of 1. FC K\u00f6ln league performance]]\nAfter the union of these two predecessor sides (1948), 1. FC K\u00f6ln began play in the tough [[Oberliga West (1947\u201363)|Oberliga West]] in the 1949\u201350 season and by 1954 had won their first divisional championship. That same year they lost the [[1953\u201354 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]] final 1\u20130 to [[VfB Stuttgart]]. ''Die Gei\u00dfb\u00f6cke'' won their second divisional championship in 1960 and appeared in the [[1960 German football championship|national final]] against [[Hamburger SV]], where they went down to a 2\u20133 defeat. They went on to finish first in the Oberliga West in each of the next three seasons and again played their way to the national final in [[1962 German football championship|1962]] and [[1963 German football championship|1963]]. They won the '62 match 4\u20130 over [[1. FC N\u00fcrnberg]] resulting in entry to the [[1962\u201363 European Cup]] where they were one of the favourites to win the trophy. In the first round K\u00f6ln visited [[Dundee F.C.]] of Scotland and lost 1\u20138, and despite winning the second leg back in Germany by 4\u20130 they were out of the tournament. In the following year's national final they lost 1\u20133 to [[Borussia Dortmund]].\n\n===Continuing success===\n[[File:Einweihung Carola-Williams-Park 05.jpg|thumb|Mascot Hennes VIII]]\nIn 1963, FC K\u00f6ln was selected as one of the original 16 teams to play in the [[Bundesliga]], Germany's new professional football league. K\u00f6ln continued their winning ways by becoming the first ever [[List of German football champions|Bundesliga champion]] in the league's inaugural [[1963\u201364 Bundesliga|1963\u201364 season]]. As German champions, K\u00f6ln entered the [[1964\u201365 European Cup]] where it met England's [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at the quarter-final stage. After two 0\u20130 draws, a third game was played which was also a stalemate, this time 2\u20132. As the [[kicks from the penalty mark|penalty shootout]] had not yet been introduced as the means of deciding a tie, K\u00f6ln went out of the competition on the [[Coin toss|toss of a coin]]. Ironically enough, there was the need for a second coin toss because the first time the coin stuck vertically in the ground.

The team also achieved another second place Bundesliga finish in [[1972\u201373 Bundesliga|1973]] before reaching another DFB-Pokal final in [[1976\u201377 DFB-Pokal|1977]], beating [[Hertha BSC]] over two legs to win the trophy for the second time.\n\nIn 1977\u201378, FC K\u00f6ln enjoyed its most successful season, winning the [[1977\u201378 Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] title, its third national title overall, and retaining the [[1977\u201378 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]]. This makes K\u00f6ln one of only four clubs to have won [[Double (association football)#Germany|the double]] in [[Double (association football)#Bundesliga era|the Bundesliga era]].\n\nK\u00f6ln had another losing DFB-Pokal final appearance in [[1979\u201380 DFB-Pokal|1980]], before winning the competition for a fourth time in [[1982\u201383 DFB-Pokal|1983]]. In 1986, the club appeared in its first European final, losing 5\u20133 on aggregate to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in the [[1986 UEFA Cup Final|UEFA Cup Final]]. Two second place Bundesliga finishes, in [[1988\u201389 Bundesliga|1988\u201389]] and [[1989\u201390 Bundesliga|1989\u201390]], and another DFB-Pokal final loss in [[1990\u201391 DFB-Pokal|1991]], marked the end of a glorious thirty-year period for FC K\u00f6ln.\n\n===21st century: ups and downs===\nIn recent years, the club's performance has been mixed. The FC holds the dubious distinction of the worst goal drought in Bundesliga history: in [[2001\u201302 Bundesliga|2002]], the supporters had to wait 1034 excruciating minutes (equivalent to 11-and-a-half games) until [[Thomas Cichon]] found the back of the net again.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fussballdaten.de/bundesliga/2002/25/fckoeln-herthabsc/ | title = Das ersehnte Tor war zuwenig | language = de | publisher = fussballdaten.de | date = 2 March 2002 | accessdate = 10 December 2014}}</ref>\nIn the early years of the Bundesliga, 1. FC K\u00f6ln was the most successful club in West Germany in terms of total points won. Beginning in the early 1990s, however, the club's performance fell, and in [[1997\u201398 Bundesliga|1998]] it was relegated for the first time. Since about 2000, the side has been a \"[[yo-yo club|yo-yo team]]\", moving between the first and second divisions. It has returned to the Bundesliga at the end of the [[2004\u201305 2. Bundesliga|2004\u201305 season]] as [[2. Bundesliga]] champions after having been relegated the [[2003\u201304 Bundesliga|season before]]. There was little optimism about their return to the top flight as they were picked by German football magazine ''kicker'' as one of the clubs most likely to be relegated.\n\nThis prediction came true when K\u00f6ln lost to [[Hamburger SV]] 1\u20130 in the third-to-last match of [[2005\u201306 Bundesliga|the season]]. The club finished the season in second-last place and was relegated after conceding a league-worst 71 goals. The team's most prolific goal scorer was [[Lukas Podolski]] with a total of 12 goals, who transferred to Bayern Munich after the end of the season. He also appeared with the [[Germany national football team|Germany national team]] at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]].\n\nIn late 2006, former coach [[Christoph Daum]] was convinced to once again take the helm of the 2. Bundesliga club and succeeded in leading the club back to the Bundesliga in 2008. After a successful Bundesliga campaign in 2008\u201309, Daum left K\u00f6ln for his former club [[Fenerbah\u00e7e S.K. (football)|Fenerbah\u00e7e]]. K\u00f6ln's former star-striker Lukas Podolski returned for the [[2009\u201310 Bundesliga|2009\u201310 season]].\n\nAfter a poor run of form in the [[2010\u201311 Bundesliga|2010\u201311 season]], recording only one win from its opening nine Bundesliga fixtures, K\u00f6ln replaced coach [[Zvonimir Soldo]] with [[Frank Schaefer]]. Schaefer, who was originally in charge of the under-23 team of K\u00f6ln, decided after the season that he would rather spend more time with his family than be a coach in the Bundesliga. Former [[Norway national football team|Norwegian international]] and recent [[F.C. Copenhagen|Copenhagen]] coach [[St\u00e5le Solbakken]] replaced him. After earning just eight points in the first 13 matches of the second half of the season, Schaefer and former K\u00f6ln player [[Dirk Lottner]] replaced Solbakken.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/1956/europe/2011/05/14/2486732/koln-confirm-stale-solbakken-as-new-coach-for-next-season/ |title=K\u00f6ln confirm Stale Solbakken as new coach for next season |date=14 May 2011 |accessdate=15 May 2011 |publisher=goal.com}}</ref> The club, however, was relegated at the end of the season, finishing in 17th place, having accumulated \u20ac33m debt, and \u20ac11m [[equity (finance)|negative equity]].<ref name=dept2017>[http://www.express.de/sport/fussball/1--fc-koeln/1--fc-koeln-wehrle-schafft-das-finanz-wunder--hier-die-mega-zahlen-26913860 1.

Of the track, Nettles said \"it has been so long since I started writing this song, but I was only able to finish it in the last year. I was inspired by the political tensions in our country right now. I want to humanize the immigrant story as an American story, and allow people a different narrative from what they might, or might not, be seeing on the news or in their communities\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/JenniferNettles?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor|title=Jennifer Nettles (@JenniferNettles) |publisher=[[Twitter]]|accessdate=January 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Acting==\nNettles made her acting debut in the [[NBC]] television movie, ''[[Dolly Parton's Coat of Many Colors]]'' portraying [[Dolly Parton]]'s mother.

Against her mother's wishes, she accepts the aid of an intruder to take her out into the world which she has never seen.\n\nBefore the film's release, its title was changed from ''Rapunzel'' to ''Tangled'', reportedly to market the film gender-neutrally.<ref name=\"LATimes\" /> ''Tangled'' spent six years in production at a cost that has been estimated at $260 million, which, if accurate, would make it the [[Most expensive animated films|most expensive animated film ever made]] and [[List of most expensive films|one of the most expensive films]] of all time. The film employed a unique artistic style by blending together features of [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) and [[traditional animation]] while using [[non-photorealistic rendering]] to create the impression of a painting. Composer [[Alan Menken]], who had worked on prior Disney animated features, returned to score ''Tangled''.\n\n''Tangled'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] on November 14, 2010, and went into general release on November 24. The film earned $592 million in worldwide box office revenue,<ref name=mojo /> $200 million of which was earned in the United States and Canada. The film was nominated for a number of awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] at the [[83rd Academy Awards]]. The film was released on [[Blu-ray]] and DVD on March 29, 2011; a short film, ''[[Tangled Ever After]]'', was released later in 2012 and a [[Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure|television series]] premiered in 2017.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please do not expand the plot summary any further. Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words. The current length is 700 words.-->\nLong ago, a drop of sunlight fell onto Earth and grew a magical flower capable of healing illness, decay, and injury. For hundreds of years, the flower is used by a woman named [[Mother Gothel]] to retain her youth, until soldiers from a nearby kingdom find the flower and use it to heal their ailing and pregnant queen. Shortly afterward, the Queen gives birth to a shockingly blonde [[Rapunzel (Tangled)|Princess Rapunzel]]. While attempting to recover the flower, Gothel discovers that Rapunzel's golden hair contains the flower's healing properties. She tries to steal Rapunzel's hair but discovers that cutting her hair destroys its power. Gothel instead abducts the baby and raises Rapunzel as her own daughter in an isolated tower. In order to keep Rapunzel content in the tower, Gothel lied about the outside world being dangerous and filled with bad people who will hurt her and take advantage of her magical capabilities. Gothel often left their tower to find gifts for Rapunzel, leaving the girl alone most of the time. Once a year, the King and Queen release [[sky lantern]]s on Rapunzel's birthday, hoping for their daughter to see them and return.\n\nOn the eve of her 18th birthday, Rapunzel, who sees the lanterns each year on her birthday, asks to leave the tower and discover their source. Gothel refuses, claiming that the outside world is a dangerous place. Meanwhile, a thief named [[Flynn Rider]] takes the crown from the palace before ditching the Stabbington brothers, his comrades, while running from the palace guards. He finds Rapunzel\u2019s tower but is knocked out by a frying pan and hidden in the closet by Rapunzel. Gothel returns, and Rapunzel tries to explain to her how she can handle herself in the \u201cdangerous\u201d outside world because she incapacitated Flynn, but Gothel tells Rapunzel that she\u2019s not leaving the tower, ever. Rapunzel sends Gothel away to buy her paints and hides the crown, and convinces a reluctant Flynn to take her to see the flying lanterns for her birthday. She promises that she\u2019ll give him the crown if he obliges. Eager to reclaim the crown, Flynn takes Rapunzel to the Snuggly Duckling, a [[pub]] filled with menacing thugs, in an effort to discourage her into returning home, but instead, the thugs are charmed by Rapunzel when she encourages them to follow their dreams. Meanwhile, Gothel, after discovering Maximus, a relentless palace horse who is determined to bring Rider to justice, near the tower, returns to the tower in fear that his rider might have found Rapunzel. She instead discovers Rapunzel missing and Flynn\u2019s satchel, in which she decides to go after the two herself. Royal soldiers led by one of the royal army's horses, Maximus, arrive in search of Flynn. Rapunzel and Flynn escape but are then trapped in a flooding cave. Resigned to his fate, Flynn reveals his real name: Eugene Fitzherbert. Rapunzel remembers that her hair glows when she sings and uses it to provide enough light to find a way out of the cave. Eugene and Rapunzel take refuge in a forest where Gothel, now in league with the Stabbingtons, gives the crown to Rapunzel and suggests using it to test Eugene's faithfulness.\n\nIn the morning, Maximus finds the pair and tries to arrest Flynn, but Rapunzel arranges a truce in honor of her birthday. The group reaches the kingdom and enjoys the festivities, culminating in an evening cruise as the lanterns are released. There, Rapunzel gives Eugene the crown after fulfilling her dream of seeing the lanterns in person. Rapunzel and Eugene realize they have fallen in love and are about to kiss when Eugene notices the Stabbingtons on the shore. Eugene leaves Rapunzel to give them the crown as an apology, but they knock him out, tie him to a boat and attempt to capture Rapunzel, after convincing her that Eugene has left her. Gothel then stages a rescue, betraying and incapacitating the brothers, and leaves with Rapunzel as Eugene and the Stabbingtons are detained at the palace.\n\nBack at the tower, Rapunzel recognizes the symbol of the kingdom, which she had subconsciously incorporated into her paintings over the years. Realizing that she is the long-lost princess, she confronts Gothel. As Eugene is sentenced to hang, Maximus and the Duckling thugs help him escape. Maximus then carries him back to Gothel's tower. Eugene enters by climbing Rapunzel's hair, only to find Rapunzel chained and gagged. Gothel fatally stabs Eugene and tries to force Rapunzel to leave with her, but Rapunzel agrees to submit forever willingly if she is allowed to heal Eugene. Eugene, wanting Rapunzel to be free, cuts off her hair, which causes it to turn brown and lose its magic, causing Gothel to age rapidly. She trips and falls out of the window of the tower, turning to dust even before she hits the ground.\n\nA heartbroken Rapunzel mourns for Eugene who dies in her arms. However, her tear, which still contains the flower's power, lands on his cheek and restores his life. The two return to the kingdom and Rapunzel reunites with her parents. Overjoyed, the kingdom breaks out in celebration, and Eugene is pardoned for his crimes. Rapunzel and Eugene eventually marry.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{main|List of Disney's Tangled characters}}\n* [[Mandy Moore]] as [[Rapunzel (Tangled)|Rapunzel]]<ref name=\"slashsep10\">{{cite news|last1=Connelly|first1=Brendon|title=Disney Pixar Add Cast to Rapunzel, Bear & the Bow and Toy Story 3, Reveal Plot of Cars 2 and Winnie the Pooh|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/disney-pixar-add-cast-to-rapunzel-bear-the-bow-and-toy-story-3-reveal-plot-of-cars-2-and-winnie-the-pooh/|accessdate=July 7, 2014|work=[[SlashFilm]]|publisher=/Film|date=September 10, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"fletchersep10\">{{cite news|last1=Fletcher|first1=Alex|title=Mandy Moore to voice 'Rapunzel' musical|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a176737/mandy-moore-to-voice-rapunzel-musical.html#~oJkxTzsfu8l7ZI|accessdate=July 7, 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines|Hearst Magazines UK]]|date=September 10, 2009}}</ref>\n** Delaney Rose Stein as young Rapunzel<ref name=yahooprofile />\n* [[Zachary Levi]] as [[Flynn Rider]]<ref name=slashsep10 /><ref name=fletchersep10 />\n* [[Donna Murphy]] as [[Mother Gothel]]<ref>{{cite news|last1=Franklin|first1=Garth|title=Donna Murphy Joins \"Rapunzel\" Cast|url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/news/15889|accessdate=July 7, 2014|work=[[Dark Horizons]]|publisher=Dark Futures Pty.

Many of the techniques and tools that were required to give the film the quality Keane demanded did not exist when the project was started, and Walt Disney Animation Studios had to create them on their own.<ref name=AWNDisneyLegacy3D /> Keane said, \"There\u2019s no photoreal hair.

Keane credited Disney 3D animator Kyle Strawitz with helping to combine CGI with the traditional hand-drawn style.<ref name=\"CGMeetup\" /> \"He took the house from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White]]'' and built it and painted it so it looked like a flat painting that suddenly started to move, and it had dimension and kept all of the soft, round curves of the brushstrokes of watercolor.

Each pair is used individually on each separate element that adds depth to a scene, like background, foreground, and characters, without adjusting for the relation with the other pairs. When sandwiched together later in production, the result was something that would be visually impossible in the real world, but which created an appealing look to the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/node/300278/get-tangled-hairrai|title=Get 'Tangled' up in hair-raising 3D!|work=The Manila Bulletin Newspaper Online|date=January 24, 2011|accessdate=June 20, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130050835/http://www.mb.com.ph/node/300278/get-tangled-hairrai|archivedate=January 30, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAs a counterpart to the appealing and cute design of Rapunzel,<ref name=GirlHowardGrenoInterview>{{cite web|title=Byron Howard & Nathan Greno Tangled Interview|url=http://www.girl.com.au/byron-howard-and-nathan-greno-tangled-blu-ray-interview.htm|publisher=Girl.com.au|accessdate=November 1, 2015|date=2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517021233/http://www.girl.com.au/byron-howard-and-nathan-greno-tangled-blu-ray-interview.htm|archivedate=May 17, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> the directors wanted to make Flynn Rider \"the most handsome, most attractive male lead Disney has ever had.\"<ref name=SRDisneyHunk>{{cite web|last1=Cornet |first1=Roth |title=Zach Levi on Being a Disney Hunk in \u2018Tangled\u2019, A Singer, A Superhero & \u2018Chuck |url=http://screenrant.com/disney-tangled-zach-levi-interview-chuck-rothc-88315/ |website=Screen Rant |accessdate=November 1, 2015 |date=November 18, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209125333/http://screenrant.com/disney-tangled-zach-levi-interview-chuck-rothc-88315/ |archivedate=December 9, 2014 }}</ref> They held a large \"Hot Man Meeting\" where they gathered about 30 women from the studio and asked them what they considered attractive in a man.<ref name=TelegraphTangledDirectors>{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Marc|title=Tangled directors on the latest Disney animation|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmmakersonfilm/8287107/Tangled-directors-on-the-latest-Disney-animation.html|accessdate=November 1, 2015|work=The Telegraph|date=January 27, 2011}}</ref> They brought in hundreds of images of their favourite male actors and celebrities, which were torn and pasted back again.<ref name=TelegraphTangledDirectors /><ref name=Disney11Things>{{cite web|title=11 Things You Didn\u2019t Know About Tangled|url=http://blogs.disney.com/oh-my-disney/2014/12/26/11-things-you-didnt-know-about-tangled/|publisher=Disney|accessdate=November 1, 2015|date=December 26, 2014}}</ref> After much deliberation, his look was eventually narrowed down to one concept drawing.<ref name=SRDisneyHunk /><ref name=TelegraphTangledDirectors />\n\n==== Technology development ====\nExisting technology continued to present difficulties: in particular, animating hair turned out to be a challenge.

Against her mother's wishes, she accepts the aid of an intruder to take her out into the world which she has never seen.\n\nBefore the film's release, its title was changed from ''Rapunzel'' to ''Tangled'', reportedly to market the film gender-neutrally.<ref name=\"LATimes\" /> ''Tangled'' spent six years in production at a cost that has been estimated at $260 million, which, if accurate, would make it the [[Most expensive animated films|most expensive animated film ever made]] and [[List of most expensive films|one of the most expensive films]] of all time. The film employed a unique artistic style by blending together features of [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) and [[traditional animation]] while using [[non-photorealistic rendering]] to create the impression of a painting. Composer [[Alan Menken]], who had worked on prior Disney animated features, returned to score ''Tangled''.\n\n''Tangled'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] on November 14, 2010, and went into general release on November 24. The film earned $592 million in worldwide box office revenue,<ref name=mojo /> $200 million of which was earned in the United States and Canada. The film was nominated for a number of awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] at the [[83rd Academy Awards]]. The film was released on [[Blu-ray]] and DVD on March 29, 2011; a short film, ''[[Tangled Ever After]]'', was released later in 2012 and a [[Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure|television series]] premiered in 2017.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please do not expand the plot summary any further. Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words. The current length is 700 words.-->\nLong ago, a drop of sunlight fell onto Earth and grew a magical flower capable of healing illness, decay, and injury. For hundreds of years, the flower is used by a woman named [[Mother Gothel]] to retain her youth, until soldiers from a nearby kingdom, find the flower and use it to heal their ailing and pregnant queen. Shortly afterward, the Queen gives birth to a shockingly blonde [[Rapunzel (Tangled)|Princess Rapunzel]]. While attempting to recover the flower, Gothel discovers that Rapunzel's golden hair contains the flower's healing properties. She tries to steal Rapunzel's hair but discovers that cutting her hair destroys its power. Gothel instead abducts the baby and raises Rapunzel as her own daughter in an isolated tower. In order to keep Rapunzel content in the tower, Gothel lied about the outside world being dangerous and filled with bad people who will hurt her and take advantage of her magical capabilities. Gothel often left their tower to find gifts for Rapunzel, leaving the girl alone most of the time. Once a year, the King and Queen release [[sky lantern]]s on Rapunzel's birthday, hoping for their daughter to see them and return.\n\nOn the eve of her 18th birthday, Rapunzel, who sees the lanterns each year on her birthday, asks to leave the tower and discover their source. Gothel refuses, claiming that the outside world is a dangerous place. Meanwhile, a thief named [[Flynn Rider]] takes the crown from the palace before ditching the Stabbington brothers, his comrades, while running from the palace guards. He finds Rapunzel\u2019s tower but is knocked out by a frying pan and hidden in the closet by Rapunzel. Gothel returns, and Rapunzel tries to explain to her how she can handle herself in the \u201cdangerous\u201d outside world because she incapacitated Flynn, but Gothel tells Rapunzel that she\u2019s not leaving the tower, ever. Rapunzel sends Gothel away to buy her paints and hides the crown, and convinces a reluctant Flynn to take her to see the flying lanterns for her birthday. She promises that she\u2019ll give him the crown if he obliges. Eager to reclaim the crown, Flynn takes Rapunzel to the Snuggly Duckling, a [[pub]] filled with menacing thugs, in an effort to discourage her into returning home, but instead, the thugs are charmed by Rapunzel when she encourages them to follow their dreams. Meanwhile, Gothel, after discovering Maximus, a relentless palace horse who is determined to bring Rider to justice, near the tower, returns to the tower in fear that his rider might have found Rapunzel. She instead discovers Rapunzel missing and Flynn\u2019s satchel, in which she decides to go after the two herself. Royal soldiers led by one of the royal army's horses, Maximus, arrive in search of Flynn. Rapunzel and Flynn escape but are then trapped in a flooding cave. Resigned to his fate, Flynn reveals his real name: Eugene Fitzherbert. Rapunzel remembers that her hair glows when she sings and uses it to provide enough light to find a way out of the cave. Eugene and Rapunzel take refuge in a forest where Gothel, now in league with the Stabbingtons, gives the crown to Rapunzel and suggests using it to test Eugene's faithfulness.\n\nIn the morning, Maximus finds the pair and tries to arrest Flynn, but Rapunzel arranges a truce in honor of her birthday. The group reaches the kingdom and enjoys the festivities, culminating in an evening cruise as the lanterns are released. There, Rapunzel gives Eugene the crown after fulfilling her dream of seeing the lanterns in person. Rapunzel and Eugene realize they have fallen in love and are about to kiss when Eugene notices the Stabbingtons on the shore. Eugene leaves Rapunzel to give them the crown as an apology, but they knock him out, tie him to a boat and attempt to capture Rapunzel, after convincing her that Eugene has left her. Gothel then stages a rescue, betraying and incapacitating the brothers, and leaves with Rapunzel as Eugene and the Stabbingtons are detained at the palace.\n\nBack at the tower, Rapunzel recognizes the symbol of the kingdom, which she had subconsciously incorporated into her paintings over the years. Realizing that she is the long-lost princess, she confronts Gothel. As Eugene is sentenced to hang, Maximus and the Duckling thugs help him escape. Maximus then carries him back to Gothel's tower. Eugene enters by climbing Rapunzel's hair, only to find Rapunzel chained and gagged. Gothel fatally stabs Eugene and tries to force Rapunzel to leave with her, but Rapunzel agrees to submit forever willingly if she is allowed to heal Eugene. Eugene, wanting Rapunzel to be free, cuts off her hair, which causes it to turn brown and lose its magic, causing Gothel to age rapidly. She trips and falls out of the window of the tower, turning to dust even before she hits the ground.\n\nA heartbroken Rapunzel mourns for Eugene who dies in her arms. However, her tear, which still contains the flower's power, lands on his cheek and restores his life. The two return to the kingdom and Rapunzel reunites with her parents. Overjoyed, the kingdom breaks out in celebration, and Eugene is pardoned for his crimes. Rapunzel and Eugene eventually marry.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{main|List of Disney's Tangled characters}}\n* [[Mandy Moore]] as [[Rapunzel (Tangled)|Rapunzel]]<ref name=\"slashsep10\">{{cite news|last1=Connelly|first1=Brendon|title=Disney Pixar Add Cast to Rapunzel, Bear & the Bow and Toy Story 3, Reveal Plot of Cars 2 and Winnie the Pooh|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/disney-pixar-add-cast-to-rapunzel-bear-the-bow-and-toy-story-3-reveal-plot-of-cars-2-and-winnie-the-pooh/|accessdate=July 7, 2014|work=[[SlashFilm]]|publisher=/Film|date=September 10, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"fletchersep10\">{{cite news|last1=Fletcher|first1=Alex|title=Mandy Moore to voice 'Rapunzel' musical|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a176737/mandy-moore-to-voice-rapunzel-musical.html#~oJkxTzsfu8l7ZI|accessdate=July 7, 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines|Hearst Magazines UK]]|date=September 10, 2009}}</ref>\n** Delaney Rose Stein as young Rapunzel<ref name=yahooprofile />\n* [[Zachary Levi]] as [[Flynn Rider]]<ref name=slashsep10 /><ref name=fletchersep10 />\n* [[Donna Murphy]] as [[Mother Gothel]]<ref>{{cite news|last1=Franklin|first1=Garth|title=Donna Murphy Joins \"Rapunzel\" Cast|url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/news/15889|accessdate=July 7, 2014|work=[[Dark Horizons]]|publisher=Dark Futures Pty.

Many of the techniques and tools that were required to give the film the quality Keane demanded did not exist when the project was started, and Walt Disney Animation Studios had to create them on their own.<ref name=AWNDisneyLegacy3D /> Keane said, \"There\u2019s no photoreal hair.

Keane credited Disney 3D animator Kyle Strawitz with helping to combine CGI with the traditional hand-drawn style.<ref name=\"CGMeetup\" /> \"He took the house from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White]]'' and built it and painted it so it looked like a flat painting that suddenly started to move, and it had dimension and kept all of the soft, round curves of the brushstrokes of watercolor.

Each pair is used individually on each separate element that adds depth to a scene, like background, foreground, and characters, without adjusting for the relation with the other pairs. When sandwiched together later in production, the result was something that would be visually impossible in the real world, but which created an appealing look to the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/node/300278/get-tangled-hairrai|title=Get 'Tangled' up in hair-raising 3D!|work=The Manila Bulletin Newspaper Online|date=January 24, 2011|accessdate=June 20, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130050835/http://www.mb.com.ph/node/300278/get-tangled-hairrai|archivedate=January 30, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAs a counterpart to the appealing and cute design of Rapunzel,<ref name=GirlHowardGrenoInterview>{{cite web|title=Byron Howard & Nathan Greno Tangled Interview|url=http://www.girl.com.au/byron-howard-and-nathan-greno-tangled-blu-ray-interview.htm|publisher=Girl.com.au|accessdate=November 1, 2015|date=2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517021233/http://www.girl.com.au/byron-howard-and-nathan-greno-tangled-blu-ray-interview.htm|archivedate=May 17, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> the directors wanted to make Flynn Rider \"the most handsome, most attractive male lead Disney has ever had.\"<ref name=SRDisneyHunk>{{cite web|last1=Cornet |first1=Roth |title=Zach Levi on Being a Disney Hunk in \u2018Tangled\u2019, A Singer, A Superhero & \u2018Chuck |url=http://screenrant.com/disney-tangled-zach-levi-interview-chuck-rothc-88315/ |website=Screen Rant |accessdate=November 1, 2015 |date=November 18, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209125333/http://screenrant.com/disney-tangled-zach-levi-interview-chuck-rothc-88315/ |archivedate=December 9, 2014 }}</ref> They held a large \"Hot Man Meeting\" where they gathered about 30 women from the studio and asked them what they considered attractive in a man.<ref name=TelegraphTangledDirectors>{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Marc|title=Tangled directors on the latest Disney animation|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmmakersonfilm/8287107/Tangled-directors-on-the-latest-Disney-animation.html|accessdate=November 1, 2015|work=The Telegraph|date=January 27, 2011}}</ref> They brought in hundreds of images of their favourite male actors and celebrities, which were torn and pasted back again.<ref name=TelegraphTangledDirectors /><ref name=Disney11Things>{{cite web|title=11 Things You Didn\u2019t Know About Tangled|url=http://blogs.disney.com/oh-my-disney/2014/12/26/11-things-you-didnt-know-about-tangled/|publisher=Disney|accessdate=November 1, 2015|date=December 26, 2014}}</ref> After much deliberation, his look was eventually narrowed down to one concept drawing.<ref name=SRDisneyHunk /><ref name=TelegraphTangledDirectors />\n\n==== Technology development ====\nExisting technology continued to present difficulties: in particular, animating hair turned out to be a challenge.
