The films mainly focus on [[Chucky (character)|Chucky]] (voiced by [[Brad Dourif]] in the original films and [[Mark Hamill]] in the [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]]), a notorious [[serial killer]] who frequently escapes death by performing a [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]] ritual to transfer his soul into a \"Good Guys\" doll. The original film, ''[[Child's Play (1988 film)|Child's Play]]'', was released on November{{nbsp}}9, 1988. The film has spawned six sequels, a remake, comic books, a video game, tie-in merchandise, and an upcoming television series. The first, second, and fourth films were box office successes with all of the films earning over $182 million worldwide. Including revenues from sales of videos, DVDs, VOD and merchandise, the franchise has generated over $250 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/10/08/curse-of-chucky-25-years/2861753/|title=After 25 years, Chucky is both a blessing and a 'Curse'|author=Bryan Alexander|work=[[USA Today]]|date=October 8, 2013|access-date=October 1, 2017}}</ref> It also won a [[Saturn Award]] for Best Horror Franchise.\n\nThe film series originally started out as straight horror with the first installment ''Child's Play'', which appears to have more [[psychological horror]] elements, while the next two installments are straightforward slasher films with elements of [[black comedy|dark humor]]. As the films progressed, they became [[satirical]] and [[campy]], until the series briefly became a [[horror comedy]], with 1998's ''[[Bride of Chucky]]'' and 2004's ''[[Seed of Chucky]]''. In 2012, it was confirmed that a new film would be made under the title ''[[Curse of Chucky]]'' and be released direct-to-video. Unlike ''Bride'' and ''Seed'', ''Curse of Chucky'' is a full-fledged horror film much like the original three installments. However, it does maintain the campy humor to a small degree. The seventh installment to the series, titled ''[[Cult of Chucky]]'', was released on October{{nbsp}}3, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/01/05/cult-chucky-sequel-childs-play|author=Clark Collins|title=Cult of Chucky: Horror sequel plot details, teaser video revealed|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=January 5, 2017|access-date=October 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSeveral short films have been made featuring the Chucky character: on the DVD release of ''Seed of Chucky'', a short film entitled ''Chucky's Vacation Slides'', set after the shooting of the film, was included, and a series of short films inserting Chucky into the events of other horror films entitled ''Chucky Invades'' was released in the run-up to the release of ''Curse of Chucky''. On television, Chucky has appeared in commercials and also on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', with a separate voice actor voicing the character. Chucky appeared in a pre-taped segment during an October 1998 episode of [[World Championship Wrestling]]'s ''[[Monday Nitro]]'' program as a [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]], taunting wrestler [[Rick Steiner]] who was a [[face (professional wrestling)|face]] at the time and promoting ''Bride of Chucky''.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=100%\n! scope=\"col\" | Film\n! scope=\"col\" | U.S. release date \n! scope=\"col\" | Director(s) \n! scope=\"col\" | Screenwriter(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Producer(s) \n!

The film is directed by Tom Holland. The story was also written by Holland, John Lafia, and Don Mancini, and starring Catherine Hicks as Karen Barclay, Chris Sarandon as Officer Mike Norris, Alex Vincent (in his first film performance) as Andy Barclay, and Brad Dourif as Charles Lee Ray and the voice of Chucky. The film was released on November 9, 1988. Set in Chicago, a serial killer and voodoo practitioner named Charles Lee Ray, or \"Chucky\" is mortally wounded after being shot in the chest by an officer and transfers his soul via a voodoo ritual into a child-sized doll. The doll is found by a homeless peddler and sold to Karen Barclay, who gives it to her son Andy as a birthday gift. Karen's friend Maggie is killed by an off-screen assailant, (Chucky) with a toy hammer, before she stumbles and falls from the kitchen window to her death. Karen does not believe Andy when he says \"Chucky did it!\". The next day, Andy skips school with Chucky to find Chucky's old partner who abandoned him a few nights back, Eddie Caputo. He breaks into Eddie's house and kills him by turning off the stove flame, and turning on the gas. Eddie fires his gun at the stove, thinking there is an intruder, and the house blows up, killing Eddie. After Andy is committed for his accusations against the doll, Karen notices that Chucky never had batteries placed in him, proving Andy right. After she threatens to throw him in the fire, Chucky panics, springs to life in her hands, biting her on the arm, and escaping the building to find and exact revenge on Mike Norris, the officer who killed Chucky the other night. As time goes on, Chucky realizes he has to get his soul out of the doll before it turns human and the transfer becomes permanent, and thus he has to possess the first person he told his secret to... Andy. He is eventually beaten in three ways: He is burned to a crisp, but survives, and then he is shot to pieces but somehow still survives. Finally, he is shot in the heart, at last, killing him. As Andy, Karen and Mike, all go to the hospital, Andy looks at Chucky's remains, knowing the fight isn't over yet, before the film goes to a freeze-frame and then fades to black.\n\n===''Child's Play 2'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Child's Play 2}}\n''[[Child's Play 2]]'' is the second film in the series and the first film produced by [[Universal Pictures]]. The film is directed by [[John Lafia]] and written by Mancini. Alex Vincent reprises his role as [[Andy Barclay]] and Brad Dourif returns as the voice of [[Chucky (character)|Chucky]], respectively. The film was released on November 9, 1990. The movie takes place in 1990, two years after the events of the first film. While Andy is now living in foster care, (as it was implied his mother was sent to an insane asylum after the events of the previous film) the doll's manufacturer has taken a positive corporate stance and rebuilds the doll to prove there is nothing wrong with the Good Guys brand. After a freak electrical malfunction brings Chucky back to life in a new Good Guys doll, he continues to follow Andy in order to transfer his soul from his doll body before it will once again become his permanent form. He infiltrates the foster home in order to spy on Andy. He eventually follows him to school, sabotages his school work and Andy gets detention. When Andy escapes back home, Chucky, (who was placed in a closet by the teacher), brutally kills her with a yard stick. A while later, Chucky attempts to transfer bodies with Andy before Kyle, (Andy's foster sister, played by [Christine Elise]) comes in through his window, after a date with her boyfriend, and unties Andy. Chucky, after being thrown into the basement, notices that he is getting a nosebleed, indicating he is turning human as time goes on. He tries one last time to get into Andy's body after he kills the foster mom and attacks Kyle, forcing her to drive him to Andy's new location. (Andy was taken back there after Chucky killed the foster father in an earlier scene). When Kyle and Andy meet up, (Chucky secretly holds a knife to Kyle's neck if something goes wrong) Grace Poole is killed after she takes Chucky from Kyle. Chucky makes his sinister presence known to her and stabs her in the chest, and she falls onto a printer as she bleeds to death. As Andy and Chucky both get onto the back of a mail truck, Kyle follows them in the car. They eventually get to the Play Pals factory (the location of the opening scene), and Chucky knocks Andy out to swap bodies with him once and for all. Chucky says the chant, but finds that he has wasted all his time in the doll, and he is trapped in it forever. Now with no option, he decides to kill Andy. He chases Andy and Kyle throughout the factory before his arm gets caught in a latched door, causing him to pull it off. He replaces it with a knife. After being stapled onto a board, Chucky tries to reason with Andy, before being sent into a machine, cutting off the doll's waist. It is revealed that Chucky escaped the machine, and, while scooting around on a cart in order to get around, he tells Andy he wants to kill him. Andy notices a vat of molten plastic, and Chucky begs for him not to open it. When Andy does, Chucky screams in pain as his plastic skin is burned and melted, presumably killing him. When the two look over his body, Chucky leaps up, trying to attack Kyle. Andy hands her an air hose, and Kyle shoves it into Chucky's mouth, resulting in his head filling with air and exploding, killing him once again. The two leave the factory, as Andy asks where their home is. Kyle says she doesn't know. In the televised only alternate extended ending, The vat of plastic is shown, revealing a chunk of Chucky's head fell in after he was killed. It sinks to the bottom, resulting in a new head being made. It gives an evil smile, and the film ends.\n\n===''Child's Play 3'' (1991)===\n{{Main|Child's Play 3}}\n''[[Child's Play 3]]'', also known as ''Child's Play 3: Look Who's Stalking!'',<ref>{{cite news|title= Boys guilty of Bulger murder |work= [[The Times]]|date=1993-11-25|url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/archive/tol_archive/article6820479.ece|access-date=2011-04-21|location=London|first1=Ronald|last1=Faux|first2=Bill|last2=Frost}}</ref> is the third film in the series, and the last film to be titled as ''Child's Play'', before the title changed into ''Chucky''. The film is directed by [[Jack Bender]], written by Mancini, and had Dourif reprise once again his role as Chucky, while [[Alex Vincent (actor)|Alex Vincent]] was replaced as Andy Barclay by [[Justin Whalin]] as an older version of Andy and a supporting cast of [[Perrey Reeves]] and Jeremy Sylvers. The film was released on August 30, 1991. Set in 1998, eight years after the events of the second film, the Good Guys factory has re-opened after the negative publicity, and as Chucky's remains are removed, some blood from his destroyed human-doll body drips into a vat of melted plastic used to re-mould the Good Guys line. Chucky returns in a new body, going on a hunt for the now-16-year-old Andy Barclay, who has left to attend a military academy after the results of the first two films. While attempting to reach Andy, Chucky finds a new boy, Ronald Tyler, who he shares his \"secret\" with. With a new \"Good Guys\" doll body brings the possibility of possessing a new human body, and Chucky attempts to restore his soul to its human form through Tyler as Andy attempts to stop the killer Good Guys doll once and for all.\n\n===''Bride of Chucky'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Bride of Chucky}}\nThe film picks up a month after the events of ''Child's Play 3''. Unlike the first three films, this film focuses entirely on Chucky and Tiffany. Charles Lee Ray's former girlfriend and his accomplice, Tiffany, acquires Chucky's remains, stitches them together and via a voodoo ritual revives Charles Lee Ray, albeit in a much different form. Chucky kills Tiffany, transferring her soul into a bride doll, and the two maniacs force a young couple, Jesse and Jade ([[Nick Stabile]] and [[Katherine Heigl]]), to bring them to Ray's grave, where Chucky plans to use a voodoo amulet to finally get a new body. In the end, the Tiffany doll gives birth to a new form of life (Glen/Glenda) as it flies out of a now-dead Tiffany and attacks a detective. No one knows whether the detective is dead or alive as the screen cuts to black and closing credits roll.\n\n===''Seed of Chucky'' (2004)===\n{{Main|Seed of Chucky}}\n''[[Seed of Chucky]]'' is the fifth installment, and the first film other than the original ''Child's Play'' not to be distributed by Universal Pictures. Chucky and Tiffany's child Glen finds his parents six years later, in 2004, and brings them back to life, but is horrified by their murders. Chucky and Tiffany force a pregnancy on actress Jennifer Tilly, which is accelerated by voodoo magic. Glen suffers a split personality disorder, having both a male and female soul in his/her body, and dismembers his father. Tiffany uses the ritual to take over Tilly's body and as Tilly bears twins, Glen's dual personality now has a body each of its own. In an epilogue set five years later, in 2009, one of Chucky's severed arms is mailed to the home of his family, where it attacks the now-human Glen.\n\n===''Curse of Chucky'' (2013)===\n{{Main|Curse of Chucky}}\n''[[Curse of Chucky]]'' is the first direct-to-video film in the series and the sixth installment. In 2013, nine years after the events of the fifth film and four years after its epilogue, Chucky is delivered to the family home of Nica and Sarah Pierce, where Chucky terrorizes and kills the family one by one. Chucky is driven by revenge, as Sarah was the one who called the police on him while he was still human, leading to his original death in the first film by detective Mike Norris and responsible for Nica's disability. Nica survives, but is institutionalized, and blamed for the murders. Chucky is collected by Tiffany, who delivers him to Alice. Chucky successfully transfers his soul into Alice's as he does the soul ritual and the camera moves to reveal Alice's grandmother emerging from the basement, with a plastic bag around her head, slowly dying. Six months later, Chucky is mailed to his next victim, who is revealed to be none other than his longtime original nemesis from the original first three films, Andy Barclay, who points a shotgun at Chucky and shoots him through the head.\n\n===''Cult of Chucky'' (2017)===\n{{Main|Cult of Chucky}}\nThe second direct-to-video film and seventh installment in the franchise, it is set in 2017, four years after ''Curse of Chucky''.  Chucky returns to terrorize Nica at the mental institution where she is admitted. Chucky goes on yet another murderous rampage, killing disbelieving employees and tenants at the institution with various dramatic tricks. When a now-vigilante Andy Barclay figures out Chucky's plan, he breaks into the institution in an attempt to disarm his newly-created voodoo plot. But in the end, Nica ends up being possessed by Chucky, which causes her to gain the ability to walk and leaves with Tiffany.\n\n===''Child's Play'' (2019)===\n{{Main|Child's Play (2019 film)}} The 2019 version of the film is a remake of the 1988 film, putting a modern spin on the origin story of Chucky. Rather than a Good Guys doll taking on the soul of a dead serial killer, this Chucky is a piece of rogue AI (a \"Buddi\" doll with the ability to control all the technology in a house remotely via the cloud) who becomes self-aware and violent after a disgruntled sweatshop employee disables all of his safety features as an act of spite. Andy Barclay is now portrayed as a 13-year-old boy living with his mother Karen in a new apartment building in Chicago, who finds use in him as a tool to scare his mother's detestable boyfriend, if nothing else. While using the Buddi Chucky having fun with his new friends Falyn and Pugg, it attaches itself to Andy at the hip, and with his violence inhibitors turned off, begins to kill those Andy dislikes (starting with the family cat, Mickey Rooney, who hurt Andy by scratching him). Once the doll murders his mother's boyfriend and delivers his skinned face to Andy's room, he realizes it is evil and has to be destroyed - but Buddi proves much easier to find than to lose. With no one believing his story about the doll turning evil, Andy has to take on Chucky himself and stop his murderous rampage in its tracks.\n\n===Future===\nIn October 2017, Don Mancini stated that he intends in having Glen and Glenda from ''[[Seed of Chucky]]'' return in a future film, and acknowledged that most references to that character had been cut from ''Cult of Chucky''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dailydead.com/interview-don-mancini-talks-cult-of-chucky-and-the-enduring-controversy-of-seed-of-chucky/|title=Interview: Don Mancini Talks CULT OF CHUCKY and the Enduring Controversy of SEED OF CHUCKY - Daily Dead|date=October 5, 2017|website=Dailydead.com|access-date=October 28, 2017}}</ref> In February 2018, it was announced that a ''Child's Play'' television series will be a continuation of the film's story arc.

The gameplay is actually inspired by the second film's climax.\n\nIn the game, Chucky is stuck in a never-ending nightmare in which he's endlessly running through the factory that produces Good Guys dolls. Players control Chucky while sprinting through the factory floor, the catwalks, the warehouse, or even outside, and need to avoid conveyor belts, forklifts, acid pools, barrels and other obstacles. Chucky can also eliminate security guards patrolling the factory using his classic knife or other more outlandish weapons like a cleaver, screwdriver, or hatchet. As they play, gamers collect batteries that can be used to purchase in-game items or power-ups, such as a double battery bonus, a fast start, or extra lives that can extend a run after dying.<ref>{{cite web|last=Webb|first=Charles|title=''Child's Play'' Killer Chucky The Unlikely Hero of Endless Runner ''Chucky: Slash & Dash''|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2468019/childs-play-killer-chucky-the-unlikely-hero-of-endless-runner-chucky-slash-dash/|work=MTV|date=August 30, 2013|access-date=October 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Universal theme park attractions===\nSince 1992, [[Chucky (character)|Chucky]] has starred in his own shows at [[Universal Studios]] ''[[Halloween Horror Nights]]'', entitled, ''Chucky's In-Your-Face Insults'' and ''Chucky's Insult Emporium''.\n\nIn 2009, the climax of ''[[Child's Play 3]]'' received its own maze, entitled ''Chucky's Fun House''.

The original film, ''[[Child's Play (1988 film)|Child's Play]]'', was released on November{{nbsp}}9, 1988. The film has spawned six sequels, a remake, comic books, a video game, tie-in merchandise, and an upcoming television series.

Including revenues from sales of videos, DVDs, VOD and merchandise, the franchise has generated over $250 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/10/08/curse-of-chucky-25-years/2861753/|title=After 25 years, Chucky is both a blessing and a 'Curse'|author=Bryan Alexander|work=[[USA Today]]|date=October 8, 2013|access-date=October 1, 2017}}</ref> It also won a [[Saturn Award]] for Best Horror Franchise.\n\nThe film series originally started out as straight horror with the first installment ''Child's Play'', which appears to have more [[psychological horror]] elements, while the next two installments are straightforward slasher films with elements of [[black comedy|dark humor]]. As the films progressed, they became [[satirical]] and [[campy]], until the series briefly became a [[horror comedy]], with 1998's ''[[Bride of Chucky]]'' and 2004's ''[[Seed of Chucky]]''. In 2012, it was confirmed that a new film would be made under the title ''[[Curse of Chucky]]'' and be released direct-to-video. Unlike ''Bride'' and ''Seed'', ''Curse of Chucky'' is a full-fledged horror film much like the original three installments. However, it does maintain the campy humor to a small degree. The seventh installment to the series, titled ''[[Cult of Chucky]]'', was released on October{{nbsp}}3, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/01/05/cult-chucky-sequel-childs-play|author=Clark Collins|title=Cult of Chucky: Horror sequel plot details, teaser video revealed|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=January 5, 2017|access-date=October 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSeveral short films have been made featuring the Chucky character: on the DVD release of ''Seed of Chucky'', a short film entitled ''Chucky's Vacation Slides'', set after the shooting of the film, was included, and a series of short films inserting Chucky into the events of other horror films entitled ''Chucky Invades'' was released in the run-up to the release of ''Curse of Chucky''. On television, Chucky has appeared in commercials and also on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', with a separate voice actor voicing the character.

The film is directed by Tom Holland. The story was also written by Holland, John Lafia, and Don Mancini, and starring Catherine Hicks as Karen Barclay, Chris Sarandon as Officer Mike Norris, Alex Vincent (in his first film performance) as Andy Barclay, and Brad Dourif as Charles Lee Ray and the voice of Chucky. The film was released on November 9, 1988. Set in Chicago, a serial killer and voodoo practitioner named Charles Lee Ray, or \"Chucky\" is mortally wounded after being shot in the chest by an officer and transfers his soul via a voodoo ritual into a child-sized doll. The doll is found by a homeless peddler and sold to Karen Barclay, who gives it to her son Andy as a birthday gift. Karen's friend Maggie is killed by an off-screen assailant, (Chucky) with a toy hammer, before she stumbles and falls from the kitchen window to her death. Karen does not believe Andy when he says \"Chucky did it!\". The next day, Andy skips school with Chucky to find Chucky's old partner who abandoned him a few nights back, Eddie Caputo. He breaks into Eddie's house and kills him by turning off the stove flame, and turning on the gas. Eddie fires his gun at the stove, thinking there is an intruder, and the house blows up, killing Eddie. After Andy is committed for his accusations against the doll, Karen notices that Chucky never had batteries placed in him, proving Andy right. After she threatens to throw him in the fire, Chucky panics, springs to life in her hands, biting her on the arm, and escaping the building to find and exact revenge on Mike Norris, the officer who killed Chucky the other night. As time goes on, Chucky realizes he has to get his soul out of the doll before it turns human and the transfer becomes permanent, and thus he has to possess the first person he told his secret to... Andy. He is eventually beaten in three ways: He is burned to a crisp, but survives, and then he is shot to pieces but somehow still survives. Finally, he is shot in the heart, at last, killing him. As Andy, Karen and Mike, all go to the hospital, Andy looks at Chucky's remains, knowing the fight isn't over yet, before the film goes to a freeze-frame and then fades to black.\n\n===''Child's Play 2'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Child's Play 2}}\n''[[Child's Play 2]]'' is the second film in the series and the first film produced by [[Universal Pictures]]. The film is directed by [[John Lafia]] and written by Mancini. Alex Vincent reprises his role as [[Andy Barclay]] and Brad Dourif returns as the voice of [[Chucky (character)|Chucky]], respectively. The film was released on November 9, 1990. The movie takes place in 1990, two years after the events of the first film. While Andy is now living in foster care, (as it was implied his mother was sent to an insane asylum after the events of the previous film) the doll's manufacturer has taken a positive corporate stance and rebuilds the doll to prove there is nothing wrong with the Good Guys brand. After a freak electrical malfunction brings Chucky back to life in a new Good Guys doll, he continues to follow Andy in order to transfer his soul from his doll body before it will once again become his permanent form. He infiltrates the foster home in order to spy on Andy. He eventually follows him to school, sabotages his school work and Andy gets detention. When Andy escapes back home, Chucky, (who was placed in a closet by the teacher), brutally kills her with a yard stick. A while later, Chucky attempts to transfer bodies with Andy before Kyle, (Andy's foster sister, played by [Christine Elise]) comes in through his window, after a date with her boyfriend, and unties Andy. Chucky, after being thrown into the basement, notices that he is getting a nosebleed, indicating he is turning human as time goes on. He tries one last time to get into Andy's body after he kills the foster mom and attacks Kyle, forcing her to drive him to Andy's new location. (Andy was taken back there after Chucky killed the foster father in an earlier scene). When Kyle and Andy meet up, (Chucky secretly holds a knife to Kyle's neck if something goes wrong) Grace Poole is killed after she takes Chucky from Kyle. Chucky makes his sinister presence known to her and stabs her in the chest, and she falls onto a printer as she bleeds to death. As Andy and Chucky both get onto the back of a mail truck, Kyle follows them in the car. They eventually get to the Play Pals factory (the location of the opening scene), and Chucky knocks Andy out to swap bodies with him once and for all. Chucky says the chant, but finds that he has wasted all his time in the doll, and he is trapped in it forever. Now with no option, he decides to kill Andy. He chases Andy and Kyle throughout the factory before his arm gets caught in a latched door, causing him to pull it off. He replaces it with a knife. After being stapled onto a board, Chucky tries to reason with Andy, before being sent into a machine, cutting off the doll's waist. It is revealed that Chucky escaped the machine, and, while scooting around on a cart in order to get around, he tells Andy he wants to kill him. Andy notices a vat of molten plastic, and Chucky begs for him not to open it. When Andy does, Chucky screams in pain as his plastic skin is burned and melted, presumably killing him. When the two look over his body, Chucky leaps up, trying to attack Kyle. Andy hands her an air hose, and Kyle shoves it into Chucky's mouth, resulting in his head filling with air and exploding, killing him once again. The two leave the factory, as Andy asks where their home is. Kyle says she doesn't know. In the televised only alternate extended ending, The vat of plastic is shown, revealing a chunk of Chucky's head fell in after he was killed. It sinks to the bottom, resulting in a new head being made. It gives an evil smile, and the film ends.\n\n===''Child's Play 3'' (1991)===\n{{Main|Child's Play 3}}\n''[[Child's Play 3]]'', also known as ''Child's Play 3: Look Who's Stalking!'',<ref>{{cite news|title= Boys guilty of Bulger murder |work= [[The Times]]|date=1993-11-25|url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/archive/tol_archive/article6820479.ece|access-date=2011-04-21|location=London|first1=Ronald|last1=Faux|first2=Bill|last2=Frost}}</ref> is the third film in the series, and the last film to be titled as ''Child's Play'', before the title changed into ''Chucky''. The film is directed by [[Jack Bender]], written by Mancini, and had Dourif reprise once again his role as Chucky, while [[Alex Vincent (actor)|Alex Vincent]] was replaced as Andy Barclay by [[Justin Whalin]] as an older version of Andy and a supporting cast of [[Perrey Reeves]] and Jeremy Sylvers. The film was released on August 30, 1991. Set in 1998, eight years after the events of the second film, the Good Guys factory has re-opened after the negative publicity, and as Chucky's remains are removed, some blood from his destroyed human-doll body drips into a vat of melted plastic used to re-mould the Good Guys line. Chucky returns in a new body, going on a hunt for the now-16-year-old Andy Barclay, who has left to attend a military academy after the results of the first two films. While attempting to reach Andy, Chucky finds a new boy, Ronald Tyler, who he shares his \"secret\" with. With a new \"Good Guys\" doll body brings the possibility of possessing a new human body, and Chucky attempts to restore his soul to its human form through Tyler as Andy attempts to stop the killer Good Guys doll once and for all.\n\n===''Bride of Chucky'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Bride of Chucky}}\nThe film picks up a month after the events of ''Child's Play 3''. Unlike the first three films, this film focuses entirely on Chucky and Tiffany. Charles Lee Ray's former girlfriend and his accomplice, Tiffany, acquires Chucky's remains, stitches them together and via a voodoo ritual revives Charles Lee Ray, albeit in a much different form. Chucky kills Tiffany, transferring her soul into a bride doll, and the two maniacs force a young couple, Jesse and Jade ([[Nick Stabile]] and [[Katherine Heigl]]), to bring them to Ray's grave, where Chucky plans to use a voodoo amulet to finally get a new body. In the end, the Tiffany doll gives birth to a new form of life (Glen/Glenda) as it flies out of a now-dead Tiffany and attacks a detective. No one knows whether the detective is dead or alive as the screen cuts to black and closing credits roll.\n\n===''Seed of Chucky'' (2004)===\n{{Main|Seed of Chucky}}\n''[[Seed of Chucky]]'' is the fifth installment, and the first film other than the original ''Child's Play'' not to be distributed by Universal Pictures. Chucky and Tiffany's child Glen finds his parents six years later, in 2004, and brings them back to life, but is horrified by their murders. Chucky and Tiffany force a pregnancy on actress Jennifer Tilly, which is accelerated by voodoo magic. Glen suffers a split personality disorder, having both a male and female soul in his/her body, and dismembers his father. Tiffany uses the ritual to take over Tilly's body and as Tilly bears twins, Glen's dual personality now has a body each of its own. In an epilogue set five years later, in 2009, one of Chucky's severed arms is mailed to the home of his family, where it attacks the now-human Glen.\n\n===''Curse of Chucky'' (2013)===\n{{Main|Curse of Chucky}}\n''[[Curse of Chucky]]'' is the first direct-to-video film in the series and the sixth installment. In 2013, nine years after the events of the fifth film and four years after its epilogue, Chucky is delivered to the family home of Nica and Sarah Pierce, where Chucky terrorizes and kills the family one by one. Chucky is driven by revenge, as Sarah was the one who called the police on him while he was still human, leading to his original death in the first film by detective Mike Norris and responsible for Nica's disability. Nica survives, but is institutionalized, and blamed for the murders. Chucky is collected by Tiffany, who delivers him to Alice. Chucky successfully transfers his soul into Alice's as he does the soul ritual and the camera moves to reveal Alice's grandmother emerging from the basement, with a plastic bag around her head, slowly dying. Six months later, Chucky is mailed to his next victim, who is revealed to be none other than his longtime original nemesis from the original first three films, Andy Barclay, who points a shotgun at Chucky and shoots him through the head.\n\n===''Cult of Chucky'' (2017)===\n{{Main|Cult of Chucky}}\nThe second direct-to-video film and seventh installment in the franchise, it is set in 2017, four years after ''Curse of Chucky''.  Chucky returns to terrorize Nica at the mental institution where she is admitted. Chucky goes on yet another murderous rampage, killing disbelieving employees and tenants at the institution with various dramatic tricks. When a now-vigilante Andy Barclay figures out Chucky's plan, he breaks into the institution in an attempt to disarm his newly-created voodoo plot. But in the end, Nica ends up being possessed by Chucky, which causes her to gain the ability to walk and leaves with Tiffany.\n\n===''Child's Play'' (2019)===\n{{Main|Child's Play (2019 film)}} The 2019 version of the film is a remake of the 1988 film, putting a modern spin on the origin story of Chucky. Rather than a Good Guys doll taking on the soul of a dead serial killer, this Chucky is a piece of rogue AI (a \"Buddi\" doll with the ability to control all the technology in a house remotely via the cloud) who becomes self-aware and violent after a disgruntled sweatshop employee disables all of his safety features as an act of spite. Andy Barclay is now portrayed as a 13-year-old boy living with his mother Karen in a new apartment building in Chicago, who finds use in him as a tool to scare his mother's detestable boyfriend, if nothing else. While using the Buddi Chucky having fun with his new friends Falyn and Pugg, it attaches itself to Andy at the hip, and with his violence inhibitors turned off, begins to kill those Andy dislikes (starting with the family cat, Mickey Rooney, who hurt Andy by scratching him). Once the doll murders his mother's boyfriend and delivers his skinned face to Andy's room, he realizes it is evil and has to be destroyed - but Buddi proves much easier to find than to lose. With no one believing his story about the doll turning evil, Andy has to take on Chucky himself and stop his murderous rampage in its tracks.\n\n===Future===\nIn October 2017, Don Mancini stated that he intends in having Glen and Glenda from ''[[Seed of Chucky]]'' return in a future film, and acknowledged that most references to that character had been cut from ''Cult of Chucky''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dailydead.com/interview-don-mancini-talks-cult-of-chucky-and-the-enduring-controversy-of-seed-of-chucky/|title=Interview: Don Mancini Talks CULT OF CHUCKY and the Enduring Controversy of SEED OF CHUCKY - Daily Dead|date=October 5, 2017|website=Dailydead.com|access-date=October 28, 2017}}</ref> In February 2018, it was announced that a ''Child's Play'' television series will be a continuation of the film's story arc.

While browsing through their photographs of their vacation on a slide projector, Tiffany notices various corpses in the background of certain photographs, realizing that Chucky has been killing people again. Tiffany leaves, with a distraught and sickened Glen, while Chucky continues to view the photographs.

The complaint was made mostly with concern for the region of [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]], claiming the advertisements are potentially traumatizing among children by reminding them of that region's high suicide rates, the various earthquakes that occurred, and the [[Christchurch mosque shootings]].

The series, titled ''Child's Play: The Series'', ended in 1992 after only five issues. This was followed by a three-issue adaptation of ''Child's Play 3''.\n\n====Devil's Due Publishing====\nIn 2007, [[Devil's Due Publishing]] obtained the license to publish ''Child's Play'' comics and released a one-shot crossover with [[Hack/Slash]] titled ''Hack/Slash vs. Chucky'' which takes place after the events of the ''Seed of Chucky'' film. This was followed by a four-issue series called ''Chucky''. A second volume began in early 2009 but ceased publication after only one issue.\n\n===Video game===\n{{main|Chucky: Slash & Dash}}\nSlimstown Studios announced an endless runner video game titled ''Chucky: Slash & Dash''. The game was released on iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and Android devices. It is the result of an agreement with Universal Partnerships & Licensing to develop and publish the first officially licensed smartphone and tablet ''Child's Play'' video game. The gameplay is actually inspired by the second film's climax.\n\nIn the game, Chucky is stuck in a never-ending nightmare in which he's endlessly running through the factory that produces Good Guys dolls. Players control Chucky while sprinting through the factory floor, the catwalks, the warehouse, or even outside, and need to avoid conveyor belts, forklifts, acid pools, barrels and other obstacles. Chucky can also eliminate security guards patrolling the factory using his classic knife or other more outlandish weapons like a cleaver, screwdriver, or hatchet. As they play, gamers collect batteries that can be used to purchase in-game items or power-ups, such as a double battery bonus, a fast start, or extra lives that can extend a run after dying.<ref>{{cite web|last=Webb|first=Charles|title=''Child's Play'' Killer Chucky The Unlikely Hero of Endless Runner ''Chucky: Slash & Dash''|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2468019/childs-play-killer-chucky-the-unlikely-hero-of-endless-runner-chucky-slash-dash/|work=MTV|date=August 30, 2013|access-date=October 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Universal theme park attractions===\nSince 1992, [[Chucky (character)|Chucky]] has starred in his own shows at [[Universal Studios]] ''[[Halloween Horror Nights]]'', entitled, ''Chucky's In-Your-Face Insults'' and ''Chucky's Insult Emporium''.\n\nIn 2009, the climax of ''[[Child's Play 3]]'' received its own maze, entitled ''Chucky's Fun House''.

It says:''Saxi placed this stone in memory of \u00c1sbj\u00f6rn T\u00f3fi's/T\u00f3ki's son, his partner. He did not flee at Uppsala, but slaughtered as long as he had a weapon''.]]\nThe ''Saga of the Jomsvikings'' relates that the Jomsvikings were highly selective in deciding whom to admit to their order. Membership was restricted to men of proven valor between 18 and 50 (with the exception of a boy named [[Vagn \u00c5kesson]], who defeated [[Sigvaldi Strut-Haraldsson]] in [[single combat]] at the age of 12). In order to gain admission, prospective members were required to prove themselves with a feat of strength, often taking the form of a ritual [[duel]], or ''[[holmgang]]'', with a Jomsviking.\n\nOnce admitted, the Jomsvikings required adherence to a strict code of conduct in order to instill a sense of [[military discipline]] among its members. Any violation of these rules could be punished with immediate expulsion from the order. Each Jomsviking was bound to defend his brothers, as well as to avenge their deaths if necessary. He was forbidden to speak ill of his fellows or to quarrel with them. [[Blood feud]]s between members were to be mediated by Jomsviking officers. Jomsvikings were forbidden to show fear or to flee in the face of an enemy of equal or inferior strength, though orderly retreat in the face of vastly outnumbering forces appears to have been acceptable. All spoils of battle were to be equally distributed among the entire brotherhood. No Jomsviking was permitted to be absent from Jomsborg for more than three days without the permission of the brotherhood. No women or children were allowed within the fortress walls, and none were to be taken captive. It is unclear, however, whether members were forbidden marriage or liaisons with women outside the walls.\n\n==History==\nThere are different accounts for the origins of the order. ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' (book 10) tells that a settlement named Julinum was conquered by the King of Denmark, [[Harald Bluetooth]], who gave it to the Swedish prince [[Styrbj\u00f6rn the Strong]]. Harald then provided Styrbj\u00f6rn with a strong force with which Styrbj\u00f6rn terrorized the seas. The ''[[Kn\u00fdtlinga saga]]'' agrees by giving Harald as the founder of the Jomsvikings, but the story of Styrbj\u00f6rn is not connected to the Jomsvikings. The ''[[J\u00f3msv\u00edkinga saga]]'' says that the settlement was founded by [[Palnatoke]], receiving the location from the mythical [[Wends|Wendish]] ruler [[Burislav]].{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}} ''[[Styrbjarnar \u00fe\u00e1ttr Sv\u00edakappa]]'' and ''[[Eyrbyggja saga]]'' agree with all previously mentioned versions by making Styrbj\u00f6rn take command of the Jomsvikings after they already had been established.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Eyrbyggja Saga'' \u00a7 29 (Palsson 83).</ref> ''Styrbjarnar \u00fe\u00e1ttr Sv\u00edakappa'' also tells that among the Norse there were many men from the \"East land\" arriving at [[Jomsborg]], suggesting that it was a settlement of mixed ethnicity. Jomsviking chieftains included Palnatok, Styrbj\u00f6rn the Strong, [[Sigvaldi Strut-Haraldsson]], [[Thorkell the High]], and [[Hemeng]].{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}\n[[Image:Efter slaget vid Fyrisvall.jpg|right|400px|thumb|After the [[Battle of the F\u00fdrisvellir]], by [[M\u00e5rten Eskil Winge]] (1888)]]\n[[Image:Svolder, by Otto Sinding.jpg|right|400px|thumb|The [[Battle of Svolder]], at which the Jomsvikings fought with [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]] against Norway, maybe with a swap of allegiance to side with Forkbeard's advantage, of his 400 ships to Tryggvason's 100. ([[Otto Sinding]] painter).]]\nAccounts of their size vary. In various sources, Jomsborg was supposed to have held anywhere from 30 to 300 ships in its harbor. However some historians believe Jomsborg was largely a market center with its Danish garrison imposed on the [[Wends]].<ref>Gwyn Jones, ''A History of the Vikings'', Oxford University Press, 1973, p. 127</ref>\n\n''Gesta Danorum'' (book 10), ''Styrbjarnar \u00fe\u00e1ttr Sv\u00edakappa'' and ''Eyrbyggja saga'' relate that in the early 980s, the exiled Swedish prince Styrbj\u00f6rn the Strong brought the Jomsvikings to a devastating defeat against Styrbj\u00f6rn's uncle King [[Eric the Victorious]] at the [[Battle of the F\u00fdrisvellir]], [[Uppsala]], in 984 or 985, while trying to take the crown of Sweden by force of arms.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The fact that the Jomsvikings lost was attributed to a pact which the Swedish king Eric made with Odin. Three runestones from this time, the [[H\u00f6gby Runestone]] (\"the brave champion Asmund fell on the Fyrisvellir\"), one of the [[H\u00e4llestad Runestones]], labelled [[Rundata|DR 295]] (\"he did not flee at Uppsala\"), and the [[Sj\u00f6rup Runestone]] (\"He did not flee at Uppsala, but slaughtered as long as he had a weapon\"), relate to deaths with honour at Uppsala, probably three Jomsvikings. The battle is also commemorated, in poetry, by the Icelandic [[skald]] [[\u00de\u00f3rvaldr Hjaltason]], who took part in the battle on the Swedish side.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}\n''J\u00f3msv\u00edkinga saga'' tells that in 986, they attacked [[Haakon Jarl]] in [[Norway]] and were defeated in the [[Battle of Hj\u00f6rungav\u00e1gr]]. The saga recounts that Jomsvikings captured by the Norwegians and about to be executed exhibited courage and defiance, some being eventually spared by their captors. The ''J\u00f3msv\u00edkinga saga'' ends with a brief explanation of the battle's aftermath and, in fact, points to this battle as the beginning of the end for the Jomsvikings.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}\n\nAfter these two decisive defeats, the power of the Jomsvikings waned, but ''[[Olaf Trygvasson]]'s Saga'' relates that they played a decisive, if treacherous, role in the [[Battle of Svolder]] in 1000. At Svolder, a Jomsviking force led by [[Sigvald Jarl]] abandoned King Olaf of Norway and joined forces with his enemies to annihilate his fleet.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}} This action may have been intended to fight the [[Christianization of Scandinavia]], which had been forcibly promoted by Olaf. As it happened though, the Danish king [[Sweyn Forkbeard]], who won the Norwegian throne when the sea battle ended, was (at least nominally) a Christian.  He and his father, King Harald Bluetooth of Denmark, are reported to have been baptized in 965.<ref>{{cite web\n|url= https://tidsskrift.dk/index.php/historisktidsskrift/article/view/31101/59930\n|title= Olav Tryggvesons fald og Venderne\n|publisher= Historisk Tidsskrift\n|author= Svend Elleh\u00f8j\n|accessdate=October 26, 2015}}</ref> Their decline continued over the next few decades.\n[[File:The Curmsun Disc - Obverse.png|left|thumb|Curmsun Disc - obverse]]\nAccording to the ''Heimskringla'', King [[Magnus I of Norway]] decided to put an end to the Jomsviking threat.

Jomsvikings were forbidden to show fear or to flee in the face of an enemy of equal or inferior strength, though orderly retreat in the face of vastly outnumbering forces appears to have been acceptable. All spoils of battle were to be equally distributed among the entire brotherhood. No Jomsviking was permitted to be absent from Jomsborg for more than three days without the permission of the brotherhood. No women or children were allowed within the fortress walls, and none were to be taken captive. It is unclear, however, whether members were forbidden marriage or liaisons with women outside the walls.\n\n==History==\nThere are different accounts for the origins of the order. ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' (book 10) tells that a settlement named Julinum was conquered by the King of Denmark, [[Harald Bluetooth]], who gave it to the Swedish prince [[Styrbj\u00f6rn the Strong]]. Harald then provided Styrbj\u00f6rn with a strong force with which Styrbj\u00f6rn terrorized the seas. The ''[[Kn\u00fdtlinga saga]]'' agrees by giving Harald as the founder of the Jomsvikings, but the story of Styrbj\u00f6rn is not connected to the Jomsvikings. The ''[[J\u00f3msv\u00edkinga saga]]'' says that the settlement was founded by [[Palnatoke]], receiving the location from the mythical [[Wends|Wendish]] ruler [[Burislav]].{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}} ''[[Styrbjarnar \u00fe\u00e1ttr Sv\u00edakappa]]'' and ''[[Eyrbyggja saga]]'' agree with all previously mentioned versions by making Styrbj\u00f6rn take command of the Jomsvikings after they already had been established.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Eyrbyggja Saga'' \u00a7 29 (Palsson 83).</ref> ''Styrbjarnar \u00fe\u00e1ttr Sv\u00edakappa'' also tells that among the Norse there were many men from the \"East land\" arriving at [[Jomsborg]], suggesting that it was a settlement of mixed ethnicity. Jomsviking chieftains included Palnatok, Styrbj\u00f6rn the Strong, [[Sigvaldi Strut-Haraldsson]], [[Thorkell the High]], and [[Hemeng]].{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}\n[[Image:Efter slaget vid Fyrisvall.jpg|right|400px|thumb|After the [[Battle of the F\u00fdrisvellir]], by [[M\u00e5rten Eskil Winge]] (1888)]]\n[[Image:Svolder, by Otto Sinding.jpg|right|400px|thumb|The [[Battle of Svolder]], at which the Jomsvikings fought with [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]] against Norway, maybe with a swap of allegiance to side with Forkbeard's advantage, of his 400 ships to Tryggvason's 100. ([[Otto Sinding]] painter).]]\nAccounts of their size vary. In various sources, Jomsborg was supposed to have held anywhere from 30 to 300 ships in its harbor. However some historians believe Jomsborg was largely a market center with its Danish garrison imposed on the [[Wends]].<ref>Gwyn Jones, ''A History of the Vikings'', Oxford University Press, 1973, p. 127</ref>\n\n''Gesta Danorum'' (book 10), ''Styrbjarnar \u00fe\u00e1ttr Sv\u00edakappa'' and ''Eyrbyggja saga'' relate that in the early 980s, the exiled Swedish prince Styrbj\u00f6rn the Strong brought the Jomsvikings to a devastating defeat against Styrbj\u00f6rn's uncle King [[Eric the Victorious]] at the [[Battle of the F\u00fdrisvellir]], [[Uppsala]], in 984 or 985, while trying to take the crown of Sweden by force of arms.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The fact that the Jomsvikings lost was attributed to a pact which the Swedish king Eric made with Odin. Three runestones from this time, the [[H\u00f6gby Runestone]] (\"the brave champion Asmund fell on the Fyrisvellir\"), one of the [[H\u00e4llestad Runestones]], labelled [[Rundata|DR 295]] (\"he did not flee at Uppsala\"), and the [[Sj\u00f6rup Runestone]] (\"He did not flee at Uppsala, but slaughtered as long as he had a weapon\"), relate to deaths with honour at Uppsala, probably three Jomsvikings. The battle is also commemorated, in poetry, by the Icelandic [[skald]] [[\u00de\u00f3rvaldr Hjaltason]], who took part in the battle on the Swedish side.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}\n''J\u00f3msv\u00edkinga saga'' tells that in 986, they attacked [[Haakon Jarl]] in [[Norway]] and were defeated in the [[Battle of Hj\u00f6rungav\u00e1gr]]. The saga recounts that Jomsvikings captured by the Norwegians and about to be executed exhibited courage and defiance, some being eventually spared by their captors. The ''J\u00f3msv\u00edkinga saga'' ends with a brief explanation of the battle's aftermath and, in fact, points to this battle as the beginning of the end for the Jomsvikings.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}\n\nAfter these two decisive defeats, the power of the Jomsvikings waned, but ''[[Olaf Trygvasson]]'s Saga'' relates that they played a decisive, if treacherous, role in the [[Battle of Svolder]] in 1000. At Svolder, a Jomsviking force led by [[Sigvald Jarl]] abandoned King Olaf of Norway and joined forces with his enemies to annihilate his fleet.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}} This action may have been intended to fight the [[Christianization of Scandinavia]], which had been forcibly promoted by Olaf. As it happened though, the Danish king [[Sweyn Forkbeard]], who won the Norwegian throne when the sea battle ended, was (at least nominally) a Christian.  He and his father, King Harald Bluetooth of Denmark, are reported to have been baptized in 965.<ref>{{cite web\n|url= https://tidsskrift.dk/index.php/historisktidsskrift/article/view/31101/59930\n|title= Olav Tryggvesons fald og Venderne\n|publisher= Historisk Tidsskrift\n|author= Svend Elleh\u00f8j\n|accessdate=October 26, 2015}}</ref> Their decline continued over the next few decades.\n[[File:The Curmsun Disc - Obverse.png|left|thumb|Curmsun Disc - obverse]]\nAccording to the ''Heimskringla'', King [[Magnus I of Norway]] decided to put an end to the Jomsviking threat.

The achievement of Brahmachari was a milestone in successful application of science in medical treatment in the years before arrival of antibiotics, when there were few specific drugs, including [[quinine]] for [[malaria]], iron for [[anaemia]], [[digitalis]] for heart diseases and [[arsenic]] compounds for [[syphilis]]. Most other ailments were treated symptomatically by palliative methods. Urea Stibamine was thus a significant addition to the arsenal of specific medicines.\n\n==Early life==\nUpendranath Brahmachari was born on 19 December 1873 in Sardanga village near Purbasthali, District Burdwan of West Bengal, India. His father Nilmony Brahmachari was a physician in East Indian Railways. His mother's name was Saurabh Sundari Devi. He completed his early education from Eastern Railways Boys' High School, Jamalpur. In 1893, he passed BA degree from [[Hooghly Mohsin College]] with honours in Mathematics and Chemistry. Thereafter he went to study Medicine with Higher Chemistry. He passed his master's degree in 1894 from the [[Presidency College, Kolkata]]. In M.B. Examination of 1900 of the [[University of Calcutta]], he stood first in Medicine and in Surgery for which he received Goodeve and Macleod awards. He obtained his MD degree in 1902, and was awarded a PhD degree in 1904, for his research paper on \"Studies in Haemolysis\" both from the [[University of Calcutta]].<ref name=\"UB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vigyanprasar.gov.in/scientists/UNBrahmachari.htm|title=Vigyan Prasar website \u2013 Upendra Nath Brahamachari}}</ref> In 1898, he married Nani Bala Devi.\n\n== Life and career ==\nBrahmachari joined the Provincial Medical Service in September 1899 and appointed as a teacher of [[Pathology]] and [[Materia Medica]], and physician in the [[Dhaka Medical College and Hospital|Dacca Medical School]] in 1901. In 1905, he was appointed as a teacher in Medicine and Physician at the Campbell Medical School([[Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital]]), [[Calcutta]], where he carried out most of his work on [[Leishmaniasis|kala-azar]] and made his monumental discovery of '''Urea Stibamine'''. The new drug led to a drastic decline in the deaths caused due to kala-azar. [[Sodium stibogluconate]], a newer form of this drug, is still widely used all over the world for the treatment of leishmaniasis.\n\nIn 1922, Brahmachari also discovered a new, deadly form of [[leishmaniasis]]. He called it dermal leishmanoid, marked by the appearance of sudden eruptions on the face of the patients without fever or other complaints. He observed it as a disease in partially cured cases of kala-azar, along with those who had no history of the disease at all.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brahmachari|first=U.

He retired from the government service as a physician in 1927. After retirement from the government service Brahmachari joined the [[R. G. Kar Medical College and Hospital|Carmichael Medical College]] in Kolkata as Professor of Tropical Diseases. He also served the [[National Medical Institute]], in charge of its Tropical Disease Ward. He was also the Head of the Department of Biochemistry and Honorary Professor of Biochemistry at the [[University College of Science, Calcutta]].<ref name=\"UB\" />\n\nAround 1924, Brahmachari established the ''Brahmachari Research Institute'' in his own residence in Cornwallis Street (Vidhan Sarani), Kolkata. This institute was later converted into a Partnership concern with his sons Phanindra Nath and Nirmal Kumar. Under his guidance this Institute did quite well both in the fields of research and manufacture of medicine. The institute stopped functioning in 1963.<ref name=\"UB\"/>\n\n==Social services==\nBrahmachari played an important part in the formation of the world's second Blood Bank in Kolkata in 1939. He was the Chairman of the Blood Transfusion Service of Bengal. He was the Vice-President of the St. John Ambulance Association of the Bengal branch and also its President. He was the first Indian to become the Chairman of the Managing Body of the Indian Red Cross Society of the Bengal Branch. He generously contributed to the High School in [[Purbasthali]] (in [[Bardhaman district]]) near his ancestral house.

The achievement of Brahmachari was a milestone in successful application of science in medical treatment in the years before arrival of antibiotics, when there were few specific drugs, including [[quinine]] for [[malaria]], iron for [[anaemia]], [[digitalis]] for heart diseases and [[arsenic]] compounds for [[syphilis]]. Most other ailments were treated symptomatically by palliative methods. Urea Stibamine was thus a significant addition to the arsenal of specific medicines.\n\n==Early life==\nUpendranath Brahmachari was born on 19 December 1873 in Sardanga village near Purbasthali, District Burdwan of West Bengal, India. His father Nilmony Brahmachari was a physician in East Indian Railways. His mother's name was Saurabh Sundari Devi. He completed his early education from Eastern Railways Boys' High School, Jamalpur. In 1893, he passed BA degree from [[Hooghly Mohsin College]] with honours in Mathematics and Chemistry. Thereafter he went to study Medicine with Higher Chemistry. He passed his master's degree in 1894 from the [[Presidency College, Kolkata]]. In M.B. Examination of 1900 of the [[University of Calcutta]], he stood first in Medicine and in Surgery for which he received Goodeve and Macleod awards. He obtained his MD degree in 1902, and was awarded a PhD degree in 1904, for his research paper on \"Studies in Haemolysis\" both from the [[University of Calcutta]].<ref name=\"UB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vigyanprasar.gov.in/scientists/UNBrahmachari.htm|title=Vigyan Prasar website \u2013 Upendra Nath Brahamachari}}</ref> In 1898, he married Nani Bala Devi.\n\n== Life and career ==\nBrahmachari joined the Provincial Medical Service in September 1899 and appointed as a teacher of [[Pathology]] and [[Materia Medica]], and physician in the [[Dhaka Medical College and Hospital|Dacca Medical School]] in 1901. In 1905, he was appointed as a teacher in Medicine and Physician at the Campbell Medical School([[Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital]]), [[Calcutta]], where he carried out most of his work on [[Leishmaniasis|kala-azar]] and made his monumental discovery of '''Urea Stibamine'''. The new drug led to a drastic decline in the deaths caused due to kala-azar. [[Sodium stibogluconate]], a newer form of this drug, is still widely used all over the world for the treatment of leishmaniasis.\n\nIn 1922, Brahmachari also discovered a new, deadly form of [[leishmaniasis]]. He called it dermal leishmanoid, marked by the appearance of sudden eruptions on the face of the patients without fever or other complaints. He observed it as a disease in partially cured cases of kala-azar, along with those who had no history of the disease at all.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brahmachari|first=U.

He retired from the government service as a physician in 1927. After retirement from the government service Brahmachari joined the [[R. G. Kar Medical College and Hospital|Carmichael Medical College]] in Kolkata as Professor of Tropical Diseases. He also served the [[National Medical Institute]], in charge of its Tropical Disease Ward. He was also the Head of the Department of Biochemistry and Honorary Professor of Biochemistry at the [[University College of Science, Calcutta]].<ref name=\"UB\" />\n\nAround 1924, Brahmachari established the ''Brahmachari Research Institute'' in his own residence in Cornwallis Street (Vidhan Sarani), Kolkata. This institute was later converted into a Partnership concern with his sons Phanindra Nath and Nirmal Kumar. Under his guidance this Institute did quite well both in the fields of research and manufacture of medicine. The institute stopped functioning in 1963.<ref name=\"UB\"/>\n\n==Social services==\nBrahmachari played an important part in the formation of the world's second Blood Bank in Kolkata in 1939. He was the Chairman of the Blood Transfusion Service of Bengal. He was the Vice-President of the St. John Ambulance Association of the Bengal branch and also its President. He was the first Indian to become the Chairman of the Managing Body of the Indian Red Cross Society of the Bengal Branch. He generously contributed to the High School in [[Purbasthali]] (in [[Bardhaman district]]) near his ancestral house. The school was later renamed the ''Purbasthali Nilmony Brahmachari Institution''.<ref name=\"UB\"/>\nThey have few Temples in Sardanga village which are being renovation by his family successor.\n\n==Awards and honours==\n\n[[File:Upendranath Brahmachari Road - Kolkata 2011-10-16 160462.JPG|thumb|250px|Dr. U.

The album was recorded between 1995 and 1996 at [[Olympic Studios]] in [[Barnes, London]], and Strongroom Studios in [[Shoreditch, London]], by producers Matt Rowe and [[Richard Stannard (songwriter)|Richard Stannard]], and the production duo [[Absolute (production team)|Absolute]]. ''Spice'' is a [[Pop music|pop]] album that incorporates styles such as [[Dance music|dance]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]]. It is considered to be the record that brought [[teen pop]] back, opening the doors for a wave of teen pop artists.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/style/teen-pop-ma0000002895 |title=Teen Pop Music Genre Overview |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=2 April 2017}}</ref> Conceptually, the album centered on the idea of [[Girl Power]], and the hype surrounding the group was compared to [[Beatlemania]].\n\nA worldwide commercial success, ''Spice'' peaked at number one in more than 17 countries across the world, and was certified Multi-Platinum in 27 countries, Platinum in 14 countries and Gold in three countries, including 10-times Platinum in the United Kingdom and Canada, eight-times Platinum in Europe, and seven-times Platinum in the United States.

In the band's native UK, all four singles went to number one on the UK Singles Chart and, on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], the album spawned three top-five singles.\n\n==Background==\nIn February 1994, [[Chris Herbert|Chris]] and [[Bob Herbert (manager)|Bob Herbert]], who together with financer Chic Murphy traded under the business name of Heart Management, placed an advert in ''[[The Stage]]'' magazine, which asked the question: \"Are you street smart, extrovert, ambitious, and able to sing and dance?\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6251176.stm |title=Timeline: Spice Girls |website=[[BBC News]] |date=28 June 2007 |accessdate=1 April 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"RS bio\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/spice-girls/biography |title=Spice Girls Biography |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=11 May 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002023840/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/spice-girls/biography |archivedate=2 October 2013}}</ref> The management received hundreds of replies, but eventually reduced their search down to a final group of five girls: [[Victoria Beckham|Victoria Adams]], [[Melanie Brown]], [[Melanie Chisholm]], [[Geri Halliwell]] and [[Michelle Stephenson]]. The new band was originally called Touch and moved to a house in [[Maidenhead]]. [[Emma Bunton]] was the last to join after Stephenson dropped out when her mother became ill.\n\nThe group felt insecure about the lack of contract and were frustrated by the direction in which Heart Management was steering them. In October 1994, armed with a catalog of [[demo (music)|demos]] and dance routines, the group began touring management agencies.\nThey started to meet with producers, musicians and other business executives, among them were composer [[Tim Hawes]], and writers [[Richard Stannard (songwriter)|Richard Stannard]] and Matthew Rowe. Hawes worked with the group and watched the evolution in their singing and writing abilities. Together they composed a song called \"Sugar and Spice\", which served as the inspiration behind the change of the group's name to \"Spice\". Eventually the name was changed again to \"Spice Girls\" due to an American rapper using the name \"Spice\" at the time. On 3 March 1995, because of the group's frustration at their management's unwillingness to listen to their visions and ideas, they parted from Heart Management. The group stole the master recordings of their [[discography]] from the management offices in order to ensure they kept full control of their own work.<ref>{{harvnb|Sinclair|2004|p=34}}</ref>\n\n==Recording and production==\nThe group were supposed to meet with producer [[Eliot Kennedy]] the week after they left their former managers, but the meeting was arranged by the Herberts weeks before their departure. But without access to Herbert's address book, they knew nothing of Kennedy's whereabouts other than he lived in [[Sheffield]]. Brown and Halliwell drove to Sheffield the day after the departure from Heart Management and looked for the first phone book they came across; Eliot was the third Kennedy that they called. That evening they went to his house and persuaded him to work with them. The rest of the girls travelled to Sheffield the next day.<ref>{{harvnb|Sinclair|2004|p=38}}</ref> Kennedy commented about the session: \"None of them played instruments, so I was left to do the music and get that vibe together. What I said to them was, 'Look, I've got a [[refrain|chorus]]\u2014check this out'. Then they were throwing lines at us. 10 minutes later the song was written. Then you go through and refine it. Then later, as you were recording it you might change a few thing here and there. But pretty much it was a real quick process.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Sinclair|2004|p=40}}</ref> Four tracks were composed in that session: \"Love Thing\", \"[[Say You'll Be There]]\", \"[[Step to Me]]\" (which was released later) and \"Strong Enough\".<ref>McGibbon, 1997. pp 100, 103.</ref> In the following months the group continued to meet with producers, wrote new songs, prepared demos and searched for a new manager. They met again with the writers [[Richard Stannard (songwriter)|Stannard]] and Rowe. They had previously worked with the girls in January 1995 before their departure from Heart Management; that was the group's first professional songwriting session, held at the [[Strongroom]] in Curtain Road, east London.<ref>{{harvnb|Sinclair|2004|p=42}}</ref>\n\n{{listen\n | filename     = WannabeSample.ogg\n | title        = \"Wannabe\"\n | description  = The album's lead single is a dance-pop song about union and solidarity between friends.\n | filename2    = SayYoullBeThereSample.ogg\n | title2       = \"Say You'll Be There\"\n | description2 = The album's second single is a mix of pop and R&B, that describes how the girls have been there for each other.\n | pos      = left\n}}\nIn the first session with Stannard and Rowe, they wrote \"Feed Your Love\", a slow, soulful song which was eventually recorded and mastered for the album, but not released because it was considered too rude and racy for their target audience. Similarly, \"C U Next Tuesday\", a song initially meant for the album, was never released supposedly due to the initials of the song's title spelling the word \"[[cunt]]\" which is considered by many to be vulgar. Having completed that session, the girls wanted to write something more [[uptempo]], so they started to write the song that would be the lead of the album, \"[[Wannabe]]\", which was recorded in under an hour\u2014mainly because they had already written parts of the songs beforehand.<ref>{{harvnb|Spice Girls|1997|pp=34\u201335}}</ref> The next song they recorded was a slow [[Sentimental ballad|ballad]] and the third track on and single from the album, \"[[2 Become 1]]\". The song was inspired by the special relationship which had developed between Halliwell and Rowe during the session.<ref>{{harvnb|Sinclair|2004|p=43}}</ref> \"Mama\" was written by the Spice Girls with songwriting partners Matt Rowe and [[Biffco|Richard Stannard]]. In an interview about the writing process between the group and the duo, Rowe credits [[Mel B]] as the one who came up with the song's concept.<ref>{{harvnb|Sinclair|2004|p=52}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Kutner|Leigh|2005|pp=361\u2013362}}</ref> During the writing process, each member wrote a small verse in a different corner of the recording studio, while the chorus was finished around the piano with a guitar. Then, the producers added a [[Gospel music|gospel choir]] filled with the group's [[harmonies]] at the end of the song.<ref>{{harvnb|Canfield|Hansen|Geffen|Dozier|2009|p=24}}</ref> In May 1995, the group was introduced to Paul Wilson and Andy Watkins, the songwriters and production duo known as [[Absolute (production team)|Absolute]]. Watkins commented about their first meeting, \"They played us a few tracks, which we didn't particularly like. So we thought, this is OK. We can work with this.\" A songwriting session was booked within the next few days at Absolute's studio located on [[Tagg's Island]] near [[Chertsey]], but the musical association between them did not seem to go well at the beginning. Wilson remembered, \"When they started to sing it was never quite right: from our point of view. It was very poptastic.\" Watkins recalled, \"After two sessions we phoned our managers and said 'This just ain't happening'.\" It was at this point that Watkins and Wilson heard \"[[Wannabe]]\" for the first time. When speaking about the song, Wilson said, \"We listened to it and we didn't get it at all. It was so different to what we were doing. We thought is this going to work?\".<ref name=\"absrec\">{{harvnb|Sinclair|2004|pp=48\u201350}}</ref>\n\nThe next session was the definite one; either they would continue to work with the group or break up their relationship. Wilson recalled, \"Every previous time we'd met up with the girls we had prepared a backing track. This time we had nothing.\" Watkins also said, \"They said they wanted to do something up and a bit of fun, so we just off the top of our heads started to come up with a full-on [[disco]] backing track, which became '[[Who Do You Think You Are (Spice Girls song)|Who Do You Think You Are]]'.\" Wilson said of the song, \"The thing is when they wrote it, they were also writing the dance routine, constructing the music video, all at the same time as writing the song. And that's when the penny dropped.\" The girls went on to write \"Something Kinda Funny\", \"Last Time Lover\", \"Naked\", \"Bumper to Bumper\", \"Take Me Home\", \"One of These Girls\", and \"Baby Come Round\" with Watkins and Wilson, none of them [[Single (music)|singles]], but all of them tracks which lent a touch of classy [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] feel to the ''Spice'' album and singles. Absolute also produced all of these songs as well as the three tracks penned with Eliot Kennedy: \"Say You'll Be There\" \"Love Thing\" and later \"Step to me\" giving the duo a guiding hand in six of the ten tracks that eventually ended up on ''Spice''. The tracks that Absolute produced were recorded for the most part at [[Olympic Studios]] in [[Barnes, London|Barnes]]. At this time, 1995, the [[Auto-Tune]] facility had yet to come to the market and most of the vocals were recorded with few adjustments made afterwards.<ref name=\"absrec\"/> Absolute told [[Simon Fuller]] about the group they had worked with and asked whether he would consider managing them. Fuller received a demo of \"Something Kinda Funny\", one of the songs the group wrote with Absolute.<ref name=\"somlast\">{{harvnb|Spice Girls|1997|p=41}}</ref> He showed interest in the group, began a relationship and decided to sign them at [[19 Entertainment|19 Management]] in March 1995. In September 1995 the group signed a deal with [[Virgin Records]], and continued to write and record tracks for their debut album while touring the west coast of the United States, where they signed a publishing deal with Windswept Pacific in November.<ref name=\"timeline\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thespicegirls.com/facts/timeline |title=Spice Facts: Timeline |website=TheSpiceGirls.com |accessdate=3 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212173222/http://www.thespicegirls.com/facts/timeline |archivedate=12 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe Spice Girls were fully involved in the writing of all the songs. Halliwell in particular was clearly a fund of ideas for songs, arriving at sessions with her book of jottings, notes and miscellaneous scribblings which often produced the starting point of a lyric or a song title or just an agenda for the day's work. Watkins commented, \"Geri [Halliwell] would come up with the concept for a song. Typically, she'd sing one line and the girls would pick up on it or we'd pick up on it and construct around it and then Mel C [Chisholm] and Emma [Bunton] would be very active. They'd really like to sit and sing melodies and go off and come up with little sections.\"<ref name=\"wripro\">{{harvnb|Sinclair|2004|p=54}}</ref> They ''\"conceptualised\"'' and sang bits of melody and wrote the lyrics. But in musical terms it was not a partnership of equals. Rowe commented: \"We had to kind of steer it. It was very different for different tracks really. Some of them were when we were all [[Jam session|jamming]] in the room. We'd just put up some drum sounds and start making things up. On other tracks me and Richard [Stannard] would prepare something beforehand and play it to them. We'd have some lyrics and make them write the second verse.\"<ref name=\"wripro\"/> The Spice Girls introduced two key innovations that have had a lasting impact on the way which modern [[Pop music|pop]] acts go about their creative business. Firstly they introduced the idea of songwriting identity. This was a familiar concept in [[rock bands]] like [[Queen (band)|Queen]] or the [[Sex Pistols]], but not in the world of \"[[manufactured pop]]\", where the credits of songwriting would be divided out strictly in accordance with whoever had written the song. The Spice Girls recognised their solidarity as a group, which depended on maintaining parity in all departments, including the songwriting credits and the resulting [[royalties]]. They share the songwriting royalties on all the songs irrespective of what any member of the group had or had not contributed to any particular song.<ref name=\"writinno\">{{harvnb|Sinclair|2004|pp=51\u201352}}</ref> The second thing the Spice Girls established from the outset was a straight 50\u201350 split between them and their various songwriting collaborators. Here they anticipated one of the key developments in the pop industry since the 1990s, namely the increasing importance of publishing royalties as opposed to royalties payments made for the performance of the song on the record.<ref name=\"writinno\"/>\n\n==Composition==\n\n===Lyrical content===\n\"[[Wannabe]]\", the most emblematic song of the [[Girl Power]] philosophy, was chosen as the first track and lead single of the album.

It is considered to be the record that brought [[teen pop]] back, opening the doors for a wave of teen pop artists.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/style/teen-pop-ma0000002895 |title=Teen Pop Music Genre Overview |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=2 April 2017}}</ref> Conceptually, the album centered on the idea of [[Girl Power]], and the hype surrounding the group was compared to [[Beatlemania]].\n\nA worldwide commercial success, ''Spice'' peaked at number one in more than 17 countries across the world, and was certified Multi-Platinum in 27 countries, Platinum in 14 countries and Gold in three countries, including 10-times Platinum in the United Kingdom and Canada, eight-times Platinum in Europe, and seven-times Platinum in the United States. It became the world's top-selling album of 1997, selling 19 million copies in over a year. The album has sold a total of 23 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling album in music history by a girl group and one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]].\n\nFive singles were released from the album. The lead single, \"[[Wannabe]]\", reached number one in 35 countries, becoming one of the [[List of best-selling singles|best-selling singles of all time]] and selling over six million copies worldwide. The next two singles, \"[[Say You'll Be There]]\" and \"[[2 Become 1]]\", reached number one in 53 countries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thespicegirls.com/facts/biography |title=Spice Facts: Biography |website=TheSpiceGirls.com |accessdate=30 August 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821225745/http://www.thespicegirls.com/facts/biography |archivedate=21 August 2009}}</ref> \"[[Who Do You Think You Are (Spice Girls song)|Who Do You Think You Are]]\" was released as the official [[Comic Relief]] single in the UK as a [[double A-side]] with \"[[Mama (Spice Girls song)|Mama]]\" and both songs reached the top 20 in charts across Europe, Australia and New Zealand. In the band's native UK, all four singles went to number one on the UK Singles Chart and, on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], the album spawned three top-five singles.\n\n==Background==\nIn February 1994, [[Chris Herbert|Chris]] and [[Bob Herbert (manager)|Bob Herbert]], who together with financer Chic Murphy traded under the business name of Heart Management, placed an advert in ''[[The Stage]]'' magazine, which asked the question: \"Are you street smart, extrovert, ambitious, and able to sing and dance?\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6251176.stm |title=Timeline: Spice Girls |website=[[BBC News]] |date=28 June 2007 |accessdate=1 April 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"RS bio\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/spice-girls/biography |title=Spice Girls Biography |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=11 May 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002023840/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/spice-girls/biography |archivedate=2 October 2013}}</ref> The management received hundreds of replies, but eventually reduced their search down to a final group of five girls: [[Victoria Beckham|Victoria Adams]], [[Melanie Brown]], [[Melanie Chisholm]], [[Geri Halliwell]] and [[Michelle Stephenson]]. The new band was originally called Touch and moved to a house in [[Maidenhead]]. [[Emma Bunton]] was the last to join after Stephenson dropped out when her mother became ill.\n\nThe group felt insecure about the lack of contract and were frustrated by the direction in which Heart Management was steering them. In October 1994, armed with a catalog of [[demo (music)|demos]] and dance routines, the group began touring management agencies.\nThey started to meet with producers, musicians and other business executives, among them were composer [[Tim Hawes]], and writers [[Richard Stannard (songwriter)|Richard Stannard]] and Matthew Rowe. Hawes worked with the group and watched the evolution in their singing and writing abilities. Together they composed a song called \"Sugar and Spice\", which served as the inspiration behind the change of the group's name to \"Spice\". Eventually the name was changed again to \"Spice Girls\" due to an American rapper using the name \"Spice\" at the time. On 3 March 1995, because of the group's frustration at their management's unwillingness to listen to their visions and ideas, they parted from Heart Management. The group stole the master recordings of their [[discography]] from the management offices in order to ensure they kept full control of their own work.<ref>{{harvnb|Sinclair|2004|p=34}}</ref>\n\n==Recording and production==\nThe group were supposed to meet with producer [[Eliot Kennedy]] the week after they left their former managers, but the meeting was arranged by the Herberts weeks before their departure. But without access to Herbert's address book, they knew nothing of Kennedy's whereabouts other than he lived in [[Sheffield]]. Brown and Halliwell drove to Sheffield the day after the departure from Heart Management and looked for the first phone book they came across; Eliot was the third Kennedy that they called. That evening they went to his house and persuaded him to work with them. The rest of the girls travelled to Sheffield the next day.<ref>{{harvnb|Sinclair|2004|p=38}}</ref> Kennedy commented about the session: \"None of them played instruments, so I was left to do the music and get that vibe together. What I said to them was, 'Look, I've got a [[refrain|chorus]]\u2014check this out'. Then they were throwing lines at us. 10 minutes later the song was written. Then you go through and refine it. Then later, as you were recording it you might change a few thing here and there. But pretty much it was a real quick process.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Sinclair|2004|p=40}}</ref> Four tracks were composed in that session: \"Love Thing\", \"[[Say You'll Be There]]\", \"[[Step to Me]]\" (which was released later) and \"Strong Enough\".<ref>McGibbon, 1997. pp 100, 103.</ref> In the following months the group continued to meet with producers, wrote new songs, prepared demos and searched for a new manager. They met again with the writers [[Richard Stannard (songwriter)|Stannard]] and Rowe. They had previously worked with the girls in January 1995 before their departure from Heart Management; that was the group's first professional songwriting session, held at the [[Strongroom]] in Curtain Road, east London.<ref>{{harvnb|Sinclair|2004|p=42}}</ref>\n\n{{listen\n | filename     = WannabeSample.ogg\n | title        = \"Wannabe\"\n | description  = The album's lead single is a dance-pop song about union and solidarity between friends.\n | filename2    = SayYoullBeThereSample.ogg\n | title2       = \"Say You'll Be There\"\n | description2 = The album's second single is a mix of pop and R&B, that describes how the girls have been there for each other.\n | pos      = left\n}}\nIn the first session with Stannard and Rowe, they wrote \"Feed Your Love\", a slow, soulful song which was eventually recorded and mastered for the album, but not released because it was considered too rude and racy for their target audience. Similarly, \"C U Next Tuesday\", a song initially meant for the album, was never released supposedly due to the initials of the song's title spelling the word \"[[cunt]]\" which is considered by many to be vulgar. Having completed that session, the girls wanted to write something more [[uptempo]], so they started to write the song that would be the lead of the album, \"[[Wannabe]]\", which was recorded in under an hour\u2014mainly because they had already written parts of the songs beforehand.<ref>{{harvnb|Spice Girls|1997|pp=34\u201335}}</ref> The next song they recorded was a slow [[Sentimental ballad|ballad]] and the third track on and single from the album, \"[[2 Become 1]]\". The song was inspired by the special relationship which had developed between Halliwell and Rowe during the session.<ref>{{harvnb|Sinclair|2004|p=43}}</ref> \"Mama\" was written by the Spice Girls with songwriting partners Matt Rowe and [[Biffco|Richard Stannard]]. In an interview about the writing process between the group and the duo, Rowe credits [[Mel B]] as the one who came up with the song's concept.<ref>{{harvnb|Sinclair|2004|p=52}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Kutner|Leigh|2005|pp=361\u2013362}}</ref> During the writing process, each member wrote a small verse in a different corner of the recording studio, while the chorus was finished around the piano with a guitar. Then, the producers added a [[Gospel music|gospel choir]] filled with the group's [[harmonies]] at the end of the song.<ref>{{harvnb|Canfield|Hansen|Geffen|Dozier|2009|p=24}}</ref> In May 1995, the group was introduced to Paul Wilson and Andy Watkins, the songwriters and production duo known as [[Absolute (production team)|Absolute]]. Watkins commented about their first meeting, \"They played us a few tracks, which we didn't particularly like. So we thought, this is OK. We can work with this.\" A songwriting session was booked within the next few days at Absolute's studio located on [[Tagg's Island]] near [[Chertsey]], but the musical association between them did not seem to go well at the beginning. Wilson remembered, \"When they started to sing it was never quite right: from our point of view. It was very poptastic.\" Watkins recalled, \"After two sessions we phoned our managers and said 'This just ain't happening'.\" It was at this point that Watkins and Wilson heard \"[[Wannabe]]\" for the first time. When speaking about the song, Wilson said, \"We listened to it and we didn't get it at all. It was so different to what we were doing. We thought is this going to work?\".<ref name=\"absrec\">{{harvnb|Sinclair|2004|pp=48\u201350}}</ref>\n\nThe next session was the definite one; either they would continue to work with the group or break up their relationship. Wilson recalled, \"Every previous time we'd met up with the girls we had prepared a backing track. This time we had nothing.\" Watkins also said, \"They said they wanted to do something up and a bit of fun, so we just off the top of our heads started to come up with a full-on [[disco]] backing track, which became '[[Who Do You Think You Are (Spice Girls song)|Who Do You Think You Are]]'.\" Wilson said of the song, \"The thing is when they wrote it, they were also writing the dance routine, constructing the music video, all at the same time as writing the song. And that's when the penny dropped.\" The girls went on to write \"Something Kinda Funny\", \"Last Time Lover\", \"Naked\", \"Bumper to Bumper\", \"Take Me Home\", \"One of These Girls\", and \"Baby Come Round\" with Watkins and Wilson, none of them [[Single (music)|singles]], but all of them tracks which lent a touch of classy [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] feel to the ''Spice'' album and singles. Absolute also produced all of these songs as well as the three tracks penned with Eliot Kennedy: \"Say You'll Be There\" \"Love Thing\" and later \"Step to me\" giving the duo a guiding hand in six of the ten tracks that eventually ended up on ''Spice''. The tracks that Absolute produced were recorded for the most part at [[Olympic Studios]] in [[Barnes, London|Barnes]]. At this time, 1995, the [[Auto-Tune]] facility had yet to come to the market and most of the vocals were recorded with few adjustments made afterwards.<ref name=\"absrec\"/> Absolute told [[Simon Fuller]] about the group they had worked with and asked whether he would consider managing them. Fuller received a demo of \"Something Kinda Funny\", one of the songs the group wrote with Absolute.<ref name=\"somlast\">{{harvnb|Spice Girls|1997|p=41}}</ref> He showed interest in the group, began a relationship and decided to sign them at [[19 Entertainment|19 Management]] in March 1995. In September 1995 the group signed a deal with [[Virgin Records]], and continued to write and record tracks for their debut album while touring the west coast of the United States, where they signed a publishing deal with Windswept Pacific in November.<ref name=\"timeline\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thespicegirls.com/facts/timeline |title=Spice Facts: Timeline |website=TheSpiceGirls.com |accessdate=3 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212173222/http://www.thespicegirls.com/facts/timeline |archivedate=12 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe Spice Girls were fully involved in the writing of all the songs. Halliwell in particular was clearly a fund of ideas for songs, arriving at sessions with her book of jottings, notes and miscellaneous scribblings which often produced the starting point of a lyric or a song title or just an agenda for the day's work. Watkins commented, \"Geri [Halliwell] would come up with the concept for a song. Typically, she'd sing one line and the girls would pick up on it or we'd pick up on it and construct around it and then Mel C [Chisholm] and Emma [Bunton] would be very active. They'd really like to sit and sing melodies and go off and come up with little sections.\"<ref name=\"wripro\">{{harvnb|Sinclair|2004|p=54}}</ref> They ''\"conceptualised\"'' and sang bits of melody and wrote the lyrics. But in musical terms it was not a partnership of equals. Rowe commented: \"We had to kind of steer it. It was very different for different tracks really. Some of them were when we were all [[Jam session|jamming]] in the room. We'd just put up some drum sounds and start making things up. On other tracks me and Richard [Stannard] would prepare something beforehand and play it to them. We'd have some lyrics and make them write the second verse.\"<ref name=\"wripro\"/> The Spice Girls introduced two key innovations that have had a lasting impact on the way which modern [[Pop music|pop]] acts go about their creative business. Firstly they introduced the idea of songwriting identity. This was a familiar concept in [[rock bands]] like [[Queen (band)|Queen]] or the [[Sex Pistols]], but not in the world of \"[[manufactured pop]]\", where the credits of songwriting would be divided out strictly in accordance with whoever had written the song. The Spice Girls recognised their solidarity as a group, which depended on maintaining parity in all departments, including the songwriting credits and the resulting [[royalties]]. They share the songwriting royalties on all the songs irrespective of what any member of the group had or had not contributed to any particular song.<ref name=\"writinno\">{{harvnb|Sinclair|2004|pp=51\u201352}}</ref> The second thing the Spice Girls established from the outset was a straight 50\u201350 split between them and their various songwriting collaborators. Here they anticipated one of the key developments in the pop industry since the 1990s, namely the increasing importance of publishing royalties as opposed to royalties payments made for the performance of the song on the record.<ref name=\"writinno\"/>\n\n==Composition==\n\n===Lyrical content===\n\"[[Wannabe]]\", the most emblematic song of the [[Girl Power]] philosophy, was chosen as the first track and lead single of the album. It highlights the [[slogan]]s the group tend to cite like the union and solidarity between friends and the power exercised by women over men.<ref name=\"wandes\">{{harvnb|Berenguer|1997|p=42}}</ref> The second single \"[[Say You'll Be There]]\" described the things the group had been through together and how they had always been there for each other.<ref>{{harvnb|Spice Girls|1997|p=36}}</ref> It received mixed reviews; some critics praised it as a catchy song,<ref name=\"amgresp\"/> while others dubbed it as merely a bid for credibility,<ref name=\"entweerew\"/> while others described the lyrics as \"confusing\".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Browne |first=David |url=https://ew.com/article/1997/06/20/grading-singles/ |title=Music Commentary: The Singles Scene |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=20 June 1997 |accessdate=17 November 2018}}</ref> The third single \"[[2 Become 1]]\" focused upon the bonding of lovers, and how the bond can become so strong that they practically become one entity, through the act of sex; in addition, the lyrics address the importance of [[contraception]].<ref>{{harvnb|Spice Girls|1997|pp=38\u201339}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Wannabetotonto cropped.jpg|thumb|right|235px|The group performing \"Wannabe\" during [[The Return of the Spice Girls Tour]] in Toronto in February 2008]]\n\"Love Thing\" is the fourth track; it focuses on relationships and how after many disappointments the girls do not want to know anything about love.
