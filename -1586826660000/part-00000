It is characterized by the [[Meissner effect]], the complete ejection of [[magnetic field|magnetic field lines]] from the interior of the superconductor during its transitions into the superconducting state. The occurrence of the Meissner effect indicates that superconductivity cannot be understood simply as the [[Idealization (science philosophy)|idealization]] of ''[[perfect conductor|perfect conductivity]]'' in [[classical physics]].\n\nIn 1986, it was discovered that some [[cuprate superconductor|cuprate]]-[[perovskite (structure)|perovskite]] [[ceramic]] materials have a critical temperature above {{convert|90|K|\u00b0C|abbr=on|0}}.<ref name=Bednorz>{{cite journal\n| author = J.

The cheaply available coolant [[liquid nitrogen]] boils at 77&nbsp;K, and thus the existence of superconductivity at higher temperatures than this facilitates many experiments and applications that are less practical at lower temperatures.\n\n== Classification ==\n{{Main|Superconductor classification}}\nThere are many criteria by which superconductors are classified. The most common are:\n\n=== Response to a magnetic field ===\nA superconductor can be ''[[Type I superconductor|Type&nbsp;I]]'', meaning it has a single [[critical field]], above which all superconductivity is lost and below which the magnetic field is completely expelled from the superconductor; or ''[[Type II superconductor|Type&nbsp;II]]'', meaning it has two critical fields, between which it allows partial penetration of the magnetic field through isolated points. These points are called [[Quantum vortex|vortices]]. Furthermore, in multicomponent superconductors it is possible to have a combination of the two behaviours. In that case the superconductor is of [[Type-1.5 superconductor|Type-1.5]].\n\n=== By theory of operation ===\nIt is ''[[conventional superconductor|conventional]]'' if it can be explained by the [[BCS theory]] or its derivatives, or ''[[unconventional superconductor|unconventional]]'', otherwise.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gibney|first=Elizabeth|author-link=Elizabeth Gibney|date=5 March 2018|title=Surprise graphene discovery could unlock secrets of superconductivity|department=News|journal=Nature|volume=555|issue=7695|pages=151&ndash;2|doi=10.1038/d41586-018-02773-w|pmid=29517044|quote=Superconductors come broadly in two types: conventional, in which the activity can be explained by the mainstream theory of superconductivity, and unconventional, where it can\u2019t.|bibcode=2018Natur.555..151G}}</ref>\n\n=== By critical temperature ===\nA superconductor is generally considered ''[[high-temperature superconductivity|high-temperature]]'' if it reaches a superconducting state above a temperature of 30 K;<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Grant|first=Paul Michael|date=2011|title=The great quantum conundrum|journal=Nature|publisher=Nature Publishing Group, a division of Macmillan Publishers Limited.

For instance, all superconductors have ''exactly'' zero resistivity to low applied currents when there is no magnetic field present or if the applied field does not exceed a critical value. The existence of these \"universal\" properties implies that superconductivity is a [[phase (matter)|thermodynamic phase]], and thus possesses certain distinguishing properties which are largely independent of microscopic details.\n\n=== Zero electrical DC resistance ===\n[[File:CERN-cables-p1030764.jpg|thumb|Electric cables for accelerators at [[CERN]].

The resistance of the sample is given by [[Ohm's law]] as ''R&nbsp;=&nbsp;V&nbsp;/&nbsp;I''. If the voltage is zero, this means that the resistance is zero.\n\nSuperconductors are also able to maintain a current with no applied voltage whatsoever, a property exploited in [[Superconducting magnet|superconducting electromagnets]] such as those found in [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] machines. Experiments have demonstrated that currents in superconducting coils can persist for years without any measurable degradation. Experimental evidence points to a current lifetime of at least 100,000 years. Theoretical estimates for the lifetime of a persistent current can exceed the estimated lifetime of the [[universe]], depending on the wire geometry and the temperature.<ref name=\"Gallop\" /> In practice, currents injected in superconducting coils have persisted for more than 23 years (as in August 2018) in superconducting [http://www.astro.oma.be/en/world-record-in-the-underground-laboratory-of-membach/ gravimeters].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Van Camp|first=Michel|last2=Francis|first2=Olivier|last3=Lecocq|first3=Thomas|title=Recording Belgium's Gravitational History|journal=Eos|language=en-US|volume=98|doi=10.1029/2017eo089743|year=2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Van Camp|first=Michel|last2=de Viron|first2=Olivier|last3=Watlet|first3=Arnaud|last4=Meurers|first4=Bruno|last5=Francis|first5=Olivier|last6=Caudron|first6=Corentin|title=Geophysics From Terrestrial Time-Variable Gravity Measurements|journal=Reviews of Geophysics|volume=55|issue=4|language=en|pages=2017RG000566|doi=10.1002/2017rg000566|issn=1944-9208|bibcode=2017RvGeo..55..938V|year=2017}}</ref> In such instruments, the measurement principle is based on the monitoring of the levitation of a superconducting niobium sphere with a mass of 4 grams.\n\nIn a normal conductor, an electric current may be visualized as a fluid of [[electron]]s moving across a heavy [[ion]]ic lattice. The electrons are constantly colliding with the ions in the lattice, and during each collision some of the [[energy]] carried by the current is absorbed by the lattice and converted into [[heat]], which is essentially the vibrational [[kinetic energy]] of the lattice ions. As a result, the energy carried by the current is constantly being dissipated. This is the phenomenon of electrical resistance and [[Joule heating]].\n\nThe situation is different in a superconductor. In a conventional superconductor, the electronic fluid cannot be resolved into individual electrons. Instead, it consists of bound ''pairs'' of electrons known as [[Cooper pair]]s. This pairing is caused by an attractive force between electrons from the exchange of [[phonon]]s. Due to [[quantum mechanics]], the [[energy spectrum]] of this Cooper pair fluid possesses an ''[[energy gap]]'', meaning there is a minimum amount of energy \u0394''E'' that must be supplied in order to excite the fluid. Therefore, if \u0394''E'' is larger than the [[thermal energy]] of the lattice, given by ''kT'', where ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]] and ''T'' is the [[temperature]], the fluid will not be scattered by the lattice.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tinkham |first1=Michael |title=Introduction to Superconductivity |date=1996 |publisher=Dover Publications, INC |location=Mineola, New York |isbn=0486435032 |page=8}}</ref> The Cooper pair fluid is thus a [[superfluid]], meaning it can flow without energy dissipation.\n\nIn a class of superconductors known as [[type II superconductor]]s, including all known [[high-temperature superconductor]]s, an extremely low but nonzero resistivity appears at temperatures not too far below the nominal superconducting transition when an electric current is applied in conjunction with a strong magnetic field, which may be caused by the electric current. This is due to the motion of [[Abrikosov vortex|magnetic vortices]] in the electronic superfluid, which dissipates some of the energy carried by the current. If the current is sufficiently small, the vortices are stationary, and the resistivity vanishes. The resistance due to this effect is tiny compared with that of non-superconducting materials, but must be taken into account in sensitive experiments. However, as the temperature decreases far enough below the nominal superconducting transition, these vortices can become frozen into a disordered but stationary phase known as a \"vortex glass\". Below this vortex glass transition temperature, the resistance of the material becomes truly zero.\n\n===  Phase transition {{anchor|Superconducting phase transition}} ===\n[[File:Cvandrhovst.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Behavior of heat capacity (c<sub>v</sub>, blue) and resistivity (\u03c1, green) at the superconducting phase transition]]\nIn superconducting materials, the characteristics of superconductivity appear when the [[temperature]] ''T'' is lowered below a critical temperature ''T''<sub>c</sub>. The value of this critical temperature varies from material to material. Conventional superconductors usually have critical temperatures ranging from around 20&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] to less than 1&nbsp;K. Solid [[mercury (element)|mercury]], for example, has a critical temperature of 4.2&nbsp;K. As of 2015, the highest critical temperature found for a conventional superconductor is 203K for H<sub>2</sub>S, although high pressures of approximately 90 gigapascals were required.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Drozdov|first1=A|last2=Eremets|first2=M|last3=Troyan|first3=I|last4=Ksenofontov|first4=V|title=Conventional superconductivity at 203 kelvin at high pressures in the sulfur hydride system|journal=Nature|date=17 August 2015|volume=525|issue=2\u20133|pages=73\u201376|doi=10.1038/nature14964|pmid=11369082|arxiv=1506.08190|bibcode=2015Natur.525...73D}}</ref> [[Cuprate superconductor]]s can have much higher critical temperatures: [[YBCO|YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>]], one of the first cuprate superconductors to be discovered, has a critical temperature above 90&nbsp;K, and mercury-based cuprates have been found with critical temperatures in excess of 130&nbsp;K. The basic physical mechanism responsible for the high critical temperature is not yet clear. However, it is clear that a two-electron pairing is involved, although the nature of the pairing (<math>s</math> wave vs. <math>d</math> wave) remains controversial.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tinkham |first1=Michael |title=Introduction to Superconductivity |date=1996 |publisher=Dover Publications, INC |location=Mineola, New York |isbn=0486435032 |page=16}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, at a fixed temperature below the critical temperature, superconducting materials cease to superconduct when an external [[magnetic field]] is applied which is greater than the ''critical magnetic field''. This is because the [[Gibbs free energy]] of the superconducting phase increases quadratically with the magnetic field while the free energy of the normal phase is roughly independent of the magnetic field. If the material superconducts in the absence of a field, then the superconducting phase free energy is lower than that of the normal phase and so for some finite value of the magnetic field (proportional to the square root of the difference of the free energies at zero magnetic field) the two free energies will be equal and a phase transition to the normal phase will occur. More generally, a higher temperature and a stronger magnetic field lead to a smaller fraction of electrons that are superconducting and consequently to a longer [[London penetration depth]] of external magnetic fields and currents. The penetration depth becomes infinite at the phase transition.\n\nThe onset of superconductivity is accompanied by abrupt changes in various physical properties, which is the hallmark of a [[phase transition]]. For example, the electronic [[heat capacity]] is proportional to the temperature in the normal (non-superconducting) regime. At the superconducting transition, it suffers a discontinuous jump and thereafter ceases to be linear. At low temperatures, it varies instead as ''e''<sup>\u2212\u03b1/''T''</sup> for some constant, \u03b1. This exponential behavior is one of the pieces of evidence for the existence of the [[energy gap]].\n\nThe [[Second-order transition|order]] of the superconducting [[phase transition#Order parameters|phase transition]] was long a matter of debate. Experiments indicate that the transition is second-order, meaning there is no [[latent heat]]. However, in the presence of an external magnetic field there is latent heat, because the superconducting phase has a lower entropy below the critical temperature than the normal phase. It has been experimentally demonstrated<ref>{{cite journal\n |author = R. L.

In the 1980s it was shown theoretically with the help of a [[disorder field|disorder field theory]], in which the [[vortex line]]s of the superconductor play a major role, that the transition is of second order within the [[Type II superconductor|type II]] regime and of first order (i.e., [[latent heat]]) within the [[Type I superconductor|type I]] regime, and that the two regions are separated by a [[tricritical point]].<ref>{{cite journal\n | author = H.

The Meissner effect does not cause the field to be completely ejected but instead the field penetrates the superconductor but only to a very small distance, characterized by a parameter&nbsp;''\u03bb'', called the [[London penetration depth]], decaying exponentially to zero within the bulk of the material. The [[Meissner effect]] is a defining characteristic of superconductivity. For most superconductors, the London penetration depth is on the order of 100&nbsp;nm.\n\nThe Meissner effect is sometimes confused with the kind of [[diamagnetism]] one would expect in a perfect electrical conductor: according to [[Lenz's law]], when a ''changing'' magnetic field is applied to a conductor, it will induce an electric current in the conductor that creates an opposing magnetic field. In a perfect conductor, an arbitrarily large current can be induced, and the resulting magnetic field exactly cancels the applied field.\n\nThe Meissner effect is distinct from this\u2014it is the spontaneous expulsion which occurs during transition to superconductivity. Suppose we have a material in its normal state, containing a constant internal magnetic field. When the material is cooled below the critical temperature, we would observe the abrupt expulsion of the internal magnetic field, which we would not expect based on Lenz's law.\n\nThe Meissner effect was given a phenomenological explanation by the brothers [[Fritz London|Fritz]] and [[Heinz London]], who showed that the electromagnetic [[thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] in a superconductor is minimized provided\n\n:<math> \\nabla^2\\mathbf{H} = \\lambda^{-2} \\mathbf{H}\\, </math>\n\nwhere '''H''' is the magnetic field and \u03bb is the [[London penetration depth]].\n\nThis equation, which is known as the [[London equation]], predicts that the magnetic field in a superconductor [[exponential decay|decays exponentially]] from whatever value it possesses at the surface.\n\nA superconductor with little or no magnetic field within it is said to be in the Meissner state. The Meissner state breaks down when the applied magnetic field is too large. Superconductors can be divided into two classes according to how this breakdown occurs. In [[Type I superconductor]]s, superconductivity is abruptly destroyed when the strength of the applied field rises above a critical value ''H<sub>c</sub>''.

In [[Type II superconductor]]s, raising the applied field past a critical value ''H''<sub>''c''1</sub> leads to a mixed state (also known as the vortex state) in which an increasing amount of [[magnetic flux]] penetrates the material, but there remains no resistance to the flow of electric current as long as the current is not too large. At a second critical field strength ''H''<sub>''c''2</sub>, superconductivity is destroyed. The mixed state is actually caused by vortices in the electronic superfluid, sometimes called [[fluxon]]s because the flux carried by these vortices is [[quantum|quantized]].

It is characterized by the [[Meissner effect]], the complete ejection of [[magnetic field|magnetic field lines]] from the interior of the superconductor during its transitions into the superconducting state. The occurrence of the Meissner effect indicates that superconductivity cannot be understood simply as the [[Idealization (science philosophy)|idealization]] of ''[[perfect conductor|perfect conductivity]]'' in [[classical physics]].\n\nIn 1986, it was discovered that some [[cuprate superconductor|cuprate]]-[[perovskite (structure)|perovskite]] [[ceramic]] materials have a critical temperature above {{convert|90|K|\u00b0C|abbr=on|0}}.<ref name=Bednorz>{{cite journal\n| author = J.

The cheaply available coolant [[liquid nitrogen]] boils at 77&nbsp;K, and thus the existence of superconductivity at higher temperatures than this facilitates many experiments and applications that are less practical at lower temperatures.\n\n== Classification ==\n{{Main|Superconductor classification}}\nThere are many criteria by which superconductors are classified. The most common are:\n\n=== Response to a magnetic field ===\nA superconductor can be ''[[Type I superconductor|Type&nbsp;I]]'', meaning it has a single [[critical field]], above which all superconductivity is lost and below which the magnetic field is completely expelled from the superconductor; or ''[[Type II superconductor|Type&nbsp;II]]'', meaning it has two critical fields, between which it allows partial penetration of the magnetic field through isolated points. These points are called [[Quantum vortex|vortices]]. Furthermore, in multicomponent superconductors it is possible to have a combination of the two behaviours. In that case the superconductor is of [[Type-1.5 superconductor|Type-1.5]].\n\n=== By theory of operation ===\nIt is ''[[conventional superconductor|conventional]]'' if it can be explained by the [[BCS theory]] or its derivatives, or ''[[unconventional superconductor|unconventional]]'', otherwise.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gibney|first=Elizabeth|author-link=Elizabeth Gibney|date=5 March 2018|title=Surprise graphene discovery could unlock secrets of superconductivity|department=News|journal=Nature|volume=555|issue=7695|pages=151&ndash;2|doi=10.1038/d41586-018-02773-w|pmid=29517044|quote=Superconductors come broadly in two types: conventional, in which the activity can be explained by the mainstream theory of superconductivity, and unconventional, where it can\u2019t.|bibcode=2018Natur.555..151G}}</ref>\n\n=== By critical temperature ===\nA superconductor is generally considered ''[[high-temperature superconductivity|high-temperature]]'' if it reaches a superconducting state above a temperature of 30 K;<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Grant|first=Paul Michael|date=2011|title=The great quantum conundrum|journal=Nature|publisher=Nature Publishing Group, a division of Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Alex M\u00fcller]].<ref name=\"Bednorz\" /> It may also reference materials that transition to superconductivity when cooled using [[liquid nitrogen]] \u2013 that is, at only ''T<sub>c</sub>''&nbsp;> 77&nbsp;K, although this is generally used only to emphasize that [[liquid nitrogen]] coolant is sufficient. Low temperature superconductors refer to materials with a critical temperature below 30 K. One exception to this rule is the [[Iron-based superconductor|iron pnictide]] group of superconductors which display behaviour and properties typical of high temperature superconductors, yet some of the group have critical temperatures below 30K.\n\n=== By material ===\nSuperconductor material classes include [[chemical element]]s (e.g. [[mercury (element)|mercury]] or [[lead]]), [[alloy]]s (such as [[niobium\u2013titanium]], [[germanium\u2013niobium]], and [[niobium nitride]]), [[ceramic]]s ([[YBCO]] and [[magnesium diboride]]), [[Iron-based superconductor|superconducting pnictides]] (like fluorine-doped LaOFeAs) or [[organic superconductor]]s ([[fullerene]]s and [[carbon nanotube]]s; though perhaps these examples should be included among the chemical elements, as they are composed entirely of [[carbon]]).\n\n== Elementary properties of superconductors ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2018}}<!--many paragraphs have no citations-->\nMost of the physical properties of superconductors vary from material to material, such as the [[heat capacity]] and the critical temperature, critical field, and critical current density at which superconductivity is destroyed.\n\nOn the other hand, there is a class of properties that are independent of the underlying material. For instance, all superconductors have ''exactly'' zero resistivity to low applied currents when there is no magnetic field present or if the applied field does not exceed a critical value. The existence of these \"universal\" properties implies that superconductivity is a [[phase (matter)|thermodynamic phase]], and thus possesses certain distinguishing properties which are largely independent of microscopic details.\n\n=== Zero electrical DC resistance ===\n[[File:CERN-cables-p1030764.jpg|thumb|Electric cables for accelerators at [[CERN]]. Both the massive and slim cables are rated for 12,500 [[amperes|A]]. ''Top:'' regular cables for [[LEP]]; ''bottom:'' superconductor-based cables for the [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]]]]\n[[File:Cross section of preform superconductor cable.jpg|thumb|Cross section of a preform superconductor rod from abandoned [[Superconducting Super Collider|Texas Superconducting Super Collider (SSC)]].]]\nThe simplest method to measure the [[electrical resistance]] of a sample of some material is to place it in an [[electrical circuit]] in series with a [[current source]] ''I'' and measure the resulting [[voltage]] ''V'' across the sample. The resistance of the sample is given by [[Ohm's law]] as ''R&nbsp;=&nbsp;V&nbsp;/&nbsp;I''. If the voltage is zero, this means that the resistance is zero.\n\nSuperconductors are also able to maintain a current with no applied voltage whatsoever, a property exploited in [[Superconducting magnet|superconducting electromagnets]] such as those found in [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] machines. Experiments have demonstrated that currents in superconducting coils can persist for years without any measurable degradation. Experimental evidence points to a current lifetime of at least 100,000 years. Theoretical estimates for the lifetime of a persistent current can exceed the estimated lifetime of the [[universe]], depending on the wire geometry and the temperature.<ref name=\"Gallop\" /> In practice, currents injected in superconducting coils have persisted for more than 23 years (as in August 2018) in superconducting [http://www.astro.oma.be/en/world-record-in-the-underground-laboratory-of-membach/ gravimeters].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Van Camp|first=Michel|last2=Francis|first2=Olivier|last3=Lecocq|first3=Thomas|title=Recording Belgium's Gravitational History|journal=Eos|language=en-US|volume=98|doi=10.1029/2017eo089743|year=2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Van Camp|first=Michel|last2=de Viron|first2=Olivier|last3=Watlet|first3=Arnaud|last4=Meurers|first4=Bruno|last5=Francis|first5=Olivier|last6=Caudron|first6=Corentin|title=Geophysics From Terrestrial Time-Variable Gravity Measurements|journal=Reviews of Geophysics|volume=55|issue=4|language=en|pages=2017RG000566|doi=10.1002/2017rg000566|issn=1944-9208|bibcode=2017RvGeo..55..938V|year=2017}}</ref> In such instruments, the measurement principle is based on the monitoring of the levitation of a superconducting niobium sphere with a mass of 4 grams.\n\nIn a normal conductor, an electric current may be visualized as a fluid of [[electron]]s moving across a heavy [[ion]]ic lattice. The electrons are constantly colliding with the ions in the lattice, and during each collision some of the [[energy]] carried by the current is absorbed by the lattice and converted into [[heat]], which is essentially the vibrational [[kinetic energy]] of the lattice ions. As a result, the energy carried by the current is constantly being dissipated. This is the phenomenon of electrical resistance and [[Joule heating]].\n\nThe situation is different in a superconductor. In a conventional superconductor, the electronic fluid cannot be resolved into individual electrons. Instead, it consists of bound ''pairs'' of electrons known as [[Cooper pair]]s. This pairing is caused by an attractive force between electrons from the exchange of [[phonon]]s. Due to [[quantum mechanics]], the [[energy spectrum]] of this Cooper pair fluid possesses an ''[[energy gap]]'', meaning there is a minimum amount of energy \u0394''E'' that must be supplied in order to excite the fluid. Therefore, if \u0394''E'' is larger than the [[thermal energy]] of the lattice, given by ''kT'', where ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]] and ''T'' is the [[temperature]], the fluid will not be scattered by the lattice.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tinkham |first1=Michael |title=Introduction to Superconductivity |date=1996 |publisher=Dover Publications, INC |location=Mineola, New York |isbn=0486435032 |page=8}}</ref> The Cooper pair fluid is thus a [[superfluid]], meaning it can flow without energy dissipation.\n\nIn a class of superconductors known as [[type II superconductor]]s, including all known [[high-temperature superconductor]]s, an extremely low but nonzero resistivity appears at temperatures not too far below the nominal superconducting transition when an electric current is applied in conjunction with a strong magnetic field, which may be caused by the electric current. This is due to the motion of [[Abrikosov vortex|magnetic vortices]] in the electronic superfluid, which dissipates some of the energy carried by the current. If the current is sufficiently small, the vortices are stationary, and the resistivity vanishes. The resistance due to this effect is tiny compared with that of non-superconducting materials, but must be taken into account in sensitive experiments. However, as the temperature decreases far enough below the nominal superconducting transition, these vortices can become frozen into a disordered but stationary phase known as a \"vortex glass\". Below this vortex glass transition temperature, the resistance of the material becomes truly zero.\n\n===  Phase transition {{anchor|Superconducting phase transition}} ===\n[[File:Cvandrhovst.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Behavior of heat capacity (c<sub>v</sub>, blue) and resistivity (\u03c1, green) at the superconducting phase transition]]\nIn superconducting materials, the characteristics of superconductivity appear when the [[temperature]] ''T'' is lowered below a critical temperature ''T''<sub>c</sub>. The value of this critical temperature varies from material to material. Conventional superconductors usually have critical temperatures ranging from around 20&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] to less than 1&nbsp;K. Solid [[mercury (element)|mercury]], for example, has a critical temperature of 4.2&nbsp;K. As of 2015, the highest critical temperature found for a conventional superconductor is 203K for H<sub>2</sub>S, although high pressures of approximately 90 gigapascals were required.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Drozdov|first1=A|last2=Eremets|first2=M|last3=Troyan|first3=I|last4=Ksenofontov|first4=V|title=Conventional superconductivity at 203 kelvin at high pressures in the sulfur hydride system|journal=Nature|date=17 August 2015|volume=525|issue=2\u20133|pages=73\u201376|doi=10.1038/nature14964|pmid=11369082|arxiv=1506.08190|bibcode=2015Natur.525...73D}}</ref> [[Cuprate superconductor]]s can have much higher critical temperatures: [[YBCO|YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>]], one of the first cuprate superconductors to be discovered, has a critical temperature above 90&nbsp;K, and mercury-based cuprates have been found with critical temperatures in excess of 130&nbsp;K. The basic physical mechanism responsible for the high critical temperature is not yet clear. However, it is clear that a two-electron pairing is involved, although the nature of the pairing (<math>s</math> wave vs. <math>d</math> wave) remains controversial.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tinkham |first1=Michael |title=Introduction to Superconductivity |date=1996 |publisher=Dover Publications, INC |location=Mineola, New York |isbn=0486435032 |page=16}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, at a fixed temperature below the critical temperature, superconducting materials cease to superconduct when an external [[magnetic field]] is applied which is greater than the ''critical magnetic field''. This is because the [[Gibbs free energy]] of the superconducting phase increases quadratically with the magnetic field while the free energy of the normal phase is roughly independent of the magnetic field. If the material superconducts in the absence of a field, then the superconducting phase free energy is lower than that of the normal phase and so for some finite value of the magnetic field (proportional to the square root of the difference of the free energies at zero magnetic field) the two free energies will be equal and a phase transition to the normal phase will occur. More generally, a higher temperature and a stronger magnetic field lead to a smaller fraction of electrons that are superconducting and consequently to a longer [[London penetration depth]] of external magnetic fields and currents. The penetration depth becomes infinite at the phase transition.\n\nThe onset of superconductivity is accompanied by abrupt changes in various physical properties, which is the hallmark of a [[phase transition]]. For example, the electronic [[heat capacity]] is proportional to the temperature in the normal (non-superconducting) regime. At the superconducting transition, it suffers a discontinuous jump and thereafter ceases to be linear. At low temperatures, it varies instead as ''e''<sup>\u2212\u03b1/''T''</sup> for some constant, \u03b1. This exponential behavior is one of the pieces of evidence for the existence of the [[energy gap]].\n\nThe [[Second-order transition|order]] of the superconducting [[phase transition#Order parameters|phase transition]] was long a matter of debate. Experiments indicate that the transition is second-order, meaning there is no [[latent heat]]. However, in the presence of an external magnetic field there is latent heat, because the superconducting phase has a lower entropy below the critical temperature than the normal phase. It has been experimentally demonstrated<ref>{{cite journal\n |author = R. L.

In the 1980s it was shown theoretically with the help of a [[disorder field|disorder field theory]], in which the [[vortex line]]s of the superconductor play a major role, that the transition is of second order within the [[Type II superconductor|type II]] regime and of first order (i.e., [[latent heat]]) within the [[Type I superconductor|type I]] regime, and that the two regions are separated by a [[tricritical point]].<ref>{{cite journal\n | author = H.

The Meissner effect does not cause the field to be completely ejected but instead the field penetrates the superconductor but only to a very small distance, characterized by a parameter&nbsp;''\u03bb'', called the [[London penetration depth]], decaying exponentially to zero within the bulk of the material. The [[Meissner effect]] is a defining characteristic of superconductivity. For most superconductors, the London penetration depth is on the order of 100&nbsp;nm.\n\nThe Meissner effect is sometimes confused with the kind of [[diamagnetism]] one would expect in a perfect electrical conductor: according to [[Lenz's law]], when a ''changing'' magnetic field is applied to a conductor, it will induce an electric current in the conductor that creates an opposing magnetic field. In a perfect conductor, an arbitrarily large current can be induced, and the resulting magnetic field exactly cancels the applied field.\n\nThe Meissner effect is distinct from this\u2014it is the spontaneous expulsion which occurs during transition to superconductivity. Suppose we have a material in its normal state, containing a constant internal magnetic field. When the material is cooled below the critical temperature, we would observe the abrupt expulsion of the internal magnetic field, which we would not expect based on Lenz's law.\n\nThe Meissner effect was given a phenomenological explanation by the brothers [[Fritz London|Fritz]] and [[Heinz London]], who showed that the electromagnetic [[thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] in a superconductor is minimized provided\n\n:<math> \\nabla^2\\mathbf{H} = \\lambda^{-2} \\mathbf{H}\\, </math>\n\nwhere '''H''' is the magnetic field and \u03bb is the [[London penetration depth]].\n\nThis equation, which is known as the [[London equation]], predicts that the magnetic field in a superconductor [[exponential decay|decays exponentially]] from whatever value it possesses at the surface.\n\nA superconductor with little or no magnetic field within it is said to be in the Meissner state. The Meissner state breaks down when the applied magnetic field is too large. Superconductors can be divided into two classes according to how this breakdown occurs. In [[Type I superconductor]]s, superconductivity is abruptly destroyed when the strength of the applied field rises above a critical value ''H<sub>c</sub>''.

In [[Type II superconductor]]s, raising the applied field past a critical value ''H''<sub>''c''1</sub> leads to a mixed state (also known as the vortex state) in which an increasing amount of [[magnetic flux]] penetrates the material, but there remains no resistance to the flow of electric current as long as the current is not too large. At a second critical field strength ''H''<sub>''c''2</sub>, superconductivity is destroyed. The mixed state is actually caused by vortices in the electronic superfluid, sometimes called [[fluxon]]s because the flux carried by these vortices is [[quantum|quantized]]. Most pure [[chemical element|elemental]] superconductors, except [[niobium]] and [[carbon nanotube]]s, are Type&nbsp;I, while almost all impure and compound superconductors are Type&nbsp;II.\n\n=== London moment ===\nConversely, a spinning superconductor generates a magnetic field, precisely aligned with the spin axis. The effect, the [[London moment]], was put to good use in [[Gravity Probe B|Gravity Probe&nbsp;B]]. This experiment measured the magnetic fields of four superconducting gyroscopes to determine their spin axes. This was critical to the experiment since it is one of the few ways to accurately determine the spin axis of an otherwise featureless sphere.\n\n{{anchor|Theories of superconductivity}}\n\n== History of superconductivity ==\n[[File:Ehrenfest Lorentz Bohr Kamerlingh Onnes.jpg|thumb|Heike Kamerlingh Onnes (right), the discoverer of superconductivity.

They are used in [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]]/[[NMR]] machines, [[mass spectrometer]]s, the beam-steering magnets used in [[particle accelerator]]s and plasma confining magnets in some [[tokamaks]]. They can also be used for magnetic separation, where weakly magnetic particles are extracted from a background of less or non-magnetic particles, as in the [[pigment]] industries. They can also be used in large wind turbines to overcome the restrictions imposed by high electrical currents, with an industrial grade 3.6 megawatt superconducting windmill generator having been tested successfully in Denmark.<ref>Design and in-field testing of the world\u2019s first ReBCO rotor for a 3.6 MW wind generator\u201d by Anne Bergen, Rasmus Andersen, Markus Bauer, Hermann Boy, Marcel ter Brake, Patrick Brutsaert, Carsten B\u00fchrer, Marc Dhall\u00e9, Jesper Hansen and Herman ten Kate, 25 October 2019, Superconductor Science and Technology.</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, superconductors were used to build experimental digital computers using [[cryotron]] switches. More recently, superconductors have been used to make [[digital circuit]]s based on [[rapid single flux quantum]] technology and [[RF and microwave filter]]s for [[mobile phone]] base stations.\n\nSuperconductors are used to build [[Josephson junction]]s which are the building blocks of [[SQUID]]s (superconducting quantum interference devices), the most sensitive [[magnetometer]]s known. SQUIDs are used in [[scanning SQUID microscope]]s and [[magnetoencephalography]]. Series of Josephson devices are used to realize the [[International System of Units|SI]] [[volt]]. Depending on the particular mode of operation, a [[superconductor\u2013insulator\u2013superconductor]] Josephson junction can be used as a photon [[detector]] or as a [[Electronic mixer|mixer]]. The large resistance change at the transition from the normal- to the superconducting state is used to build thermometers in cryogenic [[calorimeter|micro-calorimeter]] photon [[detector]]s. The same effect is used in ultrasensitive [[bolometer]]s made from superconducting materials.\n\nOther early markets are arising where the relative efficiency, size and weight advantages of devices based on [[high-temperature superconductivity]] outweigh the additional costs involved. For example, in [[wind turbine]]s the lower weight and volume of superconducting generators could lead to savings in construction and tower costs, offsetting the higher costs for the generator and lowering the total [[levelized cost of electricity]] (LCOE).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Islam | year = 2014 | title = A review of offshore wind turbine nacelle: Technical challenges, and research and developmental trends. | url = http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2081&context=eispapers1| journal = [[Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews]] | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 161\u2013176 | doi = 10.1016/j.rser.2014.01.085 |display-authors=etal| hdl = 10453/33256 }}</ref>\n\nPromising future applications include high-performance [[smart grid]], [[electric power transmission]], [[transformer]]s, [[SMES|power storage devices]], [[electric motor]]s (e.g. for vehicle propulsion, as in [[vactrain]]s or [[maglev train]]s), [[magnetic levitation device]]s, [[fault current limiter]]s, enhancing spintronic devices with superconducting materials,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Linder|first1=Jacob|last2=Robinson|first2=Jason W.

It is a main ingredient in [[kibbeh]] and, soaked but not cooked, in [[tabbouleh]] salad. It is often used where [[rice]] or [[couscous]] could be used. In Indian and Pakistani cuisine, bulgur is often used as a cereal to make a porridge with milk and sugar, or a savory porridge with vegetables and spices. It can be used to accompany other dishes in the same way as pasta or rice; it may be mistaken for rice because it has a similar appearance, although the texture is different.\n\nArmenians prepare bulgur as a pilaf in chicken stock, with or without sauteed noodles, or cooked with tomatoes, onions, herbs and red pepper. The fine grind is used for making [[eech]], a bulgur salad similar to tabbouleh, prepared with tomato paste, fresh tomatoes, cucumbers, parsley, olive oil, and other salad ingredients to personal taste.

It is a main ingredient in [[kibbeh]] and, soaked but not cooked, in [[tabbouleh]] salad. It is often used where [[rice]] or [[couscous]] could be used. In Indian and Pakistani cuisine, bulgur is often used as a cereal to make a porridge with milk and sugar, or a savory porridge with vegetables and spices. It can be used to accompany other dishes in the same way as pasta or rice; it may be mistaken for rice because it has a similar appearance, although the texture is different.\n\nArmenians prepare bulgur as a pilaf in chicken stock, with or without sauteed noodles, or cooked with tomatoes, onions, herbs and red pepper.

John V's reign saw the rise of [[Portugal]] and its monarchy to new levels of prosperity, wealth, and prestige among European courts.{{sfn|Carmo Reis, Vol V}}\n\nJohn V's reign saw an enormous influx of gold into the coffers of the royal treasury, supplied largely by the [[royal fifth]] (a tax on precious metals) that was received from the [[Portuguese empire|Portuguese colonies]] of [[State of Brazil|Brazil]] and [[State of Maranh\u00e3o (colonial)|Maranh\u00e3o]]. John spent lavishly on ambitious architectural works, most notably [[Mafra National Palace|Mafra Palace]], and on commissions and additions for his sizable art and literary collections. Owing to his craving for international diplomatic recognition, John also spent large sums on the embassies he sent to the courts of Europe, the most famous being those he sent to Paris in 1715 and Rome in 1716.\n\nDisregarding traditional Portuguese institutions of governance, John V ruled as an [[absolute monarch]]. As a continuation of a Braganza dynasty policy that stressed the importance of relations with Europe, John's reign was marked by numerous interventions into the affairs of other European states, most notably as part of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. On the imperial front, John V pursued an expansionist policy, with significant territorial gains in [[Portuguese India]] and [[Portuguese America]].\n\nJohn V was a very pious man who devoted large parts of his day to prayer and religious study. He rewarded his long-awaited recognition as a lawful monarch by [[Pope Benedict XIV]] with a fervent devotion to the [[Catholic Church]] and some very large donations to the [[Holy See]]. The Pope granted John V the style \"[[Most Faithful Majesty]],\" which appealed to him greatly. However, John's relationship with the [[papacy]] varied at different periods in his reign; there were both close relations and conflicts at different times during the reigns of five different popes.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=318-321}}\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Le Prince de Bresil, fils ain\u00e9 de Pierre 2\u00ba. Roy de Portugal, Paris, ca. 1706.png|thumb|left|''John, [[Prince of Brazil]], eldest son of Pedro II of Portugal''; Berey, c. 1706.]]\nJohn was born on 22 October 1689 at [[Ribeira Palace]]{{sfn|Caetano de Sousa, Vol VIII|p=1}} in [[Lisbon]] to King [[Peter II of Portugal|Peter&nbsp;II]] and Queen [[Maria Sophia of Neuburg]]. He was baptized on November 19 at the Royal Palace Chapel and given the full name John Francis Anthony Joseph Benedict Bernard (''Jo\u00e3o Francisco Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Bento Bernardo'').{{sfn|Caetano de Sousa, Vol VIII|p=2}} John was not his father's first son; he had an older brother, [[Jo\u00e3o, Prince of Brazil|John]], who died a year before John's birth, thus the court was overjoyed to have a new male heir to the kingdom.\n\nUpon his baptism, John was not given the traditional titles of the heir apparent to the Portuguese throne, [[Prince of Brazil]] and [[Duke of Braganza]], but merely the default title [[Infante of Portugal]]. This was intended as a sign of respect for his elder brother's death, which had happened only months before.\n\n=== Education ===\nJohn had a stimulating upbringing surrounded by some of the most brilliant minds of Europe at the time. It was agreed by the court that John's care as a child was to be strictly run by women only, a custom of the Portuguese court, and the [[Portuguese nobility]] as a whole.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=19}} John's governess (who was later the governess for all of the sons of Pedro II) was Maria de Lencastre, the Marquise of Unh\u00e3o, who was given that position more for her beauty and status than for her suitability as a child care giver.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=19}}\n\nThe policies that John's father had pursued made the Portuguese court wealthy, the national economy stable, and the imperial military strong. This made a richly varied and interesting childhood possible for John. As a child, he was under the tutelage and heavy influence of the [[Jesuit]] Fathers Francisco da Cruz, Jo\u00e3o Seco, and Lu\u00eds Gonzaga.{{sfn|Ver\u00edssimo Serr\u00e3o, Vol V|p=234}} Father Lu\u00eds Gonzaga was in charge of the education of all of King Pedro's children; he taught them military education, politics, astronomy, nautical studies, mathematics, and history. {{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=21}} As the prince grew up, he was mentored in political affairs by [[Lu\u00eds da Cunha]], a prominent Portuguese diplomat.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=21}}\n\n=== Maturity ===\n[[File:Joao V - Principe.jpg|thumb|right|''John, [[Duke of Braganza]]''; c. 1706. John aged around 17 years.]]\nWhen John reached age seven, his father determined that his eldest sons were sufficiently educated in basic subjects and decided to take over supervision of their instruction himself, though his interest in mentoring them quickly faded.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=22}} This was formalised when he and his brother [[Francisco, Duke of Beja]], were admitted into the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]] on 7 April 1696. {{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=21}} Later that year, the king finally decided to confer on John the titles of the heir apparent, namely [[Prince of Brazil]] and [[Duke of Braganza]]. On 1 December 1696, on the anniversary of the [[Portuguese Restoration War]] of 1640, a grand ceremony was held in which John was invested with his titles. {{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=21}} The ceremony involved the placing of a large ermine and red velvet mantle on his shoulders, as well as the adornment of his person with various jewels and royal regalia.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=21}}\n\nJust over a month before John's tenth birthday in 1699, his mother Queen Maria Sofia died at the age of 33.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=20}} This caused John to retreat from court and become depressed for many months.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=20}} [[Catherine of Braganza]], his aunt and the former [[List of English consorts|Queen consort of England]], [[List of Scottish consorts|Scotland]], [[List of Irish consorts|and Ireland]], then took control of his education.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=20}} She resided in the palace she had built, [[Bemposta Palace]], and remained John's main tutor and female role model until her death in 1705.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=20}}\n\nIn April 1700, John fell terribly ill; it was assumed that he was on his death bed.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=21}} Fearing his imminent demise, he asked for his [[last rites]] and confessed his sins.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=21}} To everyone's surprise, he rallied and soon returned to his normal activities,{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=21}} his complete recovery being considered a miracle by the court.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=21}}\n\nThe death of John's sister Teresa Maria in February 1704, greatly saddened him. It caused him to avoid appearing at court for some months and to estrange himself from his father, who favoured John's younger brother, [[Manuel, Count of Our\u00e9m]].{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=22}} During this time, much gossip was spread and worries arose about whether John would ever recover from his depression. In May of that year, he eventually returned to the court and reconciled with the king, saying that his [[saudade]]s for his sister would not get in the way of his performing his duty to the king.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=22}}\n\n== Succession ==\n[[File:Jo\u00e3o V, \u00f3leo sobre tela, Portugal, s\u00e9culo XVIII.jpg|thumb|left|''Portrait of King John V with a Crown''; 1707. John aged 18 years.]]\nIn early December 1706, Pedro II moved himself to the Royal Quinta in Alc\u00e2ntara, as he was growing ill and needed space from the court.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=23}} On the fifth of that month, the king caught a high fever, and the court doctors met to examine him fully.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=23}} They determined his health was greatly deteriorating.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=23}} The next day, Pedro II called all of his children to his bedside and told them of his coming demise. He appointed John as prince [[regent]] of the kingdom and asked that all of his children follow John's wishes.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=24}} Although he appointed John the prince regent, Pedro II still favoured his youngest son Manuel, and the king gave Manuel a special gift that no other child received.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=23}}\n\n=== Acclamation ===\nKing Pedro II died in his sleep on 9 December 1706.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=24}} Following his death, [[Ribeira Palace]] was redecorated as a reflection of the mourning. On the fa\u00e7ade towards the [[Terreiro do Pa\u00e7o]], large black banners were hung from the windows for this purpose.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=26}} A month later, the time was declared to be appropriate for John to be acclaimed king. Preparations for John's acclamation had already been started and once allowed, the royal palace was redecorated; the black banners were replaced with red ones, and fruit wreaths were hung throughout all of the palace.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=26}}\n\nOn the day of John's acclamation, 1 January 1707, his new throne was placed on the balcony of the ''Torre do Rei'' (Tower of the King) of Ribeira Palace.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=26}} Specially-made tapestries illustrating the allegories of Justice and Prudence were hung high above the Terreiro do Pa\u00e7o to remind the public that these were the traits their king would have.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=26}} Once John sat down on his throne, wreaths made of gold were laid around the throne and balcony.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=26}}  Wearing his [[Cross of the Order of Christ]], and with the [[Portuguese Crown Jewels]] beside him, and not on him, as was the Portuguese royal custom, John was acclaimed \"His Majesty, by the Grace of God, King of Portugal and the Algarves, before and beyond the sea in Africa, Lord of Guinea and of Conquest, Navigation, and Commerce of Ethiopia, Arabia, Persia, and India, our Lord, John, the fifth of that name in the table of the Kings of Portugal.\"\n\nJohn was now king of an empire that stretched four continents. He was also the head of state of a kingdom that was at [[War of the Spanish Succession|war with Spain and France]].{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=26}} His first regnal act was to renew Portugal's membership in the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|League of Augsburg]] and continue in the war alongside the [[Kingdom of England|England]] and the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburgs]].{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=26}} Portugal quickly supplied more troops to aid her allies in the war. This new level of Portuguese involvement allowed John's general, [[Ant\u00f3nio Lu\u00eds de Sousa, Marquis of Minas]], to capture Madrid on 28 June 1706. While Portugal put vast resources into the war, contrary to John's predecessors, who avoided conflicts in Europe, activity in the war soon lost the interest of the king, who had more pressing affairs to attend to.\n\n=== Marriage ===\n[[File:Desembarque da Rainha D.

XVIII.png|thumb|right|''The Arrival of [[Maria Anna of Austria]] in Lisbon''; Gottfried Stein, c. 1708.]]\nDuring his life, Pedro II had worked a long time to secure John a marriage with an Austrian [[archduchess]] in order to guarantee Portugal's alliance with the Habsburgs.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=28}} John continued these negotiations and finally succeeded in negotiating a deal. On 27 June 1707, Fern\u00e3o Teles da Silva, Count of Vilar Maior, signed a marriage contract with Holy Emperor [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]] that made official a match between John and the emperor's sister, the Archduchess [[Maria Anna of Austria]].{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=28}} The contract also set the archduchess's dowry at 100,000 [[Austrian krone|crowns]], a vast sum for the day.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=28}}\n\nThe armada that Portugal sent to escort Maria Anna from the [[Lower Countries]] to [[Lisbon]] arrived in the [[Tagus river]] estuary on 26 October 1708.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=28}} The flagship, in which Maria Anna travelled, berthed at the docks of the private garden of Ribeira Palace, where John and a party of the kingdom's richest and most powerful nobles met the new queen for the first time.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=28}} The marriage celebrations lasted until 27 December;{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=30}} they were sumptuous and very costly.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=28}}\n\nBy late 1710, John and Maria Anna had not produced an heir to the throne. It had been two years since the couple had been married, and the court was starting to question the future of the [[House of Braganza]]. In early 1711, the king met with [[Franciscan]] Cardinal Nuno da Cunha e Ata\u00edde, High Inquisitor of the [[Portuguese Inquisition]], who told him that if he promised God to build a Franciscan convent in [[Mafra, Portugal|Mafra]], God would deliver his long desired heir. Accordingly, John promised that if Maria Anna became pregnant before the end of 1711, he would build a Franciscan convent in Mafra.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ipmuseus.pt/pt-PT/museus_palacios/ContentDetail.aspx?id=1125 |title=Pal\u00e1cio Nacional de Mafra |author=Instituto dos Museus e da Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o |date=22 July 2011 |work=Museus e Pal\u00e1cios |accessdate=5 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511085547/http://www.ipmuseus.pt/pt-PT/museus_palacios/ContentDetail.aspx?id=1125 |archivedate=11 May 2012 }}</ref>  John's wish would come true later that year, when Maria Anna fulfilled her duty as queen  and gave birth to the [[Barbara of Portugal|Infanta Maria Barbara of Braganza]] on 4 December 1711.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=42}}\n\nJohn and Maria Anna had a successful marriage, but lived largely separate lives. Maria Anna devoted herself to preserving the decorum of the royal court and her own religious interests, while John concerned himself with whatever pleased him at the moment.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=33}} John kept many mistresses throughout his royal career, including Filipa de Noronha, [[Paula de Odivelas]], Lu\u00edsa In\u00eas Ant\u00f3nia Machado Monteiro, Madalena M\u00e1xima de Miranda, In\u00e1cia Rosa de T\u00e1vora, and [[Luisa Clara de Portugal |Lu\u00edsa Clara de Portugal]].\n\n=== Offspring ===\n[[File:Bapt\u00eame du prince de Portugal sous le nom de Pierre III, prince du Br\u00e9sil - Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France.png|thumb|left|250px|''The Royal Family at the Baptism of [[Pedro, Prince of Brazil]]''; German,  c. 1712.]]\nMaria Barbara's birth was followed by the birth of [[Pedro, Prince of Brazil]], on 19 October 1712, which temporarily gave John a male heir. Prince Pedro's death on 29 October 1714 greatly saddened him, but he took solace in the fact that his son, the [[Joseph I of Portugal|Infante Jos\u00e9]] (now Prince Jos\u00e9), had been born on June 6 earlier that same year. Following the birth of Prince Jos\u00e9, John and Maria Anna would have three more children: [[Infante Carlos of Portugal|Infante Carlos]], born 2 May 1716, [[Pedro III of Portugal|Infante Pedro]], born 5 July 1717, and [[Infante Alexandre of Portugal|Infante Alexandre]], born 24 September 1723.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=42}} Of the last three infantes, only two would survive to adulthood, Infante Carlos and Infante Pedro; only one would continue the Braganza line: Infante Pedro.\n\nJohn's children were trained rigorously growing up. His plan was to have an intelligent son who could take his place as king, a strategically married daughter, and well-prepared statesmen sons; but he would achieve only part of his goal. From her birth, Infanta Maria Barbara's marriage had been closely arranged and monitored by John. When the engagement of [[Mariana Victoria of Spain]] to [[Louis XV of France]] was nullified, John proposed Infanta Maria Barbara as a possible bride for Louis XV, but in the end she was refused.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=44}} John still managed to gain something from the dissolution of the engagement between Louis XV and Mariana Victoria, i.e., a wife for his son Prince Jos\u00e9 and a husband for Infanta Maria Barbara, Mariana Victoria's older brother [[Ferdinand VI of Spain|Fernando, Prince of Asturias]]. Negotiations between Portugal and Spain began in 1725, and four years later John's eldest children would be matched with their spouses-to-be.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=45}} The princesses Maria Barbara and Mariana Victoria were exchanged at a ceremony, called the Exchange of the Princesses (''Troca das Princesas''), held on the [[Caia River]] on 19 January 1729.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=45}} Prince Jos\u00e9 married Mariana Victoria on 19 January 1729 in [[Elvas]], and Infanta Maria Barbara married Prince Fernando on 20 January 1729 in [[Badajoz]].{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=47}}\n[[File:D.

Infante Alexandre died at the age of five, and Infante Carlos died at the age of twenty without any marriage proposals or children.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=54}} Only Infante Pedro would live long enough to marry, but John did not live long enough to see it. Infante Pedro married the daughter of his older brother King [[Joseph I of Portugal|Jos\u00e9 I]], Princess Maria Francisca, Princess of Brazil, on 6 June 1760.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=55}} When Princess Maria became Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]] upon the death of her father, King Jos\u00e9 I (John's son), Prince Pedro became King Pedro III, following Portuguese royal law that if the consort of a queen regnant produced children with the queen regnant, he would become king of Portugal ''[[jure uxoris]]''.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=55}}\n\nJohn fathered at least four children from various extramarital affairs: [[Ant\u00f3nio of Braganza, Child of Palhav\u00e3|Ant\u00f3nio of Braganza]], by Lu\u00edsa In\u00eas Ant\u00f3nia Machado Monteiro, [[Gaspar of Braganza, Archbishop of Braga]], by Madalena M\u00e1xima de Miranda, [[Jos\u00e9 of Braganza, High Inquisitor of Portugal]], by [[Paula de Odivelas]], and [[Maria Rita of Braganza]], by Lu\u00edsa Clara de Portugal. Out of his four illegitimate children, the three males were all recognized as John's sons and were collectively known as the [[Children of Palhav\u00e3]], after the Palace of Palhav\u00e3 that belonged to [[Lu\u00eds Carlos In\u00e1cio Xavier de Meneses, 1st Marquis of Louri\u00e7al]], where they lived at John's expense.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=55}} The Children of Palhav\u00e3 received educations worthy of nobility and went on to become noteworthy members of the clergy.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=55-57}}  Maria Rita was never officially recognized as his daughter, but he informally arranged for her life at the Convent of Santos and managed her expenses.{{sfn|Pimentel|p=97}} The husband of Maria Rita's mother, Jorge de Meneses, attempted to stop John's actions for Maria Rita, but the king had him exiled to Spain and then to England.{{sfn|Pimentel|p=98}}\n\n== Regnal politics ==\nWhen John became king, he chose to reign as an [[absolute monarchy|absolute monarch]]. Notably, he  never convened the [[Portuguese Cortes]], the ancient parliament of the [[three estates]] in Portugal, and actively ignored meetings of the Council of State.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=177}} However, John did not act by himself when making decisions; rather, he frequently consulted a close circle of well-informed advisers and held weekly intimate audiences with members of all three estates, which he preferred to larger institutions, such as the Cortes and the Council of State, which he viewed as incompetent and bloated.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=177}} The Count of Povolide remarked on John's governance style, stating that ''\"he established a predominance of personal consultation over institutional consultation.\"''{{sfn|Conde de Povolide|p=350}}\n\n=== His Majesty's Government ===\n[[File:Diogo de Mendon\u00e7a Corte Real.jpg|thumb|right|D. [[Diogo de Mendon\u00e7a Corte-Real]], [[Prime Minister of Portugal|Secretary of State of the Kingdom]].]]\nThe highest position in the king's government was that of [[Prime Minister of Portugal|Secretary of State of Portugal]], the equivalent of a modern-day prime minister. This position was always filled by a [[favourite]] of John, the most notable one [[Diogo de Mendon\u00e7a Corte-Real]], whom the king consulted with on every matter, to such a degree that it often appeared that he was the king's only minister.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=179}} When John became king, he inherited a powerful and large Council of State made up of numerous bishops, nobles, and bureaucrats, which was charged with being the utmost consultory body to the king, as it was during the reign of John's father.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=182}} However, John's dislike of institutions and consultative bodies led him to cease convening the council formally, leading the prominent politician and diplomat [[Lu\u00eds da Cunha]] to refer to the king as a despot and his government as absolutist.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=183}}\n\nAlthough the Council of State was never convened, several of its members were nonetheless close advisers to the king.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=179}} Alongside Diogo de Mendon\u00e7a Corte-Real, Cardinal Jo\u00e3o da Mota e Silva and High-Inquisitor Nuno da Cunha e Ata\u00edde were close advisers to the king, the former eventually substituting Mendon\u00e7a Corte-Real as Secretary of State when he died in 1736.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=179}}{{Ref|Lisboa, Reis Miranda, Olival|p=54}} Though he disbanded most institutions, John notably maintained the Junta of the Three Estates, a governing [[Totalitarianism|junta]] created by John's grandfather, King [[John IV of Portugal|John IV]], which managed the finances and maintenance of military installations, troop raising, and taxation related to defense.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=184}} Having engaged in multiple conflicts throughout his reign, both in Europe and his empire, John understood the necessity of the junta and carefully picked its members, only selecting those deemed the most knowledgeable and competent.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=184}} Similarly, John maintained the Council of the Treasury, which managed the finances of Portugal and its empire, including tax collection and budget accounting for the majority of Portugal's organizations (except the military), and exerted authority over the [[Casa da \u00cdndia]], the Royal Mint, and the custom houses across Portuguese territory.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=186-188}}\n\n=== European relations ===\n[[File:Portugal no m\u00eas de Julho de Dois Mil e Catorze P7130512 (14548788257).jpg|thumb|left|The ''Coche dos Oceanos'' (Oceans Carriage) used in the [[Royal Entry|triumphal entry]] of the 1716 Portuguese envoy to Rome.]]\nWhen John ascended the throne, he found himself entangled in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], as King Pedro II had signed the [[Methuen Treaty]] in 1703, which aligned Portugal to the Grand Alliance against the [[House of Bourbon]] and allowed Grand Alliance forces to launch their invasion of Spain from Portugal.{{sfn|Ver\u00edssimo Serr\u00e3o, Vol V|p=229}} Only months after assuming the throne, John saw his forces overwhelmingly defeated in at the [[Battle of Almansa]], a defeat that jeopardized Portuguese forces in Spain and the outcome of the war.{{sfn|Francis|p=249}} Portuguese forces continued to fight alongside the Grand Alliance until agreeing to an armistice with Spain and France on 8 November 1712.{{sfn|Francis|p=249-350}}{{sfn|Lynn|p=354\u2013355}}{{sfn|Lynn|p=361-362}} The war finally came to an end in 1713 with the signing of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], whereby Portugal regained possession of territories conquered by the Bourbon coalition and acquired new territories in South America.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=82}}\n\nWith the War of the Spanish Succession ended, John could re-establish relations with the courts of Europe. His first grand act of diplomacy was the dispatch of [[Lu\u00eds Manuel da C\u00e2mara, 3rd Count of Ribeira Grande]], as his ambassador to the court of [[Louis XIV of France]], in early August 1715.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=308-310}} The grandson of [[Fran\u00e7ois, Prince of Soubise]], and cousin of [[Hercule M\u00e9riadec, Prince of Gu\u00e9m\u00e9n\u00e9]], C\u00e2mara was personally chosen by John to foster amicable relations with the French court.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=308-310}} No expense was spared on the count's [[Royal Entry|triumphal entry]] into Paris, which cost 100 [[Louis d'or]] and received such great applause from the people of Paris that [[Alexandre de Gusm\u00e3o]], the count's secretary, stated that \"the Count of Ribeira Grande has eternalized the grandness of our generous king.\"{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=308-310}} Although King Louis would die only weeks after the Portuguese embassy's arrival to France, the richness and extravagance of its entry to Paris was noted at the French court and across Europe and gained a new level of prestige for John and his kingdom.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=308-310}}\n\nAs John concerned himself with the presentation of Portugal at the court of Europe from home through the planning and organization of important embassies, the king's brother, [[Infante Manuel, Count of Our\u00e9m]], was similarly raising the name of Portugal throughout Europe. Having left the country in 1715 without the king's permission (as was required for royalty and high nobility), the Count of Our\u00e9m traveled throughout Europe, staying with Portuguese ambassadors and nobles across the continent, causing quite a fanfare.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=71}} Although the king was displeased that Manuel left without permission, the king forgave the infante, writing to Manuel \"your age absolves your mistake\".{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=72}} Now having the king's permission, Infante Manuel entered the service of [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]], serving alongside him at the successful [[Battle of Petrovaradin]].{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=75}}{{sfn|Soares}} Over the next 17 years, the Count of Our\u00e9m moved from court to court as a celebrity and military hero and was even considered as a candidate as [[King of Poland]] by provision of the 1732 [[Treaty of the Three Black Eagles]].{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=73-74}}{{sfn|Sieradzki|p=106}} Manuel's adventures throughout the continent inspired several literary works and gained him celebrity, raising Portugal's prestige in the eyes of Europe.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=71}}\n\n=== Catholic Church ===\n[[File:D.

John sought acknowledgement by the pope as a lawful and righteous monarch as a means of international recognition of his capabilities and authority. Relations with John's first pope, [[Pope Clement XI|Clement XI]], were largely successful, resulting from mutual beneficial agreements. In 1716, in response to a request by Pope Clement XI to John for aid in the fight against the Turks, the king sent an armada of Portuguese ships to assist Venice and Austria in their conflicts with the Turks that was led by his brother, [[Infante Francisco, Duke of Beja]], and Lopo Furtado de Mendon\u00e7a, Count of Rio Grande.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=336}} In the same year, John ordered a formal, triumphal entry for his ambassador in Rome, Rodrigo Anes de S\u00e1 Almeida e Meneses, Marquis of Fontes.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=319}} Seeking to mimic the response received at the French court, 5,000 cruzados were spent on a luxurious entry for the Portuguese envoy.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=320}} The ceremonial procession included a convoy of 300 carriages surrounding the ''pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance'' of the procession, the Oceans Coach, an ornate carriage made in Lisbon to demonstrate the wealth of the Portuguese empire to Rome.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=320}} Having impressed the papal court, Pope Clement XI raised the dignity of the Archdiocese of Lisbon to the [[Patriarchate of Lisbon]], making the Portuguese capital only one of two dioceses with this title in Europe, alongside [[Patriarchate of Venice|Venice]].{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=336}} John's good fortune with the papacy and Italy would continue to raise the next year, in 1717, when the aid of a Portuguese squadron of ships helped win the [[Battle of Matapan]], in the ongoing [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1714\u201318)|Ottoman-Venetian War]].{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=337}}\n[[File:Infante Francisco, Duque de Beja (cropped).JPG|thumb|left|[[Infante Francisco, Duke of Beja]] commanded the Portuguese armada requested by [[Pope Clement XI]].]]\nPope Clement XI's successor, [[Pope Innocent XIII]], had served as [[Apostolic Nunciature to Portugal|Apostolic Nuncio to Portugal]] from 1697 to 1710, at the court of John and his father King Peter II.{{sfn|Pimentel UC|p=31-39}} However, Innocent XIII's time in Portugal is cited to have been the source of his dislike of the [[Society of Jesus]], owing to the immense power that the Jesuits held at the Portuguese court and the concessions they held across the [[Portuguese Empire]] at the time. An ongoing issue of importance to the Portugal was the long-standing [[Chinese Rites controversy]], which largely concerned the methods used in Asia by the Jesuits, which were largely under patronage of the Portuguese.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=316-318}} Innocent XIII's decision to prohibit the Jesuits from continuing [[Jesuit China missions|their missions in China]] caused great upset at the Portuguese court.{{sfn|Jenkins|p=7-8}} Though Innocent XIII's successor, [[Pope Benedict XIII]], was the only Pope to descend from [[Portuguese royalty]] (descending from King [[Dinis I of Portugal]]), relations were no warmer with Portugal than under his predecessor.{{sfn|Azevedo|p=280}} Discontent with the Vatican's dismissal of his requests, John retaliated against Benedict XIII in 1728, closing the Papal Nunciature in Lisbon, recalling all Portuguese cardinals from Rome, and prohibiting official relations between Portuguese subjects and the Holy See.{{sfn|Pimentel UC|p=31-39}} Though Benedict XIII sought to resolve the issues through an amicable intermediary, King [[Philip V of Spain]], though John refused.{{sfn|Pimentel UC|p=31-39}}\n\nAn issue of significance to John concerned the rank and appointment of the Apostolic Nuncio in Portugal, which the king wished to be raised to the dignity of a [[crown-cardinal]] and demanded input in the selection process.{{sfn|Bianchini|p=9-12}}{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=316-318}} Both Clement XI and Innocent XIII had denied John's requests and Benedict XIII had failed to mediate a resolution.{{sfn|Bianchini|p=9-12}} Only during the fourth papacy of John's reign was the issue resolved, when [[Pope Clement XII]] acquiesced to the king's demands, in 1730, elevating the Portuguese nunciature to the dignity shared only with France, Austria, and Spain.{{sfn|Bianchini|p=9-12}} John's last pope and Clement XII's successor, [[Pope Benedict XIV]], had a markedly better relation with the king, granting the king his desired recognition as a lawful Christian monarch.{{sfn|Bianchini|p=9-12}} In 1748, the pope awarded the title of ''[[Most Faithful Majesty]]'' to John and his successors.{{sfn|Verzijl|p=164-174}}\n\n=== Imperial administration ===\n[[File:D.

Expansion of Portuguese territory in the Americas was also a concern, which was primarily achieved through military incursions into the interior of the continent by ''[[Bandeirantes]]''. Portugal also regained control of [[Uruguay]] following the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], in 1714, and successfully defended it against an attempted Spanish reconquest in the [[Spanish\u2013Portuguese War (1735\u20131737)|Spanish\u2013Portuguese War of 1735\u201337]].{{sfn|Jumar|p=165-169}} \n\nIn the 1690s, during the final years of King Peter II's reign, precious resources were discovered in Brazil, namely vast gold and diamond deposits. However, exploitation of the resources primarily began in John's reign, with the establishment of mining companies, taxation systems, and a [[mercantilism|mercantilist]] supply chain, which ushered in a period known as the [[Brazilian Gold Rush]].{{sfn|Freire Costa|p=77=98}} The [[Royal fifth]] was instituted as a form of taxation on mining activities, requiring a fifth of all gold to go directly to the king's treasury. In an effort to consolidate royal authority while promoting efficient governance, John took control of the [[Captaincy of S\u00e3o Vicente]] (in 1709) and the [[Captaincy of Pernambuco]] (in 1716), establishing direct royal governance in the two most valuable provinces of Brazil.{{sfn|Silva|p=122}}{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=240-242}} In 1721, John ordered the separation of the region of intense mining from the rest of the Captaincy of S\u00e3o Vicente, into the autonomous captaincy of ''[[Minas Gerais]]'' (General Mines), allowing for the colonial administration to collect taxation more effectively.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=337}}\n\n;Asia\n[[File:Retrato de D.

Minor contentions with Dutch corsairs blocking shipments to and from the [[Portuguese Gold Coast]] in the 1720s resulted in successful Portuguese victory over the Dutch in minor naval battles.{{sfn|Monteiro|p=128}} Notable, tensions were also raised with Britain in 1722 when British forces established a fortification in [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]] (in modern-day [[Angola]]), which had been claimed and evangelized by the Portuguese since the 15th century. A notable rare exception to the long-standing [[Anglo-Portuguese Alliance]], John ordered galleons from the ''Armada do Brasil'' to dispatch to Cabinda to either take possession of the fort or destroy it and its men, resulting in a Portuguese victory in 1723.{{sfn|Monteiro|p=126}} Portugal briefly reconquered [[Mombasa]] (modern-day [[Kenya]]) in 1728, only to lose control over it again in 1729, ending the last period of Portuguese rule in Mombasa.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=337}}\n\n== Joanine culture ==\n\n=== Court ===\n\n=== Mafra ===\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = left\n | width = \n | footer =\n | image1 = Skies are clearing (29763628926) (cropped).jpg\n | image2 = 22478-Mafra (49043376603).jpg\n | caption2 = The [[Palace of Mafra|Royal Palatial Complex at Mafra]] was built from 1717 to 1755 to project John's power and wealth.\n }}\nJohn is often remembered as one of the greatest patrons of the arts in Portuguese history, having commissioned numerous construction projects and artistic studies. The king's most famous and important work was the [[Mafra National Palace|Royal Palace-Convent of Mafra]]. In early 1711, married to Maria Anna of Austria for three years and without an heir, John grew worried for the future of the House of Braganza. He met with D. Nuno da Cunha e Ata\u00edde, High-Inquisitor of Portugal, who assured the king that if he promised to build a convent for Franciscans in Mafra, in the Lisbon countryside, Maria Anna would bear him a child by the end of 1711. John agreed to do so. Construction started in 1717, with plans for a modest church convent for one hundred friars.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=112-113}} However, in the following years, with a gratuitous flow of gold from the American colonies of [[State of Brazil|Brazil]] and [[State of Maranh\u00e3o (colonial)|Maranh\u00e3o]], the plans were altered to become a ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' of John's reign, accommodating three hundred friars and adjusted to become a hybrid convent-palace, including a royal library, a basilica, and a vast set of apartments for the royal family. Noting the vast size and scope of the project, Charles de Merveilleux, a Swiss nobleman living in Portugal in 1726, remarked that \"King John has decided to build a second [[El Escorial|Escorial]].\"{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=113}}\n\nWith the new plans for a palatial complex, the project at Mafra, entrusted to royal architect [[Jo\u00e3o Frederico Ludovice]], became much more than a fulfillment of a religious promise, but rather a demonstration of monarchical power and wealth.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=113}} By 1729, 15,470 workers from throughout Portugal and its colonies were contributing to the construction of the palace, alongside a total of 6,124 infantrymen and cavalrymen, making a total of 21,594 persons involved in the building process and site that year.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=114}} While the majority of the palace was completed by 1730, John was so consumed in completing the project that he decreed it mandatory for all inhabitants of the villages of Mafra and [[Ericeira]] to work at the palace, requiring an excused permission not to participate, and only under extraordinary circumstances.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=113}} In regard to the exuberant cost of the palatial complex, Merveilleux remarked that \"three quarters of the royal treasury and nearly all of the gold brought on the fleets from Brazil were here, at Mafra, turned into stone.\"{{sfn|Brand\u00e3o}}\n\nMafra stood as a monument to regal power, even though it would become only a pleasure palace and never a seat of authority.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=121}} John commissioned numerous operas, comedies, and serenades to be celebrated at the palace with great pomp, and its enormous property became the favoured hunting grounds of the royal family for centuries to come.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=121}} The king also began to celebrate his birthday annually at Mafra, starting in 1732.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=116}} John housed one of the largest and most sumptuous libraries in Europe within the palace, with over 36,000 volumes dating from the 14th to the 18th centuries. Works at Mafra would continue until 1755, when the devastation wreaked by the [[Great Lisbon earthquake]] required as many workers as possible to rebuild the city.\n\n=== Patron of the arts ===\n{{see also|Project of Filippo Juvarra for the Royal Palace of Lisbon}}\n\n== Later life ==\n\n=== Last years ===\n\n=== Illness===\nJohn was afflicted with [[Edema|dropsy]] which caused his death in 1750 at age 60.<ref>{{cite book|title=History of Portugal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fHI3AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA349|year=1937|publisher=Cambridge University Archive|page=349|id=GGKEY:XWSD821GE8S}}</ref>\n\n== Titles, styles, and honours ==\n{{main|List of titles and honours of the Portuguese Crown}}\n{{Infobox Portuguese Royalty styles\n| name = John V of Portugal\n| dipstyle = [[Faithful Majesty|His Most Faithful Majesty]]\n| offstyle = Your Most Faithful Majesty\n| altstyle = [[Majesty|His Majesty]]\n}}\n\n=== Titles and styles ===\n* '''22 October 1689 \u2013 1 December 1696''' ''[[His Highness]]'' the ''Most Serene'' Infante Jo\u00e3o of Portugal{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=21}}\n* '''1 December 1696 \u2013 9 December 1706''' ''[[His Royal Highness]]'' the [[Prince of Brazil]], [[Duke of Braganza]], etc.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=21}}\n* '''9 December 1706 \u2013 23 December 1748''' ''[[Majesty|His Majesty]]'' the [[List of Portuguese monarchs|King of Portugal and the Algarves]]{{sfn|Soares de Azevedo|p=34}}\n* '''23 December 1748 - 31 July 1750''' ''[[Faithful Majesty|His Most Faithful Majesty]]'' the King of Portugal and the Algarves{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=26}}\n\nThe official styling of John as King of Portugal:<br>\n''By the Grace of God, Jo\u00e3o V, King of Portugal and the Algarves before and beyond the sea in Africa, Lord of Guinea and of Conquest, Navigation, and Commerce of Ethiopia, Arabia, Persia, and India, etc.''\n\n=== Honours ===\nAs monarch of Portugal, John V was Grand Master of the following Portuguese Orders:\n* [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]]\n* [[Order of Saint Benedict of Aviz]]\n* [[Order of Saint James of the Sword]]\n* [[Order of the Tower and Sword]]\n\n== Genealogy ==\n\n=== Ancestry ===\nThe ancestry of King John V:\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

John V's reign saw the rise of [[Portugal]] and its monarchy to new levels of prosperity, wealth, and prestige among European courts.{{sfn|Carmo Reis, Vol V}}\n\nJohn V's reign saw an enormous influx of gold into the coffers of the royal treasury, supplied largely by the [[royal fifth]] (a tax on precious metals) that was received from the [[Portuguese empire|Portuguese colonies]] of [[State of Brazil|Brazil]] and [[State of Maranh\u00e3o (colonial)|Maranh\u00e3o]]. John spent lavishly on ambitious architectural works, most notably [[Mafra National Palace|Mafra Palace]], and on commissions and additions for his sizable art and literary collections. Owing to his craving for international diplomatic recognition, John also spent large sums on the embassies he sent to the courts of Europe, the most famous being those he sent to Paris in 1715 and Rome in 1716.\n\nDisregarding traditional Portuguese institutions of governance, John V ruled as an [[absolute monarch]]. As a continuation of a Braganza dynasty policy that stressed the importance of relations with Europe, John's reign was marked by numerous interventions into the affairs of other European states, most notably as part of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. On the imperial front, John V pursued an expansionist policy, with significant territorial gains in [[Portuguese India]] and [[Portuguese America]].\n\nJohn V was a very pious man who devoted large parts of his day to prayer and religious study. He rewarded his long-awaited recognition as a lawful monarch by [[Pope Benedict XIV]] with a fervent devotion to the [[Catholic Church]] and some very large donations to the [[Holy See]]. The Pope granted John V the style \"[[Most Faithful Majesty]],\" which appealed to him greatly. However, John's relationship with the [[papacy]] varied at different periods in his reign; there were both close relations and conflicts at different times during the reigns of five different popes.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=318-321}}\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Le Prince de Bresil, fils ain\u00e9 de Pierre 2\u00ba. Roy de Portugal, Paris, ca. 1706.png|thumb|left|''John, [[Prince of Brazil]], eldest son of Pedro II of Portugal''; Berey, c. 1706.]]\nJohn was born on 22 October 1689 at [[Ribeira Palace]]{{sfn|Caetano de Sousa, Vol VIII|p=1}} in [[Lisbon]] to King [[Peter II of Portugal|Peter&nbsp;II]] and Queen [[Maria Sophia of Neuburg]]. He was baptized on November 19 at the Royal Palace Chapel and given the full name John Francis Anthony Joseph Benedict Bernard (''Jo\u00e3o Francisco Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Bento Bernardo'').{{sfn|Caetano de Sousa, Vol VIII|p=2}} John was not his father's first son; he had an older brother, [[Jo\u00e3o, Prince of Brazil|John]], who died a year before John's birth, thus the court was overjoyed to have a new male heir to the kingdom.\n\nUpon his baptism, John was not given the traditional titles of the heir apparent to the Portuguese throne, [[Prince of Brazil]] and [[Duke of Braganza]], but merely the default title [[Infante of Portugal]]. This was intended as a sign of respect for his elder brother's death, which had happened only months before.\n\n=== Education ===\nJohn had a stimulating upbringing surrounded by some of the most brilliant minds of Europe at the time. It was agreed by the court that John's care as a child was to be strictly run by women only, a custom of the Portuguese court, and the [[Portuguese nobility]] as a whole.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=19}} John's governess (who was later the governess for all of the sons of Pedro II) was Maria de Lencastre, the Marquise of Unh\u00e3o, who was given that position more for her beauty and status than for her suitability as a child care giver.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=19}}\n\nThe policies that John's father had pursued made the Portuguese court wealthy, the national economy stable, and the imperial military strong. This made a richly varied and interesting childhood possible for John. As a child, he was under the tutelage and heavy influence of the [[Jesuit]] Fathers Francisco da Cruz, Jo\u00e3o Seco, and Lu\u00eds Gonzaga.{{sfn|Ver\u00edssimo Serr\u00e3o, Vol V|p=234}} Father Lu\u00eds Gonzaga was in charge of the education of all of King Pedro's children; he taught them military education, politics, astronomy, nautical studies, mathematics, and history. {{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=21}} As the prince grew up, he was mentored in political affairs by [[Lu\u00eds da Cunha]], a prominent Portuguese diplomat.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=21}}\n\n=== Maturity ===\n[[File:Joao V - Principe.jpg|thumb|right|''John, [[Duke of Braganza]]''; c. 1706. John aged around 17 years.]]\nWhen John reached age seven, his father determined that his eldest sons were sufficiently educated in basic subjects and decided to take over supervision of their instruction himself, though his interest in mentoring them quickly faded.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=22}} This was formalised when he and his brother [[Francisco, Duke of Beja]], were admitted into the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]] on 7 April 1696. {{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=21}} Later that year, the king finally decided to confer on John the titles of the heir apparent, namely [[Prince of Brazil]] and [[Duke of Braganza]]. On 1 December 1696, on the anniversary of the [[Portuguese Restoration War]] of 1640, a grand ceremony was held in which John was invested with his titles. {{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=21}} The ceremony involved the placing of a large ermine and red velvet mantle on his shoulders, as well as the adornment of his person with various jewels and royal regalia.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=21}}\n\nJust over a month before John's tenth birthday in 1699, his mother Queen Maria Sofia died at the age of 33.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=20}} This caused John to retreat from court and become depressed for many months.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=20}} [[Catherine of Braganza]], his aunt and the former [[List of English consorts|Queen consort of England]], [[List of Scottish consorts|Scotland]], [[List of Irish consorts|and Ireland]], then took control of his education.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=20}} She resided in the palace she had built, [[Bemposta Palace]], and remained John's main tutor and female role model until her death in 1705.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=20}}\n\nIn April 1700, John fell terribly ill; it was assumed that he was on his death bed.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=21}} Fearing his imminent demise, he asked for his [[last rites]] and confessed his sins.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=21}} To everyone's surprise, he rallied and soon returned to his normal activities,{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=21}} his complete recovery being considered a miracle by the court.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=21}}\n\nThe death of John's sister Teresa Maria in February 1704, greatly saddened him. It caused him to avoid appearing at court for some months and to estrange himself from his father, who favoured John's younger brother, [[Manuel, Count of Our\u00e9m]].{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=22}} During this time, much gossip was spread and worries arose about whether John would ever recover from his depression. In May of that year, he eventually returned to the court and reconciled with the king, saying that his [[saudade]]s for his sister would not get in the way of his performing his duty to the king.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=22}}\n\n== Succession ==\n[[File:Jo\u00e3o V, \u00f3leo sobre tela, Portugal, s\u00e9culo XVIII.jpg|thumb|left|''Portrait of King John V with a Crown''; 1707. John aged 18 years.]]\nIn early December 1706, Pedro II moved himself to the Royal Quinta in Alc\u00e2ntara, as he was growing ill and needed space from the court.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=23}} On the fifth of that month, the king caught a high fever, and the court doctors met to examine him fully.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=23}} They determined his health was greatly deteriorating.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=23}} The next day, Pedro II called all of his children to his bedside and told them of his coming demise. He appointed John as prince [[regent]] of the kingdom and asked that all of his children follow John's wishes.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=24}} Although he appointed John the prince regent, Pedro II still favoured his youngest son Manuel, and the king gave Manuel a special gift that no other child received.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=23}}\n\n=== Acclamation ===\nKing Pedro II died in his sleep on 9 December 1706.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=24}} Following his death, [[Ribeira Palace]] was redecorated as a reflection of the mourning. On the fa\u00e7ade towards the [[Terreiro do Pa\u00e7o]], large black banners were hung from the windows for this purpose.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=26}} A month later, the time was declared to be appropriate for John to be acclaimed king. Preparations for John's acclamation had already been started and once allowed, the royal palace was redecorated; the black banners were replaced with red ones, and fruit wreaths were hung throughout all of the palace.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=26}}\n\nOn the day of John's acclamation, 1 January 1707, his new throne was placed on the balcony of the ''Torre do Rei'' (Tower of the King) of Ribeira Palace.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=26}} Specially-made tapestries illustrating the allegories of Justice and Prudence were hung high above the Terreiro do Pa\u00e7o to remind the public that these were the traits their king would have.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=26}} Once John sat down on his throne, wreaths made of gold were laid around the throne and balcony.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=26}}  Wearing his [[Cross of the Order of Christ]], and with the [[Portuguese Crown Jewels]] beside him, and not on him, as was the Portuguese royal custom, John was acclaimed \"His Majesty, by the Grace of God, King of Portugal and the Algarves, before and beyond the sea in Africa, Lord of Guinea and of Conquest, Navigation, and Commerce of Ethiopia, Arabia, Persia, and India, our Lord, John, the fifth of that name in the table of the Kings of Portugal.\"\n\nJohn was now king of an empire that stretched four continents. He was also the head of state of a kingdom that was at [[War of the Spanish Succession|war with Spain and France]].{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=26}} His first regnal act was to renew Portugal's membership in the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|League of Augsburg]] and continue in the war alongside the [[Kingdom of England|England]] and the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburgs]].{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=26}} Portugal quickly supplied more troops to aid her allies in the war. This new level of Portuguese involvement allowed John's general, [[Ant\u00f3nio Lu\u00eds de Sousa, Marquis of Minas]], to capture Madrid on 28 June 1706. While Portugal put vast resources into the war, contrary to John's predecessors, who avoided conflicts in Europe, activity in the war soon lost the interest of the king, who had more pressing affairs to attend to.\n\n=== Marriage ===\n[[File:Desembarque da Rainha D. Maria Ana de \u00c1ustria em Lisboa (1708), gravura alem\u00e3, s\u00e9c. XVIII.png|thumb|right|''The Arrival of [[Maria Anna of Austria]] in Lisbon''; Gottfried Stein, c. 1708.]]\nDuring his life, Pedro II had worked a long time to secure John a marriage with an Austrian [[archduchess]] in order to guarantee Portugal's alliance with the Habsburgs.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=28}} John continued these negotiations and finally succeeded in negotiating a deal. On 27 June 1707, Fern\u00e3o Teles da Silva, Count of Vilar Maior, signed a marriage contract with Holy Emperor [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]] that made official a match between John and the emperor's sister, the Archduchess [[Maria Anna of Austria]].{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=28}} The contract also set the archduchess's dowry at 100,000 [[Austrian krone|crowns]], a vast sum for the day.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=28}}\n\nThe armada that Portugal sent to escort Maria Anna from the [[Lower Countries]] to [[Lisbon]] arrived in the [[Tagus river]] estuary on 26 October 1708.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=28}} The flagship, in which Maria Anna travelled, berthed at the docks of the private garden of Ribeira Palace, where John and a party of the kingdom's richest and most powerful nobles met the new queen for the first time.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=28}} The marriage celebrations lasted until 27 December;{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=30}} they were sumptuous and very costly.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=28}}\n\nBy late 1710, John and Maria Anna had not produced an heir to the throne. It had been two years since the couple had been married, and the court was starting to question the future of the [[House of Braganza]]. In early 1711, the king met with [[Franciscan]] Cardinal Nuno da Cunha e Ata\u00edde, High Inquisitor of the [[Portuguese Inquisition]], who told him that if he promised God to build a Franciscan convent in [[Mafra, Portugal|Mafra]], God would deliver his long desired heir. Accordingly, John promised that if Maria Anna became pregnant before the end of 1711, he would build a Franciscan convent in Mafra.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ipmuseus.pt/pt-PT/museus_palacios/ContentDetail.aspx?id=1125 |title=Pal\u00e1cio Nacional de Mafra |author=Instituto dos Museus e da Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o |date=22 July 2011 |work=Museus e Pal\u00e1cios |accessdate=5 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511085547/http://www.ipmuseus.pt/pt-PT/museus_palacios/ContentDetail.aspx?id=1125 |archivedate=11 May 2012 }}</ref>  John's wish would come true later that year, when Maria Anna fulfilled her duty as queen  and gave birth to the [[Barbara of Portugal|Infanta Maria Barbara of Braganza]] on 4 December 1711.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=42}}\n\nJohn and Maria Anna had a successful marriage, but lived largely separate lives. Maria Anna devoted herself to preserving the decorum of the royal court and her own religious interests, while John concerned himself with whatever pleased him at the moment.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=33}} John kept many mistresses throughout his royal career, including Filipa de Noronha, [[Paula de Odivelas]], Lu\u00edsa In\u00eas Ant\u00f3nia Machado Monteiro, Madalena M\u00e1xima de Miranda, In\u00e1cia Rosa de T\u00e1vora, and [[Luisa Clara de Portugal |Lu\u00edsa Clara de Portugal]].\n\n=== Offspring ===\n[[File:Bapt\u00eame du prince de Portugal sous le nom de Pierre III, prince du Br\u00e9sil - Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France.png|thumb|left|250px|''The Royal Family at the Baptism of [[Pedro, Prince of Brazil]]''; German,  c. 1712.]]\nMaria Barbara's birth was followed by the birth of [[Pedro, Prince of Brazil]], on 19 October 1712, which temporarily gave John a male heir. Prince Pedro's death on 29 October 1714 greatly saddened him, but he took solace in the fact that his son, the [[Joseph I of Portugal|Infante Jos\u00e9]] (now Prince Jos\u00e9), had been born on June 6 earlier that same year. Following the birth of Prince Jos\u00e9, John and Maria Anna would have three more children: [[Infante Carlos of Portugal|Infante Carlos]], born 2 May 1716, [[Pedro III of Portugal|Infante Pedro]], born 5 July 1717, and [[Infante Alexandre of Portugal|Infante Alexandre]], born 24 September 1723.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=42}} Of the last three infantes, only two would survive to adulthood, Infante Carlos and Infante Pedro; only one would continue the Braganza line: Infante Pedro.\n\nJohn's children were trained rigorously growing up. His plan was to have an intelligent son who could take his place as king, a strategically married daughter, and well-prepared statesmen sons; but he would achieve only part of his goal. From her birth, Infanta Maria Barbara's marriage had been closely arranged and monitored by John. When the engagement of [[Mariana Victoria of Spain]] to [[Louis XV of France]] was nullified, John proposed Infanta Maria Barbara as a possible bride for Louis XV, but in the end she was refused.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=44}} John still managed to gain something from the dissolution of the engagement between Louis XV and Mariana Victoria, i.e., a wife for his son Prince Jos\u00e9 and a husband for Infanta Maria Barbara, Mariana Victoria's older brother [[Ferdinand VI of Spain|Fernando, Prince of Asturias]]. Negotiations between Portugal and Spain began in 1725, and four years later John's eldest children would be matched with their spouses-to-be.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=45}} The princesses Maria Barbara and Mariana Victoria were exchanged at a ceremony, called the Exchange of the Princesses (''Troca das Princesas''), held on the [[Caia River]] on 19 January 1729.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=45}} Prince Jos\u00e9 married Mariana Victoria on 19 January 1729 in [[Elvas]], and Infanta Maria Barbara married Prince Fernando on 20 January 1729 in [[Badajoz]].{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=47}}\n[[File:D. Jo\u00e3o V (1689-1750) Hd (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of John for the ''Exchange of the Princesses''; [[Jean Ranc]], 1729.]]\nNone of John's three other sons would marry in his lifetime. Infante Alexandre died at the age of five, and Infante Carlos died at the age of twenty without any marriage proposals or children.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=54}} Only Infante Pedro would live long enough to marry, but John did not live long enough to see it. Infante Pedro married the daughter of his older brother King [[Joseph I of Portugal|Jos\u00e9 I]], Princess Maria Francisca, Princess of Brazil, on 6 June 1760.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=55}} When Princess Maria became Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]] upon the death of her father, King Jos\u00e9 I (John's son), Prince Pedro became King Pedro III, following Portuguese royal law that if the consort of a queen regnant produced children with the queen regnant, he would become king of Portugal ''[[jure uxoris]]''.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=55}}\n\nJohn fathered at least four children from various extramarital affairs: [[Ant\u00f3nio of Braganza, Child of Palhav\u00e3|Ant\u00f3nio of Braganza]], by Lu\u00edsa In\u00eas Ant\u00f3nia Machado Monteiro, [[Gaspar of Braganza, Archbishop of Braga]], by Madalena M\u00e1xima de Miranda, [[Jos\u00e9 of Braganza, High Inquisitor of Portugal]], by [[Paula de Odivelas]], and [[Maria Rita of Braganza]], by Lu\u00edsa Clara de Portugal. Out of his four illegitimate children, the three males were all recognized as John's sons and were collectively known as the [[Children of Palhav\u00e3]], after the Palace of Palhav\u00e3 that belonged to [[Lu\u00eds Carlos In\u00e1cio Xavier de Meneses, 1st Marquis of Louri\u00e7al]], where they lived at John's expense.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=55}} The Children of Palhav\u00e3 received educations worthy of nobility and went on to become noteworthy members of the clergy.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=55-57}}  Maria Rita was never officially recognized as his daughter, but he informally arranged for her life at the Convent of Santos and managed her expenses.{{sfn|Pimentel|p=97}} The husband of Maria Rita's mother, Jorge de Meneses, attempted to stop John's actions for Maria Rita, but the king had him exiled to Spain and then to England.{{sfn|Pimentel|p=98}}\n\n== Regnal politics ==\nWhen John became king, he chose to reign as an [[absolute monarchy|absolute monarch]]. Notably, he  never convened the [[Portuguese Cortes]], the ancient parliament of the [[three estates]] in Portugal, and actively ignored meetings of the Council of State.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=177}} However, John did not act by himself when making decisions; rather, he frequently consulted a close circle of well-informed advisers and held weekly intimate audiences with members of all three estates, which he preferred to larger institutions, such as the Cortes and the Council of State, which he viewed as incompetent and bloated.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=177}} The Count of Povolide remarked on John's governance style, stating that ''\"he established a predominance of personal consultation over institutional consultation.\"''{{sfn|Conde de Povolide|p=350}}\n\n=== His Majesty's Government ===\n[[File:Diogo de Mendon\u00e7a Corte Real.jpg|thumb|right|D.

This position was always filled by a [[favourite]] of John, the most notable one [[Diogo de Mendon\u00e7a Corte-Real]], whom the king consulted with on every matter, to such a degree that it often appeared that he was the king's only minister.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=179}} When John became king, he inherited a powerful and large Council of State made up of numerous bishops, nobles, and bureaucrats, which was charged with being the utmost consultory body to the king, as it was during the reign of John's father.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=182}} However, John's dislike of institutions and consultative bodies led him to cease convening the council formally, leading the prominent politician and diplomat [[Lu\u00eds da Cunha]] to refer to the king as a despot and his government as absolutist.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=183}}\n\nAlthough the Council of State was never convened, several of its members were nonetheless close advisers to the king.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=179}} Alongside Diogo de Mendon\u00e7a Corte-Real, Cardinal Jo\u00e3o da Mota e Silva and High-Inquisitor Nuno da Cunha e Ata\u00edde were close advisers to the king, the former eventually substituting Mendon\u00e7a Corte-Real as Secretary of State when he died in 1736.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=179}}{{Ref|Lisboa, Reis Miranda, Olival|p=54}} Though he disbanded most institutions, John notably maintained the Junta of the Three Estates, a governing [[Totalitarianism|junta]] created by John's grandfather, King [[John IV of Portugal|John IV]], which managed the finances and maintenance of military installations, troop raising, and taxation related to defense.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=184}} Having engaged in multiple conflicts throughout his reign, both in Europe and his empire, John understood the necessity of the junta and carefully picked its members, only selecting those deemed the most knowledgeable and competent.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=184}} Similarly, John maintained the Council of the Treasury, which managed the finances of Portugal and its empire, including tax collection and budget accounting for the majority of Portugal's organizations (except the military), and exerted authority over the [[Casa da \u00cdndia]], the Royal Mint, and the custom houses across Portuguese territory.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=186-188}}\n\n=== European relations ===\n[[File:Portugal no m\u00eas de Julho de Dois Mil e Catorze P7130512 (14548788257).jpg|thumb|left|The ''Coche dos Oceanos'' (Oceans Carriage) used in the [[Royal Entry|triumphal entry]] of the 1716 Portuguese envoy to Rome.]]\nWhen John ascended the throne, he found himself entangled in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], as King Pedro II had signed the [[Methuen Treaty]] in 1703, which aligned Portugal to the Grand Alliance against the [[House of Bourbon]] and allowed Grand Alliance forces to launch their invasion of Spain from Portugal.{{sfn|Ver\u00edssimo Serr\u00e3o, Vol V|p=229}} Only months after assuming the throne, John saw his forces overwhelmingly defeated in at the [[Battle of Almansa]], a defeat that jeopardized Portuguese forces in Spain and the outcome of the war.{{sfn|Francis|p=249}} Portuguese forces continued to fight alongside the Grand Alliance until agreeing to an armistice with Spain and France on 8 November 1712.{{sfn|Francis|p=249-350}}{{sfn|Lynn|p=354\u2013355}}{{sfn|Lynn|p=361-362}} The war finally came to an end in 1713 with the signing of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], whereby Portugal regained possession of territories conquered by the Bourbon coalition and acquired new territories in South America.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=82}}\n\nWith the War of the Spanish Succession ended, John could re-establish relations with the courts of Europe. His first grand act of diplomacy was the dispatch of [[Lu\u00eds Manuel da C\u00e2mara, 3rd Count of Ribeira Grande]], as his ambassador to the court of [[Louis XIV of France]], in early August 1715.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=308-310}} The grandson of [[Fran\u00e7ois, Prince of Soubise]], and cousin of [[Hercule M\u00e9riadec, Prince of Gu\u00e9m\u00e9n\u00e9]], C\u00e2mara was personally chosen by John to foster amicable relations with the French court.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=308-310}} No expense was spared on the count's [[Royal Entry|triumphal entry]] into Paris, which cost 100 [[Louis d'or]] and received such great applause from the people of Paris that [[Alexandre de Gusm\u00e3o]], the count's secretary, stated that \"the Count of Ribeira Grande has eternalized the grandness of our generous king.\"{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=308-310}} Although King Louis would die only weeks after the Portuguese embassy's arrival to France, the richness and extravagance of its entry to Paris was noted at the French court and across Europe and gained a new level of prestige for John and his kingdom.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=308-310}}\n\nAs John concerned himself with the presentation of Portugal at the court of Europe from home through the planning and organization of important embassies, the king's brother, [[Infante Manuel, Count of Our\u00e9m]], was similarly raising the name of Portugal throughout Europe. Having left the country in 1715 without the king's permission (as was required for royalty and high nobility), the Count of Our\u00e9m traveled throughout Europe, staying with Portuguese ambassadors and nobles across the continent, causing quite a fanfare.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=71}} Although the king was displeased that Manuel left without permission, the king forgave the infante, writing to Manuel \"your age absolves your mistake\".{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=72}} Now having the king's permission, Infante Manuel entered the service of [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]], serving alongside him at the successful [[Battle of Petrovaradin]].{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=75}}{{sfn|Soares}} Over the next 17 years, the Count of Our\u00e9m moved from court to court as a celebrity and military hero and was even considered as a candidate as [[King of Poland]] by provision of the 1732 [[Treaty of the Three Black Eagles]].{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=73-74}}{{sfn|Sieradzki|p=106}} Manuel's adventures throughout the continent inspired several literary works and gained him celebrity, raising Portugal's prestige in the eyes of Europe.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=71}}\n\n=== Catholic Church ===\n[[File:D.

John sought acknowledgement by the pope as a lawful and righteous monarch as a means of international recognition of his capabilities and authority. Relations with John's first pope, [[Pope Clement XI|Clement XI]], were largely successful, resulting from mutual beneficial agreements. In 1716, in response to a request by Pope Clement XI to John for aid in the fight against the Turks, the king sent an armada of Portuguese ships to assist Venice and Austria in their conflicts with the Turks that was led by his brother, [[Infante Francisco, Duke of Beja]], and Lopo Furtado de Mendon\u00e7a, Count of Rio Grande.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=336}} In the same year, John ordered a formal, triumphal entry for his ambassador in Rome, Rodrigo Anes de S\u00e1 Almeida e Meneses, Marquis of Fontes.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=319}} Seeking to mimic the response received at the French court, 5,000 cruzados were spent on a luxurious entry for the Portuguese envoy.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=320}} The ceremonial procession included a convoy of 300 carriages surrounding the ''pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance'' of the procession, the Oceans Coach, an ornate carriage made in Lisbon to demonstrate the wealth of the Portuguese empire to Rome.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=320}} Having impressed the papal court, Pope Clement XI raised the dignity of the Archdiocese of Lisbon to the [[Patriarchate of Lisbon]], making the Portuguese capital only one of two dioceses with this title in Europe, alongside [[Patriarchate of Venice|Venice]].{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=336}} John's good fortune with the papacy and Italy would continue to raise the next year, in 1717, when the aid of a Portuguese squadron of ships helped win the [[Battle of Matapan]], in the ongoing [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1714\u201318)|Ottoman-Venetian War]].{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=337}}\n[[File:Infante Francisco, Duque de Beja (cropped).JPG|thumb|left|[[Infante Francisco, Duke of Beja]] commanded the Portuguese armada requested by [[Pope Clement XI]].]]\nPope Clement XI's successor, [[Pope Innocent XIII]], had served as [[Apostolic Nunciature to Portugal|Apostolic Nuncio to Portugal]] from 1697 to 1710, at the court of John and his father King Peter II.{{sfn|Pimentel UC|p=31-39}} However, Innocent XIII's time in Portugal is cited to have been the source of his dislike of the [[Society of Jesus]], owing to the immense power that the Jesuits held at the Portuguese court and the concessions they held across the [[Portuguese Empire]] at the time. An ongoing issue of importance to the Portugal was the long-standing [[Chinese Rites controversy]], which largely concerned the methods used in Asia by the Jesuits, which were largely under patronage of the Portuguese.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=316-318}} Innocent XIII's decision to prohibit the Jesuits from continuing [[Jesuit China missions|their missions in China]] caused great upset at the Portuguese court.{{sfn|Jenkins|p=7-8}} Though Innocent XIII's successor, [[Pope Benedict XIII]], was the only Pope to descend from [[Portuguese royalty]] (descending from King [[Dinis I of Portugal]]), relations were no warmer with Portugal than under his predecessor.{{sfn|Azevedo|p=280}} Discontent with the Vatican's dismissal of his requests, John retaliated against Benedict XIII in 1728, closing the Papal Nunciature in Lisbon, recalling all Portuguese cardinals from Rome, and prohibiting official relations between Portuguese subjects and the Holy See.{{sfn|Pimentel UC|p=31-39}} Though Benedict XIII sought to resolve the issues through an amicable intermediary, King [[Philip V of Spain]], though John refused.{{sfn|Pimentel UC|p=31-39}}\n\nAn issue of significance to John concerned the rank and appointment of the Apostolic Nuncio in Portugal, which the king wished to be raised to the dignity of a [[crown-cardinal]] and demanded input in the selection process.{{sfn|Bianchini|p=9-12}}{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=316-318}} Both Clement XI and Innocent XIII had denied John's requests and Benedict XIII had failed to mediate a resolution.{{sfn|Bianchini|p=9-12}} Only during the fourth papacy of John's reign was the issue resolved, when [[Pope Clement XII]] acquiesced to the king's demands, in 1730, elevating the Portuguese nunciature to the dignity shared only with France, Austria, and Spain.{{sfn|Bianchini|p=9-12}} John's last pope and Clement XII's successor, [[Pope Benedict XIV]], had a markedly better relation with the king, granting the king his desired recognition as a lawful Christian monarch.{{sfn|Bianchini|p=9-12}} In 1748, the pope awarded the title of ''[[Most Faithful Majesty]]'' to John and his successors.{{sfn|Verzijl|p=164-174}}\n\n=== Imperial administration ===\n[[File:D.

Under John, the [[Portuguese Empire]] saw territorial gains in modern-day [[Brazil]], [[India]], [[Kenya]], [[Uruguay]], [[East Timor]], [[Angola]], and [[Mozambique]], among others.\n\n;Americas\n[[Portuguese America]] occupied the highest priority in John's administration of the Portuguese Empire.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=240-242}} The American colonies of [[colonial Brazil|Brazil]] and [[State of Maranh\u00e3o (colonial)|Maranh\u00e3o]] had become vital sources of wealth to the royal treasury, making the protection, expansion, and good governance of Portuguese America crucial to imperial policy in the Joanine era.  Expansion of Portuguese territory in the Americas was also a concern, which was primarily achieved through military incursions into the interior of the continent by ''[[Bandeirantes]]''. Portugal also regained control of [[Uruguay]] following the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], in 1714, and successfully defended it against an attempted Spanish reconquest in the [[Spanish\u2013Portuguese War (1735\u20131737)|Spanish\u2013Portuguese War of 1735\u201337]].{{sfn|Jumar|p=165-169}} \n\nIn the 1690s, during the final years of King Peter II's reign, precious resources were discovered in Brazil, namely vast gold and diamond deposits. However, exploitation of the resources primarily began in John's reign, with the establishment of mining companies, taxation systems, and a [[mercantilism|mercantilist]] supply chain, which ushered in a period known as the [[Brazilian Gold Rush]].{{sfn|Freire Costa|p=77=98}} The [[Royal fifth]] was instituted as a form of taxation on mining activities, requiring a fifth of all gold to go directly to the king's treasury. In an effort to consolidate royal authority while promoting efficient governance, John took control of the [[Captaincy of S\u00e3o Vicente]] (in 1709) and the [[Captaincy of Pernambuco]] (in 1716), establishing direct royal governance in the two most valuable provinces of Brazil.{{sfn|Silva|p=122}}{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=240-242}} In 1721, John ordered the separation of the region of intense mining from the rest of the Captaincy of S\u00e3o Vicente, into the autonomous captaincy of ''[[Minas Gerais]]'' (General Mines), allowing for the colonial administration to collect taxation more effectively.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=337}}\n\n;Asia\n[[File:Retrato de D.

Disney|p=299-331}}{{sfn|Monteiro|p=73=76}} The declining importance of Portuguese India resulted in numerous administrative reorganizations during John's reign, including the independence of [[Portuguese Mozambique]] from rule by the [[List of governors of Portuguese India|Viceroy of Portuguese India]], as well as the creation of a direct commercial route from Portugal to [[Portuguese Macau]] (present day [[China]]) which eliminated the stop at the Indian port of [[Goa]].{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=288-293}}\n\n;Africa\nThe [[Portuguese colonization of Africa]] was less important to John's colonial priorities compared to the Americas and Asia. Minor contentions with Dutch corsairs blocking shipments to and from the [[Portuguese Gold Coast]] in the 1720s resulted in successful Portuguese victory over the Dutch in minor naval battles.{{sfn|Monteiro|p=128}} Notable, tensions were also raised with Britain in 1722 when British forces established a fortification in [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]] (in modern-day [[Angola]]), which had been claimed and evangelized by the Portuguese since the 15th century. A notable rare exception to the long-standing [[Anglo-Portuguese Alliance]], John ordered galleons from the ''Armada do Brasil'' to dispatch to Cabinda to either take possession of the fort or destroy it and its men, resulting in a Portuguese victory in 1723.{{sfn|Monteiro|p=126}} Portugal briefly reconquered [[Mombasa]] (modern-day [[Kenya]]) in 1728, only to lose control over it again in 1729, ending the last period of Portuguese rule in Mombasa.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=337}}\n\n== Joanine culture ==\n\n=== Court ===\n\n=== Mafra ===\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = left\n | width = \n | footer =\n | image1 = Skies are clearing (29763628926) (cropped).jpg\n | image2 = 22478-Mafra (49043376603).jpg\n | caption2 = The [[Palace of Mafra|Royal Palatial Complex at Mafra]] was built from 1717 to 1755 to project John's power and wealth.\n }}\nJohn is often remembered as one of the greatest patrons of the arts in Portuguese history, having commissioned numerous construction projects and artistic studies. The king's most famous and important work was the [[Mafra National Palace|Royal Palace-Convent of Mafra]]. In early 1711, married to Maria Anna of Austria for three years and without an heir, John grew worried for the future of the House of Braganza. He met with D. Nuno da Cunha e Ata\u00edde, High-Inquisitor of Portugal, who assured the king that if he promised to build a convent for Franciscans in Mafra, in the Lisbon countryside, Maria Anna would bear him a child by the end of 1711. John agreed to do so. Construction started in 1717, with plans for a modest church convent for one hundred friars.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=112-113}} However, in the following years, with a gratuitous flow of gold from the American colonies of [[State of Brazil|Brazil]] and [[State of Maranh\u00e3o (colonial)|Maranh\u00e3o]], the plans were altered to become a ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' of John's reign, accommodating three hundred friars and adjusted to become a hybrid convent-palace, including a royal library, a basilica, and a vast set of apartments for the royal family. Noting the vast size and scope of the project, Charles de Merveilleux, a Swiss nobleman living in Portugal in 1726, remarked that \"King John has decided to build a second [[El Escorial|Escorial]].\"{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=113}}\n\nWith the new plans for a palatial complex, the project at Mafra, entrusted to royal architect [[Jo\u00e3o Frederico Ludovice]], became much more than a fulfillment of a religious promise, but rather a demonstration of monarchical power and wealth.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=113}} By 1729, 15,470 workers from throughout Portugal and its colonies were contributing to the construction of the palace, alongside a total of 6,124 infantrymen and cavalrymen, making a total of 21,594 persons involved in the building process and site that year.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=114}} While the majority of the palace was completed by 1730, John was so consumed in completing the project that he decreed it mandatory for all inhabitants of the villages of Mafra and [[Ericeira]] to work at the palace, requiring an excused permission not to participate, and only under extraordinary circumstances.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=113}} In regard to the exuberant cost of the palatial complex, Merveilleux remarked that \"three quarters of the royal treasury and nearly all of the gold brought on the fleets from Brazil were here, at Mafra, turned into stone.\"{{sfn|Brand\u00e3o}}\n\nMafra stood as a monument to regal power, even though it would become only a pleasure palace and never a seat of authority.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=121}} John commissioned numerous operas, comedies, and serenades to be celebrated at the palace with great pomp, and its enormous property became the favoured hunting grounds of the royal family for centuries to come.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=121}} The king also began to celebrate his birthday annually at Mafra, starting in 1732.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=116}} John housed one of the largest and most sumptuous libraries in Europe within the palace, with over 36,000 volumes dating from the 14th to the 18th centuries. Works at Mafra would continue until 1755, when the devastation wreaked by the [[Great Lisbon earthquake]] required as many workers as possible to rebuild the city.\n\n=== Patron of the arts ===\n{{see also|Project of Filippo Juvarra for the Royal Palace of Lisbon}}\n\n== Later life ==\n\n=== Last years ===\n\n=== Illness===\nJohn was afflicted with [[Edema|dropsy]] which caused his death in 1750 at age 60.<ref>{{cite book|title=History of Portugal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fHI3AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA349|year=1937|publisher=Cambridge University Archive|page=349|id=GGKEY:XWSD821GE8S}}</ref>\n\n== Titles, styles, and honours ==\n{{main|List of titles and honours of the Portuguese Crown}}\n{{Infobox Portuguese Royalty styles\n| name = John V of Portugal\n| dipstyle = [[Faithful Majesty|His Most Faithful Majesty]]\n| offstyle = Your Most Faithful Majesty\n| altstyle = [[Majesty|His Majesty]]\n}}\n\n=== Titles and styles ===\n* '''22 October 1689 \u2013 1 December 1696''' ''[[His Highness]]'' the ''Most Serene'' Infante Jo\u00e3o of Portugal{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=21}}\n* '''1 December 1696 \u2013 9 December 1706''' ''[[His Royal Highness]]'' the [[Prince of Brazil]], [[Duke of Braganza]], etc.{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=21}}\n* '''9 December 1706 \u2013 23 December 1748''' ''[[Majesty|His Majesty]]'' the [[List of Portuguese monarchs|King of Portugal and the Algarves]]{{sfn|Soares de Azevedo|p=34}}\n* '''23 December 1748 - 31 July 1750''' ''[[Faithful Majesty|His Most Faithful Majesty]]'' the King of Portugal and the Algarves{{sfn|Nizza da Silva|p=26}}\n\nThe official styling of John as King of Portugal:<br>\n''By the Grace of God, Jo\u00e3o V, King of Portugal and the Algarves before and beyond the sea in Africa, Lord of Guinea and of Conquest, Navigation, and Commerce of Ethiopia, Arabia, Persia, and India, etc.''\n\n=== Honours ===\nAs monarch of Portugal, John V was Grand Master of the following Portuguese Orders:\n* [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]]\n* [[Order of Saint Benedict of Aviz]]\n* [[Order of Saint James of the Sword]]\n* [[Order of the Tower and Sword]]\n\n== Genealogy ==\n\n=== Ancestry ===\nThe ancestry of King John V:\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

From there it flows northeasterly to cross the Pennsylvania border just west of north [[Cheat Lake]] on its [[Cheat River]] tributary. Then it flows northerly across southwestern Pennsylvania, taking a bit of a detour northeast 10 miles south of Pittsburgh to approach Pittsburgh from the southeast and its confluence with the [[Allegheny River]] to form the [[Forks of the Ohio]] at \"The Point\" of [[Point State Park]] in [[Downtown Pittsburgh]].\n\n==Geology==\nPrior to early Pleistocene regional glaciation, more than 780,000 years ago, the ancestral Monongahela River (a.k.a. the Pittsburgh River) flowed northward from present-day north-central West Virginia, across western [[Pennsylvania]] and northwestern Ohio, and into the [[Saint Lawrence River]] watershed. One (or more) extensive ice sheet advance dammed the old north-flowing drainage and created a vast lake\u2014known as [[Lake Monongahela]]\u2014stretching from an unknown point north of present-day [[Beaver, Pennsylvania]] for ~{{convert|200|mi|km}} south to [[Weston, West Virginia]]. A river-lake with many narrow bays, its maximum water surface rose to {{convert|1100|ft|m}} above sea level. Over {{convert|200|ft|m}} deep in places, its southwestward overflow gradually incised old drainage divides and contributed to the geological development of the present-day upper [[Ohio River Valley]].<ref name=\"Garton2012\">{{cite journal |last1=Garton |first1=E.

It falls 3,831&nbsp;ft. in elevation from its forks to its mouth on the Ohio River.  The mean depth is about 20&nbsp;ft.\n\nIn southwestern Pennsylvania, the Monongahela is met by two major [[tributary|tributaries]]: the [[Cheat River]], which joins at [[Point Marion, Pennsylvania|Point Marion]], and the [[Youghiogheny River]], which joins at [[McKeesport, Pennsylvania|McKeesport]].\n\nMajor tributaries include: [[Becks Run]], [[Big Sandy Creek (Cheat River tributary)|Big Sandy Creek]], [[Buffalo Creek (Monongahela River tributary)|Buffalo Creek]], [[Cheat River]], [[Crooked Run (Monongahela River tributary)|Crooked Run]], [[Deckers Creek]], [[Dunkard Creek]], [[Lick Run (Peters Creek tributary)|Lick Run]], [[Middle Fork River]], [[Paw Paw Creek]], [[Peters Creek (Pennsylvania)|Peters Creek]], [[Streets Run]], [[Turtle Creek (Monongahela River tributary)|Turtle Creek]], [[Tygart Valley River]], [[West Fork River]], [[Youghiogheny River]].\n\n===Locks and dams===\n{{see also|List of dams and reservoirs in Pennsylvania}}\nThe river is navigable its entire length with a series of locks and dams that maintain a minimum depth of {{convert|9|ft|m|1}} to accommodate coal-laden barges.

It resulted in a sharp defeat for two thousand [[British Empire|British]] and [[Thirteen Colonies|Colonial]] forces against those of the [[France|French]] and their [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] allies.\n\nIn 1817, the Pennsylvania legislature authorized the Monongahela Navigation Company to build 16 dams with bypass [[lock (water transport)|locks]] to create a river transportation system between Pittsburgh and the area that would later become West Virginia.<ref>[http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=ascead&cc=ascead&rgn=main&view=text&didno=US-PPiU-dar193741 Monongahela Navigation Company Copybook], 1840-1897, DAR.1937.41, [[The Darlington Collection]], Special Collections Department, University of Pittsburgh</ref> Originally planned to run as far south as the Cheat River, the system was extended to Fairmont, and [[bituminous coal]] from West Virginia was the chief product transported downstream.

Then it flows northerly across southwestern Pennsylvania, taking a bit of a detour northeast 10 miles south of Pittsburgh to approach Pittsburgh from the southeast and its confluence with the [[Allegheny River]] to form the [[Forks of the Ohio]] at \"The Point\" of [[Point State Park]] in [[Downtown Pittsburgh]].\n\n==Geology==\nPrior to early Pleistocene regional glaciation, more than 780,000 years ago, the ancestral Monongahela River (a.k.a. the Pittsburgh River) flowed northward from present-day north-central West Virginia, across western [[Pennsylvania]] and northwestern Ohio, and into the [[Saint Lawrence River]] watershed. One (or more) extensive ice sheet advance dammed the old north-flowing drainage and created a vast lake\u2014known as [[Lake Monongahela]]\u2014stretching from an unknown point north of present-day [[Beaver, Pennsylvania]] for ~{{convert|200|mi|km}} south to [[Weston, West Virginia]]. A river-lake with many narrow bays, its maximum water surface rose to {{convert|1100|ft|m}} above sea level.

The 2008 film was directed by [[Steve Miner]] and written by [[Jeffrey Reddick]].\n\n''Day of the Dead'' (2008) was principally shot in [[Bulgaria]], with limited shooting in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. [[Tyler Bates]] provided the soundtrack, and screenwriter [[Jeffrey Reddick]] has a [[cameo appearance]] as an ill-fated [[police officer]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn May 2008, in [[Leadville, Colorado]], Trevor and his girlfriend, Nina, have a romantic encounter in an abandoned building. As they return to their respective parents' homes, they encounter a military [[roadblock]]. An angry man demands medical care for his child, revealing an outbreak has occurred. \n\nThe teens meet Captain Rhodes and Corporal Sarah Cross, Trevor\u2019s sister. Soon afterward, Privates Bud Crain and Salazar show up, and Bud immediately falls in love with Sarah. \n\nSarah and Bud visit her sick mother, and she visits her brother, Trevor. Sarah also visits Trevor's friend, Kyle, after she learns his symptoms are similar to her mother's.\n\nWhen Bud and Sarah arrive at Kyle's house, they find the mauled bodies of his parents stashed behind a curtain and Kyle missing. They radio Captain Rhodes and take Nina, Trevor, and their mother to the local hospital. There, Sarah talks to Dr. Logan at the urging of Rhodes, while out in the waiting room all the infected become catatonic. Bud runs to alert Sarah when all the infected suddenly reanimate. They turn into zombies, transforming while catatonic. They have superhuman strength that allows them to run, jump long distances, and crawl on the ceiling.\n\nNina and Trevor escape, seeking refuge in the local radio station. Captain Rhodes fights off the zombies before perishing. After becoming trapped in a storage room, Sarah, Dr. Logan, and Bud crawl through ceiling ducts into another room, where they find Salazar. Uninfected, he returns with them through the ducts to the storage room. The transformed Rhodes, also in the room, pursues them through the duct and nearly catches up with Sarah. Although she escapes, Rhodes bites Bud's hand as Bud replaces the ceiling grill.\n\nAfter dispatching Rhodes, the four escape from the hospital by jumping from the storeroom window into the car park, which is overrun with zombies. Here, they discover the zombies can be killed by shooting them in the head or setting them on fire. In the confusion, Dr. Logan deliberately pushes a non-infected girl into the path of the zombies and escapes in an abandoned vehicle.\n\nSarah, Bud, and Salazar win their battle with the zombies and drive away in a military vehicle. They make a stop at the gun store while Bud stays in the vehicle. \n\nWhen Sarah and Salazar return they find Bud has transformed. Instead of killing him, Sarah insists they take him with them, because Bud is restrained by plastic wrist-ties and poses no threat. \n\nSarah and Salazar hear Trevor call for help on the radio and go to the radio station to rescue his group. While driving there Sarah crashes into her zombified mother and kills her before rescuing Trevor and Nina from the radio station.\n\nThe group heads back to the abandoned warehouse. When Bud does not attack his friends, Sarah believes it is because he was a [[vegetarian]], but Salazar speculates Bud is attracted to Sarah. \n\nThe group finds an underground [[bunker]], where they reunite with Dr. Logan. They learn about a government project code name Wildfire directed by Dr. Engel, which means to create a neural virus to temporary shut down the nerves system to save cost of war during conflict. However, the virus accidentally mutated that turned the townspeople into zombies. The group explores the bunker, but Dr. Engel attacks and kills Logan.\n\nLater, Salazar is swarmed by zombies and - as he perishes - allows Sarah to escape and reunite with Trevor and Nina. While hiding, the trio finds several large gas cylinders. Sarah decides to lure the zombies into the storeroom and burn them with the cylinders. They begin modifying the cylinders into a giant flamethrower. \n\nSarah finds and attracts a mob of zombies. The zombified Dr. Engel drops down from the ceiling behind Sarah and grabs her, but before she is bitten, Bud shoots at Engel. This leads Engel and the other zombies to attack Bud, dismembering him. \n\nSarah  leads the zombies to the room where Trevor and Nina are hiding, and they torch the zombies. The three escape the bunker and drive off as a zombie suddenly jumps in front of the camera.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Mena Suvari]] as Corporal Sarah Cross/Bowman{{ref|surname|*}}\n* [[Nick Cannon]] as Private Salazar\n* [[Michael Welch (actor)|Michael Welch]] as Trevor Cross/Bowman{{ref|surname|*}}\n* [[AnnaLynne McCord]] as Nina\n* [[Stark Sands]] as Private Bud Crain\n* [[Matt Rippy]] as Dr. Logan\n* [[Ian McNeice]] as D.J.

Club]]|date=2013-11-27|accessdate=2015-03-06}}</ref> and it is the first of two remakes of the original 1985 film; the other is ''[[Day of the Dead: Bloodline]]'' (2018). The 2008 film was directed by [[Steve Miner]] and written by [[Jeffrey Reddick]].\n\n''Day of the Dead'' (2008) was principally shot in [[Bulgaria]], with limited shooting in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. [[Tyler Bates]] provided the soundtrack, and screenwriter [[Jeffrey Reddick]] has a [[cameo appearance]] as an ill-fated [[police officer]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn May 2008, in [[Leadville, Colorado]], Trevor and his girlfriend, Nina, have a romantic encounter in an abandoned building. As they return to their respective parents' homes, they encounter a military [[roadblock]]. An angry man demands medical care for his child, revealing an outbreak has occurred. \n\nThe teens meet Captain Rhodes and Corporal Sarah Cross, Trevor\u2019s sister. Soon afterward, Privates Bud Crain and Salazar show up, and Bud immediately falls in love with Sarah. \n\nSarah and Bud visit her sick mother, and she visits her brother, Trevor. Sarah also visits Trevor's friend, Kyle, after she learns his symptoms are similar to her mother's.\n\nWhen Bud and Sarah arrive at Kyle's house, they find the mauled bodies of his parents stashed behind a curtain and Kyle missing. They radio Captain Rhodes and take Nina, Trevor, and their mother to the local hospital. There, Sarah talks to Dr. Logan at the urging of Rhodes, while out in the waiting room all the infected become catatonic. Bud runs to alert Sarah when all the infected suddenly reanimate. They turn into zombies, transforming while catatonic. They have superhuman strength that allows them to run, jump long distances, and crawl on the ceiling.\n\nNina and Trevor escape, seeking refuge in the local radio station. Captain Rhodes fights off the zombies before perishing. After becoming trapped in a storage room, Sarah, Dr. Logan, and Bud crawl through ceiling ducts into another room, where they find Salazar. Uninfected, he returns with them through the ducts to the storage room. The transformed Rhodes, also in the room, pursues them through the duct and nearly catches up with Sarah. Although she escapes, Rhodes bites Bud's hand as Bud replaces the ceiling grill.\n\nAfter dispatching Rhodes, the four escape from the hospital by jumping from the storeroom window into the car park, which is overrun with zombies. Here, they discover the zombies can be killed by shooting them in the head or setting them on fire. In the confusion, Dr. Logan deliberately pushes a non-infected girl into the path of the zombies and escapes in an abandoned vehicle.\n\nSarah, Bud, and Salazar win their battle with the zombies and drive away in a military vehicle. They make a stop at the gun store while Bud stays in the vehicle. \n\nWhen Sarah and Salazar return they find Bud has transformed. Instead of killing him, Sarah insists they take him with them, because Bud is restrained by plastic wrist-ties and poses no threat. \n\nSarah and Salazar hear Trevor call for help on the radio and go to the radio station to rescue his group. While driving there Sarah crashes into her zombified mother and kills her before rescuing Trevor and Nina from the radio station.\n\nThe group heads back to the abandoned warehouse. When Bud does not attack his friends, Sarah believes it is because he was a [[vegetarian]], but Salazar speculates Bud is attracted to Sarah. \n\nThe group finds an underground [[bunker]], where they reunite with Dr. Logan. They learn about a government project directed by Dr. Engel, which accidentally created the virus that turned the townspeople into zombies. The group explores the bunker, but Dr. Engel attacks and kills Logan.\n\nLater, Salazar is swarmed by zombies and - as he perishes - allows Sarah to escape and reunite with Trevor and Nina. While hiding, the trio finds several large gas cylinders. Sarah decides to lure the zombies into the storeroom and burn them with the cylinders. They begin modifying the cylinders into a giant flamethrower. \n\nSarah finds and attracts a mob of zombies. The zombified Dr. Engel drops down from the ceiling behind Sarah and grabs her, but before she is bitten, Bud shoots at Engel. This leads Engel and the other zombies to attack Bud, dismembering him. \n\nSarah  leads the zombies to the room where Trevor and Nina are hiding, and they torch the zombies. The three escape the bunker and drive off as a zombie suddenly jumps in front of the camera.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Mena Suvari]] as Corporal Sarah Cross/Bowman{{ref|surname|*}}\n* [[Nick Cannon]] as Private Salazar\n* [[Michael Welch (actor)|Michael Welch]] as Trevor Cross/Bowman{{ref|surname|*}}\n* [[AnnaLynne McCord]] as Nina\n* [[Stark Sands]] as Private Bud Crain\n* [[Matt Rippy]] as Dr. Logan\n* [[Ian McNeice]] as D.J.
