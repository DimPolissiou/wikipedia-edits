Biomass can refer to ''species biomass'', which is the mass of one or more species, or to ''community biomass'', which is the mass of all species in the community. It can include [[microorganisms]], plants or animals.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=biomass|file=B00660}}</ref> The mass can be expressed as the average mass per unit area, or as the total mass in the community.\n\nHow biomass is measured depends on why it is being measured. Sometimes, the biomass is regarded as the natural mass of organisms ''in situ'', just as they are. For example, in a salmon [[fishery]], the salmon biomass might be regarded as the total wet weight the salmon would have if they were taken out of the water. In other contexts, biomass can be measured in terms of the dried organic mass, so perhaps only 30% of the actual weight might count, the rest being water. For other purposes, only biological tissues count, and teeth, bones and shells are excluded. In some applications, biomass is measured as the mass of [[Organic carbon|organically bound carbon]] (C) that is present.\n\nThe total live biomass on [[Earth]] is about 550\u2013560 billion tonnes C,<ref name=\"Bar-On\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bar-On YM, Phillips R, Milo R | title = The biomass distribution on Earth | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 115 | issue = 25 | pages = 6506\u20136511 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 29784790 | pmc = 6016768 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1711842115 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/05/15/1711842115.full.pdf | bibcode = 1998PNAS...95.6578W }}</ref><ref name=Groombridge/> and the total annual [[primary production]] of biomass is just over 100 billion tonnes C/yr.<ref name=Behrenfeld /> The total live biomass of bacteria may be as much as that of plants and animals<ref name=\"Whitman etal\" /> or may be much less.<ref name=\"Bar-On\"/><ref name=Kallmeyer /><ref name=\"EA-20181211\" /><ref name=\"SA-20181211\" /><ref name=\"TI-20181211\" /> The total number of [[DNA]] [[base pair]]s on Earth, as a possible approximation of [[global biodiversity]], is estimated at {{val|5.3|3.6|e=37}}, and weighs 50 billion [[tonne]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Landenmark HK, Forgan DH, Cockell CS | title = An Estimate of the Total DNA in the Biosphere | journal = PLOS Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = e1002168 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26066900 | pmc = 4466264 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002168 }}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-20150718-rn\">{{cite news |last=Nuwer |first=Rachel | name-list-format = vanc |date=18 July 2015 |title=Counting All the DNA on Earth |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/21/science/counting-all-the-dna-on-earth.html |work=The New York Times |location=New York |publisher=The New York Times Company |issn=0362-4331 |access-date=2015-07-18}}</ref><!--- PLOS paper cited by NYT used 'tonne' unit. ---> \n\n==Ecological pyramids==\n[[File:Ecological Pyramid.svg|thumb|320px|An [[energy pyramid]] illustrates how much energy is needed as it flows upward to support the next trophic level. Only about 10% of the energy transferred between each trophic level is converted to biomass.]]\n{{Main|Ecological pyramid}}\n\nAn ecological pyramid is a graphical representation that shows, for a given [[ecosystem]], the relationship between biomass or [[primary production|biological productivity]] and [[trophic level]]s.\n\n* A ''biomass pyramid'' shows the amount of biomass at each trophic level.\n* A ''productivity pyramid'' shows the [[Primary production|production]] or [[Trophic dynamics|turn-over]] in biomass at each trophic level.\n\nAn ecological pyramid provides a snapshot in time of an [[biocoenosis|ecological community]].\n\nThe bottom of the pyramid represents the primary producers ([[autotroph]]s). The primary producers take energy from the environment in the form of sunlight or inorganic chemicals and use it to create energy-rich molecules such as carbohydrates. This mechanism is called [[primary production]]. The pyramid then proceeds through the various trophic levels to the [[apex predator]]s at the top.\n\nWhen energy is transferred from one trophic level to the next, typically only ten percent is used to build new biomass. The remaining ninety percent goes to metabolic processes or is dissipated as heat. This energy loss means that productivity pyramids are never inverted, and generally limits food chains to about six levels. However, in oceans, biomass pyramids can be wholly or partially inverted, with more biomass at higher levels.\n\n==Terrestrial biomass==\n\nTerrestrial biomass generally decreases markedly at each higher [[trophic level]] (plants, herbivores, carnivores). Examples of terrestrial [[Autotroph|producers]] are grasses, trees and shrubs. These have a much higher biomass than the animals that [[Heterotroph|consume them]], such as deer, zebras and insects. The level with the least biomass are the highest [[predator]]s in the [[food chain]], such as foxes and eagles.\n\nIn a temperate grassland, grasses and other plants are the primary producers at the bottom of the pyramid. Then come the primary consumers, such as grasshoppers, voles and bison, followed by the secondary consumers, shrews, hawks and small cats. Finally the tertiary consumers, large cats and wolves. The biomass pyramid decreases markedly at each higher level.\n\n==Ocean biomass==\n{{marine food chain}}\n{{see also|Marine life}}\n\nOcean or marine biomass, in a reversal of terrestrial biomass, can increase at higher trophic levels. In the ocean, the food chain typically starts with phytoplankton, and follows the course:\n<blockquote>\nPhytoplankton \u2192 zooplankton \u2192 predatory zooplankton \u2192 [[filter feeder]]s \u2192 predatory fish\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Arctic food web.svg|thumb|320px|left| {{center|[[Ocean food web]] showing a network of food chains}}]]\n[[File:Numbers Pyramid.svg|thumb|250px| {{center|'''[[Biomass pyramid]]s'''<br />Compared to terrestrial biomass pyramids, aquatic pyramids are inverted at the base}}]]\n[[File:Prochlorococcus marinus (cropped).jpg|thumb|150px| {{center|''[[Prochlorococcus]]'', an influential bacterium}}]]\n\n[[Phytoplankton]] are the main [[primary producer]]s at the bottom of the marine [[food chain]]. Phytoplankton use [[photosynthesis]] to convert inorganic carbon into [[protoplasm]]. They are then consumed by microscopic animals called zooplankton.\n\n[[Zooplankton]] comprise the second level in the food chain, and includes small [[crustacean]]s, such as [[copepod]]s and [[krill]], and the [[larva]] of fish, squid, lobsters and crabs.\n\nIn turn, small zooplankton are consumed by both larger predatory zooplankters, such as [[krill]], and by [[forage fish]], which are small, schooling, [[filter feeding|filter-feeding]] fish. This makes up the third level in the food chain.\n\nA fourth trophic level can consist of predatory fish, marine mammals and seabirds that consume forage fish. Examples are [[swordfish]], [[Pinniped|seals]] and [[gannet]]s.\n\nApex predators, such as [[orca]]s, which can consume seals, and [[shortfin mako shark]]s, which can consume swordfish, make up a fifth trophic level. [[Baleen whale]]s can consume zooplankton and krill directly, leading to a food chain with only three or four trophic levels.\n\nMarine environments can have inverted biomass pyramids. In particular, the biomass of consumers (copepods, krill, shrimp, forage fish) is larger than the biomass of primary producers. This happens because the ocean's primary producers are tiny phytoplankton which are [[r-strategists]] that grow and reproduce rapidly, so a small mass can have a fast rate of primary production. In contrast, terrestrial primary producers, such as forests, are   [[K-strategists]] that grow and reproduce slowly, so a much larger mass is needed to achieve the same rate of primary production.\n\nAmong the phytoplankton at the base of the [[marine food web]] are members from a phylum of bacteria called [[cyanobacteria]]. Marine cyanobacteria include the smallest known [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] organisms. The smallest of all, ''[[Prochlorococcus]]'', is just 0.5 to 0.8 micrometres across.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kettler GC, Martiny AC, Huang K, Zucker J, Coleman ML, Rodrigue S, Chen F, Lapidus A, Ferriera S, Johnson J, Steglich C, Church GM, Richardson P, Chisholm SW | title = Patterns and implications of gene gain and loss in the evolution of Prochlorococcus | journal = PLOS Genetics | volume = 3 | issue = 12 | pages = e231 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18159947 | pmc = 2151091 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0030231 }}</ref> In terms of individual numbers, Prochlorococcus is possibly the most plentiful [[species]] on Earth: a single millilitre of surface seawater can contain 100,000 cells or more.

Sometimes, the biomass is regarded as the natural mass of organisms ''in situ'', just as they are. For example, in a salmon [[fishery]], the salmon biomass might be regarded as the total wet weight the salmon would have if they were taken out of the water. In other contexts, biomass can be measured in terms of the dried organic mass, so perhaps only 30% of the actual weight might count, the rest being water. For other purposes, only biological tissues count, and teeth, bones and shells are excluded. In some applications, biomass is measured as the mass of [[Organic carbon|organically bound carbon]] (C) that is present.\n\nThe total live biomass on [[Earth]] is about 550\u2013560 billion tonnes C,<ref name=\"Bar-On\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bar-On YM, Phillips R, Milo R | title = The biomass distribution on Earth | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 115 | issue = 25 | pages = 6506\u20136511 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 29784790 | pmc = 6016768 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1711842115 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/05/15/1711842115.full.pdf | bibcode = 1998PNAS...95.6578W }}</ref><ref name=Groombridge/> and the total annual [[primary production]] of biomass is just over 100 billion tonnes C/yr.<ref name=Behrenfeld /> The total live biomass of bacteria may be as much as that of plants and animals<ref name=\"Whitman etal\" /> or may be much less.<ref name=\"Bar-On\"/><ref name=Kallmeyer /><ref name=\"EA-20181211\" /><ref name=\"SA-20181211\" /><ref name=\"TI-20181211\" /> The total number of [[DNA]] [[base pair]]s on Earth, as a possible approximation of [[global biodiversity]], is estimated at {{val|5.3|3.6|e=37}}, and weighs 50 billion [[tonne]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Landenmark HK, Forgan DH, Cockell CS | title = An Estimate of the Total DNA in the Biosphere | journal = PLOS Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = e1002168 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26066900 | pmc = 4466264 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002168 }}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-20150718-rn\">{{cite news |last=Nuwer |first=Rachel | name-list-format = vanc |date=18 July 2015 |title=Counting All the DNA on Earth |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/21/science/counting-all-the-dna-on-earth.html |work=The New York Times |location=New York |publisher=The New York Times Company |issn=0362-4331 |access-date=2015-07-18}}</ref><!--- PLOS paper cited by NYT used 'tonne' unit. ---> \n\n==Ecological pyramids==\n[[File:Ecological Pyramid.svg|thumb|320px|An [[energy pyramid]] illustrates how much energy is needed as it flows upward to support the next trophic level. Only about 10% of the energy transferred between each trophic level is converted to biomass.]]\n{{Main|Ecological pyramid}}\n\nAn ecological pyramid is a graphical representation that shows, for a given [[ecosystem]], the relationship between biomass or [[primary production|biological productivity]] and [[trophic level]]s.\n\n* A ''biomass pyramid'' shows the amount of biomass at each trophic level.\n* A ''productivity pyramid'' shows the [[Primary production|production]] or [[Trophic dynamics|turn-over]] in biomass at each trophic level.\n\nAn ecological pyramid provides a snapshot in time of an [[biocoenosis|ecological community]].\n\nThe bottom of the pyramid represents the primary producers ([[autotroph]]s). The primary producers take energy from the environment in the form of sunlight or inorganic chemicals and use it to create energy-rich molecules such as carbohydrates. This mechanism is called [[primary production]]. The pyramid then proceeds through the various trophic levels to the [[apex predator]]s at the top.\n\nWhen energy is transferred from one trophic level to the next, typically only ten percent is used to build new biomass. The remaining ninety percent goes to metabolic processes or is dissipated as heat. This energy loss means that productivity pyramids are never inverted, and generally limits food chains to about six levels. However, in oceans, biomass pyramids can be wholly or partially inverted, with more biomass at higher levels.\n\n==Terrestrial biomass==\n\nTerrestrial biomass generally decreases markedly at each higher [[trophic level]] (plants, herbivores, carnivores). Examples of terrestrial [[Autotroph|producers]] are grasses, trees and shrubs. These have a much higher biomass than the animals that [[Heterotroph|consume them]], such as deer, zebras and insects. The level with the least biomass are the highest [[predator]]s in the [[food chain]], such as foxes and eagles.\n\nIn a temperate grassland, grasses and other plants are the primary producers at the bottom of the pyramid. Then come the primary consumers, such as grasshoppers, voles and bison, followed by the secondary consumers, shrews, hawks and small cats. Finally the tertiary consumers, large cats and wolves. The biomass pyramid decreases markedly at each higher level.\n\n==Ocean biomass==\n{{marine food chain}}\n{{see also|Marine life}}\n\nOcean or marine biomass, in a reversal of terrestrial biomass, can increase at higher trophic levels. In the ocean, the food chain typically starts with phytoplankton, and follows the course:\n<blockquote>\nPhytoplankton \u2192 zooplankton \u2192 predatory zooplankton \u2192 [[filter feeder]]s \u2192 predatory fish\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Arctic food web.svg|thumb|320px|left| {{center|[[Ocean food web]] showing a network of food chains}}]]\n[[File:Numbers Pyramid.svg|thumb|250px| {{center|'''[[Biomass pyramid]]s'''<br />Compared to terrestrial biomass pyramids, aquatic pyramids are inverted at the base}}]]\n[[File:Prochlorococcus marinus (cropped).jpg|thumb|150px| {{center|''[[Prochlorococcus]]'', an influential bacterium}}]]\n\n[[Phytoplankton]] are the main [[primary producer]]s at the bottom of the marine [[food chain]]. Phytoplankton use [[photosynthesis]] to convert inorganic carbon into [[protoplasm]]. They are then consumed by microscopic animals called zooplankton.\n\n[[Zooplankton]] comprise the second level in the food chain, and includes small [[crustacean]]s, such as [[copepod]]s and [[krill]], and the [[larva]] of fish, squid, lobsters and crabs.\n\nIn turn, small zooplankton are consumed by both larger predatory zooplankters, such as [[krill]], and by [[forage fish]], which are small, schooling, [[filter feeding|filter-feeding]] fish. This makes up the third level in the food chain.\n\nA fourth trophic level can consist of predatory fish, marine mammals and seabirds that consume forage fish. Examples are [[swordfish]], [[Pinniped|seals]] and [[gannet]]s.\n\nApex predators, such as [[orca]]s, which can consume seals, and [[shortfin mako shark]]s, which can consume swordfish, make up a fifth trophic level. [[Baleen whale]]s can consume zooplankton and krill directly, leading to a food chain with only three or four trophic levels.\n\nMarine environments can have inverted biomass pyramids. In particular, the biomass of consumers (copepods, krill, shrimp, forage fish) is larger than the biomass of primary producers. This happens because the ocean's primary producers are tiny phytoplankton which are [[r-strategists]] that grow and reproduce rapidly, so a small mass can have a fast rate of primary production. In contrast, terrestrial primary producers, such as forests, are   [[K-strategists]] that grow and reproduce slowly, so a much larger mass is needed to achieve the same rate of primary production.\n\nAmong the phytoplankton at the base of the [[marine food web]] are members from a phylum of bacteria called [[cyanobacteria]]. Marine cyanobacteria include the smallest known [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] organisms. The smallest of all, ''[[Prochlorococcus]]'', is just 0.5 to 0.8 micrometres across.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kettler GC, Martiny AC, Huang K, Zucker J, Coleman ML, Rodrigue S, Chen F, Lapidus A, Ferriera S, Johnson J, Steglich C, Church GM, Richardson P, Chisholm SW | title = Patterns and implications of gene gain and loss in the evolution of Prochlorococcus | journal = PLOS Genetics | volume = 3 | issue = 12 | pages = e231 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18159947 | pmc = 2151091 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0030231 }}</ref> In terms of individual numbers, Prochlorococcus is possibly the most plentiful [[species]] on Earth: a single millilitre of surface seawater can contain 100,000 cells or more.

This unification with Serbia would last, through various successor states, for almost 88 years, until finally coming to an end in 2006.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of Montenegro}}\n\nPrince [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Nicholas of Montenegro]] proclaimed the Kingdom of Montenegro in [[Cetinje]] on 28 August 1910, elevating the country from the rank of Principality. King Nicholas I had ruled the country as [[Prince]] since 1860, and had initiated several modernising reforms at the beginning of the 20th century, such as introducing a constitution and a new currency, the [[Montenegrin perper]].\n\nMontenegro joined the [[First Balkan War]] in 1912, hoping to win a share in the last Ottoman-controlled areas of [[Rumelia]]. Montenegro did make further territorial gains by splitting [[Sand\u017eak]] with [[Serbia]] on 30 May 1913. But the Montenegrins had to abandon the newly captured city of \u0130\u015fkodra (''Skadar'' in Serbian, modern-day [[Shkod\u00ebr]]) to the [[Provisional Government of Albania|new state of Albania]] in May 1913, at the insistence of the [[Great Powers]], despite the Montenegrins having invested 10,000 lives into the capture of the town (April 1913) from the Ottoman-Albanian forces of [[Essad Pasha Toptani|Esad Pasha]]. Essad Pasha made a deal to surrender the town to the Montenegrins in exchange for Montenegro supporting his claims in Central Albania. However, as Shkod\u00ebr and the surroundings had a large ethnic Albanian majority, the area went to the state of Albania instead.\n\nWhen the [[Second Balkan War]] broke out in June 1913, Serbia fought against Bulgaria, and King Nicholas sided with Serbia.\n\nDuring [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918) [[Montenegro]] allied itself with the [[Triple Entente]], in line with King Nicholas' pro-Serbian policy. Accordingly, [[Austria-Hungary]] occupied Montenegro from 15 January 1916 to October 1918.\n\nOn 20 July 1917, the signing of the [[Corfu Declaration]] foreshadowed the unification of Montenegro with Serbia. On 26 November 1918, [[Podgorica Assembly]], an elected body claiming to represent Montenegrin people, unanimously adopted a resolution deposing king [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Nicholas I]] (who was still in exile) and unifying Montenegro with Serbia. Upon this event Nicholas I, who had previously supported unification with [[Serbia]] into a greater state with his dynasty playing the pivotal role, switched to promoting [[Montenegrin nationalism]] and opposing the union with Serbia, a position he maintained until his death in France in 1921.\n\nOn 1 December 1918, the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] was created, where both Serbia and Montenegro were parts.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the occupying forces in Yugoslavia considered turning the [[Italian governorate of Montenegro]] into a puppet kingdom, but nothing came of these plans.\n\n==Rulers==\n\n===King of Montenegro (1910\u20131918)===\n{{See also|List of rulers of Montenegro}}\n*[[Nicholas I of Montenegro]] (1910\u20131918)\n\n===Prime Ministers (1910\u20131916)===\n{{See also|Prime Minister of Montenegro}}\n*[[Lazar Tomanovi\u0107]] (1910\u20131912)\n*[[Mitar Martinovi\u0107]] (1912\u20131913)\n*[[Janko Vukoti\u0107]] (1913\u20131915)\n*Milo Matanovi\u0107 (1915\u20131916)\n*[[Lazar Miju\u0161kovi\u0107]] (1916)\n\n===Prime Ministers in-exile (1916\u20131922)===\n*[[Lazar Miju\u0161kovi\u0107]] (1916)\n*[[Andrija Radovi\u0107]] (1916\u20131917)\n*Milo Matanovi\u0107 (1917)\n*[[Evgenije Popovi\u0107]] (1917\u20131919)\n*[[Jovan Plamenac]] (1919\u20131921)\n*[[Anto Gvozdenovi\u0107]] (1921\u20131922)\n*[[Milutin Vu\u010dini\u0107]] (1922)\n*[[Anto Gvozdenovi\u0107]] (1922)\n\n==Gallery==\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:Flag of Montenegro (1905-1918 & 1941-1944).svg|[[Civil flag|Civil]] [[Flag of Montenegro|flag of the Kingdom of Montenegro]]\nFile:Montenegro1913.png|The Kingdom of Montenegro in 1913\nFile:Proclamation of the Kingdom of Montenegro.jpg|Proclamation of the Kingdom of Montenegro, 28 August 1910\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of Montenegro]]\n*[[Principality of Montenegro]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal|title=King Nikola and the territorial expansion of Montenegro, 1914-1920|author=\u017divojinovi\u0107 Dragoljub R.|journal=Balcanica |year=2014 |volume=45 |issue= |pages=353\u2013368|url=http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/ft.aspx?id=0350-76531445353Z}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{commons category inline|Kingdom of Montenegro}}\n*[http://www.terra.es/personal7/jqvaraderey/193818BK.GIF Kingdom of Montenegro in 1918]\n*[http://terkepek.adatbank.transindex.ro/kepek/netre/106.gif Map]\n*[http://terkepek.adatbank.transindex.ro/kepek/netre/330.gif Map]\n*[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Montenegro.html Montenegro] -

Upon this event Nicholas I, who had previously supported unification with [[Serbia]] into a greater state with his dynasty playing the pivotal role, switched to promoting [[Montenegrin nationalism]] and opposing the union with Serbia, a position he maintained until his death in France in 1921.\n\nOn 1 December 1918, the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] was created, where both Serbia and Montenegro were parts.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the occupying forces in Yugoslavia considered turning the [[Italian governorate of Montenegro]] into a puppet kingdom, but nothing came of these plans.\n\n==Rulers==\n\n===King of Montenegro (1910\u20131918)===\n{{See also|List of rulers of Montenegro}}\n*[[Nicholas I of Montenegro]] (1910\u20131918)\n\n===Prime Ministers (1910\u20131916)===\n{{See also|Prime Minister of Montenegro}}\n*[[Lazar Tomanovi\u0107]] (1910\u20131912)\n*[[Mitar Martinovi\u0107]] (1912\u20131913)\n*[[Janko Vukoti\u0107]] (1913\u20131915)\n*Milo Matanovi\u0107 (1915\u20131916)\n*[[Lazar Miju\u0161kovi\u0107]] (1916)\n\n===Prime Ministers in-exile (1916\u20131922)===\n*[[Lazar Miju\u0161kovi\u0107]] (1916)\n*[[Andrija Radovi\u0107]] (1916\u20131917)\n*Milo Matanovi\u0107 (1917)\n*[[Evgenije Popovi\u0107]] (1917\u20131919)\n*[[Jovan Plamenac]] (1919\u20131921)\n*[[Anto Gvozdenovi\u0107]] (1921\u20131922)\n*[[Milutin Vu\u010dini\u0107]] (1922)\n*[[Anto Gvozdenovi\u0107]] (1922)\n\n==Gallery==\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:Flag of Montenegro (1905-1918 & 1941-1944).svg|[[Civil flag|Civil]] [[Flag of Montenegro|flag of the Kingdom of Montenegro]]\nFile:Montenegro1913.png|The Kingdom of Montenegro in 1913\nFile:Proclamation of the Kingdom of Montenegro.jpg|Proclamation of the Kingdom of Montenegro, 28 August 1910\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of Montenegro]]\n*[[Principality of Montenegro]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal|title=King Nikola and the territorial expansion of Montenegro, 1914-1920|author=\u017divojinovi\u0107 Dragoljub R.|journal=Balcanica |year=2014 |volume=45 |issue= |pages=353\u2013368|url=http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/ft.aspx?id=0350-76531445353Z}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{commons category inline|Kingdom of Montenegro}}\n*[http://www.terra.es/personal7/jqvaraderey/193818BK.GIF Kingdom of Montenegro in 1918]\n*[http://terkepek.adatbank.transindex.ro/kepek/netre/106.gif Map]\n*[http://terkepek.adatbank.transindex.ro/kepek/netre/330.gif Map]\n*[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Montenegro.html Montenegro] - World Statesmen\n\n{{Clear}}\n{{Montenegro topics |collapsed}}\n{{Former Monarchies}}\n{{Yug-timeline}}\n\n{{coord|42.6333|N|19.5333|E|source:kolossus-kowiki|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kingdom of Montenegro}}\n[[Category:Kingdom of Montenegro| ]]\n[[Category:1910s in Montenegro|*]]\n[[Category:Former countries in the Balkans]]\n[[Category:Former kingdoms|Montenegro, Kingdom of]]\n[[Category:Former Slavic countries|Montenegro, Kingdom of]]\n[[Category:1910s establishments in Montenegro]]\n[[Category:1916 disestablishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:1918 disestablishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:1922 disestablishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1910]]\n[[Category:States and territories disestablished in 1918]]\n[[Category:1910 establishments in Europe]]\n", "name_user": "80.80.37.68", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Montenegro"}
{"title_page": "Music of Final Fantasy XV", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=December 2017}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Music of ''Final Fantasy XV''}}\n{{Music of Final Fantasy}}\nThe music for the video game ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]'', developed and published by [[Square Enix]] as the fifteenth mainline entry in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series, was composed primarily by [[Yoko Shimomura]]. Having previously worked on the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series, among various other titles, ''Final Fantasy XV'' was her first project for the series. Shimomura was brought on board the project in 2006, when it was a spin-off title called ''Final Fantasy Versus XIII'',{{efn|{{Nihongo||\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30ca\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30bf\u30b8\u30fc\u30f4\u30a7\u30eb\u30b5\u30b9XIII|Fainaru Fantaj\u012b Verusasu S\u0101t\u012bn}}}} and stayed in her role during the game's ten-year [[Development of Final Fantasy XV|development cycle]]. Her music, based around themes of \"friendship\" and \"filial bonds\", incorporates multiple musical genres, such as orchestral, [[bossa nova]], and [[Blues|American blues]]. Several tracks, including the main theme \"Somnus\", feature [[Latin]] lyrics written by the game's original director [[Tetsuya Nomura]].\n\n''Final Fantasy XV'' was expanded into a multimedia project dubbed the \"''Final Fantasy XV'' Universe\", for which other composers were hired; [[John R. Graham (composer)|John R. Graham]] composed the music for the film ''[[Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV]]'', with additional tunes from Shimomura. Yasuhisa Inoue and Susumi Akizuki of Righttrack wrote the music for the [[original net animation]] ''[[Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV|Brotherhood]]'', while a team from the music studio Unique Note, who also worked on the base game, handled the mobile spin-off title ''Justice Monsters V''. English indie rock band [[Florence and the Machine]] collaborated on three songs for the game, including a [[Cover version|cover]] of [[Ben E. King]]'s \"[[Stand by Me (Ben E. King song)|Stand by Me]]\", which acted as the official theme song. Later contributors to the soundtrack, via [[downloadable content]] packs, were [[Keiichi Okabe]], [[Naoshi Mizuta]], [[Yasunori Mitsuda]], [[Nobuo Uematsu]], Tadayoshi Makino, and [[Taku Iwasaki]].\n\nMultiple albums have been released containing music from ''Final Fantasy XV'' and its spin-off media. ''Final Fantasy XV Original Soundtrack'' released in December 2016 in multiple versions, including a four-disc CD release, a Blu-ray release with additional tracks, and a special edition. The standard four-disc release was published internationally in 2017 by [[Sony Classical Records]]. The score for ''Kingsglaive'' released in September 2016 as a two-disc CD. Other releases include a digital album for ''Justice Monsters V'' in September 2016, and limited digital albums for both ''Kingsglaive'' and ''Platinum Demo'', a commercial demo acting as a prequel to ''Final Fantasy XV''. The songs from Florence and the Machine were released in August 2016 as digital singles under the banner title \"Songs from ''Final Fantasy XV''\". Reception of the albums was generally positive, with the main soundtrack album and Welch's tracks reaching high positions on music charts.\n\n==Creation and development==\n\n===''Final Fantasy XV''===\n[[File:Yoko Shimomura.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Yoko Shimomura]] served as the lead composer for ''Final Fantasy XV'', writing around 80% of the soundtrack.]]\nThe musical score for the [[action role-playing game]] ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]'', originally a spin-off game called ''Final Fantasy Versus XIII'', was composed primarily by [[Yoko Shimomura]], whose previous work included ''[[Parasite Eve]]'', ''[[Legend of Mana]]'', and the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series.<ref name=\"FNCtranslation\"/><ref name=\"PSblogMusic\"/> ''Final Fantasy XV'' was her first time composing for the ''Final Fantasy'' series, so she took a more tentative approach than her ''Kingdom Hearts'' projects.<ref name=\"RPGshimomura\"/> Shimomura was involved with the project when ''XV'' was still titled ''Versus XIII'', being hired to composed the music in 2006 and staying on through its ten-year [[Development of Final Fantasy XV|development cycle]].<ref name=\"EngShimInterview\"/> In 2010, Shimomura was still forming a framework for the game's music, ensuring that the music fitted the game without it solidifying into an image that seemed wrong.<ref name=\"AndriaShimomura\"/> Her work over the time prior to its rebranding as ''Final Fantasy XV'' was fairly sporadic.<ref name=\"EngShimInterview\"/> Shimomura worked on around 80% of the music: the rest were variations on her work and other themes created by others involved in the soundtrack.<ref name=\"FamTabShimomura\"/> Other composers who worked on the game were [[Tetsuya Shibata]], [[Yoshino Aoki]], Yoshitaka Suzuki and Mitsuhiro Ohta; the latter two assisted with arrangements.<ref name=\"FamShimInterviewOST\"/>\n\nThe first track created by Shimomura for the game was \"Somnus\", at that time the official theme song.<ref name=\"PSblogMusic\"/><ref name=\"EngShimInterview\"/> \"Somnus\" was sung by Aundr\u00e9a L. Hopkins; its lyrics were written by original director [[Tetsuya Nomura]], which were translated and adapted into [[Latin]] by Taro Yamashita and Kazuhiro Komiya.<ref name=\"SomnusLyrics\"/> According to Nomura, the title, which translates from Latin to \"Sleep\", reflects the subject matter and real-world themes.<ref name=\"GemNomuraLatin\"/> An instrumental version was also created for use in ''Final Fantasy XV'', having been recorded at around the same time as the vocal version.<ref name=\"FamShimInterviewOST\"/> When ''Versus XIII'' was rebranded as ''XV'', \"Somnus\" was retained as the game's main theme, though it was replaced as the official theme song.<ref name=\"16QuestionsE3\"/>{{efn|Quote from ''Gematsu'':<br/>'''Tabata:''' \"Stand by Me\" is now the official song, but \"Somnus\" is still in the game and used in a very important way.<ref name=\"16QuestionsE3\"/>}} Another long-standing track was \"Omnis Lacrima\". Translating to \"All the Tears\", it was featured in trailers for both ''Versus XIII'' and ''Final Fantasy XV''.<ref name=\"JPGomnis\"/><ref name=\"OSTlinersMemoria\"/> The lyrics for both \"Omnis Lacrima\" and other ''Final Fantasy XV'' tracks using Latin vocals were written by Nomura and translated by Yamashita.<ref name=\"OSTlinersXV\"/><ref name=\"FFDost\"/> Nomura credited the high use of Latin to his wish for a language that was no longer used on a daily basis and that people \"won't be able to understand and yet appreciate\", desiring a sense of general equality.<ref name=\"GemNomuraLatin\"/>\n\nThe game's music was designed to encompass themes of \"friendship\" and \"filial bonds\".<ref name=\"FamTabShimomura\"/> Initially, due to its status as a spin-off, Shimomura did not feel the same amount of pressure to conform to the legacy of previous composers. By the time the game changed from ''Versus XIII'' to ''XV'', she had a clear idea of what the score would be like and so felt minimal reservations despite the game now being part of the main series.<ref name=\"PSblogMusic\"/> At the same time, she felt the need to respect the work of earlier composers such as [[Nobuo Uematsu]] while staying true to the series' legacy of musical variety.<ref name=\"EngShimInterview\"/><ref name=\"FamShimComment\"/> Despite the ten year development, the musical concepts Shimomura worked from did not change much: she constantly aimed at creating a darker score than other ''Final Fantasy'' titles.<ref name=\"PSblogMusic\"/><ref name=\"EngShimInterview\"/> Ultimately, only a third of Shimomura's completed work for ''Versus XIII'' was carried over into ''Final Fantasy XV''.<ref name=\"EdgeFeature\"/>\n\nNew elements were added when the game became ''Final Fantasy XV'', but that was to suit the new elements being introduced rather than overwriting previous work.<ref name=\"PSblogMusic\"/> In contrast to her work with Nomura, Shimomura's tracks were quickly approved by Tabata, who only later requested changes or revisions.<ref name=\"EdgeFeature\"/> The score combined multiple music genres: apart from Shimomura's typical classical style, she also incorporated other styles such as [[Bossa nova]] and [[Blues|American Blues]] for certain locations.<ref name=\"EngShimInterview\"/> For his work on the game, Suzuki drew on his work on the ''[[Metal Gear]]'' series, though he watched gameplay videos rather than cutscenes for his work on ''Final Fantasy XV''.<ref name=\"XVsilInterview\"/> The music was performed and recorded in Boston by the [[Video Game Orchestra]], a North American orchestra specializing in video game music whose first ''Final Fantasy'' project had been ''[[Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII]]'' in 2013.<ref name=\"OSTlinersXV\"/><ref name=\"DuscaeBehind\"/> The orchestra's founder Shota Nakama helped with orchestration and arrangements for the soundtrack, in addition to composing the track \"Bros on the Road\".<ref name=\"FFDost\"/> Nakama began working on the game in 2014, first working on tracks for promotional trailers.<ref name=\"XVsilInterview\"/>\n\nDuring development, Shimomura discussed her music with the game's other developers so it fit the game's world, along with reading the story.<ref name=\"RPGshimomura\"/> Many of the tracks began as requests from the writers, and for some pieces there was a lot of consultation with staff including director [[Hajime Tabata]] while they were being written.<ref name=\"EngShimInterview\"/><ref name=\"FamShimComment\"/> Several tracks were meant to emote specific moods. For \"Luna\", the theme for the character [[Characters of Final Fantasy XV#Lunafreya Nox Fleuret|Lunafreya Nox Fleuret]], Shimomura used the character's beauty and strength as inspiration; for the titular theme of main protagonist [[Noctis Lucis Caelum]], she chose to represent the weight of destiny upon him and his inner thoughts, creating a soft piece that portrayed his emotions.<ref name=\"AbbyInfo\"/> The theme \"Apocalypsis Noctis\" was intended to be both magnificent and intense, while the track \"Melancolia\" was meant to evoke sadness.<ref name=\"FamShimInterviewOST\"/> The music had to include tracks for various times of day due to the game's day-night cycle.<ref name=\"PSblogMusic\"/> Uematsu's \"Main Theme\", a recurring theme within the ''Final Fantasy'' series, also appeared in an arranged form created by Shimomura and Nakama. Another recurring theme in the series, Uematsu's \"[[Chocobo]]\" theme, was remixed by Ohta for the tracks \"Blues de Chocobo\" and \"Rodeo de Chocobo\".<ref name=\"FFDost\"/>\n\nConcerning tracks related to times of day and elements such as battle themes, Shimomura allowed the flow of gameplay to dictate the flow of her music, which required putting in a number of natural transition points within pieces so the break would be smooth.<ref name=\"PSblogMusic\"/> To help with this, a special software tool called MAGI (Music API for Gaming Interaction) was developed to manage the tempo and create sync points that allowed the music's flow to be interactive while keeping its \"epic\" sound and scope.<ref name=\"XVmagi\"/><ref name=\"FamSoundInterview\"/> When the game began development as ''Versus XIII'' it used the same sound environment as ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]'', but with the move to new hardware the sound team needed to design a new sound environment. To develop the sound software, the team partnered with [[CRI Middleware]] to integrate the company's CRI ADX 2 middleware into the game's native sound environment. The amount of sound data, which also included 300 tracks of standalone music and 150 tracks of environmental music, required for the game was so large that there were fears it would not fit onto the game disc alongside the rest of the game data.<ref name=\"FamSoundInterview\"/>\n\n===Theme songs===\n[[File:Florence and the Machine (22117304699).jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Florence Welch]] (pictured 2015) sang the game's theme songs, while her band [[Florence and the Machine]] performed them.]]\nThe game's theme song is a [[Cover version|cover]] of [[Ben E. King]]'s \"[[Stand by Me (Ben E. King song)|Stand by Me]]\", performed by the English indie rock band [[Florence and the Machine]] and sung by the band's leader, [[Florence Welch]]. It was used in all versions of the game.<ref name=\"SilStand\"/><ref name=\"StandVideo\"/> The cover used a full orchestra, including brass, strings and timpani.<ref name=\"SilStand\"/> In addition, the recurring theme \"Prelude to ''Final Fantasy''\" was incorporated as a backing player on the harp.<ref name=\"StandPrelude\"/> Welch stated that she wanted to make a \"mystical\" contribution to the game. She also commented that \"Stand by Me\" was a difficult song to improve upon.<ref name=\"SilStand\"/> When deciding upon an artist who had their own unique \"world\" that would fit with the setting of ''XV'', Florence and the Machine was one of many bands Square Enix looked at.<ref name=\"GSuncovered\"/>\n\nIn the context of ''XV'', \"Stand by Me\" was not intended as a love song, but rather as a message or prayer of gratitude from Noctis to all who had supported him on his journey, including Lunafreya, his father Regis and his three companions [[Characters of Final Fantasy XV#Gladiolus Amicitia|Gladiolus Amicitia]], [[Characters of Final Fantasy XV#Ignis Scientia|Ignis Scientia]] and [[Characters of Final Fantasy XV#Prompto Argentum|Prompto Argentum]].<ref name=\"JPstand\"/>  Welch's contribution is notable as ''Final Fantasy'' theme songs have traditionally been performed by Asian singers, with the exception of ''XIII'' which had the [[Leona Lewis]] single \"[[My Hands]]\" substituted for \"[[Kimi ga Iru Kara (Sayuri Sugawara song)|Kimi ga Iru Kara]]\" in its English release.<ref name=\"GSuncovered\"/><ref name=\"HardLewis\"/> In addition to the cover for \"Stand by Me\", Florence and the Machine created two original songs inspired by the world and story of ''XV'', also sung by Welch: \"Too Much Is Never Enough\" and \"I Will Be\".<ref name=\"FFDflorence\"/> Not all of the theme songs were used in the base game, with some coming in future content.<ref name=\"JPGflorence\"/>\n\n===Additional media===\nIn addition to ''Final Fantasy XV'', the game received additional media as part of a move to prevent the story spanning multiple games: this project was dubbed the \"''Final Fantasy XV'' Universe\", and included ''Platinum Demo'', the CGI feature film ''[[Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV|Kingsglaive]]'', the [[original net animation]] series ''[[Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV|Brotherhood]]'', and the mobile title ''Justice Monsters V''.<ref name=\"GSuncovered\"/><ref name=\"FamUniverse\"/> The music for ''Brotherhood'' was composed by Yasuhisa Inoue and Susumi Akizuki of Righttrack.<ref name=\"XVUniverseMusic\"/> For ''Justice Monsters V'', the music was composed by a five-member team from the music production company, Unique Note.<ref name=\"JusticeOST\"/>\n\nThe music for ''Kingsglaive'' was composed by [[John R. Graham (composer)|John R. Graham]], with additional themes by Shimomura taken from her score for ''Final Fantasy XV''.<ref name=\"VGMOgraham\"/> Suzuki also worked on the ''Kingsglaive'' soundtrack.<ref name=\"XVsilInterview\"/> Shimomura also composed the film's main theme.<ref name=\"SilKingsglaive\"/> Graham had previously contributed to the score of Square Enix's ''Bloodmasque'' and the 2014 film ''[[The Forger (2014 film)|The Forger]]''.<ref name=\"XVUniverseMusic\"/> For a few of Shimomura's pieces used in the film, the arrangement was altered to make it darker and add scale. Some tracks, such as \"Battle for the Crown City\", changed a lot during the score's development based on the scene it was set to within the film.<ref name=\"VGMOgraham\"/> While both orchestral and electronic elements were used in the score,<ref name=\"VGMOgraham\"/><ref name=\"GrahamInterview\"/> the film's director Takeshi Nozue insisted on keeping the electronic elements to a minimum and fuse those that existed with the score to create a distorted clash of elements. This was due to the story of the film revolving around Lucis' Crystal and the rules surrounding its magic, in addition to the story focusing on the differing reactions of people facing extraordinary circumstances.<ref name=\"VGMOgraham\"/>\n\nAccording to Graham, Nozue wanted a complex musical score. The harmonics and themes change throughout the score to create both an ambiguous atmosphere and a sense of impending tragedy and loss.<ref name=\"TVSpecial\"/> Graham was brought on board to create a score that would fill the film's world and act as a counterbalance to Shimomura's music from the game, which was incorporated into the overall score. Due to the themes and events of ''Kingsglaive'', Graham needed his music to reflect the weight, contradictions, and shifting \"light and dark\" perspectives of the characters and locations. He wrote more than 100 minutes of music.<ref name=\"GrahamInterview\"/> The score was recorded entirely in the United States in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], with the Nashville Music Scoring Orchestra. The score was orchestrated and conducted by Eric Schmidt, and produced by Koyo Sonae. Daniel Kresco handled recording, mixing and engineering.<ref name=\"VGMOgraham\"/><ref name=\"TVSpecial\"/> The score was described by Nozue as \"Shimomura meets Hollywood\". This effect was reinforced by Graham's work.<ref name=\"FamTabShimomura\"/> Graham also contributed to the game's soundtrack, creating arrangements for \"Song of the Stars\" and \"Dawn\".<ref name=\"FFDost\"/>\n\nThe original commercial demo ''Episode Duscae'' featured music both from earlier trailers and new tracks.<ref name=\"NovaDuscaeMusic\"/> The music for ''Episode Duscae'' was performed by the Video Game Orchestra.<ref name=\"DuscaeBehind\"/> Selected tracks from the game were included in ''Platinum Demo'', a commercial demo that acted as a prequel to ''Final Fantasy XV''.<ref name=\"PlatinumOST\"/> Additional music from across the ''Final Fantasy'' series was included for players to listen to on the radio of the party's car Regalia: available tracks ranged from the mainline ''Final Fantasy'' games to spin-off titles such as ''[[Dissidia Final Fantasy]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy Type-0]]''.<ref name=\"XVplaylist\"/> For the 2016 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] trailer, Square Enix collaborated with rap artist [[Afrojack]] to create a piece of music that would emulate the trailer's fast-paced action. Working together with editor Hidekazu Kato under the development title \"Xtream\", Afrojack was approached as the team wanted a trailer which would stand out at the event.<ref name=\"XVafroMaking\"/> The promotional trailer \"Omen\", produced by [[Digic Pictures]] based on the world and story of ''Final Fantasy XV'', was set to \"Endlessness\", composed by dedicated trailer music company IMAscore.<ref name=\"XVendless\"/><ref name=\"GemParisDLC\"/> The music was composed by IMAscore's lead composer Andreas K\u00fcbler.<ref name=\"XVendless\"/>\n\n===Downloadable content===\nSuzuki acted as main composer for the game's story-based [[downloadable content]] (DLC), along with Shibata and Aoki.<ref name=\"XVsilInterview\"/><ref name=\"OSTlinersXVpart2\"/> The music for the ''Royal Edition'', which included both released DLC content and added story sections, was composed by Shimomura and Suzuki. Suzuki and Aoki handled music for ''[[Monster of the Deep: Final Fantasy XV]]''.<ref name=\"OSTlinersXVpart2\"/> Shimomura was also composing a new theme song for the 2019 DLC series ''Dawn of the Future'' prior to its cancellation in late 2018.<ref name=\"ShimomuraDLC2019\"/><ref name=\"XVdlc2019\"/> A regular contributor to the DLC was Tadayoshi Makino, who had previously worked on ''[[Dragon's Dogma]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy Record Keeper]]''.<ref name=\"OSTlinersXVpart2\"/><ref name=\"XVignisTrack\"/>\n\n[[Keiichi Okabe]], the composer for ''[[Nier: Automata]]'', was brought on to help with the DLC episode ''Episode Gladiolus''. He worked on the theme song \"Shield of the King\" and an arrangement of \"Battle at the Big Bridge\", a battle theme associated with recurring character Gilgamesh. When writing \"Shield of the King\", Okabe wanted to portray the burden of responsibility and fate Gladiolus bore, which he compared to the burden of character 2B in ''Nier: Automata''. \"Battle at the Big Bridge\" was initially going to have minimal work done due to its favored place among fans of the ''Final Fantasy'' series, but with encouragement from game staff Okabe arranged the track within his own musical style. To accomplish this, Okabe incorporated vocal elements similar to those used in ''Nier: Automata''.<ref name=\"XVokabe\"/> The main theme and selected tracks for ''Episode Prompto'' were composed by [[Naoshi Mizuta]], who had previously composed music for ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy XIII-2]]''. While he had previously been told to compose his themes based on specific scenes within the game or on developer requests, Mizuta was instead given a comprehensive description of Prompto's backstory and life history. Mizuta built up his musical image from there; a central part of the DLC was showing Prompto's more serious side as opposed to his role in the main game as a mood maker. Mizuta was purposely not told what type of sound the team wanted, with them instead waiting to see what ideas he could come up with.<ref name=\"XVmizuta\"/>\n\nFor ''Episode Ignis'', three new pieces were composed by [[Yasunori Mitsuda]], who had worked with Square Enix staff on the music of games including ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'', ''[[Chrono Cross]]'' and ''[[Xenogears]]''.<ref name=\"XVmitsuda1\"/> Additional music was composed by Makino and Tomomichi Takeoka.<ref name=\"OSTlinersXVpart2\"/><ref name=\"XVignisTrack\"/> Mitsuda decided to represent Ignis's character using a single violin, despite the risk of the more bombastic orchestral elements obscuring the violin work. ''Final Fantasy XV'' was his first ''Final Fantasy'' project.<ref name=\"XVmitsuda2\"/><ref name=\"XVmitsuda3\"/> The pieces were performed by the [[Brussels Philharmonic Orchestra]].<ref name=\"XVmitsuda2\"/> An additional new track for ''Episode Ignis'', \"Apocalypsis Magnatus\", was composed by Shimomura and arranged by Makino.<ref name=\"XVignisTrack\"/>\n\nThe multiplayer expansion ''Comrades'' had its theme song composed by Uematsu. Titled \"Choosing Hope\", the theme was sung by Japanese vocalist Emiko Suzuki.<ref name=\"XVcomradesSong\"/> When composing the theme, Uematsu drew inspiration from [[gospel music]] as he felt the tone would fit into the world's theme. Speaking about the recording session, Uematsu said it was the first time he remembered holding back tears.<ref name=\"XVumeatsu\"/> Additional music was composed by Suzuki, Makino, Tsutomu Narita, and Tomomichi Takeoka and Tai Tomisawa from Makino's company SpinSolfa.<ref name=\"OSTlinersXVpart2\"/><ref name=\"XVspinsolfa\"/> Makino contributed new battle themes and a medley of previous character themes to a later expansion of ''Comrades''.<ref name=\"XVMakino\"/>\n\nThe music for ''Episode Ardyn'' was co-composed by Kenji Hiramatsu, and anime composer [[Taku Iwasaki]].<ref name=\"XVArdynCredits\"/><ref name=\"ArdynIwasaki\"/> Iwasaki was requested by scenario director Toru Osanai. Director Takefumi Terada described the main themes of the narrative and gameplay to Iwasaki before work began. The team wanted a modern sound to go with the villainous role of lead character Ardyn Izunia and the urban setting of the DLC episode. Iwasaki also composed the title screen track, which was based on the story's themes. In contrast to Iwasaki's other work, the title theme was dedicated to Aera Mirus Fleuret, a key character in Ardyn's backstory. It was written as the kind of theme Ardyn as a character would never be associated with.<ref name=\"XVDawnInterview\"/> Rap sections for the track \"Conditioned to Hate\" were performed by Lotus Juice.<ref name=\"XVlotus\"/> The rap segments were decided upon in the middle of production, and the team approved them as they felt it was \"unprecedented\" within the series.<ref name=\"XVDawnInterview\"/>\n\n==Albums==\n\n===''Final Fantasy XV Original Soundtrack''===\n{{Infobox album\n| italic_title = no\n| name         = Final Fantasy XV Original Soundtrack\n| type         = Soundtrack\n| artist       = [[Yoko Shimomura]], [[Tetsuya Shibata]], [[Yoshino Aoki]], Yoshitaka Suzuki\n| cover        = FFXV OST cover art.jpg\n| border       = yes\n| alt          =\n| released     = December 21, 2016 <small>(Japan)</small><br/>February 24, 2017 <small>(Europe)</small><br/>March 24, 2017 <small>(North America)</small>\n| recorded     =\n| venue        =\n| studio       =\n| genre        = [[Video game music|Video game soundtrack]]\n| length       =\n| label        = Square Enix Music <small>(Japan)</small><br/>[[Sony Classical Records]] <small>(international)</small>\n| producer     = Koyo Sonae\n| prev_title   =\n| prev_year    =\n| next_title   =\n| next_year    =\n}}\nThe game's official soundtrack album, ''Final Fantasy XV Original Soundtrack'',{{efn|{{Nihongo||\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30ca\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30bf\u30b8\u30fcXV \u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30fb\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af|Fainaru Fantaj\u012b Fifut\u012bn Orijinaru Saundotorakku}}}} released first in Japan on December 21, 2016.<ref name=\"FamOST\"/> The album was produced by Koyo Sonae.<ref name=\"OSTlinersXV\"/> The soundtrack came in multiple editions.

The rest of the album was generally praised, with the last section's dark tones and use of leitmotifs from \"Somnus\", the environmental track \"Valse di Fantastica\", and the character track \"Ardyn\" earning particular praise.<ref name=\"RPGFalbumReview\"/> Video Game Music Online's Lucas Versantvoort gave the album a score of 3/5; while several tracks stood out as being good, he felt there was a lack of cohesive style present in other recent ''Final Fantasy'' scores, feeling that it was a lower-quality example of Shimomura's work than her earlier work on ''Kingdom Hearts''. He also found the other contributors' work mixed, and disliked the mixture of different musical styles.<ref name=\"VGMOalbumReview\"/> Both reviewers praised \"Somnus\" as the album's best track; Farag said he could \"easily call \"Somnus\" one of Shimomura's greatest songs\", while Versantvoort felt that it was underused in the soundtrack as a whole.<ref name=\"RPGFalbumReview\"/><ref name=\"VGMOalbumReview\"/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===''Final Fantasy XV Original Soundtrack: Volume 2''===\n{{Infobox album\n| italic_title = no\n| name         = Final Fantasy XV Original Soundtrack Volume 2\n| type         = Soundtrack\n| artist       = [[Yoko Shimomura]], Keiichi Okabe, [[Naoshi Mizuta]], [[Nobuo Uematsu]], [[Yasunori Mitsuda]]\n| cover        =\n| border       = yes\n| alt          =\n| released     = March 21, 2018\n| recorded     =\n| venue        =\n| studio       =\n| genre        = [[Video game music|Video game soundtrack]]\n| length       =\n| label        = Square Enix Music\n| producer     =\n| prev_title   =\n| prev_year    =\n| next_title   =\n| next_year    =\n}}\nA second album for CD and Blu-ray, ''Final Fantasy XV Original Soundtrack: Volume 2'', was released on March 21, 2018.

There is no question by the end of the album that the aim of the director \u2013 and composer \u2013 was to create a grand-scale orchestral epic. While some of the thematic content occasionally gets lost in the bombastic instrumentation, the score itself is heartfelt and authentic, and makes for an enjoyable listen.

Favorably comparing it to Welch's work on the band's album ''[[Ceremonials]]'', he gave each track high praise: he felt \"Too Much Is Never Enough\" successfully combined Noctis' journey with Welch's signature composition style, praised \"Stand by Me\" as a cover that was both respectful and suitable for use with ''Final Fantasy'', and found \"I Will Be\" an excellent instrumental track backed up by Welch's vocals.

XV''}}\n{{Music of Final Fantasy}}\nThe music for the video game ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]'', developed and published by [[Square Enix]] as the fifteenth mainline entry in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series, was composed primarily by [[Yoko Shimomura]]. Having previously worked on the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series, among various other titles, ''Final Fantasy XV'' was her first project for the series. Shimomura was brought on board the project in 2006, when it was a spin-off title called ''Final Fantasy Versus XIII'',{{efn|{{Nihongo||\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30ca\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30bf\u30b8\u30fc\u30f4\u30a7\u30eb\u30b5\u30b9XIII|Fainaru Fantaj\u012b Verusasu S\u0101t\u012bn}}}} and stayed in her role during the game's ten-year [[Development of Final Fantasy XV|development cycle]]. Her music, based around themes of \"friendship\" and \"filial bonds\", incorporates multiple musical genres, such as orchestral, [[bossa nova]], and [[Blues|American blues]]. Several tracks, including the main theme \"Somnus\", feature [[Latin]] lyrics written by the game's original director [[Tetsuya Nomura]].\n\n''Final Fantasy XV'' was expanded into a multimedia project dubbed the \"''Final Fantasy XV'' Universe\", for which other composers were hired; [[John R. Graham (composer)|John R. Graham]] composed the music for the film ''[[Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV]]'', with additional tunes from Shimomura. Yasuhisa Inoue and Susumi Akizuki of Righttrack wrote the music for the [[original net animation]] ''[[Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV|Brotherhood]]'', while a team from the music studio Unique Note, who also worked on the base game, handled the mobile spin-off title ''Justice Monsters V''. English indie rock band [[Florence and the Machine]] collaborated on three songs for the game, including a [[Cover version|cover]] of [[Ben E. King]]'s \"[[Stand by Me (Ben E. King song)|Stand by Me]]\", which acted as the official theme song. Later contributors to the soundtrack, via [[downloadable content]] packs, were Keiichi Okabe, [[Naoshi Mizuta]], [[Yasunori Mitsuda]], [[Nobuo Uematsu]], Tadayoshi Makino, and [[Taku Iwasaki]].\n\nMultiple albums have been released containing music from ''Final Fantasy XV'' and its spin-off media. ''Final Fantasy XV Original Soundtrack'' released in December 2016 in multiple versions, including a four-disc CD release, a Blu-ray release with additional tracks, and a special edition. The standard four-disc release was published internationally in 2017 by [[Sony Classical Records]]. The score for ''Kingsglaive'' released in September 2016 as a two-disc CD. Other releases include a digital album for ''Justice Monsters V'' in September 2016, and limited digital albums for both ''Kingsglaive'' and ''Platinum Demo'', a commercial demo acting as a prequel to ''Final Fantasy XV''. The songs from Florence and the Machine were released in August 2016 as digital singles under the banner title \"Songs from ''Final Fantasy XV''\". Reception of the albums was generally positive, with the main soundtrack album and Welch's tracks reaching high positions on music charts.\n\n==Creation and development==\n\n===''Final Fantasy XV''===\n[[File:Yoko Shimomura.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Yoko Shimomura]] served as the lead composer for ''Final Fantasy XV'', writing around 80% of the soundtrack.]]\nThe musical score for the [[action role-playing game]] ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]'', originally a spin-off game called ''Final Fantasy Versus XIII'', was composed primarily by [[Yoko Shimomura]], whose previous work included ''[[Parasite Eve]]'', ''[[Legend of Mana]]'', and the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series.<ref name=\"FNCtranslation\"/><ref name=\"PSblogMusic\"/> ''Final Fantasy XV'' was her first time composing for the ''Final Fantasy'' series, so she took a more tentative approach than her ''Kingdom Hearts'' projects.<ref name=\"RPGshimomura\"/> Shimomura was involved with the project when ''XV'' was still titled ''Versus XIII'', being hired to composed the music in 2006 and staying on through its ten-year [[Development of Final Fantasy XV|development cycle]].<ref name=\"EngShimInterview\"/> In 2010, Shimomura was still forming a framework for the game's music, ensuring that the music fitted the game without it solidifying into an image that seemed wrong.<ref name=\"AndriaShimomura\"/> Her work over the time prior to its rebranding as ''Final Fantasy XV'' was fairly sporadic.<ref name=\"EngShimInterview\"/> Shimomura worked on around 80% of the music: the rest were variations on her work and other themes created by others involved in the soundtrack.<ref name=\"FamTabShimomura\"/> Other composers who worked on the game were [[Tetsuya Shibata]], [[Yoshino Aoki]], Yoshitaka Suzuki and Mitsuhiro Ohta; the latter two assisted with arrangements.<ref name=\"FamShimInterviewOST\"/>\n\nThe first track created by Shimomura for the game was \"Somnus\", at that time the official theme song.<ref name=\"PSblogMusic\"/><ref name=\"EngShimInterview\"/> \"Somnus\" was sung by Aundr\u00e9a L. Hopkins; its lyrics were written by original director [[Tetsuya Nomura]], which were translated and adapted into [[Latin]] by Taro Yamashita and Kazuhiro Komiya.<ref name=\"SomnusLyrics\"/> According to Nomura, the title, which translates from Latin to \"Sleep\", reflects the subject matter and real-world themes.<ref name=\"GemNomuraLatin\"/> An instrumental version was also created for use in ''Final Fantasy XV'', having been recorded at around the same time as the vocal version.<ref name=\"FamShimInterviewOST\"/> When ''Versus XIII'' was rebranded as ''XV'', \"Somnus\" was retained as the game's main theme, though it was replaced as the official theme song.<ref name=\"16QuestionsE3\"/>{{efn|Quote from ''Gematsu'':<br/>'''Tabata:''' \"Stand by Me\" is now the official song, but \"Somnus\" is still in the game and used in a very important way.<ref name=\"16QuestionsE3\"/>}} Another long-standing track was \"Omnis Lacrima\". Translating to \"All the Tears\", it was featured in trailers for both ''Versus XIII'' and ''Final Fantasy XV''.<ref name=\"JPGomnis\"/><ref name=\"OSTlinersMemoria\"/> The lyrics for both \"Omnis Lacrima\" and other ''Final Fantasy XV'' tracks using Latin vocals were written by Nomura and translated by Yamashita.<ref name=\"OSTlinersXV\"/><ref name=\"FFDost\"/> Nomura credited the high use of Latin to his wish for a language that was no longer used on a daily basis and that people \"won't be able to understand and yet appreciate\", desiring a sense of general equality.<ref name=\"GemNomuraLatin\"/>\n\nThe game's music was designed to encompass themes of \"friendship\" and \"filial bonds\".<ref name=\"FamTabShimomura\"/> Initially, due to its status as a spin-off, Shimomura did not feel the same amount of pressure to conform to the legacy of previous composers. By the time the game changed from ''Versus XIII'' to ''XV'', she had a clear idea of what the score would be like and so felt minimal reservations despite the game now being part of the main series.<ref name=\"PSblogMusic\"/> At the same time, she felt the need to respect the work of earlier composers such as [[Nobuo Uematsu]] while staying true to the series' legacy of musical variety.<ref name=\"EngShimInterview\"/><ref name=\"FamShimComment\"/> Despite the ten year development, the musical concepts Shimomura worked from did not change much: she constantly aimed at creating a darker score than other ''Final Fantasy'' titles.<ref name=\"PSblogMusic\"/><ref name=\"EngShimInterview\"/> Ultimately, only a third of Shimomura's completed work for ''Versus XIII'' was carried over into ''Final Fantasy XV''.<ref name=\"EdgeFeature\"/>\n\nNew elements were added when the game became ''Final Fantasy XV'', but that was to suit the new elements being introduced rather than overwriting previous work.<ref name=\"PSblogMusic\"/> In contrast to her work with Nomura, Shimomura's tracks were quickly approved by Tabata, who only later requested changes or revisions.<ref name=\"EdgeFeature\"/> The score combined multiple music genres: apart from Shimomura's typical classical style, she also incorporated other styles such as [[Bossa nova]] and [[Blues|American Blues]] for certain locations.<ref name=\"EngShimInterview\"/> For his work on the game, Suzuki drew on his work on the ''[[Metal Gear]]'' series, though he watched gameplay videos rather than cutscenes for his work on ''Final Fantasy XV''.<ref name=\"XVsilInterview\"/> The music was performed and recorded in Boston by the [[Video Game Orchestra]], a North American orchestra specializing in video game music whose first ''Final Fantasy'' project had been ''[[Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII]]'' in 2013.<ref name=\"OSTlinersXV\"/><ref name=\"DuscaeBehind\"/> The orchestra's founder Shota Nakama helped with orchestration and arrangements for the soundtrack, in addition to composing the track \"Bros on the Road\".<ref name=\"FFDost\"/> Nakama began working on the game in 2014, first working on tracks for promotional trailers.<ref name=\"XVsilInterview\"/>\n\nDuring development, Shimomura discussed her music with the game's other developers so it fit the game's world, along with reading the story.<ref name=\"RPGshimomura\"/> Many of the tracks began as requests from the writers, and for some pieces there was a lot of consultation with staff including director [[Hajime Tabata]] while they were being written.<ref name=\"EngShimInterview\"/><ref name=\"FamShimComment\"/> Several tracks were meant to emote specific moods. For \"Luna\", the theme for the character [[Characters of Final Fantasy XV#Lunafreya Nox Fleuret|Lunafreya Nox Fleuret]], Shimomura used the character's beauty and strength as inspiration; for the titular theme of main protagonist [[Noctis Lucis Caelum]], she chose to represent the weight of destiny upon him and his inner thoughts, creating a soft piece that portrayed his emotions.<ref name=\"AbbyInfo\"/> The theme \"Apocalypsis Noctis\" was intended to be both magnificent and intense, while the track \"Melancolia\" was meant to evoke sadness.<ref name=\"FamShimInterviewOST\"/> The music had to include tracks for various times of day due to the game's day-night cycle.<ref name=\"PSblogMusic\"/> Uematsu's \"Main Theme\", a recurring theme within the ''Final Fantasy'' series, also appeared in an arranged form created by Shimomura and Nakama. Another recurring theme in the series, Uematsu's \"[[Chocobo]]\" theme, was remixed by Ohta for the tracks \"Blues de Chocobo\" and \"Rodeo de Chocobo\".<ref name=\"FFDost\"/>\n\nConcerning tracks related to times of day and elements such as battle themes, Shimomura allowed the flow of gameplay to dictate the flow of her music, which required putting in a number of natural transition points within pieces so the break would be smooth.<ref name=\"PSblogMusic\"/> To help with this, a special software tool called MAGI (Music API for Gaming Interaction) was developed to manage the tempo and create sync points that allowed the music's flow to be interactive while keeping its \"epic\" sound and scope.<ref name=\"XVmagi\"/><ref name=\"FamSoundInterview\"/> When the game began development as ''Versus XIII'' it used the same sound environment as ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]'', but with the move to new hardware the sound team needed to design a new sound environment. To develop the sound software, the team partnered with [[CRI Middleware]] to integrate the company's CRI ADX 2 middleware into the game's native sound environment. The amount of sound data, which also included 300 tracks of standalone music and 150 tracks of environmental music, required for the game was so large that there were fears it would not fit onto the game disc alongside the rest of the game data.<ref name=\"FamSoundInterview\"/>\n\n===Theme songs===\n[[File:Florence and the Machine (22117304699).jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Florence Welch]] (pictured 2015) sang the game's theme songs, while her band [[Florence and the Machine]] performed them.]]\nThe game's theme song is a [[Cover version|cover]] of [[Ben E. King]]'s \"[[Stand by Me (Ben E. King song)|Stand by Me]]\", performed by the English indie rock band [[Florence and the Machine]] and sung by the band's leader, [[Florence Welch]]. It was used in all versions of the game.<ref name=\"SilStand\"/><ref name=\"StandVideo\"/> The cover used a full orchestra, including brass, strings and timpani.<ref name=\"SilStand\"/> In addition, the recurring theme \"Prelude to ''Final Fantasy''\" was incorporated as a backing player on the harp.<ref name=\"StandPrelude\"/> Welch stated that she wanted to make a \"mystical\" contribution to the game. She also commented that \"Stand by Me\" was a difficult song to improve upon.<ref name=\"SilStand\"/> When deciding upon an artist who had their own unique \"world\" that would fit with the setting of ''XV'', Florence and the Machine was one of many bands Square Enix looked at.<ref name=\"GSuncovered\"/>\n\nIn the context of ''XV'', \"Stand by Me\" was not intended as a love song, but rather as a message or prayer of gratitude from Noctis to all who had supported him on his journey, including Lunafreya, his father Regis and his three companions [[Characters of Final Fantasy XV#Gladiolus Amicitia|Gladiolus Amicitia]], [[Characters of Final Fantasy XV#Ignis Scientia|Ignis Scientia]] and [[Characters of Final Fantasy XV#Prompto Argentum|Prompto Argentum]].<ref name=\"JPstand\"/>  Welch's contribution is notable as ''Final Fantasy'' theme songs have traditionally been performed by Asian singers, with the exception of ''XIII'' which had the [[Leona Lewis]] single \"[[My Hands]]\" substituted for \"[[Kimi ga Iru Kara (Sayuri Sugawara song)|Kimi ga Iru Kara]]\" in its English release.<ref name=\"GSuncovered\"/><ref name=\"HardLewis\"/> In addition to the cover for \"Stand by Me\", Florence and the Machine created two original songs inspired by the world and story of ''XV'', also sung by Welch: \"Too Much Is Never Enough\" and \"I Will Be\".<ref name=\"FFDflorence\"/> Not all of the theme songs were used in the base game, with some coming in future content.<ref name=\"JPGflorence\"/>\n\n===Additional media===\nIn addition to ''Final Fantasy XV'', the game received additional media as part of a move to prevent the story spanning multiple games: this project was dubbed the \"''Final Fantasy XV'' Universe\", and included ''Platinum Demo'', the CGI feature film ''[[Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV|Kingsglaive]]'', the [[original net animation]] series ''[[Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV|Brotherhood]]'', and the mobile title ''Justice Monsters V''.<ref name=\"GSuncovered\"/><ref name=\"FamUniverse\"/> The music for ''Brotherhood'' was composed by Yasuhisa Inoue and Susumi Akizuki of Righttrack.<ref name=\"XVUniverseMusic\"/> For ''Justice Monsters V'', the music was composed by a five-member team from the music production company, Unique Note.<ref name=\"JusticeOST\"/>\n\nThe music for ''Kingsglaive'' was composed by [[John R. Graham (composer)|John R. Graham]], with additional themes by Shimomura taken from her score for ''Final Fantasy XV''.<ref name=\"VGMOgraham\"/> Suzuki also worked on the ''Kingsglaive'' soundtrack.<ref name=\"XVsilInterview\"/> Shimomura also composed the film's main theme.<ref name=\"SilKingsglaive\"/> Graham had previously contributed to the score of Square Enix's ''Bloodmasque'' and the 2014 film ''[[The Forger (2014 film)|The Forger]]''.<ref name=\"XVUniverseMusic\"/> For a few of Shimomura's pieces used in the film, the arrangement was altered to make it darker and add scale. Some tracks, such as \"Battle for the Crown City\", changed a lot during the score's development based on the scene it was set to within the film.<ref name=\"VGMOgraham\"/> While both orchestral and electronic elements were used in the score,<ref name=\"VGMOgraham\"/><ref name=\"GrahamInterview\"/> the film's director Takeshi Nozue insisted on keeping the electronic elements to a minimum and fuse those that existed with the score to create a distorted clash of elements. This was due to the story of the film revolving around Lucis' Crystal and the rules surrounding its magic, in addition to the story focusing on the differing reactions of people facing extraordinary circumstances.<ref name=\"VGMOgraham\"/>\n\nAccording to Graham, Nozue wanted a complex musical score. The harmonics and themes change throughout the score to create both an ambiguous atmosphere and a sense of impending tragedy and loss.<ref name=\"TVSpecial\"/> Graham was brought on board to create a score that would fill the film's world and act as a counterbalance to Shimomura's music from the game, which was incorporated into the overall score. Due to the themes and events of ''Kingsglaive'', Graham needed his music to reflect the weight, contradictions, and shifting \"light and dark\" perspectives of the characters and locations. He wrote more than 100 minutes of music.<ref name=\"GrahamInterview\"/> The score was recorded entirely in the United States in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], with the Nashville Music Scoring Orchestra. The score was orchestrated and conducted by Eric Schmidt, and produced by Koyo Sonae. Daniel Kresco handled recording, mixing and engineering.<ref name=\"VGMOgraham\"/><ref name=\"TVSpecial\"/> The score was described by Nozue as \"Shimomura meets Hollywood\". This effect was reinforced by Graham's work.<ref name=\"FamTabShimomura\"/> Graham also contributed to the game's soundtrack, creating arrangements for \"Song of the Stars\" and \"Dawn\".<ref name=\"FFDost\"/>\n\nThe original commercial demo ''Episode Duscae'' featured music both from earlier trailers and new tracks.<ref name=\"NovaDuscaeMusic\"/> The music for ''Episode Duscae'' was performed by the Video Game Orchestra.<ref name=\"DuscaeBehind\"/> Selected tracks from the game were included in ''Platinum Demo'', a commercial demo that acted as a prequel to ''Final Fantasy XV''.<ref name=\"PlatinumOST\"/> Additional music from across the ''Final Fantasy'' series was included for players to listen to on the radio of the party's car Regalia: available tracks ranged from the mainline ''Final Fantasy'' games to spin-off titles such as ''[[Dissidia Final Fantasy]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy Type-0]]''.<ref name=\"XVplaylist\"/> For the 2016 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] trailer, Square Enix collaborated with rap artist [[Afrojack]] to create a piece of music that would emulate the trailer's fast-paced action. Working together with editor Hidekazu Kato under the development title \"Xtream\", Afrojack was approached as the team wanted a trailer which would stand out at the event.<ref name=\"XVafroMaking\"/> The promotional trailer \"Omen\", produced by [[Digic Pictures]] based on the world and story of ''Final Fantasy XV'', was set to \"Endlessness\", composed by dedicated trailer music company IMAscore.<ref name=\"XVendless\"/><ref name=\"GemParisDLC\"/> The music was composed by IMAscore's lead composer Andreas K\u00fcbler.<ref name=\"XVendless\"/>\n\n===Downloadable content===\nSuzuki acted as main composer for the game's story-based [[downloadable content]] (DLC), along with Shibata and Aoki.<ref name=\"XVsilInterview\"/><ref name=\"OSTlinersXVpart2\"/> The music for the ''Royal Edition'', which included both released DLC content and added story sections, was composed by Shimomura and Suzuki. Suzuki and Aoki handled music for ''[[Monster of the Deep: Final Fantasy XV]]''.<ref name=\"OSTlinersXVpart2\"/> Shimomura was also composing a new theme song for the 2019 DLC series ''Dawn of the Future'' prior to its cancellation in late 2018.<ref name=\"ShimomuraDLC2019\"/><ref name=\"XVdlc2019\"/> A regular contributor to the DLC was Tadayoshi Makino, who had previously worked on ''[[Dragon's Dogma]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy Record Keeper]]''.<ref name=\"OSTlinersXVpart2\"/><ref name=\"XVignisTrack\"/>\n\nKeiichi Okabe, the composer for ''[[Nier: Automata]]'', was brought on to help with the DLC episode ''Episode Gladiolus''. He worked on the theme song \"Shield of the King\" and an arrangement of \"Battle at the Big Bridge\", a battle theme associated with recurring character Gilgamesh. When writing \"Shield of the King\", Okabe wanted to portray the burden of responsibility and fate Gladiolus bore, which he compared to the burden of character 2B in ''Nier: Automata''. \"Battle at the Big Bridge\" was initially going to have minimal work done due to its favored place among fans of the ''Final Fantasy'' series, but with encouragement from game staff Okabe arranged the track within his own musical style. To accomplish this, Okabe incorporated vocal elements similar to those used in ''Nier: Automata''.<ref name=\"XVokabe\"/> The main theme and selected tracks for ''Episode Prompto'' were composed by [[Naoshi Mizuta]], who had previously composed music for ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy XIII-2]]''. While he had previously been told to compose his themes based on specific scenes within the game or on developer requests, Mizuta was instead given a comprehensive description of Prompto's backstory and life history. Mizuta built up his musical image from there; a central part of the DLC was showing Prompto's more serious side as opposed to his role in the main game as a mood maker. Mizuta was purposely not told what type of sound the team wanted, with them instead waiting to see what ideas he could come up with.<ref name=\"XVmizuta\"/>\n\nFor ''Episode Ignis'', three new pieces were composed by [[Yasunori Mitsuda]], who had worked with Square Enix staff on the music of games including ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'', ''[[Chrono Cross]]'' and ''[[Xenogears]]''.<ref name=\"XVmitsuda1\"/> Additional music was composed by Makino and Tomomichi Takeoka.<ref name=\"OSTlinersXVpart2\"/><ref name=\"XVignisTrack\"/> Mitsuda decided to represent Ignis's character using a single violin, despite the risk of the more bombastic orchestral elements obscuring the violin work. ''Final Fantasy XV'' was his first ''Final Fantasy'' project.<ref name=\"XVmitsuda2\"/><ref name=\"XVmitsuda3\"/> The pieces were performed by the [[Brussels Philharmonic Orchestra]].<ref name=\"XVmitsuda2\"/> An additional new track for ''Episode Ignis'', \"Apocalypsis Magnatus\", was composed by Shimomura and arranged by Makino.<ref name=\"XVignisTrack\"/>\n\nThe multiplayer expansion ''Comrades'' had its theme song composed by Uematsu. Titled \"Choosing Hope\", the theme was sung by Japanese vocalist Emiko Suzuki.<ref name=\"XVcomradesSong\"/> When composing the theme, Uematsu drew inspiration from [[gospel music]] as he felt the tone would fit into the world's theme. Speaking about the recording session, Uematsu said it was the first time he remembered holding back tears.<ref name=\"XVumeatsu\"/> Additional music was composed by Suzuki, Makino, Tsutomu Narita, and Tomomichi Takeoka and Tai Tomisawa from Makino's company SpinSolfa.<ref name=\"OSTlinersXVpart2\"/><ref name=\"XVspinsolfa\"/> Makino contributed new battle themes and a medley of previous character themes to a later expansion of ''Comrades''.<ref name=\"XVMakino\"/>\n\nThe music for ''Episode Ardyn'' was co-composed by Kenji Hiramatsu, and anime composer [[Taku Iwasaki]].<ref name=\"XVArdynCredits\"/><ref name=\"ArdynIwasaki\"/> Iwasaki was requested by scenario director Toru Osanai. Director Takefumi Terada described the main themes of the narrative and gameplay to Iwasaki before work began. The team wanted a modern sound to go with the villainous role of lead character Ardyn Izunia and the urban setting of the DLC episode. Iwasaki also composed the title screen track, which was based on the story's themes. In contrast to Iwasaki's other work, the title theme was dedicated to Aera Mirus Fleuret, a key character in Ardyn's backstory. It was written as the kind of theme Ardyn as a character would never be associated with.<ref name=\"XVDawnInterview\"/> Rap sections for the track \"Conditioned to Hate\" were performed by Lotus Juice.<ref name=\"XVlotus\"/> The rap segments were decided upon in the middle of production, and the team approved them as they felt it was \"unprecedented\" within the series.<ref name=\"XVDawnInterview\"/>\n\n==Albums==\n\n===''Final Fantasy XV Original Soundtrack''===\n{{Infobox album\n| italic_title = no\n| name         = Final Fantasy XV Original Soundtrack\n| type         = Soundtrack\n| artist       = [[Yoko Shimomura]], [[Tetsuya Shibata]], [[Yoshino Aoki]], Yoshitaka Suzuki\n| cover        = FFXV OST cover art.jpg\n| border       = yes\n| alt          =\n| released     = December 21, 2016 <small>(Japan)</small><br/>February 24, 2017 <small>(Europe)</small><br/>March 24, 2017 <small>(North America)</small>\n| recorded     =\n| venue        =\n| studio       =\n| genre        = [[Video game music|Video game soundtrack]]\n| length       =\n| label        = Square Enix Music <small>(Japan)</small><br/>[[Sony Classical Records]] <small>(international)</small>\n| producer     = Koyo Sonae\n| prev_title   =\n| prev_year    =\n| next_title   =\n| next_year    =\n}}\nThe game's official soundtrack album, ''Final Fantasy XV Original Soundtrack'',{{efn|{{Nihongo||\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30ca\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30bf\u30b8\u30fcXV \u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30fb\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af|Fainaru Fantaj\u012b Fifut\u012bn Orijinaru Saundotorakku}}}} released first in Japan on December 21, 2016.<ref name=\"FamOST\"/> The album was produced by Koyo Sonae.<ref name=\"OSTlinersXV\"/> The soundtrack came in multiple editions.

The rest of the album was generally praised, with the last section's dark tones and use of leitmotifs from \"Somnus\", the environmental track \"Valse di Fantastica\", and the character track \"Ardyn\" earning particular praise.<ref name=\"RPGFalbumReview\"/> Video Game Music Online's Lucas Versantvoort gave the album a score of 3/5; while several tracks stood out as being good, he felt there was a lack of cohesive style present in other recent ''Final Fantasy'' scores, feeling that it was a lower-quality example of Shimomura's work than her earlier work on ''Kingdom Hearts''. He also found the other contributors' work mixed, and disliked the mixture of different musical styles.<ref name=\"VGMOalbumReview\"/> Both reviewers praised \"Somnus\" as the album's best track; Farag said he could \"easily call \"Somnus\" one of Shimomura's greatest songs\", while Versantvoort felt that it was underused in the soundtrack as a whole.<ref name=\"RPGFalbumReview\"/><ref name=\"VGMOalbumReview\"/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===''Final Fantasy XV Original Soundtrack: Volume 2''===\n{{Infobox album\n| italic_title = no\n| name         = Final Fantasy XV Original Soundtrack Volume 2\n| type         = Soundtrack\n| artist       = [[Yoko Shimomura]], Keiichi Okabe, [[Naoshi Mizuta]], [[Nobuo Uematsu]], [[Yasunori Mitsuda]]\n| cover        =\n| border       = yes\n| alt          =\n| released     = March 21, 2018\n| recorded     =\n| venue        =\n| studio       =\n| genre        = [[Video game music|Video game soundtrack]]\n| length       =\n| label        = Square Enix Music\n| producer     =\n| prev_title   =\n| prev_year    =\n| next_title   =\n| next_year    =\n}}\nA second album for CD and Blu-ray, ''Final Fantasy XV Original Soundtrack: Volume 2'', was released on March 21, 2018.

There is no question by the end of the album that the aim of the director \u2013 and composer \u2013 was to create a grand-scale orchestral epic. While some of the thematic content occasionally gets lost in the bombastic instrumentation, the score itself is heartfelt and authentic, and makes for an enjoyable listen. When compared to ''Advent Children'', the score to ''Kingsglaive'' is darker and more cinematic, setting a refreshing precedent for any future Final Fantasy films\".<ref name=\"VGMOkingReview\"/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Songs from ''Final Fantasy XV''===\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Songs from Final Fantasy XV\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| border     = yes\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Florence and the Machine]]\n| album      =\n| released   = August 12, 2016\n| format     =\n| recorded   =\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = [[Album|Music album]]\n| length     =\n| label      = [[Island Records]]\n| composer   =\n| lyricist   =\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\nThe three songs by the English group [[Florence and the Machine]], \"Stand by Me\", \"Too Much Is Never Enough\", and \"I Will Be\", were released together under the banner title \"Songs from ''Final Fantasy XV''\" as digital singles by [[Island Records]] on August 12, 2016.<ref name=\"FFDflorence\"/><ref name=\"FlorenceSingles\"/> In addition to Florence and the Machine, the singles were produced with the help of [[Emile Haynie]] and [[Jeff Bhasker]].<ref name=\"XVSongsVGMOreview\"/>\n\nIn their first week of release, \"Stand by Me\" and \"Too Much Is Never Enough\" both charted: \"Too Much Is Never Enough\" broke the top 100 in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain; \"Stand by Me\" only succeeded in charting in the Brazilian charts, reaching #27. \"I Will Be\" failed to chart.<ref name=\"ChartFlorence\"/>\n\nKT Wong of Video Game Music Online gave the album a perfect score of 5/5 stars. Favorably comparing it to Welch's work on the band's album ''[[Ceremonials]]'', he gave each track high praise: he felt \"Too Much Is Never Enough\" successfully combined Noctis' journey with Welch's signature composition style, praised \"Stand by Me\" as a cover that was both respectful and suitable for use with ''Final Fantasy'', and found \"I Will Be\" an excellent instrumental track backed up by Welch's vocals. He summed up by calling the album \"a worthy purchase for all fans of ''Final Fantasy'' as well as of Florence and the Machine\".<ref name=\"XVSongsVGMOreview\"/> Patrick Gann of RPGFan called \"Too Much Is Never Enough\" his personal favorite from the album, calling it superior to the use of \"My Hands\" or the work of [[Angela Aki]].

Educated in Helsinki, he returned to his home town Viipuri in 1906. He drew most of his buildings in Viipuri, but during the last years of his life also in Finland's capital Helsinki. Viipuri belonged until 1809 to the Kingdom of Sweden. During 1809 - 1917 it was a part of the autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland]]. It was the second largest city of independent Finland as of 1917. After being conquered by the Soviet Union's red army in both 1940 during the Winter War and then again in 1944 during the War of Continuation, it then became a part of the [[Soviet Union]] under the Russian name Vyborg after the 1947 peace treaty in Paris, France. When the Soviet Union disbanded itself in 1991, it became a part of Russia. The style of his architecture covers the transition in architecture from so-called [[Nordic Classicism]] of the 1920s to [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]] during the 1930s. Ullberg is regarded as a leading architect of the Nordic Classicism period and was the first to introduce [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]] to Viipuri.<ref>Simo Paavilainen, ''Nordic Classicism 1910-1930'', Museum of Finnish Architecture, Helsinki, 1982.</ref> Though his most notable buildings were constructed in Viipuri, he became famous not only in his native town but nationwide.\n\n== Education and early works ==\nAs a child Ullberg had studied at the Viborgs konstv\u00e4nners ritskola art school, where later also, in 1906\u20131913, he was a teacher.\nUllberg graduated in 1901 from the architectural faculty at the Helsinki Polytechnic Institute (Polytekniska institutet in Swedish), now [[Aalto University]]. After graduating he worked as an architect at the offices of [[Usko Nystr\u00f6m|Nystr\u00f6m]], [[Albert Petrelius|Petrelius]] & [[Vilho Penttil\u00e4|Penttil\u00e4]] in Helsinki.\n\nAfter returning in 1906 to his native city, he opened an architectural bureau together with Axel Gyld\u00e9n, who had studied with him in Helsinki. Together they designed Hackman House, completed in 1909, for the [[Hackman]] industrialist family. Afterwards, the partnership broke up when Ullberg decided to start working under his own name. He ran his own architect office in Vyborg in 1910\u20131932 and was the Vyborg city architect from 1932 until 1936, during which time he controlled the urban conception of the city and worked on the [[Comprehensive planning|Master plan]]. While living in Vyborg he had also for many years been a city counselor. In 1936 he moved to Helsinki to become head of the building department of the [[Medicinalstyrelsen (Finland)|National Board of Health]] in 1936-1941.\n\nThe most important work created in collaboration with Gyld\u00e9n was the headquarters of Hackman & Co (1909) at Piispankatu 14 in Viipuri. The building represents the compositional and formal variations of Jugenstil, [[Art Nouveau]] or National [[Romanticism]]. The main elevation pediments, openings, window frames, portals, and the granite facades are quite typical of National Romanticism, which at that time was also the prevailing architectural style in Finland for key public buildings, most notably in the works of architects [[Gesellius, Lindgren, and Saarinen]] (e.g. Finnish Pavilion at Exposition Universelle (1900), Paris, and National Museum of Finland, Helsinki (1902\u20131904).) The interiors of the building were among the most stylish and rich in the city. The inside of the house survived harmful transformations during the Soviet period so the interior decorations were greatly damaged.\n\nBetween 1910 and 1930 he designed a large number of public buildings and houses, most of which are situated in Viipuri. Among these are several office buildings in [[K\u00e4kisalmi]], [[Imatra]] and other Finnish towns.\n\nThe early works in Viipuri could be described as traditional town architecture with a classicistic influence. The most interesting examples from this period include the reconstruction of the Union Bank (originally built in 1900), the Karjala offices (1929), the store and residence of V. Dippel (1921) and the restoration of the famous medieval Round Tower in the middle of the old city centre. Ullberg converted the massive old building into a restaurant and cafe.\n\n== From Classicism to Functionalism ==\nThe most important period in Ullberg's architect career is connected with the \"White Era\" of [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalist]] architecture. However, some of his important works can be considered as marking a transition from Nordic Classicism to Functionalism during the 1920s and early 1930s.\n\nUllberg found his own unique conception and interpretation of functionalistic architecture. The main aspect of his philosophy is the connection between the functional and the classical. In his early works Ullberg used as his basis [[Nordic Classicism]], emphasizing reductive common elements from Classicism. The most important works of the era became Ullberg's reply to the serious social needs of the city. Among these works are the [[Viipuri Art Museum and Drawing School]] (1930), the Viipuri Panttilaitos Oy Building (1931), the Viipuri Provincial Archives (1933), and the Viipuri Maternity Hospital (1937).\n\n[[Image:Uno ullberg viipuri art mus 01.jpg|thumb|250px|Viipuri Art Museum and Drawing School (1930) in [[Vyborg]], Russia]]\nThe most important of Ullberg's works is the combined Viipuri Art Museum and Drawing School. Completed in October 1930, the building is situated near the 16th Century Pantsarlahti Bastion at the southern end of the city. Contrasting with its fortress surroundings, the white-stuccoed building commands the view over the South Harbour and the approach from the sea. The massing of the building comprises two wings (the Art Museum on the east wing, and the Drawing School on the west) placed at an angle to each other, with a wedge-shaped, paved courtyard separating the two. The wider part of the courtyard faces south-west, towards the harbour, and there is an imposing twin-row of Classical columns with a rectangular cross-section supporting an equally stylistic curving architrave, doubling as a corridor that connects the two buildings. The approach to the museum from the city is through a series of flights of steps leading to an opening, set at an angle, between the windowless north walls of the wings. The walls facing south are almost as austere, with the central colonnade acting as the focal point.\n\n[[Image:Uno ullberg viipuri p oy 01.JPG|thumb|250px|Viipuri Panttilaitos Oy (1931) in Vyborg, Russia]]\nThe four-storey building of the Viipuri Panttilaitos Oy was the first completed example of Functionalist movement in the city. It has as many rows of distinct, very simplified bands of windows, or rather, more like four very wide windows with very thin mullions. The first floor fenestration consists of a double row of windows, 22 in a row (that are hinged from the bottom, opening downwards), while the upper three only have one. The bold fenestration is enabled by the use of a solid [[reinforced concrete]] girderless framework with \"mushroom form\" columns that free the brick facade of its load-bearing function. The cross-section of columns on the last stage is much smaller than on the first one, it's because of the increase of mechanical tension down from the roof the basement.\n\nUllberg was very successful in designing medical facilities. During the ''White Era'' he built a number of hospitals in Viipuri. In 1936 Ullberg moved to Helsinki where he became the head of the architectural bureau of the [[National Institute for Health and Welfare (Finland)|National Board of Health]], and among his tasks was the planning of the Meilahti Hospital area, including the Children's Hospital, completed in 1946 after his death.\n\nUllberg's most notable architectural design in Helsinki is Bensow House on Etel\u00e4esplaadi, completed for the Bensow trading company. While on the outside the seven-storey building is typically Functionalist in its expression, in the interior it has numerous features typical of [[Art Deco]], such as the use of chrome, brick tiles and neon signs.\n\nAfter the [[Winter War]] with the Soviet Union, and following a short period in 1941 when Vyborg was occupied by the Soviet Union, Vyborg was handed back to Finland, Ullberg quickly drew up a plan for the reconstruction for his native town, but there was no opportunity to implement the plan because the entire city was annexed to the Soviet Union in 1944.\n\nUllberg died in Helsinki in 1944 at the age of 65. His gravestone at [[Hietaniemi Cemetery]] in Helsinki was designed by Finnish architect and designer [[Alvar Aalto]].\n\n== Important buildings ==\n* 1909, Headquarters of \"Hackman & Co\", [[Vyborg]], Russia\n* 1911-1915, Finland Trade Bank offices and residence, Vyborg, Russia\n* 1913, United Northern Bank Building, [[Sortavala]], Russia\n* 1915, Bank Office, Sortavala, Russia\n* 1921, trade-house and residence of V.

Ullberg is regarded as a leading architect of the Nordic Classicism period and was the first to introduce [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]] to Viipuri.<ref>Simo Paavilainen, ''Nordic Classicism 1910-1930'', Museum of Finnish Architecture, Helsinki, 1982.</ref> Though his most notable buildings were constructed in Viipuri, he became famous not only in his native town but nationwide.\n\n== Education and early works ==\nAs a child Ullberg had studied at the Viborgs konstv\u00e4nners ritskola art school, where later also, in 1906\u20131913, he was a teacher.\nUllberg graduated in 1901 from the architectural faculty at the Helsinki Polytechnic Institute (Polytekniska institutet in Swedish), now [[Aalto University]]. After graduating he worked as an architect at the offices of [[Usko Nystr\u00f6m|Nystr\u00f6m]], [[Albert Petrelius|Petrelius]] & [[Vilho Penttil\u00e4|Penttil\u00e4]] in Helsinki.\n\nAfter returning in 1906 to his native city, he opened an architectural bureau together with Axel Gyld\u00e9n, who had studied with him in Helsinki. Together they designed Hackman House, completed in 1909, for the [[Hackman]] industrialist family. Afterwards, the partnership broke up when Ullberg decided to start working under his own name. He ran his own architect office in Vyborg in 1910\u20131932 and was the Vyborg city architect from 1932 until 1936, during which time he controlled the urban conception of the city and worked on the [[Comprehensive planning|Master plan]]. While living in Vyborg he had also for many years been a city counselor. In 1936 he moved to Helsinki to become head of the building department of the [[Medicinalstyrelsen (Finland)|National Board of Health]] in 1936-1941.\n\nThe most important work created in collaboration with Gyld\u00e9n was the headquarters of Hackman & Co (1909) at Piispankatu 14 in Viipuri. The building represents the compositional and formal variations of Jugenstil, [[Art Nouveau]] or National [[Romanticism]]. The main elevation pediments, openings, window frames, portals, and the granite facades are quite typical of National Romanticism, which at that time was also the prevailing architectural style in Finland for key public buildings, most notably in the works of architects [[Gesellius, Lindgren, and Saarinen]] (e.g. Finnish Pavilion at Exposition Universelle (1900), Paris, and National Museum of Finland, Helsinki (1902\u20131904).) The interiors of the building were among the most stylish and rich in the city. The inside of the house survived harmful transformations during the Soviet period so the interior decorations were greatly damaged.\n\nBetween 1910 and 1930 he designed a large number of public buildings and houses, most of which are situated in Viipuri. Among these are several office buildings in [[K\u00e4kisalmi]], [[Imatra]] and other Finnish towns.\n\nThe early works in Viipuri could be described as traditional town architecture with a classicistic influence. The most interesting examples from this period include the reconstruction of the Union Bank (originally built in 1900), the Karjala offices (1929), the store and residence of V. Dippel (1921) and the restoration of the famous medieval Round Tower in the middle of the old city centre. Ullberg converted the massive old building into a restaurant and cafe.\n\n== From Classicism to Functionalism ==\nThe most important period in Ullberg's architect career is connected with the \"White Era\" of [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalist]] architecture. However, some of his important works can be considered as marking a transition from Nordic Classicism to Functionalism during the 1920s and early 1930s.\n\nUllberg found his own unique conception and interpretation of functionalistic architecture. The main aspect of his philosophy is the connection between the functional and the classical. In his early works Ullberg used as his basis [[Nordic Classicism]], emphasizing reductive common elements from Classicism. The most important works of the era became Ullberg's reply to the serious social needs of the city. Among these works are the [[Viipuri Art Museum and Drawing School]] (1930), the Viipuri Panttilaitos Oy Building (1931), the Viipuri Provincial Archives (1933), and the Viipuri Maternity Hospital (1937).\n\n[[Image:Uno ullberg viipuri art mus 01.jpg|thumb|250px|Viipuri Art Museum and Drawing School (1930) in [[Vyborg]], Russia]]\nThe most important of Ullberg's works is the combined Viipuri Art Museum and Drawing School. Completed in October 1930, the building is situated near the 16th Century Pantsarlahti Bastion at the southern end of the city. Contrasting with its fortress surroundings, the white-stuccoed building commands the view over the South Harbour and the approach from the sea. The massing of the building comprises two wings (the Art Museum on the east wing, and the Drawing School on the west) placed at an angle to each other, with a wedge-shaped, paved courtyard separating the two. The wider part of the courtyard faces south-west, towards the harbour, and there is an imposing twin-row of Classical columns with a rectangular cross-section supporting an equally stylistic curving architrave, doubling as a corridor that connects the two buildings. The approach to the museum from the city is through a series of flights of steps leading to an opening, set at an angle, between the windowless north walls of the wings. The walls facing south are almost as austere, with the central colonnade acting as the focal point.\n\n[[Image:Uno ullberg viipuri p oy 01.JPG|thumb|250px|Viipuri Panttilaitos Oy (1931) in Vyborg, Russia]]\nThe four-storey building of the Viipuri Panttilaitos Oy was the first completed example of Functionalist movement in the city. It has as many rows of distinct, very simplified bands of windows, or rather, more like four very wide windows with very thin mullions. The first floor fenestration consists of a double row of windows, 22 in a row (that are hinged from the bottom, opening downwards), while the upper three only have one. The bold fenestration is enabled by the use of a solid [[reinforced concrete]] girderless framework with \"mushroom form\" columns that free the brick facade of its load-bearing function. The cross-section of columns on the last stage is much smaller than on the first one, it's because of the increase of mechanical tension down from the roof the basement.\n\nUllberg was very successful in designing medical facilities. During the ''White Era'' he built a number of hospitals in Viipuri. In 1936 Ullberg moved to Helsinki where he became the head of the architectural bureau of the [[National Institute for Health and Welfare (Finland)|National Board of Health]], and among his tasks was the planing of the Meilahti Hospital area, including the Children's Hospital, completed in 1946 after his death.\n\nUllberg's most notable architectural design in Helsinki is Bensow House on Etel\u00e4esplaadi, completed for the Bensow trading company. While on the outside the seven-storey building is typically Functionalist in its expression, in the interior it has numerous features typical of [[Art Deco]], such as the use of chrome, brick tiles and neon signs.\n\nAfter the [[Winter War]] with the Soviet Union, and following a short period in 1941 when Vyborg was occupied by the Soviet Union, Vyborg was handed back to Finland, Ullberg quickly drew up a plan for the reconstruction for his native town, but there was no opportunity to implement the plan because the entire city was annexed to the Soviet Union in 1944.\n\nUllberg died in Helsinki in 1944 at the age of 65. His gravestone at [[Hietaniemi Cemetery]] in Helsinki was designed by Finnish architect and designer [[Alvar Aalto]].\n\n== Important buildings ==\n* 1909, Headquarters of \"Hackman & Co\", [[Vyborg]], Russia\n* 1911-1915, Finland Trade Bank offices and residence, Vyborg, Russia\n* 1913, United Northern Bank Building, [[Sortavala]], Russia\n* 1915, Bank Office, Sortavala, Russia\n* 1921, trade-house and residence of V.
