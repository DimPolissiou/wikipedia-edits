The centerpiece of the port, the [[San Francisco Ferry Building|Ferry Building]], while still receiving commuter ferry traffic, has been restored and redeveloped as a gourmet marketplace.\n\n===Climate===\n\nSan Francisco has a [[warm-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Csb'') characteristic of California's coast, with moist mild winters and dry summers.<ref>[http://ggweather.com/sf/narrative.html Climate of San Francisco: Narrative Description] Golden Gate Weather Services.

As a result, the year's warmest month, on average, is September, and on average, October is warmer than July, especially in daytime.\n\nBecause of its sharp topography and maritime influences, San Francisco exhibits a multitude of distinct [[microclimate]]s. The high hills in the geographic center of the city are responsible for a 20% variance in annual rainfall between different parts of the city. They also protect neighborhoods directly to their east from the foggy and sometimes very cold and windy conditions experienced in the [[Sunset District, San Francisco|Sunset District]]; for those who live on the eastern side of the city, San Francisco is sunnier, with an average of 260 clear days, and only 105 cloudy days per year.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nTemperatures reach or exceed {{convert|80|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} on an average of only 21 and 23&nbsp;days a year at downtown and [[San Francisco International Airport]] (SFO), respectively.<ref name=\"San Francisco NOAA\"/> The dry period of May to October is mild to warm, with the normal monthly mean temperature peaking in September at {{convert|62.7|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"San Francisco NOAA\"/> The rainy period of November to April is slightly cooler, with the normal monthly mean temperature reaching its lowest in January at {{convert|51.3|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"San Francisco NOAA\"/> On average, there are 73 rainy days a year, and annual precipitation averages {{convert|23.65|in|mm|0}}.<ref name=\"San Francisco NOAA\"/> Variation in precipitation from year to year is high.

A total of 600 R32s were built, numbered 3350\u20133949, though some cars were re-numbered. The R32 contract was divided into two subcontracts of 300 cars each: '''R32''' (cars 3350-3649) and '''R32A''' (cars 3650-3949); the former was paid by the city's capital budget and the latter was paid through a revenue bond. All were arranged as married pairs. The R32s were the first mass-produced [[stainless steel]] cars built for the New York City Subway. \n\nA ceremonial introduction trip for the new R32 \"Brightliners\" cars was held on September 9, 1964. Various modifications were made over the years to the R32 fleet. In the late 1980s, all of the R32 cars were rebuilt, with ten cars being rebuilt by [[General Electric]] and the remaining cars being rebuilt by [[Morrison Knudsen]]. As part of the refurbishment, the original rollsigns and express/local marker lights at the end of each car were replaced with flipdot signs. After refurbishment, the R32 and R32A cars were renamed R32 Phase I, R32 Phase II, and R32 GE. The [[R160 (New York City Subway car)|R160s]] replaced most of the R32s in the late 2000s, though about one-third of the original fleet remained, all being Phase I R32s. The rest of the R32s were retired in early 2020 and replaced with the [[R179 (New York City Subway car)|R179]]s.<ref name=\"retired\"/> Some cars were saved for various purposes throughout the New York City Subway system, including as museum exhibits or work cars.\n\n==Description==\nThe R32s were numbered 3350\u20133949, but some cars have been re-numbered outside of this range or to different numbers in this range. They were the first cars to introduce all-mylar route and destination rollsigns instead of the former cotton cloth or linen type rollsigns found on prior rail cars.\n\nThe R32 contract was divided into two subcontracts of 300 cars each: '''R32''' (cars 3350-3649) and '''R32A''' (cars 3650-3949).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nycsubway.org/wiki/R-32_(Budd,_1964) |title=R-32 (Budd, 1964) |website=nycsubway.org |language=en |access-date=April 27, 2017}}</ref> The R32As were funded through the proceeds of a revenue bond, while the R32s were paid for out of the 1963\u20131964 New York City capital budget.

Two previous Budd orders (the [[MS Multi-section car (New York City Subway car)|BMT Zephyr]] and the [[R11/R34 (New York City Subway car)|R11s]]) were limited production and/or experimental orders.

At the time, this was the largest railcar order ever placed in the United States for subway cars.

The next lowest bidder came in at $117,900 per car, which was for low-alloy steel cars. Budd low-balled the price to win the contract and introduce stainless steel equipment to the modern [[New York City Subway]] system, a plan that was met with limited success.<ref name=\":2\" /> NYCTA allowed a premium for subsequent stainless steel contracts, and all subsequent equipment was at least partly constructed of stainless steel. However, the Budd Company never benefited from the change, as they failed to win further contracts from the NYCTA, and the company has since halted production of railroad cars.\n\nThe R32 cars originally came with blue passenger doors and blue storm doors. The passenger doors of many cars were repainted silver from 1974, as the graffiti epidemic worsened.<ref name=\"nycs-19720209\">{{cite web|last=Testagrose|first=Joe|title=Image 4758|url=https://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?4758|website=nycsubway.org|accessdate=26 February 2020|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200226205418/https://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?4758|archivedate=26 February 2020|date=9 February 1974|url-status=live}}</ref> However, some cars retained or regained blue passenger doors towards the start of the General Overhaul (GOH) program, which replaced all the doors with stainless steel versions.<ref name=\"nycs-19881102\">{{cite web|last=Barnes|first1=John|title=Image 108103|url=https://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?108103|website=nycsubway.org|accessdate=26 February 2020|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200226210458/https://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?108103|archivedate=26 February 2020|date=2 November 1988|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn August 18, 1964, the NYCTA approved a modification to the 300 R32s already constructed. The modification was required to ensure proper clearance in tunnels. Since the cars were 4000 pounds lighter than other subway cars when new, they did not sink as low on standard trucks and springs. The modification involved the modification of the body bolster.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/08/19/new-subway-cars-lowered-to-avoid-any-close-scrapes.html |title=New Subway Cars Lowered to Avoid Any Close Scrapes |date=August 19, 1964 |work=The New York Times |access-date=April 27, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nA ceremonial introduction trip for the new R32 \"Brightliners\" cars was held on September 9, 1964, operating from the [[New York Central Railroad]]'s Mott Haven Yards in the Bronx to [[Grand Central Terminal]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]].<ref name=\":1\" /> The new cars were then placed into service on the {{NYCS|Q}} on September 14, 1964, after their New York Central's spring-loaded under-running third rail shoes were replaced with gravity-type overrunning subway third rail shoes.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> The R32s were originally assigned to the BMT Southern Division service only, initially on the [[BMT Brighton Line|Brighton Line]] (Q train) and the [[BMT Sea Beach Line|Sea Beach Line]] ({{NYCS|N}} train), but were eventually reassigned to the [[BMT West End Line|West End Line]] ({{NYCS|T}} and TT trains).\n\nCars 3946\u20133949 were delivered with Pioneer trucks and disc brakes in 1966.

Ten cars were rebuilt by [[General Electric]] at its facility in [[Buffalo, New York]] (cars 3594-3595, 3880-3881, 3892-3893, 3936-3937, and 3934-3935) as prototype rebuilds, and the remaining cars were rebuilt by [[Morrison\u2013Knudsen]] at its facility in [[Hornell, New York]].<ref>https://www.flickr.com/photos/127872292@N06/48294055022/in/album-72157709666433846/</ref> During the rebuilding process, the route and destination mylar rollsigns located above the storm doors were removed and replaced with Luminator [[Flip-disc display|flipdot]] electronic route signs that can display both letters and numbers, including zero. This is because the air conditioning evaporators mounted on the interior car ends made it difficult to change the front route and destination signs.

The R32 Phase I cars (re-built by Morrison Knudsen) have WABCO Air Brake packages, GE Master Controllers, and Thermo King HVAC units. The R32 Phase II cars (also re-built by Morrison Knudsen) had NY Air Brake equipment, Westinghouse Master Controllers, and Stone Safety HVAC units. The ten prototype rebuild R32 GE cars differ from the Phase I and II cars as they were rebuilt to [[R38 (New York City Subway car)|R38]] specifications.

A total of 600 R32s were built, numbered 3350\u20133949, though some cars were re-numbered. The R32 contract was divided into two subcontracts of 300 cars each: '''R32''' (cars 3350-3649) and '''R32A''' (cars 3650-3949); the former was paid by the city's capital budget and the latter was paid through a revenue bond. All were arranged as married pairs. The R32s were the first mass-produced [[stainless steel]] cars built for the New York City Subway. \n\nA ceremonial introduction trip for the new R32 \"Brightliners\" cars was held on September 9, 1964. Various modifications were made over the years to the R32 fleet. In the late 1980s, all of the R32 cars were rebuilt, with ten cars being rebuilt by [[General Electric]] and the remaining cars being rebuilt by [[Morrison Knudsen]]. As part of the refurbishment, the original rollsigns and express/local marker lights at the end of each car were replaced with flipdot signs. After refurbishment, the R32 and R32A cars were renamed R32 Phase I, R32 Phase II, and R32 GE. The [[R160 (New York City Subway car)|R160s]] replaced most of the R32s in the late 2000s, though about one-third of the original fleet remained, all being Phase I R32s. The rest of the R32s were retired in early 2020 and replaced with the [[R179 (New York City Subway car)|R179]]s.<ref name=\"retired\"/> Some cars were saved for various purposes throughout the New York City Subway system, including as museum exhibits or work cars.\n\n==Description==\nThe R32s were numbered 3350\u20133949, but some cars have been re-numbered outside of this range or to different numbers in this range. They were the first cars to introduce all-mylar route and destination rollsigns instead of the former cotton cloth or linen type rollsigns found on prior rail cars.\n\nThe R32 contract was divided into two subcontracts of 300 cars each: '''R32''' (cars 3350-3649) and '''R32A''' (cars 3650-3949).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nycsubway.org/wiki/R-32_(Budd,_1964) |title=R-32 (Budd, 1964) |website=nycsubway.org |language=en |access-date=April 27, 2017}}</ref> The R32As were funded through the proceeds of a revenue bond, while the R32s were paid for out of the 1963\u20131964 New York City capital budget.

The next lowest bidder came in at $117,900 per car, which was for low-alloy steel cars. Budd low-balled the price to win the contract and introduce stainless steel equipment to the modern [[New York City Subway]] system, a plan that was met with limited success.<ref name=\":2\" /> NYCTA allowed a premium for subsequent stainless steel contracts, and all subsequent equipment was at least partly constructed of stainless steel. However, the Budd Company never benefited from the change, as they failed to win further contracts from the NYCTA, and the company has since halted production of railroad cars.\n\nThe R32 cars originally came with blue passenger doors and blue storm doors.
