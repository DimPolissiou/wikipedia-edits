The crosses are known as \"fitchy\" because the ends are pointed like stakes to facilitate driving them into the ground. The number of crosses is Trinitarian to represent the Blessed Trinity.\n\nThe crosses further commemorate the edict of King Charles V in 1376, when he reduced the number of fleur-de-lis in the French coat-of-arms to three in honor of the Three Divine Persons.

The crosses are known as \"fitchy\" because the ends are pointed like stakes to facilitate driving them into the ground. The number of crosses is Trinitarian to represent the Blessed Trinity.\n\nThe crosses further commemorate the edict of King Charles V in 1376, when he reduced the number of fleur-de-lis in the French coat-of-arms to three in honor of the Three Divine Persons.

When the Normans conquered the [[Abruzzi]], Sulmona increased in importance. [[Emperor Frederick II]] made it the capital of the \"Gran Giustizierato\" of the Abruzzi.\n\nLegend associates the evangelization of the district with the name of [[Saint Britius]], [[Bishop of Spoleto]], in the second century. The first known Bishop of Sulmona is Palladius (499); in 503 a Fortunatus Valvensis is mentioned. [[Pamphilus of Sulmona|Saint Pamphilus]], [[Bishop of Valva]], renowned for his sanctity and miracles, died about 706; he was buried in [[Sulmona Cathedral]].\n\nFour or five other bishops of Valva are known, but none of Sulmona until 1054, when [[Pope Leo IX]] named as [[Bishop of Valva]], the Benedictine Domenico, and determined the limits of the Dioceses of San Pelino ([[Saint Pelinus]]) (i.e., Valva) and San Panfilo (Saint Pamphilus) (i.e., Sulmona), which were to have only one bishop, elected by the two chapters. Under Bishop [[Giacomo di Penne]], a monk of [[Casa Nova]] (1252), it was arranged that the two chapters should unite in making the election, as frequent disputes had arisen when they acted separately.\n\nOther bishops were: Bartolomeo of Tocco (1402), esteemed for his learning by [[Pope Innocent VII]], who gave him his own [[mitre]]; Donato Bottini (1448), an Augustinian; Pompeo Zambeccari (1547), nuncio in Poland; Francesco Bonapaduli (1638); Pietro Antonio Corsignani (17380, the historian of the Abruzzi.\n\nDuring the dispute between the [[Holy See]] and the [[Kingdom of Naples]] the see remained vacant from 1800 till 1818.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15264c.htm''Catholic Encyclopedia'' article]</ref>\n\n==List of bishops==\nPostnominal initials:\n[[Benedictine Order|Benedictine]] = <small>OSB</small>,\n[[Order of Preachers|Dominican]] = <small>OP</small>,\n[[Cistercian]] = <small>OCist</small>,\n[[Order of Friars Minor|Franciscan]] = <small>OFM</small>,\n[[Conventual Franciscans|Minorite]] = <small>OFMC</small>,\n[[Order of Saint Augustine|Augustinian]] = <small>OESA</small>,\n[[Oratory of Saint Philip Neri|Oratorian]] = <small>CO</small>,\n[[Olivetan]] = <small>OSBOliv</small>\n\n* Geruntius (mentioned in 494/495), bishop of Valva\n* Palladius (mentioned in 499), bishop of Sulmona\n* Fortunatus (mentioned in 502), possibly bishop of Valva<ref>According to [[Francesco Lanzoni]], none of the three bishops named Fortunatus who took part in the council of Rome in 502 was a bishop of Valva.</ref>\n* [[Pamphilus of Sulmona|Pamphilus]] (mentioned in 682), bishop of Sulmona\n* Gradescus (mentioned in 701), bishop of Sulmona\n* Vadpert (mentioned in 775)\n* Ravennus (mentioned in 840)\n* Arnold (mentioned in 843)\n* Opitarmo (mentioned in 880)\n* Grimoald (mentioned in 968)\n* Theodulf (mentioned in 1010)\n* Transeric (mentioned in 1030)\n* Suabilo (mentioned in 1042)\n* Dominic <small>OSB</small> (1053\u20131073)\n* Transmund (1073\u20131080), dismissed\n* John (1092\u20131104)\n* Walter (1104\u20131124)\n* Odo (I) (1130\u20131140)\n* Gerald (1143\u20131146)\n* Siginulf (1146\u20131168)\n* Oderisius of Raino (1172\u20131193)\n* William (I) (1194\u20131206)\n* Odo (II) (1206 \u2013 before 6 May 1226)\n* Berard (1226\u20131227), elected but never confirmed\n* Nicholas (1227\u20131247)\n* Walter of Ocra (3 October<ref>This date is not certain.</ref> 1247 \u2013 1249)\n* James (I) <small>OCist</small> (1249\u20131251?)\n* James (II) <small>OP</small> (10 April 1252 \u2013 1263)\n** ''According to [[Pius Bonifacius Gams]],{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} there were two bishops named James, a Cistercian and then a Dominican.

When the Normans conquered the [[Abruzzi]], Sulmona increased in importance. [[Emperor Frederick II]] made it the capital of the \"Gran Giustizierato\" of the Abruzzi.\n\nLegend associates the evangelization of the district with the name of [[Saint Britius]], [[Bishop of Spoleto]], in the second century. The first known Bishop of Sulmona is Palladius (499); in 503 a Fortunatus Valvensis is mentioned. [[Pamphilus of Sulmona|Saint Pamphilus]], [[Bishop of Valva]], renowned for his sanctity and miracles, died about 706; he was buried in [[Sulmona Cathedral]].\n\nFour or five other bishops of Valva are known, but none of Sulmona until 1054, when [[Pope Leo IX]] named as [[Bishop of Valva]], the Benedictine Domenico, and determined the limits of the Dioceses of San Pelino ([[Saint Pelinus]]) (i.e., Valva) and San Panfilo (Saint Pamphilus) (i.e., Sulmona), which were to have only one bishop, elected by the two chapters. Under Bishop [[Giacomo di Penne]], a monk of [[Casa Nova]] (1252), it was arranged that the two chapters should unite in making the election, as frequent disputes had arisen when they acted separately.\n\nOther bishops were: Bartolomeo of Tocco (1402), esteemed for his learning by [[Pope Innocent VII]], who gave him his own [[mitre]]; Donato Bottini (1448), an Augustinian; Pompeo Zambeccari (1547), nuncio in Poland; Francesco Bonapaduli (1638); Pietro Antonio Corsignani (17380, the historian of the Abruzzi.\n\nDuring the dispute between the [[Holy See]] and the [[Kingdom of Naples]] the see remained vacant from 1800 till 1818.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15264c.htm''Catholic Encyclopedia'' article]</ref>\n\n==List of bishops==\nPostnominal initials:\n[[Benedictine Order|Benedictine]] = <small>OSB</small>,\n[[Order of Preachers|Dominican]] = <small>OP</small>,\n[[Cistercian]] = <small>OCist</small>,\n[[Order of Friars Minor|Franciscan]] = <small>OFM</small>,\n[[Conventual Franciscans|Minorite]] = <small>OFMC</small>,\n[[Order of Saint Augustine|Augustinian]] = <small>OESA</small>,\n[[Oratory of Saint Philip Neri|Oratorian]] = <small>CO</small>,\n[[Olivetan]] = <small>OSBOliv</small>\n\n* Geruntius (mentioned in 494/495), bishop of Valva\n* Palladius (mentioned in 499), bishop of Sulmona\n* Fortunatus (mentioned in 502), possibly bishop of Valva<ref>According to [[Francesco Lanzoni]], none of the three bishops named Fortunatus who took part in the council of Rome in 502 was a bishop of Valva.</ref>\n* [[Pamphilus of Sulmona|Pamphilus]] (mentioned in 682), bishop of Sulmona\n* Gradescus (mentioned in 701), bishop of Sulmona\n* Vadpert (mentioned in 775)\n* Ravennus (mentioned in 840)\n* Arnold (mentioned in 843)\n* Opitarmo (mentioned in 880)\n* Grimoald (mentioned in 968)\n* Theodulf (mentioned in 1010)\n* Transeric (mentioned in 1030)\n* Suabilo (mentioned in 1042)\n* Dominic <small>OSB</small> (1053\u20131073)\n* Transmund (1073\u20131080), dismissed\n* John (1092\u20131104)\n* Walter (1104\u20131124)\n* Odo (I) (1130\u20131140)\n* Gerald (1143\u20131146)\n* Siginulf (1146\u20131168)\n* Oderisius of Raino (1172\u20131193)\n* William (I) (1194\u20131206)\n* Odo (II) (1206 \u2013 before 6 May 1226)\n* Berard (1226\u20131227), elected but never confirmed\n* Nicholas (1227\u20131247)\n* Walter of Ocra (3 October<ref>This date is not certain.</ref> 1247 \u2013 1249)\n* James (I) <small>OCist</small> (1249\u20131251?)\n* James (II) <small>OP</small> (10 April 1252 \u2013 1263)\n** ''According to [[Pius Bonifacius Gams]],{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} there were two bishops named James, a Cistercian and then a Dominican.

It is a [[suffragan]] in the [[ecclesiastical province]] of the Metropolitan [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|Archbishop of San Francisco]]\n\n== Extent and statistics ==\nAs per 2015, its [[bishop]] pastorally serves 250,692 Catholics (18.4% of 1,361,162 total) on 15,995&nbsp;km\u00b2 in 35 parishes with 97 priests (83 diocesan, 14 religious), 51 deacons, 66 lay religious (15 brothers, 51 sisters), 6 seminarians and 12 missions.<ref name=\"gcatholic.org\">http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/stoc1.htm</ref>\n\nIt covers the secular Counties of [[Alpine County, California|Alpine]], [[Calaveras County, California|Calaveras]], [[Mono County, California|Mono]], [[San Joaquin County, California|San Joaquin]], [[Stanislaus County, California|Stanislaus]] and [[Tuolumne County, California|Tuolumne]].\n \nThe diocese is geographically and ethnically diverse. The majority of the population lives in the San Joaquin Valley. The two major population cities are Stockton and Modesto. The diocese has shown a significant population increase in all counties except Alpine County. The majority of San Joaquin Valley is farming, and there are many migrant camps in which the Church has a presence.\n\nCalaveras, Tuolumne and Alpine counties are located on the western side of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Most parishes in these counties date back to the gold rush days. Mono County is on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada Mountain range and is usually cut off from the rest of the diocese during winter. The parish church located in [[Mammoth Lakes, California|Mammoth Lakes]] provides for the spiritual care of vacationers during the winter and summer.\n\nThe largest racial/ethnic groups in the Diocese are White and Hispanic. There are  also many of Filipino and South East Asian descent. The largest Azorean Portuguese population outside the Azores is found in the Diocese of Stockton. It is estimated that 60% of the diocesan Catholic population is Hispanic. However, this does not imply that Spanish is their first language, only that their heritage is Spanish. The largest Pacific Island community is the Filipino community. Then the next largest ethnic concentration is Vietnamese. The USCCB statement Asian and Pacific Presence<ref>http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/cultural-diversity/asian-pacific-islander/asian-and-pacific-presence-harmony-in-faith.cfm</ref> lists the Diocese of Stockton as among the top thirty dioceses in the United States with the highest Asian and Pacific Island population. Within the Diocese, Mass is celebrated more than 180 times each Sunday in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Latin and Laotian. Weekday masses are celebrated in these languages and Vietnamese.\n\nIts fellow suffragans in the -mainly Californian- ecclesiastical province of the [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|Archbishop of San Francisco]] include the Dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu|Honolulu]] (on Hawaii), [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Las Vegas|Las Vegas]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Oakland|Oakland]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Reno|Reno]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sacramento|Sacramento]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Jose in California|San Jose]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Santa Rosa in California|Santa Rosa]].\n\n== History ==\nThe Diocese of Stockton was formed on January 13, 1962 on Californian territories split off from the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco|Archdiocese of San Francisco]] (which remains its  Metropolitan) and from the [[Diocese of Sacramento]]. In 1966 it gained more territory from the Diocese of Sacramento.\n\n===Sex Abuse and Bankruptcy===\nIn 1998 a jury awarded two brothers $30 million in a judgement against the Diocese of Stockton over its handling of a priest who sexually abused the men while they were boys, starting when they were three. At the trial it was revealed that in a 1976 letter to his superiors [[Oliver O'Grady]], the abusive priest, had admitted to sexually abusing an 11-year-old girl. In 1984 an attorney for the diocese promised to get O'Grady away from children, a promise recorded in a police report.  O'Grady abused the boys who later brought the suit from 1978-1991. In 1993 he pleaded guilty to abusing them and was sentenced to 14 years in prison.<ref>[http://www.bishop-accountability.org/ma-bos/settlements/SettlementStocktonOGrady.html reprent of ''San Francisco Chronicle'' July 16, 1998 article in bishopaccountability.org]</ref> During the O'Grady trial Mahony claimed that O'Grady was the only accused priest he dealt with in Stockton.  Later in 2004 Mahony admitted under oath that parents had confronted him with accusations against another priest in the diocese, Antonio Munoz.<ref>[http://bishop-accountability.org/member/psearch.jsp Bishopaccountability database on accusations against priests connected with the Stockton diocese]</ref> In 2014, the Diocese filed for [[Chapter 11 Bankruptcy]], which was later granted in 2017.<ref>http://www.pszjlaw.com/creditor-64.html</ref> As a result of the bankruptcy agreement, approximately $15 million had to be paid to various people who were sexually abused by clergy in the Diocese.<ref>https://www.uniondemocrat.com/localnews/4976000-151/embattled-stockton-diocese-nears-bankruptcy-exit-attorneys-and</ref>\n\n==Bishops==\n===Bishops of Stockton===\n# [[Hugh Aloysius

It is a [[suffragan]] in the [[ecclesiastical province]] of the Metropolitan [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|Archbishop of San Francisco]]\n\n== Extent and statistics ==\nAs per 2015, its [[bishop]] pastorally serves 250,692 Catholics (18.4% of 1,361,162 total) on 15,995 km\u00b2 in 35 parishes with 97 priests (83 diocesan, 14 religious), 51 deacons, 66 lay religious (15 brothers, 51 sisters), 6 seminarians and 12 missions.<ref name=\"gcatholic.org\">http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/stoc1.htm</ref>\n\nIt covers the secular Counties of [[Alpine County, California|Alpine]], [[Calaveras County, California|Calaveras]], [[Mono County, California|Mono]], [[San Joaquin County, California|San Joaquin]], [[Stanislaus County, California|Stanislaus]] and [[Tuolumne County, California|Tuolumne]].\n \nThe diocese is geographically and ethnically diverse. The majority of the population lives in the San Joaquin Valley. The two major population cities are Stockton and Modesto. The diocese has shown a significant population increase in all counties except Alpine County. The majority of San Joaquin Valley is farming, and there are many migrant camps in which the Church has a presence.\n\nCalaveras, Tuolumne and Alpine counties are located on the western side of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Most parishes in these counties date back to the gold rush days. Mono County is on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada Mountain range and is usually cut off from the rest of the diocese during winter. The parish church located in [[Mammoth Lakes, California|Mammoth Lakes]] provides for the spiritual care of vacationers during the winter and summer.\n\nThe largest racial/ethnic groups in the Diocese are White and Hispanic. There are  also many of Filipino and South East Asian descent. The largest Azorean Portuguese population outside the Azores is found in the Diocese of Stockton. It is estimated that 60% of the diocesan Catholic population is Hispanic. However, this does not imply that Spanish is their first language, only that their heritage is Spanish. The largest Pacific Island community is the Filipino community. Then the next largest ethnic concentration is Vietnamese. The USCCB statement Asian and Pacific Presence<ref>http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/cultural-diversity/asian-pacific-islander/asian-and-pacific-presence-harmony-in-faith.cfm</ref> lists the Diocese of Stockton as among the top thirty dioceses in the United States with the highest Asian and Pacific Island population. Within the Diocese, Mass is celebrated more than 180 times each Sunday in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Latin and Laotian. Weekday masses are celebrated in these languages and Vietnamese.\n\nIts fellow suffragans in the -mainly Californian- ecclesiastical province of the [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|Archbishop of San Francisco]] include the Dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu|Honolulu]] (on Hawaii), [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Las Vegas|Las Vegas]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Oakland|Oakland]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Reno|Reno]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sacramento|Sacramento]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Jose in California|San Jose]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Santa Rosa in California|Santa Rosa]].\n\n== History ==\nThe Diocese of Stockton was formed on January 13, 1962 on Californian territories split off from the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco|Archdiocese of San Francisco]] (which remains its  Metropolitan) and from the [[Diocese of Sacramento]]. In 1966 it gained more territory from the Diocese of Sacramento.\n\n===Sex Abuse and Bankruptcy===\nIn 1998 a jury awarded two brothers $30 million in a judgement against the Diocese of Stockton over its handling of a priest who sexually abused the men while they were boys, starting when they were three. At the trial it was revealed that in a 1976 letter to his superiors [[Oliver O'Grady]], the abusive priest, had admitted to sexually abusing an 11-year-old girl. In 1984 an attorney for the diocese promised to get O'Grady away from children, a promise recorded in a police report.  O'Grady abused the boys who later brought the suit from 1978-1991. In 1993 he pleaded guilty to abusing them and was sentenced to 14 years in prison.<ref>[http://www.bishop-accountability.org/ma-bos/settlements/SettlementStocktonOGrady.html reprent of ''San Francisco Chronicle'' July 16, 1998 article in bishopaccountability.org]</ref> During the O'Grady trial Mahony claimed that O'Grady was the only accused priest he dealt with in Stockton.  Later in 2004 Mahony admitted under oath that parents had confronted him with accusations against another priest in the diocese, Antonio Munoz.<ref>[http://bishop-accountability.org/member/psearch.jsp Bishopaccountability database on accusations against priests connected with the Stockton diocese]</ref> In 2014, the Diocese filed for [[Chapter 11 Bankruptcy]], which was later granted in 2017.<ref>http://www.pszjlaw.com/creditor-64.html</ref> As a result of the bankruptcy agreement, approximately $15 million had to be paid to various people who were sexually abused by clergy in the Diocese.<ref>https://www.uniondemocrat.com/localnews/4976000-151/embattled-stockton-diocese-nears-bankruptcy-exit-attorneys-and</ref>\n\n==Bishops==\n===Bishops of Stockton===\n# [[Hugh Aloysius
