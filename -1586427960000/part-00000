One present day landmark still running through the area, having extensive ties with the coal mining history, is the [[Wyrley and Essington Canal]]. The 'Curly Wyrley' was once used to transport coal via [[narrowboat]] to fuel industry in the neighbouring industrial havens of [[Walsall]], [[Wednesbury]] and [[Dudley]], seeing that New Invention, and [[Black Country]], coal played a key part in the success of the British Empire. The coal and industry has now disappeared and the canal serves as a pathway toward the factory lined towpaths of Walsall.\n\nThere are also strong links to the area's lock and key making history, with two major factories formerly being located here, 'Yale' locks and 'Squires' locks.  Yale closed during the 1980s and Squires was demolished during the mid-2000s, due to the age of the building, and relocated in Essington.\n\nThe urban development of New Invention mainly began during the 1950s; prior to this it was a largely rural settlement dominated mainly by farmland and rural collieries.

The film concerns a scientist who creates a telescope-like device that captures light waves from the Andromeda Galaxy, giving him a way to view the distant past. Using this knowledge, he travels to Africa to locate a large, unusual meteorite that fell there a billion years earlier. He discovers that the meteorite is composed of a poisonous unknown element, \"Radium X\". After exposure to its rays begins to make him glow in the dark, his touch becomes deadly, and he begins to be slowly driven mad.\n\nPrior to production, Universal Pictures was originally developing the film ''Bluebeard'' for Karloff and Lugosi. When that production did not start, Universal wanted a release by the end of 1935 with Karloff and Lugosi and hired director [[Stuart Armstrong Walker|Stuart Walker]] and screenwriter [[John Colton (screenwriter)|John Colton]] to make the film ''The Invisible Ray''. As Walker was not happy with Colton's script, he requested a three day delay before production was set to begin and after being denied this, he left the production and was replaced with [[Lambert Hillyer]]. Hillyer began and completed the film over-budget and over the originally set production time. \n\n==Plot==\nA visionary astronomer, Dr. Janos Rukh ([[Boris Karloff]]), has invented a telescope that can look far out into deep space, into the [[Andromeda Galaxy]], and photograph light rays that will show the Earth's past. He has theorized about this being possible for some years, much to his discredit among his fellow scientist-colleagues. Looking at the remote past on a planetarium-like dome in his lab, two of those ardently skeptical scientists, Dr. Benet ([[Bela Lugosi]]) and Sir Francis Stevens ([[Walter Kingsford]]), watch a large [[meteorite]] smash into the Earth a billion years ago, in what is now the continent of Africa. Amazed by Rukh's demonstration, the pair invite him to go on an expedition to locate the impact site. \n\nRukh finds the meteorite, but is exposed to its unknown radiation, now dubbed \"[[List of fictional elements, materials, isotopes and atomic particles|Radium X]]\". This causes him to glow in the dark and to make his mere touch instantaneous deadly to any living thing. The exposure also begins to warp his mind. Returning to the base camp, he entreats Dr. Benet to devise a means of neutralizing Radium X's poisoning effect. Benet develops a serum that holds the lethal element's toxicity at bay, but Rukh must take regular doses of the antidote or he will revert to being a luminous killing machine. Rukh returns to his jungle base and learns from Benet that this situation has been complicated by the romantic relationship between Rukh's wife, Diana ([[Frances Drake]]), and Ronald Drake ([[Frank Lawton]]), the nephew of Lady Arabella Stevens ([[Beulah Bondi]]), Dr. Stevens' wife.\n\nBenet takes a piece of the meteorite back to Europe, where he modifies its effects to help people, including curing the blind. Working along similar lines, Rukh cures his mother's blindness, but in spite of her warning, he goes to Paris to confront Benet and the others. There, he pretends to acknowledge his wife's new relationship with Drake, but in reality, it is the first step in his plan for revenge. Rukh murders a Frenchman he closely resembles, making it appear that he has died and been rendered unrecognizable due to an accident with Radium X. \n\nBelieving the deception, Diana marries Ronald. Rukh now begins to use his radiation poisoning to kill off the expedition members. He marks each death by disintegrating a single statue on the exterior of a church across from where he is hiding. Each time, he focuses the radiation through a window using a raygun-like device. He manages to kill both Stevenses before the police realize what is happening. Dr. Benet helps them set a trap by convening a scientific conference at his home to discuss Radium X, but Rukh secretly gains access and kills Benet. He has saved his revenge on Ronald and Diana for last but finds himself unable to kill his former wife. This hesitation brings him to a confrontation with his mother, the most important woman in his life. She has foreseen her son's growing madness and smashes the last of his antidote bottles in order to stop him. As the Radium X begins to consume him from within, Rukh jumps from a window. He disappears in an explosive flame, having been vaporized before reaching the ground.\n\n==Cast==\nCredits adapted from the book ''Universal Horrors''.{{sfn|Weaver|Brunas|Brunas|2007|p=154}}\n* [[Boris Karloff]] as Dr. Janos Rukh \n* [[B\u00e9la Lugosi]] as Dr. Felix Benet\n* [[Frances Drake (actor)|Frances Drake]] as Diana Rukh\n* [[Frank Lawton]] as Ronald Drake\n* [[Violet Kemble Cooper]] as Mother Rukh\n* [[Walter Kingsford]] as Sir Francis Stevens\n* [[Beulah Bondi]] as Lady Arabella Stevens\n* [[Frank Reicher]] as Professor Meiklejohn\n* [[Paul Weigel]] as Monsieur Noyer\n* [[Georges Renavent]] as Chief of the S\u00fbret\u00e9\n\n==Production==\nProducer David Diamond who teamed up actors [[Bela Lugosi]] and [[Boris Karloff]] for ''[[The Raven (1935 film)|The Raven]]'' had plans to reunite the two actors in an upcoming Karloff film ''Bluebeard''.{{sfn|Weaver|Brunas|Brunas|2007|p=154}} The script for ''Bluebeard'' did not proceed as expected leading the studio executives at [[Universal Pictures]] to put that film on hold and put Lugosi and Karloff in a different film.{{sfn|Weaver|Brunas|Brunas|2007|p=154}} In August 1935, the studio announced that production on ''The Invisible Ray'' would commence with producer [[Edmund Grainger]].{{sfn|Weaver|Brunas|Brunas|2007|p=154}}\n\nAt the time of production, Universal Pictures was among reports that the studio was going to be sold.{{sfn|Weaver|Brunas|Brunas|2007|p=154}} Pressure was put on the first initial director [[Stuart Armstrong Walker|Stuart Walker]] who was not happy with the original script written by [[John Colton (screenwriter)|John Colton]].{{sfn|Weaver|Brunas|Brunas|2007|p=154}} Walker requested a three-day delay on the production to work on the script which was refused by Universal Studios which led Walker leaving the production.{{sfn|Weaver|Brunas|Brunas|2007|p=154}}{{sfn|Weaver|Brunas|Brunas|2007|p=155}} Walker responded to trade papers on leaving the picture stating that he was enthusiastic about the films story and the cast but he \"did not feel that [he] could do the studio or [himself] justice under their conditions that came up suddenly.\"{{sfn|Weaver|Brunas|Brunas|2007|p=155}} Walker declared that he \"suggested that some other director would be better for the assignment.

First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).
