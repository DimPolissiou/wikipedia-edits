That led to changes in salinity.<ref name=Pie\u00f1kowskiFACIES/> The Drzewica Formation was influenced by an ancient swampy-lagoonal sub-system, with Deltaic currents depositing fluvial sediments. The Main Boreholes show eustatic changes on the marine conditions, with a retreat of the sea level, leading to the appearance of vegetation and abundant pollen on the uppermost parts of the formation. The regressive phase of sea level is represented by the [[Komorowo Beds]] and\nUpper Slawecin Beds along with the Drzewica Formation. As the level of the sea recovered on the Toarcian, mostly of the setting turn out to be a bathial marine bottom.<ref>Feldman-Olszewska, A. (1997).

The Main Boreholes show eustatic changes on the marine conditions, with a retreat of the sea level, leading to the appearance of vegetation and abundant pollen on the uppermost parts of the formation. The regressive phase of sea level is represented by the [[Komorowo Beds]] and\nUpper Slawecin Beds along with the Drzewica Formation. As the level of the sea recovered on the Toarcian, mostly of the setting turn out to be a bathial marine bottom.<ref>Feldman-Olszewska, A. (1997).

The trains were designated as [[British Rail Class 482|Class 482]] until 1 April 1994, when the operation of the line and the trains were transferred to [[London Underground]].<ref name=TFL/> The vehicles are essentially identical to those used on the Central line; the main difference being that trip-cocks are used for protection instead of ATO/ATP.\n\n[[Transport for London]] and [[Metronet]] closed the Waterloo & City line for five months from April to September 2006 to allow major upgrade work on the tunnels and rolling stock.

The refurbishment of the trains saw them painted in the London Underground white, red and blue livery in place of the [[Network SouthEast]] colours used since the stock's introduction.\n\n== Operation ==\nThe 1992 stock features both ATO (Automatic Train Operation) and ATP (Automatic Train Protection) which effectively allow the trains to drive themselves. The ATO is responsible for operating the train whilst the ATP detects electronic codes in the track and feeds them to the cab, displaying the target speed limits. This functionality is configured via a switch in the driver's cab which can be set to one of three positions: Automatic, Coded Manual and Restricted Manual.\n\nIn ''Automatic'' mode the ATO and ATP are both fully operational. The driver is only required to open and close the doors and press a pair of \"Start\" buttons when the train is ready to depart. The driver is then tasked with overseeing the operation of the system and can intervene at any time. The ATO controls the train to the desired target speed, whilst the ATP is ready to apply the emergency brakes if the Maximum Safe Speed is exceeded.\n\nIn ''Coded Manual'' mode, the ATO is disabled and the driver operates the train manually, however, the ATP is still detecting the codes in the track and restricting the driver's actions. The [[speedometer]] on 1992 stock is of the horizontal strip design showing two speeds: the Current Speed in green, indicating the speed at which the train is actually travelling, and the Target Speed indicating the speed at which the train should be travelling. Although the target speed is always active whilst running in Automatic or Coded Manual mode, in the latter mode a change in the target speed is indicated with an upwards or downwards tone depending on whether the target speed is increasing or decreasing. Should the driver exceed the target speed, an alarm sounds and the emergency brakes are automatically applied until the train is below the target speed; the alarm then stops.\n\nIn ''Restricted Manual'' mode, the train cannot exceed {{convert|18|km/h|0|abbr=on}} and the motors automatically cut out at {{convert|16|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. The ATO and ATP are both disabled and the driver operates the train entirely by sight and according to the signals. This mode is used when there has been an ATP or signal failure, or in a depot where ATP is not used, e.g. West Ruislip and Hainault depots. On the main line, driving in ATO is the same for a train driver as driving through a section where signals have failed.\n\n== Announcer system ==\n{{Summarize section|date=November 2019}}\nThe 1992 Stock was the first of its type on the Underground to have a DVA (Digital Voice Announcer) from new. Until 2003, the DVA was voiced by then BBC journalist and presenter Janet Mayo, subsequently nicknamed 'Sonia', as some drivers thought the repetitiveness of the announcements 'gets on ya nerves'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.squarewheels.org.uk/rly/stock/1992tubeStock/#sonia|title=1992 tube stock: Sonia|accessdate=2014-07-13|work=SQUAREWHEELS.org.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014044448/http://www.squarewheels.org.uk/rly/stock/1992tubeStock/#sonia|archive-date=14 October 2006|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe original format of the announcements were as follows:\n\n*''{{LUL stations|station=Bank}}, going eastbound to {{LUL stations|station=Hainault}} via {{LUL stations|station=Newbury Park}}:''\n*:\"This is Bank.

Emma continues to voice the line, despite London Underground allegedly 'sacking' her after an article by the ''Daily Mail'' was published in 2007. The article took her words from an interview out of context; saying that she \"hated the tube,\" when in actual fact, she just said that she would not like to be in a tube carriage voiced by herself for self-conscious reasons.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7113545.stm</ref>\n\nThe present format of the announcements is as follows:\n\n*''{{LUL stations|station=Bank}}, going eastbound to {{LUL stations|station=Hainault}} via {{LUL stations|station=Newbury Park}}:''\n*:\"This is Bank.

The collision resulted in one door being ripped off and a number of broken windows. 32 passengers received minor injuries.<ref>{{cite web |title=Final report |url=https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090325194353/http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/pdf/incident-chancerylane-final.pdf |publisher=RAIB |accessdate=7 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181209124951/https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090325194353/http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/pdf/incident-chancerylane-final.pdf |archive-date=9 December 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe cause of the derailment was determined to be the detachment of the rearmost [[traction motor]] on the fifth car, caused by a gearbox failure.

Some of the noticeable changes include a new seat moquette, improved lighting and improvements to the window frames. The front of the driving cabs are also being renewed. This includes repairing water ingress and replacing a large number of parts with a much simpler design, saving costs on future work. The new-style front end can be easily identified by the red panelling instead of the original grey. The refresh comes after nearly twenty years of continuous service on the Central line.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} \n\n=== Waterloo & City line units ===\n[[File:65507 at Bank LUL station.jpg|thumb|A Waterloo & City line 1992 Stock in its original Network SouthEast livery.

During this period, the 1992 Stock units in use on the line were removed by crane from [[Waterloo Underground Depot|Waterloo depot]] and taken by road to [[Wabtec Rail]] in [[Doncaster]] for refurbishment. External changes included repainting the trains, which were still in Network SouthEast livery, into London Underground's corporate livery.

Should the driver exceed the target speed, an alarm sounds and the emergency brakes are automatically applied until the train is below the target speed; the alarm then stops.\n\nIn ''Restricted Manual'' mode, the train cannot exceed {{convert|18|km/h|0|abbr=on}} and the motors automatically cut out at {{convert|16|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. The ATO and ATP are both disabled and the driver operates the train entirely by sight and according to the signals. This mode is used when there has been an ATP or signal failure, or in a depot where ATP is not used, e.g. West Ruislip and Hainault depots. On the main line, driving in ATO is the same for a train driver as driving through a section where signals have failed.\n\n== Announcer system ==\n{{Summarize section|date=November 2019}}\nThe 1992 Stock was the first of its type on the Underground to have a DVA (Digital Voice Announcer) from new.

Emma continues to voice the line, despite London Underground allegedly 'sacking' her after an article by the ''Daily Mail'' was published in 2007. The article took her words from an interview out of context; saying that she \"hated the tube,\" when in actual fact, she just said that she would not like to be in a tube carriage voiced by herself for self-conscious reasons.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7113545.stm</ref>\n\nThe present format of the announcements is as follows:\n\n*''{{LUL stations|station=Bank}}, going eastbound to {{LUL stations|station=Hainault}} via {{LUL stations|station=Newbury Park}}:''\n*:\"This is Bank.

When Juanes was 17, he started his first band, [[Ekhymosis]], in 1988, which went on to release Eight albums, achieving recognition in his native country of Colombia. The track \"Dos\" from the album ''Ni\u00f1o Gigante'' in 1992 was very popular. In 1997 after the band broke up, Juanes continued solo and in 2000 he released the album, ''F\u00edjate Bien'', which earned him three Latin Grammys. His follow-up album, ''[[Un D\u00eda Normal]]'', was released in 2000 and was later certified platinum in Guatemala and Uruguay throughout Latin America.  Juanes' third album, ''[[Mi Sangre]]'' (2004), which became an international bestseller, managing to position well in a number of countries around the world, achieved success due to the single \"[[La Camisa Negra]]\".

Twenty years hence naturalists may be in a position to say whether this is, or is not, the case; but in either event they will owe the author of \"The Origin of Species\" an immense debt of gratitude.... And viewed as a whole, we do not believe that, since the publication of Von Baer's \"Researches on Development,\" thirty years ago, any work has appeared calculated to exert so large an influence, not only on the future of Biology, but in extending the domination of Science over regions of thought into which she has, as yet, hardly penetrated.<ref name=\"westminster\" />}}\n\nThese are the basic tenets of evolution by natural selection as defined by Darwin:\n\n# More individuals are produced each generation than can survive.\n# Phenotypic variation exists among individuals and the variation is heritable.\n# Those individuals with heritable traits better suited to the environment will survive.\n# When reproductive isolation occurs new species will form.\n\nAnother important evolutionary theorist of the same period was the Russian geographer and prominent anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]] who, in his book ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'' (1902), advocated a conception of Darwinism counter to that of Huxley. His conception was centred around what he saw as the widespread use of co-operation as a survival mechanism in human societies and animals. He used biological and [[Sociology|sociological]] arguments in an attempt to show that the main factor in facilitating evolution is cooperation between individuals in free-associated societies and groups. This was in order to counteract the conception of fierce [[Competition (biology)|competition]] as the core of evolution, which provided a [[Rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]] for the dominant political, economic and social theories of the time; and the prevalent interpretations of Darwinism, such as those by Huxley, who is targeted as an opponent by Kropotkin. Kropotkin's conception of Darwinism could be summed up by the following quote:\n\n{{quotation|In the animal world we have seen that the vast majority of species live in societies, and that they find in association the best arms for the struggle for life: understood, of course, in its wide Darwinian sense\u2014not as a struggle for the sheer means of existence, but as a struggle against all natural conditions unfavourable to the species. The animal species, in which individual struggle has been reduced to its narrowest limits, and the practice of mutual aid has attained the greatest development, are invariably the most numerous, the most prosperous, and the most open to further progress. The mutual protection which is obtained in this case, the possibility of attaining old age and of accumulating experience, the higher intellectual development, and the further growth of sociable habits, secure the maintenance of the species, its extension, and its further progressive evolution. The unsociable species, on the contrary, are doomed to decay.<ref>{{harvnb|Kropotkin|1902|p=293}}</ref>|Peter Kropotkin|Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1902), Conclusion}}\n\n==Other 19th-century usage==\n\"Darwinism\" soon came to stand for an entire range of evolutionary (and often revolutionary) philosophies about both biology and society. One of the more prominent approaches, summed in the 1864 phrase \"[[survival of the fittest]]\" by Herbert Spencer, later became emblematic of Darwinism even though Spencer's own understanding of evolution (as expressed in 1857) was more similar to that of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] than to that of Darwin, and predated the [[publication of Darwin's theory]] in 1859. What is now called \"[[Social Darwinism]]\" was, in its day, synonymous with \"Darwinism\"\u2014the application of Darwinian principles of \"struggle\" to society, usually in support of anti-[[philanthropy|philanthropic]] political agenda. Another interpretation, one notably favoured by Darwin's half-cousin [[Francis Galton]], was that \"Darwinism\" implied that because natural selection was apparently no longer working on \"civilized\" people, it was possible for \"inferior\" strains of people (who would normally be filtered out of the [[gene pool]]) to overwhelm the \"superior\" strains, and voluntary corrective measures would be desirable\u2014the foundation of [[eugenics]].\n\n{{anchor|Darwinismus}}\nIn Darwin's day there was no rigid definition of the term \"Darwinism\", and it was used by opponents and proponents of Darwin's biological theory alike to mean whatever they wanted it to in a larger context. The ideas had international influence, and [[Ernst Haeckel]] developed what was known as ''Darwinismus'' in Germany, although, like Spencer's \"evolution\", Haeckel's \"Darwinism\" had only a rough resemblance to the theory of Charles Darwin, and was not centered on natural selection.<ref>Schmitt S.

His conception was centred around what he saw as the widespread use of co-operation as a survival mechanism in human societies and animals. He used biological and [[Sociology|sociological]] arguments in an attempt to show that the main factor in facilitating evolution is cooperation between individuals in free-associated societies and groups. This was in order to counteract the conception of fierce [[Competition (biology)|competition]] as the core of evolution, which provided a [[Rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]] for the dominant political, economic and social theories of the time; and the prevalent interpretations of Darwinism, such as those by Huxley, who is targeted as an opponent by Kropotkin. Kropotkin's conception of Darwinism could be summed up by the following quote:\n\n{{quotation|In the animal world we have seen that the vast majority of species live in societies, and that they find in association the best arms for the struggle for life: understood, of course, in its wide Darwinian sense\u2014not as a struggle for the sheer means of existence, but as a struggle against all natural conditions unfavourable to the species. The animal species, in which individual struggle has been reduced to its narrowest limits, and the practice of mutual aid has attained the greatest development, are invariably the most numerous, the most prosperous, and the most open to further progress. The mutual protection which is obtained in this case, the possibility of attaining old age and of accumulating experience, the higher intellectual development, and the further growth of sociable habits, secure the maintenance of the species, its extension, and its further progressive evolution.

One of the more prominent approaches, summed in the 1864 phrase \"[[survival of the fittest]]\" by Herbert Spencer, later became emblematic of Darwinism even though Spencer's own understanding of evolution (as expressed in 1857) was more similar to that of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] than to that of Darwin, and predated the [[publication of Darwin's theory]] in 1859. What is now called \"[[Social Darwinism]]\" was, in its day, synonymous with \"Darwinism\"\u2014the application of Darwinian principles of \"struggle\" to society, usually in support of anti-[[philanthropy|philanthropic]] political agenda. Another interpretation, one notably favoured by Darwin's half-cousin [[Francis Galton]], was that \"Darwinism\" implied that because natural selection was apparently no longer working on \"civilized\" people, it was possible for \"inferior\" strains of people (who would normally be filtered out of the [[gene pool]]) to overwhelm the \"superior\" strains, and voluntary corrective measures would be desirable\u2014the foundation of [[eugenics]].\n\n{{anchor|Darwinismus}}\nIn Darwin's day there was no rigid definition of the term \"Darwinism\", and it was used by opponents and proponents of Darwin's biological theory alike to mean whatever they wanted it to in a larger context. The ideas had international influence, and [[Ernst Haeckel]] developed what was known as ''Darwinismus'' in Germany, although, like Spencer's \"evolution\", Haeckel's \"Darwinism\" had only a rough resemblance to the theory of Charles Darwin, and was not centered on natural selection.<ref>Schmitt S.
