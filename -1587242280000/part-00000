During the closure of the Bay Ridge-bound platform, the glazed tiles at the station were heavily defaced with graffiti, and were cleaned prior to the station's reopening with a heavy duty cleaner, which damaged the glazing. A modification to the contract was approved on May 23, 1994. As part of the modification, new graffiti resistant ceramic tile was installed, signage, advertising panels, benches and trash bins were removed and reinstalled, exhaust systems were added in the porter rooms at both platforms, and the wall-mounted conductors board was replaced by a ceiling-mounted one.

The error may also be used when a server does not wish to disclose whether it has the requested information or not.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.4|title=RFC 7231, HTTP/1.1 Semantics and Content, Section 6.5.4 404 Not Found|publisher=ietf.org|date=June 2014|accessdate=2018-12-13}}</ref>\n\nThe website hosting server will typically generate a \"404 Not Found\" web page when a user attempts to follow a [[link rot|broken or dead link]]; hence the 404 error is one of the most recognizable errors encountered on the [[World Wide Web]].\n\n==Overview==\n\nWhen communicating via HTTP, a server is required to respond to a request, such as a [[web browser]] request for a [[web page]], with a numeric response code and an optional, mandatory, or disallowed (based upon the status code) message. In the code 404, the first digit indicates a client error, such as a mistyped [[Uniform Resource Locator]] (URL). The following two digits indicate the specific error encountered. HTTP's use of three-digit codes is similar to the use of such codes in earlier protocols such as [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] and [[Network News Transfer Protocol|NNTP]]. At the HTTP level, a 404 response code is followed by a human-readable \"reason phrase\". The HTTP specification suggests the phrase \"Not Found\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.4|title=RFC 7231, HTTP/1.1 Semantics and Content, Section 6.5.4 404 Not Found|publisher=ietf.org|date=June 2014|accessdate=2018-12-13}}</ref> and many web servers by default issue an HTML page that includes both the 404 code and the \"Not Found\" phrase.\n\nA 404 error is often returned when pages have been moved or deleted. In the first case, it is better to employ [[URL mapping]] or [[URL redirection]] by returning a 301 Moved Permanently response, which can be configured in most server configuration files, or through [[URL rewriting]]; in the second case, a 410 Gone should be returned. Because these two options require special server configuration, most websites do not make use of them.\n\n404 errors should not be confused with [[Domain Name System|DNS]] errors, which appear when the given URL refers to a server name that does not exist. A 404 error indicates that the server itself was found, but that the server was not able to retrieve the requested page.\n\n==Soft 404 errors==\n{{anchor|Soft 404}}\n\nSome websites report a \"not found\" error by returning a standard web page with a \"200 OK\" response code, falsely reporting that the page loaded properly; this is known as a ''soft 404''. The term \"soft 404\" was introduced in 2004 by Ziv Bar-Yossef ''et al''.\u044e\u0439\u0445\u0439\u0431\u043c\u043d <ref>{{Cite book |title=Sic Transit Gloria Telae: Towards an Understanding of the Web's Decay |journal=Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW) |author1=Ziv Bar-Yossef |author2=Andrei Z.

If the proxy server is unable to satisfy a request for a page because of a problem with the remote host (such as hostname resolution failures or refused TCP connections), this should be described as a 5xx Internal Server Error, but might deliver a 404 instead. This can confuse programs that expect and act on specific responses, as they can no longer easily distinguish between an absent web server and a missing web page on a web server that is present.\n\n=== Intentional 404s ===\nIn July 2004, the UK telecom provider [[BT Group]] deployed the [[Cleanfeed (content blocking system)|Cleanfeed]] content blocking system, which returns a 404 error to any request for content identified as potentially illegal by the [[Internet Watch Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://publicaffairs.linx.net/news/?p=154 |title=LINX Public Affairs \u00bb Cleanfeed: the facts |publisher=Publicaffairs.linx.net |date=10 September 2004 |accessdate=6 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513071912/https://publicaffairs.linx.net/news/?p=154 |archive-date=13 May 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Other ISPs return a [[HTTP 403]] \"forbidden\" error in the same circumstances.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://airbrake.io/blog/http-errors/403-forbidden-error|title=DEMON \u2013 Error 403|accessdate=14 June 2012}}</ref> The practice of employing fake 404 errors as a means to conceal [[censorship]] has also been reported in [[Thailand]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/tech/technews/11872/the-old-fake-404-not-found-routine |title=The old fake '404 Not Found' routine |newspaper =Bangkok Post |date=18 February 2009 | first = Don | last = Sambandaraksa |accessdate=12 September 2010}}</ref> and [[Tunisia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://opennet.net/node/950 |title=Tunisian journalist sues government agency for blocking Facebook, claims damage for the use of 404 error message instead of 403 |first=Helmi |last=Noman |date=12 September 2008 |publisher= Open Net Initiative |accessdate=21 November 2010}}</ref> In Tunisia, where censorship was severe before the [[Tunisian Revolution|2011 revolution]], people became aware of the nature of the fake 404 errors and created an imaginary character named \"[[Ammar 404#Censorship during the Ben Ali regime|Ammar 404]]\" who represents \"the invisible censor\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2010/05/27/anti-censorship-movement-in-tunisia-creativity-courage-and-hope/ |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120707/http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2010/05/27/anti-censorship-movement-in-tunisia-creativity-courage-and-hope/ |archivedate=7 July 2012 |title=Anti-censorship movement in Tunisia: creativity, courage and hope! |publisher=Global Voices Advocacy |date=27 May 2010 |accessdate=28 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Microsoft Internet Server 404 substatus error codes==\nThe webserver software developed by Microsoft, [[Internet Information Services|Microsoft's Internet Information Services]] (IIS), returns a set of substatus codes with its 404 responses.

In the code 404, the first digit indicates a client error, such as a mistyped [[Uniform Resource Locator]] (URL). The following two digits indicate the specific error encountered. HTTP's use of three-digit codes is similar to the use of such codes in earlier protocols such as [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] and [[Network News Transfer Protocol|NNTP]]. At the HTTP level, a 404 response code is followed by a human-readable \"reason phrase\". The HTTP specification suggests the phrase \"Not Found\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.4|title=RFC 7231, HTTP/1.1 Semantics and Content, Section 6.5.4 404 Not Found|publisher=ietf.org|date=June 2014|accessdate=2018-12-13}}</ref> and many web servers by default issue an HTML page that includes both the 404 code and the \"Not Found\" phrase.\n\nA 404 error is often returned when pages have been moved or deleted. In the first case, it is better to employ [[URL mapping]] or [[URL redirection]] by returning a 301 Moved Permanently response, which can be configured in most server configuration files, or through [[URL rewriting]]; in the second case, a 410 Gone should be returned. Because these two options require special server configuration, most websites do not make use of them.\n\n404 errors should not be confused with [[Domain Name System|DNS]] errors, which appear when the given URL refers to a server name that does not exist. A 404 error indicates that the server itself was found, but that the server was not able to retrieve the requested page.\n\n==Soft 404 errors==\n{{anchor|Soft 404}}\n\nSome websites report a \"not found\" error by returning a standard web page with a \"200 OK\" response code, falsely reporting that the page loaded properly; this is known as a ''soft 404''. The term \"soft 404\" was introduced in 2004 by Ziv Bar-Yossef ''et al''.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Sic Transit Gloria Telae: Towards an Understanding of the Web's Decay |journal=Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW) |author1=Ziv Bar-Yossef |author2=Andrei Z.

Some search engines, like Yahoo and Google, use automated processes to detect soft 404s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://help.yahoo.com/l/nl/yahoo/ysearch/slurp/slurp-10.html |title=Why is your crawler asking for strange URLs that have never existed on my site? |publisher=Yahoo Ysearch Help page |accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref> Soft 404s can occur as a result of configuration errors when using certain HTTP server software, for example with the [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] software, when an Error Document 404 (specified in a [[.htaccess]] file) is specified as an absolute path (e.g. <nowiki>http://example.com/error.html</nowiki>) rather than a relative path (/error.html).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2008/08/farewell-to-soft-404s.html|title=Farewell to soft 404s |publisher=Google Official Blog|accessdate=20 September 2008}}</ref> This can also be done on purpose to force some browsers (like [[Internet Explorer]]) to display a customized 404 error message rather than replacing what is served with a browser-specific \"friendly\" error message (in Internet Explorer, this behavior is triggered when a 404 is served and the received HTML is shorter than a certain length, and can be manually disabled by the user).\n\nThere are also \"soft 3XX\" errors where content is returned with a status 200 but it comes from a redirected page, such as when missing pages are redirected to the domain root/home page.\n\n=== Proxy servers ===\nSome [[proxy server]]s generate a 404 error when a [[List of HTTP status codes#List of HTTP status codes|500-range error code]] would be more correct. If the proxy server is unable to satisfy a request for a page because of a problem with the remote host (such as hostname resolution failures or refused TCP connections), this should be described as a 5xx Internal Server Error, but might deliver a 404 instead. This can confuse programs that expect and act on specific responses, as they can no longer easily distinguish between an absent web server and a missing web page on a web server that is present.\n\n=== Intentional 404s ===\nIn July 2004, the UK telecom provider [[BT Group]] deployed the [[Cleanfeed (content blocking system)|Cleanfeed]] content blocking system, which returns a 404 error to any request for content identified as potentially illegal by the [[Internet Watch Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://publicaffairs.linx.net/news/?p=154 |title=LINX Public Affairs \u00bb Cleanfeed: the facts |publisher=Publicaffairs.linx.net |date=10 September 2004 |accessdate=6 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513071912/https://publicaffairs.linx.net/news/?p=154 |archive-date=13 May 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Other ISPs return a [[HTTP 403]] \"forbidden\" error in the same circumstances.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://airbrake.io/blog/http-errors/403-forbidden-error|title=DEMON \u2013 Error 403|accessdate=14 June 2012}}</ref> The practice of employing fake 404 errors as a means to conceal [[censorship]] has also been reported in [[Thailand]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/tech/technews/11872/the-old-fake-404-not-found-routine |title=The old fake '404 Not Found' routine |newspaper =Bangkok Post |date=18 February 2009 | first = Don | last = Sambandaraksa |accessdate=12 September 2010}}</ref> and [[Tunisia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://opennet.net/node/950 |title=Tunisian journalist sues government agency for blocking Facebook, claims damage for the use of 404 error message instead of 403 |first=Helmi |last=Noman |date=12 September 2008 |publisher= Open Net Initiative |accessdate=21 November 2010}}</ref> In Tunisia, where censorship was severe before the [[Tunisian Revolution|2011 revolution]], people became aware of the nature of the fake 404 errors and created an imaginary character named \"[[Ammar 404#Censorship during the Ben Ali regime|Ammar 404]]\" who represents \"the invisible censor\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2010/05/27/anti-censorship-movement-in-tunisia-creativity-courage-and-hope/ |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120707/http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2010/05/27/anti-censorship-movement-in-tunisia-creativity-courage-and-hope/ |archivedate=7 July 2012 |title=Anti-censorship movement in Tunisia: creativity, courage and hope! |publisher=Global Voices Advocacy |date=27 May 2010 |accessdate=28 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Microsoft Internet Server 404 substatus error codes==\nThe webserver software developed by Microsoft, [[Internet Information Services|Microsoft's Internet Information Services]] (IIS), returns a set of substatus codes with its 404 responses.

station|station]] on the [[BMT Fourth Avenue Line]] in [[Brooklyn]]. It is located at Prospect Avenue and Fourth Avenue near the convergence of the [[Gowanus, Brooklyn|Gowanus]], [[Greenwood Heights, Brooklyn|Greenwood Heights]], [[Park Slope]], and [[South Park Slope]] neighborhoods. It is served by the [[R (New York City Subway service)|R]] train at all times. The [[D (New York City Subway service)|D]] and [[N (New York City Subway service)|N]] trains also stop here during late nights, and some rush-hour [[W (New York City Subway service)|W]] trains stop here in the peak direction.\n\nThe Prospect Avenue station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line, which was approved in 1905. Construction on the segment of the line that includes Prospect Avenue started on December 20, 1909, and was completed in May 1912. The station opened on June 22, 1915 as part of the initial portion of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line to [[59th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|59th Street]]. The station's platforms were lengthened in 1925, and again in 1970. The station was also renovated in 1970 and 2017.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Prospect Av station before renewal (38060731396).jpg|thumb|left|The station prior to renovation]]\n\n=== Construction ===\nThe Prospect Avenue station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line, the plan for which was initially adopted on June 1, 1905.<ref name=\":123\">{{Cite journal|last=Rogoff|first=David|date=May 1961|title=The Fourth Ave. Subway|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzKvSWhrQBW4d3pvOGZaSERiZEhpQ24xT19DTktkQUVlLW5j/view|journal=New York Division Bulletin|publisher=Electric Railroaders' Association|volume=|pages=2\u201310|access-date=May 8, 2017|via=}}</ref> The Rapid Transit Commission was succeeded on July 1, 1907, by the [[New York Public Service Commission|New York State Public Service Commission]] (PSC), which approved the plan for the line in late 1907.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XoxBAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA18&dq=4th+Avenue+line#v=onepage&q=4th%20Avenue%20line&f=false|page=18|title=Fourth Avenue Subway, Brooklyn's New Transportation Line: A Part of the Dual System of Rapid Transit of the City of New York|date=June 19, 1915|publisher=Public Service Commission|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":11\">{{Cite news|last=|first=|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/48901678/|title=Fourth Avenue Subway Is Sent To A Committee|date=March 20, 1908|work=The Brooklyn Daily Eagle|access-date=May 4, 2017|pages=1\u20132|language=en}}</ref> The contract for the section of the line that included the Prospect Avenue station, Route 11A3, which extended from 10th Street to 27th Street, was awarded on May 22, 1908, and approved by the [[New York City Board of Estimate]] on October 29, 1909.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://bklyn.newspapers.com/image/53922207/|title=Fourth Avenue Subway To Be Political Issue|date=December 11, 1908|work=The Brooklyn Daily Eagle|access-date=May 4, 2017|page=1|language=en}}</ref> Construction on the segment started on December 20, 1909, and was completed in May 1912.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite journal|last=Rogoff|first=David|date=May 1961|title=The Fourth Ave. Subway|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzKvSWhrQBW4d3pvOGZaSERiZEhpQ24xT19DTktkQUVlLW5j/view|journal=New York Division Bulletin|publisher=Electric Railroaders' Association|volume=|pages=2\u201310|access-date=May 8, 2017|via=}}</ref>\n\nAs part of negotiations between New York City, the [[Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company]] (BRT) and the [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company]] for the expansion of the city's transit network, the line was leased to a subsidiary of the BRT.

It is served by the [[R (New York City Subway service)|R]] train at all times.\n\nThe Bay Ridge Avenue station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line, which was approved in 1905 and subsequently modified. Construction on the segment of the line that includes Bay Ridge Avenue started on January 24, 1913, and was completed in 1915. The station opened on January 15, 1916 as part of an extension of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line from [[59th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|59th Street]] to [[86th Street station (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|86th Street]]. The station's platforms were lengthened in 1925, and again in 1970. The station was also renovated during the 1970s and in 2017.\n\n== History ==\n===Construction and opening===\n[[File:Bay Ridge Avenue - Northbound Platform.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The station prior to renovation]]\nThe Bay Ridge Avenue station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line.

Malta had been [[French invasion of Malta|captured]] by a French expeditionary force during the [[Mediterranean campaign of 1798]], and garrisoned with 3,000 men under the command of [[Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois]]. After the British [[Royal Navy]] destroyed the French Mediterranean Fleet at the [[Battle of the Nile]] on 1 August 1798, the British were able to initiate a blockade of Malta, assisted by an uprising among the native Maltese population against French rule. After its retreat to Valletta, the French garrison faced severe food shortages, exacerbated by the effectiveness of the British blockade. Although small quantities of supplies arrived in early 1799, there was no further traffic until early 1800, by which time starvation and disease was having a disastrous effect on health, morale, and combat capability of the French troops.\n\nIn February 1800, a significant convoy under Contre-Admiral [[Jean-Baptiste Perr\u00e9e]] sent from [[Toulon]] made a determined effort to resupply the garrison. The blockade squadron under Rear-Admiral [[Horatio Nelson|Lord Nelson]] intercepted the convoy within sight of the starving troops on Malta. Perr\u00e9e was killed and his flagship captured in the ensuing, but brief [[Battle of the Malta Convoy (1800)]]; no supplies reached Malta. The following month, the [[ship of the line]] [[French ship Guillaume Tell (1795)|''Guillaume Tell'']] set sail from Valletta to Toulon, laden with soldiers, but this too was intercepted and in [[Action of 31 March 1800|a hard-fought battle]] was forced to surrender to a larger British squadron. These defeats rendered the French position on Valletta untenable, and its surrender inevitable. Although Vaubois held out for another five months, he eventually surrendered on 4 September and Malta was taken by Britain.\n\n==French invasion of Malta==\n{{details|French invasion of Malta|Mediterranean campaign of 1798}}\n[[File:Nap malta.jpg|thumb|Napoleon landing in Malta, June 1798]]\n\nOn 19 May 1798, a French fleet sailed from [[Toulon]], escorting an expeditionary force of over 30,000 men under General [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. The force was destined for Egypt, Bonaparte seeking to expand French influence in Asia and force Britain to make peace in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], which had begun in 1792.<ref name=\"JC14\">Cole, p. 13</ref>  Sailing southeast, the convoy collected additional transports from Italian ports and at 05:30 on 9 June arrived off [[Valletta]], the heavily fortified port-city on the island of Malta.<ref name=\"WJ2:151\">James, Vol. 2, p. 151</ref> At this time, Malta and its neighbouring islands were ruled by the [[Knights of St. John]], an old and influential feudal order weakened by the loss of most of their revenue during the [[French Revolution]]. The order was composed of men from across Europe, including a significant proportion of Frenchmen, who ruled over the majority [[Maltese people|Maltese]] population of the islands.<ref name=\"JC10\">Cole, p. 10</ref> The head of government was [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master]] [[Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim]], who refused Bonaparte's demand that his entire convoy be allowed to enter Valletta and take on supplies, insisting that Malta's neutrality meant that only two ships could enter at a time.<ref name=\"JC8\">Cole, p. 8</ref>\n\n[[File:Napoleon Malta.png|thumb|Capitulation of Malta to general Bonaparte]]\nOn receiving this reply, Bonaparte immediately ordered his fleet to bombard Valletta and on 11 June General [[Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers]] directed an [[amphibious operation]] in which several thousand soldiers landed at seven strategic sites around the island. The French Knights deserted the order, and the remaining Knights failed to mount a meaningful resistance. Approximately 2,000 native Maltese militia resisted for 24 hours, retreating to Valletta once the city of [[Mdina]] fell to General [[Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois]].<ref name=\"JC9\">Cole, p. 9</ref> Although Valletta was strong enough to hold out against a lengthy siege, Bonaparte negotiated a surrender with Hompesch, who agreed to turn Malta and all of its resources over to the French in exchange for estates and pensions in France for himself and his knights.<ref name=\"RG21\">Gardiner, p. 21</ref> Bonaparte then established a French garrison on the islands, leaving 4,000 men under Vaubois while he and the rest of the expeditionary force sailed eastwards for [[Alexandria]] on 19 June.<ref name=\"RLA13\">Adkins, p. 13</ref>\n\n===Battle of the Nile===\n{{details|Battle of the Nile}}\nBonaparte's convoy was pursued across the Mediterranean by a British fleet of 14 ships under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Horatio Nelson]], who learned of the invasion of Malta while anchored off [[Sicily]], and subsequently attempted to intercept the French on their passage to Egypt. Nelson's force overtook the French fleet on the night of 22 June in the dark without discovering their presence, and arrived off Alexandria on 28 June ahead of Bonaparte.<ref name=\"NM254\">Mostert, p. 254</ref> Believing that the French must have had a different objective, Nelson turned northwards the following day to investigate the coast of [[Anatolia]] and missed Bonaparte's arrival on 30 June by less than 24 hours.<ref name=\"EB187\">Bradford, p. 187</ref> Unopposed, Bonaparte landed his army and marched on Alexandria, capturing the city and turning inland. The fleet was ordered to anchor in nearby [[Aboukir Bay]] and await further instructions.<ref name=\"WJ2:159\">James, Vol. 2, p. 159</ref> On 1 August, Nelson returned to the Egyptian coast and discovered the French fleet at anchor. Attacking immediately, Nelson's ships managed to capture nine French ships of the line and destroy two, including the flagship [[French ship Orient|''Orient'']] with only moderate damage to themselves.<ref name=\"NM272\">Mostert, p. 272</ref> The destruction of the French Mediterranean fleet granted control of the sea to the Royal Navy, soon joined by the navies of [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] as part of the hastily organised [[Second Coalition]] against France.<ref name=\"RG58\">Gardiner, p. 58</ref>\n\n==Maltese uprising==\n[[File:Francesco Saverio Caruana.jpg|thumb|Canon [[Francesco Saverio Caruana]], one of the Maltese insurgent leaders. He later became [[Bishop of Malta]].]]\n\nOn Malta, the French had rapidly dismantled the institutions of the Knights of St. John, including the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Church property was looted and seized to pay for the expedition to Egypt,<ref name=\"JC10\"/> an act that generated considerable anger among the deeply religious Maltese population. On 2 September, this anger erupted in a popular uprising during an auction of church property, and within days thousands of Maltese irregulars had driven the French garrison into Valletta.<ref name=\"RG67\">Gardiner, p. 67</ref> Valletta was surrounded by approximately 10,000 [[National Congress Battalions|irregular Maltese soldiers]] led by [[Emmanuele Vitale]] and Canon [[Francesco Saverio Caruana]]. The Maltese were armed with 23 cannon and a small squadron of coastal gunboats. Although there was intermittent skirmishing between the garrison and the Maltese, the fortress was too strong for the irregulars to assault.<ref name=\"WJ2:189\"/>\n\nIn mid-September, a squadron of Portuguese ships had arrived at the island. They included the [[Nossa Senhora da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o (1771 ship)|''Pr\u00edncipe Real'']] (90 cannons; Captain Puysigur), [[Portuguese ship Rainha de Portugal|''Rainha de Portugal'']] (74; Captain Thomas Stone), [[Portuguese ship S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o|''S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o'']] (74; Captain Mitchell), [[Portuguese ship Afonso de Albuquerque|''Afonso de Albuquerque'']] (74; Captain Donald Campbell), and the brig [[Portuguese brig Falc\u00e3o|''Falc\u00e3o'']] (24; Captain Duncan). All were under the command of Domingos Xavier de Lima, [[Count of Vidigueira|Marquess of Niza]].<ref name=\"WJ2:188\"/> In addition, the British ship {{HMS|Lion|1777|6}} (Captain [[Manley Dixon]]) and the fireship {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}} (Captain George Baker) were attached to the squadron. The Portuguese government had sent this force from the Tagus to augment Nelson's fleet. After a brief stay off Malta the squadron continued to Alexandria. There Nelson sent the squadron back to blockade Malta.<ref name=\"WLC376\">Clowes, p. 376.</ref>\n\nLate in September, a British convoy consisting of 13 battered ships under Captain [[Sir James Saumarez]] appeared off the island. Survivors of the Battle of the Nile, they were in urgent need of repair and unable to directly assist in the siege.<ref name=\"WJ2:188\">James, Vol. 2, p. 188</ref> Nevertheless, Saumarez met with representatives of the Maltese and on 25 September, sent an offer of truce to Vaubois on their behalf. Vaubois replied ''\"Vous avez, sans doute, oubli\u00e9 que des Fran\u00e7ais sont dans la place. Le sort des habitans '' [sic] '' ne vous regarde pointe. Quant \u00e0 votre sommation, les soldats fran\u00e7ais ne sont point habitu\u00e9s \u00e0 ce style\"'' (\"You might have forgotten that the French hold this place. The fate of the inhabitants is none of your concern. As for your ultimatum, French soldiers are not accustomed to such a tone\").<ref name=\"WJ2:188\"/> Unable to persuade the French to give in, Saumarez instead provided the Maltese forces with 1,200 [[musket]]s with which to continue the siege<ref name=\"WLC374\">Clowes, p. 374</ref> and, unable to delay repairs any longer, sailed for [[Gibraltar]] at the end of the month.\n\nOn 12 October, the British ships of the line [[HMS Alexander (1778)|HMS ''Alexander'']] under Captain [[Alexander Ball]], [[HMS Culloden (1783)|HMS ''Culloden'']] under Captain [[Thomas Troubridge]] and [[HMS Colossus (1787)|HMS ''Colossus'']] under Captain [[George Murray (Royal Navy officer)|George Murray]] joined Niza's ships off Malta, marking the formal start of the blockade.<ref name=\"WJ2:189\">James, Vol. 2, p. 189</ref> On the same day, Vaubois withdrew the last of his soldiers into the fortified new city of Valletta, accompanied by approximately 100 Maltese nationals who had joined the French forces.<ref name=\"WJ2:189\"/> The garrison numbered over 3,000 men and initially at least was well supplied. In the harbour lay the ships of the line [[French ship D\u00e9go (1798)|''D\u00e9go'']] and [[HMS Athenienne (1800)|''Ath\u00e9nien'']] and the frigate [[French frigate Carthaginoise|''Carthaginoise'']], all of which were former ships of the Maltese Navy, as well as the newly arrived [[French ship Guillaume Tell (1795)|''Guillaume Tell'']] and frigates ''[[French frigate Justice (1794)|Justice]]'' and ''[[French frigate Diane (1796)|Diane]]'', survivors of the Battle of the Nile under Rear-Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]], which had reached Malta at the end of September.<ref name=\"WLC374\"/>\n\n===Capture of Gozo===\nOn 24 October, after a ten-day passage from Naples,<ref name=\"EB222\">Bradford, p. 222</ref> Nelson joined the blockade squadron in [[HMS Vanguard (1787)|HMS ''Vanguard'']] accompanied by [[HMS Minotaur (1793)|HMS ''Minotaur'']].<ref name=\"WLC374\"/> On 28 October, Ball successfully completed negotiations with the French garrison on the small island of [[Gozo]], the 217 French soldiers there agreeing to surrender without a fight and transferring the island, its fortifications, 24 cannon, a large quantity of ammunition and 3,200 sacks of flour to the British.<ref name=\"WJ2:189\"/> Although the island was formally claimed by [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|King Ferdinand of Naples]], it was administered by British and Maltese representatives, whose first action was to distribute the captured food supplies to the island's 16,000 inhabitants. Malta and the surrounding islands were not self-sufficient and quickly the challenge of feeding the population became a strain on the islands' resources, particularly with so many men under arms, Although now formally in command of the islands, King Ferdinand refused to assist with supplies, and the responsibility was left to Ball and his captains to arrange for the transport of supplies from Italy.<ref name=\"RG67\"/> By the end of the year, the number of Maltese troops in the field had fallen from 10,000 to 1,500, supported by 500 [[Royal Marines|British]] and [[Portuguese Marine Corps|Portuguese marines]] from the blockade squadron.<ref name=\"RG68\"/> The blockade fleet, consisting of five British and four Portuguese ships, operated from [[St. Paul's Bay]] and [[Marsaxlokk|Marsa Sirocco]] (now Marsaxlokk) on the island of Malta itself.<ref name=\"RG67\"/>\n\n==Blockade==\n[[File:Malta - Santa Venera - Triq il-Kbira San Guzepp + Casa Leoni 01 ies.jpg|thumb|[[Casa Leoni]], the command base for the [[National Congress Battalions|Maltese insurgents]]]]\n[[File:Tal-Borg Battery map.png|thumb|Map of [[Tal-Borg Battery]], one of the [[Fortifications of Malta#French occupation (1798\u20131800)|batteries]] built by the Maltese to bombard French positions and repel any counterattack]]\n\n1799 was a frustrating year for the British and Maltese forces deployed against Malta, as efforts to secure sufficient forces to prosecute the siege were repeatedly denied. Major-General [[James St Clair-Erskine, 2nd Earl of Rosslyn|James St Clair-Erskine]], commander of [[British Army]] forces in the Mediterranean, considered the ongoing [[War of the Second Coalition]] in Italy and the defence of [[Menorca]] to be higher priorities than Ball's siege, while the defeated Neapolitans continued to refuse assistance. A Russian squadron under Admiral [[Fyodor Fyodorovich Ushakov]] briefly appeared off the island in January, but was almost immediately ordered to join the Russian and Turkish forces besieging the island of [[Corfu]].<ref name=\"RG68\">Gardiner, p. 68</ref> In addition to the difficulties the Allies faced in obtaining food for the Maltese population, the French succeeded in bringing supplies through the blockade in the early part of the year: in January 1799 a [[schooner]] reached Valletta from [[Ancona]], and in February the frigate [[French frigate Boudeuse (1766)|''Boudeuse'']] evaded the blockade and entered the port with supplies from [[Toulon]].<ref name=\"WJ3:14\"/> In May, [[Bruix' expedition of 1799|a major French expedition]] under Admiral [[Etienne Eustache Bruix]] entered the Western Mediterranean, forcing Nelson to recall his scattered fleet from across the region, temporarily raising the blockade of Malta.<ref name=\"WLC390\">Clowes, p. 390</ref> During this operation a number of French supply ships took advantage of the absence of the British squadron to enter Valletta.<ref name=\"RG68\"/>\n\nHowever, despite these occasional supply ships, the French garrison was rapidly running out of food. To conserve resources, the French forced the civilian population out of the city; the civilian population dropped from 45,000 in 1799 to 9,000 by 1800.<ref name=\"WJ3:14\"/> Nelson himself took nominal command of the blockade, while Ball was made president of the Maltese National Congress. As liaison between the Maltese military and civilian commanders, he directed the distribution of supplies to the Maltese population, which was beginning to suffer from disease brought about by food shortages.<ref name=\"ODNBall\">{{ODNB |last=Frendo |first=Henry |title=Ball, Sir Alexander John |id=1210}}</ref> He was replaced on ''Alexander'' by his first lieutenant, William Harrington. On 1 November Nelson again offered terms of surrender to Vaubois, and was again rebuffed, with the reply ''\"Jaloux de m\u00e9riter l'estime de votre nation, comme vous recherchez celle de la n\u00f4tre, nous sommes r\u00e9solus d\u00e9fendre cette fortresse jusqu'\u00e0 l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9\"'' (\"Keen to deserve the esteem of your nation, as you seek that of ours, we are resolved to defend this fortress until the end\").<ref name=\"WJ3:14\"/> By this point, Nelson was conducting the blockade at a distance, based at the Neapolitan court in [[Palermo]]. There he indulged in gambling and social engagements, becoming closer and closer to [[Emma, Lady Hamilton]], wife of the ambassador [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]]. His behaviour was heavily criticised, not just by his commanding officer Vice-Admiral [[George Keith Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith|Lord Keith]], who had recently replaced Earl St Vincent, but also by old friends such as [[Thomas Troubridge]], who wrote to him \"If you knew what your friends feel for you I am sure you would cut out all the nocturnal parties . . . I beseech your Lordship, leave off\".<ref name=\"NM365\">Mostert, p. 365</ref> In December 1799, Erskine was replaced by Lieutenant-General [[Henry Edward Fox]], who immediately redistributed 800 troops from the garrison at [[Messina]] to Malta under Brigadier-General [[Thomas Graham, 1st Baron Lynedoch|Thomas Graham]]. These troops filled the gap left by the withdrawal of Portuguese forces, which had been ordered to return to [[Lisbon]].<ref name=\"RG68\"/> Disease began to spread within the city as rations became scarcer. The arrival of an [[aviso]] in January 1800 with the news of the events of [[18 Brumaire]] that made Bonaparte [[First Consul]] of France prompted a brief respite and a public statement from Vaubois that the city would never be surrendered, although conditions continued to deteriorate.<ref name=\"WJ3:14\"/>\n\n==Starvation and relief==\n\n===Convoy battles===\n{{details|Battle of the Malta Convoy (1800)}}\nAt the beginning of February 1800, the Neapolitan government, reinstated in Naples after being expelled the year before, finally agreed to participate in the siege and 1,200 troops were embarked on a squadron led by Vice-Admiral Lord Keith's flagship [[HMS Queen Charlotte (1790)|HMS ''Queen Charlotte'']] and landed on Malta.<ref name=\"WJ3:14\">James, Vol. 3, p. 14</ref> For a time, both Keith and Nelson remained with the blockade squadron, which consisted of six ships of the line, along with a few Neapolitan ships of the line, and several British and Neapolitan frigates. On 17 February a message arrived with the squadron from the frigate [[HMS Success (1781)|HMS ''Success'']], which had been stationed off Sicily to watch for French reinforcements. Captain [[Shuldham Peard]] reported that he was shadowing a squadron of six or seven French ships sailing in the direction of Malta.<ref name=\"EB245\">Bradford, p. 245</ref> These vessels were a relief squadron, sent from Toulon with extensive food supplies and 3,000 additional troops under Contre-Admiral [[Jean-Baptiste Perr\u00e9e]] in [[French ship Le G\u00e9n\u00e9reux|''G\u00e9n\u00e9reux'']], one of the ships of the line that had escaped at the Nile two years earlier.<ref name=\"WLC419\">Clowes, p. 419</ref> On 18 February, the convoy was sighted by lookouts on ''Alexander''. In the ensuing chase, ''Success'' captured a French transport and attacked the much larger ''G\u00e9n\u00e9reux''.<ref name=\"RW141\">Woodman, p. 141</ref> Although the frigate was damaged in the exchange, ''Success''<nowiki>'</nowiki> second broadside mortally wounded Perr\u00e9e and delayed the ship of the line long enough for [[HMS Foudroyant (1798)|HMS ''Foudroyant'']], under Lord Nelson, and [[HMS Northumberland (1798)|HMS ''Northumberland'']] to join the battle. Heavily outnumbered, ''G\u00e9n\u00e9reux'' surrendered.<ref name=\"EB247\">Bradford, p. 247</ref>\n\n{{details|Action of 31 March 1800}}\n[[File:Guillaume Tell PU5634.jpg|thumb|Capture of the ''Guillaume Tell'']]\nShortly after the capture of the ''G\u00e9n\u00e9reux'', Keith returned to the Italian coast in ''Queen Charlotte'', where his flagship was lost in a fire that killed more than 700 of its crew, although Keith was ashore at the time.<ref name=\"TG92\">Grocott, p. 92</ref> Before departing, Keith issued strict instructions to Nelson that he was not to return to Palermo, but was to confine any shore leave in Sicily to [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]. Nelson ignored the order and by late March was in Palermo conducting an open love affair with Emma Hamilton.<ref name=\"NM366\">Mostert, p. 366</ref> In his absence, Troubridge took over command of the blockade, delegating temporarily to Captain [[Manley Dixon]]. Dixon led the squadron on 31 March when ''Guillaume Tell'' attempted to break out on Valletta under Decr\u00e9s.<ref name=\"WJ3:16\"/> Spotted by the frigate [[HMS Penelope (1798)|HMS ''Penelope'']] under Captain [[Henry Blackwood]], ''Guillaume Tell'' was chased northwards and engaged by first ''Penelope'' and then by Dixon's [[HMS Lion (1777)|HMS ''Lion'']], driving both ships back but suffering severe damage.<ref name=\"WLC421\">Clowes, p. 421</ref> Eventually the arrival of the powerful ''Foudroyant'' under Captain [[Sir Edward Berry]] proved too much for Decr\u00e9s, but he continued fighting for another two hours before he was forced to surrender his battered and dismasted ship; in the engagement, he lost more than 200 men killed and wounded.<ref name=\"RW143\"/>\n\n===Nelson's cruise===\nIn the aftermath of these French defeats at sea, and with the food supply in Valletta dwindling, the British sent another demand for capitulation. Vaubois again refused, with the reply ''\"Cette place est en trop bon \u00e9tat, et je suis moi-m\u00eame trop jaloux de bien servir mon pays et de conserver mon honneur, por \u00e9couter vos propositions.\"'' (\"This place is in too good a situation, and I am too conscious of the service of my country and my honour, to listen to your proposals\").<ref name=\"WJ3:20\"/> In reality, the situation was dire: during February, prices of basic foodstuffs stood at 16 francs for a fowl, 12 francs for a rabbit, 20 sous for an egg, 18 sous for a lettuce, 40 sous for a rat and six francs per pound for fish. For the civilian typhus patients, the only food available was horse-flesh soup.<ref name=\"WJ3:16\">James, Vol. 3, p. 16</ref>\n\nOn 23 April, Nelson departed Palermo in ''Foudroyant'', with both Sir William and Emma Hamilton on board as his guests. The party visited Syracuse and then travelled on to Valletta, where Berry took ''Foudroyant'' so close to the harbour that the ship came under fire from the French batteries. It was not hit, but Nelson was furious that Emma had been taken into danger and immediately ordered Berry to withdraw. His anger was exacerbated by Emma's refusal to retire from the quarterdeck during the brief exchange.<ref name=\"EB249\">Bradford, p. 249</ref> From there, ''Foudroyant'' anchored at Marsa Sirocco, where Nelson and Emma lived together openly and were hosted by Troubridge and Graham. Sir William Hamilton, a prominent antiquarian as well as a diplomat, spent his time exploring the island.<ref name=\"EB250\">Bradford, p. 250</ref> By early June, Nelson and his party had returned to Palermo, the beginning of a lengthy overland journey across Europe to Britain. Nelson also detached ''Foudroyant'' and ''Alexander'' from the blockade, again in defiance of Keith's explicit orders, to assist the Neapolitan royal family in their passage to [[Livorno]].<ref name=\"NM374\">Mostert, p. 374</ref> Enraged at Nelson's disobedience, Keith publicly remarked that \"Lady Hamilton has had command of the fleet long enough\".<ref name=\"EB251\">Bradford, p. 251</ref> In May, Troubridge returned to Britain and was replaced in command by Captain [[George Martin (Royal Navy officer)|George Martin]], while Graham was succeeded by Major-General [[Henry Pigot]].<ref name=\"WJ3:21\">James, Vol. 3, p. 21</ref>\n\n===Surrender===\nThe British blockade continued to prevent French efforts to resupply Valletta during the early summer of 1800, and by August the situation was desperate: no horses or pack animals, dogs, cats, fowls or rabbits still lived within the city, the cisterns had been emptied and even firewood was in short supply. So desperate was the need for wood that the frigate ''Boudeuse'', trapped by the blockade, was broken up for fuel by the beleaguered garrison. With defeat now inevitable, Vaubois gave orders that the frigates ''Diane'' and ''Justice'' were to attempt a breakout for Toulon, with minimal crews of approximately 115 men each.<ref name=\"WJ3:20\">James, Vol. 3, p. 20</ref> On 24 August, when the wind was favourable and the night dark enough to obscure their movements, the frigates put to sea. Almost immediately, lookouts on HMS ''Success'' sighted them and Captain Peard gave chase, followed by HMS ''Genereux'' and ''Northumberland''. ''Diane'' under Captain Solen was too slow and Peard soon overhauled the under-strength French ship, which surrendered after a brief exchange of shot. The frigate later became HMS ''Niobe''. ''Justice'', under Captain Jean Villeneuve, was faster, however, and outran its pursuers, eventually making Toulon, the only ship from Malta to do so during the siege.<ref name=\"RW143\">Woodman, p. 143</ref>\n\nOn 3 September, with his men dying of starvation and disease at the rate of more than 100 a day, Vaubois called a council of his officers at which they unanimously decided to surrender.<ref name=\"WLC422\">Clowes, p. 422</ref> The next day, envoys were sent to the British and in the afternoon General Pigot and Captain Martin signed the agreed terms with Vaubois and Villeneuve. The Maltese were excluded from negotiations entirely, although their commander, Alexander Ball, subsequently became the first [[List of Civil Commissioners of Malta|Civil Commissioner of Malta]].<ref name=\"ODNBall\"/> The terms of the surrender were absolute: the island, its dependencies, fortifications and military supplies were all turned over to British control. This included the ships of the line ''[[HMS Athenienne (1800)|Athenien]]'' and ''[[French ship D\u00e9go (1798)|D\u00e9go]]'' and the frigate ''[[French frigate Carthaginoise|Carthag\u00e9naise]]'' (these were all French ships previously captured from the Order), although only ''Athenien'' was of sufficient standard to be incorporated into the Royal Navy, becoming HMS ''Athenienne''. The other ships were broken up in their berths. The British also took two merchant ships and a variety of smaller warships.<ref name=\"WLC423\">Clowes, p. 423</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe capture of Malta returned control of the central Mediterranean to Britain and was an important step in the invasion and liberation of Egypt from French rule in 1801.<ref name=\"RG78\">Gardiner, p. 78</ref>\n\nAn essential condition of the [[Treaty of Amiens]] in the same year, which brought an end to the French Revolutionary War, was that the British leave Malta. The [[Napoleonic Wars]] with the French Empire began soon afterwards, in part due to the unwillingness of the United Kingdom to comply with this clause of the treaty. The Russian [[Alexander I of Russia|Tsar Alexander I]] had a long-standing claim to the island as titular head of the Knights of St. John, and demanded that it be turned over to Russian control before agreeing any alliance with Britain. Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger]] flatly refused, and the Russians backed down, agreeing to an anti-French alliance.<ref name=\"NM461\">Mostert, p. 461</ref> \n\nThe island remained in British hands until [[Independence of Malta|its independence]] in 1964.<ref name=\"RG70\">Gardiner, p. 70</ref>\n\n==Commemoration==\nThe French surrender is one of three sieges that is celebrated on [[Victory Day (Malta)|''il-Vitorja'']] (Victory Day), held annually on 8 September.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.visitmalta.com/en/event-details/2018-09/il-vitorja-victory-day--11110 |title=IL-VITORJA (VICTORY DAY) |website=Visit Malta |publisher=Malta Tourism Authority |access-date=2018-09-06 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book\n | last = Adkins\n | first = Roy & Lesley\n | authorlink =\n | year = 2006\n | chapter =\n | title = The War for All the Oceans\n | publisher = Abacus\n | location =\n | isbn = 0-349-11916-3\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Bradford\n | first = Ernle\n | authorlink = Ernle Bradford\n | year = 1999 |origyear=1977\n | chapter =\n | title = Nelson: The Essential Hero\n | publisher = Wordsworth Military Library\n | location =\n | isbn = 1-84022-202-6\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Clowes\n | first = William Laird\n | authorlink = William Laird Clowes\n | year = 1997 |origyear=1900\n | chapter =\n | title = The Royal Navy, A History from the Earliest Times to 1900, Volume IV\n | publisher = Chatham Publishing\n | location =\n | isbn = 1-86176-013-2\n}}\n* {{cite book \n | last = Cole \n | first = Juan \n | title = Napoleon\u2019s Egypt; Invading the Middle East \n | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8rzGxWUQiKkC&printsec=frontcover&hl=es#v=onepage&q&f=false \n | year = 2007 \n | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan \n | isbn = 9781403964311 }}\n* {{cite book\n | author = Gardiner, Robert, ed<!-- work around since {{cite book}} seems to have a bug with respect to editor/origyear combos\n | editor =Gardiner, Robert -->\n | authorlink =\n | year = 2001\n | origyear=1996\n | chapter =\n | title = Nelson Against Napoleon\n | publisher = Caxton Editions\n | location =\n | isbn = 1-86176-026-4\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Grocott\n | first = Terence\n | authorlink =\n | year = 2002 |origyear=1997\n | chapter =\n | title = Shipwrecks of the Revolutionary & Napoleonic Era\n | publisher = Caxton Editions\n | location =\n | isbn = 1-84067-164-5\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = James\n | first = William\n | authorlink = William James (naval historian)\n | year = 2002 |origyear=1827\n | chapter =\n | title = The Naval History of Great Britain, Volume 2, 1797\u20131799\n | publisher = Conway Maritime Press\n | location =\n | isbn = 0-85177-906-9\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = James\n | first = William\n | authorlink = William James (naval historian)\n | year = 2002 |origyear=1827\n | chapter =\n | title = The Naval History of Great Britain, Volume 3, 1800\u20131805\n | publisher = Conway Maritime Press\n | location =\n | isbn = 0-85177-907-7\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Mostert\n | first = Noel\n | authorlink =\n | year = 2007\n | chapter =\n | title = The Line upon a Wind: The Greatest War Fought at Sea Under Sail 1793\u20131815\n | publisher = Vintage Books\n | location =\n | isbn = 978-0-7126-0927-2\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Woodman\n | first = Richard\n | authorlink = Richard Woodman\n | year = 2001\n | chapter =\n | title = The Sea Warriors\n | publisher = Constable Publishers\n | location =\n | isbn = 1-84119-183-3\n}}\n\n{{good article}}\n\n{{French occupation of Malta}}\n{{Malta topics}}\n{{British colonial campaigns}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Malta, Siege of}}\n[[Category:Battles of the French Revolutionary Wars]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1798]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1799]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1800]]\n[[Category:1798 in Malta]]\n[[Category:1799 in Malta]]\n[[Category:1800 in Malta]]\n[[Category:Wars involving Malta]]\n[[Category:Sieges involving Great Britain]]\n[[Category:Mediterranean campaign of 1798]]\n[[Category:Sieges involving Portugal]]\n[[Category:18th-century rebellions]]\n[[Category:Sieges involving Malta]]\n[[Category:18th century in Valletta]]\n[[Category:French occupation of Malta]]\n[[Category:Rebellions in Malta]]\n[[Category:Insurgencies in Europe]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2017}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n|conflict=Siege of Malta\n|partof=the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]\n|image=Ta' Xindi Farmhouse.jpeg\n|image_size=300px\n|caption=[[Ta' Xindi Farmhouse]], which was a Maltese insurgent field headquarters in 1798\u20131800.

Malta had been [[French invasion of Malta|captured]] by a French expeditionary force during the [[Mediterranean campaign of 1798]], and garrisoned with 3,000 men under the command of [[Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois]]. After the British [[Royal Navy]] destroyed the French Mediterranean Fleet at the [[Battle of the Nile]] on 1 August 1798, the British were able to initiate a blockade of Malta, assisted by an uprising among the native Maltese population against French rule. After its retreat to Valletta, the French garrison faced severe food shortages, exacerbated by the effectiveness of the British blockade. Although small quantities of supplies arrived in early 1799, there was no further traffic until early 1800, by which time starvation and disease was having a disastrous effect on health, morale, and combat capability of the French troops.\n\nIn February 1800, a significant convoy under Contre-Admiral [[Jean-Baptiste Perr\u00e9e]] sent from [[Toulon]] made a determined effort to resupply the garrison. The blockade squadron under Rear-Admiral [[Horatio Nelson|Lord Nelson]] intercepted the convoy within sight of the starving troops on Malta. Perr\u00e9e was killed and his flagship captured in the ensuing, but brief [[Battle of the Malta Convoy (1800)]]; no supplies reached Malta. The following month, the [[ship of the line]] [[French ship Guillaume Tell (1795)|''Guillaume Tell'']] set sail from Valletta to Toulon, laden with soldiers, but this too was intercepted and in [[Action of 31 March 1800|a hard-fought battle]] was forced to surrender to a larger British squadron. These defeats rendered the French position on Valletta untenable, and its surrender inevitable. Although Vaubois held out for another five months, he eventually surrendered on 4 September and Malta was taken by Britain.\n\n==French invasion of Malta==\n{{details|French invasion of Malta|Mediterranean campaign of 1798}}\n[[File:Nap malta.jpg|thumb|Napoleon landing in Malta, June 1798]]\n\nOn 19 May 1798, a French fleet sailed from [[Toulon]], escorting an expeditionary force of over 30,000 men under General [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. The force was destined for Egypt, Bonaparte seeking to expand French influence in Asia and force Britain to make peace in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], which had begun in 1792.<ref name=\"JC14\">Cole, p. 13</ref>  Sailing southeast, the convoy collected additional transports from Italian ports and at 05:30 on 9 June arrived off [[Valletta]], the heavily fortified port-city on the island of Malta.<ref name=\"WJ2:151\">James, Vol. 2, p. 151</ref> At this time, Malta and its neighbouring islands were ruled by the [[Knights of St. John]], an old and influential feudal order weakened by the loss of most of their revenue during the [[French Revolution]]. The order was composed of men from across Europe, including a significant proportion of Frenchmen, who ruled over the majority [[Maltese people|Maltese]] population of the islands.<ref name=\"JC10\">Cole, p. 10</ref> The head of government was [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master]] [[Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim]], who refused Bonaparte's demand that his entire convoy be allowed to enter Valletta and take on supplies, insisting that Malta's neutrality meant that only two ships could enter at a time.<ref name=\"JC8\">Cole, p. 8</ref>\n\n[[File:Napoleon Malta.png|thumb|Capitulation of Malta to general Bonaparte]]\nOn receiving this reply, Bonaparte immediately ordered his fleet to bombard Valletta and on 11 June General [[Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers]] directed an [[amphibious operation]] in which several thousand soldiers landed at seven strategic sites around the island. The French Knights deserted the order, and the remaining Knights failed to mount a meaningful resistance. Approximately 2,000 native Maltese militia resisted for 24 hours, retreating to Valletta once the city of [[Mdina]] fell to General [[Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois]].<ref name=\"JC9\">Cole, p. 9</ref> Although Valletta was strong enough to hold out against a lengthy siege, Bonaparte negotiated a surrender with Hompesch, who agreed to turn Malta and all of its resources over to the French in exchange for estates and pensions in France for himself and his knights.<ref name=\"RG21\">Gardiner, p. 21</ref> Bonaparte then established a French garrison on the islands, leaving 4,000 men under Vaubois while he and the rest of the expeditionary force sailed eastwards for [[Alexandria]] on 19 June.<ref name=\"RLA13\">Adkins, p. 13</ref>\n\n===Battle of the Nile===\n{{details|Battle of the Nile}}\nBonaparte's convoy was pursued across the Mediterranean by a British fleet of 14 ships under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Horatio Nelson]], who learned of the invasion of Malta while anchored off [[Sicily]], and subsequently attempted to intercept the French on their passage to Egypt. Nelson's force overtook the French fleet on the night of 22 June in the dark without discovering their presence, and arrived off Alexandria on 28 June ahead of Bonaparte.<ref name=\"NM254\">Mostert, p. 254</ref> Believing that the French must have had a different objective, Nelson turned northwards the following day to investigate the coast of [[Anatolia]] and missed Bonaparte's arrival on 30 June by less than 24 hours.<ref name=\"EB187\">Bradford, p. 187</ref> Unopposed, Bonaparte landed his army and marched on Alexandria, capturing the city and turning inland. The fleet was ordered to anchor in nearby [[Aboukir Bay]] and await further instructions.<ref name=\"WJ2:159\">James, Vol. 2, p. 159</ref> On 1 August, Nelson returned to the Egyptian coast and discovered the French fleet at anchor. Attacking immediately, Nelson's ships managed to capture nine French ships of the line and destroy two, including the flagship [[French ship Orient|''Orient'']] with only moderate damage to themselves.<ref name=\"NM272\">Mostert, p. 272</ref> The destruction of the French Mediterranean fleet granted control of the sea to the Royal Navy, soon joined by the navies of [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] as part of the hastily organised [[Second Coalition]] against France.<ref name=\"RG58\">Gardiner, p. 58</ref>\n\n==Maltese uprising==\n[[File:Francesco Saverio Caruana.jpg|thumb|Canon [[Francesco Saverio Caruana]], one of the Maltese insurgent leaders. He later became [[Bishop of Malta]].]]\n\nOn Malta, the French had rapidly dismantled the institutions of the Knights of St. John, including the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Church property was looted and seized to pay for the expedition to Egypt,<ref name=\"JC10\"/> an act that generated considerable anger among the deeply religious Maltese population. On 2 September, this anger erupted in a popular uprising during an auction of church property, and within days thousands of Maltese irregulars had driven the French garrison into Valletta.<ref name=\"RG67\">Gardiner, p. 67</ref> Valletta was surrounded by approximately 10,000 [[National Congress Battalions|irregular Maltese soldiers]] led by [[Emmanuele Vitale]] and Canon [[Francesco Saverio Caruana]]. The Maltese were armed with 23 cannon and a small squadron of coastal gunboats. Although there was intermittent skirmishing between the garrison and the Maltese, the fortress was too strong for the irregulars to assault.<ref name=\"WJ2:189\"/>\n\nIn mid-September, a squadron of Portuguese ships had arrived at the island. They included the [[Nossa Senhora da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o (1771 ship)|''Pr\u00edncipe Real'']] (90 cannons; Captain Puysigur), [[Portuguese ship Rainha de Portugal|''Rainha de Portugal'']] (74; Captain Thomas Stone), [[Portuguese ship S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o|''S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o'']] (74; Captain Mitchell), [[Portuguese ship Afonso de Albuquerque|''Afonso de Albuquerque'']] (74; Captain Donald Campbell), and the brig [[Portuguese brig Falc\u00e3o|''Falc\u00e3o'']] (24; Captain Duncan). All were under the command of Domingos Xavier de Lima, [[Count of Vidigueira|Marquess of Niza]].<ref name=\"WJ2:188\"/> In addition, the British ship {{HMS|Lion|1777|6}} (Captain [[Manley Dixon]]) and the fireship {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}} (Captain George Baker) were attached to the squadron. The Portuguese government had sent this force from the Tagus to augment Nelson's fleet. After a brief stay off Malta the squadron continued to Alexandria. There Nelson sent the squadron back to blockade Malta.<ref name=\"WLC376\">Clowes, p. 376.</ref>\n\nLate in September, a British convoy consisting of 13 battered ships under Captain [[Sir James Saumarez]] appeared off the island. Survivors of the Battle of the Nile, they were in urgent need of repair and unable to directly assist in the siege.<ref name=\"WJ2:188\">James, Vol. 2, p. 188</ref> Nevertheless, Saumarez met with representatives of the Maltese and on 25 September, sent an offer of truce to Vaubois on their behalf. Vaubois replied ''\"Vous avez, sans doute, oubli\u00e9 que des Fran\u00e7ais sont dans la place. Le sort des habitans '' [sic] '' ne vous regarde pointe. Quant \u00e0 votre sommation, les soldats fran\u00e7ais ne sont point habitu\u00e9s \u00e0 ce style\"'' (\"You might have forgotten that the French hold this place. The fate of the inhabitants is none of your concern. As for your ultimatum, French soldiers are not accustomed to such a tone\").<ref name=\"WJ2:188\"/> Unable to persuade the French to give in, Saumarez instead provided the Maltese forces with 1,200 [[musket]]s with which to continue the siege<ref name=\"WLC374\">Clowes, p. 374</ref> and, unable to delay repairs any longer, sailed for [[Gibraltar]] at the end of the month.\n\nOn 12 October, the British ships of the line [[HMS Alexander (1778)|HMS ''Alexander'']] under Captain [[Alexander Ball]], [[HMS Culloden (1783)|HMS ''Culloden'']] under Captain [[Thomas Troubridge]] and [[HMS Colossus (1787)|HMS ''Colossus'']] under Captain [[George Murray (Royal Navy officer)|George Murray]] joined Niza's ships off Malta, marking the formal start of the blockade.<ref name=\"WJ2:189\">James, Vol. 2, p. 189</ref> On the same day, Vaubois withdrew the last of his soldiers into the fortified new city of Valletta, accompanied by approximately 100 Maltese nationals who had joined the French forces.<ref name=\"WJ2:189\"/> The garrison numbered over 3,000 men and initially at least was well supplied. In the harbour lay the ships of the line [[French ship D\u00e9go (1798)|''D\u00e9go'']] and [[HMS Athenienne (1800)|''Ath\u00e9nien'']] and the frigate [[French frigate Carthaginoise|''Carthaginoise'']], all of which were former ships of the Maltese Navy, as well as the newly arrived [[French ship Guillaume Tell (1795)|''Guillaume Tell'']] and frigates ''[[French frigate Justice (1794)|Justice]]'' and ''[[French frigate Diane (1796)|Diane]]'', survivors of the Battle of the Nile under Rear-Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]], which had reached Malta at the end of September.<ref name=\"WLC374\"/>\n\n===Capture of Gozo===\nOn 24 October, after a ten-day passage from Naples,<ref name=\"EB222\">Bradford, p. 222</ref> Nelson joined the blockade squadron in [[HMS Vanguard (1787)|HMS ''Vanguard'']] accompanied by [[HMS Minotaur (1793)|HMS ''Minotaur'']].<ref name=\"WLC374\"/> On 28 October, Ball successfully completed negotiations with the French garrison on the small island of [[Gozo]], the 217 French soldiers there agreeing to surrender without a fight and transferring the island, its fortifications, 24 cannon, a large quantity of ammunition and 3,200 sacks of flour to the British.<ref name=\"WJ2:189\"/> Although the island was formally claimed by [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|King Ferdinand of Naples]], it was administered by British and Maltese representatives, whose first action was to distribute the captured food supplies to the island's 16,000 inhabitants. Malta and the surrounding islands were not self-sufficient and quickly the challenge of feeding the population became a strain on the islands' resources, particularly with so many men under arms, Although now formally in command of the islands, King Ferdinand refused to assist with supplies, and the responsibility was left to Ball and his captains to arrange for the transport of supplies from Italy.<ref name=\"RG67\"/> By the end of the year, the number of Maltese troops in the field had fallen from 10,000 to 1,500, supported by 500 [[Royal Marines|British]] and [[Portuguese Marine Corps|Portuguese marines]] from the blockade squadron.<ref name=\"RG68\"/> The blockade fleet, consisting of five British and four Portuguese ships, operated from [[St. Paul's Bay]] and [[Marsaxlokk|Marsa Sirocco]] (now Marsaxlokk) on the island of Malta itself.<ref name=\"RG67\"/>\n\n==Blockade==\n[[File:Malta - Santa Venera - Triq il-Kbira San Guzepp + Casa Leoni 01 ies.jpg|thumb|[[Casa Leoni]], the command base for the [[National Congress Battalions|Maltese insurgents]]]]\n[[File:Tal-Borg Battery map.png|thumb|Map of [[Tal-Borg Battery]], one of the [[Fortifications of Malta#French occupation (1798\u20131800)|batteries]] built by the Maltese to bombard French positions and repel any counterattack]]\n\n1799 was a frustrating year for the British and Maltese forces deployed against Malta, as efforts to secure sufficient forces to prosecute the siege were repeatedly denied. Major-General [[James St Clair-Erskine, 2nd Earl of Rosslyn|James St Clair-Erskine]], commander of [[British Army]] forces in the Mediterranean, considered the ongoing [[War of the Second Coalition]] in Italy and the defence of [[Menorca]] to be higher priorities than Ball's siege, while the defeated Neapolitans continued to refuse assistance. A Russian squadron under Admiral [[Fyodor Fyodorovich Ushakov]] briefly appeared off the island in January, but was almost immediately ordered to join the Russian and Turkish forces besieging the island of [[Corfu]].<ref name=\"RG68\">Gardiner, p. 68</ref> In addition to the difficulties the Allies faced in obtaining food for the Maltese population, the French succeeded in bringing supplies through the blockade in the early part of the year: in January 1799 a [[schooner]] reached Valletta from [[Ancona]], and in February the frigate [[French frigate Boudeuse (1766)|''Boudeuse'']] evaded the blockade and entered the port with supplies from [[Toulon]].<ref name=\"WJ3:14\"/> In May, [[Bruix' expedition of 1799|a major French expedition]] under Admiral [[Etienne Eustache Bruix]] entered the Western Mediterranean, forcing Nelson to recall his scattered fleet from across the region, temporarily raising the blockade of Malta.<ref name=\"WLC390\">Clowes, p. 390</ref> During this operation a number of French supply ships took advantage of the absence of the British squadron to enter Valletta.<ref name=\"RG68\"/>\n\nHowever, despite these occasional supply ships, the French garrison was rapidly running out of food. To conserve resources, the French forced the civilian population out of the city; the civilian population dropped from 45,000 in 1799 to 9,000 by 1800.<ref name=\"WJ3:14\"/> Nelson himself took nominal command of the blockade, while Ball was made president of the Maltese National Congress. As liaison between the Maltese military and civilian commanders, he directed the distribution of supplies to the Maltese population, which was beginning to suffer from disease brought about by food shortages.<ref name=\"ODNBall\">{{ODNB |last=Frendo |first=Henry |title=Ball, Sir Alexander John |id=1210}}</ref> He was replaced on ''Alexander'' by his first lieutenant, William Harrington. On 1 November Nelson again offered terms of surrender to Vaubois, and was again rebuffed, with the reply ''\"Jaloux de m\u00e9riter l'estime de votre nation, comme vous recherchez celle de la n\u00f4tre, nous sommes r\u00e9solus d\u00e9fendre cette fortresse jusqu'\u00e0 l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9\"'' (\"Keen to deserve the esteem of your nation, as you seek that of ours, we are resolved to defend this fortress until the end\").<ref name=\"WJ3:14\"/> By this point, Nelson was conducting the blockade at a distance, based at the Neapolitan court in [[Palermo]]. There he indulged in gambling and social engagements, becoming closer and closer to [[Emma, Lady Hamilton]], wife of the ambassador [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]]. His behaviour was heavily criticised, not just by his commanding officer Vice-Admiral [[George Keith Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith|Lord Keith]], who had recently replaced Earl St Vincent, but also by old friends such as [[Thomas Troubridge]], who wrote to him \"If you knew what your friends feel for you I am sure you would cut out all the nocturnal parties . . . I beseech your Lordship, leave off\".<ref name=\"NM365\">Mostert, p. 365</ref> In December 1799, Erskine was replaced by Lieutenant-General [[Henry Edward Fox]], who immediately redistributed 800 troops from the garrison at [[Messina]] to Malta under Brigadier-General [[Thomas Graham, 1st Baron Lynedoch|Thomas Graham]]. These troops filled the gap left by the withdrawal of Portuguese forces, which had been ordered to return to [[Lisbon]].<ref name=\"RG68\"/> Disease began to spread within the city as rations became scarcer. The arrival of an [[aviso]] in January 1800 with the news of the events of [[18 Brumaire]] that made Bonaparte [[First Consul]] of France prompted a brief respite and a public statement from Vaubois that the city would never be surrendered, although conditions continued to deteriorate.<ref name=\"WJ3:14\"/>\n\n==Starvation and relief==\n\n===Convoy battles===\n{{details|Battle of the Malta Convoy (1800)}}\nAt the beginning of February 1800, the Neapolitan government, reinstated in Naples after being expelled the year before, finally agreed to participate in the siege and 1,200 troops were embarked on a squadron led by Vice-Admiral Lord Keith's flagship [[HMS Queen Charlotte (1790)|HMS ''Queen Charlotte'']] and landed on Malta.<ref name=\"WJ3:14\">James, Vol. 3, p. 14</ref> For a time, both Keith and Nelson remained with the blockade squadron, which consisted of six ships of the line, along with a few Neapolitan ships of the line, and several British and Neapolitan frigates. On 17 February a message arrived with the squadron from the frigate [[HMS Success (1781)|HMS ''Success'']], which had been stationed off Sicily to watch for French reinforcements. Captain [[Shuldham Peard]] reported that he was shadowing a squadron of six or seven French ships sailing in the direction of Malta.<ref name=\"EB245\">Bradford, p. 245</ref> These vessels were a relief squadron, sent from Toulon with extensive food supplies and 3,000 additional troops under Contre-Admiral [[Jean-Baptiste Perr\u00e9e]] in [[French ship Le G\u00e9n\u00e9reux|''G\u00e9n\u00e9reux'']], one of the ships of the line that had escaped at the Nile two years earlier.<ref name=\"WLC419\">Clowes, p. 419</ref> On 18 February, the convoy was sighted by lookouts on ''Alexander''. In the ensuing chase, ''Success'' captured a French transport and attacked the much larger ''G\u00e9n\u00e9reux''.<ref name=\"RW141\">Woodman, p. 141</ref> Although the frigate was damaged in the exchange, ''Success''<nowiki>'</nowiki> second broadside mortally wounded Perr\u00e9e and delayed the ship of the line long enough for [[HMS Foudroyant (1798)|HMS ''Foudroyant'']], under Lord Nelson, and [[HMS Northumberland (1798)|HMS ''Northumberland'']] to join the battle. Heavily outnumbered, ''G\u00e9n\u00e9reux'' surrendered.<ref name=\"EB247\">Bradford, p. 247</ref>\n\n{{details|Action of 31 March 1800}}\n[[File:Guillaume Tell PU5634.jpg|thumb|Capture of the ''Guillaume Tell'']]\nShortly after the capture of the ''G\u00e9n\u00e9reux'', Keith returned to the Italian coast in ''Queen Charlotte'', where his flagship was lost in a fire that killed more than 700 of its crew, although Keith was ashore at the time.<ref name=\"TG92\">Grocott, p. 92</ref> Before departing, Keith issued strict instructions to Nelson that he was not to return to Palermo, but was to confine any shore leave in Sicily to [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]. Nelson ignored the order and by late March was in Palermo conducting an open love affair with Emma Hamilton.<ref name=\"NM366\">Mostert, p. 366</ref> In his absence, Troubridge took over command of the blockade, delegating temporarily to Captain [[Manley Dixon]]. Dixon led the squadron on 31 March when ''Guillaume Tell'' attempted to break out on Valletta under Decr\u00e9s.<ref name=\"WJ3:16\"/> Spotted by the frigate [[HMS Penelope (1798)|HMS ''Penelope'']] under Captain [[Henry Blackwood]], ''Guillaume Tell'' was chased northwards and engaged by first ''Penelope'' and then by Dixon's [[HMS Lion (1777)|HMS ''Lion'']], driving both ships back but suffering severe damage.<ref name=\"WLC421\">Clowes, p. 421</ref> Eventually the arrival of the powerful ''Foudroyant'' under Captain [[Sir Edward Berry]] proved too much for Decr\u00e9s, but he continued fighting for another two hours before he was forced to surrender his battered and dismasted ship; in the engagement, he lost more than 200 men killed and wounded.<ref name=\"RW143\"/>\n\n===Nelson's cruise===\nIn the aftermath of these French defeats at sea, and with the food supply in Valletta dwindling, the British sent another demand for capitulation. Vaubois again refused, with the reply ''\"Cette place est en trop bon \u00e9tat, et je suis moi-m\u00eame trop jaloux de bien servir mon pays et de conserver mon honneur, por \u00e9couter vos propositions.\"'' (\"This place is in too good a situation, and I am too conscious of the service of my country and my honour, to listen to your proposals\").<ref name=\"WJ3:20\"/> In reality, the situation was dire: during February, prices of basic foodstuffs stood at 16 francs for a fowl, 12 francs for a rabbit, 20 sous for an egg, 18 sous for a lettuce, 40 sous for a rat and six francs per pound for fish. For the civilian typhus patients, the only food available was horse-flesh soup.<ref name=\"WJ3:16\">James, Vol. 3, p. 16</ref>\n\nOn 23 April, Nelson departed Palermo in ''Foudroyant'', with both Sir William and Emma Hamilton on board as his guests. The party visited Syracuse and then travelled on to Valletta, where Berry took ''Foudroyant'' so close to the harbour that the ship came under fire from the French batteries. It was not hit, but Nelson was furious that Emma had been taken into danger and immediately ordered Berry to withdraw. His anger was exacerbated by Emma's refusal to retire from the quarterdeck during the brief exchange.<ref name=\"EB249\">Bradford, p. 249</ref> From there, ''Foudroyant'' anchored at Marsa Sirocco, where Nelson and Emma lived together openly and were hosted by Troubridge and Graham. Sir William Hamilton, a prominent antiquarian as well as a diplomat, spent his time exploring the island.<ref name=\"EB250\">Bradford, p. 250</ref> By early June, Nelson and his party had returned to Palermo, the beginning of a lengthy overland journey across Europe to Britain. Nelson also detached ''Foudroyant'' and ''Alexander'' from the blockade, again in defiance of Keith's explicit orders, to assist the Neapolitan royal family in their passage to [[Livorno]].<ref name=\"NM374\">Mostert, p. 374</ref> Enraged at Nelson's disobedience, Keith publicly remarked that \"Lady Hamilton has had command of the fleet long enough\".<ref name=\"EB251\">Bradford, p. 251</ref> In May, Troubridge returned to Britain and was replaced in command by Captain [[George Martin (Royal Navy officer)|George Martin]], while Graham was succeeded by Major-General [[Henry Pigot]].<ref name=\"WJ3:21\">James, Vol. 3, p. 21</ref>\n\n===Surrender===\nThe British blockade continued to prevent French efforts to resupply Valletta during the early summer of 1800, and by August the situation was desperate: no horses or pack animals, dogs, cats, fowls or rabbits still lived within the city, the cisterns had been emptied and even firewood was in short supply. So desperate was the need for wood that the frigate ''Boudeuse'', trapped by the blockade, was broken up for fuel by the beleaguered garrison. With defeat now inevitable, Vaubois gave orders that the frigates ''Diane'' and ''Justice'' were to attempt a breakout for Toulon, with minimal crews of approximately 115 men each.<ref name=\"WJ3:20\">James, Vol. 3, p. 20</ref> On 24 August, when the wind was favourable and the night dark enough to obscure their movements, the frigates put to sea. Almost immediately, lookouts on HMS ''Success'' sighted them and Captain Peard gave chase, followed by HMS ''Genereux'' and ''Northumberland''. ''Diane'' under Captain Solen was too slow and Peard soon overhauled the under-strength French ship, which surrendered after a brief exchange of shot. The frigate later became HMS ''Niobe''. ''Justice'', under Captain Jean Villeneuve, was faster, however, and outran its pursuers, eventually making Toulon, the only ship from Malta to do so during the siege.<ref name=\"RW143\">Woodman, p. 143</ref>\n\nOn 3 September, with his men dying of starvation and disease at the rate of more than 100 a day, Vaubois called a council of his officers at which they unanimously decided to surrender.<ref name=\"WLC422\">Clowes, p. 422</ref> The next day, envoys were sent to the British and in the afternoon General Pigot and Captain Martin signed the agreed terms with Vaubois and Villeneuve. The Maltese were excluded from negotiations entirely, although their commander, Alexander Ball, subsequently became the first [[List of Civil Commissioners of Malta|Civil Commissioner of Malta]].<ref name=\"ODNBall\"/> The terms of the surrender were absolute: the island, its dependencies, fortifications and military supplies were all turned over to British control. This included the ships of the line ''[[HMS Athenienne (1800)|Athenien]]'' and ''[[French ship D\u00e9go (1798)|D\u00e9go]]'' and the frigate ''[[French frigate Carthaginoise|Carthag\u00e9naise]]'' (these were all French ships previously captured from the Order), although only ''Athenien'' was of sufficient standard to be incorporated into the Royal Navy, becoming HMS ''Athenienne''. The other ships were broken up in their berths. The British also took two merchant ships and a variety of smaller warships.<ref name=\"WLC423\">Clowes, p. 423</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe capture of Malta returned control of the central Mediterranean to Britain and was an important step in the invasion and liberation of Egypt from French rule in 1801.<ref name=\"RG78\">Gardiner, p. 78</ref>\n\nAn essential condition of the [[Treaty of Amiens]] in the same year, which brought an end to the French Revolutionary War, was that the British leave Malta. The [[Napoleonic Wars]] with the French Empire began soon afterwards, in part due to the unwillingness of the United Kingdom to comply with this clause of the treaty. The Russian [[Alexander I of Russia|Tsar Alexander I]] had a long-standing claim to the island as titular head of the Knights of St. John, and demanded that it be turned over to Russian control before agreeing any alliance with Britain. Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger]] flatly refused, and the Russians backed down, agreeing to an anti-French alliance.<ref name=\"NM461\">Mostert, p. 461</ref> \n\nThe island remained in British hands until [[Independence of Malta|its independence]] in 1964.<ref name=\"RG70\">Gardiner, p. 70</ref>\n\n==Commemoration==\nThe French surrender is one of three sieges that is celebrated on [[Victory Day (Malta)|''il-Vitorja'']] (Victory Day), held annually on 8 September.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.visitmalta.com/en/event-details/2018-09/il-vitorja-victory-day--11110 |title=IL-VITORJA (VICTORY DAY) |website=Visit Malta |publisher=Malta Tourism Authority |access-date=2018-09-06 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book\n | last = Adkins\n | first = Roy & Lesley\n | authorlink =\n | year = 2006\n | chapter =\n | title = The War for All the Oceans\n | publisher = Abacus\n | location =\n | isbn = 0-349-11916-3\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Bradford\n | first = Ernle\n | authorlink = Ernle Bradford\n | year = 1999 |origyear=1977\n | chapter =\n | title = Nelson: The Essential Hero\n | publisher = Wordsworth Military Library\n | location =\n | isbn = 1-84022-202-6\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Clowes\n | first = William Laird\n | authorlink = William Laird Clowes\n | year = 1997 |origyear=1900\n | chapter =\n | title = The Royal Navy, A History from the Earliest Times to 1900, Volume IV\n | publisher = Chatham Publishing\n | location =\n | isbn = 1-86176-013-2\n}}\n* {{cite book \n | last = Cole \n | first = Juan \n | title = Napoleon\u2019s Egypt; Invading the Middle East \n | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8rzGxWUQiKkC&printsec=frontcover&hl=es#v=onepage&q&f=false \n | year = 2007 \n | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan \n | isbn = 9781403964311 }}\n* {{cite book\n | author = Gardiner, Robert, ed<!-- work around since {{cite book}} seems to have a bug with respect to editor/origyear combos\n | editor =Gardiner, Robert -->\n | authorlink =\n | year = 2001\n | origyear=1996\n | chapter =\n | title = Nelson Against Napoleon\n | publisher = Caxton Editions\n | location =\n | isbn = 1-86176-026-4\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Grocott\n | first = Terence\n | authorlink =\n | year = 2002 |origyear=1997\n | chapter =\n | title = Shipwrecks of the Revolutionary & Napoleonic Era\n | publisher = Caxton Editions\n | location =\n | isbn = 1-84067-164-5\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = James\n | first = William\n | authorlink = William James (naval historian)\n | year = 2002 |origyear=1827\n | chapter =\n | title = The Naval History of Great Britain, Volume 2, 1797\u20131799\n | publisher = Conway Maritime Press\n | location =\n | isbn = 0-85177-906-9\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = James\n | first = William\n | authorlink = William James (naval historian)\n | year = 2002 |origyear=1827\n | chapter =\n | title = The Naval History of Great Britain, Volume 3, 1800\u20131805\n | publisher = Conway Maritime Press\n | location =\n | isbn = 0-85177-907-7\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Mostert\n | first = Noel\n | authorlink =\n | year = 2007\n | chapter =\n | title = The Line upon a Wind: The Greatest War Fought at Sea Under Sail 1793\u20131815\n | publisher = Vintage Books\n | location =\n | isbn = 978-0-7126-0927-2\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Woodman\n | first = Richard\n | authorlink = Richard Woodman\n | year = 2001\n | chapter =\n | title = The Sea Warriors\n | publisher = Constable Publishers\n | location =\n | isbn = 1-84119-183-3\n}}\n\n{{good article}}\n\n{{French occupation of Malta}}\n{{Malta topics}}\n{{British colonial campaigns}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Malta, Siege of}}\n[[Category:Battles of the French Revolutionary Wars]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1798]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1799]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1800]]\n[[Category:1798 in Malta]]\n[[Category:1799 in Malta]]\n[[Category:1800 in Malta]]\n[[Category:Wars involving Malta]]\n[[Category:Sieges involving Great Britain]]\n[[Category:Mediterranean campaign of 1798]]\n[[Category:Sieges involving Portugal]]\n[[Category:18th-century rebellions]]\n[[Category:Sieges involving Malta]]\n[[Category:18th century in Valletta]]\n[[Category:French occupation of Malta]]\n[[Category:Rebellions in Malta]]\n[[Category:Insurgencies in Europe]]\n", "name_user": "Snagemit", "label": "safe", "comment": "Infobox changes", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Malta_(1798%E2%80%931800)"}
