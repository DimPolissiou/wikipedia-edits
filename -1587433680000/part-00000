In recent times CAMRA has obtained benefits for its members from some commercial organisations and increasingly some licensed premises offer members price reductions on real ale (and sometimes cider and perry).\n\n==Publications and Websites==\nCAMRA publishes the ''[[Good Beer Guide]]'', an annually compiled directory of the best 4,500 real ale outlets and listing of real ale brewers.\nCAMRA members receive a monthly newspaper called ''What's Brewing'' and a quarterly colour magazine called ''Beer''. In 2013 CAMRA launched public access to a national pub database, [http://www.whatpub.com WhatPub]. This database is maintained by local volunteers, covering all pubs in the UK and listing information such as opening times, location and beers available. It also maintains a [[CAMRA Pub Heritage Group|National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors]] to help bring greater recognition and protection to Britain's most historic pubs.\n\n==Festivals==\n[[File:GBBF 2.jpg|thumb|Great British Beer Festival 2004]]\nCAMRA supports and promotes beer and cider festivals around the country, which are organised by local CAMRA branches. Generally, each festival charges an entry fee which either covers entry only or also includes a commemorative glass showing the details of the festival. A festival programme is usually also provided, with a list and description of the drinks available.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.camra.org.uk/beerfestivals |title=List of upcoming CAMRA beer festivals |access-date=25 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729002251/http://www.camra.org.uk/beerfestivals |archive-date=29 July 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Members often get discounted or free entrance to CAMRA festivals.\n\nThe Campaign also organises the annual [[Great British Beer Festival]] in August. It is now held in the Great, National & West Halls at the [[Olympia, London|Olympia Exhibition Centre]], in [[Kensington]], London, having been held for a few years at [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earl's Court]] as well as regionally in the past at venues such as Brighton and Leeds. This is the UK's largest beer festival, with over 900 beers, ciders and perrys available over the week long event.\n\nFor many years, CAMRA also organised the National Winter Ales Festival. However, in 2017 this was re-branded as the Great British Beer Festival Winter. Unlike the Great British Beer Festival, the Winter event does not have a permanent venue and is rotated throughout the country every three years. Recent hosts have been Derby and Norwich, with the event currently held each February in Birmingham. In 2020 CAMRA also launched the Great Welsh Beer Festival, to be held in Cardiff in April.\n\n==Awards==\nCAMRA presents awards for beers and pubs, such as the [[National Pub of the Year]]. The competition begins in the preceding year with branches choosing their local pub of the year through either a ballot or a panel of judges. The branch winners are entered into 16 regional competitions which are then visited by several individuals who agree the best using a scoring system that looks at beer quality, aesthetic, and welcome. The four finalists are announced each year before a ceremony to crown the winner in the spring.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.morningadvertiser.co.uk/Article/2020/02/12/250-year-old-family-gem-wins-CAMRA-s-pub-of-the-year|title=250-year-old family gem wins CAMRA's pub of the year|last=morningadvertiser.co.uk|website=morningadvertiser.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-03}}</ref> There are also the [[Pub Design Awards]], which are held in association with [[English Heritage]] and the [[Victorian Society]].  These comprise several categories, including new build, refurbished and converted pubs.\n\nThe best known CAMRA award is the [[Champion Beer of Britain]],<ref>{{citation\n|url=http://www.camra.org.uk/cbob\n|publisher=Campaign for Real Ale\n|title=Champion Beer of Britain\n|accessdate=25 July 2013\n}}</ref> which is selected at the [[Great British Beer Festival]].

The failed special resolution related to a proposal for the Campaign to act as the voice and represent the interests of all pub-goers and beer, cider and perry drinkers.\n\n==Aims==\nCAMRA's stated aims are:\n# To secure the long-term future of real ale, real cider and real perry by increasing their quality, availability and popularity\n#To promote and protect pubs and clubs as social centres as part of the UK's cultural heritage\n#To increase recognition of the benefits of responsible, moderate social drinking\n#To play a leading role in the provision of information, education and training to all those with an interest in beer, cider and perry of any type\n#To ensure, where possible, that producers and retailers of beer, cider and perry act in the best interests of the customer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.camra.org.uk/press-releases/-/asset_publisher/CfaqMGfKvAEU/content/camra-members-vote-to-approve-change-following-largest-consultation-on-47-year-history|title=Archived copy|access-date=15 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615163235/http://www.camra.org.uk/press-releases/-/asset_publisher/CfaqMGfKvAEU/content/camra-members-vote-to-approve-change-following-largest-consultation-on-47-year-history|archive-date=15 June 2018|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nCAMRA's campaigns include promoting small brewing and pub businesses, reforming licensing laws, reducing tax on beer, and stopping continued consolidation among local British brewers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Campaigns&nbsp;\u2013 CAMRA|url=http://www.camra.org.uk/campaigns|accessdate=26 October 2011}}</ref> It also makes an effort to promote less common varieties of beer, including [[Stout beer|stout]], [[Porter (beer)|porter]], and [[Mild beer|mild]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Different Styles |url=http://www.camra.org.uk/beerstyles |accessdate=25 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729041918/http://www.camra.org.uk/beerstyles |archivedate=29 July 2013 }}</ref> as well as traditional [[cider]] and [[perry]].<ref>{{cite web|title=About Cider&nbsp;\u2013 CAMRA|url=http://www.camra.org.uk/aboutcider|accessdate=26 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122031136/http://www.camra.org.uk/aboutcider|archivedate=22 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nCAMRA's states that real ale can only be served without the use of additional carbonation.

In recent times CAMRA has obtained benefits for its members from some commercial organisations and increasingly some licensed premises offer members price reductions on real ale (and sometimes cider and perry).\n\n==Publications and Websites==\nCAMRA publishes the ''[[Good Beer Guide]]'', an annually compiled directory of the best 4,500 real ale outlets and listing of real ale brewers.\nCAMRA members receive a monthly newspaper called ''What's Brewing'' and a quarterly colour magazine called ''Beer''. In 2013 CAMRA launched public access to a national pub database, [http://www.whatpub.com WhatPub]. This database is maintained by local volunteers, covering all pubs in the UK and listing information such as opening times, location and beers available. It also maintains a [[CAMRA Pub Heritage Group|National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors]] to help bring greater recognition and protection to Britain's most historic pubs.\n\n==Festivals==\n[[File:GBBF 2.jpg|thumb|Great British Beer Festival 2004]]\nCAMRA supports and promotes beer and cider festivals around the country, which are organised by local CAMRA branches. Generally, each festival charges an entry fee which either covers entry only or also includes a commemorative glass showing the details of the festival. A festival programme is usually also provided, with a list and description of the drinks available.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.camra.org.uk/beerfestivals |title=List of upcoming CAMRA beer festivals |access-date=25 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729002251/http://www.camra.org.uk/beerfestivals |archive-date=29 July 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Members often get discounted or free entrance to CAMRA festivals.\n\nThe Campaign also organises the annual [[Great British Beer Festival]] in August. It is now held in the Great, National & West Halls at the [[Olympia, London|Olympia Exhibition Centre]], in [[Kensington]], London, having been held for a few years at [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earl's Court]] as well as regionally in the past at venues such as Brighton and Leeds. This is the UK's largest beer festival, with over 900 beers, ciders and perrys available over the week long event.\n\nFor many years, CAMRA also organised the National Winter Ales Festival. However, in 2017 this was re-branded as the Great British Beer Festival Winter. Unlike the Great British Beer Festival, the Winter event does not have a permanent venue and is rotated throughout the country every three years. Recent hosts have been Derby and Norwich, with the event currently held each February in Birmingham. In 2020 CAMRA also launched the Great Welsh Beer Festival, to be held in Cardiff in April.\n\n==Awards==\nCAMRA presents awards for beers and pubs, such as the [[National Pub of the Year]]. The competition begins in the preceding year with branches choosing their local pub of the year through either a ballot or a panel of judges. The branch winners are entered into 16 regional competitions which are then visited by several individuals who agree the best using a scoring system that looks at beer quality, aesthetic, and welcome. The four finalists are announced each year before a ceremony to crown the winner in the spring.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.morningadvertiser.co.uk/Article/2020/02/12/250-year-old-family-gem-wins-CAMRA-s-pub-of-the-year|title=250-year-old family gem wins CAMRA's pub of the year|last=morningadvertiser.co.uk|website=morningadvertiser.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-03}}</ref> There are also the [[Pub Design Awards]], which are held in association with [[English Heritage]] and the [[Victorian Society]].  These comprise several categories, including new build, refurbished and converted pubs.\n\nThe best known CAMRA award is the [[Champion Beer of Britain]],<ref>{{citation\n|url=http://www.camra.org.uk/cbob\n|publisher=Campaign for Real Ale\n|title=Champion Beer of Britain\n|accessdate=25 July 2013\n}}</ref> which is selected at the [[Great British Beer Festival]]. Other awards include the [[Champion Beer of Scotland]] and the [[Champion Beer of Wales]].\n\n==National Beer Scoring Scheme==\nCAMRA developed the National Beer Scoring Scheme<ref>{{citation\n|url=http://www.camra.org.uk/nbss\n|title=National Beer Scoring Scheme\n|publisher=Campaign for Real Ale\n|date=12 January 2006\n|first=Brett|last=Laniosh\n|accessdate=25 July 2013\n}}</ref> (NBSS) as an easy to use scheme for judging beer quality in pubs, to assist CAMRA branches in selecting pubs for the ''Good Beer Guide''. CAMRA members input their beer scores online via WhatPub or through the Good Beer Guide app.\n\n==Pub Heritage==\nThe CAMRA Pub Heritage Group identifies, records and helps to protect [[pub]] interiors of historic and/or architectural importance, and seeks to get them [[Listed building|listed]].<ref>{{citation\n|url=http://www.heritagepubs.org.uk\n|title=Heritage Pubs&nbsp;\u2013 An Overview\n|publisher=Campaign for Real Ale <!-- black link i.e. same page -->\n|accessdate=2009-05-05\n}}</ref>\n\nThe group maintains two inventories of Heritage pubs, the National Inventory (NI), which contains only those pubs that have been maintained in their original condition (or have been modified very little) for at least thirty years, but usually since at least [[World War II]]. The second, larger, inventory is the Regional Inventory (RI), which is broken down by [[Counties of the United Kingdom|county]] and contains both those pubs listed in the NI and other pubs that are not eligible for the NI, for reasons such as having been overly modified, but are still considered historically important, or have particular architectural value.\n\nThe NI contains 289 pubs {{as of|2009|6|lc=on}}.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.heritagepubs.org.uk/home/nationalinventory.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629082124/http://www.heritagepubs.org.uk/home/nationalinventory.asp\n|url-status=dead\n|archive-date=2009-06-29\n|title=Pub Heritage, the Campaign for Real Ale\n|publisher=www.heritagepubs.org.uk\n|accessdate=2009-07-17\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==LocAle==\nThe LocAle scheme was launched in 2007<ref name=\"WB-Aug-Loc\">'Check your beers urges LocAle creator', ''What's Brewing'', August 2010 issue</ref><ref name=\"WB-Sep-Loc\"/><ref name=\"LocAle1\">[http://www.camra.org.uk/locale CAMRA LocAle] (accessed 25 July 2013)</ref> to promote locally brewed beers.

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> In 1975, the university opened The [[Grey Art Gallery]] at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html|title=Home -

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> In 1975, the university opened The [[Grey Art Gallery]] at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html|title=Home -

Following the closure of the United hub, [[Continental Airlines]] (which at the time was a separate carrier and lacked a Midwest hub) responded by adding capacity to Cleveland, as did [[US Airways|USAir]], which was the dominant carrier at the airport from 1987 until the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite news |title=US Air Wants Mini-Hub in Cleveland|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0MpRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4G0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4135%2C6758109|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=February 23, 1987|accessdate=July 5, 2012}}</ref>  While USAir soon reduced its schedule from Cleveland, Continental substantially increased its hub capacity, becoming the airport's largest tenant and eventually accounting for upwards of 60 percent of passenger traffic. Continental and the airport both made substantial operational and capital investments in the airport's infrastructure.  In 1992, the airport completed a $50 million renovation of Concourse C, which housed all of Continental's flights.  The renovation included the installation of a continuous skylight, a Continental President's Club lounge, and a new Baggage Claim area.<ref>{{cite web|title=Continental Airlines Concourse C|url=http://www.rpmadison.com/id54_continental_airlines___concourse_c.htm|publisher=Robert P.

It was also the first airport to employ a two-level terminal design separating arrivals from departures.  The airport was named after its founder, former [[city manager]] [[William R. Hopkins]], on his 82nd birthday in 1951.\n\n===First closure of United hub and establishment of Continental hub===\n[[United Airlines]] established its eastern-most domestic hub in Cleveland after World War II, which it maintained until the mid-1980s, when it closed its Cleveland hub and moved capacity to a new hub at [[Washington Dulles International Airport|Washington\u2013Dulles]]. Following the closure of the United hub, [[Continental Airlines]] (which at the time was a separate carrier and lacked a Midwest hub) responded by adding capacity to Cleveland, as did [[US Airways|USAir]], which was the dominant carrier at the airport from 1987 until the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite news |title=US Air Wants Mini-Hub in Cleveland|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0MpRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4G0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4135%2C6758109|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=February 23, 1987|accessdate=July 5, 2012}}</ref>  While USAir soon reduced its schedule from Cleveland, Continental substantially increased its hub capacity, becoming the airport's largest tenant and eventually accounting for upwards of 60 percent of passenger traffic. Continental and the airport both made substantial operational and capital investments in the airport's infrastructure.  In 1992, the airport completed a $50 million renovation of Concourse C, which housed all of Continental's flights.  The renovation included the installation of a continuous skylight, a Continental President's Club lounge, and a new Baggage Claim area.<ref>{{cite web|title=Continental Airlines Concourse C|url=http://www.rpmadison.com/id54_continental_airlines___concourse_c.htm|publisher=Robert P.

During the boarding process for the flight in Cleveland, Mays shot her way onto the plane, shooting and injuring a USAir employee who tried to stop her in the process. Mays then commandeered the plane, took 7 hostages (including an 8-month-old baby), and demanded to be taken to [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. After a 6-hour stand-off, a SWAT team made up of Cleveland police and FBI agents stormed the plane.  Mays and an officer were shot before police were able to arrest Mays.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-01-05-mn-11484-story.html|title=SWAT Team Storms Jetliner in Cleveland : Woman Holding Four Hostages Is Wounded; One Officer Injured|date=January 5, 1985|website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>\n* On February 17, 1991, a [[Ryan International Airlines]] [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9-15]], a cargo flight bound for [[Indianapolis International Airport]] stalled and crashed after takeoff from CLE due to wing contamination.

Originally meant to be a temporary fix, the airport made the Ground Transportation Center a permanent fixture in May 2017. This angered many travelers, who complained on various social media platforms, as well as local media outlets, garnering negative publicity for the airport's plans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2017/02/travelers_are_unhappy_with_new.html|title=Travelers are unhappy with new Cleveland Hopkins International Airport shuttle stops|publisher=}}</ref> In March 2019, the pick ups and drop offs location for most of the shuttles (except for limo shuttles) have moved to the north end of the baggage claim level.\n\n===Parking===\nIn May 2013, the airport demolished its aging, 2,600-space Long Term Garage, replacing it with a 1,000 space surface lot for $24M.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2015/08/cleveland_hopkins_alters_parking_plans_to_keep_option_of_expanding_garage.html|title=Cleveland Hopkins alters parking plans to keep option of expanding garage (photos)|publisher=}}</ref>  This in turn created a parking shortage, and daily lot closings when parking lots would become full. The airport's Twitter account became a daily update of parking closures at the airport.  The airport converted the Short Term Garage to a so-called Smart Garage, and valet parking garage.  The airport eliminated its free half-hour courtesy parking perk, and began to charge $3 for a half-hour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/09/cleveland_hopkins_airport_open.html|title=Cleveland Hopkins airport opens new overflow parking lot with garage nearing capacity|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ohio World War II Army Airfields]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Air Force Historical Research Agency}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat}}\n* [http://www.clevelandairport.com/ Official site]\n* {{FAA-diagram|00084}}\n{{US-airport|CLE}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101007012338/http://opshots.net/ OPShots.net -CLE Spotters Site]\n* [http://www.clevelandairport.com/Doing-Business/Project-Information.aspx Master Plan]\n* [https://acukwik.com/Airport-Info/KCLE AC-U-KWIK information for KCLE]\n\n{{Cleveland}}\n{{Portal bar|Aviation}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Airports in Ohio]]\n[[Category:Airports established in 1925]]\n[[Category:Transportation buildings and structures in Cleveland]]\n[[Category:Airfields of the United States Army Air Forces Technical Service Command]]\n[[Category:Airfields of the United States Army Air Forces in Ohio]]\n[[Category:Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks]]\n[[Category:1925 establishments in Ohio]]\n", "name_user": "146.115.123.148", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Hopkins_International_Airport"}

Located south of [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]], it is bordered by the [[Fraser River]] to the north, the United States ([[Point Roberts, Washington]]) to the south and the city of [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]] to the east. Delta is composed of three distinct communities: [[Ladner, British Columbia|Ladner]], [[Tsawwassen, British Columbia|Tsawwassen]], and [[North Delta, British Columbia|North Delta]].\n\n==History==\nPrior to European settlement, Delta's flatlands and coastal shores were inhabited by the [[Tsawwassen First Nation|Tsawwassen]] [[indigenous peoples]], of the [[Coast Salish peoples|Coast Salish]] [[First Nations]]. The land was first sighted by Europeans in 1791, when Spanish explorer Lieutenant [[Francisco de Eliza]] mistook the area for an island and named it \"Isla de Cepeda\". The first European settler in Delta was James Kennedy who pre-empted 135 acres in what later became Annieville in February 1860. Thomas and [[William Henry Ladner|William Ladner]], began farming the area named after them in 1868. Farming and fishing helped the community grow quickly over the next few decades. In 1879, the area was incorporated as a municipality, named \"the Corporation of Delta\", and the village of Ladner was made as its administrative centre.\n\nDue to its geography, Delta was a relatively isolated community. The completion of the [[George Massey Tunnel]] in 1959 linking Ladner to [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]] and [[Vancouver]] along with the opening, in 1960, of the [[Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal]] and the [[British Columbia Highway 99|Highway 99]] being rerouted from the King George Highway in Surrey in 1962 to a new route through Delta, ended Delta's isolation and resulted in a massive 400% population growth over the next 20 years. The 1986 completion of the [[Alex Fraser Bridge]] connecting [[North Delta, British Columbia|North Delta]] to [[New Westminster]] and Vancouver also helped Delta's growth.\n\nOn 22 September 2017, at the request of Delta's council, the [[British Columbia#Government and politics|Government of British Columbia]] changed the name and classification of the Corporation of Delta to the City of Delta.<ref name=citystatus>{{cite web |publisher =Province of British Columbia |url=http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/oic/oic_cur/0362_2017 |title=Order of the Lieutenant Governor in Council |date=September 22, 2017 |accessdate=April 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Neighbourhoods==\nDelta comprises three distinct, geographically separate communities:\n*[[North Delta, British Columbia|North Delta]] (pop: 51,623) is home to over half of Delta's population. It is a largely suburban area in north-east Delta bordered by the [[Burns Bog]] and [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]].\n*[[Ladner, British Columbia|Ladner]] (pop: 21,112) is a 19th-century fishing village in north-west Delta that has expanded into a suburb. Fishing and farming are important industries. Ladner Trunk Road is its main street.\n*[[Tsawwassen, British Columbia|Tsawwassen]] (pop: 20,933) is a suburban community in south-west Delta that calls itself the sunniest place in [[Metro Vancouver]]. Luxury waterfront homes line Tsawwassen's coast. Tsawwassen is also home to the busy Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal which links the mainland to [[Vancouver Island]] and the [[Gulf Islands]]. Tsawwassen, together with Ladner are also known as South Delta.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Historical populations\n|type        = Canada\n|align       = right\n|width       = \n|state       = \n|shading     = \n|percentages = \n|footnote    = <ref>{{cite web|title=Census of Canada Historical Census Populations Municipalities from 1921 to 2011|url=https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/statistics/people-population-community/census}}</ref>\n|1921|2839\n|1931|3709\n|1941|4287\n|1951|6701\n|1956|8752\n|1961|14597\n|1966|20664\n|1971|45860\n|1976|64492\n|1981|74692\n|1986|79610\n|1991|88978\n|[[Canada 1996 Census|1996]]|95411\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]|96950\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]|96723\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]|99863\n|[[Canada 2016 Census|2016]]|102238\n}}\n\nAccording to the [[2011 canadian census|2011 Canadian Census]],<ref>2011 NHS/Census Profile of Delta: http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=5915011&Data=Count&SearchText=delta&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&A1=All&B1=All&Custom=&TABID=1</ref> the population of Delta is 99,863, a 3.3% increase from 2006.

There are 35,781 private dwellings with an occupancy rate of 97.1%. According to the 2011 National Household Survey, the median value of a dwelling in Delta is $562,181 which is significantly higher than the national average at $280,552. The median household income (after-taxes) in Delta is $71,590, quite higher than the national average at $54,089.\n===Ethnicity===\nAs of 2016, Delta's population is 102,238. About 36% of Delta's population are visible minorities, of which there are approximately 20,500 [[South Asian Canadian|South Asians]] and 7,700 [[Chinese Canadian|Chinese]] Canadians. There are also about 2,200 [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] peoples, some from Tsawwassen First Nation, who still hold a fraction of their former traditional territories on the [[Tsawwassen First Nation]] at the mouth of the Fraser River, which are shared with the [[Hwlitsum First Nation]] from the [[Gulf Islands]].

It is bordered by water on three sides: The [[Fraser River]] to the north, the [[Strait of Georgia|Georgia Strait]] to the west and [[Boundary Bay]] to the south. At {{convert|364|km2}}, Delta is the largest municipality in the GVRD; the second largest is its neighbour to the east, [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]], at {{convert|317.4|km2}}.\n\n[[File:Trachycarpus fortunei 56 st tsawwassen bc.jpg|thumb|250px|Trachycarpus Fortunei [[Palm Tree]]s line some streets in [[Tsawwassen, British Columbia|Tsawwassen]]]]\n\nDelta's flat, fertile land has made it one of the most important agricultural areas in [[Greater Vancouver]]. The [[Agricultural Land Reserve]] regulations preserve most of this land for agricultural use, preventing its conversion to suburban housing. [[North Delta, British Columbia|North Delta]] is also home to the [[Burns Bog]], 40 square kilometres (10,000 acres) of natural [[wetland]]s that are important for wildlife.\n\nDelta includes [[Annacis Island]], an industrial island reached via the [[Alex Fraser Bridge]], which connects Delta with [[Richmond, BC|Richmond]] and [[New Westminster]].  Delta also includes a peninsula on the east side of the Fraser River at Delta's northern city limits, which is only accessible via [[Surrey, BC|Surrey]].\n\n===Climate===\nDelta is known for its relatively dry and sunny climate compared with other locations in [[Metro Vancouver Regional District|Metro Vancouver]].  For example, it receives nearly 40% less precipitation than [[downtown Vancouver]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?searchType=stnName&txtStationName=vancouver+harbour&searchMethod=contains&txtCentralLatMin=0&txtCentralLatSec=0&txtCentralLongMin=0&txtCentralLongSec=0&stnID=888&dispBack=1|title=Canadian Climate Normals 1971\u20132000 Station Data|publisher=[[Environment and Climate Change Canada|Environment Canada]]|access-date=March 30, 2020}}</ref> and less than half of that of [[North Vancouver (district municipality)|North Vancouver]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?stnID=820&lang=e&dCode=0&StationName=VANCOUVER&SearchType=Contains&province=ALL&provBut=&month1=0&month2=12 |title=Station Results &#124;

The current mayor is George Harvie. Unlike most communities in Canada, but like [[Vancouver]] and [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]], Delta has a system of locally based [[Slate (elections)|election slates]] such as TriDelta, IDEA, One Delta, Delta Residents Association, Delta Connect, DIVA, Independents Working For You, and Achieving For Delta.\n\nIn the [[House of Commons of Canada]], Delta is part of the [[Delta (electoral district)|Delta electoral district]]. As of the 2015 Federal general election, Delta's seat is held by [[Carla Qualtrough]] of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]]. In the 2017 Provincial general election, the North Delta seat went to [[Ravi Kahlon]] of the [[British Columbia New Democratic Party]] while the South Delta seat went to [[Ian Paton (politician)|Ian Paton]] of the [[British Columbia Liberal Party]]. \n\nDelta, unlike most Lower Mainland municipalities, has its own [[Delta Police Department|police department]].\n\nFormer Delta mayor [[Lois Jackson]] served from 1999 to 2018 and since 1973 has had a seat on Delta Council. Jackson was elected to council again in 2018.\n\n==Power==\nIn Delta is the Arnott Substation (ARN), the mainland terminal of the [[HVDC Vancouver Island]] circuit.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Alex Fraser Bridge 02.jpg|alt=|thumb|250x250px|The [[Alex Fraser Bridge]] links Delta to [[New Westminster]] and Richmond.]]\n\n*Public transportation in Delta is provided by the [[TransLink (British Columbia)|South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority]] bus system. There is no rapid transit system in Delta, though the [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] system in [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]] comes within three kilometres of the city's borders.\n*Delta is a major transportation hub for the Lower Mainland. Most vehicles leaving Vancouver for the United States pass through Delta's borders. Many vehicles destined for Vancouver Island use the Tsawwassen ferry terminal in Delta.\n*[[British Columbia Highway 99|Highway 99]] links [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]] to Delta via the [[George Massey Tunnel]], built in 1959. [[North Delta, British Columbia|North Delta]] is linked to [[New Westminster]] and Richmond by [[British Columbia Highway 91|Highway 91]] and the massive [[Alex Fraser Bridge]] (opened in 1986). Delta is linked to Surrey, [[Langley, British Columbia (district municipality)|Langley]], and all points eastward by [[British Columbia Highway 10|Highway 10]]. Traffic congestion during rush hour is quite common, although improvements area being made to Highway 91 interchanges at 72 Ave to remove a traffic light as well the ramps from Nordel Way. \n*[[British Columbia Highway 17|Highway 17]] in Delta provides a connection to the Tsawwassen [[BC Ferries|B.C. Ferry]] terminal, which provides car ferry connections to [[Vancouver Island]] and the [[Gulf Islands]]. In December 2013, north of the current junction with Deltaport Way, Highway 17 will be rerouted upon completion of the \"South Fraser Perimeter Road\", and will primarily run parallel to River Road through Tilbury and North Delta to all points east. The remaining stretch of Highway 17 north of that point will be renamed [[British Columbia Highway 17A|Highway 17A]].\n*River Road is also another connector through the municipality. River Road starts in Surrey and heads westbound through North Delta, under the Alex Fraser Bridge, north of Burns Bog, and then terminates at 62B Street, which then turns into Highway 17A.\n*Like River Road, the western communities of \"South Delta\" (Ladner and Tsawwassen) are linked to North Delta and communities to the east by Ladner Trunk Road; east of its crossover of Highway 91, the road becomes Highway 10.\n*[[Tsawwassen, British Columbia|56th Street]] is another major artery in the community, bisecting the Tsawwassen region; it is the only road leading into the community of [[Point Roberts, Washington|Point Roberts]], south of the Canada\u2013US border.\n*Delta is also home to [[Boundary Bay Airport]], [[List of the busiest airports in Canada|Canada's seventh busiest airport by aircraft movements]]. Boundary Bay Airport is primarily used for private aircraft, commercial charters, and flying lessons.\n\n===Major highways===\n*{{jct|state=BC|BC|10}}\n*{{jct|state=BC|BC|17}}\n*{{jct|state=BC|BC|17A}}\n*{{jct|state=BC|BC|91}}\n*{{jct|state=BC|BC|99}}\n\n== Health ==\nDelta is the westernmost community served by [[Fraser Health|Fraser Health Authority]] which operates [[Delta Hospital]] in Ladner and also funds home and community care. The Delta Hospice Society operates a facility near to the hospital.\n\n== Education ==\n[[Delta Public Schools]] operates Anglophone public schools in the city.\n\nThe ''[[Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique]]'' operates one Francophone primary school in that city: ''\u00e9cole du Bois-joli''.<ref>\"[http://www.csf.bc.ca/ecoles/en-colombie-britannique/carte-des-ecoles/ Carte des \u00e9coles].\" ''[[Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique]]''. Retrieved on 22 January 2015.</ref>\n\n==Delta sports==\nDelta has many minor sports teams in ice hockey, soccer, football, field hockey, baseball, softball, field lacrosse and box lacrosse. Over 160 young people play [[ringette]] in Delta. The Delta Ringette Association has 13 teams in 2005.\nNotable professional sports players from Delta are [[Jeff Francis]] (MLB), [[James Paxton (baseball)|James Paxton]] (MLB), [[Justin Morneau]] (MLB), [[Brent Seabrook]] (NHL), [[Troy Brouwer]] (NHL) and [[Mitch Berger]] (NFL).\n[[File:TourdeDeltaAD.jpg|thumb|right|[[White Spot / Delta Road Race (men's race)|Tour de Delta]] wall cover on electrical box outside of Delta, British Columbia municipal hall]] Delta's unique and varying terrain provides a challenging test for many of the world's best cyclists in the Tour de Delta (one day races, for [[White Spot / Delta Road Race (men's race)|men]] since 2001, and for [[White Spot / Delta Road Race (women's race)|women]] since 2011). Since its first event in 2001, the Tour de Delta has grown to be Canada's largest cycling event, held annually in July as part of BC Superweek.\nThe Delta Triathlon is also a very popular event, selling out each year in April. The event takes place in Ladner from the Ladner Leisure Centre.

Located south of [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]], it is bordered by the [[Fraser River]] to the north, the United States ([[Point Roberts, Washington]]) to the south and the city of [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]] to the east. Delta is composed of three distinct communities: [[Ladner, British Columbia|Ladner]], [[Tsawwassen, British Columbia|Tsawwassen]], and [[North Delta, British Columbia|North Delta]].\n\n==History==\nPrior to European settlement, Delta's flatlands and coastal shores were inhabited by the [[Tsawwassen First Nation|Tsawwassen]] [[indigenous peoples]], of the [[Coast Salish peoples|Coast Salish]] [[First Nations]]. The land was first sighted by Europeans in 1791, when Spanish explorer Lieutenant [[Francisco de Eliza]] mistook the area for an island and named it \"Isla de Cepeda\". The first European settler in Delta was James Kennedy who pre-empted 135 acres in what later became Annieville in February 1860. Thomas and [[William Henry Ladner|William Ladner]], began farming the area named after them in 1868. Farming and fishing helped the community grow quickly over the next few decades. In 1879, the area was incorporated as a municipality, named \"the Corporation of Delta\", and the village of Ladner was made as its administrative centre.\n\nDue to its geography, Delta was a relatively isolated community. The completion of the [[George Massey Tunnel]] in 1959 linking Ladner to [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]] and [[Vancouver]] along with the opening, in 1960, of the [[Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal]] and the [[British Columbia Highway 99|Highway 99]] being rerouted from the King George Highway in Surrey in 1962 to a new route through Delta, ended Delta's isolation and resulted in a massive 400% population growth over the next 20 years. The 1986 completion of the [[Alex Fraser Bridge]] connecting [[North Delta, British Columbia|North Delta]] to [[New Westminster]] and Vancouver also helped Delta's growth.\n\nOn September 22, 2017, at the request of Delta's council, the [[British Columbia#Government and politics|Government of British Columbia]] changed the name and classification of the Corporation of Delta to the City of Delta.<ref name=citystatus>{{cite web |publisher =Province of British Columbia |url=http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/oic/oic_cur/0362_2017 |title=Order of the Lieutenant Governor in Council |date=September 22, 2017 |accessdate=April 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Neighbourhoods==\nDelta comprises three distinct, geographically separate communities:\n*[[North Delta, British Columbia|North Delta]] (pop: 51,623) is home to over half of Delta's population. It is a largely suburban area in north-east Delta bordered by the [[Burns Bog]] and [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]].\n*[[Ladner, British Columbia|Ladner]] (pop: 21,112) is a 19th-century fishing village in north-west Delta that has expanded into a suburb. Fishing and farming are important industries. Ladner Trunk Road is its main street.\n*[[Tsawwassen, British Columbia|Tsawwassen]] (pop: 20,933) is a suburban community in south-west Delta that calls itself the sunniest place in [[Metro Vancouver]]. Luxury waterfront homes line Tsawwassen's coast. Tsawwassen is also home to the busy Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal which links the mainland to [[Vancouver Island]] and the [[Gulf Islands]]. Tsawwassen, together with Ladner are also known as South Delta.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Historical populations\n|type        = Canada\n|align       = right\n|width       = \n|state       = \n|shading     = \n|percentages = \n|footnote    = <ref>{{cite web|title=Census of Canada Historical Census Populations Municipalities from 1921 to 2011|url=https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/statistics/people-population-community/census}}</ref>\n|1921|2839\n|1931|3709\n|1941|4287\n|1951|6701\n|1956|8752\n|1961|14597\n|1966|20664\n|1971|45860\n|1976|64492\n|1981|74692\n|1986|79610\n|1991|88978\n|[[Canada 1996 Census|1996]]|95411\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]|96950\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]|96723\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]|99863\n|[[Canada 2016 Census|2016]]|102238\n}}\n\nAccording to the [[2011 canadian census|2011 Canadian Census]],<ref>2011 NHS/Census Profile of Delta: http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=5915011&Data=Count&SearchText=delta&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&A1=All&B1=All&Custom=&TABID=1</ref> the population of Delta is 99,863, a 3.3% increase from 2006. The population density is 554.4 people per square km. The median age is 42.8 years old, which is slightly higher than the national median age at 40.6 years old. There are 35,781 private dwellings with an occupancy rate of 97.1%. According to the 2011 National Household Survey, the median value of a dwelling in Delta is $562,181 which is significantly higher than the national average at $280,552. The median household income (after-taxes) in Delta is $71,590, quite higher than the national average at $54,089.\n===Ethnicity===\nAs of 2016, Delta's population is 102,238. About 36% of Delta's population are visible minorities, of which there are approximately 20,500 [[South Asian Canadian|South Asians]] and 7,700 [[Chinese Canadian|Chinese]] Canadians. There are also about 2,200 [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] peoples, some from Tsawwassen First Nation, who still hold a fraction of their former traditional territories on the [[Tsawwassen First Nation]] at the mouth of the Fraser River, which are shared with the [[Hwlitsum First Nation]] from the [[Gulf Islands]]. Forming over 20% of the population, Delta hosts the fourth largest South Asian population in British Columbia after neighbouring Vancouver, Surrey and Abbotsford.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | Racial Demographics of Delta<ref>[http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/prof/92-591/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=5915011&Geo2=PR&Code2=59&Data=Count&SearchText=Delta&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom=], Community Profiles from the 2006 Census, Statistics Canada - Census Subdivision</ref><ref name=\"delta-2016\">https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/search-recherche/results-resultats.cfm?Lang=E&TABID=1&G=1&Geo1=&Code1=&Geo2=&Code2=&SearchText=delta&SearchType=Begins&wb-srch-place=search Census Profile, 2016 Census\nDelta, District municipality [Census subdivision].

The current mayor is George Harvie. Unlike most communities in Canada, but like [[Vancouver]] and [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]], Delta has a system of locally based [[Slate (elections)|election slates]] such as TriDelta, IDEA, One Delta, Delta Residents Association, Delta Connect, DIVA, Independents Working For You, and Achieving For Delta.\n\nIn the [[House of Commons of Canada]], Delta is part of the [[Delta (electoral district)|Delta electoral district]]. As of the 2015 Federal general election, Delta's seat is held by [[Carla Qualtrough]] of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]]. In the 2017 Provincial general election, the North Delta seat went to [[Ravi Kahlon]] of the [[British Columbia New Democratic Party]] while the South Delta seat went to [[Ian Paton (politician)|Ian Paton]] of the [[British Columbia Liberal Party]]. \n\nDelta, unlike most Lower Mainland municipalities, has its own [[Delta Police Department|police department]].\n\nFormer Delta mayor [[Lois Jackson]] served from 1999 to 2018 and since 1973 has had a seat on Delta Council. Jackson was elected to council again in 2018.\n\n==Power==\nIn Delta is the Arnott Substation (ARN), the mainland terminal of the [[HVDC Vancouver Island]] circuit.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Alex Fraser Bridge 02.jpg|alt=|thumb|250x250px|The [[Alex Fraser Bridge]] links Delta to [[New Westminster]] and Richmond.]]\n\n*Public transportation in Delta is provided by the [[TransLink (British Columbia)|South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority]] bus system. There is no rapid transit system in Delta, though the [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] system in [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]] comes within three kilometres of the city's borders.\n*Delta is a major transportation hub for the Lower Mainland. Most vehicles leaving Vancouver for the United States pass through Delta's borders. Many vehicles destined for Vancouver Island use the Tsawwassen ferry terminal in Delta.\n*[[British Columbia Highway 99|Highway 99]] links [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]] to Delta via the [[George Massey Tunnel]], built in 1959. [[North Delta, British Columbia|North Delta]] is linked to [[New Westminster]] and Richmond by [[British Columbia Highway 91|Highway 91]] and the massive [[Alex Fraser Bridge]] (opened in 1986). Delta is linked to Surrey, [[Langley, British Columbia (district municipality)|Langley]], and all points eastward by [[British Columbia Highway 10|Highway 10]]. Traffic congestion during rush hour is quite common, although improvements area being made to Highway 91 interchanges at 72 Ave to remove a traffic light as well the ramps from Nordel Way. \n*[[British Columbia Highway 17|Highway 17]] in Delta provides a connection to the Tsawwassen [[BC Ferries|B.C. Ferry]] terminal, which provides car ferry connections to [[Vancouver Island]] and the [[Gulf Islands]]. In December 2013, north of the current junction with Deltaport Way, Highway 17 will be rerouted upon completion of the \"South Fraser Perimeter Road\", and will primarily run parallel to River Road through Tilbury and North Delta to all points east. The remaining stretch of Highway 17 north of that point will be renamed [[British Columbia Highway 17A|Highway 17A]].\n*River Road is also another connector through the municipality. River Road starts in Surrey and heads westbound through North Delta, under the Alex Fraser Bridge, north of Burns Bog, and then terminates at 62B Street, which then turns into Highway 17A.\n*Like River Road, the western communities of \"South Delta\" (Ladner and Tsawwassen) are linked to North Delta and communities to the east by Ladner Trunk Road; east of its crossover of Highway 91, the road becomes Highway 10.\n*[[Tsawwassen, British Columbia|56th Street]] is another major artery in the community, bisecting the Tsawwassen region; it is the only road leading into the community of [[Point Roberts, Washington|Point Roberts]], south of the Canada\u2013US border.\n*Delta is also home to [[Boundary Bay Airport]], [[List of the busiest airports in Canada|Canada's seventh busiest airport by aircraft movements]]. Boundary Bay Airport is primarily used for private aircraft, commercial charters, and flying lessons.\n\n===Major highways===\n*{{jct|state=BC|BC|10}}\n*{{jct|state=BC|BC|17}}\n*{{jct|state=BC|BC|17A}}\n*{{jct|state=BC|BC|91}}\n*{{jct|state=BC|BC|99}}\n\n== Health ==\nDelta is the westernmost community served by [[Fraser Health|Fraser Health Authority]] which operates [[Delta Hospital]] in Ladner and also funds home and community care. The Delta Hospice Society operates a facility near to the hospital.\n\n== Education ==\n[[Delta Public Schools]] operates Anglophone public schools in the city.\n\nThe ''[[Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique]]'' operates one Francophone primary school in that city: ''\u00e9cole du Bois-joli''.<ref>\"[http://www.csf.bc.ca/ecoles/en-colombie-britannique/carte-des-ecoles/ Carte des \u00e9coles].\" ''[[Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique]]''. Retrieved on 22 January 2015.</ref>\n\n==Delta sports==\nDelta has many minor sports teams in ice hockey, soccer, football, field hockey, baseball, softball, field lacrosse and box lacrosse. Over 160 young people play [[ringette]] in Delta. The Delta Ringette Association has 13 teams in 2005.\nNotable professional sports players from Delta are [[Jeff Francis]] (MLB), [[James Paxton (baseball)|James Paxton]] (MLB), [[Justin Morneau]] (MLB), [[Brent Seabrook]] (NHL), [[Troy Brouwer]] (NHL) and [[Mitch Berger]] (NFL).\n[[File:TourdeDeltaAD.jpg|thumb|right|[[White Spot / Delta Road Race (men's race)|Tour de Delta]] wall cover on electrical box outside of Delta, British Columbia municipal hall]] Delta's unique and varying terrain provides a challenging test for many of the world's best cyclists in the Tour de Delta (one day races, for [[White Spot / Delta Road Race (men's race)|men]] since 2001, and for [[White Spot / Delta Road Race (women's race)|women]] since 2011). Since its first event in 2001, the Tour de Delta has grown to be Canada's largest cycling event, held annually in July as part of BC Superweek.\nThe Delta Triathlon is also a very popular event, selling out each year in April. The event takes place in Ladner from the Ladner Leisure Centre.
