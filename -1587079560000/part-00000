In October of 2015, the band announced that their fifth release would take the form of a subscription service using [[Bandcamp]] entitled ''[[Pacific Myth]]''.\n\nThe band started the production process of their upcoming album in January 2018, but after vocalist Rody Walker experienced some issues with his voice during the Fortress 10th Anniversary Tour, in June 2018, the band released a statement revealing they were postponing the new record.\n\n==History==\n===Early years (2001\u20132003)===\n[[File:ProtestTheHero2004-2.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Walker in Jan. 2004]]\nThe band started as Happy Go Lucky in 1999 and, shortly after, they recorded a 2-track demo (containing the songs \"The 5th Commandment\" and \"Just Defy\"). In 2002 they changed their name to Protest the Hero and released their first EP, ''Search for the Truth'' 7\" vinyl, which included only two songs. They were included in the compilation ''(Coles) Notes from the Underground'' that same year. Luke Hoskin stated on his [[Formspring.me|Formspring]] page that ''Search for the Truth'' was recorded when they were 13 years old.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.formspring.me/LukeHoskin/q/424336942 |title=FormSpring blog page |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120801082106/http://www.formspring.me/LukeHoskin/q/424336942 |archivedate=2012-08-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The day that the band members finished their senior finals, they went on a three-week \"Rock the Vote\" tour from Toronto to [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] to garner recognition and raise awareness for the upcoming Canadian election.<ref name=\"The Sheridan Sun Online\">[http://sheridansunonline.sheridanc.on.ca/feb_26_2009/entertainment_protest_the_hero.html]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref>\n\nA music video for their song \"These Colours Don't Run\", from the EP ''[[A Calculated Use of Sound]]'', was released in 2003. The video begins with the band discussing the meaning of the song and features the band playing the song live at numerous locations in Toronto, with the album music dubbed over the actual live recording. At each location, the band would hand out lyrics to passers-by and encourage them to listen or sing along.\n\n===''Kezia'' (2004\u20132006)===\n[[File:ProtestTheHero2004-1.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Millar in Jan. 2004]]\nIn 2004 the band recorded their debut album for release the following year.  ''[[Kezia (album)|Kezia]]'' is a concept album, described by the band members as a \"situationist requiem\". The album achieved universal acclaim with many reviewers praising the album for its technicality and Walker's vocal range.\n\n===''Fortress'' (2007\u20132009)===\nAfter extensive touring the band returned to the studio in 2007 to record their sophomore effort. The resulting album featured 10 tracks that showcased the band heading in a more technical metal style than ''Kezia''.

He ascended the thrones in 1621 and reigned in Portugal until 1640. Philip is remembered for his patronage of the arts, including such artists as [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] and his rule over Spain during the [[Thirty Years' War]].\n\nBy the time of his death in 1665, the [[Spanish Empire]] had reached approximately 12.2 million square kilometers (4.7 million square miles) in the area but in other respects was in decline, a process to which Philip contributed with his inability to achieve successful domestic and military reform.\n\n==Personal life==\nPhilip IV was born in [[Royal Palace of Valladolid]], and was the eldest son of [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] and his wife, [[Margaret of Austria (1584\u20131611)|Margaret of Austria]]. In 1615, at the age of 10, Philip was married to 13-year-old [[Elisabeth of France (1602\u20131644)|Elisabeth of France]], although the relationship does not appear to have been close; some have even suggested that [[Gaspar de Guzm\u00e1n, Count-Duke of Olivares|Olivares]], his key minister, later deliberately tried to keep the two apart to maintain his influence, encouraging Philip to take mistresses instead.<ref name=Stevenson12>Stevenson, p. 12.</ref> Philip had seven children by Elisabeth, with only one being a son, [[Balthasar Charles, Prince of Asturias|Balthasar Charles]], who died at the age of sixteen in 1646. The death of his son deeply shocked the king, who appears to have been a good father by the standards of the day. Elisabeth was able to conspire with other Spanish nobles to remove Olivares from the court in 1643, and for a brief period she held considerable influence over Philip; by the time of her death, however, she was out of favour, following manoeuvering by Olivares' successor, [[Luis de Haro]].<ref name=Stevenson12/>\n\nPhilip remarried in 1649, following the deaths of both Elisabeth and his only legitimate heir. His choice of his second wife, [[Mariana of Austria|Maria Anna]], also known as Mariana, Philip's niece and the daughter of the [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Ferdinand]], was guided by politics and Philip's desire to strengthen the relationship with Habsburg Austria.<ref>Wedgwood, p. 495.</ref> They were married on 7 October 1649. Maria Anna bore him five children, but only two survived to adulthood, a daughter [[Margaret Theresa of Spain|Margarita Teresa]], born in 1651, and the future [[Charles II of Spain]] in 1661 \u2013 but the latter was sickly and considered in frequent danger of dying, making the line of inheritance potentially uncertain.<ref name=Kamen217>Kamen, p. 217.</ref>\n\nPerceptions of Philip's personality have altered considerably over time. Victorian authors were inclined to portray him as a weak individual, delegating excessively to his ministers, and ruling over a debauched [[Baroque]] court.<ref name=Aercke140>Aercke, p. 140.</ref> Victorian historians even attributed the early death of Baltasar to [[Sexually transmitted disease|debauchery]], encouraged by the gentlemen entrusted by the king with his education.

Philip IV came to power as the influence of the Sandovals was being undermined by a new noble coalition, led by Don [[Baltasar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]]. De Z\u00fa\u00f1iga regarded it as essential that the Sandovals be unable to gain influence over the future king; de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga first began to develop his influence over Prince Philip,<ref>Munck, p. 52.</ref> and then introduced his nephew, [[Gaspar de Guzm\u00e1n y Pimentel, Count-Duke of Olivares|Olivares]], to the prince, ten years old at the time.<ref name=Parker232>Parker, ''Europe in Crisis'', p. 232.</ref> At first, Philip did not particularly take to Olivares.<ref name=ElliotRev194>Elliot, ''The Revolt of the Catalans'', p. 194.</ref> Over at least a year, however, the relationship became very close,<ref>Stradling, p. 8.</ref> with Philip's tendency towards underconfidence and diffidence counteracted by Olivares' drive and determination.<ref name=ElliotRev194/> Olivares rapidly became Philip's most trusted advisor, and when Philip ascended the throne in 1621, at the age of sixteen, he showed his confidence in Olivares by ordering that all papers requiring the royal signature should first be sent to the count-duke. Philip retained Olivares as his confidant and chief minister for the next twenty years.\n\n[[File:Retrato de Felipe IV, by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Painting of a youthful Philip IV in 1623 by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], displaying the prominent \"[[Habsburg lip]]\"]]\n\nEarly in his reign, Philip would be woken by Olivares in the morning to discuss the day's affairs<ref name=Parker232/> and would meet with him twice more during the day, although later this routine declined until the king would hold only one short meeting on policy with Olivares each day.<ref name=ElliotRev194/> Philip intervened far more in policies during 1641\u201342, however, and it has been suggested that Philip paid more attention to policymaking than has traditionally been depicted; some recent histories go so far as to describe him as 'conscientious' in policymaking,<ref name=\"Elliot47\"/> although he is still criticised for his failure to make timely decisions.<ref>Elliot, ''The Revolt of the Catalans'', p. 526.</ref> Philip himself argued that it was hardly appropriate for the king himself go house to house amongst his ministers to see if his instructions were being carried out.<ref>Elliot, ''The Statecraft of Olivares'', p. 121.</ref> The close relationship between Philip and Olivares was demonstrated by their portraits' being placed side by side at the [[Palacio del Buen Retiro|Buen Retiro palace]] \u2014 an act unheard-of in Europe at the time.<ref>Elliot, ''Richelieu and Olivares'', p. 32.</ref> Philip's relationship with Olivares, however, was not a simplistic one.

There was a febrile atmosphere in Spain in the early 17th century, with numerous ''arbitrista'' offering various advice on how to solve Spain's various ills; this advice could, and would, be given in person by those of the lower classes to the king on suitable occasions, provided it was presented to strengthen the crown.<ref>Corteguera, p. 134.</ref> Those debates extended to the nature of the monarchy. It has been suggested that the writers of the period who best capture Philip's view of royal authority were Justus Lipsius and Giovanni Botero, who promoted religiously inspired, stoic self-sacrifice and a view of Habsburg family-led hegemony respectively.<ref>Ringrose, p. 320.</ref> While at one level conservative \u2013 harking back in foreign policy to the period of [[King Philip II of Spain|Phillip II]], invoking traditional values at home \u2013 Philip's policies were also radical, rejecting the policy towards the rebellious Dutch that had held since 1609, entering into the [[Thirty Years' War]], and introducing a system of ''junta'', or small committee, government across Spain in competition to the traditional system of royal councils.\n\nFollowing Olivares' fall from power amidst the crisis of 1640\u20131643, the victim of failed policies and jealousy from the nobles excluded from power, Philip initially announced that he would rule alone, becoming in effect his first minister. The ''junta'' system of government began to be dismantled in favor of the older council system. In due course, however, this personal rule reverted to rule through a royal favorite, initially [[Luis de Haro]], a nephew of Olivares and a childhood playmate of Philip's,<ref>Parker, ''Europe in Crisis'', p. 264.</ref> and the counter-reform of the committee system halted. Historians have not highly regarded de Haro; the comment of one, that de Haro was the 'embodiment of mediocrity,' is not atypical.<ref name=\"Polisensky, p. 224\">Polisensky, p. 224.</ref> After de Haro died in 1661, Olivares' son-in-law, the Duke of Medina de las Torres, became a royal favourite in his place.<ref name=Kamen228>Kamen, p. 228.</ref>\n\n==Foreign policy and the Thirty Years' War==\n[[File:Felipe IV de casta\u00f1o y plata, by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Philip IV at the height of his success, painted c. 1631\u201332 by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]]]\n\nPhilip was to reign through the majority of the [[Thirty Years' War]] in Europe, a turbulent period of military history. In Philip III's final years, [[Baltasar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]] had convinced him to intervene militarily in [[Bohemia]] and the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] on the side of Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]]. Once Philip himself came to power, he was convinced by de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, appointed his principal foreign minister, and Olivares that he should commit Spain to a more aggressive foreign policy in alliance with the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. This would lead Philip to renew hostilities with the Dutch in 1621 in an attempt to bring the provinces to the negotiating table to achieve a peace treaty favourable to Spanish global interests. Philip's government would pursue a 'Netherlands first' strategy throughout the war until 1643.<ref>Parker, ''The Army of Flanders and the Spanish Road'', p. 219.</ref> Despite this shift in policy, Philip does not seem to have been particularly aggressive; early on he noted that having inherited such a large empire, war somewhere across his domains was an inevitable condition,<ref>Kamen, ''Vicissitudes of a World Power'', p. 156.</ref> and he appeared genuinely upset when he came to power and contemplated how much the people of Castile had paid 'in blood' to support the wars of his royal predecessors.<ref>Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto, p. 144.</ref>\n\nThe 1620s were good years for Spanish foreign policy: the war with the Dutch went well, albeit at great expense, culminating in the [[Siege of Breda (1624)|retaking of the key city of Breda]] in 1624. By the end of the decade, however, Philip's government was faced with the question of whether to prioritise the war in Flanders or Spain's relationship with France during the [[War of the Mantuan Succession]] (1628\u20131631). Philip's advisors recommended prioritising the war in Flanders, taking action to safeguard the [[Spanish Road]] to the Netherlands but at the cost of antagonising [[Louis XIII]].<ref>Mackay, p. 5.</ref> Strategically this was to prove a disaster. [[File:Anselmus-van-Hulle-Hommes-illustres MG 0429.tif|thumb|Engraving of Philip IV]]Despite recent Spanish successes in the mid-1630s \u2013 in particular, the triumph of Philip's government in raising a new Spanish army, marching it into Germany to defeat the Swedish-led [[Protestant Union|Protestant forces]] at the [[Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen (1634)|Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen]] in 1634 \u2013 the increased tensions with France made war between the two Catholic states increasingly inevitable. Olivares advised Philip that the coming war with France would be all or nothing; Spain would win or fall by the result.<ref>Corteguera, p. 143.</ref>\n\nThe [[Franco-Spanish War (1635)|Spanish-French war]] that ensued from 1635 onwards was not a foregone conclusion. Early Spanish successes threatened Paris, and even after the Spanish defeat at [[Battle of Rocroi|Rocroi]], Spain remained a strong opponent. But from 1640 onwards, a period which saw large-scale revolts across Spanish territories in protest against the rising costs of the conflict, Spain was finding it difficult to sustain the war. Philip reacted to the increased French threat by finally abandoning his 'Netherlands first' strategy; resources for the [[Army of Flanders]] were savagely cut, and the fight against the French-supported rebels Catalonia took the priority.<ref>Parker, ''The Army of Flanders and the Spanish Road'', p. 221.</ref> Shortly after Rocroi, Philip \u2013 now having had to dismiss his favourite, Olivares \u2013 issued instructions to his ambassadors to seek a peace treaty. The [[Peace of Westphalia]], delivered by Olivares' replacement [[Luis de Haro]], resolved the long-running [[Eighty Years' War]] in the Netherlands and the wars in Germany, but the conflict with France dragged on. Philip responded to the perceived weakness of France during the [[Fronde]] rebellions of 1648 by continuing the fight; he took personal responsibility for the decision to start anew, and ultimately successful, the offensive against the French in Catalonia in 1651.<ref>Elliot, ''The Revolt of the Catalans'', p. 539.</ref> True victory over France never emerged, however, and by 1658, after the loss of [[Dunkirk]] to an Anglo-French force, Philip was personally desperate for peace.<ref>Kamen, p. 222.</ref> The [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] in 1659, and the marriage of Philip's daughter [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]] to the young [[King Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]]<ref name=\"Ishikawa, p. 77\">Ishikawa, p. 77.</ref> finally brought the war with France to a conclusion. The war against Portugal continued, however, as Philip fruitlessly attempted to regain control over his lost kingdom.\n\n==Philip and the Spanish military==\n[[File:Felipe IV; Rey de Espa\u00f1a.jpg|thumb|upright|Philip dressed as a [[cuirassier]], accompanied by a [[court dwarf]], by [[Caspar de Crayer|Gaspar de Crayer]]]]\nBy the late 1620s, the Spanish army was no longer as dominant on the battlefield as it once had been. The feared ''[[tercio]]'' regiments, composed of well-disciplined [[pikemen]], were increasingly appearing inflexible and old-fashioned in the face of the new Swedish and Dutch formations with a higher proportion of [[musketeers]]. Philip and Olivares attempted to address the perceived weaknesses of the army, which they concluded were primarily due to the ''falta de cabezas'', or a lack of leadership. In keeping with their wider agenda of renewing the concepts of duty, service, and aristocratic tradition, the king agreed to efforts to introduce more grandees into the higher ranks of the military, working hard to overcome the reluctance of many to take up field appointments in the [[Spanish Netherlands|Netherlands]] and elsewhere.<ref name=Parker102>Parker, ''The Army of Flanders and the Spanish Road'', p. 101-103.</ref>\n\nThe results were not entirely as hoped. The grandees dragooned into service in this way were disinclined to spend years learning the standard professional military skillset; they wished 'to start as generals and soldiers on the same day,' to quote one disgruntled career soldier.{{Who|date=July 2010}} By the 1630s, the king was waiving the usual rules to enable promotion to higher ranks on a shorter timescale, and having to pay significantly inflated salaries to get grandees to take up even these appointments.<ref name=Parker102/> The performance of these officers at battles such as [[Battle of Rocroi|Rocroi]] left much to be desired.\n\nPhilip was also notable for his interest in the Spanish ''[[Spanish Navy|armada]]'', or navy. Shortly after taking power, he began to increase the size of his fleets, rapidly doubling the size of the naval budget from the start of his reign, then tripling it.<ref>Goodman, ''Spanish Naval Power'', p. 45.</ref> Philip is credited with a 'sensible, pragmatic approach' to provisioning and controlling it.<ref>Goodman, ''Spanish Naval Power'', p. 32.</ref> He was prepared to involve himself in considerable details of naval policy; he was commenting on the detail of provisions for the ''armada'' in 1630, for example.<ref>Goodman, ''Spanish Naval Power'', p. 157.</ref> The ''Junta de Armadas'' was the only ''junta'' committee to survive the fall of Olivares intact.<ref>Goodman, ''Spanish Naval Power'', p. 34.</ref> Even after the disastrous [[Battle of the Downs]], Philip remained closely interested in his navy, including ensuring ministerial attention. In 1646, de Haro was personally involved in supplying and equipping the Atlantic fleet from [[Cadiz]]. Throughout the period, there was no 'weakening of the importance attached to naval forces'<ref>Goodman, ''Spanish Naval Power'', p. 156.</ref> by the king, who argued that joint land and naval operations were essential. Some of his conclusions on naval policy were quite advanced: after the peace of 1648, Philip argued that the Dutch fleets off the Spanish peninsula were good for trade, despite concerns from his senior officials, since they protected the English and French navies.<ref>Goodman, ''Spanish Naval Power'', p. 26.</ref>\n\n==Domestic policy and the crisis of the monarchy==\n{{House of Habsburg (Spain)}}\n[[File:Philip IV of Spain.jpg|thumb|left|An older Philip IV, painted in 1656 by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]]]\n\nPhilip had inherited a huge [[Spanish Empire|empire]] from his father, spanning the known world, but many of his most difficult challenges as king would stem from domestic problems in Spain itself. Spain in the early 17th century was a collection of possessions \u2013 the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], the autonomous provinces of [[Catalonia]] and [[Andalusia]], complete with the wider provinces of [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], the [[Spanish Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Milan]] etc. \u2013 all loosely joined together through the institution of the Castile monarchy and the person of Philip IV.<ref>Parker, ''Europe in Crisis'', p. 61.</ref> Each part had different taxation, privileges and military arrangements; in practice, the level of taxation in many of the more peripheral provinces was less than that in Castile, but the privileged position of the Castilian nobility at all senior levels of royal appointment was a contentious issue for the less favoured provinces. This loose system had successfully resisted reform and higher taxation before, ironically resulting in Spain's having had historically, up until the 1640s at least, fewer than the usual number of fiscal revolts for an early modern European state.<ref>Parker, ''Europe in Crisis'', p. 248.</ref>\n\nIn the first years of his reign, heavily influenced by his royal favourite Olivares, Philip focused on efforts to reform the most chaotic aspects of this system. Frustrated by the notorious slowness of the system of royal councils, Philip supported Olivares' establishment of ''juntas'' \u2013 small committees designed to circumvent the more formal system and to enact policies quickly. Although successful, these ''juntas'' excluded many of the traditional grandees and caused resentment.<ref name=Munck53>Munck, p. 53.</ref> Olivares put forward the idea of a ''Uni\u00f3n de Armas'', or '[[Union of Arms]].' This would have involved establishing a force of 140,000 paid soldiers, supported by equitable taxes from across the Empire, and has been termed 'the most far-sighted proposal of any statesman of the age';<ref>Anderson, p. 44.</ref> in practice. However, it met fierce opposition from the various regional assemblies and the plan was withdrawn. During the 1620s, again influenced by a desire to reform Spanish life for the better, Philip also passed important legislation with puritanical overtones. In 1623, he closed all the legal [[brothel]]s in Spain, extended the dormant [[sumptuary law]]s on luxury goods and supported [[Pope|Papal]] efforts to regulate priests' sexual behaviour more tightly.<ref>Haliczer, p. 18.</ref>\n\n[[File:Museo Arqueol\u00f3gico Nacional - 108085 - Cent\u00e9n segoviano de 1633 01.jpg|thumb|Large gold coin minted in 1633, under the reign of Philip IV]]\n\nPhilip had clear intentions to try to control the Spanish currency, which had become increasingly unstable during the reign of his father and grandfather, but in practice, inflation soared.<ref name=Kamen228/> Partly this was because in 1627 Olivares had attempted to deal with the problem of Philip's [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] bankers \u2013 who had proved uncooperative in recent years \u2013 by declaring a state bankruptcy.<ref>Munck, p. 55.</ref> With the Genoese debt now removed, Olivares hoped to turn to indigenous bankers for renewed funds. In practice, the plan was a disaster. The [[Spanish treasure fleet]] of 1628 was captured by the Dutch, and Spain's ability to borrow and transfer money across Europe declined sharply.\n\nBy the 1630s, Philip's domestic policies were being increasingly impacted by the financial pressures of the Thirty Years' War, and in particular the growing war with France. The costs of the war were huge, and while they had largely fallen upon Castile, the ability of the crown to raise more funds and men from this source was increasingly limited.<ref name=Munck53/> Philip and his government were desperately trying to reduce the responsibilities of the central government in response to the overstretch of the war, and various reform ideas that might have been pursued during the 1620s were rejected on this basis.<ref>Parker, 2005,{{Clarify|date=May 2010}} p. 81.</ref> Financial restraints and higher taxes were put in place, but Philip was increasingly selling off [[Regalian right|regalian]] and [[feudal]] rights, along with much of the royal estate to fund the conflict.<ref>Anderson, p. 72.</ref> It has been argued that the fiscal stringencies of the 1630s, combined with the strength and role of Olivares and the ''juntas'', effectively cut Philip off from the three traditional pillars of support for the monarchy: the grandees, the Church and the Council of Castile.<ref name=\"Stradling, p. 20\">Stradling, p. 20.</ref>\n\nThe crisis came in 1640. An attempt by Olivares to intervene in Catalonia to deal with the French invasion threat resulted in revolt. An alliance of Catalan rebels and French royal forces proved challenging to suppress, and in trying to mobilise Portuguese noble support for the war, Olivares triggered a second uprising. [[Lisbon]]'s nobles expelled Philip, and gave the throne to the [[House of Braganza|Braganzas]], marking the end of sixty years of the [[Iberian Union]] and the beginning of the [[Portuguese Restoration War]]. The next year, the [[Dukes of Medina Sidonia#9th Duke of Medina Sidonia|Duke of Medina Sidonia]] attempted another [[Andalusian independentist conspiracy (1641)|rebellion against Philip from Andalusia]], possibly attempting to reproduce the Braganzas' success in Portugal.<ref>Elliot, ''Richelieu and Olivares'', p. 8.</ref> Although Philip and Olivares were able to repress the ducal revolt, Philip had found himself increasingly isolated. On his return from Zaragoza, where he had been commanding the army, he found only one of the Castilian nobility arrived at court on Easter Day 1641. The threat of Philip's being deposed by the grandees of Castile seemed increasingly real.<ref>Parker, ''Europe in Crisis'', p. 262-263.</ref>\n\nMuch shaken by events, Philip's solution was to remove his royal favourite Olivares from office in 1643 in an attempt to compromise with the Spanish elite. He announced he would rule alone, rejecting both the concept of a royal favourite as first minister and the system of ''junta'' government, which he began to dismantle in favour of the older system of royal councils.<ref name=\"Polisensky, p. 224\"/> Clemency was shown to the Duke of Medina Sidonia. The situation began to stabilise, and before long, Philip felt secure enough to revert to his preferred method of government. [[Luis de Haro]], Olivares' nephew, took over as favourite and minister, and the counter-reform of the ''juntas'' halted. The spark of reform from Philip's earlier years never returned, however. The Catalan rebellion dragged on for several years. In 1652, the Spanish army retook [[Barcelona]], and Philip issued an amnesty for the rebels, promising to respect traditional customs and rights in the future.<ref>Zagorin, p. 37.</ref>\n\n==Patronage of the arts==\n[[File:Lecci\u00f3n de equitaci\u00f3n del pr\u00edncipe Baltasar Carlos, by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez.jpg|thumb|left|[[Balthasar Charles, Prince of Asturias|Prince Baltasar Carlos]] with the [[Gaspar de Guzm\u00e1n y Pimentel, Count-Duke of Olivares|Count-Duke of Olivares]] outside the [[Palacio del Buen Retiro|Buen Retiro palace]], by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], 1636]]\n\nPhilip has been remembered both for the 'astonishing enthusiasm' with which he collected art<ref>[[Andrew Graham-Dixon]]. {{cite episode | title = The Mystical North | episodelink = | series = Art of Spain | serieslink = Art of Spain (TV series) | airdate = 2008-02-14 | season = 1 | number = 3}}</ref> and for his love of theatre. On the stage, he favoured [[Lope de Vega]], [[Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca]], and other distinguished dramatists. Philip has been credited with a share in the composition of several comedies. Court theatre used [[Theatrical scenery|perspective scenery]], a new invention from Italy not used in commercial theatre at the time. Some writers have likened the illusion of Baroque royal theatre to the illusion of kingly power the performances were designed to reinforce.<ref>Robbins, p. 27-28.</ref> Some recent scholarship has suggested that Philip's financial sponsorship of playwrights, however, may have been less extensive than once thought.<ref name=Aercke160/>\n\nArtistically, Philip became famous for his patronage of his court painter [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], who originated from [[Seville]];<ref>Stevenson, p. 10.</ref> mutual contacts caused him to become known to Olivares, who came from the same region. Vel\u00e1zquez was summoned to Madrid by the king in 1624.<ref>Stevenson, p. 11.</ref> Despite some jealousy from the existing court painters, Vel\u00e1zquez rapidly became a success with Philip, being retained for the rest of his career until his death, painting a celebration of the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] for Philip. The king and Vel\u00e1zquez shared common interests in horses, dogs, and art, and in private they formed an easy, relaxed relationship over the years.<ref name=\"Stevenson, p. 7\"/> Philip supported a number of other prominent painters, including [[Eugenio Cax\u00e9s]], [[Vincenzo Carducci|Vicente Carducho]], [[Gonzales Coques|Gonzales]] and [[Angelo Nardi (painter)|Nardi]]. Philip obtained paintings from across Europe, especially Italy, accumulating over 4,000 by the time of his death; some have termed this unparalleled assemblage a 'mega-collection.' <ref>Ishikawa, p. 72.</ref>\n\nPhilip was nicknamed ''el Rey Planeta'', the 'Planet King',<ref name=\"Robbins, p. 27\">Robbins, p. 27.</ref> by his contemporaries, and much of the art and display at his court has been interpreted in the context of his need to project power and authority, over both Spaniards and foreigners alike.<ref name=Aercke142>Aercke, p. 142.</ref> Older interpretations, which perceived Philip's court as being completely decadent, have been largely superseded, but the art and symbolism of the period certainly did not reflect the wider threat and decline of Spanish power.<ref name=Aercke140/> Indeed, the limited Spanish military successes of the period were celebrated by royal artists to a disproportionate extent. Numerous artists from the [[Spanish Netherlands]] produced work extolling the [[Army of Flanders]], including [[Sebastian Vrancx|Vrancx]], [[Peter Snayers|Snaeyers]], [[Jan Miense Molenaer|Molenaer]] and [[Willem Hondius|de Hondt]]. The [[Siege of Breda (1624)|re-capture of Breda]] alone resulted in major works by Vel\u00e1zquez and the French etcher [[Jacques Callot]], in addition to various plays and books.<ref name=Parker102/>\n\nThe 'Planet King' also invested in a new palace to display both his art and the ritual of court. Through Olivares, Philip commenced the building of the ''[[Palacio del Buen Retiro|Buen Retiro palace]]'' in Madrid, parts of which remain near the [[Prado museum|Prado]]. Work began modestly in 1631,<ref name=Aercke142/> with the magnificent, if costly, 'Hall of Thrones', completed by 1635.<ref name=Aercke140/> The palace included its own 'theatre, ballroom, galleries, bull ring, gardens, and artificial lakes',<ref name=\"Robbins, p. 27\"/> and became the centre for artists and dramatists from across Europe. The palace was built during one of the more difficult periods of Philip's reign. Given both its cost, in a time of stringent wartime savings, and the protest that ensued from a disgruntled public,<ref>Haliczar, p. 26.</ref> it is considered to have been an important part of the attempt to communicate royal grandeur and authority.{{by whom|date=February 2019}}\n\n==Philip and religion==\n[[File:Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas de Agreda.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Mar\u00eda de \u00c1greda]], a religious advisor to Philip IV during the second half of his reign]]\n\nThe [[Catholic Church|Catholic religion]] and its rituals played an important part in Philip's life, especially towards the end of his reign. Depressed by events across his domains, he became increasingly concerned with religious affairs.<ref name=\"Ishikawa, p. 77\"/> In particular, Philip paid special devotions to a painting of the ''Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Milagro'', the [[Virgin of Miracles]]; the painting was said to miraculously rise and lower its eyes in response to prayer. While married to [[Elisabeth of France (1602\u20131644)|Elisabeth]], Philip had placed their children under the protection of this image, married to [[Mariana of Austria|Mariana]], they undertook special religious ceremonies together under the gaze of the painting. Philip also had a large standard made with the image of the painting on one side and the royal coat of arms on the other, brought out in processions each year on 12 July.<ref>Goodman, ''Conspicuous In Her Absence'', p. 169-170.</ref> As well as marking a strong personal religious belief, this increasingly visible link between the crown, the Church and national symbols such as the Virgin of Miracles, represented a key pillar of support for Philip as king.<ref name=\"Stradling, p. 20\"/>\n\nMonarchs during the period also had a key role in the [[canonization]] process and could utilise this for domestic or international political effect. Philip, for example, keen to reach out to his Portuguese subjects, put his considerable influence behind the case for [[Elizabeth of Aragon|Isabella of Portugal]], a 14th-century role model of a 'perfect wife,' to great effect, ultimately paying for a lavish celebration in Lisbon after her canonisation in 1625. Internationally, it was important for Spanish prestige for her to receive at least a proportionate, and ideally greater, the share of new saints than other Catholic kingdoms, and Philip sponsored a flurry of texts and books supporting Spain's candidates, particularly in competition with Catholic France.<ref>Haliczer, p. 34-36.</ref>\n[[File:Velazquez-FelipIVVersalles.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Philip in France for his daughter, [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]]]]\n\nDuring the emergency of 1640\u20131643, Philip appears to have had a crisis of faith. Philip genuinely believed the success or failure of his policies represented God's favour and judgement on his actions.<ref name=Haliczer27>Haliczer, p. 27.</ref> The combination of the revolts, the French advances, and the loss of his trusted favourite Olivares appears to have deeply shaken him. Queen Isabella and the new president of the [[Council of Castile]], Don Juan Chumacero \u2013 both involved in the removal of Olivares \u2013 encouraged the king to invite [[Mysticism|mystics]] and visionaries from across Europe to his court at [[Zaragoza]]. The mystics' principal advice centred on the importance of the king's rejecting Olivares' replacement, de Haro and the remaining pro-Olivares nobles at court.<ref name=Haliczer26>Haliczer, p. 26.</ref> The various mystics were not acceptable to broader Spanish noble opinion and, with de Haro's encouragement, they were ultimately dismissed.<ref name=Haliczer27/>\n\nInstead, Philip turned to a better established female mystic, Sister [[Mar\u00eda de \u00c1greda]], a prioress known for her religious writings.<ref name=Haliczer27/> He asked her to correspond with him and to advise him in spiritual matters. The two became regular correspondents throughout the remainder of their lives. This is documented in over 600 confidential letters between them over twenty-two years.<ref name=\"Hume, p\"/> Philip believed that Maria could intercede with God on his behalf and provide advice on what God wished him to do, to improve Spain's failing fortunes.<ref name=Haliczer27/> Most believe that Philip was involved in protecting Maria from the Inquisition's investigation of 1650.<ref>Haliczer, p. 92.</ref> Philip's son, as [[King Charles II of Spain|Charles II]], protected her writings from later censorship.\n\n==Titles and style==\nIn the 1630 [[Treaty of Madrid (1630)|Treaty of Madrid]], Philip was styled \"Philip, by the grace of God [[list of Spanish kings|king of the Spains]], [[list of Sicilian kings|Both the Sicilies]], [[list of kings of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], the Indies, etc., [[archduke of Austria]], [[list of Burgundian dukes|duke of Burgundy]], [[list of Milanese dukes|Milan]], etc., [[list of counts of Habsburg|count of Habsburg]], [[list of Tyrolian counts|Tyrol]], etc.\" in full and \"the [[Most Serene]] Philip IV, [[Rex Catholicismus|Catholic King]] of the Spains,\" for short.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Davenport, p.{{Clarify|date=July 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1648 [[Treaty of M\u00fcnster (1648)|Treaty of M\u00fcnster]], he was styled \"Don Philip the Fourth, by the grace of God king of [[list of Castilian kings|Castile]], [[list of Leonese kings|Leon]], [[list of Aragonese kings|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|the Two Sicilies]], Jerusalem, [[list of Navarrese kings|Navarre]], [[list of kings of Granada|Granada]], [[list of kings of Toledo|Toledo]], [[list of Valencian kings|Valencia]], [[list of Galician kings|Galicia]], [[list of Majorcan kings|Majorca]], [[list of Minorcan kings|Minorca]], [[list of kings of Seville|Seville]], [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]], [[list of kings of Cordoba|Cordoba]], [[list of Sardinian kings|Corsica]], [[list of Murcian kings|Murcia]], [[list of kings of Jaen|Jaen]], [[list of kings of Algeciras|Algeciras]], [[list of kings of Gibraltar|Gibraltar]], the [[list of kings of the Canary Islands|Canary Islands]], the Eastern and Western Indies, the islands and ''terra firma'' of the Ocean, archduke of Austria, duke of Burgundy, [[list of dukes of Brabant|Brabant]], Milan, count of Habsburg, [[list of Flemish counts|Flanders]], Tyrol, [[list of Barcelonian counts|Barcelona]], lord of [[List of lords of Biscay|Biscay]] and [[list of lords of Molina|Molina]], etc.\" in full and \"King of the Spains, Don Philip the Fourth and King of [[list of Portuguese kings|Portugal]] and the [[list of kings of the Algarves|Algarves]] Don Philip the Third \", for short.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n\nPhilip IV's reign, after a few years of inconclusive successes, was characterized by political and military decay and adversity.

He ascended the thrones in 1621 and reigned in Portugal until 1640. Philip is remembered for his patronage of the arts, including such artists as [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], and his rule over Spain during the [[Thirty Years' War]].\n\nBy the time of his death in 1665, the [[Spanish Empire]] had reached approximately 12.2 million square kilometers (4.7 million square miles) in area but in other respects was in decline, a process to which Philip contributed with his inability to achieve successful domestic and military reform.\n\n==Personal life==\nPhilip IV was born in [[Royal Palace of Valladolid]], and was the eldest son of [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] and his wife, [[Margaret of Austria (1584\u20131611)|Margaret of Austria]]. In 1615, at the age of 10, Philip was married to 13-year-old [[Elisabeth of France (1602\u20131644)|Elisabeth of France]], although the relationship does not appear to have been close; some have even suggested that [[Gaspar de Guzm\u00e1n, Count-Duke of Olivares|Olivares]], his key minister, later deliberately tried to keep the two apart to maintain his influence, encouraging Philip to take mistresses instead.<ref name=Stevenson12>Stevenson, p. 12.</ref> Philip had seven children by Elisabeth, with only one being a son, [[Balthasar Charles, Prince of Asturias|Balthasar Charles]], who died at the age of sixteen in 1646. The death of his son deeply shocked the king, who appears to have been a good father by the standards of the day. Elisabeth was able to conspire with other Spanish nobles to remove Olivares from the court in 1643, and for a brief period she held considerable influence over Philip; by the time of her death, however, she was out of favour, following manoeuvering by Olivares' successor, [[Luis de Haro]].<ref name=Stevenson12/>\n\nPhilip remarried in 1649, following the deaths of both Elisabeth and his only legitimate heir. His choice of his second wife, [[Mariana of Austria|Maria Anna]], also known as Mariana, Philip's niece and the daughter of the [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Ferdinand]], was guided by politics and Philip's desire to strengthen the relationship with Habsburg Austria.<ref>Wedgwood, p. 495.</ref> They were married on 7 October 1649. Maria Anna bore him five children, but only two survived to adulthood, a daughter [[Margaret Theresa of Spain|Margarita Teresa]], born in 1651, and the future [[Charles II of Spain]] in 1661 \u2013 but the latter was sickly and considered in frequent danger of dying, making the line of inheritance potentially uncertain.<ref name=Kamen217>Kamen, p. 217.</ref>\n\nPerceptions of Philip's personality have altered considerably over time. Victorian authors were inclined to portray him as a weak individual, delegating excessively to his ministers, and ruling over a debauched [[Baroque]] court.<ref name=Aercke140>Aercke, p. 140.</ref> Victorian historians even attributed the early death of Baltasar to [[Sexually transmitted disease|debauchery]], encouraged by the gentlemen entrusted by the king with his education. The doctors who treated the Prince at that time in fact diagnosed [[smallpox]], although modern scholars attribute his death to [[appendicitis]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Historians' estimation of Philip gradually improved in the 20th century, with comparisons between Philip and his father being increasingly positive \u2013 some noting that he possessed much more energy, both mental and physical, than his diffident father.<ref name=Wedgwood144>Wedgwood, p. 144.</ref>\n\nPhilip was idealised by his contemporaries as the model of [[Baroque]] kingship. Outwardly he maintained a bearing of rigid solemnity; foreign visitors described him as being so impassive in public he resembled a statue,<ref>Darby, p. 5.</ref> and he was said to have been seen to laugh only three times in the course of his entire public life. Philip certainly had a strong sense of his 'royal dignity',<ref name=Elliot47>Elliot, ''Richelieu and Olivares'', p. 47.</ref> but was also extensively coached by Olivares in how to resemble the Baroque model of a sovereign,<ref name=Elliot47/> which would form a key political tool for Philip throughout his reign. Philip was a fine horseman, a keen [[Hunting|hunter]] and a devotee of [[Bullfighting|bull-fighting]],<ref name=Wedgwood144/> all central parts of royal public life at court during the period.\n[[File:Bartolom\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez y Serrano 003.jpg|left|thumb|Philip pictured with his older sister, [[Anne of Austria|Anne]] in 1612 by Bartolom\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez y Serrano]]\n\nPrivately, Philip appears to have had a lighter persona. When he was younger, he was said to have a keen sense of humour and a 'great sense of fun'.<ref>Stradling, p. 84.</ref> He privately attended 'academies' in Madrid throughout his reign \u2013 these were lighthearted literary salons, aiming to analyse contemporary literature and poetry with a humorous touch.<ref>Robbins, p. 31.</ref> A keen theatre-goer, he was sometimes criticised by contemporaries for his love of these 'frivolous' entertainments.<ref>Robbins, p. 28.</ref> Others have captured his private personality as 'naturally kind, gentle and affable'.<ref name=\"Stevenson, p. 7\">Stevenson, p. 7.</ref> Those close to him claimed he was academically competent, with a good grasp of [[Latin]] and [[geography]], and could speak French, Portuguese and Italian well.<ref name=Kamen213>Kamen, p. 213-214.</ref> Like many of his contemporaries, including Olivares, he had a keen interest in [[astrology]].<ref>Aercke, p. 139.</ref> His handwritten translation of [[Francesco Guicciardini]]'s texts on political history still exists.\n\nAlthough interpretations of Philip's role in government have improved in recent years, [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]'s contemporary description of Philip's key weakness \u2013 that 'he mistrusts himself, and defers to others too much' \u2014 remains relevant. Although Philip's Catholic beliefs no longer attract criticism from English language writers, Philip is still felt to have been 'unduly pious' in his personal life.<ref name=Kamen213/> Notably, from the 1640s onwards he sought the advice of a noted cloistered abbess, Sor [[Mar\u00eda de \u00c1greda]], exchanging many letters with her.<ref name=\"Hume, p\">Hume, p. {{Clarify|date=May 2010}}</ref> This did not stop Philip's becoming known for his numerous affairs, particularly with actresses;<ref name=Wedgwood144/> the most famous of these was his actress-mistress Mar\u00eda In\u00e9s Calder\u00f3n (La Calderona),<ref name=Aercke160>Aercke, p. 160.</ref> with whom he had a son in 1629, [[John of Austria the Younger|Juan Jos\u00e9]], who was brought up as a royal prince.<ref name=Kamen217/> By the end of the reign, and with the health of Carlos Jos\u00e9 in doubt, there was a real possibility of Juan Jos\u00e9's making a claim on the throne, which added to the instability of the regency years.\n\n==Philip, Olivares and his royal favourites==\n[[File:Caspar de Crayer - Philip IV (1605\u20131665) in Parade Armor.jpg|thumb|upright|Painting of Philip IV of Spain in armor (1627\u201328) by [[Gaspar de Crayer]] ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]])]]\n\nDuring the reign of Philip's father, Philip III, the royal court had been dominated by the Sandoval noble family, most strikingly by the [[Duke of Lerma]], Philip III's principal favorite and chief minister for almost all of his reign. Philip IV came to power as the influence of the Sandovals was being undermined by a new noble coalition, led by Don [[Baltasar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]]. De Z\u00fa\u00f1iga regarded it as essential that the Sandovals be unable to gain an influence over the future king; de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga first began to develop his own influence over Prince Philip,<ref>Munck, p. 52.</ref> and then introduced his nephew, [[Gaspar de Guzm\u00e1n y Pimentel, Count-Duke of Olivares|Olivares]], to the prince, ten years old at the time.<ref name=Parker232>Parker, ''Europe in Crisis'', p. 232.</ref> At first, Philip did not particularly take to Olivares.<ref name=ElliotRev194>Elliot, ''The Revolt of the Catalans'', p. 194.</ref> Over the course of at least a year, however, the relationship became very close,<ref>Stradling, p. 8.</ref> with Philip's tendency towards underconfidence and diffidence counteracted by Olivares' drive and determination.<ref name=ElliotRev194/> Olivares rapidly became Philip's most trusted advisor, and when Philip ascended the throne in 1621, at the age of sixteen, he showed his confidence in Olivares by ordering that all papers requiring the royal signature should first be sent to the count-duke. Philip retained Olivares as his confidant and chief minister for the next twenty years.\n\n[[File:Retrato de Felipe IV, by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Painting of a youthful Philip IV in 1623 by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], displaying the prominent \"[[Habsburg lip]]\"]]\n\nEarly in his reign, Philip would be woken by Olivares in the morning to discuss the day's affairs<ref name=Parker232/> and would meet with him twice more during the day, although later this routine declined until the king would hold only one short meeting on policy with Olivares each day.<ref name=ElliotRev194/> Philip intervened far more in policies during 1641\u201342, however, and it has been suggested that Philip paid more attention to policymaking than has traditionally been depicted; some recent histories go so far as to describe him as 'conscientious' in policymaking,<ref name=\"Elliot47\"/> although he is still criticised for his failure to make timely decisions.<ref>Elliot, ''The Revolt of the Catalans'', p. 526.</ref> Philip himself argued that it was hardly appropriate for the king himself to go house to house amongst his ministers to see if his instructions were being carried out.<ref>Elliot, ''The Statecraft of Olivares'', p. 121.</ref> The close relationship between Philip and Olivares was demonstrated by their portraits' being placed side by side at the [[Palacio del Buen Retiro|Buen Retiro palace]] \u2014 an act unheard-of in Europe at the time.<ref>Elliot, ''Richelieu and Olivares'', p. 32.</ref> Philip's relationship with Olivares, however, was not a simplistic one. The pair had many rows and arguments over the course of their relationship, both as a result of their different personalities and differences of opinion over policies.<ref>Stradling, p. 83.</ref>\n\nInitially, Philip chose to confirm the reappointment of his father's household to assuage grandee opinion.<ref>Stradling, p. 43.</ref> Under the influence of de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga and Olivares, however, Philip was then quick to place de Lerma's estates \u2013 expanded considerably during his long period as favourite \u2013 under administration, and to remove from office [[Crist\u00f3bal de Sandoval, Duke of Uceda]], de Lerma's son, who had initially helped de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga remove his own father from office to advance his own position.<ref>Williams, p. 248.</ref> Philip's initial announcements reflected an intent to reform the monarchy to the sober, moral position it had been under his grandfather, including selecting ministers whose grandfathers had served under Philip II.<ref>Parker, ''Europe in Crisis'', p. 234.</ref>\n\n[[File:Count-Duke of Olivares.jpg|thumb|Philip IV's most prominent favourite and minister, the [[Gaspar de Guzm\u00e1n y Pimentel, Count-Duke of Olivares|Count-Duke Olivares]], by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]]]\n\nPhilip has in the past been considered to be 'unimaginative' in his politics,<ref name=Wedgwood144/> but recent histories have stressed the more radical elements of his first two decades in power. There was a febrile atmosphere in Spain in the early 17th century, with numerous ''arbitrista'' offering various advice on how to solve Spain's various ills; this advice could, and would, be given in person by those of the lower classes to the king on suitable occasions, provided it was presented with the aim of strengthening the crown.<ref>Corteguera, p. 134.</ref> Those debates extended to the nature of the monarchy. It has been suggested that the writers of the period who best capture Philip's view of royal authority were Justus Lipsius and Giovanni Botero, who promoted religiously inspired, stoic self-sacrifice and a view of Habsburg family-led hegemony respectively.<ref>Ringrose, p. 320.</ref> Whilst at one level conservative \u2013 harking back in foreign policy to the period of [[King Philip II of Spain|Phillip II]], invoking traditional values at home \u2013 Philip's policies were also radical, rejecting the policy towards the rebellious Dutch that had held since 1609, entering into the [[Thirty Years' War]], and introducing a system of ''junta'', or small committee, government across Spain in competition to the traditional system of royal councils.\n\nFollowing Olivares' fall from power amidst the crisis of 1640\u20131643, the victim of failed policies and jealousy from the nobles excluded from power, Philip initially announced that he would rule alone, becoming in effect his own first minister. The ''junta'' system of government began to be dismantled in favor of the older council system. In due course, however, this personal rule reverted to rule through a royal favorite, initially [[Luis de Haro]], a nephew of Olivares and a childhood playmate of Philip's,<ref>Parker, ''Europe in Crisis'', p. 264.</ref> and the counter-reform of the committee system halted. De Haro has not been highly regarded by historians; the comment of one, that de Haro was the 'embodiment of mediocrity', is not atypical.<ref name=\"Polisensky, p. 224\">Polisensky, p. 224.</ref> After de Haro's death in 1661, Olivares' son-in-law, the Duke of Medina de las Torres, became royal favourite in his place.<ref name=Kamen228>Kamen, p. 228.</ref>\n\n==Foreign policy and the Thirty Years' War==\n[[File:Felipe IV de casta\u00f1o y plata, by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Philip IV at the height of his success, painted c. 1631\u201332 by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]]]\n\nPhilip was to reign through the majority of the [[Thirty Years' War]] in Europe, a turbulent period of military history. In Philip III's final years, [[Baltasar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]] had convinced him to intervene militarily in [[Bohemia]] and the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] on the side of Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]]. Once Philip himself came to power, he was convinced by de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, appointed his principal foreign minister, and Olivares that he should commit Spain to a more aggressive foreign policy in alliance with the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. This would lead Philip to renew hostilities with the Dutch in 1621 in an attempt to bring the provinces to the negotiating table with the aim of achieving a peace treaty favourable to Spanish global interests. Philip's government would pursue a 'Netherlands first' strategy throughout the war until 1643.<ref>Parker, ''The Army of Flanders and the Spanish Road'', p. 219.</ref> Despite this shift in policy, Philip does not seem to have been particularly bellicose; early on he noted that having inherited such a large empire, war somewhere across his domains was an inevitable condition,<ref>Kamen, ''Vicissitudes of a World Power'', p. 156.</ref> and he appeared genuinely upset when he came to power and contemplated how much the people of Castile had paid 'in blood' to support the wars of his royal predecessors.<ref>Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto, p. 144.</ref>\n\nThe 1620s were good years for Spanish foreign policy: the war with the Dutch went well, albeit at great expense, culminating in the [[Siege of Breda (1624)|retaking of the key city of Breda]] in 1624. By the end of the decade, however, Philip's government was faced with the question of whether to prioritise the war in Flanders or Spain's relationship with France during the [[War of the Mantuan Succession]] (1628\u20131631). Philip's advisors recommended prioritising the war in Flanders, taking action to safeguard the [[Spanish Road]] to the Netherlands but at the cost of antagonising [[Louis XIII]].<ref>Mackay, p. 5.</ref> Strategically this was to prove a disaster. [[File:Anselmus-van-Hulle-Hommes-illustres MG 0429.tif|thumb|Engraving of Philip IV]]Despite fresh Spanish successes in the mid-1630s \u2013 in particular, the triumph of Philip's government in raising a fresh Spanish army, marching it into Germany to defeat the Swedish-led [[Protestant Union|Protestant forces]] at the [[Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen (1634)|Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen]] in 1634 \u2013 the increased tensions with France made war between the two Catholic states increasingly inevitable. Olivares advised Philip that the coming war with France would be all or nothing; Spain would win or fall by the result.<ref>Corteguera, p. 143.</ref>\n\nThe [[Franco-Spanish War (1635)|Spanish-French war]] that ensued from 1635 onwards was not a foregone conclusion. Early Spanish successes threatened Paris, and even after the Spanish defeat at [[Battle of Rocroi|Rocroi]], Spain remained a strong opponent. But from 1640 onwards, a period which saw large-scale revolts across Spanish territories in protest against the rising costs of the conflict, Spain was finding it difficult to sustain the war. Philip reacted to the increased French threat by finally abandoning his 'Netherlands first' strategy; resources for the [[Army of Flanders]] were savagely cut, and the fight against the French-supported rebels Catalonia took the first priority.<ref>Parker, ''The Army of Flanders and the Spanish Road'', p. 221.</ref> Shortly after Rocroi, Philip \u2013 now having had to dismiss his favourite, Olivares \u2013 issued instructions to his ambassadors to seek a peace treaty. The [[Peace of Westphalia]], delivered by Olivares' replacement [[Luis de Haro]], resolved the long running [[Eighty Years' War]] in the Netherlands and the wars in Germany, but the conflict with France dragged on. Philip responded to the perceived weakness of France during the [[Fronde]] rebellions of 1648 by continuing the fight; he took personal responsibility for the decision to start a fresh, and ultimately successful, offensive against the French in Catalonia in 1651.<ref>Elliot, ''The Revolt of the Catalans'', p. 539.</ref> True victory over France never emerged, however, and by 1658, after the loss of [[Dunkirk]] to an Anglo-French force, Philip was personally desperate for peace.<ref>Kamen, p. 222.</ref> The [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] in 1659, and the marriage of Philip's daughter [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]] to the young [[King Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]]<ref name=\"Ishikawa, p. 77\">Ishikawa, p. 77.</ref> finally brought the war with France to a conclusion. The war against Portugal continued however, as Philip fruitlessly attempted to regain control over his lost kingdom.\n\n==Philip and the Spanish military==\n[[File:Felipe IV; Rey de Espa\u00f1a.jpg|thumb|upright|Philip dressed as a [[cuirassier]], accompanied by a [[court dwarf]], by [[Caspar de Crayer|Gaspar de Crayer]]]]\nBy the late 1620s, the Spanish army was no longer as dominant on the battlefield as it once had been. The feared ''[[tercio]]'' regiments, composed of well-disciplined [[pikemen]], were increasingly appearing inflexible and outmoded in the face of the new Swedish and Dutch formations with a higher proportion of [[musketeers]]. Philip and Olivares attempted to address the perceived weaknesses of the army, which they concluded were primarily due to the ''falta de cabezas'', or a lack of leadership. In keeping with their wider agenda of renewing the concepts of duty, service and aristocratic tradition, the king agreed to efforts to introduce more grandees into the higher ranks of the military, working hard to overcome the reluctance of many to take up field appointments in the [[Spanish Netherlands|Netherlands]] and elsewhere.<ref name=Parker102>Parker, ''The Army of Flanders and the Spanish Road'', p. 101-103.</ref>\n\nThe results were not entirely as hoped. The grandees dragooned into service in this way were disinclined to spend years learning the normal professional military skill set; they wished 'to start out as generals and soldiers on the same day', to quote one disgruntled career soldier.{{Who|date=July 2010}} By the 1630s, the king was waiving the usual rules to enable promotion to higher ranks on a shorter timescale, and having to pay significantly inflated salaries to get grandees to take up even these appointments.<ref name=Parker102/> The performance of these officers at battles such as [[Battle of Rocroi|Rocroi]] left much to be desired.\n\nPhilip was also notable for his interest in the Spanish ''[[Spanish Navy|armada]]'', or navy. Shortly after taking power he began to increase the size of his fleets, rapidly doubling the size of the naval budget from the start of his reign, then tripling it.<ref>Goodman, ''Spanish Naval Power'', p. 45.</ref> Philip is credited with a 'sensible, pragmatic approach' to provisioning and controlling it.<ref>Goodman, ''Spanish Naval Power'', p. 32.</ref> He was prepared to involve himself in considerable details of naval policy; he was commenting on the detail of provisions for the ''armada'' in 1630, for example.<ref>Goodman, ''Spanish Naval Power'', p. 157.</ref> The ''Junta de Armadas'' was the only ''junta'' committee to survive the fall of Olivares intact.<ref>Goodman, ''Spanish Naval Power'', p. 34.</ref> Even after the disastrous [[Battle of the Downs]], Philip remained closely interested in his navy, including ensuring ministerial attention. In 1646, de Haro was personally involved in supplying and equipping the Atlantic fleet from [[Cadiz]]. Throughout the period there was no 'weakening of the importance attached to naval forces'<ref>Goodman, ''Spanish Naval Power'', p. 156.</ref> by the king, who argued that joint land and naval operations were essential. Some of his conclusions on naval policy were quite advanced: after the peace of 1648, Philip argued that the Dutch fleets off the Spanish peninsula were actually good for trade, despite concerns from his senior officials, since they provided protection against the English and French navies.<ref>Goodman, ''Spanish Naval Power'', p. 26.</ref>\n\n==Domestic policy and the crisis of the monarchy==\n{{House of Habsburg (Spain)}}\n[[File:Philip IV of Spain.jpg|thumb|left|An older Philip IV, painted in 1656 by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]]]\n\nPhilip had inherited a huge [[Spanish Empire|empire]] from his father, spanning the known world, but many of his most difficult challenges as king would stem from domestic problems in Spain itself. Spain in the early 17th century was a collection of possessions \u2013 the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], the autonomous provinces of [[Catalonia]] and [[Andalusia]], complete with the wider provinces of [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], the [[Spanish Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Milan]] etc. \u2013 all loosely joined together through the institution of the Castile monarchy and the person of Philip IV.<ref>Parker, ''Europe in Crisis'', p. 61.</ref> Each part had different taxation, privileges and military arrangements; in practice, the level of taxation in many of the more peripheral provinces was less than that in Castile, but the privileged position of the Castilian nobility at all senior levels of royal appointment was a contentious issue for the less favoured provinces. This loose system had successfully resisted reform and higher taxation before, ironically resulting in Spain's having had historically, up until the 1640s at least, fewer than the usual number of fiscal revolts for an early modern European state.<ref>Parker, ''Europe in Crisis'', p. 248.</ref>\n\nIn the first years of his reign, heavily influenced by his royal favourite Olivares, Philip focused on efforts to reform the most chaotic aspects of this system. Frustrated by the notorious slowness of the system of royal councils, Philip supported Olivares' establishment of ''juntas'' \u2013 small committees designed to circumvent the more formal system and to enact policies quickly. Although successful, these ''juntas'' excluded many of the traditional grandees and caused resentment.<ref name=Munck53>Munck, p. 53.</ref> Olivares put forward the idea of a ''Uni\u00f3n de Armas'', or '[[Union of Arms]]'. This would have involved establishing a force of 140,000 paid soldiers, supported by equitable taxes from across the Empire, and has been termed 'the most far-sighted proposal of any statesman of the age';<ref>Anderson, p. 44.</ref> in practice, however, it met fierce opposition from the various regional assemblies and the plan was withdrawn. During the 1620s, again influenced by a desire to reform Spanish life for the better, Philip also passed considerable legislation with puritanical overtones. In 1623, he closed all the legal [[brothel]]s in Spain, extended the dormant [[sumptuary law]]s on luxury goods and supported [[Pope|Papal]] efforts to regulate priests' sexual behaviour more tightly.<ref>Haliczer, p. 18.</ref>\n\n[[File:Museo Arqueol\u00f3gico Nacional - 108085 - Cent\u00e9n segoviano de 1633 01.jpg|thumb|Large gold coin minted in 1633, under the reign of Philip IV]]\n\nPhilip had clear intentions to try to control the Spanish currency, which had become increasingly unstable during the reign of his father and grandfather, but in practice, inflation soared.<ref name=Kamen228/> Partly this was because in 1627 Olivares had attempted to deal with the problem of Philip's [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] bankers \u2013 who had proved uncooperative in recent years \u2013 by declaring a state bankruptcy.<ref>Munck, p. 55.</ref> With the Genoese debt now removed, Olivares hoped to turn to indigenous bankers for renewed funds. In practice, the plan was a disaster. The [[Spanish treasure fleet]] of 1628 was captured by the Dutch, and Spain's ability to borrow and transfer money across Europe declined sharply.\n\nBy the 1630s, Philip's domestic policies were being increasingly impacted by the financial pressures of the Thirty Years' War, and in particular the growing war with France. The costs of the war were huge, and whilst they had largely fallen upon Castile, the ability of the crown to raise more funds and men from this source was increasingly limited.<ref name=Munck53/> Philip and his government were desperately trying to reduce the responsibilities of central government in response to the overstretch of the war, and various reform ideas that might have been pursued during the 1620s were rejected on this basis.<ref>Parker, 2005,{{Clarify|date=May 2010}} p. 81.</ref> Financial restraints and higher taxes were put in place, but Philip was increasingly selling off [[Regalian right|regalian]] and [[feudal]] rights, along with much of the royal estate to fund the conflict.<ref>Anderson, p. 72.</ref> It has been argued that the fiscal stringencies of the 1630s, combined with the strength and role of Olivares and the ''juntas'', effectively cut Philip off from the three traditional pillars of support for the monarchy: the grandees, the Church and the Council of Castile.<ref name=\"Stradling, p. 20\">Stradling, p. 20.</ref>\n\nCrisis came in 1640. An attempt by Olivares to intervene in Catalonia to deal with the French invasion threat resulted in revolt. An alliance of Catalan rebels and French royal forces proved challenging to suppress, and in trying to mobilise Portuguese noble support for the war, Olivares triggered a second uprising. [[Lisbon]]'s nobles expelled Philip, and gave the throne to the [[House of Braganza|Braganzas]], marking the end of sixty years of the [[Iberian Union]] and the beginning of the [[Portuguese Restoration War]]. The next year, the [[Dukes of Medina Sidonia#9th Duke of Medina Sidonia|Duke of Medina Sidonia]] attempted another [[Andalusian independentist conspiracy (1641)|rebellion against Philip from Andalusia]], possibly attempting to reproduce the Braganzas' success in Portugal.<ref>Elliot, ''Richelieu and Olivares'', p. 8.</ref> Although Philip and Olivares were able to repress the ducal revolt, Philip had found himself increasingly isolated. On his return from Zaragoza, where he had been commanding the army, he found only one of the Castilian nobility arrived at court on Easter Day 1641. The threat of Philip's being deposed by the grandees of Castile seemed increasingly real.<ref>Parker, ''Europe in Crisis'', p. 262-263.</ref>\n\nMuch shaken by events, Philip's solution was to remove his royal favourite Olivares from office in 1643 in an attempt to compromise with the Spanish elite. He announced he would rule alone, rejecting both the concept of a royal favourite as first minister and the system of ''junta'' government, which he began to dismantle in favour of the older system of royal councils.<ref name=\"Polisensky, p. 224\"/> Clemency was shown to the Duke of Medina Sidonia. The situation began to stabilise, and before long Philip felt secure enough to revert to his preferred method of government. [[Luis de Haro]], Olivares' nephew, took over as favourite and minister and the counter-reform of the ''juntas'' halted. The spark of reform from Philip's earlier years never returned, however. The Catalan rebellion dragged on for several years. In 1652, the Spanish army retook [[Barcelona]] and Philip issued an amnesty for the rebels, promising to respect traditional customs and rights in the future.<ref>Zagorin, p. 37.</ref>\n\n==Patronage of the arts==\n[[File:Lecci\u00f3n de equitaci\u00f3n del pr\u00edncipe Baltasar Carlos, by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez.jpg|thumb|left|[[Balthasar Charles, Prince of Asturias|Prince Baltasar Carlos]] with the [[Gaspar de Guzm\u00e1n y Pimentel, Count-Duke of Olivares|Count-Duke of Olivares]] outside the [[Palacio del Buen Retiro|Buen Retiro palace]], by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], 1636]]\n\nPhilip has been remembered both for the 'astonishing enthusiasm' with which he collected art<ref>[[Andrew Graham-Dixon]]. {{cite episode | title = The Mystical North | episodelink = | series = Art of Spain | serieslink = Art of Spain (TV series) | airdate = 2008-02-14 | season = 1 | number = 3}}</ref> and for his love of theatre. On the stage, he favoured [[Lope de Vega]], [[Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca]], and other distinguished dramatists. Philip has been credited with a share in the composition of several comedies. Court theatre used [[Theatrical scenery|perspective scenery]], a new invention from Italy not used in commercial theatre at the time. Some writers have likened the illusion of Baroque royal theatre to the illusion of kingly power the performances were designed to reinforce.<ref>Robbins, p. 27-28.</ref> Some recent scholarship has suggested that Philip's financial sponsorship of playwrights, however, may have been less extensive than once thought.<ref name=Aercke160/>\n\nArtistically, Philip became famous for his patronage of his court painter [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], who originated from [[Seville]];<ref>Stevenson, p. 10.</ref> mutual contacts caused him to become known to Olivares, who came from the same region. Vel\u00e1zquez was summoned to Madrid by the king in 1624.<ref>Stevenson, p. 11.</ref> Despite some jealousy from the existing court painters, Vel\u00e1zquez rapidly became a success with Philip, being retained for the rest of his career until his death, painting a celebration of the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] for Philip. The king and Vel\u00e1zquez shared common interests in horses, dogs and art, and in private they formed an easy, relaxed relationship over the years.<ref name=\"Stevenson, p. 7\"/> Philip supported a number of other prominent painters, including [[Eugenio Cax\u00e9s]], [[Vincenzo Carducci|Vicente Carducho]], [[Gonzales Coques|Gonzales]] and [[Angelo Nardi (painter)|Nardi]]. Philip obtained paintings from across Europe, especially Italy, accumulating over 4,000 by the time of his death; some have termed this unparalleled assemblage a 'mega-collection'.<ref>Ishikawa, p. 72.</ref>\n\nPhilip was nicknamed ''el Rey Planeta'', the 'Planet King',<ref name=\"Robbins, p. 27\">Robbins, p. 27.</ref> by his contemporaries, and much of the art and display at his court has been interpreted in the context of his need to project power and authority, over both Spaniards and foreigners alike.<ref name=Aercke142>Aercke, p. 142.</ref> Older interpretations, which perceived Philip's court as being completely decadent, have been largely superseded, but the art and symbolism of the period certainly did not reflect the wider threat and decline of Spanish power.<ref name=Aercke140/> Indeed, the limited Spanish military successes of the period were celebrated by royal artists to a disproportionate extent. Numerous artists from the [[Spanish Netherlands]] produced work extolling the [[Army of Flanders]], including [[Sebastian Vrancx|Vrancx]], [[Peter Snayers|Snaeyers]], [[Jan Miense Molenaer|Molenaer]] and [[Willem Hondius|de Hondt]]. The [[Siege of Breda (1624)|re-capture of Breda]] alone resulted in major works by Vel\u00e1zquez and the French etcher [[Jacques Callot]], in addition to various plays and books.<ref name=Parker102/>\n\nThe 'Planet King' also invested in a new palace to display both his art and the ritual of court. Through Olivares, Philip commenced the building of the ''[[Palacio del Buen Retiro|Buen Retiro palace]]'' in Madrid, parts of which still remain near the [[Prado museum|Prado]]. Work began modestly in 1631,<ref name=Aercke142/> with the magnificent, if costly, 'Hall of Thrones', completed by 1635.<ref name=Aercke140/> The palace included its own 'theatre, ballroom, galleries, bull ring, gardens, and artificial lakes',<ref name=\"Robbins, p. 27\"/> and became the centre for artists and dramatists from across Europe. The palace was built during one of the more difficult periods of Philip's reign. Given both its cost, in a time of stringent wartime savings, and the protest that ensued from a disgruntled public,<ref>Haliczar, p. 26.</ref> it is considered to have been an important part of the attempt to communicate royal grandeur and authority.{{by whom|date=February 2019}}\n\n==Philip and religion==\n[[File:Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas de Agreda.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Mar\u00eda de \u00c1greda]], a religious advisor to Philip IV during the second half of his reign]]\n\nThe [[Catholic Church|Catholic religion]] and its rituals played an important part in Philip's life, especially towards the end of his reign. Depressed by events across his domains, he became increasingly concerned with religious affairs.<ref name=\"Ishikawa, p. 77\"/> In particular, Philip paid special devotions to a painting of the ''Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Milagro'', the [[Virgin of Miracles]]; the painting was said to miraculously raise and lower its eyes in response to prayer. Whilst married to [[Elisabeth of France (1602\u20131644)|Elisabeth]], Philip had placed their children under the protection of this image; married to [[Mariana of Austria|Mariana]], they undertook special religious ceremonies together under the gaze of the painting. Philip also had a large standard made with the image of the painting on one side and the royal coat of arms on the other, brought out in processions each year on 12 July.<ref>Goodman, ''Conspicuous In Her Absence'', p. 169-170.</ref> As well as marking a strong personal religious belief, this increasingly visible link between the crown, the Church and national symbols such as the Virgin of Miracles, represented a key pillar of support for Philip as king.<ref name=\"Stradling, p. 20\"/>\n\nMonarchs during the period also had a key role in the [[canonization]] process and could utilise this for domestic or international political effect. Philip, for example, keen to reach out to his Portuguese subjects, put his considerable influence behind the case for [[Elizabeth of Aragon|Isabella of Portugal]], a 14th-century role model of a 'perfect wife', to great effect, ultimately paying for a lavish celebration in Lisbon after her canonisation in 1625. Internationally, it was important for Spanish prestige for her to receive at least a proportionate, and ideally greater, share of new saints than other Catholic kingdoms, and Philip sponsored a flurry of texts and books supporting Spain's candidates, particularly in competition with Catholic France.<ref>Haliczer, p. 34-36.</ref>\n[[File:Velazquez-FelipIVVersalles.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Philip in France for his daughter, [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]]]]\n\nDuring the emergency of 1640\u20131643, Philip appears to have had a crisis of faith. Philip genuinely believed the success or failure of his policies represented God's favour and judgement on his actions.<ref name=Haliczer27>Haliczer, p. 27.</ref> The combination of the revolts, the French advances and the loss of his trusted favourite Olivares appears to have deeply shaken him. Queen Isabella and the new president of the [[Council of Castile]], Don Juan Chumacero \u2013 both involved in the removal of Olivares \u2013 encouraged the king to invite [[Mysticism|mystics]] and visionaries from across Europe to his court at [[Zaragoza]]. The mystics' principal advice centred on the importance of the king's rejecting Olivares' replacement, de Haro and the remaining pro-Olivares nobles at court.<ref name=Haliczer26>Haliczer, p. 26.</ref> The various mystics were not acceptable to broader Spanish noble opinion and, with de Haro's encouragement, they were ultimately dismissed.<ref name=Haliczer27/>\n\nInstead, Philip turned to a better established female mystic, Sister [[Mar\u00eda de \u00c1greda]], a prioress known for her religious writings.<ref name=Haliczer27/> He asked her to correspond with him and to advise him in spiritual matters. The two became regular correspondents throughout the remainder of their lives. This is documented in over 600 confidential letters between them over a period of twenty-two years.<ref name=\"Hume, p\"/> Philip clearly believed that Maria could intercede with God on his behalf and provide advice on what God wished him to do, to improve Spain's failing fortunes.<ref name=Haliczer27/> Most believe that Philip was involved in protecting Maria from the Inquisition's investigation of 1650.<ref>Haliczer, p. 92.</ref> Philip's son, as [[King Charles II of Spain|Charles II]], protected her writings from later censorship.\n\n==Titles and style==\nIn the 1630 [[Treaty of Madrid (1630)|Treaty of Madrid]], Philip was styled \"Philip, by the grace of God [[list of Spanish kings|king of the Spains]], [[list of Sicilian kings|Both the Sicilies]], [[list of kings of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], the Indies, etc., [[archduke of Austria]], [[list of Burgundian dukes|duke of Burgundy]], [[list of Milanese dukes|Milan]], etc., [[list of counts of Habsburg|count of Habsburg]], [[list of Tyrolian counts|Tyrol]], etc.\" in full and \"the [[Most Serene]] Philip IV, [[Rex Catholicismus|Catholic King]] of the Spains,\" for short.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Davenport, p.{{Clarify|date=July 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1648 [[Treaty of M\u00fcnster (1648)|Treaty of M\u00fcnster]], he was styled \"Don Philip the Fourth, by the grace of God king of [[list of Castilian kings|Castile]], [[list of Leonese kings|Leon]], [[list of Aragonese kings|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|the Two Sicilies]], Jerusalem, [[list of Navarrese kings|Navarre]], [[list of kings of Granada|Granada]], [[list of kings of Toledo|Toledo]], [[list of Valencian kings|Valencia]], [[list of Galician kings|Galicia]], [[list of Majorcan kings|Majorca]], [[list of Minorcan kings|Minorca]], [[list of kings of Seville|Seville]], [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]], [[list of kings of Cordoba|Cordoba]], [[list of Sardinian kings|Corsica]], [[list of Murcian kings|Murcia]], [[list of kings of Jaen|Jaen]], [[list of kings of Algeciras|Algeciras]], [[list of kings of Gibraltar|Gibraltar]], the [[list of kings of the Canary Islands|Canary Islands]], the Eastern and Western Indies, the islands and ''terra firma'' of the Ocean, archduke of Austria, duke of Burgundy, [[list of dukes of Brabant|Brabant]], Milan, count of Habsburg, [[list of Flemish counts|Flanders]], Tyrol, [[list of Barcelonian counts|Barcelona]], lord of [[List of lords of Biscay|Biscay]] and [[list of lords of Molina|Molina]], etc.\" in full and \"King of the Spains, Don Philip the Fourth and King of [[list of Portuguese kings|Portugal]] and the [[list of kings of the Algarves|Algarves]] Don Philip the Third \", for short.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n\nPhilip IV's reign, after a few years of inconclusive successes, was characterized by political and military decay and adversity.

Her design process involved appropriating an original advertising graphic to suit her idea; for example, she would tear, rip, or crumble the image, then re-photograph it. She often used grocery store signage, texts from scripture, newspaper clippings, song lyrics, and writings from literary greats such as [[Gertrude Stein]], [[E. E. Cummings]], and [[Albert Camus]] as the textual focal point of her work.<ref>Axell, Evelyne, and Angela Stief. \"Sister Corita.\" Power up - Female Pop Art: Evelyne Axell, Sister Corita, Christa Dichgans, Rosalyn Drexler, Jann Haworth, Dorothy Iannone, Kiki Kogelnik, Marisol, Niki De Saint Phalle; Kunsthalle Wien, 5.

In parallel, the Swedish group developed the whole pancreas transplantation technique with enteric diversion. It was the onset of the whole pancreas reign. The enthusiasm for the technique was rather moderated in its early phase due to the rapid development of liver transplantation and the need for sharing vascular structures between both organs, liver and pancreas.

{"title_page": "KITT", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Kitt (disambiguation)}}\n{{short description|Fictional car in the 1980s television series Knight Rider}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{More citations needed|date=October 2009}}\n\n'''KITT''' is the short name of two fictional characters from the adventure franchise [[Knight Rider]]. While having the same acronym, the KITTs are two different entities: one known as the '''Knight Industries Two Thousand''', which appeared in the original TV series ''Knight Rider'', and the other as the '''Knight Industries Three Thousand''', which appeared first in the two-hour 2008 [[Knight Rider (2008 film)|pilot film]] for a new ''Knight Rider'' TV series and then the [[Knight Rider (2008 TV series)|new series]] itself. In both instances, KITT is an artificially intelligent electronic computer module in the body of a highly advanced, very mobile, robotic automobile: the original KITT as a 1982 [[Pontiac Firebird#Third generation (1982\u20131992)|Pontiac Firebird Trans Am]], and the second KITT as a [[Shelby Mustang#2008\u20132009 GT500KR|2008\u20132009 Ford Shelby GT500KR]]. KITT was voiced by [[William Daniels]] in the original series, and by [[Val Kilmer]] in the 2008 series. KITT's evil twin is [[KARR (Knight Rider)|KARR]] which is an acronym of Knight Automated Roving Robot.  KARR was voiced by both [[Peter Cullen]] and [[Paul Frees]] in season one and season three of the NBC original TV series respectively in Knight Rider.\n\nA 1991 sequel film ''[[Knight Rider 2000]]'' saw KITT's original microprocessor unit transferred into the body of the vehicle intended to be his successor, the Knight Industries Four Thousand (Knight 4000), voiced by [[Carmen Argenziano]] and [[William Daniels]].\n\n==Knight Industries Two Thousand (KITT)==\n{{Infobox character\n|colour      = #DEDEE5\n|name        = Knight Industries Two Thousand\n|series      = [[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]\n|image       = [[File:KITT at Universal Studios, original uncropped version.jpg|300px]]\n|caption     = KITT on display at [[Universal Studios]] in 1993.

The 2008 [[Knight Rider (2008 film)|pilot movie]] later implied that Charles Graiman, creator of the Knight Industries Three Thousand, also had a hand in designing the first KITT.\n\nAccording to the series, the original KITT's main cybernetic processor was first installed in a [[mainframe computer]] used by the US government in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=\"kitt-r1\"/> However, Wilton saw better use for \"him\" in the Foundation's crime-fighting crusade and eventually the system was installed in the vehicle. KITT was in fact the second vehicle built by Knight Industries with [[artificial intelligence]]. His predecessor was [[KARR (Knight Rider)|KARR]], the ''Knight Automated Roving Robot''. KARR was programmed for self-preservation, but this proved to be dangerous to the Foundation's humanitarian interests. KARR was later deactivated and placed in storage while KITT was given to his new operator, [[Michael Knight (Knight Rider)|Michael Knight]]. KARR was later unwittingly reactivated by thieves in the original episode \"[[KARR (Knight Rider)#\"Trust Doesn't Rust\" \u2013 Season 1, Episode 9|Trust Doesn't Rust]]\", was thought destroyed, then reappeared in the episode \"[[KARR (Knight Rider)#Appearances in the original series|K.I.T.T. vs. K.A.R.R]]\" and was seen to be finally destroyed by Michael and KITT.\n\nWhile the 2008 [[Knight Rider (2008 film)|pilot movie]] and then the [[Knight Rider (2008 TV series)|new series]] appears to be a revamp of the original series, it offers some continuity from the original TV series. The \"new\" or \"second\" KITT (Knight Industries Three Thousand) is a different vehicle and microprocessor unit. The original Knight Industries Two Thousand is also shown in the [[Knight Rider (2008 film)|pilot movie]] (although in pieces) in the scene where the garage of Charles Graiman (creator of the Knight Industries Three Thousand and implied co-designer of the original KITT) is searched by antagonists. A Trans-Am body (without its hood) is partially covered by a tarp, on which rests the rear spoiler. The famous KITT steering wheel (labelled \"Knight Two Thousand\") and \"KNIGHT\" license plate are also shown, along with numerous black car body parts. When the camera shows a full scene of the garage, there are three cars in the garage: the 3000, a 2000 under a tarp, and a complete 2000.\n\nThe 1991 movie ''[[Knight Rider 2000]]'' saw the first KITT (Knight Industries Two Thousand) in pieces, and [[Michael Knight (Knight Rider)|Michael Knight]] himself reviving the microprocessor unit, which is eventually transferred into the body of the vehicle intended to be the original KITT's direct successor, the Knight 4000. The new vehicle was a modified 1991 [[Mitsubishi GTO|Dodge Stealth]], appearing similar to the [[Pontiac Banshee]] prototype. However, no reference to this storyline nor any appearance of the Knight 4000 is made in the [[Knight Rider (2008 TV series)|new series]] or its 2008 [[Knight Rider (2008 film)|pilot movie]]. In ''Knight Rider 2000'', it is stated that most of the Knight 2000 parts had been sold off. However, Graiman's garage in the 2008 pilot shows a more complete collection of parts than in the boxes recovered by Michael Knight in ''Knight Rider 2000''. This adds to the mystique of the current whereabouts of the original KITT in the time-frame of the new series.\n\nIn the 1997\u20131998 spin-off series ''[[Team Knight Rider]]'', KITT is employed as a shadow advisor. It is later revealed that \"The Shadow\" is actually a hologram run by KITT. In \"Knight of the Living Dead\", Graiman states a third KITT exists as a backup. When KITT is about to die, his memories are downloaded so the third KITT can use them. However, in the end the third AI is not used.\n\n===Features===\n{{in-universe|date=March 2013}}\nThe front-mounted scanner bar that, among other things, allowed KITT to see was a nod to the [[Cylon (1978)|Cylons]], villains from the TV series ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', which had been created by [[Glen A. Larson]], who also created ''Knight Rider'' and even used the iconic Cylon eye scanner audio to that effect.<ref>{{cite web |last1=JUDE |first1=TAMARA |title=16 Things You Didn't Know About Battlestar Galactica |url=https://screenrant.com/battlestar-galactica-tv-show-movie-trivia-facts/ |website=Screenrant |accessdate=July 12, 2019|date=March 2017 }}</ref>\n\nA refit in the 1985\u201386 season included the addition of \"Super Pursuit Mode\" and a convertible top.\n\n;Computer AI : KITT is essentially an advanced [[supercomputer]] on wheels. The \"brain\" of KITT is the Knight 2000 [[microprocessor]] which is the centre of a \"[[Self-awareness|self-aware]]\" [[Cybernetics|cybernetic]] logic module that allowed KITT to think, learn, communicate and interact with humans. He is also capable of independent thought and action. He always had an ego that was easy to bruise and displayed a very sensitive, but kind and dryly humorous personality. He also has an in-dash entertainment system that can play music and video, and run various computer programs including [[arcade game]]s which Michael sometimes indulged in while KITT was driving. According to Episode 55, \"Dead of Knight\", KITT has 1,000 [[megabit]]s of memory with one [[nanosecond]] [[access time]]. According to Episode 65, \"Ten Wheel Trouble\", KITT's future capacity is unlimited. KITT's serial number is AD227529, as mentioned in Episode 31, \"Soul Survivor\".\n\n;Alpha Circuit : KITT's \"Alpha Circuit\" is part of KITT's main control system which allows the CPU to drive the car. The time KITT's \"evil twin\" [[Knight Automated Roving Robot|KARR]] spent submerged in water damaged his Alpha Circuit, which required KARR to have an operator to control his Turbo Boost function.\n\n;Molecular Bonded Shell : KITT is armored with \"Tri-Helical Plasteel 1000 MBS\" (Molecular Bonded Shell) plating which protects him from almost all forms of conventional firearms and explosive devices. He could only be harmed by heavy artillery and rockets, and even then, the blast usually left most of his body intact and only damaged internal components. The shell protected every part of the car including the tires. As a result, KITT's body is durable enough to act as a shield for explosives by driving over bombs to cover them and suppress the blast, ram through rigid barriers of strong material like cinder block walls or steel gates without suffering damage himself while damage to the car's structural integrity with its frequent long jumps on turbo boost is never an issue. The shell also protected him from fire and electricity; however, it was vulnerable to some potent acids and at least one formula was made (with knowledge of the shell's chemical base) to partially neutralize it. The shell is actually a combination of three secret substances referred together as the \"Knight Compound\", developed by Wilton Knight who entrusted parts of the formula to three separate people. These individuals each only know two pieces of the formula, ensuring that any two of them could make more of the Knight Compound in an emergency situation and that no one person would be able to make it alone. The shell provided a frame tolerance of 223,000&nbsp;lb (111.5 tons) and a front and rear axle suspension load of 57,000&nbsp;lb (28.5 tons). In the pilot \"Knight of the Phoenix\", the shell is described as the panels of the car itself; in the later episodes, especially from season two onward, the idea of the shell being applied to a base vehicle chemically is used.\n\n;[[Pyroclastic rock|Pyroclastic]] Lamination : KITT is protected by a thermal-resistant coating that can withstand sustained temperatures of up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit (426&nbsp;\u00b0C). First used in Episode 32, \"Ring of Fire\".\n\n;Power System : KITT is powered by the Knight Industries [[turbojet]] with modified [[afterburner]]s and a computer controlled 8-speed turbodrive transmission. Specifications 0\u201360&nbsp;mph in 2 seconds (1.37g), standing to quarter mile 4.286 seconds. Electromagnetic hyper-vacuum disc brakes: 14 foot (4.25&nbsp;m) braking distance (70\u20130&nbsp;mph \u2013 112\u20130&nbsp;km/h - 11.7g).\n[[File:Modulador_de_voz_kitt_11-4-2020.png|thumb|KITT and KARR Voice Modulator]]\n[[File:KITT Interior at Toronto Auto Show 2011.jpg|thumb|KITT instrumentation (1st/2nd seasons)]]\n[[File:Knight Rider Supercar KITT instrumentation.jpg|thumb|KITT instrumentation (3rd/4th seasons)]]\n\n;Turbo Boost : Used in most episodes, a pair of rocket boosters mounted just behind the front tires that lifted the car, allowing KITT to jump into the air and pass over obstacles in the road. Also, occasionally, Turbo Boost was used to allow KITT to accelerate to incredible speeds in excess of 200&nbsp;mph (322&nbsp;km/h). The boosters could fire forward or backward.\n\n;Voice (Anharmonic) Synthesizer : KITT's Voice Synthesizer allowed his logic module to speak and communicate. With it, KITT could also simulate other sounds. KITT's primary spoken language was English; however by accessing his language module, he could speak fluently in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]] and much more. The module can be adjusted giving KITT different [[accent (dialect)|accent]]s such as in Episode 82, \"Out of the Woods\", where KITT uses a \"New York City\" accent and called Michael, \"Micky\". During the first season, KITT's \"mouth\" (\"Voice Modulator\") in the interior of the vehicle was a flashing red square. In episode 14 \"Heart of Stone\", this was changed to three sectioned vertical bars, as this design proved popular with fans as part of KARR. (KARR used a bright yellow display with an inner bar that expanded outward and two outer bars that expanded from both ends inward, whereas KITT's was red and all three bars expanded outward from the center, but with greater magnitude in the center bar.)\n\n;Voice Projection: KITT can project his voice at any position. First used in Episode 48, \"Knight of the Drones, Pt. 2\".\n\n;Anamorphic Equalizer : KITT's most apparent feature was his front scan bar called the Anamorphic Equalizer. The device is a [[Optical fiber|fibre-optic]] array of electronic eyes. The scanner could see in all visual [[wavelength]]s as well as [[X-ray]] and [[infrared]]. Occasionally, the bar could pulse in different patterns and sweep rapidly or very slowly. The scanner is also KITT's most vulnerable area.\n\n;Etymotic Equalizer : This system allowed KITT to hear sound. An array of audio sensors was threaded throughout his interior and exterior.\n\n;Olfactory Sensor : KITT could \"smell\" via an atmospheric sampling device mounted in his front bumper.\n\n;Microscanners : Microscanners are tiny audio and visual sensors embedded into the grooves of KITT's body. They allow for visual tracking and display of anything around the car.\n\n;Cruise Modes : These are KITT's four drive modes:<br/>'''Normal Cruise''' \u2013 On \"Normal\", Michael has control of the car. In an emergency, KITT could still take over and activate Auto Cruise mode.<br/>'''Auto Cruise''' \u2013 In \"Auto\", KITT could drive himself utilizing an advanced Auto Collision Avoidance system.<br/>'''Pursuit''' \u2013 \"Pursuit\" is used during high-speed driving and is a combination of manual and computer assisted operation. KITT could respond to road conditions faster than Michael's reflexes could; however, Michael was technically in control of the vehicle and KITT helped guide certain maneuvers.<br/>'''Super pursuit''' \u2013 KITT's Super-Pursuit mode was added at the start of the fourth season. It was the result of a redesign of the car to integrate new concepts consisting of improved rocket boosters for enhanced acceleration, retractable spoilers for aerodynamic stability, and movable air inlets for increased cooling. Super-Pursuit Mode provided a 40% boost in speed beyond the car's original top speed of 300 MPH. First used in Episode 70, \"Knight of the Juggernaut, Part II\".\n\n;Silent Mode : KITT could run silently. The feature dampened his engine noise and allows him to sneak around. First used in Episode 37, \"White-Line Warriors\".\n\n;Grappling Hook and Winch : KITT has a hidden winch and grappling hook system, one mounted under his front bumper, and another in a compartment behind his tail light plate. Most often the hook is connected by a strong cable, but a metal arm has also been seen. The grappling hook is first used in Episode 6, \"Not a Drop to Drink\"; the winch is first used in Episode 13, \"Forget Me Not\".\n\n;Oil Jets/Smoke Screen : KITT could spray an oil slick and a plume of smoke from under the rear bumper. First used in Episode 1, \"Knight of the Phoenix\".\n\n;Induction coil : KITT has an induction coil he can produce from under his front bumper and that, being placed on a metal object, KITT can remotely induce electrical voltage or current in that object. This was used by Michael in \"Knight of the Drones (Part I)\" to electrify a fence in order to incapacitate and interrogate two thugs without seriously harming them.\n\n;Flame Thrower : KITT has flame throwers mounted under his bumpers. First used in Episode 2, \"Deadly Maneuvers\".\n\n;Tear Gas Launcher : KITT can dispense a cloud of tear gas along with his smoke screen. First used in Episode 13, \"Hearts of Stone\".\n\n;Ultramagnesium Charges : KITT can launch magnesium flares, which can also be used to divert heat-seeking missiles fired at him. First used in Episode 26, \"Merchants of Death\".\n\n;High Traction Drop Downs : When activated, the HTDD system hydraulically raises KITT's chassis for better traction when driving off-road. First used in Episode 39, \"Speed Demons\".\n\n;Telephone Comlink : Michael could contact home base and communicate with Devon and others using KITT's video display.\n\n;Microwave Jammer : KITT has an electronic jamming system that played havoc on electrical systems. The three main components are the Electromagnetic Field Generator, Electronic Field Disrupter and Microwave Ignition Sensor. The system could take control of electronic machines, allowing things like cheating at slot machines, breaking [[electronic lock]]s, fouling security cameras, and withdrawing money from ATMs. In Episode 26, \"Merchants of Death\" the Microwave Jammer's power has been increased 3 times than its normal strength, strong enough to bring down a helicopter, at a limited distance.\n\n;Microlock : KITT could lock the brakes of other vehicles. This system is believed to work by utilizing focused microwaves to heat the brake fluid, causing it to expand and apply the brakes of the car.\n\n;Surveillance Mode : Surveillance Mode did several things:<br/>KITT could detect people and vehicles and track their movements and discern proximity.<br/>KITT could gather structural schematics of buildings, vehicles, or other devices and help Michael avoid potential danger when he was snooping.<br/>KITT could also monitor radio transmissions and telephone communications within a location and trace those calls.<br/>KITT could tap into computer systems to monitor, or upload and download information as long as he could break the access codes.\n\n;Traction Spikes : Added in Episode 86 \"Hills of Fire\". KITT's tires produce spikes that allow KITT to overcome steep terrain.\n\n;Infrared Tracking Scope : KITT could monitor the position of specific vehicles in the area within 10 miles.\n\n;Laser Powerpack : KITT can fire a high powered ultra-frequency modulated laser capable of burning through steel plating. Like most of KITT's components, the schematics for the laser device are classified. First used in Episode 9, \"Trust Doesn't Rust\" and was used to try and destroy KARR by hitting KARR's only weak spot, however it never hit the mark due to miscalibration.\n\n;Bomb Sniffer : KITT is equipped with a bomb sniffer module that can detect explosives within a few yards of the vehicle. However the only downside is that if a building has steel beams in concrete it'll interfere the bomb sniffer. First used in Episode 25, \"Brother's Keeper\".\n\n;Medical scanner : KITT has a medical scanner that includes an [[Electrocardiography|electrocardiograph]] (ECG). The medical scanner can monitor the vital signs of individuals and display them on his monitors. It could indicate such conditions as if they were injured, poisoned, undergoing stress or other emotional behavior. KITT could even monitor Michael's physical activity through sensors inside the driver seat. First used in Episode 1, \"Knight of the Phoenix (Pt. 2)\".\n\n;Tintable Windows: KITT can tint the windshield and windows to become opaque. First seen in Episode 14, \"Give Me Liberty... or Give Me Death\".\n\n;Deflatable Tires : KITT could deflate and re-inflate his tires. First used in Episode 5 (first episode was actually 2 episodes), \"Slammin' Sammy's Stunt Show Spectacular\".\n\n;Fuel Processor : KITT was powered by a turbine engine primarily fueled by hydrogen gas. However, his complex fuel processor allows him to run on any combustible liquid, even regular gasoline. KITT's actual fuel requirements and efficiency ratings were classified, however in one episode, KITT mentioned his fuel economy was at least 65 miles per gallon. However, when operating on fuels other than liquid hydrogen, KITT's fuel efficiency and power output may be lowered.\n\n;Voice Stress Analyzer : KITT can process spoken voices and determine if someone may be lying. First used in Episode 26, \"Merchants of Death\".\n;Seat Ejection System : KITT had two front ejection seats, mostly used when Michael needed a boost to fire escapes or building roof tops. First used in Episode 1, \"Knight of the Phoenix (Pt. 1)\".\n\n;Passive Laser Restraint System : Added to KITT in later seasons, the restraint system helped protect Michael and any passengers from the shock of sudden impacts and hard stopping, especially after Super-Pursuit Mode. It is speculated that this is a primitive form of an [[Inertia negation|inertial damping]] device. First used in Episode 47, \"Knight of the Drones\".\n\n;Video Display Monitors : KITT had two [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] video display monitors on his dash for various readouts. They are controlled by two systems, the Graphic Translator (which sketches likenesses from verbal input) and the Anamorphic Equalizer (which gathered visual information from KITT's front scan bar) and microscanners. KITT only had one when his dash was redesigned for the show's third season.\n\n;Computer Print Out : KITT could print hard copies of data on a dashboard-mounted printer. First used in Episode 15, \"The Topaz Connection\".\n\n;Money Dispenser:KITT could give Michael money when he needed it. First used in Episode 59, \u201cKnight by a Nose\u201d.\n\n;Ultraphonic Chemical Analyzer : KITT has a retractable tray with an [[spectrometer|electron scanner]] that could analyze the chemical properties of various materials. It could even scan [[fingerprint]]s and read ballistic information off bullets and compare these with a police database. Aside from the scanning tray, the system could also analyze chemical information gathered from KITT's exterior sensors. First used in Episode 17, \"Chariot of Gold\".\n;Interior Oxygenator : KITT could release oxygen into his driver compartment and provide air to passengers if he was ever submerged in water or buried in earth. This is also used to overcome the effects of certain drugs. First used in Episode 5 (First episode was actually 2 episodes in one), \"Slammin' Sammy's Stunt Show Spectacular\".\n\n;Two-Wheel Ski Drive : The Ski Mode setting allowed KITT to \"[[Ski (driving stunt)|ski]]\" (driving up on two wheels). First used in Episode 1, \"Knight of the Phoenix\".\n\n;Third Stage Aquatic Synthesizer : With this system, KITT can [[Aquaplaning|hydroplane]], effectively \"driving\" on water, using his wheels and turbo system for propulsion. First used in Episode 28, \"Return to Cadiz\" but, later removed because it was now faulty at the end of the episode.\n\n;Emergency Braking System : The EBS slowed KITT down from Super-Pursuit speeds. It consisted of a forward braking booster and air panels that popped out to create air friction (air brakes). First used in Episode 70, \"Knight of the Juggernaut, Part II\".\n\n;Convertible Roof : Added fourth season, by pressing the \"C\" button on KITT's dash, Michael could bring the top down and KITT became a [[convertible]]. First used in Episode #70, \"Knight of the Juggernaut, Part II\".\n\nAn unknown number of these systems were designed at Stanford University (Episode 5, \"Just My Bill\"). KITT's total production cost was estimated at $11,400,000 in 1982 ($27,123,021.76 in 2013).{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The cost of subsequent equipment improvements and the installation of additional features since his activation have not been factored.\n\n===Other equipment===\n;Comlink: KITT is in constant contact with Michael via a two-way communication wristwatch (a modified '80s LCD AM radio watch) Michael wore. The watch also had a micro camera and scanner that KITT could access to gather information.\n\n;Homing Device: In dire emergency, Michael can activate a secret homing beacon hidden inside a gold pendant he wears around his neck. The beacon sends a priority signal that can remotely activate KITT and override his programming so that he rushes to Michael's aid. Used in Episode 42, \"A Good Knight's Work\" and in \"Knights of the Fast Lane\".\n\n[[Image:FLAGMobileUnit01.jpg|thumb|F.L.A.G. Mobile Command Center with Aerodynamic Sleeping Cab]]\n;F.L.A.G. Mobile Command Center (The Semi) : KITT has access to a mobile \"garage\", which was a [[semi-trailer truck]] owned by the Foundation. In most episodes, it is a [[GMC General]]. The trailer has an extendable ramp that dropped down and allows KITT to drive inside even when the truck is in motion. The trailer was loaded with spare parts and equipment for KITT. It also had a computer lab where technicians Bonnie or April would work and conduct repairs and maintenance while in transit. In \"Wrong Crowd\" thieves hijack the truck thinking it to be hauling liquor. In the episode \"Ten Wheel Trouble\", following an assassination attempt on Michael which damages an independent truck, it is used to transport a shipment of onions. In the episode \"Knight Moves\", it is used as bait to catch a gang of truck hijackers. In \"KITTnap\", KITT is kidnapped and Michael and RC3 use the tractor (which has been disconnected from the trailer) to go and find him.\n\n===Notes===\n* KITT's scanner is similar to that of [[Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)|Cylon]]s from the science fiction series ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]''. [[Glen A. Larson]], the creator of both ''Knight Rider'' and ''Battlestar Galactica'' has stated that the two shows have nothing else in common and to remove any fan speculation, he stated in the Season One ''Knight Rider'' DVD audio-comments, he simply reused the scanning light for KITT because he liked the effect.\n* KITT was designed by customizer Michael Scheffe.<ref>[http://www.carlustblog.com/2014/09/the-knight-industries-two-thousand-kitt-behind-the-scanner.html The Knight Industries Two Thousand \u2013 K.I.T.T.- Behind the Scanner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620163807/http://www.carlustblog.com/2014/09/the-knight-industries-two-thousand-kitt-behind-the-scanner.html |date=June 20, 2015 }} carlustblog.com</ref> The convertible and super-pursuit KITTs were designed and built by [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]].\n* A total of 23 KITT cars were made for use in filming the series. All except one of these cars survived until the show was axed; all except 5 of the remaining 22 cars were destroyed at the end of filming. Of the 5 that escaped that fate: 1 'hero' car was shipped to a theme park in Australia, but is now believed to be back in the US (whereabouts unknown); Universal kept one 'hero' car and one stunt car (and had a further replica made later) for use in the Entertainment Center display \u2013 the two originals have since been sold to a private collector in the US; another, a convertible, disappeared for a while before being sold to the former [[Cars of the Stars Motor Museum]] in [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]], Cumbria, England<ref name=\"kitt-r8\"/> This convertible was sold to the Dezer Collection, [[Miami]], [[Florida]] when Cars of the Stars closed.

For example: in April 4, 2007, \"one of the four KITT cars used in production of the television series\" was reputedly being put up for sale for $149,995 by Johnny Verhoek of Kassabian Motors, Dublin, California.<ref name=\"kitt-r9\"/><ref name=\"kitt-r10\"/>  And a story in ''USA Today'' from December 2007 states that Slain real estate developer and car aficionado, Andrew Kissel, was in possession of one of the surviving cars. Some reports say that Michael Jackson bought an original KITT and former N'Sync band member Joey Fatone also claims to have purchased one of these authentic original KITTs at auction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20160902,00.html|title=Comeback Kid at Heart|publisher=}}</ref> There have been more 'original' cars auctioned than were built in total for the show.\n* The September 25, 2014 fifth episode of the Dutch TV programme ''Syndroom'', featuring people with [[Down syndrome]] who wish to fulfill a dream, features Twan Vermeulen, a ''Knight Rider'' fan who wishes to meet David Hasselhoff and KITT. Together with the show's presenter they fly to L.A. and go searching for Hasselhoff's house. They \"find\" Hasselhoff on the driveway in front of his house, dusting off KITT. After KITT speaks a personal message to Twan, Hasselhoff offers to go with him to take KITT for a spin, \"Freak out some people on the freeway\", which they did with great pleasure for everyone involved.<ref>Guerrero, Danger (September 26, 2014).

The KITT platform is patterned on a [[Shelby Mustang#2008\u20132009 GT500KR|Shelby GT500KR]] and differs from the original Two Thousand unit in several ways. For example, the 2008 KITT utilizes nano-technology, allowing the car's outer shell to change colors and morph itself into similar forms temporarily.<ref name=\"kitt-r4\"/> The nanotech platform is written as needing the AI active in order to produce any of these effects, unlike the original car's gadgets and \"molecular bonded shell\" which allowed it to endure extreme impacts. These down-sides to the use of nanotech have been demonstrated when villains are able to cause significant damage, such as shooting out windows, when the AI is deactivated. It can also turn into two different types of a [[Ford F-Series|Ford F-150]] 4x4 truck (one completely stock and the other with some modifications), a [[Ford E-Series|Ford E-150]] van, a [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor]], a special edition Warriors In Pink Mustang (in support of breast cancer awareness month), and a [[Ford Flex]] for disguise or to use the alternate modes' capabilities (such as off-road handling). The car can engage an \"Attack Mode\", featuring scissor/conventional hybrid doors, which allows it to increase speed and use most of its gadgets (including turbo boost). It had a different looking attack mode in the pilot which was used whenever the car needed to increase speed. Its downside however is that it only seats two. KITT is also capable of functioning submerged, maintaining life support and system integrity while underwater.\n\nWhile the original series stated the original KITT was designed by Wilton Knight, the 2008 TV movie implies Charles Graiman may have co-designed the car and the AI for Wilton Knight, was subsequently relocated to protect him and his family, and later designed the Knight Industries Three Thousand. KITT's weapons include a grappling hook located in the front bumper, usable in normal and attack modes, and missile launchers usable only in attack mode, which were first used in \"Knight of the Hunter\". In the Halloween episode \"Knight of the Living Dead\", KITT demonstrates the ability to cosmetically alter his appearance, becoming a black Mustang convertible with a pink trim as a Halloween costume. This configuration had the scanner bar relocated to behind the grille. Dr. Graiman also reveals in this episode that a backup neural network exists when he suggests downloading KITT's files and reuploading them to the backup, to which replies \"The Backup is not me.\" In the pilot, KITT had shown himself capable of similarly altering his external appearance\u2014changing his color and licence plate. In \"Knight of the Zodiac\", KITT uses a dispenser located in his undercarriage to spread [[black ice]], and a fingerprint generator in the glovebox to overlay the fingerprints of a captured thief over Mike's.\n\n===Features===\n{{in-universe|date=March 2013}}\n;Backup Mainframe Processor: If the Knight Industries Three Thousand detects a fault or damage with his microprocessor, he carries a backup which can be mounted in the field automatically.\n\n;Windshield Projection: Used in place of the centre console screen in the Pilot. The entire front windshield is able to display information as well as the video communication link with the SSC.\n\n;Bio Matrix Scanner: Used to detect the health status of people nearby.\n\n;Nanotech Skin: This replaces the Molecular Bonded Shell from the original series. Unlike [[#KITT (Knight Industries Two Thousand)|KITT's former incarnation]] of an impregnable outer shell of the vehicle with a nearly indestructible polymer, Knight Industries Three Thousand are a series of nano-machines that create the car's outer shell (a 2008 Ford Mustang GT500KR) and a second \"skin\" in whereupon detection of any damage will instantly repair the affected area. When Knight Industries Three Thousand is deactivated, the nano repair system is also disabled, making his basic nano-tech shell susceptible to physical damage. The second \"skin\" can affect KITT's outer shell as well, allowing KITT to disguise himself by transforming into various similar sized machinery.\n\n;Turbo Boost: A power injector system that provides large bursts of power to allow KITT to jump over obstacles. This ability along with directional exhaust outlets allows KITT to jump from a standstill or at high speed.\n\n;Hood Surface Screen: Similar to the projection windshield, this allows KITT to display data on exterior hood for outside briefings or with other parties.\n\n;Offensive missiles: (Used in conjunction with attack mode): two tube-launched missiles that retract from each door.\n\n;Gatling guns: (Again, used in conjunction with attack mode): two gatling-style guns that are retracted from the hood. Seen in season 1 episode 15, \"Fly By Knight\". In episode 16, \"Knight and the City\", KITT deploys a single machine gun while in regular mode. In this episode, KITT also indicates that he would run out of ammunition in 7 seconds and that he would expend 8,000 rounds in that timespan, which means that KITT's gatling guns have an approximate rate of fire of 1,143 rounds per second, over ten times higher than that of a regular [[minigun]].\n\n;Laser: A [[directed energy]] device capable of destroying locks and other items, projected from scanner bar.\n\n;EMP: An electromagnetic pulse projector, which allows disabling of any electronic circuit or device within the given area. First seen in Episode 8, \"Knight of the Zodiac\".\n\n;Anti-Missile Flares: Deployed from rear bumper. Disk-like objects that when dispensed produce an intense heat source to deter heat-seeking projectiles.\n\n;Anti-Traction Compound Dispenser: (Known as Black Ice): An exterior dispenser that can eject a liquid, making the targeted surface tractionless.\n\n;Interior tear gas dispenser: Used for anti-theft and defensive purposes. KITT can fill the car's cabin with tear gas to incapacitate a would-be thief as seen in Episode 7, \"I Wanna Rock & Roll All Knight\".\n\n;Ski Mode: With help of the Turbo boost left power injector system to gain impulse for make KITT drivable on two wheels. First seen in episode 12 \"Knight to King's Pawn\".\n\n;3D Object Printer: A device that allows for the creation of small 3-D objects (such as keys) based on available electronic data.\n\n;Printer: Standard printer used for documents and incoming faxes. Located in the passenger side dash.\n\n;Fingerprint Overlay Printer: A device accessible via the glove box that allows KITT to scan fingerprints from an inserted object and overlay then onto another person's hand.\n\n;Weapons Cache: Small arms cache accessible via the glove box area that usually contains two 9mm handguns with extra magazines for occupant's protection outside KITT.\n\n;First Aid: Accessible via glove box. Allows for field mending of physical wounds such as lost appendages.\n\n;Self-Destruct: A software program secretly built into KITT that, when activated by the SSC, turns KITT into a bomb using his fuel as the charge and his computer as the detonator.\n\n;Earwig: Small ear piece used to communicate with KITT at a limited distance.\n\n===Transformation abilities===\n;Attack Mode: KITT's original Attack mode was purely used to increase speeds. It was changed after the [[Knight Rider (2008 film)|pilot]].\n\n;Attack Mode II: Similar to the original KITT's alternate configuration to allow faster traveling speeds. First seen in Episode 1, \"A Knight in Shining Armor\".\n\n;Ford F-150 FX4: Alternate mode for off-road travel. Also has ability to allow quick ingress at speed. Scanner bar is located in the grill at the very top of the inlet. First seen in Episode 1, \"A Knight in Shining Armor\".\n\n;Ford F-150 II: After \"Knight of the Hunter\", an alternate F-150 mode, which has extra off-road modifications.\n\n;Ford E-150 Cargo Van: For disguise purposes. All doors are fully functional. Scanner bar is not shown. As seen in Episode 4, \"A Hard Day's Knight\".\n\n;Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor: For disguise purposes, used to elude police. KITT's presence indicator (Orb) is displayed on the MDT screen rather than a separate entity on the dash. In this configuration, KITT's scanner bar is hidden behind the top of the frame around the front grille. As seen in Episode 4, \"A Hard Day's Knight\".\n\n;Ford Mustang GT: As seen on the pilot film. KITT converted into a silver Mustang en route to Las Vegas. He also transformed into a purple Mustang to help Michael and Sarah in their escape in Vegas.\n\n;Ford Mustang Convertible: (Warriors in Pink Edition): A disguise that was used for the Halloween episode \"Knight of the Living Dead\", Episode 6. Basically a standard Mustang convertible with pink trim and aftermarket wheels, and the breast cancer logo under the mustang symbols. The scanner bar is located behind the front grille.\n\n;Ford Flex: For disguise purposes. A customized version with metallic gray paint and taillight blackouts; the scanner bar is located in the lower bumper intake grille. In this configuration, access to some systems, such as his laser and EMP, are available. As seen in Episode 8, \"Knight of the Zodiac\".\n\n;1969 Ford Mustang Mach 1: For disguise purposes. A dark blue classic with the scanner located in the grille. As seen in the episode \"Fly By Knight\" when a DEA agent had an [[all-points bulletin]] on Mike and KITT. (\"Shall we go old school?\")\n\n===KARR redesign===\n:''See'' [[KARR (Knight Rider)#KARR 2.0 in Knight Rider 2008\u20132009|KARR (Knight Rider)]]\n\nKARR (Peter Cullen, later Paul Frees) was the original prototype of the first KITT (Knight Industries Two Thousand) but to mirror the pattern of the original series, the nemesis and prototype of the second KITT (Knight Industries Three Thousand) is also designated as KARR in the new series. KARR is apparently a new evil twin character just like the Knight 3000, and the acronym now stands for '''Knight Auto-Cybernetic Roving Robotic-Exoskeleton'''.\n\nKARR's visual identity has also had similar changes for the new series. KARR was originally designed for military combat. KARR has the ability to transform from vehicle mode into a large wheeled robotic exoskeleton like a Transformer Decepticon instead of KITTs \"Attack Mode\". The vehicle mode of KARR is a 2008\u20132009 Shelby GT500KR with the license plate initials K.R. KARR is once again voiced by [[Peter Cullen]], who also voiced the first appearance of KARR Knight Automated Roving Robot in \"Trust Doesn't Rust\". The transformation sequence is very similar to that in the 2007 \"Transformers\" live action film. Armed with twin machine guns on each shoulder and missiles, the exoskeleton combines with a human being for easier control. After a brief brawl, KITT uses the grappling hook to tear off KARR's chest plate, freeing one of Michael's co-workers, Alex Torres. Michael rams KITT through KARR's torso using Turbo Boost, apparently destroying KARR. It is unclear if KARR had the same nano repair function as KITT, nor if his A.I. unit survived. KARR is visually identical to KITT in this iteration, lacking the two tone black and silver paint job of the 80s version. The only difference is the scanner and voice box, which are yellow compared to KITT's red.\n\n==Knight Industries Four Thousand (Knight 4000){{anchor|Knight 4000}}==\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #DEDEE2\n| name        = Knight 4000\n| image       = Knight4000a.jpg\n| caption     = Screenshot of the Knight 4000 in the FLAG laboratory\n| first       = [[Knight Rider 2000]]\n| creator     = [[Glen A.

The vehicle had numerous 21st Century technological improvements over the previous 1980s version of KITT, such as an advanced amphibious mode (which allows the car to ride on water like a speedboat), a [[virtual reality]] [[heads-up display]] (or VR-HUD, which utilized the entire windshield as a video display), and a microwave stun device that could remotely incapacitate a human target. However, no acknowledgement is made to this spin-off in the 2008 series.\n\n===Features===\n{{in-universe|date=March 2013}}\nThe Knight 4000 has most of KITT's original features, including a few new and improved systems<ref name=\"kitt-r2\"/>\n\n;Virtual Reality Heads-up Display : Rather than dash-mounted [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] displays, the Knight 4000 uses a virtual reality heads-up display employing the entire windshield as video monitor.\n;Thermal Expander : The Knight 4000 was equipped with an offensive weapon which consisted of a microwave projector that caused the temperatures of targeted objects to quickly rise and either ignite or explode.\n;Remote Target Assist : This allows the pilot aim and fire with a complete and perfect accuracy via the Knight 4000's help.\n;Amphibious Mode : The Knight 4000 can float and maneuver on water much like a boat. The system was actually a major improvement over KITT's original hydroplane ability which during the original series was prone to malfunctions during its experimental phase.\n;Microwave Stunner : Similar to the \u201cnon-lethal\u201d sidearms used by the police, the Knight 4000 was equipped with a microwave stunner that could incapacitate criminals.\n;Voice Activated Controls : The Knight 4000's dashboard is less \"cluttered looking\" than KITT's original dash with most of the controls now being completely voice activated rather than having to push a button.\n;Fax Machine : The Knight 4000 could print out faxed messages from a dash mounted printer.\n;Infrared Scanner : The Infrared Scanner was a device with which the Knight 4000 could scan on an Infrared level, which would identify laser scope rifles as well as hidden objects giving off heat.\n;Aroma Monitor : This system is similar to the Knight 2000's Olfactory Scan, but is much more complex.\n;Voice Sampler : Similar to the Knight 2000's Anharmonic Synthesizer, this device could simulate any voice which has been recorded into the Knight 4000's memory.\n;Thermal Sensor : This system allows the Knight 4000 to watch and record what is happening in a particular place, such as inside a vehicle.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pontiac Firebird|Pontiac Trans Am]]\n*[[Shelby Mustang#1967 Shelby GT350 / GT500|Shelby Mustang]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"kitt-r1\">Mentioned in \"Goliath Returns\" when KITT talks to Dr. Bergstrom.</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"kitt-r2\">{{cite web |url=http://kr2k.com/faq.html#4 |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Knight Rider 2000 Online |accessdate=February 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713170419/http://kr2k.com/faq.html#4 |archivedate=July 13, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"kitt-r3\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jayohrberg.com/Knight_Rider_2000.html |title=Knight Rider 2000 |publisher=Jay Ohrberg's Hollywood Cars |accessdate=February 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"kitt-r4\">{{cite news |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/automotive/new_cars/4237588.html |title=Under the Hood With Knight Rider 2.0: Trans Am vs. Ford Mustang (Featuring Exclusive New KITT Specs\u2014and Classic Hasselhoff!) |work=[[Popular Mechanics]] |date=December 20, 2007 |accessdate=December 28, 2007 |last=Tannert |first=Chuck |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113193046/http://www.popularmechanics.com/automotive/new_cars/4237588.html |archivedate=January 13, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n<!-- <ref name=\"kitt-r5\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.stangnet.com/Ford-Mustang-News/2008-Shelby-GT500KR-070330.html |title=2008 Shelby GT500KR&nbsp;\u2014 King of the Road |accessdate=March 1, 2008 |work=www.stangnet.com |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080206205629/http://www.stangnet.com/Ford-Mustang-News/2008-Shelby-GT500KR-070330.html  |archivedate = February 6, 2008}}</ref> -->\n\n<ref name=\"kitt-r6\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn3-O17f4tg |title=Knight Rider Stripper |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=February 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"kitt-r8\">{{cite web |url=http://www.carsofthestars.com/cott3_6.html |title=Television Cars \u2013 Page 6 \u2013 KITT from Knightrider |publisher=Cars of the Stars |accessdate=February 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204071902/http://www.carsofthestars.com/cott3_6.html |archivedate=February 4, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"kitt-r9\">{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/for-sale-talking-car-one-lessthancareful-owner-443264.html |title=For sale: Talking car, one less-than-careful owner |date=April 4, 2007 |publisher=The Independent |last=Buncombe |first=Andrew |accessdate=February 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"kitt-r10\">{{cite web |url=http://www.myhotcars.com/used-cars.php?id=7c44e23b5881c433255586352de178d1 |title=1982 PONTIAC KNIGHT RIDER K.I.T.T.

While having the same acronym, the KITTs are two different entities: one known as the '''Knight Industries Two Thousand''', which appeared in the original TV series ''Knight Rider'', and the other as the '''Knight Industries Three Thousand''', which appeared first in the two-hour 2008 [[Knight Rider (2008 film)|pilot film]] for a new ''Knight Rider'' TV series and then the [[Knight Rider (2008 TV series)|new series]] itself. In both instances, KITT is an artificially intelligent electronic computer module in the body of a highly advanced, very mobile, robotic automobile: the original KITT as a 1982 [[Pontiac Firebird#Third generation (1982\u20131992)|Pontiac Firebird Trans Am]], and the second KITT as a [[Shelby Mustang#2008\u20132009 GT500KR|2008\u20132009 Ford Shelby GT500KR]]. KITT was voiced by [[William Daniels]] in the original series, and by [[Val Kilmer]] in the 2008 series. KITT's evil twin is [[KARR (Knight Rider)|KARR]] which is an acronym of Knight Automated Roving Robot.  KARR was voiced by both [[Peter Cullen]] and [[Paul Frees]] in season one and season three of the NBC original TV series respectively in Knight Rider.\n\nA 1991 sequel film ''[[Knight Rider 2000]]'' saw KITT's original microprocessor unit transferred into the body of the vehicle intended to be his successor, the Knight Industries Four Thousand (Knight 4000), voiced by [[Carmen Argenziano]] and [[William Daniels]].\n\n==Knight Industries Two Thousand (KITT)==\n{{Infobox character\n|colour      = #DEDEE5\n|name        = Knight Industries Two Thousand\n|series      = [[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]\n|image       = [[File:KITT at Universal Studios, original uncropped version.jpg|300px]]\n|caption     = KITT on display at [[Universal Studios]] in 1993.

The 2008 [[Knight Rider (2008 film)|pilot movie]] later implied that Charles Graiman, creator of the Knight Industries Three Thousand, also had a hand in designing the first KITT.\n\nAccording to the series, the original KITT's main cybernetic processor was first installed in a [[mainframe computer]] used by the US government in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=\"kitt-r1\"/> However, Wilton saw better use for \"him\" in the Foundation's crime-fighting crusade and eventually the system was installed in the vehicle. KITT was in fact the second vehicle built by Knight Industries with [[artificial intelligence]]. His predecessor was [[KARR (Knight Rider)|KARR]], the ''Knight Automated Roving Robot''. KARR was programmed for self-preservation, but this proved to be dangerous to the Foundation's humanitarian interests. KARR was later deactivated and placed in storage while KITT was given to his new operator, [[Michael Knight (Knight Rider)|Michael Knight]]. KARR was later unwittingly reactivated by thieves in the original episode \"[[KARR (Knight Rider)#\"Trust Doesn't Rust\" \u2013 Season 1, Episode 9|Trust Doesn't Rust]]\", was thought destroyed, then reappeared in the episode \"[[KARR (Knight Rider)#Appearances in the original series|K.I.T.T. vs. K.A.R.R]]\" and was seen to be finally destroyed by Michael and KITT.\n\nWhile the 2008 [[Knight Rider (2008 film)|pilot movie]] and then the [[Knight Rider (2008 TV series)|new series]] appears to be a revamp of the original series, it offers some continuity from the original TV series. The \"new\" or \"second\" KITT (Knight Industries Three Thousand) is a different vehicle and microprocessor unit. The original Knight Industries Two Thousand is also shown in the [[Knight Rider (2008 film)|pilot movie]] (although in pieces) in the scene where the garage of Charles Graiman (creator of the Knight Industries Three Thousand and implied co-designer of the original KITT) is searched by antagonists. A Trans-Am body (without its hood) is partially covered by a tarp, on which rests the rear spoiler. The famous KITT steering wheel (labelled \"Knight Two Thousand\") and \"KNIGHT\" license plate are also shown, along with numerous black car body parts. When the camera shows a full scene of the garage, there are three cars in the garage: the 3000, a 2000 under a tarp, and a complete 2000.\n\nThe 1991 movie ''[[Knight Rider 2000]]'' saw the first KITT (Knight Industries Two Thousand) in pieces, and [[Michael Knight (Knight Rider)|Michael Knight]] himself reviving the microprocessor unit, which is eventually transferred into the body of the vehicle intended to be the original KITT's direct successor, the Knight 4000. The new vehicle was a modified 1991 [[Mitsubishi GTO|Dodge Stealth]], appearing similar to the [[Pontiac Banshee]] prototype. However, no reference to this storyline nor any appearance of the Knight 4000 is made in the [[Knight Rider (2008 TV series)|new series]] or its 2008 [[Knight Rider (2008 film)|pilot movie]]. In ''Knight Rider 2000'', it is stated that most of the Knight 2000 parts had been sold off. However, Graiman's garage in the 2008 pilot shows a more complete collection of parts than in the boxes recovered by Michael Knight in ''Knight Rider 2000''. This adds to the mystique of the current whereabouts of the original KITT in the time-frame of the new series.\n\nIn the 1997\u20131998 spin-off series ''[[Team Knight Rider]]'', KITT is employed as a shadow advisor. It is later revealed that \"The Shadow\" is actually a hologram run by KITT. In \"Knight of the Living Dead\", Graiman states a third KITT exists as a backup. When KITT is about to die, his memories are downloaded so the third KITT can use them. However, in the end the third AI is not used.\n\n===Features===\n{{in-universe|date=March 2013}}\nThe front-mounted scanner bar that, among other things, allowed KITT to see was a nod to the [[Cylon (1978)|Cylons]], villains from the TV series ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', which had been created by [[Glen A. Larson]], who also created ''Knight Rider'' and even used the iconic Cyclon eye scanner audio to that effect.<ref>{{cite web |last1=JUDE |first1=TAMARA |title=16 Things You Didn't Know About Battlestar Galactica |url=https://screenrant.com/battlestar-galactica-tv-show-movie-trivia-facts/ |website=Screenrant |accessdate=July 12, 2019|date=March 2017 }}</ref>\n\nA refit in the 1985\u201386 season included the addition of \"Super Pursuit Mode\" and a convertible top.\n\n;Computer AI : KITT is essentially an advanced [[supercomputer]] on wheels. The \"brain\" of KITT is the Knight 2000 [[microprocessor]] which is the centre of a \"[[Self-awareness|self-aware]]\" [[Cybernetics|cybernetic]] logic module that allowed KITT to think, learn, communicate and interact with humans. He is also capable of independent thought and action. He always had an ego that was easy to bruise and displayed a very sensitive, but kind and dryly humorous personality. He also has an in-dash entertainment system that can play music and video, and run various computer programs including [[arcade game]]s which Michael sometimes indulged in while KITT was driving. According to Episode 55, \"Dead of Knight\", KITT has 1,000 [[megabit]]s of memory with one [[nanosecond]] [[access time]]. According to Episode 65, \"Ten Wheel Trouble\", KITT's future capacity is unlimited. KITT's serial number is AD227529, as mentioned in Episode 31, \"Soul Survivor\".\n\n;Alpha Circuit : KITT's \"Alpha Circuit\" is part of KITT's main control system which allows the CPU to drive the car. The time KITT's \"evil twin\" [[Knight Automated Roving Robot|KARR]] spent submerged in water damaged his Alpha Circuit, which required KARR to have an operator to control his Turbo Boost function.\n\n;Molecular Bonded Shell : KITT is armored with \"Tri-Helical Plasteel 1000 MBS\" (Molecular Bonded Shell) plating which protects him from almost all forms of conventional firearms and explosive devices. He could only be harmed by heavy artillery and rockets, and even then, the blast usually left most of his body intact and only damaged internal components. The shell protected every part of the car including the tires. As a result, KITT's body is durable enough to act as a shield for explosives by driving over bombs to cover them and suppress the blast, ram through rigid barriers of strong material like cinder block walls or steel gates without suffering damage himself while damage to the car's structural integrity with its frequent long jumps on turbo boost is never an issue. The shell also protected him from fire and electricity; however, it was vulnerable to some potent acids and at least one formula was made (with knowledge of the shell's chemical base) to partially neutralize it. The shell is actually a combination of three secret substances referred together as the \"Knight Compound\", developed by Wilton Knight who entrusted parts of the formula to three separate people. These individuals each only know two pieces of the formula, ensuring that any two of them could make more of the Knight Compound in an emergency situation and that no one person would be able to make it alone. The shell provided a frame tolerance of 223,000&nbsp;lb (111.5 tons) and a front and rear axle suspension load of 57,000&nbsp;lb (28.5 tons). In the pilot \"Knight of the Phoenix\", the shell is described as the panels of the car itself; in the later episodes, especially from season two onward, the idea of the shell being applied to a base vehicle chemically is used.\n\n;[[Pyroclastic rock|Pyroclastic]] Lamination : KITT is protected by a thermal-resistant coating that can withstand sustained temperatures of up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit (426&nbsp;\u00b0C). First used in Episode 32, \"Ring of Fire\".\n\n;Power System : KITT is powered by the Knight Industries [[turbojet]] with modified [[afterburner]]s and a computer controlled 8-speed turbodrive transmission. Specifications 0\u201360&nbsp;mph in 2 seconds (1.37g), standing to quarter mile 4.286 seconds. Electromagnetic hyper-vacuum disc brakes: 14 foot (4.25&nbsp;m) braking distance (70\u20130&nbsp;mph \u2013 112\u20130&nbsp;km/h - 11.7g).\n[[File:Modulador_de_voz_kitt_11-4-2020.png|thumb|KITT and KARR Voice Modulator]]\n[[File:KITT Interior at Toronto Auto Show 2011.jpg|thumb|KITT instrumentation (1st/2nd seasons)]]\n[[File:Knight Rider Supercar KITT instrumentation.jpg|thumb|KITT instrumentation (3rd/4th seasons)]]\n\n;Turbo Boost : Used in most episodes, a pair of rocket boosters mounted just behind the front tires that lifted the car, allowing KITT to jump into the air and pass over obstacles in the road. Also, occasionally, Turbo Boost was used to allow KITT to accelerate to incredible speeds in excess of 200&nbsp;mph (322&nbsp;km/h). The boosters could fire forward or backward.\n\n;Voice (Anharmonic) Synthesizer : KITT's Voice Synthesizer allowed his logic module to speak and communicate. With it, KITT could also simulate other sounds. KITT's primary spoken language was English; however by accessing his language module, he could speak fluently in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]] and much more. The module can be adjusted giving KITT different [[accent (dialect)|accent]]s such as in Episode 82, \"Out of the Woods\", where KITT uses a \"New York City\" accent and called Michael, \"Micky\". During the first season, KITT's \"mouth\" (\"Voice Modulator\") in the interior of the vehicle was a flashing red square. In episode 14 \"Heart of Stone\", this was changed to three sectioned vertical bars, as this design proved popular with fans as part of KARR. (KARR used a bright yellow display with an inner bar that expanded outward and two outer bars that expanded from both ends inward, whereas KITT's was red and all three bars expanded outward from the center, but with greater magnitude in the center bar.)\n\n;Voice Projection: KITT can project his voice at any position. First used in Episode 48, \"Knight of the Drones, Pt. 2\".\n\n;Anamorphic Equalizer : KITT's most apparent feature was his front scan bar called the Anamorphic Equalizer. The device is a [[Optical fiber|fibre-optic]] array of electronic eyes. The scanner could see in all visual [[wavelength]]s as well as [[X-ray]] and [[infrared]]. Occasionally, the bar could pulse in different patterns and sweep rapidly or very slowly. The scanner is also KITT's most vulnerable area.\n\n;Etymotic Equalizer : This system allowed KITT to hear sound. An array of audio sensors was threaded throughout his interior and exterior.\n\n;Olfactory Sensor : KITT could \"smell\" via an atmospheric sampling device mounted in his front bumper.\n\n;Microscanners : Microscanners are tiny audio and visual sensors embedded into the grooves of KITT's body. They allow for visual tracking and display of anything around the car.\n\n;Cruise Modes : These are KITT's four drive modes:<br/>'''Normal Cruise''' \u2013 On \"Normal\", Michael has control of the car. In an emergency, KITT could still take over and activate Auto Cruise mode.<br/>'''Auto Cruise''' \u2013 In \"Auto\", KITT could drive himself utilizing an advanced Auto Collision Avoidance system.<br/>'''Pursuit''' \u2013 \"Pursuit\" is used during high-speed driving and is a combination of manual and computer assisted operation. KITT could respond to road conditions faster than Michael's reflexes could; however, Michael was technically in control of the vehicle and KITT helped guide certain maneuvers.<br/>'''Super pursuit''' \u2013 KITT's Super-Pursuit mode was added at the start of the fourth season. It was the result of a redesign of the car to integrate new concepts consisting of improved rocket boosters for enhanced acceleration, retractable spoilers for aerodynamic stability, and movable air inlets for increased cooling. Super-Pursuit Mode provided a 40% boost in speed beyond the car's original top speed of 300 MPH. First used in Episode 70, \"Knight of the Juggernaut, Part II\".\n\n;Silent Mode : KITT could run silently. The feature dampened his engine noise and allows him to sneak around. First used in Episode 37, \"White-Line Warriors\".\n\n;Grappling Hook and Winch : KITT has a hidden winch and grappling hook system, one mounted under his front bumper, and another in a compartment behind his tail light plate. Most often the hook is connected by a strong cable, but a metal arm has also been seen. The grappling hook is first used in Episode 6, \"Not a Drop to Drink\"; the winch is first used in Episode 13, \"Forget Me Not\".\n\n;Oil Jets/Smoke Screen : KITT could spray an oil slick and a plume of smoke from under the rear bumper. First used in Episode 1, \"Knight of the Phoenix\".\n\n;Induction coil : KITT has an induction coil he can produce from under his front bumper and that, being placed on a metal object, KITT can remotely induce electrical voltage or current in that object. This was used by Michael in \"Knight of the Drones (Part I)\" to electrify a fence in order to incapacitate and interrogate two thugs without seriously harming them.\n\n;Flame Thrower : KITT has flame throwers mounted under his bumpers. First used in Episode 2, \"Deadly Maneuvers\".\n\n;Tear Gas Launcher : KITT can dispense a cloud of tear gas along with his smoke screen. First used in Episode 13, \"Hearts of Stone\".\n\n;Ultramagnesium Charges : KITT can launch magnesium flares, which can also be used to divert heat-seeking missiles fired at him. First used in Episode 26, \"Merchants of Death\".\n\n;High Traction Drop Downs : When activated, the HTDD system hydraulically raises KITT's chassis for better traction when driving off-road. First used in Episode 39, \"Speed Demons\".\n\n;Telephone Comlink : Michael could contact home base and communicate with Devon and others using KITT's video display.\n\n;Microwave Jammer : KITT has an electronic jamming system that played havoc on electrical systems. The three main components are the Electromagnetic Field Generator, Electronic Field Disrupter and Microwave Ignition Sensor. The system could take control of electronic machines, allowing things like cheating at slot machines, breaking [[electronic lock]]s, fouling security cameras, and withdrawing money from ATMs. In Episode 26, \"Merchants of Death\" the Microwave Jammer's power has been increased 3 times than its normal strength, strong enough to bring down a helicopter, at a limited distance.\n\n;Microlock : KITT could lock the brakes of other vehicles. This system is believed to work by utilizing focused microwaves to heat the brake fluid, causing it to expand and apply the brakes of the car.\n\n;Surveillance Mode : Surveillance Mode did several things:<br/>KITT could detect people and vehicles and track their movements and discern proximity.<br/>KITT could gather structural schematics of buildings, vehicles, or other devices and help Michael avoid potential danger when he was snooping.<br/>KITT could also monitor radio transmissions and telephone communications within a location and trace those calls.<br/>KITT could tap into computer systems to monitor, or upload and download information as long as he could break the access codes.\n\n;Traction Spikes : Added in Episode 86 \"Hills of Fire\". KITT's tires produce spikes that allow KITT to overcome steep terrain.\n\n;Infrared Tracking Scope : KITT could monitor the position of specific vehicles in the area within 10 miles.\n\n;Laser Powerpack : KITT can fire a high powered ultra-frequency modulated laser capable of burning through steel plating. Like most of KITT's components, the schematics for the laser device are classified. First used in Episode 9, \"Trust Doesn't Rust\" and was used to try and destroy KARR by hitting KARR's only weak spot, however it never hit the mark due to miscalibration.\n\n;Bomb Sniffer : KITT is equipped with a bomb sniffer module that can detect explosives within a few yards of the vehicle. However the only downside is that if a building has steel beams in concrete it'll interfere the bomb sniffer. First used in Episode 25, \"Brother's Keeper\".\n\n;Medical scanner : KITT has a medical scanner that includes an [[Electrocardiography|electrocardiograph]] (ECG). The medical scanner can monitor the vital signs of individuals and display them on his monitors. It could indicate such conditions as if they were injured, poisoned, undergoing stress or other emotional behavior. KITT could even monitor Michael's physical activity through sensors inside the driver seat. First used in Episode 1, \"Knight of the Phoenix (Pt. 2)\".\n\n;Tintable Windows: KITT can tint the windshield and windows to become opaque. First seen in Episode 14, \"Give Me Liberty... or Give Me Death\".\n\n;Deflatable Tires : KITT could deflate and re-inflate his tires. First used in Episode 5 (first episode was actually 2 episodes), \"Slammin' Sammy's Stunt Show Spectacular\".\n\n;Fuel Processor : KITT was powered by a turbine engine primarily fueled by hydrogen gas. However, his complex fuel processor allows him to run on any combustible liquid, even regular gasoline. KITT's actual fuel requirements and efficiency ratings were classified, however in one episode, KITT mentioned his fuel economy was at least 65 miles per gallon. However, when operating on fuels other than liquid hydrogen, KITT's fuel efficiency and power output may be lowered.\n\n;Voice Stress Analyzer : KITT can process spoken voices and determine if someone may be lying. First used in Episode 26, \"Merchants of Death\".\n;Seat Ejection System : KITT had two front ejection seats, mostly used when Michael needed a boost to fire escapes or building roof tops. First used in Episode 1, \"Knight of the Phoenix (Pt. 1)\".\n\n;Passive Laser Restraint System : Added to KITT in later seasons, the restraint system helped protect Michael and any passengers from the shock of sudden impacts and hard stopping, especially after Super-Pursuit Mode. It is speculated that this is a primitive form of an [[Inertia negation|inertial damping]] device. First used in Episode 47, \"Knight of the Drones\".\n\n;Video Display Monitors : KITT had two [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] video display monitors on his dash for various readouts. They are controlled by two systems, the Graphic Translator (which sketches likenesses from verbal input) and the Anamorphic Equalizer (which gathered visual information from KITT's front scan bar) and microscanners. KITT only had one when his dash was redesigned for the show's third season.\n\n;Computer Print Out : KITT could print hard copies of data on a dashboard-mounted printer. First used in Episode 15, \"The Topaz Connection\".\n\n;Money Dispenser:KITT could give Michael money when he needed it. First used in Episode 59, \u201cKnight by a Nose\u201d.\n\n;Ultraphonic Chemical Analyzer : KITT has a retractable tray with an [[spectrometer|electron scanner]] that could analyze the chemical properties of various materials. It could even scan [[fingerprint]]s and read ballistic information off bullets and compare these with a police database. Aside from the scanning tray, the system could also analyze chemical information gathered from KITT's exterior sensors. First used in Episode 17, \"Chariot of Gold\".\n;Interior Oxygenator : KITT could release oxygen into his driver compartment and provide air to passengers if he was ever submerged in water or buried in earth. This is also used to overcome the effects of certain drugs. First used in Episode 5 (First episode was actually 2 episodes in one), \"Slammin' Sammy's Stunt Show Spectacular\".\n\n;Two-Wheel Ski Drive : The Ski Mode setting allowed KITT to \"[[Ski (driving stunt)|ski]]\" (driving up on two wheels). First used in Episode 1, \"Knight of the Phoenix\".\n\n;Third Stage Aquatic Synthesizer : With this system, KITT can [[Aquaplaning|hydroplane]], effectively \"driving\" on water, using his wheels and turbo system for propulsion. First used in Episode 28, \"Return to Cadiz\" but, later removed because it was now faulty at the end of the episode.\n\n;Emergency Braking System : The EBS slowed KITT down from Super-Pursuit speeds. It consisted of a forward braking booster and air panels that popped out to create air friction (air brakes). First used in Episode 70, \"Knight of the Juggernaut, Part II\".\n\n;Convertible Roof : Added fourth season, by pressing the \"C\" button on KITT's dash, Michael could bring the top down and KITT became a [[convertible]]. First used in Episode #70, \"Knight of the Juggernaut, Part II\".\n\nAn unknown number of these systems were designed at Stanford University (Episode 5, \"Just My Bill\"). KITT's total production cost was estimated at $11,400,000 in 1982 ($27,123,021.76 in 2013).{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The cost of subsequent equipment improvements and the installation of additional features since his activation have not been factored.\n\n===Other equipment===\n;Comlink: KITT is in constant contact with Michael via a two-way communication wristwatch (a modified '80s LCD AM radio watch) Michael wore. The watch also had a micro camera and scanner that KITT could access to gather information.\n\n;Homing Device: In dire emergency, Michael can activate a secret homing beacon hidden inside a gold pendant he wears around his neck. The beacon sends a priority signal that can remotely activate KITT and override his programming so that he rushes to Michael's aid. Used in Episode 42, \"A Good Knight's Work\" and in \"Knights of the Fast Lane\".\n\n[[Image:FLAGMobileUnit01.jpg|thumb|F.L.A.G. Mobile Command Center with Aerodynamic Sleeping Cab]]\n;F.L.A.G. Mobile Command Center (The Semi) : KITT has access to a mobile \"garage\", which was a [[semi-trailer truck]] owned by the Foundation. In most episodes, it is a [[GMC General]]. The trailer has an extendable ramp that dropped down and allows KITT to drive inside even when the truck is in motion. The trailer was loaded with spare parts and equipment for KITT. It also had a computer lab where technicians Bonnie or April would work and conduct repairs and maintenance while in transit. In \"Wrong Crowd\" thieves hijack the truck thinking it to be hauling liquor. In the episode \"Ten Wheel Trouble\", following an assassination attempt on Michael which damages an independent truck, it is used to transport a shipment of onions. In the episode \"Knight Moves\", it is used as bait to catch a gang of truck hijackers. In \"KITTnap\", KITT is kidnapped and Michael and RC3 use the tractor (which has been disconnected from the trailer) to go and find him.\n\n===Notes===\n* KITT's scanner is similar to that of [[Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)|Cylon]]s from the science fiction series ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]''. [[Glen A. Larson]], the creator of both ''Knight Rider'' and ''Battlestar Galactica'' has stated that the two shows have nothing else in common and to remove any fan speculation, he stated in the Season One ''Knight Rider'' DVD audio-comments, he simply reused the scanning light for KITT because he liked the effect.\n* KITT was designed by customizer Michael Scheffe.<ref>[http://www.carlustblog.com/2014/09/the-knight-industries-two-thousand-kitt-behind-the-scanner.html The Knight Industries Two Thousand \u2013 K.I.T.T.- Behind the Scanner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620163807/http://www.carlustblog.com/2014/09/the-knight-industries-two-thousand-kitt-behind-the-scanner.html |date=June 20, 2015 }} carlustblog.com</ref> The convertible and super-pursuit KITTs were designed and built by [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]].\n* A total of 23 KITT cars were made for use in filming the series. All except one of these cars survived until the show was axed; all except 5 of the remaining 22 cars were destroyed at the end of filming. Of the 5 that escaped that fate: 1 'hero' car was shipped to a theme park in Australia, but is now believed to be back in the US (whereabouts unknown); Universal kept one 'hero' car and one stunt car (and had a further replica made later) for use in the Entertainment Center display \u2013 the two originals have since been sold to a private collector in the US; another, a convertible, disappeared for a while before being sold to the former [[Cars of the Stars Motor Museum]] in [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]], Cumbria, England<ref name=\"kitt-r8\"/> This convertible was sold to the Dezer Collection, [[Miami]], [[Florida]] when Cars of the Stars closed. The fifth car is believed to be in private hands in the UK \u2013 this may be the only KITT that remains 'original' and is believed not to have been restored with replica parts.\n* The right-hand drive KITT, known as the \"Official Right Hand Drive KITT\" as used in the video \"Jump In My Car\" by David Hasselhoff, is owned by a company called Wilderness Studios Australia.\n* Press releases regularly appear claiming 'original screen-used' cars are being sold. For example: in April 4, 2007, \"one of the four KITT cars used in production of the television series\" was reputedly being put up for sale for $149,995 by Johnny Verhoek of Kassabian Motors, Dublin, California.<ref name=\"kitt-r9\"/><ref name=\"kitt-r10\"/>  And a story in ''USA Today'' from December 2007 states that Slain real estate developer and car aficionado, Andrew Kissel, was in possession of one of the surviving cars. Some reports say that Michael Jackson bought an original KITT and former N'Sync band member Joey Fatone also claims to have purchased one of these authentic original KITTs at auction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20160902,00.html|title=Comeback Kid at Heart|publisher=}}</ref> There have been more 'original' cars auctioned than were built in total for the show.\n* The September 25, 2014 fifth episode of the Dutch TV programme ''Syndroom'', featuring people with [[Down syndrome]] who wish to fulfill a dream, features Twan Vermeulen, a ''Knight Rider'' fan who wishes to meet David Hasselhoff and KITT. Together with the show's presenter they fly to L.A. and go searching for Hasselhoff's house. They \"find\" Hasselhoff on the driveway in front of his house, dusting off KITT. After KITT speaks a personal message to Twan, Hasselhoff offers to go with him to take KITT for a spin, \"Freak out some people on the freeway\", which they did with great pleasure for everyone involved.<ref>Guerrero, Danger (September 26, 2014).

One includes protagonist [[Dean Winchester]] riding a variation of his usual 1967 Chevy Impala that resembles KITT, with his brother [[Sam Winchester|Sam]] having been literally turned into the car, the episode featuring a scene with Dean driving the 'Sampala' with \"Knight Rider\"'s theme playing in the background.\n* KITT (voiced by [[Seth MacFarlane]]) appeared with Hasselhoff in a Comic-Con segment from the unrated version of the 2015 comedy ''[[Ted 2]]''.\n* KITT appears in the video game ''[[Lego Dimensions]]'' as part of the ''Knight Rider'' Fun Pack, with William Daniels reprising his role.\n* In ''[[Herbie: Fully Loaded]]'', KITT appears as part of a flashback which includes a newspaper headline reading \"Herbie Meets Knight Rider\"\n* KITT is referenced in the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode \"[[The Honking]]\", where it is revealed that his windscreen wipers were used as part of Project Satan, to create a car from components of the most evil cars in history (when characters observe that KITT wasn't evil, it is clarified that his windscreen wipers ''were'' evil but it never came up in the show).\n* In the ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' episode \"Drive Happy\", the self-driving boatmobile named Coupe is based on KITT, but behaves more like KARR.\n* In the ''[[Totally Spies!]]'' episode \"Game Girls\", a car named KIRTT (Klunky Incognito Radical Thought Transporter) has a sports mode form (a modified 1967 Ford Mustang).\n* In the ''[[Mickey and the Roadster Racers]]'' episode \"Mouse vs. Machine\", S.R.R. (Self-Racing Roadster), an A.I. roadster built by Professor Von Drake, is closely related to KITT.\n* In ''[[Ready Player One (film)|Ready Player One]]'', the KITT AI and scanner is fitted in Parzival's ''[[Back to the Future]]'' [[DeLorean time machine]].\n* In ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'', Nick Fury's SUV has a few functions that are similar to KITT's.\n* In ''[[Grand Theft Auto Online]]'', a vehicle named Ruiner 2000 from Import/Export update is heavily inspired by KITT.\n* A computerized talking vehicle named CARR (the acronym's meaning is unknown) that appears in the television series ''[[Stroker and Hoop]]'' is a parody of KITT while the name is a parody of KARR, although he is not evil and depicted in a more comical role.\n* In the ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' episode \"TV Knight 3\", Cyborg appears as KITT, with his body in the shape of the car itself, while Beast Boy plays as Michael Knight.\n* In ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'', the T-Car, which appears in some episodes throughout the series, has abilities that are the similar to KITT's, but does not include an A.I. (although it was once taken over by the villain Overload, which parodies to that of KARR).\n* In ''[[Lab Rats (U.S. TV series)|Lab Rats]]'', the self-driving car that appears in the episode \"Speed Trapped\" has abilities that are almost the same as KITT's.\n* In the anime cartoon ''[[Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2001 TV series)|Transformers: Robots in Disguise]]'', the Transformers that appear throughout the series demonstrate a few abilities that are the similar to KITT's.\n* In the anime cartoon ''[[Hayate the Combat Butler]]'', CHITT, who is entirely the same as KITT but has six wheels instead of four, appears in the episode \"New Year's Food is Also Good, but Enjoy Hayate, Too\" along with his driver who is also named Micheal.\n* In the ''[[Inspector Gadget]]'' series, the Gadgetmobile that appears in the animated series has abilities that resemble KITT's. The live-action film series' version has an A.I. like KITT (which behaves more comical), which too had similar abilities.\n* As DLC for ''[[Planet Coaster]]'', KITT can be found in pieces or as a whole car along with KARR.  He also exists in Super Pursuit mode.\n* In the 3D simulation ride ''[[Race Through New York Starring Jimmy Fallon]]'', Fallon's race car, the Tonight Rider, is a reference to KITT and the ''Knight Rider'' series itself.\n* In ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'', Katt Karr, a black car with the features and characteristics of a cat that appears in the episode \"Ferb TV\", is a parody of KITT, with the name being a reference to both KITT and KARR. Unlike KITT, Katt Karr's A.I. meows like a cat and does not speak.\n* In ''[[The Simpsons]]'', Knightboat, a black motorboat that has the same characteristics as KITT, appears in the episode \"And Maggie Makes Three\" in a TV show (which is based on ''Knight Rider'') that Homer, Marge, and Lisa are watching.\n* KITT appears as a playable vehicle for the DLC of ''[[Rocket League]]''.\n* In ''[[Spies in Disguise]]'', Lance Sterling's car shares a few functions with KITT.\n* In ''[[Kim Possible]]'', SADI is a red SUV that assists Kim in her quest to rescue SADI's creator, Dr. Freeman, from Dr. Drakken in the episode \"Car Trouble.\" SADI had capabilities similar to KITT, such as the ability to talk and drive itself, but has a female voice.\n\nVarious toy versions of KITT have been released. Among the best known ''Knight Rider'' memorabilia includes the remote controlled KITT, the ''Knight Rider'' lunch box, and the deluxe version of KITT. The deluxe model of KITT, sold by [[Kenner|Kenner Toys]] and dubbed the \"Knight 2000 Voice Car\", spoke electronically (actual voice of William Daniels), featured a detailed interior and a Michael Knight action figure.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.teamknightrider.com/classic/merchandise/car.html |title=Knight 2000 Voice Car From Kenner |publisher=teamknightrider.com |accessdate=February 22, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127111749/http://www.teamknightrider.com/classic/merchandise/car.html |archivedate=January 27, 2011 }}</ref> [[Ertl Company|ERTL]] released die-cast toys of KITT in three different sizes\u2014the common miniature sized<!--huh?

The KITT platform is patterned on a [[Shelby Mustang#2008\u20132009 GT500KR|Shelby GT500KR]] and differs from the original Two Thousand unit in several ways. For example, the 2008 KITT utilizes nano-technology, allowing the car's outer shell to change colors and morph itself into similar forms temporarily.<ref name=\"kitt-r4\"/> The nanotech platform is written as needing the AI active in order to produce any of these effects, unlike the original car's gadgets and \"molecular bonded shell\" which allowed it to endure extreme impacts. These down-sides to the use of nanotech have been demonstrated when villains are able to cause significant damage, such as shooting out windows, when the AI is deactivated. It can also turn into two different types of a [[Ford F-Series|Ford F-150]] 4x4 truck (one completely stock and the other with some modifications), a [[Ford E-Series|Ford E-150]] van, a [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor]], a special edition Warriors In Pink Mustang (in support of breast cancer awareness month), and a [[Ford Flex]] for disguise or to use the alternate modes' capabilities (such as off-road handling). The car can engage an \"Attack Mode\", featuring scissor/conventional hybrid doors, which allows it to increase speed and use most of its gadgets (including turbo boost). It had a different looking attack mode in the pilot which was used whenever the car needed to increase speed. Its downside however is that it only seats two. KITT is also capable of functioning submerged, maintaining life support and system integrity while underwater.\n\nWhile the original series stated the original KITT was designed by Wilton Knight, the 2008 TV movie implies Charles Graiman may have co-designed the car and the AI for Wilton Knight, was subsequently relocated to protect him and his family, and later designed the Knight Industries Three Thousand. KITT's weapons include a grappling hook located in the front bumper, usable in normal and attack modes, and missile launchers usable only in attack mode, which were first used in \"Knight of the Hunter\". In the Halloween episode \"Knight of the Living Dead\", KITT demonstrates the ability to cosmetically alter his appearance, becoming a black Mustang convertible with a pink trim as a Halloween costume. This configuration had the scanner bar relocated to behind the grille. Dr. Graiman also reveals in this episode that a backup neural network exists when he suggests downloading KITT's files and reuploading them to the backup, to which replies \"The Backup is not me.\" In the pilot, KITT had shown himself capable of similarly altering his external appearance\u2014changing his color and licence plate. In \"Knight of the Zodiac\", KITT uses a dispenser located in his undercarriage to spread [[black ice]], and a fingerprint generator in the glovebox to overlay the fingerprints of a captured thief over Mike's.\n\n===Features===\n{{in-universe|date=March 2013}}\n;Backup Mainframe Processor: If the Knight Industries Three Thousand detects a fault or damage with his microprocessor, he carries a backup which can be mounted in the field automatically.\n\n;Windshield Projection: Used in place of the centre console screen in the Pilot. The entire front windshield is able to display information as well as the video communication link with the SSC.\n\n;Bio Matrix Scanner: Used to detect the health status of people nearby.\n\n;Nanotech Skin: This replaces the Molecular Bonded Shell from the original series. Unlike [[#KITT (Knight Industries Two Thousand)|KITT's former incarnation]] of an impregnable outer shell of the vehicle with a nearly indestructible polymer, Knight Industries Three Thousand are a series of nano-machines that create the car's outer shell (a 2008 Ford Mustang GT500KR) and a second \"skin\" in whereupon detection of any damage will instantly repair the affected area. When Knight Industries Three Thousand is deactivated, the nano repair system is also disabled, making his basic nano-tech shell susceptible to physical damage. The second \"skin\" can affect KITT's outer shell as well, allowing KITT to disguise himself by transforming into various similar sized machinery.\n\n;Turbo Boost: A power injector system that provides large bursts of power to allow KITT to jump over obstacles. This ability along with directional exhaust outlets allows KITT to jump from a standstill or at high speed.\n\n;Hood Surface Screen: Similar to the projection windshield, this allows KITT to display data on exterior hood for outside briefings or with other parties.\n\n;Offensive missiles: (Used in conjunction with attack mode): two tube-launched missiles that retract from each door.\n\n;Gatling guns: (Again, used in conjunction with attack mode): two gatling-style guns that are retracted from the hood. Seen in season 1 episode 15, \"Fly By Knight\". In episode 16, \"Knight and the City\", KITT deploys a single machine gun while in regular mode. In this episode, KITT also indicates that he would run out of ammunition in 7 seconds and that he would expend 8,000 rounds in that timespan, which means that KITT's gatling guns have an approximate rate of fire of 1,143 rounds per second, over ten times higher than that of a regular [[minigun]].\n\n;Laser: A [[directed energy]] device capable of destroying locks and other items, projected from scanner bar.\n\n;EMP: An electromagnetic pulse projector, which allows disabling of any electronic circuit or device within the given area. First seen in Episode 8, \"Knight of the Zodiac\".\n\n;Anti-Missile Flares: Deployed from rear bumper. Disk-like objects that when dispensed produce an intense heat source to deter heat-seeking projectiles.\n\n;Anti-Traction Compound Dispenser: (Known as Black Ice): An exterior dispenser that can eject a liquid, making the targeted surface tractionless.\n\n;Interior tear gas dispenser: Used for anti-theft and defensive purposes. KITT can fill the car's cabin with tear gas to incapacitate a would-be thief as seen in Episode 7, \"I Wanna Rock & Roll All Knight\".\n\n;Ski Mode: With help of the Turbo boost left power injector system to gain impulse for make KITT drivable on two wheels. First seen in episode 12 \"Knight to King's Pawn\".\n\n;3D Object Printer: A device that allows for the creation of small 3-D objects (such as keys) based on available electronic data.\n\n;Printer: Standard printer used for documents and incoming faxes. Located in the passenger side dash.\n\n;Fingerprint Overlay Printer: A device accessible via the glove box that allows KITT to scan fingerprints from an inserted object and overlay then onto another person's hand.\n\n;Weapons Cache: Small arms cache accessible via the glove box area that usually contains two 9mm handguns with extra magazines for occupant's protection outside KITT.\n\n;First Aid: Accessible via glove box. Allows for field mending of physical wounds such as lost appendages.\n\n;Self-Destruct: A software program secretly built into KITT that, when activated by the SSC, turns KITT into a bomb using his fuel as the charge and his computer as the detonator.\n\n;Earwig: Small ear piece used to communicate with KITT at a limited distance.\n\n===Transformation abilities===\n;Attack Mode: KITT's original Attack mode was purely used to increase speeds. It was changed after the [[Knight Rider (2008 film)|pilot]].\n\n;Attack Mode II: Similar to the original KITT's alternate configuration to allow faster traveling speeds. First seen in Episode 1, \"A Knight in Shining Armor\".\n\n;Ford F-150 FX4: Alternate mode for off-road travel. Also has ability to allow quick ingress at speed. Scanner bar is located in the grill at the very top of the inlet. First seen in Episode 1, \"A Knight in Shining Armor\".\n\n;Ford F-150 II: After \"Knight of the Hunter\", an alternate F-150 mode, which has extra off-road modifications.\n\n;Ford E-150 Cargo Van: For disguise purposes. All doors are fully functional. Scanner bar is not shown. As seen in Episode 4, \"A Hard Day's Knight\".\n\n;Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor: For disguise purposes, used to elude police. KITT's presence indicator (Orb) is displayed on the MDT screen rather than a separate entity on the dash. In this configuration, KITT's scanner bar is hidden behind the top of the frame around the front grille. As seen in Episode 4, \"A Hard Day's Knight\".\n\n;Ford Mustang GT: As seen on the pilot film. KITT converted into a silver Mustang en route to Las Vegas. He also transformed into a purple Mustang to help Michael and Sarah in their escape in Vegas.\n\n;Ford Mustang Convertible: (Warriors in Pink Edition): A disguise that was used for the Halloween episode \"Knight of the Living Dead\", Episode 6. Basically a standard Mustang convertible with pink trim and aftermarket wheels, and the breast cancer logo under the mustang symbols. The scanner bar is located behind the front grille.\n\n;Ford Flex: For disguise purposes. A customized version with metallic gray paint and taillight blackouts; the scanner bar is located in the lower bumper intake grille. In this configuration, access to some systems, such as his laser and EMP, are available. As seen in Episode 8, \"Knight of the Zodiac\".\n\n;1969 Ford Mustang Mach 1: For disguise purposes. A dark blue classic with the scanner located in the grille. As seen in the episode \"Fly By Knight\" when a DEA agent had an [[all-points bulletin]] on Mike and KITT. (\"Shall we go old school?\")\n\n===KARR redesign===\n:''See'' [[KARR (Knight Rider)#KARR 2.0 in Knight Rider 2008\u20132009|KARR (Knight Rider)]]\n\nKARR (Peter Cullen, later Paul Frees) was the original prototype of the first KITT (Knight Industries Two Thousand) but to mirror the pattern of the original series, the nemesis and prototype of the second KITT (Knight Industries Three Thousand) is also designated as KARR in the new series. KARR is apparently a new evil twin character just like the Knight 3000, and the acronym now stands for '''Knight Auto-Cybernetic Roving Robotic-Exoskeleton'''.\n\nKARR's visual identity has also had similar changes for the new series. KARR was originally designed for military combat. KARR has the ability to transform from vehicle mode into a large wheeled robotic exoskeleton like a Transformer Decepticon instead of KITTs \"Attack Mode\". The vehicle mode of KARR is a 2008\u20132009 Shelby GT500KR with the license plate initials K.R. KARR is once again voiced by [[Peter Cullen]], who also voiced the first appearance of KARR Knight Automated Roving Robot in \"Trust Doesn't Rust\". The transformation sequence is very similar to that in the 2007 \"Transformers\" live action film. Armed with twin machine guns on each shoulder and missiles, the exoskeleton combines with a human being for easier control. After a brief brawl, KITT uses the grappling hook to tear off KARR's chest plate, freeing one of Michael's co-workers, Alex Torres. Michael rams KITT through KARR's torso using Turbo Boost, apparently destroying KARR. It is unclear if KARR had the same nano repair function as KITT, nor if his A.I. unit survived. KARR is visually identical to KITT in this iteration, lacking the two tone black and silver paint job of the 80s version.

The vehicle had numerous 21st Century technological improvements over the previous 1980s version of KITT, such as an advanced amphibious mode (which allows the car to ride on water like a speedboat), a [[virtual reality]] [[heads-up display]] (or VR-HUD, which utilized the entire windshield as a video display), and a microwave stun device that could remotely incapacitate a human target. However, no acknowledgement is made to this spin-off in the 2008 series.\n\n===Features===\n{{in-universe|date=March 2013}}\nThe Knight 4000 has most of KITT's original features, including a few new and improved systems<ref name=\"kitt-r2\"/>\n\n;Virtual Reality Heads-up Display : Rather than dash-mounted [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] displays, the Knight 4000 uses a virtual reality heads-up display employing the entire windshield as video monitor.\n;Thermal Expander : The Knight 4000 was equipped with an offensive weapon which consisted of a microwave projector that caused the temperatures of targeted objects to quickly rise and either ignite or explode.\n;Remote Target Assist : This allows the pilot aim and fire with a complete and perfect accuracy via the Knight 4000's help.\n;Amphibious Mode : The Knight 4000 can float and maneuver on water much like a boat. The system was actually a major improvement over KITT's original hydroplane ability which during the original series was prone to malfunctions during its experimental phase.\n;Microwave Stunner : Similar to the \u201cnon-lethal\u201d sidearms used by the police, the Knight 4000 was equipped with a microwave stunner that could incapacitate criminals.\n;Voice Activated Controls : The Knight 4000's dashboard is less \"cluttered looking\" than KITT's original dash with most of the controls now being completely voice activated rather than having to push a button.\n;Fax Machine : The Knight 4000 could print out faxed messages from a dash mounted printer.\n;Infrared Scanner : The Infrared Scanner was a device with which the Knight 4000 could scan on an Infrared level, which would identify laser scope rifles as well as hidden objects giving off heat.\n;Aroma Monitor : This system is similar to the Knight 2000's Olfactory Scan, but is much more complex.\n;Voice Sampler : Similar to the Knight 2000's Anharmonic Synthesizer, this device could simulate any voice which has been recorded into the Knight 4000's memory.\n;Thermal Sensor : This system allows the Knight 4000 to watch and record what is happening in a particular place, such as inside a vehicle.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pontiac Firebird|Pontiac Trans Am]]\n*[[Shelby Mustang#1967 Shelby GT350 / GT500|Shelby Mustang]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"kitt-r1\">Mentioned in \"Goliath Returns\" when KITT talks to Dr. Bergstrom.</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"kitt-r2\">{{cite web |url=http://kr2k.com/faq.html#4 |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Knight Rider 2000 Online |accessdate=February 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713170419/http://kr2k.com/faq.html#4 |archivedate=July 13, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"kitt-r3\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jayohrberg.com/Knight_Rider_2000.html |title=Knight Rider 2000 |publisher=Jay Ohrberg's Hollywood Cars |accessdate=February 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"kitt-r4\">{{cite news |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/automotive/new_cars/4237588.html |title=Under the Hood With Knight Rider 2.0: Trans Am vs. Ford Mustang (Featuring Exclusive New KITT Specs\u2014and Classic Hasselhoff!) |work=[[Popular Mechanics]] |date=December 20, 2007 |accessdate=December 28, 2007 |last=Tannert |first=Chuck |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113193046/http://www.popularmechanics.com/automotive/new_cars/4237588.html |archivedate=January 13, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n<!-- <ref name=\"kitt-r5\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.stangnet.com/Ford-Mustang-News/2008-Shelby-GT500KR-070330.html |title=2008 Shelby GT500KR&nbsp;\u2014 King of the Road |accessdate=March 1, 2008 |work=www.stangnet.com |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080206205629/http://www.stangnet.com/Ford-Mustang-News/2008-Shelby-GT500KR-070330.html  |archivedate = February 6, 2008}}</ref> -->\n\n<ref name=\"kitt-r6\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn3-O17f4tg |title=Knight Rider Stripper |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=February 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"kitt-r8\">{{cite web |url=http://www.carsofthestars.com/cott3_6.html |title=Television Cars \u2013 Page 6 \u2013 KITT from Knightrider |publisher=Cars of the Stars |accessdate=February 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204071902/http://www.carsofthestars.com/cott3_6.html |archivedate=February 4, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"kitt-r9\">{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/for-sale-talking-car-one-lessthancareful-owner-443264.html |title=For sale: Talking car, one less-than-careful owner |date=April 4, 2007 |publisher=The Independent |last=Buncombe |first=Andrew |accessdate=February 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"kitt-r10\">{{cite web |url=http://www.myhotcars.com/used-cars.php?id=7c44e23b5881c433255586352de178d1 |title=1982 PONTIAC KNIGHT RIDER K.I.T.T.
