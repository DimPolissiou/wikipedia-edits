Since then it has usually voted for the Republican nominee (13 of 17 elections).\n\nAs one of the most northerly [[Southern United States|\u201csouthern\u201d]] counties in Illinois, Greene County was rock-ribbed Democratic for the seventy years after [[American Civil War|the Civil War]], which it opposed as a \u201c[[Yankee]]\u201d war. Not until considerable anti-Catholic sentiment against [[Al Smith]] turned many voters to [[Herbert Hoover]] did the county support a Republican presidential nominee. However, with the coming of [[World War II]], opposition to American involvement led to gains for [[Wendell Willkie]] and [[Thomas E. Dewey]], although apart from the 1960 election \u2013 also influenced by Catholicism \u2013 Greene was a [[bellwether]] county throughout the period from 1928 to 2004.\n\nIn recent years, like most of downstate Illinois, opposition to the Democratic Party's liberal views on social issues, along with economic problems, has caused very rapid swings toward the Republican Party. [[Hillary Clinton]]\u2019s 2016 tally of 21.6 percent of the county\u2019s vote is fifteen percent worse than any Democrat before 2010.\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential elections results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential elections results'''<ref>http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

Since then it has usually voted for the Republican nominee (13 of 17 elections).\n\nAs one of the most northerly [[Southern United States|\u201csouthern\u201d]] counties in Illinois, Greene County was rock-ribbed Democratic for the seventy years after [[American Civil War|the Civil War]], which it opposed as a \u201c[[Yankee]]\u201d war. Not until considerable anti-Catholic sentiment against [[Al Smith]] turned many voters to [[Herbert Hoover]] did the county support a Republican presidential nominee. However, with the coming of [[World War II]], opposition to American involvement led to gains for [[Wendell Willkie]] and [[Thomas E. Dewey]], although apart from the 1960 election \u2013 also influenced by Catholicism \u2013 Greene was a [[bellwether]] county throughout the period from 1928 to 2004.\n\nIn recent years, like most of downstate Illinois, opposition to the Democratic Party's liberal views on social issues, along with economic problems, has caused very rapid swings toward the Republican Party. [[Hillary Clinton]]\u2019s 2016 tally of 21.6 percent of the county\u2019s vote is fifteen percent worse than any Democrat before 2010.\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential elections results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential elections results'''<ref>http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

{"title_page": "Persecutions of the Catholic Church and Pius XII", "text_new": "{{Main article|Pope Pius XII}}\n{{Modern persecutions of the Catholic Church}}\nPersecutions against the [[Catholic Church]] took place throughout the pontificate of [[Pope Pius XII]] (1939-1958). Pius' reign coincided with the [[World War II|Second World War]], the commencement of the [[Cold War]] and the accelerating European [[Decolonization of Africa|decolonisation]]. During this time, the Catholic Church faced persecution under [[Fascism|Fascist]] and [[Communism|Communist]] governments.\n\nThe Nazi persecution of the church was at its most extreme in [[German-occupied Poland|Occupied Poland]]. The defeat of Fascism at the end of [[World War Two|World War II]] ended one set of persecutions, but strengthened the position of Communism throughout the world, intensifying a further set of persecutions \u2013 notably in [[Eastern Europe]], the [[USSR]], and, later, the [[People's Republic of China]]. The Catholic Church was under attack in all [[Communist]] governed countries and lost most of its existence in [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Romania]], Communist China and the Soviet Union (including [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]).\n\n== Summary ==\nThe pontificate of Pius XII coincided with the Second World War (1939-1945) and the early stages of the Cold War. The Catholic Church was repressed under the Nazi Empire and then under the Soviet dominated Communist states established in Eastern and Central Europe following the war. The Catholic Church in Germany was systematically repressed by the Nazis and persecution was at its most severe in Nazi occupied Poland, where churches, seminaries, monasteries and convents were systematically closed and thousands of priests and nuns were either murdered, imprisoned or deported.\n\nAccording to [[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]], the Church was faced with a dilemma: compromise with the governments in order to maintain a structure with which to survive, or resist or confront and risk annihilation.<ref name=\"Cornwell 333\">Cornwell 333</ref> To save its faithful, the Vatican attempted both at varying times.\n\nIn [[East Germany]] and [[Hungary]], the Church was subjected to ongoing attacks, but was able to continue some of its activities, however on a much reduced scale. In [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Hungary]], persecution continued to the point that the Church faced extinction. In the Soviet Union and mainland China, the Catholic Church largely ceased to exist, at least publicly, during the [[pontificate]] of Pope Pius XII.\n\n==Fascist persecutions==\n===Nazi persecutions===\n\n====Germany====\n\nThe Catholic Church had been a leading opponent of the rise of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] through the 1920s and early 1930s. Upon taking power in 1933, and despite the [[Reichskonkordat|Concordat]] it signed with the church promising the contrary, the Nazi Government of [[Adolf Hitler]] began suppressing the Catholic Church as part of an overall policy of to eliminate competing sources of authority. The Nazis arrested thousands of members of the German [[Centre Party (Germany)|Catholic Centre Party]] as well as Catholic clergymen and closed Catholic schools and institutions. As the [[Third Reich]] expanded, thousands more Catholic priests were imprisoned or killed and Catholic institutions disbanded by the Nazis.<ref>http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/about/01/non_jews_persecution.asp</ref>\n\nAccording to Hitler's biographer [[Alan Bullock]], Hitler was a \"man who believed neither in God nor in conscience ('a Jewish invention, a blemish like circumcision')\".<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p216</ref> Bullock wrote: Hitler thought that Catholic teachings, taken to their conclusion, \"would mean the systematic cultivation of the human failure\".<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p218</ref> Bullock adds that \"once the war was over, [Hitler] promised himself, he would root out and destroy the influence of the Christian churches, but until then he would be circumspect\":<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p219</ref>\n\n{{quote|Hitler had been brought up a Catholic and was impressed by the organisation and power of the Church.

The [[Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands#Old Catholic Archbishops of Utrecht|Archbishop of Utrecht]] and other Catholics refused to comply, and the Nazis commenced a round up of all ethnically Jewish Catholics. Some 40,000 Jews were hidden by the Dutch church and 49 priests killed in the process.<ref name=\"catholiceducation.org\"/> Among the Catholics of the Netherlands abducted in this way was Saint [[Edith Stein]], who died at Auschwitz.\n\n===Japanese persecutions===\n{{expand section|date=April 2013}}\n\nThe expansion of Imperial Japan across the Asia Pacific from 1941 was accompanied by [[Japanese war crimes|many atrocities]] against Catholic missionaries, clerics, nuns, and lay people. Imperial Japan had developed [[State Shinto]] as the Imperial religion and promoted the notion of the [[Arahitogami|divinity of the Emperor]]. Japanese propaganda identified Catholics with European dominance \u2013 especially among Japan's own small Catholic community but also larger Asian communities in [[East Timor]], [[Korea]], [[French Indo-China]] the [[Dutch East Indies]], the [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Australian Papua and New Guinea]] and elsewhere.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/column/non-european-catholics-and-world-war-two-1672|title=Non-European Catholics and World War Two - CNA Columns: Inside the Church during WWII|website=Catholic News Agency - By Harry Schnitker, Ph.D.|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\nIn the majority Catholic Philippines, priests and seminarians were interned.<ref>http://www.jesuit.org/blog/index.php/tag/world-war-2/</ref> The five Columban priests killed at Malate are remembered as the [[Malate Martyrs]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.columban.org.au/media-and-publications/the-far-east-magazine/archive/2008/july/how-our-priests-died|title=How our six priests died in the Philippines|website=www.columban.org.au|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Territory of New Guinea|Australian New Guinea]], priests and religious were imprisoned in concentration camps.<ref name=\"asianews.it\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.asianews.it/news-en/The-Japanese-Church-apologizes-to-Papua:-Peter-To-Rot%E2%80%99s-death-is-our-fault-25276.html|title=The Japanese Church apologizes to Papua:|last=AsiaNews.it|website=www.asianews.it|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> From 1943, Japanese toleration of Christianity had shifted to confrontation.<ref name=\"Peter To Rot\">[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/to-rot-peter-11873 Peter To Rot]; Australian Dictionary of Biography; online 17 July 2014</ref> Troops interfered with Catholic religious practices and destroyed church buildings.<ref name=\"asianews.it\"/> Some 100 Catholics were killed for continuing to catechise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kwl.com.au/blog/theology/timeline-of-the-catholic-church-in-australia/|title=Timeline of The Catholic Church in Australia|language=en-AU|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> The martyr [[Peter To Rot]] took up duties as a [[catechist]] after Japanese invaders imprisoned the local missionaries.

As previously with Germany under the National Socialist government, Pope Pius refused to break diplomatic relations with Communist authorities.<ref>Before 1939, as Secretary of State, he had debated this point with [[Pope Pius XI]]. Pacelli argued, that a break of diplomatic relations means losing all contacts with the local hierarchy and, eventually, paying a much higher price:\n\n* Pius XI asked me, how can the [[Holy See]]  keep its [[nuncio]] there?  This is against our honour. I answered: Your Holiness,  what do we do afterwards? How do we maintain any contacts with our bishops?  He understood and calmed down. (Actes et documents Vol II, p.424)</ref>\n\nThus, after World War II, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] kept its nuncios in Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, [[Romania]] and China, until these countries severed relations interrupting communication with bishops as well. The Vatican responded by giving local bishops unprecedented authority to deal with authorities on their own, but without granting the right to define overall relations, viewed as the sole privilege of the Holy See.<ref>Letter of Monsignor Tardini to the Archbishop of Belgrad, 2 16, 1952, in HK VII, 1952 447</ref> In encyclicals such as ''[[Invicti athletae]]'', and Apostolic letters to Czech Bishops, Polish Bishops, the Bishops of Hungary, China, and Romania,<ref>Czechoslovakia AAS 1948 33, Poland AAS 1949 29,    Hungary AAS 1952 249, China AAS 1952 153, Romania AAS 1947, 223</ref> the Pope encouraged local bishops to be firm, modest and wise in their dealings with the new communist authorities.

Nevertheless, the Vatican was not successful in blocking episcopal enthronements by the governments of China and Czechoslovakia. These persons were not excommunicated, however. In his last encyclical [[Ad Apostolorum Principis|''Ad Apostolorum Principis'']] to the bishops of China, Pope Pius XII expressed the opinion that schismatic bishops and priests are the final step towards total elimination of the Catholic Church in that country.<ref>AAS 1958 601</ref> Questions were raised as to why the Vatican appointed powerful but often inexperienced American bishops as nuncios in some Eastern countries, given the anti-American, anti-imperialist tendencies in these countries.<ref>see Stehle, Ostpolitik</ref> While there is no documentation on Vatican motives, a possible reason could be the relative security of US nationals in foreign countries.\n\n=== Persecutions and Church policies ===\n==== China ====\n[[File:Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur de Shizhi.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sacred Heart Cathedral of Guangzhou]]]]\n{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and China}}\n\nFor centuries, access to the people of China was difficult for the Catholic Church, because it did not recognize local [[Confucian]] customs of honouring deceased family members. To the Chinese, this was an [[ancient]] [[ritual]]; to the Vatican it was a [[religious]] exercise which conflicted with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[dogma]]. As a result, the Church made little progress in China. Within months of his election, Pope Pius issued a dramatic change in policies. On 8 December 1939 the Sacred Congregation of the Propagation of Faith issued, at the request of Pius XII, a new instruction by which Chinese customs were no longer considered [[superstitious]], but an honourable way of esteeming ones relatives and therefore permitted by Catholic Christians.<ref>Smit 186\u2013187.</ref> The [[Government of the Republic of China|Government of China]] established diplomatic relations with the Vatican in 1943. The Papal degree changed the [[ecclesiastical]] situation in China in an almost revolutionary way.<ref>Smit 188</ref> As the Church began to flourish, [[Pius XII]] established a local ecclesiastical hierarchy and received the Archbishop of Peking, [[Thomas Tien Ken-sin]], SVD, into the Sacred [[College of Cardinals]].<ref>Smit 188.</ref>\n\nAfter World War II, about four million Chinese were members of the Catholic faith. This was less than one percent of the population but numbers increased dramatically. In 1949, there existed 20 archdioceses, 85 dioceses, 39 apostolic prefectures, 3080 foreign missionaries, 2557 Chinese priests.<ref>Giovanetti 230</ref>\n\nThe establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949 put these early advances on hold and led to the [[persecution]] of thousands of clergy and faithful in China. A patriotic Chinese Church was formed. Since that time, the persecuted Catholic Church exists as a tiny fraction in secrecy and underground only. The losses were considerable. For example, in 1948, the Catholic Church had operated some 254 orphanages and 196 hospitals with 81,628 beds.<ref>Herder Korrespondenz 5, 201</ref> Catholic clergy experienced increased supervision. Bishops and priests were forced to engage in degrading menial jobs to earn their living. Foreign missionaries were accused of being foreign agents who would turn the country over to imperialist forces.<ref>Giovanetti 232</ref>\n\n====Soviet Union====\n{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and Russia}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lemko church.jpg|thumb|The Shelesto St Michael's wooden church (1777) is a classic example of Ruthenian architecture.]] -->\n\nRelations between Soviet authorities and the Vatican were always difficult.

[[Pius XI]] followed this line with numerous statements<ref>AAS 29, 1937, 67</ref> and the encyclicals ''[[Miserentissimus Redemptor]],<ref>AAS 20 1928 165\u2013178</ref> Caritate Christi,<ref>AAS 24 1932 177\u2013194</ref> and [[Divini Redemptoris]]''.<ref>AAS 29, 1937 65\u2013106</ref> The pontificate of Pius XII from the very beginning faced problems, as large parts of Poland, the [[Baltic States]], and their Catholic populations were incorporated into the [[USSR]]. At once, the United Catholic Churches of [[Armenia]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Ruthenia]] were attacked.\n\n==== Catholic Ruthenian and Ukrainian Churches ====\nSoviet attempts to separate the United Churches from Rome reflected not only Soviet policy, but were a continuation of centuries-old Russian policies towards the papacy, already viewed as [[anti-Russian]].<ref>see main article, Pope Pius IX, Pope Leo XIII</ref> Pius also was aware that, in months preceding the [[encyclical]] ''[[Orientales omnes Ecclesias]]'', all Catholic bishops of the Ukrainian Church had been arrested, including [[Josyf Slipyj]], [[Gregory Chomysyn, John Laysevkyi, Nicolas Carneckyi, Josaphat Kocylovskyi]]. Some, including Bishop Nicetas Budka, perished in Siberia.<ref>Giovannetti, 131</ref> Subjected to Stalinist [[Show Trials]], they all received severe sentencing. The remaining leaders of the hierarchies and heads of all seminaries and episcopal offices were arrested and tried in 1945 and 1946.\n\nWith the Catholic Church robbed of its leadership, a \"spontaneous movement\" for separation from Rome and unification with the Russian Orthodox Church developed. [[Mass arrest]]s of priests followed. In [[Lemko]], some five hundred priests were jailed in 1945<ref>Giovannetti, 90</ref> or sent to a Gulag, officially called \"an unknown destination because of political reasons\".<ref>Smit, 174</ref> Church institutions were confiscated and expropriated; churches, monasteries and seminaries were closed and looted,<ref>Adrianyi, 517</ref> Catholic United Churches were integrated under the [[Moscow Patriarchy]] after all residing bishops and apostolic administrators were arrested.<ref>Adrianyi, 518</ref> The Catholic Church of the Ukraine was thus liquidated and its properties turned over to the Orthodox Church under the [[Patriarch of Moscow]].\n\nAfter Joseph Stalin died in 1953, \"[[peaceful coexistence]]\" became the subject of numerous discussions. In his Christmas Message of 1954, Pius XII defined possibilities and preconditions for it. He indicated Vatican willingness to practical [[cooperation]] whenever possible in the interest of the faithful. The slow pace of de[[-Stalinisation]] and the Soviet crack-down of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] thwarted major results aside from modest improvements in Poland and Yugoslavia after 1956. In January 1958, Soviet Foreign Minister [[Andrey Gromyko]] expressed the willingness of Moscow to have formal relations with the Vatican, in light of the position of Pope Pius XII on world peace and the uses of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, a position which was called identical with [[Kremlin]] policy.<ref>Giovannetti,  88</ref>\n\n==== Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia ====\nThe small Catholic churches of Estonia and the Church in Latvia were completely annihilated after the Soviet Union reintegrated these countries into its territory in 1945. All Church organizations were outlawed and all bishops jailed.<ref>Adrianyi, 514.</ref>\n\nIn 1939, Pope Pius received the ambassador of [[Lithuania]] for a final meeting prior to the Soviet occupation. At the outbreak of World War II there were 800 parishes, 1500 priests, and 600 candidates for the priesthood in four seminaries in Lithuania. As a part of the Soviet crackdown, the complete hierarchy, a large part of the clergy and about a third of the Catholic population was deported.<ref>Adrianyi, 515</ref>\n\n==== Poland ====\n{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and Poland}}\n[[File:Wyszy\u0144ski.jpg|thumb|right|Stefan Cardinal Wyszy\u0144ski was arrested from 1953 to 1956]]\n\nWith the war over, the Pope discontinued his war-time policy of neutrality, stating that he had abstained from protests during the war in spite of massive persecutions.<ref>Giovannetti, 139</ref> The Communist Party of Poland assumed governmental control in 1947, and began to confiscate Church properties in the months thereafter. By late 1947, Catholic educational institutes, kindergartens, schools, and orphanages were expropriated as well. Starting in 1948, mass arrest and show trials began to take place against Catholic bishops and clergy. Pope Pius XII responded with an apostolic letter ''Flagranti Semper Animi'',<ref>January 18, 1948, AAS 1948, 324</ref> in which he defended the Church against attacks and Stalinist persecution tactics. However, pressures against the Church increased with the de facto outlawing of religious meetings and organizations. Pope Pius responded with a letter commemorating the 10th anniversary of the beginning of World War II, [[Decennium Dum Expletur]]. He writes that while the Polish people had suffered like nobody else during the war, the suffering continues ten years afterwards. [[Cum Jam Lustri|''Cum Jam Lustri'']] commemorates the death of two Polish Cardinals, Hlond and Sapieha, and encourages the Church in Poland. In honour of [[Stanislaus of Szczepan\u00f3w|Saint Stanis\u0142aw]], Pope Pius XII issued [[Poloniae Annalibus|''Poloniae Annalibus'']], giving consolation and again expressing his certitude that Christ will win and the persecution will end. By 1952 some 1000 priests were incarcerated, all seminaries closed, and [[religious institute]]s dissolved.<ref>Giovannetti, 150</ref> On 19 November 1953 the pontiff addressed the [[Diplomatic Corps|diplomatic corps]] to issue a protest against the incarceration of Cardinal [[Stefan Wyszynski]].<ref>AAS, 1953, 755</ref> After the arrest of the cardinal, authorities supported patriotic priests who were open to separation from Rome. At the 300th anniversary of the successful defence of [[Jasna G\u00f3ra]], Pope Pius XII wrote again to Poland, congratulating the courageous defenders of the faith in his time. [[Gloriosam Reginam|''Gloriosam Reginam'']] salutes the modern day Polish martyrs and expresses confidence in victory for Mary, Queen of Poland. He salutes Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski upon his return from arrest in October 1956.\n\nWith ''[[Invicti athletae]] i''n 1957, Pope Pius addressed in strong words the Polish episcopate for the 300th. anniversary of the martyrdom of [[Saint]] [[Andrew Bobola]] by the Russians: \"The haters of God and enemies of Christian teaching attack Jesus Christ and his Church.\" The Pope counselled endurance and bravery. The people and clergy must overcome many obstacles, with sacrifices of time and money, but they must never give in.<ref>''Invicti athletae'', 29 in AAS 1957, 321 ff</ref> The Pope urges his bishops in Poland not to be overwhelmed by the situation but to mix [[courage]] with [[prudence]], and [[knowledge]] with [[wisdom]]: \"Act boldly, but with that Christian promptness of soul which goes hand in hand with prudence, knowledge, and wisdom.

After its [[Czech coup|Communist coup in 1948]], Czechoslovakia expelled the [[Papal]] [[Nuncio]] and closed Catholic seminaries for the formation of priests. [[Prague]] outlawed all religious institutes and Catholic associations and gradually suppressed the Catholic press.<ref>Adrianyi, 525</ref> Attempts were made to divide the clergy into opposing camps by creating a government-controlled association of priests headed by Bishop [[Joseph Plojhar]]. Archbishop [[Josef Beran]] and others refused to participate and were subjected to public [[show trial]]s and long incarcerations. In 1949, the governmental \"Church Office\" took complete control of the Catholic Church.\n\n==== Hungary ====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CardinalMindszenty.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Cardinal Mindszenty, New Brunswick, NJ]] -->\nAfter the occupation of Hungary by the [[Red Army]] in 1945, [[socialist]] policies gained ground only gradually in the country. But in the following five years, the Church lost 3.300 [[schools]], numerous [[hospitals]], and [[newspapers]], while 11.500 [[religious]] were asked to leave their convents, monasteries, and institutes.<ref>Adrianyi, 528.</ref> The [[nuncio]] was expelled already in 1945. The Church attempted to come to agreement with the government in 1950, when the continuation of about ten Catholic schools was permitted. The overwhelming experience of Hungarian Catholicism was the public show trials and degradations of Archbishop [[Jozsef Grosz]] and Cardinal [[Jozsef Mindszenty]], which led to a complete exclusion of the Church from all public life and Hungarian society.<ref>Adrianyi 529</ref>\n\n===== Jozsef Mindszenty =====\n[[Jozsef Mindszenty]] had been jailed by the [[Germany|Germans]], freed by the Soviet army, and was ordained [[Bishop]] in 1944. After the communist party coup in Hungary, a reign of [[state terrorism|terror]] backed by the Soviet army was instituted<ref name=\"Cornwell 333\"/> Pope Pius XII named Mindzenty [[Primate of Hungary]] and admitted him to the [[College of Cardinals]] in 1946. \"After a propaganda campaign, he was arrested on charges of collaboration with the Nazis, spying, treason, and [[currency]] [[fraud]]. None of the accusations were true. He was [[torture]]d mentally and physically and beaten daily with rubber truncheons until he signed a [[Confession (religion)|confession]]. His show trial was condemned by the [[United Nations]].  \"The trumped up proceedings, fully reported in the West, gripped and horrified Catholics the world over.\"<ref name=\"Cornwell 333\"/> The Cardinal remained in prison until 1956 when he was freed. during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]]. After the failure of the revolution, he lived in the American embassy for the following 15 years.\n\n==== Romania, Bulgaria and Albania ====\n[[File:Blaj s3.jpg|thumb|Sf\u00e2nta Treime Romanian Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral]]\n[[File:Blaj s2.jpg|thumb|The interior of the Sf\u00e2nta Treime Romanian Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral]]\n\nAfter World War I, Romania inherited large parts of Catholic Hungary including large Catholic populations, which were not always treated well between the wars.<ref>Adryani 530</ref> The [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''Solemmni Conventione'' of 1930 includes a [[concordat]] between Romania and the Vatican.<ref>AAS 1930, 381</ref> It allowed for four dioceses and free exercise of religion within the country. Because of rival interpretations the concordat was reenacted ten years later in 1940. In 1948, the Communist government withdrew from the concordat and closed most Catholic institutes. Only two small dioceses were permitted to continue, and the others considered non-existent.<ref>Adrianyi,531</ref> The six united bishops and several Latin rite bishops were jailed to long sentences. All schools were closed and Catholic activities outlawed.<ref>Adrianyi,532.</ref><ref>''[[Orientales Ecclesias]]'', Acta Apostolicae Sedis (AAS), Roma, Vaticano, 1953, 5.</ref>\n\nBulgaria became a [[People's Republic]] on 15 October 1946. The new [[constitution]] of 1947 limited religious activities. Massive Church persecution followed. The Church lost all its bishops, organizations, and religious institutes. Most of the priests and religious perished within five years,<ref>Adrianyi, 536</ref> many of them in Siberia.\n\nIn Albania, the Communist government assumed the role of liberator, since the country was under [[Italy|Italian]] [[Military occupation|occupation]] since 1939. The Catholic Church was denounced as the Church of the [[oppression|oppressor]]s. All foreign priests and religious were expelled. Domestic bishops, priests, and religious were killed, jailed, or sent to unknown destinations. As in other countries, a peace-loving national Church was attempted as well. The government prided itself on having eradicated religion and closed every Catholic Church.<ref>Adrianyi,536</ref>\n\n==== Yugoslavia ====\nAfter defining relations with the [[Orthodox Church]] in 1929, [[Muslim]]s in 1931, and [[Protestant]]s and [[Jew]]s in 1933, a [[Concordat]] was signed in 1935 between Yugoslavia and the Vatican. After the Orthodox Church excommunicated all politicians involved in its parliamentary passing, the government withdrew the text from final vote in the upper house. De Facto however, the spirit of the concordat was accepted and the Church began to flourish in the years prior to World War II.<ref>Adrianyi,533</ref> The war was difficult for the Church, as the country was largely occupied by Italian and German forces. The [[Independent State of Croatia]], which declared independence from the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], was open to the needs of the Church, which led to open [[collaboration]] of several Church officials with Croatian government policies.\n\nAfter the war, the systematic persecution of the Church began as it did in all the other Communist countries. Some 1300 of the clergy was assassinated. including 139 Franciscan friars. and 50% of the clergy was jailed.<ref>Adrianyi,534</ref> As in Czechoslovakia and other countries, Belgrade created government-controlled organizations of priests, in an attempt to divide the clergy. A major bone of contention was [[Aloysius Stepinac]], who was elevated to the College of Cardinals in 1953. To President Tito \"a provocation\", this represented to Pope Pius \"a just recognition of his extraordinary merits and a symbol of our affection and encouragement for our beloved sons and daughters, who testify to their faith with steadfastness and courage in very difficult times.\" Pius explained that he did not intend to insult the Yugoslavian authorities, but neither did he agree with any of the unjust accusations which resulted in the punishment of the Archbishop.<ref>Pio XII Discorsi, 1952, January 12, 1953</ref> Stepinac was not permitted to receive the red hat in Rome and remained under house arrest (unable to participate in the 1958 conclave) until his death in 1960. [[Pope John Paul II]] beatified him. After his death, relations to the Vatican improved significantly. In 1974, the Church in Yugoslavia counted 15,500 priests, religious, and nuns<ref>HK 1977,318\u2013324</ref>\n\n=== Persecution of religious institutes ===\n[[Religious institute]]s and institutions are historically visible targets in time of conflict and strife. Their houses, convents or monasteries were looted, burned or destroyed throughout Europe for centuries in virtually all European countries. The beginning of the pontificate of Pius XII coincided with the end of the Civil War in Spain, in which, in addition to thousands of faithful, some 4184 secular priests, 2365 religious and 283 female religious were killed within a three-year period.<ref>Dammertz 375</ref>\n\nIn World War II, the [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]] of Poland suffered from an exceptionally brutal German occupation.

One hundred and seventy priests were deported to gulags.<ref>Dammertz 378</ref> However, after a change of government in 1956, the condition of the Church improved.

All religious houses in the Ukraine were confiscated and their inhabitants either jailed or sent home. All religious houses were confiscated and closed in Lithuania as well. In Albania, all religious orders were forcibly closed. In Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, all monasteries and religious institutes were erased after 1950.<ref>Dammertz 377</ref> In Hungary, 10,000 members of religious orders were ordered to leave their residences within three months.

In [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], numerous religious figures were killed, among them 139 Franciscan priests. However, as Yugoslavia distanced itself increasingly from Moscow, significant improvements were noticed in [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] during the last two years of the Pacelli pontificate.

Church}}\nPersecutions against the [[Catholic Church]] took place throughout the pontificate of [[Pope Pius XII]] (1939-1958). Pius' reign coincided with the [[World War II|Second World War]], the commencement of the [[Cold War]] and the accelerating European [[Decolonization of Africa|decolonisation]]. During this time, the Catholic Church faced persecution under [[Fascism|Fascist]] and [[Communism|Communist]] governments.\n\nThe Nazi persecution of the church was at its most extreme in [[German-occupied Poland|Occupied Poland]]. The defeat of Fascism at the end of [[World War Two|World War II]] ended one set of persecutions, but strengthened the position of Communism throughout the world, intensifying a further set of persecutions \u2013 notably in [[Eastern Europe]], the [[USSR]], and, later, the [[People's Republic of China]]. The Catholic Church was under attack in all [[Communist]] governed countries and lost most of its existence in [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Romania]], Communist China and the Soviet Union (including [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]).\n\n== Summary ==\nThe pontificate of Pius XII coincided with the Second World War (1939-1945) and the early stages of the Cold War. The Catholic Church was repressed under the Nazi Empire and then under the Soviet dominated Communist states established in Eastern and Central Europe following the war. The Catholic Church in Germany was systematically repressed by the Nazis and persecution was at its most severe in Nazi occupied Poland, where churches, seminaries, monasteries and convents were systematically closed and thousands of priests and nuns were either murdered, imprisoned or deported.\n\nAccording to [[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]], the Church was faced with a dilemma: compromise with the governments in order to maintain a structure with which to survive, or resist or confront and risk annihilation.<ref name=\"Cornwell 333\">Cornwell 333</ref> To save its faithful, the Vatican attempted both at varying times.\n\nIn [[East Germany]] and [[Hungary]], the Church was subjected to ongoing attacks, but was able to continue some of its activities, however on a much reduced scale. In [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Hungary]], persecution continued to the point that the Church faced extinction. In the Soviet Union and mainland China, the Catholic Church largely ceased to exist, at least publicly, during the [[pontificate]] of Pope Pius XII.\n\n==Fascist persecutions==\n===Nazi persecutions===\n\n====Germany====\n\nThe Catholic Church had been a leading opponent of the rise of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] through the 1920s and early 1930s. Upon taking power in 1933, and despite the [[Reichskonkordat|Concordat]] it signed with the church promising the contrary, the Nazi Government of [[Adolf Hitler]] began suppressing the Catholic Church as part of an overall policy of to eliminate competing sources of authority. The Nazis arrested thousands of members of the German [[Centre Party (Germany)|Catholic Centre Party]] as well as Catholic clergymen and closed Catholic schools and institutions. As the [[Third Reich]] expanded, thousands more Catholic priests were imprisoned or killed and Catholic institutions disbanded by the Nazis.<ref>http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/about/01/non_jews_persecution.asp</ref>\n\nAccording to Hitler's biographer [[Alan Bullock]], Hitler was a \"man who believed neither in God nor in conscience ('a Jewish invention, a blemish like circumcision')\".<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p216</ref> Bullock wrote: Hitler thought that Catholic teachings, taken to their conclusion, \"would mean the systematic cultivation of the human failure\".<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p218</ref> Bullock adds that \"once the war was over, [Hitler] promised himself, he would root out and destroy the influence of the Christian churches, but until then he would be circumspect\":<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p219</ref>\n\n{{quote|Hitler had been brought up a Catholic and was impressed by the organisation and power of the Church.

Smuggled into Germany to avoid prior censorship and read from the pulpits of all German Catholic churches, it condemned Nazi ideology<ref>Frattini, p. 230</ref> as \"insane and arrogant\".

As previously with Germany under the National Socialist government, Pope Pius refused to break diplomatic relations with Communist authorities.<ref>Before 1939, as Secretary of State, he had debated this point with [[Pope Pius XI]]. Pacelli argued, that a break of diplomatic relations means losing all contacts with the local hierarchy and, eventually, paying a much higher price:\n\n* Pius XI asked me, how can the [[Holy See]]  keep its [[nuncio]] there?  This is against our honour. I answered: Your Holiness,  what do we do afterwards? How do we maintain any contacts with our bishops?  He understood and calmed down. (Actes et documents Vol II, p.424)</ref>\n\nThus, after World War II, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] kept its nuncios in Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, [[Romania]] and China, until these countries severed relations interrupting communication with bishops as well. The Vatican responded by giving local bishops unprecedented authority to deal with authorities on their own, but without granting the right to define overall relations, viewed as the sole privilege of the Holy See.<ref>Letter of Monsignor Tardini to the Archbishop of Belgrad, 2 16, 1952, in HK VII, 1952 447</ref> In encyclicals such as ''[[Invicti athletae]]'', and Apostolic letters to Czech Bishops, Polish Bishops, the Bishops of Hungary, China, and Romania,<ref>Czechoslovakia AAS 1948 33, Poland AAS 1949 29,    Hungary AAS 1952 249, China AAS 1952 153, Romania AAS 1947, 223</ref> the Pope encouraged local bishops to be firm, modest and wise in their dealings with the new communist authorities.

Nevertheless, the Vatican was not successful in blocking episcopal enthronements by the governments of China and Czechoslovakia. These persons were not excommunicated, however. In his last encyclical [[Ad Apostolorum Principis|''Ad Apostolorum Principis'']] to the bishops of China, Pope Pius XII expressed the opinion that schismatic bishops and priests are the final step towards total elimination of the Catholic Church in that country.<ref>AAS 1958 601</ref> Questions were raised as to why the Vatican appointed powerful but often inexperienced American bishops as nuncios in some Eastern countries, given the anti-American, anti-imperialist tendencies in these countries.<ref>see Stehle, Ostpolitik</ref> While there is no documentation on Vatican motives, a possible reason could be the relative security of US nationals in foreign countries.\n\n=== Persecutions and Church policies ===\n==== China ====\n[[File:Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur de Shizhi.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sacred Heart Cathedral of Guangzhou]]]]\n{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and China}}\n\nFor centuries, access to the people of China was difficult for the Catholic Church, because it did not recognize local [[Confucian]] customs of honouring deceased family members. To the Chinese, this was an [[ancient]] [[ritual]]; to the Vatican it was a [[religious]] exercise which conflicted with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[dogma]]. As a result, the Church made little progress in China. Within months of his election, Pope Pius issued a dramatic change in policies. On 8 December 1939 the Sacred Congregation of the Propagation of Faith issued, at the request of Pius XII, a new instruction by which Chinese customs were no longer considered [[superstitious]], but an honourable way of esteeming ones relatives and therefore permitted by Catholic Christians.<ref>Smit 186\u2013187.</ref> The [[Government of the Republic of China|Government of China]] established diplomatic relations with the Vatican in 1943. The Papal degree changed the [[ecclesiastical]] situation in China in an almost revolutionary way.<ref>Smit 188</ref> As the Church began to flourish, [[Pius XII]] established a local ecclesiastical hierarchy and received the Archbishop of Peking, [[Thomas Tien Ken-sin]], SVD, into the Sacred [[College of Cardinals]].<ref>Smit 188.</ref>\n\nAfter World War II, about four million Chinese were members of the Catholic faith. This was less than one percent of the population but numbers increased dramatically. In 1949, there existed 20 archdioceses, 85 dioceses, 39 apostolic prefectures, 3080 foreign missionaries, 2557 Chinese priests.<ref>Giovanetti 230</ref>\n\nThe establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949 put these early advances on hold and led to the [[persecution]] of thousands of clergy and faithful in China. A patriotic Chinese Church was formed. Since that time, the persecuted Catholic Church exists as a tiny fraction in secrecy and underground only. The losses were considerable. For example, in 1948, the Catholic Church had operated some 254 orphanages and 196 hospitals with 81,628 beds.<ref>Herder Korrespondenz 5, 201</ref> Catholic clergy experienced increased supervision. Bishops and priests were forced to engage in degrading menial jobs to earn their living. Foreign missionaries were accused of being foreign agents who would turn the country over to imperialist forces.<ref>Giovanetti 232</ref>\n\n====Soviet Union====\n{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and Russia}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lemko church.jpg|thumb|The Shelesto St Michael's wooden church (1777) is a classic example of Ruthenian architecture.]] -->\n\nRelations between Soviet authorities and the Vatican were always difficult.

[[Pius XI]] followed this line with numerous statements<ref>AAS 29, 1937, 67</ref> and the encyclicals ''[[Miserentissimus Redemptor]],<ref>AAS 20 1928 165\u2013178</ref> Caritate Christi,<ref>AAS 24 1932 177\u2013194</ref> and [[Divini Redemptoris]]''.<ref>AAS 29, 1937 65\u2013106</ref> The pontificate of Pius XII from the very beginning faced problems, as large parts of Poland, the [[Baltic States]], and their Catholic populations were incorporated into the [[USSR]]. At once, the United Catholic Churches of [[Armenia]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Ruthenia]] were attacked.\n\n==== Catholic Ruthenian and Ukrainian Churches ====\nSoviet attempts to separate the United Churches from Rome reflected not only Soviet policy, but were a continuation of centuries-old Russian policies towards the papacy, already viewed as [[anti-Russian]].<ref>see main article, Pope Pius IX, Pope Leo XIII</ref> Pius also was aware that, in months preceding the [[encyclical]] ''[[Orientales omnes Ecclesias]]'', all Catholic bishops of the Ukrainian Church had been arrested, including [[Josyf Slipyj]], [[Gregory Chomysyn, John Laysevkyi, Nicolas Carneckyi, Josaphat Kocylovskyi]]. Some, including Bishop Nicetas Budka, perished in Siberia.<ref>Giovannetti, 131</ref> Subjected to Stalinist [[Show Trials]], they all received severe sentencing. The remaining leaders of the hierarchies and heads of all seminaries and episcopal offices were arrested and tried in 1945 and 1946.\n\nWith the Catholic Church robbed of its leadership, a \"spontaneous movement\" for separation from Rome and unification with the Russian Orthodox Church developed. [[Mass arrest]]s of priests followed. In [[Lemko]], some five hundred priests were jailed in 1945<ref>Giovannetti, 90</ref> or sent to a Gulag, officially called \"an unknown destination because of political reasons\".<ref>Smit, 174</ref> Church institutions were confiscated and expropriated; churches, monasteries and seminaries were closed and looted,<ref>Adrianyi, 517</ref> Catholic United Churches were integrated under the [[Moscow Patriarchy]] after all residing bishops and apostolic administrators were arrested.<ref>Adrianyi, 518</ref> The Catholic Church of the Ukraine was thus liquidated and its properties turned over to the Orthodox Church under the [[Patriarch of Moscow]].\n\nAfter Joseph Stalin died in 1953, \"[[peaceful coexistence]]\" became the subject of numerous discussions. In his Christmas Message of 1954, Pius XII defined possibilities and preconditions for it. He indicated Vatican willingness to practical [[cooperation]] whenever possible in the interest of the faithful. The slow pace of de[[-Stalinisation]] and the Soviet crack-down of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] thwarted major results aside from modest improvements in Poland and Yugoslavia after 1956. In January 1958, Soviet Foreign Minister [[Andrey Gromyko]] expressed the willingness of Moscow to have formal relations with the Vatican, in light of the position of Pope Pius XII on world peace and the uses of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, a position which was called identical with [[Kremlin]] policy.<ref>Giovannetti,  88</ref>\n\n==== Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia ====\nThe small Catholic churches of Estonia and the Church in Latvia were completely annihilated after the Soviet Union reintegrated these countries into its territory in 1945. All Church organizations were outlawed and all bishops jailed.<ref>Adrianyi, 514.</ref>\n\nIn 1939, Pope Pius received the ambassador of [[Lithuania]] for a final meeting prior to the Soviet occupation. At the outbreak of World War II there were 800 parishes, 1500 priests, and 600 candidates for the priesthood in four seminaries in Lithuania. As a part of the Soviet crackdown, the complete hierarchy, a large part of the clergy and about a third of the Catholic population was deported.<ref>Adrianyi, 515</ref>\n\n==== Poland ====\n{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and Poland}}\n[[File:Wyszy\u0144ski.jpg|thumb|right|Stefan Cardinal Wyszy\u0144ski was arrested from 1953 to 1956]]\n\nWith the war over, the Pope discontinued his war-time policy of neutrality, stating that he had abstained from protests during the war in spite of massive persecutions.<ref>Giovannetti, 139</ref> The Communist Party of Poland assumed governmental control in 1947, and began to confiscate Church properties in the months thereafter. By late 1947, Catholic educational institutes, kindergartens, schools, and orphanages were expropriated as well. Starting in 1948, mass arrest and show trials began to take place against Catholic bishops and clergy. Pope Pius XII responded with an apostolic letter ''Flagranti Semper Animi'',<ref>January 18, 1948, AAS 1948, 324</ref> in which he defended the Church against attacks and Stalinist persecution tactics. However, pressures against the Church increased with the de facto outlawing of religious meetings and organizations. Pope Pius responded with a letter commemorating the 10th anniversary of the beginning of World War II, [[Decennium Dum Expletur]]. He writes that while the Polish people had suffered like nobody else during the war, the suffering continues ten years afterwards. [[Cum Jam Lustri|''Cum Jam Lustri'']] commemorates the death of two Polish Cardinals, Hlond and Sapieha, and encourages the Church in Poland. In honour of [[Stanislaus of Szczepan\u00f3w|Saint Stanis\u0142aw]], Pope Pius XII issued [[Poloniae Annalibus|''Poloniae Annalibus'']], giving consolation and again expressing his certitude that Christ will win and the persecution will end. By 1952 some 1000 priests were incarcerated, all seminaries closed, and [[religious institute]]s dissolved.<ref>Giovannetti, 150</ref> On 19 November 1953 the pontiff addressed the [[Diplomatic Corps|diplomatic corps]] to issue a protest against the incarceration of Cardinal [[Stefan Wyszynski]].<ref>AAS, 1953, 755</ref> After the arrest of the cardinal, authorities supported patriotic priests who were open to separation from Rome. At the 300th anniversary of the successful defence of [[Jasna G\u00f3ra]], Pope Pius XII wrote again to Poland, congratulating the courageous defenders of the faith in his time. [[Gloriosam Reginam|''Gloriosam Reginam'']] salutes the modern day Polish martyrs and expresses confidence in victory for Mary, Queen of Poland. He salutes Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski upon his return from arrest in October 1956.\n\nWith ''[[Invicti athletae]] i''n 1957, Pope Pius addressed in strong words the Polish episcopate for the 300th. anniversary of the martyrdom of [[Saint]] [[Andrew Bobola]] by the Russians: \"The haters of God and enemies of Christian teaching attack Jesus Christ and his Church.\" The Pope counselled endurance and bravery. The people and clergy must overcome many obstacles, with sacrifices of time and money, but they must never give in.<ref>''Invicti athletae'', 29 in AAS 1957, 321 ff</ref> The Pope urges his bishops in Poland not to be overwhelmed by the situation but to mix [[courage]] with [[prudence]], and [[knowledge]] with [[wisdom]]: \"Act boldly, but with that Christian promptness of soul which goes hand in hand with prudence, knowledge, and wisdom. Keep Catholic faith and unity.\"<ref>''Invicti athletae'', 34,  in AAS 1957, 321</ref>\n==== Czechoslovakia ====\n\"They can take away your freedom, but they cannot tear the Catholic faith from your hearts. They can turn you into martyrs, but they can never turn you into traitors.\"<ref>AAS, XXXVII, 1945, 252</ref> In 1945, the [[Czechoslovakian]] government expelled its [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] and [[Germans|German]] populations from Czechoslovakian territories, thus greatly reducing the percentage of [[Catholics]] in the country. After its [[Czech coup|Communist coup in 1948]], Czechoslovakia expelled the [[Papal]] [[Nuncio]] and closed Catholic seminaries for the formation of priests. [[Prague]] outlawed all religious institutes and Catholic associations and gradually suppressed the Catholic press.<ref>Adrianyi, 525</ref> Attempts were made to divide the clergy into opposing camps by creating a government-controlled association of priests headed by Bishop [[Joseph Plojhar]]. Archbishop [[Josef Beran]] and others refused to participate and were subjected to public [[show trial]]s and long incarcerations. In 1949, the governmental \"Church Office\" took complete control of the Catholic Church.\n\n==== Hungary ====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CardinalMindszenty.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Cardinal Mindszenty, New Brunswick, NJ]] -->\nAfter the occupation of Hungary by the [[Red Army]] in 1945, [[socialist]] policies gained ground only gradually in the country. But in the following five years, the Church lost 3.300 [[schools]], numerous [[hospitals]], and [[newspapers]], while 11.500 [[religious]] were asked to leave their convents, monasteries, and institutes.<ref>Adrianyi, 528.</ref> The [[nuncio]] was expelled already in 1945. The Church attempted to come to agreement with the government in 1950, when the continuation of about ten Catholic schools was permitted. The overwhelming experience of Hungarian Catholicism was the public show trials and degradations of Archbishop [[Jozsef Grosz]] and Cardinal [[Jozsef Mindszenty]], which led to a complete exclusion of the Church from all public life and Hungarian society.<ref>Adrianyi 529</ref>\n\n===== Jozsef Mindszenty =====\n[[Jozsef Mindszenty]] had been jailed by the [[Germany|Germans]], freed by the Soviet army, and was ordained [[Bishop]] in 1944. After the communist party coup in Hungary, a reign of [[state terrorism|terror]] backed by the Soviet army was instituted<ref name=\"Cornwell 333\"/> Pope Pius XII named Mindzenty [[Primate of Hungary]] and admitted him to the [[College of Cardinals]] in 1946. \"After a propaganda campaign, he was arrested on charges of collaboration with the Nazis, spying, treason, and [[currency]] [[fraud]]. None of the accusations were true. He was [[torture]]d mentally and physically and beaten daily with rubber truncheons until he signed a [[Confession (religion)|confession]]. His show trial was condemned by the [[United Nations]].   \"The trumped up proceedings, fully reported in the West, gripped and horrified Catholics the world over.\"<ref name=\"Cornwell 333\"/> The Cardinal remained in prison until 1956 when he was freed. during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]]. After the failure of the revolution, he lived in the American embassy for the following 15 years.\n\n==== Romania, Bulgaria and Albania ====\n[[File:Blaj s3.jpg|thumb|Sf\u00e2nta Treime Romanian Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral]]\n[[File:Blaj s2.jpg|thumb|The interior of the Sf\u00e2nta Treime Romanian Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral]]\n\nAfter World War I, Romania inherited large parts of Catholic Hungary including large Catholic populations, which were not always treated well between the wars.<ref>Adryani 530</ref> The [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''Solemmni Conventione'' of 1930 includes a [[concordat]] between Romania and the Vatican.<ref>AAS 1930, 381</ref> It allowed for four dioceses and free exercise of religion within the country. Because of rival interpretations the concordat was reenacted ten years later in 1940. In 1948, the Communist government withdrew from the concordat and closed most Catholic institutes. Only two small dioceses were permitted to continue, and the others considered non-existent.<ref>Adrianyi,531</ref> The six united bishops and several Latin rite bishops were jailed to long sentences. All schools were closed and Catholic activities outlawed.<ref>Adrianyi,532.</ref><ref>''[[Orientales Ecclesias]]'', Acta Apostolicae Sedis (AAS), Roma, Vaticano, 1953, 5.</ref>\n\nBulgaria became a [[People's Republic]] on 15 October 1946. The new [[constitution]] of 1947 limited religious activities. Massive Church persecution followed. The Church lost all its bishops, organizations, and religious institutes. Most of the priests and religious perished within five years,<ref>Adrianyi, 536</ref> many of them in Siberia.\n\nIn Albania, the Communist government assumed the role of liberator, since the country was under [[Italy|Italian]] [[Military occupation|occupation]] since 1939. The Catholic Church was denounced as the Church of the [[oppression|oppressor]]s. All foreign priests and religious were expelled. Domestic bishops, priests, and religious were killed, jailed, or sent to unknown destinations. As in other countries, a peace-loving national Church was attempted as well. The government prided itself on having eradicated religion and closed every Catholic Church.<ref>Adrianyi,536</ref>\n\n==== Yugoslavia ====\nAfter defining relations with the [[Orthodox Church]] in 1929,  [[Muslim]]s in 1931, [[Protestant]]s and [[Jew]]s in 1933, a [[Concordat]] was signed in 1935 between Yugoslavia and the Vatican. After the Orthodox Church excommunicated all politicians involved in its parliamentary passing, the government withdrew the text from final vote in the upper house. De Facto however, the spirit of the concordat was accepted and the Church began to flourish in the years prior to World War II.<ref>Adrianyi,533</ref> The war was difficult for the Church, as the country was largely occupied by Italian and German forces. The [[Independent State of Croatia]], which declared independence from the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], was open to the needs of the Church, which led to open [[collaboration]] of several Church officials with Croatian government policies.\n\nAfter the war, the systematic persecution of the Church began as it did in all the other socialist countries. Some 1300 of the clergy was assassinated among them 139 Franciscan friar, 50% of the clergy was jailed.<ref>Adrianyi,534</ref> As in Czechoslovakia and other countries, Belgrade created government-controlled organizations of priests, in an attempt to divide the clergy. A major bone of contention was [[Aloysius Stepinac]], who was elevated to the College of Cardinals in 1953. To President Tito \"a provocation\", this represented to Pope Pius \"a just recognition of his extraordinary merits and a symbol of our affection and encouragement for our beloved sons and daughters, who testify their faith with steadfastness and courage in very difficult times. The Pope explained that he did not intend to insult the Yugoslavian authorities, but neither did he agree with any of the unjust accusations which resulted in the punishment of the Archbishop.<ref>Pio XII Discorsi, 1952, January 12, 1953</ref> Stepinac was not permitted to receive the red hat in Rome, and remained under house arrest (unable to participate in the 1958 conclave) until his death in 1960. [[Pope John Paul II]] beatified him. After his death, relations to the Vatican improved significantly. In 1974, the Church in Yugoslavia counted 15500 priests, religious and nuns<ref>HK 1977,318\u2013324</ref>\n\n=== Persecution of religious institutes ===\n[[Religious institute]]s and institutions are historically visible targets in time of conflict and strife. Their houses, convents or monasteries were looted, burned or destroyed throughout Europe for centuries in virtually all European countries. The beginning of the pontificate of Pius XII coincided with the end of the Civil War in Spain, in which, in addition to thousands of faithful, some 4184 secular priests, 2365 religious and 283 female religious were killed within a three-year period.<ref>Dammertz 375</ref>\n\nIn World War II, the [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]] of Poland suffered from an exceptionally brutal German occupation. A 1940 thirteen-point program provided that \"all religious institutes, convents and monasteries will be closed because they do not reflect German morality and population policy.\"<ref>Dammertz 376</ref> The German policy, to treat Poles as subhuman \"Untermenschen\", was especially brutal against representatives of religious orders. [[Gestapo]] raids let to the murdering, assassination and deportation to concentration camps of numerous religious, including the Franciscan friar [[Maximilian Kolbe]].\n[[File:Chapel of Saint Kazimieras with his sarcophagus in Vilnius Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Chapel of [[Saint Casimir]] with his coffin in Vilnius, Lithuania]]\nIn the [[Dachau concentration camp]] alone, some 2800 Polish priests and religious were incarcerated, of whom approximately 1000 were killed or died of hunger. Between April and October 1942, 500 Polish religious died in Dachau, in part due to mistreatment, hunger or the gas chambers.<ref name=\"HK 1960, 27\">HK 1960, 27</ref> Long-time inmate Bishop Kozlowiecki reports: \"What a happy day, if I was beaten only once or twice\". Especially brutal was Holy Week in 1942. One thousand and eight hundred Polish priests and religious went through punishment drills and exercises uninterrupted from morning to night every day.<ref name=\"HK 1960, 27\"/> Pope Pius XII informed the cardinals in 1945 that among all the horrors, which priests and religious had to endure in concentration camps, the fate of Polish inmates was by far the worst.<ref>Pio XII, Discorsi VII, 1945,  Roma, Vaticano, 74</ref>\n\nAfter 1945, Poland was resurrected, but the Polish government continued the attacks against the Catholic Church. All religious were forced to leave hospitals and educational institutions, their properties were confiscated. Within seven years, fifty-four religious were killed. One hundred and seventy priests were deported to gulags.<ref>Dammertz 378</ref> However, after a change of government in 1956, the condition of the Church improved. Harassment and persecution of the Church continued but religious vocations were permitted and Poland became the only Eastern country which contributed in great numbers religious missionaries to worldwide service.<ref>Dammertz 379</ref>\n\nIn all East European countries, after World War II, persecution of religious assumed new dimensions. All religious houses in the Ukraine were confiscated and their inhabitants either jailed or sent home. All religious houses were confiscated and closed in Lithuania as well. In Albania, all religious orders were forcibly closed. In Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, all monasteries and religious institutes were erased after 1950.<ref>Dammertz 377</ref> In Hungary, 10,000 members of religious orders were ordered to leave their residences within three months. Some 300 were permitted to remain.<ref>Dammertz 378</ref> The Hungarian hierarchy entered an agreement with the authorities, which permitted the reopening of eight Catholic schools<ref>Galter, 345\u2013353,</ref><ref>Herder Korrespondenz, 5, 1950, 33</ref>\n\nIn [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]], all orders were closed after the war and properties confiscated. In [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], numerous religious figures were killed, among them 139 Franciscan priests. However, as Yugoslavia distanced itself increasingly from Moscow, significant improvements were noticed in [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] during the last two years of the Pacelli pontificate. In China and [[North Korea]] Catholic religious no longer existed. Foreign missionaries were expelled, the fate of most local religious is unknown.<ref>Dammertz 379</ref>\n\n== Decrees of the Holy Office on Communism ==\n{{Main article|Decree against Communism}}\nThe Vatican, having been silent during the war on communist excesses, displayed a harder line on communism after 1945.\n\n== Encyclicals of Pope Pius XII on Church persecutions ==\nThe name of a Papal Encyclical is always taken from its [[incipit|first two or three words]].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2| No.\n! colspan=2| Title\n! rowspan=2| Subject\n! rowspan=2| Date\n! rowspan=2| Text\n|-\n!

Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762 at [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]], the second son of Francis Cooke, an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife Margaret.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{Ref label|A|a|none}} John Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{r|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Coloured print of a naval battle between sailing ships. Four ships seen stern on in the right of the picture, obscured by clouds of smoke, a fifth ship seen bow on in the left.|''Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\n[[File:Goodman's fields on Roque's map 1746.png|thumb|left|upright=1|The [[Tenterground]] in [[Goodman's Fields]] marked on [[John Rocque's Map of London, 1746]]]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home.{{r|\"CW:49\"}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active. I like his appearance very much.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}} A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the [[National Maritime Museum]].{{r|\"National Archives\"}}\n\nCooke had married Louisa, n\u00e9e Hardy, on 15 June 1790 at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]]. Louisa was the fourth daughter of [[Josiah Hardy]], the former Governor of New Jersey, and later consul at Cadiz.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa died at her home, 9 Montpellier Terrace, [[Montpellier, Cheltenham]], on 5 February 1853 aged 96.{{r|\"LC:Death\"}} The funeral was held at [[St Peter's Church, Leckhampton]], on 11 February 1853, with interment following in the churchyard.{{r|\"LC:Funeral\"}} Louisa Charlotte Cooke, their only child, was born on 26 January 1797 at [[Stoke Damerel]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa Charlotte married Abraham John Newenham Devonsher of Kilshanick, County Cork, at Cheltenham, on 9 March 1820.{{r|LCC:Marriage}} She died after a short illness at St. Anne\u2019s, Albion Street, Cheltenham, on 30 April 1871 aged 74.{{r|LCC:Death}} She was interred at Bouncer's Lane Cemetery, [[Prestbury, Gloucestershire|Prestbury]], on 5 May 1871.{{r|\"LCC:Funeral\"}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} A number of sources, including T.

Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762 at [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]], the second son of Francis Cooke, an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife Margaret.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{Ref label|A|a|none}} John Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{r|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Coloured print of a naval battle between sailing ships. Four ships seen stern on in the right of the picture, obscured by clouds of smoke, a fifth ship seen bow on in the left.|''Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\n[[File:Goodman's fields on Roque's map 1746.png|thumb|left|upright=1|The [[Tenterground]] in [[Goodman's Fields]] marked on [[John Rocque's Map of London, 1746]]]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home.{{r|\"CW:49\"}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active. I like his appearance very much.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}} A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the [[National Maritime Museum]].{{r|\"National Archives\"}}\n\nCooke had married Louisa, n\u00e9e Hardy, on 15 June 1790 at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]]. Louisa was the fourth daughter of [[Josiah Hardy]], the former Governor of New Jersey, and later consul at Cadiz.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa died at her home, 9 Montpellier Terrace, [[Montpellier, Cheltenham]], on 5 February 1853 aged 96.{{r|\"LC:Death\"}} The funeral was held at [[St Peter's Church, Leckhampton]], on 11 February 1853, with interment following in the churchyard.{{r|\"LC:Funeral\"}} Louisa Charlotte Cooke, their only child, was born on 26 January 1797 at [[Stoke Damerel]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa Charlotte married Abraham John Newenham Devonsher of Kilshanick, County Cork, at Cheltenham, on 9 March 1820.{{r|LCC:Marriage}} She died after a short illness at St. Anne\u2019s, Albion Street, Cheltenham, on 30 April 1871 aged 74.{{r|LCC:Death}} She was interred at Bouncer's Lane Cemetery, [[Prestbury, Gloucestershire|Prestbury]], on 5 May 1871.{{r|\"LCC:Funeral\"}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} A number of sources, including T.

In 1838, it was replaced by St Anne's Church. At the time, there were only two places of Catholic worship in Leeds, St Patrick's Church (which was built in 1831) and St Anne's. The next church to be built in Leeds was [[Mount St Mary's Church, Leeds|Mount St Mary's Church]] in [[Richmond Hill, Leeds|Richmond Hill]].<ref>Fraser, Derek, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4Da8AAAAIAAJ&pg A History of Modern Leeds] (Manchester: Manchester University press, 1980), 256.</ref>\n\nThe earlier St Anne's Roman Catholic Church, built in 1838 on the corner of the [[Headrow]] and Cookridge Street was granted cathedral status in 1878 upon the creation of the Diocese of Leeds.<ref name=\"St Anne's RC Cathedral\"/> The cathedral's life was short-lived as in 1899, [[Leeds City Council|Leeds Corporation]] pushed ahead with plans to widen The Headrow and develop it into a [[Boulevard]] style street. This meant that the cathedral was acquired by the enactment of a [[compulsory purchase order]]. Demolition started shortly after and the [[Leeds Permanent Building Society]] purchased the plot to build its head-office; the site is now [[The Light, Leeds|The Light]] entertainment complex. Church officials considered several sites on which to build the second cathedral but after exhausting other options, the church accepted land offered to it by the corporation, directly adjacent to the previous church.<ref name=\"History\">{{Citation |url=http://www.dioceseofleeds.org.uk/cathedral/history/history.php|title=History |publisher= Leeds Diocese|accessdate=23 May 2010}}</ref> Some architectural features of the original building were salvaged and reused in the new building and some can now be seen at the Castle-by-the-Sea Hotel in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire]], the former residence of the artist [[Atkinson Grimshaw]] who was the father of the first cathedral choir master, [[Arthur E.

The [[reredos]] of the old cathedral's high altar was designed by [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|Pugin]] in 1842 and moved to the lady chapel of the new cathedral.<ref name=\"Floorplan\">{{Citation|url=http://www.dioceseofleeds.org.uk/cathedral/cathedral_tour/floorplan.php|title=Floorplan|publisher=Leeds Diocese|accessdate=23 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131090709/http://www.dioceseofleeds.org.uk/cathedral/cathedral_tour/floorplan.php|archive-date=31 January 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/leeds/content/articles/2007/02/15/faith_st_annes_reredos_feature.shtml|title=Restoring a masterpiece|work=BBC Leeds|accessdate=31 January 2009}}</ref> The cathedral is a Grade II* [[listed building]].<ref name=\"St Anne's RC Cathedral\">{{NHLE |num=1375230 |desc=St Anne's RC Cathedral |accessdate=23 May 2010 |mode=cs2}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Previous Cathedral===\nIn 1786, Lady Lane Chapel was built, the first post-reformation Catholic place of worship in the city. In 1838, it was replaced by St Anne's Church. At the time, there were only two places of Catholic worship in Leeds, St Patrick's Church (which was built in 1831) and St Anne's. The next church to be built in Leeds was [[Mount St Mary's Church, Leeds|Mount St Mary's Church]] in [[Richmond Hill, Leeds|Richmond Hill]].<ref>Fraser, Derek, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4Da8AAAAIAAJ&pg A History of Modern Leeds] (Manchester: Manchester University press, 1980), 256.</ref>\n\nThe earlier St Anne's Roman Catholic Church, built in 1838 on the corner of the [[Headrow]] and Cookridge Street was granted cathedral status in 1878 upon the creation of the Diocese of Leeds.<ref name=\"St Anne's RC Cathedral\"/> The cathedral's life was short-lived as in 1899, [[Leeds City Council|Leeds Corporation]] pushed ahead with plans to widen The Headrow and develop it into a [[Boulevard]] style street. This meant that the cathedral was acquired by the enactment of a [[compulsory purchase order]]. Demolition started shortly after and the [[Leeds Permanent Building Society]] purchased the plot to build its head-office, the site is now [[The Light, Leeds|The Light]] entertainment complex. Church officials considered several sites on which to build the second cathedral but after exhausting other options, the church accepted land offered to it by the corporation, directly adjacent to the previous church.<ref name=\"History\">{{Citation |url=http://www.dioceseofleeds.org.uk/cathedral/history/history.php|title=History |publisher= Leeds Diocese|accessdate=23 May 2010}}</ref> Some architectural features of the original building were salvaged and reused in the new building and some can now be seen at the Castle-by-the-Sea Hotel in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire]], the former residence of the artist [[Atkinson Grimshaw]] who was the father of the first cathedral choir master, [[Arthur E.

A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], she served in the [[Michigan House of Representatives]] from 2001 to 2006 and in the [[Michigan Senate]] from 2006 to 2015. \n\nBorn and raised in [[Michigan]] as the daughter of two lawyers, Whitmer graduated from [[Forest Hills Central High School]] near [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Michigan State University]], and the [[Michigan State University College of Law]]. She ran unsuccessfully for the state house in the 1990s before being elected in 2000. In 2006 she became a state senator, a position she kept until [[term limit|term limits]] forced her to step down in 2015. She was the Senate's first female Democratic leader from 2011 to 2015. In 2013, Whitmer gained national attention for a floor speech during a debate on [[abortion]] in which she shared her experience of being [[Sexual Assault|sexually assaulted]]. For six months in 2016, she was the [[prosecutor|county prosecutor]] for [[Ingham County, Michigan|Ingham County]].\n\nWhitmer was elected governor in [[2018 Michigan gubernatorial election|the 2018 gubernatorial election]], defeating Republican [[Attorney General of Michigan|Attorney General]] [[Bill Schuette]]. As governor, Whitmer has focused on healthcare and infrastructure, which now appears she was a failure at and wasted tens of millions of dollars in fsiled preperations for emergency pandemics. In February 2020, she was selected to give [[Response to the State of the Union address|the Democratic response]] to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Donald Trump|Donald Trump's]] [[2020 State of the Union Address]]. She is the national co-chairwoman of the [[Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nGretchen Whitmer was born in 1971 in [[Lansing, Michigan]], as the eldest of three children to Sharon H. \"Sherry\" Reisig and Richard Whitmer, who were both lawyers.<ref name=\"LegalNews\">{{cite web|title=Monday Profile: Gretchen Whitmer|url=http://www.oaklandlegalnews.com/washtenaw/1423164|website=LegalNews.com|accessdate=March 2, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/name/sharon-whitmer-obituary?pid=182956096|title=SHARON WHITMER Obituary - Detroit, Michigan &#124; Legacy.com}}</ref> Her father served as head of the state's Department of Commerce under Governor [[William Milliken]] and was the president and [[CEO]] of [[Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan]] between 1988 and 2006.<ref name=\"CRAIN18\">{{cite news |title=Blue Cross takes punches in governor's race |url=http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20180708/news/665536/blue-cross-takes-punches-in-governors-race |accessdate=July 11, 2018 |work=[[Crain's Detroit Business]] |date=July 8, 2018}}</ref> Whitmer's mother worked as an assistant attorney general under [[Michigan Attorney General]] [[Frank J.
