In brutal fighting, the [[77th Indian Infantry Brigade|77th 'Chindit' Brigade]] under Brigadier [[Mike Calvert|Michael Calvert]], later assisted by [[Chinese Expeditionary Force|Chinese forces]] of Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]], fought-for and captured the town from the [[Japanese occupation of Burma|occupying forces]] of [[Imperial Japan]].\n\nThe battle was part of a major [[Chindit]] campaign called [[Chindits#Operation Thursday|Operation ''Thursday'']] which later amalgamated with the [[Siege of Myitkyina]] by Chinese and US forces led by [[Joseph Stilwell]] who was in overall command of the Chindits. The capture of Mogaung was the first place in Burma to be liberated from the Japanese, and it was the last major Chindit campaign of the war. Two [[Victoria Cross]]es were awarded during the battle.<ref name=\"Griffin163\">{{Harvnb|Griffin|2018|pp=163-64}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nIn 1943, Brigadier [[Orde Wingate]] led the Chindits behind Japanese lines for the first of their [[Long-range penetration]] operations with Operation ''Loincloth''. It resulted in little strategic success but it did prove that [[British Empire]] forces could fight on equal terms with the Japanese in the jungle. The following year General [[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|William 'Bill' Slim]] leading the British [[Fourteenth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourteenth Army]] were engaged in a desperate struggle against the Japanese army who had launched [[Operation U-Go]] - the invasion of [[British India]] beginning in March 1944.<ref name=\"Fay262\">{{Harvnb|Fay|1993|p=265}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the Japanese invasion a second Chindit expedition was launched; Operation ''Thursday'' was much larger than the previous years' with six brigades. The aim was to harass the Japanese rear and supply lines as well as to relieve pressure on American General [[Joseph Stilwell|Vinegar 'Joe' Stilwell]]'s joint Chinese and US forces moving south into Northern Burma who were intending to take the strategic town of [[Myitkyina]]. The early operations of the Chindits were marred by the death of Wingate in an air crash. They then went under the command of Major General [[Walter Lentaigne]] but were eventually placed under the command of the [[Anglophobia|Anglophobe]] Stilwell.<ref name=\"McLynn361\">{{Harvnb|McLynn|2011|p=361}}</ref> Once the operation was underway in March, 77 Brigade having held off superior Japanese forces for two months from their stronghold of ''White City''.\n\n===Prelude===\nIn late May they were ordered north by Stilwell to the area of Mogaung to take the pressure off his Chinese forces as they were struggling in [[Siege of Myitkyina|besieging Myitkyina]]. Capturing Mogaung meant that the Japanese lifeline northward would be cut and Myitkyina would inevitably fall. At the end of May, Fourteenth Army intelligence, backed by hazardous patrols from 77 Brigade, found that the Japanese had reinforced the defenders of Mogaung with four battalions from Lieutenant-General Hisashi Takeda's [[53rd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|53rd Division]] to  just under 4,000 troops.<ref name=\"Allen369\">{{Harvnb|Allen |1998|p=369}}</ref> The 77th brigade consisted of four battalions; the [[Lancashire Fusiliers]], [[King's Regiment (Liverpool)|King's Regiment]], [[South Staffordshire Regiment|South Staffordshire's]] and [[6th Queen Elizabeth's Own Gurkha Rifles]]s. Accompanying the brigade were [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] liaison officers who would need high ground for radio contact from which to bring in close air support.<ref name=\"Diamond74\">{{Harvnb|Diamond|2016|p=74}}</ref>\n\nGetting to Mogaung would be difficult for the brigade however. There was no way of flying in and to the North of the town was the fast flowing Mogaung River and to the West diverging off was the Wetthauk Chaung river. The country to the East and South were interspersed by lakes, marshes with the only access being a two mile long Pinhmi road on a causeway. The British would have to use this in order to get there and would come up against villages on the outskirts that had been heavily fortified - with bunkers being constructed under the buildings.<ref name=\"Towill113\">{{Harvnb|Towill 2000|p=114}}</ref>\n\n==Battle==\nOn May 30 the brigade set off; the plan was to advance 160 miles to the town using the Pinhmi road as an axis. Their first priority was for the  need for an area for a small landing strip for evacuating the sick and wounded as well as an area for supplies to be dropped. Calvert had hoped to reach and even capture Mogaung by 5 June.<ref name=\"GibbsRyan141\">{{cite book |last1=Gibbs |first1=Herbert Ronald K |last2=Ryan |first2=D.G.J |title=Historical Record of the 6th Gurkha Rifles, Volume 2 |date=1955 |publisher=Gale & Polden |page=141 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=REoFAAAAMAAJ&q=}}</ref>\n\n===Lakum===\n[[File:Ledo and Sodiya, India- Myitkyina, Myanmar- Batang (Ba), Litang, Gyaltang, Kham, Tibet- Burma Road terminus at Kunming, China 1945 map detail, from- Allied Third Burma Campaign Apri 1-May 1945 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Location of Mogaung in Northern Burma]]\nThe march was difficult - thick jungle intersected by deep ravines and the occasional sporadic firefight with the Japanese. Nevertheless on 2 June the South Staffordshires and the Gurkhas captured the village of [[Lakum]] after a fierce encounter with the Japanese. The village was a low laying hill overlooking the plain two miles south west of Mogaung. On the following day, another series of bitter encounters forced the Japanese off the surrounding hills - the Gurkhas seized a hamlet, later dubbed 'Gurkha Village', after wiping out the forty strong garrison there. They captured intact a large [[ammunition dump]], fifteen lorries and a camouflaged hospital full of medical supplies, as well as many sick Japanese soldiers. Many of these tried to escape without success and many more committed suicide.<ref name=\"Calvert230\">{{Harvnb|Calvert|2004|p=230}}</ref>\n\nCalvert had his headquarters operational just south of Lakum and a small airstrip was hastily laid from which supplies were arranged to be flown in and dropped by [[C-47]]'s.

In Mogaung itself the courthouse and railway station were potential areas for heavy resistance as they were the two main all brick buildings. Over the next few days the brigade got supplied - they were delivered [[PIAT]] anti tank weapons as well as [[Flamethrower, Portable, No 2|flamethrowers]], [[ML 3-inch mortar|3 inch]] and [[ML 4.2-inch mortar|4.2 inch]] mortars with thousands of rounds as the only means of heavy fire support. Japanese artillery was causing casualties but Calvert was eventually able to call in [[P-51 Mustang]]s of 1st Air Commando in an attempt to silence the Japanese positions.<ref name=\"Smith277\">{{Harvnb|Smith|1994|p=277}}</ref>\n\n===Pinhmi bridge and outskirts===\nThe attack on the Pinhmi to Mogaung road where the vital Pinhmi bridge crossed the Wetthauk Chaung river began on 7 June. As they advanced closer to Mogaung the Staffordshires found and destroyed a Japanese ammunition dump and the Lancashire Fusiliers later captured the village of Pinhmi. An attempt on the bridge the following day however failed as the Lancashires were repelled from concealed Japanese positions which ranged along a fifteen foot high embankment incurring heavy casualties.<ref name=\"Kirby408\"/> Nevertheless a reconnaissance patrol found a ford further down the river and from this the Gurkhas and the Staffordshires attacked and secured the village of Mahaung. In addition they also secured the village of Ywathitgale taking out a Japanese administrative headquarters, and reached the Pinhmi\u2013Mogaung road outflanking a number of Japanese positions.<ref name=\"Rooney97\">{{Harvnb|Rooney|1990|pp=97-99}}</ref> They then launched a number of counterattacks but were driven off. On 10 June the Gurkha's attempted to take the bridge again; the first attempt ended in failure but the second in a wide flanking move succeeded in taking the bridge. Among them was Captain [[Michael Allmand]]'s heroic feat in ensuring the capture of the bridge. The attacks cost nearly 130 casualties but Calvert's brigade was securely established along the axis of the Pinhmi-Mogaung road.<ref name=\"Diamond70\">{{Harvnb|Diamond|2016|p=70}}</ref>\n\nThe [[monsoon]] then broke later that day and conditions were tough for the men of 77 Brigade; [[malaria]], [[trench foot]] and [[typhus]] were soon rife.<ref name=\"Allen371\">{{Harvnb|Allen|1998|p=371}}</ref> Calvert learnt that two more Japanese battalions arrived to reinforce Mogaung essentially replacing casualties, and seeing the difficulty he then sent a messenger to Stilwell to alert him to the situation; but was not received with any sympathy. Stilwell eventually sent the 1/114th Chinese Infantry Regiment from the 38th Division to support the Chindits.<ref name=\"Bidwell270\">{{Harvnb|Bidwell|1980|pp=270-71}}</ref> Calvert assessed the situation on June 12; many battalions were reduced to a company which meant the brigade total consisted of no more than 750 fit men. Calvert was concerned with the number of wounded and the sick having to endure the poor conditions - [[Defensive fighting position|slit trenches]] were impossible due to the wet conditions; men would have to lay face down in the mud if they were under shell fire. Many of the wounded however were determined to stay and fight rather than be flown out.<ref name=\"Rooney100\">{{Harvnb|Rooney|1990|pp=100-01}}</ref>\n\nOver the next few days conditions began to improve many of the wounded were flown out and supplies were brought in once more. On June 15 Calvert continued his attacks, fighting to secure a ridge closer to the town. The Court House was taken the next day, and the area extending to the Mogaung River and up to the outskirts of Natgyigon was cleared.<ref name=\"Kirby408\"/> Japanese mortar fire from the village of Naungkaiktaw was causing some grief upon the Chindits. At dawn on June 18 air attacks and a heavy mortar bombardment over the next few days followed by an assault by the Lancashire Fusiliers and the King's attacked using flamethrowers.<ref name=\"Diamond80\">{{Harvnb|Diamond|2016|p=80}}</ref> At the cost of some fifty casualties (some from friendly fire) they succeeded and drove around a hundred Japanese out of the village in addition to killing some seventy of them. Whilst consolidating their position in the village a Japanese patrol was ambushed and taken out; they had not realised the village had been in British hands.<ref name=\"Rooney100\"/>\n\nAround the same time Chinese troops began to arrive; Gurkhas made contact with them West of Lakum. Mogaung was then surrounded, with the Chinese in the South which totalled nearly three battalions. Crucially they had [[Bofors 75 mm mountain gun|75mm mountain guns]] which were established at Pinhmi, and they were able pound Japanese positions.<ref name=\"McLynn352\">{{Harvnb|McLynn|2011|pp=351-52}}</ref>\n\n===Mogaung===\n[[File:Gurkha Captain Michael Allmand VC.jpg|thumb|150px|Gurkha Captain Michael Allmand who won the VC during the Battle of Mogaung]]\nCalvert planned his next attack for 23 June towards Natyigon, a key position and the last outer bastion of Mogaung. At first light on that day the final assault was launched; every available fit man was called up; cooks, orderlies and even Headquarters personnel. The Chinese attacked towards the railway station along the railway embankment which was effectively a last line of defence. Despite a heavy bombardment the attack failed and the Chinese were held back with intense Japanese machine gun fire. The Chindits had no choice but to halt along this line for the remainder of the day.<ref name=\"Bidwell270\"/>\n\nEarlier reconnaissance had pin-pointed the 'Red House', a large bricked building. The following day after a heavy bombardment from the Chinese guns and British mortars as well as air attacks the British attacked from the North of the station. Once once more fighting was intense, the Japanese defending tenaciously despite the constant pounding. The building and surrounding positions were only taken after brutal fighting in which flamethrowers, grenades and PIATs were used.<ref name=\"GibbsRyan143\">Gibbs & Ryan pp. 143-44</ref> One of the men involved was Rifleman [[Tulbahadur Pun]]; his single-handed gallantry as part of the Gurkhas attack on the 'Red House' earned him a nomination for the Victoria Cross. The other nomination fell to Michael Allmand who attacked a machine-gun position holding up his remaining company. He Knocked out the position with grenades but was mortally wounded in the process. The Chinese provided some fire support but did not take part in this attack, instead protecting the flanks and cutting off any Japanese escape attempt. The assault by the Gurkhas totally unbalanced the Japanese and Takeda had no other choice to withdraw or risk his battalions being destroyed.<ref name=\"Corrigan\">{{Harvnb|Corrigan|210|pp=466-67}}</ref>\n\nThe final attack was on the railway station on June 25 - the Chinese attack from the South was postponed but the Lancashires and the South Staffordshires went in anyway and after more heavy fighting finally took the battered remains and met up with the Chinese.<ref name=\"Lunt39\">{{Harvnb|Lunt|1994|p=39}}</ref> With the British having major foothold in the town, the Japanese launched a number of counter attacks that night but they were beaten off. The following morning the Chindit and Chinese patrols found positions outside the town abandoned.<ref name=\"Smith277\"/> Any Japanese that escaped did so by using [[Drum (container)|oil drums]] in the hope they would make it downriver to Myitkyina. Many however were shot up by patrolling Chindits.<ref name=\"Bidwell273\">{{Harvnb|Bidwell|1980|pp=273-74}}</ref>\n\nWith the battle largely over the Chindits consolidated their position in Mogaung but they were physically and mentally exhausted. The brigade at the end of the battle only had less than 550 men left of fighting strength. The Lancashire Fusiliers, King's Regiment and South Staffordshire's between them could only muster 300 between them and the 3/6th Gurkhas had 230 left fit.<ref name=\"Calvert180\">{{Harvnb|Calvert|2004|p=180}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nOnce Mogaung had been captured the Gurkha's garrisoned the town preparing for further counterattacks from across the river but none was forthcoming; the Japanese had left the area completely.<ref name=\"McLynn352\"/> Whilst in Mogaung, the Gurkha's took the opportunity to hold a small ceremonial parade and hoisted the Union Jack on a large [[pagoda]], the most prominent building left standing. The Chindits remained in the area until July 5 and then withdrew to their base area at Pinhmi. They then had to march a further fifty miles to be flown back to India before leaving Mogaung in the hands of the Chinese.<ref name=\"Calvert180\"/>\n\nThe capture of Mogaung was the first place in Burma to be liberated from the Japanese, and it was the last major Chindit campaign of the war.<ref name=\"Griffin163\"/> The Japanese had lost heavily with nearly 1,600 casualties most of whom were dead and and an unknown number of sick that evacuated.<ref name=\"Allen374\"/> The cost of taking Mogaung had been high - Calvert had lost 47 officers and 729 other ranks killed or wounded; which equated to around fifty percent casualties. Stilwell had used the Chindits in an unsuitable role of classic infantry, without the support of artillery and armour. He announced via the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] that Chinese troops of his [[Northern Combat Area Command]] had captured Mogaung but without referencing the British. The Chindits were outraged, and Calvert famously signalled to Stilwell's headquarters 'Chinese reported taking Mogaung. My Brigade now taking umbrage.' Stillwell's son who was the intelligence officer announced that 'Umbrage was so small that I can't find it on the map'.<ref name=\"Rooney105\">{{Harvnb|Rooney|1990|p=105}}</ref>\n\nFearing that they would then be ordered to join the siege of Myitkyina, Calvert shut down his radios and withdrew to [[Kamaing]], where Stilwell had his headquarters. A court-martial was likely until Stilwell and Calvert met in person, and the former finally appreciated the conditions under which the Chindits had been operating.<ref name=\"Allen374\"/> The siege of Myitkyina had already proved a thorn in Stilwell's side after a major Chinese assault had been repelled with heavy losses. The British capture of Mogaung did relieve pressure on Stilwell's troops besieging the town; the Japanese quit Myitkyina on 3 August.<ref name=\"MM\">{{cite book |last1=United States Government |title=Merrill's Marauders, February - May 1944 American forces in action series Volume 100, Issue 4 |date=1990 |publisher=Printing Office Center of Military History |page=113 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4aAfAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA113&dq=}}</ref>\n\nTwo Victoria Crosses were awarded during the battle - Michael Allmand received his [[Posthumous award|posthumously]], while Tul Bahadur Pun received his in November.<ref name=\"Griffin163\"/> In addition members of the Sixth Gurkhas also received two [[Distinguished Service Order|DSOs]], three\n[[Indian Order of Merit|IOMs]], six [[Military Cross|MCs]], four [[Indian Distinguished Service Medal|IDSMs]], twelve [[Military Medal|MMs]] and three [[Silver Star|US Silver Stars]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.6thgurkhas.org/theregiment_battles.shtml|title=The Battle for Mogaung|publisher=6th Gurkhas.org|accessdate=2009-05-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827235622/http://www.6thgurkhas.org/theregiment_battles.shtml|archive-date=2008-08-27|url-status=dead}}</ref> The South Staffordshires, Kings and Lancashire fusiliers also received many awards.

In brutal fighting, the [[77th Indian Infantry Brigade|77th 'Chindit' Brigade]] under Brigadier [[Mike Calvert|Michael Calvert]], later assisted by [[Chinese Expeditionary Force|Chinese forces]] of Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]], fought-for and captured the town from the [[Japanese occupation of Burma|occupying forces]] of [[Imperial Japan]].\n\nThe battle was part of a major [[Chindit]] campaign called [[Chindits#Operation Thursday|Operation ''Thursday'']] which later amalgamated with the [[Siege of Myitkyina]] by Chinese and US forces led by [[Joseph Stilwell]] who was in overall command of the Chindits. The capture of Mogaung was the first place in Burma to be liberated from the Japanese, and it was the last major Chindit campaign of the war. Two [[Victoria Cross]]es were awarded during the battle.<ref name=\"Griffin163\">{{Harvnb|Griffin|2018|pp=163-64}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nIn 1943, Brigadier [[Orde Wingate]] led the Chindits behind Japanese lines for the first of their [[Long-range penetration]] operations with Operation ''Loincloth''. It resulted in little strategic success but it did prove that [[British Empire]] forces could fight on equal terms with the Japanese in the jungle. The following year General [[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|William 'Bill' Slim]] leading the British [[Fourteenth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourteenth Army]] were engaged in a desperate struggle against the Japanese army who had launched [[Operation U-Go]] - the invasion of [[British India]] beginning in March 1944.<ref name=\"Fay262\">{{Harvnb|Fay|1993|p=265}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the Japanese invasion a second Chindit expedition was launched; Operation ''Thursday'' was much larger than the previous years' with six brigades. The aim was to harass the Japanese rear and supply lines as well as to relieve pressure on American General [[Joseph Stilwell|Vinegar 'Joe' Stilwell]]'s joint Chinese and US forces moving south into Northern Burma who were intending to take the strategic town of [[Myitkyina]]. The early operations of the Chindits were marred by the death of Wingate in an air crash. They then went under the command of Major General [[Walter Lentaigne]] but were eventually placed under the command of the [[Anglophobia|Anglophobe]] Stilwell.<ref name=\"McLynn361\">{{Harvnb|McLynn|2011|p=361}}</ref> Once the operation was underway in March, 77 Brigade having held off superior Japanese forces for two months from their stronghold of ''White City''.\n\n===Prelude===\nIn late May they were ordered north by Stilwell to the area of Mogaung to take the pressure off his Chinese forces as they were struggling in [[Siege of Myitkyina|besieging Myitkyina]]. Capturing Mogaung meant that the Japanese lifeline northward would be cut and Myitkyina would inevitably fall. At the end of May, Fourteenth Army intelligence, backed by hazardous patrols from 77 Brigade, found that the Japanese had reinforced the defenders of Mogaung with four battalions from Lieutenant-General Hisashi Takeda's [[53rd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|53rd Division]] to  just under 4,000 troops.<ref name=\"Allen369\">{{Harvnb|Allen |1998|p=369}}</ref> The 77th brigade consisted of four battalions; the [[Lancashire Fusiliers]], [[King's Regiment]], [[South Staffordshire Regiment|South Staffordshire's]] and [[6th Queen Elizabeth's Own Gurkha Rifles]]s. Accompanying the brigade were [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] liaison officers who would need high ground for radio contact from which to bring in close air support.<ref name=\"Diamond74\">{{Harvnb|Diamond|2016|p=74}}</ref>\n\nGetting to Mogaung would be difficult for the brigade however. There was no way of flying in and to the North of the town was the fast flowing Mogaung River and to the West diverging off was the Wetthauk Chaung river. The country to the East and South were interspersed by lakes, marshes with the only access being a two mile long Pinhmi road on a causeway. The British would have to use this in order to get there and would come up against villages on the outskirts that had been heavily fortified - with bunkers being constructed under the buildings.<ref name=\"Towill113\">{{Harvnb|Towill 2000|p=114}}</ref>\n\n==Battle==\nOn May 30 the brigade set off; the plan was to advance 160 miles to the town using the Pinhmi road as an axis. Their first priority was for the  need for an area for a small landing strip for evacuating the sick and wounded as well as an area for supplies to be dropped.

Nevertheless on 2 June the South Staffordshires and the Gurkhas captured the village of [[Lakum]] after a fierce encounter with the Japanese. The village was a low laying hill overlooking the plain two miles south west of Mogaung. On the following day, another series of bitter encounters forced the Japanese off the surrounding hills - the Gurkhas seized a hamlet, later dubbed 'Gurkha Village', after wiping out the forty strong garrison there.

Among them was Captain [[Michael Allmand]]'s heroic feat in ensuring the capture of the bridge. The attacks cost nearly 130 casualties but Calvert's brigade was securely established along the axis of the Pinhmi-Mogaung road.<ref name=\"Diamond70\">{{Harvnb|Diamond|2016|p=70}}</ref>\n\nThe [[monsoon]] then broke later that day and conditions were tough for the men of 77 Brigade; [[malaria]], [[trench foot]] and [[typhus]] were soon rife.<ref name=\"Allen371\">{{Harvnb|Allen|1998|p=371}}</ref> Calvert learnt that two more Japanese battalions arrived to reinforce Mogaung essentially replacing casualties, and seeing the difficulty he then sent a messenger to Stilwell to alert him to the situation; but was not received with any sympathy. Stilwell eventually sent the 1/114th Chinese Infantry Regiment from the 38th Division to support the Chindits.<ref name=\"Bidwell270\">{{Harvnb|Bidwell|1980|pp=270-71}}</ref> Calvert assessed the situation on June 12; many battalions were reduced to a company which meant the brigade total consisted of no more than 750 fit men. Calvert was concerned with the number of wounded and the sick having to endure the poor conditions - [[Defensive fighting position|slit trenches]] were impossible due to the wet conditions; men would have to lay face down in the mud if they were under shell fire. Many of the wounded however were determined to stay and fight rather than be flown out.<ref name=\"Rooney100\">{{Harvnb|Rooney|1990|pp=100-01}}</ref>\n\nOver the next few days conditions began to improve many of the wounded were flown out and supplies were brought in once more. On June 15 Calvert continued his attacks, fighting to secure a ridge closer to the town. The Court House was taken the next day, and the area extending to the Mogaung River and up to the outskirts of Natgyigon was cleared.<ref name=\"Kirby408\"/> Japanese mortar fire from the village of Naungkaiktaw was causing some grief upon the Chindits. At dawn on June 18 air attacks and a heavy mortar bombardment over the next few days followed by an assault by the Lancashire Fusiliers and the King's attacked using flamethrowers.<ref name=\"Diamond80\">{{Harvnb|Diamond|2016|p=80}}</ref> At the cost of some fifty casualties (some from friendly fire) they succeeded and drove around a hundred Japanese out of the village in addition to killing some seventy of them. Whilst consolidating their position in the village a Japanese patrol was ambushed and taken out; they had not realised the village had been in British hands.<ref name=\"Rooney100\"/>\n\nAround the same time Chinese troops began to arrive; Gurkhas made contact with them West of Lakum. Mogaung was then surrounded, with the Chinese in the South which totalled nearly three battalions. Crucially they had [[Bofors 75 mm mountain gun|75mm mountain guns]] which were established at Pinhmi, and they were able pound Japanese positions.<ref name=\"McLynn352\">{{Harvnb|McLynn|2011|pp=351-52}}</ref>\n\n===Mogaung===\n[[File:Gurkha Captain Michael Allmand VC.jpg|thumb|150px|Gurkha Captain Michael Allmand who won the VC during the Battle of Mogaung]]\nCalvert planned his next attack for 23 June towards Natyigon, a key position and the last outer bastion of Mogaung. At first light on that day the final assault was launched; every available fit man was called up; cooks, orderlies and even Headquarters personnel. The Chinese attacked towards the railway station along the railway embankment which was effectively a last line of defence. Despite a heavy bombardment the attack failed and the Chinese were held back with intense Japanese machine gun fire. The Chindits had no choice but to halt along this line for the remainder of the day.<ref name=\"Bidwell270\"/>\n\nEarlier reconnaissance had pin-pointed the 'Red House', a large bricked building. The following day after a heavy bombardment from the Chinese guns and British mortars as well as air attacks the British attacked from the North of the station. Once once more fighting was intense, the Japanese defending tenaciously despite the constant pounding. The building and surrounding positions were only taken after brutal fighting in which flamethrowers, grenades and PIATs were used.<ref name=\"GibbsRyan143\">Gibbs & Ryan pp. 143-44</ref> One of the men involved was Rifleman [[Tulbahadur Pun]]; his single-handed gallantry as part of the Gurkhas attack on the 'Red House' earned him a nomination for the Victoria Cross. The other nomination fell to Michael Allmand who attacked a machine-gun position holding up his remaining company. He Knocked out the position with grenades but was mortally wounded in the process. The Chinese provided some fire support but did not take part in this attack, instead protecting the flanks and cutting off any Japanese escape attempt. The assault by the Gurkhas totally unbalanced the Japanese and Takeda had no other choice to withdraw or risk his battalions being destroyed.<ref name=\"Corrigan\">{{Harvnb|Corrigan|210|pp=466-67}}</ref>\n\nThe final attack was on the railway station on June 25 - the Chinese attack from the South was postponed but the Lancashires and the South Staffordshires went in anyway and after more heavy fighting finally took the battered remains and met up with the Chinese.<ref name=\"Lunt39\">{{Harvnb|Lunt|1994|p=39}}</ref> With the British having major foothold in the town, the Japanese launched a number of counter attacks that night but they were beaten off. The following morning the Chindit and Chinese patrols found positions outside the town abandoned.<ref name=\"Smith277\"/> Any Japanese that escaped did so by using [[Drum (container)|oil drums]] in the hope they would make it downriver to Myitkyina. Many however were shot up by patrolling Chindits.<ref name=\"Bidwell273\">{{Harvnb|Bidwell|1980|pp=273-74}}</ref>\n\nWith the battle largely over the Chindits consolidated their position in Mogaung but they were physically and mentally exhausted. The brigade at the end of the battle only had less than 550 men left of fighting strength. The Lancashire Fusiliers, King's Regiment and South Staffordshire's between them could only muster 300 between them and the 3/6th Gurkhas had 230 left fit.<ref name=\"Calvert180\">{{Harvnb|Calvert|2004|p=180}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nOnce Mogaung had been captured the Gurkha's garrisoned the town preparing for further counterattacks from across the river but none was forthcoming; the Japanese had left the area completely.<ref name=\"McLynn352\"/> Whilst in Mogaung, the Gurkha's took the opportunity to hold a small ceremonial parade and hoisted the Union Jack on a large [[pagoda]], the most prominent building left standing. The Chindits remained in the area until July 5 and then withdrew to their base area at Pinhmi. They then had to march a further fifty miles to be flown back to India before leaving Mogaung in the hands of the Chinese.<ref name=\"Calvert180\"/>\n\nThe capture of Mogaung was the first place in Burma to be liberated from the Japanese, and it was the last major Chindit campaign of the war.<ref name=\"Griffin163\"/> The Japanese had lost heavily with nearly 1,600 casualties most of whom were dead and and an unknown number of sick that evacuated.<ref name=\"Allen374\"/> The cost of taking Mogaung had been high - Calvert had lost 47 officers and 729 other ranks killed or wounded; which equated to around fifty percent casualties. Stilwell had used the Chindits in an unsuitable role of classic infantry, without the support of artillery and armour. He announced via the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] that Chinese troops of his [[Northern Combat Area Command]] had captured Mogaung but without referencing the British. The Chindits were outraged, and Calvert famously signalled to Stilwell's headquarters 'Chinese reported taking Mogaung. My Brigade now taking umbrage.' Stillwell's son who was the intelligence officer announced that 'Umbrage was so small that I can't find it on the map'.<ref name=\"Rooney105\">{{Harvnb|Rooney|1990|p=105}}</ref>\n\nFearing that they would then be ordered to join the siege of Myitkyina, Calvert shut down his radios and withdrew to [[Kamaing]], where Stilwell had his headquarters. A court-martial was likely until Stilwell and Calvert met in person, and the former finally appreciated the conditions under which the Chindits had been operating.<ref name=\"Allen374\"/> The siege of Myitkyina had already proved a thorn in Stilwell's side after a major Chinese assault had been repelled with heavy losses. The British capture of Mogaung did relieve pressure on Stilwell's troops besieging the town; the Japanese quit Myitkyina on 3 August.<ref name=\"MM\">{{cite book |last1=United States Government |title=Merrill's Marauders, February - May 1944 American forces in action series Volume 100, Issue 4 |date=1990 |publisher=Printing Office Center of Military History |page=113 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4aAfAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA113&dq=}}</ref>\n\nTwo Victoria Crosses were awarded during the battle - Michael Allmand received his [[Posthumous award|posthumously]], while Tul Bahadur Pun received his in November.<ref name=\"Griffin163\"/> In addition members of the Sixth Gurkhas also received two [[Distinguished Service Order|DSOs]], three\n[[Indian Order of Merit|IOMs]], six [[Military Cross|MCs]], four [[Indian Distinguished Service Medal|IDSMs]], twelve [[Military Medal|MMs]] and three [[Silver Star|US Silver Stars]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.6thgurkhas.org/theregiment_battles.shtml|title=The Battle for Mogaung|publisher=6th Gurkhas.org|accessdate=2009-05-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827235622/http://www.6thgurkhas.org/theregiment_battles.shtml|archive-date=2008-08-27|url-status=dead}}</ref> The South Staffordshires, Kings and Lancashire fusiliers also received many awards.
