{"title_page": "LU decomposition", "text_new": "In [[numerical analysis]] and [[linear algebra]], '''lower\u2013upper''' ('''LU''') '''decomposition''' or '''factorization''' factors a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] as the product of a lower [[triangular matrix]] and an upper triangular matrix. The product sometimes includes a [[permutation matrix]] as well. LU decomposition can be viewed as the matrix form of [[Gaussian elimination]]. Computers usually solve square [[system of linear equations|systems of linear equations]] using LU decomposition, and it is also a key step when inverting a matrix or computing the [[determinant]] of a matrix. LU decomposition was introduced by Polish mathematician [[Tadeusz Banachiewicz]] in 1938.<ref name=\"Schwarzenberg\">{{Cite journal |last1=Schwarzenberg-Czerny |first1=A. |title=On matrix factorization and efficient least squares solution |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics Supplement Series |volume=110 |pages=405 | bibcode=1995A&AS..110..405S |year=1995}}</ref>\n\n== Definitions ==\n\n[[File:LDU decomposition of Walsh 16.svg|thumb|300px|LDU decomposition of a [[Walsh matrix]]]]\n\nLet ''A'' be a square matrix. An '''LU factorization''' refers to the factorization of ''A'', with proper row and/or column orderings or permutations, into two factors \u2013 a lower triangular matrix ''L'' and an upper triangular matrix ''U'':\n:<math> A = LU. </math>\n\nIn the lower triangular matrix all elements above the diagonal are zero, in the upper triangular matrix, all the elements below the diagonal are zero.  For example, for a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix ''A'', its LU decomposition looks like this:\n:<math>\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\\\\n    a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\\\\n    a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}\n  \\end{bmatrix} =\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    l_{11} &      0 & 0      \\\\\n    l_{21} & l_{22} & 0      \\\\\n    l_{31} & l_{32} & l_{33}\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    u_{11} & u_{12} & u_{13} \\\\\n         0 & u_{22} & u_{23} \\\\\n         0 &      0 & u_{33}\n  \\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nWithout a proper ordering or permutations in the matrix, the factorization may fail to materialize.  For example, it is easy to verify (by expanding the matrix multiplication) that <math display=\"inline\">a_{11} = l_{11} u_{11}</math>. If <math display=\"inline\">a_{11} = 0</math>, then at least one of <math display=\"inline\">l_{11}</math> and <math display=\"inline\">u_{11}</math> has to be zero, which implies that either ''L'' or ''U'' is [[Singular matrix|singular]]. This is impossible if ''A'' is nonsingular (invertible). This is a procedural problem. It can be removed by simply reordering the rows of ''A'' so that the first element of the permuted matrix is nonzero. The same problem in subsequent factorization steps can be removed the same way; see the basic procedure below.\n\n=== LU factorization with partial pivoting ===\n\nIt turns out that a proper permutation in rows (or columns) is sufficient for LU factorization. '''LU factorization with partial pivoting''' (LUP) refers often to LU factorization with row permutations only:\n:<math> PA = LU, </math>\n\nwhere ''L'' and ''U'' are again lower and upper triangular matrices, and ''P'' is a [[permutation matrix]], which, when left-multiplied to ''A'', reorders the rows of ''A''. It turns out that all square matrices can be factorized in this form,<ref name=okunev-cor3>{{harvtxt|Okunev|Johnson|1997}}, Corollary 3.</ref> and the factorization is numerically stable in practice.<ref>{{harvtxt|Trefethen|Bau|1997}}, p. 166.</ref> This makes LUP decomposition a useful technique in practice.\n\n=== LU factorization with full pivoting ===\n\nAn '''LU factorization with full pivoting''' involves both row and column permutations:\n:<math> PAQ = LU, </math>\n\nwhere ''L'', ''U'' and ''P'' are defined as before, and ''Q'' is a permutation matrix that reorders the columns of ''A''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Trefethen|Bau|1997}}, p. 161.</ref>\n\n=== LDU decomposition===\n\nAn '''LDU decomposition''' is a decomposition of the form\n:<math> A = LDU, </math>\n\nwhere ''D'' is a [[diagonal matrix]], and ''L'' and ''U'' are ''unitriangular'' matrices, meaning that all the entries on the diagonals of ''L'' and ''U'' are one.\n\nAbove we required that ''A'' be a square matrix, but these decompositions can all be generalized to rectangular matrices as well.  In that case, ''L'' and ''D'' are square matrices both of which have the same number of rows as ''A'', and ''U'' has exactly the same dimensions as ''A''.  ''Upper triangular'' should be interpreted as having only zero entries below the main diagonal, which starts at the upper left corner.\n\n== Example ==\n\nWe factorize the following 2-by-2 matrix:\n: <math>\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    4 & 3 \\\\\n    6 & 3\n  \\end{bmatrix} =\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    l_{11} & 0      \\\\\n    l_{21} & l_{22}\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    u_{11} & u_{12} \\\\\n         0 & u_{22}\n  \\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nOne way to find the LU decomposition of this simple matrix would be to simply solve the linear equations by inspection. Expanding the matrix multiplication gives\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n            l_{11} \\cdot u_{11} + 0 \\cdot 0 &= 4 \\\\\n       l_{11} \\cdot u_{12} + 0 \\cdot u_{22} &= 3 \\\\\n       l_{21} \\cdot u_{11} + l_{22} \\cdot 0 &= 6 \\\\\n  l_{21} \\cdot u_{12} + l_{22} \\cdot u_{22} &= 3.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThis system of equations is [[Underdetermined system|underdetermined]]. In this case any two non-zero elements of ''L'' and ''U'' matrices are parameters of the solution and can be set arbitrarily to any non-zero value. Therefore, to find the unique LU decomposition, it is necessary to put some restriction on ''L'' and ''U'' matrices. For example, we can conveniently require the lower triangular matrix ''L'' to be a unit triangular matrix (i.e. set all the entries of its main diagonal to ones). Then the system of equations has the following solution:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  l_{21} &=  1.5 \\\\\n  u_{11} &=  4   \\\\\n  u_{12} &=  3   \\\\\n  u_{22} &= -1.5\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nSubstituting these values into the LU decomposition above yields\n\n:<math>\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    4 & 3 \\\\\n    6 & 3\n  \\end{bmatrix} =\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1   & 0 \\\\\n    1.5 & 1\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    4 &  3 \\\\\n    0 & -1.5\n  \\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\n== Existence and uniqueness ==\n\n=== Square matrices ===\n\nAny square matrix <math display=\"inline\"> A </math> admits an ''LUP'' factorization.<ref name=okunev-cor3 /> If <math display=\"inline\"> A </math> is [[invertible matrix|invertible]], then it admits an ''LU'' (or ''LDU'') factorization [[if and only if]] all its leading principal [[minor (linear algebra)|minors]] are nonzero.<ref name=horn-cor355>{{harvtxt|Horn|Johnson|1985}}, Corollary 3.5.5</ref> If <math display=\"inline\"> A </math> is a singular matrix of rank <math display=\"inline\"> k </math>, then it admits an ''LU'' factorization if the first <math display=\"inline\"> k </math> leading principal minors are nonzero, although the converse is not true.<ref>{{harvtxt|Horn|Johnson|1985}}, Theorem 3.5.2</ref>\n\nIf a square, invertible matrix has an ''LDU'' (factorization with all diagonal entries of ''L'' and ''U'' equal to 1), then the factorization is unique.<ref name=horn-cor355 /> In that case, the ''LU'' factorization is also unique if we require that the diagonal of <math display=\"inline\"> L </math> (or <math display=\"inline\"> U </math>) consists of ones.\n\n=== Symmetric positive definite matrices ===\n\nIf ''A'' is a symmetric (or [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian]], if ''A'' is complex) [[Positive-definite matrix|positive definite]] matrix, we can arrange matters so that ''U'' is the [[conjugate transpose]] of ''L''. That is, we can write ''A'' as\n: <math> A = LL^*. \\, </math>\n\nThis decomposition is called the [[Cholesky decomposition]]. The Cholesky decomposition always exists and is unique \u2014 provided the matrix is positive definite. Furthermore, computing the Cholesky decomposition is more efficient and [[numerical stability|numerically more stable]] than computing some other LU decompositions.\n\n=== General matrices ===\n\nFor a (not necessarily invertible) matrix over any field, the exact necessary and sufficient conditions under which it has an LU factorization are known. The conditions are expressed in terms of the ranks of certain submatrices. The Gaussian elimination algorithm for obtaining LU decomposition has also been extended to this most general case.<ref>{{harvtxt|Okunev|Johnson|1997}}</ref>\n\n== Algorithms ==\n\nLU decomposition is basically a modified form of [[Gaussian elimination]]. We transform the matrix ''A'' into an upper triangular matrix ''U'' by eliminating the entries below the main diagonal. The Doolittle algorithm does the elimination column-by-column, starting from the left, by multiplying ''A'' to the left with atomic lower triangular matrices. It results in a ''unit lower triangular'' matrix and an upper triangular matrix. The Crout algorithm is slightly different and constructs a lower triangular matrix and a ''unit upper triangular'' matrix.\n\nComputing an LU decomposition using either of these algorithms requires <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{2}{3} n^3</math> floating-point operations, ignoring lower-order terms. Partial [[Pivot element|pivoting]] adds only a quadratic term; this is not the case for full pivoting.<ref>{{harvtxt|Golub|Van Loan|1996}}, p. 112, 119.</ref>\n\n=== Closed formula ===\n\nWhen an LDU factorization exists and is unique, there is a closed (explicit) formula for the elements of ''L'', ''D'', and ''U'' in terms of ratios of determinants of certain submatrices of the original matrix ''A''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Householder|1975}}</ref> In particular, <math display=\"inline\">D_1 = A_{1,1}</math>, and for <math display=\"inline\">i = 2, \\ldots, n</math>, <math display=\"inline\">D_i</math> is the ratio of the <math display=\"inline\">i</math>-th principal submatrix to the <math display=\"inline\">(i - 1)</math>-th principal submatrix. Computation of the determinants is [[computational complexity|computationally expensive]], so this explicit formula is not used in practice.\n\n=== Doolittle algorithm ===\nGiven an ''N'' \u00d7 ''N'' matrix\n\n:<math>A = (a_{i,j})_{1 \\leq i,j \\leq N},</math>\n\nwe define\n\n:<math> A^{(0)} := A.</math>\n\nWe eliminate the matrix elements below the main diagonal in the ''n''-th column of ''A''<sup>(''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)</sup> by adding to the ''i''-th row of this matrix the ''n''-th row multiplied by\n\n:<math>-l_{i,n} := -\\frac{a_{i,n}^{(n-1)}}{a_{n,n}^{(n-1)}}</math>\n\nfor <math display=\"inline\">i = n+1, \\ldots, N</math>. This can be done by multiplying ''A''<sup>(''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)</sup> to the left with the lower triangular matrix\n\n:<math>L_n =\n \\begin{pmatrix}\n  1      & 0      &            & \\dots &        & 0      \\\\\n  0      & \\ddots & \\ddots     &       &        &        \\\\\n         &        & 1          &       &        &        \\\\\n  \\vdots &        & -l_{n+1,n} &       &        & \\vdots \\\\\n         &        & \\vdots     &       & \\ddots & 0      \\\\\n  0      &        & -l_{N,n}   &       &        & 1\n \\end{pmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nWe set\n\n:<math> A^{(n)} := L_n A^{(n-1)}.</math>\n\nAfter ''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 steps, we eliminated all the matrix elements below the main diagonal, so we obtain an upper triangular matrix ''A''<sup>(''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)</sup>. We find the decomposition\n\n:<math>\n  A = L_1^{-1} L_1 A^{(0)}\n    = L_1^{-1} A^{(1)}\n    = L_1^{-1} L_2^{-1} L_2 A^{(1)}\n    = L_1^{-1} L_2^{-1} A^{(2)}\n    = \\dotsb\n    = L_1^{-1} \\ldots L_{N-1}^{-1} A^{(N-1)}.\n</math>\n\nDenote the upper triangular matrix ''A''<sup>(''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)</sup> by ''U'', and <math display=\"inline\">L = L_1^{-1} \\ldots L_{N-1}^{-1}</math>. Because the inverse of a lower triangular matrix ''L''<sub>''n''</sub> is again a lower triangular matrix, and the multiplication of two lower triangular matrices is again a lower triangular matrix, it follows that ''L'' is a lower triangular matrix. Moreover, it can be seen that\n\n:<math>L =\n  \\begin{pmatrix}\n          1 &    0   &    \\dots  &        &            & 0    \\\\\n    l_{2,1} & \\ddots &    \\ddots &        &            &      \\\\\n            &        &         1 &        &            &      \\\\\n     \\vdots &        & l_{n+1,n} & \\ddots &            &\\vdots\\\\\n            &        &    \\vdots &        &       1    & 0    \\\\\n    l_{N,1} &        & l_{N,n}   &        & l_{N,N-1}  & 1\n  \\end{pmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nWe obtain <math display=\"inline\">A = LU</math>.\n\nIt is clear that in order for this algorithm to work, one needs to have <math display=\"inline\">a_{n,n}^{(n-1)} \\neq 0</math> at each step (see the definition of <math display=\"inline\">l_{i,n}</math>). If this assumption fails at some point, one needs to interchange ''n''-th row with another row below it before continuing. This is why an  LU decomposition in general looks like <math display=\"inline\">P^{-1}A = L U </math>.\n\n=== Crout and LUP algorithms ===\n\nThe LUP decomposition algorithm by Cormen et al. generalizes [[Crout matrix decomposition]]. It can be described as follows.\n\n# If <math display=\"inline\">A</math> has a nonzero entry in its first row, then take a permutation matrix <math display=\"inline\">P_1</math> such that <math display=\"inline\">A P_1</math> has a nonzero entry in its upper left corner. Otherwise, take for <math display=\"inline\">P_1</math> the identity matrix. Let <math display=\"inline\">A_1 = A P_1</math>.\n# Let <math display=\"inline\">A_2</math> be the matrix that one gets from <math display=\"inline\">A_1</math> by deleting both the first row and the first column. Decompose <math display=\"inline\">A_2 = L_2 U_2 P_2</math> recursively. Make <math display=\"inline\">L</math> from <math display=\"inline\">L_2</math> by first adding a zero row above and then adding the first column of <math display=\"inline\">A_1</math> at the left.\n# Make <math display=\"inline\">U_3</math> from <math display=\"inline\">U_2</math> by first adding a zero row above and a zero column at the left and then replacing the upper left entry (which is 0 at this point) by 1. Make <math display=\"inline\">P_3</math> from <math display=\"inline\">P_2</math> in a similar manner and define <math display=\"inline\">A_3 = A_1 / P_3 = A P_1 / P_3</math>. Let <math display=\"inline\">P</math> be the inverse of <math display=\"inline\">P_1 / P_3</math>.\n# At this point, <math display=\"inline\">A_3</math> is the same as <math display=\"inline\">L U_3</math>, except (possibly) at the first row. If the first row of <math display=\"inline\">A</math> is zero, then <math display=\"inline\">A_3 =  L U_3</math>, since both have first row zero, and <math display=\"inline\">A = L U_3 P</math> follows, as desired. Otherwise, <math display=\"inline\">A_3</math> and <math display=\"inline\">L U_3</math> have the same nonzero entry in the upper left corner, and <math display=\"inline\">A_3 = L U_3 U_1</math> for some upper triangular square matrix <math display=\"inline\">U_1</math> with ones on the diagonal (<math display=\"inline\">U_1</math> clears entries of <math display=\"inline\">L U_3</math> and adds entries of <math display=\"inline\">A_3</math> by way of the upper left corner). Now <math display=\"inline\">A = L U_3 U_1 P</math> is a decomposition of the desired form.\n\n=== Randomized algorithm ===\nIt is possible to find a low rank approximation to an LU decomposition using a randomized algorithm. Given an input matrix <math display=\"inline\">A</math> and a desired low rank <math display=\"inline\">k</math>, the randomized LU returns permutation matrices <math display=\"inline\">P, Q</math> and lower/upper trapezoidal matrices <math display=\"inline\">L, U</math> of size <math display=\"inline\">m \\times k </math> and <math display=\"inline\">k \\times n</math> respectively, such that with high probability <math display=\"inline\">\\Vert PAQ-LU \\Vert_2 \\le C\\sigma_{k+1}</math>, where <math display=\"inline\">C</math> is a constant that depends on the parameters of the algorithm and <math display=\"inline\">\\sigma_{k+1}</math> is the <math display=\"inline\">(k+1)</math>th singular value of the input matrix <math display=\"inline\">A</math>.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shabat|first1=Gil|last2=Shmueli|first2=Yaniv|last3=Aizenbud|first3=Yariv|last4=Averbuch|first4=Amir|title=Randomized LU Decomposition|journal=Applied and Computational Harmonic Analysis|volume=44|issue=2|pages=246\u2013272|date=2016|doi=10.1016/j.acha.2016.04.006|arxiv=1310.7202}}</ref>\n\n=== Theoretical complexity ===\nIf two matrices of order ''n'' can be multiplied in time ''M''(''n''), where ''M''(''n'') \u2265 ''n''<sup>''a''</sup> for some ''a'' > 2, then an LU decomposition can be computed in time O(''M''(''n'')).<ref>{{harvtxt|Bunch|Hopcroft|1974}}</ref> This means, for example, that an O(''n''<sup>2.376</sup>) algorithm exists based on the [[Coppersmith\u2013Winograd algorithm]].\n\n=== Sparse-matrix decomposition ===\nSpecial algorithms have been developed for factorizing large [[sparse matrix|sparse matrices]]. These algorithms attempt to find sparse factors ''L'' and ''U''. Ideally, the cost of computation is determined by the number of nonzero entries, rather than by the size of the matrix.\n\nThese algorithms use the freedom to exchange rows and columns to minimize fill-in (entries that change from an initial zero to a non-zero value during the execution of an algorithm).\n\nGeneral treatment of orderings that minimize fill-in can be addressed using [[graph theory]].\n\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Solving linear equations ===\nGiven a system of linear equations in matrix form\n\n:<math>Ax = b,</math>\n\nwe want to solve the equation for ''x'', given ''A'' and ''b''. Suppose we have already obtained the LUP decomposition of ''A'' such that <math display=\"inline\">PA = LU</math>, so <math display=\"inline\">LUx = Pb</math>.\n\nIn this case the solution is done in two logical steps:\n# First, we solve the equation <math display=\"inline\">Ly = Pb</math> for ''y''.\n# Second, we solve the equation <math display=\"inline\">Ux = y</math> for ''x''.\n\nIn both cases we are dealing with triangular matrices (''L'' and ''U''), which can be solved directly by [[Triangular matrix#Forward and back substitution|forward and backward substitution]] without using the [[Gaussian elimination]] process (however we do need this process or equivalent to compute the ''LU'' decomposition itself).\n\nThe above procedure can be repeatedly applied to solve the equation multiple times for different ''b''. In this case it is faster (and more convenient) to do an LU decomposition of the matrix ''A'' once and then solve the triangular matrices for the different ''b'', rather than using Gaussian elimination each time. The matrices ''L'' and ''U'' could be thought to have \"encoded\" the Gaussian elimination process.\n\nThe cost of solving a system of linear equations is approximately <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{2}{3} n^3</math> floating-point operations if the matrix <math display=\"inline\">A</math> has size <math display=\"inline\">n</math>. This makes it twice as fast as algorithms based on [[QR decomposition]], which costs about <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{4}{3} n^3</math> floating-point operations when [[Householder reflection]]s are used. For this reason, LU decomposition is usually preferred.<ref>{{harvtxt|Trefethen|Bau|1997}}, p. 152.</ref>\n\n=== Inverting a matrix ===\nWhen solving systems of equations, ''b'' is usually treated as a vector with a length equal to the height of matrix ''A''. In matrix inversion however, instead of vector ''b'', we have matrix ''B'', where ''B'' is an ''n''-by-''p'' matrix, so that we are trying to find a matrix ''X'' (also a ''n''-by-''p'' matrix):\n\n:<math>AX = LUX = B.</math>\n\nWe can use the same algorithm presented earlier to solve for each column of matrix ''X''. Now suppose that ''B'' is the identity matrix of size ''n''. It would follow that the result ''X'' must be the inverse of ''A''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Golub|Van Loan|1996}}, p. 121</ref>\n\n=== Computing the determinant ===\nGiven the LUP decomposition <math display=\"inline\">A = P^{-1} LU</math> of a square matrix ''A'', the determinant of ''A'' can be computed straightforwardly as\n\n:<math>\\det(A) = \\det(P^{-1}) \\det(L) \\det(U) = (-1)^S \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n l_{ii} \\right) \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n u_{ii} \\right) .</math>\n\nThe second equation follows from the fact that the determinant of a triangular matrix is simply the product of its diagonal entries, and that the determinant of a permutation matrix is equal to (\u22121)<sup>''S''</sup> where ''S'' is the number of row exchanges in the decomposition.\n\nIn the case of LU decomposition with full pivoting, <math display=\"inline\">\\det(A)</math> also equals the right-hand side of the above equation, if we let ''S'' be the total number of row and column exchanges.\n\nThe same method readily applies to LU decomposition by setting ''P'' equal to the identity matrix.\n\n=== C code examples ===\n<source lang=\"cpp\">\n/* INPUT: A - array of pointers to rows of a square matrix having dimension N\n *        Tol - small tolerance number to detect failure when the matrix is near degenerate\n * OUTPUT: Matrix A is changed, it contains a copy of both matrices L-E and U as A=(L-E)+U such that P*A=L*U.\n *        The permutation matrix is not stored as a matrix, but in an integer vector P of size N+1 \n *        containing column indexes where the permutation matrix has \"1\".

The product sometimes includes a [[permutation matrix]] as well. LU decomposition can be viewed as the matrix form of [[Gaussian elimination]]. Computers usually solve square [[system of linear equations|systems of linear equations]] using LU decomposition, and it is also a key step when inverting a matrix or computing the [[determinant]] of a matrix. LU decomposition was introduced by a Polish mathematician [[Tadeusz Banachiewicz]] in 1938.<ref name=\"Schwarzenberg\">{{Cite journal |last1=Schwarzenberg-Czerny |first1=A. |title=On matrix factorization and efficient least squares solution |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics Supplement Series |volume=110 |pages=405 | bibcode=1995A&AS..110..405S |year=1995}}</ref>\n\n== Definitions ==\n\n[[File:LDU decomposition of Walsh 16.svg|thumb|300px|LDU decomposition of a [[Walsh matrix]]]]\n\nLet ''A'' be a square matrix. An '''LU factorization''' refers to the factorization of ''A'', with proper row and/or column orderings or permutations, into two factors \u2013 a lower triangular matrix ''L'' and an upper triangular matrix ''U'':\n:<math> A = LU. </math>\n\nIn the lower triangular matrix all elements above the diagonal are zero, in the upper triangular matrix, all the elements below the diagonal are zero.  For example, for a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix ''A'', its LU decomposition looks like this:\n:<math>\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\\\\n    a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\\\\n    a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}\n  \\end{bmatrix} =\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    l_{11} &      0 & 0      \\\\\n    l_{21} & l_{22} & 0      \\\\\n    l_{31} & l_{32} & l_{33}\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    u_{11} & u_{12} & u_{13} \\\\\n         0 & u_{22} & u_{23} \\\\\n         0 &      0 & u_{33}\n  \\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nWithout a proper ordering or permutations in the matrix, the factorization may fail to materialize.  For example, it is easy to verify (by expanding the matrix multiplication) that <math display=\"inline\">a_{11} = l_{11} u_{11}</math>. If <math display=\"inline\">a_{11} = 0</math>, then at least one of <math display=\"inline\">l_{11}</math> and <math display=\"inline\">u_{11}</math> has to be zero, which implies that either ''L'' or ''U'' is [[Singular matrix|singular]]. This is impossible if ''A'' is nonsingular (invertible). This is a procedural problem. It can be removed by simply reordering the rows of ''A'' so that the first element of the permuted matrix is nonzero. The same problem in subsequent factorization steps can be removed the same way; see the basic procedure below.\n\n=== LU factorization with partial pivoting ===\n\nIt turns out that a proper permutation in rows (or columns) is sufficient for LU factorization. '''LU factorization with partial pivoting''' (LUP) refers often to LU factorization with row permutations only:\n:<math> PA = LU, </math>\n\nwhere ''L'' and ''U'' are again lower and upper triangular matrices, and ''P'' is a [[permutation matrix]], which, when left-multiplied to ''A'', reorders the rows of ''A''. It turns out that all square matrices can be factorized in this form,<ref name=okunev-cor3>{{harvtxt|Okunev|Johnson|1997}}, Corollary 3.</ref> and the factorization is numerically stable in practice.<ref>{{harvtxt|Trefethen|Bau|1997}}, p. 166.</ref> This makes LUP decomposition a useful technique in practice.\n\n=== LU factorization with full pivoting ===\n\nAn '''LU factorization with full pivoting''' involves both row and column permutations:\n:<math> PAQ = LU, </math>\n\nwhere ''L'', ''U'' and ''P'' are defined as before, and ''Q'' is a permutation matrix that reorders the columns of ''A''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Trefethen|Bau|1997}}, p. 161.</ref>\n\n=== LDU decomposition===\n\nAn '''LDU decomposition''' is a decomposition of the form\n:<math> A = LDU, </math>\n\nwhere ''D'' is a [[diagonal matrix]], and ''L'' and ''U'' are ''unitriangular'' matrices, meaning that all the entries on the diagonals of ''L'' and ''U'' are one.\n\nAbove we required that ''A'' be a square matrix, but these decompositions can all be generalized to rectangular matrices as well.  In that case, ''L'' and ''D'' are square matrices both of which have the same number of rows as ''A'', and ''U'' has exactly the same dimensions as ''A''.  ''Upper triangular'' should be interpreted as having only zero entries below the main diagonal, which starts at the upper left corner.\n\n== Example ==\n\nWe factorize the following 2-by-2 matrix:\n: <math>\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    4 & 3 \\\\\n    6 & 3\n  \\end{bmatrix} =\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    l_{11} & 0      \\\\\n    l_{21} & l_{22}\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    u_{11} & u_{12} \\\\\n         0 & u_{22}\n  \\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nOne way to find the LU decomposition of this simple matrix would be to simply solve the linear equations by inspection. Expanding the matrix multiplication gives\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n            l_{11} \\cdot u_{11} + 0 \\cdot 0 &= 4 \\\\\n       l_{11} \\cdot u_{12} + 0 \\cdot u_{22} &= 3 \\\\\n       l_{21} \\cdot u_{11} + l_{22} \\cdot 0 &= 6 \\\\\n  l_{21} \\cdot u_{12} + l_{22} \\cdot u_{22} &= 3.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThis system of equations is [[Underdetermined system|underdetermined]]. In this case any two non-zero elements of ''L'' and ''U'' matrices are parameters of the solution and can be set arbitrarily to any non-zero value. Therefore, to find the unique LU decomposition, it is necessary to put some restriction on ''L'' and ''U'' matrices. For example, we can conveniently require the lower triangular matrix ''L'' to be a unit triangular matrix (i.e. set all the entries of its main diagonal to ones). Then the system of equations has the following solution:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  l_{21} &=  1.5 \\\\\n  u_{11} &=  4   \\\\\n  u_{12} &=  3   \\\\\n  u_{22} &= -1.5\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nSubstituting these values into the LU decomposition above yields\n\n:<math>\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    4 & 3 \\\\\n    6 & 3\n  \\end{bmatrix} =\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1   & 0 \\\\\n    1.5 & 1\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    4 &  3 \\\\\n    0 & -1.5\n  \\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\n== Existence and uniqueness ==\n\n=== Square matrices ===\n\nAny square matrix <math display=\"inline\"> A </math> admits an ''LUP'' factorization.<ref name=okunev-cor3 /> If <math display=\"inline\"> A </math> is [[invertible matrix|invertible]], then it admits an ''LU'' (or ''LDU'') factorization [[if and only if]] all its leading principal [[minor (linear algebra)|minors]] are nonzero.<ref name=horn-cor355>{{harvtxt|Horn|Johnson|1985}}, Corollary 3.5.5</ref> If <math display=\"inline\"> A </math> is a singular matrix of rank <math display=\"inline\"> k </math>, then it admits an ''LU'' factorization if the first <math display=\"inline\"> k </math> leading principal minors are nonzero, although the converse is not true.<ref>{{harvtxt|Horn|Johnson|1985}}, Theorem 3.5.2</ref>\n\nIf a square, invertible matrix has an ''LDU'' (factorization with all diagonal entries of ''L'' and ''U'' equal to 1), then the factorization is unique.<ref name=horn-cor355 /> In that case, the ''LU'' factorization is also unique if we require that the diagonal of <math display=\"inline\"> L </math> (or <math display=\"inline\"> U </math>) consists of ones.\n\n=== Symmetric positive definite matrices ===\n\nIf ''A'' is a symmetric (or [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian]], if ''A'' is complex) [[Positive-definite matrix|positive definite]] matrix, we can arrange matters so that ''U'' is the [[conjugate transpose]] of ''L''. That is, we can write ''A'' as\n: <math> A = LL^*. \\, </math>\n\nThis decomposition is called the [[Cholesky decomposition]]. The Cholesky decomposition always exists and is unique \u2014 provided the matrix is positive definite. Furthermore, computing the Cholesky decomposition is more efficient and [[numerical stability|numerically more stable]] than computing some other LU decompositions.\n\n=== General matrices ===\n\nFor a (not necessarily invertible) matrix over any field, the exact necessary and sufficient conditions under which it has an LU factorization are known. The conditions are expressed in terms of the ranks of certain submatrices. The Gaussian elimination algorithm for obtaining LU decomposition has also been extended to this most general case.<ref>{{harvtxt|Okunev|Johnson|1997}}</ref>\n\n== Algorithms ==\n\nLU decomposition is basically a modified form of [[Gaussian elimination]]. We transform the matrix ''A'' into an upper triangular matrix ''U'' by eliminating the entries below the main diagonal. The Doolittle algorithm does the elimination column-by-column, starting from the left, by multiplying ''A'' to the left with atomic lower triangular matrices. It results in a ''unit lower triangular'' matrix and an upper triangular matrix. The Crout algorithm is slightly different and constructs a lower triangular matrix and a ''unit upper triangular'' matrix.\n\nComputing an LU decomposition using either of these algorithms requires <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{2}{3} n^3</math> floating-point operations, ignoring lower-order terms. Partial [[Pivot element|pivoting]] adds only a quadratic term; this is not the case for full pivoting.<ref>{{harvtxt|Golub|Van Loan|1996}}, p. 112, 119.</ref>\n\n=== Closed formula ===\n\nWhen an LDU factorization exists and is unique, there is a closed (explicit) formula for the elements of ''L'', ''D'', and ''U'' in terms of ratios of determinants of certain submatrices of the original matrix ''A''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Householder|1975}}</ref> In particular, <math display=\"inline\">D_1 = A_{1,1}</math>, and for <math display=\"inline\">i = 2, \\ldots, n</math>, <math display=\"inline\">D_i</math> is the ratio of the <math display=\"inline\">i</math>-th principal submatrix to the <math display=\"inline\">(i - 1)</math>-th principal submatrix. Computation of the determinants is [[computational complexity|computationally expensive]], so this explicit formula is not used in practice.\n\n=== Doolittle algorithm ===\nGiven an ''N'' \u00d7 ''N'' matrix\n\n:<math>A = (a_{i,j})_{1 \\leq i,j \\leq N},</math>\n\nwe define\n\n:<math> A^{(0)} := A.</math>\n\nWe eliminate the matrix elements below the main diagonal in the ''n''-th column of ''A''<sup>(''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)</sup> by adding to the ''i''-th row of this matrix the ''n''-th row multiplied by\n\n:<math>-l_{i,n} := -\\frac{a_{i,n}^{(n-1)}}{a_{n,n}^{(n-1)}}</math>\n\nfor <math display=\"inline\">i = n+1, \\ldots, N</math>. This can be done by multiplying ''A''<sup>(''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)</sup> to the left with the lower triangular matrix\n\n:<math>L_n =\n \\begin{pmatrix}\n  1      & 0      &            & \\dots &        & 0      \\\\\n  0      & \\ddots & \\ddots     &       &        &        \\\\\n         &        & 1          &       &        &        \\\\\n  \\vdots &        & -l_{n+1,n} &       &        & \\vdots \\\\\n         &        & \\vdots     &       & \\ddots & 0      \\\\\n  0      &        & -l_{N,n}   &       &        & 1\n \\end{pmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nWe set\n\n:<math> A^{(n)} := L_n A^{(n-1)}.</math>\n\nAfter ''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 steps, we eliminated all the matrix elements below the main diagonal, so we obtain an upper triangular matrix ''A''<sup>(''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)</sup>. We find the decomposition\n\n:<math>\n  A = L_1^{-1} L_1 A^{(0)}\n    = L_1^{-1} A^{(1)}\n    = L_1^{-1} L_2^{-1} L_2 A^{(1)}\n    = L_1^{-1} L_2^{-1} A^{(2)}\n    = \\dotsb\n    = L_1^{-1} \\ldots L_{N-1}^{-1} A^{(N-1)}.\n</math>\n\nDenote the upper triangular matrix ''A''<sup>(''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)</sup> by ''U'', and <math display=\"inline\">L = L_1^{-1} \\ldots L_{N-1}^{-1}</math>. Because the inverse of a lower triangular matrix ''L''<sub>''n''</sub> is again a lower triangular matrix, and the multiplication of two lower triangular matrices is again a lower triangular matrix, it follows that ''L'' is a lower triangular matrix. Moreover, it can be seen that\n\n:<math>L =\n  \\begin{pmatrix}\n          1 &    0   &    \\dots  &        &            & 0    \\\\\n    l_{2,1} & \\ddots &    \\ddots &        &            &      \\\\\n            &        &         1 &        &            &      \\\\\n     \\vdots &        & l_{n+1,n} & \\ddots &            &\\vdots\\\\\n            &        &    \\vdots &        &       1    & 0    \\\\\n    l_{N,1} &        & l_{N,n}   &        & l_{N,N-1}  & 1\n  \\end{pmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nWe obtain <math display=\"inline\">A = LU</math>.\n\nIt is clear that in order for this algorithm to work, one needs to have <math display=\"inline\">a_{n,n}^{(n-1)} \\neq 0</math> at each step (see the definition of <math display=\"inline\">l_{i,n}</math>). If this assumption fails at some point, one needs to interchange ''n''-th row with another row below it before continuing. This is why an  LU decomposition in general looks like <math display=\"inline\">P^{-1}A = L U </math>.\n\n=== Crout and LUP algorithms ===\n\nThe LUP decomposition algorithm by Cormen et al. generalizes [[Crout matrix decomposition]]. It can be described as follows.\n\n# If <math display=\"inline\">A</math> has a nonzero entry in its first row, then take a permutation matrix <math display=\"inline\">P_1</math> such that <math display=\"inline\">A P_1</math> has a nonzero entry in its upper left corner. Otherwise, take for <math display=\"inline\">P_1</math> the identity matrix. Let <math display=\"inline\">A_1 = A P_1</math>.\n# Let <math display=\"inline\">A_2</math> be the matrix that one gets from <math display=\"inline\">A_1</math> by deleting both the first row and the first column. Decompose <math display=\"inline\">A_2 = L_2 U_2 P_2</math> recursively. Make <math display=\"inline\">L</math> from <math display=\"inline\">L_2</math> by first adding a zero row above and then adding the first column of <math display=\"inline\">A_1</math> at the left.\n# Make <math display=\"inline\">U_3</math> from <math display=\"inline\">U_2</math> by first adding a zero row above and a zero column at the left and then replacing the upper left entry (which is 0 at this point) by 1. Make <math display=\"inline\">P_3</math> from <math display=\"inline\">P_2</math> in a similar manner and define <math display=\"inline\">A_3 = A_1 / P_3 = A P_1 / P_3</math>. Let <math display=\"inline\">P</math> be the inverse of <math display=\"inline\">P_1 / P_3</math>.\n# At this point, <math display=\"inline\">A_3</math> is the same as <math display=\"inline\">L U_3</math>, except (possibly) at the first row. If the first row of <math display=\"inline\">A</math> is zero, then <math display=\"inline\">A_3 =  L U_3</math>, since both have first row zero, and <math display=\"inline\">A = L U_3 P</math> follows, as desired. Otherwise, <math display=\"inline\">A_3</math> and <math display=\"inline\">L U_3</math> have the same nonzero entry in the upper left corner, and <math display=\"inline\">A_3 = L U_3 U_1</math> for some upper triangular square matrix <math display=\"inline\">U_1</math> with ones on the diagonal (<math display=\"inline\">U_1</math> clears entries of <math display=\"inline\">L U_3</math> and adds entries of <math display=\"inline\">A_3</math> by way of the upper left corner). Now <math display=\"inline\">A = L U_3 U_1 P</math> is a decomposition of the desired form.\n\n=== Randomized algorithm ===\nIt is possible to find a low rank approximation to an LU decomposition using a randomized algorithm. Given an input matrix <math display=\"inline\">A</math> and a desired low rank <math display=\"inline\">k</math>, the randomized LU returns permutation matrices <math display=\"inline\">P, Q</math> and lower/upper trapezoidal matrices <math display=\"inline\">L, U</math> of size <math display=\"inline\">m \\times k </math> and <math display=\"inline\">k \\times n</math> respectively, such that with high probability <math display=\"inline\">\\Vert PAQ-LU \\Vert_2 \\le C\\sigma_{k+1}</math>, where <math display=\"inline\">C</math> is a constant that depends on the parameters of the algorithm and <math display=\"inline\">\\sigma_{k+1}</math> is the <math display=\"inline\">(k+1)</math>th singular value of the input matrix <math display=\"inline\">A</math>.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shabat|first1=Gil|last2=Shmueli|first2=Yaniv|last3=Aizenbud|first3=Yariv|last4=Averbuch|first4=Amir|title=Randomized LU Decomposition|journal=Applied and Computational Harmonic Analysis|volume=44|issue=2|pages=246\u2013272|date=2016|doi=10.1016/j.acha.2016.04.006|arxiv=1310.7202}}</ref>\n\n=== Theoretical complexity ===\nIf two matrices of order ''n'' can be multiplied in time ''M''(''n''), where ''M''(''n'') \u2265 ''n''<sup>''a''</sup> for some ''a'' > 2, then an LU decomposition can be computed in time O(''M''(''n'')).<ref>{{harvtxt|Bunch|Hopcroft|1974}}</ref> This means, for example, that an O(''n''<sup>2.376</sup>) algorithm exists based on the [[Coppersmith\u2013Winograd algorithm]].\n\n=== Sparse-matrix decomposition ===\nSpecial algorithms have been developed for factorizing large [[sparse matrix|sparse matrices]]. These algorithms attempt to find sparse factors ''L'' and ''U''. Ideally, the cost of computation is determined by the number of nonzero entries, rather than by the size of the matrix.\n\nThese algorithms use the freedom to exchange rows and columns to minimize fill-in (entries that change from an initial zero to a non-zero value during the execution of an algorithm).\n\nGeneral treatment of orderings that minimize fill-in can be addressed using [[graph theory]].\n\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Solving linear equations ===\nGiven a system of linear equations in matrix form\n\n:<math>Ax = b,</math>\n\nwe want to solve the equation for ''x'', given ''A'' and ''b''. Suppose we have already obtained the LUP decomposition of ''A'' such that <math display=\"inline\">PA = LU</math>, so <math display=\"inline\">LUx = Pb</math>.\n\nIn this case the solution is done in two logical steps:\n# First, we solve the equation <math display=\"inline\">Ly = Pb</math> for ''y''.\n# Second, we solve the equation <math display=\"inline\">Ux = y</math> for ''x''.\n\nIn both cases we are dealing with triangular matrices (''L'' and ''U''), which can be solved directly by [[Triangular matrix#Forward and back substitution|forward and backward substitution]] without using the [[Gaussian elimination]] process (however we do need this process or equivalent to compute the ''LU'' decomposition itself).\n\nThe above procedure can be repeatedly applied to solve the equation multiple times for different ''b''. In this case it is faster (and more convenient) to do an LU decomposition of the matrix ''A'' once and then solve the triangular matrices for the different ''b'', rather than using Gaussian elimination each time. The matrices ''L'' and ''U'' could be thought to have \"encoded\" the Gaussian elimination process.\n\nThe cost of solving a system of linear equations is approximately <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{2}{3} n^3</math> floating-point operations if the matrix <math display=\"inline\">A</math> has size <math display=\"inline\">n</math>. This makes it twice as fast as algorithms based on [[QR decomposition]], which costs about <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{4}{3} n^3</math> floating-point operations when [[Householder reflection]]s are used. For this reason, LU decomposition is usually preferred.<ref>{{harvtxt|Trefethen|Bau|1997}}, p. 152.</ref>\n\n=== Inverting a matrix ===\nWhen solving systems of equations, ''b'' is usually treated as a vector with a length equal to the height of matrix ''A''. In matrix inversion however, instead of vector ''b'', we have matrix ''B'', where ''B'' is an ''n''-by-''p'' matrix, so that we are trying to find a matrix ''X'' (also a ''n''-by-''p'' matrix):\n\n:<math>AX = LUX = B.</math>\n\nWe can use the same algorithm presented earlier to solve for each column of matrix ''X''. Now suppose that ''B'' is the identity matrix of size ''n''. It would follow that the result ''X'' must be the inverse of ''A''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Golub|Van Loan|1996}}, p. 121</ref>\n\n=== Computing the determinant ===\nGiven the LUP decomposition <math display=\"inline\">A = P^{-1} LU</math> of a square matrix ''A'', the determinant of ''A'' can be computed straightforwardly as\n\n:<math>\\det(A) = \\det(P^{-1}) \\det(L) \\det(U) = (-1)^S \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n l_{ii} \\right) \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n u_{ii} \\right) .</math>\n\nThe second equation follows from the fact that the determinant of a triangular matrix is simply the product of its diagonal entries, and that the determinant of a permutation matrix is equal to (\u22121)<sup>''S''</sup> where ''S'' is the number of row exchanges in the decomposition.\n\nIn the case of LU decomposition with full pivoting, <math display=\"inline\">\\det(A)</math> also equals the right-hand side of the above equation, if we let ''S'' be the total number of row and column exchanges.\n\nThe same method readily applies to LU decomposition by setting ''P'' equal to the identity matrix.\n\n=== C code examples ===\n<source lang=\"cpp\">\n/* INPUT: A - array of pointers to rows of a square matrix having dimension N\n *        Tol - small tolerance number to detect failure when the matrix is near degenerate\n * OUTPUT: Matrix A is changed, it contains a copy of both matrices L-E and U as A=(L-E)+U such that P*A=L*U.\n *        The permutation matrix is not stored as a matrix, but in an integer vector P of size N+1 \n *        containing column indexes where the permutation matrix has \"1\".

The acquisition of CIRUS was a watershed event in [[nuclear proliferation]] with the understanding between India and the United States that the reactor would be used for peaceful purposes only.<ref name= \"http://nuclearweaponarchive.org\" /> CIRUS was an ideal facility to develop a plutonium device, and therefore Nehru refused to accept [[nuclear fuel]] from Canada and started the programme to develop an indigenous [[nuclear fuel cycle]].<ref name=\"http://nuclearweaponarchive.org\"/>\n\nIn July 1958, Nehru authorised \"Project Phoenix\" to build a reprocessing plant with a capacity of 20 tons of fuel a year \u2013 a size to match the production capacity of CIRUS.<ref name = \"http://nuclearweaponarchive.org\"/> The plant used the [[PUREX|PUREX process]] and was designed by the [[Vitro Corporation|Vitro Corporation of America]].<ref name = \"http://nuclearweaponarchive.org\"/> Construction of the plutonium plant began at Trombay on 27 March 1961, and it was commissioned in mid-1964.<ref name = \"http://nuclearweaponarchive.org\"/>\n\nThe nuclear programme continued to mature, and by 1960, Nehru made the critical decision to move the programme into production.<ref name = \"http://nuclearweaponarchive.org\"/> At about the same time, Nehru held discussions with the American firm [[Westinghouse Electric]] to construct India's first [[Tarapur Atomic Power Station|nuclear power plant]] in [[Tarapur, Maharashtra]].<ref name = \"http://nuclearweaponarchive.org\"/> [[Kenneth Nichols]], a [[United States Army|US Army]] engineer, recalls from a meeting<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=238453029678049&id=236657633190922&substory_index=0|title = INDIA THE ULTIMATE POWER with Adi Kalita and 4 others|date = 30 May 2014|accessdate = 8 Sep 2014|website = Facebook.com|last = |first = }}</ref> with Nehru, \"it was that time when Nehru turned to Bhabha and asked Bhabha for the timeline of the development of a nuclear weapon\".

The other created a governmental secretariat, [[Department of Atomic Energy (India)|Department of Atomic Energy (DAE)]], of which Bhabha was the first secretary.

He reportedly chose relocation as a means to protect his privacy when discussion about developing land in the original area of the castle started.<ref name=\"ed_bio\">{{cite web|url=http://coralcastle.com/whos-ed/|title=Who's Ed?|publisher=Coral Castle|accessdate=October 9, 2010|quote=Ed was a very private person and when he heard about a planned subdivision being built near him he decided to move to Homestead and in 1936 bought 10 acres of land.}}</ref> He spent three years moving the component structures of Coral Castle {{convert|10|mi|km|0}} north from Florida City to its current location outside [[Homestead, Florida]].\n\nLeedskalnin named his new place \"Rock Gate\" after the huge rear swinging gate he built into the back wall.  He continued to work on the castle until his death in 1951. The coral pieces that are part of the newer castle, not among those transported from the original location, were quarried on the property only a few feet away from the castle's walls.  The pool and the pit beside the southern wall are quarries.  The east and west quarries have been filled in.\n\nAt Florida City, Leedskalnin charged visitors ten cents apiece to tour the castle grounds, but after moving to Homestead, he asked for donations of twenty five cents, but let visitors enter free if they had no money. There are signs carved into rocks at the front gate to \"Ring Bell Twice\".  He would come down from his living quarters in the second story of the castle tower close to the gate and conduct the tour. He never told anyone who asked him how he made the castle. He would simply answer \"It's not difficult if you know how.\"\n\nWhen asked why he had built the castle, Leedskalnin would vaguely answer it was for his \"Sweet Sixteen\".  This is widely believed to be a reference to Agnes Skuvst (often misspelled as \"Scuffs\"). In Leedskalnin's own publication ''A Book in Every Home'', he implies his \"Sweet Sixteen\" was more an ideal than a reality. According to a Latvian account, the girl existed, but her name was actually Herm\u012bne L\u016bsis.<ref>[[Karen Stollznow|Stollznow, Karen]]. \"Coral Castle Fact and Folklore\", ''Skeptical Inquirer'' January/February 2010, pp. 49\u201353</ref>\n\nWhen Leedskalnin became ill in November 1951, he put a sign on the door of the front gate \"Going to the Hospital\" and took the bus to [[Jackson Memorial Hospital]] in [[Miami]]. He suffered a stroke at one point, either before he left for the hospital or at the hospital. He died twenty-eight days later of [[Pyelonephritis]] (a kidney infection) at the age of 64. His death certificate noted that his death was a result of \"[[uremia]]; failure of kidneys, as a result of the infection and abscess\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://coralcastlebook.com/ |title=Coral Castle: The Mystery of Ed Leedskalnin and his American Stonehenge by best-selling author Rusty McClure and Jack Heffron |publisher=Coralcastlebook.com |date= |accessdate=May 19, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517040852/http://coralcastlebook.com/ |archive-date=May 17, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nWhile the property was being investigated, {{US$|3500|1951}} was found among Leedskalnin's personal belongings.

Leedskalnin made this sign and placed it in front of his earlier location at Florida City when he was tired of giving a \"free show\" to visitors who were careless and trampled his shrubbery.  This sign was donated by the owners of Ed's Place and placed here in subsequent years.\n\n==The Castle==\n[[File:Coral Castle 2.jpg|thumb|A view from within Coral Castle.]]\n[[File:Coral Castle 3.jpg|thumb|The Thirty Ton Stone.]]\nThe grounds of Coral Castle consist of {{convert|1100|ST|tonne|lk=on}} of stones in the form of walls, carvings, furniture, and a castle tower. Commonly mistakenly believed to be made of [[coral]], it is actually made of [[oolite]], also known as oolitic [[limestone]]. Oolite is a [[sedimentary rock]] composed of small spherical grains of concentrically layered [[carbonate]] that may include localized concentrations of [[fossil]] shells and coral. Oolite is found throughout southeastern Florida from [[Palm Beach County, Florida|Palm Beach County]] to the [[Florida Keys]].<ref>[http://www.dep.state.fl.us/geology/geologictopics/rocks/miami_limestone.htm Miami Limestone], Florida Department of Environmental Protection</ref> Oolite is often found beneath only several inches of topsoil, such as at the Coral Castle site.\n\nThe stones are fastened together without [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]]. They are set on top of each other using their weight to keep them together. The craftsmanship detail is so fine and the stones are connected with such precision that no light passes through the joints. The {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=on}} tall vertical stones that make up the perimeter wall have a uniform height. Even with the passage of decades the stones have not shifted.\n\nAmong the features and carvings are a two-story castle tower that served as Leedskalnin's living quarters (walls consisting of 8-foot-high pieces of stone), an accurate [[sundial]], a [[Polar alignment|Polar telescope]], an [[obelisk]], a barbecue, a [[water well]], a [[fountain]], celestial stars and planets, and numerous pieces of furniture. The furniture pieces include a heart-shaped table, a table in the shape of Florida, twenty-five [[rocking chair]]s, chairs resembling [[Lunar phase|crescent moons]], a bathtub, beds, and a [[throne]].\n\nWith few exceptions, the objects are made from single pieces of stone that weigh on average {{convert|15|ST|tonne|abbr=on}} each. The largest stone weighs {{convert|30|ST|tonne|abbr=on}} and the tallest are two [[monolith]]s standing {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on}} each.\n\nA {{convert|9|ST|tonne|adj=on}} revolving 8-foot tall gate is a famous structure of the castle, documented on the television programs ''[[In Search of... (TV series)|In Search of...]]''<ref name=\"ISO S05E16\"/> and ''[[That's Incredible!]]''.<ref name=\"TI March 3, 1980\">{{cite episode | series=[[That's Incredible!]] | title=That's Incredible! | date=March 3, 1980 | url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/thats-incredible/episodes/204847/ }}</ref> The gate is carved so that it fits within a quarter of an inch of the walls. It was well-balanced, reportedly so that a child could open it with the push of a finger. The mystery of the gate's perfectly balanced axis and the ease with which it revolved lasted for decades until it stopped working in 1986. In order to remove it, six men and a {{convert|50|ST|tonne|adj=on}} crane were used. Once the gate was removed, the engineers discovered how Leedskalnin had centered and balanced it. He had drilled a hole from top to bottom and inserted a metal shaft. The rock rested on an old truck [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]. It was the [[rust]]ing out of this bearing that resulted in the gate's failure to revolve. Complete with new bearings and shaft, it was set back into place on July 23, 1986.<ref>{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvAyjqdwNV8 |title=9 Ton Gate  | via=YouTube | date=November 22, 2006 |accessdate=May 19, 2014}}</ref> It failed in 2005 and was again repaired; however, it does not rotate with the same ease it once did.\n\nCoral Castle remains a popular tourist attraction. Books, magazines, and television programs speculate about how Leedskalnin was able to construct the structure and move stones that weigh many tons. Claims that nobody had ever seen Leedskalnin at work and that he levitated his stones have been repudiated.  Orval Irwin reportedly witnessed him quarry his stones and erect parts of his wall, and illustrated the methods in his book ''Mr. Can't Is Dead''.<ref name=\"Mr. Can't is Dead\">{{cite book | title=Mr. Can't is Dead: The Story of the Coral Castle | first=Orval M. | last=Irwin | location=Homestead, FL | date=1996 | oclc=45263633 }}</ref>  The Nemith Film Collection produced a short film documentary in 1944 of him at work {{Contradict-inline|reason=Darren Nemeth credits the video to Universal Studios 'Person-Oddities' series, possibly 'THE FANTASTIC CASTLE' from May 1944 (Person Oddity, no. 131).

Leedskalnin made this sign and placed it in front of his earlier location at Florida City when he was tired of giving a \"free show\" to visitors who were careless and trampled his shrubbery.  This sign was donated by the owners of Ed's Place and placed here in subsequent years.\n\n==The Castle==\n[[File:Coral Castle 2.jpg|thumb|A view from within Coral Castle.]]\n[[File:Coral Castle 3.jpg|thumb|The Thirty Ton Stone.]]\nThe grounds of Coral Castle consist of {{convert|1100|ST|tonne|lk=on}} of stones in the form of walls, carvings, furniture, and a castle tower. Commonly mistakenly believed to be made of [[coral]], it is actually made of [[oolite]], also known as oolitic [[limestone]]. Oolite is a [[sedimentary rock]] composed of small spherical grains of concentrically layered [[carbonate]] that may include localized concentrations of [[fossil]] shells and coral. Oolite is found throughout southeastern Florida from [[Palm Beach County, Florida|Palm Beach County]] to the [[Florida Keys]].<ref>[http://www.dep.state.fl.us/geology/geologictopics/rocks/miami_limestone.htm Miami Limestone], Florida Department of Environmental Protection</ref> Oolite is often found beneath only several inches of topsoil, such as at the Coral Castle site.\n\nThe stones are fastened together without [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]]. They are set on top of each other using their weight to keep them together. The craftsmanship detail is so fine and the stones are connected with such precision that no light passes through the joints. The {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=on}} tall vertical stones that make up the perimeter wall have a uniform height. Even with the passage of decades the stones have not shifted.\n\nAmong the features and carvings are a two-story castle tower that served as Leedskalnin's living quarters (walls consisting of 8-foot-high pieces of stone), an accurate [[sundial]], a [[Polar alignment|Polar telescope]], an [[obelisk]], a barbecue, a [[water well]], a [[fountain]], celestial stars and planets, and numerous pieces of furniture. The furniture pieces include a heart-shaped table, a table in the shape of Florida, twenty-five [[rocking chair]]s, chairs resembling [[Lunar phase|crescent moons]], a bathtub, beds, and a [[throne]].\n\nWith few exceptions, the objects are made from single pieces of stone that weigh on average {{convert|15|ST|tonne|abbr=on}} each. The largest stone weighs {{convert|30|ST|tonne|abbr=on}} and the tallest are two [[monolith]]s standing {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on}} each.\n\nA {{convert|9|ST|tonne|adj=on}} revolving 8-foot tall gate is a famous structure of the castle, documented on the television programs ''[[In Search of... (TV series)|In Search of...]]''<ref name=\"ISO S05E16\"/> and ''[[That's Incredible!]]''.<ref name=\"TI March 3, 1980\">{{cite episode | series=[[That's Incredible!]] | title=That's Incredible! | date=March 3, 1980 | url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/thats-incredible/episodes/204847/ }}</ref> The gate is carved so that it fits within a quarter of an inch of the walls. It was well-balanced, reportedly so that a child could open it with the push of a finger. The mystery of the gate's perfectly balanced axis and the ease with which it revolved lasted for decades until it stopped working in 1986. In order to remove it, six men and a {{convert|50|ST|tonne|adj=on}} crane were used. Once the gate was removed, the engineers discovered how Leedskalnin had centered and balanced it. He had drilled a hole from top to bottom and inserted a metal shaft. The rock rested on an old truck [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]. It was the [[rust]]ing out of this bearing that resulted in the gate's failure to revolve. Complete with new bearings and shaft, it was set back into place on July 23, 1986.<ref>{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvAyjqdwNV8 |title=9 Ton Gate  | via=YouTube | date=November 22, 2006 |accessdate=May 19, 2014}}</ref> It failed in 2005 and was again repaired; however, it does not rotate with the same ease it once did.\n\nCoral Castle remains a popular tourist attraction. Books, magazines, and television programs speculate about how Leedskalnin was able to construct the structure and move stones that weigh many tons. Claims that nobody had ever seen Leedskalnin at work and that he levitated his stones have been repudiated.  Orval Irwin reportedly witnessed him quarry his stones and erect parts of his wall, and illustrated the methods in his book ''Mr. Can't Is Dead''.<ref name=\"Mr. Can't is Dead\">{{cite book | title=Mr. Can't is Dead: The Story of the Coral Castle | first=Orval M. | last=Irwin | location=Homestead, FL | date=1996 | oclc=45263633 }}</ref>  The Nemith Film Collection produced a short film documentary in 1944 of him at work {{Contradict-inline|reason=Darren Nemeth credits the video to Universal Studios 'Person-Oddities' series, possibly 'THE FANTASTIC CASTLE' from May 1944 (Person Oddity, no. 131).

{"title_page": "List of Old West gunfighters", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2014}}\nThis is a '''list of <!--KNOWN Gunfighters ONLY, preferably one with his/her own article-->Old West gunfighters''', referring to [[outlaw]]s or [[wikt:lawmen|lawmen]], of the [[American frontier]] who gained fame or notoriety during the [[American Old West|American Wild West]] or Old West. Some listed were never gunfighters. The term ''gunslinger'' is a modern, 20th-century invention, often used in cinema or other media to refer to men in the American Old West who had gained a reputation as being dangerous with a gun. A [[gunfighter]] may or may not be an outlaw or a lawman.  An outlaw had usually been convicted of a crime, such as [[Charles Bolles|Black Bart]], but may have only gained a reputation as operating outside the law, such as [[Ike Clanton]]. Some of those listed may have also served in law enforcement, like Marshal [[Burt Alvord]] who subsequently became an outlaw, and some outlaws like [[Johnny Ringo]] were deputized at one time or another. Some of the gunfighters listed included professionals, [[Reconnaissance|scout]]s, businessmen, and even [[physician|doctor]]s.\n{{Horizontal TOC|nonum=y}}\n\n==Outlaws==\n{{seealso|Outlaw (stock character)}}\nThe majority of outlaws in the Old West preyed on banks, trains, and stagecoaches. Some crimes were carried out by Mexicans and Native Americans against [[White Americans|white citizens]] who were targets of opportunity along the U.S.\u2013Mexico border, particularly in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California. For example, [[Pancho Villa]] was a [[bandit]] from [[Durango]], [[Mexico]] who also conducted cross-border raids into New Mexico and Texas. Some individuals, like [[Jesse James]], became outlaws after serving in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Some were simply men who took advantage of the wildness and lawlessness of the frontier to enrich themselves at the expense of others. Some outlaws migrated to the frontier to escape prosecution for crimes elsewhere.\n\n==Lawmen==\nLaw was present, if spread thin, in the American Old West. It was usually present on three levels: the [[United States Marshals Service|Deputy U.S. Marshal]], the county [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]], and the [[Marshal#State and local marshals|town marshal]] or [[Constables in the United States|constable]]. Sometimes their jurisdictions overlapped which could lead to [[Cochise County in the Old West|conflicts]] like those between Deputy U.S. Marshal [[Virgil Earp]] and [[Cochise County, Arizona]] Sheriff [[Johnny Behan]]. When an outlaw committed a crime, the local sheriff or marshal would usually form a [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse]] to attempt to capture them.  Rewards were posted for outlaws which encouraged citizens to capture or kill them for the reward, leading to the profession of [[bounty hunter]] - People whom would find and capture/kill those who the law had placed a [[bounty]] on their head, hence the bounty hunter\n\n== A ==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[John Hicks Adams]] (1820\u20131878)\n* [[Robert Clay Allison]] (1840\u20131887)\n* [[Burt Alvord]] (1867\u20131910)\n* [[Reno Gang|Charlie Anderson]] (1844\u20131868)\n* [[Billy Wilson (outlaw)|David L. \"Billy Wilson\" Anderson]] (1862\u20131918)\n* [[Peter Alston]] (1765-1804)\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n== B ==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Cullen Baker]] (1835\u20131869)\n* [[Nick Barkley]] (1860\u20131915)\n* [[Seaborn Barnes]] (1849?\u20131878)\n* [[Richard H.

Some listed were never gunfighters. The term ''gunslinger'' is a modern, 20th-century invention, often used in cinema or other media to refer to men in the American Old West who had gained a reputation as being dangerous with a gun. A [[gunfighter]] may or may not be an outlaw or a lawman.  An outlaw had usually been convicted of a crime, such as [[Charles Bolles|Black Bart]], but may have only gained a reputation as operating outside the law, such as [[Ike Clanton]]. Some of those listed may have also served in law enforcement, like Marshal [[Burt Alvord]] who subsequently became an outlaw, and some outlaws like [[Johnny Ringo]] were deputized at one time or another. Some of the gunfighters listed included professionals, [[Reconnaissance|scout]]s, businessmen, and even [[physician|doctor]]s.\n{{Horizontal TOC|nonum=y}}\n\n==Outlaws==\n{{seealso|Outlaw (stock character)}}\nThe majority of outlaws in the Old West preyed on banks, trains, and stagecoaches. Some crimes were carried out by Mexicans and Native Americans against [[White Americans|white citizens]] who were targets of opportunity along the U.S.\u2013Mexico border, particularly in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California. For example, [[Pancho Villa]] was a [[bandit]] from [[Durango]], [[Mexico]] who also conducted cross-border raids into New Mexico and Texas. Some individuals, like [[Jesse James]], became outlaws after serving in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Some were simply men who took advantage of the wildness and lawlessness of the frontier to enrich themselves at the expense of others. Some outlaws migrated to the frontier to escape prosecution for crimes elsewhere.\n\n==Lawmen==\nLaw was present, if spread thin, in the American Old West. It was usually present on three levels: the [[United States Marshals Service|Deputy U.S. Marshal]], the county [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]], and the [[Marshal#State and local marshals|town marshal]] or [[Constables in the United States|constable]]. Sometimes their jurisdictions overlapped which could lead to [[Cochise County in the Old West|conflicts]] like those between Deputy U.S. Marshal [[Virgil Earp]] and [[Cochise County, Arizona]] Sheriff [[Johnny Behan]]. When an outlaw committed a crime, the local sheriff or marshal would usually form a [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse]] to attempt to capture them.  Rewards were posted for outlaws which encouraged citizens to capture or kill them for the reward, leading to the profession of [[bounty hunter]] - People whom would find and capture/kill those who the law had placed a [[bounty]] on their head, hence the bounty hunter\n\n== A ==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[John Hicks Adams]] (1820\u20131878)\n* [[Robert Clay Allison]] (1840\u20131887)\n* [[Burt Alvord]] (1867\u20131910)\n* [[Reno Gang|Charlie Anderson]] (1844\u20131868)\n* [[Billy Wilson (outlaw)|David L. \"Billy Wilson\" Anderson]] (1862\u20131918)\n* [[Peter Alston]] (1765-1804)\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n== B ==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Cullen Baker]] (1835\u20131869)\n* [[Nick Barkley]] (1860\u20131915)\n* [[Seaborn Barnes]] (1849?\u20131878)\n* [[Richard H.

Two of the squadron's aircraft were sent to [[Turkey]] following the major earthquake it suffered in November 1999. 846 NAS was temporarily stationed at RAF Benson in Oxfordshire as part of the Merlin transition until it relocated back to RNAS Yeovilton on 26 March 2015.<ref name=home/>\n\nIn March 2016, 846 NAS was given the role of Maritime Counter Terrorism after the disbandment of 848 Naval Air Squadron and its Sea King HC4 helicopters.<ref name=rare>{{cite web|url=https://theaviationist.com/2016/02/21/rare-insight-into-royal-navy-chf/|title=Rare insight into the Royal Navy\u2019s Commando Helicopter Force|date=21 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== 847 Naval Air Squadron ===\n847 NAS operates [[AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat|Wildcat AH1]] helicopters, in light transport and reconnaissance roles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/article/51218/the-847-naval-air-squadron-transitions-to-the-agustawestland-wildcat-ah-1-helicopter-interview-with-major-david-sutton-royal-marines-senior-pilot|title=The 847 Naval Air Squadron transitions to the AgustaWestland Wildcat AH.1 helicopter Interview with Major David Sutton Royal Marines, Senior Pilot|date=7 May 2015|publisher=Janes|accessdate=30 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Decommissioned Unit ==\n\n=== 848 Naval Air Squadron ===\n848 NAS was the Commando Sea King HC4 training unit for the CHF, and trained not only the aircrews but also the ground crews.

Being a naval unit that was directly tasked with supporting the Royal Marines, trainees are also schooled in shipboard and amphibious assault operations. A special unit within 848 Squadron, M Flight, was tasked with supporting the [[Special Boat Service]] (SBS) in their operations. 848 NAS disbanded in 2013 but then reformed on 1 May 2015 to continue operating the Sea Kings, maintaining operational capability within the CHF while 845 NAS converted to the Merlin, until the Sea King reached its planned out of service date on 31 March 2016.<ref name=\"forces.tv\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fleetairarmoa.org/news/848-nas-awarded-the-bambara-flight-safety-shield|title=848 NAS awarded the Bambara flight safety shield|website=fleetairarmoa.org}}</ref> 848 NAS disbanded 24 March 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news-and-latest-activity/news/2016/march/24/160324-decommissioning-of-sea-king-848-naval-air-squadron|title=It really is goodbye to the 'old girl' \u2013 Royal Navy|website=royalnavy.mod.uk}}</ref>\n\n==Personnel==\nAircrew, recruited from the Fleet Air Arm and Royal Marines, join the force having completed training in helicopter operations under [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAF|No. 1 Flying Training School]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shropshirestar.com/news/local-hubs/north-shropshire/shawbury/2020/02/29/raf-chief-opens-state-of-the-art-helicopter-training-facilities-in-shawbury/|title=https://www.shropshirestar.com/news/local-hubs/north-shropshire/shawbury/2020/02/29/raf-chief-opens-state-of-the-art-helicopter-training-facilities-in-shawbury/|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> at [[RAF Shawbury]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/uk-mod-begins-training-helicopter-acquisition-403559/ |title=UK MoD begins training helicopter acquisition|date= 10 September 2014|publisher=Flight Global|accessdate=30 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/our-organisation/the-fighting-arms/fleet-air-arm/support-and-training/commando-helicopter-force-headquarters Royal Navy \u2013 Commando Helicopter Force]\n*[http://www.fleetairarmoa.org/gallery-commando-helicopter-force Fleet Air Arm Association \u2013 Commando Helicopter Force]\n\n[[Category:Royal Marine formations and units]]\n[[Category:Naval aviation units and formations of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations established in 1997]]\n", "name_user": "The Beanster", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added info about HC3/3a \u2014> HC4/4A and MLSP", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commando_Helicopter_Force"}

[[Edward I of England|King Edward I]] had them erected between 1291 and about 1295 in memory of his wife [[Eleanor of Castile]], who died in November 1290, marking the nightly resting-places along the route taken when her body was transported to London. The crosses stood at [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]], [[Grantham]] and [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]], all in [[Lincolnshire]]; [[Geddington]] and [[Hardingstone]] in [[Northamptonshire]]; [[Stony Stratford]] in [[Buckinghamshire]]; [[Woburn, Bedfordshire|Woburn]] and [[Dunstable]] in [[Bedfordshire]]; [[St Albans]] and Waltham (now [[Waltham Cross]]) in [[Hertfordshire]]; [[Cheapside]] in London; and Charing (now [[Charing Cross]]) in [[Westminster]]. Three \u2013 those at Geddington, Hardingstone and Waltham Cross \u2013 survive more or less intact; but the other nine, other than a few fragments, are lost. The largest and most ornate of the twelve was Charing Cross.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Procession and burials===\n[[File:Eleonora Eduard1.jpg|thumb|[[Eleanor of Castile]], Queen Consort of England 1272\u201390]]\n\nFollowing her death on 28 November 1290 at [[Harby, Nottinghamshire]], the body of Queen Eleanor was carried to [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]], about {{convert|7|mi|km}} away, where she was embalmed \u2013 probably either at the [[Gilbertine]] [[St Catherine's, Lincoln#St Catherine's|priory of St Catherine]] in the south of the city, or at the priory of the Dominicans.<ref>Powrie 1990, pp. 32\u201334.</ref> Her [[Organ (anatomy)|viscera]], less her heart, were buried in the Angel Choir of [[Lincoln Cathedral]] on 3 December.<ref>Cockerill 2014, p. 344.</ref> Eleanor's other remains were carried to London, a journey of about {{convert|180|mi|km}}, that lasted 12 days.

Their construction is documented in the executors' account rolls, which survive from 1291 to March 1294, but not thereafter.<ref>Botfield and Turner 1841.</ref> By the end of that period, the crosses at Lincoln, Hardingstone, Stony Stratford, Woburn, Dunstable, St Albans and Waltham were complete or nearly so, and those at Cheapside and Charing in progress; but those at Grantham, Stamford and Geddington apparently not yet begun.

Master masons included Richard of Crundale, Roger of Crundale (probably Richard's brother), Michael of Canterbury, Richard of Stow, John of Battle and Nicholas Dymenge.<ref name=\"colv483_4\"/> Sculptors included [[Alexander of Abingdon]] and William of Ireland, both of whom had worked at Westminster Abbey, who were paid \u00a33 6s. 8d. apiece for the statues; and Ralph of Chichester.<ref>Hastings 1955, pp. 20\u201321.</ref><ref>Powrie 1990, p. 65.</ref><ref>Cockerill 2014, p. 357.</ref><ref>Liversidge 1989.</ref>\n\n===Purpose and parallels===\nEleanor's crosses appear to have been intended in part as expressions of royal power; and in part as [[cenotaph]]s to encourage [[chantry chapel|prayers for her soul]] from travellers.<ref>''Chronicle of St Albans''.</ref><ref>Colvin 1963, p. 485.</ref><ref>Cockerill 2014, pp. 351\u201352.</ref> On the pedestal of each was inscribed the phrase ''Orate pro anima'' (\"Pray for [her] soul\").<ref>Hunter 1842, p. 180.</ref>\n\nIt was not unknown for [[memorial cross]]es to be constructed in the middle ages, although they were normally isolated instances and relatively simple in design. A cross in the [[Strand, London|Strand]], near London, was said to have been erected by [[William II of England|William II]] in memory of his mother, [[Matilda of Flanders|Queen Matilda]] (d. 1083). [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] erected one at [[Merton (parish)|Merton]], Surrey, for his cousin the [[William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey|Earl of Surrey]] (d. 1240). Another was erected at [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] for Edward I's sister [[Beatrice of England|Beatrice]] (d. 1275). Yet another, almost contemporary with the Eleanor crosses, was erected near [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] for Edward's mother, [[Eleanor of Provence]] (d.1291).<ref name=\"colv484_5\">Colvin 1963, pp. 484\u201385.</ref><ref>Parsons 1991, pp. 18, 60.</ref><ref>Parsons 1995, p. 209.</ref>\n\nThe closest precedent for the Eleanor crosses, and almost certainly their model, was the series of nine crosses known as ''montjoies'' erected along the funeral route of King [[Louis IX of France]] in 1271. These were elaborate structures incorporating sculptural representations of the King, and were erected in part to promote his [[canonisation]] (a campaign that in 1297 succeeded). Eleanor's crosses never aspired to this last purpose, but in design were even larger and more ornate than the ''montjoies'', being of at least three rather than two tiers.<ref name=\"evans\">{{cite journal |first=Joan |last=Evans |authorlink=Joan Evans (art historian) |title=A prototype of the Eleanor crosses |journal=[[Burlington Magazine]] |volume=91 |year=1949 |pages=96\u201397 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Branner |authorlink=Robert Branner |chapter=The Montjoies of Saint Louis |editor1-first=Douglas |editor1-last=Fraser |editor2-first=Howard |editor2-last=Hibbard |editor2-link=Howard Hibbard |editor3-first=Milton J. |editor3-last=Lewine |title=Essays in the History of Architecture presented to Rudolf Wittkower |location=London |publisher=Phaidon |year=1967 |pages=13\u201316 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=John |last=Zukowsky |title=Montjoies and Eleanor Crosses reconsidered |journal=[[Gesta (journal)|Gesta]] |volume=13 |issue=1 |year=1974 |pages=39\u201344 }}</ref><ref name=\"colv484_5\"/><ref>Cockerill 2014, p. 351.</ref>\n\n==The twelve crosses==\n===Lincoln===\n[[File:Lincoln 128a.jpg|thumb|upright|The surviving fragment of the Lincoln cross]]\n<small>({{Coord|53|12|51|N|00|32|47|W|region:GB}})</small><br/>\nEleanor's viscera were buried in Lincoln Cathedral on 3 December 1290.

Master masons included Richard of Crundale, Roger of Crundale (probably Richard's brother), Michael of Canterbury, Richard of Stow, John of Battle and Nicholas Dymenge.<ref name=\"colv483_4\"/> Sculptors included [[Alexander of Abingdon]] and William of Ireland, both of whom had worked at Westminster Abbey, who were paid \u00a33 6s. 8d. apiece for the statues; and Ralph of Chichester.<ref>Hastings 1955, pp. 20\u201321.</ref><ref>Powrie 1990, p. 65.</ref><ref>Cockerill 2014, p. 357.</ref><ref>Liversidge 1989.</ref>\n\n===Purpose and parallels===\nEleanor's crosses appear to have been intended in part as expressions of royal power; and in part as [[cenotaph]]s to encourage [[chantry chapel|prayers for her soul]] from travellers.<ref>''Chronicle of St Albans''.</ref><ref>Colvin 1963, p. 485.</ref><ref>Cockerill 2014, pp. 351\u201352.</ref> On the pedestal of each was inscribed the phrase ''Orate pro anima'' (\"Pray for [her] soul\").<ref>Hunter 1842, p. 180.</ref>\n\nIt was not unknown for [[memorial cross]]es to be constructed in the middle ages, although they were normally isolated instances and relatively simple in design. A cross in the [[Strand, London|Strand]], near London, was said to have been erected by [[William II of England|William II]] in memory of his mother, [[Matilda of Flanders|Queen Matilda]] (d. 1083). [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] erected one at [[Merton (parish)|Merton]], Surrey, for his cousin the [[William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey|Earl of Surrey]] (d. 1240). Another was erected at [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] for Edward I's sister [[Beatrice of England|Beatrice]] (d. 1275). Yet another, almost contemporary with the Eleanor crosses, was erected near [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] for Edward's mother, [[Eleanor of Provence]] (d.1291).<ref name=\"colv484_5\">Colvin 1963, pp. 484\u201385.</ref><ref>Parsons 1991, pp. 18, 60.</ref><ref>Parsons 1995, p. 209.</ref>\n\nThe closest precedent for the Eleanor crosses, and almost certainly their model, was the series of nine crosses known as ''montjoies'' erected along the funeral route of King [[Louis IX of France]] in 1271. These were elaborate structures incorporating sculptural representations of the King, and were erected in part to promote his [[canonisation]] (a campaign that in 1297 succeeded).
