During the shooting of the film ''Afsar (1950)'', Dev Anand again formally proposed to her and gave her an engagement diamond ring worth rupees 3000.

He was the founder of the [[Iona Community]] on the island of Iona.\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born in [[Glasgow]] in 1895. His father (Sir [[Sir John MacLeod, 1st Baronet|John MacLeod]]) was a successful businessman before entering politics as a [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Unionist]] MP; his mother Edith was from a wealthy [[Lancashire|Lancastrian]] family (owning cotton mills). From this background and heir to a baronetcy, George MacLeod was educated at [[Winchester College]] and [[Oriel College, Oxford]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Millar|first1=Barbara|title=The war hero who fell  to his knees and  surrendered to Christ|url=http://www.scottishreview.net/Backpage135.shtml|publisher=Scottish Review|accessdate=17 January 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123151549/http://www.scottishreview.net/Backpage135.shtml|archivedate=23 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> His paternal grandfather was the highly respected Revd [[Norman Macleod (1812\u20131872)|Norman MacLeod]] of the [[Barony Church]], [[Glasgow]], a [[Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] and Chaplain to [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].\n\n==World War I service==\nUpon the outbreak of World War I in 1914,  MacLeod joined the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]], rising to the rank of [[Captain (land)|Captain]]. He first saw active service in Greece. After falling ill with [[dysentery]], he was sent back to Scotland to recuperate, after which he was posted to [[Flanders]]. He saw action at [[Ypres]] and [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]], for which he was awarded the [[Military Cross]] (MC) and the French [[Croix de guerre 1914-1918 (France)|Croix de Guerre]] for bravery.\n\n==Ministry==\nHis experience of this total war profoundly affected MacLeod, leading him to train for the ministry. He studied divinity at the [[University of Edinburgh]], followed by a year at [[Union Theological Seminary (Manhattan)|Union Theological Seminary]], New York City (1921-1922). Upon return to Scotland he was invited to become Assistant at [[St Giles' Cathedral]]. During this period he became increasingly concerned over the issue of social inequality in Scotland. In 1924 he was ordained as a [[Church of Scotland]] minister, to be Padre of [[Toc H]] (Talbot House) in Scotland. Such non-parochial appointments were extremely unusual at the time. Following a disagreement, he resigned from Toc H in 1926, but was invited to become associate minister at [[St Cuthbert's Church, Edinburgh]].\n\nHis wartime experiences, combined with a profound disillusionment by post-World War I political rhetoric of \"a land fit for heroes,\" deeply affected him. Confronted by the realities of the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|depression]] and unemployment faced by those less privileged than he, MacLeod gradually moved towards supporting [[socialism]] and [[pacifism]]. From 1937 he became actively involved with the [[Peace Pledge Union]] (PPU), and from 1958 with the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] (CND).\n\nMeanwhile, in 1930, to considerable surprise, he decided to leave St Cuthbert's Church to become minister at [[Govan Old Parish Church]]&mdash;encountering the considerable social problems caused by poverty in this part of Glasgow. The pace of work took its toll and in 1932 he suffered a [[mental breakdown|breakdown]]. He spent some time recuperating in [[Jerusalem]] in early 1933. While worshipping in an [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] on [[Easter Day]] he felt a profound spiritual experience, feeling a sense of recovery of the Church as the corporate [[Body of Christ]]. This would strongly influence the rest of his life.\n\nHe resigned (giving up the financial security of a [[parish]] minister's [[stipend]]) to become the full-time leader of the [[Iona Community]], which he founded in 1938.

Underpinning the fellowship of the Community were four emphases: mission, political involvement, a ministry of healing, and worship, by which MacLeod and the Community sought a way to connect the Church with an industrial age. He led a series of parish missions (sometimes known as a 'Message of Friendship') in Scottish parishes associated with the Community, and supported the 1950 Glasgow Churches' Campaign and the 1950s [[Tell Scotland Movement]].

It was first noted as a developing tropical low within a trough of low pressure during April 1, while it was located to the east of [[Papua New Guinea]]. Over the next day, the system moved south-eastwards over the [[Solomon Sea]], before it was classified as a tropical cyclone and named Harold by the Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]]. The system moved into the [[Fiji Meteorological Service|Fiji Meteorological Service's]] area of responsibility on April&nbsp;2 and began to explosively intensify by April&nbsp;3, reaching Category 4 status by April&nbsp;4 on both scales. The next day, it further strengthened into a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, the highest rating on the Australian scale. It made landfall on [[Espiritu Santo]] on April&nbsp;6. Shortly afterward, the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) upgraded it to a Category 5-equivalent cyclone on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]]. It maintained this status for only six hours before being downgraded back to Category 4.\n\nHarold was the first Category 5 severe tropical cyclone to occur in the South Pacific basin since [[Cyclone Gita]] in 2018 and was also the second-strongest tropical cyclone to ever affect [[Vanuatu]], behind [[Cyclone Pam]] in 2015.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vanuatu Reeling from Category 5 Harold, Now

Over the next day, the system moved south-eastwards over the [[Solomon Sea]], before it was classified as a tropical cyclone and named Harold by the Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]]. The system moved into the [[Fiji Meteorological Service|Fiji Meteorological Service's]] area of responsibility on April&nbsp;2 and began to explosively intensify by April&nbsp;3, reaching Category 4 status by April&nbsp;4 on both scales. The next day, it further strengthened into a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, the highest rating on the Australian scale. It made landfall on [[Espiritu Santo]] on April&nbsp;6. Shortly afterward, the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) upgraded it to a Category 5-equivalent cyclone on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]]. It maintained this status for only six hours before being downgraded back to Category 4.\n\nHarold was the first Category 5 severe tropical cyclone to occur in the South Pacific basin since [[Cyclone

Developed by [[Ronald D. Moore]], the show premiered on August 9, 2014, on [[Starz]]. It stars [[Caitriona Balfe]] as [[Claire Fraser (character)|Claire Randall]], a married former [[World War II]] nurse who in 1946 finds herself transported back to [[Scotland]] in 1743. There she encounters the dashing [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] warrior [[Jamie Fraser (character)|Jamie Fraser]] ([[Sam Heughan]]) and becomes embroiled in the [[Jacobite risings]]. The first season of the television series is based on the first novel in the series, ''[[Outlander (novel)|Outlander]]'' (also known as ''Cross Stitch'').\n\nThe second season of 13 episodes, based on ''[[Dragonfly in Amber]]'', premiered on April 9, 2016. On June 1, Starz renewed the series for a third and fourth season, which adapt the third and fourth ''Outlander'' novels, ''[[Voyager (novel)|Voyager]]'' and ''[[Drums of Autumn]],'' respectively. The 13-episode third season premiered on September 10, 2017. The 13-episode fourth season premiered on November 4, 2018. Starz has renewed the series for fifth and sixth seasons; the fifth premiered on February 16, 2020.\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n{{main|List of Outlander episodes}}\n{{:List of Outlander episodes}}\n\n===Season 1 (2014\u201315)===\nIn 1946, former World War II nurse Claire Randall and her husband Frank are visiting [[Inverness]], Scotland, when she is carried from the standing stones at Craigh na Dun back in time to 1743. She falls in with a group of rebel [[Scottish Highlands|Highlanders]] from [[Clan]] MacKenzie, who are being pursued by English [[Red coat (military uniform)|redcoats]] led by Captain Jonathan \"Black Jack\" Randall, Frank's ancestor. She marries a Highlander, Jamie Fraser, out of necessity, but they quickly fall in love. The Clan suspect her of being a spy, and retain her as a healer, preventing her from attempting to return to her own time. Knowing that the Jacobite cause is doomed to fail, Claire tries to warn them against rebellion. Her husband Jamie is captured, tortured, and raped by the sadistic Randall, but Claire and his clansmen rescue him. Claire tells Jamie that she is pregnant and they set sail for France.\n\n===Season 2 (2016)===\nIn Paris, Claire and Jamie try to thwart the Jacobites by subverting the funds that King [[Louis XV of France]] is likely to provide. Jamie becomes the confidante of [[Charles Edward Stuart|Charles Stuart]], but the Frasers fail to prevent the risings. Randall reappears in Paris, but Claire makes Jamie swear to keep him alive until Frank's descent is assured. She achieves this by convincing Randall to marry Mary Hawkins. Claire loses her baby, and she and Jamie return to Scotland. The Jacobites win the [[Battle of Prestonpans]].\n\nBefore the [[Battle of Culloden]], Jamie convinces Claire, pregnant again, to return to the 20th century. Jamie decides to die fighting at Culloden with his clan. Back in her own century, Claire tells Frank about her time travel. He asks her to forget Jamie, and let him raise their child as his own. Twenty years later, Frank has died. Claire takes her daughter Brianna to Scotland. Claire discovers that Jamie did not die at Culloden, and vows to return to him.\n\n===Season 3 (2017)===\nJamie kills Randall at Culloden, and is gravely injured, but spared execution. At Ardsmuir prison, he befriends the governor [[Lord John Grey (character)|Lord John Grey]], who later paroles him to work at an English estate. There Jamie is manipulated into a sexual liaison and fathers an illegitimate son, William. Jamie returns to Scotland and becomes a printer.\n\nIn 1948, Claire enrolls in medical school in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. Frank is killed in a car accident while Brianna is in college. With the help of Roger Wakefield, Claire finds clues to Jamie's fate after Culloden. She returns to the 18th century, and discovers Jamie has married a widowed Laoghaire. Claire's return nullifies their union as illegal. They try to retrieve some hidden treasure so that he can placate Laoghaire with a settlement. But his nephew Ian is captured by pirates and taken to the Caribbean. Jamie and Claire follow, and manage to rescue him from Geillis (who had escaped burning at the stake in season one). Claire and Jamie sail for Scotland, but are shipwrecked on the coast of [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]].\n\n===Season 4 (2018\u201319)===\nIn the [[Thirteen Colonies|British colony]] of [[Province of North-Carolina|North Carolina]], Claire and Jamie seek to return to Scotland with Fergus, Marsali, and Ian. They visit the plantation of Jamie's aunt Jocasta Cameron, where they see conditions of [[slavery in the United States|enslaved African Americans]]. Claire and Jamie decide to leave, and claim land that they name Fraser's Ridge, which is already inhabited by [[Cherokee]]. Jamie reunites with Murtagh, now a [[blacksmith]] and leader of the [[War of the Regulation|Regulator movement]]. Lord John visits with Jamie's son, Willy. \n\nIn the 1970s, Brianna rejects Roger's marriage proposal. After learning her parents will die in a fire, Brianna travels through the stones. Roger follows her. They meet in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] and enter into [[handfast marriage]].  Bonnet rapes Brianna. She discovers she is pregnant. Roger goes to Fraser's Ridge where Jamie wrongly assumes that he is the rapist, and beats him. Young Ian sells Roger to the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]]. Discovering their mistake, they set off to rescue Roger, and Ian trades his freedom for Roger's. Roger and Brianna are reunited at Jocasta's plantation. Jamie receives instructions to kill Murtagh, who is a fugitive.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Main|List of Outlander characters}}\n{{Div col}}\n<!-- Only list actors who are credited in the opening titles. -->\n* [[Caitriona Balfe]] as [[Claire Fraser (character)|Claire Beauchamp Randall/Fraser]]\n* [[Sam Heughan]] as [[Jamie Fraser (character)|James \"Jamie\" MacKenzie Fraser]]\n* [[Tobias Menzies]] as Frank Randall (seasons 1\u20134){{efn|Menzies only appears in one episode of season four, although credited as a main cast member.}} /<br>Jonathan \"Black Jack\" Randall (seasons 1\u20133)\n* [[Graham McTavish]] as Dougal MacKenzie (seasons 1\u20132) /<br>William \"Buck\" MacKenzie (season 5)\n* Duncan Lacroix as Murtagh Fitzgibbons Fraser (seasons 1\u20135)\n* Grant O'Rourke as Rupert MacKenzie (seasons 1\u20133){{efn|O'Rourke only appears in one episode of season three, although credited as a main cast member.}}\n* [[Stephen Walters]] as Angus Mhor (seasons 1\u20132)\n* [[Gary Lewis (actor)|Gary Lewis]] as Colum MacKenzie (seasons 1\u20132)\n* [[Lotte Verbeek]] as Geillis Duncan {{a.k.a.}} Gillian Edgars (seasons 1\u20133){{efn|Verbeek only appears in one episode of season two, although credited as a main cast member.}}\n* [[Bill Paterson (actor)|Bill Paterson]] as Edward \"Ned\" Gowan (seasons 1, 3){{efn|Paterson only appears in one episode of season three, although credited as a main cast member.}}\n* [[Simon Callow]] as Clarence Marylebone, Duke of Sandringham (seasons 1\u20132){{efn|Callow only appears in one episode of season one, although credited as a main cast member.}}\n* [[Laura Donnelly (actress)|Laura Donnelly]] as Janet \"Jenny\" Fraser Murray (seasons 1\u20133){{efn|Donnelly only appears in one episode of season two, although credited as a main cast member.}}\n* [[Douglas Henshall]] as Taran MacQuarrie (season 1)\n* [[Steven Cree]] as Ian Murray (seasons 1\u20134){{efn|Cree only appears in one episode of season two and one episode of season four, although credited as a main cast member.}}\n* [[Stanley Weber]] as [[Count of St. Germain|Le Comte St. Germain]] (season 2)\n* [[Andrew Gower (actor)|Andrew Gower]] as Prince [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (seasons 2\u20133){{efn|Gower only appears in one episode of season three, although credited as a main cast member.}}\n* [[Rosie Day]] as Mary Hawkins (season 2)\n* [[Dominique Pinon]] as Master Raymond (season 2)\n* [[Frances de la Tour]] as Mother Hildegarde (season 2)\n* [[Nell Hudson]] as Laoghaire MacKenzie (seasons 2\u20134;

Developed by [[Ronald D. Moore]], the show premiered on August 9, 2014, on [[Starz]]. It stars [[Caitriona Balfe]] as [[Claire Fraser (character)|Claire Randall]], a married former [[World War II]] nurse who in 1946 finds herself transported back to [[Scotland]] in 1743. There she encounters the dashing [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] warrior [[Jamie Fraser (character)|Jamie Fraser]] ([[Sam Heughan]]) and becomes embroiled in the [[Jacobite risings]]. The first season of the television series is based on the first novel in the series, ''[[Outlander (novel)|Outlander]]'' (also known as ''Cross Stitch'').\n\nThe second season of 13 episodes, based on ''[[Dragonfly in Amber]]'', premiered on April 9, 2016. On June 1, Starz renewed the series for a third and fourth season, which adapt the third and fourth ''Outlander'' novels, ''[[Voyager (novel)|Voyager]]'' and ''[[Drums of Autumn]],'' respectively.

She falls in with a group of rebel [[Scottish Highlands|Highlanders]] from [[Clan]] MacKenzie, who are being pursued by English [[Red coat (military uniform)|redcoats]] led by Captain Jonathan \"Black Jack\" Randall, Frank's ancestor. She marries a Highlander, Jamie Fraser, out of necessity, but they quickly fall in love. The Clan suspect her of being a spy, and retain her as a healer, preventing her from attempting to return to her own time. Knowing that the Jacobite cause is doomed to fail, Claire tries to warn them against rebellion. Her husband Jamie is captured, tortured, and raped by the sadistic Randall, but Claire and his clansmen rescue him. Claire tells Jamie that she is pregnant and they set sail for France.\n\n===Season 2 (2016)===\nIn Paris, Claire and Jamie try to thwart the Jacobites by subverting the funds that King [[Louis XV of France]] is likely to provide. Jamie becomes the confidante of [[Charles Edward Stuart|Charles Stuart]], but the Frasers fail to prevent the risings. Randall reappears in Paris, but Claire makes Jamie swear to keep him alive until Frank's descent is assured. She achieves this by convincing Randall to marry Mary Hawkins. Claire loses her baby, and she and Jamie return to Scotland. The Jacobites win the [[Battle of Prestonpans]].\n\nBefore the [[Battle of Culloden]], Jamie convinces Claire, pregnant again, to return to the 20th century. Jamie decides to die fighting at Culloden with his clan. Back in her own century, Claire tells Frank about her time travel. He asks her to forget Jamie, and let him raise their child as his own. Twenty years later, Frank has died. Claire takes her daughter Brianna to Scotland. Claire discovers that Jamie did not die at Culloden, and vows to return to him.\n\n===Season 3 (2017)===\nJamie kills Randall at Culloden, and is gravely injured, but spared execution. At Ardsmuir prison, he befriends the governor [[Lord John Grey (character)|Lord John Grey]], who later paroles him to work at an English estate. There Jamie is manipulated into a sexual liaison and fathers an illegitimate son, William. Jamie returns to Scotland and becomes a printer.\n\nIn 1948, Claire enrolls in medical school in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. Frank is killed in a car accident while Brianna is in college. With the help of Roger Wakefield, Claire finds clues to Jamie's fate after Culloden. She returns to the 18th century, and discovers Jamie has married a widowed Laoghaire. Claire's return nullifies their union as illegal. They try to retrieve some hidden treasure so that he can placate Laoghaire with a settlement. But his nephew Ian is captured by pirates and taken to the Caribbean. Jamie and Claire follow, and manage to rescue him from Geillis (who had escaped burning at the stake in season one). Claire and Jamie sail for Scotland, but are shipwrecked on the coast of [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]].\n\n===Season 4 (2018\u201319)===\nIn the [[Thirteen Colonies|British colony]] of [[Province of North-Carolina|North Carolina]], Claire and Jamie seek to return to Scotland with Fergus, Marsali, and Ian. They visit the plantation of Jamie's aunt Jocasta Cameron, where they see conditions of [[slavery in the United States|enslaved African Americans]]. Claire and Jamie decide to leave, and claim land that they name Fraser's Ridge, which is already inhabited by [[Cherokee]]. Jamie reunites with Murtagh, now a [[blacksmith]] and leader of the [[War of the Regulation|Regulator movement]]. Lord John visits with Jamie's son, Willy. \n\nIn the 1970s, Brianna rejects Roger's marriage proposal. After learning her parents will die in a fire, Brianna travels through the stones. Roger follows her. They meet in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] and enter into [[handfast marriage]].  Bonnet rapes Brianna. She discovers she is pregnant. Roger goes to Fraser's Ridge where Jamie wrongly assumes that he is the rapist, and beats him. Young Ian sells Roger to the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]]. Discovering their mistake, they set off to rescue Roger, and Ian trades his freedom for Roger's. Roger and Brianna are reunited at Jocasta's plantation. Jamie receives instructions to kill Murtagh, who is a fugitive.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Main|List of Outlander characters}}\n{{Div col}}\n<!-- Only list actors who are credited in the opening titles. -->\n* [[Caitriona Balfe]] as [[Claire Fraser (character)|Claire Beauchamp Randall/Fraser]]\n* [[Sam Heughan]] as [[Jamie Fraser (character)|James \"Jamie\" MacKenzie Fraser]]\n* [[Tobias Menzies]] as Frank Randall (seasons 1\u20134){{efn|Menzies only appears in one episode of season four, although credited as a main cast member.}} /<br>Jonathan \"Black Jack\" Randall (seasons 1\u20133)\n* [[Graham McTavish]] as Dougal MacKenzie (seasons 1\u20132) /<br>William \"Buck\" MacKenzie (season 5)\n* Duncan Lacroix as Murtagh Fitzgibbons Fraser (seasons 1\u20135)\n* Grant O'Rourke as Rupert MacKenzie (seasons 1\u20133){{efn|O'Rourke only appears in one episode of season three, although credited as a main cast member.}}\n* [[Stephen Walters]] as Angus Mhor (seasons 1\u20132)\n* [[Gary Lewis (actor)|Gary Lewis]] as Colum MacKenzie (seasons 1\u20132)\n* [[Lotte Verbeek]] as Geillis Duncan {{a.k.a.}} Gillian Edgars (seasons 1\u20133){{efn|Verbeek only appears in one episode of season two, although credited as a main cast member.}}\n* [[Bill Paterson (actor)|Bill Paterson]] as Edward \"Ned\" Gowan (seasons 1, 3){{efn|Paterson only appears in one episode of season three, although credited as a main cast member.}}\n* [[Simon Callow]] as Clarence Marylebone, Duke of Sandringham (seasons 1\u20132){{efn|Callow only appears in one episode of season one, although credited as a main cast member.}}\n* [[Laura Donnelly (actress)|Laura Donnelly]] as Janet \"Jenny\" Fraser Murray (seasons 1\u20133){{efn|Donnelly only appears in one episode of season two, although credited as a main cast member.}}\n* [[Douglas Henshall]] as Taran MacQuarrie (season 1)\n* [[Steven Cree]] as Ian Murray (seasons 1\u20134){{efn|Cree only appears in one episode of season two and one episode of season four, although credited as a main cast member.}}\n* [[Stanley Weber]] as [[Count of St. Germain|Le Comte St. Germain]] (season 2)\n* [[Andrew Gower (actor)|Andrew Gower]] as Prince [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (seasons 2\u20133){{efn|Gower only appears in one episode of season three, although credited as a main cast member.}}\n* [[Rosie Day]] as Mary Hawkins (season 2)\n* [[Dominique Pinon]] as Master Raymond (season 2)\n* [[Frances de la Tour]] as Mother Hildegarde (season 2)\n* [[Nell Hudson]] as Laoghaire MacKenzie (seasons 2\u20134;

After turning professional later that year, he defeated [[Chris Byrd]] in 2000 to win the WBO heavyweight title. Klitschko's first reign as champion ended in an upset knockout loss to [[Corrie Sanders]] in 2003, which was followed by another knockout loss to [[Lamon Brewster]] in 2004. It was during this time that Klitschko hired [[Emanuel Steward]] as his trainer, which began an eight-year partnership that lasted until Steward's death in 2012. In particular, Steward was credited with Klitschko's transition from an aggressive puncher to a more defensively-oriented boxer, much as he had done with [[Lennox Lewis]] in 1995 to 2003.\n\nIn 2006, Klitschko regained a portion of the world heavyweight championship after defeating Chris Byrd in a rematch to win the IBF and IBO titles. He won the WBO title for a second time by defeating [[Sultan Ibragimov]] in 2008. Following his defeat of [[Ruslan Chagaev]] in 2009, Klitschko was awarded ''The Ring'' title, and lastly he won the WBA title from [[David Haye]] in 2011.

Klitschko's first reign as champion ended in an upset knockout loss to [[Corrie Sanders]] in 2003, which was followed by another knockout loss to [[Lamon Brewster]] in 2004. It was during this time that Klitschko hired [[Emanuel Steward]] as his trainer, which began an eight-year partnership that lasted until Steward's death in 2012. In particular, Steward was credited with Klitschko's transition from an aggressive puncher to a more defensively-oriented boxer, much as he had done with [[Lennox Lewis]] in 1995 to 2003.\n\nIn 2006, Klitschko regained a portion of the world heavyweight championship after defeating Chris Byrd in a rematch to win the IBF and IBO titles.
