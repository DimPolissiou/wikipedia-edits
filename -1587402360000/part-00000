For penance, his older brother, Raj Bakshi ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]), makes him fix it during which Veer sleeps and awakes to find that the car's music system has been stolen.\n\nThe men of a local gang leader, King ([[Boman Irani]]), try to sell drugs at a crab shack. Veer beats them up after they threaten Ishita. They then come back later to exact revenge on Veer, but Raj breaks up the fight. Raj visits him in hospital and learns King's hideout. He goes there, incapacitates the gang members, and burns their drug stash. Raj, his face shrouded by a hood, tells King's men his original name, Kaali. The next day, King suspecting Raj as Kaali as he is Veer\u2019s older brother, stops by Raj's shop to present to assess if Raj is Kaali. Raj appears humble and unthreatening, which leads to King thinking that Raj cannot be the tough Kaali. King makes a deal where Raj will fix all of King's cars in exchange for King\u2019s protection.\n\n'''Bulgaria, 2000:''' Raj accidentally runs over a woman named Meera Dev Malik ([[Kajol]]) while in a car chase. When he gets out to help her, the rival gang catches up with him, and he has to leave. After the car crash, Raj reveals that he and Veer are the sons of a businessman (don), Randhir Bakshi ([[Vinod Khanna]]). After the date with Meera, Raj has to leave the next day, to deliver a shipment for his father. Meera asks to come as it\u2019s her birthday and she wants Raj( Kaali) to spend her birthday with her, but he says it\u2019s too dangerous. \n\nRaj and his team are driving on a roadway when a series of vehicles come out of nowhere. Gun and car fights occur leading to all of Raj\u2019s(Kaali\u2019s) vehicles scattering on the roadway and Raj\u2019s (Kaali\u2019s)car flipping upside down. Out of one of the vehicles a female foot is shown stepping out, who turns out to be Meera. She walks over to Raj(Kaali) with a gun in hand, leans down and tells him she is actually the daughter of the rival gang's leader, Dev Malik ([[Kabir Bedi]]). Meera reveals that she betrayed Raj on Malik's advice though she is sparing his life, as it\u2019s her birthday.\n\nWhen they follow each other in their cars, Raj saves Meera from dying promising to kill if he sees her again. She declares her love for him and he forgives her. They make plans to tell their parents about their relationship.\n\n'''Present day:''' The film flashes back to Goa, where Veer discovers that his friend, Siddharth Segal aka Sidhu ([[Varun Sharma]]), drugged his coffee with sleeping pills and stole the sound system amongst other parts. Veer is upset, but Sidhu explains it is for his girlfriend, Jenny ([[Chetna Pande]]). Both agree to help each other secure girlfriends. As a consequence, Veer reveals his feelings to Ishita. Upon finding out about their relationship, Raj wants to meet Ishita's family. When Raj goes there, he discovers that Ishita is Malik's younger daughter and Meera's younger sister.\n\n'''Bulgaria, 2000:''' After talks, Malik agrees to meet Randhir, but secretly, Malik plans to kill Randhir. The meeting breaks into a shootout, during which Malik and Randhir shoot each other. Meera finds Raj with the gun, for which she shoots him; however, he survives the gunshot. Meera decides to move far away from Bulgaria and start a new life. Raj must forget as well and moves to start a new life.\n\n'''Present day:''' Now in Goa, Veer and Ishita try to figure out why their older siblings dislike each other.\n\nThey were told a made-up story by Raj\u2019s lieutenants as they scrambled to make up a story, taking hints from flashes of shows they see on the restaurant TV as a customer flips channels. After this,  they come up with several plots to bring Meera and Raj together. Mani ([[Johnny Lever]]) steals King's car and brings it to the shop, where Veer discovers drugs and burns them. King sees them burning something and asks to fix his white car. King's men come to Meera's house one night, but Raj shows up as Kaali and stops them from causing her any harm. Later in front of the church, King asks Meera about Kaali which she refuses sparing Raj's life. Meera issues an ultimatum that in order to marry Ishita, Veer must move in with Meera. It is revealed to Veer by Meera that Raj was Randhir's adopted son and is not Veer's older brother. Raghav ([[Nawab Shah]]), Malik's right hand, tells Meera that Raj did not kill Malik, but that Randhir had shot Malik in return to his bullet. Upon learning this, Meera is distraught with regret and remorse and takes Ishita to Raj\u2019s house, declaring that Veer can take Ishita home after marriage.\n\nAt Sidhu and Jenny's wedding, King shows up and sees his car confirming it as his car which was stolen. King starts to cause a disturbance, bringing Mani, Oscar(the bride's brother) and then Veer out. A fight ensues with Veer holding his own well until one blow sends him falling back and rolling when he stops at Meera\u2019s deer as she walks outside, she calls for Kaali, and Raj comes out and takes out everyone in his path beating King up. King stand up as Raj walked away to check in Veer, then tries to shoot Raj, but Meera seeing this pushes Raj away stepping in front of him and is accidentally shot as she tried to save Raj. Later. King gets beaten by Raj\u2019s men as they rushed him after he shoots Meera. Meera survives and both Raj and Meera reunite in hospital.\n'''Janam Janam lyrics:'''JANAM JANAM LYRICS\nJanam janam janam saath chalna yunhi\nKasam tumhe kasam aake milna yahin\nEk jaan hai bhale do badan ho judaa\nMeri hoke humesha hi rehna\nKabhi na kehna alvida\n\nMeri subah ho tumhi aur tumhi shaam ho\nTum dard ho tum hi aaraam ho\nMeri duaaon se aati hai bas ye sadaa\nMeri hoke humesha hi rehna\nKabhi na kehna alvida\n\nAha ha ha o\u2026\n\nMeri hoke humesha hi rehna\nKabhi na kehna Alvida\u2026\n\nTeri baahon mein hai mere dono jahaan\n[https://www.lyricsinhindisongs.com/home/song/janam-janam-lyrics/324 Read more click here]\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Shah Rukh Khan]] as Raj \"Kaali\" Randhir Bakshi\n* [[Kajol]] as Meera \"Pogo\" Dev Malik \n* [[Varun Dhawan]] as Veeresh \"Veer\" Bakshi\n* [[Kriti Sanon]] as Ishita \"Ishu\" Malik\n* [[Boman Irani]] as King\n* [[Johnny Lever]] as Mani\n* [[Sanjay Mishra (actor)|Sanjay Mishra]] as Oscar Verma\n* [[Varun Sharma]] as Siddharth \"Sidhu\" Segal\n* [[Chetna Pande]] as Jenny Verma\n* [[Mukesh Tiwari]] as Shakti Segal\n* [[Pankaj Tripathi]] as Anwar Ansari\n* [[Vinod Khanna]] as Randhir Bakshi\n* [[Kabir Bedi]] as Dev Malik\n* [[Nawab Shah (actor)|Nawab Shah]] as Raghav\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nIn January 2015, Rohit Shetty announced a project with [[Shah Rukh Khan]] in the lead which would be their second collaboration after the 2013 film ''[[Chennai Express]]''.

For penance, his older brother, Raj Bakshi ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]), makes him fix it during which Veer sleeps and awakes to find that the car's music system has been stolen.\n\nThe men of a local gang leader, King ([[Boman Irani]]), try to sell drugs at a crab shack. Veer beats them up after they threaten Ishita. They then come back later to exact revenge on Veer, but Raj breaks up the fight. Raj visits him in hospital and learns King's hideout. He goes there, incapacitates the gang members, and burns their drug stash. Raj, his face shrouded by a hood, tells King's men his original name, Kaali. The next day, King suspecting Raj as Kaali as he is Veer\u2019s older brother, stops by Raj's shop to present to assess if Raj is Kaali. Raj appears humble and unthreatening, which leads to King thinking that Raj cannot be the tough Kaali. King makes a deal where Raj will fix all of King's cars in exchange for King\u2019s protection.\n\n'''Bulgaria, 2000:''' Raj accidentally runs over a woman named Meera Dev Malik ([[Kajol]]) while in a car chase. When he gets out to help her, the rival gang catches up with him, and he has to leave. After the car crash, Raj reveals that he and Veer are the sons of a businessman (don), Randhir Bakshi ([[Vinod Khanna]]). After the date with Meera, Raj has to leave the next day, to deliver a shipment for his father. Meera asks to come as it\u2019s her birthday and she wants Raj( Kaali) to spend her birthday with her, but he says it\u2019s too dangerous. \n\nRaj and his team are driving on a roadway when a series of vehicles come out of nowhere. Gun and car fights occur leading to all of Raj\u2019s(Kaali\u2019s) vehicles scattering on the roadway and Raj\u2019s (Kaali\u2019s)car flipping upside down. Out of one of the vehicles a female foot is shown stepping out, who turns out to be Meera. She walks over to Raj(Kaali) with a gun in hand, leans down and tells him she is actually the daughter of the rival gang's leader, Dev Malik ([[Kabir Bedi]]). Meera reveals that she betrayed Raj on Malik's advice though she is sparing his life, as it\u2019s her birthday.\n\nWhen they follow each other in their cars, Raj saves Meera from dying promising to kill if he sees her again. She declares her love for him and he forgives her. They make plans to tell their parents about their relationship.\n\n'''Present day:''' The film flashes back to Goa, where Veer discovers that his friend, Siddharth Segal aka Sidhu ([[Varun Sharma]]), drugged his coffee with sleeping pills and stole the sound system amongst other parts. Veer is upset, but Sidhu explains it is for his girlfriend, Jenny ([[Chetna Pande]]). Both agree to help each other secure girlfriends. As a consequence, Veer reveals his feelings to Ishita. Upon finding out about their relationship, Raj wants to meet Ishita's family. When Raj goes there, he discovers that Ishita is Malik's younger daughter and Meera's younger sister.\n\n'''Bulgaria, 2000:''' After talks, Malik agrees to meet Randhir, but secretly, Malik plans to kill Randhir. The meeting breaks into a shootout, during which Malik and Randhir shoot each other. Meera finds Raj with the gun, for which she shoots him; however, he survives the gunshot. Meera decides to move far away from Bulgaria and start a new life. Raj must forget as well and moves to start a new life.\n\n'''Present day:''' Now in Goa, Veer and Ishita try to figure out why their older siblings dislike each other.\n\nThey were told a made-up story by Raj\u2019s lieutenants as they scrambled to make up a story, taking hints from flashes of shows they see on the restaurant TV as a customer flips channels. After this,  they come up with several plots to bring Meera and Raj together. Mani ([[Johnny Lever]]) steals King's car and brings it to the shop, where Veer discovers drugs and burns them. King sees them burning something and asks to fix his white car. King's men come to Meera's house one night, but Raj shows up as Kaali and stops them from causing her any harm. Later in front of the church, King asks Meera about Kaali which she refuses sparing Raj's life. Meera issues an ultimatum that in order to marry Ishita, Veer must move in with Meera. It is revealed to Veer by Meera that Raj was Randhir's adopted son and is not Veer's older brother. Raghav ([[Nawab Shah]]), Malik's right hand, tells Meera that Raj did not kill Malik, but that Randhir had shot Malik in return to his bullet. Upon learning this, Meera is distraught with regret and remorse and takes Ishita to Raj\u2019s house, declaring that Veer can take Ishita home after marriage.\n\nAt Sidhu and Jenny's wedding, King shows up and sees his car confirming it as his car which was stolen. King starts to cause a disturbance, bringing Mani, Oscar(the bride's brother) and then Veer out. A fight ensues with Veer holding his own well until one blow sends him falling back and rolling when he stops at Meera\u2019s deer as she walks outside, she calls for Kaali, and Raj comes out and takes out everyone in his path beating King up. King stand up as Raj walked away to check in Veer, then tries to shoot Raj, but Meera seeing this pushes Raj away stepping in front of him and is accidentally shot as she tried to save Raj. Later. King gets beaten by Raj\u2019s men as they rushed him after he shoots Meera. Meera survives and both Raj and Meera reunite in hospital.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Shah Rukh Khan]] as Raj \"Kaali\" Randhir Bakshi\n* [[Kajol]] as Meera \"Pogo\" Dev Malik \n* [[Varun Dhawan]] as Veeresh \"Veer\" Bakshi\n* [[Kriti Sanon]] as Ishita \"Ishu\" Malik\n* [[Boman Irani]] as King\n* [[Johnny Lever]] as Mani\n* [[Sanjay Mishra (actor)|Sanjay Mishra]] as Oscar Verma\n* [[Varun Sharma]] as Siddharth \"Sidhu\" Segal\n* [[Chetna Pande]] as Jenny Verma\n* [[Mukesh Tiwari]] as Shakti Segal\n* [[Pankaj Tripathi]] as Anwar Ansari\n* [[Vinod Khanna]] as Randhir Bakshi\n* [[Kabir Bedi]] as Dev Malik\n* [[Nawab Shah (actor)|Nawab Shah]] as Raghav\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nIn January 2015, Rohit Shetty announced a project with [[Shah Rukh Khan]] in the lead which would be their second collaboration after the 2013 film ''[[Chennai Express]]''.
