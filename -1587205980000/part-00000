One might expect that, as with electromagnetism, the gravitational force should also have a corresponding [[quantum field theory]].\n\nHowever, gravity is perturbatively [[nonrenormalizable]].<ref name=\"FLoG\"/>{{rp|xxxvi&ndash;xxxviii;211&ndash;212}}<ref>{{ cite book | last= Hamber | first= H.

The theory must be characterized by a choice of ''finitely many'' parameters, which could, in principle, be set by experiment. For example, in [[quantum electrodynamics]] these parameters are the charge and mass of the electron, as measured at a particular energy scale.\n\nOn the other hand, in quantizing gravity there are, in perturbation theory, ''infinitely many independent parameters'' (counterterm coefficients) needed to define the theory. For a given choice of those parameters, one could make sense of the theory, but since it is impossible to conduct infinite experiments to fix the values of every parameter, it has been argued that one does not, in perturbation theory, have a meaningful physical theory. At low energies, the logic of the [[renormalization group]] tells us that, despite the unknown choices of these infinitely many parameters, quantum gravity will reduce to the usual Einstein theory of general relativity. On the other hand, if we could probe very high energies where quantum effects take over, then ''every one'' of the infinitely many unknown parameters would begin to matter, and we could make no predictions at all.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIt is conceivable that, in the correct theory of quantum gravity, the infinitely many unknown parameters will reduce to a finite number that can then be measured. One possibility is that normal [[perturbation theory]] is not a reliable guide to the renormalizability of the theory, and that there really ''is'' a [[UV fixed point]] for gravity. Since this is a question of [[non-perturbative]] quantum field theory, it is difficult to find a reliable answer, but some people still pursue this option. Another possibility is that there are new, undiscovered symmetry principles that constrain the parameters and reduce them to a finite set. This is the route taken by [[string theory]], where all of the excitations of the string essentially manifest themselves as new symmetries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000639.html|title=Motivation|last=Distler|first=Jacques|authorlink=Jacques Distler|date=2005-09-01|website=golem.ph.utexas.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-02-24}}</ref>{{Better source|date=February 2019}}\n\n=== Quantum gravity as an effective field theory ===\n{{Main|Effective field theory}}\nIn an [[effective field theory]], all but the first few of the infinite set of parameters in a nonrenormalizable theory are suppressed by huge energy scales and hence can be neglected when computing low-energy effects.

In the case of quantum mechanics, it is time that is given and not dynamic, just as in Newtonian classical mechanics. In relativistic quantum field theory, just as in classical field theory, [[Minkowski spacetime]] is the fixed background of the theory.\n\n==== String theory ====\n[[File:Point&string.png|right|thumb|Interaction in the subatomic world: [[world line]]s of point-like [[Subatomic particle|particles]] in the [[Standard Model]] or a [[world sheet]] swept up by closed [[string (physics)|strings]] in string theory]]\n[[String theory]] can be seen as a generalization of [[quantum field theory]] where instead of point particles, string-like objects propagate in a fixed spacetime background, although the interactions among closed strings give rise to space-time in a dynamical way.\nAlthough string theory had its origins in the study of [[quark confinement]] and not of quantum gravity, it was soon discovered that the string spectrum contains the [[graviton]], and that \"condensation\" of certain vibration modes of strings is equivalent to a modification of the original background. In this sense, string perturbation theory exhibits exactly the features one would expect of a [[perturbation theory]] that may exhibit a strong dependence on asymptotics (as seen, for example, in the [[AdS/CFT]] correspondence) which is a weak form of [[Background independence|background dependence]].\n\n==== Background independent theories ====\n[[Loop quantum gravity]] is the fruit of an effort to formulate a [[background-independent]] quantum theory.\n\n[[Topological quantum field theory]] provided an example of background-independent quantum theory, but with no local degrees of freedom, and only finitely many degrees of freedom globally. This is inadequate to describe gravity in 3+1 dimensions, which has local degrees of freedom according to general relativity. In 2+1 dimensions, however, gravity is a topological field theory, and it has been successfully quantized in several different ways, including [[spin network]]s.\n\n=== Semi-classical quantum gravity ===\n[[Quantum field theory]] on curved (non-Minkowskian) backgrounds, while not a full quantum theory of gravity, has shown many promising early results. In an analogous way to the development of quantum electrodynamics in the early part of the 20th century (when physicists considered quantum mechanics in classical electromagnetic fields), the consideration of quantum field theory on a curved background has led to predictions such as black hole radiation.\n\nPhenomena such as the [[Unruh effect]], in which particles exist in certain accelerating frames but not in stationary ones, do not pose any difficulty when considered on a curved background (the Unruh effect occurs even in flat Minkowskian backgrounds). The vacuum state is the state with the least energy (and may or may not contain particles).\nSee [[Quantum field theory in curved spacetime]] for a more complete discussion.\n\n=== Problem of time ===\n{{Main|Problem of time}}\nA conceptual difficulty in combining quantum mechanics with general relativity arises from the contrasting role of time within these two frameworks.

Its second idea is that the quantum discreteness that determines the particle-like behavior of other field theories (for instance, the photons of the electromagnetic field) also affects the structure of space.\n\nThe main result of loop quantum gravity is the derivation of a granular structure of space at the Planck length.  This is derived from following considerations: In the case of electromagnetism, the quantum operator representing the energy of each frequency of the field has a discrete spectrum. Thus the energy of each frequency is quantized, and the quanta are the photons. In the case of gravity, the operators representing the area and the volume of each surface or space region likewise have discrete spectrum. Thus area and volume of any portion of space are also quantized, where the quanta are elementary quanta of space.  It follows, then, that spacetime has an elementary quantum granular structure at the Planck scale, which cuts off the ultraviolet infinities of quantum field theory.\n\nThe quantum state of spacetime is described in the theory by means of a mathematical structure called [[spin network]]s. Spin networks were initially introduced by [[Roger Penrose]] in abstract form, and later shown by [[Carlo Rovelli]] and [[Lee Smolin]] to derive naturally from a non-perturbative quantization of general relativity.  Spin networks do not represent quantum states of a field in spacetime: they represent directly quantum states of spacetime.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe theory is based on the reformulation of general relativity known as [[Ashtekar variables]], which represent geometric gravity using mathematical analogues of [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal\n|last=Ashtekar\n|first=Abhay\n|authorlink=Abhay Ashtekar\n|title=New variables for classical and quantum gravity\n|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]\n|volume=57\n|pages=2244\u20132247\n|date=1986\n|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.57.2244\n|pmid=10033673\n|issue=18\n|ref=harv\n|bibcode=1986PhRvL..57.2244A\n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal\n|last=Ashtekar\n|first=Abhay\n|authorlink=Abhay Ashtekar\n|title=New Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity\n|journal=[[Physical Review D]]\n|volume=36|issue=6|pages=1587\u20131602\n|date=1987\n|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.36.1587\n|pmid=9958340\n|ref=harv|bibcode = 1987PhRvD..36.1587A }}</ref>\nIn the quantum theory, space is represented by a network structure called a [[spin network]], evolving over time in discrete steps.<ref>{{Cite book\n|last=Thiemann\n|first=Thomas\n|title=Loop Quantum Gravity: An Inside View\n|journal=[[Approaches to Fundamental Physics]]\n|volume=721\n|pages=185\u2013263\n|year=2007\n|arxiv=hep-th/0608210\n|bibcode=2007LNP...721..185T\n|ref=harv\n|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-71117-9_10\n|series=Lecture Notes in Physics\n|isbn=978-3-540-71115-5\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n|last=Rovelli\n|first=Carlo\n|authorlink=Carlo Rovelli\n|title=Loop Quantum Gravity\n|journal=[[Living Reviews in Relativity]]\n|volume=1\n|date=1998\n|url=http://www.livingreviews.org/lrr-1998-1\n|accessdate=2008-03-13\n|ref=harv\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n | last=Ashtekar\n | first=Abhay\n | authorlink=Abhay Ashtekar\n | first2=Jerzy\n | last2=Lewandowski\n | title=Background Independent Quantum Gravity: A Status Report\n | journal=[[Classical and Quantum Gravity]]\n | volume=21\n | date=2004\n | issue=15\n | pages=R53\u2013R152\n | arxiv=gr-qc/0404018\n | doi=10.1088/0264-9381/21/15/R01\n |bibcode = 2004CQGra..21R..53A }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book\n|last=Thiemann\n|first=Thomas\n|chapter=Lectures on Loop Quantum Gravity\n|date=2003\n|volume=631\n|pages=41\u2013135\n|ref=harv\n|arxiv=gr-qc/0210094\n|bibcode=2003LNP...631...41T\n|doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-45230-0_3 |series=Lecture Notes in Physics\n|isbn=978-3-540-40810-9\n|title=Quantum Gravity\n}}</ref>\n\nThe dynamics of the theory is today constructed in several versions.

The theory must be characterized by a choice of ''finitely many'' parameters, which could, in principle, be set by experiment. For example, in [[quantum electrodynamics]] these parameters are the charge and mass of the electron, as measured at a particular energy scale.\n\nOn the other hand, in quantizing gravity there are, in perturbation theory, ''infinitely many independent parameters'' (counterterm coefficients) needed to define the theory. For a given choice of those parameters, one could make sense of the theory, but since it is impossible to conduct infinite experiments to fix the values of every parameter, it has been argued that one does not, in perturbation theory, have a meaningful physical theory. At low energies, the logic of the [[renormalization group]] tells us that, despite the unknown choices of these infinitely many parameters, quantum gravity will reduce to the usual Einstein theory of general relativity. On the other hand, if we could probe very high energies where quantum effects take over, then ''every one'' of the infinitely many unknown parameters would begin to matter, and we could make no predictions at all.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIt is conceivable that, in the correct theory of quantum gravity, the infinitely many unknown parameters will reduce to a finite number that can then be measured. One possibility is that normal [[perturbation theory]] is not a reliable guide to the renormalizability of the theory, and that there really ''is'' a [[UV fixed point]] for gravity. Since this is a question of [[non-perturbative]] quantum field theory, it is difficult to find a reliable answer, but some people still pursue this option. Another possibility is that there are new, undiscovered symmetry principles that constrain the parameters and reduce them to a finite set. This is the route taken by [[string theory]], where all of the excitations of the string essentially manifest themselves as new symmetries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000639.html|title=Motivation|last=Distler|first=Jacques|authorlink=Jacques Distler|date=2005-09-01|website=golem.ph.utexas.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-02-24}}</ref>{{Better source|date=February 2019}}\n\n=== Quantum gravity as an effective field theory ===\n{{Main|Effective field theory}}\nIn an [[effective field theory]], all but the first few of the infinite set of parameters in a nonrenormalizable theory are suppressed by huge energy scales and hence can be neglected when computing low-energy effects.

In the case of quantum mechanics, it is time that is given and not dynamic, just as in Newtonian classical mechanics. In relativistic quantum field theory, just as in classical field theory, [[Minkowski spacetime]] is the fixed background of the theory.\n\n==== String theory ====\n[[File:Point&string.png|right|thumb|Interaction in the subatomic world: [[world line]]s of point-like [[Subatomic particle|particles]] in the [[Standard Model]] or a [[world sheet]] swept up by closed [[string (physics)|strings]] in string theory]]\n[[String theory]] can be seen as a generalization of [[quantum field theory]] where instead of point particles, string-like objects propagate in a fixed spacetime background, although the interactions among closed strings give rise to space-time in a dynamical way.\nAlthough string theory had its origins in the study of [[quark confinement]] and not of quantum gravity, it was soon discovered that the string spectrum contains the [[graviton]], and that \"condensation\" of certain vibration modes of strings is equivalent to a modification of the original background. In this sense, string perturbation theory exhibits exactly the features one would expect of a [[perturbation theory]] that may exhibit a strong dependence on asymptotics (as seen, for example, in the [[AdS/CFT]] correspondence) which is a weak form of [[Background independence|background dependence]].\n\n==== Background independent theories ====\n[[Loop quantum gravity]] is the fruit of an effort to formulate a [[background-independent]] quantum theory.\n\n[[Topological quantum field theory]] provided an example of background-independent quantum theory, but with no local degrees of freedom, and only finitely many degrees of freedom globally. This is inadequate to describe gravity in 3+1 dimensions, which has local degrees of freedom according to general relativity. In 2+1 dimensions, however, gravity is a topological field theory, and it has been successfully quantized in several different ways, including [[spin network]]s.\n\n=== Semi-classical quantum gravity ===\n[[Quantum field theory]] on curved (non-Minkowskian) backgrounds, while not a full quantum theory of gravity, has shown many promising early results. In an analogous way to the development of quantum electrodynamics in the early part of the 20th century (when physicists considered quantum mechanics in classical electromagnetic fields), the consideration of quantum field theory on a curved background has led to predictions such as black hole radiation.\n\nPhenomena such as the [[Unruh effect]], in which particles exist in certain accelerating frames but not in stationary ones, do not pose any difficulty when considered on a curved background (the Unruh effect occurs even in flat Minkowskian backgrounds). The vacuum state is the state with the least energy (and may or may not contain particles).\nSee [[Quantum field theory in curved spacetime]] for a more complete discussion.\n\n=== Problem of time ===\n{{Main|Problem of time}}\nA conceptual difficulty in combining quantum mechanics with general relativity arises from the contrasting role of time within these two frameworks.

Its second idea is that the quantum discreteness that determines the particle-like behavior of other field theories (for instance, the photons of the electromagnetic field) also affects the structure of space.\n\nThe main result of loop quantum gravity is the derivation of a granular structure of space at the Planck length.  This is derived from following considerations: In the case of electromagnetism, the quantum operator representing the energy of each frequency of the field has a discrete spectrum. Thus the energy of each frequency is quantized, and the quanta are the photons. In the case of gravity, the operators representing the area and the volume of each surface or space region likewise have discrete spectrum. Thus area and volume of any portion of space are also quantized, where the quanta are elementary quanta of space.  It follows, then, that spacetime has an elementary quantum granular structure at the Planck scale, which cuts off the ultraviolet infinities of quantum field theory.\n\nThe quantum state of spacetime is described in the theory by means of a mathematical structure called [[spin network]]s. Spin networks were initially introduced by [[Roger Penrose]] in abstract form, and later shown by [[Carlo Rovelli]] and [[Lee Smolin]] to derive naturally from a non-perturbative quantization of general relativity.

In particular and most importantly, it is not known how quantum spin sources gravity and what is the correct characterization of the spacetime of a single spin-half particle.\nTo analyze this question, thought experiments in the context of quantum information, have been suggested.<ref name=\"Spin Spacetime Censorship\"/>\nThis work shows that, in order to avoid violation of relativistic causality, the measurable spacetime around a spin-half particle's (rest frame) must be spherically symmetric - i.e., either spacetime is spherically symmetric, or somehow measurements of the spacetime (e.g., time-dilation measurements) should create some sort of back action that affects and changes the quantum spin.\n\n== See also ==\n{{cols|colwidth=13em}}\n* [[Abraham\u2013Lorentz force]]\n* [[Black hole thermodynamics#Beyond black holes|Beyond black holes]]\n* [[Black hole electron]]\n* [[Centauro event]]\n* [[De Sitter relativity]]\n* [[Doubly special relativity]]\n* [[Event symmetry]]\n* [[Fock\u2013Lorentz symmetry]]\n* [[Gravitomagnetism]]\n* [[Hawking radiation]]\n* [[List of quantum gravity researchers]]\n* [[Macrocosm and microcosm]]\n* [[Orders of magnitude (length)]]\n* [[Penrose interpretation]]\n* [[Planck epoch]]\n* [[Planck units]]\n* [[Quantum realm]]\n* [[Swampland (physics)]]\n* [[Weak Gravity Conjecture]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=n.b.}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{Cite journal\n|last=Ahluwalia\n|first=D.

Traditionally it has short sleeves and a round neckline, known as a ''[[crew neck]]'', which lacks a collar.  T-shirts are generally made of a stretchy, light and inexpensive fabric and are easy to clean.\n\nTypically made of cotton textile in a [[Jersey (fabric)|stockinette or jersey knit]], it has a distinctively pliable texture compared to shirts made of woven cloth. Some modern versions have a body made from a continuously knitted tube, produced on a [[knitting machine|circular knitting machine]], such that the torso has no side seams. The manufacture of T-shirts has become highly automated and may include cutting fabric with a [[Laser cutting|laser]] or a [[Water jet cutter|water jet]].\n\nThe T-shirt evolved from [[undergarment]]s used in the 19th century and, in the mid-20th century, transitioned from undergarment to general-use casual clothing. The first t-shirt was designed and created by student named Jake Edwards. \n\nA V-neck T-shirt has a V-shaped [[neckline]], as opposed to the round neckline of the more common crew neck shirt (also called a U-neck). V-necks were introduced so that the neckline of the shirt does not show when worn beneath an outer shirt, as would that of a crew neck shirt.<ref name=\"mw\">{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/crew+neck |title=Crew neck |dictionary=Merriam-Webster Online |accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZTEaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-CUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7240,1997423&dq=crew-neck+sweater+college&hl=en |title=Sweaters Go Bulky |date=25 August 1957 |work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |page=2|accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"kirby\">{{cite web |url=http://www.90thidpg.us/Equipment/Articles/Tshirts/index.html |title=90th IDPG History of the T-shirt During WW2 |last=Kirby |first=Michael B.|date=Spring 2008 |publisher=90th Infantry Division Preservation Group |accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ww2-oiler-Arnold-R-Fesser.jpg|thumb|upright|[[United States Merchant Marine|US Merchant Marine]] sailor in 1944]]\nThe T-shirt evolved from [[undergarment]]s used in the 19th century. First, the one-piece ''[[union suit]]'' underwear was cut into separate top and bottom garments, with the top long enough to tuck under the waistband of the bottoms. With and without buttons, they were adopted by [[miners]] and [[stevedores]] during the late 19th century as a convenient covering for hot environments.\n\nAs slip-on garments without buttons, the earliest T-shirt dates back to sometime between the 1898 [[Spanish\u2013American War]] and 1913, when the U.S. Navy first issued them as undergarments.<ref name=\"tshirtspotlight.com\">{{cite web|url=http://tshirtspotlight.com/history-of-the-t-Shirt/|title=History of the T-shirt.|work=Tee Fetch}}</ref> These were a crew-necked, short-sleeved, white cotton undershirt to be worn under a [[uniform]]. It became common for sailors and Marines in work parties, the early submarines, and tropical climates to remove their uniform jacket, wearing (and soiling) only the undershirt.<ref name=Harris>Harris, Alice. ''The White T''. HarperCollins, 1996.</ref>\nThey soon became popular as a bottom layer of clothing for workers in various industries, including agriculture. The T-shirt was easily fitted, easily cleaned, and inexpensive, and for those reasons, it became the shirt of choice for young boys. Boys' shirts were made in various colors and patterns. The word ''T-shirt'' became part of American English by the 1920s, and appeared in the ''Merriam-Webster Dictionary''.<ref name=\"tshirtspotlight.com\" />\n\nBy the [[Great Depression]], the T-shirt was often the default garment to be worn when doing farm or ranch chores, as well as other times when modesty called for a torso covering but conditions called for lightweight fabrics.<ref name=Harris /> Following [[World War II]], it was worn by Navy men as undergarments and slowly became common to see veterans wearing their uniform trousers with their T-shirts as casual clothing.<ref name=\"Vogue\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.vogue.com/article/best-classic-white-t-shirts-of-all-time|title=From Marlon Brando to Kendall Jenner, 27 of the Best Classic White T-Shirts Ever|work=Vogue|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en}}</ref> [http://www.vogue.com/article/best-classic-white-t-shirts-of-all-time] The shirts became even more popular in the 1950s after [[Marlon Brando]] wore one in ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', finally achieving status as fashionable, stand-alone, outerwear garments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/stre.html |title=A Streetcar Named Desire \u2013 AMC filmsite |publisher=Filmsite.org |date=1947-12-03 |accessdate=2010-10-26}}</ref> Often boys wore them while doing chores and playing outside, eventually opening up the idea of wearing them as general-purpose casual clothing.\n\nPrinted T-shirts were in limited use by 1942 when an Air Corps Gunnery School T-shirt appeared on the cover of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine.  In the 1960s, printed T-shirts gained popularity for self-expression as well for advertisements, protests, and souvenirs.\n\nCurrent versions are available in many different designs and fabrics, and styles include crew-neck and V-neck shirts. T-shirts are among the most worn garments of clothing used today. T-shirts are especially popular with branding for companies or merchandise, as they are inexpensive to make and purchase.\n\n==Trends==\n\nT-shirts were originally worn as undershirts, but are now worn frequently as the only piece of [[clothing]] on the top half of the body, other than possibly a [[brassiere]] or, rarely, a waistcoat ([[vest]]). T-shirts have also become a medium for self-expression and advertising, with any imaginable combination of words, art and photographs on display.<ref name=\"Neeli Cherkovski 1993\">[[Sally Larsen]] with Neeli Cherkovski, ''Japlish'', Pomegranate Art Books, San Francisco, 1993, {{ISBN|1-56640-454-1}}</ref>\n\nA T-shirt typically extends to the waist. Variants of the T-shirt, such as the V-neck, have been developed. [[Hip hop fashion]] calls for ''tall-T'' shirts which may extend down to the knees. A similar item is the T-shirt dress or T-dress, a [[dress|dress-length]] T-shirt that can be worn without pants.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Cumming, Valerie |author2=C. W. Cunnington |author3=P. E. Cunnington  |last-author-amp=yes |title=The Dictionary of Fashion History|year=2010|publisher=Berg Publishers|isbn=978-1-84788-534-0|page=211}}</ref>  Long T-shirts are also sometimes worn by women as nightgowns.  A 1990s trend in women's clothing involved tight-fitting ''[[crop top|cropped]]'' T-shirt or crop tops short enough to reveal the [[midriff]]. Another less popular trend is wearing a short-sleeved T-shirt of a contrasting color over a long-sleeved T-shirt, which is known as ''layering''. T-shirts that are tight to the body are called ''fitted'', ''tailored'' or ''baby doll'' T-shirts.\n\nThe rise of online shopping in the early 2000s caused a proliferation of new T-shirt ideas and trends. While several brick-and-mortar chains included these items in their inventories, many of these shirts were pioneered by online start-ups. Innovations included the flip-up T-shirt, which the wearer can lift and stretch over their head to display an interior print, and all-over print clothing.<ref>{{cite web |title=3d t shirt |url=https://www.kykuclothing.com/collections/3d-t-shirt |website=KYKU |accessdate=28 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nWith the rise of social media and video sharing sites also came numerous tutorials on DIY T-shirt projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/peggy/30-diy-ways-to-get-your-t-shirts-ready-for-summer|title=31 T-Shirt DIYs That Are Perfect For Summer|website=Buzzfeed.com|accessdate=1 July 2016}}</ref> These videos typically provided instructions on how to modify an old shirt into a new, more fashionable form.\n\n\n===Expressive messages===\nSince the 1960s, T-shirts have flourished as a form of personal [[Emotional expression|expression]].<ref name=\"Neeli Cherkovski 1993\" /> [[Screen printed]] T-shirts have been a standard form of [[marketing]] for major American consumer products, such as [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Mickey Mouse]], since the 1970s. It has also been commonly used to commemorate an event or to make a political or personal statement. Since the 1990s, it has become common practice for companies of all sizes to produce T-shirts with their corporate logos or messages as part of their overall [[advertising]] campaigns. Since the late 1980s and especially the 1990s, T-shirts with prominent designer-name logos have become popular, especially with teenagers and young adults. These garments allow consumers to flaunt their taste for designer brands in an inexpensive way, in addition to being decorative. Examples of designer T-shirt branding include [[Calvin Klein]], [[FUBU]], [[Ralph Lauren]], [[American Apparel]], and [[The Gap (clothing retailer)|The Gap]]. <!-- Hi! Don't add a link to your T-shirt shop here either. --> These examples also include representations of rock bands, among other obscure pop-culture references. Licensed T-shirts are also extremely popular. Movie and TV T-shirts can have images of the actors, logos, and funny quotations from the movie or TV show. Often, the most popular T-shirts are those that characters wore in the film itself (e.g., Bubba Gump from ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' and Vote For Pedro from ''[[Napoleon Dynamite]]'').\n\nDesigner [[Katharine Hamnett]], in the early 1980s, pioneered outsize T-shirts with large-print slogans. The early first decade of the 21st century saw the renewed popularity of T-shirts with slogans and designs with a strong inclination to the humorous and/or [//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/54/Ironymens_01.jpg ironic]. The trend has only increased later in this decade, embraced by celebrities, such as [[Britney Spears]] and [[Paris Hilton]], and reflected back on them, too ('Team Aniston'). The political and social statements that T-shirts often display have become, since the first decade of the 21st century, one of the reasons that they have so deeply permeated different levels of culture and society. The statements also may be found to be offensive, shocking, or pornographic to some. Examples of T-shirt stores and designers known for using offensive and shocking messages include [[T-Shirt Hell]] and [[Apollo Braun]]. Many different organizations have caught on to the statement-making trend, including chain and independent stores, websites, and schools.\n\nA popular phrase on the front of demonstrating the popularity of T-shirts among tourists is the humorous phrase \"I went to _____ and all I got was this lousy T-shirt.\"  Examples include \"My parents went to Las Vegas and all I got was this lousy T-shirt.\"\nT-shirt exchange is an activity where people trade the T-shirts that they are wearing.\n\nArtists like [[Bill Beckley]], Glen Baldridge and [[Peter Klashorst]] use T-shirts in their work. Models such as [[Victoria Beckham]] and [[Gisele Bundchen]] wore T-shirts through the 2000s. Paris Fashion Week 2014 featured a grunge style T-shirt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/street-style/paris-street-style-spring-2014-2036|title=Street style: Paris fashion week 2014|last=Pieri|first=Kerry|date=2013-10-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530001424/http://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/street-style/paris-street-style-spring-2014-2036|archive-date=2014-05-30|accessdate=2018-03-13}}</ref> Contemporary T-shirt designers like [[Balmain (fashion house)|Balmain]] and Street People Atelier produce new styles of T-shirts.\n\n==Decoration==\n[[File:Ringer t-shirt.png|frame|right|Ringer T-shirt]]\nIn the early 1950s, several companies based in [[Miami, Florida]], started to decorate T-shirts with different resort names and various characters. The first company was Tropix Togs, under founder Sam Kantor, in Miami. They were the original licensee for Walt Disney characters in 1976 including Mickey Mouse and Davy Crockett. Later, other companies expanded into the [[Textile printing|T-shirt printing]] business, including Sherry Manufacturing Company, also based in Miami. Sherry was founded in 1948 by its owner and founder Quentin H. Sandler as a screen printer of Souvenir Scarf's to the souvenir resort market.  Shortly, the company evolved into one of the largest screen printed resort and licensed apparel companies in the [[United States]].  The company now (2018) runs automatic Screen Print presses and produces up to 10,000 to 20,000 T-shirts each day.\n\nIn the 1960s, the [[ringer T-shirt]] appeared and became a staple fashion for youth and rock-n-rollers. The decade also saw the emergence of [[tie-dye]]ing and [[screen-printing]] on the basic T-shirt and the T-shirt became a medium for wearable art, commercial [[advertising]], [[souvenir]] messages, and [[protest art]] messages.  Psychedelic art poster designer [[Warren Dayton]] pioneered several political, protest, and pop-culture art printed large and in color on T-shirts featuring images of Cesar Chavez, political cartoons, and other cultural icons in an article in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' magazine in late 1969 (ironically, the clothing company quickly cancelled the experimental line, fearing there would not be a market). In the late 1960s, Richard Ellman, Robert Tree, Bill Kelly, and [[Stanley Mouse]] set up the Monster Company in Mill Valley, California, to produce fine art designs expressly for T-shirts. Monster T-shirts often feature emblems and motifs associated with the [[Grateful Dead]] and [[marijuana]] culture.<ref>''Monster T-shirt ART'', Monster Corporation catalog #3, Mill Valley 1974</ref> Additionally, one of the most popular symbols to emerge from the political turmoil of the 1960s were T-shirts bearing the face of [[Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara]].<ref>[http://www.sojones.com/news/1465-the-most-famous-statement-T-shirts/ The Most Famous Statement T-shirts] by SoJones Asmara, September 10, 2009</ref>\n\nToday, many notable and memorable T-shirts produced in the 1970s have become ensconced in pop culture. Examples include the bright yellow [[Harvey Ball|happy face]] T-shirts, [[The Rolling Stones]] tops with their \"tongue and lips\"<ref>File:The Rolling Stones Tongue Logo.png</ref> logo, and [[Milton Glaser]]'s iconic \"[[I Love New York|I \u2665 N Y]]\u201d design. In the mid-1980s, the white T-shirt became fashionable after the actor [[Don Johnson]] wore it with an Armani suit in ''[[Miami Vice]]''.<ref name=Harris />\n\n===Screen printing===\nThe most common form of commercial T-shirt decoration is [[screen printing]]. In screen printing, a design is separated into individual colors. [[Plastisol]] or water based [[ink]]s are applied to the shirt through mesh screens which limits the areas where ink is deposited. In most commercial T-shirt printing, the specific colors in the design are used. To achieve a wider color spectrum with a limited number of colors, process printing (using only [[CMYK|cyan, magenta, yellow and black]] ink) or simulated process (using only white, black, red, green, blue, and gold ink) is effective. Process printing is best suited for light colored shirts.<ref>{{cite web|title=CMYK Printing|url=http://www.impressionzprinting.com/services/color-printing/|publisher=ImpressionzPrinting.com|author=Steve Rhodes|quote=CMYK is a widely used technique to replicate full-color images on light colored backgrounds.  The full-color process originated to accurately reproduce artwork on white paper.}}</ref> The simulated process is best suited for dark colored shirts.\n\nIn 1959, the invention of [[plastisol]] provided an ink more durable and stretchable than water-based ink, allowing much more variety in T-shirt designs. Very few companies continue to use water-based inks on their shirts. The majority of companies that create shirts prefer plastisol due to the ability to print on varying colors without the need for color adjustment at the art level.\n\nSpecialty inks trend in and out of fashion and include [[Screen printing#Screen printing materials|shimmer]], [[Screen printing#Screen printing materials|puff]], [[Screen printing#Screen printing materials|discharge]], and chino based<ref>{{cite web|title=Subject: Re: chino ink??|url=http://forums.screenprinters.net/viewthread/2/405410|publisher=ScreenPrinters.Net|accessdate=13 January 2018|first=Lance|last=Huston|quote=Chino is a special Rutland INK BASE mixing system.\u2026 While on the surface it looks similar to a reduced base, it does have a unique print quality to it that offers a waterbase feel, without the hassles of waterbase inks.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923025320/http://forums.screenprinters.net/viewthread/2/405410|archivedate=23 September 2013}}</ref> inks. A metallic foil can be heat pressed and stamped onto any plastisol ink. When combined with shimmer ink, metallics give a mirror like effect wherever the previously screened plastisol ink was applied. Specialty inks are more expensive to purchase as well as screen and tend to appear on garments in boutiques.\n\nOther methods of decoration used on T-shirts include [[airbrush]], [[applique]], [[embroidery]], impressing or embossing, and the [[ironing]] on of either [[Flocking (texture)|flock]] lettering, [[Iron-on#Iron-on transfers|heat transfers]], or [[dye-sublimation]] transfers. [[Laser printer]]s are capable of printing on plain paper using a special [[toner]] containing sublimation dyes which can then be permanently heat-transferred to T-shirts.\n\nIn the 1980s, [[thermochromatic]] dyes were used to produce T-shirts that changed color when subjected to heat. The [[Hypercolor|Global Hypercolour]] brand of these was a common sight on the streets of the [[United Kingdom|UK]] for a few years but has since mostly disappeared. These were also very popular in the [[United States]] among teenagers in the late 1980s. A downside of color-change garments is that the dyes can easily be damaged, especially by [[laundry|washing]] in warm water or dye other clothes during washing.\n\n===Tie dye===\n[[File:TieDyeShirtMpegMan.jpg|thumb|An example of a [[tie-dye]]d T-shirt]]\nTie dye originated in India, Japan, Jamaica, and Africa as early as the sixth century.<ref name=\"iml.jou.ufl.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring09/blake_e/history.html|title=Peace, Love and Tie-Dye|website=Iml.jou.ufl.edu|accessdate=31 October 2017}}</ref> Some forms of tie dye are [[Bandhani]] (the oldest known technique) used in Indian cultures, and [[Shibori]] primarily used in Japanese cultures. It was not until the 1960s that tie dye was introduced to America during the [[hippie movement]].<ref name=\"iml.jou.ufl.edu\" />\n\n===Heat transfer vinyl (HTV)===\nAnother form of T-shirt decoration is heat transfer vinyl, also called HTV.  HTV is a polyurethane material that allows apparel designers to create unique layered designs using a specialized software program.  \nOnce the design is created, it is then cut through the material using a vinyl cutter (or Cut n Press) machine.\n\nThere are dozens of different colors available, as well as glitter, reflective, and now even unique patterns (such as mermaid skin) which come in rolls and sheets.\n\nAfter the design is cut, there is a process called \u201cweeding\u201d whereby the areas of the design that do not represent the design are picked away from the transfer sheet and removed so that the intended design remains. \nHTV is typically smooth to the touch and does not feel rubbery or stiff.  \n\nThe edges are typically clean cut and produce high contrast.\n\nDesigners can also create multiple color designs, or multi-layered designs using HTV. This process would be done in the design software before the design is sent to the cutter for the different materials\nA heat press is then used to apply pressure and heat to the vinyl so that the material permanently adheres to the garment.   The temperature and pressure vary according to the manufacturers specifications.\n\n=== Dye-sublimation printing ===\nDye-sublimation printing is a direct-to-garment digital printing technology using full color artwork to transfer images to polyester and polymer-coated substrate based T-shirts. Dye-sublimation (also commonly referred to as all-over printing) came into widespread use in the 21st century, enabling some designs previously impossible. Printing with unlimited colors using large CMYK printers with special paper and ink is possible, unlike screen printing which requires screens for each color of the design. All-over print T-shirts have solved the problem with color fading and the vibrancy is higher than most standard printing methods but requires synthetic fabrics for the ink to take hold. The key feature of dye-sublimated clothing is that the design is not printed on top of the garment, but permanently dyed into the threads of the shirt, ensuring that it will never fade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thatshirtwascash.com/pages/about-us|title=About Us and FAQs (read dis) \u2013 Shirtwascash|website=Shirtwascash|accessdate=2015-11-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029055207/http://thatshirtwascash.com/pages/about-us|archive-date=2015-10-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDye-sublimation is economically viable for small-quantity printing; the unit cost is similar for short or long production runs.

Traditionally it has short sleeves and a round neckline, known as a ''[[crew neck]]'', which lacks a collar.  T-shirts are generally made of a stretchy, light and inexpensive fabric and are easy to clean.\n\nTypically made of cotton textile in a [[Jersey (fabric)|stockinette or jersey knit]], it has a distinctively pliable texture compared to shirts made of woven cloth. Some modern versions have a body made from a continuously knitted tube, produced on a [[knitting machine|circular knitting machine]], such that the torso has no side seams. The manufacture of T-shirts has become highly automated and may include cutting fabric with a [[Laser cutting|laser]] or a [[Water jet cutter|water jet]].\n\nThe T-shirt evolved from [[undergarment]]s used in the 19th century and, in the mid-20th century, transitioned from undergarment to general-use casual clothing.\n\nA V-neck T-shirt has a V-shaped [[neckline]], as opposed to the round neckline of the more common crew neck shirt (also called a U-neck). V-necks were introduced so that the neckline of the shirt does not show when worn beneath an outer shirt, as would that of a crew neck shirt.<ref name=\"mw\">{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/crew+neck |title=Crew neck |dictionary=Merriam-Webster Online |accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZTEaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-CUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7240,1997423&dq=crew-neck+sweater+college&hl=en |title=Sweaters Go Bulky |date=25 August 1957 |work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |page=2|accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"kirby\">{{cite web |url=http://www.90thidpg.us/Equipment/Articles/Tshirts/index.html |title=90th IDPG History of the T-shirt During WW2 |last=Kirby |first=Michael B.|date=Spring 2008 |publisher=90th Infantry Division Preservation Group |accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ww2-oiler-Arnold-R-Fesser.jpg|thumb|upright|[[United States Merchant Marine|US Merchant Marine]] sailor in 1944]]\nThe T-shirt evolved from [[undergarment]]s used in the 19th century. First, the one-piece ''[[union suit]]'' underwear was cut into separate top and bottom garments, with the top long enough to tuck under the waistband of the bottoms. With and without buttons, they were adopted by [[miners]] and [[stevedores]] during the late 19th century as a convenient covering for hot environments.\n\nAs slip-on garments without buttons, the earliest T-shirt dates back to sometime between the 1898 [[Spanish\u2013American War]] and 1913, when the U.S. Navy first issued them as undergarments.<ref name=\"tshirtspotlight.com\">{{cite web|url=http://tshirtspotlight.com/history-of-the-t-Shirt/|title=History of the T-shirt.|work=Tee Fetch}}</ref> These were a crew-necked, short-sleeved, white cotton undershirt to be worn under a [[uniform]].

''The White T''. HarperCollins, 1996.</ref>\nThey soon became popular as a bottom layer of clothing for workers in various industries, including agriculture. The T-shirt was easily fitted, easily cleaned, and inexpensive, and for those reasons, it became the shirt of choice for young boys. Boys' shirts were made in various colors and patterns. The word ''T-shirt'' became part of American English by the 1920s, and appeared in the ''Merriam-Webster Dictionary''.<ref name=\"tshirtspotlight.com\" />\n\nBy the [[Great Depression]], the T-shirt was often the default garment to be worn when doing farm or ranch chores, as well as other times when modesty called for a torso covering but conditions called for lightweight fabrics.<ref name=Harris /> Following [[World War II]], it was worn by Navy men as undergarments and slowly became common to see veterans wearing their uniform trousers with their T-shirts as casual clothing.<ref name=\"Vogue\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.vogue.com/article/best-classic-white-t-shirts-of-all-time|title=From Marlon Brando to Kendall Jenner, 27 of the Best Classic White T-Shirts Ever|work=Vogue|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en}}</ref> [http://www.vogue.com/article/best-classic-white-t-shirts-of-all-time] The shirts became even more popular in the 1950s after [[Marlon Brando]] wore one in ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', finally achieving status as fashionable, stand-alone, outerwear garments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/stre.html |title=A Streetcar Named Desire \u2013 AMC filmsite |publisher=Filmsite.org |date=1947-12-03 |accessdate=2010-10-26}}</ref> Often boys wore them while doing chores and playing outside, eventually opening up the idea of wearing them as general-purpose casual clothing.\n\nPrinted T-shirts were in limited use by 1942 when an Air Corps Gunnery School T-shirt appeared on the cover of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine.  In the 1960s, printed T-shirts gained popularity for self-expression as well for advertisements, protests, and souvenirs.\n\nCurrent versions are available in many different designs and fabrics, and styles include crew-neck and V-neck shirts. T-shirts are among the most worn garments of clothing used today. T-shirts are especially popular with branding for companies or merchandise, as they are inexpensive to make and purchase.\n\n==Trends==\n\nT-shirts were originally worn as undershirts, but are now worn frequently as the only piece of [[clothing]] on the top half of the body, other than possibly a [[brassiere]] or, rarely, a waistcoat ([[vest]]). T-shirts have also become a medium for self-expression and advertising, with any imaginable combination of words, art and photographs on display.<ref name=\"Neeli Cherkovski 1993\">[[Sally Larsen]] with Neeli Cherkovski, ''Japlish'', Pomegranate Art Books, San Francisco, 1993, {{ISBN|1-56640-454-1}}</ref>\n\nA T-shirt typically extends to the waist. Variants of the T-shirt, such as the V-neck, have been developed. [[Hip hop fashion]] calls for ''tall-T'' shirts which may extend down to the knees. A similar item is the T-shirt dress or T-dress, a [[dress|dress-length]] T-shirt that can be worn without pants.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Cumming, Valerie |author2=C. W. Cunnington |author3=P. E.

A 1990s trend in women's clothing involved tight-fitting ''[[crop top|cropped]]'' T-shirt or crop tops short enough to reveal the [[midriff]]. Another less popular trend is wearing a short-sleeved T-shirt of a contrasting color over a long-sleeved T-shirt, which is known as ''layering''. T-shirts that are tight to the body are called ''fitted'', ''tailored'' or ''baby doll'' T-shirts.\n\nThe rise of online shopping in the early 2000s caused a proliferation of new T-shirt ideas and trends. While several brick-and-mortar chains included these items in their inventories, many of these shirts were pioneered by online start-ups. Innovations included the flip-up T-shirt, which the wearer can lift and stretch over their head to display an interior print, and all-over print clothing.<ref>{{cite web |title=3d t shirt |url=https://www.kykuclothing.com/collections/3d-t-shirt |website=KYKU |accessdate=28 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nWith the rise of social media and video sharing sites also came numerous tutorials on DIY T-shirt projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/peggy/30-diy-ways-to-get-your-t-shirts-ready-for-summer|title=31 T-Shirt DIYs That Are Perfect For Summer|website=Buzzfeed.com|accessdate=1 July 2016}}</ref> These videos typically provided instructions on how to modify an old shirt into a new, more fashionable form.\n\n\n===Expressive messages===\nSince the 1960s, T-shirts have flourished as a form of personal [[Emotional expression|expression]].<ref name=\"Neeli Cherkovski 1993\" /> [[Screen printed]] T-shirts have been a standard form of [[marketing]] for major American consumer products, such as [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Mickey Mouse]], since the 1970s. It has also been commonly used to commemorate an event or to make a political or personal statement. Since the 1990s, it has become common practice for companies of all sizes to produce T-shirts with their corporate logos or messages as part of their overall [[advertising]] campaigns. Since the late 1980s and especially the 1990s, T-shirts with prominent designer-name logos have become popular, especially with teenagers and young adults. These garments allow consumers to flaunt their taste for designer brands in an inexpensive way, in addition to being decorative. Examples of designer T-shirt branding include [[Calvin Klein]], [[FUBU]], [[Ralph Lauren]], [[American Apparel]], and [[The Gap (clothing retailer)|The Gap]]. <!-- Hi! Don't add a link to your T-shirt shop here either. --> These examples also include representations of rock bands, among other obscure pop-culture references. Licensed T-shirts are also extremely popular. Movie and TV T-shirts can have images of the actors, logos, and funny quotations from the movie or TV show. Often, the most popular T-shirts are those that characters wore in the film itself (e.g., Bubba Gump from ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' and Vote For Pedro from ''[[Napoleon Dynamite]]'').\n\nDesigner [[Katharine Hamnett]], in the early 1980s, pioneered outsize T-shirts with large-print slogans. The early first decade of the 21st century saw the renewed popularity of T-shirts with slogans and designs with a strong inclination to the humorous and/or [//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/54/Ironymens_01.jpg ironic]. The trend has only increased later in this decade, embraced by celebrities, such as [[Britney Spears]] and [[Paris Hilton]], and reflected back on them, too ('Team Aniston'). The political and social statements that T-shirts often display have become, since the first decade of the 21st century, one of the reasons that they have so deeply permeated different levels of culture and society. The statements also may be found to be offensive, shocking, or pornographic to some. Examples of T-shirt stores and designers known for using offensive and shocking messages include [[T-Shirt Hell]] and [[Apollo Braun]]. Many different organizations have caught on to the statement-making trend, including chain and independent stores, websites, and schools.\n\nA popular phrase on the front of demonstrating the popularity of T-shirts among tourists is the humorous phrase \"I went to _____ and all I got was this lousy T-shirt.\"  Examples include \"My parents went to Las Vegas and all I got was this lousy T-shirt.\"\nT-shirt exchange is an activity where people trade the T-shirts that they are wearing.\n\nArtists like [[Bill Beckley]], Glen Baldridge and [[Peter Klashorst]] use T-shirts in their work. Models such as [[Victoria Beckham]] and [[Gisele Bundchen]] wore T-shirts through the 2000s. Paris Fashion Week 2014 featured a grunge style T-shirt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/street-style/paris-street-style-spring-2014-2036|title=Street style: Paris fashion week 2014|last=Pieri|first=Kerry|date=2013-10-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530001424/http://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/street-style/paris-street-style-spring-2014-2036|archive-date=2014-05-30|accessdate=2018-03-13}}</ref> Contemporary T-shirt designers like [[Balmain (fashion house)|Balmain]] and Street People Atelier produce new styles of T-shirts.\n\n==Decoration==\n[[File:Ringer t-shirt.png|frame|right|Ringer T-shirt]]\nIn the early 1950s, several companies based in [[Miami, Florida]], started to decorate T-shirts with different resort names and various characters. The first company was Tropix Togs, under founder Sam Kantor, in Miami. They were the original licensee for Walt Disney characters in 1976 including Mickey Mouse and Davy Crockett. Later, other companies expanded into the [[Textile printing|T-shirt printing]] business, including Sherry Manufacturing Company, also based in Miami. Sherry was founded in 1948 by its owner and founder Quentin H. Sandler as a screen printer of Souvenir Scarf's to the souvenir resort market.  Shortly, the company evolved into one of the largest screen printed resort and licensed apparel companies in the [[United States]].  The company now (2018) runs automatic Screen Print presses and produces up to 10,000 to 20,000 T-shirts each day.\n\nIn the 1960s, the [[ringer T-shirt]] appeared and became a staple fashion for youth and rock-n-rollers. The decade also saw the emergence of [[tie-dye]]ing and [[screen-printing]] on the basic T-shirt and the T-shirt became a medium for wearable art, commercial [[advertising]], [[souvenir]] messages, and [[protest art]] messages.  Psychedelic art poster designer [[Warren Dayton]] pioneered several political, protest, and pop-culture art printed large and in color on T-shirts featuring images of Cesar Chavez, political cartoons, and other cultural icons in an article in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' magazine in late 1969 (ironically, the clothing company quickly cancelled the experimental line, fearing there would not be a market). In the late 1960s, Richard Ellman, Robert Tree, Bill Kelly, and [[Stanley Mouse]] set up the Monster Company in Mill Valley, California, to produce fine art designs expressly for T-shirts. Monster T-shirts often feature emblems and motifs associated with the [[Grateful Dead]] and [[marijuana]] culture.<ref>''Monster T-shirt ART'', Monster Corporation catalog #3, Mill Valley 1974</ref> Additionally, one of the most popular symbols to emerge from the political turmoil of the 1960s were T-shirts bearing the face of [[Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara]].<ref>[http://www.sojones.com/news/1465-the-most-famous-statement-T-shirts/ The Most Famous Statement T-shirts] by SoJones Asmara, September 10, 2009</ref>\n\nToday, many notable and memorable T-shirts produced in the 1970s have become ensconced in pop culture. Examples include the bright yellow [[Harvey Ball|happy face]] T-shirts, [[The Rolling Stones]] tops with their \"tongue and lips\"<ref>File:The Rolling Stones Tongue Logo.png</ref> logo, and [[Milton Glaser]]'s iconic \"[[I Love New York|I \u2665 N Y]]\u201d design. In the mid-1980s, the white T-shirt became fashionable after the actor [[Don Johnson]] wore it with an Armani suit in ''[[Miami Vice]]''.<ref name=Harris />\n\n===Screen printing===\nThe most common form of commercial T-shirt decoration is [[screen printing]]. In screen printing, a design is separated into individual colors. [[Plastisol]] or water based [[ink]]s are applied to the shirt through mesh screens which limits the areas where ink is deposited. In most commercial T-shirt printing, the specific colors in the design are used. To achieve a wider color spectrum with a limited number of colors, process printing (using only [[CMYK|cyan, magenta, yellow and black]] ink) or simulated process (using only white, black, red, green, blue, and gold ink) is effective. Process printing is best suited for light colored shirts.<ref>{{cite web|title=CMYK Printing|url=http://www.impressionzprinting.com/services/color-printing/|publisher=ImpressionzPrinting.com|author=Steve Rhodes|quote=CMYK is a widely used technique to replicate full-color images on light colored backgrounds.  The full-color process originated to accurately reproduce artwork on white paper.}}</ref> The simulated process is best suited for dark colored shirts.\n\nIn 1959, the invention of [[plastisol]] provided an ink more durable and stretchable than water-based ink, allowing much more variety in T-shirt designs. Very few companies continue to use water-based inks on their shirts. The majority of companies that create shirts prefer plastisol due to the ability to print on varying colors without the need for color adjustment at the art level.\n\nSpecialty inks trend in and out of fashion and include [[Screen printing#Screen printing materials|shimmer]], [[Screen printing#Screen printing materials|puff]], [[Screen printing#Screen printing materials|discharge]], and chino based<ref>{{cite web|title=Subject: Re: chino ink??|url=http://forums.screenprinters.net/viewthread/2/405410|publisher=ScreenPrinters.Net|accessdate=13 January 2018|first=Lance|last=Huston|quote=Chino is a special Rutland INK BASE mixing system.\u2026 While on the surface it looks similar to a reduced base, it does have a unique print quality to it that offers a waterbase feel, without the hassles of waterbase inks.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923025320/http://forums.screenprinters.net/viewthread/2/405410|archivedate=23 September 2013}}</ref> inks. A metallic foil can be heat pressed and stamped onto any plastisol ink. When combined with shimmer ink, metallics give a mirror like effect wherever the previously screened plastisol ink was applied. Specialty inks are more expensive to purchase as well as screen and tend to appear on garments in boutiques.\n\nOther methods of decoration used on T-shirts include [[airbrush]], [[applique]], [[embroidery]], impressing or embossing, and the [[ironing]] on of either [[Flocking (texture)|flock]] lettering, [[Iron-on#Iron-on transfers|heat transfers]], or [[dye-sublimation]] transfers. [[Laser printer]]s are capable of printing on plain paper using a special [[toner]] containing sublimation dyes which can then be permanently heat-transferred to T-shirts.\n\nIn the 1980s, [[thermochromatic]] dyes were used to produce T-shirts that changed color when subjected to heat. The [[Hypercolor|Global Hypercolour]] brand of these was a common sight on the streets of the [[United Kingdom|UK]] for a few years but has since mostly disappeared. These were also very popular in the [[United States]] among teenagers in the late 1980s. A downside of color-change garments is that the dyes can easily be damaged, especially by [[laundry|washing]] in warm water or dye other clothes during washing.\n\n===Tie dye===\n[[File:TieDyeShirtMpegMan.jpg|thumb|An example of a [[tie-dye]]d T-shirt]]\nTie dye originated in India, Japan, Jamaica, and Africa as early as the sixth century.<ref name=\"iml.jou.ufl.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring09/blake_e/history.html|title=Peace, Love and Tie-Dye|website=Iml.jou.ufl.edu|accessdate=31 October 2017}}</ref> Some forms of tie dye are [[Bandhani]] (the oldest known technique) used in Indian cultures, and [[Shibori]] primarily used in Japanese cultures. It was not until the 1960s that tie dye was introduced to America during the [[hippie movement]].<ref name=\"iml.jou.ufl.edu\" />\n\n===Heat transfer vinyl (HTV)===\nAnother form of T-shirt decoration is heat transfer vinyl, also called HTV.  HTV is a polyurethane material that allows apparel designers to create unique layered designs using a specialized software program.  \nOnce the design is created, it is then cut through the material using a vinyl cutter (or Cut n Press) machine.\n\nThere are dozens of different colors available, as well as glitter, reflective, and now even unique patterns (such as mermaid skin) which come in rolls and sheets.\n\nAfter the design is cut, there is a process called \u201cweeding\u201d whereby the areas of the design that do not represent the design are picked away from the transfer sheet and removed so that the intended design remains. \nHTV is typically smooth to the touch and does not feel rubbery or stiff.  \n\nThe edges are typically clean cut and produce high contrast.\n\nDesigners can also create multiple color designs, or multi-layered designs using HTV. This process would be done in the design software before the design is sent to the cutter for the different materials\nA heat press is then used to apply pressure and heat to the vinyl so that the material permanently adheres to the garment.   The temperature and pressure vary according to the manufacturers specifications.\n\n=== Dye-sublimation printing ===\nDye-sublimation printing is a direct-to-garment digital printing technology using full color artwork to transfer images to polyester and polymer-coated substrate based T-shirts. Dye-sublimation (also commonly referred to as all-over printing) came into widespread use in the 21st century, enabling some designs previously impossible. Printing with unlimited colors using large CMYK printers with special paper and ink is possible, unlike screen printing which requires screens for each color of the design. All-over print T-shirts have solved the problem with color fading and the vibrancy is higher than most standard printing methods but requires synthetic fabrics for the ink to take hold. The key feature of dye-sublimated clothing is that the design is not printed on top of the garment, but permanently dyed into the threads of the shirt, ensuring that it will never fade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thatshirtwascash.com/pages/about-us|title=About Us and FAQs (read dis) \u2013 Shirtwascash|website=Shirtwascash|accessdate=2015-11-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029055207/http://thatshirtwascash.com/pages/about-us|archive-date=2015-10-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDye-sublimation is economically viable for small-quantity printing; the unit cost is similar for short or long production runs. Screen printing has higher setup costs, requiring large numbers to be produced to be cost-effective, and the unit cost is higher.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nSolid ink [[Phase transition|is changed into a gas]] without passing through a [[liquid]] phase ([[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]]), using heat and pressure. The design is first produced in a computer [[image file format]] such as jpg, gif, png, or any other. It is printed on a purpose-made [[computer printer]] ({{As of|2016|lc=y}} most commonly Epson or Ricoh brands) using large heat presses to vaporize the ink directly into the fabric. By mid-2012 this method had become widely used for T-shirts.\n\n=== Other methods ===\nBefore the hippie movement [[Rit Dye]] was known as a hobby for older women. Other methods of decorating shirts include using paints, markers, fabric transfer crayons, dyes, spray paint, and many more. Some techniques that can be used include sponging, [[stenciling]], [[wikt:daub#Verb|daubing]], [[wikt:stamping|stamping]], [[screen printing]], bleaching, and many more.<ref>Taylor, Carol.

In keeping with their focus on accuracy, rifles are typically designed to be held with both hands and braced against the shooter's shoulder for stability during firing. \n\nThe term was originally '''''rifled gun''''', with the [[verb]] \"rifle\" referring to the [[early modern]] [[machining]] process of creating groovings with [[cutting tool]]s. By the 20th century, the weapon had become so common that the modern [[noun]] \"rifle\" is now often used for any long-shaped handheld [[ranged weapon]] designed for well-aimed discharge activated by a [[trigger (firearms)|trigger]] (e.g. [[personnel halting and stimulation response rifle]], which is a [[laser dazzler]]).\n\nLike all typical firearms, a rifle's [[projectile]] ([[bullet]]) is propelled by the contained [[deflagration]] of a combustible [[propellant]] compound (originally [[black powder]], later [[cordite]], and now [[nitrocellulose]]), although other means such as [[compressed air]] are used in [[air rifle]]s, which are popular for [[pest control|vermin control]], [[game (hunting)|small game]] hunting, [[shooting at the Summer Olympics|competitive target shooting]] and casual [[shooting sport|sport shooting]] (\"[[plinking]]\").\n\nThe distinct feature that separates a rifle from the earlier [[smoothbore]] [[long gun]]s (e.g. [[arquebus]]es, [[musket]]s) is the '''rifling''' within its [[gun barrel]].  The raised areas of a barrel's rifling are called \"lands\", which make contact with and exert [[torque]] on the projectile as it moves within the bore, imparting a spin around its longitudinal axis.  When the projectile leaves the barrel, this spin persists and lends [[gyroscopic]] stability to the projectile due to [[conservation of angular momentum]], preventing [[yaw (rotation)|yaw]]ing and tumbling in flight, in the same way that a spirally thrown [[ball (gridiron football)|American football]] or [[rugby ball]] behaves.  This allows the use of more elongated and aerodynamically-efficient bullets (as opposed to the spherical [[round shot|ball]]s used in [[muskets]]) and thus improves range and accuracy.  Rifles are used extensively in [[war]]fare, [[law enforcement]], [[hunting]] and [[shooting sports]].\n\n==Terminology==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n[[File:Garandparts.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Names of parts of the [[M1 Garand]] rifle, [[World War II]] era, from US Army field manual]]\nHistorically, rifles only fired a single projectile with each squeeze of the trigger. Modern rifles are commonly classified as single shot, bolt action, semi-automatic, or automatic.  Single shot, bolt action, and semi-automatic rifles are limited by their designs to fire a single shot for each trigger pull.  Only automatic rifles are capable of firing more than one round per trigger squeeze; however, some automatic rifles are limited to fixed bursts of two, three, or more rounds per squeeze.  \n\nModern [[automatic rifle]]s overlap to some extent in design and function with [[machine gun]]s. In fact, many light machine guns (such as the Russian [[RPK]]) are adaptations of existing automatic rifle designs. A military's light machine guns are typically chambered for the same caliber ammunition as its service rifles. Generally, the difference between an automatic rifle and a machine gun comes down to weight, cooling system, and ammunition feed system.  Rifles, with their relatively lighter components (which overheat quickly) and smaller capacity [[Magazine (firearms)|magazines]], are incapable of sustained automatic fire in the way that machine guns are; they trade this capability in favor of increased mobility. Modern military rifles are fed by magazines, while machine guns are generally [[Belt (firearms)|belt-fed]]. Many machine guns allow the operator to quickly exchange barrels in order to prevent overheating, whereas rifles generally do not. Most machine guns fire from an open [[Bolt (firearms)|bolt]] in order to reduce the danger of \"cook-off\", while almost all rifles fire from a closed bolt for accuracy. Machine guns are often crewed by more than one soldier; the rifle is an individual weapon.\n\nThe term \"rifle\" is sometimes used to describe larger rifled [[crew-served weapon]]s firing explosive shells, for example, [[recoilless rifle]]s and [[naval rifle]]s.\n\nIn many works of fiction a rifle refers to any weapon that has a [[stock (firearm)|stock]] and is shouldered before firing, even if the weapon is not rifled or does not fire solid projectiles (e.g. a \"laser rifle\").\n\n==Historical overview==\n[[File:Marlin 35 rem 2.jpg|thumb|175px|right|Rifling in a [[.35 Remington]] microgroove rifled barrel]]\n[[File:Girdled bullet and twin rifle groove.jpg|thumb|175px|right|Girdled bullet and twin rifle groove of the [[Brunswick rifle]], mid-19th century]]\n\nThe origins of rifling are difficult to trace, but some of the earliest practical experiments seem to have occurred in Europe during the 15th century. [[Archery|Archers]] had long realized that a twist added to the tail feathers of their arrows gave them greater accuracy. Early muskets produced large quantities of smoke and soot, which had to be cleaned from the action and bore of the musket frequently, either through the action of repeated bore scrubbing, or a deliberate attempt to create \"soot grooves\" that would allow for more shots to be fired from the firearm. This might also have led to a perceived increase in accuracy, although no one knows for sure. True rifling dates from the mid-15th century,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} although military commanders preferred smooth bore weapons for [[infantry]] use because rifles were much more prone to problems due to powder fouling the barrel and because they took longer to reload and fire than muskets.{{citation needed|date = June 2015}}\n\nRifles were created as an improvement in the accuracy of smooth bore muskets. In the early 18th century, [[Benjamin Robins]], an English mathematician, realized that an elongated bullet would retain the momentum and kinetic energy of a musket ball, but would slice through the air with greater ease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=<!--No by-line.--> |date=April 1860 |title=The How and Why of Long Shots and Straight Shots |url=http://www.researchpress.co.uk/longrange/longshots.htm |publisher=[[Cornhill Magazine]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104021518/http://www.researchpress.co.uk/longrange/longshots.htm |archivedate=November 4, 2010}}</ref> The black powder used in early muzzle-loading rifles quickly fouled the barrel, making loading slower and more difficult. Their greater range was also considered to be of little practical use, since the smoke from black powder quickly obscured the battlefield and made it almost impossible to target the enemy from a distance. Since musketeers could not afford to take the time to stop and clean their barrels in the middle of a battle, rifles were limited to use by [[Marksman|sharpshooters]] and non-military uses like hunting.{{citation needed|date = June 2015}}\n\nMuskets were [[smoothbore]], large caliber weapons using ball-shaped ammunition fired at relatively low velocity. Due to the high cost and great difficulty of precision manufacturing, and the need to load readily from the muzzle, the musket ball was a loose fit in the barrel. Consequently, on firing the ball bounced off the sides of the barrel when fired and the final direction on leaving the muzzle was unpredictable.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe performance of early muskets defined the style of warfare at the time.  Due to the lack of accuracy, soldiers were deployed in long lines (thus [[Line infantry]]) to fire at the opposing forces. Precise aim was thus not necessary to hit an opponent. Muskets were used for comparatively rapid, imprecisely aimed volley fire, and the average soldier could be easily trained to use them.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn the [[History of Kentucky|territory of Kentucky]], one of the most successful early rifles, the [[long rifle]], was developed over the course of the 18th century. Compared to the more common [[Brown Bess]], they had a tighter bore, no room between bullet and barrel, and still used balls instead of conical bullets. The balls the long rifle used were smaller, allowing the production of more rounds for a given amount of lead. These rifles also had longer barrels, allowing more accuracy, which were rifled with a [[helix|helical]] groove. These first started appearing sometime before 1740, one early example being made by Jacob Dickert, a German immigrant. By 1850 there were a number of such manufacturers in the area. The longer barrel was a departure by local gunsmiths from their German roots, allowing frontiersmen to carry more rounds and bullets to achieve a higher speed (as the burning gunpowder was contained longer) before emerging from the barrel.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe rifle was used for precise shooting, aiming and firing at individual targets, instead of the musket's use for imprecise fire.<ref name=\"npr.org\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=98578531|title=Book Explores History Of The American Rifle|newspaper=NPR.org|access-date=2017-02-11|language=en}}</ref>\n\nBy the time of the [[American Revolutionary War]], these rifles were commonly used by frontiersmen, and Congress authorized the establishment of ten companies of riflemen. One of the most important units was [[Morgan's Riflemen]], led by [[Daniel Morgan]]. This sharpshooting unit eventually proved themselves integral to the [[Battle of Saratoga]], and in the southern states where General Morgan commanded as well. Aided by the rifle's improved accuracy, Morgan's sharpshooters would pick off cannoneers and officers, reducing the impact of enemy artillery.<ref>[http://www.revolutionarywararchives.org/longrifle.html Those Tall American Patriots and Their Long Rifles]</ref> This kind of advantage was considered pivotal in many battles, like [[The Battle of Cowpens]], [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]], and [[Battle of King's Mountain|King's Mountain]].<ref>[http://www.breathittcounty.com/01-08023.html A Short History Of The Kentucky Long Rifle]</ref>\n\nLater during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the British [[Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)|95th Regiment (Green Jackets)]] and [[60th Regiment of Foot|60th Regiment, (Royal American)]], as well as sharpshooters and riflemen during the [[War of 1812]], used the rifle to great effect during skirmishing. Because of a slower loading time than a musket, they were not adopted by the whole army. Since rifles were used by sharpshooters who did not routinely fire over other men's shoulders, long length was not required to avoid the forward line. A shorter length made a handier weapon in which tight-fitting balls did not have to be rammed so far down the barrel.{{citation needed|date = June 2015}}\n\nThe invention of the [[minie balls]] in the 1840s solved the slow loading problem, and in the 1850s and 1860s rifles quickly replaced muskets on the battlefield. Many rifles, often referred to as [[rifled musket]]s, were very similar to the muskets they replaced, but the military also experimented with other designs. [[Breech-loading weapon]]s proved to have a much faster rate of fire than muzzleloaders, causing military forces to abandon muzzle loaders in favor of breech-loading designs in the late 1860s. In the later part of the 19th century, rifles were generally single-shot, breech-loading guns, designed for aimed, discretionary fire by individual soldiers. Then, as now, rifles had a stock, either fixed or folding, to be braced against the shoulder when firing.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe adoption of [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridges]] and breech-loading in the 19th century was concurrent with the general adoption of rifles. In the early part of the 20th century, soldiers were trained to shoot accurately over long ranges with high-powered cartridges. World War I [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] rifles (among others) were equipped with long-range 'volley sights' for massed firing at ranges of up to {{convert|1.6|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. Individual shots were unlikely to hit, but a platoon firing repeatedly could produce a 'beaten ground' effect similar to light artillery or machine guns.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\nCurrently, rifles are the most common firearm in general use for [[hunting]] purposes (with the exception of bird hunting, where [[shotguns]] are favored). Rifles derived from military designs have long been popular with civilian shooters.<ref>{{cite book|title=Shooter's Bible Guide to Tactical Firearms: A Comprehensive Guide to Precision Rifles and Long-Range Shooting Gear| author= Robert A.

These Rifle Regiments were deployed as skirmishers during the Peninsular war in Spain and Portugal, and were more effective than skirmishers armed with muskets due to their accuracy and long range.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Muzzle-loading===\n{{Main article|Muzzle-loading rifle}} \n\nGradually, rifles appeared with cylindrical barrels cut with helical grooves, the surfaces between the grooves being \"lands\". The innovation shortly preceded the mass adoption of [[breech-loading weapon]]s, as it was not practical to push an overbore bullet down through a rifled barrel, only to then (try to) fire it back out. The dirt and grime from prior shots was pushed down ahead of a tight bullet or ball (which may have been a loose fit in the clean barrel before the first shot), and loading was far more difficult, as the lead had to be deformed to go down in the first place, reducing the accuracy due to deformation. Several systems were tried to deal with the problem, usually by resorting to an under-bore bullet that expanded upon firing.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\n[[File:Delvigne system.jpg|thumb|The method developed by [[Henri-Gustave Delvigne|Delvigne]] for his rifles, with the lead bullet being supported by a wooden sabot at its base.]]\n\nThe original muzzle-loading rifle, with a closely fitting ball to take the [[rifling]] grooves, was loaded with difficulty, particularly when foul, and for this reason was not generally used for military purposes. Even with the advent of rifling the bullet itself didn't change, but was wrapped in a greased, cloth patch to grip the rifling grooves.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe first half of the 19th century saw a distinct change in the shape and function of the bullet. In 1826 [[Henri-Gustave Delvigne|Delvigne]], a French [[infantry]] officer, invented a breech with abrupt shoulders on which a spherical bullet was rammed down until it caught the rifling grooves. Delvigne's method, however, deformed the bullet and was inaccurate.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\nSoon after, the [[Carabine \u00e0 tige]] was invented by [[Louis-Etienne de Thouvenin]], which provided for a stem at the bottom at the barrel that would deform and expand the base of the bullet when rammed, therefore enabling accurate contact with the rifling. However, the area around the stem would clog and get dirty easily.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\n====Mini\u00e9 system \u2013 the \"rifled musket\"====\n{{Main article|Mini\u00e9 ball|Mini\u00e9 rifle}}\n[[File:Japanese Minie rifle(Mirror).jpg|300px|thumb|French-made [[Mini\u00e9 rifle]] used in [[Japan]] during the [[Boshin war]] (1868\u20131869).]]\n\nOne of the most famous was the Mini\u00e9 system, invented by French Army Captain [[Claude-\u00c9tienne Mini\u00e9]], which relied on a conical bullet (known as a Mini\u00e9 ball) with a hollow skirt at the base of the bullet. When fired, the skirt would expand from the pressure of the exploding charge and grip the rifling as the round was fired. The better seal gave more power, as less gas escaped past the bullet, which combined with the fact that for the same [[gauge (bore diameter)|bore]] ([[caliber]]) diameter a long bullet was heavier than a round ball. The extra grip also spun the bullet more consistently, which increased the range from about 50 yards for a smooth bore musket to about 300 yards for a rifle using the Mini\u00e9 system. The expanding skirt of the Mini\u00e9 ball also solved the problem that earlier tight fitting bullets were difficult to load as black powder residue fouled the inside of the barrel. The Mini\u00e9 system allowed conical bullets to be loaded into rifles just as quickly as round balls in smooth bores, which allowed [[rifled musket|rifle muskets]] to replace muskets on the battlefield. Mini\u00e9 system rifles, notably the [[Springfield Model 1861|U.S. Springfield]] and the [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|British Enfield]] of the early 1860s, featured prominently in the [[U.S. Civil War]], due to their enhanced power and accuracy.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\nOver the 19th century, bullet design also evolved, the bullets becoming gradually smaller and lighter. By 1910 the standard blunt-nosed bullet had been replaced with the pointed, [[Spitzer (bullet)|'spitzer' bullet]], an innovation that increased range and penetration. [[Cartridge (weaponry)|Cartridge]] design evolved from simple paper tubes containing [[black powder]] and shot, to sealed brass cases with integral [[Primer (firearm)|primers]] for ignition, while black powder itself was replaced with [[cordite]], and then other nitro-cellulose-based [[smokeless powder]] mixtures, propelling bullets to higher velocities than before.<ref name=\"GlobalSecurity\">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/rifle-history.htm|title=Rifled Breech Loader|publisher=globalsecurity.org}}</ref>\n\nThe increased velocity meant that new problems arrived, and so bullets went from being soft lead to harder lead, then to [[full metal jacket bullet|copper-jacketed]], in order to better engage the spiraled grooves without \"stripping\" them in the same way that a screw or bolt thread would be stripped if subjected to extreme forces.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Breech loading===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{Main article|Breech-loading weapon}}\n[[File:Chassepot-p1000739.jpg|thumb|Loading mechanism of the [[Chassepot]]]]\n\nFrom 1836, breech-loading rifles were introduced with the German Dreyse [[Needle gun]], and followed by the French [[Tabati\u00e8re]] in 1857 the British Calisher and Terry carbine made in Birmingham and later in 1864 and the more well known British [[Snider\u2013Enfield]]. Primitive chamber-locking mechanisms were soon replaced by [[bolt-action]] mechanisms, exemplified by the [[Chassepot]] in 1866. Breech loading was to have a major impact on warfare, as breech-loading rifles can be fired at a rate many times higher than muzzle loaded rifles and significantly can be loaded from a prone rather than standing position. Firing prone (i.e., lying down) is more accurate than firing from a standing position, and a prone rifleman presents a much smaller target than a standing soldier. The higher accuracy and range, combined with reduced vulnerability generally benefited the defense while making the traditional battle between lines of standing and volleying infantry men obsolete.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Revolving rifle===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{Main article|Revolver#History}}\n[[File:Colt Roots British Carbine.JPG|thumb|300px|Colt Model 1855 Carbine]]\nRevolving rifles were an attempt to increase the rate of fire of rifles by combining them with the revolving firing mechanism that had been developed earlier for revolving pistols. Colt began experimenting with revolving rifles in the early 19th century, and other manufacturers like Remington later experimented with them as well. The [[Colt revolving rifle|Colt Revolving Rifle Model 1855]] was an early repeating rifle and the first one to be used by the U.S. Government, and saw some limited action during the [[American Civil War]]. Revolvers, both rifles and pistols, tend to spray fragments of metal from the front of the cylinder.\n\n=== Repeating rifle ===\nThe [[Winchester rifle|Winchester repeating rifle]] was invented in the mid-1800s. An operator pulled on a lever to reload the rifle with a stored cartridge.<ref name=\"npr.org\"/>\n\n===Cartridge storage===\nAn important area of development was the way that cartridges were stored and used in the weapon. The [[Spencer repeating rifle]] was a breech-loading manually operated [[lever action]] rifle that was adopted by the United States. Over 20,000 were used during the American Civil War. It marked the first adoption of a removable [[magazine (firearms)|magazine]]-fed infantry rifle by any country. The design was completed by [[Christopher Spencer]] in 1860.<ref>{{cite book|title=Almanac of American Military History| author= Spencer Tucker|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year= 2013|page= 1028 |isbn=1598845306}}</ref> It used copper [[rimfire ammunition|rimfire cartridges]] stored in a removable seven round tube magazine, enabling the rounds to be fired one after another.

However, following the advent of more powerful smokeless powder, a shorter barrel did not impair accuracy as much. As a result, cavalry saw limited, but noteworthy, usage in 20th century conflicts.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe advent of massed, rapid firepower of the [[machine gun]], [[submachine gun]] and the rifled [[artillery]] piece was so quick as to outstrip the development of any way to attack a [[Trench warfare|trench]] defended by riflemen and machine gunners. The carnage of [[World War I]] was perhaps the greatest vindication and vilification of the rifle as a military weapon.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe [[M1 Garand]] was a semi-automatic rapid-fire rifle developed for modern warfare use in [[World War II]].<ref name=\"npr.org\"/>\n\n[[File:Hunting rifle 02.png|thumb|300x300px|[[Remington Model 700]] in [[.30-06 Springfield]] with mounted [[telescopic sight]] and [[suppressor]]]]\n\nDuring and after [[World War II]] it became accepted that most infantry engagements occur at ranges of less than 300&nbsp;m; the range and power of the large full-powered rifle cartridges were \"overkill\"; and thus the weapons were heavier than ideal. This led to Germany's development of the [[7.92\u00d733mm|7.92\u00d733mm ''Kurz'']] (short) round, the [[Sturmgewehr 44|MKb-42]], and ultimately, the [[assault rifle]]. Today, an infantryman's rifle is optimized for ranges of 300&nbsp;m or less, and soldiers are trained to deliver individual rounds or bursts of fire within these distances. Typically, the application of accurate, long-range fire is the domain of the [[Designated marksman|marksman]] and the [[sniper]] in warfare, and of enthusiastic target shooters in peacetime.

A youth rifle is often a single shot [[.22 caliber]] rifle, or a [[bolt action]] rifle, although some youth rifles are semi-automatic. They are usually very light, with a greatly shortened length of pull, which is necessary to accommodate children.  Youth stocks are available for many popular rifles, such as the [[Ruger 10/22]], a semi-automatic .22 LR rifle, allowing a youth rifle to be made from a standard rifle by simply changing the stock.  The typical ages of shooters for such rifles vary from about age 5 to 11 years old.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n==Technical aspects==\n\n===Rifling===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{Main article|Rifling}}\n\nThe usual form of rifling was helical grooves in a round bore.\n\nSome early rifled guns had barrels with a twisted polygonal bore. The [[Whitworth rifle]] was the first such type designed to spin the round for accuracy. Bullets for these guns were made to match the shape of the bore so the bullet would grip the rifle bore and take a spin that way. These were generally large caliber weapons and the ammunition still did not fit tightly in the barrel. Many different shapes and degrees of spiraling were used in experimental designs. One widely produced example was the Metford rifling in the Pattern 1888 [[Lee\u2013Metford]] service rifle. Although uncommon, [[polygonal rifling]] is still used in some weapons today, with one example being the [[Glock]] line of pistols (which fire standard bullets). Unfortunately, many of these early designs were prone to dangerous backfiring, which could lead to destruction of the weapon and serious injury to the person firing it.\n\n===Barrel wear===\n[[File:Benchrest mauser rifle.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Benchrest shooting]] with a Mauser rifle]]\n\nAs the bullet enters the barrel, it inserts itself into the rifling, a process that gradually wears down the barrel, and also causes the barrel to heat up more rapidly. Therefore, some [[machine gun]]s are equipped with quick-change barrels that can be swapped every few thousand rounds, or in earlier designs, were water-cooled. Unlike older carbon [[steel]] barrels, which were limited to around 1,000 shots before the extreme heat caused accuracy to fade, modern [[stainless steel]] barrels for target rifles are much more resistant to wear, allowing many thousands of rounds to be fired before accuracy drops. (Many shotguns and small arms have [[Chrome plating|chrome]]-lined barrels to reduce wear and enhance corrosion resistance. This is rare on rifles designed for extreme accuracy, as the plating process is difficult and liable to reduce the effect of the rifling.) Modern ammunition has a hardened lead core with a softer outer cladding or jacket, typically of an alloy of copper and nickel \u2013 [[cupro-nickel]]. Some ammunition is even coated with [[molybdenum disulfide]] to further reduce internal friction \u2013 the so-called 'moly-coated' bullet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.6mmbr.com/bulletcoating.html|title=GUIDE to Bullet Coating|website=www.6mmbr.com|access-date=2017-01-12}}</ref>\n\n===Rate of fire===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{Main article|Rate of fire}}\n\nRifles were initially single-shot, muzzle-loading weapons. During the 18th century, breech-loading weapons were designed, which allowed the rifleman to reload while under cover, but defects in manufacturing and the difficulty in forming a reliable gas-tight seal prevented widespread adoption. During the 19th century, multi-shot [[repeating rifle]]s using [[lever-action|lever]], [[pump-action|pump]] or linear [[bolt action]]s became standard, further increasing the rate of fire and minimizing the fuss involved in loading a firearm. The problem of proper seal creation had been solved with the use of brass cartridge cases, which expanded in an [[elastic (solid mechanics)|elastic]] fashion at the point of firing and effectively sealed the breech while the pressure remained high, then relaxed back enough to allow for easy removal. By the end of the 19th century, the leading bolt-action design was that of [[Paul Mauser]], whose action\u2014wedded to a reliable design possessing a five-shot magazine\u2014became a world standard through two world wars and beyond. The [[Mauser rifle]] was paralleled by Britain's ten-shot [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] and America's 1903 [[M1903 Springfield rifle|Springfield Rifle]] models. The American M1903 closely copied Mauser's original design.\n\n===Range===\nBarrel [[rifling]] dramatically increased the range and accuracy of the musket. Indeed, throughout its development, the rifle's history has been marked by increases in range and accuracy. From the [[Mini\u00e9 rifle]] and beyond, the rifle has become ever more potent at long range strikes.\n\nIn recent decades, large-caliber anti-materiel rifles, typically firing between 12.7&nbsp;mm and 20&nbsp;mm caliber cartridges, have been developed. The US [[M82 Barrett rifle|Barrett M82A1]] is probably the best-known such rifle. These weapons are typically used to strike critical, vulnerable targets such as computerized command and control vehicles, radio trucks, radar antennae, vehicle engine blocks and the jet engines of enemy aircraft. Anti-materiel rifles can be used against human targets, but the much higher weight of rifle and ammunition, and the massive recoil and muzzle blast, usually make them less than practical for such use. The Barrett M82 is designed with a maximum effective range of {{convert|1800|m|mi|abbr=on}}, although it has a confirmed kill distance of {{convert|2430|m|mi|abbr=on}} in [[Afghanistan]] during [[Operation Anaconda]] in 2002.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.macleans.ca/canada/national/article.jsp?content=20060515_126689_126689 | authorlink = Michael Friscolanti | last=Friscolanti|first=Michael|title=We were abandoned|journal=[[Maclean's]]|publisher=[[Rogers Communications|Rogers Publishing]]|date=2006-05-15|pages=18\u201325}}</ref> The [[longest recorded sniper kills|record for the longest confirmed kill shot]] stands at {{convert|3540|m|ft|abbr=on}}, set by an unnamed soldier with Canada's elite special operations unit [[Joint Task Force 2]] using a [[McMillan TAC-50]] sniper rifle.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/canadian-elite-special-forces-sniper-sets-record-breaking-kill-shot-in-iraq/article35415651/ |title=Canadian elite special forces sniper makes record-breaking kill shot in Iraq |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |first=Robert |last=Fife |date=June 21, 2017 |accessdate=February 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Bullet rotational speed (RPM)===\nBullets leaving a rifled barrel can spin at a [[rotational speed]] of over 100,000 revolutions per minute (rpm, or 1.67 kilohertz) depending on the muzzle velocity of the bullet and the [[Rifling#Twist rate|pitch]] of the rifling. The rotational speed of the bullet can be calculated by using the formula below. The formula divides the number of inches in a foot (12) by the rate of twist that the barrel has. This number is multiplied by the muzzle velocity (MV) and the number of seconds in a minute (60). For example, a bullet with a muzzle velocity of {{convert|3000|ft/s|m/s}} leaving a barrel that twists once per foot (1/12\") would rotate at 180,000rpm.<ref>{{cite web|title=Calculating Bullet RPM \u2014 Spin Rates and Stability|url=http://accurateshooter.wordpress.com/2008/06/03/calculating-bullet-rpm-spin-rates-and-stability/|work=AccurateShooter.com|accessdate=26 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n*MV / twist rate = rotational speed\n*MV (in fps) \u00d7 (12 in. /twist rate) \u00d7 60 s/min. = Bullet RPM\nExample using a barrel that has a twist rate of 1 turn in 8\" with a muzzle velocity of 3000&nbsp;ft/s:\n*3000 fps \u00d7 (12\"/(8\"/rotation)) \u00d7 60 s/min. = 270,000 RPM\nExcessive rotational speed can exceed the bullet's designed limits and the inadequate centripetal force will fail to keep the bullet from disintegrating in a radial fashion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Topic of the Month: July 2001 \u2013 Twist Rate |url=http://www.loadammo.com/Topics/July01.htm |work=Load From A Disk |accessdate=26 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512015023/http://www.loadammo.com/Topics/July01.htm |archivedate=12 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Caliber===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\nRifles may be chambered in a variety of calibers, from as low as [[.17 HMR|.17]] (4.4mm) [[Varmint rifle|varmint]] calibers to as high as [[20mm|.80 caliber]] in the case of the largest anti tank rifles. The term [[caliber]] essentially refers to the width of the bullet fired through a rifle's barrel. Armies have consistently attempted to find and procure the most lethal and accurate caliber for their firearms.\n\nThe standard calibers used by the world's militaries tend to follow worldwide trends. These trends have significantly changed during the centuries of firearm design and re-design. Muskets were normally chambered for large calibers, such as .50 or .59, with the theory that these large bullets caused the most damage.\n\nDuring World War I and II, most rifles were chambered in .30 caliber, a combination of power and speed. Examples would be the [[.303 British]] [[Lee\u2013Enfield]], the American [[M1903 Springfield|M1903]] [[.30-06 Springfield|.30-06]], and the German [[Karabiner 98k|8mm Mauser K98]].\n\nAn exception was the Italian [[Carcano|Modello 91]] rifle, which used the [[6.5\u00d752mm Mannlicher\u2013Carcano]] cartridge.\n\nDetailed study of infantry combat during and after WWII revealed that most small-arms engagements occurred within 100 meters, meaning that the power and range of the traditional .30-caliber weapons (designed for engagements at 500 meters and beyond) was essentially wasted. The single greatest predictor of an individual soldier's combat effectiveness was the number of rounds he fired. Weapons designers and strategists realized that service rifles firing smaller-caliber projectiles would allow troops to carry far more ammunition for the same weight. The lower recoil and more generous magazine capacities of small-caliber weapons also allows troops a much greater volume of fire, compared to historical [[battle rifles]]. Smaller, faster traveling, less stable projectiles have also demonstrated greater terminal ballistics and therein, a greater lethality than traditional .30-caliber rounds. Most modern service rifles fire a projectile of approximately 5.56mm. Examples of firearms in this range are the American [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO|5.56&nbsp;mm]] [[M16 rifle|M16]] and the Russian [[5.45\u00d739mm]] [[AK-74]].\n\n===Types of rifle===\n{{Prose|section|date=March 2018}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n====By mechanism====\n* [[Air gun]]\n** Spring-piston\n*** Break barrel\n*** Fixed barrel\n**** Underlever\n**** Sidelever\n**** Overlever\n** Pneumatic (internal pressure reservoir)\n*** Pump pneumatic, either single-stroke or multi-stroke\n*** Pre-charged pneumatic (PCP)\n** Compressed gas (external pressure reservoir)\n*** CO<sub>2</sub>\n*** High pressure air (HPA)\n* [[Firearm]]\n** [[Single-shot]]\n*** [[Muzzle-loading rifle]], some [[flintlock]] and mostly [[caplock]]\n*** [[Breech-loading weapon|Breech-loading rifle]]\n**** [[Breechblock]] rifle, either [[trapdoor mechanism|trapdoor]], [[rolling block|rolling]], [[falling block|dropping]], [[Single-shot#Tilting block actions|tilting]] or [[Ferguson rifle|screwed]]\n**** [[Break action|Break-action]] rifle\n**** [[Double rifle]] ([[List of multiple barrel firearms#Rifles|list]])\n** [[Repeating rifle|Repeating]]\n*** Manual\n**** [[Colt revolving rifle|Revolving rifle]]\n**** [[Lever-action rifle]], e.g. [[Winchester rifle]], [[Spencer rifle]]\n**** [[Pump action|Pump-action]] rifle, e.g. [[Colt Lightning Carbine]]\n**** [[Bolt action|Bolt-action rifle]]\n***** Turn-pull, e.g. [[Gewehr 98|Mauser G98]], [[Lee-Enfield]], [[Mosin-Nagant]]\n***** Straight-pull, e.g. [[Ross rifle]], [[K31]], [[Mannlicher M1895]], [[Blaser R93]]/[[Blaser R8|R8]]\n**** Bolt-release rifle, also known as lever-release rifle, e.g. [[Verney-Carron]] SpeedLine\n*** Self-loading\n**** [[Semi-automatic rifle]]\n**** [[Automatic rifle]]\n***** [[Selective-fire]] rifle\n{{col-2}}\n\n====By usage====\n*[[Military]] and [[law enforcement]]\n**[[Anti-materiel rifle]]\n**[[Anti-tank rifle]]\n**[[Long rifle]]\n**[[Personal defense weapon]]\n**Precision rifle\n***[[Designated marksman rifle]] \n***[[Sniper rifle]] ([[List of sniper rifles|list]])\n**[[Scout rifle]]\n**[[Service rifle]]\n***[[Assault rifle]] ([[List of assault rifles|list]])\n***[[Battle rifle]] ([[List of battle rifles|list]])\n***[[Carbine]] ([[List of carbines|list]])\n*[[Civilian]]\n**[[Hunting weapon#Rifles|Hunting rifle]]\n***[[Buffalo rifle]]\n***[[Elephant rifle]]\n***[[Express rifle]]\n**[[Shooting sport|Match/target]] rifle\n***[[Benchrest rifle]]\n**[[Modern sporting rifle]]\n**[[Short-barreled rifle]]\n**[[Varmint rifle]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=25em}}\n*[[Advanced Combat Rifle]]/[[Project Abakan]]\n*[[Antique firearms]]\n*[[British military rifles]]\n*[[Gun safety]]\n*[[Handgun]]\n*[[List of assault rifles]]\n*[[List of battle rifles]]\n*[[List of multiple-barrel firearms#Rifles|List of multiple barrel rifles]]\n*[[List of rifle cartridges]]\n*[[List of sniper rifles]]\n*[[Objective Individual Combat Weapon]]\n*[[Rifle grenade]]\n*[[Rifling]]\n*[[Service rifle]]\n*[[Shooting]]\n*[[Shooting at the Summer Olympics]]\n*[[Shooting range]]\n*[[Shooting sport]]\n*[[Shotgun]]\n*[[Telescopic sight]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|\nrefs=\n<ref name=MRJapan2006>{{cite book |last1=Honeycutt |first1=Fred L. |last2=Anthony |first2=F.

In keeping with their focus on accuracy, rifles are typically designed to be held with both hands and braced against the shooter's shoulder for stability during firing. \n\nThe term was originally '''''rifled gun''''', with the [[verb]] \"rifle\" referring to the [[early modern]] [[machining]] process of creating groovings with [[cutting tool]]s. By the 20th century, the weapon had become so common that the modern [[noun]] \"rifle\" is now often used for any long-shaped handheld [[ranged weapon]] designed for well-aimed discharge activated by a [[trigger (firearms)|trigger]] (e.g. [[personnel halting and stimulation response rifle]], which is a [[laser dazzler]]).\n\nLike all typical firearms, a rifle's [[projectile]] ([[bullet]]) is propelled by the contained [[deflagration]] of a combustible [[propellant]] compound (originally [[black powder]], later [[cordite]], and now [[nitrocellulose]]), although other means such as [[compressed air]] are used in [[air rifle]]s, which are popular for [[pest control|vermin control]], [[game (hunting)|small game]] hunting, [[shooting at the Summer Olympics|competitive target shooting]] and casual [[shooting sport|sport shooting]] (\"[[plinking]]\").\n\nThe distinct feature that separates a rifle from the earlier [[smoothbore]] [[long gun]]s (e.g. [[arquebus]]es, [[musket]]s) is the '''rifling''' within its [[gun barrel]].  The raised areas of a barrel's rifling are called \"lands\", which make contact with and exert [[torque]] on the projectile as it moves within the bore, imparting a spin around its longitudinal axis.  When the projectile leaves the barrel, this spin persists and lends [[gyroscopic]] stability to the projectile due to [[conservation of angular momentum]], preventing [[yaw (rotation)|yaw]]ing and tumbling in flight, in the same way that a spirally thrown [[ball (gridiron football)|American football]] or [[rugby ball]] behaves.  This allows the use of more elongated and aerodynamically-efficient bullets (as opposed to the spherical [[round shot|ball]]s used in [[muskets]]) and thus improves range and accuracy.  Rifles are used extensively in [[war]]fare, [[law enforcement]], [[hunting]] and [[shooting sports]].\n\n==Terminology==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n[[File:Garandparts.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Names of parts of the [[M1 Garand]] rifle, [[World War II]] era, from US Army field manual]]\nHistorically, rifles only fired a single projectile with each squeeze of the trigger. Modern rifles are commonly classified as single shot, bolt action, semi-automatic, or automatic.  Single shot, bolt action, and semi-automatic rifles are limited by their designs to fire a single shot for each trigger pull.  Only automatic rifles are capable of firing more than one round per trigger squeeze; however, some automatic rifles are limited to fixed bursts of two, three, or more rounds per squeeze.  \n\nModern [[automatic rifle]]s overlap to some extent in design and function with [[machine gun]]s. In fact, many light machine guns (such as the Russian [[RPK]]) are adaptations of existing automatic rifle designs. A military's light machine guns are typically chambered for the same caliber ammunition as its service rifles. Generally, the difference between an automatic rifle and a machine gun comes down to weight, cooling system, and ammunition feed system.  Rifles, with their relatively lighter components (which overheat quickly) and smaller capacity [[Magazine (firearms)|magazines]], are incapable of sustained automatic fire in the way that machine guns are; they trade this capability in favor of increased mobility. Modern military rifles are fed by magazines, while machine guns are generally [[Belt (firearms)|belt-fed]]. Many machine guns allow the operator to quickly exchange barrels in order to prevent overheating, whereas rifles generally do not. Most machine guns fire from an open [[Bolt (firearms)|bolt]] in order to reduce the danger of \"cook-off\", while almost all rifles fire from a closed bolt for accuracy. Machine guns are often crewed by more than one soldier; the rifle is an individual weapon.\n\nThe term \"rifle\" is sometimes used to describe larger rifled [[crew-served weapon]]s firing explosive shells, for example, [[recoilless rifle]]s and [[naval rifle]]s.\n\nIn many works of fiction a rifle refers to any weapon that has a [[stock (firearm)|stock]] and is shouldered before firing, even if the weapon is not rifled or does not fire solid projectiles (e.g. a \"laser rifle\").\n\n==Historical overview==\n[[File:Marlin 35 rem 2.jpg|thumb|175px|right|Rifling in a [[.35 Remington]] microgroove rifled barrel]]\n[[File:Girdled bullet and twin rifle groove.jpg|thumb|175px|right|Girdled bullet and twin rifle groove of the [[Brunswick rifle]], mid-19th century]]\n\nThe origins of rifling are difficult to trace, but some of the earliest practical experiments seem to have occurred in Europe during the 15th century. [[Archery|Archers]] had long realized that a twist added to the tail feathers of their arrows gave them greater accuracy. Early muskets produced large quantities of smoke and soot, which had to be cleaned from the action and bore of the musket frequently, either through the action of repeated bore scrubbing, or a deliberate attempt to create \"soot grooves\" that would allow for more shots to be fired from the firearm. This might also have led to a perceived increase in accuracy, although no one knows for sure. True rifling dates from the mid-15th century,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} although military commanders preferred smooth bore weapons for [[infantry]] use because rifles were much more prone to problems due to powder fouling the barrel and because they took longer to reload and fire than muskets.{{citation needed|date = June 2015}}\n\nRifles were created as an improvement in the accuracy of smooth bore muskets. In the early 18th century, [[Benjamin Robins]], an English mathematician, realized that an elongated bullet would retain the momentum and kinetic energy of a musket ball, but would slice through the air with greater ease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=<!--No by-line.--> |date=April 1860 |title=The How and Why of Long Shots and Straight Shots |url=http://www.researchpress.co.uk/longrange/longshots.htm |publisher=[[Cornhill Magazine]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104021518/http://www.researchpress.co.uk/longrange/longshots.htm |archivedate=November 4, 2010}}</ref> The black powder used in early muzzle-loading rifles quickly fouled the barrel, making loading slower and more difficult. Their greater range was also considered to be of little practical use, since the smoke from black powder quickly obscured the battlefield and made it almost impossible to target the enemy from a distance. Since musketeers could not afford to take the time to stop and clean their barrels in the middle of a battle, rifles were limited to use by [[Marksman|sharpshooters]] and non-military uses like hunting.{{citation needed|date = June 2015}}\n\nMuskets were [[smoothbore]], large caliber weapons using ball-shaped ammunition fired at relatively low velocity. Due to the high cost and great difficulty of precision manufacturing, and the need to load readily from the muzzle, the musket ball was a loose fit in the barrel. Consequently, on firing the ball bounced off the sides of the barrel when fired and the final direction on leaving the muzzle was unpredictable.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe performance of early muskets defined the style of warfare at the time.  Due to the lack of accuracy, soldiers were deployed in long lines (thus [[Line infantry]]) to fire at the opposing forces. Precise aim was thus not necessary to hit an opponent. Muskets were used for comparatively rapid, imprecisely aimed volley fire, and the average soldier could be easily trained to use them.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn the [[History of Kentucky|territory of Kentucky]], one of the most successful early rifles, the [[long rifle]], was developed over the course of the 18th century. Compared to the more common [[Brown Bess]], they had a tighter bore, no room between bullet and barrel, and still used balls instead of conical bullets. The balls the long rifle used were smaller, allowing the production of more rounds for a given amount of lead. These rifles also had longer barrels, allowing more accuracy, which were rifled with a [[helix|helical]] groove. These first started appearing sometime before 1740, one early example being made by Jacob Dickert, a German immigrant. By 1850 there were a number of such manufacturers in the area. The longer barrel was a departure by local gunsmiths from their German roots, allowing frontiersmen to carry more rounds and bullets to achieve a higher speed (as the burning gunpowder was contained longer) before emerging from the barrel.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe rifle was used for precise shooting, aiming and firing at individual targets, instead of the musket's use for imprecise fire.<ref name=\"npr.org\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=98578531|title=Book Explores History Of The American Rifle|newspaper=NPR.org|access-date=2017-02-11|language=en}}</ref>\n\nBy the time of the [[American Revolutionary War]], these rifles were commonly used by frontiersmen, and Congress authorized the establishment of ten companies of riflemen. One of the most important units was [[Morgan's Riflemen]], led by [[Daniel Morgan]]. This sharpshooting unit eventually proved themselves integral to the [[Battle of Saratoga]], and in the southern states where General Morgan commanded as well. Aided by the rifle's improved accuracy, Morgan's sharpshooters would pick off cannoneers and officers, reducing the impact of enemy artillery.<ref>[http://www.revolutionarywararchives.org/longrifle.html Those Tall American Patriots and Their Long Rifles]</ref> This kind of advantage was considered pivotal in many battles, like [[The Battle of Cowpens]], [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]], and [[Battle of King's Mountain|King's Mountain]].<ref>[http://www.breathittcounty.com/01-08023.html A Short History Of The Kentucky Long Rifle]</ref>\n\nLater during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the British [[Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)|95th Regiment (Green Jackets)]] and [[60th Regiment of Foot|60th Regiment, (Royal American)]], as well as American sharpshooters and riflemen during the [[War of 1812]], used the rifle to great effect during skirmishing. Because of a slower loading time than a musket, they were not adopted by the whole army. Since rifles were used by sharpshooters who did not routinely fire over other men's shoulders, long length was not required to avoid the forward line. A shorter length made a handier weapon in which tight-fitting balls did not have to be rammed so far down the barrel.{{citation needed|date = June 2015}}\n\nThe invention of the [[minie balls]] in the 1840s solved the slow loading problem, and in the 1850s and 1860s rifles quickly replaced muskets on the battlefield. Many rifles, often referred to as [[rifled musket]]s, were very similar to the muskets they replaced, but the military also experimented with other designs. [[Breech-loading weapon]]s proved to have a much faster rate of fire than muzzleloaders, causing military forces to abandon muzzle loaders in favor of breech-loading designs in the late 1860s. In the later part of the 19th century, rifles were generally single-shot, breech-loading guns, designed for aimed, discretionary fire by individual soldiers. Then, as now, rifles had a stock, either fixed or folding, to be braced against the shoulder when firing.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe adoption of [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridges]] and breech-loading in the 19th century was concurrent with the general adoption of rifles. In the early part of the 20th century, soldiers were trained to shoot accurately over long ranges with high-powered cartridges. World War I [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] rifles (among others) were equipped with long-range 'volley sights' for massed firing at ranges of up to {{convert|1.6|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. Individual shots were unlikely to hit, but a platoon firing repeatedly could produce a 'beaten ground' effect similar to light artillery or machine guns.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\nCurrently, rifles are the most common firearm in general use for [[hunting]] purposes (with the exception of bird hunting, where [[shotguns]] are favored).

These Rifle Regiments were deployed as skirmishers during the Peninsular war in Spain and Portugal, and were more effective than skirmishers armed with muskets due to their accuracy and long range.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Muzzle-loading===\n{{Main article|Muzzle-loading rifle}} \n\nGradually, rifles appeared with cylindrical barrels cut with helical grooves, the surfaces between the grooves being \"lands\". The innovation shortly preceded the mass adoption of [[breech-loading weapon]]s, as it was not practical to push an overbore bullet down through a rifled barrel, only to then (try to) fire it back out. The dirt and grime from prior shots was pushed down ahead of a tight bullet or ball (which may have been a loose fit in the clean barrel before the first shot), and loading was far more difficult, as the lead had to be deformed to go down in the first place, reducing the accuracy due to deformation. Several systems were tried to deal with the problem, usually by resorting to an under-bore bullet that expanded upon firing.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\n[[File:Delvigne system.jpg|thumb|The method developed by [[Henri-Gustave Delvigne|Delvigne]] for his rifles, with the lead bullet being supported by a wooden sabot at its base.]]\n\nThe original muzzle-loading rifle, with a closely fitting ball to take the [[rifling]] grooves, was loaded with difficulty, particularly when foul, and for this reason was not generally used for military purposes. Even with the advent of rifling the bullet itself didn't change, but was wrapped in a greased, cloth patch to grip the rifling grooves.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe first half of the 19th century saw a distinct change in the shape and function of the bullet. In 1826 [[Henri-Gustave Delvigne|Delvigne]], a French [[infantry]] officer, invented a breech with abrupt shoulders on which a spherical bullet was rammed down until it caught the rifling grooves. Delvigne's method, however, deformed the bullet and was inaccurate.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\nSoon after, the [[Carabine \u00e0 tige]] was invented by [[Louis-Etienne de Thouvenin]], which provided for a stem at the bottom at the barrel that would deform and expand the base of the bullet when rammed, therefore enabling accurate contact with the rifling. However, the area around the stem would clog and get dirty easily.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\n====Mini\u00e9 system \u2013 the \"rifled musket\"====\n{{Main article|Mini\u00e9 ball|Mini\u00e9 rifle}}\n[[File:Japanese Minie rifle(Mirror).jpg|300px|thumb|French-made [[Mini\u00e9 rifle]] used in [[Japan]] during the [[Boshin war]] (1868\u20131869).]]\n\nOne of the most famous was the Mini\u00e9 system, invented by French Army Captain [[Claude-\u00c9tienne Mini\u00e9]], which relied on a conical bullet (known as a Mini\u00e9 ball) with a hollow skirt at the base of the bullet. When fired, the skirt would expand from the pressure of the exploding charge and grip the rifling as the round was fired. The better seal gave more power, as less gas escaped past the bullet, which combined with the fact that for the same [[gauge (bore diameter)|bore]] ([[caliber]]) diameter a long bullet was heavier than a round ball. The extra grip also spun the bullet more consistently, which increased the range from about 50 yards for a smooth bore musket to about 300 yards for a rifle using the Mini\u00e9 system. The expanding skirt of the Mini\u00e9 ball also solved the problem that earlier tight fitting bullets were difficult to load as black powder residue fouled the inside of the barrel. The Mini\u00e9 system allowed conical bullets to be loaded into rifles just as quickly as round balls in smooth bores, which allowed [[rifled musket|rifle muskets]] to replace muskets on the battlefield. Mini\u00e9 system rifles, notably the [[Springfield Model 1861|U.S. Springfield]] and the [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|British Enfield]] of the early 1860s, featured prominently in the [[U.S. Civil War]], due to their enhanced power and accuracy.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\nOver the 19th century, bullet design also evolved, the bullets becoming gradually smaller and lighter. By 1910 the standard blunt-nosed bullet had been replaced with the pointed, [[Spitzer (bullet)|'spitzer' bullet]], an innovation that increased range and penetration. [[Cartridge (weaponry)|Cartridge]] design evolved from simple paper tubes containing [[black powder]] and shot, to sealed brass cases with integral [[Primer (firearm)|primers]] for ignition, while black powder itself was replaced with [[cordite]], and then other nitro-cellulose-based [[smokeless powder]] mixtures, propelling bullets to higher velocities than before.<ref name=\"GlobalSecurity\">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/rifle-history.htm|title=Rifled Breech Loader|publisher=globalsecurity.org}}</ref>\n\nThe increased velocity meant that new problems arrived, and so bullets went from being soft lead to harder lead, then to [[full metal jacket bullet|copper-jacketed]], in order to better engage the spiraled grooves without \"stripping\" them in the same way that a screw or bolt thread would be stripped if subjected to extreme forces.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Breech loading===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{Main article|Breech-loading weapon}}\n[[File:Chassepot-p1000739.jpg|thumb|Loading mechanism of the [[Chassepot]]]]\n\nFrom 1836, breech-loading rifles were introduced with the German Dreyse [[Needle gun]], and followed by the French [[Tabati\u00e8re]] in 1857 the British Calisher and Terry carbine made in Birmingham and later in 1864 and the more well known British [[Snider\u2013Enfield]]. Primitive chamber-locking mechanisms were soon replaced by [[bolt-action]] mechanisms, exemplified by the [[Chassepot]] in 1866. Breech loading was to have a major impact on warfare, as breech-loading rifles can be fired at a rate many times higher than muzzle loaded rifles and significantly can be loaded from a prone rather than standing position. Firing prone (i.e., lying down) is more accurate than firing from a standing position, and a prone rifleman presents a much smaller target than a standing soldier. The higher accuracy and range, combined with reduced vulnerability generally benefited the defense while making the traditional battle between lines of standing and volleying infantry men obsolete.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Revolving rifle===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{Main article|Revolver#History}}\n[[File:Colt Roots British Carbine.JPG|thumb|300px|Colt Model 1855 Carbine]]\nRevolving rifles were an attempt to increase the rate of fire of rifles by combining them with the revolving firing mechanism that had been developed earlier for revolving pistols. Colt began experimenting with revolving rifles in the early 19th century, and other manufacturers like Remington later experimented with them as well. The [[Colt revolving rifle|Colt Revolving Rifle Model 1855]] was an early repeating rifle and the first one to be used by the U.S. Government, and saw some limited action during the [[American Civil War]]. Revolvers, both rifles and pistols, tend to spray fragments of metal from the front of the cylinder.\n\n=== Repeating rifle ===\nThe [[Winchester rifle|Winchester repeating rifle]] was invented in the mid-1800s. An operator pulled on a lever to reload the rifle with a stored cartridge.<ref name=\"npr.org\"/>\n\n===Cartridge storage===\nAn important area of development was the way that cartridges were stored and used in the weapon. The [[Spencer repeating rifle]] was a breech-loading manually operated [[lever action]] rifle that was adopted by the United States. Over 20,000 were used during the American Civil War. It marked the first adoption of a removable [[magazine (firearms)|magazine]]-fed infantry rifle by any country. The design was completed by [[Christopher Spencer]] in 1860.<ref>{{cite book|title=Almanac of American Military History| author= Spencer Tucker|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year= 2013|page= 1028 |isbn=1598845306}}</ref> It used copper [[rimfire ammunition|rimfire cartridges]] stored in a removable seven round tube magazine, enabling the rounds to be fired one after another.

However, following the advent of more powerful smokeless powder, a shorter barrel did not impair accuracy as much. As a result, cavalry saw limited, but noteworthy, usage in 20th century conflicts.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe advent of massed, rapid firepower of the [[machine gun]], [[submachine gun]] and the rifled [[artillery]] piece was so quick as to outstrip the development of any way to attack a [[Trench warfare|trench]] defended by riflemen and machine gunners. The carnage of [[World War I]] was perhaps the greatest vindication and vilification of the rifle as a military weapon.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe [[M1 Garand]] was a semi-automatic rapid-fire rifle developed for modern warfare use in [[World War II]].<ref name=\"npr.org\"/>\n\n[[File:Hunting rifle 02.png|thumb|300x300px|[[Remington Model 700]] in [[.30-06 Springfield]] with mounted [[telescopic sight]] and [[suppressor]]]]\n\nDuring and after [[World War II]] it became accepted that most infantry engagements occur at ranges of less than 300&nbsp;m; the range and power of the large full-powered rifle cartridges were \"overkill\"; and thus the weapons were heavier than ideal. This led to Germany's development of the [[7.92\u00d733mm|7.92\u00d733mm ''Kurz'']] (short) round, the [[Sturmgewehr 44|MKb-42]], and ultimately, the [[assault rifle]]. Today, an infantryman's rifle is optimized for ranges of 300&nbsp;m or less, and soldiers are trained to deliver individual rounds or bursts of fire within these distances. Typically, the application of accurate, long-range fire is the domain of the [[Designated marksman|marksman]] and the [[sniper]] in warfare, and of enthusiastic target shooters in peacetime. The modern [[marksman rifle]] and [[sniper rifle]] are usually capable of accuracy better than 0.3 [[Radian#Multiples of radian units|mrad]] at 100 yards (1 [[minute of arc|arcminute]]).{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\n==3D printed rifle==\n{{Main article|Grizzly (.22-caliber rifle)}}\n\nThe [[Grizzly (.22-caliber rifle)|Grizzly]] is a 3D printed .22-caliber rifle created around August 2013.<ref name=\"Gun-advocates-expect-flood-3D-printed-guns-result-U-S-law-changes--Canadian-designed-plastic-rifle-successfully-fires-14-rounds 2013\">[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2387624/Gun-advocates-expect-flood-3D-printed-guns-result-U-S-law-changes--Canadian-designed-plastic-rifle-successfully-fires-14-rounds.html 3D printed plastic rifle successfully fires 14 rounds \u2013 as gun advocates predict it will force changes in the law], DailyMail, 9 August 2013.

A youth rifle is often a single shot [[.22 caliber]] rifle, or a [[bolt action]] rifle, although some youth rifles are semi-automatic. They are usually very light, with a greatly shortened length of pull, which is necessary to accommodate children.  Youth stocks are available for many popular rifles, such as the [[Ruger 10/22]], a semi-automatic .22 LR rifle, allowing a youth rifle to be made from a standard rifle by simply changing the stock.  The typical ages of shooters for such rifles vary from about age 5 to 11 years old.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n==Technical aspects==\n\n===Rifling===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{Main article|Rifling}}\n\nThe usual form of rifling was helical grooves in a round bore.\n\nSome early rifled guns had barrels with a twisted polygonal bore. The [[Whitworth rifle]] was the first such type designed to spin the round for accuracy. Bullets for these guns were made to match the shape of the bore so the bullet would grip the rifle bore and take a spin that way. These were generally large caliber weapons and the ammunition still did not fit tightly in the barrel. Many different shapes and degrees of spiraling were used in experimental designs. One widely produced example was the Metford rifling in the Pattern 1888 [[Lee\u2013Metford]] service rifle. Although uncommon, [[polygonal rifling]] is still used in some weapons today, with one example being the [[Glock]] line of pistols (which fire standard bullets). Unfortunately, many of these early designs were prone to dangerous backfiring, which could lead to destruction of the weapon and serious injury to the person firing it.\n\n===Barrel wear===\n[[File:Benchrest mauser rifle.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Benchrest shooting]] with a Mauser rifle]]\n\nAs the bullet enters the barrel, it inserts itself into the rifling, a process that gradually wears down the barrel, and also causes the barrel to heat up more rapidly. Therefore, some [[machine gun]]s are equipped with quick-change barrels that can be swapped every few thousand rounds, or in earlier designs, were water-cooled. Unlike older carbon [[steel]] barrels, which were limited to around 1,000 shots before the extreme heat caused accuracy to fade, modern [[stainless steel]] barrels for target rifles are much more resistant to wear, allowing many thousands of rounds to be fired before accuracy drops. (Many shotguns and small arms have [[Chrome plating|chrome]]-lined barrels to reduce wear and enhance corrosion resistance. This is rare on rifles designed for extreme accuracy, as the plating process is difficult and liable to reduce the effect of the rifling.) Modern ammunition has a hardened lead core with a softer outer cladding or jacket, typically of an alloy of copper and nickel \u2013 [[cupro-nickel]]. Some ammunition is even coated with [[molybdenum disulfide]] to further reduce internal friction \u2013 the so-called 'moly-coated' bullet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.6mmbr.com/bulletcoating.html|title=GUIDE to Bullet Coating|website=www.6mmbr.com|access-date=2017-01-12}}</ref>\n\n===Rate of fire===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{Main article|Rate of fire}}\n\nRifles were initially single-shot, muzzle-loading weapons. During the 18th century, breech-loading weapons were designed, which allowed the rifleman to reload while under cover, but defects in manufacturing and the difficulty in forming a reliable gas-tight seal prevented widespread adoption. During the 19th century, multi-shot [[repeating rifle]]s using [[lever-action|lever]], [[pump-action|pump]] or linear [[bolt action]]s became standard, further increasing the rate of fire and minimizing the fuss involved in loading a firearm. The problem of proper seal creation had been solved with the use of brass cartridge cases, which expanded in an [[elastic (solid mechanics)|elastic]] fashion at the point of firing and effectively sealed the breech while the pressure remained high, then relaxed back enough to allow for easy removal. By the end of the 19th century, the leading bolt-action design was that of [[Paul Mauser]], whose action\u2014wedded to a reliable design possessing a five-shot magazine\u2014became a world standard through two world wars and beyond. The [[Mauser rifle]] was paralleled by Britain's ten-shot [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] and America's 1903 [[M1903 Springfield rifle|Springfield Rifle]] models. The American M1903 closely copied Mauser's original design.\n\n===Range===\nBarrel [[rifling]] dramatically increased the range and accuracy of the musket. Indeed, throughout its development, the rifle's history has been marked by increases in range and accuracy. From the [[Mini\u00e9 rifle]] and beyond, the rifle has become ever more potent at long range strikes.\n\nIn recent decades, large-caliber anti-materiel rifles, typically firing between 12.7&nbsp;mm and 20&nbsp;mm caliber cartridges, have been developed. The US [[M82 Barrett rifle|Barrett M82A1]] is probably the best-known such rifle. These weapons are typically used to strike critical, vulnerable targets such as computerized command and control vehicles, radio trucks, radar antennae, vehicle engine blocks and the jet engines of enemy aircraft. Anti-materiel rifles can be used against human targets, but the much higher weight of rifle and ammunition, and the massive recoil and muzzle blast, usually make them less than practical for such use. The Barrett M82 is designed with a maximum effective range of {{convert|1800|m|mi|abbr=on}}, although it has a confirmed kill distance of {{convert|2430|m|mi|abbr=on}} in [[Afghanistan]] during [[Operation Anaconda]] in 2002.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.macleans.ca/canada/national/article.jsp?content=20060515_126689_126689 | authorlink = Michael Friscolanti | last=Friscolanti|first=Michael|title=We were abandoned|journal=[[Maclean's]]|publisher=[[Rogers Communications|Rogers Publishing]]|date=2006-05-15|pages=18\u201325}}</ref> The [[longest recorded sniper kills|record for the longest confirmed kill shot]] stands at {{convert|3540|m|ft|abbr=on}}, set by an unnamed soldier with Canada's elite special operations unit [[Joint Task Force 2]] using a [[McMillan TAC-50]] sniper rifle.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/canadian-elite-special-forces-sniper-sets-record-breaking-kill-shot-in-iraq/article35415651/ |title=Canadian elite special forces sniper makes record-breaking kill shot in Iraq |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |first=Robert |last=Fife |date=June 21, 2017 |accessdate=February 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Bullet rotational speed (RPM)===\nBullets leaving a rifled barrel can spin at a [[rotational speed]] of over 100,000 revolutions per minute (rpm, or 1.67 kilohertz) depending on the muzzle velocity of the bullet and the [[Rifling#Twist rate|pitch]] of the rifling. The rotational speed of the bullet can be calculated by using the formula below. The formula divides the number of inches in a foot (12) by the rate of twist that the barrel has. This number is multiplied by the muzzle velocity (MV) and the number of seconds in a minute (60). For example, a bullet with a muzzle velocity of {{convert|3000|ft/s|m/s}} leaving a barrel that twists once per foot (1/12\") would rotate at 180,000rpm.<ref>{{cite web|title=Calculating Bullet RPM \u2014 Spin Rates and Stability|url=http://accurateshooter.wordpress.com/2008/06/03/calculating-bullet-rpm-spin-rates-and-stability/|work=AccurateShooter.com|accessdate=26 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n*MV / twist rate = rotational speed\n*MV (in fps) \u00d7 (12 in. /twist rate) \u00d7 60 s/min. = Bullet RPM\nExample using a barrel that has a twist rate of 1 turn in 8\" with a muzzle velocity of 3000&nbsp;ft/s:\n*3000 fps \u00d7 (12\"/(8\"/rotation)) \u00d7 60 s/min. = 270,000 RPM\nExcessive rotational speed can exceed the bullet's designed limits and the inadequate centripetal force will fail to keep the bullet from disintegrating in a radial fashion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Topic of the Month: July 2001 \u2013 Twist Rate |url=http://www.loadammo.com/Topics/July01.htm |work=Load From A Disk |accessdate=26 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512015023/http://www.loadammo.com/Topics/July01.htm |archivedate=12 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Caliber===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\nRifles may be chambered in a variety of calibers, from as low as [[.17 HMR|.17]] (4.4mm) [[Varmint rifle|varmint]] calibers to as high as [[20mm|.80 caliber]] in the case of the largest anti tank rifles. The term [[caliber]] essentially refers to the width of the bullet fired through a rifle's barrel. Armies have consistently attempted to find and procure the most lethal and accurate caliber for their firearms.\n\nThe standard calibers used by the world's militaries tend to follow worldwide trends. These trends have significantly changed during the centuries of firearm design and re-design. Muskets were normally chambered for large calibers, such as .50 or .59, with the theory that these large bullets caused the most damage.\n\nDuring World War I and II, most rifles were chambered in .30 caliber, a combination of power and speed. Examples would be the [[.303 British]] [[Lee\u2013Enfield]], the American [[M1903 Springfield|M1903]] [[.30-06 Springfield|.30-06]], and the German [[Karabiner 98k|8mm Mauser K98]].\n\nAn exception was the Italian [[Carcano|Modello 91]] rifle, which used the [[6.5\u00d752mm Mannlicher\u2013Carcano]] cartridge.\n\nDetailed study of infantry combat during and after WWII revealed that most small-arms engagements occurred within 100 meters, meaning that the power and range of the traditional .30-caliber weapons (designed for engagements at 500 meters and beyond) was essentially wasted. The single greatest predictor of an individual soldier's combat effectiveness was the number of rounds he fired. Weapons designers and strategists realized that service rifles firing smaller-caliber projectiles would allow troops to carry far more ammunition for the same weight. The lower recoil and more generous magazine capacities of small-caliber weapons also allows troops a much greater volume of fire, compared to historical [[battle rifles]]. Smaller, faster traveling, less stable projectiles have also demonstrated greater terminal ballistics and therein, a greater lethality than traditional .30-caliber rounds. Most modern service rifles fire a projectile of approximately 5.56mm. Examples of firearms in this range are the American [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO|5.56&nbsp;mm]] [[M16 rifle|M16]] and the Russian [[5.45\u00d739mm]] [[AK-74]].\n\n===Types of rifle===\n{{Prose|section|date=March 2018}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n====By mechanism====\n* [[Air gun]]\n** Spring-piston\n*** Break barrel\n*** Fixed barrel\n**** Underlever\n**** Sidelever\n**** Overlever\n** Pneumatic (internal pressure reservoir)\n*** Pump pneumatic, either single-stroke or multi-stroke\n*** Pre-charged pneumatic (PCP)\n** Compressed gas (external pressure reservoir)\n*** CO<sub>2</sub>\n*** High pressure air (HPA)\n* [[Firearm]]\n** [[Single-shot]]\n*** [[Muzzle-loading rifle]], some [[flintlock]] and mostly [[caplock]]\n*** [[Breech-loading weapon|Breech-loading rifle]]\n**** [[Breechblock]] rifle, either [[trapdoor mechanism|trapdoor]], [[rolling block|rolling]], [[falling block|dropping]], [[Single-shot#Tilting block actions|tilting]] or [[Ferguson rifle|screwed]]\n**** [[Break action|Break-action]] rifle\n**** [[Double rifle]] ([[List of multiple barrel firearms#Rifles|list]])\n** [[Repeating rifle|Repeating]]\n*** Manual\n**** [[Colt revolving rifle|Revolving rifle]]\n**** [[Lever-action rifle]], e.g. [[Winchester rifle]], [[Spencer rifle]]\n**** [[Pump action|Pump-action]] rifle, e.g. [[Colt Lightning Carbine]]\n**** [[Bolt action|Bolt-action rifle]]\n***** Turn-pull, e.g. [[Gewehr 98|Mauser G98]], [[Lee-Enfield]], [[Mosin-Nagant]]\n***** Straight-pull, e.g. [[Ross rifle]], [[K31]], [[Mannlicher M1895]], [[Blaser R93]]/[[Blaser R8|R8]]\n**** Bolt-release rifle, also known as lever-release rifle, e.g. [[Verney-Carron]] SpeedLine\n*** Self-loading\n**** [[Semi-automatic rifle]]\n**** [[Automatic rifle]]\n***** [[Selective-fire]] rifle\n{{col-2}}\n\n====By usage====\n*[[Military]] and [[law enforcement]]\n**[[Anti-materiel rifle]]\n**[[Anti-tank rifle]]\n**[[Long rifle]]\n**[[Personal defense weapon]]\n**Precision rifle\n***[[Designated marksman rifle]] \n***[[Sniper rifle]] ([[List of sniper rifles|list]])\n**[[Scout rifle]]\n**[[Service rifle]]\n***[[Assault rifle]] ([[List of assault rifles|list]])\n***[[Battle rifle]] ([[List of battle rifles|list]])\n***[[Carbine]] ([[List of carbines|list]])\n*[[Civilian]]\n**[[Hunting weapon#Rifles|Hunting rifle]]\n***[[Buffalo rifle]]\n***[[Elephant rifle]]\n***[[Express rifle]]\n**[[Shooting sport|Match/target]] rifle\n***[[Benchrest rifle]]\n**[[Modern sporting rifle]]\n**[[Short-barreled rifle]]\n**[[Varmint rifle]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=25em}}\n*[[Advanced Combat Rifle]]/[[Project Abakan]]\n*[[Antique firearms]]\n*[[British military rifles]]\n*[[Gun safety]]\n*[[Handgun]]\n*[[List of assault rifles]]\n*[[List of battle rifles]]\n*[[List of multiple-barrel firearms#Rifles|List of multiple barrel rifles]]\n*[[List of rifle cartridges]]\n*[[List of sniper rifles]]\n*[[Objective Individual Combat Weapon]]\n*[[Rifle grenade]]\n*[[Rifling]]\n*[[Service rifle]]\n*[[Shooting]]\n*[[Shooting at the Summer Olympics]]\n*[[Shooting range]]\n*[[Shooting sport]]\n*[[Shotgun]]\n*[[Telescopic sight]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|\nrefs=\n<ref name=MRJapan2006>{{cite book |last1=Honeycutt |first1=Fred L. |last2=Anthony |first2=F.

Since the 1960s, [[Native American self-determination]] movements have resulted in changes to the lives of Native Americans, though there are still many [[Contemporary Native American issues in the United States|contemporary issues faced by Native Americans]]. Today, there are over five million Native Americans in the United States, 78% of whom live outside reservations.\n\nWhen the United States was created, established Native American tribes were generally considered semi-independent nations, as they generally lived in communities separate from [[1820 Settlers|British settlers]]. The federal government signed treaties at a government-to-government level until the [[Indian Appropriations Act#1871|Indian Appropriations Act of 1871]] ended recognition of independent native nations, and started treating them as \"domestic dependent nations\" subject to federal law. This law did preserve the rights and privileges agreed to under the treaties, including a large degree of [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|tribal sovereignty]]. For this reason, many (but not all) Native American reservations are still independent of state law and actions of tribal citizens on these reservations are subject only to tribal courts and federal law.\n\nThe [[Indian Citizenship Act]] of 1924 granted U.S. citizenship to all Native Americans born in the United States who had not yet obtained it. This emptied the \"Indians not taxed\" category established by the [[United States Constitution]], allowed natives to vote in state and federal elections, and extended the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] protections granted to people \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the United States. However, some states continued to deny [[Native American civil rights#Voting|Native Americans voting rights]] for several decades. Bill of Rights protections do not apply to tribal governments, except for those mandated by the [[Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Background==\nSince the end of the 15th century, the [[migration of Europeans to the Americas]] has led to centuries of population, cultural, and agricultural transfer and adjustment between [[Old World|Old]] and [[New World]] societies, a process known as the [[Columbian exchange]]. As most Native American groups had historically preserved their histories by [[oral tradition]]s and artwork, the first written sources of the conflict were written by Europeans.<ref name=\"test\">Calloway, Colin G.

The ten cultural areas are as follows:\n\n* [[Circumpolar peoples|Arctic]], including [[Aleut people|Aleut]], [[Inuit]], and [[Yupik peoples]]\n* [[Alaska natives|Subarctic]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands|Northeastern Woodlands]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands|Southeastern Woodlands]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the Great Plains|Great Plains]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the Great Basin|Great Basin]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Plateau|Northwest Plateau]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|Northwest Coast]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of California|California]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the North American Southwest|Southwest]] ([[Oasisamerica]])\n\nAt the time of the first contact, the indigenous cultures were quite different from those of the proto-industrial and mostly [[Christianity|Christian]] immigrants. Some Northeastern and Southwestern cultures, in particular, were [[matrilineal]] and operated on a more collective basis than that with which Europeans were familiar. The majority of indigenous American tribes maintained their hunting grounds and agricultural lands for use of the entire tribe. Europeans at that time had [[patriarchal]] cultures and had developed concepts of individual [[property rights]] with respect to land that were extremely different. The differences in cultures between the established Native Americans and immigrant Europeans, as well as shifting alliances among different nations in times of war, caused extensive political tension, ethnic violence, and social disruption.\n\nEven before the European settlement of what is now the United States, Native Americans suffered high fatalities from [[Native American disease and epidemics|contact with new European diseases]], to which they had not yet acquired [[immunity (medical)|immunity]]; the diseases were endemic to the Spanish and other Europeans, and spread by direct contact and likely through pigs that escaped from expeditions.<ref name=\"mann\"/> [[Smallpox epidemics in the Americas|Smallpox epidemics]] are thought to have caused the greatest loss of life for indigenous populations. William M. Denevan, noted author and Professor Emeritus of Geography at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said on this subject in his essay \"The Pristine Myth: The Landscape of the Americas in 1492\"; \"The decline of native American populations was rapid and severe, probably the greatest demographic disaster ever.

During the 19th century, the ideology of [[manifest destiny]] became integral to the American nationalist movement. Expansion of European-American populations to the west after the American Revolution resulted in increasing pressure on Native American lands, warfare between the groups, and rising tensions. In 1830, the U.S. Congress passed the [[Indian Removal Act]], authorizing the government to relocate Native Americans from their homelands within established states to lands west of the [[Mississippi River]], accommodating European-American expansion.

The culture is identified by the distinctive [[Clovis point]], a flaked flint spear-point with a notched flute, by which it was inserted into a shaft.

The BIA by 1938 taught 30,000 students in 377 boarding and day schools, or 40% of all Indian children in school. The [[Navajo]] largely opposed schooling of any sort, but the other tribes accepted the system. There were now high schools on larger reservations, educating not only teenagers but also an adult audience.

White servicemen sometimes showed a lighthearted respect toward Native American comrades by calling them \"chief\". The resulting increase in contact with the world outside of the reservation system brought profound changes to Native American culture. \"The war\", said the U.S. Indian Commissioner in 1945, \"caused the greatest disruption of Native life since the beginning of the reservation era\", affecting the habits, views, and economic well-being of tribal members.<ref>Bernstein, p. 131</ref> The most significant of these changes was the opportunity\u2014as a result of wartime labor shortages\u2014to find well-paying work in cities, and many people relocated to urban areas, particularly on the West Coast with the buildup of the defense industry.\n\nThere were also losses as a result of the war. For instance, a total of 1,200 [[Pueblo Indians|Pueblo]] men served in World War II; only about half came home alive. In addition, many more [[Navajo people|Navajo]] served as [[code talker]]s for the military in the Pacific. The code they made, although [[cryptology|cryptologically]] very simple, was never cracked by the Japanese.\n\n====Self-determination====\n{{main|Native American self-determination|Native American civil rights}}\n\nMilitary service and urban residency contributed to the rise of American Indian activism, particularly after the 1960s and the [[occupation of Alcatraz Island]] (1969\u20131971) by a student Indian group from [[San Francisco]]. In the same period, the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM) was founded in [[Minneapolis]], and chapters were established throughout the country, where American Indians combined spiritual and political activism. Political protests gained national media attention and the sympathy of the American public.\n\nThrough the mid-1970s, conflicts between governments and Native Americans occasionally erupted into violence. A notable late 20th-century event was the [[Wounded Knee incident]] on the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]]. Upset with tribal government and the failures of the federal government to enforce treaty rights, about 300 [[Oglala Lakota]] and AIM activists took control of [[Wounded Knee, South Dakota|Wounded Knee]] on February 27, 1973.<ref name=\"Waldron\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/28/archives/shot-kills-indian-at-wounded-knee-another-insurgent-is-hurt-during.html |title=Shot Kills Indian At Wounded Knee |publisher=Select.nytimes.com |date= April 28, 1973|accessdate=August 22, 2010|first=Martin|last=Waldron}}</ref>\n\nIndian activists from around the country joined them at Pine Ridge, and the occupation became a symbol of rising American Indian identity and power. Federal law enforcement officials and the national guard cordoned off the town, and the two sides had a standoff for 71 days. During much gunfire, one [[United States Marshal]] was wounded and paralyzed. In late April, a Cherokee and local Lakota man were killed by gunfire; the Lakota elders ended the occupation to ensure no more lives were lost.<ref name=\"Waldron\"/>\n\nIn June 1975, two FBI agents seeking to make an armed robbery arrest at Pine Ridge Reservation were wounded in a firefight, and killed at close range.

This gave tribal members most of the protections against abuses by tribal governments that the Bill of Rights accords to all U.S. citizens with respect to the federal government.<ref>Robert J. McCarthy, Civil Rights in Tribal Courts; The Indian Bill of Rights at 30 Years, 34 IDAHO LAW REVIEW 465 (1998).</ref> In 1975, the U.S. government passed the [[Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act]], marking the culmination of fifteen years of policy changes. It resulted from American Indian activism, the Civil Rights Movement, and community development aspects of President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s social programs of the 1960s. The Act recognized the right and need of Native Americans for self-determination. It marked the U.S. government's turn away from the 1950s policy of termination of the relationship between tribes and the government. The U.S. government encouraged Native Americans' efforts at self-government and determining their futures. Tribes have developed organizations to administer their own social, welfare and housing programs, for instance. Tribal self-determination has created tension with respect to the federal government's historic trust obligation to care for Indians; however, the Bureau of Indian Affairs has never lived up to that responsibility.<ref>Robert J.

Until 2017 Virginia previously had no federally recognized tribes but the state had recognized eight. This is related historically to the greater impact of disease and warfare on the Virginia Indian populations, as well as their intermarriage with Europeans and Africans. Some people confused the ancestry with culture, but groups of Virginia Indians maintained their cultural continuity. Most of their early reservations were ended under the pressure of early European settlement.\n\nSome historians also note the problems of Virginia Indians in establishing documented continuity of identity, due to the work of [[Walter Ashby Plecker]] (1912\u20131946). As registrar of the state's Bureau of Vital Statistics, he applied his own interpretation of the [[one-drop rule]], enacted in law in 1924 as the state's Racial Integrity Act. It recognized only two races: \"white\" and \"colored\".\n\nPlecker, a [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregationist]], believed that the state's Native Americans had been \"mongrelized\" by intermarriage with [[African American]]s; to him, ancestry determined identity, rather than culture. He thought that some people of partial black ancestry were trying to \"[[passing (racial identity)|pass]]\" as Native Americans. Plecker thought that anyone with any African heritage had to be classified as colored, regardless of appearance, amount of European or Native American ancestry, and cultural/community identification. Plecker pressured local governments into reclassifying all Native Americans in the state as \"colored\", and gave them lists of family surnames to examine for reclassification based on his interpretation of data and the law. This led to the state's destruction of accurate records related to families and communities who identified as Native American (as in church records and daily life). By his actions, sometimes different members of the same family were split by being classified as \"white\" or \"colored\". He did not allow people to enter their primary identification as Native American in state records.<ref name=\"home.hamptonroads.com\">{{cite web |url=http://home.hamptonroads.com/stories/story.cfm?story=74481&ran=162825 |website=Pilotonline.com |title=The black-and-white world of Walter Ashby Plecker |accessdate=February 8, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103123937/http://home.hamptonroads.com/stories/story.cfm?story=74481&ran=162825 |archivedate=January 3, 2006 |df= }}</ref> In 2009, the [[Senate Indian Affairs Committee]] endorsed a bill that would grant federal recognition to tribes in Virginia.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www2.timesdispatch.com/rtd/news/state_regional/state_regional_govtpolitics/article/INDI23_20091022-223007/301146//|title = Virginia tribes take another step on road to federal recognition|url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://archive.today/20091026175747/http://www2.timesdispatch.com/rtd/news/state_regional/state_regional_govtpolitics/article/INDI23_20091022-223007/301146/|archivedate = October 26, 2009|date = October 23, 2009|website = Richmond Times-Dispatch|df = }}</ref>\n\nTo achieve federal recognition and its benefits, tribes must prove continuous existence since 1900.

Watercolor by John White, 1585]]\nNative Americans have been depicted by [[List of American artists|American artists]] in various ways at different periods. A number of 19th- and 20th-century United States and Canadian painters, often motivated by a desire to document and preserve Native culture, specialized in Native American subjects. Among the most prominent of these were [[Elbridge Ayer Burbank]], [[George Catlin]], [[Seth and Mary Eastman|Seth Eastman]], [[Paul Kane]], [[W. Langdon Kihn]], [[Charles Bird King]], [[Joseph Henry Sharp]], and [[John Mix Stanley]].\n\nIn the 20th century, early portrayals of Native Americans in [[movies]] and [[television]] roles were first performed by European Americans dressed in mock traditional attire. Examples included ''The Last of the Mohicans'' (1920), ''Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans'' (1957), and ''[[F Troop]]'' (1965\u201367). In later decades, Native American actors such as [[Jay Silverheels]] in ''[[The Lone Ranger#Television series|The Lone Ranger]]'' television series (1949\u201357) came to prominence. Roles of Native Americans were limited and not reflective of Native American culture. By the 1970s some Native American film roles began to show more complexity, such as those in ''[[Little Big Man (film)|Little Big Man]]'' (1970), ''[[Billy Jack]]'' (1971), and ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' (1976), which depicted Native Americans in minor supporting roles.\n\nFor years, Native people on U.S. television were relegated to secondary, subordinate roles. During the years of the series ''[[Bonanza]]'' (1959\u20131973), no major or secondary Native characters appeared on a consistent basis. The series ''[[The Lone Ranger]]'' (1949\u20131957), ''[[Cheyenne (1955 TV series)|Cheyenne]]'' (1955\u20131963), and ''[[Law of the Plainsman]]'' (1959\u20131963) had Native characters who were essentially aides to the central white characters. This continued in such series as ''[[How the West Was Won (TV series)|How the West Was Won]]''. These programs resembled the \"sympathetic\" yet contradictory film ''[[Dances With Wolves]]'' of 1990, in which, according to Ella Shohat and Robert Stam, the narrative choice was to relate the Lakota story as told through a Euro-American voice, for wider impact among a general audience.<ref>Shohat, Ella, and Stam, Robert. ''Unthinking Eurocentrism: Multiculturalism and the Media''. New York: Routledge, 1994.</ref>\nLike the 1992 remake of ''[[The Last of the Mohicans (1992 film)|The Last of the Mohicans]]'' and ''[[Geronimo: An American Legend]]'' (1993), ''Dances with Wolves'' employed a number of Native American actors, and made an effort to portray Indigenous languages.\n\nIn 2009 ''[[We Shall Remain (documentary)|We Shall Remain]]'' (2009), a television documentary by [[Ric Burns]] and part of the ''[[American Experience]]'' series, presented a five-episode series \"from a Native American perspective\". It represented \"an unprecedented collaboration between Native and non-Native filmmakers and involves Native advisors and scholars at all levels of the project\".<ref>{{Cite news |title=About the Project: We Shall Remain|url =https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/weshallremain/the_films/about |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}</ref> The five episodes explore the impact of [[King Philip's War]] on the northeastern tribes, the \"Native American confederacy\" of [[Tecumseh's War]], the U.S.-forced relocation of Southeastern tribes known as the [[Trail of Tears]], the pursuit and capture of [[Geronimo]] and the [[Apache Wars]], and concludes with the [[Wounded Knee incident]], participation by the [[American Indian Movement]], and the increasing resurgence of modern Native cultures since.\n\n===Terminology differences===\n{{further|Native American name controversy}}\n\n====Common usage in the United States====\nNative Americans are often known as Indians or American Indians. The term ''Native American'' was introduced in the United States in preference to the older term ''Indian'' to distinguish the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] from the people of [[India]] and to avoid negative stereotypes associated with the term ''Indian''. In 1995, a plurality of indigenous Americans, however, preferred the term ''American Indian''<ref name=\"Census\">{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0762158.html |website=Infoplease |title=Preference for Racial or Ethnic Terminology |accessdate=February 8, 2006}}</ref> and many [[List of federally recognized tribes|tribes]] include the word Indian in their formal title.\n\nCriticism of the [[neologism]] ''Native American'' comes from diverse sources. [[Russell Means]], an American Indian activist, opposed the term ''Native American'' because he believed it was imposed by the government without the consent of American Indians. He has also argued that the use of the word ''Indian'' derives not from a confusion with India but from a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] expression ''en Dios'' meaning \"in God\"<ref>Russell Means: \"I am an American Indian, not a native American!\" (Treaty Productions, 1996); citation given here [http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nc-american-indians/5526] and here [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/roadshow/fts/bismarck_200504A16.html] and they cover the general subject and some Means' contribution, but have no reference to \"En Di\u00f3s\" and only those non-working links to text.</ref>{{verify source|date=June 2018}} (and a near-[[homophone]] of the Spanish word for \"Indians\", ''indios'').\n\nA 1995 U.S. Census Bureau survey found that more Native Americans in the United States preferred ''American Indian'' to ''Native American''.<ref name=\"Census\" /> Most American Indians are comfortable with ''Indian'', ''American Indian'', and ''Native American'', and the terms are often used interchangeably.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/aihmterms.html |website=Infoplease |title=''American Indian'' versus ''Native American'' |accessdate=February 8, 2006}}</ref> The traditional term is reflected in the name chosen for the [[National Museum of the American Indian]], which opened in 2004 on [[The Mall (Washington, DC)|the Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\n===Gambling industry===\n[[File:Sandia Casino, detail.jpg|thumb|Sandia Casino, owned by the [[Sandia Pueblo]] of [[New Mexico]]]]\n{{Main|Native American gaming}}\n[[Gambling]] has become a leading industry.

Some tribes, such as the [[Winnemem Wintu]] of [[Redding, California]], feel that casinos and their proceeds destroy culture from the inside out. These tribes refuse to participate in the gambling industry.\n\n===Financial services===\nNumerous tribes around the country have entered the financial services market including the [[Otoe-Missouria]], [[Tunica-Biloxi]], and the [[Rosebud Indian Reservation|Rosebud Sioux]]. Because of the challenges involved in starting a financial services business from scratch, many tribes hire outside consultants and vendors to help them launch these businesses and manage the regulatory issues involved.\nSimilar to the tribal sovereignty debates that occurred when tribes first entered the gaming industry, the tribes, states, and federal government are currently in disagreement regarding who possesses the authority to regulate these e-commerce business entities.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Online Sovereignty: The Law and Economics of Tribal Electronic Commerce|ssrn=2740181|journal=Vanderbilt Journal of Entertainment & Technology Law|date=March 2016|last1=Claw|first1=Carma|last2=Spilde|first2=Katherine A.|author2-link=Katherine Spilde|last3=Clarkson|first3=Esq}}</ref>\n\n===Crime on reservations===\nProsecution of serious crime, historically endemic on reservations,<ref name=DOJStat>{{cite web|title=A BJS Statistical Profile, 1992\u20132002 American Indians and Crime|url=http://www.justice.gov/otj/pdf/american_indians_and_crime.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice Office of Justice Programs|accessdate=June 2, 2012|author=Steven W.

Fractionalization occurs when a landowner dies, and their land is inherited by their children, but not subdivided. This means that one parcel might be owned by 50 different individuals. A majority of those holding interest must agree to any proposal to develop the land, and establishing this consent is time-consuming, cumbersome, and sometimes impossible.\nAnother landownership issue on reservations is checkerboarding, where Tribal land is interspersed with land owned by the federal government on behalf of Native's, individually owned plots, and land owned by non-Native individuals. This prevents Tribal governments to secure plots of land large enough for economic development or agricultural uses.<ref>https://www.frbsf.org/community-development/files/Community-Investments-Fall-2013-Native-Communities.pdf</ref>\nBecause reservation land is owned \u201cin trust\u201d by the federal government, individuals living on reservations cannot build equity in their homes. This bars Native Americans from getting a loan, as there is nothing that a bank can collect if the loan is not paid. Past efforts to encourage landownership (such as the Dawes Act) resulted in a net loss of Tribal land. After they were familiarized with their [[Smallholding|smallholder status]], Native American landowners were lifted of trust restrictions and their land would get transferred back to them, contingent of a transactional fee to the federal government. The transfer fee discouraged Native American land ownership, with 65% of tribal owned land being sold to non-Native Americans by the 1920s.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Van Winkle|first=Tony N.|date=Fall 2018|title=American Indian Landowners, Leasemen, and Bureaucrats: Property, Paper, and the Poli-Technics of Dispossession in Southwestern Oklahoma|url=|journal=American Indian Quarterly|volume=42|issue=4|pages=508\u2013533|doi=10.5250/amerindiquar.42.4.0508}}</ref> Activists against property rights point to historical evidence of communal ownership of land and resources by tribes.

The '''Columbian exchange''', also known as the '''Columbian interchange''', was the widespread transfer of plants, animals, culture, human populations, technology, and ideas between the [[Americas]] and the [[Old World]] in the 15th and 16th centuries, following [[Christopher Columbus]]'s [[voyages of Christopher Columbus#First voyage|1492 voyage]].<ref name = \"history\">{{cite journal |last1= Nunn |first1= Nathan |last2= Qian |first2= Nancy |year= 2010 |title= The Columbian Exchange: A History of Disease, Food, and Ideas |journal= [[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume= 24 |issue= 2 |pages= 163\u2013188 |jstor= 25703506 |doi= 10.1257/jep.24.2.163 |url= http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:11986330 |citeseerx= 10.1.1.232.9242 }}</ref> The Columbian exchange generally had a destructive impact on Native American culture through disease, and a 'clash of cultures',<ref>Emmer, Pieter. \"The Myth of Early Globalization: The Atlantic Economy, 1500\u20131800.\" European Review 11, no. 1.

Feb. 2003. p. 46</ref>\n\nThe impact of the Columbian exchange was not entirely negative however. For example, the re-introduction of the horse to North America allowed the [[Plains Indian]] to revolutionize their way of life by making hunting, trading, and warfare far more effective, and to greatly improve their ability to transport possessions and move their settlements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.na.038|title=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains \u2013 HORSE|website=plainshumanities.unl.edu}}</ref>\n\nThe Great Plains tribes were still hunting the bison when they first encountered the Europeans. The Spanish reintroduction of the horse to North America in the 17th century and Native Americans' learning to use them greatly altered the Native Americans' culture, including changing the way in which they hunted large game. Horses became such a valuable, central element of Native lives that they were counted as a measure of wealth.\n\nIn the early years, as these native peoples encountered European explorers and settlers and engaged in trade, they exchanged food, crafts, and furs for blankets, iron and steel implements, horses, trinkets, firearms, and alcoholic beverages.\n\n===Ethno-linguistic classification===\n[[File:Langs N.Amer.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Pre-contact: distribution of North American language families, including northern Mexico]]\n{{Main|Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous languages of the Americas|}}\n\nThe [[Na-Den\u00e9 languages|Na-Den\u00e9]], [[Algic languages|Algic]], and [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]] families are the largest in terms of number of languages.

Na-Den\u00e9 and Algic have the widest geographic distributions: Algic currently spans from northeastern Canada across much of the continent down to northeastern Mexico (due to later migrations of the [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]]) with two outliers in [[California]] ([[Yurok language|Yurok]] and [[Wiyot language|Wiyot]]); Na-Den\u00e9 spans from Alaska and western Canada through [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], and California to the [[Southwestern United States|U.S. Southwest]] and northern Mexico (with one outlier in the Plains). Several families consist of only 2 or 3 languages. Demonstrating genetic relationships has proved difficult due to the great linguistic diversity present in North America. Two large (super-) family proposals, [[Penutian languages|Penutian]] and [[Hokan languages|Hokan]], look particularly promising.

Native farmers practiced [[Polyculture|polycropping]] maize, beans, and squash; these crops are known as the [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|Three Sisters]]. The beans would replace the [[nitrogen]], which the maize leached from the ground, as well as using corn stalks for support for climbing.\n\nThe [[Gender roles in agriculture|agriculture gender roles]] of the Native Americans varied from region to region.

Clearing the land was an immense chore since the Native Americans rotated fields.\n\n[[Europeans]] in the eastern part of the continent observed that Native Americans cleared large areas for cropland.

If a couple separates or the man dies, the woman has her family to assist her. In matrilineal cultures the mother's brothers are usually the leading male figures in her children's lives; fathers have no standing in their wife and children's clan, as they still belong to their own mother's clan. Hereditary clan chief positions pass through the mother's line and chiefs have historically been selected on recommendation of women elders, who could also disapprove of a chief.<ref name=Thomas/>\n\nIn the [[patrilineal]] tribes, such as the [[Omaha]], [[Osage Nation|Osage]], [[Ponca]], and [[Lakota people|Lakota]], hereditary leadership passes through the male line, and children are considered to belong to the father and his [[clan]].

Native Americans began selling war captives to Europeans rather than integrating them into their own societies as they had done before. As the demand for labor in the [[West Indies]] grew with the cultivation of [[sugar cane]], Europeans enslaved Native Americans for the [[Thirteen Colonies]], and some were exported to the \"sugar islands\". The British settlers, especially those in the southern colonies, purchased or captured Native Americans to use as forced labor in cultivating tobacco, rice, and indigo.

It gave rise to a series of devastating wars among the tribes, including the [[Yamasee War]]. The [[Indian Wars]] of the early 18th century, combined with the increasing importation of African slaves, effectively ended the Native American slave trade by 1750. Colonists found that Native American slaves could easily escape, as they knew the country. The wars cost the lives of numerous colonial slave traders and disrupted their early societies. The remaining Native American groups banded together to face the Europeans from a position of strength. Many surviving Native American peoples of the southeast strengthened their loose coalitions of language groups and joined confederacies such as the [[Choctaw]], the [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creek]], and the [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]] for protection.

Such captives were from rival tribes and later were taken from raids on European settlements. Some tribes also sheltered or adopted white traders and runaway slaves, and others owned slaves of their own. Tribes with long trading histories with Europeans show a higher rate of European admixture, reflecting years of intermarriage between Native American women and European men, often seen as advantageous to both sides.<ref name=\"eurekalert.org\"/> A number of paths to genetic and ethnic diversity among Native Americans have occurred.\n\nIn recent years, genetic genealogists have been able to determine the proportion of Native American ancestry carried by the African-American population. The literary and history scholar [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]], had experts on his TV programs who discussed African-American ancestry. They stated that 5% of African Americans have at least 12.5% Native American ancestry, or the equivalent to one great-grandparent, which may represent more than one distant ancestor. A greater percentage could have a smaller proportion of Indian ancestry, but their conclusions show that popular estimates of Native American admixture may have been too high.<ref>Henry Louis Gates, Jr., ''In Search of Our Roots: How 19 Extraordinary African Americans Reclaimed Their Past'', New York: Crown Publishers, 2009, pp. 20\u201321.</ref> More recent genetic testing research of 2015, have found varied ancestries which show different tendencies by region and sex of ancestors.

Each tribal government makes its own rules for eligibility of citizens or tribal members. Among tribes, qualification for enrollment may be based upon a required percentage of Native American \"blood\" (or the \"[[Blood quantum laws|blood quantum]]\") of an individual seeking recognition, or documented descent from an ancestor on the [[Dawes Rolls]] or other registers. But, the federal government has its own standards related to who qualifies for services available to certified Native Americans. For instance, federal scholarships for Native Americans require the student both to be enrolled in a federally recognized tribe ''and'' to be of at least one-quarter Native American descent (equivalent to one grandparent), attested to by a [[Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood]] (CDIB) card issued by the federal government.\n\nSome tribes have begun requiring [[genealogical DNA test]]ing of individuals' applying for membership, but this is usually related to an individual's proving parentage or direct descent from a certified member.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kaplan |first1=Karen |title=Ancestry in a Drop of Blood |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/aug/30/science/sci-indiandna30 |accessdate=October 17, 2018 |work=LA TImes |date=August 30, 2005}}</ref> Requirements for tribal membership vary widely by tribe. The Cherokee require documented direct genealogical descent from a Native American listed on the early 1906 [[Dawes Rolls]]. Tribal rules regarding recognition of members who have heritage from multiple tribes are equally diverse and complex.\n\nTribal membership conflicts have led to a number of legal disputes, court cases, and the formation of activist groups. One example of this are the [[Cherokee Freedmen]]. Today, they include descendants of African Americans once enslaved by the Cherokees, who were granted, by federal treaty, citizenship in the [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|historic Cherokee Nation]] as freedmen after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The [[Cherokee Nation|modern Cherokee Nation]], in the early 1980s, passed a law to require that all members must prove descent from a Cherokee Native American (not Cherokee Freedmen) listed on the Dawes Rolls, resulting in the exclusion of some individuals and families who had been active in Cherokee culture for years.\n\n===Increased self-identification===\nSince the census of 2000, people may identify as being of more than one race.<ref name=\"2010 Census AMAN\" /> Since the 1960s, the number of people claiming Native American ancestry has grown significantly and by the 2000 census, the number had more than doubled. Sociologists attribute this dramatic change to \"ethnic shifting\" or \"ethnic shopping\"; they believe that it reflects a willingness of people to question their birth identities and adopt new ethnicities which they find more compatible.\n\nThe author [[Jack Hitt]] writes:\n\n{{quote|The reaction from lifelong Indians runs the gamut. It is easy to find Native Americans who denounce many of these new Indians as members of the wannabe tribe. But it is also easy to find Indians like Clem Iron Wing, an elder among the [[Lakota people|Lakota]], who sees this flood of new ethnic claims as magnificent, a surge of Indians 'trying to come home.' Those Indians who ridicule Iron Wing's lax sense of tribal membership have retrofitted the old genocidal system of blood quantum\u2014measuring racial purity by blood\u2014into the new standard for real Indianness, a choice rich with paradox.<ref name=\"Newest Indians\"/>}}\n\nThe journalist Mary Annette Pember notes that identifying with Native American culture may be a result of a person's increased interest in [[genealogy]], the romanticization of the lifestyle, and a family tradition of Native American ancestors in the distant past. There are different issues if a person wants to pursue enrollment as a member of a tribe. Different tribes have different requirements for tribal membership; in some cases persons are reluctant to enroll, seeing it as a method of control initiated by the federal government; and there are individuals who are 100% Native American but, because of their mixed tribal heritage, do not qualify to belong to any individual tribe. Pember concludes:\n\n{{quote|The subjects of genuine American Indian blood, cultural connection and recognition by the community are extremely contentious issues, hotly debated throughout Indian country and beyond.

Since the 1960s, [[Native American self-determination]] movements have resulted in changes to the lives of Native Americans, though there are still many [[Contemporary Native American issues in the United States|contemporary issues faced by Native Americans]]. Today, there are over five million Native Americans in the United States, 78% of whom live outside reservations.\n\nWhen the United States was created, established Native American tribes were generally considered semi-independent nations, as they generally lived in communities separate from [[1820 Settlers|British settlers]]. The federal government signed treaties at a government-to-government level until the [[Indian Appropriations Act#1871|Indian Appropriations Act of 1871]] ended recognition of independent native nations, and started treating them as \"domestic dependent nations\" subject to federal law. This law did preserve the rights and privileges agreed to under the treaties, including a large degree of [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|tribal sovereignty]]. For this reason, many (but not all) Native American reservations are still independent of state law and actions of tribal citizens on these reservations are subject only to tribal courts and federal law.\n\nThe [[Indian Citizenship Act]] of 1924 granted U.S. citizenship to all Native Americans born in the United States who had not yet obtained it. This emptied the \"Indians not taxed\" category established by the [[United States Constitution]], allowed natives to vote in state and federal elections, and extended the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] protections granted to people \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the United States. However, some states continued to deny [[Native American civil rights#Voting|Native Americans voting rights]] for several decades. Bill of Rights protections do not apply to tribal governments, except for those mandated by the [[Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Background==\nSince the end of the 15th century, the [[migration of Europeans to the Americas]] has led to centuries of population, cultural, and agricultural transfer and adjustment between [[Old World|Old]] and [[New World]] societies, a process known as the [[Columbian exchange]]. As most Native American groups had historically preserved their histories by [[oral tradition]]s and artwork, the first written sources of the conflict were written by Europeans.<ref name=\"test\">Calloway, Colin G.

The ten cultural areas are as follows:\n\n* [[Circumpolar peoples|Arctic]], including [[Aleut people|Aleut]], [[Inuit]], and [[Yupik peoples]]\n* [[Alaska natives|Subarctic]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands|Northeastern Woodlands]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands|Southeastern Woodlands]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the Great Plains|Great Plains]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the Great Basin|Great Basin]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Plateau|Northwest Plateau]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|Northwest Coast]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of California|California]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the North American Southwest|Southwest]] ([[Oasisamerica]])\n\nAt the time of the first contact, the indigenous cultures were quite different from those of the proto-industrial and mostly [[Christianity|Christian]] immigrants. Some Northeastern and Southwestern cultures, in particular, were [[matrilineal]] and operated on a more collective basis than that with which Europeans were familiar. The majority of indigenous American tribes maintained their hunting grounds and agricultural lands for use of the entire tribe. Europeans at that time had [[patriarchal]] cultures and had developed concepts of individual [[property rights]] with respect to land that were extremely different. The differences in cultures between the established Native Americans and immigrant Europeans, as well as shifting alliances among different nations in times of war, caused extensive political tension, ethnic violence, and social disruption.\n\nEven before the European settlement of what is now the United States, Native Americans suffered high fatalities from [[Native American disease and epidemics|contact with new European diseases]], to which they had not yet acquired [[immunity (medical)|immunity]]; the diseases were endemic to the Spanish and other Europeans, and spread by direct contact and likely through pigs that escaped from expeditions.<ref name=\"mann\"/> [[Smallpox epidemics in the Americas|Smallpox epidemics]] are thought to have caused the greatest loss of life for indigenous populations. William M. Denevan, noted author and Professor Emeritus of Geography at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said on this subject in his essay \"The Pristine Myth: The Landscape of the Americas in 1492\"; \"The decline of native American populations was rapid and severe, probably the greatest demographic disaster ever.

During the 19th century, the ideology of [[manifest destiny]] became integral to the American nationalist movement. Expansion of European-American populations to the west after the American Revolution resulted in increasing pressure on Native American lands, warfare between the groups, and rising tensions. In 1830, the U.S. Congress passed the [[Indian Removal Act]], authorizing the government to relocate Native Americans from their homelands within established states to lands west of the [[Mississippi River]], accommodating European-American expansion.

Artifacts from this culture were first excavated in 1932 near [[Clovis, New Mexico]]. The Clovis culture ranged over much of North America and also appeared in South America. The culture is identified by the distinctive [[Clovis point]], a flaked flint spear-point with a notched flute, by which it was inserted into a shaft. Dating of Clovis materials has been by association with animal bones and by the use of [[carbon dating]] methods. Recent reexaminations of Clovis materials using improved carbon-dating methods produced results of 11,050 and 10,800 radiocarbon years [[Before Present|B.P.]] (roughly 9100 to 8850&nbsp;BCE).<ref name=\"RobinsonSellet2017\">{{cite book|author1=Erick Robinson|author2=Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Sellet|title=Lithic Technological Organization and Paleoenvironmental Change: Global and Diachronic Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nO09DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA266|year=2017|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=978-3-319-64407-3|page=266}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Folsom point.png|thumb|upright=0.9|A [[Folsom point]] for a spear]]\nThe [[Folsom Tradition]] was characterized by the use of [[Folsom point]]s as projectile tips and activities known from kill sites, where slaughter and butchering of [[bison]] took place.

White servicemen sometimes showed a lighthearted respect toward Native American comrades by calling them \"chief\". The resulting increase in contact with the world outside of the reservation system brought profound changes to Native American culture. \"The war\", said the U.S. Indian Commissioner in 1945, \"caused the greatest disruption of Native life since the beginning of the reservation era\", affecting the habits, views, and economic well-being of tribal members.<ref>Bernstein, p. 131</ref> The most significant of these changes was the opportunity\u2014as a result of wartime labor shortages\u2014to find well-paying work in cities, and many people relocated to urban areas, particularly on the West Coast with the buildup of the defense industry.\n\nThere were also losses as a result of the war. For instance, a total of 1,200 [[Pueblo Indians|Pueblo]] men served in World War II; only about half came home alive. In addition, many more [[Navajo people|Navajo]] served as [[code talker]]s for the military in the Pacific. The code they made, although [[cryptology|cryptologically]] very simple, was never cracked by the Japanese.\n\n====Self-determination====\n{{main|Native American self-determination|Native American civil rights}}\n\nMilitary service and urban residency contributed to the rise of American Indian activism, particularly after the 1960s and the [[occupation of Alcatraz Island]] (1969\u20131971) by a student Indian group from [[San Francisco]]. In the same period, the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM) was founded in [[Minneapolis]], and chapters were established throughout the country, where American Indians combined spiritual and political activism. Political protests gained national media attention and the sympathy of the American public.\n\nThrough the mid-1970s, conflicts between governments and Native Americans occasionally erupted into violence. A notable late 20th-century event was the [[Wounded Knee incident]] on the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]]. Upset with tribal government and the failures of the federal government to enforce treaty rights, about 300 [[Oglala Lakota]] and AIM activists took control of [[Wounded Knee, South Dakota|Wounded Knee]] on February 27, 1973.<ref name=\"Waldron\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/28/archives/shot-kills-indian-at-wounded-knee-another-insurgent-is-hurt-during.html |title=Shot Kills Indian At Wounded Knee |publisher=Select.nytimes.com |date= April 28, 1973|accessdate=August 22, 2010|first=Martin|last=Waldron}}</ref>\n\nIndian activists from around the country joined them at Pine Ridge, and the occupation became a symbol of rising American Indian identity and power. Federal law enforcement officials and the national guard cordoned off the town, and the two sides had a standoff for 71 days. During much gunfire, one [[United States Marshal]] was wounded and paralyzed. In late April, a Cherokee and local Lakota man were killed by gunfire; the Lakota elders ended the occupation to ensure no more lives were lost.<ref name=\"Waldron\"/>\n\nIn June 1975, two FBI agents seeking to make an armed robbery arrest at Pine Ridge Reservation were wounded in a firefight, and killed at close range.

This gave tribal members most of the protections against abuses by tribal governments that the Bill of Rights accords to all U.S. citizens with respect to the federal government.<ref>Robert J. McCarthy, Civil Rights in Tribal Courts; The Indian Bill of Rights at 30 Years, 34 IDAHO LAW REVIEW 465 (1998).</ref> In 1975, the U.S. government passed the [[Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act]], marking the culmination of fifteen years of policy changes. It resulted from American Indian activism, the Civil Rights Movement, and community development aspects of President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s social programs of the 1960s. The Act recognized the right and need of Native Americans for self-determination. It marked the U.S. government's turn away from the 1950s policy of termination of the relationship between tribes and the government. The U.S. government encouraged Native Americans' efforts at self-government and determining their futures. Tribes have developed organizations to administer their own social, welfare and housing programs, for instance. Tribal self-determination has created tension with respect to the federal government's historic trust obligation to care for Indians; however, the Bureau of Indian Affairs has never lived up to that responsibility.<ref>Robert J.

Until 2017 Virginia previously had no federally recognized tribes but the state had recognized eight. This is related historically to the greater impact of disease and warfare on the Virginia Indian populations, as well as their intermarriage with Europeans and Africans. Some people confused the ancestry with culture, but groups of Virginia Indians maintained their cultural continuity. Most of their early reservations were ended under the pressure of early European settlement.\n\nSome historians also note the problems of Virginia Indians in establishing documented continuity of identity, due to the work of [[Walter Ashby Plecker]] (1912\u20131946). As registrar of the state's Bureau of Vital Statistics, he applied his own interpretation of the [[one-drop rule]], enacted in law in 1924 as the state's Racial Integrity Act. It recognized only two races: \"white\" and \"colored\".\n\nPlecker, a [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregationist]], believed that the state's Native Americans had been \"mongrelized\" by intermarriage with [[African American]]s; to him, ancestry determined identity, rather than culture. He thought that some people of partial black ancestry were trying to \"[[passing (racial identity)|pass]]\" as Native Americans. Plecker thought that anyone with any African heritage had to be classified as colored, regardless of appearance, amount of European or Native American ancestry, and cultural/community identification. Plecker pressured local governments into reclassifying all Native Americans in the state as \"colored\", and gave them lists of family surnames to examine for reclassification based on his interpretation of data and the law. This led to the state's destruction of accurate records related to families and communities who identified as Native American (as in church records and daily life). By his actions, sometimes different members of the same family were split by being classified as \"white\" or \"colored\". He did not allow people to enter their primary identification as Native American in state records.<ref name=\"home.hamptonroads.com\">{{cite web |url=http://home.hamptonroads.com/stories/story.cfm?story=74481&ran=162825 |website=Pilotonline.com |title=The black-and-white world of Walter Ashby Plecker |accessdate=February 8, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103123937/http://home.hamptonroads.com/stories/story.cfm?story=74481&ran=162825 |archivedate=January 3, 2006 |df= }}</ref> In 2009, the [[Senate Indian Affairs Committee]] endorsed a bill that would grant federal recognition to tribes in Virginia.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www2.timesdispatch.com/rtd/news/state_regional/state_regional_govtpolitics/article/INDI23_20091022-223007/301146//|title = Virginia tribes take another step on road to federal recognition|url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://archive.today/20091026175747/http://www2.timesdispatch.com/rtd/news/state_regional/state_regional_govtpolitics/article/INDI23_20091022-223007/301146/|archivedate = October 26, 2009|date = October 23, 2009|website = Richmond Times-Dispatch|df = }}</ref>\n\nTo achieve federal recognition and its benefits, tribes must prove continuous existence since 1900.

Watercolor by John White, 1585]]\nNative Americans have been depicted by [[List of American artists|American artists]] in various ways at different periods. A number of 19th- and 20th-century United States and Canadian painters, often motivated by a desire to document and preserve Native culture, specialized in Native American subjects. Among the most prominent of these were [[Elbridge Ayer Burbank]], [[George Catlin]], [[Seth and Mary Eastman|Seth Eastman]], [[Paul Kane]], [[W. Langdon Kihn]], [[Charles Bird King]], [[Joseph Henry Sharp]], and [[John Mix Stanley]].\n\nIn the 20th century, early portrayals of Native Americans in [[movies]] and [[television]] roles were first performed by European Americans dressed in mock traditional attire. Examples included ''The Last of the Mohicans'' (1920), ''Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans'' (1957), and ''[[F Troop]]'' (1965\u201367). In later decades, Native American actors such as [[Jay Silverheels]] in ''[[The Lone Ranger#Television series|The Lone Ranger]]'' television series (1949\u201357) came to prominence. Roles of Native Americans were limited and not reflective of Native American culture. By the 1970s some Native American film roles began to show more complexity, such as those in ''[[Little Big Man (film)|Little Big Man]]'' (1970), ''[[Billy Jack]]'' (1971), and ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' (1976), which depicted Native Americans in minor supporting roles.\n\nFor years, Native people on U.S. television were relegated to secondary, subordinate roles. During the years of the series ''[[Bonanza]]'' (1959\u20131973), no major or secondary Native characters appeared on a consistent basis. The series ''[[The Lone Ranger]]'' (1949\u20131957), ''[[Cheyenne (1955 TV series)|Cheyenne]]'' (1955\u20131963), and ''[[Law of the Plainsman]]'' (1959\u20131963) had Native characters who were essentially aides to the central white characters. This continued in such series as ''[[How the West Was Won (TV series)|How the West Was Won]]''. These programs resembled the \"sympathetic\" yet contradictory film ''[[Dances With Wolves]]'' of 1990, in which, according to Ella Shohat and Robert Stam, the narrative choice was to relate the Lakota story as told through a Euro-American voice, for wider impact among a general audience.<ref>Shohat, Ella, and Stam, Robert. ''Unthinking Eurocentrism: Multiculturalism and the Media''. New York: Routledge, 1994.</ref>\nLike the 1992 remake of ''[[The Last of the Mohicans (1992 film)|The Last of the Mohicans]]'' and ''[[Geronimo: An American Legend]]'' (1993), ''Dances with Wolves'' employed a number of Native American actors, and made an effort to portray Indigenous languages.\n\nIn 2009 ''[[We Shall Remain (documentary)|We Shall Remain]]'' (2009), a television documentary by [[Ric Burns]] and part of the ''[[American Experience]]'' series, presented a five-episode series \"from a Native American perspective\". It represented \"an unprecedented collaboration between Native and non-Native filmmakers and involves Native advisors and scholars at all levels of the project\".<ref>{{Cite news |title=About the Project: We Shall Remain|url =https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/weshallremain/the_films/about |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}</ref> The five episodes explore the impact of [[King Philip's War]] on the northeastern tribes, the \"Native American confederacy\" of [[Tecumseh's War]], the U.S.-forced relocation of Southeastern tribes known as the [[Trail of Tears]], the pursuit and capture of [[Geronimo]] and the [[Apache Wars]], and concludes with the [[Wounded Knee incident]], participation by the [[American Indian Movement]], and the increasing resurgence of modern Native cultures since.\n\n===Terminology differences===\n{{further|Native American name controversy}}\n\n====Common usage in the United States====\nNative Americans are often known as Indians or American Indians. The term ''Native American'' was introduced in the United States in preference to the older term ''Indian'' to distinguish the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] from the people of [[India]] and to avoid negative stereotypes associated with the term ''Indian''. In 1995, a plurality of indigenous Americans, however, preferred the term ''American Indian''<ref name=\"Census\">{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0762158.html |website=Infoplease |title=Preference for Racial or Ethnic Terminology |accessdate=February 8, 2006}}</ref> and many [[List of federally recognized tribes|tribes]] include the word Indian in their formal title.\n\nCriticism of the [[neologism]] ''Native American'' comes from diverse sources. [[Russell Means]], an American Indian activist, opposed the term ''Native American'' because he believed it was imposed by the government without the consent of American Indians. He has also argued that the use of the word ''Indian'' derives not from a confusion with India but from a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] expression ''en Dios'' meaning \"in God\"<ref>Russell Means: \"I am an American Indian, not a native American!\" (Treaty Productions, 1996); citation given here [http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nc-american-indians/5526] and here [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/roadshow/fts/bismarck_200504A16.html] and they cover the general subject and some Means' contribution, but have no reference to \"En Di\u00f3s\" and only those non-working links to text.</ref>{{verify source|date=June 2018}} (and a near-[[homophone]] of the Spanish word for \"Indians\", ''indios'').\n\nA 1995 U.S. Census Bureau survey found that more Native Americans in the United States preferred ''American Indian'' to ''Native American''.<ref name=\"Census\" /> Most American Indians are comfortable with ''Indian'', ''American Indian'', and ''Native American'', and the terms are often used interchangeably.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/aihmterms.html |website=Infoplease |title=''American Indian'' versus ''Native American'' |accessdate=February 8, 2006}}</ref> The traditional term is reflected in the name chosen for the [[National Museum of the American Indian]], which opened in 2004 on [[The Mall (Washington, DC)|the Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\n===Gambling industry===\n[[File:Sandia Casino, detail.jpg|thumb|Sandia Casino, owned by the [[Sandia Pueblo]] of [[New Mexico]]]]\n{{Main|Native American gaming}}\n[[Gambling]] has become a leading industry.

Some tribes, such as the [[Winnemem Wintu]] of [[Redding, California]], feel that casinos and their proceeds destroy culture from the inside out. These tribes refuse to participate in the gambling industry.\n\n===Financial services===\nNumerous tribes around the country have entered the financial services market including the [[Otoe-Missouria]], [[Tunica-Biloxi]], and the [[Rosebud Indian Reservation|Rosebud Sioux]]. Because of the challenges involved in starting a financial services business from scratch, many tribes hire outside consultants and vendors to help them launch these businesses and manage the regulatory issues involved.\nSimilar to the tribal sovereignty debates that occurred when tribes first entered the gaming industry, the tribes, states, and federal government are currently in disagreement regarding who possesses the authority to regulate these e-commerce business entities.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Online Sovereignty: The Law and Economics of Tribal Electronic Commerce|ssrn=2740181|journal=Vanderbilt Journal of Entertainment & Technology Law|date=March 2016|last1=Claw|first1=Carma|last2=Spilde|first2=Katherine A.|author2-link=Katherine Spilde|last3=Clarkson|first3=Esq}}</ref>\n\n===Crime on reservations===\nProsecution of serious crime, historically endemic on reservations,<ref name=DOJStat>{{cite web|title=A BJS Statistical Profile, 1992\u20132002 American Indians and Crime|url=http://www.justice.gov/otj/pdf/american_indians_and_crime.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice Office of Justice Programs|accessdate=June 2, 2012|author=Steven W.

Fractionalization occurs when a landowner dies, and their land is inherited by their children, but not subdivided. This means that one parcel might be owned by 50 different individuals. A majority of those holding interest must agree to any proposal to develop the land, and establishing this consent is time-consuming, cumbersome, and sometimes impossible.\nAnother landownership issue on reservations is checkerboarding, where Tribal land is interspersed with land owned by the federal government on behalf of Native's, individually owned plots, and land owned by non-Native individuals. This prevents Tribal governments to secure plots of land large enough for economic development or agricultural uses.<ref>https://www.frbsf.org/community-development/files/Community-Investments-Fall-2013-Native-Communities.pdf</ref>\nBecause reservation land is owned \u201cin trust\u201d by the federal government, individuals living on reservations cannot build equity in their homes. This bars Native Americans from getting a loan, as there is nothing that a bank can collect if the loan is not paid. Past efforts to encourage landownership (such as the Dawes Act) resulted in a net loss of Tribal land. After they were familiarized with their [[Smallholding|smallholder status]], Native American landowners were lifted of trust restrictions and their land would get transferred back to them, contingent of a transactional fee to the federal government. The transfer fee discouraged Native American land ownership, with 65% of tribal owned land being sold to non-Native Americans by the 1920s.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Van Winkle|first=Tony N.|date=Fall 2018|title=American Indian Landowners, Leasemen, and Bureaucrats: Property, Paper, and the Poli-Technics of Dispossession in Southwestern Oklahoma|url=|journal=American Indian Quarterly|volume=42|issue=4|pages=508\u2013533|doi=10.5250/amerindiquar.42.4.0508}}</ref> Activists against property rights point to historical evidence of communal ownership of land and resources by tribes.

The '''Columbian exchange''', also known as the '''Columbian interchange''', was the widespread transfer of plants, animals, culture, human populations, technology, and ideas between the [[Americas]] and the [[Old World]] in the 15th and 16th centuries, following [[Christopher Columbus]]'s [[voyages of Christopher Columbus#First voyage|1492 voyage]].<ref name = \"history\">{{cite journal |last1= Nunn |first1= Nathan |last2= Qian |first2= Nancy |year= 2010 |title= The Columbian Exchange: A History of Disease, Food, and Ideas |journal= [[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume= 24 |issue= 2 |pages= 163\u2013188 |jstor= 25703506 |doi= 10.1257/jep.24.2.163 |url= http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:11986330 |citeseerx= 10.1.1.232.9242 }}</ref> The Columbian exchange generally had a destructive impact on Native American culture through disease, and a 'clash of cultures',<ref>Emmer, Pieter. \"The Myth of Early Globalization: The Atlantic Economy, 1500\u20131800.\" European Review 11, no. 1.

Feb. 2003. p. 46</ref>\n\nThe impact of the Columbian exchange was not entirely negative however. For example, the re-introduction of the horse to North America allowed the [[Plains Indian]] to revolutionize their way of life by making hunting, trading, and warfare far more effective, and to greatly improve their ability to transport possessions and move their settlements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.na.038|title=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains \u2013 HORSE|website=plainshumanities.unl.edu}}</ref>\n\nThe Great Plains tribes were still hunting the bison when they first encountered the Europeans. The Spanish reintroduction of the horse to North America in the 17th century and Native Americans' learning to use them greatly altered the Native Americans' culture, including changing the way in which they hunted large game. Horses became such a valuable, central element of Native lives that they were counted as a measure of wealth.\n\nIn the early years, as these native peoples encountered European explorers and settlers and engaged in trade, they exchanged food, crafts, and furs for blankets, iron and steel implements, horses, trinkets, firearms, and alcoholic beverages.\n\n===Ethno-linguistic classification===\n[[File:Langs N.Amer.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Pre-contact: distribution of North American language families, including northern Mexico]]\n{{Main|Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous languages of the Americas|}}\n\nThe [[Na-Den\u00e9 languages|Na-Den\u00e9]], [[Algic languages|Algic]], and [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]] families are the largest in terms of number of languages.

Na-Den\u00e9 and Algic have the widest geographic distributions: Algic currently spans from northeastern Canada across much of the continent down to northeastern Mexico (due to later migrations of the [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]]) with two outliers in [[California]] ([[Yurok language|Yurok]] and [[Wiyot language|Wiyot]]); Na-Den\u00e9 spans from Alaska and western Canada through [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], and California to the [[Southwestern United States|U.S. Southwest]] and northern Mexico (with one outlier in the Plains). Several families consist of only 2 or 3 languages. Demonstrating genetic relationships has proved difficult due to the great linguistic diversity present in North America. Two large (super-) family proposals, [[Penutian languages|Penutian]] and [[Hokan languages|Hokan]], look particularly promising.

Native farmers practiced [[Polyculture|polycropping]] maize, beans, and squash; these crops are known as the [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|Three Sisters]]. The beans would replace the [[nitrogen]], which the maize leached from the ground, as well as using corn stalks for support for climbing.\n\nThe [[Gender roles in agriculture|agriculture gender roles]] of the Native Americans varied from region to region.

Clearing the land was an immense chore since the Native Americans rotated fields.\n\n[[Europeans]] in the eastern part of the continent observed that Native Americans cleared large areas for cropland.

If a couple separates or the man dies, the woman has her family to assist her. In matrilineal cultures the mother's brothers are usually the leading male figures in her children's lives; fathers have no standing in their wife and children's clan, as they still belong to their own mother's clan. Hereditary clan chief positions pass through the mother's line and chiefs have historically been selected on recommendation of women elders, who could also disapprove of a chief.<ref name=Thomas/>\n\nIn the [[patrilineal]] tribes, such as the [[Omaha]], [[Osage Nation|Osage]], [[Ponca]], and [[Lakota people|Lakota]], hereditary leadership passes through the male line, and children are considered to belong to the father and his [[clan]].

Native Americans began selling war captives to Europeans rather than integrating them into their own societies as they had done before. As the demand for labor in the [[West Indies]] grew with the cultivation of [[sugar cane]], Europeans enslaved Native Americans for the [[Thirteen Colonies]], and some were exported to the \"sugar islands\". The British settlers, especially those in the southern colonies, purchased or captured Native Americans to use as forced labor in cultivating tobacco, rice, and indigo.

It gave rise to a series of devastating wars among the tribes, including the [[Yamasee War]]. The [[Indian Wars]] of the early 18th century, combined with the increasing importation of African slaves, effectively ended the Native American slave trade by 1750. Colonists found that Native American slaves could easily escape, as they knew the country. The wars cost the lives of numerous colonial slave traders and disrupted their early societies. The remaining Native American groups banded together to face the Europeans from a position of strength. Many surviving Native American peoples of the southeast strengthened their loose coalitions of language groups and joined confederacies such as the [[Choctaw]], the [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creek]], and the [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]] for protection.

Such captives were from rival tribes and later were taken from raids on European settlements. Some tribes also sheltered or adopted white traders and runaway slaves, and others owned slaves of their own. Tribes with long trading histories with Europeans show a higher rate of European admixture, reflecting years of intermarriage between Native American women and European men, often seen as advantageous to both sides.<ref name=\"eurekalert.org\"/> A number of paths to genetic and ethnic diversity among Native Americans have occurred.\n\nIn recent years, genetic genealogists have been able to determine the proportion of Native American ancestry carried by the African-American population. The literary and history scholar [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]], had experts on his TV programs who discussed African-American ancestry. They stated that 5% of African Americans have at least 12.5% Native American ancestry, or the equivalent to one great-grandparent, which may represent more than one distant ancestor. A greater percentage could have a smaller proportion of Indian ancestry, but their conclusions show that popular estimates of Native American admixture may have been too high.<ref>Henry Louis Gates, Jr., ''In Search of Our Roots: How 19 Extraordinary African Americans Reclaimed Their Past'', New York: Crown Publishers, 2009, pp. 20\u201321.</ref> More recent genetic testing research of 2015, have found varied ancestries which show different tendencies by region and sex of ancestors.

Each tribal government makes its own rules for eligibility of citizens or tribal members. Among tribes, qualification for enrollment may be based upon a required percentage of Native American \"blood\" (or the \"[[Blood quantum laws|blood quantum]]\") of an individual seeking recognition, or documented descent from an ancestor on the [[Dawes Rolls]] or other registers. But, the federal government has its own standards related to who qualifies for services available to certified Native Americans. For instance, federal scholarships for Native Americans require the student both to be enrolled in a federally recognized tribe ''and'' to be of at least one-quarter Native American descent (equivalent to one grandparent), attested to by a [[Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood]] (CDIB) card issued by the federal government.\n\nSome tribes have begun requiring [[genealogical DNA test]]ing of individuals' applying for membership, but this is usually related to an individual's proving parentage or direct descent from a certified member.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kaplan |first1=Karen |title=Ancestry in a Drop of Blood |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/aug/30/science/sci-indiandna30 |accessdate=October 17, 2018 |work=LA TImes |date=August 30, 2005}}</ref> Requirements for tribal membership vary widely by tribe. The Cherokee require documented direct genealogical descent from a Native American listed on the early 1906 [[Dawes Rolls]]. Tribal rules regarding recognition of members who have heritage from multiple tribes are equally diverse and complex.\n\nTribal membership conflicts have led to a number of legal disputes, court cases, and the formation of activist groups. One example of this are the [[Cherokee Freedmen]]. Today, they include descendants of African Americans once enslaved by the Cherokees, who were granted, by federal treaty, citizenship in the [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|historic Cherokee Nation]] as freedmen after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The [[Cherokee Nation|modern Cherokee Nation]], in the early 1980s, passed a law to require that all members must prove descent from a Cherokee Native American (not Cherokee Freedmen) listed on the Dawes Rolls, resulting in the exclusion of some individuals and families who had been active in Cherokee culture for years.\n\n===Increased self-identification===\nSince the census of 2000, people may identify as being of more than one race.<ref name=\"2010 Census AMAN\" /> Since the 1960s, the number of people claiming Native American ancestry has grown significantly and by the 2000 census, the number had more than doubled. Sociologists attribute this dramatic change to \"ethnic shifting\" or \"ethnic shopping\"; they believe that it reflects a willingness of people to question their birth identities and adopt new ethnicities which they find more compatible.\n\nThe author [[Jack Hitt]] writes:\n\n{{quote|The reaction from lifelong Indians runs the gamut. It is easy to find Native Americans who denounce many of these new Indians as members of the wannabe tribe. But it is also easy to find Indians like Clem Iron Wing, an elder among the [[Lakota people|Lakota]], who sees this flood of new ethnic claims as magnificent, a surge of Indians 'trying to come home.' Those Indians who ridicule Iron Wing's lax sense of tribal membership have retrofitted the old genocidal system of blood quantum\u2014measuring racial purity by blood\u2014into the new standard for real Indianness, a choice rich with paradox.<ref name=\"Newest Indians\"/>}}\n\nThe journalist Mary Annette Pember notes that identifying with Native American culture may be a result of a person's increased interest in [[genealogy]], the romanticization of the lifestyle, and a family tradition of Native American ancestors in the distant past. There are different issues if a person wants to pursue enrollment as a member of a tribe. Different tribes have different requirements for tribal membership; in some cases persons are reluctant to enroll, seeing it as a method of control initiated by the federal government; and there are individuals who are 100% Native American but, because of their mixed tribal heritage, do not qualify to belong to any individual tribe. Pember concludes:\n\n{{quote|The subjects of genuine American Indian blood, cultural connection and recognition by the community are extremely contentious issues, hotly debated throughout Indian country and beyond.

The Trump administration had just imposed steel and aluminum tariffs on many countries, including European countries that are fellow members of the G7, and Canada, the host country for the 2018 meeting. Trump expressed dismay at Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau for holding a press conference in which Canada restated its position on tariffs (a public criticism of Trump's economic policy), and directed his representatives at the meeting to not sign the economic section of the joint communiqu\u00e9 that is typically issued at the conclusion of the meeting. \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel described Trump's behavior as a \"depressing withdrawal,\" while French President Emmanuel Macron invited him \"to be serious.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://tg24.sky.it/mondo/2018/06/10/g7-canada-trump.html|title=G7, Trump non-accetta il documento finale.

The Trump administration had just imposed steel and aluminum tariffs on many countries, including European countries that are fellow members of the G7, and Canada, the host country for the 2018 meeting. Trump expressed dismay at Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau for holding a press conference in which Canada restated its position on tariffs (a public criticism of Trump's economic policy), and directed his representatives at the meeting to not sign the economic section of the joint communiqu\u00e9 that is typically issued at the conclusion of the meeting. \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel described Trump's behavior as a \"depressing withdrawal,\" while French President Emmanuel Macron invited him \"to be serious.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://tg24.sky.it/mondo/2018/06/10/g7-canada-trump.html|title=G7, Trump non-accetta il documento finale.
