Set in a universe in which [[Axis victory in World War II|Nazi Germany won World War II]], the story's lead protagonist is an officer of the [[Kripo]], the criminal police, who is investigating the murder of a Nazi government official who participated at the [[Wannsee Conference]]. A plot is thus discovered to eliminate all of those who attended conference to help the improvement of Germany's relations with the United States.\n\nThe novel inverts some of the conventions of the detective novel. It begins with a murder and diligent police detective investigating and eventually solving it. However, since the murderer is highly placed in a tyrannical regime, solving the mystery does not result in the detective pursuing and arresting the murderer. The contrary occurs in the novel: the murderer pursuing and arresting the detective.\n\nThe novel was an immediate best-seller in the UK and has sold over three million copies and been translated into 25 languages.<ref>{{Citation |last=[[Gavriel David Rosenfeld|Rosenfeld]] |first=Gavriel David |title=The world Hitler never made |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005 |isbn=0-521-84706-0 |page=87 }}.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIt is April 1964 in [[Nazi Germany]], in the week leading up to [[Adolf Hitler]]'s{{refn|group=note|Hitler (as with the other \"real\" characters in the novel) is described factually up to 1942, after which the treatment is fictional.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|pp=385\u2013386|ps=; Author's Note}}}} 75th birthday.

As March uncovers more details, he realises that he is caught up in a political scandal involving senior [[Nazi Party]] officials, who are apparently being systematically murdered under staged circumstances. As soon as the body is identified, the [[Gestapo]] claims jurisdiction and orders the Kripo to close its investigation.\n\nIn the story, March meets with Charlotte 'Charlie' Maguire, an American journalist also determined to investigate the case. They both travel to [[Z\u00fcrich]] to investigate the private [[Switzerland|Swiss]] bank account of one of the murdered officials. Ultimately, the two uncover the truth behind the staged murders: [[Reinhard Heydrich]],{{refn|group=note|In reality, Heydrich was killed in 1942.}} the [[Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS|head of the SS]], has ordered the Gestapo to eliminate the remaining officials who planned the [[the Holocaust|Final Solution]] (of which few Germans are aware) at the [[Wannsee Conference]] in January 1942. The elimination is being hurried to safeguard an upcoming meeting of Hitler and United States President [[Joseph P. Kennedy]] by ensuring that the fate of the missing Jews can never be revealed. Maguire heads for neutral [[Switzerland]], hoping to expose the evidence of the extermination to the world. March, however, is denounced by his ten-year-old son and apprehended by the Gestapo.\n\nIn the cellars of Gestapo headquarters at [[Niederkirchnerstra\u00dfe|Prinz-Albrecht-Stra\u00dfe]], March is tortured but does not reveal the location of Maguire. Globocnik boasts that [[Auschwitz]] and the other camps have been totally razed, and March will never know the truth for certain. Kripo Chief Arthur Nebe stages a rescue, intending to track March as he meets with Maguire at their rendezvous in [[Waldshut-Tiengen]] on the Swiss/German border. March realises what is happening and heads for [[Auschwitz]], leading the authorities in the wrong direction.\n\nThe Gestapo catches up with March at the unmarked site of Auschwitz. Knowing that Maguire has had the time to cross the border into Switzerland, March searches for some sign that the camp existed. As Gestapo agents close in on him in a helicopter, March uncovers bricks in the undergrowth. Satisfied, he pulls out his gun.\n\n==Characters==\n===Fictional===\n*Xavier March. A detective in the [[Kriminalpolizei]] with the concurrent honorary rank of [[Sturmbannf\u00fchrer]] (Major) in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], March (nicknamed \"Zavi\" by his friends) is a 42-year-old divorc\u00e9 living in Berlin. He has one son, Pili (Paul), who lives with March's ex-wife, Klara. March's father died in 1929 from wounds sustained while he was serving in the [[Imperial German Navy]] during the [[Great War]], and his mother was killed in a [[Royal Air Force]] bombing raid in 1942. March commanded a [[U-Boat]] in World War II and was decorated for bravery and promoted. He married his nurse after the war, but the marriage steadily deteriorated afterward. His military service helped him rise through the police ranks to detective. By 1964, however, he is secretly under Gestapo surveillance since it correctly perceives him to have an intense dislike of the Nazi regime. For example, March refuses to donate to the '[[Winterhilfswerk|winter-relief]]', shows \"insufficient enthusiasm\" for his son's involvement in the [[Jungvolk]], has rebuffed all incentives to join the Nazi Party, tells \"jokes about the Party\" and, worst of all, has shown some curiosity about what happened to a Jewish family that used to live in his present apartment.\n*Charlotte \"Charlie\" Maguire. A 25-year-old American journalist, Maguire has been assigned to Berlin by the fictional [[news agency|news service]] ''World European Features''. Midway through the novel, she and March fall in love and begin a relationship. Maguire comes from a prominent [[Irish-American]] political family but is something of a renegade. The daughter of a US State Department official and German actress who left with him before the war, Maguire speaks fluent German without an accent.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|pp=206\u2013207|ps=; Part 3, chapter 7}}\n*Hermann Jost. A 19-year-old cadet in an SS [[military academy]], Jost was out running when he discovered the corpse that triggered March's investigation. March is certain that Jost witnessed more than he is willing to disclose and at first believes him to be covering up a [[homosexual]] relationship with a fellow cadet, which is punishable by the [[death penalty]]. March, however, persuades Jost to admit the truth: Jost witnessed the dumping of the body and recognised SS General [[Odilo Globocnik]] at the scene. Midway through the novel, Globocnik smugly tells March, \"It's over. You have no witness\". March learns that Jost has been sent to a [[Strafbattalion|punishment battalion]] in occupied Russia that likely resulted in his death.\n*Paul \"Pili\" March. The ten-year-old son of March, Pili lives with his mother and her partner in a [[bungalow]] in the suburbs of Berlin. Pili is a fully-indoctrinated member of the ''[[Jungvolk]]'', the junior section of the [[Hitler Youth]] for boys between 10 and 14. Later in the novel, Pili denounces his father to the Gestapo, all the while unaware of what it will really do to him.\n*Max Jaeger. March's friend and Kripo partner, Jaeger is 50; lives with his wife, Hannelore, and four daughters in Berlin; and is disinclined to question 'the system'. At the end of the novel, he drives the getaway car that rescues March, but it is revealed that he had been informing against March since before the novel began and that March's \"rescue\" was arranged by the Gestapo as a ruse to find Maguire.\n*Walther Fiebes. A detective working in VB3, the Kripo's [[sexual crime]]s division, along the corridor from March's office, Fiebes is a man with a deeply prurient nature and relishes his work investigating sexual crimes, including rape, adultery and [[miscegenation|interracial relationships]] between \"Aryan\" women and their [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] servants.\n*Rudolf \"Rudi\" Halder. March's friend and a crewman on his U-boat, Rudi is now a historian working at the immense Reich Central Archives and helping to compile an official history of the [[Wehrmacht]] and [[Waffen-SS]] on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].\n*Karl Krebs. An officer in the Gestapo, Krebs is an example of the younger, university-trained SS-men hated by Globocnik.\n\n===Based on historical figures===\nHarris, in the ''Author's notes'' of the novel, explains that many characters are based on the real people with the same names and that the biographical details are indeed correct until 1942. Afterward, the narrative is fictional.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|pp=385\u2013386|ps=; Author's Note}} The following descriptions follow what is in the novel.\n*[[Odilo Globocnik]]. An aging [[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]] in the Gestapo and right-hand man of Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Reinhard Heydrich, nicknamed \"Globus\". He is a principal antagonist of the book who is personally responsible for the assassinations of the Wannsee officials. After March's apprehension by the Gestapo, Globus takes over March's interrogation and administers several brutal beatings.\n*[[Arthur Nebe]]. The chief of the Kripo, Nebe is an old man in 1964 and has a sumptuous office in Berlin.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=138|ps=; Part 3, chapter 2}} Initially appearing to support March's investigation for political reasons, despite the Gestapo's involvement, Nebe eventually ascertains the threat posed to the Reich's international standing by March's investigations and weaves a ruse to March to make him reveal the whereabouts of the evidence.\n*[[Josef B\u00fchler]]. A secretary and deputy governor to the Nazi-controlled [[General Government]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]].\n*[[Wilhelm Stuckart]].

The former [[King of the United Kingdom]], George VI fled to exile in Canada and lived there until his death in 1952 and remained King of the dominions and the British Empire.\n*[[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]]. Also fled to and now resides in Canada. Elizabeth, since the death of her father in 1952, has been a [[pretender]] to the British throne and is Queen of Canada, [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].

Germany and its sphere of influence are in red; the United States and its sphere of influence in blue; China in yellow]]\nThroughout the novel, Harris gradually explains, in a fictional [[backstory]], the developments that allowed Germany to prevail in World War II. The author explains in the ''Author's notes'' that except for the backstories of the fictitious characters, the narrative describes reality up to 1942, after which it is fictional.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|pp=385\u2013386|ps=; Author's Note}} A significant early [[point of divergence]] is that Heydrich survived the assassination attempt by Czech fighters in May 1942 ([[Operation Anthropoid|he was killed in reality]]) and later became head of the SS. Another significant divergence is the political career of Kennedy, who was, in real life, disgraced in 1940 during the [[Battle of Britain]]. In the novel, for an unexplained reason, his political fortunes did not suffer or possibly recovered after the German victory, and he eventually became US President. The Nazi offensives on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] ultimately push back the Soviet forces, with the [[Case Blue]] operation succeeding in capturing the [[Caucasus]] and cutting the [[Red Army]] off from its petroleum reserves by 1943.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=85|ps=; Part 2, chapter 5}} The Nazis also found that the [[Enigma machine]] code had been broken. A massive [[U-Boat]] campaign against Britain then succeeded in starving the British into surrender by 1944.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=85|ps=; Part 2, chapter 5}}\n\nIn the novel, [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]], the [[British royal family]] and the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] fled into exile in [[Canada]].{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=85|ps=; Part 2, chapter 5}} [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]] regained the British throne soon afterwards, with [[Wallis Simpson]] as his queen.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=5|ps=; Part 1, chapter 1}}{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=40|ps=; Part 1, chapter 4}}{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=85|ps=; Part 2, chapter 5}} The US defeated [[Imperial Japan|Japan]] in 1945 and [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|used nuclear weapons]], as in real life.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=85|ps=; Part 2, chapter 5}} Germany tested its first [[atomic bomb]] in 1946 and fired a non-nuclear \"V-3\" missile above [[New York City]] to demonstrate its ability to attack the [[Continental United States]] with long-range missiles.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=85|ps=; Part 2, chapter 5}} Thus, after a peace treaty in 1946, the US and Germany are the novel's two superpower opponents in the [[Cold War]].{{refn|group=note|It is not explicitly stated in the novel whether Germany and the US are the only nuclear powers in the world.}}{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=85|ps=; Part 2, chapter 5}} There is a reference to a brutal regime having power in [[China]] but no reference to either its ideology or whether it is headed by [[Mao Zedong]] or somebody else. [[Tibet (1912-1951)|Tibet]] remains independent.\n\n===Alternate post-war history===\nThe fictional backstory describes that after it achieved victory, Germany reorganises Europe east of Poland into [[Reichskommissariat]]s. After the signing of the Treaty of Rome, [[Western Europe]] and [[Scandinavia]] are corralled into a pro-German trade bloc, the [[European Confederation|European Community]]. By 1964, the United States and the Greater German Reich are involved in a [[Cold War]].{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=85|ps=; Part 2, chapter 5}} The only exception is Switzerland, which retains its neutral status.\n\nThe [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] has died down into an endless guerrilla war in the [[Ural Mountains]] and [[Siberia]].{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=209|ps=; Part 3, chapter 7}} Mounting casualties (at least 100,000 since 1960, according to the novel{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=209|ps=; Part 3, chapter 7}}) have sapped the German military despite Hitler's statement, which is quoted in the novel, about a [[perpetual war]] to keep the [[German people]] on their toes. Dead German soldiers are returned to Germany in the middle of the night.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=209|ps=; Part 3, chapter 7}}\n\nThe action of the novel takes place from 14 to 20 April 1964, as Germany prepares for Hitler's 75th birthday celebrations on the latter date. A visit by US President Kennedy is planned as part of a gradual [[d\u00e9tente]] between the United States and the Germany. The novel suggests that the Nazi hierarchy is eager for peace since its efforts to settle the conquered East are failing because of continued resistance from [[Poland|Polish]] and Soviet partisan movements. Moreover, the Nazis failed to instil their ideology in the younger generation; many young German turn away from the regime though active opposition to the regime is limited.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=155|ps=; Part 3, chapter 3}}\n\n[[The Holocaust]] has been explained away officially as merely the relocation of the [[Jews]] into areas of [[Eastern Europe]], where communications and transport networks are still very poor. However, many Germans suspect the government to have eliminated the Jews but are generally unconcerned or too afraid of the authorities to say or to do anything. Some surviving Jews have escaped to the [[Soviet Union]] and provided testimony of the extermination efforts there. Nazi authorities decry Bolshevik propaganda, but the outside world is aware of the Holocaust. The American president, however, remains neutral to avoid further damaging relations and refers only to vague \"human rights violations\" that he wishes to investigate when he visits Berlin.\n\nThe end suggests that the plans of both Kennedy and Hitler might be seriously derailed by the documents obtained by the protagonists and successfully smuggled out of Germany by Charlie. Their publication gives concrete hard evidence on the systematic murder of the Jews and might cause the cancellation of the Hitler\u2013Kennedy summit and sabotage the plans for a German\u2013American d\u00e9tente on which the Nazis were counting for economic recovery. The documents might also cause Kennedy to lose re-election in November 1964. The novel does not mention who the opposing candidate is and the policies that the candidate supports, but it might be a more anti-Nazi Cold Warrior.\n\n===Greater German Reich and international politics===\n[[File:Fatherland's 1964 Europe.jpg|350px|right|thumb|''Fatherland''{{'}}s 1964 Europe]]\nThe first few pages of the novel feature two maps: one of the city centre of Berlin and another of the extent of the massively-expanded Greater German Reich, which stretches from [[Alsace-Lorraine]] (\"Westmark\") in the west to the [[Ural Mountains]] and lower [[Caucasus]] in the east.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|loc=Introduction}}\n\nThe Reich has retained [[Austria]] (now \"[[Ostmark (Austria)|Ostmark]]\"), [[Slovenia]], the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] and [[Luxembourg]] (now \"Moselland\"). In the East, Poland is still ruled as a colony by the [[General Government]], and Soviet territory west of the Urals has been divided into five Reichkommissariats: [[Reichskommissariat Ostland|Ostland]] ([[Belarus]] and the [[Baltic states]]), [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine|Ukraine]] with [[Odessa]], [[Reichskommissariat Moskau|Muscovy]] (from [[Moscow]] to the Urals), and [[Reichskommissariat Kaukasus|Caucasus]], along with ''Generalkommissariat Taurida'' (Southern Ukraine and the [[Crimea]]). There is also mention of a German naval base in [[Trondheim]], [[Norway]], where the Reich's nuclear submarines are based.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=40|ps=; Part 1, chapter 4}}\n\nBerlin has been remodelled as Hitler's \"[[Welthauptstadt Germania|capital of capitals]]\" and is designed according to the wishes of Hitler and his top architect, [[Albert Speer]],{{refn|group=note|Harris states the architectural description follows Speer's actual plans{{sfnp|Harris|2000|pp=385\u2013386|ps=; Author's Note}}}} and is the world's largest city, with a population of ten million, where the virtually-powerless \"European Parliament\" is based.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=188|ps=; Part 2, chapter 7}}\n\nIn the novel, the rest of Western and [[Northern Europe]], excluding Switzerland and [[Vatican City]], has been corralled by Germany into a European Community, which is made up of [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]], [[Francoist Spain|Spain]], [[France]], [[Ireland]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Belgium]], [[Netherlands]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]]. The map provided shows [[Andorra]] was annexed by Spain and [[San Marino]] by Italy, and [[Liechtenstein]] was absorbed directly into Nazi Germany, similar to [[Anschluss|Austria]]. Eastern Europe is dominated by Germany and includes [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]], [[Greece]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Italian protectorate of Albania (1939\u20131943)|Albania]] and [[Government of National Salvation|Serbia]]. The European Community, despite having nominally-free nations under their own governments and leaders, are presumably only just able to police their own territory, and they are under constant watch by Berlin and are subordinate to Germany in all but name. The [[flag of Nazi Germany|German flag]] over the headquarters is twice as big as those of the other nations.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=188|ps=; Part 2, chapter 7}}\n\nThe Reich had turned its eyes to Switzerland and sought to absorb its German-speaking [[cantons of Switzerland|cantons]], but the stalemate of the Cold War settled in. Switzerland thus became a convenient neutral spot for diplomacy and for American and German intelligence agents to spy on each other and is the last state in Europe with a foreign policy that is independent of Berlin. \nIn the backstory, the United States is locked in a Cold War with Germany. Since the end of the war in 1946, both superpowers have developed nuclear and space technologies. Japan was defeated by the United States by the detonation of the atomic bomb. The United States is said to have not participated in the [[Olympic Games]] since 1936 but is expected to return in 1964. The novel refer to the [[League of Nations]] or to the possible existence of the [[United Nations]].\n\nA passing remark hints at [[China]] being ruled by a harsh government, but its precise nature and its leader ate not mentioned. A greatly-reduced Soviet [[rump state]], consisting of Siberia, the [[Russian Far East]] and [[Soviet Central Asia|Central Asia]], still exists, with its capital in [[Omsk]]. The US supplies weapons and funds, which allow the Russians to tie down German forces in the Urals. Although German propaganda plays down the war on the Eastern Front, the war there is taking its toll.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=209|ps=; Part 3, chapter 7}}{{refn|group=note|[[Africa]] and [[Latin America]] are not referred to in the novel.}}\n\nCanada, [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] are now allied with the United States, and all of [[Latin America]] (excluding the pro-Axis \"neutral\" [[Argentina]]) are pro-American satellites. [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]] resides in Canada and is recognised by Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Latin America and the United States as the rightful queen of the United Kingdom. [[Winston Churchill]] also lives in Canada.\n\nThe novel describes that since the end of the war, a stalemate has developed between Germany and the United States, which seems to overshadow international relations. New German buildings are constructed with mandatory [[bomb shelters]], and the ''Reichsarchiv'' (German National Archive) claims to have been built to withstand a direct missile hit.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=112|ps=; Part 2, chapter 7}}{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=244|ps=; Part 4, chapter 3}}\n\n===Nazi society===\nIn the novel, Germany concentrates on the [[containment]] of the Soviet Union. Hitler has taken some steps to soften his image over the years and now usually wears civilian clothes, instead of the party uniform. Nonetheless, no substantive changes have taken place in the regime's basic character. The [[Reichstag Fire Decree]] and the [[Enabling Act of 1933]], the legal bases for Hitler's dictatorship, remain in effect. The press, the radio and the television are tightly controlled. Dissenters are still sent to [[List of German concentration camps|concentration camps]]. Conditions in the camps are reputed to be as harsh as they were in the 1930s and 1940s, but the [[International Red Cross]] is occasionally given staged inspections.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=324|ps=; Part 5, chapter 6}}\n\nIn the novel, the bedrock of Nazi ideology is still the policy of blaming subversive and minority groups for Germany's economic and social problems. Jews, [[communism|communists]], [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] and [[miscegenation|interracial relationships]] (particularly between \"[[Aryan]]s\" and [[Slavic peoples|Slav]]s) continue to be scapegoats for the Nazis.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=17|ps=; Part 1, chapter 2}} Propaganda has previously depicted the United States to be corrupt, degenerate and poor. However, the bearing g diplomatic meeting between Hitler and Kennedy forces German propaganda is forced to change to a more positive image of the US.\n\nDespite its ideological and moral decline, Germany has a high standard of living, with its citizens living off the produce of their European satellite states and freed from physical labour by thousands of [[Polish people|Polish]], [[Czech people|Czech]] and [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainian]] workers. The European nations export high-quality consumer goods to Germany (noted imports are domestic electronics from Britain) and also provide services, such as an [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] academy at [[Oxford University]] and imported domestic staff. Hitler's personal tastes in [[Nazi art|art and music]] remain the norm for German society.\n\nMilitary service is still compulsory.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=?|ps=; Part 3, chapter 3}} Eastern Europe has been colonised by German settlers although local [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] resistance movements are still active, and the German population has soared as a result of Nazi emphasis on childbirth. As the first generation of Nazi leaders, which founded the party and came to power alongside Hitler, begins to die off, Nazi officials are increasingly well-educated technocrats in the mould of [[Albert Speer]]. The police force (the ''[[Ordnungspolizei|Orpo]]'', or uniformed police, and the ''[[Kriminalpolizei|Kripo]]'', or criminal investigation bureau) is integrated with the SS, with police officers having honorary SS ranks.{{refn|group=note|The real-life integration occurred in 1936.}}\n\nAccording to the main characters, however, German society in the early 1960s is becoming more and more rebellious. The younger generation has no memory of the instability that paved the way for Hitler's rise to power. Student protests, particularly against the war in the Urals; American and British cultural influence and growing [[pacifism]] are all found in society. [[Jazz]] music is still popular, and the German government claims to have come up with a version which is free from \"[[Negro|Negroid]] influence\". In spite of the general repressiveness, [[the Beatles]]' real-life [[Hamburg]] engagements have happened here and already been denounced in the state-run press.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=40|ps=; Part 1, chapter 4}} Germany is under constant attack by terrorist groups, with officials assassinated and civilian airliners bombed in-flight. [[Christianity]] is suppressed, and [[Hitler Youth|Nazi youth organisations]] are compulsory for all children. Universities are centres of student dissent, and the [[White Rose]] movement is once again active.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=155|ps=; Part 3, chapter 3}}\n\nThe Nazis continue with their policies for women by encouraging them to remain in the home and to bring up many children (that emphasises the first two elements of ''[[Kinder, K\u00fcche, Kirche]]''), but women are clearly present in the Nazi bureaucracy. Nazi organisations such as ''[[Strength Through Joy|Kraft durch Freude]]'' still exist and fulfill their original roles such as providing holidays to resort areas under German control. German citizens are still encouraged to contribute to the [[Winterhilfswerk]]. A sprawling transport network covers the entire Reich, including a vast [[autobahn]] and railway network in the manner of the real-life proposed ''[[Breitspurbahn]]'' system, which carries immense trains.\n\n===Technology===\nThe level of technology in the novel's 1960s is much the same as in real life. The [[German military]] uses [[jet aircraft]], [[nuclear submarines]],{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=40|ps=; Part 1, chapter 4}} and [[aircraft carriers]]; civilian technology has also advanced considerably. Jet airliners,{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=26|ps=; Part 1, chapter 3}} [[televisions]],{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=168|ps=; Part 3, chapter 3}} [[hair-dryer|hair-dryers]], [[coffee machines]] and [[photocopiers]]{{sfnp|Harris|2000|pp=251\u2013252|ps=; Part 4, chapter 4}} are used in Germany.\n\nBoth the United States and Germany appear to have sophisticated space technology. Germany's space program is based at the old rocket-testing facility at [[Peenem\u00fcnde]], on the Baltic coast. The extent of space exploration is not specified, but a conversation between March and Maguire suggests that German is justified in boasting about being ahead of the US in the [[Space Race]].{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=209|ps=; Part 3, chapter 7}}\n\n==Critical evaluations==\nBritish scholar Nancy Browne noted the similarities between the ending of ''Fatherland'' and that of [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'': \"Both novels end with the protagonist about to embark on a single-handed armed confrontation with a large number of Fascists or Nazis, of whose outcome there can be no doubt - but the reader does not witness the moment of his presumed death. (...) Like Hemingway's Robert Jordan, Xavier March is facing this last moment with an exhilaration born of having no further doubts and dilemmas, no more crucial decisions which need to be made, nothing but going through on his chosen course and dying in a just cause. And like Jordan, in sacrificing himself March is ensuring the safe escape of the woman he loves.<ref>\"Dr. Nancy Browne, \"In the perspective of a half a century after the event: Anti-Fascist and Anti-Nazi Resistance in English-language Popular Culture\" in Tamara Baxter (ed.) \"Multi-Disciplinary Round Table on the Lasting Heritage of the Twentieth Century\"</ref>\n\nThe review by ''[[The Guardian]]'', written by John Mullan, notes that Harris acknowledged a debt to Len Deighton's ''[[SS-GB]]'' (1978), an earlier postwar alternative or \"counter-factual\" history that was set in Great Britain in late 1941 after the (fictional) British surrender.<ref>{{cite web |last=Mullan |first=John |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/30/guardian-bookclub-fatherland-robert-harris |title=Fatherland by Robert Harris \u2013 Week one: speculative fiction |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=30 March 2012 |accessdate=30 August 2019}}</ref> Part 2 of the review states that Harris' \"invention of a nightmarish alternative history is... compelling\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Mullan |first=John |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/06/book-club-fatherland-robert-harris |title=Fatherland by Robert Harris \u2013 Week two: discoveries |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=6 April 2012 |accessdate=30 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==In other media{{anchor|Film, TV or theatrical adaptations}}==\n\n===Film===\n{{main|Fatherland (1994 film)}}\nA [[Fatherland (1994 film)|TV film of the book]] was made in 1994 by [[Home Box Office|HBO]], starring [[Rutger Hauer]] as March and [[Miranda Richardson]] as Maguire for which she received a [[Golden Globe Award]] in [[52nd Golden Globe Awards|1995]] for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV.

Set in a universe in which [[Axis victory in World War II|Nazi Germany won World War II]], the story's lead protagonist is an officer of the [[Kripo]], the criminal police, who is investigating the murder of a Nazi government official who participated at the [[Wannsee Conference]]. A plot is thus discovered to eliminate all of those who attended conference to help the improvement of Germany's relations with the United States.\n\nThe novel inverts some of the conventions of the detective novel. It begins with a murder and diligent police detective investigating and eventually solving it. However, since the murderer is highly placed in a tyrannical regime, solving the mystery does not result in the detective pursuing and arresting the murderer. The contrary occurs in the novel: the murderer pursuing and arresting the detective.\n\nThe novel was an immediate best-seller in the UK and has sold over three million copies and been translated into 25 languages.<ref>{{Citation |last=[[Gavriel David Rosenfeld|Rosenfeld]] |first=Gavriel David |title=The world Hitler never made |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005 |isbn=0-521-84706-0 |page=87 }}.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIt is April 1964 in [[Nazi Germany]], in the week leading up to [[Adolf Hitler]]'s{{refn|group=note|Hitler (as with the other \"real\" characters in the novel) is described factually up to 1942, after which the treatment is fictional.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|pp=385\u2013386|ps=; Author's Note}}}} 75th birthday. Detective Xavier March is an investigator working for the [[Kriminalpolizei (Nazi Germany)|Kriminalpolizei]] (''Kripo''), as he investigates the suspicious death of a high-ranking Nazi, [[Josef B\u00fchler]],{{refn|group=note|As with the other \"real\" characters in the novel, the biographical details up to 1942 are based on fact, after which the treatment is fictional.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|pp=385\u2013386|ps=; Author's Note}}}} in the [[Havel]] on the outskirts of [[Berlin]]. As March uncovers more details, he realises that he is caught up in a political scandal involving senior [[Nazi Party]] officials, who are apparently being systematically murdered under staged circumstances. As soon as the body is identified, the [[Gestapo]] claims jurisdiction and orders the Kripo to close its investigation.\n\nIn the story, March meets with Charlotte 'Charlie' Maguire, an American journalist also determined to investigate the case. They both travel to [[Z\u00fcrich]] to investigate the private [[Switzerland|Swiss]] bank account of one of the murdered officials. Ultimately, the two uncover the truth behind the staged murders: [[Reinhard Heydrich]],{{refn|group=note|In reality, Heydrich was killed in 1942.}} the [[Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS|head of the SS]], has ordered the Gestapo to eliminate the remaining officials who planned the [[the Holocaust|Final Solution]] (of which few Germans are aware) at the [[Wannsee Conference]] in January 1942. The elimination is being hurried to safeguard an upcoming meeting of Hitler and United States President [[Joseph P. Kennedy]] by ensuring that the fate of the missing Jews can never be revealed. Maguire heads for neutral [[Switzerland]], hoping to expose the evidence of the extermination to the world. March, however, is denounced by his ten-year-old son and apprehended by the Gestapo.\n\nIn the cellars of Gestapo headquarters at [[Niederkirchnerstra\u00dfe|Prinz-Albrecht-Stra\u00dfe]], March is tortured but does not reveal the location of Maguire. Globocnik boasts that [[Auschwitz]] and the other camps have been totally razed, and March will never know the truth for certain. Kripo Chief Arthur Nebe stages a rescue, intending to track March as he meets with Maguire at their rendezvous in [[Waldshut-Tiengen]] on the Swiss/German border. March realises what is happening and heads for [[Auschwitz]], leading the authorities in the wrong direction.\n\nThe Gestapo catches up with March at the unmarked site of Auschwitz. Knowing that Maguire has had the time to cross the border into Switzerland, March searches for some sign that the camp existed. As Gestapo agents close in on him in a helicopter, March uncovers bricks in the undergrowth. Satisfied, he pulls out his gun.\n\n==Characters==\n===Fictional===\n*Xavier March. A detective in the [[Kriminalpolizei]] with the concurrent honorary rank of [[Sturmbannf\u00fchrer]] (Major) in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], March (nicknamed \"Zavi\" by his friends) is a 42-year-old divorc\u00e9 living in Berlin. He has one son, Pili (Paul), who lives with March's ex-wife, Klara. March's father died in 1929 from wounds sustained while he was serving in the [[Imperial German Navy]] during the [[Great War]], and his mother was killed in a [[Royal Air Force]] bombing raid in 1942. March commanded a [[U-Boat]] in World War II and was decorated for bravery and promoted. He married his nurse after the war, but the marriage steadily deteriorated afterward. His military service helped him rise through the police ranks to detective. By 1964, however, he is secretly under Gestapo surveillance since it correctly perceives him to have an intense dislike of the Nazi regime. For example, March refuses to donate to the '[[Winterhilfswerk|winter-relief]]', shows \"insufficient enthusiasm\" for his son's involvement in the [[Jungvolk]], has rebuffed all incentives to join the Nazi Party, tells \"jokes about the Party\" and, worst of all, has shown some curiosity about what happened to a Jewish family that used to live in his present apartment.\n*Charlotte \"Charlie\" Maguire. A 25-year-old American journalist, Maguire has been assigned to Berlin by the fictional [[news agency|news service]] ''World European Features''. Midway through the novel, she and March fall in love and begin a relationship. Maguire comes from a prominent [[Irish-American]] political family but is something of a renegade. The daughter of a US State Department official and German actress who left with him before the war, Maguire speaks fluent German without an accent.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|pp=206\u2013207|ps=; Part 3, chapter 7}}\n*Hermann Jost. A 19-year-old cadet in an SS [[military academy]], Jost was out running when he discovered the corpse that triggered March's investigation. March is certain that Jost witnessed more than he is willing to disclose and at first believes him to be covering up a [[homosexual]] relationship with a fellow cadet, which is punishable by the [[death penalty]]. March, however, persuades Jost to admit the truth: Jost witnessed the dumping of the body and recognised SS General [[Odilo Globocnik]] at the scene. Midway through the novel, Globocnik smugly tells March, \"It's over. You have no witness\". March learns that Jost has been sent to a [[Strafbattalion|punishment battalion]] in occupied Russia that likely resulted in his death.\n*Paul \"Pili\" March. The ten-year-old son of March, Pili lives with his mother and her partner in a [[bungalow]] in the suburbs of Berlin. Pili is a fully-indoctrinated member of the ''[[Jungvolk]]'', the junior section of the [[Hitler Youth]] for boys between 10 and 14. Later in the novel, Pili denounces his father to the Gestapo, all the while unaware of what it will really do to him.\n*Max Jaeger. March's friend and Kripo partner, Jaeger is 50; lives with his wife, Hannelore, and four daughters in Berlin; and is disinclined to question 'the system'. At the end of the novel, he drives the getaway car that rescues March, but it is revealed that he had been informing against March since before the novel began and that March's \"rescue\" was arranged by the Gestapo as a ruse to find Maguire.\n*Walther Fiebes. A detective working in VB3, the Kripo's [[sexual crime]]s division, along the corridor from March's office, Fiebes is a man with a deeply prurient nature and relishes his work investigating sexual crimes, including rape, adultery and [[miscegenation|interracial relationships]] between \"Aryan\" women and their [[Slavic]] servants.\n*Rudolf \"Rudi\" Halder. March's friend and a crewman on his U-boat, Rudi is now a historian working at the immense Reich Central Archives and helping to compile an official history of the [[Wehrmacht]] and [[Waffen-SS]] on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].\n*Karl Krebs. An officer in the Gestapo, Krebs is an example of the younger, university-trained SS-men hated by Globocnik.\n\n===Based on historical figures===\nHarris, in the ''Author's notes'' of the novel, explains that many characters are based on the real people with the same names and that the biographical details are indeed correct until 1942. Afterward, the narrative is fictional.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|pp=385\u2013386|ps=; Author's Note}} The following descriptions follow what is in the novel.\n*[[Odilo Globocnik]]. An aging [[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]] in the Gestapo and right-hand man of Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Reinhard Heydrich, nicknamed \"Globus\". He is a principal antagonist of the book who is personally responsible for the assassinations of the Wannsee officials. After March's apprehension by the Gestapo, Globus takes over March's interrogation and administers several brutal beatings.\n*[[Arthur Nebe]]. The chief of the Kripo, Nebe is an old man in 1964 and has a sumptuous office in Berlin.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=138|ps=; Part 3, chapter 2}} Initially appearing to support March's investigation for political reasons, despite the Gestapo's involvement, Nebe eventually ascertains the threat posed to the Reich's international standing by March's investigations and weaves a ruse to March to make him reveal the whereabouts of the evidence.\n*[[Josef B\u00fchler]]. A secretary and deputy governor to the Nazi-controlled [[General Government]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]].\n*[[Wilhelm Stuckart]]. A [[Nazi Party]] lawyer, official and a state secretary in the German [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Interior Ministry]].\n*[[Martin Luther (diplomat)|Martin Luther]]. An advisor to Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]],\n*[[Reinhard Heydrich]]. The current head of the SS and is considered a likely successor to Hitler, Heydrich is a principal antagonist of the book although he never appears in person. He ordered the assassinations of the Wannsee officials to eradicate all first-hand evidence of the [[Final Solution]]. (In real life, he was assassinated on 4 June 1942 in Prague, but in the novel, the assassination failed.)\n\n====Others mentioned====\nIn each case, the description after the name describes how the characters appear in the novel, again by following reality until 1942.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|pp=385\u2013386|ps=; Author's Note}}\n*[[Adolf Hitler]].

The author explains in the ''Author's notes'' that except for the backstories of the fictitious characters, the narrative describes reality up to 1942, after which it is fictional.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|pp=385\u2013386|ps=; Author's Note}} A significant early [[point of divergence]] is that Heydrich survived the assassination attempt by Czech fighters in May 1942 ([[Operation Anthropoid|he was killed in reality]]) and later became head of the SS. Another significant divergence is the political career of Kennedy, who was, in real life, disgraced in 1940 during the [[Battle of Britain]]. In the novel, for an unexplained reason, his political fortunes did not suffer or possibly recovered after the German victory, and he eventually became US President. The Nazi offensives on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] ultimately push back the Soviet forces, with the [[Case Blue]] operation succeeding in capturing the [[Caucasus]] and cutting the [[Red Army]] off from its petroleum reserves by 1943.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=85|ps=; Part 2, chapter 5}} The Nazis also found that the [[Enigma machine]] code had been broken.

By 1964, the United States and the Greater German Reich are involved in a [[Cold War]].{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=85|ps=; Part 2, chapter 5}} The only exception is Switzerland, which retains its neutral status.\n\nThe [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] has died down into an endless guerrilla war in the [[Ural Mountains]] and [[Siberia]].{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=209|ps=; Part 3, chapter 7}} Mounting casualties (at least 100,000 since 1960, according to the novel{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=209|ps=; Part 3, chapter 7}}) have sapped the German military despite Hitler's statement, which is quoted in the novel, about a [[perpetual war]] to keep the [[German people]] on their toes. Dead German soldiers are returned to Germany in the middle of the night.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=209|ps=; Part 3, chapter 7}}\n\nThe action of the novel takes place from 14 to 20 April 1964, as Germany prepares for Hitler's 75th birthday celebrations on the latter date. A visit by US President Kennedy is planned as part of a gradual [[d\u00e9tente]] between the United States and the Germany. The novel suggests that the Nazi hierarchy is eager for peace since its efforts to settle the conquered East are failing because of continued resistance from [[Poland|Polish]] and Soviet partisan movements. Moreover, the Nazis failed to instil their ideology in the younger generation; many young German turn away from the regime though active opposition to the regime is limited.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=155|ps=; Part 3, chapter 3}}\n\n[[The Holocaust]] has been explained away officially as merely the relocation of the [[Jews]] into areas of [[Eastern Europe]], where communications and transport networks are still very poor. However, many Germans suspect the government to have eliminated the Jews but are generally unconcerned or too afraid of the authorities to say or to do anything. Some surviving Jews have escaped to the [[Soviet Union]] and provided testimony of the extermination efforts there. Nazi authorities decry Bolshevik propaganda, but the outside world is aware of the Holocaust. The American president, however, remains neutral to avoid further damaging relations and refers only to vague \"human rights violations\" that he wishes to investigate when he visits Berlin.\n\nThe end suggests that the plans of both Kennedy and Hitler might be seriously derailed by the documents obtained by the protagonists and successfully smuggled out of Germany by Charlie. Their publication gives concrete hard evidence on the systematic murder of the Jews and might cause the cancellation of the Hitler\u2013Kennedy summit and sabotage the plans for a German\u2013American d\u00e9tente on which the Nazis were counting for economic recovery. The documents might also cause Kennedy to lose re-election in November 1964. The novel does not mention who the opposing candidate is and the policies that the candidate supports, but it might be a more anti-Nazi Cold Warrior.\n\n===Greater German Reich and international politics===\n[[File:Fatherland's 1964 Europe.jpg|350px|right|thumb|''Fatherland''{{'}}s 1964 Europe]]\nThe first few pages of the novel feature two maps: one of the city centre of Berlin and another of the extent of the massively-expanded Greater German Reich, which stretches from [[Alsace-Lorraine]] (\"Westmark\") in the west to the [[Ural Mountains]] and lower [[Caucasus]] in the east.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|loc=Introduction}}\n\nThe Reich has retained [[Austria]] (now \"[[Ostmark (Austria)|Ostmark]]\"), [[Slovenia]], the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] and [[Luxembourg]] (now \"Moselland\"). In the East, Poland is still ruled as a colony by the [[General Government]], and Soviet territory west of the Urals has been divided into five Reichkommissariats: [[Reichskommissariat Ostland|Ostland]] ([[Belarus]] and the [[Baltic states]]), [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine|Ukraine]] with [[Odessa]], [[Reichskommissariat Moskau|Muscovy]] (from [[Moscow]] to the Urals), and [[Reichskommissariat Kaukasus|Caucasus]], along with ''Generalkommissariat Taurida'' (Southern Ukraine and the [[Crimea]]). There is also mention of a German naval base in [[Trondheim]], [[Norway]], where the Reich's nuclear submarines are based.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=40|ps=; Part 1, chapter 4}}\n\nBerlin has been remodelled as Hitler's \"[[Welthauptstadt Germania|capital of capitals]]\" and is designed according to the wishes of Hitler and his top architect, [[Albert Speer]],{{refn|group=note|Harris states the architectural description follows Speer's actual plans{{sfnp|Harris|2000|pp=385\u2013386|ps=; Author's Note}}}} and is the world's largest city, with a population of ten million, where the virtually-powerless \"European Parliament\" is based.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=188|ps=; Part 2, chapter 7}}\n\nIn the novel, the rest of Western and [[Northern Europe]], excluding Switzerland and [[Vatican City]], has been corralled by Germany into a European Community, which is made up of [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]], [[Francoist Spain|Spain]], [[France]], [[Ireland]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Belgium]], [[Netherlands]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]]. The map provided shows [[Andorra]] was annexed by Spain and [[San Marino]] by Italy, and [[Liechtenstein]] was absorbed directly into Nazi Germany, similar to [[Anschluss|Austria]]. Eastern Europe is dominated by Germany and includes [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]], [[Greece]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Italian protectorate of Albania (1939\u20131943)|Albania]] and [[Government of National Salvation|Serbia]]. The European Community, despite having nominally-free nations under their own governments and leaders, are presumably only just able to police their own territory, and they are under constant watch by Berlin and are subordinate to Germany in all but name. The [[flag of Nazi Germany|German flag]] over the headquarters is twice as big as those of the other nations.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=188|ps=; Part 2, chapter 7}}\n\nThe Reich had turned its eyes to Switzerland and sought to absorb its German-speaking [[cantons of Switzerland|cantons]], but the stalemate of the Cold War settled in. Switzerland thus became a convenient neutral spot for diplomacy and for American and German intelligence agents to spy on each other and is the last state in Europe with a foreign policy that is independent of Berlin. \nIn the backstory, the United States is locked in a Cold War with Germany. Since the end of the war in 1946, both superpowers have developed nuclear and space technologies. Japan was defeated by the United States by the detonation of the atomic bomb. The United States is said to have not participated in the [[Olympic Games]] since 1936 but is expected to return in 1964. The novel refer to the [[League of Nations]] or to the possible existence of the [[United Nations]].\n\nA passing remark hints at [[China]] being ruled by a harsh government, but its precise nature and its leader ate not mentioned. A greatly-reduced Soviet [[rump state]], consisting of Siberia, the [[Russian Far East]] and [[Soviet Central Asia|Central Asia]], still exists, with its capital in [[Omsk]]. The US supplies weapons and funds, which allow the Russians to tie down German forces in the Urals. Although German propaganda plays down the war on the Eastern Front, the war there is taking its toll.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=209|ps=; Part 3, chapter 7}}{{refn|group=note|[[Africa]] and [[Latin America]] are not referred to in the novel.}}\n\nCanada, [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] are now allied with the United States, and all of [[Latin America]] (excluding the pro-Axis \"neutral\" [[Argentina]]) are pro-American satellites. [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]] resides in Canada and is recognised by Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Latin America and the United States as the rightful queen of the United Kingdom. [[Winston Churchill]] also lives in Canada.\n\nThe novel describes that since the end of the war, a stalemate has developed between Germany and the United States, which seems to overshadow international relations. New German buildings are constructed with mandatory [[bomb shelters]], and the ''Reichsarchiv'' (German National Archive) claims to have been built to withstand a direct missile hit.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=112|ps=; Part 2, chapter 7}}{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=244|ps=; Part 4, chapter 3}}\n\n===Nazi society===\nIn the novel, Germany concentrates on the [[containment]] of the Soviet Union. Hitler has taken some steps to soften his image over the years and now usually wears civilian clothes, instead of the party uniform. Nonetheless, no substantive changes have taken place in the regime's basic character. The [[Reichstag Fire Decree]] and the [[Enabling Act of 1933]], the legal bases for Hitler's dictatorship, remain in effect. The press, the radio and the television are tightly controlled. Dissenters are still sent to [[List of German concentration camps|concentration camps]]. Conditions in the camps are reputed to be as harsh as they were in the 1930s and 1940s, but the [[International Red Cross]] is occasionally given staged inspections.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=324|ps=; Part 5, chapter 6}}\n\nIn the novel, the bedrock of Nazi ideology is still the policy of blaming subversive and minority groups for Germany's economic and social problems. Jews, [[communism|communists]], [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] and [[miscegenation|interracial relationships]] (particularly between \"[[Aryan]]s\" and [[Slavic peoples|Slav]]s) continue to be scapegoats for the Nazis.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=17|ps=; Part 1, chapter 2}} Propaganda has previously depicted the United States to be corrupt, degenerate and poor. However, the bearing g diplomatic meeting between Hitler and Kennedy forces German propaganda is forced to change to a more positive image of the US.\n\nDespite its ideological and moral decline, Germany has a high standard of living, with its citizens living off the produce of their European satellite states and freed from physical labour by thousands of [[Polish people|Polish]], [[Czech people|Czech]] and [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainian]] workers. The European nations export high-quality consumer goods to Germany (noted imports are domestic electronics from Britain) and also provide services, such as an [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] academy at [[Oxford University]] and imported domestic staff. Hitler's personal tastes in [[Nazi art|art and music]] remain the norm for German society.\n\nMilitary service is still compulsory.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=?|ps=; Part 3, chapter 3}} Eastern Europe has been colonised by German settlers although local [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] resistance movements are still active, and the German population has soared as a result of Nazi emphasis on childbirth. As the first generation of Nazi leaders, which founded the party and came to power alongside Hitler, begins to die off, Nazi officials are increasingly well-educated technocrats in the mould of [[Albert Speer]]. The police force (the ''[[Ordnungspolizei|Orpo]]'', or uniformed police, and the ''[[Kriminalpolizei|Kripo]]'', or criminal investigation bureau) is integrated with the SS, with police officers having honorary SS ranks.{{refn|group=note|The real-life integration occurred in 1936.}}\n\nAccording to the main characters, however, German society in the early 1960s is becoming more and more rebellious. The younger generation has no memory of the instability that paved the way for Hitler's rise to power. Student protests, particularly against the war in the Urals; American and British cultural influence and growing [[pacifism]] are all found in society. [[Jazz]] music is still popular, and the German government claims to have come up with a version which is free from \"[[Negro|Negroid]] influence\". In spite of the general repressiveness, [[the Beatles]]' real-life [[Hamburg]] engagements have happened here and already been denounced in the state-run press.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=40|ps=; Part 1, chapter 4}} Germany is under constant attack by terrorist groups, with officials assassinated and civilian airliners bombed in-flight. [[Christianity]] is suppressed, and [[Hitler Youth|Nazi youth organisations]] are compulsory for all children. Universities are centres of student dissent, and the [[White Rose]] movement is once again active.{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=155|ps=; Part 3, chapter 3}}\n\nThe Nazis continue with their policies for women by encouraging them to remain in the home and to bring up many children (that emphasises the first two elements of ''[[Kinder, K\u00fcche, Kirche]]''), but women are clearly present in the Nazi bureaucracy. Nazi organisations such as ''[[Strength Through Joy|Kraft durch Freude]]'' still exist and fulfill their original roles such as providing holidays to resort areas under German control. German citizens are still encouraged to contribute to the [[Winterhilfswerk]]. A sprawling transport network covers the entire Reich, including a vast [[autobahn]] and railway network in the manner of the real-life proposed ''[[Breitspurbahn]]'' system, which carries immense trains.\n\n===Technology===\nThe level of technology in the novel's 1960s is much the same as in real life. The [[German military]] uses [[jet aircraft]], [[nuclear submarines]],{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=40|ps=; Part 1, chapter 4}} and [[aircraft carriers]]; civilian technology has also advanced considerably. Jet airliners,{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=26|ps=; Part 1, chapter 3}} [[televisions]],{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=168|ps=; Part 3, chapter 3}} [[hair-dryer|hair-dryers]], [[coffee machines]] and [[photocopiers]]{{sfnp|Harris|2000|pp=251\u2013252|ps=; Part 4, chapter 4}} are used in Germany.\n\nBoth the United States and Germany appear to have sophisticated space technology. Germany's space program is based at the old rocket-testing facility at [[Peenem\u00fcnde]], on the Baltic coast. The extent of space exploration is not specified, but a conversation between March and Maguire suggests that German is justified in boasting about being ahead of the US in the [[Space Race]].{{sfnp|Harris|2000|p=209|ps=; Part 3, chapter 7}}\n\n==Critical evaluations==\nBritish scholar Nancy Browne noted the similarities between the ending of ''Fatherland'' and that of [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'': \"Both novels end with the protagonist about to embark on a single-handed armed confrontation with a large number of Fascists or Nazis, of whose outcome there can be no doubt - but the reader does not witness the moment of his presumed death. (...) Like Hemingway's Robert Jordan, Xavier March is facing this last moment with an exhilaration born of having no further doubts and dilemmas, no more crucial decisions which need to be made, nothing but going through on his chosen course and dying in a just cause. And like Jordan, in sacrificing himself March is ensuring the safe escape of the woman he loves.<ref>\"Dr. Nancy Browne, \"In the perspective of a half a century after the event: Anti-Fascist and Anti-Nazi Resistance in English-language Popular Culture\" in Tamara Baxter (ed.) \"Multi-Disciplinary Round Table on the Lasting Heritage of the Twentieth Century\"</ref>\n\nThe review by ''[[The Guardian]]'', written by John Mullan, notes that Harris acknowledged a debt to Len Deighton's ''[[SS-GB]]'' (1978), an earlier postwar alternative or \"counter-factual\" history that was set in Great Britain in late 1941 after the (fictional) British surrender.<ref>{{cite web |last=Mullan |first=John |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/30/guardian-bookclub-fatherland-robert-harris |title=Fatherland by Robert Harris \u2013 Week one: speculative fiction |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=30 March 2012 |accessdate=30 August 2019}}</ref> Part 2 of the review states that Harris' \"invention of a nightmarish alternative history is... compelling\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Mullan |first=John |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/06/book-club-fatherland-robert-harris |title=Fatherland by Robert Harris \u2013 Week two: discoveries |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=6 April 2012 |accessdate=30 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==In other media{{anchor|Film, TV or theatrical adaptations}}==\n\n===Film===\n{{main|Fatherland (1994 film)}}\nA [[Fatherland (1994 film)|TV film of the book]] was made in 1994 by [[Home Box Office|HBO]], starring [[Rutger Hauer]] as March and [[Miranda Richardson]] as Maguire for which she received a [[Golden Globe Award]] in [[52nd Golden Globe Awards|1995]] for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV.

Britain and France declared war on each other. The British in America suffered a string of defeats including [[Braddock expedition|Braddock's]] at the [[Battle of the Monongahela]] trying to capture [[Fort Dusquense]]. Encouraged by the French victories, American Indians launched a series of attacks along the colonial frontier.

This militia unit operated primarily in the [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]] and [[Lake Champlain]] regions of New York. They frequently undertook winter raids against French towns and military emplacements, traveling on sleds, crude snowshoes, and even ice skates across frozen rivers. Rogers' Rangers were never fully respected by the British regulars, yet they were one of the few non-Indian forces able to operate in the inhospitable region despite harsh winter conditions and mountainous terrain.<ref name=\"RBlack\"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Lurps: A Ranger's Diary of Tet, Khe Sanh, A Shau, and Quang Tri |first=Robert |last=Ankony |year=2009 |edition=revised |location=Lanham, Mass. |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishing Group |page=177 |isbn=978-0-76184-372-6}}</ref>\n\nRogers showed an unusual talent for commanding his unit in conditions to which the regular armies of the day were unaccustomed. He took the initiative in mustering, equipping, and commanding ranger units. He wrote an early guide for commanding such units as [[Robert Rogers' 28 \"Rules of Ranging\"]]. The [[Queen's York Rangers]] of the Canadian Army, the [[U.S. Army Rangers]], and the [[1st Battalion 119th Field Artillery]] all claim Rogers as their founder, and \"[[Rangers Standing Orders|Rogers' Standing Orders]]\" are still quoted on the first page of the U.S. Army's Ranger handbook.\n\nRogers was personally responsible for paying his soldiers, and he went deeply into debt and took loans to ensure that they were paid properly after their regular pay was raided during transport. He was never compensated by the British Army or government, though he had reason to believe that he should have his expenses reimbursed.<ref name=\"Bahmanyar\"/>\n\n===Northern campaign===\n:''For more details on this topic, see [[Battle on Snowshoes (1757)]], [[Battle on Snowshoes]] and [[Battle of Carillon]]''.\nFrom 1755 to 1758, Rogers and his rangers served under a series of unsuccessful British commanders operating over the northern accesses to the British colonies: Major General [[Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet|William Johnson]], Major General [[William Shirley]], Colonel [[William Haviland]], and Major General [[James Abercrombie (general)|James Abercromby]]. At the time, the British could do little more than fight defensive campaigns around [[Lake Champlain]], [[Fort Crown Point|Crown Point]], [[Fort Ticonderoga|Ticonderoga]], and the upper [[Hudson River|Hudson]].<ref name=\"test\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/index.php/content/wilderness-ordeal |title=Wilderness Ordeal |first=John F. |last=Ross |magazine=[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]] |date=Summer 2009 |volume=59 |issue=2}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time, the rangers proved indispensable; they grew gradually to twelve companies, as well as several additional contingents of Indians who had pledged their allegiance to the British cause. The rangers were kept organizationally distinct from British regulars. Rogers was their acting commandant, as well as the direct commander of his own company.\n\nOn 21 January 1757 at the [[Battle on Snowshoes (1757)|First Battle of the Snowshoes]], Rogers' Rangers ambushed and captured seven [[Canadiens]] near [[Fort Carillon]] but then encountered a hundred French and Canadian militia and Ottawa Indians from the [[Ohio Country]]. Roger's forces retreated after taking casualties of 14 killed, nine wounded, and six missing or captured; the French-Indian forces were 11 killed, 27 wounded.\n\nBritish forces [[Battle of Fort William Henry|surrendered Fort William Henry]] in August 1757, after which the Rangers were stationed on [[Rogers Island (New York)|Rogers Island]] near [[Fort Edward (village), New York|Fort Edward]]. This allowed them to train and operate with more freedom than the regular British forces.\n\nOn 13 March 1758 at the [[Battle on Snowshoes|Second Battle of the Snowshoes]], Rogers' Rangers ambushed a French and Indian column and, in turn, were ambushed by enemy forces. The Rangers lost 125 men in this encounter, as well as eight men wounded, with 52 surviving.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usgennet.org/usa/topic/colonial/rogers/snowshoes.html |first=Mary Cochrane |last=Rogers |title=A Battle Fought on Snow Shoes |website=USGenNet |year=1917 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504005656/http://www.usgennet.org/usa/topic/colonial/rogers/snowshoes.html |archivedate=4 May 2006}}</ref> Rogers estimated 100 killed and nearly 100 wounded of the French-Indian forces; however, the French listed casualties as a total of ten Indians killed and seventeen wounded.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dmna.state.ny.us/historic/articles/snowshoe2.htm |title=Frigid Fury: The Battle on Snowshoes, March 1758 |page=2 |website=The New York State Military Museum |accessdate=29 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 7 July 1758, Rogers' Rangers took part in the Battle of [[Carillon| Ticonderoga]].\n\n[[File:Abenakis.jpg|thumb|[[Abenakis]] (18th-century)]]\n\nIn 1758, Abercromby recognized Rogers' accomplishments by promoting him to [[Major]], with the equally famous [[John Stark]] as his second in command. Rogers now held two ranks appropriate to his double role: Captain and Major.\n\nIn 1759, the tide of the war turned and the British advanced on [[Quebec City|the city of Quebec]]. Major General [[Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffrey Amherst]], the newly appointed [[Commander-in-Chief, North America|Commander-in-Chief of British forces in North America]], had a brilliant and definitive idea. He dispatched Rogers and his rangers on an expedition far behind enemy lines to the west against the [[Abenaki]]s at [[Saint-Fran\u00e7ois-du-Lac, Quebec|Saint-Francis]] in [[Quebec]], a staging base for Indian raids into New England. Rogers led a force of two hundred rangers from [[Crown Point, New York|Crown Point]], New York, deep into French territory to Saint-Francis.\n\nAt this time, the Indians near Saint-Francis had given up their aboriginal way of life and were living in a town next to a French mission. Rogers [[St. Francis Raid|burned the town]] and claimed to have killed 200; the actual number was 30 killed and 5 captured. Rogers losses were 41 killed; 7 wounded 10 captured. Following the 3 October 1759 attack and successful destruction of Saint-Francis, Rogers' force ran out of food during their retreat back through the rugged wilderness of northern [[Vermont]]. The Rangers reached a safe location along the [[Connecticut River]] at the abandoned [[Fort Wentworth]]. Rogers left them encamped, and returned a few days later with food and relief forces from [[Fort at Number 4]], now [[Charlestown, New Hampshire]], the nearest British town.\n\nThe destruction of Saint-Francis by Rogers was a major psychological victory, as the colonists no longer felt that they were helpless. The residents of Saint-Francis, a combined group of Abenakis and others, understood that they were no longer beyond reach. Abenaki raids along the frontier did not cease, but significantly diminished.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"140px\">\nFile:Ticonderoga1.jpg|[[Fort Ticonderoga]]<br />([[Battle of Carillon|Fort Carillon]])\nFile:Dscn3099_connecticut_river_french_king_bridge.jpg|[[Connecticut River]] in [[Massachusetts]]\nFile:Plaine_abraham_quebec.jpg|[[Plains of Abraham]] in [[Quebec]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Montreal Campaign===\n{{further|Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raid|Montreal Campaign}}\n[[File:Robert Monckton - Project Gutenberg etext 20110.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Monckton]] was Rogers' superior officer during the western campaign]]\n\n[[Quebec]] fell in 1759 and in the Spring of 1760 Rogers joined in Amherst's campaign on Montreal but before doing so conducted a successful preemptive raid on [[Fort Sainte Th\u00e9r\u00e8se]] in June which was used to supply the French army as well as being a vital link in the communication and supply line between [[Fort Saint-Jean (Quebec)|Fort Saint-Jean]] and the French forces at [[\u00cele aux Noix]]. \n\nRoger's was then part of [[William Haviland]]'s thrust (one of three all led by Amherst) on [[Montreal]] in August where it marched from [[Lake Ontario]] in the west along the [[Saint Lawrence River]] and from upper New York via the [[Richelieu River]]. Along the way Rogers fought to reduce [[\u00cele aux Noix]] which succeeded in a ruse attack. Soon after Fort Saint Jean was burned by the French; and Chambly was seized. The Rangers then led the final advance on Montreal which surrendered without a fight the following month.\n\n===Western campaign===\n{{further|Fort Detroit|Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)}}\nRogers then advanced with Indian activity ceased against colonials in the east, and Rogers' service there was over. General Amherst transferred him to Brigadier General [[Robert Monckton]], commanding at [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]] (formerly [[Fort Duquesne]]). Following Amherst's advice, Monckton sent the rangers to capture [[Detroit]], far to the north, which they did.\n\nOn 29 November 1760 in Detroit, Rogers received the submission of the French posts on the [[Great Lakes]]; during the spring 1761, Rogers and his Rangers occupied Fort Michilimackinac and Fort St. Joseph. It was the final act of his command. Shortly thereafter, his rangers were disbanded. Monckton offered Rogers command of a company of regulars in [[South Carolina]] but, after visiting the place, Rogers chose instead to command another company in New York. That unit was soon disbanded, however, and Rogers was forced into retirement at half-pay.\n\nNo longer preoccupied with military affairs, Rogers returned to New England to marry Elizabeth Browne in June, 1761, and set up housekeeping with her in [[Concord, New Hampshire]]. Like many New Englanders, they had [[indentured servants]] and slaves, including an Indian boy captured at Saint-Francis.\n\nSome historians{{who|date=May 2011}} claim that the state of Rogers' finances at this time is not compatible with what he and others professed it to be later. Rogers received large grants of land in southern New Hampshire in compensation for his services. He sold much of it at a profit and was able to purchase and maintain slaves. He deeded much of his land to his wife's family, which served to support her later.\n\nIn peacetime, Rogers was a restless spirit. The colonists were in the process of quelling Indian operations piecemeal. Late in 1761, he accepted command of a company of mercenaries for the purpose of \"pacifying\" the [[Cherokee]]s in North Carolina, after which he returned home.\n\nOn 10 February 1763, the [[French and Indian War]] came to an end with the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] (also known as the ''Treaty of 1763''). Rogers found himself once more a soldier of fortune, still on half-pay. Later, General [[Thomas Gage]] remarked that, if the army had put him on whole pay, they could have prevented his later unfit employment (Gage's terms).\n\n==Pontiac's Rebellion==\n:''For more details on this topic, see [[Siege of Fort Detroit]] and [[Battle of Bloody Run]]''.\n\n[[File:Pontiac's war region.png|thumb|The main theater of operations during Pontiac's Rebellion]]\n\nOn 7 May 1763, [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] erupted in [[Michigan]]. [[Odawa]] war-leader [[Pontiac (Ottawa leader)|Pontiac]] attempted to capture [[Fort Detroit]] by surprise with a force of 300 warriors. However, the British commander was aware of Pontiac's plan, and his garrison was armed and ready. Undaunted, Pontiac withdrew and laid siege to the fort. Eventually, more than 900 Indian warriors from a half-dozen tribes joined the siege of Fort Detroit.\n\nUpon hearing this news, Rogers offered his services to General [[Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffrey Amherst]]. Rogers then accompanied Captain James Dalyell with a relief force to [[Fort Detroit]]. Their ill-fated mission was terminated at the [[Battle of Bloody Run]] on 31 July 1763.\n\nIn an attempt to break [[Chief Pontiac|Pontiac's]] [[siege of Fort Detroit|siege]], about 250 British troops led by Dalyell and Rogers attempted a surprise attack on his encampment. However, Pontiac was ready, supposedly alerted by French settlers, and he defeated the British at Parent's Creek two miles north of the fort. The creek or ''run'' was said to have run red with the blood of the 20 dead and 34 wounded British soldiers and was henceforth known as Bloody Run. Captain James Dalyell was one of those killed.\n\nSoon after these events, Pontiac's rebellion collapsed and [[Chief Pontiac]] himself faded away into obscurity and death. Surprisingly, Rogers later memorialized Pontiac and his rebellion in a stage play during his sojourn in England.\n\n==Post-war success and failure==\nRogers had brought total dedication to his position as commander of the rangers. As was often the custom in the British and American armies, he had spent his own money to equip the rangers when needed and consequently had gone into debt. In 1764, he was faced with the problem of repaying his creditors.\n\nTo recoup his finances, Robert engaged briefly in a business venture with the fur trader, [[John Askin]], near Detroit. After it failed, he hoped to win the money by gambling, with the result that he was totally ruined. His creditors put him in prison for debt in New York, but he escaped.\n\n===Author in Britain===\nIn 1765, Rogers voyaged to England to obtain pay for his service and capitalize on his fame. His journals and ''A Concise Account of North America''<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/aconciseaccount00rogeuoft |title=A Concise Account of North America |last=Rogers |first=Robert |year=1765 |publisher=J. Millan |location=London |accessdate=27 March 2008}}</ref> were published. Immediately thereafter, he wrote the stage play ''Ponteach ''[Pontiac]'': or the Savages of America'' (1766), significant as an early American drama and for its sympathetic portrayal of American Indians. He enjoyed some moderate success with his publications (though Ponteach was condemned by the critics) and attracted royal attention. He had an audience with King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], to whom he proposed undertaking an expedition to find the [[Northwest Passage]]. The King appointed Rogers governor of [[Fort Michilimackinac|Michilimackinac]] ([[Mackinaw City, Michigan]]) with a charter to look for the passage, and he returned to North America.\n\n===Royal Governor===\nUpon his return to America, Rogers moved with his wife to the fur-trading outpost of [[Fort Michilimackinac]] and began his duties as royal governor. During Rogers' absence, Amherst had been replaced by [[Thomas Gage]] as commander of the British forces in America, and Gage was a bitter rival of Amherst. Rogers was a loyal friend of Amherst and was consequently hated by Gage.\n\n[[File:Thomas Gage.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Gage]] bitterly disliked Rogers due to his close friendship with [[Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffrey Amherst]], Gage's rival]]\n\nAs an aristocrat and political intriguer, Gage viewed Rogers as a provincial upstart who posed a threat to his newly acquired power, due to his friendship with Amherst. At the time, Rogers was still a half-pay captain in the British army and, to some degree, under Gage's military jurisdiction. However, Gage could not challenge Rogers, the king's appointee, unless he could find a good reason, as the king would countermand any legal process in order to save his favorites. Knowing this, Gage actively set about finding a solid justification to remove Rogers as royal governor in a way that would forestall royal intervention.\n\nUnaware of Gage's plotting, Rogers continued performing his administrative duties with considerable zest. He dispatched expeditions to search for the fabled [[Northwest Passage]] under [[Jonathan Carver]] and James Tute, but they were unsuccessful and the path to the Pacific Ocean remained undiscovered until the expedition led by [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander MacKenzie]] in 1793.\n\nRogers perceived a need for unity and a stronger government, and he negotiated with the Indians, parlayed with the French, and developed a plan for a province in Michigan to be administered by a governor and Privy Council reporting to the king. This plan was supported by George III, but had little chance of being adopted, since Parliament had no intention of increasing the king's power.\n\nMeanwhile, Gage used every opportunity to defame Rogers, portraying him as an opportunist who had gotten rich on the war only to gamble away his money as a profligate. It is difficult to say how many of these allegations were true and how much Gage believed them to be true. Gage apparently saw Rogers as of questionable loyalty\u2014certainly he was not loyal to Gage\u2014and therefore he needed watching. Rogers' dealings with the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]]s troubled Gage, as he and many other British officers in America had come to regard the Indians with great suspicion.\n\n===Arrest for treason===\nGage hired spies to intercept Rogers' mail and suborned his subordinates. Unfortunately, Rogers offended his private secretary Nathaniel Potter, and Potter gave Gage the excuse that he needed. Potter swore in an affidavit that Rogers said that he would offer his province to the French if the British government failed to approve his plan of governance.\n\nPotter's claims are questionable. The French were not in any position to receive Rogers, with a British governor sitting in Montreal. Nevertheless, on the strength of Potter's affidavit, Rogers was arrested in 1767, charged with treason, and taken to Montreal in chains for trial. This trial was postponed until 1768. Elizabeth, carrying their only child, went home to [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]]. This son became a lawyer in Portsmouth and had a family that has descended to modern times.\n\n===Vindication===\n\n[[File:Amherst.jpg|thumb|Field Marshal [[Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffrey Amherst]] was a close friend of Rogers and was instrumental in vindicating him of Gage's charges of treason]]\n\nGage sent Rogers to Montreal to stand trial but, once there, Rogers was among friends of Amherst. Due to Amherst's influence, Rogers was acquitted of all charges and the verdict was sent to King George III for approval. The king approved, but could not call Gage a liar openly. Instead, he made a note that there was reason to think Rogers might have been treasonous.\n\nReturning to Michigan under the power of Gage was unthinkable; hence, Rogers went to England in 1769 to petition again for debt relief. However, the king had done all he would for Rogers and was preoccupied by the issue of the dissatisfied colonies. Rogers went again to debtors' prison and tried suing Gage for false imprisonment. Gage settled out of court by offering Rogers the half-pay of a major in return for dropping the suit.\n\n===American Revolutionary War===\nBecause of his legal troubles in England, Robert Rogers missed the major events in the disaffected colonies. He heard that revolution was likely to break out and returned to America in 1775. The Americans were as out of touch with Rogers as he was with them, looking upon him as the noted ranger leader and expecting him to behave as one; they were at a total loss to explain his drunken and licentious behavior. At that time, Rogers was perhaps suffering from the alcoholism that blighted his later life and led to the loss of his family, land, money, and friends.\n\nIt is unclear exactly what transpired between the revolutionary leaders and Rogers. Rogers was arrested by the local Committee of Safety as a possible spy and released on parole that he would not serve against the colonies. He was offered a commission in the Revolutionary Army by the [[Continental Congress]], but declined on the grounds that he was a British officer. He later wrote to [[George Washington]] asking for a command, but instead Washington had him arrested.\n\nHe escaped from Washington's custody only to find revolutionary ranks firm against him, so he offered his services to the British Army. They also were hoping that he would live up to his reputation. In August 1776, he formed another ranger-type unit called the [[Queen's Rangers]] as its colonel.<ref>{{cite book |last=Katcher |first=Philip R.

A contemporaneous account of Hale's capture is in the [[Library of Congress]], written by [[Consider Tiffany]], a Connecticut shopkeeper and Loyalist. In Tiffany's account, Rogers did not believe Hale's cover story that he was a teacher, and lured him into his own betrayal by pretending to be a patriot spy himself.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0307-8/hale.html |first=James |last=Hutson |title=Nathan Hale Revisited: A Tory's Account of the Arrest of the First American Spy |journal=Information Bulletin |date=August 2003 |volume=62 |number=7 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=29 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h550.html |title=Nathan Hale |website=U.S. History.com |accessdate=29 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanrevolution.com/NathanHale.htm |title=Nathan Hale, American Patriot |website=American Revolution |date=2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421202900/http://www.americanrevolution.com/NathanHale.htm |archivedate=21 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1777, the British Army forcibly retired Rogers on grounds of \"poor health\". A return home now was impossible; Hale's execution and Rogers raising troops against the colonials seemed to confirm Washington's suspicions. At Washington's prompting, the New Hampshire legislature passed two decrees regarding Rogers: one a proscription and the other a divorce from his wife on grounds of abandonment and infidelity. She could not afford any friendship or mercy toward Robert now if she expected to remain in New Hampshire. Later, Elizabeth married American naval officer John Roche. She died in 1811.\n\n==Final return to England==\nAfter a brief sojourn in England, Rogers returned in 1779 to raise the [[King's Rangers]] in Nova Scotia, Canada for [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|General Sir Henry Clinton]]. He was unable to keep the position due to his alcoholism, and his place was taken by his brother [[James Rogers (soldier)|James]]. Now he was of no further use to the British army. He was snared by an American privateer and spent some time in a prison in New York, escaping in 1782. In 1783, he was evacuated with other British troops to England. There, he was unable to earn a living or to defeat his alcoholism. He died in obscurity and debt in 1795, what little money he had going to pay an arrears in rent. He was buried in London but his gravesite has been lost.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/50372309 |title=Capt. Robert E.

This militia unit operated primarily in the [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]] and [[Lake Champlain]] regions of New York. They frequently undertook winter raids against French towns and military emplacements, traveling on sleds, crude snowshoes, and even ice skates across frozen rivers. Rogers' Rangers were never fully respected by the British regulars, yet they were one of the few non-Indian forces able to operate in the inhospitable region despite harsh winter conditions and mountainous terrain.<ref name=\"RBlack\"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Lurps: A Ranger's Diary of Tet, Khe Sanh, A Shau, and Quang Tri |first=Robert |last=Ankony |year=2009 |edition=revised |location=Lanham, Mass. |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishing Group |page=177 |isbn=978-0-76184-372-6}}</ref>\n\nRogers showed an unusual talent for commanding his unit in conditions to which the regular armies of the day were unaccustomed. He took the initiative in mustering, equipping, and commanding ranger units. He wrote an early guide for commanding such units as [[Robert Rogers' 28 \"Rules of Ranging\"]]. The [[Queen's York Rangers]] of the Canadian Army, the [[U.S. Army Rangers]], and the [[1st Battalion 119th Field Artillery]] all claim Rogers as their founder, and \"[[Rangers Standing Orders|Rogers' Standing Orders]]\" are still quoted on the first page of the U.S. Army's Ranger handbook.\n\nRogers was personally responsible for paying his soldiers, and he went deeply into debt and took loans to ensure that they were paid properly after their regular pay was raided during transport. He was never compensated by the British Army or government, though he had reason to believe that he should have his expenses reimbursed.<ref name=\"Bahmanyar\"/>\n\n===Northern campaign===\n:''For more details on this topic, see [[Battle on Snowshoes (1757)]], [[Battle on Snowshoes]] and [[Battle of Carillon]]''.\nFrom 1755 to 1758, Rogers and his rangers served under a series of unsuccessful British commanders operating over the northern accesses to the British colonies: Major General [[Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet|William Johnson]], Major General [[William Shirley]], Colonel [[William Haviland]], and Major General [[James Abercrombie (general)|James Abercromby]]. At the time, the British could do little more than fight defensive campaigns around [[Lake Champlain]], [[Fort Crown Point|Crown Point]], [[Fort Ticonderoga|Ticonderoga]], and the upper [[Hudson River|Hudson]].<ref name=\"test\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/index.php/content/wilderness-ordeal |title=Wilderness Ordeal |first=John F. |last=Ross |magazine=[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]] |date=Summer 2009 |volume=59 |issue=2}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time, the rangers proved indispensable; they grew gradually to twelve companies, as well as several additional contingents of Indians who had pledged their allegiance to the British cause. The rangers were kept organizationally distinct from British regulars. Rogers was their acting commandant, as well as the direct commander of his own company.\n\nOn 21 January 1757 at the [[Battle on Snowshoes (1757)|First Battle of the Snowshoes]], Rogers' Rangers ambushed and captured seven [[Canadiens]] near [[Fort Carillon]] but then encountered a hundred French and Canadian militia and Ottawa Indians from the [[Ohio Country]]. Roger's forces retreated after taking casualties of 14 killed, nine wounded, and six missing or captured; the French-Indian forces were 11 killed, 27 wounded.\n\nBritish forces [[Battle of Fort William Henry|surrendered Fort William Henry]] in August 1757, after which the Rangers were stationed on [[Rogers Island (New York)|Rogers Island]] near [[Fort Edward (village), New York|Fort Edward]]. This allowed them to train and operate with more freedom than the regular British forces.\n\nOn 13 March 1758 at the [[Battle on Snowshoes|Second Battle of the Snowshoes]], Rogers' Rangers ambushed a French and Indian column and, in turn, were ambushed by enemy forces. The Rangers lost 125 men in this encounter, as well as eight men wounded, with 52 surviving.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usgennet.org/usa/topic/colonial/rogers/snowshoes.html |first=Mary Cochrane |last=Rogers |title=A Battle Fought on Snow Shoes |website=USGenNet |year=1917 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504005656/http://www.usgennet.org/usa/topic/colonial/rogers/snowshoes.html |archivedate=4 May 2006}}</ref> Rogers estimated 100 killed and nearly 100 wounded of the French-Indian forces; however, the French listed casualties as a total of ten Indians killed and seventeen wounded.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dmna.state.ny.us/historic/articles/snowshoe2.htm |title=Frigid Fury: The Battle on Snowshoes, March 1758 |page=2 |website=The New York State Military Museum |accessdate=29 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 7 July 1758, Rogers' Rangers took part in the Battle of [[Carillon| Ticonderoga]].\n\n[[File:Abenakis.jpg|thumb|[[Abenakis]] (18th-century)]]\n\nIn 1758, Abercromby recognized Rogers' accomplishments by promoting him to [[Major]], with the equally famous [[John Stark]] as his second in command. Rogers now held two ranks appropriate to his double role: Captain and Major.\n\nIn 1759, the tide of the war turned and the British advanced on [[Quebec City|the city of Quebec]]. Major General [[Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffrey Amherst]], the newly appointed [[Commander-in-Chief, North America|Commander-in-Chief of British forces in North America]], had a brilliant and definitive idea. He dispatched Rogers and his rangers on an expedition far behind enemy lines to the west against the [[Abenaki]]s at [[Saint-Fran\u00e7ois-du-Lac, Quebec|Saint-Francis]] in [[Quebec]], a staging base for Indian raids into New England. Rogers led a force of two hundred rangers from [[Crown Point, New York|Crown Point]], New York, deep into French territory to Saint-Francis.\n\nAt this time, the Indians near Saint-Francis had given up their aboriginal way of life and were living in a town next to a French mission. Rogers [[St. Francis Raid|burned the town]] and claimed to have killed 200; the actual number was 30 killed and 5 captured. Rogers losses were 41 killed; 7 wounded 10 captured. Following the 3 October 1759 attack and successful destruction of Saint-Francis, Rogers' force ran out of food during their retreat back through the rugged wilderness of northern [[Vermont]]. The Rangers reached a safe location along the [[Connecticut River]] at the abandoned [[Fort Wentworth]]. Rogers left them encamped, and returned a few days later with food and relief forces from [[Fort at Number 4]], now [[Charlestown, New Hampshire]], the nearest British town.\n\nThe destruction of Saint-Francis by Rogers was a major psychological victory, as the colonists no longer felt that they were helpless. The residents of Saint-Francis, a combined group of Abenakis and others, understood that they were no longer beyond reach. Abenaki raids along the frontier did not cease, but significantly diminished.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"140px\">\nFile:Ticonderoga1.jpg|[[Fort Ticonderoga]]<br />([[Battle of Carillon|Fort Carillon]])\nFile:Dscn3099_connecticut_river_french_king_bridge.jpg|[[Connecticut River]] in [[Massachusetts]]\nFile:Plaine_abraham_quebec.jpg|[[Plains of Abraham]] in [[Quebec]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Montreal Campaign===\n{{further|Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raid|Montreal Campaign}}\n[[File:Robert Monckton - Project Gutenberg etext 20110.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Monckton]] was Rogers' superior officer during the western campaign]]\n\n[[Quebec]] fell in 1759 and in the Spring of 1760 Rogers joined in Amherst's campaign on Montreal but before doing so conducted a successful preemptive raid on [[Fort Sainte Th\u00e9r\u00e8se]] in June which was used to supply the French army as well as being a vital link in the communication and supply line between [[Fort Saint-Jean (Quebec)|Fort Saint-Jean]] and the French forces at [[\u00cele aux Noix]]. \n\nRoger's was then part of [[William Haviland]]'s thrust (one of three all led by Amherst) on [[Montreal]] in August where it marched from [[Lake Ontario]] in the west along the [[Saint Lawrence River]] and from upper New York via the [[Richelieu River]]. Along the way Rogers fought to reduce [[\u00cele aux Noix]] which succeeded in a ruse attack. Soon after Fort Saint Jean was burned by the French; and Chambly was seized. The Rangers then led the final advance on Montreal which surrendered without a fight the following month.\n\n===Western campaign===\n{{further|Fort Detroit|Fort Pitt}}\nRogers then advanced with Indian activity ceased against colonials in the east, and Rogers' service there was over. General Amherst transferred him to Brigadier General [[Robert Monckton]], commanding at [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]] (formerly [[Fort Duquesne]]). Following Amherst's advice, Monckton sent the rangers to capture [[Detroit]], far to the north, which they did.\n\nOn 29 November 1760 in Detroit, Rogers received the submission of the French posts on the [[Great Lakes]]; during the spring 1761, Rogers and his Rangers occupied Fort Michilimackinac and Fort St. Joseph. It was the final act of his command. Shortly thereafter, his rangers were disbanded. Monckton offered Rogers command of a company of regulars in [[South Carolina]] but, after visiting the place, Rogers chose instead to command another company in New York. That unit was soon disbanded, however, and Rogers was forced into retirement at half-pay.\n\nNo longer preoccupied with military affairs, Rogers returned to New England to marry Elizabeth Browne in June, 1761, and set up housekeeping with her in [[Concord, New Hampshire]]. Like many New Englanders, they had [[indentured servants]] and slaves, including an Indian boy captured at Saint-Francis.\n\nSome historians{{who|date=May 2011}} claim that the state of Rogers' finances at this time is not compatible with what he and others professed it to be later. Rogers received large grants of land in southern New Hampshire in compensation for his services. He sold much of it at a profit and was able to purchase and maintain slaves. He deeded much of his land to his wife's family, which served to support her later.\n\nIn peacetime, Rogers was a restless spirit. The colonists were in the process of quelling Indian operations piecemeal. Late in 1761, he accepted command of a company of mercenaries for the purpose of \"pacifying\" the [[Cherokee]]s in North Carolina, after which he returned home.\n\nOn 10 February 1763, the [[French and Indian War]] came to an end with the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] (also known as the ''Treaty of 1763''). Rogers found himself once more a soldier of fortune, still on half-pay. Later, General [[Thomas Gage]] remarked that, if the army had put him on whole pay, they could have prevented his later unfit employment (Gage's terms).\n\n==Pontiac's Rebellion==\n:''For more details on this topic, see [[Siege of Fort Detroit]] and [[Battle of Bloody Run]]''.\n\n[[File:Pontiac's war region.png|thumb|The main theater of operations during Pontiac's Rebellion]]\n\nOn 7 May 1763, [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] erupted in [[Michigan]]. [[Odawa]] war-leader [[Pontiac (Ottawa leader)|Pontiac]] attempted to capture [[Fort Detroit]] by surprise with a force of 300 warriors. However, the British commander was aware of Pontiac's plan, and his garrison was armed and ready. Undaunted, Pontiac withdrew and laid siege to the fort. Eventually, more than 900 Indian warriors from a half-dozen tribes joined the siege of Fort Detroit.\n\nUpon hearing this news, Rogers offered his services to General [[Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffrey Amherst]]. Rogers then accompanied Captain James Dalyell with a relief force to [[Fort Detroit]]. Their ill-fated mission was terminated at the [[Battle of Bloody Run]] on 31 July 1763.\n\nIn an attempt to break [[Chief Pontiac|Pontiac's]] [[siege of Fort Detroit|siege]], about 250 British troops led by Dalyell and Rogers attempted a surprise attack on his encampment. However, Pontiac was ready, supposedly alerted by French settlers, and he defeated the British at Parent's Creek two miles north of the fort. The creek or ''run'' was said to have run red with the blood of the 20 dead and 34 wounded British soldiers and was henceforth known as Bloody Run. Captain James Dalyell was one of those killed.\n\nSoon after these events, Pontiac's rebellion collapsed and [[Chief Pontiac]] himself faded away into obscurity and death. Surprisingly, Rogers later memorialized Pontiac and his rebellion in a stage play during his sojourn in England.\n\n==Post-war success and failure==\nRogers had brought total dedication to his position as commander of the rangers. As was often the custom in the British and American armies, he had spent his own money to equip the rangers when needed and consequently had gone into debt. In 1764, he was faced with the problem of repaying his creditors.\n\nTo recoup his finances, Robert engaged briefly in a business venture with the fur trader, [[John Askin]], near Detroit. After it failed, he hoped to win the money by gambling, with the result that he was totally ruined. His creditors put him in prison for debt in New York, but he escaped.\n\n===Author in Britain===\nIn 1765, Rogers voyaged to England to obtain pay for his service and capitalize on his fame. His journals and ''A Concise Account of North America''<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/aconciseaccount00rogeuoft |title=A Concise Account of North America |last=Rogers |first=Robert |year=1765 |publisher=J. Millan |location=London |accessdate=27 March 2008}}</ref> were published. Immediately thereafter, he wrote the stage play ''Ponteach ''[Pontiac]'': or the Savages of America'' (1766), significant as an early American drama and for its sympathetic portrayal of American Indians. He enjoyed some moderate success with his publications (though Ponteach was condemned by the critics) and attracted royal attention. He had an audience with King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], to whom he proposed undertaking an expedition to find the [[Northwest Passage]]. The King appointed Rogers governor of [[Fort Michilimackinac|Michilimackinac]] ([[Mackinaw City, Michigan]]) with a charter to look for the passage, and he returned to North America.\n\n===Royal Governor===\nUpon his return to America, Rogers moved with his wife to the fur-trading outpost of [[Fort Michilimackinac]] and began his duties as royal governor. During Rogers' absence, Amherst had been replaced by [[Thomas Gage]] as commander of the British forces in America, and Gage was a bitter rival of Amherst. Rogers was a loyal friend of Amherst and was consequently hated by Gage.\n\n[[File:Thomas Gage.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Gage]] bitterly disliked Rogers due to his close friendship with [[Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffrey Amherst]], Gage's rival]]\n\nAs an aristocrat and political intriguer, Gage viewed Rogers as a provincial upstart who posed a threat to his newly acquired power, due to his friendship with Amherst. At the time, Rogers was still a half-pay captain in the British army and, to some degree, under Gage's military jurisdiction. However, Gage could not challenge Rogers, the king's appointee, unless he could find a good reason, as the king would countermand any legal process in order to save his favorites. Knowing this, Gage actively set about finding a solid justification to remove Rogers as royal governor in a way that would forestall royal intervention.\n\nUnaware of Gage's plotting, Rogers continued performing his administrative duties with considerable zest. He dispatched expeditions to search for the fabled [[Northwest Passage]] under [[Jonathan Carver]] and James Tute, but they were unsuccessful and the path to the Pacific Ocean remained undiscovered until the expedition led by [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander MacKenzie]] in 1793.\n\nRogers perceived a need for unity and a stronger government, and he negotiated with the Indians, parlayed with the French, and developed a plan for a province in Michigan to be administered by a governor and Privy Council reporting to the king. This plan was supported by George III, but had little chance of being adopted, since Parliament had no intention of increasing the king's power.\n\nMeanwhile, Gage used every opportunity to defame Rogers, portraying him as an opportunist who had gotten rich on the war only to gamble away his money as a profligate. It is difficult to say how many of these allegations were true and how much Gage believed them to be true. Gage apparently saw Rogers as of questionable loyalty\u2014certainly he was not loyal to Gage\u2014and therefore he needed watching. Rogers' dealings with the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]]s troubled Gage, as he and many other British officers in America had come to regard the Indians with great suspicion.\n\n===Arrest for treason===\nGage hired spies to intercept Rogers' mail and suborned his subordinates. Unfortunately, Rogers offended his private secretary Nathaniel Potter, and Potter gave Gage the excuse that he needed. Potter swore in an affidavit that Rogers said that he would offer his province to the French if the British government failed to approve his plan of governance.\n\nPotter's claims are questionable. The French were not in any position to receive Rogers, with a British governor sitting in Montreal. Nevertheless, on the strength of Potter's affidavit, Rogers was arrested in 1767, charged with treason, and taken to Montreal in chains for trial. This trial was postponed until 1768. Elizabeth, carrying their only child, went home to [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]]. This son became a lawyer in Portsmouth and had a family that has descended to modern times.\n\n===Vindication===\n\n[[File:Amherst.jpg|thumb|Field Marshal [[Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffrey Amherst]] was a close friend of Rogers and was instrumental in vindicating him of Gage's charges of treason]]\n\nGage sent Rogers to Montreal to stand trial but, once there, Rogers was among friends of Amherst. Due to Amherst's influence, Rogers was acquitted of all charges and the verdict was sent to King George III for approval. The king approved, but could not call Gage a liar openly. Instead, he made a note that there was reason to think Rogers might have been treasonous.\n\nReturning to Michigan under the power of Gage was unthinkable; hence, Rogers went to England in 1769 to petition again for debt relief. However, the king had done all he would for Rogers and was preoccupied by the issue of the dissatisfied colonies. Rogers went again to debtors' prison and tried suing Gage for false imprisonment. Gage settled out of court by offering Rogers the half-pay of a major in return for dropping the suit.\n\n===American Revolutionary War===\nBecause of his legal troubles in England, Robert Rogers missed the major events in the disaffected colonies. He heard that revolution was likely to break out and returned to America in 1775. The Americans were as out of touch with Rogers as he was with them, looking upon him as the noted ranger leader and expecting him to behave as one; they were at a total loss to explain his drunken and licentious behavior. At that time, Rogers was perhaps suffering from the alcoholism that blighted his later life and led to the loss of his family, land, money, and friends.\n\nIt is unclear exactly what transpired between the revolutionary leaders and Rogers. Rogers was arrested by the local Committee of Safety as a possible spy and released on parole that he would not serve against the colonies. He was offered a commission in the Revolutionary Army by the [[Continental Congress]], but declined on the grounds that he was a British officer. He later wrote to [[George Washington]] asking for a command, but instead Washington had him arrested.\n\nHe escaped from Washington's custody only to find revolutionary ranks firm against him, so he offered his services to the British Army. They also were hoping that he would live up to his reputation. In August 1776, he formed another ranger-type unit called the [[Queen's Rangers]] as its colonel.<ref>{{cite book |last=Katcher |first=Philip R.

A contemporaneous account of Hale's capture is in the [[Library of Congress]], written by [[Consider Tiffany]], a Connecticut shopkeeper and Loyalist. In Tiffany's account, Rogers did not believe Hale's cover story that he was a teacher, and lured him into his own betrayal by pretending to be a patriot spy himself.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0307-8/hale.html |first=James |last=Hutson |title=Nathan Hale Revisited: A Tory's Account of the Arrest of the First American Spy |journal=Information Bulletin |date=August 2003 |volume=62 |number=7 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=29 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h550.html |title=Nathan Hale |website=U.S. History.com |accessdate=29 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanrevolution.com/NathanHale.htm |title=Nathan Hale, American Patriot |website=American Revolution |date=2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421202900/http://www.americanrevolution.com/NathanHale.htm |archivedate=21 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1777, the British Army forcibly retired Rogers on grounds of \"poor health\". A return home now was impossible; Hale's execution and Rogers raising troops against the colonials seemed to confirm Washington's suspicions. At Washington's prompting, the New Hampshire legislature passed two decrees regarding Rogers: one a proscription and the other a divorce from his wife on grounds of abandonment and infidelity. She could not afford any friendship or mercy toward Robert now if she expected to remain in New Hampshire. Later, Elizabeth married American naval officer John Roche. She died in 1811.\n\n==Final return to England==\nAfter a brief sojourn in England, Rogers returned in 1779 to raise the [[King's Rangers]] in Nova Scotia, Canada for [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|General Sir Henry Clinton]]. He was unable to keep the position due to his alcoholism, and his place was taken by his brother [[James Rogers (soldier)|James]]. Now he was of no further use to the British army. He was snared by an American privateer and spent some time in a prison in New York, escaping in 1782. In 1783, he was evacuated with other British troops to England. There, he was unable to earn a living or to defeat his alcoholism. He died in obscurity and debt in 1795, what little money he had going to pay an arrears in rent. He was buried in London but his gravesite has been lost.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/50372309 |title=Capt. Robert E.

S. Forester]]. Being also known for his [[Horatio Hornblower]] novels and 1935's ''[[The African Queen (novel)|The African Queen]]'', Forester attempted in the work to portray the then recently finished conflict of [[World War One]] in a decidedly realistic though still narrative-based and compelling fashion. The book centers around the titular general and portrays, among other things, the [[United Kingdom|British]] efforts to deal with the [[dilemma]] of [[trench warfare]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn terms of [[Plot (storytelling)|plot]], ''The General'' follows the career of a professional soldier, Herbert Curzon, from his service as a junior officer in the [[Second Boer War]] through his experiences as a senior commander in the aforementioned First World War. While personally [[Courage|courageous]] and dedicated, Curzon is otherwise unexceptional: he serves as an officer like many others.

The stalemate of the conflict irritates him as he receives greater and greater [[promotion]] yet finds himself ordering great numbers of regular soldiers to their deaths.

S. Satyanarayana. She discontinued her M.B.B.S. first year in Bangalore. She married G. S. Raghu, who is a childhood friend and a Software Engineer. She had wide popularity and tremendous goodwill among Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and is probably the most successful actress after [[Savitri (actress)|Savitri]] in the history of Telugu cinema and is often called the \"Savitri of modern Telugu cinema\".

Then in the same year, she acted in the Telugu movie ''Raithu Bharatham'', opposite superstar [[Krishna (Telugu actor)|Krishna]], directed by Tripuraneni Sriprasad alias Varaprasad. She made more than 100 movies, predominantly in Telugu, in a span of 12 years.  Telugu actor [[Venkatesh (actor)|Venkatesh]] once described her as \"a thorough actress\" of Indian cinema.<ref name=\"rediff1\">{{cite news |url=http://www.rediff.com/entertai/1998/mar/28sou.htm|title=Child, woman, star|last=Kumar |first=Ch Sushil |date=1998-03-28 |work=Interview|publisher=[[Rediff.com]]|accessdate=2009-06-20}}</ref>\n\nShe'd started off hoping to be a doctor but ended up an actress. She began with lead roles in Kannada, her mother tongue, and went on to become the most popular actress in Telugu films. In her first hit in Telugu, in 1993, she acted in the leading role alongside [[Rajendra Prasad (actor)|Rajendra Prasad]] in ''[[Rajendrudu Gajendrudu]]'', directed by [[S. V. Krishna Reddy]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The real commercial recognition came with ''[[Hello Brother (1994 film)|Hello Brother]]'' (1994), directed by commercial director E. V. V. Satyanarayana, in which she starred alongside [[Nagarjuna (actor)|Nagarjuna]] and [[Ramya Krishna]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}  She had an award-winning role in ''[[Ammoru]]'', directed by [[Kodi Ramakrishna]]. She starred alongside Ramya Krishna and Suresh where she played the role of ''Bhavani'', a devotee of Goddess Ammoru.  She had eleven movie releases in 1995.<ref name=\"rediff1\" />\nIn Tamil, she was introduced by ''Ammoru'' dubbing as Amman. She got major acclaim with ''[[Ponnumani]]'', starring with [[Karthik (actor)|Karthik]] and [[Sivakumar]]. She played the role of a mentally disabled person and received good reviews for her acting.\n\n== Continuous success, critical acclaim and popularity (1995\u20132002) ==\n\nAccording to D. Ramanaidu, the \"Most Beautiful Pairs of Telugu cinema\" are [[N. T. Rama Rao|NTR]] and [[Savitri (actress)|Savitri]], [[Akkineni Nageswara Rao|ANR]] and [[Vanisri]] and [[Daggubati Venkatesh]] and Soundarya.\n\nIn 1997, she continued her success with ''Pelli Chesukundam'', ''Pavitra Bandam'', ''Amma Donga'', ''Maa Aayana Bangaram'', ''Osi Na Maradala'' and ''[[Aaro Pranam]]'', winning acclaim from all over the industry for her performances. She also starred alongside South Indian superstar Rajinikanth in ''[[Arunachalam (film)|Arunachalam]]'', which became the highest-grossing film of 1997 in Tamil cinema. This stardom made her come out of the shadow of mainstream heroines and she chose scripts which had a wide potential of performance even alongside big stars which was clearly reflected in her movies. Though the industry regarded her to be the golden hand, as a former director's daughter, she always regarded the success not as a one-man show, but the teamwork between 36 departments.<ref name=\"rediff1\" />\n\nFurthermore, the critical success of ''Chudalani Vundi'', directed by Gunashekar, opposite Chiranjeevi in 1998 made her reach the pinnacle of her cinema career. She also starred along [[Kamal Haasan]] and [[Prabhudeva]] in ''Kaathala Kaathala'' in Tamil in the same year, dubbed in Telugu as ''Navvandi Lavvandi'', directed by Singeetam Srinivas. ''Pelli Peetalu'' and ''Sri Ramulayya'', ''Ninne Premista'' in Telugu and ''Doni Saagali'' in Kannada were commercially highly successful. ''Anthapuram'', directed by Krishnavamshi, stood as one of the finest performances of Soundarya in her career, winning her a State [[Nandi Award for Best Actress]] and also her second consecutive [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress]].

Then in the same year, she acted in the Telugu movie ''Raithu Bharatham'', opposite superstar [[Krishna (Telugu actor)|Krishna]], directed by Tripuraneni Sriprasad alias Varaprasad. She made more than 100 movies, predominantly in Telugu, in a span of 12 years.  Telugu actor [[Venkatesh (actor)|Venkatesh]] once described her as \"a thorough actress\" of Indian cinema.<ref name=\"rediff1\">{{cite news |url=http://www.rediff.com/entertai/1998/mar/28sou.htm|title=Child, woman, star|last=Kumar |first=Ch Sushil |date=1998-03-28 |work=Interview|publisher=[[Rediff.com]]|accessdate=2009-06-20}}</ref>\n\nShe'd started off hoping to be a doctor but ended up an actress. She began with lead roles in Kannada, her mother tongue, and went on to become the most popular actress in Telugu films. In her first hit in Telugu, in 1993, she acted in the leading role alongside [[Rajendra Prasad (actor)|Rajendra Prasad]] in ''[[Rajendrudu Gajendrudu]]'', directed by [[S. V. Krishna Reddy]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The real commercial recognition came with ''[[Hello Brother (1994 film)|Hello Brother]]'' (1994), directed by commercial director E. V. V. Satyanarayana, in which she starred alongside [[Nagarjuna (actor)|Nagarjuna]] and [[Ramya Krishna]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}  She had an award-winning role in ''[[Ammoru]]'', directed by [[Kodi Ramakrishna]]. She starred alongside Ramya Krishna and Suresh where she played the role of ''Bhavani'', a devotee of Goddess Ammoru.  She had eleven movie releases in 1995.<ref name=\"rediff1\" />\nIn Tamil, she was introduced by ''Ammoru'' dubbing as Amman. She got major acclaim with ''[[Ponnumani]]'', starring with [[Karthik (actor)|Karthik]] and [[Sivakumar]]. She played the role of a mentally disabled person and received good reviews for her acting.\n\n== Continuous success, critical acclaim and popularity (1995\u20132002) ==\n\nAccording to D. Ramanaidu, the \"Most Beautiful Pairs of Telugu cinema\" are [[N. T. Rama Rao|NTR]] and [[Savitri (actress)|Savitri]], [[Akkineni Nageswara Rao|ANR]] and [[Vanisri]] and [[Daggubati Venkatesh]] and Soundarya.\n\nIn 1997, she continued her success with ''Pelli Chesukundam'', ''Pavitra Bandam'', ''Amma Donga'', ''Maa Aayana Bangaram'', ''Osi Na Maradala'' and ''[[Aaro Pranam]]'', winning acclaim from all over the industry for her performances. She also starred alongside South Indian superstar Rajinikanth in ''[[Arunachalam (film)|Arunachalam]]'', which became the highest-grossing film of 1997 in Tamil cinema. This stardom made her come out of the shadow of mainstream heroines and she chose scripts which had a wide potential of performance even alongside big stars which was clearly reflected in her movies. Though the industry regarded her to be the golden hand, as a former director's daughter, she always regarded the success not as a one-man show, but the teamwork between 36 departments.<ref name=\"rediff1\" />\n\nFurthermore, the critical success of ''Chudalani Vundi'', directed by Gunashekar, opposite Chiranjeevi in 1998 made her reach the pinnacle of her cinema career. She also starred along [[Kamal Haasan]] and [[Prabhudeva]] in ''Kaathala Kaathala'' in Tamil in the same year, dubbed in Telugu as ''Navvandi Lavvandi'', directed by Singeetam Srinivas. ''Pelli Peetalu'' and ''Sri Ramulayya'', ''Ninne Premista'' in Telugu and ''Doni Saagali'' in Kannada were commercially highly successful. ''Anthapuram'', directed by Krishnavamshi, stood as one of the finest performances of Soundarya in her career, winning her a State [[Nandi Award for Best Actress]] and also her second consecutive [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress]]. The producers and directors realized Soundarya's ability to be a crowd puller and the biggest plus for the promotion of the movie. Her 1999 release ''Raja'', opposite [[Venkatesh]], was another blockbuster and won her her third [[Filmfare Award]].  Her other releases, ''[[Padayappa]]'' opposite Rajinikanth, ''[[Azad (2000 film)|Azad]]'' opposite Nagarjuna and ''Premaku Velayera'', ''Premaku Swagatam'' and ''Arundathi'' further solidified her position. In the same year, she starred opposite [[Amitabh Bachchan]] in ''Sooryavansham'', which was one of the few failures of her career, and prevented her from entering into the Bollywood business.<ref name=\"rediff1\" />\n\nIn 2000, she starred in yet another commercial success, ''Annayya'', opposite Chiranjeevi, ''Jayam Manadera'' and ''Deviputrudu'', opposite Venkatesh, ''Ninne premista'', opposite Nagarjuna and Srikanth and several others and went on displaying her acting abilities, continuing her successful journey with films such as ''Eduruleni Manishi'' and ''[[Sri Manjunatha]]'', opposite Chiranjeevi, [[Arjun Sarja]], Ambareesh and Sumalatha and ''Narasimha'', opposite Rajinikanth and [[Ramyakrishna]], ''Pelli Peetalu'', ''Dongata'' and ''Nagadevatha''.<ref name=\"rediff1\" />\n\nShe has also given special songs in a few movies. alongside [[Akkineni Nageswara Rao]] in ''Mayabazar'', directed by [[Dasari Narayana Rao]], In ''Adhipathi'', alongside [[Akkineni Nagarjuna]] and in ''Shubalagnam'', alongside [[Ali]] also.\nShe had about 10 film releases each year, most of them in Telugu, from 1993 to 2001, which reflects her path-breaking success. After the entry of the budding next generation, she slowed down, but even later she went on acting in eight films each year till 2004. She has never been proud about stardom, she has been recognized for her super talent, her directors and costars describe her as an honest, grounded and friendly person.<ref name=\"rediff1\" />\n\nDuring the period, Balakrishna is announced plans to act and direct in the remake of ''Nartanasala'', and a launch event was held in Hyderabad during March 2004.
