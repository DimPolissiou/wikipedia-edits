His best known and most favoured songs include \"[[The Stroke]]\", \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\", \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\", \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\", \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\", \"[[Emotions in Motion]]\", \"Love Is the Hero\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n=== Early life (1950-1980) ===\nBilly Squier was born in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He is a 1968 graduate of Wellesley High School. While growing up, he began playing piano and guitar, but did not become serious with music until discovering John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (with Eric Clapton). When Squier was nine, his grandfather taught him to play piano. After he stopped taking piano lessons, he became interested in guitar after getting one from his older brother (or as an other story goes, he bought a guitar from his neighbour for 90 dollars). Squier formed his first band, The Reltneys, when he was 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> \n\nSquier's first public performances were at a [[Boston]] nightclub in Kenmore Square called [[the Psychedelic Supermarket]] in 1968, which was where he saw Eric Clapton and the band [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. His first original effort was with the band Magic Terry & the Universe in 1969. In the early 1970s, he formed Kicks, which included future [[New York Dolls]] drummer [[Jerry Nolan]] and also briefly attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in 1971. He then joined The Sidewinders. Squier left the group to form the band Piper in 1976, which released two studio records, ''Piper'' and ''Can't Wait'', and was praised by critics; upon reviewing their self-titled'','' ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' Magazine touted it as \"the greatest debut album ever produced by a US rock band\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=124 |title=Exclusive Magazine |publisher=Anne Carlini |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> Piper were managed by the same management company as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and opened for them during their 1977 tour, including two nights of a sold-out run at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]].\n\nHowever, Piper broke up soon after and Squier, the band's frontman, signed a solo deal with [[Capitol Records]] in 1979 and started working on his solo debut ''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'', which was released in spring 1980. The album provided him with strong momentum, spending three months on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' album chart, though peaking only at #169. Squier's first singles \"You Should Be High Love\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" missed the charts but got moderate radio play nationally. The album later became best known for the latter, whose booming drum intro (Squier beating a drum case dubbed over drummer Bobby Chouinard's backbeat) became a sampling staple in hip hop, being sampled in almost 300 songs as of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosampled.com/Billy-Squier/The-Big-Beat/|title=The Big Beat by Billy Squier on WhoSampled|website=WhoSampled|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Along with Chouinard, his backing band consisted of Alan St. Jon on keyboards, Cary Sharaf on lead guitar and [[Mark Clarke]] (also known for his stints with [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] and [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]]) on bass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial success (1981-1984) ===\nFollowing a successful small summer tour with [[Alice Cooper]] in 1980, Squier got in contact with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] guitarist [[Brian May]] and proposed him to produce his next album. Due to scheduling conflicts, May declined, but he recommended [[Reinhold Mack]], who had produced Queen's most recent album ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]].'' Squier and Mack joined forces to produce ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'', which attracted rave reviews and spawned three hit singles, catapulting him to stardom. The first, \"[[The Stroke]],\" became his breakthrough hit, hitting Top 20 in the US and reaching the top five in Australia as well as charting high in Canada and even in Britain, where the song remains his only chart entry. \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\" and \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\" were successful follow-ups. The album also featured \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", which became a radio favourite and one of his signature songs, despite not being released as a single (however, in Britain, it was featured as the b-side for \"In the Dark\"). Squier was also popular on the new MTV cable channel, where his straight-forward performance received heavy rotation. ''Don't Say No'' peaked at #5 on Billboard 200 and lasted well over two years on the chart, eventually selling over 4 million copies in the US alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-squier-dont-say-no/|title=Revisiting Billy Squier's Breakthrough Album, 'Don't Say No'|last=Giles|first=Jeff|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Retrospectively, ''Don't Say No'' is widely regarded as Squier's best solo album and one of the greatest rock albums of the 1980s.\n\nHis third album ''[[Emotions in Motion|Emotions In Motion]]'' was released in 1982 and became nearly as successful as its predecessor. In the US, the album hit #5 and sold about 3 million copies. The sexually suggestive title track of the album, on which Squier was backed by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] members [[Freddie Mercury]] and [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]], was a popular MTV video, but the album's biggest hit was \"[[Everybody Wants You]],\" which held the No. 1 spot on the ''Billboard'' Album Rock Tracks for six weeks straight. Squier was the opening act for the North American leg of Queen's 1982 Hot Space Tour.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Washington Post|date=July 27, 1982|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_07-27-1982_-_Washington_Post_-_Capital_Centre|title=Queen's Flashy Rock}}</ref> That same year he recorded a song, \"Fast Times (The Best Years of Our Lives)\" for the film ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''. The next year, Squier led his own arena tour for the first time and was supported by English newcomer [[Def Leppard]]. He helped the band break through in the US, in conjunction with the release of their breakthrough album ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]''.\n\nSquier began recording his fourth album ''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' in 1984. He had planned [[Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange]] - the man behind Def Leppard's wildly successful ''Pyromania -'' to produce the album, but Lange was already reserved by [[The Cars]] and had suffered a breakdown, which prompted Squier to continue his search. He brought in [[Jim Steinman]], who was best known for his grandiose ballads and operatic rock n' roll songs, thus a rather odd choice for straight-forward arena rocker like Squier.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-10-12-ca-2715-story.html|title=SQUIER TRIES TO SHED AN IMAGE AS A VIDEO WIMP|date=1986-10-12|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> When ''Signs of Life'' finally came in August 1984, Squier was at the peak of his success. The album brought him his third consecutive platinum certification. Its lead single, \"[[Rock Me Tonite]],\" reached #15 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], hit the Top 10 of the [[Cash Box]] singles chart, and became his second #1 hit on the Mainstream Rock charts. Despite the song being his highest-charting US single, its homoerotic video attracted negative responses from critics, fans and fellow musicians alike. It has been considered by many, including Squier himself, to be the reason for his subsequent downfall in popularity.<ref name=\"I Want My MTV\">{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Craig|title=I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution|year=2011|publisher=Dutton|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-525-95230-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250 250\u201355]|chapter=21|author2=Tannenbaum, Rob|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250}}</ref> Squier's album and ticket sales suffered soon after the video's world premiere and he stopped selling out shows, on some occasions even playing for half-empty stadiums. He fired both of his managers and put the biggest blame on the video's director, [[Kenny Ortega]], for misleading and deceiving him and altering his original concepts. However, whereas Ortega himself has denied Squier's accusations, it is also believed the overall commercial appeal of ''Signs of Life'' made him seem to be a sellout.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Squier continued performing and released two more singles from ''Signs of Life'' later that same year: hard rocker \"All Night Long\" and more experimental \"Eye on You\", though with a little chart impact. In December, he appeared on [[Saturday Night Live]] as a musical guest, playing \"Rock Me Tonite\" and \"All Night Long\", which had became his fifth Top 10 hit on the Mainstream Rock charts in autumn and featured a performance-based music video, more typical of his style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/season-10/episode/7-ed-begley-jr-with-billy-squier-64776|title=SNL Season 10 Episode 07 - Ed Begley, Jr., Billy Squier - NBC.com|website=NBC|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tampabay.com/forget-rock-me-tonite--our-love-for-billy-squier-goes-all-night-long/2264984/|title=Forget 'Rock Me Tonite' ...

The album spawned a minor hit, \"[[Love Is The Hero]]\", which featured [[Freddie Mercury]] on backing vocals, who also co-wrote and arranged the song \"Lady With a Tenor Sax\", which also appears on the album. ''Enough Is Enough'' sold an estimated 300,000 copies and broke his platinum album streak right away. Squier chose not to embark on a tour since Capitol decided not to promote the album, which built strong tensions between him and the label.\n\nSquier spent the next three years working on his sixth full-length ''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'', which was finally released in 1989, after going through various delays. The album peaked only at #64, but still sold a little better than ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'' and is often regarded as one of the strongest inputs of Squier's career by both fans and critics. It featured a modestly successful comeback single, his last Hot 100 hit \"Don't Say You Love Me\", which hit #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went to #4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Mainstream Rock chart - his first Top 5 hit there and overall best-charting single since \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\". Also featured on the album are power ballad \"Don't Let Me Go\" and [[Desmond Child]] collaboration \"Tied Up\". The album did briefly restore Squier's mainstream success by harking back to his early 1980s hard rock. \"Don't Say You Love Me\" featured a popular MTV video and the album's promotional tour entitled All Excess was also well received. However, despite quite promising comeback chances, Squier wasn't able to pull off a notable return after the turn of the decade.\n\nSquier continued making music into the 1990s and released his seventh album, ''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'', in 1991. Both critical and audience reception were mixed; many criticized the album for lacking innovation and being uninspired mainly on the songwriting side. Peaking only at #117 in US, the album became his lowest charting since ''[[The Tale of the Tape|Tale of the Tape]]''. However, it did feature successful radio hits, \"She Goes Down\" - Squier's last Top 5 radio hit - and \"Facts of Life\". ''Creatures of Habit'' was supported with a tour, his last big tour for a decade.\n\nIn the middle of grunge's heyday, Squier released his final album with [[Capitol Records]] in 1993, ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]],'' which featured different sets of musicians performing the various tracks. Despite Squier himself comparing it favourably to ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]],'' Capitol did little to nothing to promote the product and it became his first album not to chart at all and sold an estimated 100,000 copies. Feeling betrayed, he walked away from the label and music business for good. The album has subsequently spawned a strong cult reputation and some of its songs, such as his last Mainstream Rock entry \"Angry\" and fan favourite \"The Girl's All Right\" were later resurrected for Squier's future concert setlists.\n\nIn 1994, Squier's original screenplay ''Run To Daylight'' was short-listed at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film itself was never produced.\n\nOn February 17, 1998, during the initial run of ''[[Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God]] -'' a [[monodrama]] about the life of Freddie Mercury - Squier debuted a song that he wrote in memory of his friend titled \"I Have Watched You Fly\" on stage before a performance of the play. He introduced the song by saying, \"I was privileged to know Freddie as a friend. I'm honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Theater Records|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DC153FF93BA25751C0A96E958260|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 18, 1998|author2=Martin, Douglas}}</ref> That same year Squier released independently his last studio album to date, a stripped and acoustic blues effort entitled ''[[Happy Blue]].'' He played a few dates in 1999 to showcase songs from the album, which included a stripped-down acoustic version of his [[classic rock]] mega-hit, \"[[The Stroke]]\", which was also included on the album as \"Stroke Me Blues\".\n=== Later career (1998-) ===\nAs time passed, Squier's albums went out of print, except for ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'' and some greatest hits compilations; however, many of these would later be re-released.\n\nThe year 2001 marked the 20th anniversary of ''Don't Say No.'' In the same year, Squier embarked on\n\nIn 2004, \"Everybody Wants You\" was remixed with the group Fischerspooner's song \"Emerge\" and included on the ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'' soundtrack. In 2006, Squier joined [[Richard Marx]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Rod Argent]], [[Hamish Stuart]], and [[Sheila E]] touring with [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]]. A documentary of the tour, including a full-length concert performance, was subsequently made available on DVD. In 2007, Squier appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with [[Ronnie Spector]], [[Mitch Ryder]], [[Tone Loc]], [[Deniece Williams]], [[Dr. Hook]], and [[Tom Cochrane]]. In 2008, Squier joined [[Colin Hay]], Edgar Winter, [[Gary Wright]], Hamish Stuart and [[Gregg Bissonette]] touring with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In 2009, Squier launched a nationwide summer/fall tour with a band that included drummer Nir Z, guitarist Marc Copely, long-time bassist Mark Clarke and keyboard player Alan St. Jon.\n\nSquier played a special acoustic show at B.B. King's in New York on November 30, 2005. Highlights of the show were acoustic versions of \"Everybody Wants You,\" \"Nobody Knows,\" \"Learn How to Live,\" \"Christmas is the Time to Say I Love You,\" and most of the Happy Blue project. VH1 Classic and New York hard rock radio icon Eddie Trunk introduced Squier that night as \"one of the greatest singer/songwriters in the history of rock.\"{{sources|section|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn May 2010, Squier was part of the Boston Legends Tribute to [[James Cotton]] including [[Magic Dick]] ([[J. Geils Band]]), the [[James Montgomery (singer)|James Montgomery Band]], [[Jon Butcher]], [[Sib Hashian]] ([[Boston (band)|Boston]]), [[Michael Carabello]] ([[Santana (band)|Santana]]), the Uptown Horns and James Cotton. Squier accepted Cotton's invitation in June to join him at the \"James Cotton's Blues Summit\" at [[Lincoln Center]] in NYC, along with the legendary [[Pinetop Perkins]], [[Hubert Sumlin]] ([[Howlin' Wolf]]'s band), [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and many more. In November, Squier appeared at the [[Iridium Jazz Club|Iridium]] in New York and played a double set that night, \"Blues Deluxe,\" that showcased songs from his blues upbringing and new versions of several of his hits.\n\nShout! Factory released ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]: 30th Anniversary Edition'' on July 27, 2010, marking the first time that this album had been remastered in over 20 years. It was released in collaboration with Squier, who provided two live bonus cuts from his personal collection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.staticmultimedia.com/music/news/shout~_factory_re-issuing_concrete_blonde_~_billy_squier|title=Shout!

During Memorial Day weekend, Squier made a surprise appearance at the John Varvatos store in Easthampton, NY in support of his friend, rock photographer [[Rob Shanahan]] and his new book, \"Volume One.\" In June, Squier performed at the \"Industrial Hedgefund Awards Dinner\" in New York, in another fundraising effort for '[[Little Kids Rock]].' In September, Squier appeared as a guest during the set of the James Montgomery Band at the Westport Blues Festival. In December, Squier headlined a fund-raising concert for \"The American Revolution,\" a documentary on legendary rock FM station WBCN at the House Of Blues in Boston.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Squier performed his 'Electric Man' show at the Patchogue Music Festival on Long Island. In November, he played the Voodoo Festival in New Orleans. The Stooges, a local brass band (not to be confused with [[Iggy Pop]]'s band), joined Squier on \"The Stroke.\" At the same time, [[Eminem]] released '[[Berzerk (song)|Berzerk]]' which makes use of various samples from \"The Stroke.\" Later, on his 2014 effort, \"[[Shady XV]],\" he sampled \"[[My Kinda Lover]].\"\n\nIn September 2014, Squier took his 'Electric Man' show to the 9th Jack Show in Anaheim, CA.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nIn 2002, Squier married Nicole Schoen, a professional German soccer player. They divided their time between a home in [[Bridgehampton]], [[Long Island]] and an apartment in [[The San Remo]] on [[Central Park West]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Squier had been, as of 2016, an active volunteer for the [[Central Park Conservancy]] for more than 17 years, physically maintaining 20 acres (81,000 m2) of the park, as well as promoting the Conservancy in articles and interviews. He also supported the Group for the East End and its native planting programs on eastern Long Island.<ref>{{cite news|work=The New York Post|date=May 14, 2000|url=https://nypost.com/2000/05/14/rocker-billys-a-country-squier/|title=Rocker Billy's A Country \u2018Squier\u2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=New York Social Diary|date=September 2, 2015|url=http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/guest-diary/2015/end-of-summer-doings-at-madoo|title=End of Summer Doings at Madoo}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Billy Squier discography}}\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n*''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'' (1980)\n*''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'' (1981)\n*''[[Emotions in Motion]]'' (1982)\n*''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' (1984)\n*''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'' (1986)\n*''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'' (1989)\n*''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'' (1991)\n*''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]]'' (1993)\n*''[[Happy Blue (Billy Squier album)|Happy Blue]]'' (1998)\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n* ''[[A Rock and Roll Christmas]]'' (Various Artists Compilation) (1994)\n* ''16 Strokes: The Best of Billy Squier'' (1995)\n* ''Reach for the Sky: The Anthology'' (1996) (PolyGram)\n* ''Classic Masters'' (2002)\n* ''Absolute Hits'' (2005)\n* ''Essential Billy Squier'' (2011)\n* ''ICON'' (2013)\n\n=== Live albums ===\n* ''King Biscuit Flower Hour Presents Billy Squier'' (1996)\n* ''Live In The Dark'' (DVD)\n\n===Non-album soundtrack contributions===\n*''Fast Times (The Best Years Of Our Lives)'' - from the Motion Picture Soundtrack ''[[Fast Times At Ridgemont High]]'' (1982)\n*''On Your Own'' - from the Motion Picture Soundtrack ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1984)\n*''Shake Down'' - from the Motion Picture Soundtrack ''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]'' (1985)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<!--unused<ref name=\"parker\">{{cite web|last1=Parker|first1=Lyndsey|title=Martha, Martha, Martha! 35 Years Later, Original VJ Quinn Remembers MTV's Early Days|url=https://www.yahoo.com/music/martha-martha-martha-35-years-later-original-vj-quinn-remembers-mtvs-early-days-042906236.html|website=Yahoo!

After he stopped taking piano lessons, he became interested in guitar after getting one from his older brother (or as an other story goes, he bought a guitar from his neighbour for 90 dollars). Squier formed his first band, The Reltneys, when he was 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> \n\nSquier's first public performances were at a [[Boston]] nightclub in Kenmore Square called [[the Psychedelic Supermarket]] in 1968, which was where he saw Eric Clapton and the band [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. His first original effort was with the band Magic Terry & the Universe in 1969. In the early 1970s, he formed Kicks, which included future [[New York Dolls]] drummer [[Jerry Nolan]] and also briefly attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in 1971. He then joined The Sidewinders. Squier left the group to form the band Piper in 1976, which released two studio records, ''Piper'' and ''Can't Wait'', and was praised by critics; upon reviewing their self-titled'','' ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' Magazine touted it as \"the greatest debut album ever produced by a US rock band\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=124 |title=Exclusive Magazine |publisher=Anne Carlini |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> Piper were managed by the same management company as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and opened for them during their 1977 tour, including two nights of a sold-out run at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]].\n\nHowever, Piper broke up soon after and Squier, the band's frontman, signed a solo deal with [[Capitol Records]] in 1979 and started working on his solo debut ''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'', which was released in spring 1980. The album provided him with strong momentum, spending three months on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' album chart, though peaking only at #169. Squier's first singles \"You Should Be High Love\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" missed the charts but got moderate radio play nationally. The album later became best known for the latter, whose booming drum intro (Squier beating a drum case dubbed over drummer Bobby Chouinard's backbeat) became a sampling staple in hip hop, being sampled in almost 300 songs as of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosampled.com/Billy-Squier/The-Big-Beat/|title=The Big Beat by Billy Squier on WhoSampled|website=WhoSampled|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Along with Chouinard, his backing band consisted of Alan St. Jon on keyboards, Cary Sharaf on lead guitar and [[Mark Clarke]] (also known for his stints with [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] and [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]]) on bass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial success (1981-1984) ===\nFollowing a successful small summer tour with [[Alice Cooper]] in 1980, Squier got in contact with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] guitarist [[Brian May]] and proposed him to produce his next album. Due to scheduling conflicts, May declined, but he recommended [[Reinhold Mack]], who had produced Queen's most recent album ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]].'' Squier and Mack joined forces to produce ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'', which attracted rave reviews and spawned three hit singles, catapulting him to stardom. The first, \"[[The Stroke]],\" became his breakthrough hit, hitting Top 20 in the US and reaching the top five in Australia as well as charting high in Canada and even in Britain, where the song remains his only chart entry. \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\" and \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\" were successful follow-ups. The album also featured \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", which became a radio favourite and one of his signature songs, despite not being released as a single (however, in Britain, it was featured as the b-side for \"In the Dark\"). Squier also became hugely popular on the new MTV cable channel, where his straight-forward performance received heavy rotation. ''Don't Say No'' peaked at #5 on Billboard 200 and lasted well over two years on the chart, eventually selling over 4 million copies in the US alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-squier-dont-say-no/|title=Revisiting Billy Squier's Breakthrough Album, 'Don't Say No'|last=Giles|first=Jeff|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Retrospectively, ''Don't Say No'' is widely regarded as Squier's best solo album and one of the greatest rock albums of the 1980s.\n\nHis third album ''[[Emotions in Motion|Emotions In Motion]]'' was released in 1982 and became nearly as successful as its predecessor. In the US, the album hit #5 and sold about 3 million copies. The sexually suggestive title track of the album, on which Squier was backed by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] members [[Freddie Mercury]] and [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]], was a popular MTV video, but the album's biggest hit was \"[[Everybody Wants You]],\" which held the No. 1 spot on the ''Billboard'' Album Rock Tracks for six weeks straight. Squier was the opening act for the North American leg of Queen's 1982 Hot Space Tour.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Washington Post|date=July 27, 1982|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_07-27-1982_-_Washington_Post_-_Capital_Centre|title=Queen's Flashy Rock}}</ref> That same year he recorded a song, \"Fast Times (The Best Years of Our Lives)\" for the film ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''. The next year, Squier led his own arena tour for the first time and was supported by English newcomer [[Def Leppard]]. He helped the band break through in the US, in conjunction with the release of their breakthrough album ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]''.\n\nSquier began recording his fourth album ''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' in 1984. He had planned [[Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange]] - the man behind Def Leppard's wildly successful ''Pyromania -'' to produce the album, but Lange was already reserved by [[The Cars]] and had suffered a breakdown, which prompted Squier to continue his search. He brought in [[Jim Steinman]], who was best known for his grandiose ballads and operatic rock n' roll songs, thus a rather odd choice for straight-forward arena rocker like Squier.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-10-12-ca-2715-story.html|title=SQUIER TRIES TO SHED AN IMAGE AS A VIDEO WIMP|date=1986-10-12|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> When ''Signs of Life'' finally came in August 1984, Squier was at the peak of his success. The album brought him his third consecutive platinum certification. Its lead single, \"[[Rock Me Tonite]],\" reached #15 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], hit the Top 10 of the [[Cash Box]] singles chart, and became his second #1 hit on the Mainstream Rock charts. Despite the song being his highest-charting US single, its homoerotic video attracted negative responses from critics, fans and fellow musicians alike. It has been considered by many, including Squier himself, to be the reason for his subsequent downfall in popularity.<ref name=\"I Want My MTV\">{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Craig|title=I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution|year=2011|publisher=Dutton|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-525-95230-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250 250\u201355]|chapter=21|author2=Tannenbaum, Rob|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250}}</ref> Squier's album and ticket sales suffered soon after the video's world premiere and he stopped selling out shows, on some occasions even playing for half-empty stadiums. He fired both of his managers and put the biggest blame on the video's director, [[Kenny Ortega]], for misleading and deceiving him and altering his original concepts. However, whereas Ortega himself has denied Squier's accusations, it is also believed the overall commercial appeal of ''Signs of Life'' made him seem to be a sellout.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Squier continued performing and released two more singles from ''Signs of Life'' later that same year: hard rocker \"All Night Long\" and more experimental \"Eye on You\", though with a little chart impact. In December, he appeared on [[Saturday Night Live]] as a musical guest, playing \"Rock Me Tonite\" and \"All Night Long\", which had became his fifth Top 10 hit on the Mainstream Rock charts in autumn and featured a performance-based music video, more typical of his style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/season-10/episode/7-ed-begley-jr-with-billy-squier-64776|title=SNL Season 10 Episode 07 - Ed Begley, Jr., Billy Squier - NBC.com|website=NBC|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tampabay.com/forget-rock-me-tonite--our-love-for-billy-squier-goes-all-night-long/2264984/|title=Forget 'Rock Me Tonite' ...

The album spawned a minor hit, \"[[Love Is The Hero]]\", which featured [[Freddie Mercury]] on backing vocals, who also co-wrote and arranged the song \"Lady With a Tenor Sax\", which also appears on the album. ''Enough Is Enough'' sold an estimated 300,000 copies and broke his platinum album streak right away. Squier chose not to embark on a tour since Capitol decided not to promote the album, which built strong tensions between him and the label.\n\nSquier spent the next three years working on his sixth full-length ''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'', which was finally released in 1989, after going through various delays. The album peaked only at #64, but still sold a little better than ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'' and is often regarded as one of the strongest inputs of Squier's career by both fans and critics. It featured a modestly successful comeback single, his last Hot 100 hit \"Don't Say You Love Me\", which hit #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went to #4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Mainstream Rock chart - his first Top 5 hit there and overall best-charting single since \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\". Also featured on the album are power ballad \"Don't Let Me Go\" and [[Desmond Child]] collaboration \"Tied Up\". The album did briefly restore Squier's mainstream success by harking back to his early 1980s hard rock. \"Don't Say You Love Me\" featured a popular MTV video and the album's promotional tour entitled All Excess was also well received. However, despite quite promising comeback chances, Squier wasn't able to pull off a notable return after the turn of the decade.\n\nSquier continued making music into the 1990s and released his seventh album, ''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'', in 1991. Both critical and audience reception were mixed; many criticized the album for lacking innovation and being uninspired mainly on the songwriting side. Peaking only at #117 in US, the album became his lowest charting since ''[[The Tale of the Tape|Tale of the Tape]]''. However, it did feature successful radio hits, \"She Goes Down\" - Squier's last Top 5 radio hit - and \"Facts of Life\". ''Creatures of Habit'' was supported with a tour, his last big tour for a decade.\n\nIn the middle of grunge's heyday, Squier released his final album with [[Capitol Records]] in 1993, ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]],'' which featured different sets of musicians performing the various tracks. Despite Squier himself comparing it favourably to ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]],'' Capitol did little to nothing to promote the product and it became his first album not to chart at all and sold an estimated 100,000 copies. Feeling betrayed, he walked away from the label and music business for good. The album has subsequently spawned a strong cult reputation and some of its songs, such as his last Mainstream Rock entry \"Angry\" and fan favourite \"The Girl's All Right\" were later resurrected for Squier's future concert setlists.\n\nIn 1994, Squier's original screenplay ''Run To Daylight'' was short-listed at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film itself was never produced.\n\nOn February 17, 1998, during the initial run of ''[[Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God]] -'' a [[monodrama]] about the life of Freddie Mercury - Squier debuted a song that he wrote in memory of his friend titled \"I Have Watched You Fly\" on stage before a performance of the play. He introduced the song by saying, \"I was privileged to know Freddie as a friend. I'm honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Theater Records|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DC153FF93BA25751C0A96E958260|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 18, 1998|author2=Martin, Douglas}}</ref> That same year Squier released independently his last studio album to date, a stripped and acoustic blues effort entitled ''[[Happy Blue]].'' He played a few dates in 1999 to showcase songs from the album, which included a stripped-down acoustic version of his [[classic rock]] mega-hit, \"[[The Stroke]]\", which was also included on the album as \"Stroke Me Blues\".\n=== Later career (1998-) ===\nAs time passed, Squier's albums went out of print, except for ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'' and some greatest hits compilations; however, many of these would later be re-released.\n\nThe year 2001 marked the 20th anniversary of ''Don't Say No.'' In the same year, Squier embarked on\n\nIn 2004, \"Everybody Wants You\" was remixed with the group Fischerspooner's song \"Emerge\" and included on the ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'' soundtrack. In 2006, Squier joined [[Richard Marx]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Rod Argent]], [[Hamish Stuart]], and [[Sheila E]] touring with [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]]. A documentary of the tour, including a full-length concert performance, was subsequently made available on DVD. In 2007, Squier appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with [[Ronnie Spector]], [[Mitch Ryder]], [[Tone Loc]], [[Deniece Williams]], [[Dr. Hook]], and [[Tom Cochrane]]. In 2008, Squier joined [[Colin Hay]], Edgar Winter, [[Gary Wright]], Hamish Stuart and [[Gregg Bissonette]] touring with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In 2009, Squier launched a nationwide summer/fall tour with a band that included drummer Nir Z, guitarist Marc Copely, long-time bassist Mark Clarke and keyboard player Alan St. Jon.\n\nSquier played a special acoustic show at B.B. King's in New York on November 30, 2005. Highlights of the show were acoustic versions of \"Everybody Wants You,\" \"Nobody Knows,\" \"Learn How to Live,\" \"Christmas is the Time to Say I Love You,\" and most of the Happy Blue project. VH1 Classic and New York hard rock radio icon Eddie Trunk introduced Squier that night as \"one of the greatest singer/songwriters in the history of rock.\"{{sources|section|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn May 2010, Squier was part of the Boston Legends Tribute to [[James Cotton]] including [[Magic Dick]] ([[J. Geils Band]]), the [[James Montgomery (singer)|James Montgomery Band]], [[Jon Butcher]], [[Sib Hashian]] ([[Boston (band)|Boston]]), [[Michael Carabello]] ([[Santana (band)|Santana]]), the Uptown Horns and James Cotton. Squier accepted Cotton's invitation in June to join him at the \"James Cotton's Blues Summit\" at [[Lincoln Center]] in NYC, along with the legendary [[Pinetop Perkins]], [[Hubert Sumlin]] ([[Howlin' Wolf]]'s band), [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and many more. In November, Squier appeared at the [[Iridium Jazz Club|Iridium]] in New York and played a double set that night, \"Blues Deluxe,\" that showcased songs from his blues upbringing and new versions of several of his hits.\n\nShout! Factory released ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]: 30th Anniversary Edition'' on July 27, 2010, marking the first time that this album had been remastered in over 20 years.

During Memorial Day weekend, Squier made a surprise appearance at the John Varvatos store in Easthampton, NY in support of his friend, rock photographer [[Rob Shanahan]] and his new book, \"Volume One.\" In June, Squier performed at the \"Industrial Hedgefund Awards Dinner\" in New York, in another fundraising effort for '[[Little Kids Rock]].' In September, Squier appeared as a guest during the set of the James Montgomery Band at the Westport Blues Festival. In December, Squier headlined a fund-raising concert for \"The American Revolution,\" a documentary on legendary rock FM station WBCN at the House Of Blues in Boston.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Squier performed his 'Electric Man' show at the Patchogue Music Festival on Long Island. In November, he played the Voodoo Festival in New Orleans. The Stooges, a local brass band (not to be confused with [[Iggy Pop]]'s band), joined Squier on \"The Stroke.\" At the same time, [[Eminem]] released '[[Berzerk (song)|Berzerk]]' which makes use of various samples from \"The Stroke.\" Later, on his 2014 effort, \"[[Shady XV]],\" he sampled \"[[My Kinda Lover]].\"\n\nIn September 2014, Squier took his 'Electric Man' show to the 9th Jack Show in Anaheim, CA.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nIn 2002, Squier married Nicole Schoen, a professional German soccer player. They divided their time between a home in [[Bridgehampton]], [[Long Island]] and an apartment in [[The San Remo]] on [[Central Park West]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Squier had been, as of 2016, an active volunteer for the [[Central Park Conservancy]] for more than 17 years, physically maintaining 20 acres (81,000 m2) of the park, as well as promoting the Conservancy in articles and interviews.

Rules can also request information from external programs to name a device or specify a custom name that will always be the same, regardless of the order devices are discovered by the system.\n\nIn the past a common way to use udev on Linux systems was to let it send events through a socket to [[HAL (software)|HAL]], which would perform further device-specific actions. For example, HAL would notify other software running on the system that the new hardware had arrived by issuing a broadcast message on the [[D-Bus]] [[Inter-process communication|IPC]] system to all interested [[process (computing)|processes]]. In this way, desktops such as [[GNOME]] or [[K Desktop Environment 3]] could start the [[file browser]] to browse the file systems of newly attached [[USB flash drive]]s and [[Secure Digital|SD cards]].<ref>{{cite web\n | url        = http://w3.linux-magazine.com/issue/71/Dynamic_Device_Management_in_Udev.pdf\n | title      = Dynamic Device Management in Udev\n | publisher  = Linux Magazine\n | date       = 2006-10-01\n | accessdate = 2008-07-14}}</ref>\n\nBy the middle of 2011 HAL had been deprecated by most Linux distributions as well as by the KDE, GNOME<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.debian.org/HALRemoval|title=HALRemoval|date=2011-06-28|accessdate=2011-09-13}}</ref> and [[Xfce]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gezeiten.org/pre-2014/post/2010/01/Thunar-volman-and-the-deprecation-of-HAL|title=Thunar-volman and the deprecation of HAL in Xfce|date=2010-01-17|accessdate=2017-12-25}}</ref> desktop environments, among others.

Initially a new daemon DeviceKit was planned to replace certain aspects of HAL, but in March 2009, DeviceKit was deprecated in favor of adding the same code to udev as a package: udev-extras, and some functions have now moved to udev proper.\n\n==History==\nudev was introduced in Linux 2.5. The Linux kernel version 2.6.13 introduced or updated a new version of the [[uevent]] interface. A system using a new version of udev will not boot with kernels older than 2.6.13 unless udev is disabled and a traditional <tt>/dev</tt> directory is used for device access.\n\nIn April 2012, udev's [[codebase]] was merged into the [[systemd]] source tree, making systemd 183 the first version to include udev.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite mailing list |last=Sievers |first=Kay |title=The future of the udev source tree |url=http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.hotplug.devel/17392 |mailing-list=linux-hotplug|date=2012-04-03|accessdate=2013-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{citation |last=Sievers |first=Kay |title=Commit importing udev into systemd |url=http://cgit.freedesktop.org/systemd/systemd/commit/?id=19c5f19d69bb5f520fa7213239490c55de06d99d |work=systemd |accessdate=2013-05-22}}</ref> In October 2012, [[Linus Torvalds]] criticized [[Kay Sievers]]'s approach to udev maintenance and bug fixing related to [[firmware]] loading, stating:<ref>{{cite mailing list|url=https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/10/3/484|title=Re: udev breakages|author=Linus Torvalds|mailing-list=linux-kernel|date=2012-10-03|accessdate=2014-10-28}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Yes, doing it in the kernel is \"more robust\". But don't play games, and stop the lying. It's more robust because we have maintainers that care, and because we know that regressions are not something we can play fast and loose with.

Not because firmware loading cannot be done in user space. But simply because udev maintenance since Greg gave it up has gone downhill.}}\n\nIn 2012, the [[Gentoo Linux]] project created a [[fork (software development)|fork]] of systemd's udev codebase in order to avoid dependency on the systemd architecture. The resulting fork is called ''[[eudev]]'' and it makes udev functionality available without systemd.

Rules can also request information from external programs to name a device or specify a custom name that will always be the same, regardless of the order devices are discovered by the system.\n\nIn the past a common way to use udev on Linux systems was to let it send events through a socket to [[HAL (software)|HAL]], which would perform further device-specific actions. For example, HAL would notify other software running on the system that the new hardware had arrived by issuing a broadcast message on the [[D-Bus]] [[Inter-process communication|IPC]] system to all interested [[process (computing)|processes]]. In this way, desktops such as [[GNOME]] or [[K Desktop Environment 3]] could start the [[file browser]] to browse the file systems of newly attached [[USB flash drive]]s and [[Secure Digital|SD cards]].<ref>{{cite web\n | url        = http://w3.linux-magazine.com/issue/71/Dynamic_Device_Management_in_Udev.pdf\n | title      = Dynamic Device Management in Udev\n | publisher  = Linux Magazine\n | date       = 2006-10-01\n | accessdate = 2008-07-14}}</ref>\n\nBy the middle of 2011 HAL had been deprecated by most Linux distributions as well as by the KDE, GNOME<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.debian.org/HALRemoval|title=HALRemoval|date=2011-06-28|accessdate=2011-09-13}}</ref> and [[Xfce]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gezeiten.org/pre-2014/post/2010/01/Thunar-volman-and-the-deprecation-of-HAL|title=Thunar-volman and the deprecation of HAL in Xfce|date=2010-01-17|accessdate=2017-12-25}}</ref> desktop environments, among others. The functionality previously embodied in HAL has been integrated into udev itself, or moved to separate software such as udisks and [[upower]].\n\n* udev provides low-level access to the linux device tree.

Applications talk to Network Manager over D-Bus.\n\n:<chem>Kernel -> udev -> Network Manager <=> D-Bus <=> Firefox</chem>\n\nHAL is obsolete and only used by legacy code. Ubuntu 10.04 shipped without HAL. Initially a new daemon DeviceKit was planned to replace certain aspects of HAL, but in March 2009, DeviceKit was deprecated in favor of adding the same code to udev as a package: udev-extras, and some functions have now moved to udev proper.\n\n==History==\nudev was introduced in Linux 2.5. The Linux kernel version 2.6.13 introduced or updated a new version of the [[uevent]] interface. A system using a new version of udev will not boot with kernels older than 2.6.13 unless udev is disabled and a traditional <tt>/dev</tt> directory is used for device access.\n\nIn April 2012, udev's [[codebase]] was merged into the [[systemd]] source tree, making systemd 183 the first version to include udev.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite mailing list |last=Sievers |first=Kay |title=The future of the udev source tree |url=http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.hotplug.devel/17392 |mailing-list=linux-hotplug|date=2012-04-03|accessdate=2013-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{citation |last=Sievers |first=Kay |title=Commit importing udev into systemd |url=http://cgit.freedesktop.org/systemd/systemd/commit/?id=19c5f19d69bb5f520fa7213239490c55de06d99d |work=systemd |accessdate=2013-05-22}}</ref> In October 2012, [[Linus Torvalds]] criticized [[Kay Sievers]]'s approach to udev maintenance and bug fixing related to [[firmware]] loading, stating:<ref>{{cite mailing list|url=https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/10/3/484|title=Re: udev breakages|author=Linus Torvalds|mailing-list=linux-kernel|date=2012-10-03|accessdate=2014-10-28}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Yes, doing it in the kernel is \"more robust\".

Not because firmware loading cannot be done in user space. But simply because udev maintenance since Greg gave it up has gone downhill.}}\n\nIn 2012, the [[Gentoo Linux]] project created a [[fork (software development)|fork]] of systemd's udev codebase in order to avoid dependency on the systemd architecture. The resulting fork is called ''[[eudev]]'' and it makes udev functionality available without systemd.

They belonged to a wealthy and influential family of [[Texas]] [[American pioneer|pioneers]], the Kokernots, but worked as [[cowboy]]s in [[Cochise County, Arizona|Cochise County]], Arizona. In 1898, the Halderman brothers began [[List of feuds in the United States|feuding]] with the eighteen-year-old Teddy Moore over a pair of young women named Rena and Mary Wilson. According to later court findings, in November 1898, Moore threatened to kill William and continued to do so over the following months. Finally, on April 6, 1899, [[Justice of the Peace|Justice]] [[Edward Landers Drew#Shootout at Sonoratown|William Monmonier]] received a report from the owner of the Smith Ranch, Buck Smith, accusing the Halderman brothers of stealing and killing [[cattle]]. A warrant was issued and the task of arresting the Haldermans fell onto Constable Chester Ainsworth, who was the brother of [[Arizona Attorney General|Attorney General]] Charles F. Ainsworth.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/><ref name=\"The Pacific Reporter, Volume 60, pg. 876-877\"/><ref name=\"Eppinga\"/><ref name=\"pend-oreille-ponderings.blogspot.com\" />\n\nBecause the Chiricahua Mountains were both wild and remote in 1899, Constable Ainsworth first went from his office in [[Pearce, Arizona|Pearce]] to the Smith Ranch to ask one of the ranchers there if he would assist in apprehending the Haldermans. However, according to R. Michael Wilson, Mr. Smith refused to help and told the constable to continue on to the Moore Ranch house, less than a mile away, to enlist the help of Teddy Moore. Ainsworth did just that and after deputizing Moore the two-man [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse]] headed to the Halderman Ranch, which was located a short distance away, along [[Turkey Creek, Arizona|Turkey Creek Canyon]]. After finding the house empty, Ainsworth decided to check Wilson Ranch, which was owned by John W. Wilson, who lived there with his sons, Johnny and Tol, and his two daughters, Rena and Mary.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/><ref name=\"The Pacific Reporter, Volume 60, pg. 876-877\"/><ref name=\"Eppinga\"/><ref name=\"pend-oreille-ponderings.blogspot.com\"/><ref name=\"gleesonarizona.com\">{{Cite web | title=A Price on his Head: Every Good Family Has One That Goes Wrong |work= |url=http://www.gleesonarizona.com/HistoricalSketches/PriceOnHisHead.pdf |date= |year= |accessdate=June 15, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"boothillgraves.com\">{{Cite web |title=Halderman Bros. |work= |url=http://www.boothillgraves.com/details/halderman_bros.htm?keepThis=true&TB_iframe=true&height=250&width=500 |date= |year= |accessdate=June 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Shootout==\nConstable Ainsworth and Teddy Moore arrived at the Wilson Ranch house on the morning of April 7, 1899, sometime after dawn, but before noon. The two lawmen were side by side and approximately forty feet from the front porch of the house when Ainsworth read the arrest warrant aloud and demanded that the Halderman brothers come out peaceably. When it seemed as though the two young men were going to surrender without resisting, Ainsworth suggested that they eat breakfast before leaving and pack some of their belongings for staying a few days in Pearce. However, while inside the house, the Haldermans decided that Moore intended to do them harm, rather than take them to jail, so they armed themselves and reappeared at the two front doors of the house, which were located at each end of the porch.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/><ref name=\"The Pacific Reporter, Volume 60, pg. 876-877\"/>\n\nThe Haldermans had only one rifle of their own and William armed himself with it while his brother took Mr. Wilson's rifle. According to the Haldermans, as soon as they were seen with weapons in hand, the lawmen drew their side arms and began shooting into the house. William responded by firing back and after emptying his weapon he ran across the porch to his shocked brother to take up his rifle and continue shooting at Moore. Unfortunately, however, it was during this time that Ainsworth was shot off his horse and killed, having been struck in the heart. William later claimed that the death of Ainsworth was an accident and even said that he might have been killed by Moore. After Ainsworth fell, Moore turned his horse around and started riding away from the house as fast as he could. At about 150 yards away, William fired again and struck Moore in the bowels with a single bullet, but the latter was able to make it back to the Moore Ranch, where he bled to death in his mother's arms a few hours later.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/><ref name=\"The Pacific Reporter, Volume 60, pg. 876-877\"/><ref name=\"pend-oreille-ponderings.blogspot.com\"/><ref name=\"findagrave.com\">{{Cite web | title=Find A Grave: William L.

He said that it was the Haldermans who fired first and, initially, the Wilson sisters substantiated the claim because their father, in fear of what his neighbors would do if the brothers were released, threatened to punish them if they did otherwise. It was only after the Haldermans were sentenced to death that the Wilson sisters finally came forward and told the truth about what they had witnessed. It made no difference though.<ref name=\"pend-oreille-ponderings.blogspot.com\"/><ref name=\"boothillgraves.com\"/>\n\nThe following appeared in the ''[[Pacific Reporter]], Volume 60'':\n\n{{quote|It appears from the record that on April 6, 1899, a complaint was lodged before W. [William] M. Monmonier, a justice of the peace for the precinct of Pearce, Cochise county, charging the Haldermans with having unlawfully killed cattle. A warrant was issued by the justice upon this complaint, and placed in the hands of one C. [Chester] L. Ainsworth, constable of the precinct, and a deputy sheriff [Teddy Moore] of the county.... They then went to the house of a neighbor by the name of [John W.] Wilson, where they found the defendants. Ainsworth and Moore rode to the front of the Wilson house, dismounted from their horses, and called the Haldermans out, where upon Ainsworth read his warrant of arrest to them. Both Haldermans expressed a willingness to go with the officer, but before starting, upon suggestion of the latter [Ainsworth], went into the house to get their breakfast. While they were inside, Ainsworth called to them, and told them, as they might be detained at Pierce [Pearce] for two or three days, to take with them such articles of wearing apparel [clothing] as they might need. Soon after, the Haldermans appeared, one at each of the two front doors of the house, armed with rifles, and at once opened fire, instantly killing Ainsworth, and mortally wounding Moore. As to the facts above stated, there is no substantial conflict in the evidence. The testimony of the witness for the prosecution, supported by the dying declaration of Moore, as to the circumstances of the shooting, is to the effect that at the time the Haldermans appeared at the doors, Ainsworth and Moore were both mounted, and a short distance from the house; that the Haldermans, as soon as they appeared, called to Ainsworth and Moore to hold up their hands, but without waiting, at once fired; that Ainsworth immediately fell from his horse, shot through the heart; that Moore turned his horse, and started off, but was shot through the bowels as he rode away; that after the shooting the Haldermans immediately fled. The story, as told by the defendants, was that between themselves and Moore had existed a deadly enmity; that, after the warrant had been read, they asked the constable how they were to be taken to Pierce; that they were then told that they would have to walk down to a neighboring ranch, where there was a conveyance of some sort; that; fearing that Moore might on some pretext seek occasion on the way down to the ranch to do them [the Halderman brothers] harm, they concluded while in the house to take their rifles with them; that, as soon as they appeared at the front of the house, Moore pulled his gun and fired; that William Halderman at once returned the fire, and continued shooting until he had emptied his gun, and, as Moore continued to shoot, he then ran to the other door, where his brother Thomas Halderman stood, and, seizing the latter{{'}}s gun, fired again at Moore, but by accident killed Ainsworth; that, fearing [lynch] mob violence at the hands of the friends of Ainsworth, the two then left the country [county].

Despite the small reward, the Haldermans were captured by Deputy Sid Mullen on April 12, while they were camped just across the border of New Mexico, east of [[Duncan, Arizona|Duncan]].<ref name=\"Wilson\"/><ref name=\"Eppinga\"/><ref name=\"legendsofamerica.com\">{{Cite web | title=Vigilantes and Bad Men of Arizona - Page 2| work= | url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/az-vigilantes2.html| date=| year=| accessdate =June 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Haldermans were first held in the jail at Pearce, and were later transferred to Tombstone for their trial. Early in the month of June, the court found the Haldermans guilty, convicted them of first-degree murder on June 11, and sentenced them to hang on August 10, 1900. Meanwhile, the Haldermans' family was trying its best to influence the court's decision in order \"to prevent a stain on the name of one of the best pioneer families of Texas.\" All they were able to achieve was a delay of the eventual execution. During that time, the Haldermans attempted to gather evidence which supported their claims that the allegations of [[cattle rustling]] were false and that the shootout was the result of a feud, rather than petty theft. The Haldermans claimed that Moore was responsible for the stolen cattle and that he was trying to frame them so he could then be free to woo Rena Wilson. The Haldermans sent in an appeal and because [[Governor of Arizona|Governor]] [[Nathan O. Murphy]] was out of state the application was sent to [[President of the United States|President]] [[William McKinley]], who granted them a stay of execution until October 5, 1900, so they could gather more evidence for their defense. When he returned, Governor Murphy extended the stay, but the Haldermans' evidence did not materialize and the date of execution was set for November 16, 1900. The Kokernot-Halderman family claimed that the trial was unfair, being that the [[prosecutor]] was none other than Attorney General Charles L. Ainsworth, Chester Ainsworth's brother, and that the [[jury]] was \"eager for a hanging.\"<ref name=\"Wilson\"/><ref name=\"pend-oreille-ponderings.blogspot.com\"/><ref name=\"boothillgraves.com\"/><ref name=\"kokernot.com\">{{Cite web | title=Kokernot Appendix: Children \"The apple never falls far from the tree.\"| work= | url=http://www.kokernot.com/appendixA/Appendix1Extract.pdf| date=| year=| accessdate =June 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe execution was carried out on November 16, as previously arranged. A large crowd gathered to witness the hanging, although only 100 invitations were given out. The rest of the onlookers watched from the windows of the [[Tombstone Courthouse State Historic Park|Old Cochise County Courthouse]]. Both of the Haldermans were reported as having met their end bravely. When Thomas Halderman appeared from the jail, he said: \"Hello, Hombres.... The son{{'}}s hot, ain{{'}}t it?\" After climbing up the scaffold, William said: \"Nice looking crowd.... Some of you fellers are shaking already.\" Then, as he turned to his brother, William said: \"Those people look alright.\" A moment later, Thomas placed a [[noose]] around his own neck while Sheriff White read the death warrant and his brother talked with a deputy named Bravin. When he was finished, Sheriff White asked the Haldermans if they wanted to say any last words. William responded: \"I have nothing to say and guess it would not do any good anyway. I forgive you all and hope you will forgive me.\" William then requested time for a prayer so [[Reverend]] Alexander Elliott stepped forward to assist. Black masks were then lowered over the Haldermans' heads and in chorus they said: \"Good-bye boys! Pray for us.\" The trap door underneath the Haldermans feet was opened at exactly 12:40 P.M. Thirteen minutes later, Thomas was pronounced dead and William two minutes after. The doctors at the scene reported that Thomas had died of a broken neck, but William's death was caused by \"the violent shock, compression of a vital nerve, and by strangulation.\"<ref name=\"Wilson\"/>\n\nThe Halderman brothers became the last criminals to be buried in Tombstone's [[Boot Hill#Boothill Graveyard|Boothill Graveyard]] and their graves can still be visited today.

Ainsworth.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/><ref name=\"The Pacific Reporter, Volume 60, pg. 876-877\"/><ref name=\"Eppinga\"/><ref name=\"pend-oreille-ponderings.blogspot.com\">{{Cite web | title=Pend Oreille Ponderings: Tombstone, Arizona, Hangings| work= | url=http://pend-oreille-ponderings.blogspot.com/2009/06/tombstone-arizona-hangings.html| date=| year=| accessdate =June 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\nBecause the Chiricahua Mountains were both wild and remote in 1899, Constable Ainsworth first went from his office in [[Pearce, Arizona|Pearce]] to the Smith Ranch to ask one of the ranchers there if he would assist in apprehending the Haldermans. However, according to R. Michael Wilson, Mr. Smith refused to help and told the constable to continue on to the Moore Ranch house, less than a mile away, to enlist the help of Teddy Moore. Ainsworth did just that and after deputizing Moore the two-man [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse]] headed to the Halderman Ranch, which was located a short distance away, along [[Turkey Creek, Arizona|Turkey Creek Canyon]]. After finding the house empty, Ainsworth decided to check Wilson Ranch, which was owned by John W. Wilson, who lived there with his sons, Johnny and Tol, and his two daughters, Rena and Mary.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/><ref name=\"The Pacific Reporter, Volume 60, pg. 876-877\"/><ref name=\"Eppinga\"/><ref name=\"pend-oreille-ponderings.blogspot.com\"/><ref name=\"gleesonarizona.com\">{{Cite web | title=A Price on his Head: Every Good Family Has One That Goes Wrong| work= | url=http://www.gleesonarizona.com/HistoricalSketches/PriceOnHisHead.pdf| date=| year=| accessdate =June 15, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"boothillgraves.com\">{{Cite web | title=Halderman Bros.| work= | url=http://www.boothillgraves.com/details/halderman_bros.htm?keepThis=true&TB_iframe=true&height=250&width=500| date=| year=| accessdate =June 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Shootout==\nConstable Ainsworth and Teddy Moore arrived at the Wilson Ranch house on the morning of April 7, 1899, sometime after dawn, but before noon. The two lawmen were side by side and approximately forty feet from the front porch of the house when Ainsworth read the arrest warrant aloud and demanded that the Halderman brothers come out peaceably. When it seemed as though the two young men were going to surrender without resisting, Ainsworth suggested that they eat breakfast before leaving and pack some of their belongings for staying a few days in Pearce. However, while inside the house, the Haldermans decided that Moore intended to do them harm, rather than take them to jail, so they armed themselves and reappeared at the two front doors of the house, which were located at each end of the porch.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/><ref name=\"The Pacific Reporter, Volume 60, pg. 876-877\"/>\n\nThe Haldermans had only one rifle of their own and William armed himself with it while his brother took Mr. Wilson's rifle. According to the Haldermans, as soon as they were seen with weapons in hand, the lawmen drew their side arms and began shooting into the house. William responded by firing back and after emptying his weapon he ran across the porch to his shocked brother to take up his rifle and continue shooting at Moore. Unfortunately, however, it was during this time that Ainsworth was shot off his horse and killed, having been struck in the heart. William later claimed that the death of Ainsworth was an accident and even said that he might have been killed by Moore. After Ainsworth fell, Moore turned his horse around and started riding away from the house as fast as he could. At about 150 yards away, William fired again and struck Moore in the bowels with a single bullet, but the latter was able to make it back to the Moore Ranch, where he bled to death in his mother's arms a few hours later.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/><ref name=\"The Pacific Reporter, Volume 60, pg. 876-877\"/><ref name=\"pend-oreille-ponderings.blogspot.com\"/><ref name=\"findagrave.com\">{{Cite web | title=Find A Grave: William L. Halderman| work= | url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/49725193| date=| year=| accessdate =June 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\nSometime before his death, Moore was able to tell his family what had happened. He said that it was the Haldermans who fired first and, initially, the Wilson sisters substantiated the claim because their father, in fear of what his neighbors would do if the brothers were released, threatened to punish them if they did otherwise. It was only after the Haldermans were sentenced to death that the Wilson sisters finally came forward and told the truth about what they had witnessed. It made no difference though.<ref name=\"pend-oreille-ponderings.blogspot.com\"/><ref name=\"boothillgraves.com\"/>\n\nThe following appeared in the ''[[Pacific Reporter]], Volume 60'':\n\n{{quote|It appears from the record that on April 6, 1899, a complaint was lodged before W. [William] M. Monmonier, a justice of the peace for the precinct of Pearce, Cochise county, charging the Haldermans with having unlawfully killed cattle. A warrant was issued by the justice upon this complaint, and placed in the hands of one C. [Chester] L. Ainsworth, constable of the precinct, and a deputy sheriff [Teddy Moore] of the county.... They then went to the house of a neighbor by the name of [John W.] Wilson, where they found the defendants. Ainsworth and Moore rode to the front of the Wilson house, dismounted from their horses, and called the Haldermans out, where upon Ainsworth read his warrant of arrest to them. Both Haldermans expressed a willingness to go with the officer, but before starting, upon suggestion of the latter [Ainsworth], went into the house to get their breakfast. While they were inside, Ainsworth called to them, and told them, as they might be detained at Pierce [Pearce] for two or three days, to take with them such articles of wearing apparel [clothing] as they might need. Soon after, the Haldermans appeared, one at each of the two front doors of the house, armed with rifles, and at once opened fire, instantly killing Ainsworth, and mortally wounding Moore. As to the facts above stated, there is no substantial conflict in the evidence. The testimony of the witness for the prosecution, supported by the dying declaration of Moore, as to the circumstances of the shooting, is to the effect that at the time the Haldermans appeared at the doors, Ainsworth and Moore were both mounted, and a short distance from the house; that the Haldermans, as soon as they appeared, called to Ainsworth and Moore to hold up their hands, but without waiting, at once fired; that Ainsworth immediately fell from his horse, shot through the heart; that Moore turned his horse, and started off, but was shot through the bowels as he rode away; that after the shooting the Haldermans immediately fled. The story, as told by the defendants, was that between themselves and Moore had existed a deadly enmity; that, after the warrant had been read, they asked the constable how they were to be taken to Pierce; that they were then told that they would have to walk down to a neighboring ranch, where there was a conveyance of some sort; that; fearing that Moore might on some pretext seek occasion on the way down to the ranch to do them [the Halderman brothers] harm, they concluded while in the house to take their rifles with them; that, as soon as they appeared at the front of the house, Moore pulled his gun and fired; that William Halderman at once returned the fire, and continued shooting until he had emptied his gun, and, as Moore continued to shoot, he then ran to the other door, where his brother Thomas Halderman stood, and, seizing the latter{{'}}s gun, fired again at Moore, but by accident killed Ainsworth; that, fearing [lynch] mob violence at the hands of the friends of Ainsworth, the two then left the country [county].

Despite the small reward, the Haldermans were captured by Deputy Sid Mullen on April 12, while they were camped just across the border of New Mexico, east of [[Duncan, Arizona|Duncan]].<ref name=\"Wilson\"/><ref name=\"Eppinga\"/><ref name=\"legendsofamerica.com\">{{Cite web | title=Vigilantes and Bad Men of Arizona - Page 2| work= | url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/az-vigilantes2.html| date=| year=| accessdate =June 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Haldermans were first held in the jail at Pearce, and were later transferred to Tombstone for their trial. Early in the month of June, the court found the Haldermans guilty, convicted them of first-degree murder on June 11, and sentenced them to hang on August 10, 1900. Meanwhile, the Haldermans' family was trying its best to influence the court's decision in order \"to prevent a stain on the name of one of the best pioneer families of Texas.\" All they were able to achieve was a delay of the eventual execution. During that time, the Haldermans attempted to gather evidence which supported their claims that the allegations of [[cattle rustling]] were false and that the shootout was the result of a feud, rather than petty theft. The Haldermans claimed that Moore was responsible for the stolen cattle and that he was trying to frame them so he could then be free to woo Rena Wilson. The Haldermans sent in an appeal and because [[Governor of Arizona|Governor]] [[Nathan O. Murphy]] was out of state the application was sent to [[President of the United States|President]] [[William McKinley]], who granted them a stay of execution until October 5, 1900, so they could gather more evidence for their defense. When he returned, Governor Murphy extended the stay, but the Haldermans' evidence did not materialize and the date of execution was set for November 16, 1900. The Kokernot-Halderman family claimed that the trial was unfair, being that the [[prosecutor]] was none other than Attorney General Charles L. Ainsworth, Chester Ainsworth's brother, and that the [[jury]] was \"eager for a hanging.\"<ref name=\"Wilson\"/><ref name=\"pend-oreille-ponderings.blogspot.com\"/><ref name=\"boothillgraves.com\"/><ref name=\"kokernot.com\">{{Cite web | title=Kokernot Appendix: Children \"The apple never falls far from the tree.\"| work= | url=http://www.kokernot.com/appendixA/Appendix1Extract.pdf| date=| year=| accessdate =June 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe execution was carried out on November 16, as previously arranged. A large crowd gathered to witness the hanging, although only 100 invitations were given out. The rest of the onlookers watched from the windows of the [[Tombstone Courthouse State Historic Park|Old Cochise County Courthouse]]. Both of the Haldermans were reported as having met their end bravely. When Thomas Halderman appeared from the jail, he said: \"Hello, Hombres.... The son{{'}}s hot, ain{{'}}t it?\" After climbing up the scaffold, William said: \"Nice looking crowd.... Some of you fellers are shaking already.\" Then, as he turned to his brother, William said: \"Those people look alright.\" A moment later, Thomas placed a [[noose]] around his own neck while Sheriff White read the death warrant and his brother talked with a deputy named Bravin. When he was finished, Sheriff White asked the Haldermans if they wanted to say any last words. William responded: \"I have nothing to say and guess it would not do any good anyway. I forgive you all and hope you will forgive me.\" William then requested time for a prayer so [[Reverend]] Alexander Elliott stepped forward to assist. Black masks were then lowered over the Haldermans' heads and in chorus they said: \"Good-bye boys! Pray for us.\" The trap door underneath the Haldermans feet was opened at exactly 12:40 P.M. Thirteen minutes later, Thomas was pronounced dead and William two minutes after. The doctors at the scene reported that Thomas had died of a broken neck, but William's death was caused by \"the violent shock, compression of a vital nerve, and by strangulation.\"<ref name=\"Wilson\"/>\n\nThe Halderman brothers became the last criminals to be buried in Tombstone's [[Boot Hill#Boothill Graveyard|Boothill Graveyard]] and their graves can still be visited today. The Old Cochise County Courthouse has also been restored so that it appears as it did in 1900, during the Haldermans' trial.<ref name=\"Eppinga\"/><ref name=\"interment.net\">{{Cite web | title=Boothill Graveyard Tombstone, Cochise County, Arizona| work= | url=http://www.interment.net/data/us/az/cochise/boothill/boothill.htm| date=| year=|accessdate =June 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAs for the Wilson family, Rena later committed suicide for her involvement in the case and in 1913 Mary was put in an [[insane asylum]] by her brother, Tol, who was killed shortly thereafter in what became known as the [[Gleeson Jail#History|Cottonwood Canyon Murder]].<ref name=\"pend-oreille-ponderings.blogspot.com\"/><ref name=\"gleesonarizona.com\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Arizona}}\n\n* [[List of Old West gunfights]]\n* [[Cochise County in the Old West]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Gunfights and feuds in the Old West}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wilson Ranch, Shootout at}}\n[[Category:1899 in Arizona Territory]]\n[[Category:1900 in Arizona Territory]]\n[[Category:1899 murders in the United States]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1899]]\n[[Category:April 1899 events]]\n[[Category:American police officers killed in the line of duty]]\n[[Category:American Old West gunfights]]\n[[Category:Deaths by firearm in Arizona]]\n[[Category:History of Cochise County, Arizona]]\n[[Category:Crimes in Arizona Territory]]\n[[Category:Murder in Arizona]]\n[[Category:Arizona folklore]]\n", "name_user": "Quebec99", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix duplicate ref names \u2013You can help!", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shootout_at_Wilson_Ranch"}

[[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and the [[England national football team|England national team]].\n\nHe began his professional career with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] but was unable

Park Rangers]], [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]] and [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]], before joining Cardiff permanently after his release by Manchester United in July 2010. He then joined [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] on a one-year deal with an option of a second year but turned it down in May 2013 in favour of a move to [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], where he remained for six years before joining Aston Villa in 2019.\n\nFormerly an international from under-16 to under-21 level, Heaton has been involved in senior England squads since 2015, finally making his senior debut against [[Australia national soccer team|Australia]] on 27 May 2016 in a [[UEFA Euro 2016]] warm-up fixture.\n\n==Club career==\n===Manchester United===\nBorn in [[Chester]], Cheshire,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://uk.soccerway.com/players/tom-heaton/2908/ |title=T.

midfield, but, after making 20 appearances for the [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] Under-17 team in the previous two seasons, he signed for United as a trainee on 8 July 2002.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He became a regular in the Under-17 team during the 2002\u201303 season, and picked up an [[FA Youth Cup]] winner's medal despite playing second fiddle to [[Luke Steele (footballer)|Luke Steele]] throughout the entire competition.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He made his first appearance in the reserve team the following season, starting in a 3\u20131 home win over [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in the Premier Reserve League on 2 October 2003.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} At the end of the 2003\u201304 season, Heaton was named on the bench

2004\u201305 season, Heaton had become the first-choice goalkeeper for the Manchester United reserve team, and was named on the bench for [[Stan Ternent]]'s testimonial on 17 August 2004, coming on as a 76th-minute substitute for Luke Steele after Steele had earlier come on for [[Tim Howard]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} With Heaton in goal for 17 of the 28 [[Premier Reserve League]] North matches and 12 of the 22 [[Central League (football)|Central League]] matches, the team went on to win both league titles by nine and five points respectively.{{citation needed|date=April

until 1 January 2006.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} During his time at Swindon, he played over 20 matches, saving a penalty on his debut, and was described as \"one for the future\" by manager

A month later, Bruce also sold some paintings to the American artist [[Walter Gay]], who was visiting Grez at the time. Bruce and Benedicks-Bruce continued to make annual visits to Grez up until 1894. They rented a small house, which had previously been the home of Carl Larsson and his wife Karin.

Bruce and Benedicks-Bruce continued to make annual visits to Grez up until 1894. They rented a small house, which had previously been the home of Carl Larsson and his wife Karin.

While working there, Reynolds met [[Joanne Woodward]], who helped him find an agent.\n\n\"I don't think I ever actually saw him perform,\" said Woodward later. \"I knew him as this cute, shy, attractive boy.

The film was ''[[Sayonara]]'' (1957). Reynolds was told he could not be in the film because he looked too much like [[Marlon Brando]]. Logan advised Reynolds to go to [[Hollywood]], although Reynolds did not feel confident enough to do so.<ref>Reynolds, pp. 63\u201365.</ref> (Another source says Reynolds did a screen test after [[Lew Wasserman]] saw the effect he had on secretaries in his office but the test was unsuccessful.<ref name=\"river\">Riverboat Set to Sink Maverick\nWolters, Larry.

He then directed his second film, ''[[The End (1978 film)|The End]]'' (1978), a black comedy, playing a role originally written for [[Woody Allen]].<ref>I'm a Star in Spite of My Movies': Burt Reynolds By ROBERT LINDSEY. New York Times15 Jan 1978: D11.</ref>\n\nMore popular was a car comedy he made with Needham and Field, ''[[Hooper (film)|Hooper]]'' (1978), where he played a stuntman.\n\n\"My ability as an actor gets a little better every time,\" he said around this time. \"I'm very prolific in the amount of films I make - two-and-a-half or three a year - and when I look at any picture I do now compared to ''Deliverance'', it's miles above what I was doing then. But when you're doing films that are somewhat similar to each other, as I've been doing, people take it for granted.\"<ref name=\"end\">'The End' is just the beginning\nMcBride, Joseph; Riley, Brooks.

I'd rather do that than anything. It's the second-best sensation I've ever had.\" He added that [[David Merrick]] had offered to produce two films Reynolds would direct without having to act in them.<ref name=\"end\"/>\n \nReynolds tried a change of pace with ''[[Starting Over (1979 film)|Starting Over]]'' (1979), a romantic comedy again co-starring Clayburgh and [[Candice Bergen]]; it was co-written and produced by [[James L. Brooks]]. He played a jewel thief in ''[[Rough Cut (1980 film)|Rough Cut]]'' (1980) produced by Merrick, who fired and then rehired director [[Don Siegel]] during filming.\n\nReynolds had two huge hits with car films directed by Needham, ''[[Smokey and the Bandit II]]'' (1980) and ''[[The Cannonball Run]]'' (1981). He starred in [[David Steinberg]]'s film ''[[Paternity (film)|Paternity]]'' (1981) and directed himself in a tough action film, ''[[Sharky's Machine]]'' (1981).\n\nReynolds wanted to try a musical again and so agreed to do ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' (1982). It was box-office hit, as was ''[[Best Friends (1982 film)|Best Friends]]'' (1982) with [[Goldie Hawn]]. In 1982, Reynolds was voted the most popular star in the US for the fifth year in a row.\n\nAround this time he reflected:\n<blockquote>The only thing I really enjoy is this business, and I think my audience knows that. I've never been able to figure out exactly who that audience is. I know there have been a few pictures even my mother didn't go see, but there's always been an audience for them. I guess it is because they always know that I give it 100 percent, and good or bad, there's going to be quite a lot of me in that picture. That's what they're looking for. I don't have any pretensions about wanting to be Hamlet. I would just like to be the best Burt Reynolds around.<ref name=\"way\">HE'S MAKING MOVIES HIS WAY\nNorbom, Mary Ann. Philadelphia Inquirer; Philadelphia, Pa. [Philadelphia, Pa]04 Aug 1983: D.1.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Career decline===\n[[James L. Brooks]] offered Reynolds the role of astronaut Garrett Breedlove in ''[[Terms of Endearment]]'' (1983) but he turned it down to do ''[[Stroker Ace]]'' (1983), another car chase comedy directed by Needham. The ''Endearment'' role went to [[Jack Nicholson]], who went on to win an [[Academy Award]]. Reynolds said he made this decision because \"I felt I owed Hal more than I owed [[James L. Brooks|Jim]]\" but ''Stroker Ace'' flopped. Reynolds felt this was a turning point in his career from which he never recovered. \"That's where I lost them,\" he says of his fans.<ref name=\"los\">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-01-04/entertainment/ca-1803_1_burt-reynolds|title=Burt Reynolds is the Comeback Kid|last=Modderno|first=Craig|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|location=Los Angeles, Calif|date=January 4, 1987|page=L6|accessdate=July 2, 2014}}]</ref>\n\n''[[The Man Who Loved Women (1983 film)|The Man Who Loved Women]]'' (1983), directed by [[Blake Edwards]] also flopped.  In an interview around this time he said:\n<blockquote>Getting to the top has turned out to be a hell of a lot more fun than staying there. I've got [[Tom Selleck]] crawling up my back. I'm in my late 40s. I realize I have four or five more years where I can play certain kinds of parts and get away with it. That's why I'm leaning more and more toward directing and producing. I don't want to be stumbling around town doing [[Gabby Hayes]] parts a few years from now. I'd like to pick and choose and maybe go work for a perfume factory like Mr. [[Cary Grant]], and look wonderful with everybody saying, 'Gee, I wish he hadn't retired.<ref name=\"way\"/></blockquote>\n''[[Cannonball Run II]]'' (1984), directed by Needham, brought in some money but only half of the original. ''[[City Heat]]'' (1984), which teamed Reynolds and Eastwood was mildly popular but was considered a major critical and box office disappointment. He was injured during filming, causing him to lose weight and for rumors to begin that he had AIDS.<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\nReynolds returned to directing with ''[[Stick (film)|Stick]]'' (1985) from an [[Elmore Leonard]] novel but it was both a critical and commercial failure. So too were three other action films he made: ''[[Heat (1986 film)|Heat]]'' (1986), based on a [[William Goldman]] novel, ''[[Malone (film)|Malone]]'' (1987), and ''[[Rent-a-Cop]]'' (1987) with Liza Minnelli.<ref name=\"los\"/> He later said he did ''Heat'' and ''Malone'' \"because there were so many rumors about me [about AIDS]. I had to get out and be seen.\"<ref name=\"rap\"/>\n\nReynolds attempted a screwball comedy, ''[[Switching Channels]]'' (1989), but it too was a box office disappointment. Even more poorly received was ''[[Physical Evidence]]'' (1989), directed by [[Michael Crichton]]. Reynolds received excellent reviews for the caper comedy ''[[Breaking In (1989 film)|Breaking In]]'' (1989), but the commercial reception was poor.<ref name=\"sayles\">Gerry Molyneaux, \"John Sayles'', Renaissance Books, 2000 p 182</ref>\n\n\"When I was doing very well,\" he said at the time, \"I wasn't conscious I was doing very well, but I became very conscious when I wasn't doing very well. The atmosphere changed.\"<ref name=\"rap\">REYNOLDS RAP Scott, Jay.

It ran two seasons, during which time Reynolds played a supporting part in ''[[Modern Love (1990 film)|Modern Love]]'' (1990).\n\nReynolds then starred in a sitcom, ''[[Evening Shade]]'' (1990\u201394) as Woodward \"Wood\" Newton. The program was a considerable success and ran for four seasons and 98 episodes. This role earned him an Emmy Award.\n\nDuring his tenure on ''Evening Shade,'' Reynolds was seen in other projects.

However, he gradually moved into being more of a character actor - he had key support roles in ''[[Citizen Ruth]]'' (1996), an early work from [[Alexander Payne]], and ''[[Striptease (film)|Striptease]]'' (1996) with [[Demi Moore]]. He had to audition for the latter. The film's producer later said, \"To be honest, we were not enthusiastic at first.

Duncan III]]. Duncan pushed him into trying out for a play he was producing, ''[[Outward Bound (play)|Outward Bound]]''. He cast him in the lead role based on having heard him read Shakespeare in class, leading to his winning the 1956 Florida State Drama Award for his performance. \"I read two words and they gave me a lead,\" he later said.<ref name=\"macho\">BURT REYNOLDS: GOING BEYOND MACHO\nCohen, Barney New York Times29 Mar 1981: A.18.</ref>\n\nIn his autobiography, he referred to Duncan as his mentor and the most influential person in his life.<ref>Reynolds, pp. 57\u201359.</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Theatre===\n[[File:Burt Reynolds With Citrus Queen at Garnet and Gold Football Game.jpg|left|thumb|Reynolds with the Citrus Queen at Garnet and Gold Football Game, Florida State University, 1963]]\nThe Florida State Drama Award included a scholarship to the Hyde Park Playhouse, a [[summer stock theatre]], in [[Hyde Park, New York]].

While working there, Reynolds met [[Joanne Woodward]], who helped him find an agent.\n\n\"I don't think I ever actually saw him perform,\" said Woodward later. \"I knew him as this cute, shy, attractive boy.

The film was ''[[Sayonara]]'' (1957). Reynolds was told he could not be in the film because he looked too much like [[Marlon Brando]]. Logan advised Reynolds to go to [[Hollywood]], although Reynolds did not feel confident enough to do so.<ref>Reynolds, pp. 63\u201365.</ref> (Another source says Reynolds did a screen test after [[Lew Wasserman]] saw the effect he had on secretaries in his office but the test was unsuccessful.<ref name=\"river\">Riverboat Set to Sink Maverick\nWolters, Larry.

He then directed his second film, ''[[The End (1978 film)|The End]]'' (1978), a black comedy, playing a role originally written for [[Woody Allen]].<ref>I'm a Star in Spite of My Movies': Burt Reynolds By ROBERT LINDSEY. New York Times15 Jan 1978: D11.</ref>\n\nMore popular was a car comedy he made with Needham and Field, ''[[Hooper (film)|Hooper]]'' (1978), where he played a stuntman.\n\n\"My ability as an actor gets a little better every time,\" he said around this time. \"I'm very prolific in the amount of films I make - two-and-a-half or three a year - and when I look at any picture I do now compared to ''Deliverance'', it's miles above what I was doing then. But when you're doing films that are somewhat similar to each other, as I've been doing, people take it for granted.\"<ref name=\"end\">'The End' is just the beginning\nMcBride, Joseph; Riley, Brooks.

I'd rather do that than anything. It's the second-best sensation I've ever had.\" He added that [[David Merrick]] had offered to produce two films Reynolds would direct without having to act in them.<ref name=\"end\"/>\n \nReynolds tried a change of pace with ''[[Starting Over (1979 film)|Starting Over]]'' (1979), a romantic comedy again co-starring Clayburgh and [[Candice Bergen]]; it was co-written and produced by [[James L. Brooks]]. He played a jewel thief in ''[[Rough Cut (1980 film)|Rough Cut]]'' (1980) produced by Merrick, who fired and then rehired director [[Don Siegel]] during filming.\n\nReynolds had two huge hits with car films directed by Needham, ''[[Smokey and the Bandit II]]'' (1980) and ''[[The Cannonball Run]]'' (1981). He starred in [[David Steinberg]]'s film ''[[Paternity (film)|Paternity]]'' (1981) and directed himself in a tough action film, ''[[Sharky's Machine]]'' (1981).\n\nReynolds wanted to try a musical again and so agreed to do ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' (1982). It was box-office hit, as was ''[[Best Friends (1982 film)|Best Friends]]'' (1982) with [[Goldie Hawn]]. In 1982, Reynolds was voted the most popular star in the US for the fifth year in a row.\n\nAround this time he reflected:\n<blockquote>The only thing I really enjoy is this business, and I think my audience knows that. I've never been able to figure out exactly who that audience is. I know there have been a few pictures even my mother didn't go see, but there's always been an audience for them. I guess it is because they always know that I give it 100 percent, and good or bad, there's going to be quite a lot of me in that picture. That's what they're looking for. I don't have any pretensions about wanting to be Hamlet. I would just like to be the best Burt Reynolds around.<ref name=\"way\">HE'S MAKING MOVIES HIS WAY\nNorbom, Mary Ann. Philadelphia Inquirer; Philadelphia, Pa. [Philadelphia, Pa]04 Aug 1983: D.1.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Career decline===\n[[James L. Brooks]] offered Reynolds the role of astronaut Garrett Breedlove in ''[[Terms of Endearment]]'' (1983) but he turned it down to do ''[[Stroker Ace]]'' (1983), another car chase comedy directed by Needham. The ''Endearment'' role went to [[Jack Nicholson]], who went on to win an [[Academy Award]]. Reynolds said he made this decision because \"I felt I owed Hal more than I owed [[James L. Brooks|Jim]]\" but ''Stroker Ace'' flopped. Reynolds felt this was a turning point in his career from which he never recovered. \"That's where I lost them,\" he says of his fans.<ref name=\"los\">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-01-04/entertainment/ca-1803_1_burt-reynolds|title=Burt Reynolds is the Comeback Kid|last=Modderno|first=Craig|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|location=Los Angeles, Calif|date=January 4, 1987|page=L6|accessdate=July 2, 2014}}]</ref>\n\n''[[The Man Who Loved Women (1983 film)|The Man Who Loved Women]]'' (1983), directed by [[Blake Edwards]] also flopped.  In an interview around this time he said:\n<blockquote>Getting to the top has turned out to be a hell of a lot more fun than staying there. I've got [[Tom Selleck]] crawling up my back. I'm in my late 40s. I realize I have four or five more years where I can play certain kinds of parts and get away with it. That's why I'm leaning more and more toward directing and producing. I don't want to be stumbling around town doing [[Gabby Hayes]] parts a few years from now. I'd like to pick and choose and maybe go work for a perfume factory like Mr. [[Cary Grant]], and look wonderful with everybody saying, 'Gee, I wish he hadn't retired.<ref name=\"way\"/></blockquote>\n''[[Cannonball Run II]]'' (1984), directed by Needham, brought in some money but only half of the original. ''[[City Heat]]'' (1984), which teamed Reynolds and Eastwood was mildly popular but was considered a major critical and box office disappointment. He was injured during filming, causing him to lose weight and for rumors to begin that he had AIDS.<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\nReynolds returned to directing with ''[[Stick (film)|Stick]]'' (1985) from an [[Elmore Leonard]] novel but it was both a critical and commercial failure. So too were three other action films he made: ''[[Heat (1986 film)|Heat]]'' (1986), based on a [[William Goldman]] novel, ''[[Malone (film)|Malone]]'' (1987), and ''[[Rent-a-Cop]]'' (1987) with Liza Minnelli.<ref name=\"los\"/> He later said he did ''Heat'' and ''Malone'' \"because there were so many rumors about me [about AIDS]. I had to get out and be seen.\"<ref name=\"rap\"/>\n\nReynolds attempted a screwball comedy, ''[[Switching Channels]]'' (1989), but it too was a box office disappointment. Even more poorly received was ''[[Physical Evidence]]'' (1989), directed by [[Michael Crichton]]. Reynolds received excellent reviews for the caper comedy ''[[Breaking In (1989 film)|Breaking In]]'' (1989), but the commercial reception was poor.<ref name=\"sayles\">Gerry Molyneaux, \"John Sayles'', Renaissance Books, 2000 p 182</ref>\n\n\"When I was doing very well,\" he said at the time, \"I wasn't conscious I was doing very well, but I became very conscious when I wasn't doing very well. The atmosphere changed.\"<ref name=\"rap\">REYNOLDS RAP Scott, Jay.

It ran two seasons, during which time Reynolds played a supporting part in ''[[Modern Love (1990 film)|Modern Love]]'' (1990).\n\nReynolds then starred in a sitcom, ''[[Evening Shade]]'' (1990\u201394) as Woodward \"Wood\" Newton. The program was a considerable success and ran for four seasons and 98 episodes. This role earned him an Emmy Award.\n\nDuring his tenure on ''Evening Shade,'' Reynolds was seen in other projects.

However, he gradually moved into being more of a character actor - he had key support roles in ''[[Citizen Ruth]]'' (1996), an early work from [[Alexander Payne]], and ''[[Striptease (film)|Striptease]]'' (1996) with [[Demi Moore]]. He had to audition for the latter. The film's producer later said, \"To be honest, we were not enthusiastic at first.
