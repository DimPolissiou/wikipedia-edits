The video starts off with the first teenager with a shaved head who walks into a restaurant where the other two are. The three are revealed to have been planning to buy a car with the money that they have saved. They make it to a dealership that sells used cars and they are able to purchase one, with they take on a ride to a country fair. The three are revealed to be in a band and play for the patrons at the festival. They then sneak into a motel where they proceed to sing and dance while in the shower, all while still clothed. The next morning, they escape just as the hotel manager notices and gives chase before their car breaks down. The girl invites the boys to follow her into the woods and they come across a cliff with a view of the city, which they gaze into in amusement. The video ends after this scene.\n\n==Track listing==\n#\"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\" (Original Mix)\n#\"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\" (Harry 'Choo Choo' Romero's Titanium Dub)\n#\"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\" (Roy's Universal Soldiers Mix)\n#\"Lady\" (Acoustic)\n\n'''CD1'''\n#\"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\" (radio edit)\n#\"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\" (album version)\n#\"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\" (Roy's Universal Soldiers Mix)\n#\"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\" (Roy's Universal Radio Mix)\n\n'''CD2'''\n#\"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\" (radio edit)\n#\"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\"\n#\"Rollercoaster\" (Avid Rovers Mix)\n#\"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\" (Remix)\n\n==Charts and certifications==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (2000\u20132001)\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n{{singlechart|Australia|10|artist=Modjo|song=Lady (Hear Me Tonight)|rowheader=true|refname=\"aus\"}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Austria|8|artist=Modjo|song=Lady (Hear Me Tonight)|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Flanders|5|artist=Modjo|song=Lady (Hear Me Tonight)|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Wallonia|7|artist=Modjo|song=Lady (Hear Me Tonight)|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Canada ([[Canadian Singles Chart|Nielsen SoundScan]])<ref name=\"can\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/modjo/chart-history/CNS|title=Modjo Chart History (Canadian Digital Songs)|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=17 March 2019}}</ref>\n|2\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Denmark ([[Tracklisten]])<ref>{{cite journal|date=30 September 2000|title=Hits of the World: Denmark (IFPI/Nielsen Marketing Research) 09/11/00|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|volume=112|issue=40|page=53|issn=0006-2510}}</ref>\n|3\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe ([[European Hot 100 Singles|Eurochart Hot 100]])<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0BAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA57&dq=modjo+lady+hear+me+tonight+europe&hl=en&sa=X&ei=BQNhT9WnHKL50gGMwICnBw&ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=modjo%20lady%20hear%20me%20tonight%20europe&f=false Eurochart peak]</ref>\n|1\n|-\n{{singlechart|Finland|3|artist=Modjo|song=Lady (Hear Me Tonight)|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|France|7|artist=Modjo|song=Lady (Hear Me Tonight)|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Germany2|2|artist=Modjo|song=Lady (Hear Me Tonight)|songid=4396|rowheader=true|accessdate=17 March 2019}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Greece ([[IFPI Greece|IFPI]])<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Music-and-Media/00s/2000/MM-2000-10-28.pdf|title=Top 10 Greece|magazine=[[Music & Media]]|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n|1\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Hungary ([[Association of Hungarian Record Companies|Mahasz]])<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Music-and-Media/00s/2000/MM-2000-11-25.pdf|title=Top 10 Hungary|magazine=[[Music & Media]]|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n|1 \n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Iceland ([[\u00cdslenski listinn|\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40]])<ref>{{cite newspaper|url=https://timarit.is/page/3006447#page/n9/mode/2up|title=\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40 (Vikuna 31.9. \u2013 6.10. 2000 39.

The video starts off with the first teenager with a shaved head who walks into a restaurant where the other two are. The three are revealed to have been planning to buy a car with the money that they have saved. They make it to a dealership that sells used cars and they are able to purchase one, with they take on a ride to a country fair. The three are revealed to be in a band and play for the patrons at the festival. They then sneak into a motel where they proceed to sing and dance while in the shower, all while still clothed. The next morning, they escape just as the hotel manager notices and gives chase before their car breaks down. The girl invites the boys to follow her into the woods and they come across a cliff with a view of the city, which they gaze into in amusement.

{"title_page": "Kansei engineering", "text_new": "{{COI|date=February 2014}}\n{{Use Harvard referencing|date=July 2019}}\n\n'''Kansei engineering''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: \u611f\u6027\u5de5\u5b66 ''kansei kougaku'', emotional or affective engineering) aims at the development or improvement of products and services by translating the customer's [[Sensibility|psychological feelings and needs]] into the domain of product design (i.e. parameters). It was founded by [[Mitsuo Nagamachi]], Professor Emeritus of [[Hiroshima University]] (also former Dean of [[Hiroshima International University]] and CEO of [[International Kansei Design Institute]]).  Kansei engineering parametrically links the customer's emotional responses (i.e. physical and psychological) to the properties and characteristics of a product or service. In consequence, products can be designed to bring forward the intended feeling.\n\nIt has now been adopted as one of the topics for [[professional development]] by the [[Royal Statistical Society]].\n\n==Introduction==\n{{essay-like|date=January 2018}}\nProduct design on today's markets has become increasingly complex since products contain more functions and have to meet increasing demands such as user-friendliness, manufacturability and ecological considerations. With a shortened [[product lifecycle]], development costs are likely to increase. Since errors in the estimations of market trends can be very expensive, companies therefore perform benchmarking studies that compare with competitors on strategic, process, marketing, and product levels. However, success in a certain market segment not only requires knowledge about the competitors and the performance of competing products, but also about the impressions which a product leaves to the customer. The latter requirement becomes much more important as products and companies are becoming mature. Customers purchase products based on subjective terms such as [[brand image]], reputation, design, impression etc.. A large number of manufacturers have started to consider such subjective properties and develop their products in a way that conveys the company image. A reliable instrument is therefore needed: an instrument which can predict the reception of a product on the market before the development costs become too large.\n\nThis demand has triggered the research dealing with the translation of the customer's subjective, hidden needs into concrete products. Research is done foremost in Asia, including Japan and Korea. In Europe, a network has been forged under the 6th EU framework. This network refers to the new research field as \"[[emotional design]]\" or \"affective engineering\".\n\n== History ==\n\nNowadays, people want to use products that are functional at the physical level, usable at the psychological level and attractive at the subjective, emotional level{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}. Affective engineering is the study of the interactions between the customer and the product at that third level. It focuses on the relationships between the physical traits of a product and its affective influence on the user. Thanks to this field of research, it is possible to gain knowledge on how to design more attractive products and make the customers satisfied.\n\nMethods in affective engineering (or Kansei engineering) is one of the major areas of [[ergonomics]] (human factor engineering ){{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}.  The study of integrating affective values in artefacts is not new at all. Already in the 18th century philosophers such as [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] established the area of aesthetics. In addition to pure practical values, artefacts always also had an affective component. One example is jewellery found in excavations from the stone ages. The period of Renaissance is also a good example.\n\nIn the middle of the 20th century, the idea of aesthetics was deployed in scientific contexts. [[Charles E. Osgood]] developed his [[semantic differential]] method in which he quantified the peoples' perceptions of artefacts. Some years later, in 1960, Professors Shigeru Mizuno and [[Yoji Akao]] developed an engineering approach in order to connect peoples' needs to product properties. This method was called [[quality function deployment]] (QFD). Another method, the [[Kano model]], was developed in the field of quality in the early 1980s by Professor [[Noriaki Kano]], of Tokyo University. Kano's model is used to establish the importance of individual product features for the customer's satisfaction and hence it creates the optimal requirement for process oriented product development activities. A pure marketing technique is [[Conjoint analysis (marketing)|conjoint analysis]]. Conjoint analysis estimates the relative importance of a product's attributes by analysing the consumer's overall judgment of a product or service. A more artistic method is called Semantic description of environments. It is mainly a tool for examining how a single person or a group of persons experience a certain (architectural) environment.\n\nAlthough all of these methods are concerned with subjective impact, none of them can translate this impact to design parameters sufficiently. This can, however, be accomplished by Kansei engineering. Kansei engineering (KE) has been used as a tool for affective engineering. It was developed in the early 70s in Japan and is now widely spread among Japanese companies. In the middle of the 90s, the method spread to the United States, but cultural differences may have prevented the method to enfold its whole potential.\n\n==Procedure ==\n\nAs mentioned above, Kansei engineering can be considered as a methodology within the research field of 'affective engineering'. Some researchers have identified the content of the methodology. Shimizu et al. state that 'Kansei Engineering is used as a tool for product development and the basic principles behind it are the following: identification of product properties and correlation between those properties and the design characteristics'.\n\nAccording to Nagasawa, one of the forerunners of Kansei engineering, there are three focal points in the method:\n# How to accurately understand consumer Kansei\n# How to reflect and translate Kansei understanding into product design\n# How to create a system and organization for Kansei orientated design\n\n== A model on methodology ==\n\nIn Japanese publications{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}, different types of Kansei engineering are identified and applied in various contexts. Sch\u00fctte examined different types of Kansei engineering and developed a general model covering the contents of Kansei engineering.\n\n; Choice of Domain\n''Domain'' in this context describes the overall idea behind an assembly of products, i.e. the product type in general. Choosing the domain includes the definition of the intended target group and user type, market-niche and type, and the product group in question. Choosing and defining the domain are carried out on existing products, concepts and on design solutions yet unknown. From this, a domain description is formulated, serving as the basis for further evaluation. The process is necessary and has been described by Sch\u00fctte in detail in a couple of publications.\n\n; Span the Semantic Space\nThe expression ''Semantic Space'' was addressed for the first time by Osgood et al.. He posed that every artifact can be described in a certain vector space defined by semantic expressions (words). This is done by collecting a large number of words that describe the domain. Suitable sources are pertinent literature, commercials, manuals, specification list, experts etc. The number of the words gathered varies according to the product, typically between 100 and 1000 words. In a second step the words are grouped using manual (e.g. Affinity diagram, compare: Bergman and Klefsj\u00f6, 1994) or mathematical methods (e.g. factor and/or cluster analysis, compare: Ishihara et al., 1998). Finally a few representing words are selected from this spanning the Semantic Space. These words are called \"Kansei words\" or \"Kansei Engineering words\".\n\n; Span the Space of Properties\nThe next step is to span the Space of Product Properties, which is similar to the Semantic Space. The Space of Product Properties collects products representing the domain, identifies key features and selects product properties for further evaluation.\nThe collection of products representing the domain is done from different sources such as existing products, customer suggestions, possible technical solutions and design concepts etc. The key features are found using specification lists for the products in question. To select properties for further evaluation, a Pareto-diagram (compare Bergman and Klefsj\u00f6, 1994) can assist the decision between important and less important features.\nSynthesis\nIn the synthesis step, the Semantic Space and the Space of Properties are linked together, as displayed in Figure 3. Compared to other methods in Affective Engineering, Kansei engineering is the only method that can establish and quantify connections between abstract feelings and technical specifications. For every Kansei word a number of product properties are found, affecting the Kansei word.\n\n; Synthesis\nThe research into constructing these links has been a core part of Nagamachi's work with Kansei engineering in the last few years. Nowadays, a number of different tools is available. Some of the most common tools are :\n\n* Category Identification\n* Regression Analysis /Quantification Theory Type I\n* Rough Sets Theory\n* Genetic Algorithm\n* Fuzzy Sets Theory\n\n; Model building and Test of Validity\nAfter doing the necessary stages, the final step of validation remains. This is done in order to check if the prediction model is reliable and realistic. However, in case of prediction model failure, it is necessary to update the Space of Properties and the Semantic Space, and consequently refine the model.\nThe process of refinement is difficult due to the shortage of methods. This shows the need of new tools to be integrated. The existing tools can partially be found in the previously mentioned methods for the synthesis.\n\n==Software tools==\nKansei engineering has always been a statically and mathematically advanced methodology. Most types require good expert knowledge and a reasonable amount of experience to carry out the studies sufficiently. This has also been the major obstacle for a widespread application of Kansei engineering.\nIn order to facilitate application some software packages have been developed in the recent years, most of them in Japan. There are two different types of software packages available: User consoles and data collection and analysis tools. User consoles are software programs that calculate and propose a product design based on the users' subjective preferences (Kanseis). However, such software requires a database that quantifies the connections between Kanseis and the combination of product attributes. For building such databases, data collection and analysis tools can be used. This part of the paper demonstrates some of the tools. There are many more tools used in companies and universities, which might not be available to the public.\nUser consoles\n\n== Software ==\n\nAs described above, Kansei data collection and analysis is often complex and connected with statistical analysis. Depending on which synthesis method is used, different computer software is used. Kansei Engineering Software (KESo) uses QT1 for linear analysis. The concept of Kansei Engineering Software (KESo) Link\u00f6ping University in Sweden. The software generates online questionnaires for collection of Kansei raw-data. It is freely availiable at [http://www.kanseiengineering.net www.kanseiengineering.net]\n\nAnother software package (Kn6) was developed at the [[Polytechnic University of Valencia]] in Spain.\n\nBoth software packages improve the collection and evaluation of Kansei data. In this way even users with no specialist competence in advanced statistics can use Kansei engineering.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Affective computing]]\n*[[Gandhian engineering]] \u2013 for low cost, frugal, large distribution product design.\n*[[Fahrvergn\u00fcgen]]\n*[[Japanese quality]]\n\n== References ==\n* Akao, Y., History of Quality Function Deployment in Japan.

It was founded by [[Mitsuo Nagamachi]], Professor Emeritus of [[Hiroshima University]] (also former Dean of [[Hiroshima International University]] and CEO of [[International Kansei Design Institute]]).  Kansei engineering parametrically links the customer's emotional responses (i.e. physical and psychological) to the properties and characteristics of a product or service. In consequence, products can be designed to bring forward the intended feeling.\n\nIt has now been adopted as one of the topics for [[professional development]] by the [[Royal Statistical Society]].\n\n==Introduction==\n{{essay-like|date=January 2018}}\nProduct design on today's markets has become increasingly complex since products contain more functions and have to meet increasing demands such as user-friendliness, manufacturability and ecological considerations. With a shortened [[product lifecycle]], development costs are likely to increase. Since errors in the estimations of market trends can be very expensive, companies therefore perform benchmarking studies that compare with competitors on strategic, process, marketing, and product levels. However, success in a certain market segment not only requires knowledge about the competitors and the performance of competing products, but also about the impressions which a product leaves to the customer. The latter requirement becomes much more important as products and companies are becoming mature. Customers purchase products based on subjective terms such as [[brand image]], reputation, design, impression etc.. A large number of manufacturers have started to consider such subjective properties and develop their products in a way that conveys the company image. A reliable instrument is therefore needed: an instrument which can predict the reception of a product on the market before the development costs become too large.\n\nThis demand has triggered the research dealing with the translation of the customer's subjective, hidden needs into concrete products. Research is done foremost in Asia, including Japan and Korea. In Europe, a network has been forged under the 6th EU framework. This network refers to the new research field as \"[[emotional design]]\" or \"affective engineering\".\n\n== History ==\n\nNowadays, people want to use products that are functional at the physical level, usable at the psychological level and attractive at the subjective, emotional level{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}. Affective engineering is the study of the interactions between the customer and the product at that third level. It focuses on the relationships between the physical traits of a product and its affective influence on the user. Thanks to this field of research, it is possible to gain knowledge on how to design more attractive products and make the customers satisfied.\n\nMethods in affective engineering (or Kansei engineering) is one of the major areas of [[ergonomics]] (human factor engineering ){{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}.  The study of integrating affective values in artefacts is not new at all. Already in the 18th century philosophers such as [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] established the area of aesthetics. In addition to pure practical values, artefacts always also had an affective component. One example is jewellery found in excavations from the stone ages. The period of Renaissance is also a good example.\n\nIn the middle of the 20th century, the idea of aesthetics was deployed in scientific contexts. [[Charles E. Osgood]] developed his [[semantic differential]] method in which he quantified the peoples' perceptions of artefacts. Some years later, in 1960, Professors Shigeru Mizuno and [[Yoji Akao]] developed an engineering approach in order to connect peoples' needs to product properties. This method was called [[quality function deployment]] (QFD). Another method, the [[Kano model]], was developed in the field of quality in the early 1980s by Professor [[Noriaki Kano]], of Tokyo University. Kano's model is used to establish the importance of individual product features for the customer's satisfaction and hence it creates the optimal requirement for process oriented product development activities. A pure marketing technique is [[Conjoint analysis (marketing)|conjoint analysis]]. Conjoint analysis estimates the relative importance of a product's attributes by analysing the consumer's overall judgment of a product or service. A more artistic method is called Semantic description of environments. It is mainly a tool for examining how a single person or a group of persons experience a certain (architectural) environment.\n\nAlthough all of these methods are concerned with subjective impact, none of them can translate this impact to design parameters sufficiently. This can, however, be accomplished by Kansei engineering. Kansei engineering (KE) has been used as a tool for affective engineering. It was developed in the early 70s in Japan and is now widely spread among Japanese companies. In the middle of the 90s, the method spread to the United States, but cultural differences may have prevented the method to enfold its whole potential.\n\n==Procedure ==\n\nAs mentioned above, Kansei engineering can be considered as a methodology within the research field of 'affective engineering'. Some researchers have identified the content of the methodology. Shimizu et al. state that 'Kansei Engineering is used as a tool for product development and the basic principles behind it are the following: identification of product properties and correlation between those properties and the design characteristics'.\n\nAccording to Nagasawa, one of the forerunners of Kansei engineering, there are three focal points in the method:\n# How to accurately understand consumer Kansei\n# How to reflect and translate Kansei understanding into product design\n# How to create a system and organization for Kansei orientated design\n\n== A model on methodology ==\n\nIn Japanese publications{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}, different types of Kansei engineering are identified and applied in various contexts. Sch\u00fctte examined different types of Kansei engineering and developed a general model covering the contents of Kansei engineering.\n\n; Choice of Domain\n''Domain'' in this context describes the overall idea behind an assembly of products, i.e. the product type in general. Choosing the domain includes the definition of the intended target group and user type, market-niche and type, and the product group in question. Choosing and defining the domain are carried out on existing products, concepts and on design solutions yet unknown. From this, a domain description is formulated, serving as the basis for further evaluation. The process is necessary and has been described by Sch\u00fctte in detail in a couple of publications.\n\n; Span the Semantic Space\nThe expression ''Semantic Space'' was addressed for the first time by Osgood et al.. He posed that every artifact can be described in a certain vector space defined by semantic expressions (words). This is done by collecting a large number of words that describe the domain. Suitable sources are pertinent literature, commercials, manuals, specification list, experts etc. The number of the words gathered varies according to the product, typically between 100 and 1000 words. In a second step the words are grouped using manual (e.g. Affinity diagram, compare: Bergman and Klefsj\u00f6, 1994) or mathematical methods (e.g. factor and/or cluster analysis, compare: Ishihara et al., 1998). Finally a few representing words are selected from this spanning the Semantic Space. These words are called \"Kansei words\" or \"Kansei Engineering words\".\n\n; Span the Space of Properties\nThe next step is to span the Space of Product Properties, which is similar to the Semantic Space. The Space of Product Properties collects products representing the domain, identifies key features and selects product properties for further evaluation.\nThe collection of products representing the domain is done from different sources such as existing products, customer suggestions, possible technical solutions and design concepts etc. The key features are found using specification lists for the products in question. To select properties for further evaluation, a Pareto-diagram (compare Bergman and Klefsj\u00f6, 1994) can assist the decision between important and less important features.\nSynthesis\nIn the synthesis step, the Semantic Space and the Space of Properties are linked together, as displayed in Figure 3. Compared to other methods in Affective Engineering, Kansei engineering is the only method that can establish and quantify connections between abstract feelings and technical specifications. For every Kansei word a number of product properties are found, affecting the Kansei word.\n\n; Synthesis\nThe research into constructing these links has been a core part of Nagamachi's work with Kansei engineering in the last few years. Nowadays, a number of different tools is available. Some of the most common tools are :\n\n* Category Identification\n* Regression Analysis /Quantification Theory Type I\n* Rough Sets Theory\n* Genetic Algorithm\n* Fuzzy Sets Theory\n\n; Model building and Test of Validity\nAfter doing the necessary stages, the final step of validation remains. This is done in order to check if the prediction model is reliable and realistic. However, in case of prediction model failure, it is necessary to update the Space of Properties and the Semantic Space, and consequently refine the model.\nThe process of refinement is difficult due to the shortage of methods. This shows the need of new tools to be integrated. The existing tools can partially be found in the previously mentioned methods for the synthesis.\n\n==Software tools==\nKansei engineering has always been a statically and mathematically advanced methodology. Most types require good expert knowledge and a reasonable amount of experience to carry out the studies sufficiently. This has also been the major obstacle for a widespread application of Kansei engineering.\nIn order to facilitate application some software packages have been developed in the recent years, most of them in Japan. There are two different types of software packages available: User consoles and data collection and analysis tools. User consoles are software programs that calculate and propose a product design based on the users' subjective preferences (Kanseis). However, such software requires a database that quantifies the connections between Kanseis and the combination of product attributes. For building such databases, data collection and analysis tools can be used. This part of the paper demonstrates some of the tools. There are many more tools used in companies and universities, which might not be available to the public.\nUser consoles\n\n== Software ==\n\nAs described above, Kansei data collection and analysis is often complex and connected with statistical analysis. Depending on which synthesis method is used, different computer software is used. Kansei Engineering Software (KESo) uses QT1 for linear analysis. The concept of Kansei Engineering Software (KESo) Link\u00f6ping University in Sweden. The software generates online questionnaires for collection of Kansei raw-data\n\nAnother software package (Kn6) was developed at the [[Polytechnic University of Valencia]] in Spain.\n\nBoth software packages improve the collection and evaluation of Kansei data. In this way even users with no specialist competence in advanced statistics can use Kansei engineering.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Affective computing]]\n*[[Gandhian engineering]] \u2013 for low cost, frugal, large distribution product design.\n*[[Fahrvergn\u00fcgen]]\n*[[Japanese quality]]\n\n== References ==\n* Akao, Y., History of Quality Function Deployment in Japan.

J. Taylor in 1935 showed that boron-10 nuclei had a propensity to capture thermal neutrons. This results in nuclear fission of the boron-11 nuclei into stripped down helium-4 nuclei (alpha particles) and lithium-7 ions. In 1936, G.L. Locher, a scientist at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, recognized the therapeutic potential of this discovery and suggested that neutron capture could be used to treat cancer. W. H. Sweet, from Massachusetts General Hospital, first suggested the technique for treating malignant brain tumors and a trial of BNCT against the most malignant of all brain tumors, glioblastoma multiforme, using borax as the boron delivery agent in 1951.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|year=1951|title=The uses of nuclear disintegration in the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumor|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=245|issue=23|pages=875\u20138|doi=10.1056/NEJM195112062452301|pmid=14882442|last1=Sweet|first1=W.H.}}</ref> A clinical trial was initiated in a collaboration with Brookhaven National Laboratory<ref name=\"Farr\"/> in Long Island, New York, U.S.A. and the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston in 1954.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nA number of research groups throughout the world have continued the early groundbreaking work of William Sweet and Ralph Fairchild, and in particular, the pioneering clinical studies of Hiroshi Hatanaka (\u7560\u4e2d\u6d0b). Clinical trials have been conducted in a number of countries including Japan, the United States, Sweden, Finland, Czech Republic, Argentina, and the European Union. The program in Japan transitioned from a reactor neutron source to accelerators.\n\n==Basic principles==\nNeutron capture therapy is a binary system that consists of two separate components to achieve its therapeutic effect. Each component in itself is non-tumoricidal, but when combined they can be highly lethal to cancer cells.

This undergoes instantaneous nuclear fission to produce high-energy [[alpha particle]]s (<sup>4</sup>He nuclei) and high-energy [[lithium|lithium-7]] (<sup>7</sup>Li) nuclei. The nuclear reaction is:\n:<sup>10</sup>B + n<sub>th</sub> \u2192 [<sup>11</sup>B] *\u2192 \u03b1 + <sup>7</sup>Li + 2.31 [[MeV]]\n\nBoth the alpha particles and the lithium nuclei produce closely spaced ionizations in the immediate vicinity of the reaction, with a range of 5\u20139&nbsp;[[\u00b5m]], which is approximately the diameter of the target cell. The lethality of the capture reaction is limited to boron containing cells. BNCT, therefore, can be regarded as both a biologically and a physically targeted type of radiation therapy. The success of BNCT is dependent upon the selective delivery of sufficient amounts of <sup>10</sup>B to the tumor with only small amounts localized in the surrounding normal tissues.<ref name=\"Boron Neutron\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0035 |title=Boron neutron capture therapy of cancer: Current status and future prospects |year=2005 |last1=Barth |first1=R.F. |journal=Clinical Cancer Research |volume=11 |issue=11 |pages=3987\u20134002 |pmid=15930333 |last2=Coderre |first2=J.A. |last3=Vicente |first3=M.G.H. |last4=Blue |first4=T.E.}}</ref> Thus, normal tissues, if they have not taken up sufficient amounts of boron-10, can be spared from the nuclear capture and fission reactions.

This was based on experimental animal studies in glioma bearing rats demonstrating enhanced uptake of BPA by infiltrating tumor cells following a 6-hour infusion.<ref name=\"Barth 2015\"/><ref name=\"Henriksson\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.radonc.2006.04.015 |title=Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) for glioblastoma multiforme: A phase II study evaluating a prolonged high-dose of boronophenylalanine (BPA) |year=2008 |last1=Henriksson |first1=R. |last2=Capala |first2=J. |last3=Michanek |first3=A. |last4=Lindahl |first4=S.-\u00c5. |last5=Salford |first5=L.G. |last6=Franz\u00e9n |first6=L. |last7=Blomquist |first7=E. |last8=Westlin |first8=J.-E. |last9=Bergenheim |first9=A.T. |journal=Radiotherapy and Oncology |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=183\u201391 |pmid=18336940|display-authors=8 |author10=Swedish Brain Tumour Study Group}}</ref><ref name=\"Skold\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1259/bjr/56953620 |title=Boron neutron capture therapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme: An assessment of clinical potential |year=2010 |last1=Sk\u00f6ld |first1=K. |last2=Gorlia |first2=T. |last3=Pellettieri |first3=L. |last4=Giusti |first4=V. |last5=H-Stenstam |first5=B. |last6=Hopewell |first6=J.W. |journal=British Journal of Radiology |volume=83 |issue=991 |pages=596\u2013603 |pmid=20603410 |pmc=3473677}}</ref><ref name=\"Smith et al 2001\">{{cite journal |title=Quantitative imaging and microlocalization of boron-10 in brain tumors and infiltrating tumor cells by SIMS ion microscopy: Relevance to neutron capture therapy |url=https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/61/22/8179.full.pdf |date=15 November 2001 |last1=Smith |first1=D.R. |last2=Chandra |first2=S. |last3=Barth |first3=R.F. |last4=Yang |first4=W. |last5=Joel |first5=D.D. |last6=Coderre |first6=J. |journal=Cancer Research |volume=61 |issue=22 |pages=8179\u20138187|pmid=11719448 }}</ref> The longer infusion time of the BPA was well tolerated by the 30 patients who were enrolled in this study.

A very heterogeneous group of patients with a variety of histopathologic types of tumors have been treated, the largest number of which had recurrent squamous cell carcinomas. Kato et al. have reported on a series of 26 patients with far-advanced cancer for whom there were no further treatment options.<ref name=\"Kato\"/> Either BPA + BSH or BPA alone were administered by a 1 or 2&nbsp;h i.v. infusion, and this was followed by BNCT using an epithermal beam. In this series, there were complete regressions in 12 cases, 10 partial regressions, and progression in 3 cases. The MST was 13.6 months, and the 6-year survival was 24%. Significant treatment related complications (\"adverse\" events) included transient mucositis, alopecia and, rarely, brain necrosis and osteomyelitis.\n\nKankaanranta et al. have reported their results in a prospective Phase I/II study of 30 patients with inoperable, locally recurrent squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck region.<ref name=\"Kanakaanranta Boron Neutron\"/> Patients received either two or, in a few instances, one BNCT treatment using BPA (400&nbsp;mg/kg), administered i.v. over 2 hours, followed by neutron irradiation. Of 29 evaluated patients, there were 13 complete and 9 partial remissions, with an overall response rate of 76%. The most common adverse event was oral mucositis, oral pain, and fatigue. Based on the clinical results, it was concluded that BNCT was effective for the treatment of inoperable, previously irradiated patients with head and neck cancer. Some responses were durable but progression was common, usually at the site of the previously recurrent tumor. As previously indicated in the section on neutron sources, all clinical studies have ended in Finland, based on a variety of reasons including economic difficulties of the two companies directly involved, VTT and Boneca. However, there are plans to resume clinical studies using an accelerator neutron source designed and fabricated by Neutron Therapeutics.

It is a two-step procedure: ''first'', the patient is injected with a tumor-localizing drug containing the [[stable isotope|non-radioactive isotope]] boron-10 (<sup>10</sup>B), which has a high propensity to [[neutron capture|capture]] thermal [[neutron]]s<ref>{{cite web|url=https://phoenixwi.com/blog/neutrons-medicine-phoenix-shine|title=The Roles of Radiation, Neutrons, and N-Ray in Medicine|website=Phoenix {{!}} High Flux Neutron Generators|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref>. The cross section of the <sup>10</sup>B (3,837 [[barn (unit)|barns]]) is many times greater than that of the other elements present in tissues such as hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. In the ''second'' step, the patient is radiated with [[epithermal neutron]]s, the source of which is either a nuclear reactor or an accelerator. After losing energy as they penetrate tissue, the neutrons are captured by the <sup>10</sup>B, which subsequently emits high-energy alpha particles that kill adjacent cells that have taken up sufficient quantities of <sup>10</sup>B. All of the clinical experience to date with NCT is with the non-radioactive isotope [[boron-10]], and this is known as '''boron neutron capture therapy''' ('''BNCT''').<ref name=\"Barth et al 2012\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1748-717X-7-146 |title=Current status of boron neutron capture therapy of high grade gliomas and recurrent head and neck cancer |year=2012 |last1=Barth |first1=R.F. |last2=Vicente |first2=M.G.H. |last3=Harling |first3=O.K. |last4=Kiger |first4=W.S. |last5=Riley |first5=K.J. |last6=Binns |first6=P.J. |last7=Wagner |first7=F.M. |last8=Suzuki |first8=M. |last9=Aihara |first9=T. |last10=Kato |first10=I. |last11=Kawabata |first11=S. |journal=Radiation Oncology |volume=7 |page=146 |pmid=22929110 |pmc=3583064}}</ref> The use of other non-radioactive isotopes, such as [[gadolinium]], has been limited to experimental studies and has not been used clinically.

J. Taylor in 1935 showed that boron-10 nuclei had a propensity to capture thermal neutrons. This results in nuclear fission of the boron-11 nuclei into stripped down helium-4 nuclei (alpha particles) and lithium-7 ions. In 1936, G.L. Locher, a scientist at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, recognized the therapeutic potential of this discovery and suggested that neutron capture could be used to treat cancer. W. H. Sweet, from Massachusetts General Hospital, first suggested the technique for treating malignant brain tumors and a trial of BNCT against the most malignant of all brain tumors, glioblastoma multiforme, using borax as the boron delivery agent in 1951.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|year=1951|title=The uses of nuclear disintegration in the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumor|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=245|issue=23|pages=875\u20138|doi=10.1056/NEJM195112062452301|pmid=14882442|last1=Sweet|first1=W.H.}}</ref> A clinical trial was initiated in a collaboration with Brookhaven National Laboratory<ref name=\"Farr\"/> in Long Island, New York, U.S.A. and the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston in 1954.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nA number of research groups throughout the world have continued the early groundbreaking work of William Sweet and Ralph Fairchild, and in particular, the pioneering clinical studies of Hiroshi Hatanaka (\u7560\u4e2d\u6d0b).

This undergoes instantaneous nuclear fission to produce high-energy [[alpha particle]]s (<sup>4</sup>He nuclei) and high-energy [[lithium|lithium-7]] (<sup>7</sup>Li) nuclei. The nuclear reaction is:\n:<sup>10</sup>B + n<sub>th</sub> \u2192 [<sup>11</sup>B] *\u2192 \u03b1 + <sup>7</sup>Li + 2.31 [[MeV]]\n\nBoth the alpha particles and the lithium nuclei produce closely spaced ionizations in the immediate vicinity of the reaction, with a range of 5\u20139&nbsp;[[\u00b5m]], which is approximately the diameter of the target cell. The lethality of the capture reaction is limited to boron containing cells. BNCT, therefore, can be regarded as both a biologically and a physically targeted type of radiation therapy. The success of BNCT is dependent upon the selective delivery of sufficient amounts of <sup>10</sup>B to the tumor with only small amounts localized in the surrounding normal tissues.<ref name=\"Boron Neutron\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0035 |title=Boron neutron capture therapy of cancer: Current status and future prospects |year=2005 |last1=Barth |first1=R.F. |journal=Clinical Cancer Research |volume=11 |issue=11 |pages=3987\u20134002 |pmid=15930333 |last2=Coderre |first2=J.A. |last3=Vicente |first3=M.G.H. |last4=Blue |first4=T.E.}}</ref> Thus, normal tissues, if they have not taken up sufficient amounts of boron-10, can be spared from the nuclear capture and fission reactions.

Included in the research team were Otto Harling at MIT and the Radiation Oncologist Paul Busse at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. A total of 22 patients were treated by the Harvard-MIT research group. Five patients with cutaneous melanomas were treated using an epithermal neutron beam at the MIT research reactor (MITR-II) and subsequently patients with brain tumors were treated using a redesigned beam at the MIT reactor which possessed far superior characteristics to the original MITR-II beam, and BPA as the capture agent.

A very heterogeneous group of patients with a variety of histopathologic types of tumors have been treated, the largest number of which had recurrent squamous cell carcinomas. Kato et al. have reported on a series of 26 patients with far-advanced cancer for whom there were no further treatment options.<ref name=\"Kato\"/> Either BPA + BSH or BPA alone were administered by a 1 or 2&nbsp;h i.v. infusion, and this was followed by BNCT using an epithermal beam. In this series, there were complete regressions in 12 cases, 10 partial regressions, and progression in 3 cases. The MST was 13.6 months, and the 6-year survival was 24%. Significant treatment related complications (\"adverse\" events) included transient mucositis, alopecia and, rarely, brain necrosis and osteomyelitis.\n\nKankaanranta et al. have reported their results in a prospective Phase I/II study of 30 patients with inoperable, locally recurrent squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck region.<ref name=\"Kanakaanranta Boron Neutron\"/> Patients received either two or, in a few instances, one BNCT treatment using BPA (400&nbsp;mg/kg), administered i.v. over 2 hours, followed by neutron irradiation. Of 29 evaluated patients, there were 13 complete and 9 partial remissions, with an overall response rate of 76%. The most common adverse event was oral mucositis, oral pain, and fatigue. Based on the clinical results, it was concluded that BNCT was effective for the treatment of inoperable, previously irradiated patients with head and neck cancer. Some responses were durable but progression was common, usually at the site of the previously recurrent tumor. As previously indicated in the section on neutron sources, all clinical studies have ended in Finland, based on a variety of reasons including economic difficulties of the two companies directly involved, VTT and Boneca. However, there are plans to resume clinical studies using an accelerator neutron source designed and fabricated by Neutron Therapeutics. Finally, a group in [[Taiwan]], led by Ling-Wei Wang and his co-workers at the Taipei Veterans General Hospital, have treated 17 patients with locally recurrent head and neck cancers at the Tsing Hua Open-pool Reactor (THOR) of the [[National Tsing Hua University]].<ref name=\"Wang1\">{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Ling-Wei |last2=Liu |first2=Yen-Wan Hsueh |last3=Chou |first3=Fong-In |last4=Jiang |first4=Shiang-Huei |title=Clinical trials for treating recurrent head and neck cancer with boron neutron capture therapy using the Tsing-Hua Open Pool Reactor |journal=Cancer Communications |date=2018 |volume=38 |issue=37 |pages=37 |doi=10.1186/s40880-018-0295-y|pmid=29914577 |pmc=6006853}}</ref> Two-year overall survival was 47% and two-year loco-regional control was 28%.
