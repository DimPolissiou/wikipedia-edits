Both the husbands are fed up with their respective marriages and are smitten by each other's wives, unbeknownst to each other. Manmohan Tiwari is a successful [[undergarment]] businessman, whose wife Angoori is a simple and naive housewife. Their neighbour, Vibhuti Narayan Mishra, used to be an unsuccessful insurance agent and is now unemployed. Often called as \"Nalla\" (a slang for being unemployed), he spends most of his time doing household chores. On the other hand, his wife Anita is a headstrong, smart and modern day lady who runs grooming classes. She is the breadwinner of the family and despises her husband's unemployment and sheer laziness.\n\nTheir houses are in opposite direction across the street, with the Tiwaris residing in House no. 6 and the Mishras living in House no. 9. The Tiwaris have their own house while the Mishras live in a rental house that belonged to Anita's uncle. Most of the plot takes place at their respective homes. The characters also visit a nearby tea stall 'Gupta Tea Center' where they mostly discuss their ongoing lives and general affairs.\n\nAs both the men devise schemes to impress each other's wives, they pull each other down and in-turn, create problematic situations for everybody else. Other recurring characters include Amma Ji (Manmohan Tiwari's strict mother), Ladoo (Manmohan Tiwari's little brother), Happu Singh (A corrupt Police Inspector), Anokhelal Saxena (A crazy man with genius level skills and a love for electric shocks), Teeka and Malkhan (two rowdy boys), Tillu (Tiwari's shop employee), Prem Choudhary (Vibhuti's rich but dubious friend), Gulfam Kali (Kanpur's best courtesan), David Mishra (Vibhuti's rich NRI uncle from UK), Pelu Chaurasia (Rickshaw puller of the locality), Resham Pal Singh (Kanpur's Commissioner) and many more.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n===Main=== \n* [[Aasif Sheikh]] as Vibhuti Ahuti Narayan Mishra (Vibhu), the unemployed husband of Anita Mishra. Often called 'Nalla' for being jobless, which has become a running gag on the show, he has fallen for the simple-minded Angoori Tiwari. He is known to be highly educated but still won't do a regular job out of his ego. His plans to woo Angoori but usually fails due to her naivety and this puts him in dire situations. He has a best friend Prem Chaudhary, with whom he hangs out and sometimes devices schemes to earn money through odd ways. He hates Manmohan Tiwari because he thinks Tiwari doesn't deserve a wife like Angoori who puts him above anything else. He has tried numerous times to degrade Tiwari's image in front of Angoori to negative results. Although he claims to be 'Chhapra University Topper', his Uncle David Mishra revealed that he bought the degree for him during his college. He has a talent of saying [[poetry]] and tries to tell Angoori that he loves her by saying poetry in [[Hindi language|Hindi]] and [[Urdu language|Urdu]]. \n* [[Rohitash Gaud]] as Manmohan Tiwari, a successful undergarments businessman, who is attracted to the modern and elegant Anita Mishra. He is called ''Kaccha-Baniyaan'' (crude words for undergarments) by Vibhuti because he thinks Tiwari's business is disgraceful. He is known to be petty and stingy yet a very cunning person. He always tries to manipulate situations in his favour, sometimes to impress Anita Mishra, with little to no success. He has a love-hate relationship with his overtly dominating mother and gets irritated whenever Angoori follows his mother's wishes blindly, even if it gets him in peril. He gets very defensive whenever Vibhuti asks him about his mother's connections to Pandit Ramphal or about his father who is said to have become a sage in the Himalayas.\n*[[Shilpa Shinde]] as Angoori Manmohan Tiwari ''(March 2015 \u2013 March 2016)'' \u2013 Shinde left the series after a dispute with the series' producer, Binaifer Kohli and former channel head Vikas Gupta.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shilpa Shinde quits Bhabhiji Ghar Par Hai, accuses makers of mentally torturing her.|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/television/shilpa-shinde-angoori-bhabhi-quits-bhabhiji-ghar-par-hai-makers-send-legal-notice/|publisher=The Indian Express|accessdate=10 June 2016|date=16 March 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Shubhangi Atre Poorey]] as Angoori Manmohan Tiwari \u2013 She is a traditional Indian housewife who likes to wear [[Lehenga-style saree|lehenga style saree]], [[sindoor]] and [[Mangala sutra|mangalasutra]] and has a Bhojpuri accent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjUJTG4FQzI|title=Day out with \"Angoori Bhabhi\" AKA \"Shubhangi Atre\"|publisher=Saas Bahu Aur Betiyaan on YouTube |date=|accessdate=|archiveurl=|archivedate=}}</ref> Being a simple, naive and loving woman who easily believes anybody and everybody, she is very kind-hearted and innocent by nature. She performs various superstitious rituals sometimes told to her by her loving mother-in-law which leads to hilarious outcomes. She cooks the most delicious food. She usually speaks English words incorrectly, leading to everybody around her correcting her vocabulary, which she follows by her now iconic line \"sahi pakde hai\" (you have caught it right as if you got the meaning right) to acknowledge that the person understood what she was trying to say.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.indiatoday.in/television/celebrity/story/9-lesser-known-facts-about-new-angoori-bhabhi-shubhangi-atre-322940-2016-05-11|title=8 lesser-known facts about new Angoori Bhabhi Shubhangi Atre|date=11 May 2016|publisher=India Today|accessdate=24 March 2019}}</ref> When she gets upset with Tiwari, she calls her mother-in-law known as Amma Ji. Sometimes, Angoori also insults Vibhuti in her own innocent ways. She has a good friendship with Anita.\n* [[Saumya Tandon]] as Anita Vibhuti Narayan Mishra (Anu), an elegant modern day lady who runs her grooming classes in Kanpur. She is a headstrong and smart lady. She is a [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in [[karate]]. Vibhuti's unemployment really irritates her which is why she dominates him over every issue. To fulfill her romantic fantasies, she constantly forces Vibhuti to perform various characters like a thief, a robber, a college stud, a painter, a dacoit, an electrician, a cop among many others which most of the times frustrates him. She frequently taunts Vibhuti by comparing him with Manmohan Tiwari, which he hates. Whenever she gets upset over Vibhuti's antics, she throws him out of the house. She has a good friendship with Angoori. Anita often reads a magazine named '' 'Meri Chant Saheli' '' (My Clever Friend (female)) published by Kalavati Sharma, who speaks for [[women's empowerment]] and tries various tips and tricks from the magazine to test Vibhuti's loyalty towards herself.\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Yogesh Tripathi]] as Daroga Happu Singh, a corrupt Daroga (police inspector) who has a secret crush on Anita whom he calls 'Gori Mem' (meaning \"Fair Ma'am\"). He demands bribes from everybody in exchange for favours from him (and calls them \"nyochhaavar\" which means sacrifices) much to the chagrin of the residents, to feed his \"nine kids\" and a \"pregnant wife\" although nobody believes him as he has been saying that for years now. He yearns for a promotion, but Police Commissioner Resham Pal always gets in his way. He is very short tempered and most of the time he is seen thrashing Tillu, Tika & Malkhan at the tea stall for their antics.\n* [[Saanand Verma]] as Anokhelal Saxena, more popularly known as Saxena Ji, a genius and talented but aptly crazy man with an obsession of electrocuting himself, getting tortured and eating almost anything that is poisonous or unhealthy, like lizard soup and cockroach tea. He usually expresses his joy of madness by saying his iconic \"I Like It!!\". Over the course of the show, he is shown to possess various talents like being a lawyer, an artist, an actor, a writer, a singer etc. It has never been clearly acknowledged on the show as to why he went mad in the first place. \n*[[Kishore Bhanushali]] as Resham Pal Singh, the Commissioner of Kanpur Police Department. He is known to be an honest and straightforward man who dislikes Happu Singh. He is a secret admirer of Gulfam Kali. Actor Kishore Bhanushali has been a lifelong impersonator of a late Indian film actor [[Dev Anand]] and he brings his characteristics to this role. He has also appeared as another character 'Sharma Uncle' in a 1-hour horror special episode previously before taking on this character later.\n*Vaibhav Mathur as Teeka Ram, a dim-wit unemployed guy, who always hangs out with Tillu and Malkhaan. He along with the other two share a rented place to live but have been kicked out of it several times by their landlord for flirting with his daughter.\n*Deepesh Bhan as Malkhan, an equally dim-witted guy like Teeka, always looking out to woo girls with bad results. He along with the other two are always seen trying to make easy money through odd jobs like kidnapping, selling stolen items, frauds etc. but are often caught and jailed. He is often seen in flirting sessions with girls which end with him and Teeka getting beaten by the girls or Daroga Happu Singh.\n*Syed Salim Zaidi as Tillu, Tiwari's shop employee who constantly plots against him so as to get back his 6 months unpaid salary. Although dim-witted, he is relatively more intelligent than Tika and Malkhan. He has taken severe measures to extort his salary out of his boss's pocket like robbing Tiwari's house, threat calls and kidnapping Tiwari's younger brother etc., but circumstances always turn against him and he is left empty-handed. \n*Soma Rathod as Ramkali Tiwari (Amma Ji), Tiwari's strict mother who constantly beats him for every mistake and loves her daughter-in-law, Angoori. It was revealed by Manmohan Tiwari that his father left her mother before his birth and that his birth was kept as a secret for some time due to certain unknown circumstances. Amma Ji is an avid follower of a famous astrologer and priest, Pundit Ramphal. He tells her various rituals which in turn Amma Ji makes Angoori perform to get health and wealth-related benefits. There are several hints given in the show that point at Pundit Ramphal being Manmohan Tiwari's actual biological father, but this has never been fully explored.\n*Falguni Rajani as Gulfam Kali, an infamous [[tawaif]] (courtesan) of Kanpur. Every male character has visited her place at some point in the show to admire her dance and beauty, except Saxena Ji who considers Gulfam Kali his sister. She is known to manipulate the men of the show because she knows secrets about every man that she knows and threatens to reveal them if they won't do her bidding. Although the women of the show do not like her presence, they do treat her with respect. \n*Vishwajeet Soni as Prem Chaudhary, Vibhuti's best friend who is a foul-mouthed cunning show-off, much to Vibhuti's ire and also an impersonator of Indian film actor [[Prem Chopra]]. He comes from a rich background and deals in several illegal activities like gambling, smuggling etc. Despite all this, he is always there to help Vibhuti in rough times and often hangs out with him. He is disliked by Anita because she fears that Vibhuti might become a criminal in his influence.\n*Akshay Patil as Pelu Chaurasia, the colony's mute rickshaw puller. He communicates by pulling out message slips out of his muffler tied around his head. He is known for being a rather smart person. He ends conversations through his signature 'wide awkward smile'. He also carries a portable radio, providing songs appropriate to often hilarious situations. \n*Anup Upadhyay as David Mishra, Vibhuti's UK based rich uncle who always visits him in awkward situations. He is known to be very rich although his business is unknown. Whenever he visits Vibhuti, he brings papers to his \u20b920 crore property, so he can name Vibhuti his heir. But, due to one reason or another, he and sometimes others too tear the papers apart to pieces. He often asks Pelu \"London mein taxi chalaega?\" (Would You Like To Drive Taxi in London?) whenever he comes to Kanpur as he likes his company. \n*Jeetu Gupta as Dr. Gupta, a doctor who is basically a \"tantrik\", as he always tells people. He performs black magic on his patients to cure them because his prescriptions never work.\n*[[Rakesh Bedi]] as Bhoorey Lal, Angoori's alcoholic but loving father, who hates Tiwari for marrying her by lying about his profession. He likes Vibhuti and sometimes when he's drunk, he mumbles about preferring him as his son-in-law if he would have found him sooner, much to the dismay of Tiwari.\n*Vijay Kumar Singh as Master Bhoop Singh. He is a Masterji ([[teacher]]) in Ladoo's school. Bhoop Singh is a believer of strict Indian moral values or \"Sanskar\" as he calls them. In the show, he is the caricature of old-fashioned teachers from rural India. He wears [[khadi]] jacket, carries an Indian style side-bag called \"Jhola\" and always has a long and thin bamboo stick called \"Santi\" to beat someone with if they misbehave. Whenever, he witnesses any improper behaviour in public, he always recites his catchphrase which is ''Sanskar naam ka cheez hai ki nahi?'' lit. (Do you have any moral values or not?).\n*Saurabh Kaushik as Panditji, he is disciple of pundit Ramphal.\n*Hardik Gohil as Laddoo Tiwari, who is the younger brother of Manmohan Tiwari and Ramkali's younger son. He favours his sister-in-law, Angoori more than his own brother and thinks of her as his second mother, as he would call her, 'Bhabhi Ma'. He is known to have a subtle-telepathic ability and could listen to thoughts about what others are thinking whenever they are around.\n*Anup Kumar Singh as Pundit Ramphal, the famous astrologer and priest whom Ammaji blindly follows and gets ideas from him for various superstitious rituals to get health and wealth-related benefits. He has also appeared as various other characters before and after, such as govt. officials such as CBI officer, IT officer and TTE Namepal Singh from Episodes 474 to 476. \n*Naveen Bawa as various characters, including businessman Bhushan Bhabhuta from Bhabhuta Builders in Episodes 276 to 278 and Anita's American cousin brother Mark Shutermurgh in Episodes 682 through 686. \n*[[Feroz (actor)|Feroz]] as Chhedi, a flirting [[Dhobi]] (washerman) of the locality.\n*[[Sohit Vijay Soni]] as News Anchor and also as Various Characters.\n*Rajeev Mehra as various characters including a Minister of [[Uttar Pradesh]] and also the new police commissioner.                  \n*Anu Awasthi as Anu Awasthi (Anu mama) Ramkali's brother, Manmohan Tiwari's uncle.\n* Manoj Santoshi (writer of ''Bhabiji Ghar Par Hain!'') appeared as Balushankar Khasoute in episodes 408-410 of 'Sangeet Hi Jeevan Hai' story arc where he tries to flirt with Angoori.

Both the husbands are fed up with their respective marriages and are smitten by each other's wives, unbeknownst to each other. Manmohan Tiwari is a successful [[undergarment]] businessman, whose wife Angoori is a simple and naive housewife. Their neighbour, Vibhuti Narayan Mishra, used to be an unsuccessful insurance agent and is now unemployed. Often called as \"Nalla\" (a slang for being unemployed), he spends most of his time doing household chores. On the other hand, his wife Anita is a headstrong, smart and modern day lady who runs grooming classes. She is the breadwinner of the family and despises her husband's unemployment and sheer laziness.\n\nTheir houses are in opposite direction across the street, with the Tiwaris residing in House no. 6 and the Mishras living in House no. 9. The Tiwaris have their own house while the Mishras live in a rental house that belonged to Anita's uncle. Most of the plot takes place at their respective homes. The characters also visit a nearby tea stall 'Gupta Tea Center' where they mostly discuss their ongoing lives and general affairs.\n\nAs both the men devise schemes to impress each other's wives, they pull each other down and in-turn, create problematic situations for everybody else. Other recurring characters include Amma Ji (Manmohan Tiwari's strict mother), Ladoo (Manmohan Tiwari's little brother), Happu Singh (A corrupt Police Inspector), Anokhelal Saxena (A crazy man with genius level skills and a love for electric shocks), Teeka and Malkhan (two rowdy boys), Tillu (Tiwari's shop employee), Prem Choudhary (Vibhuti's rich but dubious friend), Gulfam Kali (Kanpur's best courtesan), David Mishra (Vibhuti's rich NRI uncle from UK), Pelu Chaurasia (Rickshaw puller of the locality), Resham Pal Singh (Kanpur's Commissioner) and many more.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n===Main=== \n* [[Aasif Sheikh]] as Vibhuti Ahuti Narayan Mishra (Vibhu), the unemployed husband of Anita Mishra. Often called 'Nalla' for being jobless, which has become a running gag on the show, he has fallen for the simple-minded Angoori Tiwari. He is known to be highly educated but still won't do a regular job out of his ego. His plans to woo Angoori but usually fails due to her naivety and this puts him in dire situations. He has a best friend Prem Chaudhary, with whom he hangs out and sometimes devices schemes to earn money through odd ways. He hates Manmohan Tiwari because he thinks Tiwari doesn't deserve a wife like Angoori who puts him above anything else. He has tried numerous times to degrade Tiwari's image in front of Angoori to negative results. Although he claims to be 'Chhapra University Topper', his Uncle David Mishra revealed that he bought the degree for him during his college. He has a talent of saying [[poetry]] and tries to tell Angoori that he loves her by saying poetry in [[Hindi language|Hindi]] and [[Urdu language|Urdu]]. \n* [[Rohitash Gaud]] as Manmohan Tiwari, a successful undergarments businessman, who is attracted to the modern and elegant Anita Mishra. He is called ''Kaccha-Baniyaan'' (crude words for undergarments) by Vibhuti because he thinks Tiwari's business is disgraceful. He is known to be petty and stingy yet a very cunning person. He always tries to manipulate situations in his favour, sometimes to impress Anita Mishra, with little to no success. He has a love-hate relationship with his overtly dominating mother and gets irritated whenever Angoori follows his mother's wishes blindly, even if it gets him in peril. He gets very defensive whenever Vibhuti asks him about his mother's connections to Pandit Ramphal or about his father who is said to have become a sage in the Himalayas.\n*[[Shilpa Shinde]] as Angoori Manmohan Tiwari ''(March 2015 \u2013 March 2016)'' \u2013 Shinde left the series after a dispute with the series' producer, Binaifer Kohli and former channel head Vikas Gupta.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shilpa Shinde quits Bhabhiji Ghar Par Hai, accuses makers of mentally torturing her.|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/television/shilpa-shinde-angoori-bhabhi-quits-bhabhiji-ghar-par-hai-makers-send-legal-notice/|publisher=The Indian Express|accessdate=10 June 2016|date=16 March 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Shubhangi Atre Poorey]] as Angoori Manmohan Tiwari \u2013 She is a traditional Indian housewife who likes to wear [[Lehenga-style saree|lehenga style saree]], [[sindoor]] and [[Mangala sutra|mangalasutra]] and has a Bhojpuri accent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjUJTG4FQzI|title=Day out with \"Angoori Bhabhi\" AKA \"Shubhangi Atre\"|publisher=Saas Bahu Aur Betiyaan on YouTube |date=|accessdate=|archiveurl=|archivedate=}}</ref> Being a simple, naive and loving woman who easily believes anybody and everybody, she is very kind-hearted and innocent by nature. She performs various superstitious rituals sometimes told to her by her loving mother-in-law which leads to hilarious outcomes. She cooks the most delicious food. She usually speaks English words incorrectly, leading to everybody around her correcting her vocabulary, which she follows by her now iconic line \"sahi pakde hai\" (you have caught it right as if you got the meaning right) to acknowledge that the person understood what she was trying to say.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.indiatoday.in/television/celebrity/story/9-lesser-known-facts-about-new-angoori-bhabhi-shubhangi-atre-322940-2016-05-11|title=8 lesser-known facts about new Angoori Bhabhi Shubhangi Atre|date=11 May 2016|publisher=India Today|accessdate=24 March 2019}}</ref> When she gets upset with Tiwari, she calls her mother-in-law known as Amma Ji. Sometimes, Angoori also insults Vibhuti in her own innocent ways. She has a good friendship with Anita.\n* [[Saumya Tandon]] as Anita Vibhuti Narayan Mishra (Anu), an elegant modern day lady who runs her grooming classes in Kanpur. She is a headstrong and smart lady. She is a [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in [[karate]]. Vibhuti's unemployment really irritates her which is why she dominates him over every issue. To fulfill her romantic fantasies, she constantly forces Vibhuti to perform various characters like a thief, a robber, a college stud, a painter, a dacoit, an electrician, a cop among many others which most of the times frustrates him. She frequently taunts Vibhuti by comparing him with Manmohan Tiwari, which he hates. Whenever she gets upset over Vibhuti's antics, she throws him out of the house. She has a good friendship with Angoori. Anita often reads a magazine named '' 'Meri Chant Saheli' '' (My Clever Friend (female)) published by Kalavati Sharma, who speaks for [[women's empowerment]] and tries various tips and tricks from the magazine to test Vibhuti's loyalty towards herself.\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Yogesh Tripathi]] as Daroga Happu Singh, a corrupt Daroga (police inspector) who has a secret crush on Anita whom he calls 'Gori Mem' (meaning \"Fair Ma'am\"). He demands bribes from everybody in exchange for favours from him (and calls them \"nyochhaavar\" which means sacrifices) much to the chagrin of the residents, to feed his \"nine kids\" and a \"pregnant wife\" although nobody believes him as he has been saying that for years now. He yearns for a promotion, but Police Commissioner Resham Pal always gets in his way. He is very short tempered and most of the time he is seen thrashing Tillu, Tika & Malkhan at the tea stall for their antics.\n* [[Saanand Verma]] as Anokhelal Saxena, more popularly known as Saxena Ji, a genius and talented but aptly crazy man with an obsession of electrocuting himself, getting tortured and eating almost anything that is poisonous or unhealthy, like lizard soup and cockroach tea. He usually expresses his joy of madness by saying his iconic \"I Like It!!\". Over the course of the show, he is shown to possess various talents like being a lawyer, an artist, an actor, a writer, a singer etc. It has never been clearly acknowledged on the show as to why he went mad in the first place. \n*[[Kishore Bhanushali]] as Resham Pal Singh, the Commissioner of Kanpur Police Department. He is known to be an honest and straightforward man who dislikes Happu Singh. He is a secret admirer of Gulfam Kali. Actor Kishore Bhanushali has been a lifelong impersonator of a late Indian film actor [[Dev Anand]] and he brings his characteristics to this role. He has also appeared as another character 'Sharma Uncle' in a 1-hour horror special episode previously before taking on this character later.\n*Vaibhav Mathur as Teeka Ram, a dim-wit unemployed guy, who always hangs out with Tillu and Malkhaan. He along with the other two share a rented place to live but have been kicked out of it several times by their landlord for flirting with his daughter.\n*Deepesh Bhan as Malkhan, an equally dim-witted guy like Teeka, always looking out to woo girls with bad results. He along with the other two are always seen trying to make easy money through odd jobs like kidnapping, selling stolen items, frauds etc. but are often caught and jailed. He is often seen in flirting sessions with girls which end with him and Teeka getting beaten by the girls or Daroga Happu Singh.\n*Syed Salim Zaidi as Tillu, Tiwari's shop employee who constantly plots against him so as to get back his 6 months unpaid salary. Although dim-witted, he is relatively more intelligent than Tika and Malkhan. He has taken severe measures to extort his salary out of his boss's pocket like robbing Tiwari's house, threat calls and kidnapping Tiwari's younger brother etc., but circumstances always turn against him and he is left empty-handed. \n*Soma Rathod as Ramkali Tiwari (Amma Ji), Tiwari's strict mother who constantly beats him for every mistake and loves her daughter-in-law, Angoori. It was revealed by Manmohan Tiwari that his father left her mother before his birth and that his birth was kept as a secret for some time due to certain unknown circumstances. Amma Ji is an avid follower of a famous astrologer and priest, Pundit Ramphal. He tells her various rituals which in turn Amma Ji makes Angoori perform to get health and wealth-related benefits. There are several hints given in the show that point at Pundit Ramphal being Manmohan Tiwari's actual biological father, but this has never been fully explored.\n*Falguni Rajani as Gulfam Kali, an infamous [[tawaif]] (courtesan) of Kanpur. Every male character has visited her place at some point in the show to admire her dance and beauty, except Saxena Ji who considers Gulfam Kali his sister. She is known to manipulate the men of the show because she knows secrets about every man that she knows and threatens to reveal them if they won't do her bidding. Although the women of the show do not like her presence, they do treat her with respect. \n*Vishwajeet Soni as Prem Chaudhary, Vibhuti's best friend who is a foul-mouthed cunning show-off, much to Vibhuti's ire and also an impersonator of Indian film actor [[Prem Chopra]]. He comes from a rich background and deals in several illegal activities like gambling, smuggling etc. Despite all this, he is always there to help Vibhuti in rough times and often hangs out with him. He is disliked by Anita because she fears that Vibhuti might become a criminal in his influence.\n*Akshay Patil as Pelu Chaurasia, the colony's mute rickshaw puller. He communicates by pulling out message slips out of his muffler tied around his head. He is known for being a rather smart person. He ends conversations through his signature 'wide awkward smile'. He also carries a portable radio, providing songs appropriate to often hilarious situations. \n*Anup Upadhyay as David Mishra, Vibhuti's UK based rich uncle who always visits him in awkward situations. He is known to be very rich although his business is unknown. Whenever he visits Vibhuti, he brings papers to his \u20b920 crore property, so he can name Vibhuti his heir. But, due to one reason or another, he and sometimes others too tear the papers apart to pieces. He often asks Pelu \"London mein taxi chalaega?\" (Would You Like To Drive Taxi in London?) whenever he comes to Kanpur as he likes his company. \n*Jeetu Gupta as Dr. Gupta, a doctor who is basically a \"tantrik\", as he always tells people. He performs black magic on his patients to cure them because his prescriptions never work.\n*[[Rakesh Bedi]] as Bhoorey Lal, Angoori's alcoholic but loving father, who hates Tiwari for marrying her by lying about his profession. He likes Vibhuti and sometimes when he's drunk, he mumbles about preferring him as his son-in-law if he would have found him sooner, much to the dismay of Tiwari.\n*Vijay Kumar Singh as Master Bhoop Singh. He is a Masterji ([[teacher]]) in Ladoo's school. Bhoop Singh is a believer of strict Indian moral values or \"Sanskar\" as he calls them. In the show, he is the caricature of old-fashioned teachers from rural India. He wears [[khadi]] jacket, carries an Indian style side-bag called \"Jhola\" and always has a long and thin bamboo stick called \"Santi\" to beat someone with if they misbehave. Whenever, he witnesses any improper behaviour in public, he always recites his catchphrase which is ''Sanskar naam ka cheez hai ki nahi?'' lit. (Do you have any moral values or not?).\n*Saurabh Kaushik as Panditji, he is disciple of pundit Ramphal.\n*Hardik Gohil as Laddoo Tiwari, who is the younger brother of Manmohan Tiwari and Ramkali's younger son. He favours his sister-in-law, Angoori more than his own brother and thinks of her as his second mother, as he would call her, 'Bhabhi Ma'. He is known to have a subtle-telepathic ability and could listen to thoughts about what others are thinking whenever they are around.\n*Anup Kumar Singh as Pundit Ramphal, the famous astrologer and priest whom Ammaji blindly follows and gets ideas from him for various superstitious rituals to get health and wealth-related benefits. He has also appeared as various other characters before and after, such as govt. officials such as CBI officer, IT officer and TTE Namepal Singh from Episodes 474 to 476. \n*Naveen Bawa as various characters, including businessman Bhushan Bhabhuta from Bhabhuta Builders in Episodes 276 to 278 and Anita's American cousin brother Mark Shutermurgh in Episodes 682 through 686. \n*[[Feroz (actor)|Feroz]] as Chhedi, a flirting [[Dhobi]] (washerman) of the locality.\n*[[Sohit Vijay Soni]] as News Anchor and also as Various Characters.\n*Rajeev Mehra as various characters including a Minister of [[Uttar Pradesh]] and also the new police commissioner.                  \n*Anu Awasthi as Anu Awasthi (Anu mama) Ramkali's brother, Manmohan Tiwari's uncle.\n* Manoj Santoshi (writer of ''Bhabiji Ghar Par Hain!'') appeared as Balushankar Khasoute in episodes 408-410 of 'Sangeet Hi Jeevan Hai' story arc where he tries to flirt with Angoori.

The reign of Jayanegara was a difficult and chaotic one, troubled with several rebellions by his father's former companions in arms. Among others are Gajah Biru's rebellion in 1314 and the Kuti rebellion in 1319. The Kuti rebellion was the most dangerous one, as Kuti managed to take control of the capital city.

One of his distasteful acts was his desire to take his own half sisters, Gitarja and Rajadewi, as wives. Since Javanese tradition abhorred the practice of half siblings marrying, the council of royal elders spoke strongly against the king's wishes. It was not clear what motivated Jayanegara's wish \u2013 it might have been his way to ensure his claim to the throne by preventing rivals from being his half sisters' suitors, although in the later period of the Majapahit court the custom of marriage among cousins was quite common. In the ''[[Pararaton]]'', he was known as ''Kala Gemet'', or \"weak villain\". About the time of Jayanegara's reign, the Italian Friar [[Odoric of Pordenone]] visited the Majapahit court in Java.\n\nIn 1328, Jayanegara was murdered by his physician, Tanca, during a surgical operation. In complete mayhem and rage, Gajah Mada immediately killed Tanca. The motive behind this [[regicide]] was never clear. According to the ''Pararaton'', it was Tanca's revenge for the king sexually abusing his wife.

After seven months of battles, Majapahit forces defeated the Balinese king and captured the Balinese capital of Bedulu in 1343. After the conquest of Bali, Majapahit distributed the governing authority of Bali among Arya Damar's younger brothers, Arya Kenceng, Arya Kutawandira, Arya Sentong, and Arya Belog. Arya Kenceng led his brothers to govern Bali under Majapahit suzerainty, and he would become the progenitor of the Balinese kings of the Tabanan and Badung royal houses. Through this campaign, Majapahit planted a vassal dynasty that would rule the [[Bali Kingdom]] in the following centuries. Tribhuwana ruled Majapahit until the death of her mother in 1350.

These Chinese voyages visited numbers of ports in Asia as far as [[Africa]], including Majapahit ports. It was said that Zheng He has paid a visit to the Majapahit court in Java.\n\nThese massive Chinese voyages were not merely a naval exploration, but also a show of power and a display of geopolitical reach. The Chinese Ming dynasty had recently overthrown the Mongols Yuan dynasty, and were eager to establish their hegemony in the world, which changed the geopolitical balance in Asia.<ref name=\"TOI-Sanyal\">{{cite news | title = History of Indian Ocean shows how old rivalries can trigger rise of new forces | work = Times of India | date = 6 August 2016 | author = Sanjeev Sanyal | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/sunday-times/all-that-matters/History-of-Indian-Ocean-shows-how-old-rivalries-can-trigger-rise-of-new-forces/articleshow/53577849.cms}}</ref> Chinese intervened in the politics of the southern seas by supporting Thais against the declining Khmer Empire, support and installing allied factions in [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]] and other places in [[Indian Ocean]] coasts. However, perhaps the most significant Chinese intervention was its support for the newly established [[Sultanate of Malacca]], as a rival and counter-weight to the Majapahit influence of Java.<ref name=\"TOI-Sanyal\" /> \n\nPreviously, Majapahit has succeeded to assert its influence in Malacca strait by containing the aspiration of Malay polities in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula to ever reach the geopolitical might like those of Srivijaya. The Hindu Majapahit were the most powerful maritime power in Southeast Asian seas that time and were opposed to Chinese expansion into their sphere of influence. The Ming's support for Malacca, and the spread of Islam propagated by both Malacca and Zheng He's treasure fleet has weakened Majapahit maritime influence in Sumatra, which caused the northern part of the island to increasingly converting to Islam and gained independence from Majapahit, leaving [[Indragiri]], [[Jambi]] and [[Palembang]], remnants of the old [[Srivijaya]], the only suzerainty under Majapahit in Sumatra,{{efn | group=lower-roman | According to the History of Ming, only these areas in Sumatra were still mentioned as under Javanese / Majapahit supremacy at the time. Read <ref name=\"notes on the malay archipelago\" />}} bordering [[Pagaruyung Kingdom]] on the west and independent Muslim kingdoms on the north.\n\nThis Ming dynasty voyages is extremely important for Majapahit historiography, since Zheng He's translator [[Ma Huan]] wrote ''[[Yingya Shenglan]]'', a detailed description of Majapahit,<ref name=\"yingyai\" /> which provides a valuable insight on the culture, customs, also various social and economic aspects of Java during Majapahit period.<ref name=\"Chao-Wa\" />\n\nThe Chinese provided systematic support to Malacca, and its sultan made at least one trip to personally pay obeisance to the Ming emperor. Malacca actively encouraged the conversion to [[Islam]] in the region, while Ming fleet actively established Chinese-Malay Muslim community in coastal northern Java, thus created a permanent opposition to the Hindus of Java. By 1430, the expeditions had established Muslim Chinese, Arab and Malay communities in northern ports of Java such as [[Semarang]], [[Demak, Indonesia|Demak]], [[Tuban]], and [[Surabaya|Ampel]]; thus Islam began to gain a foothold on the northern coast of Java. Malacca prospered under Chinese Ming protection, while the Majapahit were steadily pushed back.<ref name=\"TOI-Sanyal\" />\n\n====Queen Suhita====\n[[File:Suhita.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The mortuary deified portrait statue of Queen [[Suhita]] (reign 1429-1447), discovered at Jebuk, Kalangbret, Tulungagung, East Java, [[National Museum of Indonesia]].]]\nWikramawardhana ruled until 1426 and was succeeded by his daughter [[Suhita]],<ref name=\"Coedes\" />{{rp|242}} who ruled from 1426 to 1447.

The reign of Suhita was the second time Majapahit was reigned by a queen regnant after her great grandmother Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi. Her reign is immortalized in Javanese legend of [[Damarwulan]], as it involves a maiden queen named Prabu Kenya in the story, and during Suhita's reign there was a war with [[Blambangan]] as stated in the legend.<ref>Claire Holt. ''Art in Indonesia: Continuities and Change''.

After Kertawijaya died, [[Bhre Pamotan]] became a king with formal name Rajasawardhana. He died in 1453. A three-year kingless period was possibly the result of a succession crisis. [[Girisawardhana]], son of Kertawijaya, came to power in 1456. He died in 1466 and was succeeded by Singhawikramawardhana.\n\n====The divide====\nIn 1468 Prince Kertabhumi rebelled against Singhawikramawardhana, promoting himself as the king of Majapahit. Deposed Singhawikramawardhana retreated upstream of Brantas River, moved the kingdom's capital further inland to [[Kediri (city)|Daha]] (the former capital of [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri kingdom]]), effectively splitting Majapahit, under Bhre Kertabumi in Trowulan and Singhawikramawardhana in Daha. Singhawikramawardhana continued his rule until he was succeeded by his son [[Girindrawardhana]] (Ranawijaya) in 1474.\n\nAnd in between this period of the dividing court of Majapahit, the kingdom found itself unable to control its western part of the already crumbling empire. The rising power of the [[Sultanate of Malacca]] began to gain effective control of [[Strait of Malacca|Malacca Strait]] in the mid-15th century and expanding its influence to Sumatra. And amidst these events, Indragiri and Siantan, according to [[Malay Annals]] were given to Malacca as a dowry for the marriage of a Majapahit princess and the [[Mansur Shah of Malacca|sultan of Malacca]].<ref name=\"Leyden\">Leyden, John (1821)[https://books.google.co.id/books?id=J9JAAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false Malay Annals (translated from the Malay language)], Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme and Brown.</ref>, further weakening Majapahit's influence on the western part of the archipelago. Kertabhumi managed to stabilized this situation by allying with Muslim merchants, giving them trading rights on the north coast of Java, with [[Demak Regency|Demak]] as its centre and in return asked for their loyalty to Majapahit. This policy boosted the Majapahit treasury and power, but weakened Hindu-Buddhism as its main religion because [[Dawah|Islamic proselytizing]] spread faster, especially in Javanese coastal principalities. Hindu-Buddhist followers' grievances later paved the way for Ranawijaya to defeat Kertabumi.\n\n[[Image:Muzium Negara KL38.JPG|thumb|right|The model of a Majapahit ship display in [[Muzium Negara]], [[Kuala Lumpur]].

This event led to the war between the [[Sultanate of Demak]] and [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Daha]], since Demak rulers were descendants of Kertabhumi.\n\nDuring this period of Majapahit's retreat to the inland [[Kediri|Daha]] and war in Java, [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]], being the dominant ruler of the Javanese coastal lands and Java as a whole, seized the region of Jambi and Palembang in Sumatra from Majapahit.<ref name=\":3\" />{{rp|154\u2013155}}\n\n====Demak invasion and the fall of Majapahit====\n[[File:Masjid Agung Demak.jpg|thumb|left|[[Demak Sultanate|Demak]] was the earliest Islamic polity in Java that replaced Majapahit.]]\nIn 1498, there was a turning point when Girindrawardhana was deposed by his vice regent, Udara. After this coup, the war between Demak and Daha receded, with some sources saying [[Raden Patah]], Sultan of Demak, left Majapahit alone as his father had done before, while others said Udara agreed to become a vassal of Demak, even marrying Raden Patah's youngest daughter.\n\nMeanwhile in the west, [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|Malacca was captured by Portuguese in 1511]].

The refugees fled to the east to avoid Demak retribution for their support for Ranawijaya against Kertabhumi. \n\nDemak came under the leadership of Raden (later crowned as Sultan) Patah (Arabic name: Fatah, lit. \"liberator\", \"conqueror\"), who was acknowledged as the legitimate successor of Majapahit. According to Babad Tanah Jawi and Demak tradition, the source of Patah's legitimacy was because their first sultan, Raden Patah, was the son of Majapahit king Brawijaya V with a Chinese concubine. Another argument supports Demak as the successor of Majapahit; the rising Demak sultanate was easily accepted as the nominal regional ruler, as Demak was the former Majapahit vassal and located near the former Majapahit realm in Eastern Java.\n\nDemak established itself as the regional power and the first Islamic sultanate in Java. After the fall of Majapahit, the Hindu kingdoms in Java only remained in [[Blambangan]] on the eastern edge and [[Sunda Kingdom|Pajajaran]] in the western part. Gradually [[Hindu]] communities began to retreat to the mountain ranges in East Java and also to the neighbouring island of [[Bali]]. A small enclave of [[Tenggerese people|Hindu communities]] still remain in the [[Tengger caldera|Tengger]] mountain range.\n\n== Military ==\nAccording to History of Yuan, soldiers of early Majapahit era were mainly dominated by poorly equipped light [[infantry]]. During the Mongol invasion of Java, Javanese army was described as temporarily mobilized farmers and a few noble warriors. The nobility marched at the front line, with huge rear army composed of peasants. The Javanese peasant army was half-naked and covered with cotton fabric at the waist ([[sarung]]).

Unlike the earlier naturalistic, relaxed and flowing figures of classical Central Java style ([[Sailendra]] art c. 8th to 10th century), this East Javanese style demonstrates a stiffer pose, stylised and rendered in [[wayang]]-like figures, such as those carved on East Javanese temple's bas-reliefs. The bas-reliefs were projected rather flat from the background. This style was later preserved in [[Balinese art]], especially in its [[Kamasan]] style classical paintings and Balinese wayang.\n\nThe statues of Hindu gods and Buddhist deities in Majapahit art were also the continuisation of its previous Singhasari art. The statues of East Javanese period tends to be stiffer and frontal-formal pose, compared to the statues of Central Javanese art (c. 9th century) that are more Indianized style, relaxed in [[tribhanga]] pose. The stiffer pose of Majapahit gods statues are probably in accordance to the statue's function as the deified portrayal self of the dead Majapahit monarch. The carving however, are richly decorated, especially with fine floral carving of lotus plants carved on the stela behind the statue. Examples of Majapahit statues are the Harihara statue from Simping temple, believed to be the deified portrayal of [[Raden Wijaya|King Kertarajasa]], the statue of Parwati believed to be the portrayal of [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi|Queen Tribhuwana]], and statue of queen [[Suhita]] discovered at Jebuk, Kalangbret, Tulungagung, East Java.\n\n[[File:Pair of door guardians SF Asian Art Museum.JPG|thumb|left|Pair of door guardians from a temple, Eastern Java, 14th century, [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco|Museum of Asian Art, San Francisco]].]]\n\nClay pottery and brick masonry are popular feature in Majapahit art and architecture. The [[Majapahit Terracotta]] art also flourished in this period. Significant numbers of [[terracotta]] artefacts were discovered in [[Trowulan]]. The artefacts ranges from human and animal figurines, jars, vessels, water containers, [[piggy bank]]s, bas reliefs, architectural ornaments, roof pinnacles, floor tiles, to pipes and roof tiles. One of the most interesting findings is Majapahit piggy bank. Several boar-shaped piggy banks has been discovered in Trowulan. It is probably the origin of Javanese-Indonesian word to refer for saving or money container. The word ''celengan'' in [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] means both \"savings\" and \"piggy bank\". It was derived from the word ''celeng'' which means \"wild boar\", the [[suffix]] \"-an\" was added to denote its likeness. One important specimen is stored in National Museum of Indonesia, it has been reconstructed since this large piggy bank has been found broken to pieces.\n\nTerracotta money boxes also has been found in different shapes, such as tubular or boxes, with slits to slip coins. Another important terracotta artefact is the head figurine of a man popularly thought to be the depiction of Gajah Mada, although it is not certain about who was depicted in these figurines.\n\n===Architecture===\n{{further|Candi of Indonesia}}\n[[File:Candi Jabung B.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Jabung]] temple near Paiton, Probolinggo, East Java, dated from Majapahit period.]]\n\nIn his book ''Yingya Shenglan'', Ma Huan also describes the Majapahit cities: most of them do not have walls surrounding the city or the suburbs. He describes the king's palace in Majapahit. The king's residence is surrounded with thick red brick walls more than three ''[[zhang (unit)|chang]]'' high (about {{convert|30.5|ft|m|abbr=off|disp=or}}), with length of more than 200 paces ({{convert|340|yd|m|abbr=off|disp=or}}) and on the wall there are two layers of gates, the palace is very well guarded and clean. The king's palace was a two-storey building, each of them 3 or 4 ''chang'' high ({{convert|9\u201314.5|m|abbr=off|disp=or}}). It had wooden plank floors and exposed mats made from rattan or reeds (presumably palm leaves), where people sat cross-legged. The roof was made of hardwood shingles (Javanese:''sirap'') laid as tiles.<ref name=yingyai />\n\nThe houses of commoners had thatched roofs ([[nipa palm]] leaves). Every family has a storage shed made of bricks, about 3 or 4 ''[[Chi (unit)|Ch'ih]]'' ({{convert|48.9|in|cm|abbr=off|disp=or}}) above the ground, where they kept the family property, and they lived on top of this building, to sit and sleep.\n\nThe Majapahit temple architecture follows the east Javanese styles, in contrast of earlier central Javanese style. This east Javanese temple style is also dated back from Kediri period c. 11th century. The shapes of Majapahit temples are tends to be slender and tall, with roof constructed from multiple parts of stepped sections formed a combined roof structure curved upward smoothly creating the [[Perspective (visual)|perspective illussion]] that the temple is perceived taller than its actual height. The pinnacle of the temples are usually cube (mostly Hindu temples), sometimes dagoba cylindrical structures (Buddhist temples).

The example of Majapahit temples are Brahu temple in Trowulan, [[Pari Temple|Pari]] in Sidoarjo, [[Jabung]] in Probolinggo, and [[Candi Surawana|Surawana temple]] near Kediri. Jabung temple was mentioned in Nagarakretagama as Bajrajinaparamitapura, despite some parts of its roof and pinnacles are now missing, it is one of the most well-preserved Majapahit temple architecture. Another example include Gunung Gangsir temple near Pasuruan. Some of the temples are dated from earlier period but renovated and expanded during Majapahit era, such as [[Candi Penataran|Penataran]], the largest temple in East Java dated back to [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]] era. This temple was identified in Nagarakretagama as Palah temple and reported being visited by King Hayam Wuruk during his royal tour across East Java. Another notable temple of Eastern Javanese style is [[Jawi temple]] in Pandaan \u2013 also visited by King Hayam Wuruk, the temple was mentioned in Nagarakretagama as Jajawa, and was dedicated as mortuary temple for his great grandfather, King Kertanegara of Singhasari.\n\nSome of typical architectural style are believed to be developed during Majapahit era; such as tall and slender roofed red brick gate commonly called as ''kori agung'' or ''[[paduraksa]]'', and also split gate of ''[[candi bentar]]''. The large split gate of Wringin Lawang located at Jatipasar, Trowulan, Mojokerto, East Java, is one of the oldest and the largest surviving ''candi bentar'' dated from Majapahit era. The ''candi bentar'' took shape of typical Majapahit temple structure \u2013 consists of three parts; foot, body and tall roof \u2013 evenly split into two mirroring structures to make a passage in the centre for people to walk through. This type of split gate has no doors and provides no real defensive purpose but narrowing the passage. It was probably only serve the ceremonial and aesthetic purpose, to create the sense of grandeur, before entering the next compound through tall roof ''paduraksa'' gate with enclosed door. The example of ''kori agung'' or ''paduraksa'' style gate is the elegant Bajang Ratu gate richly decorated with Kala demon, cyclops and also the bas-relief telling the story of Sri Tanjung. Those typical Majapahit architectural style has deeply influenced the Javanese and [[Balinese architecture]] of later period. The current prevalence of Majapahit style pendopo pavilion, candi bentar and paduraksa gates, was owed to the influence of Majapahit aesthetics on Javanese and Balinese architecture.<ref name=\"Made Wijaya\">{{cite book | title = Majapahit Style Vol.1 | author = Made Wijaya | publisher = Wijaya Words - a division of Yayasan Beringin Berapi| year = 2014 | isbn = 9786027136700| url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Majapahit_Style_Vol_1.html?id=J3GMBAAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y}}</ref>\n\nIn later period near the fall of Majapahit, the art and architecture of Majapahit witnessed the revival of indigenous native Austronesian [[megalithic architectural elements]], such as [[Candi Sukuh|Sukuh]] and [[Candi Cetho|Cetho]] temples on western slopes of [[Mount Lawu]].

(Collection of [[National Museum of Indonesia]], [[Jakarta]])]]\nTaxes and fines were paid in cash. Javanese economy had been partly monetised since the late 8th century, using gold and silver coins. Previously, the 9th-century [[Wonoboyo hoard]] discovered in Central Java shows that ancient Javan gold coins were seed-shaped, similar to corn, while the silver coins were similar to buttons. In about the year 1300, in the reign of Majapahit's first king, an important change took place: the indigenous coinage was completely replaced by imported Chinese copper cash. About 10,388 ancient Chinese coins weighing about 40&nbsp;kg were even unearthed from the backyard of a local commoner in [[Sidoarjo]] in November 2008. Indonesian Ancient Relics Conservation Bureau (BP3) of East Java verified that those coins dated as early as Majapahit era.<ref>{{cite web | title = Uang Kuno Temuan Rohimin Peninggalan Majapahit | url = http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2008/11/24/17571290/uang.kuno.temuan.rohimin.peninggalan.majapahit. | date = November 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131031003554/http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2008/11/24/17571290/uang.kuno.temuan.rohimin.peninggalan.majapahit. | archivedate = 31 October 2013}}</ref> The reason for using foreign currency is not given in any source, but most scholars assume it was due to the increasing complexity of Javanese economy and a desire for a [[currency]] system that used much smaller denominations suitable for use in everyday market transactions. This was a role for which gold and silver are not well suited.<ref name=miksic />{{rp | page=107}} These ''kepeng'' Chinese coins were thin rounded copper coins with a square hole in the centre of it. The hole was meant to tie together the money in a string of coins. These small changes\u2014the imported Chinese copper coins\u2014enabled Majapahit further invention, a method of savings by using a slitted earthenware coin containers. These are commonly found in Majapahit ruins, the slit is the small opening to put the coins in. The most popular shape is boar-shaped ''celengan'' (piggy bank).\n\nSome idea of scale of the internal economy can be gathered from scattered data in inscriptions. The Canggu inscriptions dated 1358 mentions 78 ferry crossings in the country (mandala Java).<ref name=miksic />{{rp | page=107}} Majapahit inscriptions mention a large number of occupational specialities, ranging from gold and silver smiths to drink vendors and butchers. Although many of these occupations had existed in earlier times, the proportion of the population earning an income from non-agrarian pursuits seems to have become even greater during the Majapahit era.\n\nThe great prosperity of Majapahit was probably due to two factors. Firstly, the northeast lowlands of Java were suitable for rice [[Tillage|cultivation]], and during Majapahit's prime numerous [[irrigation]] projects were undertaken, some with government assistance. Secondly, Majapahit's ports on the north coast were probably significant stations along the route to obtain the spices of [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]], and as the spices passed through Java they would have provided an important source of income for Majapahit.<ref name=miksic />{{rp|page=107}}\n\nThe Nagarakretagama states that the fame of the ruler of Wilwatikta (a synonym for Majapahit) attracted foreign merchants from far and wide, including Indians, Khmers, Siamese, and Chinese among others. While in later period, ''Yingya Shenglan'' mentioned that large numbers of Chinese traders and Muslim merchants from west (from Arab and India, but mostly from Muslim states in Sumatra and Malay peninsula) are settling in Majapahit port cities, such as Tuban, Gresik and Hujung Galuh ([[Surabaya]]). A special tax was levied against some foreigners, possibly those who had taken up semi-permanent residence in Java and conducted some type of enterprise other than foreign trade. The Majapahit Empire had trading links with Chinese [[Ming dynasty]], [[Vietnam|Annam]] and [[Champa]] in today Vietnam, [[Cambodia]], Siamese [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthayan]], Burmese [[Martaban]] and the south Indian [[Vijayanagara Empire]].\n\n==Administration==\n{{multiple image|align=right| direction = vertical|total_width=150|image1=Surya Majapahit.jpg|image2=Surya Majapahit 2.jpg|image3=Candi Ceto Majapahit Sun, Surakarta 1264.jpg|footer=Three designs of [[Surya Majapahit]], the sun emblem of the kingdom.}}\n\nDuring the reign of [[Hayam Wuruk]], Majapahit employed a well-organised bureaucratic structure for administrative purposes. The hierarchy and structure relatively remain intact and unchanged throughout Majapahit history.<ref name=\"SNI451\">Poesponegoro & Notosusanto (1990), hal. 451\u2013456.</ref> The king is the paramount ruler, as the [[chakravartin]] he is considered as the universal ruler and believed to be the living god on earth. The king holds the highest political authority and legitimacy.\n\n===Bureaucracy officials===\nDuring his daily administration, the king is assisted by bureaucratic state officials that also included the close relatives of the kings that hold certain esteemed titles. The royal order or edict usually transmitted from the king to the high officials well to their subordinates. The officials in Majapahit courts are:\n:* ''Rakryan Mahamantri Katrini'', usually reserved for the king's heir\n:* ''Rakryan Mantri ri Pakira-kiran'', the board of [[Minister (government)|ministers]] that conduct the daily administration\n:* ''Dharmmadhyaksa'', the officials of laws, state laws as well as religious laws\n:* ''Dharmma-upapatti'', the officials concerning religious affairs\n\nWithin the ministers of ''Rakryan Mantri ri Pakira-kiran'' there is the most important and the highest minister titled ''Rakryan Mapatih'' or ''Patih Hamangkubhumi''. This position is analogous to [[prime minister]], and together with king, they determine the important state policies, including war or peace. Among the Dharmmadhyaksa officials there is ''Dharmmadhyaksa ring Kasewan'' (State's highest Hindu [[Shivaist]] priest) and ''Dharmmadhyaksa ring Kasogatan'' (State's highest Buddhist priest), both are the religious laws authorities of each dharmic faiths.\n\nThere is also the board of advisors which consists of the elders within royal family called ''Bhattara Saptaprabhu''. This council consists of seven influential elders\u2014mostly directly related to the king. They are the ''Bhres'' (Duke or Duchess) acted as regional kings, the rulers of Majapahit provinces. This council congregates, offers advice, gave consideration to the king, and often formed an assembly to judge a certain important case in the court. Example of their office was, their sentence to temporarily suspend Mahamantri Gajah Mada, as a punishment since he was held responsible for the shamefully disastrous [[Battle of Bubat|Bubat incident]]. The council also sentenced the execution of Raden Gajah (Narapati) for decapitating Bhre Wirabhumi in [[Paregreg war]].<ref name=\"BP-Sejarah Nasional\">{{cite book | title = Sejarah nasional Indonesia: Zaman kuno \u2013 Volume 2 dari Sejarah nasional Indonesia | author1= Marwati Djoened Poesponegoro | author2= Soejono (R.

Usually this position reserved for the close relatives of the king. Their duty is to administer their own provinces, collect taxes, send annual tributes to the capital, and manage the defences of their borders.\n\nDuring the reign of Hayam Wuruk (1350\u20131389) there were 12 provinces of Majapahit, administered by king's close relatives:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" width=\"80%\"\n! width=\"260\" |Provinces\n! width=\"120\" |Titles\n! width=\"140\" |Rulers\n! width=\"260\" |Relation to the King\n|-\n|[[Kahuripan]] (or [[Janggala]], today [[Sidoarjo Regency|Sidoarjo]])\n|Bhre Kahuripan\n|Tribhuwanatunggadewi\n|queen mother\n|-\n|Daha (former capital of [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]])\n|Bhre Daha\n|Rajadewi Maharajasa\n|aunt and also mother-in-law\n|-\n|Tumapel (former capital of [[Singhasari]])\n|Bhre Tumapel\n|Kertawardhana\n|father\n|-\n|Wengker (today [[Ponorogo]])\n|Bhre Wengker\n|Wijayarajasa\n|uncle and also father-in-law\n|-\n|Matahun (today [[Bojonegoro]])\n|Bhre Matahun\n|Rajasawardhana\n|husband of the duchess of Lasem, king's cousin\n|-\n|Wirabhumi ([[Blambangan]])\n|Bhre Wirabhumi\n|Bhre Wirabhumi{{efn | group=lower-roman | 1=Bhre Wirabhumi is actually the title: the Duke of Wirabhumi (Blambangan), the real name is unknown.

The traditional or initial area of Majapahit during its formation before entering the imperial phase. This includes the capital city and the surrounding areas where the king effectively exercises his government. The area in and around royal capital of [[Trowulan]], port of Canggu and sections of [[Brantas River]] valley near the capital, also mountainous areas south and southeast of capital, all the way to [[Mount Penanggungan|Pananggungan]] and [[Arjuno-Welirang]] peaks, are the core realm of the kingdom. The Brantas river valley corridor, connecting Majapahit Trowulan area to Canggu and estuarine areas in Kahuripan (Sidoarjo) and [[Janggala|Hujung Galuh]] port (Surabaya) are considered as parts of ''Negara Agung''.\n* '''''Mancanegara''''', areas surrounding ''Negara Agung'' \u2014 traditionally refer to Majapahit provinces in East and Central Java. This area covered the eastern half of Java, with all its provinces ruled by the ''Bhres'' (dukes), the king's close relatives. These areas are directly influenced by Javanese Majapahit court culture, and obliged to pay annual tributes. These areas usually possess their own rulers that might be directly related, foster an alliance or intermarried with the Majapahit royal family. Majapahit stationed their officials and officers in these places and regulate their foreign trade activities and collect taxes, yet they enjoyed substantial internal autonomy. This includes the rest of [[Java]] island, [[Madura]] and [[Bali]]. However, in later period, overseas provinces which has developed culture reflected or comparable to those of Java, or possess significant trading importance, are also considered as ''mancanegara''. Either the province has their own native rulers subject (vassal) to the king, or a regent appointed and sent by the king to rule the region. This realm includes [[Melayu Kingdom|Dharmasraya]], [[Pagaruyung Kingdom|Pagaruyung]], [[Lampung]] and [[Palembang]] in [[Sumatra]].\n* '''''Nusantara''''', areas which do not reflect Javanese culture, but are included as colonies and they had to pay annual tribute. They had their native polity intact, enjoyed substantial autonomy and internal freedom, and Majapahit did not necessarily station their officials or military officers here; however, any challenges on Majapahit oversight might draw severe response. These areas such as the vassal kingdoms and colonies in [[Malay peninsula]], [[Borneo]], [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], [[Sulawesi]] and [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]].\n[[File:Filippine, provincia di agusan, immagine hindu, statuetta in oro massiccio, xiii secolo.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A 1.79 kilogram, 21-karat Majapahit period [[Golden Tara|gold image]] discovered in [[Esperanza, Agusan|Agusan]], [[Philippines]], copied Nganjuk bronze images of the early Majapahit period,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcollections.universiteitleiden.nl/view/item/7096|title=[Bronze statues from Nganjuk] OD-3577 {{!}} Digital Collections|website=digitalcollections.universiteitleiden.nl|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> signify Majapahit cultural influence on southern Philippines.]]\n\n[[Nagarakretagama#Descriptions of the Majapahit realm|Nagarakretagama]] mentioned more than 80 places in the archipelago described as the vassal states.<ref name=\"Britannica-Majapahit\"/> In Canto 13, several lands on [[Sumatra]] are mentioned, and some possibly correspond to contemporary areas: [[Jambi]], [[Palembang]], Teba ([[Toba Samosir Regency|Toba]]), and [[Dharmasraya]].

Since early of its formation, Majapahit inherited the foreign outlook of its predecessor entity \u2013 [[Singhasari]] kingdom, in which its last king [[Kertanegara]] projected his influence abroad by launching [[Pamalayu]] expedition (1275-1293) to incorporate Malay polities in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula within Javanese sphere of influence. Previously, Singhasari seeks to dominate trade route, especially Malacca strait, and also saw the outreach of Mongolian-Chinese Yuan influence into Southeast Asia as the threat to their own interest.\n\nDuring its formation, the returning Pamalayu expedition in 1293 has brought Malayu Kingdoms in Jambi and Dharmasraya under Javanese suzerainty. Therefore, Java often consider itself as the overlord of most of polities in the Indonesian archipelago. In Sumatran front, Majapahit did capture Palembang, Jambi and Dharmasraya, invade [[Samudera Pasai Sultanate|Pasai]], and it also saw the settlement of [[Temasek|Tumasik]], that later become [[Kingdom of Singapura]], as its rebellious colony, and thus deal with them accordingly.\n\nDuring the reign of Majapahit's first two monarch \u2013 Wijaya and Jayanegara, the kingdom struggled to consolidate its rule, plagued by a number of rebellions. However, it was not until the reign of its third monarch \u2013 Queen Tribhuwana Tunggadewi, and her son, Hayam Wuruk \u2013 that the kingdom began to projected its power overseas. Majapahit's confidence for dominance was stemmed for their economic and demographic comparative advantage; agrarian as well as maritime nation; their large rice production, immense human resources, well-organized society, also their mastery in shipbuilding, navigation and military technology; are excellent relatively compared to their neighbours. These strengths were used by Gajah Mada to expand the kingdom's influence and building a maritime empire. This rather imperialistic outlooks, has projected in the way he forcefully dealt with Majapahit's neighbours; the Pabali (conquest of Bali, 1342\u20131343) and the [[Battle of Bubat|Pasunda Bubat]] (1356). Majapahit pulled Bali into their orbit as a vassal state. While the disastrous diplomacy with Sunda kingdom has led to the enmity among them.\n\nWithin Indonesian archipelago, Majapahit saw itself as the center of a huge mandala. This notion is demonstrated by its three tier administrative hierarchy; Nagara Agung, Mancanegara, and Nusantara. Outside of Maritime Southeast Asia, Majapahit devices Mitreka Satata, or partner in common order, in which it saw several states as ally. They are [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]], [[Nakhon Si Thammarat kingdom]], [[Ratchaburi]], [[Songkla]], [[Mottama]], [[Champa]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Vietnam|Annam]].\n\n[[File:Bhairava Adityavarman.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Adityawarman depicted as Bhairava]]\nMajapahit overlordship upon Malay states of Sumatra was demonstrated by the rule of [[Adityawarman]] of Malayupura. Adityawarman, the cousin of King Jayanegara, was raised within Majapahit palace and rose to become a senior minister in Majapahit court. He was sent to led Majapahit military expansion to conquer east coast region in Sumatra. Adityawarman then founded the royal dynasty of [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] in [[Pagarruyung]] and presided over the central Sumatra region to take control of the gold trade between 1347 and 1375.\n\nIn later years after the era of Hayam Wuruk, Majapahit has lost their grips on some of their overseas possessions. This led to the thrive and the rise of several polities previously held under Majapahit domination, such as [[Bruneian Empire|Brunei]] and [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]]. The rise of Malacca in 15th century in particular is important, because it represents Majapahit eventual failure to control Malacca strait. Previously Majapahit tried to contain the rise of a potential regional rival; a Malay polity in par with Srivijaya, by punishing a rebellion in Palembang and capturing Singapura. In this sense, Malacca was indeed the rival of Majapahit in the competition to dominate the archipelagic realm. Despite this perceived rivalry, in practice however, the two kingdoms actually had some close and intense economic and cultural relations. At that time, the trade link between Majapahit ports of Hujung Galuh and Tuban with port of Melaka must be thriving.\n\nMajapahit true rival for domination however, was the powerful [[Ming Dynasty|Ming Chinese]]. After the fall of Yuan, the Ming Emperor eager to project his power into Southeast Asia. On the other hand Majapahit saw this archipelagic realm as theirs and unwelcome to any perceived Chinese interference. After Majapahit was weaken by Paregreg civil war, and incessant conflicts among its nobles, the arrival of the formidable [[Ming treasure voyages]] led by [[Zheng He]] upon Majapahit shores has pushed Majapahit prestigue and power to the side. Ming on the other hand, actively support the rise of Malacca. This Ming protection has made Majapahit unwilling and unable to push Malacca anymore. \n\nMajapahit ultimate nemesis however, was located very close at home; the [[Demak Sultanate]] on northern coast of Central Java. Ming support to Malacca, and Malacca active proselytizing of Islam, has led to the thrive and rise of Muslim traders community in the archipelago, including in Majapahit ports on the north coast of Java. This in turn gradually corroded the prestigue of Javanese Hindu-Buddhist kingship, and after several generations, led to the fall of once mighty Majapahit empire.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Pura Maospahit Denpasar Bali.jpg|thumb|right|''Pura Maospahit'' (\"Majapahit Temple\") in [[Denpasar]], Bali, demonstrate the typical Majapahit red brick architecture.]]\n\nMajapahit was the largest empire ever to form in Southeast Asia.<ref name=miksic />{{rp|page=107}} Although its political power beyond the core area in east Java was diffuse, constituting mainly ceremonial recognition of suzerainty, Majapahit society developed a high degree of sophistication in both commercial and artistic activities.

Other than Javanese sources, some regional legends mentioning Majapahit kingdom or its general Gajah Mada, also can be found; from Aceh, Minangkabau, Palembang, Malay Peninsula, Sunda, Brunei, Bali to Sumbawa. Most of them mentioned about the incoming Javanese forces to their land, which was probably a local testament of the empire's expansive nature that once dominating the archipelago. The [[Hikayat Raja-raja Pasai|Hikayat Raja Pasai]], a 14th-century [[Aceh]] chronicle tell a Majapahit naval invasion against [[Samudra Pasai]] in 1350.

The [[Panji (prince)|Panji cycles]], the tale of [[Sri Tanjung]], and the epic of [[Damarwulan]], are popular tales in Javanese and [[Balinese literature]]s. The tales of Panji was dated from older period during Kediri kingdom, while the tale of Sri Tanjung and the epic of Damarwulan took place during Majapahit period. These tales remained a popular theme in Javanese culture of later period during Mataram Sultanate, and often became the source of inspiration for [[wayang]] shadow puppet performance, [[ketoprak]] and [[topeng]] dance drama. The Panji tales in particular have spread from East Java to become a source of inspiration for literature and dance drama throughout the region, as far as Malay peninsula, Cambodia and Siam where he is known as Raden Inao or Enau ({{lang-th|\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e32}}) of Kurepan.{{Sfn|Holt|1967|p=274}}\n\nMajapahit had a momentous and lasting influence on [[Indonesian art]] and [[Indonesian architecture|architecture]]. The empire's expansion circa 14th-century, contributed to the difussion Javanese cultural influence throughout the archipelago, which can be seen as a form of [[Javanisation]]. It was probably during this period that some of Javanese cultural elements, such as [[gamelan]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/history-of-gamelan-195131|title=Learn the History Behind Gamelan, Indonesian Music and Dance|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=13 November 2018}}</ref> and kris, being expanded and introduced to islands outside of Java.

The Majapahit style ''[[candi bentar]]'' split gate, the ''kori'' or ''[[paduraksa]]'' towering red brick gate, and also ''pendopo'' pavilion have become ubiquitous in Javanese and Balinese architectural features, as seen in [[Menara Kudus Mosque]], [[Keraton Kasepuhan]] and Sunyaragi park in [[Cirebon]], [[Mataram Sultanate]] royal cemetery in [[Kota Gede]], [[Yogyakarta]], and various palaces and temples in Bali.<ref name=\"Made Wijaya\"/>\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Bas-reli\u00ebfs op het Pendopo Terras Panataran tempelcomplex TMnr 20027152.jpg|thumb|right|Bas relief from [[Candi Penataran]] describes the Javanese-style [[pendopo]] pavilion, commonly found across Java and Bali.]]\n\nThe vivid, rich and festive [[Balinese people#Culture|Balinese culture]] is considered as one of Majapahit legacy.

The aesthetics and style of bas-reliefs in Majapahit East Javanese temples were preserved and copied in Balinese temples. It is also due to the fact that after the fall of the empire, many Majapahit nobles, artisans and priests had taken refuge either in the interior mountainous region of East Java or across the narrow strait to Bali. Indeed, in some ways the [[Bali Kingdom|Kingdom of Bali]] was the successor of Majapahit. Large numbers of Majapahit manuscripts, such as [[Nagarakretagama]], [[Kakawin Sutasoma|Sutasoma]], [[Pararaton]] and [[Tantu Pagelaran]], were being well-kept in royal libraries of Bali and Lombok, and provides the glimpse and valuable historical records on Majapahit. The Majapahit Hindu-Javanese culture has shaped the culture of Bali, that led to popular expression; \"without Java there is no Bali\". Yet in return, Bali is credited as the last stronghold to safeguard and preserve the ancient Hindu Javanese civilisation.\n\n[[File:WLANL - mchangsp - Kris van Knaud.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Kris of Knaud]], one of the oldest surviving kris is dated to Majapahit period]]\n\nIn weaponry, the Majapahit expansion is believed to be responsible for the widespread use of the [[Kris|keris]] dagger in Southeast Asia; from Java, Bali, Sumatra, Malaysia, Brunei to Southern Thailand.

One of his distasteful acts was his desire to take his own half sisters, Gitarja and Rajadewi, as wives. Since Javanese tradition abhorred the practice of half siblings marrying, the council of royal elders spoke strongly against the king's wishes. It was not clear what motivated Jayanegara's wish \u2013 it might have been his way to ensure his claim to the throne by preventing rivals from being his half sisters' suitors, although in the later period of the Majapahit court the custom of marriage among cousins was quite common. In the ''[[Pararaton]]'', he was known as ''Kala Gemet'', or \"weak villain\". About the time of Jayanegara's reign, the Italian Friar [[Odoric of Pordenone]] visited the Majapahit court in Java.\n\nIn 1328, Jayanegara was murdered by his physician, Tanca, during a surgical operation. In complete mayhem and rage, Gajah Mada immediately killed Tanca. The motive behind this [[regicide]] was never clear. According to the ''Pararaton'', it was Tanca's revenge for the king sexually abusing his wife.

After the conquest of Bali, Majapahit distributed the governing authority of Bali among Arya Damar's younger brothers, Arya Kenceng, Arya Kutawandira, Arya Sentong, and Arya Belog. Arya Kenceng led his brothers to govern Bali under Majapahit suzerainty, and he would become the progenitor of the Balinese kings of the Tabanan and Badung royal houses.

These Chinese voyages visited numbers of ports in Asia as far as [[Africa]], including Majapahit ports. It was said that Zheng He has paid a visit to the Majapahit court in Java.\n\nThese massive Chinese voyages were not merely a naval exploration, but also a show of power and a display of geopolitical reach.

However, perhaps the most significant Chinese intervention was its support for the newly established [[Sultanate of Malacca]], as a rival and counter-weight to the Majapahit influence of Java.<ref name=\"TOI-Sanyal\" /> \n\nPreviously, Majapahit has succeeded to assert its influence in Malacca strait by containing the aspiration of Malay polities in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula to ever reach the geopolitical might like those of Srivijaya. The Hindu Majapahit were the most powerful maritime power in Southeast Asian seas that time and were opposed to Chinese expansion into their sphere of influence. The Ming's support for Malacca, and the spread of Islam propagated by both Malacca and Zheng He's treasure fleet has weakened Majapahit maritime influence in Sumatra, which caused the northern part of the island to increasingly converting to Islam and gained independence from Majapahit, leaving [[Indragiri]], [[Jambi]] and [[Palembang]], remnants of the old [[Srivijaya]], the only suzerainty under Majapahit in Sumatra,{{efn | group=lower-roman | According to the History of Ming, only these areas in Sumatra were still mentioned as under Javanese / Majapahit supremacy at the time.

Malacca actively encouraged the conversion to [[Islam]] in the region, while Ming fleet actively established Chinese-Malay Muslim community in coastal northern Java, thus created a permanent opposition to the Hindus of Java. By 1430, the expeditions had established Muslim Chinese, Arab and Malay communities in northern ports of Java such as [[Semarang]], [[Demak, Indonesia|Demak]], [[Tuban]], and [[Surabaya|Ampel]]; thus Islam began to gain a foothold on the northern coast of Java.

After Kertawijaya died, [[Bhre Pamotan]] became a king with formal name Rajasawardhana. He died in 1453. A three-year kingless period was possibly the result of a succession crisis. [[Girisawardhana]], son of Kertawijaya, came to power in 1456. He died in 1466 and was succeeded by Singhawikramawardhana.\n\n====The divide====\nIn 1468 Prince Kertabhumi rebelled against Singhawikramawardhana, promoting himself as the king of Majapahit. Deposed Singhawikramawardhana retreated upstream of Brantas River, moved the kingdom's capital further inland to [[Kediri (city)|Daha]] (the former capital of [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri kingdom]]), effectively splitting Majapahit, under Bhre Kertabumi in Trowulan and Singhawikramawardhana in Daha. Singhawikramawardhana continued his rule until he was succeeded by his son [[Girindrawardhana]] (Ranawijaya) in 1474.\n\nAnd in between this period of the dividing court of Majapahit, the kingdom found itself unable to control its western part of the already crumbling empire. The rising power of the [[Sultanate of Malacca]] began to gain effective control of [[Strait of Malacca|Malacca Strait]] in the mid-15th century and expanding its influence to Sumatra. And amidst these events, Indragiri and Siantan, according to [[Malay Annals]] were given to Malacca as a dowry for the marriage of a Majapahit princess and the [[Mansur Shah of Malacca|sultan of Malacca]].<ref name=\"Leyden\">Leyden, John (1821)[https://books.google.co.id/books?id=J9JAAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false Malay Annals (translated from the Malay language)], Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme and Brown.</ref>, further weakening Majapahit's influence on the western part of the archipelago. Kertabhumi managed to stabilized this situation by allying with Muslim merchants, giving them trading rights on the north coast of Java, with [[Demak Regency|Demak]] as its centre and in return asked for their loyalty to Majapahit. This policy boosted the Majapahit treasury and power, but weakened Hindu-Buddhism as its main religion because [[Dawah|Islamic proselytizing]] spread faster, especially in Javanese coastal principalities.

The refugees fled to the east to avoid Demak retribution for their support for Ranawijaya against Kertabhumi. \n\nDemak came under the leadership of Raden (later crowned as Sultan) Patah (Arabic name: Fatah, lit. \"liberator\", \"conqueror\"), who was acknowledged as the legitimate successor of Majapahit. According to Babad Tanah Jawi and Demak tradition, the source of Patah's legitimacy was because their first sultan, Raden Patah, was the son of Majapahit king Brawijaya V with a Chinese concubine. Another argument supports Demak as the successor of Majapahit; the rising Demak sultanate was easily accepted as the nominal regional ruler, as Demak was the former Majapahit vassal and located near the former Majapahit realm in Eastern Java.\n\nDemak established itself as the regional power and the first Islamic sultanate in Java. After the fall of Majapahit, the Hindu kingdoms in Java only remained in [[Blambangan]] on the eastern edge and [[Sunda Kingdom|Pajajaran]] in the western part. Gradually [[Hindu]] communities began to retreat to the mountain ranges in East Java and also to the neighbouring island of [[Bali]]. A small enclave of [[Tenggerese people|Hindu communities]] still remain in the [[Tengger caldera|Tengger]] mountain range.\n\n== Military ==\nAccording to History of Yuan, soldiers of early Majapahit era were mainly dominated by poorly equipped light [[infantry]]. During the Mongol invasion of Java, Javanese army was described as temporarily mobilized farmers and a few noble warriors. The nobility marched at the front line, with huge rear army composed of peasants. The Javanese peasant army was half-naked and covered with cotton fabric at the waist ([[sarung]]). Most of the weapons are bows and arrows, [[bamboo]] spears, and short blades. Aristocrats are deeply influenced by Indian culture, usually armed with swords and spears, dressed in white.<ref name=\":0\">Song Lian.

In this age, even to the 17th century, the Nusantaran soldiers fought on a platform called ''Balai'' and performed boarding actions.

Unlike the earlier naturalistic, relaxed and flowing figures of classical Central Java style ([[Sailendra]] art c. 8th to 10th century), this East Javanese style demonstrates a stiffer pose, stylised and rendered in [[wayang]]-like figures, such as those carved on East Javanese temple's bas-reliefs. The bas-reliefs were projected rather flat from the background. This style was later preserved in [[Balinese art]], especially in its [[Kamasan]] style classical paintings and Balinese wayang.\n\nThe statues of Hindu gods and Buddhist deities in Majapahit art were also the continuisation of its previous Singhasari art. The statues of East Javanese period tends to be stiffer and frontal-formal pose, compared to the statues of Central Javanese art (c. 9th century) that are more Indianized style, relaxed in [[tribhanga]] pose. The stiffer pose of Majapahit gods statues are probably in accordance to the statue's function as the deified portrayal self of the dead Majapahit monarch. The carving however, are richly decorated, especially with fine floral carving of lotus plants carved on the stela behind the statue. Examples of Majapahit statues are the Harihara statue from Simping temple, believed to be the deified portrayal of [[Raden Wijaya|King Kertarajasa]], the statue of Parwati believed to be the portrayal of [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi|Queen Tribhuwana]], and statue of queen [[Suhita]] discovered at Jebuk, Kalangbret, Tulungagung, East Java.\n\n[[File:Pair of door guardians SF Asian Art Museum.JPG|thumb|left|Pair of door guardians from a temple, Eastern Java, 14th century, [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco|Museum of Asian Art, San Francisco]].]]\n\nClay pottery and brick masonry are popular feature in Majapahit art and architecture.

It is probably the origin of Javanese-Indonesian word to refer for saving or money container. The word ''celengan'' in [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] means both \"savings\" and \"piggy bank\". It was derived from the word ''celeng'' which means \"wild boar\", the [[suffix]] \"-an\" was added to denote its likeness. One important specimen is stored in National Museum of Indonesia, it has been reconstructed since this large piggy bank has been found broken to pieces.\n\nTerracotta money boxes also has been found in different shapes, such as tubular or boxes, with slits to slip coins.

Every family has a storage shed made of bricks, about 3 or 4 ''[[Chi (unit)|Ch'ih]]'' ({{convert|48.9|in|cm|abbr=off|disp=or}}) above the ground, where they kept the family property, and they lived on top of this building, to sit and sleep.\n\nThe Majapahit temple architecture follows the east Javanese styles, in contrast of earlier central Javanese style. This east Javanese temple style is also dated back from Kediri period c. 11th century. The shapes of Majapahit temples are tends to be slender and tall, with roof constructed from multiple parts of stepped sections formed a combined roof structure curved upward smoothly creating the [[Perspective (visual)|perspective illussion]] that the temple is perceived taller than its actual height. The pinnacle of the temples are usually cube (mostly Hindu temples), sometimes dagoba cylindrical structures (Buddhist temples). Although some of temples dated from Majapahit period used [[andesite]] or [[sandstone]], the red [[brick]]s is also a popular construction material.\n\n[[File:Bajang Ratu Gate Trowulan.jpg|left|upright|thumb|The 16.5-metre tall Bajang Ratu [[Paduraksa]] gate, at Trowulan, echoed the grandeur of Majapahit.]]\n\nAlthough [[brick]] had been used in the ''[[Candi of Indonesia|candi]]'' of Indonesia's classical age, it was Majapahit architects of the 14th and 15th centuries who mastered it.<ref name=\"Schoppert1997\">{{cite book|author=Schoppert, P., Damais, S.|title=Java Style|year=1997|publisher=Periplus Editions|editor=Didier Millet|location=Paris|pages=33\u201334|isbn=962-593-232-1}}</ref> Making use of a vine sap and [[palm sugar]] mortar, their temples had a strong geometric quality. The example of Majapahit temples are Brahu temple in Trowulan, [[Pari Temple|Pari]] in Sidoarjo, [[Jabung]] in Probolinggo, and [[Candi Surawana|Surawana temple]] near Kediri. Jabung temple was mentioned in Nagarakretagama as Bajrajinaparamitapura, despite some parts of its roof and pinnacles are now missing, it is one of the most well-preserved Majapahit temple architecture. Another example include Gunung Gangsir temple near Pasuruan. Some of the temples are dated from earlier period but renovated and expanded during Majapahit era, such as [[Candi Penataran|Penataran]], the largest temple in East Java dated back to [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]] era. This temple was identified in Nagarakretagama as Palah temple and reported being visited by King Hayam Wuruk during his royal tour across East Java. Another notable temple of Eastern Javanese style is [[Jawi temple]] in Pandaan \u2013 also visited by King Hayam Wuruk, the temple was mentioned in Nagarakretagama as Jajawa, and was dedicated as mortuary temple for his great grandfather, King Kertanegara of Singhasari.\n\nSome of typical architectural style are believed to be developed during Majapahit era; such as tall and slender roofed red brick gate commonly called as ''kori agung'' or ''[[paduraksa]]'', and also split gate of ''[[candi bentar]]''. The large split gate of Wringin Lawang located at Jatipasar, Trowulan, Mojokerto, East Java, is one of the oldest and the largest surviving ''candi bentar'' dated from Majapahit era. The ''candi bentar'' took shape of typical Majapahit temple structure \u2013 consists of three parts; foot, body and tall roof \u2013 evenly split into two mirroring structures to make a passage in the centre for people to walk through. This type of split gate has no doors and provides no real defensive purpose but narrowing the passage. It was probably only serve the ceremonial and aesthetic purpose, to create the sense of grandeur, before entering the next compound through tall roof ''paduraksa'' gate with enclosed door. The example of ''kori agung'' or ''paduraksa'' style gate is the elegant Bajang Ratu gate richly decorated with Kala demon, cyclops and also the bas-relief telling the story of Sri Tanjung. Those typical Majapahit architectural style has deeply influenced the Javanese and [[Balinese architecture]] of later period. The current prevalence of Majapahit style pendopo pavilion, candi bentar and paduraksa gates, was owed to the influence of Majapahit aesthetics on Javanese and Balinese architecture.<ref name=\"Made Wijaya\">{{cite book | title = Majapahit Style Vol.1 | author = Made Wijaya | publisher = Wijaya Words - a division of Yayasan Beringin Berapi| year = 2014 | isbn = 9786027136700| url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Majapahit_Style_Vol_1.html?id=J3GMBAAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y}}</ref>\n\nIn later period near the fall of Majapahit, the art and architecture of Majapahit witnessed the revival of indigenous native Austronesian [[megalithic architectural elements]], such as [[Candi Sukuh|Sukuh]] and [[Candi Cetho|Cetho]] temples on western slopes of [[Mount Lawu]]. Unlike previous Majapahit temples that demonstrate typical Hindu architecture of high-rise towering structure, the shape of these temples are [[step pyramid]], quite similar to Mesoamerican [[pyramid]]s. The stepped pyramid structure called ''Punden Berundak'' (stepped mounds) is a common megalithic structure during [[Prehistoric Indonesia|Indonesian prehistoric era]] before the adoption of Hindu-Buddhist culture.\n\n==Economy==\nAlso in ''Yingya Shenglan'', Ma Huan reported the Javanese economy and market.

Previously, the 9th-century [[Wonoboyo hoard]] discovered in Central Java shows that ancient Javan gold coins were seed-shaped, similar to corn, while the silver coins were similar to buttons. In about the year 1300, in the reign of Majapahit's first king, an important change took place: the indigenous coinage was completely replaced by imported Chinese copper cash. About 10,388 ancient Chinese coins weighing about 40&nbsp;kg were even unearthed from the backyard of a local commoner in [[Sidoarjo]] in November 2008. Indonesian Ancient Relics Conservation Bureau (BP3) of East Java verified that those coins dated as early as Majapahit era.<ref>{{cite web | title = Uang Kuno Temuan Rohimin Peninggalan Majapahit | url = http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2008/11/24/17571290/uang.kuno.temuan.rohimin.peninggalan.majapahit. | date = November 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131031003554/http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2008/11/24/17571290/uang.kuno.temuan.rohimin.peninggalan.majapahit. | archivedate = 31 October 2013}}</ref> The reason for using foreign currency is not given in any source, but most scholars assume it was due to the increasing complexity of Javanese economy and a desire for a [[currency]] system that used much smaller denominations suitable for use in everyday market transactions. This was a role for which gold and silver are not well suited.<ref name=miksic />{{rp | page=107}} These ''kepeng'' Chinese coins were thin rounded copper coins with a square hole in the centre of it. The hole was meant to tie together the money in a string of coins. These small changes\u2014the imported Chinese copper coins\u2014enabled Majapahit further invention, a method of savings by using a slitted earthenware coin containers. These are commonly found in Majapahit ruins, the slit is the small opening to put the coins in. The most popular shape is boar-shaped ''celengan'' (piggy bank).\n\nSome idea of scale of the internal economy can be gathered from scattered data in inscriptions. The Canggu inscriptions dated 1358 mentions 78 ferry crossings in the country (mandala Java).<ref name=miksic />{{rp | page=107}} Majapahit inscriptions mention a large number of occupational specialities, ranging from gold and silver smiths to drink vendors and butchers. Although many of these occupations had existed in earlier times, the proportion of the population earning an income from non-agrarian pursuits seems to have become even greater during the Majapahit era.\n\nThe great prosperity of Majapahit was probably due to two factors. Firstly, the northeast lowlands of Java were suitable for rice [[Tillage|cultivation]], and during Majapahit's prime numerous [[irrigation]] projects were undertaken, some with government assistance. Secondly, Majapahit's ports on the north coast were probably significant stations along the route to obtain the spices of [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]], and as the spices passed through Java they would have provided an important source of income for Majapahit.<ref name=miksic />{{rp|page=107}}\n\nThe Nagarakretagama states that the fame of the ruler of Wilwatikta (a synonym for Majapahit) attracted foreign merchants from far and wide, including Indians, Khmers, Siamese, and Chinese among others. While in later period, ''Yingya Shenglan'' mentioned that large numbers of Chinese traders and Muslim merchants from west (from Arab and India, but mostly from Muslim states in Sumatra and Malay peninsula) are settling in Majapahit port cities, such as Tuban, Gresik and Hujung Galuh ([[Surabaya]]). A special tax was levied against some foreigners, possibly those who had taken up semi-permanent residence in Java and conducted some type of enterprise other than foreign trade. The Majapahit Empire had trading links with Chinese [[Ming dynasty]], [[Vietnam|Annam]] and [[Champa]] in today Vietnam, [[Cambodia]], Siamese [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthayan]], Burmese [[Martaban]] and the south Indian [[Vijayanagara Empire]].\n\n==Administration==\n{{multiple image|align=right| direction = vertical|total_width=150|image1=Surya Majapahit.jpg|image2=Surya Majapahit 2.jpg|image3=Candi Ceto Majapahit Sun, Surakarta 1264.jpg|footer=Three designs of [[Surya Majapahit]], the sun emblem of the kingdom.}}\n\nDuring the reign of [[Hayam Wuruk]], Majapahit employed a well-organised bureaucratic structure for administrative purposes. The hierarchy and structure relatively remain intact and unchanged throughout Majapahit history.<ref name=\"SNI451\">Poesponegoro & Notosusanto (1990), hal. 451\u2013456.</ref> The king is the paramount ruler, as the [[chakravartin]] he is considered as the universal ruler and believed to be the living god on earth. The king holds the highest political authority and legitimacy.\n\n===Bureaucracy officials===\nDuring his daily administration, the king is assisted by bureaucratic state officials that also included the close relatives of the kings that hold certain esteemed titles. The royal order or edict usually transmitted from the king to the high officials well to their subordinates. The officials in Majapahit courts are:\n:* ''Rakryan Mahamantri Katrini'', usually reserved for the king's heir\n:* ''Rakryan Mantri ri Pakira-kiran'', the board of [[Minister (government)|ministers]] that conduct the daily administration\n:* ''Dharmmadhyaksa'', the officials of laws, state laws as well as religious laws\n:* ''Dharmma-upapatti'', the officials concerning religious affairs\n\nWithin the ministers of ''Rakryan Mantri ri Pakira-kiran'' there is the most important and the highest minister titled ''Rakryan Mapatih'' or ''Patih Hamangkubhumi''. This position is analogous to [[prime minister]], and together with king, they determine the important state policies, including war or peace. Among the Dharmmadhyaksa officials there is ''Dharmmadhyaksa ring Kasewan'' (State's highest Hindu [[Shivaist]] priest) and ''Dharmmadhyaksa ring Kasogatan'' (State's highest Buddhist priest), both are the religious laws authorities of each dharmic faiths.\n\nThere is also the board of advisors which consists of the elders within royal family called ''Bhattara Saptaprabhu''. This council consists of seven influential elders\u2014mostly directly related to the king. They are the ''Bhres'' (Duke or Duchess) acted as regional kings, the rulers of Majapahit provinces. This council congregates, offers advice, gave consideration to the king, and often formed an assembly to judge a certain important case in the court. Example of their office was, their sentence to temporarily suspend Mahamantri Gajah Mada, as a punishment since he was held responsible for the shamefully disastrous [[Battle of Bubat|Bubat incident]]. The council also sentenced the execution of Raden Gajah (Narapati) for decapitating Bhre Wirabhumi in [[Paregreg war]].<ref name=\"BP-Sejarah Nasional\">{{cite book | title = Sejarah nasional Indonesia: Zaman kuno \u2013 Volume 2 dari Sejarah nasional Indonesia | author1= Marwati Djoened Poesponegoro | author2= Soejono (R.

This region is ruled by provincial kings called ''Paduka Bhattara'' with the title ''Bhre''. This title is the highest position below the monarch and similar to duke or duchess. Usually this position reserved for the close relatives of the king. Their duty is to administer their own provinces, collect taxes, send annual tributes to the capital, and manage the defences of their borders.\n\nDuring the reign of Hayam Wuruk (1350\u20131389) there were 12 provinces of Majapahit, administered by king's close relatives:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" width=\"80%\"\n! width=\"260\" |Provinces\n! width=\"120\" |Titles\n! width=\"140\" |Rulers\n! width=\"260\" |Relation to the King\n|-\n|[[Kahuripan]] (or [[Janggala]], today [[Sidoarjo Regency|Sidoarjo]])\n|Bhre Kahuripan\n|Tribhuwanatunggadewi\n|queen mother\n|-\n|Daha (former capital of [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]])\n|Bhre Daha\n|Rajadewi Maharajasa\n|aunt and also mother-in-law\n|-\n|Tumapel (former capital of [[Singhasari]])\n|Bhre Tumapel\n|Kertawardhana\n|father\n|-\n|Wengker (today [[Ponorogo]])\n|Bhre Wengker\n|Wijayarajasa\n|uncle and also father-in-law\n|-\n|Matahun (today [[Bojonegoro]])\n|Bhre Matahun\n|Rajasawardhana\n|husband of the duchess of Lasem, king's cousin\n|-\n|Wirabhumi ([[Blambangan]])\n|Bhre Wirabhumi\n|Bhre Wirabhumi{{efn | group=lower-roman | 1=Bhre Wirabhumi is actually the title: the Duke of Wirabhumi (Blambangan), the real name is unknown.

The traditional or initial area of Majapahit during its formation before entering the imperial phase. This includes the capital city and the surrounding areas where the king effectively exercises his government. The area in and around royal capital of [[Trowulan]], port of Canggu and sections of [[Brantas River]] valley near the capital, also mountainous areas south and southeast of capital, all the way to [[Mount Penanggungan|Pananggungan]] and [[Arjuno-Welirang]] peaks, are the core realm of the kingdom. The Brantas river valley corridor, connecting Majapahit Trowulan area to Canggu and estuarine areas in Kahuripan (Sidoarjo) and [[Janggala|Hujung Galuh]] port (Surabaya) are considered as parts of ''Negara Agung''.\n* '''''Mancanegara''''', areas surrounding ''Negara Agung'' \u2014 traditionally refer to Majapahit provinces in East and Central Java. This area covered the eastern half of Java, with all its provinces ruled by the ''Bhres'' (dukes), the king's close relatives. These areas are directly influenced by Javanese Majapahit court culture, and obliged to pay annual tributes. These areas usually possess their own rulers that might be directly related, foster an alliance or intermarried with the Majapahit royal family. Majapahit stationed their officials and officers in these places and regulate their foreign trade activities and collect taxes, yet they enjoyed substantial internal autonomy. This includes the rest of [[Java]] island, [[Madura]] and [[Bali]]. However, in later period, overseas provinces which has developed culture reflected or comparable to those of Java, or possess significant trading importance, are also considered as ''mancanegara''. Either the province has their own native rulers subject (vassal) to the king, or a regent appointed and sent by the king to rule the region. This realm includes [[Melayu Kingdom|Dharmasraya]], [[Pagaruyung Kingdom|Pagaruyung]], [[Lampung]] and [[Palembang]] in [[Sumatra]].\n* '''''Nusantara''''', areas which do not reflect Javanese culture, but are included as colonies and they had to pay annual tribute. They had their native polity intact, enjoyed substantial autonomy and internal freedom, and Majapahit did not necessarily station their officials or military officers here; however, any challenges on Majapahit oversight might draw severe response. These areas such as the vassal kingdoms and colonies in [[Malay peninsula]], [[Borneo]], [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], [[Sulawesi]] and [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]].\n[[File:Filippine, provincia di agusan, immagine hindu, statuetta in oro massiccio, xiii secolo.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A 1.79 kilogram, 21-karat Majapahit period [[Golden Tara|gold image]] discovered in [[Esperanza, Agusan|Agusan]], [[Philippines]], copied Nganjuk bronze images of the early Majapahit period,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcollections.universiteitleiden.nl/view/item/7096|title=[Bronze statues from Nganjuk] OD-3577 {{!}} Digital Collections|website=digitalcollections.universiteitleiden.nl|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> signify Majapahit cultural influence on southern Philippines.]]\n\n[[Nagarakretagama#Descriptions of the Majapahit realm|Nagarakretagama]] mentioned more than 80 places in the archipelago described as the vassal states.<ref name=\"Britannica-Majapahit\"/> In Canto 13, several lands on [[Sumatra]] are mentioned, and some possibly correspond to contemporary areas: [[Jambi]], [[Palembang]], Teba ([[Toba Samosir Regency|Toba]]), and [[Dharmasraya]].

Since early of its formation, Majapahit inherited the foreign outlook of its predecessor entity \u2013 [[Singhasari]] kingdom, in which its last king [[Kertanegara]] projected his influence abroad by launching [[Pamalayu]] expedition (1275-1293) to incorporate Malay polities in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula within Javanese sphere of influence. Previously, Singhasari seeks to dominate trade route, especially Malacca strait, and also saw the outreach of Mongolian-Chinese Yuan influence into Southeast Asia as the threat to their own interest.\n\nDuring its formation, the returning Pamalayu expedition in 1293 has brought Malayu Kingdoms in Jambi and Dharmasraya under Javanese suzerainty. Therefore, Java often consider itself as the overlord of most of polities in the Indonesian archipelago. In Sumatran front, Majapahit did capture Palembang, Jambi and Dharmasraya, invade [[Samudera Pasai Sultanate|Pasai]], and it also saw the settlement of [[Temasek|Tumasik]], that later become [[Kingdom of Singapura]], as its rebellious colony, and thus deal with them accordingly.\n\nDuring the reign of Majapahit's first two monarch \u2013 Wijaya and Jayanegara, the kingdom struggled to consolidate its rule, plagued by a number of rebellions. However, it was not until the reign of its third monarch \u2013 Queen Tribhuwana Tunggadewi, and her son, Hayam Wuruk \u2013 that the kingdom began to projected its power overseas. Majapahit's confidence for dominance was stemmed for their economic and demographic comparative advantage; agrarian as well as maritime nation; their large rice production, immense human resources, well-organized society, also their mastery in shipbuilding, navigation and military technology; are excellent relatively compared to their neighbours. These strengths were used by Gajah Mada to expand the kingdom's influence and building a maritime empire. This rather imperialistic outlooks, has projected in the way he forcefully dealt with Majapahit's neighbours; the Pabali (conquest of Bali, 1342\u20131343) and the [[Battle of Bubat|Pasunda Bubat]] (1356). Majapahit pulled Bali into their orbit as a vassal state. While the disastrous diplomacy with Sunda kingdom has led to the enmity among them.\n\nWithin Indonesian archipelago, Majapahit saw itself as the center of a huge mandala. This notion is demonstrated by its three tier administrative hierarchy; Nagara Agung, Mancanegara, and Nusantara. Outside of Maritime Southeast Asia, Majapahit devices Mitreka Satata, or partner in common order, in which it saw several states as ally. They are [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]], [[Nakhon Si Thammarat kingdom]], [[Ratchaburi]], [[Songkla]], [[Mottama]], [[Champa]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Vietnam|Annam]].\n\n[[File:Bhairava Adityavarman.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Adityawarman depicted as Bhairava]]\nMajapahit overlordship upon Malay states of Sumatra was demonstrated by the rule of [[Adityawarman]] of Malayupura. Adityawarman, the cousin of King Jayanegara, was raised within Majapahit palace and rose to become Senior Minister in Majapahit court. He was sent to led Majapahit military expansion to conquer east coast region in Sumatra. Adityawarman then founded the royal dynasty of [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] in [[Pagarruyung]] and presided over the central Sumatra region to take control of the gold trade between 1347 and 1375.\n\nIn later years after the era of Hayam Wuruk, Majapahit has lost their grips on some of their overseas possessions. This led to the thrive and the rise of several polities previously held under Majapahit domination, such as [[Bruneian Empire|Brunei]] and [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]]. The rise of Malacca in 15th century in particular is important, because it represents Majapahit eventual failure to control Malacca strait. Previously Majapahit tried to contain the rise of a potential regional rival; a Malay polity in par with Srivijaya, by punishing a rebellion in Palembang and capturing Singapura. In this sense, Malacca was indeed the rival of Majapahit in the competition to dominate the archipelagic realm. Despite this perceived rivalry, in practice however, the two kingdoms actually had some close and intense economic and cultural relations. At that time, the trade link between Majapahit ports of Hujung Galuh and Tuban with port of Melaka must be thriving.\n\nMajapahit true rival for domination however, was the powerful [[Ming Dynasty|Ming Chinese]]. After the fall of Yuan, the Ming Emperor eager to project his power into Southeast Asia. On the other hand Majapahit saw this archipelagic realm as theirs and unwelcome to any perceived Chinese interference. After Majapahit was weaken by Paregreg civil war, and incessant conflicts among its nobles, the arrival of the formidable [[Ming treasure voyages]] led by [[Zheng He]] upon Majapahit shores has pushed Majapahit prestigue and power to the side. Ming on the other hand, actively support the rise of Malacca. This Ming protection has made Majapahit unwilling and unable to push Malacca anymore. \n\nMajapahit ultimate nemesis however, was located very close at home; the [[Demak Sultanate]] on northern coast of Central Java. Ming support to Malacca, and Malacca active proselytizing of Islam, has led to the thrive and rise of Muslim traders community in the archipelago, including in Majapahit ports on the north coast of Java. This in turn gradually corroded the prestigue of Javanese Hindu-Buddhist kingship, and after several generations, led to the fall of once mighty Majapahit empire.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Pura Maospahit Denpasar Bali.jpg|thumb|right|''Pura Maospahit'' (\"Majapahit Temple\") in [[Denpasar]], Bali, demonstrate the typical Majapahit red brick architecture.]]\n\nMajapahit was the largest empire ever to form in Southeast Asia.<ref name=miksic />{{rp|page=107}} Although its political power beyond the core area in east Java was diffuse, constituting mainly ceremonial recognition of suzerainty, Majapahit society developed a high degree of sophistication in both commercial and artistic activities. Its capital was inhabited by a cosmopolitan population among whom literature and art flourished.<ref name=miksic />{{rp|page=107}}\n\nNumbers of local legends and [[folklore]]s in the region had mentioned about the Majapahit kingdom. Other than Javanese sources, some regional legends mentioning Majapahit kingdom or its general Gajah Mada, also can be found; from Aceh, Minangkabau, Palembang, Malay Peninsula, Sunda, Brunei, Bali to Sumbawa. Most of them mentioned about the incoming Javanese forces to their land, which was probably a local testament of the empire's expansive nature that once dominating the archipelago. The [[Hikayat Raja-raja Pasai|Hikayat Raja Pasai]], a 14th-century [[Aceh]] chronicle tell a Majapahit naval invasion against [[Samudra Pasai]] in 1350. The chronicle described that the Majapahit invasion was a punishment for Sultan Ahmad Malik Az-Zahir's crime on ruining a royal marriage between Pasai Prince Tun Abdul Jalil and Raden Galuh Gemerencang, a Majapahit princess \u2013 that led to the death of the royal couple.<ref name=\"Tirto-Pasai\"/> \n[[File:Masjid Menara Kudus.jpg|thumb|left|The Majapahit style minaret of Kudus Mosque.]]\nIn West Sumatra, the [[Minangkabau (legend)|legend of Minangkabau]] mentioned an invading foreign prince \u2013 associated with Javanese Majapahit kingdom \u2013 being defeated in a buffalo fight.<ref name=\"Sindo-Minangkabau\"/> In West Java, the [[Battle of Bubat|Pasunda Bubat]] tragedy caused a myth to revolve around Indonesians, which forbids marriage between a [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] and a [[Javanese people|Javanese]], as it would be unsustainable and only bring misery to the couple.<ref>{{cite news | title = Tragedi Perang Bubat dan mitos orang jawa dilarang kawin dengan sunda | date = 24 April 2015 | author = Hery H Winarno | url = https://www.merdeka.com/peristiwa/tragedi-perang-bubat-mitos-orang-jawa-dilarang-kawin-dengan-sunda.html | language = Indonesian}}</ref> In Malay peninsula, the [[Malay annals]] mentioned the legend of the fall of [[Kingdom of Singapura|Singapura]] to Majapahit forces in 1398 was due to the betrayal of Sang Rajuna Tapa that opened the fortified city gate.<ref>{{harvnb|A.

The [[Panji (prince)|Panji cycles]], the tale of [[Sri Tanjung]], and the epic of [[Damarwulan]], are popular tales in Javanese and [[Balinese literature]]s. The tales of Panji was dated from older period during Kediri kingdom, while the tale of Sri Tanjung and the epic of Damarwulan took place during Majapahit period. These tales remained a popular theme in Javanese culture of later period during Mataram Sultanate, and often became the source of inspiration for [[wayang]] shadow puppet performance, [[ketoprak]] and [[topeng]] dance drama. The Panji tales in particular have spread from East Java to become a source of inspiration for literature and dance drama throughout the region, as far as Malay peninsula, Cambodia and Siam where he is known as Raden Inao or Enau ({{lang-th|\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e32}}) of Kurepan.{{Sfn|Holt|1967|p=274}}\n\nMajapahit had a momentous and lasting influence on [[Indonesian art]] and [[Indonesian architecture|architecture]]. The empire's expansion circa 14th-century, contributed to the difussion Javanese cultural influence throughout the archipelago, which can be seen as a form of [[Javanisation]]. It was probably during this period that some of Javanese cultural elements, such as [[gamelan]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/history-of-gamelan-195131|title=Learn the History Behind Gamelan, Indonesian Music and Dance|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=13 November 2018}}</ref> and kris, being expanded and introduced to islands outside of Java. The descriptions of the architecture of the capital's pavilions (''[[pendopo]]'') in the ''Nagarakretagama'' evoke the Javanese [[Kraton (Indonesia)|Kraton]] also the [[Pura (Balinese temple)|Balinese temples]] and palace compounds of today. The Majapahit architectural style that often employs [[Majapahit Terracotta|terracotta]] and [[red brick]] heavily influenced the architecture of Java and Bali in the later period. The Majapahit style ''[[candi bentar]]'' split gate, the ''kori'' or ''[[paduraksa]]'' towering red brick gate, and also ''pendopo'' pavilion have become ubiquitous in Javanese and Balinese architectural features, as seen in [[Menara Kudus Mosque]], [[Keraton Kasepuhan]] and Sunyaragi park in [[Cirebon]], [[Mataram Sultanate]] royal cemetery in [[Kota Gede]], [[Yogyakarta]], and various palaces and temples in Bali.<ref name=\"Made Wijaya\"/>\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Bas-reli\u00ebfs op het Pendopo Terras Panataran tempelcomplex TMnr 20027152.jpg|thumb|right|Bas relief from [[Candi Penataran]] describes the Javanese-style [[pendopo]] pavilion, commonly found across Java and Bali.]]\n\nThe vivid, rich and festive [[Balinese people#Culture|Balinese culture]] is considered as one of Majapahit legacy. The Javanese Hindu civilisation since the era of [[Airlangga]] to the era of Majapahit kings has profoundly influenced and shaped the Balinese culture and [[History of Bali|history]].<ref>[http://www.lonelyplanet.com/indonesia/bali/history Lonely Planet: History of Bali]</ref> The ancient links and Majapahit legacy is observable in many ways; architecture, literature, religious rituals, dance-drama and artforms. The aesthetics and style of bas-reliefs in Majapahit East Javanese temples were preserved and copied in Balinese temples. It is also due to the fact that after the fall of the empire, many Majapahit nobles, artisans and priests had taken refuge either in the interior mountainous region of East Java or across the narrow strait to Bali. Indeed, in some ways the [[Bali Kingdom|Kingdom of Bali]] was the successor of Majapahit. Large numbers of Majapahit manuscripts, such as [[Nagarakretagama]], [[Kakawin Sutasoma|Sutasoma]], [[Pararaton]] and [[Tantu Pagelaran]], were being well-kept in royal libraries of Bali and Lombok, and provides the glimpse and valuable historical records on Majapahit. The Majapahit Hindu-Javanese culture has shaped the culture of Bali, that led to popular expression; \"without Java there is no Bali\". Yet in return, Bali is credited as the last stronghold to safeguard and preserve the ancient Hindu Javanese civilisation.\n\n[[File:WLANL - mchangsp - Kris van Knaud.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Kris of Knaud]], one of the oldest surviving kris is dated to Majapahit period]]\n\nIn weaponry, the Majapahit expansion is believed to be responsible for the widespread use of the [[Kris|keris]] dagger in Southeast Asia; from Java, Bali, Sumatra, Malaysia, Brunei to Southern Thailand. Although it has been suggested that the keris, and native daggers similar to it, predate Majapahit, nevertheless the empire expansion contributed to its popularity and diffusion in the region around the year 1492.<ref name=\"JPostKris\">{{cite news|title=Kris, more than just a simple dagger |author=Tantri Yuliandini |date=18 April 2002 |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2002/04/18/kris-more-just-a-simple-dagger.html |accessdate=30 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729203644/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2002/04/18/kris-more-just-a-simple-dagger.html |archivedate=29 July 2014 }}</ref> For example, [[Kris of Knaud]], one of the oldest surviving kris is dated to 1264 Saka (which correspondends to 1342). The Malay legend of Kris [[Taming Sari]] is also attributed to Majapahit origin.\n\nFor Indonesians in later centuries, Majapahit became a symbol of past greatness.

The Indonesian Navy flag of red and white stripes also has a Majapahit origin.

The history of Majapahit continues to inspire contemporary artists.]]\nCelebrated as 'the golden era of the archipelago', the Majapahit empire has inspired many writers and artists (and continues to do so) to create their works based on this era, or to describe and mention it. The impact of the Majapahit theme on popular culture can be seen in the following:\n\n# ''Sandyakalaning Majapahit'' (1933), or Twilight/Sunset in Majapahit is an historical romance that took place during the fall of Majapahit empire, written by [[Sanusi Pane]].\n# ''Panji Koming'' (since 1979), a weekly [[comic strip]] by Dwi Koendoro published in the Sunday edition of [[Kompas]], telling the everyday life of Panji Koming, a common Majapahit citizen. Although it took place in the Majapahit era, the comic strip serves as witty [[satire]] and [[criticism]] of modern Indonesian society. From a political, social, cultural and current point of view, Indonesia is described as the '[[reincarnation]]' of the Majapahit empire. The current Indonesian president is often portrayed as a Majapahit monarch or prime minister.\n# ''Saur Sepuh'' (1987\u20131991), a radio drama and film by Niki Kosasih. Begun as a popular radio drama program in the late 1980s, Saur Sepuh is based on 15th-century Java, centred around the story about a fictional hero named Brama Kumbara, the king of Madangkara, a fictional kingdom neighbour of the [[Kingdom of Sunda|Pajajaran]]. In several stories the Paregreg war is described, that is to say the civil war of Majapahit between Wikramawardhana and Bhre Wirabhumi. This part has been made into a single feature film entitled 'Saur Sepuh' as well.\n# ''Tutur Tinular'', a radio drama and film by S Tidjab. Tutur Tinular is a [[martial art]] historical epic fictional story with the Majapahit era serving as the background of the story. The story also involved a romance between the hero named Arya Kamandanu and his Chinese lover Mei Shin.\n# ''Wali Songo'', the film tells the story of nine [[Muslim]] saints ('wali') who spread [[Islam]] to Java. The story took place near the end of the Majapahit era and the formation of [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]]. It describes the decaying Majapahit empire where royals are fighting each other for power while the commoners suffer.\n# ''Senopati Pamungkas'' (1986, reprinted in 2003), a martial art-historical epic novel by Arswendo Atmowiloto. It takes place in the late Singhasari period and formation of Majapahit. This novel describes the sagas, royal intrigues, and romance of the formation of the kingdom as well as the adventure of the main character, a commoner named Upasara Wulung and his forbidden love affair with princess Gayatri Rajapatni, whom later becomes the consort of [[Raden Wijaya]], the first king of Majapahit.\n#  ''Imperium Majapahit'', a comic book series by Jan Mintaraga, published by Elexmedia Komputindo. This series tells the history of Majapahit from its formation until the decline.\n# ''[[Puteri Gunung Ledang (film)|Puteri Gunung Ledang]]'' (2004), a [[Malaysia]]n epic film based on [[Legend of Puteri Gunung Ledang|a traditional Malay legend]]. This film recounts the love story between Gusti Putri Retno Dumilah, a Majapahit princess, and [[Hang Tuah]], a [[Malaccan Sultanate|Malaccan]] admiral.\n# ''[[Gajah Mada (book)|Gajah Mada]]'', a [[pentalogy]] written by [[Langit Kresna Hariadi]] depicting a fictionalised detail of [[Gajah Mada]]'s life from the [[Gajah Mada#Rise to Mahapatih|Kuti rebellion]] up to the [[Gajah Mada#The Bubat Accident|Bubat War]].\n# ''[[Dyah Pitaloka]]'' (2007), a novel written by Hermawan Aksan, fictionalising the detailed life story of Sundanese princess [[Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi]] set around the [[Gajah Mada#The Bubat Accident|Bubat War]]. The novel virtually takes the same context and was inspired by the [[Kidung Sundayana]].\n# ''Jung Jawa'' (2009), an anthology of short stories written by Rendra Fatrisna Kurniawan, imagining the life of the Nusantara people, published by Babel Publishing.\n# ''[[Civilization 5: Brave New World]] (2013)'', where [[Gajah Mada]] appeared as one of the leaders of a great civilisation in the second expansion of the [[Civilization 5]] game. He is the leader of the Indonesian civilisation, with the emblem of the Indonesian empire being the [[Surya Majapahit]], although in the game the empire is known as the \"Indonesian empire\" instead.\n# Later, in [[Civilization VI|''Civilization 6 (2016),'']] ''a'' downloadable content has one of its rulers, [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi|Dyah Gitarja]] (referred as Gitarja in-game) as the leader of the Indonesian civilization, with the emblem being a simpler version of the Surya Majapahit. The unique unit of Indonesian civilization is the ''jong''.\n# On the ''Rise of the Rajas'' expansion pack from ''[[Age of Empires II]]'', [[Gajah Mada]] appears in a campaign detailing his rise and then fall after the Pasunda Bubat tragedy.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Indonesia}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Gosari inscription]]\n* [[Kidung Sunda]]\n* [[List of monarchs of Java]]\n* [[Osing people|Osing]]\n* [[Srivijaya]]\n* [[Tenggerese people|Tenggerese]]\n* [[Hinduism in Indonesia]]\n{{col div end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist | group=lower-roman | close}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=miksic>{{Cite book\n| isbn      = 9813018267\n| series    = Indonesian Heritage Series\n| title     = Ancient History\n| publisher = Archipelago Press / Editions Didier Millet\n| year      = 1999\n| editor    = John Miksic\n| volume    = Vol 1\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=ricklefs>{{Cite book\n| isbn      = 9780804721950\n| last      = Ricklefs\n| first     = Merle Calvin\n| title     = A history of modern Indonesia since c. 1300\n| year      = 1993\n| publisher = Stanford University Press / Macmillans\n| edition   = 2nd\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=yingyai>{{Cite book\n| isbn      = 9780521010320\n| author    = Ma Huan\n| title     = [[Yingya Shenglan|Ying-yai Sheng-lan]] (\u701b\u6daf\u80dc\u89c8) The Overall Survey of the Ocean's Shores\n| others    = translated by J.V.G Mills\n| language  = Chinese\n| origyear  = 1433\n| year      = 1970\n| publisher = Cambridge University Press\n| series    = [[Hakluyt Society]]\n}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Majapahit}}\n{{div col}}\n* [http://www.eastjava.com/books/trowulan/history/history.html A Short History of Majapahit]\n* [http://www.eastjava.com/books/majapahit/ Memoirs of Majapahit Kingdom]\n* [http://users.skynet.be/network.indonesia/ni4001c6.htm A brief history of Majapahit]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120125090000/http://sejarahnasional.org/index.php/kerajaan-nusantara/1-terjemahan-manuskrip-nagarakertagama A Complete Transcription of Majapahit Royal Manuscript of Nagarakertagama from SejarahNasional.org an National History Website]\n{{col div end}}\n\n{{Precolonial states in Indonesia}}\n{{Asia in topic|Hinduism in}}\n{{Empires}}\n{{Coord missing|Indonesia}}\n\n[[Category:1527 disestablishments in Asia]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1293]]\n[[Category:States and territories disestablished in 1527]]\n[[Category:Historical Hindu empires]]\n[[Category:Precolonial states of Indonesia]]\n[[Category:1293 establishments in Asia]]\n[[Category:Former countries in Malaysian history]]\n[[Category:Majapahit]]\n[[Category:Former empires in Asia]]\n[[Category:Former countries in Indonesian history]]\n[[Category:Hindu Buddhist states in Indonesia]]\n[[Category:Island countries]]\n[[Category:Indianized kingdoms]]\n", "name_user": "Gunkarta", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRelations with regional powers", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majapahit"}

An aging [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]]'s healing ability is failing. Working as a limo driver in [[El Paso, Texas]], he and mutant tracker [[Caliban (Marvel Comics)|Caliban]] care for 90-year-old [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], Logan's mentor and founder of the [[X-Men]], in an abandoned [[Smelting|smelting plant]] in northern Mexico. Xavier has developed [[dementia]] that causes him to have destructive seizures; it is alluded that one year prior, one such seizure released a powerful wave of his telepathic powers that resulted in the deaths of six hundred people, including several of the X-Men.\n\nLogan reluctantly agrees to escort Gabriela Lopez, a former nurse for biotechnology corporation Alkali-Transigen, and a young girl, [[X-23|Laura]], to Eden, a refuge in [[North Dakota]]. Later finding Gabriela dead, Logan is confronted at his Mexican hideout by her killer [[Donald Pierce]], who is Transigen's [[cyborg]] chief of security. Pierce is looking for Laura, who has stowed away in Logan's limo and has similar powers to him. She, Logan, and Xavier escape Pierce and his [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]], but Caliban is tortured into tracking Laura.\n\nA video on Gabriela's cellphone shows that Transigen created Laura and other children from mutant DNA to become weapons; Laura was created from Logan's DNA. As they proved difficult to control and Transigen found an alternative, the children were to be killed, but Gabriela and other nurses helped some escape. In [[Oklahoma City]], Logan discovers that Eden appears in Laura's X-Men comic and tells her it is fictional. The Reavers arrive, but Xavier has a seizure and incapacitates everyone except Logan and Laura, who kill the attackers and inject Xavier with his medication. As they flee, [[List of Marvel Comics characters: R#Zander Rice|Dr. Zander Rice]], head of Transigen, arrives to help Pierce.\n\nLogan, Laura, and Xavier help farmer Will Munson and his family after a traffic incident, accepting an offer of dinner at their home, where Logan drives off enforcers from a corporate farm. Rice unleashes X-24, a clone of Logan in his prime and his alternative to the child program, who murders Will's family and Xavier, stabbing Will and capturing Laura. Caliban sets off grenades, killing himself and several Reavers while injuring Pierce. Logan is outmatched by X-24, but Will pins X-24 with his truck before dying from his injuries. Logan and Laura escape with Xavier's body.\n\nAfter burying Xavier, Logan passes out. Laura takes him to a doctor and persuades him to prove that the site in North Dakota is not Eden. There, they find [[Rictor]] and other Transigen children preparing to cross into Canada. Laura finds an adamantium bullet that Logan has kept since his escape from the [[Weapon X]] facility, which he once considered using to commit suicide. Logan decides that his job is done and chooses not to accompany them, to Laura's dismay.\n\nWhen the Reavers capture the children, Logan takes an overdose of a serum given to him by Rictor that temporarily enhances his healing abilities and boosts his strength. With Laura's help, he slaughters most of the Reavers before the serum wears off. As Pierce holds Rictor at gunpoint, Rice tells Logan, who killed Rice's father years ago at the Weapon X facility, that no new mutants have been born due to genetically engineered crops created by Transigen and distributed through the world's food supply. Logan, having found a gun, shoots Rice and injures Pierce. X-24, enraged by Rice's death, fights Logan, as the children combine their powers to kill Pierce and the remaining Reavers. Rictor uses his powers to flip a truck onto X-24, but he frees himself and impales Logan on a large tree branch. Laura uses Logan's revolver and adamantium bullet to shoot X-24 in the head.\n\nNear death, Logan tells Laura not to become the weapon that she was made to be, and after she tearfully acknowledges him as her father, he dies peacefully in her arms. Laura and the children bury Logan, and Laura turns his grave marker on its side to create an X, honoring him as a member of the X-Men before she and the children depart for the Canadian border.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:World Premiere Logan Berlinale 2017.jpg|thumb|upright|Portraying the character for 17 years in nine films earned Jackman the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] of the \"longest career as a live-action Marvel superhero\".]]\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as [[Wolverine (character)|Logan / Wolverine]]:\n:The X-Man formerly-known as the Wolverine and a physically [[adamantium|enhanced]] mutant with accelerated healing, dealing with his age and ailment as well as Charles Xavier's former pupil, and Laura's biological father.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/10/19/13332326/wolverine-logan-hugh-jackman|title=Wolverine looks old and tired in this first look from Logan|last=Alexander|first=Julia|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=October 19, 2016|accessdate=October 30, 2016}}</ref><ref name=Empire>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/logan-trailer-breakdown-james-mangold-talks-us-first-teaser/|title='Logan': Wolverine 3 Key Roles Revealed (Exclusive)|last=O'Hara|first=Helen|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|date=October 20, 2016|accessdate=October 30, 2016}}</ref> He is one of Charles Xavier's caregivers, alongside Caliban.<ref name=Details/> Mangold spoke of Logan's age influencing his regenerative capabilities, which he stated may no longer produce soft skin, \"so we imagined he heals quickly, still, but it leaves a scar.

As a result, the comic book covers and pages seen in the film were made specifically for it, by writer [[Joe Quesada]] and artist [[Dan Panosian]].

AS HAS BEEN SAID ***MULTIPLE TIMES*** PEAK POSITION IS TO BE MAINTAINED IN THESE ARTICLES. --> of all time.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2029, no [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] have been born in 25 years. An aging [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]]'s healing ability is failing. Working as a limo driver in [[El Paso, Texas]], he and mutant tracker [[Caliban (Marvel Comics)|Caliban]] care for 90-year-old [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], Logan's mentor and founder of the [[X-Men]], in an abandoned [[Smelting|smelting plant]] in northern Mexico. Xavier has developed [[dementia]] that causes him to have destructive seizures; it is alluded that one year prior, one such seizure released a powerful wave of his telepathic powers that resulted in the deaths of six hundred people, including several of the X-Men.\n\nLogan reluctantly agrees to escort Gabriela Lopez, a former nurse for biotechnology corporation Alkali-Transigen, and a young girl, [[X-23|Laura]], to Eden, a refuge in [[North Dakota]]. Later finding Gabriela dead, Logan is confronted at his Mexican hideout by her killer [[Donald Pierce]], who is Transigen's [[cyborg]] chief of security. Pierce is looking for Laura, who has stowed away in Logan's limo and has similar powers to him. She, Logan, and Xavier escape Pierce and his [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]], but Caliban is tortured into tracking Laura.\n\nA video on Gabriela's cellphone shows that Transigen created Laura and other children from mutant DNA to become weapons; Laura was created from Logan's DNA. As they proved difficult to control and Transigen found an alternative, the children were to be killed, but Gabriela and other nurses helped some escape. In [[Oklahoma City]], Logan discovers that Eden appears in Laura's X-Men comic and tells her it is fictional. The Reavers arrive, but Xavier has a seizure and incapacitates everyone except Logan and Laura, who kill the attackers and inject Xavier with his medication. As they flee, [[List of Marvel Comics characters: R#Zander Rice|Dr. Zander Rice]], head of Transigen, arrives to help Pierce.\n\nLogan, Laura, and Xavier help farmer Will Munson and his family after a traffic incident, accepting an offer of dinner at their home, where Logan drives off enforcers from a corporate farm. Rice unleashes X-24, a clone of Logan in his prime and his alternative to the child program, who murders Will's family and Xavier, stabbing Will and capturing Laura. Caliban sets off grenades, killing himself and several Reavers while injuring Pierce. Logan is outmatched by X-24, but Will pins X-24 with his truck before dying from his injuries. Logan and Laura escape with Xavier's body.\n\nAfter burying Xavier, Logan passes out. Laura takes him to a doctor and persuades him to prove that the site in North Dakota is not Eden. There, they find [[Rictor]] and other Transigen children preparing to cross into Canada. Laura finds an adamantium bullet that Logan has kept since his escape from the [[Weapon X]] facility, which he once considered using to commit suicide. Logan decides that his job is done and chooses not to accompany them, to Laura's dismay.\n\nWhen the Reavers capture the children, Logan takes an overdose of a serum given to him by Rictor that temporarily enhances his healing abilities and boosts his strength. With Laura's help, he slaughters most of the Reavers before the serum wears off. As Pierce holds Rictor at gunpoint, Rice tells Logan, who killed Rice's father years ago at the Weapon X facility, that no new mutants have been born due to genetically engineered crops created by Transigen and distributed through the world's food supply. Logan, having found a gun, shoots Rice and injures Pierce. X-24, enraged by Rice's death, fights Logan, as the children combine their powers to kill Pierce and the remaining Reavers. Rictor uses his powers to flip a truck onto X-24, but he frees himself and impales Logan on a large tree branch.

As a result, the comic book covers and pages seen in the film were made specifically for it, by writer [[Joe Quesada]] and artist [[Dan Panosian]]. Mangold commented that \"The reality was that, like in Unforgiven, when [Clint] Eastwood runs into Richard Harris, who\u2019s writing these fictional accounts of the great Western heroes, or Pat Garrett in Billy the Kid, where you\u2019ve got these aging heroes who kind of are twilight versions of their own legends \u2014 I think that idea, of being a kind of celebrity, or like a sports star long past your heyday, was really interesting for me to investigate with this kind of world.\"<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.slashfilm.com/interview-logan-director-james-mangold/|title= Interview: 'Logan' Director James Mangold on His Influences, PG-13 Violence, and the Political Relevance of the X-Men|author= Angie Han|date= February 16, 2017|publisher= Slash Film|accessdate=July 30, 2019}}</ref> Panosian made 10 fake comic book covers, and interior arts were unused.

A fourth passage, Jude 1:7, is often interpreted as referring to homosexuality.

The phrase \"passions of dishonor\" (KJV: \"vile affections\") translates {{lang|grc| \u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7 \u1f00\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03af\u03b1\u03c2}},\n{{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03af\u03b1}} ''atimia'' meaning \"dishonour, ignominy, disgrace\".\nIn the expressions \"natural use\" and \"contrary to nature\", \"nature\" translates \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, i.e. ''[[Physis]]''.

Calvin Porter, for example, concludes that \"in 2:1-16, as well as through Romans as a whole, Paul, as part of his Gentile mission, challenges, argues against, and refutes both the content of the discourse [of 1.18-32] and the practice of using such discourses.

A more conservative biblical interpretation contends \"the most authentic reading of Rom 1:26-7 is that which sees it prohibiting homosexual activity in the most general of terms, rather than in respect of more culturally and historically specific forms of such activity\".<ref name=\"hilborn\" /><ref>Howard, K.

Deerfield, Illinois.</ref>\n\nSeveral early church writers{{who|date=April 2019}} state that Rom 1:26b is a condemnation of men having unnatural sex with women. Underlying Paul's thinking is Genesis 2:22-24, \"The Lord God then built the rib that he had taken from the man into a woman. When he brought her to the man, the man said: \u201cThis one, at last, is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; ...That is why a man leaves his father and mother and clings to his wife, and the two of them become one body.\" For Paul, God's intended order is for male and female sexual relationships, united in marriage. That is what he saw as natural, and therefore same sex relationships were unnatural. In 1 Romans, Paul is giving examples of what happens when people abandon God's plan.<ref>[https://www.seminary.edu/abandoning-gods-way-for-human-relationships-romans-126-27/ \"Abandoning God's Way for Human Relationships -Romans 1: 26-27\", Northern (Baptist) Seminary]</ref>\n\nThe passage has been described by David Hilborn of the [[Evangelical Alliance]] as \"the most important biblical reference for the homosexuality debate\".<ref name=\"hilborn\">Hilborn, D.

The implication is that the goddess religions, the castrated priests and temple prostitution had a wide impact in ancient Mediterranean culture (similar to the devadasi system in India today) so would immediately evoke an image for the 1st-century audience of non-Yahwistic religious idolatry, practices not familiar to the modern reader, which makes it easy to misinterpret these verses. On the other hand, Brooten notes that Clement of Alexandria likely interpreted Rom 1:27 as a condemnation of lesbians.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Brooten |first=Bernadette J. |date=1985 |title=Patristic Interpretations of Romans 1:26 |url=http://people.brandeis.edu/~brooten/Articles/Patrisitc_Interpretations_of_Romans_1_26.pdf |journal=Studia Patristica |volume=18.1 |pages=287\u2013288 |via= }}</ref> Mona West ({{year needed|date=December 2017}}) argues that Paul is condemning specific types of homosexual activity (such as [[temple prostitution]] or [[pederasty]]) rather than a broader interpretation.

Paul's use of the word in 1 Corinthians is the earliest example of the term; its only other usage is in a similar list of wrongdoers given (possibly by the same author) in 1 Timothy 1:8\u201311.

Do not ye err; neither lechers, neither men that serve maumets [neither men serving to idols], neither adulterers, neither lechers against kind, neither they that do lechery with men\"\n-->\n\nThese verses are a continuation of Pauls' berating the Christians at Corinth for suing one another before pagan judges in Roman courts, which he sees as an infringement upon the holiness of the Christian community.

So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.\" (Matthew 19:4-6, NRSV translation; Mark 10:6-9 is a parallel text)</blockquote>Rob Gagnon, an associate professor of New Testament studies, argues it is \"obvious\" that Jesus' back-to-back references to Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 show that he \"presupposed a two-sex requirement for marriage\" even though the question he was being asked was about a contemporary dispute about whether married couples could divorce.<ref>Robert A. J. Gagnon, \"Why the Disagreement over the Biblical Witness on Homosexual Practice?: A Response to David G. Myers and Letha Dawson Scanzoni, What God Has Joined Together?\" Reformed Review 59.1 (Autumn 2005): 19-130, 56. Available online at http://www.robgagnon.net/articles/ReformedReviewArticleWhyTheDisagreement.pdf</ref>\n\nLeroy Huizenga, a Catholic theology professor, acknowledges the question's origin in a dispute between rabbis as to whether divorce was permissible for adultery, for \"many\" reasons, or for \"any reason, including 'even if he find one fairer than she'\", and claims Jesus' reply as meaning that Genesis trumps Moses allowing divorce in Deuteronomy. Huizenga argues that Jesus' reference to Genesis is \"likely\" to include the command in Genesis 1:28 to \"Be fruitful and multiply\". Thus for him, Jesus is affirming that marriage is a union meant to be fruitful, ideally to result in children. Huizenga says Jesus' teaching about marriage here does modify the position held by his Jewish contemporaries, but in drawing on the creation accounts it is \"more radical and less permissive\".<ref>{{cite web |author=Dr. Leroy Huizenga |url=http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Item/2381/jesus_marriage_and_homosexuality.aspx#.UssPNvRDt8E |title=Jesus, Marriage, and Homosexuality \u2013 Catholic World Report |publisher=Catholicworldreport.com |date= |accessdate=2018-04-19}}</ref>\n\nInterestingly, still in response to the question in Matthew 19:3, Jesus speaks further and discusses a class he calls 'eunuchs', which would seem to be a reference to something more than  simply those who have (had) removed their testicles or external genitalia or been born without such:<blockquote>But he said to them, \u201cNot everyone can accept this teaching, but only those to whom it is given. For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.

For example, Scobie states that \"there is no evidence that the term was restricted to pederasty; beyond doubt, the NT here repeats the Leviticus condemnation of all same-sex relations\".<ref name=\"scobie\">Scobie, C.H.H. (2003) ''The Ways of Our God: An approach to Biblical Theology''. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co. ([https://books.google.com/books?id=rNZ_9huzTvIC Google eBook])</ref> Similarly, Campbell writes, \"it must be pointed out, first, that ''arsenokoit\u0113s'' is a broad term that cannot be confined to specific instances of homosexual activity such as male prostitution or pederasty. This is in keeping with the term's Old Testament background where lying with a 'male' (a very general term) is proscribed, relating to every kind of male-male intercourse.\" Campbell (quoting from Wenham) goes on to say that, \"in fact, the Old Testament bans every type of homosexual intercourse, not just male prostitution or intercourse with youths.\"<ref>Campbell, K.M. (2003) ''Marriage and Family in the Biblical World''. InterVarsity Press. ([https://books.google.com/books?id=WcyqvWfJnyYC Google eBook])</ref>\n\nOthers have pointed out that the meaning of ''arsenokoit\u0113s'' is identified by its derivation from the [[Septuagint|Greek translation of the Old Testament]], where the component words \"with a man (''arsenos'') do not copulate coitus (''koites'') as with a woman\" refer to homosexual conduct. For example, according to Hays, although the word ''arsenokoit\u0113s'' appears nowhere in Greek literature prior to Paul's use of it, it is evidently a rendering into Greek of the standard rabbinic term for \"one who lies with a male [as with a woman]\" (Lev. 18:22; 20:13). Moreover, despite recent challenges to this interpretation, the meaning is confirmed by the evidence of ''[[Sibylline oracles|Sybilline Oracles]]'' 2.73. Paul here repeats the standard Jewish condemnation of homosexual conduct.<ref>Hays, R.B. (2011)  Interpretation. A Bible Commentary for Teaching & Preaching. First Corinthians.

Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, p. 243</ref> According to Scroggs (''op cit''), the word ''malakos'' in Paul's list refers specifically to this category of person, the effeminate call-boy.<ref name=\"Scroggs\" /> Others, for example Olson,<ref>Olson, M. (1984) Untangling the Web: A Look at What Scripture Does and Does Not Say about Homosexual Behavior. ''The Other Side'', April, pp.24-29.</ref> based on previous and subsequent uses of the term, interprets ''malakos'' to mean an effeminate but not necessarily homosexual man. Olson argues that the \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03af in Paul's time, \"almost always referred in a negative, pejorative way to a widely despised group of people who functioned as effeminate 'call boys'.\"\n\n====Arguments for a reference to homosexual behaviour====\nLexical evidence from Greek texts indicates the word was used to refer to the passive partner in a male homosexual act. For example, Malick (''op cit'') writes that a significant expression of this usage is found in a letter<ref group=\"note\">\u201cDemophon to Ptolemaeus, greeting. Make every effort to send me the flute-player Peto\u00fcs with both the Phrygian flutes and the rest; and if any expense is necessary, pay it, and you shall recover it from me.

(1983) ''The Bible and Homosexuality, Part 2: Homosexuality in the New Testament''. Bibliotheca Sacra 140 (October\u2013December 1983): 351.</ref> Ukleja cites a number of classical Greek sources in support his assertion.<ref group=\"note\">In classical Greek, \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 was also used to refer to boys and men who allowed themselves to be used homosexually. It was also applied to a man taking the female or passive role in homosexuality. Dionysius of Halicarnassus, who wrote Roman Antiquities around 7 B.C., described Aristodemus of Cumae as \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 because he had been \u201ceffeminate\u201d (\u03b8\u03b7\u03bb\u03c5\u03b4\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2) as a child and had undergone the things associated with women. In classical literature the word \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 is sometimes applied to obviously gay persons. Lucian describes the blood of some priests he condemns for passive homosexual behavior as \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2. This cannot be dismissed as not indicating anything about the sexuality of the individuals in question. These were priests who spent their time seeking group sexual encounters. While there is some ambiguity with regard to \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2, it is not beyond reason to see the word representing the passive parties in homosexual intercourse. This is even more reasonable when it is in juxtaposition with \u1f00\u03c1\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 which does imply an active homosexual role. It is interesting that in Aristotle\u2019s Problems, a lengthy discussion of the origins of homosexual passivity, he employs the word \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2. In its general sense the word does mean \u201cunrestrained,\u201d but not without any particularly homosexual context (Ukleja, ''op cit'').</ref>\n\nThe meaning of the word is not confined to male prostitutes. According to Malick (''op cit''), when ''malakos'' is employed in reference to sexual relationships of men with men, it is not a technical term for male call-boys in a pederastic setting. The term may mean effeminate with respect to boys or men who take the role of a woman in homosexual relationships.<ref name=\"malick\" /> Nor is the meaning of the word confined to sexually exploited males.<ref group=\"note\">\u2018The terms malakoi and molles could be used broadly to refer to effeminate or unmanly men. But in specific contexts it could be used in ways similar to the more specific terms [[cinaedus|cinaedi]]  (lit., \u201cbutt-shakers\u201d) and pathici (\u201cthose who undergo [penetration]\u201d) to denote effeminate adult males who are biologically and/or psychologically disposed to desire penetration by men. For example, in Soranus\u2019s work On Chronic Diseases (early 2nd century A.D.) the section on men who desire to be penetrated (4.9.131-37) is entitled \u201cOn the molles or subacti (subjugated or penetrated partners, pathics) whom the Greeks call malthakoi.\u201d An Aristotelian text similarly refers to those who are anatomically inclined toward the receptive role as malakoi (Pseudo-Aristotle, Problems 4.26). Astrological texts that speak of males desirous of playing the penetrated female role also use the term malakoi (Ptolemy, Four Books 3.14 \u00a7172; Vettius Valens, Anthologies 2.37.54; 2.38.82; cf. Brooten, 126 n. 41, 260 n. 132). The complaint about such figures in the ancient world generally, and certainly by Philo, centers around their attempted erasure of the masculine stamp given them by God/nature, not their exploitation of others, age difference, or acts of prostitution.\u2019, Gagnon, \u2018Dale Martin and the Myth of Total Textual Indeterminacy\u2019 (2007); http://www.robgagnon.net/DaleMartinResponse.htm.</ref>\n\nStandard Greek lexicons and dictionaries understand this word as a reference to the passive partner in a male homosexual act.<ref group=\"note\">\u2018pert. to being passive in a same-sex relationship, effeminate esp. of catamites, of men and boys who are sodomized by other males in such a relationship, opp. \u1f00\u03c1\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 (Dionys.

For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual impurities, murders, thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.}}\n\nWhether these lists include homosexuality depends on the translation of ''porneia'' (sexual impurity). Translations of these passages generally translate ''porneia'' as fornication rather than sexual impurity (see [[Leviticus]]). Some{{who|date=September 2011}} interpret the translation of ''porneia'' more broadly, to encompass sexual immorality in general, though there is disagreement over whether such an interpretation is supported by the writings of the [[Church Fathers]].\n\n===Pais===\n{{further|Healing the centurion's servant}}\n[[File:JesusHealingCenturionServant.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Healing the Centurion's servant by [[Paolo Veronese]], 16th century.]]\nThis event is referred to in both Matthew 8:5-13 and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 7:1-10 and tells of Jesus healing a [[centurion]]'s servant. Luke 7:2 (TNIV) says: \"There a centurion's servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die.\" The term translated from the Greek as \"servant\" in this verse is ''doulos''. Elsewhere in the two accounts, the term used for the ill person is ''pais'', a term that can be translated in a number of different ways including \"child\" (e.g., Matthew 2:16; Lk 2:43, 8:51-54 where it refers to a girl), \"son\" (John 4:51) or \"servant\" (Lk 15:26, Acts 4:25); elsewhere it is unclear whether \"son\" or \"servant\" is meant (Acts 3:13, 3:26, 4:27, 4:30).\n\nHorner<ref>Horner, T.

Helminiak argues that this is implied by the broader context of the narrative suggesting an unusual level of concern about the servant, whereas Horner suggests that use of the term \"valued highly\" implies a sexual relationship. Horner goes on to argue that, as Jesus commended the centurion for his faith (Matthew 8:10; Luke 7:9), it shows that Jesus approved of their relationship, otherwise he would have condemned him.

The implication is that the goddess religions, the castrated priests and temple prostitution had a wide impact in ancient Mediterranean culture (similar to the devadasi system in India today) so would immediately evoke an image for the 1st-century audience of non-Yahwistic religious idolatry, practices not familiar to the modern reader, which makes it easy to misinterpret these verses.

So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.\" (Matthew 19:4-6, NRSV translation; Mark 10:6-9 is a parallel text)</blockquote>Rob Gagnon, an associate professor of New Testament studies, argues it is \"obvious\" that Jesus' back-to-back references to Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 show that he \"presupposed a two-sex requirement for marriage\" even though the question he was being asked was about a contemporary dispute about whether married couples could divorce.<ref>Robert A. J. Gagnon, \"Why the Disagreement over the Biblical Witness on Homosexual Practice?: A Response to David G.

Available online at http://www.robgagnon.net/articles/ReformedReviewArticleWhyTheDisagreement.pdf</ref>\n\nLeroy Huizenga, a Catholic theology professor, acknowledges the question's origin in a dispute between rabbis as to whether divorce was permissible for adultery, for \"many\" reasons, or for \"any reason, including 'even if he find one fairer than she'\", and claims Jesus' reply as meaning that Genesis trumps Moses allowing divorce in Deuteronomy. Huizenga argues that Jesus' reference to Genesis is \"likely\" to include the command in Genesis 1:28 to \"Be fruitful and multiply\". Thus for him, Jesus is affirming that marriage is a union meant to be fruitful, ideally to result in children. Huizenga says Jesus' teaching about marriage here does modify the position held by his Jewish contemporaries, but in drawing on the creation accounts it is \"more radical and less permissive\".<ref>{{cite web |author=Dr. Leroy Huizenga |url=http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Item/2381/jesus_marriage_and_homosexuality.aspx#.UssPNvRDt8E |title=Jesus, Marriage, and Homosexuality \u2013 Catholic World Report |publisher=Catholicworldreport.com |date= |accessdate=2018-04-19}}</ref>\n\nInterestingly, still in response to the question in Matthew 19:3, Jesus speaks further and discusses a class he calls 'eunuchs', which would seem to be a reference to something more than  simply those who have (had) removed their testicles or external genitalia or been born without such:<blockquote>But he said to them, \u201cNot everyone can accept this teaching, but only those to whom it is given. For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.

Elliott 2004){{citation needed|date=January 2020}}. Other translations of the word, based on examinations of the context of its subsequent uses, include [[Dale B. Martin]]'s (1996), who argued it meant \"homosexual slave trader\"{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}, and Boswell's (1980){{citation needed|date=January 2020}} who argued it referred to \"homosexual rape\" or homosexual prostitutes.

For example, Scobie states that \"there is no evidence that the term was restricted to pederasty; beyond doubt, the NT here repeats the Leviticus condemnation of all same-sex relations\".<ref name=\"scobie\">Scobie, C.H.H. (2003) ''The Ways of Our God: An approach to Biblical Theology''. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co. ([https://books.google.com/books?id=rNZ_9huzTvIC Google eBook])</ref> Similarly, Campbell writes, \"it must be pointed out, first, that ''arsenokoit\u0113s'' is a broad term that cannot be confined to specific instances of homosexual activity such as male prostitution or pederasty. This is in keeping with the term's Old Testament background where lying with a 'male' (a very general term) is proscribed, relating to every kind of male-male intercourse.\" Campbell (quoting from Wenham) goes on to say that, \"in fact, the Old Testament bans every type of homosexual intercourse, not just male prostitution or intercourse with youths.\"<ref>Campbell, K.M. (2003) ''Marriage and Family in the Biblical World''. InterVarsity Press. ([https://books.google.com/books?id=WcyqvWfJnyYC Google eBook])</ref>\n\nOthers have pointed out that the meaning of ''arsenokoit\u0113s'' is identified by its derivation from the [[Septuagint|Greek translation of the Old Testament]], where the component words \"with a man (''arsenos'') do not copulate coitus (''koites'') as with a woman\" refer to homosexual conduct. For example, according to Hays, although the word ''arsenokoit\u0113s'' appears nowhere in Greek literature prior to Paul's use of it, it is evidently a rendering into Greek of the standard rabbinic term for \"one who lies with a male [as with a woman]\" (Lev. 18:22; 20:13). Moreover, despite recent challenges to this interpretation, the meaning is confirmed by the evidence of ''[[Sibylline oracles|Sybilline Oracles]]'' 2.73. Paul here repeats the standard Jewish condemnation of homosexual conduct.<ref>Hays, R.B. (2011)  Interpretation. A Bible Commentary for Teaching & Preaching. First Corinthians. Westminster John Knox Press. ([https://books.google.com/books?id=zUI53yPd-kMC Google eBook])</ref> Malick (''op cit'') writes, \"it is significant that of all the terms available in the Greek language, Paul chose a compound from the Septuagint that in the broadest sense described men lying with men as they would lie with women.\"<ref name=\"malick\" /> According to Scobie, \"it clearly echoes the Greek of Lev 18:22 and 20:13 in the LXX (arsen = \"male\", and koite = \"bed\"), so that ''arsenokoit\u0113s'' literally means \"one who goes to bed with a male\".<ref name=\"scobie\" />\n\nDavid Wright argues that the compound word refers to those who sleep with males, and denotes \"\u2018male homosexual activity\u2019 without qualification.\"<ref>Wright, D.F.

(1983) ''The Bible and Homosexuality, Part 2: Homosexuality in the New Testament''. Bibliotheca Sacra 140 (October\u2013December 1983): 351.</ref> Ukleja cites a number of classical Greek sources in support his assertion.<ref group=\"note\">In classical Greek, \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 was also used to refer to boys and men who allowed themselves to be used homosexually. It was also applied to a man taking the female or passive role in homosexuality. Dionysius of Halicarnassus, who wrote Roman Antiquities around 7 B.C., described Aristodemus of Cumae as \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 because he had been \u201ceffeminate\u201d (\u03b8\u03b7\u03bb\u03c5\u03b4\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2) as a child and had undergone the things associated with women. In classical literature the word \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 is sometimes applied to obviously gay persons. Lucian describes the blood of some priests he condemns for passive homosexual behavior as \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2. This cannot be dismissed as not indicating anything about the sexuality of the individuals in question. These were priests who spent their time seeking group sexual encounters. While there is some ambiguity with regard to \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2, it is not beyond reason to see the word representing the passive parties in homosexual intercourse. This is even more reasonable when it is in juxtaposition with \u1f00\u03c1\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 which does imply an active homosexual role. It is interesting that in Aristotle\u2019s Problems, a lengthy discussion of the origins of homosexual passivity, he employs the word \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2. In its general sense the word does mean \u201cunrestrained,\u201d but not without any particularly homosexual context (Ukleja, ''op cit'').</ref>\n\nThe meaning of the word is not confined to male prostitutes. According to Malick (''op cit''), when ''malakos'' is employed in reference to sexual relationships of men with men, it is not a technical term for male call-boys in a pederastic setting. The term may mean effeminate with respect to boys or men who take the role of a woman in homosexual relationships.<ref name=\"malick\" /> Nor is the meaning of the word confined to sexually exploited males.<ref group=\"note\">\u2018The terms malakoi and molles could be used broadly to refer to effeminate or unmanly men. But in specific contexts it could be used in ways similar to the more specific terms [[cinaedus|cinaedi]]  (lit., \u201cbutt-shakers\u201d) and pathici (\u201cthose who undergo [penetration]\u201d) to denote effeminate adult males who are biologically and/or psychologically disposed to desire penetration by men. For example, in Soranus\u2019s work On Chronic Diseases (early 2nd century A.D.) the section on men who desire to be penetrated (4.9.131-37) is entitled \u201cOn the molles or subacti (subjugated or penetrated partners, pathics) whom the Greeks call malthakoi.\u201d An Aristotelian text similarly refers to those who are anatomically inclined toward the receptive role as malakoi (Pseudo-Aristotle, Problems 4.26). Astrological texts that speak of males desirous of playing the penetrated female role also use the term malakoi (Ptolemy, Four Books 3.14 \u00a7172; Vettius Valens, Anthologies 2.37.54; 2.38.82; cf. Brooten, 126 n. 41, 260 n. 132). The complaint about such figures in the ancient world generally, and certainly by Philo, centers around their attempted erasure of the masculine stamp given them by God/nature, not their exploitation of others, age difference, or acts of prostitution.\u2019, Gagnon, \u2018Dale Martin and the Myth of Total Textual Indeterminacy\u2019 (2007); http://www.robgagnon.net/DaleMartinResponse.htm.</ref>\n\nStandard Greek lexicons and dictionaries understand this word as a reference to the passive partner in a male homosexual act.<ref group=\"note\">\u2018pert. to being passive in a same-sex relationship, effeminate esp. of catamites, of men and boys who are sodomized by other males in such a relationship, opp. \u1f00\u03c1\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 (Dionys.

Lewis and H.

For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual impurities, murders, thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.}}\n\nWhether these lists include homosexuality depends on the translation of ''porneia'' (sexual impurity). Translations of these passages generally translate ''porneia'' as fornication rather than sexual impurity (see [[Leviticus]]). Some{{who|date=September 2011}} interpret the translation of ''porneia'' more broadly, to encompass sexual immorality in general, though there is disagreement over whether such an interpretation is supported by the writings of the [[Church Fathers]].\n\n===Pais===\n{{further|Healing the centurion's servant}}\n[[File:JesusHealingCenturionServant.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Healing the Centurion's servant by [[Paolo Veronese]], 16th century.]]\nThis event is referred to in both Matthew 8:5-13 and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 7:1-10 and tells of Jesus healing a [[centurion]]'s servant. Luke 7:2 (TNIV) says: \"There a centurion's servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die.\" The term translated from the Greek as \"servant\" in this verse is ''doulos''. Elsewhere in the two accounts, the term used for the ill person is ''pais'', a term that can be translated in a number of different ways including \"child\" (e.g., Matthew 2:16; Lk 2:43, 8:51-54 where it refers to a girl), \"son\" (John 4:51) or \"servant\" (Lk 15:26, Acts 4:25); elsewhere it is unclear whether \"son\" or \"servant\" is meant (Acts 3:13, 3:26, 4:27, 4:30).\n\nHorner<ref>Horner, T.

(2000) ''What the Bible Really Says about Homosexuality''. Alamo Square Press.</ref> both suggest a homosexual theme to this text. Helminiak argues that this is implied by the broader context of the narrative suggesting an unusual level of concern about the servant, whereas Horner suggests that use of the term \"valued highly\" implies a sexual relationship. Horner goes on to argue that, as Jesus commended the centurion for his faith (Matthew 8:10; Luke 7:9), it shows that Jesus approved of their relationship, otherwise he would have condemned him. However, a contrasting viewpoint is that the term \u201chighly valued\u201d (Greek \u1f14\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, ''entimos'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=e%29%2Fntimos&la=greek&can=e%29%2Fntimos0#lexicon |title=Liddell and Scott \u1f14\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2018-04-19}}</ref> simply suggests a genuine care for the person or, more archaically, that the centurion was fond of this slave,<ref>[http://bible.org/netbible/luk7_notes.htm#77 Luke 7] NET Bible.</ref> and that the term ''entimos'' has no hint of sexual content in any of its various appearances in the Bible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reformed.org/social/index.html?mainframe=http://www.reformed.org/social/hodges_response_helminiak.html |title=Derrick K.

He built the main Portions of the three-storeyed gopura at the entrance of Sundareswarar Shrine and the central portion of the Goddess Meenakshi Shrine are some of the earliest surviving parts of the temple.  The traditional texts call him a poet-saint king, additionally credit him with a poem called Ambikai Malai, as well as shrines (koil) each for Natarajar and Surya near the main temple, Ayyanar in the east, Vinayagar in the south, Kariamalperumal in the west and Kali in the north. He also built a Mahamandapam. Kulasekara Pandya was also a poet and he composed a poem on Meenakshi named Ambikai Malai.{{sfn|D.

Chitra gopuram (W), also known as Muttalakkum Vayil, was built by Maravarman Sundara Pandyan II (1238-1251).

All of these place the temple in ancient times and include a warrior goddess, but the details vary significantly and are inconsistent with each other. Some link to it deities they call Alavai Iraivan and Alavai Annal, or alternatively Angayar Kanni Ammai. Some link its legend to other deities such as Indra who proclaims the primacy of the goddess, while some describe Hindu gods appearing before ancient kings or saints urging wealthy merchants to build this temple in the honor of a goddess. One legend describes a childless king and queen performing yajna for a son, they get a daughter who inherits the kingdom, conquers the earth, meets Shiva ultimately, marries him, continues to rule from Madurai, and the temple memorializes those times. Instead of such inconsistent ahistorical mythologies, scholars have attempted to determine the history of the temple from inscriptions found in and outside Madurai, as well as comparing the records relating to South Indian dynasties.

According to Susan Lewandowski, the Nayaka rulers followed the Hindu texts on architecture called the ''[[Shilpa Shastras]]'' in redesigning the temple city plan and the Meenakshi temple. The city was laid out, states Lewandowski, in the shape of concentric squares and ring-roads around them, with radiating streets culminating in the Meenakshi-Sundaresvara temple.{{sfn|King| 2005| pp= 72-73}} These streets use traditional Tamil Hindu month names, such as Adhi, Chitrai, Avani-moola, Masi and others. In each of these months, the Hindus started their tradition of taking the temple bronzes festively through the street of the same name.{{sfn|King| 2005| pp= 72-73}} The temple and the city was once again east facing to greet the rising [[Surya]] (sun god).{{sfn|King| 2005| pp= 72-73}}{{refn|group=note|Some of the shrines and the gopuram are not exactly aligned east-west and north-south axis, however.{{sfn|King| 2005| pp= 72-75}}}} The temple city grew again around the new temple, with human settlements structured along their castes, according to Lewandowski, with the royalty, Kshatriyas and Vaishya merchants lived on the southeast side of the temple, the Brahmins in a special quarter close to the temple, while others in other areas and fringes of the city.{{sfn|King| 2005| pp= 72-75}} The king started a procession tradition linked to the temple to link his authority with the divine and maintain the social system.{{sfn|King| 2005| pp= 72-75}} In contrast, according to Bayly, the procession reflects the traditional matrilineal social values, the brother-sister-groom kinship values that better explain its popularity.

The traditional texts call him a poet-saint king, additionally credit him with a poem called Ambikai Malai, as well as shrines (koil) each for Natarajar and Surya near the main temple, Ayyanar in the east, Vinayagar in the south, Kariamalperumal in the west and Kali in the north. He also built a Mahamandapam. Kulasekara Pandya was also a poet and he composed a poem on Meenakshi named Ambikai Malai.{{sfn|D.

Chitra gopuram (W), also known as Muttalakkum Vayil, was built by Maravarman Sundara Pandyan II (1238-1251). This gopuram is named after the frescoes and reliefs that depict secular and religious themes of Hindu culture. Maravarman Sundara Pandyan II also added a pillared corridor to the Sundareswara shrine and the Sundara Pandyan Mandapam {{sfn|D. Uma|2015|pp=19-23}}.

All of these place the temple in ancient times and include a warrior goddess, but the details vary significantly and are inconsistent with each other. Some link to it deities they call Alavai Iraivan and Alavai Annal, or alternatively Angayar Kanni Ammai. Some link its legend to other deities such as Indra who proclaims the primacy of the goddess, while some describe Hindu gods appearing before ancient kings or saints urging wealthy merchants to build this temple in the honor of a goddess. One legend describes a childless king and queen performing yajna for a son, they get a daughter who inherits the kingdom, conquers the earth, meets Shiva ultimately, marries him, continues to rule from Madurai, and the temple memorializes those times. Instead of such inconsistent ahistorical mythologies, scholars have attempted to determine the history of the temple from inscriptions found in and outside Madurai, as well as comparing the records relating to South Indian dynasties.

According to Susan Lewandowski, the Nayaka rulers followed the Hindu texts on architecture called the ''[[Shilpa Shastras]]'' in redesigning the temple city plan and the Meenakshi temple. The city was laid out, states Lewandowski, in the shape of concentric squares and ring-roads around them, with radiating streets culminating in the Meenakshi-Sundaresvara temple.{{sfn|King| 2005| pp= 72-73}} These streets use traditional Tamil Hindu month names, such as Adhi, Chitrai, Avani-moola, Masi and others. In each of these months, the Hindus started their tradition of taking the temple bronzes festively through the street of the same name.{{sfn|King| 2005| pp= 72-73}} The temple and the city was once again east facing to greet the rising [[Surya]] (sun god).{{sfn|King| 2005| pp= 72-73}}{{refn|group=note|Some of the shrines and the gopuram are not exactly aligned east-west and north-south axis, however.{{sfn|King| 2005| pp= 72-75}}}} The temple city grew again around the new temple, with human settlements structured along their castes, according to Lewandowski, with the royalty, Kshatriyas and Vaishya merchants lived on the southeast side of the temple, the Brahmins in a special quarter close to the temple, while others in other areas and fringes of the city.{{sfn|King| 2005| pp= 72-75}} The king started a procession tradition linked to the temple to link his authority with the divine and maintain the social system.{{sfn|King| 2005| pp= 72-75}} In contrast, according to Bayly, the procession reflects the traditional matrilineal social values, the brother-sister-groom kinship values that better explain its popularity. The warrior goddess worship tradition is ancient in the Tamil Hindu tradition, states Bayly, and it dramatically expanded after the 14th-century wars.<ref name=\"Bayly1989p29\"/>\n\nThe work completed by Vishwanatha Nayaka in 1560 was substantially expanded to the current structure during the reign of [[Tirumala Nayaka]] (1623\u201355).  Tirumala Nayaka, a Hindu king, took considerable interest in erecting many complexes inside the temple.  His major contributions are the ''Vasantha Mandapam'' for celebrating ''Vasanthotsavam'' (spring festival) and ''Kilikoondu Mandapam'' (corridor of parrots).  The corridors of the temple tank and ''Meenatchi Nayakar Mandapam'' were built by [[Rani Mangammal]].

Professor Christopher Fuller signifies that through the wedding of [[Meenakshi]] and Sundaresvara the \"supremely important rite of passage\" for women, the cultural concept of \"sumangali\" or \"auspicious married woman\" who lives with her husband but is also independent, organizer of the social connections and who is central to Tamilian life. The marriage of the goddess and god is a symbolic paradigm for human marriage.<ref name=cfuller205>Christopher Fuller (1995), The 'Holy Family' of Shiva in a south Indian temple, Social Anthropology, Volume 3, Issue 3, Cambridge University Press, pages 205-217</ref> This event is commemorated with an annual festive procession that falls sometime around April. The temple is also significant because it implies an affinal, protective relationship between [[Shaivism]] and [[Vaishnavism]] traditions of Hinduism, by making Shiva the husband of Meenakshi, and Vishnu her brother, a significant relationship in Dravidian kinship system.<ref name=cfuller205/><ref name=\"Shulman2014\">{{cite book|author=David Dean Shulman|title=Tamil Temple Myths: Sacrifice and Divine Marriage in the South Indian Saiva Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d97_AwAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-5692-3|pages=138\u2013149}}</ref> Meenakshi herself is a central part of the [[Shaktism]] tradition of Hinduism, and represented as the dominant figure of the pair in this temple.

It is called the \"[[Chithirai Thiruvizha#Meenakshi Tirukalyanam|Meenakshi Thirukalyanam]]\". The festival is celebrated in the Chithirai month, which typically falls about April.
