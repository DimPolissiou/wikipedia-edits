The population was 15,039 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Scottsbluff is the largest city in the [[Nebraska Panhandle]], and the [[List of cities in Nebraska|13th largest city]] in [[Nebraska]].\n\nScottsbluff was founded in 1899 across the [[North Platte River]] from its namesake, a bluff that is now a [[United States National Park|U.S. National Park]] called [[Scotts Bluff National Monument]]. The monument was named after [[Hiram Scott]] (1805\u20131828), a fur trader with the [[Rocky Mountain Fur Company]] who was found dead in the vicinity on the return trip from a fur expedition. The smaller town of [[Gering, Nebraska|Gering]] had been founded south of the river in 1887. The two cities have since grown together to form the 7th largest urban area (the [[Scottsbluff Micropolitan Statistical Area]]) in Nebraska.\n\n==History==\nScottsbluff was laid out in 1899 when the railroad was extended to that point.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.casde.unl.edu/history/counties/scottsbluff/scottsbluff-gering/ | title=The Twin Cities: Gering and Scottsbluff | publisher=University of Nebraska | work=Center for Advanced Land Management Information Technologies | accessdate=August 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Other names==\nIn the [[Lakota language]], Scottsbluff is called ''p\u021fa\u014bk\u00e9ska wakp\u00e1 ot\u021f\u00fa\u014bwahe'' (\"[[Platte River]] City\", lit. \"[[abalone]] river city\").<ref>{{cite book |last=Ullrich |first=Jan F. |title=New Lakota Dictionary |url=http://www.lakotadictionary.org/nldo.php |edition=2nd |year=2014 |publisher=Lakota Language Consortium |location=Bloomington, IN |isbn=978-0-9761082-9-0}}</ref>\n\n==Geography and climate==\nScottsbluff is located at {{Coord|41|52|2|N|103|39|39|W|type:city}} (41.867140, \u2212103.660709).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|6.27|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|6.22|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.05|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=June 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112090031/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=January 12, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nScottsbluff has a [[semi-arid climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''[[Semi-arid climate#Cold Semi-arid climates|''BSk'']]''), with wide seasonal and day-to-day variation as well as a large [[diurnal temperature variation]], and is located in [[Hardiness zone|USDA Plant Hardiness Zone]] 5a.<ref>{{cite web|title=USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map|url=http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |accessdate=August 13, 2018}}</ref> Summers are hot, and winters dry and cold, though [[chinook wind]]s can loosen the cold's grip, often bringing temperatures above {{convert|50|\u00b0F}}.

Nebraska|Scotts Bluff County]], in the western part of the state of [[Nebraska]], in the [[Great Plains]] region of the United States. The population was 15,039 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Scottsbluff is the largest city in the [[Nebraska Panhandle]], and the [[List of cities in Nebraska|13th largest city]] in [[Nebraska]].\n\nScottsbluff was founded in 1899 across the [[North Platte River]] from its namesake, a bluff that is now a [[United States National Park|U.S. National Park]] called [[Scotts Bluff National Monument]]. The monument was named after [[Hiram Scott]] (1805\u20131828), a fur trader with the [[Rocky Mountain Fur Company]] who was found dead in the vicinity on the return trip from a fur expedition. The smaller town of [[Gering, Nebraska|Gering]] had been founded south of the river in 1887. The two cities have since grown together to form the 7th largest urban area (the [[Scottsbluff Micropolitan Statistical Area]]) in Nebraska.\n\n==History==\nScottsbluff was laid out in 1899 when the railroad was extended to that point.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.casde.unl.edu/history/counties/scottsbluff/scottsbluff-gering/ | title=The Twin Cities: Gering and Scottsbluff | publisher=University of Nebraska | work=Center for Advanced Land Management Information Technologies | accessdate=August 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Other names==\nIn the [[Lakota language]], Scottsbluff is called ''p\u021fa\u014bk\u00e9ska wakp\u00e1 ot\u021f\u00fa\u014bwahe'' (\"[[Platte River]] City\", lit. \"[[abalone]] river city\").<ref>{{cite book |last=Ullrich |first=Jan F. |title=New Lakota Dictionary |url=http://www.lakotadictionary.org/nldo.php |edition=2nd |year=2014 |publisher=Lakota Language Consortium |location=Bloomington, IN |isbn=978-0-9761082-9-0}}</ref>\n\n==Geography and climate==\nScottsbluff is located at {{Coord|41|52|2|N|103|39|39|W|type:city}} (41.867140, \u2212103.660709).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|6.27|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|6.22|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.05|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=June 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112090031/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=January 12, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nScottsbluff has a [[semi-arid climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''[[Semi-arid climate#Cold Semi-arid climates|''BSk'']]''), with wide seasonal and day-to-day variation as well as a large [[diurnal temperature variation]], and is located in [[Hardiness zone|USDA Plant Hardiness Zone]] 5a.<ref>{{cite web|title=USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map|url=http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |accessdate=August 13, 2018}}</ref> Summers are hot, and winters dry and cold, though [[chinook wind]]s can loosen the cold's grip, often bringing temperatures above {{convert|50|\u00b0F}}.

The line which ran through the nearby villages and seaside towns of [[Mablethorpe]], [[Sutton-on-Sea]], [[Grimoldby]], [[Saltfleetby]], [[Theddlethorpe]], [[Mumby]] and [[Willoughby, Lincolnshire|Willoughby]]. The station was the terminus on the [[Louth to Bardney Line]] which opened in 1876 but closed in 1951 to passengers and to freight traffic in 1960. Bardney was the terminus of the branch line and was on the [[Lincolnshire Loop Line]]\n\nThe station closed to passengers in 1970 along with the Mablethorpe Loop Line and the section from [[Firsby railway station|Firsby]] to Louth of the East Lincolnshire Railway. The section to Grimsby remained in use for freight traffic until December 1980 when it closed and was later removed.\n\nThe station building and Louth North Signal Box remain in situ to this day as private dwellings. All of the station site has been built on by residential and commercial outlets.\n\nThere are plans to eventually have Louth as the southern terminus of the [[Lincolnshire Wolds Railway]] which would utilise the trackbed from Louth to Holton-Le-Clay, although it will be to the north of Louth due to the station building now being occupied and the station site around it built over. This would mean Louth would have a rail connection for the first time in almost 50 years, since the closure to passengers in 1970, but at a new station site.\n\nA canal was built between 1765 and 1770 to connect Louth to the sea at Tetney. It was formally abandoned in 1924.\nA fuller account is at [[Louth Canal]].\n\nThere are regular buses connecting Louth with the nearby Grimsby, Skegness, Mablethorpe and Lincoln. There is also a direct service once a month to [[York]] and National Express coaches call at Louth bus station. All services are operated by different companies but the main one is [[Stagecoach]]. However, unlike other towns. The town is not served by late-night services with the last bus departing the town at 7:00 pm.\n\nThe nearest active railway station is now Grimsby and Skegness.\n\n==St James' Church==\n[[File:Lincolnshire Rising plaque - geograph.org.uk - 860306.jpg|thumb|Lincolnshire Rising plaque in Louth]]\n{{see also|St James' Church, Louth|Lincolnshire Rising}}\n\nThe town was the origin of the [[Lincolnshire Rising]], which started on 1 October 1536 in [[St. James Church, Louth|St James Church]].

The line which ran through the nearby villages and seaside towns of [[Mablethorpe]], [[Sutton-on-Sea]], [[Grimoldby]], [[Saltfleetby]], [[Theddlethorpe]], [[Mumby]] and [[Willoughby, Lincolnshire|Willoughby]]. The station was the terminus on the [[Louth to Bardney Line]] which opened in 1876 but closed in 1951 to passengers and to freight traffic in 1960. Bardney was the terminus of the branch line and was on the [[Lincolnshire Loop Line]]\n\nThe station closed to passengers in 1970 along with the Mablethorpe Loop Line and the section from [[Firsby railway station|Firsby]] to Louth of the East Lincolnshire Railway. The section to Grimsby remained in use for freight traffic until December 1980 when it closed and was later removed.\n\nThe station building and Louth North Signal Box remain in situ to this day as private dwellings. All of the station site has been built on by residential and commercial outlets.\n\nThere are plans to eventually have Louth as the southern terminus of the [[Lincolnshire Wolds Railway]] which would utilise the trackbed from Louth to Holton-Le-Clay, although it will be to the north of Louth due to the station building now being occupied and the station site around it built over. This would mean Louth would have a rail connection for the first time in almost 50 years, since the closure to passengers in 1970, but at a new station site.\n\nA canal was built between 1765 and 1770 to connect Louth to the sea at Tetney. It was formally abandoned in 1924.\nA fuller account is at [[Louth Canal]].\n\nThere are regular buses connecting Louth with the nearby Grimsby, Skegness, Mablethorpe and Lincoln. There is also a direct service once a month to [[York]] and National Express coaches call at Louth bus station. All services are operated by different companies but the main one is [[Stagecoach]]. However, unlike other towns. The town is not served by late-night services with the last bus departing the town at 7:00 pm.\n\nThe nearest active railway station is now Grimsby and Skegness.\n\n==St James' Church==\n[[File:Lincolnshire Rising plaque - geograph.org.uk - 860306.jpg|thumb|Lincolnshire Rising plaque in Louth]]\n{{see also|St James' Church, Louth|Lincolnshire Rising}}\n\nThe town was the origin of the [[Lincolnshire Rising]], which started on 1 October 1536 in [[St. James Church, Louth|St James Church]].

The club are members of the {{English football updater|StHelenT}}, and as from season 2016\u201317 play their home matches at Ruskin Drive Sports Ground.\n\n==History==\nSt Helens Town was formed in 1901 and played at Park Road, behind the Primrose Vaults public house. Although it was known as the [[St Helens Greyhound Racing and Sports Stadium|Primrose Ground]], the players changed further down Park Road at the Black Horse pub. Playing in the Lancashire League and Lancashire Combination, the team enjoyed some early success, but struggled after the Great War and appears to have folded midway through the 1928\u201329 season.\n\nThe club was re-formed by George Fryer and a group of local businessmen in 1946. They took out a lease of the former cricket ground at Hoghton Road, Sutton, adjacent to the St Helens Junction railway station and, although the club entered the [[FA Cup]] in the 1946\u201347 season, a team could not be raised in time to fulfill the tie with [[Prescot Cables]]. Friendly games were played, then local team Derbyshire Hill Rovers were taken over in April 1947, those players forming the nucleus of the team which entered the Liverpool County Combination at the start of the 1947\u201348 season. St Helens Town soon began to prosper and early results included a sensational 1\u2013-4 win over [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] \"A\" on 6 December 1947. Former German prisoner-of-war [[Bert Trautmann]] joined the club in the summer of 1948, the strapping goalkeeper helping the team to win its first trophy, the George Mahon Cup, which was secured with a 2\u20131 win over [[Runcorn F.C.|Runcorn]] at Prescot on 7 May 1949. Crowds averaged over 2,000 that season, peaking with a league record attendance of 3,102 against [[Burscough F.C.|Burscough]] in October 1948.\n\nThe following season, 1949\u201350, Town entered the [[Lancashire Combination]] and, despite losing Trautmann to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in October 1949, they won the Second Division title in some style the following season with three players all netting over 30 goals apiece: Albert Leadbitter (36), Harry McCann (32) and Terry Garner (31). An all-time club record attendance \"between 8,000 and 9,000\" witnessed a friendly game against Manchester City which was arranged as part of the Trautmann transfer deal in April 1950. Another 4,000 spectators then witnessed a second game contested by the two teams the season after. Although relegated by a slender margin from the First Division in 1951\u201352, the club continued to look forward, even contemplating [[Football League]] status and, in order to further their ambitions, the club moved to the former [[St Helens Recreation RLFC|St Helens Recreation]] ground at City Road. Initial crowds were encouraging at their new home, but, despite success, Town decided to move back to Hoghton Road in October 1953, where they remained until April 2000.\n\nFollowing a second relegation in 1956, St Helens Town continued to play in the Lancashire Combination, winning the Championship in 1971\u201372, by nine points ahead of [[Accrington Stanley F.C.|Accrington Stanley]]. However, the formation of the [[Northern Premier League]] in 1968 led to a gradual drain of stronger clubs from the Combination and St Helens joined the Cheshire League in 1975. Seven years later, Town eventually became founder members of the [[North West Counties League]], and competed in the Premier Division's inaugural season in 1982\u201383. They held the proud record of being the only club to play in the North West Counties top flight in every season until they were relegated in April 2015 in dramatic fashion, conceding an injury time equalizer to [[Silsden F.C.|Silsden]] in the final game of the season, in which if they won, they would have stayed up.\n\nTown enjoyed a golden era in the late 1980s, just missing out on an appearance in the First Round Proper of the FA Cup in 1985\u201386, losing to [[Morecambe F.C.|Morecambe]] in a Fourth Qualifying Round Replay. But they obtained ample compensation by winning the [[FA Vase]] in 1987, beating near neighbours [[Warrington Town F.C.|Warrington Town]] in the Final 3\u20132 with a Phil Layhe brace and a goal from Brian Rigby.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fchd.info/cups/favase1986-87.htm|title=Football Club History Database - F.A.

Sheldon supported the [[Yorkists]] at the battle of [[Battle of Bosworth Field|Bosworth]] in 1485, and as a result of the definitive [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] victory there he was deprived of his property, but it was restored to him before he died in 1517.<ref>Victoria County History, vol.iv, p.14, note 25.</ref> In his Inquisition Post Mortem, held at [[Pershore]], it was said that Sheldon owned Balford Hall and seven other houses and 460 acres of land in Beoley, and more elsewhere in [[Worcestershire]] and [[Warwickshire]]. In his will<ref>[[Prerogative Court of Canterbury]], 35 Holder</ref> he made bequests to the churches at Beoley and Abberton and to Pershore Abbey.\n\nSheldon was succeeded at Beoley by his son Ralph (d.1546), who was married to Philippa, daughter of Baldwin Heath of Ford Hall, Wootton Wawen.<ref name=Willis-Bund/> Ralph was imprisoned in the [[Marshalsea]] in 1580 for [[Recusant|recusancy]] but was released on medical grounds.<ref name=Willis-Bund/> Ralph was succeeded at Beoley by his eldest son, William (b.c1500-1570), who possessed the manors of Weston, Warwickshire, Abberton (jointly with his brother Francis), and, by now, virtually the entire parish of Beoley (some 4000 acres). He was Receiver at the Court of Augmentations, Knight of the Shire for Worcestershire, and Sheriff of the same county. Around 1534, William Sheldon purchased 2,000 acres of land at Skilts, between Beoley and his mother\u2019s home Ford Hall, which lands had been a grange of [[Studley Priory, Oxfordshire|Studley]] Priory. His magnificent tomb is in Beoley parish church.\n\nWilliam Sheldon was succeeded by his son, another Ralph Sheldon (1537-1613), who was married to Anne, daughter of Sir Robert Throgmorton, Knt., of Coughton, who had attended the reception of [[Anne of Cleves]]. A [[Roman Catholic]], Ralph Sheldon was a courtier at the Court of Queen Mary, and sometime a courier for [[Mary Queen of Scots]] between her place of confinement and Scotland. He is frequently mentioned in State Papers as a [[recusant]], and in 1594 there is reference to an alleged premeditated rebellion in North Wales, \"the chiefest aid for which is to come from Ralph Sheldon\", and that he had sent an emissary to Louvain \"with letters to Cardinal Allen.\" He is said to have been responsible for the construction of the great manor house at Weston Park in Warwickshire, another Sheldon estate in Long Compton parish. He was succeeded by his eldest son and heir Edward (1561-1643). Also a Royalist, in August 1636 King Charles 1st visited Warwick, and a day or two later went on \"to Weston at Mr. Sheldon's house with great delight.\"\n\nEdward's son and heir William Sheldon of Beoley (1589-1659), always resided at Weston Park (where he died). In 1611, he married Elizabeth, daughter of the recusant [[William Petre, 2nd Baron Petre]].<ref>Barnard,E.A.B., ''The Sheldons'', 1936, pg. 48</ref> Considered \"a man of literary taste\", Sheldon was a [[Cavalier|Royalist]] and at various times during the early years of the Civil War he was, in his turn, harassed as \"a Popish delinquent\".\n\nIn 1660 after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration of the Monarchy]] Beoley was restored ''via'' Richard Sheldon to William's son, the famous [[antiquary]] Ralph Sheldon (1623-1684). He was married to Henrietta Maria, daughter of Thomas, 1st Viscount Savage, but had no issue.<ref name=Willis-Bund/><ref>Barnard, 1936, p.54-6.</ref> Beoley now passed to a first cousin once removed, Ralph Sheldon, Lord of Beoley & Weston (1653-1720) who was married to Mary Anne, daughter of John Elliot of Gatacre Park, Shropshire. His estates passed to his eldest son and heir, Edward (1679-1746) and then to his eldest son William (1715-1780). His son Ralph Sheldon inherited Beoley in 1780, but by 1788 it was said to be heavily mortgaged and he sold the manor to a Thomas Holmes.<ref name=Willis-Bund/> Holmes separated Beoley Hall (see below) and {{convert|300|acre|ha}} of land from the rest of the manor and sold off the two lots to separate buyers.<ref name=Willis-Bund/>\n\n==Beoley Hall==\nThe Sheldons' main [[manor house]] at Beoley was originally Balford Hall.

Sheldon supported the [[Yorkists]] at the battle of [[Battle of Bosworth Field|Bosworth]] in 1485, and as a result of the definitive [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] victory there he was deprived of his property, but it was restored to him before he died in 1517.<ref>Victoria County History, vol.iv, p.14, note 25.</ref> In his Inquisition Post Mortem, held at [[Pershore]], it was said that Sheldon owned Balford Hall and seven other houses and 460 acres of land in Beoley, and more elsewhere in [[Worcestershire]] and [[Warwickshire]]. In his will<ref>[[Prerogative Court of Canterbury]], 35 Holder</ref> he made bequests to the churches at Beoley and Abberton and to Pershore Abbey.\n\nSheldon was succeeded at Beoley by his son Ralph (d.1546), who was married to Philippa, daughter of Baldwin Heath of Ford Hall, Wootton Wawen.<ref name=Willis-Bund/> Ralph was imprisoned in the [[Marshalsea]] in 1580 for [[Recusant|recusancy]] but was released on medical grounds.<ref name=Willis-Bund/> Ralph was succeeded at Beoley by his eldest son, William (b.c1500-1570), who possessed the manors of Weston, Warwickshire, Abberton (jointly with his brother Francis), and, by now, virtually the entire parish of Beoley (some 4000 acres). He was Receiver at the Court of Augmentations, Knight of the Shire for Worcestershire, and Sheriff of the same county. Around 1534, William Sheldon purchased 2,000 acres of land at Skilts, between Beoley and his mother\u2019s home Ford Hall, which lands had been a grange of [[Studley Priory, Oxfordshire|Studley]] Priory. His magnificent tomb is in Beoley parish church.\n\nWilliam Sheldon was succeeded by his son, another Ralph Sheldon (1537-1613), who was married to Anne, daughter of Sir Robert Throgmorton, Knt., of Coughton, who had attended the reception of [[Anne of Cleves]]. A [[Roman Catholic]], Ralph Sheldon was a courtier at the Court of Queen Mary, and sometime a courier for [[Mary Queen of Scots]] between her place of confinement and Scotland. He is frequently mentioned in State Papers as a [[recusant]], and in 1594 there is reference to an alleged premeditated rebellion in North Wales, \"the chiefest aid for which is to come from Ralph Sheldon\", and that he had sent an emissary to Louvain \"with letters to Cardinal Allen.\" He is said to have been responsible for the construction of the great manor house at Weston Park in Warwickshire, another Sheldon estate in Long Compton parish. He was succeeded by his eldest son and heir Edward (1561-1643). Also a Royalist, in August 1636 King Charles 1st visited Warwick, and a day or two later went on \"to Weston at Mr. Sheldon's house with great delight.\"\n\nEdward's son and heir William Sheldon of Beoley (1589-1659), always resided at Weston Park (where he died). In 1611, he married Elizabeth, daughter of the recusant [[William Petre, 2nd Baron Petre]].<ref>Barnard,E.A.B., ''The Sheldons'', 1936, pg. 48</ref> Considered \"a man of literary taste\", Sheldon was a [[Cavalier|Royalist]] and at various times during the early years of the Civil War he was, in his turn, harassed as \"a Popish delinquent\".\n\nIn 1660 after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration of the Monarchy]] Beoley was restored ''via'' Richard Sheldon to William's son, the famous [[antiquary]] Ralph Sheldon (1623-1684). He was married to Henrietta Maria, daughter of Thomas, 1st Viscount Savage, but had no issue.<ref name=Willis-Bund/><ref>Barnard, 1936, p.54-6.</ref> Beoley now passed to a first cousin once removed, Ralph Sheldon, Lord of Beoley & Weston (1653-1720) who was married to Mary Anne, daughter of John Elliot of Gatacre Park, Shropshire. His estates passed to his eldest son and heir, Edward (1679-1746) and then to his eldest son William (1715-1780). His son Ralph Sheldon inherited Beoley in 1780, but by 1788 it was said to be heavily mortgaged and he sold the manor to a Thomas Holmes.<ref name=Willis-Bund/> Holmes separated Beoley Hall (see below) and {{convert|300|acre|ha}} of land from the rest of the manor and sold off the two lots to separate buyers.<ref name=Willis-Bund/>\n\n==Beoley Hall==\nThe Sheldons' main [[manor house]] at Beoley was originally Balford Hall.

Because this upgrade advantages CPU engines compared to GPU engines, TCEC split the qualification paths to Premier Division by introducing separate leagues for CPU and GPU engines. While an upgrade to the GPU servers is being secured, the CPU leagues are played first.\n\n===Structure===\nFor CPU engines, there will first be a Qualification League consisting of 16 engines, followed by League 2 (16 engines) and League 1 (16 engines). In the Qualification League the top 6 engines promote. In League 2 the top 4 engines promote. The engines in each league are seeded based on their performances in previous seasons. For GPU engines, there will be one league only, with up to 16 competitors. The top 2 GPU engines will then contest a playoff against the top 4 CPU engines in League 1, with the four highest-placing engines promoting to Premier Division.\n\nPremier Division is also expanded from 8 engines to 10. Six engines - [[Stockfish (chess)|Stockfish]], [[Komodo (chess)|Komodo]], [[Houdini (chess)|Houdini]], [[Leela Chess Zero]], [[AllieStein]], and Stoofvlees - are seeded directly to Premier Division, based on their top 6 finishes in the previous season. Finally, the top two engines in Premier Division qualify for the 100-game superfinal match.\n\n==Results==\n===CPU Qualification League===\nAfter not competing for five seasons, Season 11 Div 3 engine Defenchess trailblazed the qualification league. It scored 18 wins while conceding no losses, finishing 3.5 points clear at the top. It was the only undefeated engine. Demolito and Winter also locked up two of the promotion spots smoothly, but the remaining three slots were closely contested. Among the competitors Igel was the only engine to not lose to Defenchess and Demolito, but it lost to bottom-half engines FabChess and Topple. Comparatively, iCE was whitewashed by Defenchess and Igel, but it turned in a strong performance against its other rivals, losing only one other game to Winter. Pirarucu went through a tense moment when it lost to Winter in the penultimate round; however it pulled out a win with Black against Topple to promote. 7th-placed Minic was in a promotion spot all the way up to the final round, when it lost to Gogobello while iCE beat Counter. This left the two tied at 17.5 points. Minic had the better [[Sonneborn\u2013Berger score]], but it also had one crash, and the number of crashes was the first tiebreak. Nonetheless, in a stroke of good fortune for Minic (and 8th-placed PeSTO), the League Two engines chess22k and [[Fritz (chess)|Fritz]] crashed three times during testing for the division. By TCEC rules, if this happened, the author(s) would have to update the engine or it is disqualified. chess22k's and Fritz's authors were not able to update the engines in time, resulting in Minic and PeSTO promoting as lucky losers.<ref>https://imgur.com/GHNF1Zu</ref>\n\n{{#invoke:Sports table|main|style=WDL\n\n|show_matches=false\n|update=complete\n\n|source=[https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=ql&game=1]\n|for_against_style=none\n|res_col_header=Q\n|result1=WC \n|result2=WC \n|result3=WC \n|result4=WC \n|result5=WC \n|result6=WC \n|col_WC=green1 |text_WC={{nowrap|Advance to League Two}}\n|result7=WB \n|result8=WB \n|col_WB=blue1 |text_WB={{nowrap|Advance to League Two (see text)}}\n|team1=DEF|team2=DEM|team3=WIN|team4=PIR|team5=IGE|team6=ICE|team7=MIN|team8=PES|team9=MAR|team10=GOG|team11=TOP|team12=COU|team13=FAB|team14=TUC|team15=ASY|team16=CHE|\n\n|win_DEF=18 |draw_DEF=12 |loss_DEF=0\n|win_DEM=12 |draw_DEM=17 |loss_DEM=1\n|win_WIN=14 |draw_WIN=12 |loss_WIN=4\n|win_PIR=10 |draw_PIR=16 |loss_PIR=4\n|win_IGE=10 |draw_IGE=16 |loss_IGE=4\n|win_ICE=10 |draw_ICE=15 |loss_ICE=5\n|win_MIN=10 |draw_MIN=15 |loss_MIN=5\n|win_PES=8 |draw_PES=17 |loss_PES=5\n|win_MAR=8 |draw_MAR=16 |loss_MAR=6\n|win_GOG=8 |draw_GOG=14 |loss_GOG=8\n|win_TOP=8 |draw_TOP=12 |loss_TOP=10\n|win_COU=4 |draw_COU=12 |loss_COU=14\n|win_FAB=3 |draw_FAB=14 |loss_FAB=13\n|win_TUC=4 |draw_TUC=9 |loss_TUC=17\n|win_ASY=2 |draw_ASY=13 |loss_ASY=15\n|win_CHE=2 |draw_CHE=8 |loss_CHE=20\n\n|winpoints=1\n|drawpoints=0.5\n|losspoints=0\n\n|team_header=Engine\n|name_DEF=Defenchess |short_DEF=DEF\n|name_DEM=Demolito |short_DEM=DEM\n|name_WIN=Winter |short_WIN=WIN\n|name_PIR=Pirarucu |short_PIR=PIR\n|name_IGE=Igel |short_IGE=IGE\n|name_ICE=iCE |short_ICE=ICE\n|name_MIN=Minic |short_MIN=MIN\n|name_PES=PeSTO |short_PES=PES\n|name_MAR=Marvin |short_MAR=MAR\n|name_GOG=Gogobello |short_GOG=GOG\n|name_TOP=Topple |short_TOP=TOP\n|name_COU=Counter |short_COU=COU\n|name_FAB=FabChess |short_FAB=FAB\n|name_TUC=Tucano |short_TUC=TUC\n|name_ASY=Asymptote |short_ASY=ASY\n|name_CHE=Cheese |short_CHE=CHE\n\n}}\n\n===CPU League Two===\nFormer Premier Division engine Fire won League Two. It had been relegated in [[TCEC Season 16|the previous season]] because its developer had submitted a drastically different neural network-based version that turned out to be significantly weaker. This season, the original, traditional engine played, and it dominated with an undefeated 22/28 (16 wins and 12 draws). It defeated seven engines, including fourth-place Vajolet, 2-0. Second placed Defenchess also turned in a strong performance, finishing with an undefeated 20.5/28 (13 wins and 15 draws). For the other promoted engines, Winter and PeSTO performed surprisingly well, comfortably finishing above their peers in 7th and 8th respectively. The remaining five promoted engines occupied the bottom five spots, and were all relegated along with Wasp (which crashed three times).\n\nAfter the division concluded, in a repeat of testing for League Two, four League One engines either pulled out or did not run on the new Linux operating system, resulting in the 5th-8th placed engines in League One promoting.\n\n{{#invoke:Sports table|main|style=WDL\n\n|show_matches=false\n|update=complete\n\n|source=[https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=l1&game=1], see also [https://tcecbayeselo.chessdom.org/2020/01/25/tcec-season-17-league2-game-240-defenchess-2-3_dev-igel-2-3-1/] for table with Wasp's score zeroed out\n|for_against_style=none\n|res_col_header=Q\n|result1=WC \n|result2=WC \n|result3=WC \n|result4=WC \n|col_WC=green1 |text_WC={{nowrap|Advance to League One}}\n|result5=WB\n|result6=WB\n|result7=WB\n|result8=WB\n|col_WB=blue1|text_WB={{nowrap|Advance to League One (see text)}}\n|team1=FIR|team2=DEF|team3=RUB|team4=VAJ|team5=PED|team6=NEM|team7=WIN|team8=PES|team9=GUL|team10=WAS|team11=TEX|team12=DEM|team13=MIN|team14=ICE|team15=IGE|team16=PIR|\n\n|win_FIR=16|draw_FIR=14 |loss_FIR=0\n|win_DEF=14|draw_DEF=16|loss_DEF=0\n|win_RUB=9 |draw_RUB=19|loss_RUB=2\n|win_VAJ=10 |draw_VAJ=15 |loss_VAJ=5\n|win_PED=7|draw_PED=19 |loss_PED=4\n|win_WIN=6|draw_WIN=18|loss_WIN=6\n|win_PES=6|draw_PES=17|loss_PES=7\n|win_NEM=7 |draw_NEM=15|loss_NEM=8\n|win_GUL=4 |draw_GUL=21 |loss_GUL=5\n|win_WAS=5 |draw_WAS=19 |loss_WAS=6 |status_WAS=D\n|win_DEM=7 |draw_DEM=13 |loss_DEM=10\n|win_TEX=4 |draw_TEX=19 |loss_TEX=7\n|win_MIN=3 |draw_MIN=19 |loss_MIN=8\n|win_ICE=1 |draw_ICE=20 |loss_ICE=9\n|win_IGE=3 |draw_IGE=15 |loss_IGE=12\n|win_PIR=3 |draw_PIR=11 |loss_PIR=16\n\n|winpoints=1\n|drawpoints=0.5\n|losspoints=0\n\n|team_header=Engine\n|name_DEF=Defenchess |short_DEF=DEF\n|name_DEM=Demolito |short_DEM=DEM\n|name_WIN=Winter |short_WIN=WIN\n|name_PIR=Pirarucu |short_PIR=PIR\n|name_IGE=Igel |short_IGE=IGE\n|name_ICE=iCE |short_ICE=ICE\n|name_MIN=Minic |short_MIN=MIN\n|name_PES=PeSTO |short_PES=PES\n|name_FIR=Fire|short_FIR=FIR\n|name_TEX=Texel|short_TEX=TEX\n|name_RUB=RubiChess|short_RUB=RUBP\n|name_NEM=Nemorino|short_NEM=NEM\n|name_GUL=Gull|short_GUL=GUL\n|name_PED=Pedone|short_PED=PED\n|name_WAS=Wasp|short_WAS=WAS\n|name_VAJ=Vajolet|short_VAJ=VAJ\n\n}}\n\n===CPU League One===\nDuring testing for League One, three engines (Booot, Chiron, and ChessBrainVB) did not play because they did not run on [[Wine (software)|Wine]], the [[compatibility layer]] that TCEC is using to run Windows programs on Linux. One further engine (former champion [[Jonny]]) crashed and was not updated in time. As a result, the 5th to 8th-placed engines from League Two, Pedone, Nemorino, Winter and PeSTO, promoted as lucky losers.\n\nIn League One itself, Xiphos, which had just missed out on promotion in Season 16, vaulted to an early lead after scoring five wins with no losses. However, after this bright start, it failed to score more wins. This allowed former Division Premier engine Ethereal to seize first place, in spite of a loss to Komodo MCTS. Fellow competitors Fire and Komodo MCTS also amassed more wins than Xiphos, and by the midway point had overtaken it in the standings. By the final double round robin, Ethereal, Fire and Komodo MCTS had more or less secured a playoff spot. Xiphos, who had yet to lose, was barely holding on to fourth place, with rofChade and Defenchess both breathing down its neck. When it lost a crucial game to Fire, it allowed rofChade to pull even, with Defenchess half a point further back. Xiphos knocked Defenchess out of contention with a head-to-head win, but with rofChade having the superior tiebreaks (by number of wins), it needed to either hope for Fire to beat rofChade or to beat Vajolet in its last game. When both games ended drawn, Xiphos finished fifth, again just missing out on promotion.\n\nFor the other engines, Laser, which had pipped Xiphos to a playoff spot last season, was able to remain unbeaten until the final double round robin. However, it collapsed in that round, losing three games (plus forfeited a fourth due to a crash). Winter scored likely the biggest upset of the league by defeating rofChade once, but the rest of the division was not kind to it and fellow lucky losers Nemorino and PeSTO, with all three engines placing in the bottom four. Former Division Premier engine Fizbo, which had been forced to run at a much slower speed because it was not able to utilize all the hardware available to it, finished solidly last, five points off the pace. \n\n{{#invoke:Sports table|main|style=WDL\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|show_matches=false\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|update=complete\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|source=[https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=cpul1&game=1]\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|for_against_style=none\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|res_col_header=Q\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|result1=WC \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|result2=WC \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|result3=WC \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|result4=WC \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|col_WC=green1 |text_WC={{nowrap|Advance to Playoff}}\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|team1=ETH|team2=FIR|team3=KMC|team4=ROF|team5=XIP|team6=DEF|team7=RUB|team8=AND|team9=LAS|team10=ARA|team11=VAJ|team12=PED|team13=NEM|team14=WIN|team15=PES|team16=FIZ|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_ETH=21|draw_ETH=38 |loss_ETH=1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_FIR=18|draw_FIR=42|loss_FIR=0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_KMC=13 |draw_KMC=47|loss_KMC=0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_ROF=13 |draw_ROF=44 |loss_ROF=3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_XIP=11|draw_XIP=48 |loss_XIP=1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_DEF=13|draw_DEF=42|loss_DEF=5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_RUB=10|draw_RUB=46|loss_RUB=4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_AND=8 |draw_AND=49|loss_AND=3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_LAS=6 |draw_LAS=50 |loss_LAS=4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_ARA=12 |draw_ARA=37|loss_ARA=11\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_PED=9 |draw_PED=37 |loss_PED=14\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_VAJ=8 |draw_VAJ=40|loss_VAJ=12\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_NEM=6 |draw_NEM=32 |loss_NEM=22\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_WIN=6 |draw_WIN=30 |loss_WIN=24\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_PES=3 |draw_PES=34 |loss_PES=23\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_FIZ=0 |draw_FIZ=30 |loss_FIZ=30\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|winpoints=1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|drawpoints=0.5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|losspoints=0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|team_header=Engine\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_FIR=Fire |short_FIR=FIR\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_PED=Pedone |short_PED=PED\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_RUB=RubiChess |short_RUB=RUB\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_FIZ=Fizbo |short_FIZ=FIZ\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_PES=PeSTO |short_PES=PES\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_WIN=Winter |short_WIN=WIN\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_NEM=Nemorino |short_NEM=NEM\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_AND=Andscacs |short_AND=AND\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_ETH=Ethereal|short_ETH=ETH\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_VAJ=Vajolet2 |short_VAJ=VAJ\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_KMC=KomodoMCTS|short_KMC=KMCP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_DEF=Defenchess|short_DEF=DEF\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_LAS=Laser|short_LAS=LAS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_XIP=Xiphos|short_XIP=XIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_ARA=Arasan|short_ARA=ARA\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_ROF=rofChade|short_ROF=ROF\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n}}\n\n===GPU league===\nThe GPU league was cancelled because only two participants met all the uniqueness criteria: ChessFighter and ScorpioNN.{{cn|date=March 2020}} Both engines automatically qualified to play against the top four engines from the CPU league one.\n\n===Playoff===\nFire convincingly won the playoff for Premier Division in spite of no longer being under development. It finished with a +7 score, defeating all its rivals except ScorpioNN at least once. Komodo MCTS and ScorpioNN both lost two games, but finished comfortably in the top four, with wins against rofChade and ChessFighter. League One winner Ethereal stumbled badly in the playoffs, losing first to rofChade and then to Fire. As a result, the final promotion spot was closely contested. In the penultimate round rofChade temporarily pulled even with Ethereal by defeating ChessFighter, but Ethereal drew against Komodo MCTS to remain half a point ahead. It came down to the direct head-to-head encounter in the final round. rofChade needed to defeat Ethereal with the black pieces, which would've let it qualify because of its superior head-to-head score. However, it did not make any headway, and Ethereal squeaked into Premier Division, half a point ahead of rofChade.\n\n{{#invoke:Sports table|main|style=WDL\n\n|show_matches=false\n|update=complete\n\n|source=[https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=playofffordivp&game=1]\n|for_against_style=none\n|res_col_header=Q\n|result1=WC \n|result2=WC \n|result3=WC \n|result4=WC \n|col_WC=green1 |text_WC={{nowrap|Advance to Premier Division}}\n|team1=FIR|team2=KMC|team3=SCO|team4=ETH|team5=ROF|team6=CF\n\n|win_FIR=7 |draw_FIR=13 |loss_DEF=0\n|win_KMC=6 |draw_KMC=12 |loss_KMC=2\n|win_SCO=3 |draw_SCO=15 |loss_SCO=2\n|win_ETH=1 |draw_ETH=17 |loss_ETH=2\n|win_ROF=3 |draw_ROF=12 |loss_ROF=5\n|win_CF=0  |draw_CF=11 |loss_CF=9\n\n|winpoints=1\n|drawpoints=0.5\n|losspoints=0\n\n|team_header=Engine\n|name_FIR=Fire|short_FIR=FIR\n|name_KMC=Komodo MCTS|short_KMC=KMC\n|name_SCO=ScorpioNN |short_SCO=SCO\n|name_ETH=Ethereal|short_ETH=ETH\n|name_ROF=rofChade |short_ROF=ROF\n|name_CF=ChessFighter |short_CF=CF\n}}\n\n===Premier Division===\nIn an unprecedented move, TCEC played all the CPU-CPU matches first, to minimize rental costs for the GPUs.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.chessdom.com/tcec-season-17-premier-division-is-now-live/|title=TCEC Season 17 \u2013 Premier Division is now live!|publisher=Chessdom|date=17 March 2020|accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref><ref>https://imgur.com/zAHOIMR</ref>\n\nIn the CPU-CPU matches, defending champion [[Stockfish (chess)|Stockfish]] steamrolled its rivals. It defeated [[Houdini (chess)|Houdini]] and Ethereal twice, scoring six wins in the process, one more than the rest of the division combined. Houdini, which had not been updated for over two years, was further handicapped by only being able to make use of 64 of the 176 available [[thread (computing)|threads]], and was last after the double round robin. Komodo MCTS was the only engine not to lose to Stockfish, but it also failed to score any wins. Fellow promoted engine Fire performed surprisingly well, scoring two wins while losing only to Stockfish. Combined with its run through the lower divisions as well as in Season 16, it set a new TCEC record of 124 games without losing.\n\nIn the CPU-GPU and GPU-GPU matches, S15 runner-up AllieStein took an early lead over S15 third-place finisher Lc0, scoring 4 wins to Lc0's 2 in the first round robin. It looked as though the season 15 result, in which AllieStein pipped Lc0 to second place in spite of the latter not losing any games, would be repeated. However, a dramatic second round robin saw Ethereal playing kingmaker. First it defeated AllieStein, then it was defeated by Lc0 after it blundered a 7-man [[endgame tablebase]] draw. After this stroke of good fortune Lc0 went on a winning streak to take the lead, defeating Stoofvlees, Komodo, and Komodo MCTS successively. However Ethereal continued to play kingmaker, this time losing to AllieStein in the reverse game and then defeating Lc0 after the latter blundered in a complicated position (diagram). Lc0 finally effectively eliminated Alliestein with a head-to-head win, which also put her ahead of Stockfish in first place, but the drama was not over as she lost another game to Komodo. This allowed Stockfish the chance to at least tie Lc0 at the top of the standings with a win over Stoofvlees, but it failed to do so. In the end, Lc0 won the premier division for the first time in spite of losing its first premier division games since [[TCEC Season 14|Season 14]], while Stockfish failed to finish first for the first time since Season 10. \n\nIn the fight to avoid relegation, Houdini, ScorpioNN and Komodo MCTS were quickly left behind, but the final slot was closely-contested. Fire failed to score any more wins after its initial two, but it also only lost two more games, to AllieStein and Lc0. Ethereal, with its giant-slaying performance against Lc0 and AllieStein, had taken a surprising fourth place, ahead of traditional powerhouse [[Komodo (chess)|Komodo]]. Stoofvlees had played extremely optimistically and suffered losses to the top three competitors as a result, but scored a head-to-head win against both Komodo and Ethereal while not conceding any other losses. By the final games, Ethereal had successfully reached safety, but Komodo was in real danger of relegating after finding itself in a tight position against Lc0. If it lost and Stoofvlees drew with Stockfish in the final game, then it would find itself in a three-way tie with Stoofvlees and Fire, and relegated because it had the worst head-to-head score amongst the three.

The defending champion is [[Stockfish (chess)|Stockfish]], which defeated [[AllieStein]] in the [[TCEC Season 16]] superfinal.\n\nSeason 17 featured for the first time two separate leagues, one for [[GPU]]-based engines and one for [[CPU]]-based engines. TCEC also doubled the computing power available to CPU engines, from 44 cores to 88.\n\n==Overview==\nIn keeping with its identity as a competition run at long time controls on high-end hardware,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.chessblog.com/2013/08/tcec-computer-chess-championship-new.html|title = TCEC Computer Chess Championship New Season starts August 26th|last = Kosteniuk |first = Alexandra|date = August 15, 2013|website = Chess News Blog|accessdate = October 25, 2013|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131025063745/http://www.chessblog.com/2013/08/tcec-computer-chess-championship-new.html|archivedate = October 25, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = https://nypost.com/2013/06/09/engine-super-bowl/|title = Engine Super Bowl|last = Soltis|first = Andy|date = June 9, 2013|website = New York Post|accessdate = October 25, 2013}}</ref> TCEC secured a hardware upgrade for the competing CPU engines.<ref name=\"S17Info\">{{citeweb|url=http://www.chessdom.com/tcec-s17-detailed-information/|title=TCEC S17 \u2013 detailed information|publisher=Chessdom|date=21 December 2019}}</ref> Among other changes, the number of cores available is doubled from 44 to 88, the operating system used is now [[Linux]], and Syzygy [[endgame tablebases]] are now cached directly in the RAM for faster access. Because this upgrade advantages CPU engines compared to GPU engines, TCEC split the qualification paths to Premier Division by introducing separate leagues for CPU and GPU engines. While an upgrade to the GPU servers is being secured, the CPU leagues are played first.\n\n===Structure===\nFor CPU engines, there will first be a Qualification League consisting of 16 engines, followed by League 2 (16 engines) and League 1 (16 engines). In the Qualification League the top 6 engines promote. In League 2 the top 4 engines promote. The engines in each league are seeded based on their performances in previous seasons. For GPU engines, there will be one league only, with up to 16 competitors. The top 2 GPU engines will then contest a playoff against the top 4 CPU engines in League 1, with the four highest-placing engines promoting to Premier Division.\n\nPremier Division is also expanded from 8 engines to 10. Six engines - [[Stockfish (chess)|Stockfish]], [[Komodo (chess)|Komodo]], [[Houdini (chess)|Houdini]], [[Leela Chess Zero]], [[AllieStein]], and Stoofvlees - are seeded directly to Premier Division, based on their top 6 finishes in the previous season. Finally, the top two engines in Premier Division qualify for the 100-game superfinal match.\n\n==Results==\n===CPU Qualification League===\nAfter not competing for five seasons, Season 11 Div 3 engine Defenchess trailblazed the qualification league. It scored 18 wins while conceding no losses, finishing 3.5 points clear at the top. It was the only undefeated engine. Demolito and Winter also locked up two of the promotion spots smoothly, but the remaining three slots were closely contested. Among the competitors Igel was the only engine to not lose to Defenchess and Demolito, but it lost to bottom-half engines FabChess and Topple. Comparatively, iCE was whitewashed by Defenchess and Igel, but it turned in a strong performance against its other rivals, losing only one other game to Winter. Pirarucu went through a tense moment when it lost to Winter in the penultimate round; however it pulled out a win with Black against Topple to promote. 7th-placed Minic was in a promotion spot all the way up to the final round, when it lost to Gogobello while iCE beat Counter. This left the two tied at 17.5 points. Minic had the better [[Sonneborn\u2013Berger score]], but it also had one crash, and the number of crashes was the first tiebreak. Nonetheless, in a stroke of good fortune for Minic (and 8th-placed PeSTO), the League Two engines chess22k and [[Fritz (chess)|Fritz]] crashed three times during testing for the division. By TCEC rules, if this happened, the author(s) would have to update the engine or it is disqualified. chess22k's and Fritz's authors were not able to update the engines in time, resulting in Minic and PeSTO promoting as lucky losers.<ref>https://imgur.com/GHNF1Zu</ref>\n\n{{#invoke:Sports table|main|style=WDL\n\n|show_matches=false\n|update=complete\n\n|source=[https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=ql&game=1]\n|for_against_style=none\n|res_col_header=Q\n|result1=WC \n|result2=WC \n|result3=WC \n|result4=WC \n|result5=WC \n|result6=WC \n|col_WC=green1 |text_WC={{nowrap|Advance to League Two}}\n|result7=WB \n|result8=WB \n|col_WB=blue1 |text_WB={{nowrap|Advance to League Two (see text)}}\n|team1=DEF|team2=DEM|team3=WIN|team4=PIR|team5=IGE|team6=ICE|team7=MIN|team8=PES|team9=MAR|team10=GOG|team11=TOP|team12=COU|team13=FAB|team14=TUC|team15=ASY|team16=CHE|\n\n|win_DEF=18 |draw_DEF=12 |loss_DEF=0\n|win_DEM=12 |draw_DEM=17 |loss_DEM=1\n|win_WIN=14 |draw_WIN=12 |loss_WIN=4\n|win_PIR=10 |draw_PIR=16 |loss_PIR=4\n|win_IGE=10 |draw_IGE=16 |loss_IGE=4\n|win_ICE=10 |draw_ICE=15 |loss_ICE=5\n|win_MIN=10 |draw_MIN=15 |loss_MIN=5\n|win_PES=8 |draw_PES=17 |loss_PES=5\n|win_MAR=8 |draw_MAR=16 |loss_MAR=6\n|win_GOG=8 |draw_GOG=14 |loss_GOG=8\n|win_TOP=8 |draw_TOP=12 |loss_TOP=10\n|win_COU=4 |draw_COU=12 |loss_COU=14\n|win_FAB=3 |draw_FAB=14 |loss_FAB=13\n|win_TUC=4 |draw_TUC=9 |loss_TUC=17\n|win_ASY=2 |draw_ASY=13 |loss_ASY=15\n|win_CHE=2 |draw_CHE=8 |loss_CHE=20\n\n|winpoints=1\n|drawpoints=0.5\n|losspoints=0\n\n|team_header=Engine\n|name_DEF=Defenchess |short_DEF=DEF\n|name_DEM=Demolito |short_DEM=DEM\n|name_WIN=Winter |short_WIN=WIN\n|name_PIR=Pirarucu |short_PIR=PIR\n|name_IGE=Igel |short_IGE=IGE\n|name_ICE=iCE |short_ICE=ICE\n|name_MIN=Minic |short_MIN=MIN\n|name_PES=PeSTO |short_PES=PES\n|name_MAR=Marvin |short_MAR=MAR\n|name_GOG=Gogobello |short_GOG=GOG\n|name_TOP=Topple |short_TOP=TOP\n|name_COU=Counter |short_COU=COU\n|name_FAB=FabChess |short_FAB=FAB\n|name_TUC=Tucano |short_TUC=TUC\n|name_ASY=Asymptote |short_ASY=ASY\n|name_CHE=Cheese |short_CHE=CHE\n\n}}\n\n===CPU League Two===\nFormer Premier Division engine Fire won League Two. It had been relegated in [[TCEC Season 16|the previous season]] because its developer had submitted a drastically different neural network-based version that turned out to be significantly weaker. This season, the original, traditional engine played, and it dominated with an undefeated 22/28 (16 wins and 12 draws). It defeated seven engines, including fourth-place Vajolet, 2-0. Second placed Defenchess also turned in a strong performance, finishing with an undefeated 20.5/28 (13 wins and 15 draws). For the other promoted engines, Winter and PeSTO performed surprisingly well, comfortably finishing above their peers in 7th and 8th respectively. The remaining five promoted engines occupied the bottom five spots, and were all relegated along with Wasp (which crashed three times).\n\nAfter the division concluded, in a repeat of testing for League Two, four League One engines either pulled out or did not run on the new Linux operating system, resulting in the 5th-8th placed engines in League One promoting.\n\n{{#invoke:Sports table|main|style=WDL\n\n|show_matches=false\n|update=complete\n\n|source=[https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=l1&game=1], see also [https://tcecbayeselo.chessdom.org/2020/01/25/tcec-season-17-league2-game-240-defenchess-2-3_dev-igel-2-3-1/] for table with Wasp's score zeroed out\n|for_against_style=none\n|res_col_header=Q\n|result1=WC \n|result2=WC \n|result3=WC \n|result4=WC \n|col_WC=green1 |text_WC={{nowrap|Advance to League One}}\n|result5=WB\n|result6=WB\n|result7=WB\n|result8=WB\n|col_WB=blue1|text_WB={{nowrap|Advance to League One (see text)}}\n|team1=FIR|team2=DEF|team3=RUB|team4=VAJ|team5=PED|team6=NEM|team7=WIN|team8=PES|team9=GUL|team10=WAS|team11=TEX|team12=DEM|team13=MIN|team14=ICE|team15=IGE|team16=PIR|\n\n|win_FIR=16|draw_FIR=14 |loss_FIR=0\n|win_DEF=14|draw_DEF=16|loss_DEF=0\n|win_RUB=9 |draw_RUB=19|loss_RUB=2\n|win_VAJ=10 |draw_VAJ=15 |loss_VAJ=5\n|win_PED=7|draw_PED=19 |loss_PED=4\n|win_WIN=6|draw_WIN=18|loss_WIN=6\n|win_PES=6|draw_PES=17|loss_PES=7\n|win_NEM=7 |draw_NEM=15|loss_NEM=8\n|win_GUL=4 |draw_GUL=21 |loss_GUL=5\n|win_WAS=5 |draw_WAS=19 |loss_WAS=6 |status_WAS=D\n|win_DEM=7 |draw_DEM=13 |loss_DEM=10\n|win_TEX=4 |draw_TEX=19 |loss_TEX=7\n|win_MIN=3 |draw_MIN=19 |loss_MIN=8\n|win_ICE=1 |draw_ICE=20 |loss_ICE=9\n|win_IGE=3 |draw_IGE=15 |loss_IGE=12\n|win_PIR=3 |draw_PIR=11 |loss_PIR=16\n\n|winpoints=1\n|drawpoints=0.5\n|losspoints=0\n\n|team_header=Engine\n|name_DEF=Defenchess |short_DEF=DEF\n|name_DEM=Demolito |short_DEM=DEM\n|name_WIN=Winter |short_WIN=WIN\n|name_PIR=Pirarucu |short_PIR=PIR\n|name_IGE=Igel |short_IGE=IGE\n|name_ICE=iCE |short_ICE=ICE\n|name_MIN=Minic |short_MIN=MIN\n|name_PES=PeSTO |short_PES=PES\n|name_FIR=Fire|short_FIR=FIR\n|name_TEX=Texel|short_TEX=TEX\n|name_RUB=RubiChess|short_RUB=RUBP\n|name_NEM=Nemorino|short_NEM=NEM\n|name_GUL=Gull|short_GUL=GUL\n|name_PED=Pedone|short_PED=PED\n|name_WAS=Wasp|short_WAS=WAS\n|name_VAJ=Vajolet|short_VAJ=VAJ\n\n}}\n\n===CPU League One===\nDuring testing for League One, three engines (Booot, Chiron, and ChessBrainVB) did not play because they did not run on [[Wine (software)|Wine]], the [[compatibility layer]] that TCEC is using to run Windows programs on Linux. One further engine (former champion [[Jonny]]) crashed and was not updated in time. As a result, the 5th to 8th-placed engines from League Two, Pedone, Nemorino, Winter and PeSTO, promoted as lucky losers.\n\nIn League One itself, Xiphos, which had just missed out on promotion in Season 16, vaulted to an early lead after scoring five wins with no losses. However, after this bright start, it failed to score more wins. This allowed former Division Premier engine Ethereal to seize first place, in spite of a loss to Komodo MCTS. Fellow competitors Fire and Komodo MCTS also amassed more wins than Xiphos, and by the midway point had overtaken it in the standings. By the final double round robin, Ethereal, Fire and Komodo MCTS had more or less secured a playoff spot. Xiphos, who had yet to lose, was barely holding on to fourth place, with rofChade and Defenchess both breathing down its neck. When it lost a crucial game to Fire, it allowed rofChade to pull even, with Defenchess half a point further back. Xiphos knocked Defenchess out of contention with a head-to-head win, but with rofChade having the superior tiebreaks (by number of wins), it needed to either hope for Fire to beat rofChade or to beat Vajolet in its last game. When both games ended drawn, Xiphos finished fifth, again just missing out on promotion.\n\nFor the other engines, Laser, which had pipped Xiphos to a playoff spot last season, was able to remain unbeaten until the final double round robin. However, it collapsed in that round, losing three games (plus forfeited a fourth due to a crash). Winter scored likely the biggest upset of the league by defeating rofChade once, but the rest of the division was not kind to it and fellow lucky losers Nemorino and PeSTO, with all three engines placing in the bottom four. Former Division Premier engine Fizbo, which had been forced to run at a much slower speed because it was not able to utilize all the hardware available to it, finished solidly last, five points off the pace. \n\n{{#invoke:Sports table|main|style=WDL\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|show_matches=false\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|update=complete\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|source=[https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=cpul1&game=1]\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|for_against_style=none\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|res_col_header=Q\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|result1=WC \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|result2=WC \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|result3=WC \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|result4=WC \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|col_WC=green1 |text_WC={{nowrap|Advance to Playoff}}\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|team1=ETH|team2=FIR|team3=KMC|team4=ROF|team5=XIP|team6=DEF|team7=RUB|team8=AND|team9=LAS|team10=ARA|team11=VAJ|team12=PED|team13=NEM|team14=WIN|team15=PES|team16=FIZ|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_ETH=21|draw_ETH=38 |loss_ETH=1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_FIR=18|draw_FIR=42|loss_FIR=0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_KMC=13 |draw_KMC=47|loss_KMC=0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_ROF=13 |draw_ROF=44 |loss_ROF=3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_XIP=11|draw_XIP=48 |loss_XIP=1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_DEF=13|draw_DEF=42|loss_DEF=5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_RUB=10|draw_RUB=46|loss_RUB=4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_AND=8 |draw_AND=49|loss_AND=3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_LAS=6 |draw_LAS=50 |loss_LAS=4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_ARA=12 |draw_ARA=37|loss_ARA=11\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_PED=9 |draw_PED=37 |loss_PED=14\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_VAJ=8 |draw_VAJ=40|loss_VAJ=12\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_NEM=6 |draw_NEM=32 |loss_NEM=22\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_WIN=6 |draw_WIN=30 |loss_WIN=24\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_PES=3 |draw_PES=34 |loss_PES=23\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|win_FIZ=0 |draw_FIZ=30 |loss_FIZ=30\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|winpoints=1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|drawpoints=0.5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|losspoints=0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|team_header=Engine\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_FIR=Fire |short_FIR=FIR\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_PED=Pedone |short_PED=PED\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_RUB=RubiChess |short_RUB=RUB\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_FIZ=Fizbo |short_FIZ=FIZ\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_PES=PeSTO |short_PES=PES\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_WIN=Winter |short_WIN=WIN\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_NEM=Nemorino |short_NEM=NEM\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_AND=Andscacs |short_AND=AND\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_ETH=Ethereal|short_ETH=ETH\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_VAJ=Vajolet2 |short_VAJ=VAJ\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_KMC=KomodoMCTS|short_KMC=KMCP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_DEF=Defenchess|short_DEF=DEF\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_LAS=Laser|short_LAS=LAS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_XIP=Xiphos|short_XIP=XIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_ARA=Arasan|short_ARA=ARA\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|name_ROF=rofChade|short_ROF=ROF\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n}}\n\n===GPU league===\nThe GPU league was cancelled because only two participants met all the uniqueness criteria: ChessFighter and ScorpioNN.{{cn|date=March 2020}} Both engines automatically qualified to play against the top four engines from the CPU league one.\n\n===Playoff===\nFire convincingly won the playoff for Premier Division in spite of no longer being under development. It finished with a +7 score, defeating all its rivals except ScorpioNN at least once. Komodo MCTS and ScorpioNN both lost two games, but finished comfortably in the top four, with wins against rofChade and ChessFighter. League One winner Ethereal stumbled badly in the playoffs, losing first to rofChade and then to Fire. As a result, the final promotion spot was closely contested. In the penultimate round rofChade temporarily pulled even with Ethereal by defeating ChessFighter, but Ethereal drew against Komodo MCTS to remain half a point ahead. It came down to the direct head-to-head encounter in the final round. rofChade needed to defeat Ethereal with the black pieces, which would've let it qualify because of its superior head-to-head score. However, it did not make any headway, and Ethereal squeaked into Premier Division, half a point ahead of rofChade.\n\n{{#invoke:Sports table|main|style=WDL\n\n|show_matches=false\n|update=complete\n\n|source=[https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=17&div=playofffordivp&game=1]\n|for_against_style=none\n|res_col_header=Q\n|result1=WC \n|result2=WC \n|result3=WC \n|result4=WC \n|col_WC=green1 |text_WC={{nowrap|Advance to Premier Division}}\n|team1=FIR|team2=KMC|team3=SCO|team4=ETH|team5=ROF|team6=CF\n\n|win_FIR=7 |draw_FIR=13 |loss_DEF=0\n|win_KMC=6 |draw_KMC=12 |loss_KMC=2\n|win_SCO=3 |draw_SCO=15 |loss_SCO=2\n|win_ETH=1 |draw_ETH=17 |loss_ETH=2\n|win_ROF=3 |draw_ROF=12 |loss_ROF=5\n|win_CF=0  |draw_CF=11 |loss_CF=9\n\n|winpoints=1\n|drawpoints=0.5\n|losspoints=0\n\n|team_header=Engine\n|name_FIR=Fire|short_FIR=FIR\n|name_KMC=Komodo MCTS|short_KMC=KMC\n|name_SCO=ScorpioNN |short_SCO=SCO\n|name_ETH=Ethereal|short_ETH=ETH\n|name_ROF=rofChade |short_ROF=ROF\n|name_CF=ChessFighter |short_CF=CF\n}}\n\n===Premier Division===\nIn an unprecedented move, TCEC played all the CPU-CPU matches first, to minimize rental costs for the GPUs.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.chessdom.com/tcec-season-17-premier-division-is-now-live/|title=TCEC Season 17 \u2013 Premier Division is now live!|publisher=Chessdom|date=17 March 2020|accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref><ref>https://imgur.com/zAHOIMR</ref>\n\nIn the CPU-CPU matches, defending champion [[Stockfish (chess)|Stockfish]] steamrolled its rivals. It defeated [[Houdini (chess)|Houdini]] and Ethereal twice, scoring six wins in the process, one more than the rest of the division combined. Houdini, which had not been updated for over two years, was further handicapped by only being able to make use of 64 of the 176 available [[thread (computing)|threads]], and was last after the double round robin. Komodo MCTS was the only engine not to lose to Stockfish, but it also failed to score any wins. Fellow promoted engine Fire performed surprisingly well, scoring two wins while losing only to Stockfish. Combined with its run through the lower divisions as well as in Season 16, it set a new TCEC record of 124 games without losing.\n\nIn the CPU-GPU and GPU-GPU matches, S15 runner-up AllieStein took an early lead over S15 third-place finisher Lc0, scoring 4 wins to Lc0's 2 in the first round robin. It looked as though the season 15 result, in which AllieStein pipped Lc0 to second place in spite of the latter not losing any games, would be repeated. However, a dramatic second round robin saw Ethereal playing kingmaker. First it defeated AllieStein, then it was defeated by Lc0 after it blundered a 7-man [[endgame tablebase]] draw. After this stroke of good fortune Lc0 went on a winning streak to take the lead, defeating Stoofvlees, Komodo, and Komodo MCTS successively. However Ethereal continued to play kingmaker, this time losing to AllieStein in the reverse game and then defeating Lc0 after the latter blundered in a complicated position (diagram). Lc0 finally effectively eliminated Alliestein with a head-to-head win, which also put her ahead of Stockfish in first place, but the drama was not over as she lost another game to Komodo. This allowed Stockfish the chance to at least tie Lc0 at the top of the standings with a win over Stoofvlees, but it failed to do so. In the end, Lc0 won the premier division for the first time in spite of losing its first premier division games since [[TCEC Season 14|Season 14]], while Stockfish failed to finish first for the first time since Season 10. \n\nIn the fight to avoid relegation, Houdini, ScorpioNN and Komodo MCTS were quickly left behind, but the final slot was closely-contested. Fire failed to score any more wins after its initial two, but it also only lost two more games, to AllieStein and Lc0. Ethereal, with its giant-slaying performance against Lc0 and AllieStein, had taken a surprising fourth place, ahead of traditional powerhouse [[Komodo (chess)|Komodo]]. Stoofvlees had played extremely optimistically and suffered losses to the top three competitors as a result, but scored a head-to-head win against both Komodo and Ethereal while not conceding any other losses. By the final games, Ethereal had successfully reached safety, but Komodo was in real danger of relegating after finding itself in a tight position against Lc0. If it lost and Stoofvlees drew with Stockfish in the final game, then it would find itself in a three-way tie with Stoofvlees and Fire, and relegated because it had the worst head-to-head score amongst the three. However, when Lc0 pushed too hard and blundered in a time scramble, the game turned into a win for Komodo that put it ahead of Ethereal and left Fire to relegate.\n\n{{Chess diagram\n|fen=r1q1rb1k/pb4pp/3p1n1N/2p3Q1/3nP3/P1N1B1P1/1P3PBP/R2R2K1 b - - 4 24|align=tright|header=Ethereal\u2013Leela Chess Zero|footer=In this complicated position, White is in the midst of an attack against Black's king, but has no forced win.

The approval was based on the pivotal study E4599 (conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group), which demonstrated a two-month improvement in overall survival in patients treated with bevacizumab (Sandler, et al. NEJM 2004). A preplanned analysis of histology in E4599 demonstrated a four-month median survival benefit with bevacizumab for people with adenocarcinoma (Sandler, et al. JTO 2010); adenocarcinoma represents approximately 85% of all non-squamous cell carcinomas of the lung.\n\nA subsequent European clinical trial, AVAiL, was first reported in 2009 and confirmed the significant improvement in progression-free survival shown in E4599 (Reck, et al. Ann. Oncol. 2010). An overall survival benefit was not demonstrated in patients treated with bevacizumab; however, this may be due to the more limited use of bevacizumab as maintenance treatment in AVAiL versus E4599 (this differential effect is also apparent in the European vs US trials of bevacizumab in colorectal cancer: Tyagi and Grothey, Clin Colorectal Cancer, 2006). As an anti-angiogenic agent, there is no mechanistic rationale for stopping bevacizumab before disease progression. Stated another way, the survival benefits achieved with bevacizumab can only be expected when used in accordance with the clinical evidence: continued until disease progression or treatment-limiting side effects.\n\nAnother large European-based clinical trial with bevacizumab in lung cancer, AVAPERL, was reported in October 2011 (Barlesi, et al. ECCM 2011). First-line patients were treated with bevacizumab plus cisplatin/pemetrexed for four cycles, and then randomized to receive maintenance treatment with either bevacizumab/pemetrexed or bevacizumab alone until disease progression. Maintenance treatment with bevacizumab/pemetrexed demonstrated a 50% reduction in risk of progression vs bevacizumab alone (median PFS: 10.2 vs 6.6 months). Maintenance treatment with bevacizumab/pemetrexed did not confer a significant increase in overall survival vs bevacizumab alone on follow up analysis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Barlesi F, Scherpereel A, Gorbunova V, Gervais R, Vikstr\u00f6m A, Chouaid C, Chella A, Kim JH, Ahn MJ, Reck M, Pazzola A, Kim HT, Aerts JG, Morando C, Loundou A, Groen HJ, Rittmeyer A | title = Maintenance bevacizumab-pemetrexed after first-line cisplatin-pemetrexed-bevacizumab for advanced nonsquamous nonsmall-cell lung cancer: updated survival analysis of the AVAPERL (MO22089) randomized phase III trial | journal = Annals of Oncology | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 1044\u201352 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24585722 | doi = 10.1093/annonc/mdu098 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\nThe National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends bevacizumab as standard first-line treatment in combination with any platinum-based chemotherapy, followed by maintenance bevacizumab until disease progression.{{mcn|date=March 2020}} Higher doses are usually given with carboplatin-based chemotherapy, whereas the lower dose is usually given with cisplatin-based chemotherapy.{{mcn|date=March 2020}}\n\n=== Breast cancer ===\nIn December 2010, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) notified its intention to remove the breast cancer indication (approved in 2008) from bevacizumab, saying that it had not been shown to be safe and effective in [[breast cancer]] patients. The combined data from four different clinical trials showed that bevacizumab neither prolonged overall survival nor slowed disease progression sufficiently to outweigh the risk it presents to patients. This only prevented Genentech from marketing bevacizumab for breast cancer. Doctors are free to prescribe bevacizumab off label, although insurance companies are less likely to approve off-label treatments.<ref name=\"FDA breast1\">{{cite press release | title=FDA begins process to remove breast cancer indication from Avastin label | publisher=U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) | date=2010-12-16 | url=https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm237172.htm | access-date=2010-12-17 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216181330/https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm237172.htm | archive-date=2010-12-16 }}\n</ref><ref name=\"Breast Cancer\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/17/health/policy/17drug.html|title=F.D.A.

The data from two large randomized studies showed no benefit in preventing the cancer from returning and a potential to cause harm in this setting.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Van Cutsem E, Lambrechts D, Prenen H, Jain RK, Carmeliet P | title = Lessons from the adjuvant bevacizumab trial on colon cancer: what next? | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u20134 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21115866 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2010.32.2701 | df =  }}</ref>\n\n=== Lung cancer ===\nIn 2006, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved bevacizumab for use in first-line advanced nonsquamous [[Non-small-cell lung carcinoma|non-small cell lung cancer]] in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy. The approval was based on the pivotal study E4599 (conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group), which demonstrated a two-month improvement in overall survival in patients treated with bevacizumab (Sandler, et al. NEJM 2004). A preplanned analysis of histology in E4599 demonstrated a four-month median survival benefit with bevacizumab for people with adenocarcinoma (Sandler, et al. JTO 2010); adenocarcinoma represents approximately 85% of all non-squamous cell carcinomas of the lung.\n\nA subsequent European clinical trial, AVAiL, was first reported in 2009 and confirmed the significant improvement in progression-free survival shown in E4599 (Reck, et al. Ann. Oncol. 2010). An overall survival benefit was not demonstrated in patients treated with bevacizumab; however, this may be due to the more limited use of bevacizumab as maintenance treatment in AVAiL versus E4599 (this differential effect is also apparent in the European vs US trials of bevacizumab in colorectal cancer: Tyagi and Grothey, Clin Colorectal Cancer, 2006). As an anti-angiogenic agent, there is no mechanistic rationale for stopping bevacizumab before disease progression. Stated another way, the survival benefits achieved with bevacizumab can only be expected when used in accordance with the clinical evidence: continued until disease progression or treatment-limiting side effects.\n\nAnother large European-based clinical trial with bevacizumab in lung cancer, AVAPERL, was reported in October 2011 (Barlesi, et al. ECCM 2011). First-line patients were treated with bevacizumab plus cisplatin/pemetrexed for four cycles, and then randomized to receive maintenance treatment with either bevacizumab/pemetrexed or bevacizumab alone until disease progression. Maintenance treatment with bevacizumab/pemetrexed demonstrated a 50% reduction in risk of progression vs bevacizumab alone (median PFS: 10.2 vs 6.6 months). Maintenance treatment with bevacizumab/pemetrexed did not confer a significant increase in overall survival vs bevacizumab alone on follow up analysis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Barlesi F, Scherpereel A, Gorbunova V, Gervais R, Vikstr\u00f6m A, Chouaid C, Chella A, Kim JH, Ahn MJ, Reck M, Pazzola A, Kim HT, Aerts JG, Morando C, Loundou A, Groen HJ, Rittmeyer A | title = Maintenance bevacizumab-pemetrexed after first-line cisplatin-pemetrexed-bevacizumab for advanced nonsquamous nonsmall-cell lung cancer: updated survival analysis of the AVAPERL (MO22089) randomized phase III trial | journal = Annals of Oncology | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 1044\u201352 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24585722 | doi = 10.1093/annonc/mdu098 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\nThe National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends bevacizumab as standard first-line treatment in combination with any platinum-based chemotherapy, followed by maintenance bevacizumab until disease progression.{{mcn|date=March 2020}} Higher doses are usually given with carboplatin-based chemotherapy, whereas the lower dose is usually given with cisplatin-based chemotherapy.{{mcn|date=March 2020}}\n\n=== Breast cancer ===\nIn December 2010, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) notified its intention to remove the breast cancer indication (approved in 2008) from bevacizumab, saying that it had not been shown to be safe and effective in [[breast cancer]] patients. The combined data from four different clinical trials showed that bevacizumab neither prolonged overall survival nor slowed disease progression sufficiently to outweigh the risk it presents to patients. This only prevented Genentech from marketing bevacizumab for breast cancer.

The June 2011 meeting of the FDA's oncologic drug advisory committee was the last step in an appeal by the drug's maker.
