The next two spacewalks rewired the station's power system, preparing it to support the addition of European and Japanese science modules by future shuttle crews. The fourth spacewalk was added to allow the crew to coax and retract a stubborn solar panel to fold up accordion-style into its box. Discovery also delivered a new crew member and more than two tons of equipment and supplies to the station. Almost two tons of items no longer needed on the station returned to Earth with STS-116. Mission duration was 12 days, 20 hours and 45 minutes.\n\n=== STS-127 [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]] (July 15\u201331, 2009) ===\n\nPolansky was the commander of the [[STS-127]] mission, which launched aboard [[Space Shuttle Endeavour]] on July 15, 2009 from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. During this 16-day mission, the seven-member crew installed the Japanese Exposed Facility onto the ISS, and perform five spacewalks. Polansky returned to Earth with his crew on July 31, 2009. Following fellow astronaut [[Michael J. Massimino]]'s lead, Mark began posting public updates and replies to [[Twitter]] on May 7, 2009 during his training for STS-127, and continued to do so throughout the mission.<ref>{{cite web | last=Polansky | first=Mark | title=Astro_127 | publisher=[[Twitter]] | date=2009-05-07 | url=https://twitter.com/Astro_127 | accessdate = 2009-05-28}}</ref>\n\n==Organizations==\nMember of the [[Society of Experimental Test Pilots]], [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]], and the [[Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association]].\n\n==Awards and honors==\nDistinguished Graduate of the USAF Test Pilot School (1987).

The Shuttle spent seven days docked to the station while Destiny was attached and three spacewalks were conducted to complete its assembly. The crew also relocated a docking port, and delivered supplies and equipment to the resident [[Expedition 1]] crew. Mission duration was 12 days, 21 hours, 20 minutes.\n\n=== STS-116 [[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]] (December 9\u201322, 2006) ===\n\nThe seven-member crew on this 12-day mission continued construction of the ISS outpost by adding the [[P5 Truss Segment]] during the first of four spacewalks. The next two spacewalks rewired the station\u2019s power system, preparing it to support the addition of European and Japanese science modules by future shuttle crews. The fourth spacewalk was added to allow the crew to coax and retract a stubborn solar panel to fold up accordion-style into its box. Discovery also delivered a new crew member and more than two tons of equipment and supplies to the station. Almost two tons of items no longer needed on the station returned to Earth with STS-116. Mission duration was 12 days, 20 hours and 45 minutes.\n\n=== STS-127 [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]] (July 15\u201331, 2009) ===\n\nPolansky was the commander of the [[STS-127]] mission, which launched aboard [[Space Shuttle Endeavour]] on July 15, 2009 from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. During this 16-day mission, the seven-member crew installed the Japanese Exposed Facility onto the ISS, and perform five spacewalks. Polansky returned to Earth with his crew on July 31, 2009. Following fellow astronaut [[Michael J. Massimino]]'s lead, Mark began posting public updates and replies to [[Twitter]] on May 7, 2009 during his training for STS-127, and continued to do so throughout the mission.<ref>{{cite web | last=Polansky | first=Mark | title=Astro_127 | publisher=[[Twitter]] | date=2009-05-07 | url=https://twitter.com/Astro_127 | accessdate = 2009-05-28}}</ref>\n\n==Organizations==\nMember of the [[Society of Experimental Test Pilots]], [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]], and the [[Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association]].\n\n==Awards and honors==\nDistinguished Graduate of the USAF Test Pilot School (1987). Distinguished Graduate of USAF [[Undergraduate Pilot Training]] (1980). Recipient of the USAF Flying Training Award (1980). Awarded [[Air Force Meritorious Service Medal]] and [[Air Force Commendation Medal]] with two Oak Leaf Clusters.\n\nIn his hometown of Edison, NJ, a park is named for him on Grove Ave., across the street from his alma mater of [[J. P. Stevens High School]]. Recently in June 2006 the township officials unveiled a sign for Mark Polansky Park while his friends and family were there with him for this presentation. He frequently returns to Edison for programs at the local library for the kids.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Asian American astronauts]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*{{Twitter|name=Mark Polansky}}\n*[http://www.spacefacts.de/bios/astronauts/english/polansky_mark.htm Spacefacts biography of Mark L.

He is the Warden of the West and the [[Lord Paramount]] of Westerlands, the wealthiest region of the Seven Kingdoms, and was twice the [[head of government|Hand of the King]], making him one of the most powerful political figures in Westerosi history. Tywin's cruelty towards his youngest son [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], whom he has despised since the latter's childhood for being a [[dwarfism|dwarf]], is a primary influence on Tyrion's character arc in both the novels and television show.\n\nTywin is portrayed by veteran English actor [[Charles Dance]] in the [[HBO]] television adaptation and has received acclaim from critics for his performance and characterization.<ref name=HBOCast>{{cite web | url=http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/index.html#/game-of-thrones/cast-and-crew/tywin-lannister/bio/tywin-lannister.html |title=''Game of Thrones'' Cast and Crew: Tywin Lannister played by Charles Dance |publisher=[[HBO]] | accessdate=December 25, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/index.html#/game-of-thrones/cast-and-crew/index.html|title=The Official Website for the HBO Series Game of Thrones - Season 4|work=HBO}}</ref><ref name=\"Telegraph.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/game-of-thrones/9961779/Game-of-Thrones-Charles-Dance-interview-I-treat-Peter-Dinklage-appallingly.html|title=Game of Thrones, Charles Dance interview: \u2018I treat Peter Dinklage appallingly\u2019|date=31 March 2013|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref name=\"james20160411\">{{Cite magazine |last=James |first=Clive |date=2016-04-18 |title=Thrones of Blood |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/04/18/the-raw-appeal-of-game-of-thrones |magazine=The New Yorker |language=en |issn=0028-792X |access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref>\n\n== Character description ==\nTywin Lannister is Lord of [[Casterly Rock]], Shield of [[Lannisport]], and Warden of the West.

When she died giving birth to their dwarf son [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], it is said that \"the best part of Tywin died with her\". He never remarried. Tywin holds Tyrion responsible for Joanna's death. When Tywin discovered that the young Tyrion had secretly eloped and married Tysha, a peasant's daughter, he had Tyrion's marriage forcefully [[annul]]led, telling him that the entire love affair was a plot by Jaime to get Tyrion to lose his virginity, his love being nothing more than a hired prostitute.  Tywin then had his personal guards [[gang-rape]] Tysha in front of Tyrion and later forced Tyrion to rape her last.  [[Aerys II Targaryen]] appointed Tywin  Hand of the King. The relationship between Aerys and Tywin grew bitter,{{citation needed|reason=bitterness is an interpretation of the author and is not cited in either the book or the show.|date=May 2019}} and he resigned as Hand after Aerys appointed Tywin's first son [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] to the Kingsguard, directly denying him as Tywin's heir. Aerys increasingly engaged in behavior for which he was known as the Mad King.\n\nDuring [[Robert Baratheon]]'s rebellion, Tywin remained neutral until Robert had all but won the war.

Despite his contempt for Tyrion, Tywin views his kidnapping as a slight against his family and sends [[Gregor Clegane]] to raid Catelyn's homeland, the [[Riverlands (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Riverlands]]. He raises a host of almost 40,000 men, half of whom are given to Jaime to besiege the Riverlands' capital Riverrun. Tywin's half of the force battle a Northern host led by [[Roose Bolton]] at the Battle of the Green Fork, but in the meantime [[Robb Stark]]'s men rout Jaime's army and take him prisoner. Tywin is named Hand of the King by the new king, his grandson [[Joffrey Baratheon]], but Tywin decides to remain in the Riverlands to continue the campaign against the Starks, sending Tyrion to King's Landing as acting Hand in his stead.\n\n==== ''A Clash of Kings'' ====\n{{see also|A Clash of Kings}}\nTywin retreats to Harrenhal, using it as a base for the war in the Riverlands. When Joffrey's uncle and rival claimant [[Renly Baratheon]] is killed and Joffrey's other uncle [[Stannis Baratheon]] besieges Storm's End, Tywin decides to use the distraction to march west in pursuit of Robb's army. Robb intends for Tywin's army to be gradually dismantled by the long march, but Robb's uncle Ser Edmure Tully, unaware of the plan, confronts Tywin's forces at the Battle of the Fords. Although Tywin suffers heavy losses, the delay in his march allows him to receive word that Stannis is now marching on King's Landing. Tywin quickly leads the army on King's Landing, joining forces with Renly's former bannermen House Tyrell along the way, and arrives at King's Landing in time to force Stannis to retreat. Joffrey subsequently declares Tywin the \"Savior of the City\".\n\n==== ''A Storm of Swords'' ====\n{{see also|A Storm of Swords}}\nTywin assumes his role as Hand of the King, demoting Tyrion to Master of Coin. He forces Tyrion to marry [[Sansa Stark]], though his efforts to have Cersei wed to Willas Tyrell are rebuffed. Having learned that Robb has invalidated a marriage proposal to House Frey by marrying Jeyne Westerling, Tywin enters into communications with Lord Walder Frey and Roose Bolton (who has lost faith in Robb after [[Theon Greyjoy]]'s capture of Robb's castle Winterfell). The three conspire to have Robb and his army slaughtered while camped at The Twins for Edmure Tully's wedding, and the War of Five Kings results in victory for House Lannister. However, Joffrey is poisoned soon after during his own wedding.   Tyrion is accused of the murder, ultimately being found guilty and sentenced to death. Jaime and [[Varys]] release Tyrion from his cell, Jaime confessing that he felt compelled to do so for lying about Tysha, Tyrion's first wife, who had been wrongly stated by Tywin to be a prostitute and [[gang-rape]]d by Tywin's guards.  Enraged, Tyrion enters Tywin's quarters through a secret tunnel, only to find his former mistress [[Shae (character)|Shae]] in Tywin's bed.

Instead, Robb Stark leads his forces to Riverrun, where he defeats and captures Jaime Lannister.\n\nWhen Joffrey Baratheon ascends as king, he executes the former Hand, Eddard Stark and names Tywin as his Hand. \nTywin who currently has only half of his army is now engaged in multiple conflicts, with Robb Stark in the North and Stannis & Renly Baratheon in the South.\n\nTywin cannot make peace with the Baratheon brothers as they are staking for the claim of Kingship of the Seven Kingdoms.\nEddard's  execution by Joffery on the other hand has prevented Tywin from what would have been the best option of suing for peace with Northern Lord and Riverrun. Realizing this Tywin sends Tyrion to King's Landing as acting Hand, while he decides to regroup at Harrenhal with all his forces and continue the campaign in the Riverlands against Robb Stark who now hold his son captive.\n\n====Season 2====\nTywin and the Westermen regroup at Harrenhal and start establishing order. Unaware of Arya Stark's true identity, he takes her as his cupbearer and is impressed by her quick wit. Arya Stark, on the other hand, is seen to be contemplating to kill Tywin, but does not proceed due to lack of opportunity.\nShe is, however, able to gather information on the plan of his council members on their next course of action.\n\nOn Petyr Baelish's suggestion, Tywin establishes an alliance with House Tyrell as they have the required army and the largest supply of grain and livestock.\nHis council members advise that his grandson King Joffery and Joffrey's mother Cersei flee the capital as Stannis Baratheon and his forces will be attacking. Tywin overrules his council members, stating that Joffery needs to hold his ground as no one will respect a king who runs away.\n\nTywin leads his forces along with their new allies of House Tyrell on the city and arrives just in time to defeat Stannis' remaining forces. After the battle, Tywin is named \"Savior of the City\".\n\n====Season 3====\nTywin harshly denies Tyrion his request to be named as heir to Casterly Rock, but does acquiesce to naming him Master of Coin. When he learns of Olenna Tyrell's plot to have Loras Tyrell wed Sansa Stark, he arranges to have Tyrion and Cersei marry Sansa and Loras respectively \u2014 though only succeeds with establishing Tyrion's marriage to Sansa. Later on, Tywin lectures Joffrey about how to rule as king when his grandson demands a report on his council meetings. Soon after Tyrion and Sansa's wedding, Tywin forms an alliance with Robb Starks' dissatisfied bannermen \u2014 Walder Frey and Roose Bolton \u2014 to successfully carry out the slaughtering of the Stark forces at \"The Red Wedding\"; in the ensuing massacre, Roose kills Robb while his mother Catelyn and wife Talisa are both killed as well. When news of Robb's death reaches the Lannisters, Tyrion quickly deduces that his father masterminded the event; Tywin confirms this and  shrewdly observes that this means the Freys will get all the credit, but also all the blame \u2014 since the Northerners will never forget nor forgive such a terrible crime. Tywin senses that his son finds the action dishonorable, but insists it was done to protect the family and end the war. He then reminds Tyrion of his duty to impregnate Sansa, explaining that a man who puts family first will always triumph. When Tyrion asks his father whether he has ever put the family's interests ahead of his own, Tywin retorts to have done so from the day Tyrion was born: he wanted to throw his newborn son into the sea, out of rage and grief at the death of his wife, but instead let Tyrion live and ended up raising him as his son \u2014 because he is a Lannister.\n\n====Season 4====\nTywin has the Stark ancestral sword Ice melted down into two swords, one of which he gives to Jaime, though he disowns him after Jaime refuses to resign from the Kingsguard to become Tywin's heir. When Tyrion is accused of poisoning Joffrey, Tywin asks Prince Oberyn Martell to serve as one of the judges in Tyrion's trial. Though Oberyn despises Tywin for ordering the death of his sister, niece and nephew during the sack of King's Landing, he agrees when Tywin offers him justice against their murderer, Ser Gregor Clegane. Tywin also presses Cersei to wed Loras in order to use House Tyrell's wealth to pay off the Crown's debts to the Iron Bank of Braavos, but is forced to back down when Cersei threatens to reveal her incestuous affair with Jaime. Tywin has an affair with the prostitute Shae, formerly Tyrion's mistress. Tyrion discovers this during his escape from King's Landing and strangles Shae before confronting Tywin on the privy. When Tyrion admits that he loved Shae, Tywin repeatedly dismisses her as a whore, prompting Tyrion to shoot him with a crossbow, killing him.\n\n====Season 5====\nTywin's body lies in state in the Great Sept of Baelor before his burial, with Jaime and Cersei the first to pay their respects. Tywin's death upsets the balance of power in King's Landing, namely by allowing the rise to power of the High Sparrow and the Faith Militant.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{ASOIAF}}\n{{Forbes Fictional 15}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lannister, Tywin}}\n[[Category:A Song of Ice and Fire characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional advisors]]\n[[Category:Fictional assassinated people]]\n[[Category:Literary characters introduced in 1996]]\n[[Category:Fictional child abusers]]\n[[Category:Fictional generals]]\n[[Category:Fictional lords and ladies]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional regents]]\n[[Category:Fictional war veterans]]\n[[Category:Fictional military strategists]]\n[[Category:Male characters in literature]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n[[Category:Male literary villains]]\n[[Category:Patricide in fiction]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Character in A Song of Ice and Fire}}\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Tywin Lannister\n| series      = [[A Song of Ice and Fire]] ''character'' <br> [[Game of Thrones]] \n| colour      = #D09916\n| portrayer   = [[Charles Dance]]\n| creator     = [[George R.

He is the Warden of the West and the [[Lord Paramount]] of Westerlands, the wealthiest region of the Seven Kingdoms, and was twice the [[head of government|Hand of the King]], making him one of the most powerful political figures in Westerosi history. Tywin's cruelty towards his youngest son [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], whom he has despised since the latter's childhood for being a [[dwarfism|dwarf]], is a primary influence on Tyrion's character arc in both the novels and television show.\n\nTywin is portrayed by veteran English actor [[Charles Dance]] in the [[HBO]] television adaptation and has received acclaim from critics for his performance and characterization.<ref name=HBOCast>{{cite web | url=http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/index.html#/game-of-thrones/cast-and-crew/tywin-lannister/bio/tywin-lannister.html |title=''Game of Thrones'' Cast and Crew: Tywin Lannister played by Charles Dance |publisher=[[HBO]] | accessdate=December 25, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/index.html#/game-of-thrones/cast-and-crew/index.html|title=The Official Website for the HBO Series Game of Thrones - Season 4|work=HBO}}</ref><ref name=\"Telegraph.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/game-of-thrones/9961779/Game-of-Thrones-Charles-Dance-interview-I-treat-Peter-Dinklage-appallingly.html|title=Game of Thrones, Charles Dance interview: \u2018I treat Peter Dinklage appallingly\u2019|date=31 March 2013|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref name=\"james20160411\">{{Cite magazine |last=James |first=Clive |date=2016-04-18 |title=Thrones of Blood |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/04/18/the-raw-appeal-of-game-of-thrones |magazine=The New Yorker |language=en |issn=0028-792X |access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref>\n\n== Character description ==\nTywin Lannister is Lord of [[Casterly Rock]], Shield of [[Lannisport]], and Warden of the West.\n\nWhen Lannister bannermen the Reynes and Tarbecks eventually revolted against the Lannisters' rule, Tywin personally led the Lannister army in exterminating the rebellious vassals, placing the bodies of their entire families on display at Casterly Rock.{{citation needed|reason=Likely a lot of oversimplified sources written by and for fans of the TV series word it like this, but \"The World of Ice and Fire\" has most of the Reynes being drowned in flooded mines.

When she died giving birth to their dwarf son [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], it is said that \"the best part of Tywin died with her\". He never remarried. Tywin holds Tyrion responsible for Joanna's death. When Tywin discovered that the young Tyrion had secretly eloped and married Tysha, a peasant's daughter, he had Tyrion's marriage forcefully [[annul]]led, telling him that the entire love affair was a plot by Jaime to get Tyrion to lose his virginity, his love being nothing more than a hired prostitute.  Tywin then had his personal guards [[gang-rape]] Tysha in front of Tyrion and later forced Tyrion to rape her last.  [[Aerys II Targaryen]] appointed Tywin  Hand of the King. The relationship between Aerys and Tywin grew bitter,{{citation needed|reason=bitterness is an interpretation of the author and is not cited in either the book or the show.|date=May 2019}} and he resigned as Hand after Aerys appointed Tywin's first son [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] to the Kingsguard, directly denying him as Tywin's heir. Aerys increasingly engaged in behavior for which he was known as the Mad King.\n\nDuring [[Robert Baratheon]]'s rebellion, Tywin remained neutral until Robert had all but won the war.

Tywin has an affair with the prostitute Shae, formerly Tyrion's mistress. Tyrion discovers this during his escape from King's Landing and strangles Shae before confronting Tywin on the privy. When Tyrion admits that he loved Shae, Tywin repeatedly dismisses her as a whore, prompting Tyrion to shoot him with a crossbow, killing him.\n\n====Season 5====\nTywin's body lies in state in the Great Sept of Baelor before his burial, with Jaime and Cersei the first to pay their respects. Tywin's death upsets the balance of power in King's Landing, namely by allowing the rise to power of the High Sparrow and the Faith Militant.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{ASOIAF}}\n{{Forbes Fictional 15}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lannister, Tywin}}\n[[Category:A Song of Ice and Fire characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional advisors]]\n[[Category:Fictional assassinated people]]\n[[Category:Literary characters introduced in 1996]]\n[[Category:Fictional child abusers]]\n[[Category:Fictional generals]]\n[[Category:Fictional lords and ladies]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional regents]]\n[[Category:Fictional war veterans]]\n[[Category:Fictional military strategists]]\n[[Category:Male characters in literature]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n[[Category:Male literary villains]]\n[[Category:Patricide in fiction]]\n", "name_user": "112.196.185.5", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eCharacter description)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tywin_Lannister"}

Immediately after this, they follow him ([[Luke 5]]:4\u201311). The [[Gospel of John]] gives a comparable account of \"The First Disciples\" ([[John 1]]:35\u201342). In John, the readers are told that it was two disciples of [[John the Baptist]] (Andrew and an unnamed disciple) who heard John the Baptist announce Jesus as the \"[[Lamb of God]]\" and then followed Jesus.

Peter initially refused to let Jesus wash his feet, but when Jesus threatened him with: \"If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me\", Peter replied: \"Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head\" ([[John 13]]:2\u201311). The [[foot washing|washing of feet]] is often repeated in the [[service of worship]] on [[Maundy Thursday]] by some [[Christian denominations]].\n\nThe three [[Synoptic Gospels]] all mention that, when Jesus was arrested, one of his companions cut off the ear of a servant of the [[High Priest of Israel]] ([[Matthew 26]]:51, [[Mark 14]]:47, [[Luke 22]]:50). The Gospel of John also includes this event and names Peter as the swordsman and [[Malchus]] as the victim ([[John 18]]:10).

The three Synoptics and John describe the three denials as follows:\n# A denial when a female servant of the high priest spots Simon Peter, saying that he had been with Jesus. According to Mark (but not in all manuscripts), \"the rooster crowed\". Only Luke and John mention a fire by which Peter was warming himself among other people: according to Luke, Peter was \"sitting\"; according to John, he was \"standing\".\n# A denial when Simon Peter had gone out to the gateway, away from the firelight, but the same servant girl (Mark) or another servant girl (Matthew) or a man (Luke and also John, for whom, though, this is the third denial) told the bystanders he was a follower of Jesus. According to John, \"the rooster crowed\". The Gospel of John places the second denial while Peter was still warming himself at the fire, and gives as the occasion of the third denial a claim by someone to have seen him in the garden of [[Gethsemane]] when [[arrest of Jesus|Jesus was arrested]].\n# A denial came when Peter's Galilean accent was taken as proof that he was indeed a disciple of Jesus. According to Matthew, Mark and Luke, \"the rooster crowed\". Matthew adds that it was his [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]] that gave him away as coming from Galilee. Luke deviates slightly from this by stating that, rather than a crowd accusing Simon Peter, it was a third individual. John does not mention the Galilean accent.\n\nIn the Gospel of Luke is a record of Christ telling Peter: \"Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.\" In a reminiscent<ref name=\"May Metzger\">May, Herbert G. and Bruce M.

After seeing the graveclothes he goes home, apparently without informing the other disciples.{{Bibleref2c|Lk.|24:1\u201312}}\n\nIn the [[John 21|final chapter]] of the Gospel of John, Peter, in one of the resurrection appearances of Jesus, [[Restoration of Peter|three times affirmed his love for Jesus]], balancing his threefold denial, and Jesus reconfirmed Peter's position. The Church of the Primacy of St. Peter on the [[Sea of Galilee]] is seen as the traditional site where Jesus Christ appeared to his disciples after his resurrection and, according to Catholic tradition, established Peter's supreme jurisdiction over the Christian church.\n\n===Leader of the early church===\n[[File:Liberation of Saint Peter by Giovanni Lanfranco-BMA.jpg|thumb|left|''The Liberation of St. Peter'' from prison by an angel, by [[Giovanni Lanfranco]], 1620\u201321]]\n\nPeter was considered along with James the Just and John the Apostle as pillars of the Church.<ref>Galatians 2:9</ref> Legitimised by Jesus' appearance, Peter assumed leadership of the group of early followers, forming the Jerusalem ''ekkl\u0113sia'' mentioned by Paul.{{sfn|Pagels|2005|p=45}}{{sfn|L\u00fcdemann|\u00d6zen|1996|p=116}} He was soon eclipsed in this leadership by James the Just, \"the Brother of the Lord.\"{{sfn|Pagels|2005|pp=45\u201346}}{{sfn|L\u00fcdemann|\u00d6zen|1996|pp=116\u2013117}} According to L\u00fcdemann, this was due to the discussions about the [[Paul and Judaism|strictness of adherence]] to the Jewish Law, when the more conservative faction of James the Just<ref>{{cite journal |title=James the Just in History and Tradition: Perspectives of Past and Present Scholarship (Part I) |journal=Currents in Research |volume=5 |pages=73\u2013122 |last=Myllykoski |first=Matti |publisher=Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies, Finland |quote=James the Just, the brother of Jesus, is known from the New Testament as the chief apostle of the Torah-obedient Christians.|doi=10.1177/1476993X06068700 |year=2006 }}</ref> took the overhand over the more liberal position of Peter, who soon lost influence.{{sfn|L\u00fcdemann|\u00d6zen|1996|pp=116\u2013117}}{{refn|group=note|At the [[Council of Jerusalem]] (c. 50), the early Church, Paul and the leaders of the Jerusalem church met and decided to embrace Gentile converts.

Harrington]], who suggests that Peter was an unlikely symbol of stability. While he was one of the first disciples called and was the spokesman for the group, Peter is also the exemplar of \"little faith\". In {{Bibleref2|Matthew|14}}, Peter will soon have Jesus say to him, \"O you of little faith, why did you doubt?\", and he will eventually deny Jesus three times.

This \"dies imperii\" (regnal day anniversary) was an important one, exactly ten years after Nero ascended to the throne, and it was \"as usual\" accompanied by much bloodshed. Traditionally, [[Roman Empire|Roman]] authorities sentenced him to death by [[crucifixion]].

In the Latin translation, Peter asks Jesus, \"Quo vadis?\" He replies, \"''Romam eo iterum crucifigi\"'' (\"I am going to Rome to be crucified again\").

[[Augustine of Hippo]] says in his Sermon 295: \"One day is assigned for the celebration of the martyrdom of the two apostles. But those two were one. Although their martyrdom occurred on different days, they were one.\"\n\nThis is also the feast of both [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] in the calendar of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].\n\nIn the [[Roman Rite]], the feast of the [[Chair of Saint Peter]] is celebrated on 22 February, and the anniversary of the dedication of the two [[Papal Basilica|papal basilicas]] of [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's]] and [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|Saint Paul outside the Walls]] is held on 18 November.\n\nBefore [[Pope John XXIII]]'s revision in 1960, the Roman Calendar also included on 18 January another feast of the Chair of Saint Peter (denominated the Chair of Saint Peter in Rome, while the February feast was then called that of the Chair of Saint Peter at Antioch), and on 1 August the feast of [[Liberation of Saint Peter|Saint Peter in Chains]].\n\nIn the Orthodox [[Daily Office]] every Thursday throughout the year is dedicated to the Holy Apostles, including St. Peter. There are also two [[feast day]]s in the year which are dedicated to him:\n\n* June 29, [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul]]\u2014This is a major feast day and is preceded by a period of Lenten fasting known as the [[Apostles' Fast]].\n* January 16, [[Liberation of Saint Peter|Veneration of the Precious Chains of the Holy and All-Glorious Apostle Peter]]\u2014commemorating both the chains which {{Bibleref2|Acts|12:1\u201311}} says miraculously fell from him, and the chains in which he was held before his [[martyr]]dom by [[Nero]].\n\n==Primacy of Peter==\nChristians of different theological backgrounds are in disagreement as to the exact significance of Peter's ministry. For instance: \n* Catholics view Peter as the first pope. The Catholic Church asserts that Peter's ministry, conferred upon him by Jesus of Nazareth in the gospels, lays down the theological foundation for the pope's exercise of pastoral authority over the Church.\n* Eastern Orthodox also believe that Peter's ministry points to an underlying theology wherein a special primacy ought to be granted to Peter's successors above other Church leaders but see this as merely a \"primacy of honor\", rather than the right to exercise pastoral authority.\n* Protestant denominations assert that Peter's apostolic work in Rome does not imply a connection between him and the papacy.\nSimilarly, historians of various backgrounds also offer differing interpretations of the Apostle's presence in Rome.\n\n===Catholic Church===\n{{Main|Primacy of Simon Peter|Papal primacy}}\n[[File:Statua di San Pietro realizzata da Giuseppe De Fabris - Piazza di San Pietro.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of St. Peter in [[St. Peter's Square]] at the Vatican]]\n\nAccording to Catholic belief, Simon Peter was distinguished by Jesus to hold the [[Primacy of Simon Peter|first place of honor and authority]]. Also in Catholic belief, Peter was, as the first Bishop of Rome, the first [[Pope]]. Furthermore, they consider every Pope to be Peter's successor and the rightful superior of all other [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]].<ref name=CEPope>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Pope|author=Joyce, G.

He believes the meaning of the original Aramaic is very clear: that \"Kepha\" was the Aramaic word for \"rock\", and that it was also the name by which Christ called Peter.<ref name=Time/>\n\nYet, Cullmann sharply rejects the Catholic claim that Peter began the papal succession. He writes: \"In the life of Peter there is no starting point for a chain of succession to the leadership of the church at large.\" While he believes the Matthew text is entirely valid and is in no way spurious, he says it cannot be used as \"warrant of the papal succession.\"<ref name=Time>{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,890753-1,00.html |title=Religion: Peter & the Rock |publisher=Time |date=1953-12-07 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref> Cullmann concludes that while Peter ''was'' the original head of the apostles, Peter was not the founder of any visible church succession.<ref name=\"Time\" />\n\nThere are other Protestant scholars who also partially defend the historical Catholic position about \"Rock.\"<ref>D. A. Carson in ''The Expositor's Bible Commentary'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1984).</ref> Taking a somewhat different approach from Cullman, they point out that the Gospel of Matthew was not written in the classical Attic form of Greek, but in the Hellenistic [[Koine Greek|Koine dialect]] in which there is no distinction in meaning between ''petros'' and ''petra''. Moreover, even in Attic Greek, in which the regular meaning of ''petros'' was a smallish \"stone,\" there are instances of its use to refer to larger rocks, as in [[Sophocles]], ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'' v. 1595, where ''petros'' refers to a boulder used as a landmark, obviously something more than a pebble. In any case, a ''petros''/''petra'' distinction is irrelevant considering the Aramaic language in which the phrase might well have been spoken. In Greek, of any period, the feminine noun ''petra'' could not be used as the given name of a male, which may explain the use of ''Petros'' as the Greek word with which to translate Aramaic ''Kepha''.<ref name=\"keating\" />\n\nYet, still other Protestant scholars believe that Jesus in fact ''did'' mean to single out Peter as the very rock which he will build upon, but that the passage does nothing to indicate a continued succession of Peter's implied position. They assert that Matthew uses the demonstrative pronoun ''taute'', which allegedly means \"this very\" or \"this same\", when he refers to the rock on which Jesus' church will be built. He also uses the Greek word for \"and\", ''kai''. It is alleged that when a demonstrative pronoun is used with ''kai'', the pronoun refers back to the preceding noun. The second rock Jesus refers to must then be the same rock as the first one; and if Peter is the first rock he must also be the second.<ref>''Jesus, Peter & the Keys: A Scriptural Handbook on the Papacy''</ref>\n\nUnlike Oscar Cullmann, [[Confessional Lutherans]] and many other Protestant apologists agree that it's meaningless to elaborate the meaning of \"Rock\" by looking at the Aramaic language. While the Jews spoke mostly Aramaic at home, in public they usually spoke Greek. The few Aramaic words spoken by Jesus in public were unusual, which is why they are noted as such. And most importantly the New Testament was revealed in Koine Greek, ''not'' Aramaic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203191915/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf|url-status=dead|title=''The Doctrine of Church and Ministry in the Life of the Church Today''|archive-date=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203192344/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Cross-Cultural And Multicultural Ministry In the New Testament|archive-date=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.graceway.com/articles/article_017.html|title=Some Thoughts on Matthew 16:18|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nLutheran historians even report that the Catholic church itself didn't, at least unanimously, regard Peter as the rock until the 1870s:\n{{quote|Rome's rule for explaining the Scriptures and determining doctrine is the [[Profession of faith (Catholic Church)#Tridentine Creed|Creed]] of [[Pius IV]].

Another title used for Peter is ''Coryphaeus'', which could be translated as \"Choir-director\", or lead singer.<ref>[[John Meyendorff]], et al. (1963), ''The Primacy of Peter in the Orthodox Church'' ([[St. Vladimir's Seminary]] Press, Crestwood NY, {{ISBN|978-0-88141-125-6}})</ref> The church recognizes Apostle Peter's leadership role in the [[early church]], especially in the very early days at Jerusalem, but does not consider him to have had any \"princely\" role over his fellow Apostles.\n\nThe New Testament is not seen by the Orthodox as supporting any extraordinary authority for Peter with regard to faith or morals. The Orthodox also hold that Peter did not act as leader at the [[Council of Jerusalem]], but as merely one of a number who spoke. The final decision regarding the non-necessity of [[circumcision]] (and certain prohibitions) was spelled out by [[James, the Brother of the Lord]] (though Catholics hold James merely reiterated and fleshed out what Peter had said, regarding the latter's earlier divine revelation regarding the inclusion of Gentiles).\n\nEastern and Oriental Orthodox do not recognize the Bishop of Rome as the successor of St. Peter but the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] sends a delegation each year to Rome to participate in the celebration of the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul. In the [[declaration of Ravenna|Ravenna Document]] of 13 October 2007, the representatives of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] agreed that \"Rome, as the Church that 'presides in love' according to the phrase of St. Ignatius of Antioch (\"To the Romans\", Prologue), occupied the first place in the ''taxis'', and that the bishop of Rome was therefore the ''protos'' among the patriarchs, if the Papacy unites with the Orthodox Church. They disagree, however, on the interpretation of the historical evidence from this era regarding the prerogatives of the bishop of Rome as ''protos'', a matter that was already understood in different ways in the first millennium.\"\n\nWith regard to Jesus' words to Peter, \"Thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church\", the Orthodox hold Christ is referring to the confession of faith, ''not'' the person of Peter as that upon which he will build the church. This is allegedly shown by the fact that the original Greek uses the feminine demonstrative pronoun when he says \"upon this rock\" (\u03c4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c4\u1fc3 \u03c4\u1fc7 \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u1fb3); whereas, grammatically, if he had been referring to Peter, he would allegedly have used the masculine.<ref>Holy Apostles Convent (1999) ''The Orthodox New Testament'', Vol. I: The Holy Gospels (Dormition Skete, Buena Vista CO, {{ISBN|0-944359-13-2}}) p. 105</ref> This \"gender distinction\" argument is also held by some Protestants.\n\n===Syriac Orthodox Church===\n[[File:Antonio de Bellis - La liberazione di San Pietro.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''Saint Peter and the angel'', by [[Antonio de Bellis]] ]] \nThe Fathers of the Syriac Orthodox Church tried to give a theological interpretation to the primacy of Apostle Peter. They were fully convinced of the unique office of Peter in the primitive Christian community. [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem]], [[Aphrahat]] and [[Maruthas]] who were supposed to have been the best exponents of the early [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac tradition]] unequivocally acknowledge the office of Peter.\n\nThe Syriac Fathers, following the rabbinic tradition, call Jesus \"Kepha\" for they see \"rock\" in the Old Testament as a messianic Symbol (yet the Old Maronite Syriacs of Lebanon still refer to Saint Peter as \"Saint Simon the Generous\" or Simon Karam\"). When Christ gave his own name \"Kepha\" to Simon he was giving him participation in the person and office of Christ. Christ who is the Kepha and shepherd made Simon the chief shepherd in his place and gave him the very name Kepha and said that on Kepha he would build the Church. [[Aphrahat]] shared the common Syriac tradition. For him Kepha is in fact another name of Jesus, and Simon was given the right to share the name. The person who receives somebody else's name also obtains the rights of the person who bestows the name. Aphrahat makes the stone taken from Jordan a type of Peter. He wrote: \"Jesus son of Nun set up the stones for a witness in Israel; Jesus our Saviour called Simon Kepha Sarirto and set him as the faithful witness among nations.\"\n\nAgain he wrote in his commentary on [[Deuteronomy]] that [[Moses]] brought forth water from \"rock\" (Kepha) for the people and Jesus sent Simon Kepha to carry his teachings among nations. God accepted him and made him the foundation of the Church and called him Kepha. When he speaks about the transfiguration of Christ he calls him [[Simon Peter]], the foundation of the Church. Ephrem also shared the same view. The Armenian version of [[De Virginitate]] records that [[Peter the rock]] shunned honour. A ''mimro'' of Efrem found in Holy Week Liturgy points to the importance of Peter.\n\nBoth [[Aphrahat]] and [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem]] represent the authentic tradition of the Syrian Church. The different orders of liturgies used for sanctification of Church buildings, marriage, ordination, ''et cetera'', reveal that the primacy of Peter is a part of living faith of the Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.syrianchurch.org/Articles/PrimacyofStPeter.htm |title=\"Primacy of St. Peter\" \u2013 by Dr. Thomas Athanasius |publisher=Syrianchurch.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref>\n\n===New Apostolic Church===\nThe [[New Apostolic Church]], which believes in the re-established Apostle ministry, sees Peter as the first [[Chief Apostle]].\n\n===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===\n[[File:Saint Peter by Gr\u00e3o Vasco.jpg|thumb|''Saint Peter'' by [[Gr\u00e3o Vasco|Vasco Fernandes]], 1506]]\n\n[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] teaches that Peter was the first leader of the early Christian church after the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Both demonstrate a high quality of cultured and urban Greek, at odds with the linguistic skill that would ordinarily be expected of an [[Aramaic]]-speaking fisherman, who would have learned Greek as a second or third language. The textual features of these two epistles are such that a majority of scholars doubt that they were written by the same hand. Some scholars argue that theological differences imply different sources, and point to the lack of references to 2&nbsp;Peter among the early Church Fathers.\n\n[[Daniel B. Wallace]] (who maintains that Peter was the author) writes that, for many scholars, \"the issue of authorship is already settled, at least negatively: the apostle Peter did not write this letter\" and that \"the vast bulk of NT scholars adopts this perspective without much discussion\". However, he later states, \"Although a very strong case has been made against Petrine authorship of 2 Peter, we believe it is deficient. ...Taken together, these external and internal arguments strongly suggest the traditional view, viz., that Peter was indeed the author of the second epistle which bears his name.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20031209164253/http://www.bible.org/docs/soapbox/2petotl.htm ''Second Peter: Introduction, Argument, and Outline''].

The Roman historian [[Tacitus]] and the biographer [[Suetonius]] do both record that Nero persecuted Christians, and Tacitus dates this to immediately after the fire that burned Rome in 64. Christian tradition, for example Eusebius of Caesarea (''History'' book 2, 24.1), has maintained that Peter was killed in Nero's persecution, and thus had to assume that the Roman persecution alluded to in First Peter must be this Neronian persecution.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/> On the other hand, many modern scholars argue that First Peter refers to the persecution of Christians in Asia Minor during the reign of the emperor [[Domitian]] (81\u201396), as the letter is explicitly addressed to Jewish Christians from that region:\n\n{{quote|Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to God's elect, strangers in the world, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling by his blood: Grace and peace be yours in abundance.{{Bibleref2c|1Pet|1:1\u20132}}}}\n\nThose scholars who believe that the epistle dates from the time of Domitian argue that Nero's persecution of Christians was confined to the city of Rome itself, and did not extend to the Asian provinces mentioned in 1 Pet 1:1\u20132.\n \nThe [[Second Epistle of Peter]], on the other hand, appears to have been copied, in part, from the [[Epistle of Jude]], and some modern scholars date its composition as late as ''c.'' 150. Some scholars argue the opposite, that the Epistle of Jude copied Second Peter, while others contend an early date for Jude and thus observe that an early date is not incompatible with the text.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/> Many scholars have noted the similarities between the [[apocrypha]]l [[Second Epistle of Clement]] (2nd century) and Second Peter. Second Peter may be earlier than 150; there are a few possible references to it that date back to the 1st century or early 2nd century, e.g., [[1 Clement]] written in ''c.'' AD 96, and the later church historian Eusebius wrote that [[Origen]] had made reference to the epistle before 250.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Eusebius|title=Church History Book VI, Chapter 25|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250106.htm|publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nJerome says that Peter \"wrote two epistles which are called Catholic, the second of which, on account of its difference from the first in style, is considered by many not to be by him\"''(De Viris Illustribus 1).''<ref>{{cite web|last1=saint|first1=Jerome|title=De Viris Illustribus (On Illustrious Men) Chapter 1|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2708.htm|publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref> But he himself received the epistle, and explained the difference in style, character, and structure of words by the assumption that Peter used different interpreters in the composition of the two epistles;<ref name=\"Jerome\" /> and from his time onward the epistle was generally regarded as a part of the New Testament.\n\nEven in early times there was controversy over its authorship, and Second Peter was often not included in the [[biblical canon]]; it was only in the 4th century that it gained a firm foothold in the New Testament, in a series of synods. In the East the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] still did not admit it into the canon until the 6th century.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/>\n\n====Mark====\nTraditionally, the [[Gospel of Mark#Authorship and sources|Gospel of Mark]] was said to have been written by a person named [[John Mark]], and that this person was an assistant to Peter; hence its content was traditionally seen as the closest to Peter's viewpoint. According to Eusebius' ''Ecclesiastical History'', [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]] recorded this belief from [[John the Presbyter]]:\n\n{{quote|Mark having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered. It was not, however, in exact order that he related the sayings or deeds of Christ. For he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied Him. But afterwards, as I said, he accompanied Peter, who accommodated his instructions to the necessities [of his hearers], but with no intention of giving a normal or chronological narrative of the Lord's sayings. Wherefore Mark made no mistake in thus writing some things as he remembered them. For of one thing he took especial care, not to omit anything he had heard, and not to put anything fictional into the statements.<ref>Eusebius,'' Ecclesiastical History'', 3.39.14\u201316</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nClement of Alexandria in the fragments of his work ''Hypotyposes'' (A.D. 190) preserved and cited by the historian Eusebius in his ''Church History'' (VI, 14: 6) writes that:\n\n{{quote|As Peter had preached the Word publicly at Rome, and declared the Gospel by the Spirit, many who were present requested that [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], who had followed him for a long time and remembered his sayings, should write them out. And having composed the Gospel he gave it to those who had requested it.<ref name=\"CL\" />}}\n\nAlso Irenaeus wrote about this tradition:\n\n{{quote|After their (Peter and Paul's) passing, Mark also, the disciple and interpreter of Peter, transmitted to us in writing the things preached by Peter.<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III. 1.2.; quoted by Eusebius in ''Ecclesiastical History'', book 5, 7.6</ref>}}\n\nBased on these quotes, and on the Christian tradition, the information in Mark's gospel about Peter would be based on eyewitness material.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/> The gospel itself is [[Anonymous work|anonymous]], and the above passages are the oldest surviving written testimony to its authorship.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/>\n\n===Pseudepigrapha and apocrypha===\n[[File:Muenster-100725-15996-\u00dcberwasserkirche-Schl\u00fcssel.jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|The [[Key (lock)|key]] as symbol of St. Peter]]\nThere are also a number of other [[apocrypha]]l writings, that have been either attributed to or written about Peter.

The account is similar to that of the canonical gospels, especially the [[Gospel of Mark]]. It is unclear whether the fragment is an abridged version of the accounts in the [[synoptic gospels]], or a source text on which they were based, perhaps the apocryphal Gospel of Peter.<ref>''Das Evangelium nach Petrus.

He thus contrasts with [[Paul the Apostle]] who is bald except at the sides, with a longer beard and often black hair, and thinner in the face. One exception to this is in [[Anglo-Saxon art]], where he typically lacks a beard. Both Peter and Paul are shown thus as early as the 4th century [[Catacombs of Marcellinus and Peter]] in Rome.<ref>Higgitt, John, \"The Iconography of Saint Peter in Anglo-Saxon England, and Saint Cuthbert's Coffin\", pp. 267\u2013272, 270 quoted, in: Bonner, Gerald, Rollason, David & Stancliffe, Clare, eds., ''St. Cuthbert, his Cult and his Community to AD 1200''.

By the 15th century Peter is more likely to be bald on the top of his head in the Western church, but he continues to have a good head of hair in Orthodox icons.\n\nThe depiction of Saint Peter as literally the keeper of the gates of heaven, popular with modern cartoonists, is not found in traditional religious art, but Peter usually heads groups of saints flanking God in heaven, on the right hand side (viewer's left) of God. Narrative images of Peter include several scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' where he is mentioned in the gospels, and he is often identifiable in scenes where his presence is not specifically mentioned. Usually he stands nearest to Christ. In particular, depictions of the ''[[Arrest of Christ]]'' usually include Peter cutting off the ear of one of the soldiers. Scenes without Jesus include his distinctive martyrdom, his rescue from prison, and sometimes his trial. In the [[Counter-Reformation]] scenes of Peter hearing the cock crow for the third time became popular, as a representation of [[repentance]] and hence the Catholic [[sacrament]] of [[Confession (sacrament)|Confession]] or Reconciliation.\n\n==Patronage==\n<!-- This section is linked from the Christian leader infobox at top -->\n[[File:Peter in Chora.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Medieval mosaic of Saint Peter in the [[Chora Church]], Istanbul]]\n[[File:Ancient icon of sts peter & paul.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Icon of Saint Peter and Paul]]\n[[File:Llanbeblig Hours (f. 2v.)

Some Protestants, however, have rejected Peter's martyrdom as a later invention, arguing that evidence of Peter exists only in biblical accounts and not in the [[history]].\n\nIt has also been suggested that there was a serious division between Peter's [[Jewish Christian]] party and Paul's Hellenizing party, seen in e.g. the [[Incident at Antioch]], which later Christian accounts have downplayed.<ref>White, L.

The [[Gospel of John]] also depicts Peter fishing, even after the resurrection of Jesus, in the story of the [[Miraculous Draught of Fish|Catch of 153 fish]]. In Matthew and Mark, Jesus called Simon and his brother Andrew to be \"[[fishers of men]]\" ([[Matthew 4:18]]\u2013[[Matthew 4:19|19]], [[Mark 1]]:16\u201317).\n\nA Franciscan church is built upon the traditional site of Apostle Peter's house.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2000/3/Capernaum-%20The%20Church%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Peter|title=|publisher=}}</ref>\nIn [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], Simon Peter owns the boat that Jesus uses to preach to the multitudes who were pressing on him at the shore of [[Sea of Galilee|Lake Gennesaret]] ([[Luke 5]]:3). Jesus then amazes Simon and his companions James and John (Andrew is not mentioned) by telling them to lower their nets, whereupon they catch a huge number of fish. Immediately after this, they follow him ([[Luke 5]]:4\u201311). The [[Gospel of John]] gives a comparable account of \"The First Disciples\" ([[John 1]]:35\u201342). In John, the readers are told that it was two disciples of [[John the Baptist]] (Andrew and an unnamed disciple) who heard John the Baptist announce Jesus as the \"[[Lamb of God]]\" and then followed Jesus. Andrew then went to his brother Simon, saying, \"We have found the [[Messiah]]\", and then brought Simon to Jesus.\n\n[[File:Cavalier d'Arpino - Christ Taken Prisoner - WGA04690.jpg|thumb|right|Apostle Peter striking the [[High Priest]]s' servant [[Malchus]] with a sword in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]], by [[Giuseppe Cesari]] c. 1597]]\n\nThree of the four gospels\u2014Matthew, Mark and John\u2014recount the story of Jesus [[Jesus walking on water|walking on water]]. Matthew additionally describes Peter walking on water for a moment but beginning to sink when his faith wavers ([[Matthew 14]]:28\u201331).\n\nAt the beginning of the [[Last Supper]], Jesus washed his disciples' feet. Peter initially refused to let Jesus wash his feet, but when Jesus threatened him with: \"If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me\", Peter replied: \"Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head\" ([[John 13]]:2\u201311). The [[foot washing|washing of feet]] is often repeated in the [[service of worship]] on [[Maundy Thursday]] by some [[Christian denominations]].\n\nThe three [[Synoptic Gospels]] all mention that, when Jesus was arrested, one of his companions cut off the ear of a servant of the [[High Priest of Israel]] ([[Matthew 26]]:51, [[Mark 14]]:47, [[Luke 22]]:50). The Gospel of John also includes this event and names Peter as the swordsman and [[Malchus]] as the victim ([[John 18]]:10). Luke adds that Jesus touched the ear and miraculously healed it ([[Luke 22]]:49\u201351). This healing of the servant's ear is the last of the [[Miracles of Jesus|37 miracles attributed to Jesus]] in the Bible.\n\nSimon Peter was twice arraigned, with John, before the [[Sanhedrin]] and directly defied them ([[Acts 4]]:7\u201322, [[Acts 5]]:18\u201342). After receiving a vision from [[God]] that allowed for the eating of previously unclean animals, Peter takes a missionary journey to [[Lod|Lydda]], [[Jaffa, Israel|Joppa]] and [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]] ([[Acts 9]]:32\u2013[[Acts 10]]:2), becoming instrumental in the decision to evangelise the [[Gentile]]s ([[Acts 10]]). Simon Peter applied the message of the vision on clean animals to the gentiles and follows his meeting with [[Cornelius the Centurion]] by claiming that \"God shows no partiality ([[Acts 10]]).\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+10&version=NRSV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Acts 10 \u2013 New Revised Standard Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[Acts of the Apostles]], Peter and John were sent from Jerusalem to [[Samaria]] ([[Acts 8]]:14). Peter/Cephas is mentioned briefly in the opening chapter of one of the [[Pauline epistles]], [[Epistle to the Galatians]], which mentions a trip by [[Paul the Apostle]] to [[Jerusalem]] where he meets Peter ([[Galatians 1]]:18). Peter features again in Galatians, fourteen years later, when Paul (now with [[Barnabas]] and [[Saint Titus|Titus]]) returned to Jerusalem ([[Galatians 2]]:7-9). When Peter came to [[Antioch]], Paul opposed Peter to his face \"because he [Peter] was in the wrong\" ([[Galatians 2]]:11).<ref>see [[Incident at Antioch]]; see also the section below headed \"Road to Rome: Antioch and Corinth\"</ref>\n[[File:Apostle_Peter_Released_from_Prison,_Jacopo_di_Cione,_1370-1371_(Philadelphia_Museum_of_Art).jpg|left|thumb|''Apostle Peter Released from Prison'', [[Jacopo di Cione]], 1370-1371 ([[Philadelphia Museum of Art]])]]\n[[Acts 12]] narrates how Peter, who was in Jerusalem, was put into prison by [[Agrippa I]] (A.D. 42\u201344), but was [[liberation of Saint Peter|rescued by an angel]].

The three Synoptics and John describe the three denials as follows:\n# A denial when a female servant of the high priest spots Simon Peter, saying that he had been with Jesus. According to Mark (but not in all manuscripts), \"the rooster crowed\". Only Luke and John mention a fire by which Peter was warming himself among other people: according to Luke, Peter was \"sitting\"; according to John, he was \"standing\".\n# A denial when Simon Peter had gone out to the gateway, away from the firelight, but the same servant girl (Mark) or another servant girl (Matthew) or a man (Luke and also John, for whom, though, this is the third denial) told the bystanders he was a follower of Jesus. According to John, \"the rooster crowed\". The Gospel of John places the second denial while Peter was still warming himself at the fire, and gives as the occasion of the third denial a claim by someone to have seen him in the garden of [[Gethsemane]] when [[arrest of Jesus|Jesus was arrested]].\n# A denial came when Peter's Galilean accent was taken as proof that he was indeed a disciple of Jesus. According to Matthew, Mark and Luke, \"the rooster crowed\". Matthew adds that it was his [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]] that gave him away as coming from Galilee. Luke deviates slightly from this by stating that, rather than a crowd accusing Simon Peter, it was a third individual. John does not mention the Galilean accent.\n\nIn the Gospel of Luke is a record of Christ telling Peter: \"Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.\" In a reminiscent<ref name=\"May Metzger\">May, Herbert G. and Bruce M.

This took place three months after the disastrous fire that destroyed Rome for which the emperor (Nero) wished to blame the Christians. This \"dies imperii\" (regnal day anniversary) was an important one, exactly ten years after Nero ascended to the throne, and it was \"as usual\" accompanied by much bloodshed. Traditionally, [[Roman Empire|Roman]] authorities sentenced him to death by [[crucifixion]]. In accordance with the [[apocryphal]] [[Acts of Peter]], he was crucified head down.<ref>[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/actspeter.html Apocryphal ''Acts of Peter Chapter 37''].</ref> Tradition also locates his burial place where the [[St. Peter's Basilica|Basilica of Saint Peter]] was later built, directly beneath the Basilica's high altar.\n\n[[File:Crucifixion of Saint Peter-Caravaggio (c.1600).jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Crucifixion of Saint Peter (Caravaggio)|The Crucifixion of Saint Peter]]'' (1601) by [[Caravaggio]]]]\n\n[[Pope Clement I]] (d.99), in his ''Letter to the Corinthians'' (Chapter 5), written c. 80\u201398, speaks of Peter's martyrdom in the following terms: \"Let us take the noble examples of our own generation.

([[Vercelli manuscript|Vercelli]] Acts XXXV<ref>[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/actspeter.html The Acts of Peter], by M. R.

According to the story, Peter, fleeing Rome to avoid execution meets the risen Jesus. In the Latin translation, Peter asks Jesus, \"Quo vadis?\" He replies, \"''Romam eo iterum crucifigi\"'' (\"I am going to Rome to be crucified again\"). Peter then gains the courage to continue his ministry and returns to the city, where he is martyred. This story is commemorated in an [[Annibale Carracci]] painting. The [[Quo Vadis (church)|Church of Quo Vadis]], near the [[Catacombs]] of [[Pope Callistus I|Saint Callistus]], contains a stone in which Jesus' footprints from this event are supposedly preserved, though this was apparently an ''[[ex-voto]]'' from a [[pilgrim]], and indeed a copy of the original housed in the [[San Sebastiano fuori le mura|Basilica of St Sebastian]].\n\nThe death of Peter is attested to by [[Tertullian]] (c. 155\u2013c. 240) at the end of the 2nd century in his ''Prescription Against Heretics'', noting that Peter endured a passion like his Lord's.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Quintus Septimius Florens|first1=Tertullian|title=Prescription Against Heretics Chapter XXXVI|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.v.iii.xxxvi.html|publisher=ccel.org|accessdate=1 June 2015}} \"Since, moreover, you are close upon Italy, you have Rome, from which there comes even into our own hands the very authority (of apostles themselves).

[[Augustine of Hippo]] says in his Sermon 295: \"One day is assigned for the celebration of the martyrdom of the two apostles. But those two were one. Although their martyrdom occurred on different days, they were one.\"\n\nThis is also the feast of both [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] in the calendar of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].\n\nIn the [[Roman Rite]], the feast of the [[Chair of Saint Peter]] is celebrated on 22 February, and the anniversary of the dedication of the two [[Papal Basilica|papal basilicas]] of [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's]] and [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|Saint Paul outside the Walls]] is held on 18 November.\n\nBefore [[Pope John XXIII]]'s revision in 1960, the Roman Calendar also included on 18 January another feast of the Chair of Saint Peter (denominated the Chair of Saint Peter in Rome, while the February feast was then called that of the Chair of Saint Peter at Antioch), and on 1 August the feast of [[Liberation of Saint Peter|Saint Peter in Chains]].\n\nIn the Orthodox [[Daily Office]] every Thursday throughout the year is dedicated to the Holy Apostles, including St. Peter. There are also two [[feast day]]s in the year which are dedicated to him:\n\n* June 29, [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul]]\u2014This is a major feast day and is preceded by a period of Lenten fasting known as the [[Apostles' Fast]].\n* January 16, [[Liberation of Saint Peter|Veneration of the Precious Chains of the Holy and All-Glorious Apostle Peter]]\u2014commemorating both the chains which {{Bibleref2|Acts|12:1\u201311}} says miraculously fell from him, and the chains in which he was held before his [[martyr]]dom by [[Nero]].\n\n==Primacy of Peter==\nChristians of different theological backgrounds are in disagreement as to the exact significance of Peter's ministry. For instance: \n* Catholics view Peter as the first pope. The Catholic Church asserts that Peter's ministry, conferred upon him by Jesus of Nazareth in the gospels, lays down the theological foundation for the pope's exercise of pastoral authority over the Church.\n* Eastern Orthodox also believe that Peter's ministry points to an underlying theology wherein a special primacy ought to be granted to Peter's successors above other Church leaders but see this as merely a \"primacy of honor\", rather than the right to exercise pastoral authority.\n* Protestant denominations assert that Peter's apostolic work in Rome does not imply a connection between him and the papacy.\nSimilarly, historians of various backgrounds also offer differing interpretations of the Apostle's presence in Rome.\n\n===Catholic Church===\n{{Main|Primacy of Simon Peter|Papal primacy}}\n[[File:Statua di San Pietro realizzata da Giuseppe De Fabris - Piazza di San Pietro.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of St. Peter in [[St. Peter's Square]] at the Vatican]]\n\nAccording to Catholic belief, Simon Peter was distinguished by Jesus to hold the [[Primacy of Simon Peter|first place of honor and authority]]. Also in Catholic belief, Peter was, as the first Bishop of Rome, the first [[Pope]]. Furthermore, they consider every Pope to be Peter's successor and the rightful superior of all other [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]].<ref name=CEPope>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Pope|author=Joyce, G.

He believes the meaning of the original Aramaic is very clear: that \"Kepha\" was the Aramaic word for \"rock\", and that it was also the name by which Christ called Peter.<ref name=Time/>\n\nYet, Cullmann sharply rejects the Catholic claim that Peter began the papal succession. He writes: \"In the life of Peter there is no starting point for a chain of succession to the leadership of the church at large.\" While he believes the Matthew text is entirely valid and is in no way spurious, he says it cannot be used as \"warrant of the papal succession.\"<ref name=Time>{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,890753-1,00.html |title=Religion: Peter & the Rock |publisher=Time |date=1953-12-07 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref> Cullmann concludes that while Peter ''was'' the original head of the apostles, Peter was not the founder of any visible church succession.<ref name=\"Time\" />\n\nThere are other Protestant scholars who also partially defend the historical Catholic position about \"Rock.\"<ref>D. A. Carson in ''The Expositor's Bible Commentary'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1984).</ref> Taking a somewhat different approach from Cullman, they point out that the Gospel of Matthew was not written in the classical Attic form of Greek, but in the Hellenistic [[Koine Greek|Koine dialect]] in which there is no distinction in meaning between ''petros'' and ''petra''. Moreover, even in Attic Greek, in which the regular meaning of ''petros'' was a smallish \"stone,\" there are instances of its use to refer to larger rocks, as in [[Sophocles]], ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'' v. 1595, where ''petros'' refers to a boulder used as a landmark, obviously something more than a pebble. In any case, a ''petros''/''petra'' distinction is irrelevant considering the Aramaic language in which the phrase might well have been spoken. In Greek, of any period, the feminine noun ''petra'' could not be used as the given name of a male, which may explain the use of ''Petros'' as the Greek word with which to translate Aramaic ''Kepha''.<ref name=\"keating\" />\n\nYet, still other Protestant scholars believe that Jesus in fact ''did'' mean to single out Peter as the very rock which he will build upon, but that the passage does nothing to indicate a continued succession of Peter's implied position. They assert that Matthew uses the demonstrative pronoun ''taute'', which allegedly means \"this very\" or \"this same\", when he refers to the rock on which Jesus' church will be built. He also uses the Greek word for \"and\", ''kai''. It is alleged that when a demonstrative pronoun is used with ''kai'', the pronoun refers back to the preceding noun. The second rock Jesus refers to must then be the same rock as the first one; and if Peter is the first rock he must also be the second.<ref>''Jesus, Peter & the Keys: A Scriptural Handbook on the Papacy''</ref>\n\nUnlike Oscar Cullmann, [[Confessional Lutherans]] and many other Protestant apologists agree that it's meaningless to elaborate the meaning of \"Rock\" by looking at the Aramaic language. While the Jews spoke mostly Aramaic at home, in public they usually spoke Greek. The few Aramaic words spoken by Jesus in public were unusual, which is why they are noted as such. And most importantly the New Testament was revealed in Koine Greek, ''not'' Aramaic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203191915/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf|url-status=dead|title=''The Doctrine of Church and Ministry in the Life of the Church Today''|archive-date=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203192344/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Cross-Cultural And Multicultural Ministry In the New Testament|archive-date=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.graceway.com/articles/article_017.html|title=Some Thoughts on Matthew 16:18|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nLutheran historians even report that the Catholic church itself didn't, at least unanimously, regard Peter as the rock until the 1870s:\n{{quote|Rome's rule for explaining the Scriptures and determining doctrine is the [[Profession of faith (Catholic Church)#Tridentine Creed|Creed]] of [[Pius IV]].

Another title used for Peter is ''Coryphaeus'', which could be translated as \"Choir-director\", or lead singer.<ref>[[John Meyendorff]], et al. (1963), ''The Primacy of Peter in the Orthodox Church'' ([[St. Vladimir's Seminary]] Press, Crestwood NY, {{ISBN|978-0-88141-125-6}})</ref> The church recognizes Apostle Peter's leadership role in the [[early church]], especially in the very early days at Jerusalem, but does not consider him to have had any \"princely\" role over his fellow Apostles.\n\nThe New Testament is not seen by the Orthodox as supporting any extraordinary authority for Peter with regard to faith or morals. The Orthodox also hold that Peter did not act as leader at the [[Council of Jerusalem]], but as merely one of a number who spoke. The final decision regarding the non-necessity of [[circumcision]] (and certain prohibitions) was spelled out by [[James, the Brother of the Lord]] (though Catholics hold James merely reiterated and fleshed out what Peter had said, regarding the latter's earlier divine revelation regarding the inclusion of Gentiles).\n\nEastern and Oriental Orthodox do not recognize the Bishop of Rome as the successor of St. Peter but the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] sends a delegation each year to Rome to participate in the celebration of the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul. In the [[declaration of Ravenna|Ravenna Document]] of 13 October 2007, the representatives of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] agreed that \"Rome, as the Church that 'presides in love' according to the phrase of St. Ignatius of Antioch (\"To the Romans\", Prologue), occupied the first place in the ''taxis'', and that the bishop of Rome was therefore the ''protos'' among the patriarchs, if the Papacy unites with the Orthodox Church. They disagree, however, on the interpretation of the historical evidence from this era regarding the prerogatives of the bishop of Rome as ''protos'', a matter that was already understood in different ways in the first millennium.\"\n\nWith regard to Jesus' words to Peter, \"Thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church\", the Orthodox hold Christ is referring to the confession of faith, ''not'' the person of Peter as that upon which he will build the church. This is allegedly shown by the fact that the original Greek uses the feminine demonstrative pronoun when he says \"upon this rock\" (\u03c4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c4\u1fc3 \u03c4\u1fc7 \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u1fb3); whereas, grammatically, if he had been referring to Peter, he would allegedly have used the masculine.<ref>Holy Apostles Convent (1999) ''The Orthodox New Testament'', Vol. I: The Holy Gospels (Dormition Skete, Buena Vista CO, {{ISBN|0-944359-13-2}}) p. 105</ref> This \"gender distinction\" argument is also held by some Protestants.\n\n===Syriac Orthodox Church===\n[[File:Antonio de Bellis - La liberazione di San Pietro.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''Saint Peter and the angel'', by [[Antonio de Bellis]] ]] \nThe Fathers of the Syriac Orthodox Church tried to give a theological interpretation to the primacy of Apostle Peter. They were fully convinced of the unique office of Peter in the primitive Christian community. [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem]], [[Aphrahat]] and [[Maruthas]] who were supposed to have been the best exponents of the early [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac tradition]] unequivocally acknowledge the office of Peter.\n\nThe Syriac Fathers, following the rabbinic tradition, call Jesus \"Kepha\" for they see \"rock\" in the Old Testament as a messianic Symbol (yet the Old Maronite Syriacs of Lebanon still refer to Saint Peter as \"Saint Simon the Generous\" or Simon Karam\"). When Christ gave his own name \"Kepha\" to Simon he was giving him participation in the person and office of Christ. Christ who is the Kepha and shepherd made Simon the chief shepherd in his place and gave him the very name Kepha and said that on Kepha he would build the Church. [[Aphrahat]] shared the common Syriac tradition. For him Kepha is in fact another name of Jesus, and Simon was given the right to share the name. The person who receives somebody else's name also obtains the rights of the person who bestows the name. Aphrahat makes the stone taken from Jordan a type of Peter. He wrote: \"Jesus son of Nun set up the stones for a witness in Israel; Jesus our Saviour called Simon Kepha Sarirto and set him as the faithful witness among nations.\"\n\nAgain he wrote in his commentary on [[Deuteronomy]] that [[Moses]] brought forth water from \"rock\" (Kepha) for the people and Jesus sent Simon Kepha to carry his teachings among nations. God accepted him and made him the foundation of the Church and called him Kepha. When he speaks about the transfiguration of Christ he calls him [[Simon Peter]], the foundation of the Church. Ephrem also shared the same view. The Armenian version of [[De Virginitate]] records that [[Peter the rock]] shunned honour. A ''mimro'' of Efrem found in Holy Week Liturgy points to the importance of Peter.\n\nBoth [[Aphrahat]] and [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem]] represent the authentic tradition of the Syrian Church. The different orders of liturgies used for sanctification of Church buildings, marriage, ordination, ''et cetera'', reveal that the primacy of Peter is a part of living faith of the Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.syrianchurch.org/Articles/PrimacyofStPeter.htm |title=\"Primacy of St. Peter\" \u2013 by Dr. Thomas Athanasius |publisher=Syrianchurch.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref>\n\n===New Apostolic Church===\nThe [[New Apostolic Church]], which believes in the re-established Apostle ministry, sees Peter as the first [[Chief Apostle]].\n\n===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===\n[[File:Saint Peter by Gr\u00e3o Vasco.jpg|thumb|''Saint Peter'' by [[Gr\u00e3o Vasco|Vasco Fernandes]], 1506]]\n\n[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] teaches that Peter was the first leader of the early Christian church after the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Both demonstrate a high quality of cultured and urban Greek, at odds with the linguistic skill that would ordinarily be expected of an [[Aramaic]]-speaking fisherman, who would have learned Greek as a second or third language.

Wallace]] (who maintains that Peter was the author) writes that, for many scholars, \"the issue of authorship is already settled, at least negatively: the apostle Peter did not write this letter\" and that \"the vast bulk of NT scholars adopts this perspective without much discussion\". However, he later states, \"Although a very strong case has been made against Petrine authorship of 2 Peter, we believe it is deficient. ...Taken together, these external and internal arguments strongly suggest the traditional view, viz., that Peter was indeed the author of the second epistle which bears his name.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20031209164253/http://www.bible.org/docs/soapbox/2petotl.htm ''Second Peter: Introduction, Argument, and Outline''].

The Roman historian [[Tacitus]] and the biographer [[Suetonius]] do both record that Nero persecuted Christians, and Tacitus dates this to immediately after the fire that burned Rome in 64. Christian tradition, for example Eusebius of Caesarea (''History'' book 2, 24.1), has maintained that Peter was killed in Nero's persecution, and thus had to assume that the Roman persecution alluded to in First Peter must be this Neronian persecution.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/> On the other hand, many modern scholars argue that First Peter refers to the persecution of Christians in Asia Minor during the reign of the emperor [[Domitian]] (81\u201396), as the letter is explicitly addressed to Jewish Christians from that region:\n\n{{quote|Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to God's elect, strangers in the world, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling by his blood: Grace and peace be yours in abundance.{{Bibleref2c|1Pet|1:1\u20132}}}}\n\nThose scholars who believe that the epistle dates from the time of Domitian argue that Nero's persecution of Christians was confined to the city of Rome itself, and did not extend to the Asian provinces mentioned in 1 Pet 1:1\u20132.\n \nThe [[Second Epistle of Peter]], on the other hand, appears to have been copied, in part, from the [[Epistle of Jude]], and some modern scholars date its composition as late as ''c.'' 150. Some scholars argue the opposite, that the Epistle of Jude copied Second Peter, while others contend an early date for Jude and thus observe that an early date is not incompatible with the text.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/> Many scholars have noted the similarities between the [[apocrypha]]l [[Second Epistle of Clement]] (2nd century) and Second Peter. Second Peter may be earlier than 150; there are a few possible references to it that date back to the 1st century or early 2nd century, e.g., [[1 Clement]] written in ''c.'' AD 96, and the later church historian Eusebius wrote that [[Origen]] had made reference to the epistle before 250.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Eusebius|title=Church History Book VI, Chapter 25|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250106.htm|publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nJerome says that Peter \"wrote two epistles which are called Catholic, the second of which, on account of its difference from the first in style, is considered by many not to be by him\"''(De Viris Illustribus 1).''<ref>{{cite web|last1=saint|first1=Jerome|title=De Viris Illustribus (On Illustrious Men) Chapter 1|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2708.htm|publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref> But he himself received the epistle, and explained the difference in style, character, and structure of words by the assumption that Peter used different interpreters in the composition of the two epistles;<ref name=\"Jerome\" /> and from his time onward the epistle was generally regarded as a part of the New Testament.\n\nEven in early times there was controversy over its authorship, and Second Peter was often not included in the [[biblical canon]]; it was only in the 4th century that it gained a firm foothold in the New Testament, in a series of synods. In the East the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] still did not admit it into the canon until the 6th century.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/>\n\n====Mark====\nTraditionally, the [[Gospel of Mark#Authorship and sources|Gospel of Mark]] was said to have been written by a person named [[John Mark]], and that this person was an assistant to Peter; hence its content was traditionally seen as the closest to Peter's viewpoint. According to Eusebius' ''Ecclesiastical History'', [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]] recorded this belief from [[John the Presbyter]]:\n\n{{quote|Mark having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered. It was not, however, in exact order that he related the sayings or deeds of Christ. For he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied Him. But afterwards, as I said, he accompanied Peter, who accommodated his instructions to the necessities [of his hearers], but with no intention of giving a normal or chronological narrative of the Lord's sayings. Wherefore Mark made no mistake in thus writing some things as he remembered them. For of one thing he took especial care, not to omit anything he had heard, and not to put anything fictional into the statements.<ref>Eusebius,'' Ecclesiastical History'', 3.39.14\u201316</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nClement of Alexandria in the fragments of his work ''Hypotyposes'' (A.D. 190) preserved and cited by the historian Eusebius in his ''Church History'' (VI, 14: 6) writes that:\n\n{{quote|As Peter had preached the Word publicly at Rome, and declared the Gospel by the Spirit, many who were present requested that [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], who had followed him for a long time and remembered his sayings, should write them out. And having composed the Gospel he gave it to those who had requested it.<ref name=\"CL\" />}}\n\nAlso Irenaeus wrote about this tradition:\n\n{{quote|After their (Peter and Paul's) passing, Mark also, the disciple and interpreter of Peter, transmitted to us in writing the things preached by Peter.<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III. 1.2.; quoted by Eusebius in ''Ecclesiastical History'', book 5, 7.6</ref>}}\n\nBased on these quotes, and on the Christian tradition, the information in Mark's gospel about Peter would be based on eyewitness material.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/> The gospel itself is [[Anonymous work|anonymous]], and the above passages are the oldest surviving written testimony to its authorship.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/>\n\n===Pseudepigrapha and apocrypha===\n[[File:Muenster-100725-15996-\u00dcberwasserkirche-Schl\u00fcssel.jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|The [[Key (lock)|key]] as symbol of St. Peter]]\nThere are also a number of other [[apocrypha]]l writings, that have been either attributed to or written about Peter.

The account is similar to that of the canonical gospels, especially the [[Gospel of Mark]]. It is unclear whether the fragment is an abridged version of the accounts in the [[synoptic gospels]], or a source text on which they were based, perhaps the apocryphal Gospel of Peter.<ref>''Das Evangelium nach Petrus.

He thus contrasts with [[Paul the Apostle]] who is bald except at the sides, with a longer beard and often black hair, and thinner in the face. One exception to this is in [[Anglo-Saxon art]], where he typically lacks a beard. Both Peter and Paul are shown thus as early as the 4th century [[Catacombs of Marcellinus and Peter]] in Rome.<ref>Higgitt, John, \"The Iconography of Saint Peter in Anglo-Saxon England, and Saint Cuthbert's Coffin\", pp. 267\u2013272, 270 quoted, in: Bonner, Gerald, Rollason, David & Stancliffe, Clare, eds., ''St. Cuthbert, his Cult and his Community to AD 1200''.

By the 15th century Peter is more likely to be bald on the top of his head in the Western church, but he continues to have a good head of hair in Orthodox icons.\n\nThe depiction of Saint Peter as literally the keeper of the gates of heaven, popular with modern cartoonists, is not found in traditional religious art, but Peter usually heads groups of saints flanking God in heaven, on the right hand side (viewer's left) of God. Narrative images of Peter include several scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' where he is mentioned in the gospels, and he is often identifiable in scenes where his presence is not specifically mentioned. Usually he stands nearest to Christ. In particular, depictions of the ''[[Arrest of Christ]]'' usually include Peter cutting off the ear of one of the soldiers. Scenes without Jesus include his distinctive martyrdom, his rescue from prison, and sometimes his trial. In the [[Counter-Reformation]] scenes of Peter hearing the cock crow for the third time became popular, as a representation of [[repentance]] and hence the Catholic [[sacrament]] of [[Confession (sacrament)|Confession]] or Repentance.\n\n==Patronage==\n<!-- This section is linked from the Christian leader infobox at top -->\n[[File:Peter in Chora.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Medieval mosaic of Saint Peter in the [[Chora Church]], Istanbul]]\n[[File:Ancient icon of sts peter & paul.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Icon of Saint Peter and Paul]]\n[[File:Llanbeblig Hours (f. 2v.)

A public golf course known as the Merced Hills Golf Course had been constructed at the site in the early 1990s. This course was shut down to make way for the new campus when the original site for the campus was made unavailable due to the discovery of [[fairy shrimp]] - an endangered species - on the originally proposed site. Since the construction of the golf course had negated concerns about wetland and vernal pool environmental issues, building the campus at this location was easier than fighting to save the original construction site. Two small bridges on campus date from the time of the golf course.\n\nUC Merced established a satellite campus in [[Bakersfield, California]] in 2001 in its downtown [[Education District, Bakersfield|University Square]]. The satellite campus advocated a UC education to prospective college-bound students of [[Kern County, California|Kern County]] and the southern San Joaquin Valley before UC Merced opened its official campus in Merced. Classes and counseling were also provided at the Bakersfield center to newly admitted UC students. In 2011, UC Merced closed its Bakersfield campus in a cost-cutting effort.

Its official motto is \"Not what other research libraries are, what they will be.\"\n\nThe Library building is named after Leo and Dottie Kolligian. Leo served as the Chairman of the UC Board of Regents in 1988 when the Board decided to explore building a 10th campus, in the San Joaquin Valley. The first floor of the library was dedicated by Ed and Jeanne Kashian. The McFadden-Willis Reading Room is located on the fourth floor and named in honor of the McFadden and Willis children by Christine McFadden. The Library also has a technology classroom dedicated by Doris Gonella in honor of her late husband Louis, The Gonella Discovery Room.\n\nThe library offers 10 public workstations for students, faculty, staff and visitors to access electronic resources.  The library contains more electronic holdings than print holdings, consisting of about 70,000 online journals and 3.965 million electronic books (including 3.15 million [[HathiTrust]] full-text books), compared to 102,000 print books.

A public golf course known as the Merced Hills Golf Course had been constructed at the site in the early 1990s. This course was shut down to make way for the new campus when the original site for the campus was made unavailable due to the discovery of [[fairy shrimp]] - an endangered species - on the originally proposed site. Since the construction of the golf course had negated concerns about wetland and vernal pool environmental issues, building the campus at this location was easier than fighting to save the original construction site. Two small bridges on campus date from the time of the golf course.\n\nUC Merced established a satellite campus in [[Bakersfield, California]] in 2001 in its downtown [[Education District, Bakersfield|University Square]]. The satellite campus advocated a UC education to prospective college-bound students of [[Kern County, California|Kern County]] and the southern San Joaquin Valley before UC Merced opened its official campus in Merced. Classes and counseling were also provided at the Bakersfield center to newly admitted UC students. In 2011, UC Merced closed its Bakersfield campus in a cost-cutting effort.

During the Fall 2005 semester, while construction of the Classroom and Science/Engineering buildings was still taking place, all academic courses were conducted in the library.  Its official motto is \"Not what other research libraries are, what they will be.\"\n\nThe Library building is named after Leo and Dottie Kolligian. Leo served as the Chairman of the UC Board of Regents in 1988 when the Board decided to explore building a 10th campus, in the San Joaquin Valley. The first floor of the library was dedicated by Ed and Jeanne Kashian. The McFadden-Willis Reading Room is located on the fourth floor and named in honor of the McFadden and Willis children by Christine McFadden. The Library also has a technology classroom dedicated by Doris Gonella in honor of her late husband Louis, The Gonella Discovery Room.\n\nThe library offers 10 public workstations for students, faculty, staff and visitors to access electronic resources.  The library contains more electronic holdings than print holdings, consisting of about 70,000 online journals and 3.965 million electronic books (including 3.15 million [[HathiTrust]] full-text books), compared to 102,000 print books.

Negotiations between NASA and AEB (the Brazilian Space Agency) fell through due to budgetary concerns. During the delay, Pontes ran a campaign to pressure the Brazilian government to complete the Express Pallet, and he worked on technical assignments in the Astronaut Office Space Station Operations Branch at NASA.

At first, the [[Pal\u00e1cio do Planalto]], AEB ([[Brazilian Space Agency]]) and Aeronautics expected that Pontes could offer a stimulus factor to the space program and to new adhesions to the Armed Forces, as well as mentoring and training to new astronauts, justifying an investment of 10 million dollars from the Federal Government,<ref name=LeaveA>{{cite web|url=https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ciencia/ult306u14667.shtml|title=Pontes sai da Aeron\u00e1utica e vai poder cobrar por palestras|trans-title=Pontes leave the Air Force and will be able to charge for lectures|work=Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo|date=2006|accessdate=2019-09-04|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190426124026/https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ciencia/ult306u14667.shtml|archivedate=April 26, 2019}}</ref><ref name=MiliR>{{cite web|url=https://www.poder360.com.br/governo/novo-ministro-marcos-pontes-foi-para-a-reserva-militar-aos-43-anos/|title=Novo ministro, Marcos Pontes foi para a reserva militar aos 43 anos|trans-title=New minister, Marcos Pontes went to the military reserve at the age of 43|date=2018|accessdate=2019-09-04|last=Matsui|first=Naomi|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190426142244/https://www.poder360.com.br/governo/novo-ministro-marcos-pontes-foi-para-a-reserva-militar-aos-43-anos/|archivedate=April 26, 2019}}</ref> strongly defended by the Lula Government, who even talked to the astronaut in videoconference on the International Space Station: \"In a few moments in the history of Brazil, we were proud of a Brazilian like we are having of you.

The ''Fusiliers Marins'' are also in charge of providing protection for naval vessels and key [[French Navy]] sites on land.\n\n== Missions ==\n\nThe ''Fusiliers Marins'' are tasked with:\n* participating in land operations from the sea;\n* participating in special operations ([[Commandos Marine]]);\n* the protection of sensitive sites of the Navy (Naval bases, [[French Naval Aviation]], transmission stations etc.);\n* reinforcement of protection duties provided by Naval forces (maintaining order on board ship and the protection of naval vessels against attack).\n\nThe ''Fusiliers Marins'' should not be confused with the ''[[Troupes de Marine]]'' of the modern [[French Army]]. The latter corps has undergone several changes in role from marine infantry to colonial troops (''[[Troupes coloniales]]'') to overseas forces. It has however remained as an essentially land force while the ''Fusiliers Marins'' have throughout their history been an integral part of the [[French Navy]].\n\n== History of the French Fusiliers Marins ==\n[[File:Regiment de la marine 1757.jpeg|thumb|Soldier of the ''Compagnies Franches de la Marine'' during the 18th century]]\n\n=== Ancestors, Compagnies Franches de la Marine ===\n{{Main|List of ships of the line of France|Troupes de la marine|Compagnies Franches de la Marine}}\n\nIn 1627, Cardinal [[Armand Jean du Plessis de Richelieu|Richelieu]] undertook the creation of a Naval Regiment, intended to provide soldiers for service on naval ships. Their roles were to include combat on both land or sea, under the orders of the officers of the ship. These sea-going soldiers formed part of the ship's company and helped with its sailing. The basic units were the [[Compagnies Franches de la Marine]]: separate detachments of about 70 men, each commanded by a royal [[Ranks in the French Navy|''lieutenant des vaisseaux'']], supported by two [[Ranks in the French Navy|ensigns]]. The marine companies served in the French colonies of the period and particularly in ''[[Nouvelle-France]]''. These formations existed under differing titles until 1825, when they were dissolved by a royal ordinance decreeing that landing parties (''compagnies de d\u00e9barquement'') be made up of sailors. The R\u00e9giments de la Marine were subsequently succeeded by the [[Troupes de la marine]], which later became the colonial troops (''[[Troupes de Marine|Troupes Coloniales]]'') of the [[French Army]], specifically raised for overseas service.\n\n=== Creation of a specialized corps in 1856 ===\n\nThese companies lacked specialized personnel trained for combat on land.\n\nAn Imperial [[decree]] dated 5 June 1856, created the Fusiliers Marins, whose formation and training were undertaken by a battalion stationed at [[Lorient]], Brittany. This specialized corps was put under the command of the captains and sergeants-at-arms of the various [[naval]] vessels of the [[French Navy|French fleet]], and was the direct ancestor of the modern Fusiliers Marins.\n\nSince that date, the Fusiliers Marins have participated the following conflicts:\n\n* The [[French colonial empire|military colonial campaigns]] of the end of the 19th century,\n* The expeditions in China, Cochinchina, Tonkin and Madagascar,\n* The European conflicts in 1870, 1914-1918 and 1939-1945.\n\nDuring the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, following the disaster of [[Battle of Sedan|Sedan]], several brigades of ''Fusiliers Marins'' and naval artillerymen were engaged in combat at [[Bapaume]] and subsequently participated in the defense of Paris, notably at the Bourget and at L'Ha\u00ff-les-Roses. This force formed part of the Government ''Arm\u00e9e versaillaise'' ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:Ordre de bataille de l'arm\u00e9e versaillaise|arm\u00e9e versaillaise]]}}) employed in the suppression of the [[Paris Commune]] in 1871.\n\n[[File:M 50 1 les fusili\u00e9s marins Mathurins chargeant dans le Nord.jpg|thumb|droite| The first engagement of the Fusiliers marins in the [[Nord (French department)|Nord]] department, in November 1914]]\nA detachment of ''fusiliers marins'' defended the French Legation (diplomatic mission) in Peking during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] of 1900. Amongst their officers was [[Ranks in the French Navy|enseigne de vaisseau]] Paul Henry and [[Pierre Alexis Ronarc'h]], who, in 1914, would serve as [[Counter-Admiral]] and [[Commandant]] of the [[Brigade de Fusiliers Marins]] [[Moroccan Division (France)|BFM]] attached to the [[Moroccan Division (France)|32nd Army Corps]].\n\nThe Brigade de Fusiliers Marins distinguished themselves at [[Battle of the Yser|Dixmude, on the Yser]], at Longewaede, Hailles and Laffaux during the early stages of World War I. Three French ships have been [[French ship Dixmude|named after Dixmude]].\n\nThe Fusiliers Marins participated in the campaigns of [[Free France]]. They initially formed a battalion then the [[1er R\u00e9giment de Fusiliers Marins|1<sup>er</sup> R\u00e9giment de Fusiliers Marins]] 1<sup>e</sup> RFM at the corps of the [[1st Free French Division]] (1<sup>er</sup> DFL) and the [[1er Bataillon de Fusiliers Marins Commandos|1<sup>er</sup> Bataillon de Fusiliers Marins Commandos]] ([[List of French paratrooper units|1<sup>er</sup> BFMC]]) who served in 10 (Inter-Allied) [[Commando]]. The 177 [[Commandos Marine|Commandos Kieffer]] who disembarked on 6 June in Normandy, were Fusiliers Marins forming part of the Free France Forces. Other Fusiliers Marins, drawn from the former Arm\u00e9e de Vichy, formed the [[R\u00e9giment Blind\u00e9 de Fusiliers-Marins]] ([[R\u00e9giment Blind\u00e9 de Fusiliers-Marins|RBFM]]) which served efficiently as part of the [[2nd Armored Division (France)|2nd Armored Division]]. On 30 April 1945 the Fusiliers Marins played a role in the liberation of the [[Oleron|\u00cele d'Ol\u00e9ron]]. Disembarked at 0620 at Gatseau, an FM detachment advanced slowly through forested terrain facing a stern resistance.\n[[File:1er RFM flag guard Bastille Day 2008.jpg|thumb|The regimental colors of the 1st Regiment of Fusiliers Marins at the 2008 [[Bastille Day Military Parade]]]]\nIn 1945, the Far Eastern Marine Brigade (BMEO) was created with the [[R\u00e9giment Blind\u00e9 de Fusiliers-Marins|RBFM]] and the [[1er R\u00e9giment de Fusiliers Marins|1<sup>er</sup> RFM]]. Based on the request of [[general]] [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque|Leclerc]], the Marine Brigade formed river brigades in 1945-1946. They became the [[Dinassaut]], which operated in Tonkin and Cochinchina from 1947 to 1954. In 1956, with operational cadres serving in Algeria; the Demi-Brigade of Fusiliers Marins (DBFM) was created to play a leading role in securing the borders between Algeria and Morocco until 1962. This demi-brigade was under the command of Vessel Commander (CV) Ponchardier.\n\nThe French Fusiliers Marins are a specialised corps of the [[French Navy]], similar to (for example) the [[Royal Marines]] of the [[Royal Navy]], the [[Spanish Navy Marines]] ([[Spanish Navy]]), the [[San Marco Marine Brigade]] ([[Italian Navy]]), and the [[United States Marine Corps]] of the [[United States Navy]].\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Affice-recrutement-fusiliers-marins.jpg|\"Call to fair men; the Royal regiment of Naval fusiliers is recruiting...\" Louis XV\nImage:MuseeMarine-ShakoMarine.jpg|Mus\u00e9e de la Marine, Paris: Naval Infantry shako, around 1829\nFile:LPDF 61 10 les fusillers marins de Dixmude.jpg|Fusiliers marins decorated after the [[Battle of the Yser]]\nImage:Commandant Ducuing 061030-N-5555T-019.jpg|Inspections at sea are often carried out by ''fusilliers marins.''\n</gallery>\n\n==Uniforms==\nThe Naval Fusiliers wear a dark blue beret in their combat dress uniforms, pulled right with their own distinctive badge worn over the left eye or temple.

The ''Fusiliers Marins'' are also in charge of providing protection for naval vessels and key [[French Navy]] sites on land.\n\n== Missions ==\n\nThe ''Fusiliers Marins'' are tasked with:\n* participating in land operations from the sea;\n* participating in special operations ([[Commandos Marine]]);\n* the protection of sensitive sites of the Navy (Naval bases, [[French Naval Aviation]], transmission stations etc.);\n* reinforcement of protection duties provided by Naval forces (maintaining order on board ship and the protection of naval vessels against attack).\n\nThe ''Fusiliers Marins'' should not be confused with the ''[[Troupes de Marine]]'' of the modern [[French Army]]. The latter corps has undergone several changes in role from marine infantry to colonial troops (''[[Troupes coloniales]]'') to overseas forces. It has however remained as an essentially land force while the ''Fusiliers Marins'' have throughout their history been an integral part of the [[French Navy]].\n\n== History of the French Fusiliers Marins ==\n[[File:Regiment de la marine 1757.jpeg|thumb|Soldier of the ''Compagnies Franches de la Marine'' during the 18th century]]\n\n=== Ancestors, Compagnies Franches de la Marine ===\n{{Main|List of ships of the line of France|Troupes de la marine|Compagnies Franches de la Marine}}\n\nIn 1627, Cardinal [[Armand Jean du Plessis de Richelieu|Richelieu]] undertook the creation of a Naval Regiment, intended to provide soldiers for service on naval ships. Their roles were to include combat on both land or sea, under the orders of the officers of the ship. These sea-going soldiers formed part of the ship's company and helped with its sailing. The basic units were the [[Compagnies Franches de la Marine]]: separate detachments of about 70 men, each commanded by a royal [[Ranks in the French Navy|''lieutenant des vaisseaux'']], supported by two [[Ranks in the French Navy|ensigns]]. The marine companies served in the French colonies of the period and particularly in ''[[Nouvelle-France]]''. These formations existed under differing titles until 1825, when they were dissolved by a royal ordinance decreeing that landing parties (''compagnies de d\u00e9barquement'') be made up of sailors. The R\u00e9giments de la Marine were subsequently succeeded by the [[Troupes de la marine]], which later became the colonial troops (''[[Troupes de Marine|Troupes Coloniales]]'') of the [[French Army]], specifically raised for overseas service.\n\n=== Creation of a specialized corps in 1856 ===\n\nThese companies lacked specialized personnel trained for combat on land.\n\nAn Imperial [[decree]] dated 5 June 1856, created the Fusiliers Marins, whose formation and training were undertaken by a battalion stationed at [[Lorient]], Brittany. This specialized corps was put under the command of the captains and sergeants-at-arms of the various [[naval]] vessels of the [[French Navy|French fleet]], and was the direct ancestor of the modern Fusiliers Marins.\n\nSince that date, the Fusiliers Marins have participated the following conflicts:\n\n* The [[French colonial empire|military colonial campaigns]] of the end of the 19th century,\n* The expeditions in China, Cochinchina, Tonkin and Madagascar,\n* The European conflicts in 1870, 1914-1918 and 1939-1945.\n\nDuring the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, following the disaster of [[Battle of Sedan|Sedan]], several brigades of ''Fusiliers Marins'' and naval artillerymen were engaged in combat at [[Bapaume]] and subsequently participated in the defense of Paris, notably at the Bourget and at L'Ha\u00ff-les-Roses. This force formed part of the Government ''Arm\u00e9e versaillaise'' ({{lang-fr|[[:fr:Ordre de bataille de l'arm\u00e9e versaillaise|arm\u00e9e versaillaise]]}}) employed in the suppression of the [[Paris Commune]] in 1871.\n\n[[File:M 50 1 les fusili\u00e9s marins Mathurins chargeant dans le Nord.jpg|thumb|droite| The first engagement of the Fusiliers marins in the [[Nord (French department)|Nord]] department, in November 1914]]\nA detachment of ''fusiliers marins'' defended the French Legation (diplomatic mission) in Peking during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] of 1900. Amongst their officers was [[Ranks in the French Navy|enseigne de vaisseau]] Paul Henry and [[Pierre Alexis Ronarc'h]], who, in 1914, would serve as [[Counter-Admiral]] and [[Commandant]] of the [[Brigade de Fusiliers Marins]] [[Moroccan Division (France)|BFM]] attached to the [[Moroccan Division (France)|32nd Army Corps]].\n\nThe Brigade de Fusiliers Marins distinguished themselves at [[Battle of the Yser|Dixmude, on the Yser]], at Longewaede, Hailles and Laffaux during the early stages of World War I. Three French ships have been [[French ship Dixmude|named after Dixmude]].\n\nThe Fusiliers Marins participated in the campaigns of [[Free France]]. They initially formed a battalion then the [[1er R\u00e9giment de Fusiliers Marins|1<sup>er</sup> R\u00e9giment de Fusiliers Marins]] 1<sup>e</sup> RFM at the corps of the [[1st Free French Division]] (1<sup>er</sup> DFL) and the [[1er Bataillon de Fusiliers Marins Commandos|1<sup>er</sup> Bataillon de Fusiliers Marins Commandos]] ([[List of French paratrooper units|1<sup>er</sup> BFMC]]) who served in 10 (Inter-Allied) [[Commando]]. The 177 [[Commandos Marine|Commandos Kieffer]] who disembarked on 6 June in Normandy, were Fusiliers Marins forming part of the Free France Forces. Other Fusiliers Marins, drawn from the former Arm\u00e9e de Vichy, formed the [[R\u00e9giment Blind\u00e9 de Fusiliers-Marins]] ([[R\u00e9giment Blind\u00e9 de Fusiliers-Marins|RBFM]]) which served efficiently as part of the [[2nd Armored Division (France)|2nd Armored Division]]. On 30 April 1945 the Fusiliers Marins played a role in the liberation of the [[Oleron|\u00cele d'Ol\u00e9ron]]. Disembarked at 0620 at Gatseau, an FM detachment advanced slowly through forested terrain facing a stern resistance.\n[[File:1er RFM flag guard Bastille Day 2008.jpg|thumb|The regimental colors of the 1st Regiment of Fusiliers Marins at the 2008 [[Bastille Day Military Parade]]]]\nIn 1945, the Far Eastern Marine Brigade (BMEO) was created with the [[R\u00e9giment Blind\u00e9 de Fusiliers-Marins|RBFM]] and the [[1er R\u00e9giment de Fusiliers Marins|1<sup>er</sup> RFM]].

He was the younger brother of [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]], the final [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]]. Thomas was appointed as Despot of the Morea by his oldest brother, Emperor [[John VIII Palaiologos]], in 1428, joining his two brothers and other despots [[Theodore II Palaiologos|Theodore]] and Constantine, already governing the Morea. Though Theodore proved reluctant to cooperate with his brothers, Thomas and Constantine successfully worked to strengthen the despotate and expand its borders. In 1432, Thomas brought the remaining territories of the Latin [[Principality of Achaea]], established during the [[Fourth Crusade]] more than two hundred years earlier, into Byzantine hands by marrying [[Catherine Zaccaria]], daughter and heir to the principality.\n\nIn 1449, Thomas supported the ascension of his brother Constantine, who then became Emperor Constantine XI, to the throne despite the machinations of his other brother, [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrios]], who himself desired the throne. After Constantine's rise to the throne, Demetrios was then assigned by Constantine to govern the Morea with Thomas but the two brothers found it difficult to cooperate, often quarreling with each other. In the aftermath of the [[Fall of Constantinople]] and end of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1453, Ottoman Sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed II]] allowed Thomas and Demetrios to continue to rule as Ottoman vassals in the Morea. Thomas hoped to turn the small despotate into a rallying point of a campaign to restore the empire, hoping to gain support from the [[Papacy]] and [[Western Europe]]. Constant quarreling with Demetrios, who supported the Ottomans instead, eventually led Mehmed to invade and conquer the Morea in 1460.\n\nThomas and his family, including his wife Catherine and his three younger children [[Sophia Palaiologina|Zoe]], [[Andreas Palaiologos|Andreas]] and [[Manuel Palaiologos|Manuel]], escaped into exile to the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]]-held city of [[Methoni, Messenia|Methoni]] and then to [[Corfu]], where Catherine and the children stayed. In the hopes of raising support for a crusade to restore his lands in the Morea, and possibly the Byzantine Empire itself, Thomas travelled to [[Rome]], where he was received and provided for by [[Pope Pius II]]. His hopes of retaking the Morea never materialized and he died in Rome on 12 May 1465. After his death, his claims were inherited by his oldest son Andreas, who also attempted to rally support for a campaign to restore the fallen despotate and the Byzantine Empire.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early life and appointment as despot ===\n[[File:Manuel_II_Helena_sons.JPG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Manuel_II_Helena_sons.JPG|alt=|left|thumb|Miniature from an early 15th-century manuscript depicting Thomas's father Emperor [[Manuel II Palaiologos]], his mother [[Helena Draga\u0161]] and his three oldest brothers [[John VIII Palaiologos|John]] (later Emperor John VIII), [[Theodore II Palaiologos|Theodore]] and [[Andronikos Palaiologos (son of Manuel II)|Andronikos]].]]\nAs the [[Byzantine Empire]] fell apart and fragmented over the course of the 14th century, the emperors of the Palaiologan dynasty came to feel that the only sure way to keep their remaining holdings intact was to grant them to their sons, receiving the title of [[Despot (court title)|despot]], as appanages to defend and govern.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=3}} Emperor [[Manuel II Palaiologos]] ({{Reign}}1391\u20131425) had a total of six sons who survived infancy. Manuel's eldest surviving son, [[John VIII Palaiologos|John]], was raised to co-emperor and designated to succeed Manuel as sole emperor upon his death. The second eldest son, [[Theodore II Palaiologos|Theodore]] was designated as [[Despot of the Morea]] and the third eldest, [[Andronikos Palaiologos (son of Manuel II)|Andronikos]], was made Despot of [[Thessaloniki]] in 1408 at just eight years old. Manuel's younger sons, [[Constantine XI Palaiologos|Constantine]], [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrios]], and Thomas (the youngest, born in 1409, were kept in [[Constantinople]] as there was not sufficient land left to grant them. The younger children; Theodore, Andronikos, Constantine, Demetrios and Thomas were frequently described as having the distinction of [[Porphyrogennetos]] (\"born in the purple\"; born in the imperial palace during the reign of their father), a distinction that does not appear to have been shared by the emperor-to-be John.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=4}}\n\nRelations between the Palaiologos brothers were not always good. Though the young John and Constantine appears to have got on well with each other, relations between Constantine and the younger Demetrios and Thomas were not as friendly.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=4}} The complex relationships between the sons of Manuel II were put to the test when John, now Emperor John VIII, appointed Constantine as Despot of the Morea in 1428. Since his brother Theodore refused to step down from his role as despot, the despotate became governed by two members of the imperial family for the first time since its creation in 1349. Soon thereafter, the younger Thomas (aged 19) was also appointed as Despot of the Morea, meaning that the nominally undivided despotate had effectively disintegrated into three smaller principalities.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=9}}\n\nTheodore did not make way for Constantine or Thomas in the despotate's capital, [[Mystras]]. Instead, Theodore granted Constantine lands throughout the Morea, including the northern harbor town of [[Aigio]], fortresses and towns in [[Laconia]] (in the south), and [[Kalamata]] and [[Messenia]] in the west. Constantine made his capital as despot the town [[Glarentza]]. Meanwhile, Thomas was given lands in the north and based himself in the castle of [[Kalavryta]].{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=9}}\n\n=== Despot under the Byzantine Empire ===\n[[File:Bizancio1400AD-la.svg|left|thumb|Map of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1400. By the time Thomas became [[Despot of the Morea]] in 1428, his older brother [[Theodore II Palaiologos|Theodore]] had already worked to expand the despotate's (the southern territory on the map) borders somewhat. It would be expanded to cover almost the entire [[Peloponnese]] by Thomas and his brother [[Constantine XI Palaiologos|Constantine]].]]\nShortly after being appointed as despots, Constantine and Thomas, together with Theodore, decided to join forces in an attempt to seize the flourishing and strategic port of [[Patras]] in the north-west of the Morea, then under the rule of its Catholic Archbishop. The campaign, which was unsuccessful, possibly due to Theodore's reluctance to partake, was Thomas's first experience of war.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=9}} Constantine later captured Patras on his own, ending 225 of foreign ownership.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=11}}\n\nThomas's early tenure as Despot of the Morea was not without acquisitions either. For years, Thomas and Constantine had been eating away at the last remnants of the Principality of Achaea, a crusader state established during the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204 which had once governed almost the entire peninsula. It was Thomas who finally brought an end to the principality by marrying [[Catherine Zaccaria]], daughter and heir of the final prince, [[Centurione II Zaccaria]]. With Centurione's death in 1432, Thomas could claim control over all of his remaining territories. By the 1430s, Thomas and Constantine had ensured that nearly the entire Peloponnese was once more in Byzantine hands for the first time since 1204, the only exception being the few port towns and cities held by the [[Republic of Venice]].{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=12}}\n\n[[Murad II]], Sultan of the [[Ottoman Empire]], which occupied most of the Byzantine Empire's former territory and had relegated the empire and the despotate as effectively vassal states, felt uneasy about the recent string of Byzantine successes in the Morea. In 1431, [[Turahan Bey]], a Turkish general who governed [[Thessaly]], sent his troops south to demolish the Morea's primary defensive fortifications, the [[Hexamilion wall]], in an effort to remind the despots that they were the Sultan's vassals.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=13}}\n\nIn March 1432, Constantine, possibly desiring to be closer to Mystras, made a new territorial agreement, presumably approved by Theodore and John VIII, with Thomas. Thomas agreed to cede his fortress Kalavryta to Constantine, who made it his new capital, in exchange for [[Elis (city)|Elis]], which Thomas made his new capital.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=13}} Though relations between the three despots thus appears to have been good in 1432, they soon soured. John VIII had no sons to suceed him and it was thus assumed that his successor would be one of his four surviving brothers (Andronikos having died some time before). John VIII's preferred successor was Constantine and though this choice was accepted by Thomas, who had developed good relations with his older brother, it was resented by the still older Theodore. When Constantine was summoned to the capital in 1435, Theodore believed this was to appoint Constantine as co-emperor and designated heir, which was not actually the case, and he too travelled to Constantinople to raise his objections. The quarrel between Constantine and Theodore was not resolved until the end of 1436, when the future Patriarch [[Gregory III of Constantinople|Gregory Mammas]] was sent to reconcile them and prevent civil war. When Constantine was summoned to act as regent in Constantinople while John VIII was away at the [[Council of Florence]] from 1437 to 1440, Theodore and Thomas stayed in the Morea.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=14}} In November 1443, Constantine gave over control of [[Selymbria]], which he had received after helping to deal with the rebellion of their younger brother Demetrios, to Theodore, who in turn abandoned his position as Despot of the Morea, making Constantine and Thomas the sole Despots of the Morea. Though this brought Theodore closer to Constantinople, it also made Constantine the ruler of the capital of the Morea and one of the most powerful men in the small empire.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=19}} With Theodore and Demetrios out of their way, Constantine and Thomas hoped to strengthen the Morea, by now the cultural center of the Byzantine world, and make it a safe and nearly self-suffient principality.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=21}} The philosopher [[Gemistus Pletho]] advocated that while Constantinople was the New Rome, Mystras and the Morea could become the \"New [[Sparta]]\", a centralized and strong hellenic kingdom in its own right.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=22}}\n[[File:Hexamilion-3.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the [[Hexamilion wall]], restored by Thomas and his brother [[Constantine XI Palaiologos|Constantine]] to defend [[Despotate of the Morea|the Morea]] in 1444 and destroyed by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1446.]]\nAmong the actions taken during the brothers' project of strengthening the despotate was to reconstruct the Hexamilion wall, destroyed by the Turks in 1431. Together, they completely restored the wall, which was finished in March 1444.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=24}} The wall was destroyed by the Turks again in 1446 after Constantine had attempted to expand his control northwards and had refused the sultan's demands of dismantling the wall.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=31}} Constantine and Thomas were determined to hold the wall and had brought all their available forces, amounting to perhaps as many as twenty thousand men, to defend it.{{Sfn|Runciman|2009|p=76}} Despite this, the battle by the wall in 1446 was an overwhelming Turkish victory, with Constantine and Thomas barely escaping with their lives. Turahan Bey was sent south to take Mystras and devastate Constantine's lands while Sultan Murad II led his forces in the north of the Peloponnese.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=31}} Although Turahan failed to take Mystras, this was of little consequence as Murad did not wish to conquer the Morea at the time, merely to instill terror, and the Turks soon left the peninsula, devastated and depopulated.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=32}} Constantine and Thomas were in no position to ask for a truce and were forced to accept Murad as their lord and pay him tribute, promising to never again restore the Hexamilion wall.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=33}}\n\nTheir former co-despot Theodore died in June 1448, and on 31 October of the same year, Emperor John VIII passed away. The potential successors to the throne were Constantine, Demetrios and Thomas. John had not formally designated and heir, though everyone knew he favored Constantine and ultimately, the will of their mother, [[Helena Draga\u0161]] (who also preferred Constantine), prevailed.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=35}} Both Thomas, who had no intention of claiming the throne, and Demetrios, who most certainly did, hurried to Constantinople and reached the capital before Constantine. Though Demetrios was favored by many due to his anti-unionist sentiment, Helena reserved her right to act as regent until her eldest son, Constantine arrived, stalling Demetrios's attempt at seizing the throne. Thomas accepted Constantine's appointment and Demetrios, who soon thereafter joined in proclaiming Constantine as his new emperor, was overruled. Sphrantzes then informed Sultan Murad II, who also accepted the ascension of Constantine, now Emperor Constantine XI.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=36}} In order to remove Demetrios from the capital and its vicinity, Constantine made Demetrios Despot of the Morea, to rule the despotate together with Thomas. Demetrios was granted Mystras and primarily ruled the southern and eastern parts of the despotate, with Thomas ruling [[Corinthia]] and the north-west, variously using Patras or [[Leontari, Arcadia|Leontari]] as his capital.{{Sfn|Gilliland Wright|2013|p=63}}\n\nIn 1451, Sultan Murad II, by then old and tired and having let go of all intentions of conquering Constantinople, died and was succeeded as sultan by his young and vigorous son [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed II]],{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=44}} who was determined above all else to take the city.{{Sfn|Runciman|2009|p=78}} In 1452, during the preparation stages of the Ottoman siege of Constantinople, Constantine XI sent an urgent message to the Morea, requesting that one of his brothers bring their forces to help him defend the city. To prevent aid coming from the Morea, Mehmed II sent Turahan Bey to devastate the peninsula once more.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=111}} The Turkish attack was repelled by an army commanded by Matthaios Asan, brother-in-law of Demetrios, but this victory came too late to offer any aid to Constantinople.{{Sfn|Runciman|2009|p=79}}\n\n=== Continued rule in the Morea ===\n[[File:Despotate of Morea 1450.svg|left|thumb|The [[Despotate of the Morea]] {{Circa|}} 1450, showing the areas under control by Thomas and his brother [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrios]].]]\nConstantinople ultimately [[Fall of Constantinople|fell]] on 29 May 1453, Constantine XI dying in its defense, ending the Byzantine Empire. In the aftermath of Constantinople's fall, one of the most pressing threats to the new Ottoman regime was the possibility that one of Constantine XI's surviving relatives would find a following and return to reclaim the empire. Luckily for Mehmed II, the two despots in the Morea represented scarcely more than a nuisance and were allowed to keep their titles and lands. Although both Thomas and Demetrios might have considered making their small despotate the rallying point of a campaign to restore the empire, they were never able to cooperate and spent most of their resources fighting each other rather than preparing for a struggle against the Turks.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=110}}\n\nShortly after Constantinople fell, a revolt broke out against the despots in the Morea, prompted by the many Albanian immigrants to the region being unhappy with the actions of the local Greek landowners.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=111}} The Albanians had respected earlier despots, such as Constantine and Theodore, but despised the two current despots and without central authority from Constantinople, they saw their opportunity to gain control of the despotate for themselves. In Thomas's part of the despotate, the rebels chose to proclaim [[John Asen Zaccaria]], bastard son of Thomas's father-in-law Centurione II, as their leader and in Demetrios's part of the despotate, the leader of the revolt was [[Manuel Kantakouzenos (usurper)|Manuel Kantakouzenos]], grandson of [[Demetrios I Kantakouzenos]] (who had served as despot until 1384) and great-great-grandson of Emperor [[John VI Kantakouzenos]] ({{Reign}}1347\u20131354).{{Sfn|Runciman|2009|p=79}} Mehmed II did not wish to see the despotate pass into the hands of Albanians, and out of his control, and sent an army to quell the rebellion in December 1453. The rebellion was not fully crushed until October 1454, when Turahan Bey arrived to aid the despots in firmly establishing their authority in the region. In return for the aid, Mehmed demanded a heavy tribute from Thomas and Demetrios.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=111}}\n\nNeither brother could raise the sum demanded by the Sultan and they were divided in their policies. While Demetrios, probably the more realistic of the two, had given up hope of Christian aid from the west and thought it might be best to placate the Turks, Thomas retained hope that the Papacy might yet call for a crusade to restore the Byzantine Empire. With no money coming from the Morea, Mehmed eventually lost his patience with the Palaiologoi. The Ottoman army marched from Adrianople in May 1458 and entered the Morea, where the only real resistance was faced at [[Corinth]], within the domain governed by Demetrios.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=111}} Leaving his artillery to bombard and besiege that city, Mehmed left with most of his army to devastate and conquer the northern parts of the despotate, under Thomas's jurisdiction. Corinth at last gave up in August, after several cities in the north had already surrendered, and Mehmed imposed a heavy retribution on the Morea. The territory under the two brothers was drastically reduced, Corinth, [[Patras]] and much of the north-west of the peninsula were annexed into the Ottoman Empire and provided with Turkish governors, with the Palaiologoi only being allowed to keep the south, including the despotate's nominal capital, Mystras, on the condition that they paid their annual tribute to the sultan.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=112}}\n\nAlmost as soon as Mehmed had left the Morea, the two brothers began quarreling with each other again. Demetrios invited Mehmed to return to the Morea and support his cause against Thomas, while Thomas sent pleas to the Papacy for aid. Neither brother had any true control over their remainig territory, where the Greek landowners mostly did as they pleased. Thomas's pleas to the west did represent a real threat to the Ottomans, a threat made even greater through the support of the plan by the vocal Cardinal [[Basilios Bessarion|Bessarion]], a Byzantine refugee who had escaped the empire years earlier. [[Pope Pius II]] convened a council in 1459 in [[Mantua]] and sent Bessarion and some others to preach for a crusade against the Ottomans throughout Europe. Furthermore, Pius II had sent 300 soldiers to aid Thomas, who successfully retook Kalavryta from the Ottomans and attempted to retake Patras.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=112}} Soon after, the Papal troops lost interest and returned home and Thomas began to quarrel with Demetrios once more. Near the end of 1459, Mehmed ordered the [[Diocese of Lacedaemon|Bishop of Lacedaemon]] to make the two swear to keep the peace, but this had little impact and they were once more quarreling a few weeks later.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=113}}\n\nDetermined to bring order to Greece, Mehmed decided that the destruction of the despotate and its full annexation directly into his empire was the only possible solution. The sultan assembled his army once more in April 1460 and led it in person first to Corinth and then on to Mystras. Demetrios surrendered to the Ottomans without a fight, fearing retribution and already having sent his family to safety in [[Monemvasia]]. Mystras thus fell into Ottoman hands on 29 May 1460, exactly seven years after Constantinople's fall. The few places in the Morea that dared resist the sultan's army were devastated as per Islamic law, the men being massacred and the women and children being taken away. As large numbers of Greek refugees escaped to Venetian-held territories such as [[Methoni, Messenia|Methoni]] and [[Koroni]], the Morea was slowly subdued, the last resistance being led by [[Graitzas Palaiologos|Constantine Graitzas Palaiologos]], a relative of Thomas and Demetrios, at [[Salmeniko Castle|Salmenikon]] in July 1461.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=113}}\n\n=== Life in exile ===\n[[File:Vatican StPaul Statue.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]] in front of the [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]]. Thomas served as the model of this statue in the 1460s.|alt=|left]]By the time the despotate fell, Thomas had already fled to Methoni with his wife Catherine and his children [[Andreas Palaiologos|Andreas]], [[Manuel Palaiologos|Manuel]] and [[Sophia Palaiologina|Zoe]]. In July 1460, Thomas and his family, accompanied by other Greek nobles (such as the historian [[George Sphrantzes]]) fled to [[Corfu]] with Venetian help. Catherine and the children stayed in Corfu, but Thomas chose to travel to [[Rome]] in November that same year, hoping to convince Pope Pius II to call for a crusade.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=114}} Thomas, as the brother of the final Byzantine emperor, was the highest profile ruler in exile of all the many Christians who escaped the Balkans over the course of the Ottoman conquest.{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=649}}\n\nUpon arriving in Rome, Thomas met with Pius II, who bestowed him with the [[Golden Rose]], lodging in the [[Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia]] and a pension of 300 [[Ducat|ducats]] each month (for a total of 3600 annually). In addition to the papal pension, Thomas also received an additional 200 ducats a month from the cardinals and 500 ducats from the Republic of Venice, which also begged him not to return to Corfu as to not affect Venice's already tenuous relations with the Ottomans. Thomas's many followers considered the money provided to him to be barely enough to support the despot, and certainly nowhere near enough to also support themselves.{{Sfn|Miller|1921|p=500}} The Papacy recognized Thomas as the rightful Despot of the Morea and the true heir to the Byzantine Empire, though Thomas never claimed the imperial title.{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=650}}\n\nOn 12 April 1462, Thomas gave the supposed skull of Saint [[Andrew the Apostle]], a precious relic which had been in Byzantine hands for centuries, to Pius II. Pius received the skull from Cardinal Bessarion at the [[Ponte Milvio]]. The ceremony, which was hailed as a return of Andrew to his relatives, the Romans (as symbolic descendants of [[Saint Peter]]) is depicted on Pius II's grave.{{Sfn|Miller|1921|p=500}}\n\nDuring his stay in Rome, Thomas, on account of his \"tall and handsome appearance\", served as the model of the statue of [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]] which to this day stands in front of the [[St. Peter's Basilica]].{{Sfn|Miller|1921|p=500}}\n\nWhile many of the Balkan exiles were happy to live out their lives in obscurity,{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=649}} Thomas hoped to eventually restore control over Byzantine territory. There were genuine preparations being conducted for a crusade, aimed at recovering Constantinople, during the 1460s, a plan staunchly supported by Thomas. To drum up support for the venture, Thomas toured Italy, carrying with him papal letters of [[indulgence]]. On his visits to the courts of the various landholders in Italy, Thomas presented himself as \"a prince who was born to the illustrious and ancient family of the Palaiologoi ... a man who is now an immigrant, naked, robbed of everything except his lineage\".{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=650}}\n\nUpon the death of his wife in August 1462,{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=115}} Thomas summoned his children (who still remained at Corfu) to Rome, but they only arrived in the city after Thomas had died on 12 May 1465.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=554}} Though Thomas had been largely bypassed and forgotten by the Roman elite after Pius II's death in 1464,{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=650}} he was buried with honor in the St. Peter's Basilica,{{Sfn|Miller|1921|p=500}}{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=554}} where his grave would survive the destruction and removal of the tombs of the Palaiologan emperors in Constantinople during the early years of Ottoman rule.{{Sfn|Melvani|2018|p=260}} Modern efforts to locate his grave within the Basilica have so far proven fruitless.{{Sfn|Miller|1921|p=500}}\n\n== Children and descendants ==\n[[File:IoannIV reconstruction by Gerasimov02.jpg|thumb|[[Forensic anthropology|Forensical]] reconstruction of [[Ivan the Terrible]], [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]]'s first [[Tsar]] from 1547 to 1584.

By the time of the Morea's fall, Helena had long since moved to [[Smederevo]] with her husband (who eventually became the Despot of Serbia in 1456). Lazar died in 1458 and Helena was left to care for the couple's three daughters. In 1459, Mehmed II invaded Serbia and put an end to the despotate, but Helena was allowed to leave the country. After spending some time in [[Ragusa (Croatia)|Ragusa]], she moved to Corfu and lived there with her mother and siblings. After that, Helena became a nun and lived on the island of [[Lefkada]], where she died in November 1473. Though Helena had many descendants through her three daughters [[Maria of Serbia, Queen of Bosnia|Jelena]], [[Milica Brankovi\u0107|Milica]] and [[Jerina Brankovi\u0107 (wife of Gjon Kastrioti II)|Jerina Brankovic]], none of them carried on the Palaiologos name.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=115}}\n* '''[[Sophia Palaiologina|Zoe Palaiologina]]''' ({{Circa|}} 1449 \u2013 7 April 1503), the younger daughter of Thomas and Catherine, Zoe was married off to [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III, Grand Prince of Moscow]], by [[Pope Sixtus IV]] in 1472, in the hope of converting the Russians to Roman Catholicism. The Russians did not convert, with the marriage being celebrated according to Eastern Orthodox tradition. Zoe was called \"Sophia\" in Russia and her marriage to Ivan III served to strengthen Moscow's claim to be \"[[Moscow, third Rome|Third Rome]]\", the ideological and spiritual successor to the Byzantine Empire. Zoe and Ivan III had several children, who in turn had numerous descendants and though none carried the Palaiologos name, many of them used the [[double-headed eagle]] iconography of Byzantium. The famous [[Ivan the Terrible]], Russia's first [[Tsar]], was Sophia's grandson.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=115}}\n*'''[[Andreas Palaiologos]]''' (17 January 1453 \u2013 June 1502), the older of the couple's two sons and the third child overall, Andreas lived most of his life in Rome, surviving on a gradually declining papal pension. After Thomas's death, Andreas was recognized by the Papacy and others in Italy as the rightful heir to the Despotate of the Morea and he would later go on to claim the title ''Imperator Constantinopolitanus'' (\"Emperor of Constantinople\") as well, hoping to one day restore the fallen Byzantine Empire. He attempted to organize an expedition to restore the empire in 1481, but his plans failed and he later ceded the rights to the imperial title to [[Charles VIII of France]], hoping to use him as a champion against the Turks. Andreas died poor in Rome, whether or not he had any children is uncertain. His will specified that his titles were to be granted to the [[Catholic Monarchs of Spain|Catholic Monarchs]] in Spain (though they never used them).{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=116}}{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=537\u2013554}}\n* '''[[Manuel Palaiologos]]''' (2 January 1455 \u2013 before 1512), the youngest of the four children, Manuel lived in Rome and lived off Papal money, much the same as his brother. As the pension deteriorated and Manuel (as second-in-line) did not have any titles to sell, he instead travelled Europe in search of someone to hire him in a military capacity. Failing to find satisfactory offers, Manuel surprised everyone else involved by travelling to Constantinople in 1476 and throwing himself on the mercy of Sultan Mehmed II, who graciously received him. He married an unknown woman and stayed in Constantinople for the rest of his life. Manuel had two sons, one of which died young and another which converted to Islam and whose eventual fate is uncertain.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=115}}{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=539}}\n\nIn the late 16th century, a family with the last name Paleologus, living in [[Pesaro]] in Italy, claimed descent from Thomas through a supposed third son, called John.

He was the younger brother of [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]], the final [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]]. Thomas was appointed as Despot of the Morea by his oldest brother, Emperor [[John VIII Palaiologos]], in 1428, joining his two brothers and other despots [[Theodore II Palaiologos|Theodore]] and Constantine, already governing the Morea. Though Theodore proved reluctant to cooperate with his brothers, Thomas and Constantine successfully worked to strengthen the despotate and expand its borders. In 1432, Thomas brought the remaining territories of the Latin [[Principality of Achaea]], established during the [[Fourth Crusade]] more than two hundred years earlier, into Byzantine hands by marrying [[Catherine Zaccaria]], daughter and heir to the principality.\n\nIn 1449, Thomas supported the ascension of his brother Constantine, who then became Emperor Constantine XI, to the throne despite the machinations of his other brother, [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrios]], who himself desired the throne. After Constantine's rise to the throne, Demetrios was then assigned by Constantine to govern the Morea with Thomas but the two brothers found it difficult to cooperate, often quarreling with each other. In the aftermath of the [[Fall of Constantinople]] and end of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1453, Ottoman Sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed II]] allowed Thomas and Demetrios to continue to rule as Ottoman vassals in the Morea. Thomas hoped to turn the small despotate into a rallying point of a campaign to restore the empire, hoping to gain support from the [[Papacy]] and [[Western Europe]]. Constant quarreling with Demetrios, who supported the Ottomans instead, eventually led Mehmed to invade and conquer the Morea in 1460.\n\nThomas and his family, including his wife Catherine and his three younger children [[Sophia Palaiologina|Zoe]], [[Andreas Palaiologos|Andreas]] and [[Manuel Palaiologos|Manuel]], escaped into exile to the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]]-held city of [[Methoni, Messenia|Methoni]] and then to [[Corfu]], where Catherine and the children stayed. In the hopes of raising support for a crusade to restore his lands in the Morea, and possibly the Byzantine Empire itself, Thomas travelled to [[Rome]], where he was received and provided for by [[Pope Pius II]]. His hopes of retaking the Morea never materialized and he died in Rome on 12 May 1465. After his death, his claims were inherited by his oldest son Andreas, who also attempted to rally support for a campaign to restore the fallen despotate and the Byzantine Empire.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early life and appointment as despot ===\n[[File:Manuel_II_Helena_sons.JPG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Manuel_II_Helena_sons.JPG|alt=|left|thumb|Miniature from an early 15th-century manuscript depicting Thomas's father Emperor [[Manuel II Palaiologos]], his mother [[Helena Draga\u0161]] and his three oldest brothers [[John VIII Palaiologos|John]] (later Emperor John VIII), [[Theodore II Palaiologos|Theodore]] and [[Andronikos Palaiologos (son of Manuel II)|Andronikos]].]]\nAs the [[Byzantine Empire]] fell apart and fragmented over the course of the 14th century, the emperors of the Palaiologan dynasty came to feel that the only sure way to keep their remaining holdings intact was to grant them to their sons, receiving the title of [[Despot (court title)|despot]], as appanages to defend and govern.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=3}} Emperor [[Manuel II Palaiologos]] ({{Reign}}1391\u20131425) had a total of six sons who survived infancy. Manuel's eldest surviving son, [[John VIII Palaiologos|John]], was raised to co-emperor and designated to succeed Manuel as sole emperor upon his death. The second eldest son, [[Theodore II Palaiologos|Theodore]] was designated as [[Despot of the Morea]] and the third eldest, [[Andronikos Palaiologos (son of Manuel II)|Andronikos]], was made Despot of [[Thessaloniki]] in 1408 at just eight years old. Manuel's younger sons, [[Constantine XI Palaiologos|Constantine]], [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrios]], and Thomas (the youngest, born in 1409, were kept in [[Constantinople]] as there was not sufficient land left to grant them. The younger children; Theodore, Andronikos, Constantine, Demetrios and Thomas were frequently described as having the distinction of [[Porphyrogennetos]] (\"born in the purple\"; born in the imperial palace during the reign of their father), a distinction that does not appear to have been shared by the emperor-to-be John.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=4}}\n\nRelations between the Palaiologos brothers were not always good. Though the young John and Constantine appears to have got on well with each other, relations between Constantine and the younger Demetrios and Thomas were not as friendly.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=4}} The complex relationships between the sons of Manuel II were put to the test when John, now Emperor John VIII, appointed Constantine as Despot of the Morea in 1428. Since his brother Theodore refused to step down from his role as despot, the despotate became governed by two members of the imperial family for the first time since its creation in 1349. Soon thereafter, the younger Thomas (aged 19) was also appointed as Despot of the Morea, meaning that the nominally undivided despotate had effectively disintegrated into three smaller principalities.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=9}}\n\nTheodore did not make way for Constantine or Thomas in the despotate's capital, [[Mystras]]. Instead, Theodore granted Constantine lands throughout the Morea, including the northern harbor town of [[Aigio]], fortresses and towns in [[Laconia]] (in the south), and [[Kalamata]] and [[Messenia]] in the west. Constantine made his capital as despot the town [[Glarentza]]. Meanwhile, Thomas was given lands in the north and based himself in the castle of [[Kalavryta]].{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=9}}\n\n=== Despot under the Byzantine Empire ===\n[[File:Bizancio1400AD-la.svg|left|thumb|Map of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1400. By the time Thomas became [[Despot of the Morea]] in 1428, his older brother [[Theodore II Palaiologos|Theodore]] had already worked to expand the despotate's (the southern territory on the map) borders somewhat. It would be expanded to cover almost the entire [[Peloponnese]] by Thomas and his brother [[Constantine XI Palaiologos|Constantine]].]]\nShortly after being appointed as despots, Constantine and Thomas, together with Theodore, decided to join forces in an attempt to seize the flourishing and strategic port of [[Patras]] in the north-west of the Morea, then under the rule of its Catholic Archbishop. The campaign, which was unsuccessful, possibly due to Theodore's reluctance to partake, was Thomas's first experience of war.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=9}} Constantine later captured Patras on his own, ending 225 of foreign ownership.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=11}}\n\nThomas's early tenure as Despot of the Morea was not without acquisitions either. For years, Thomas and Constantine had been eating away at the last remnants of the Principality of Achaea, a crusader state established during the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204 which had once governed almost the entire peninsula. It was Thomas who finally brought an end to the principality by marrying [[Catherine Zaccaria]], daughter and heir of the final prince, [[Centurione II Zaccaria]]. With Centurione's death in 1432, Thomas could claim control over all of his remaining territories. By the 1430s, Thomas and Constantine had ensured that nearly the entire Peloponnese was once more in Byzantine hands for the first time since 1204, the only exception being the few port towns and cities held by the [[Republic of Venice]].{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=12}}\n\n[[Murad II]], Sultan of the [[Ottoman Empire]], which occupied most of the Byzantine Empire's former territory and had relegated the empire and the despotate as effectively vassal states, felt uneasy about the recent string of Byzantine successes in the Morea. In 1431, [[Turahan Bey]], a Turkish general who governed [[Thessaly]], sent his troops south to demolish the Morea's primary defensive fortifications, the [[Hexamilion wall]], in an effort to remind the despots that they were the Sultan's vassals.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=13}}\n\nIn March 1432, Constantine, possibly desiring to be closer to Mystras, made a new territorial agreement, presumably approved by Theodore and John VIII, with Thomas. Thomas agreed to cede his fortress Kalavryta to Constantine, who made it his new capital, in exchange for [[Elis (city)|Elis]], which Thomas made his new capital.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=13}} Though relations between the three despots thus appears to have been good in 1432, they soon soured. John VIII had no sons to suceed him and it was thus assumed that his successor would be one of his four surviving brothers (Andronikos having died some time before). John VIII's preferred successor was Constantine and though this choice was accepted by Thomas, who had developed good relations with his older brother, it was resented by the still older Theodore. When Constantine was summoned to the capital in 1435, Theodore believed this was to appoint Constantine as co-emperor and designated heir, which was not actually the case, and he too travelled to Constantinople to raise his objections. The quarrel between Constantine and Theodore was not resolved until the end of 1436, when the future Patriarch [[Gregory III of Constantinople|Gregory Mammas]] was sent to reconcile them and prevent civil war. When Constantine was summoned to act as regent in Constantinople while John VIII was away at the [[Council of Florence]] from 1437 to 1440, Theodore and Thomas stayed in the Morea.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=14}} In November 1443, Constantine gave over control of [[Selymbria]], which he had received after helping to deal with the rebellion of their younger brother Demetrios, to Theodore, who in turn abandoned his position as Despot of the Morea, making Constantine and Thomas the sole Despots of the Morea. Though this brought Theodore closer to Constantinople, it also made Constantine the ruler of the capital of the Morea and one of the most powerful men in the small empire.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=19}} With Theodore and Demetrios out of their way, Constantine and Thomas hoped to strengthen the Morea, by now the cultural center of the Byzantine world, and make it a safe and nearly self-suffient principality.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=21}} The philosopher [[Gemistus Pletho]] advocated that while Constantinople was the New Rome, Mystras and the Morea could become the \"New [[Sparta]]\", a centralized and strong hellenic kingdom in its own right.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=22}}\n[[File:Hexamilion-3.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the [[Hexamilion wall]], restored by Thomas and his brother [[Constantine XI Palaiologos|Constantine]] to defend [[Despotate of the Morea|the Morea]] in 1444 and destroyed by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1446.]]\nAmong the actions taken during the brothers' project of strengthening the despotate was to reconstruct the Hexamilion wall, destroyed by the Turks in 1431. Together, they completely restored the wall, which was finished in March 1444.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=24}} The wall was destroyed by the Turks again in 1446 after Constantine had attempted to expand his control northwards and had refused the sultan's demands of dismantling the wall.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=31}} Constantine and Thomas were determined to hold the wall and had brought all their available forces, amounting to perhaps as many as twenty thousand men, to defend it.{{Sfn|Runciman|2009|p=76}} Despite this, the battle by the wall in 1446 was an overwhelming Turkish victory, with Constantine and Thomas barely escaping with their lives. Turahan Bey was sent south to take Mystras and devastate Constantine's lands while Sultan Murad II led his forces in the north of the Peloponnese.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=31}} Although Turahan failed to take Mystras, this was of little consequence as Murad did not wish to conquer the Morea at the time, merely to instill terror, and the Turks soon left the peninsula, devastated and depopulated.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=32}} Constantine and Thomas were in no position to ask for a truce and were forced to accept Murad as their lord and pay him tribute, promising to never again restore the Hexamilion wall.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=33}}\n\nTheir former co-despot Theodore died in June 1448, and on 31 October of the same year, Emperor John VIII passed away. The potential successors to the throne were Constantine, Demetrios and Thomas. John had not formally designated and heir, though everyone knew he favored Constantine and ultimately, the will of their mother, [[Helena Draga\u0161]] (who also preferred Constantine), prevailed.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=35}} Both Thomas, who had no intention of claiming the throne, and Demetrios, who most certainly did, hurried to Constantinople and reached the capital before Constantine. Though Demetrios was favored by many due to his anti-unionist sentiment, Helena reserved her right to act as regent until her eldest son, Constantine arrived, stalling Demetrios's attempt at seizing the throne. Thomas accepted Constantine's appointment and Demetrios, who soon thereafter joined in proclaiming Constantine as his new emperor, was overruled. Sphrantzes then informed Sultan Murad II, who also accepted the ascension of Constantine, now Emperor Constantine XI.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=36}} In order to remove Demetrios from the capital and its vicinity, Constantine made Demetrios Despot of the Morea, to rule the despotate together with Thomas. Demetrios was granted Mystras and primarily ruled the southern and eastern parts of the despotate, with Thomas ruling [[Corinthia]] and the north-west, variously using Patras or [[Leontari, Arcadia|Leontari]] as his capital.{{Sfn|Gilliland Wright|2013|p=63}}\n\nIn 1451, Sultan Murad II, by then old and tired and having let go of all intentions of conquering Constantinople, died and was succeeded as sultan by his young and vigorous son [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed II]],{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=44}} who was determined above all else to take the city.{{Sfn|Runciman|2009|p=78}} In 1452, during the preparation stages of the Ottoman siege of Constantinople, Constantine XI sent an urgent message to the Morea, requesting that one of his brothers bring their forces to help him defend the city. To prevent aid coming from the Morea, Mehmed II sent Turahan Bey to devastate the peninsula once more.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=111}} The Turkish attack was repelled by an army commanded by Matthaios Asan, brother-in-law of Demetrios, but this victory came too late to offer any aid to Constantinople.{{Sfn|Runciman|2009|p=79}}\n\n=== Continued rule in the Morea ===\n[[File:Despotate of Morea 1450.svg|left|thumb|The [[Despotate of the Morea]] {{Circa|}} 1450, showing the areas under control by Thomas and his brother [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrios]].]]\nConstantinople ultimately [[Fall of Constantinople|fell]] on 29 May 1453, Constantine XI dying in its defense, ending the Byzantine Empire. In the aftermath of Constantinople's fall, one of the most pressing threats to the new Ottoman regime was the possibility that one of Constantine XI's surviving relatives would find a following and return to reclaim the empire. Luckily for Mehmed II, the two despots in the Morea represented scarcely more than a nuisance and were allowed to keep their titles and lands. Although both Thomas and Demetrios might have considered making their small despotate the rallying point of a campaign to restore the empire, they were never able to cooperate and spent most of their resources fighting each other rather than preparing for a struggle against the Turks.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=110}}\n\nShortly after Constantinople fell, a revolt broke out against the despots in the Morea, prompted by the many Albanian immigrants to the region being unhappy with the actions of the local Greek landowners.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=111}} The Albanians had respected earlier despots, such as Constantine and Theodore, but despised the two current despots and without central authority from Constantinople, they saw their opportunity to gain control of the despotate for themselves. In Thomas's part of the despotate, the rebels chose to proclaim [[John Asen Zaccaria]], bastard son of Thomas's father-in-law Centurione II, as their leader and in Demetrios's part of the despotate, the leader of the revolt was [[Manuel Kantakouzenos (usurper)|Manuel Kantakouzenos]], grandson of [[Demetrios I Kantakouzenos]] (who had served as despot until 1384) and great-great-grandson of Emperor [[John VI Kantakouzenos]] ({{Reign}}1347\u20131354).{{Sfn|Runciman|2009|p=79}} Mehmed II did not wish to see the despotate pass into the hands of Albanians, and out of his control, and sent an army to quell the rebellion in December 1453. The rebellion was not fully crushed until October 1454, when Turahan Bey arrived to aid the despots in firmly establishing their authority in the region. In return for the aid, Mehmed demanded a heavy tribute from Thomas and Demetrios.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=111}}\n\nNeither brother could raise the sum demanded by the Sultan and they were divided in their policies. While Demetrios, probably the more realistic of the two, had given up hope of Christian aid from the west and thought it might be best to placate the Turks, Thomas retained hope that the Papacy might yet call for a crusade to restore the Byzantine Empire. With no money coming from the Morea, Mehmed eventually lost his patience with the Palaiologoi. The Ottoman army marched from Adrianople in May 1458 and entered the Morea, where the only real resistance was faced at [[Corinth]], within the domain governed by Demetrios.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=111}} Leaving his artillery to bombard and besiege that city, Mehmed left with most of his army to devastate and conquer the northern parts of the despotate, under Thomas's jurisdiction. Corinth at last gave up in August, after several cities in the north had already surrendered, and Mehmed imposed a heavy retribution on the Morea. The territory under the two brothers was drastically reduced, Corinth, [[Patras]] and much of the north-west of the peninsula were annexed into the Ottoman Empire and provided with Turkish governors, with the Palaiologoi only being allowed to keep the south, including the despotate's nominal capital, Mystras, on the condition that they paid their annual tribute to the sultan.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=112}}\n\nAlmost as soon as Mehmed had left the Morea, the two brothers began quarreling with each other again. Demetrios invited Mehmed to return to the Morea and support his cause against Thomas, while Thomas sent pleas to the Papacy for aid. Neither brother had any true control over their remainig territory, where the Greek landowners mostly did as they pleased. Thomas's pleas to the west did represent a real threat to the Ottomans, a threat made even greater through the support of the plan by the vocal Cardinal [[Basilios Bessarion|Bessarion]], a Byzantine refugee who had escaped the empire years earlier. [[Pope Pius II]] convened a council in 1459 in [[Mantua]] and sent Bessarion and some others to preach for a crusade against the Ottomans throughout Europe. Furthermore, Pius II had sent 300 soldiers to aid Thomas, who successfully retook Kalavryta from the Ottomans and attempted to retake Patras.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=112}} Soon after, the Papal troops lost interest and returned home and Thomas began to quarrel with Demetrios once more. Near the end of 1459, Mehmed ordered the [[Diocese of Lacedaemon|Bishop of Lacedaemon]] to make the two swear to keep the peace, but this had little impact and they were once more quarreling a few weeks later.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=113}}\n\nDetermined to bring order to Greece, Mehmed decided that the destruction of the despotate and its full annexation directly into his empire was the only possible solution. The sultan assembled his army once more in April 1460 and led it in person first to Corinth and then on to Mystras. Demetrios surrendered to the Ottomans without a fight, fearing retribution and already having sent his family to safety in [[Monemvasia]]. Mystras thus fell into Ottoman hands on 29 May 1460, exactly seven years after Constantinople's fall. The few places in the Morea that dared resist the sultan's army were devastated as per Islamic law, the men being massacred and the women and children being taken away. As large numbers of Greek refugees escaped to Venetian-held territories such as [[Methoni, Messenia|Methoni]] and [[Koroni]], the Morea was slowly subdued, the last resistence being led by [[Graitzas Palaiologos|Constantine Graitzas Palaiologos]], a relative of Thomas and Demetrios, at [[Salmeniko Castle|Salmenikon]] in July 1461.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=113}}\n\n=== Life in exile ===\n[[File:Vatican StPaul Statue.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]] in front of the [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]]. Thomas served as the model of this statue in the 1460s.|alt=|left]]By the time the despotate fell, Thomas had already fled to Methoni with his wife Catherine and his children [[Andreas Palaiologos|Andreas]], [[Manuel Palaiologos|Manuel]] and [[Sophia Palaiologina|Zoe]]. In July 1460, Thomas and his family, accompanied by other Greek nobles (such as the historian [[George Sphrantzes]]) fled to [[Corfu]] with Venetian help. Catherine and the children stayed in Corfu, but Thomas chose to travel to [[Rome]] in November that same year, hoping to convince Pope Pius II to call for a crusade.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=114}} Thomas, as the brother of the final Byzantine emperor, was the highest profile ruler in exile of all the many Christians who escaped the Balkans over the course of the Ottoman conquest.{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=649}}\n\nUpon arriving in Rome, Thomas met with Pius II, who bestowed him with the [[Golden Rose]], lodging in the [[Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia]] and a pension of 300 [[Ducat|ducats]] each month (for a total of 3600 annually). In addition to the papal pension, Thomas also received an additional 200 ducats a month from the cardinals and 500 ducats from the Republic of Venice, which also begged him not to return to Corfu as to not affect Venice's already tenuous relations with the Ottomans. Thomas's many followers considered the money provided to him to be barely enough to support the despot, and certainly nowhere near enough to also support themselves.{{Sfn|Miller|1921|p=500}} The Papacy recognized Thomas as the rightful Despot of the Morea and the true heir to the Byzantine Empire, though Thomas never claimed the imperial title.{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=650}}\n\nOn 12 April 1462, Thomas gave the supposed skull of Saint [[Andrew the Apostle]], a precious relic which had been in Byzantine hands for centuries, to Pius II. Pius received the skull from Cardinal Bessarion at the [[Ponte Milvio]]. The ceremony, which was hailed as a return of Andrew to his relatives, the Romans (as symbolic descendants of [[Saint Peter]]) is depicted on Pius II's grave.{{Sfn|Miller|1921|p=500}}\n\nDuring his stay in Rome, Thomas, on account of his \"tall and handsome appearance\", served as the model of the statue of [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]] which to this day stands in front of the [[St. Peter's Basilica]].{{Sfn|Miller|1921|p=500}}\n\nWhile many of the Balkan exiles were happy to live out their lives in obscurity,{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=649}} Thomas hoped to eventually restore control over Byzantine territory. There were genuine preparations being conducted for a crusade, aimed at recovering Constantinople, during the 1460s, a plan staunchly supported by Thomas. To drum up support for the venture, Thomas toured Italy, carrying with him papal letters of [[indulgence]]. On his visits to the courts of the various landholders in Italy, Thomas presented himself as \"a prince who was born to the illustrious and ancient family of the Palaiologoi ... a man who is now an immigrant, naked, robbed of everything except his lineage\".{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=650}}\n\nUpon the death of his wife in August 1462,{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=115}} Thomas summoned his children (who still remained at Corfu) to Rome, but they only arrived in the city after Thomas had died on 12 May 1465.{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=554}} Though Thomas had been largely bypassed and forgotten by the Roman elite after Pius II's death in 1464,{{Sfn|Harris|2013|p=650}} he was buried with honor in the St. Peter's Basilica,{{Sfn|Miller|1921|p=500}}{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=554}} where his grave would survive the destruction and removal of the tombs of the Palaiologan emperors in Constantinople during the early years of Ottoman rule.{{Sfn|Melvani|2018|p=260}} Modern efforts to locate his grave within the Basilica have so far proven fruitless.{{Sfn|Miller|1921|p=500}}\n\n== Children and descendants ==\n[[File:IoannIV reconstruction by Gerasimov02.jpg|thumb|[[Forensic anthropology|Forensical]] reconstruction of [[Ivan the Terrible]], [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]]'s first [[Tsar]] from 1547 to 1584.

By the time of the Morea's fall, Helena had long since moved to [[Smederevo]] with her husband (who eventually became the Despot of Serbia in 1456). Lazar died in 1458 and Helena was left to care for the couple's three daughters. In 1459, Mehmed II invaded Serbia and put an end to the despotate, but Helena was allowed to leave the country. After spending some time in [[Ragusa (Croatia)|Ragusa]], she moved to Corfu and lived there with her mother and siblings. After that, Helena became a nun and lived on the island of [[Lefkada]], where she died in November 1473. Though Helena had many descendants through her three daughters [[Maria of Serbia, Queen of Bosnia|Jelena]], [[Milica Brankovi\u0107|Milica]] and [[Jerina Brankovi\u0107 (wife of Gjon Kastrioti II)|Jerina Brankovic]], none of them carried on the Palaiologos name.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=115}}\n* '''[[Sophia Palaiologina|Zoe Palaiologina]]''' ({{Circa|}} 1449 \u2013 7 April 1503), the younger daughter of Thomas and Catherine, Zoe was married off to [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III, Grand Prince of Moscow]], by [[Pope Sixtus IV]] in 1472, in the hope of converting the Russians to Roman Catholicism. The Russians did not convert, with the marriage being celebrated according to Eastern Orthodox tradition. Zoe was called \"Sophia\" in Russia and her marriage to Ivan III served to strengthen Moscow's claim to be \"[[Moscow, third Rome|Third Rome]]\", the ideological and spiritual successor to the Byzantine Empire. Zoe and Ivan III had several children, who in turn had numerous descendants and though none carried the Palaiologos name, many of them used the [[double-headed eagle]] iconography of Byzantium. The famous [[Ivan the Terrible]], Russia's first [[Tsar]], was Sophia's grandson.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=115}}\n*'''[[Andreas Palaiologos]]''' (17 January 1453 \u2013 June 1502), the older of the couple's two sons and the third child overall, Andreas lived most of his life in Rome, surviving on a gradually declining papal pension.

He attempted to organize an expedition to restore the empire in 1481, but his plans failed and he later ceded the rights to the imperial title to [[Charles VIII of France]], hoping to use him as a champion against the Turks. Andreas died poor in Rome, whether or not he had any children is uncertain. His will specified that his titles were to be granted to the [[Catholic Monarchs of Spain|Catholic Monarchs]] in Spain (though they never used them).{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=116}}{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=537\u2013554}}\n* '''[[Manuel Palaiologos]]''' (2 January 1455 \u2013 before 1512), the youngest of the four children, Manuel lived in Rome and lived off Papal money, much the same as his brother. As the pension deteriorated and Manuel (as second-in-line) did not have any titles to sell, he instead travelled Europe in search of someone to hire him in a military capacity. Failing to find satisfactory offers, Manuel surprised everyone else involved by travelling to Constantinople in 1476 and throwing himself on the mercy of Sultan Mehmed II, who graciously received him. He married an unknown woman and stayed in Constantinople for the rest of his life. Manuel had two sons, one of which died young and another which converted to Islam and whose eventual fate is uncertain.{{Sfn|Nicol|1992|p=115}}{{Sfn|Harris|1995|p=539}}\n\nIn the late 16th century, a family with the last name Paleologus, living in [[Pesaro]] in Italy, claimed descent from Thomas through a supposed third son, called John. This family later mainly lived in [[Cornwall]] and contained figures such as [[Theodore Palaiologos (16th century)|Theodore Paleologus]], who worked as a soldier and hired assassin, and [[Ferdinand Palaiologos|Ferdinand Paleologus]], who retired in Barbados in the late 17th century.{{Sfn|Nicol|1974|p=179\u2013203}} The existence of a son of Thomas called John can't be proven with any certainty as no mention is made of a son by that name in contemporary records.

Lumberjacks were exclusively men. They usually lived in [[bunkhouse]]s or tents. Common equipment included the [[axe]] and [[cross-cut saw]]. Lumberjacks could be found wherever there were vast forests to be harvested and a demand for wood, most likely in Scandinavia, Canada, and parts of the United States. In the U.S., many lumberjacks were of Scandinavian ancestry, continuing the family tradition. American lumberjacks were first centred in north-eastern states such as Maine. They then followed the general [[American frontier|westward migration]] on the continent to the [[Upper Midwest]], and finally the [[Pacific Northwest]]. [[Stewart Holbrook]] documented the emergence and [[American frontier|westward migration]] of the classic American lumberjack in his first book, ''Holy Old Mackinaw: A Natural History of the American Lumberjack''. He often wrote colourfully about lumberjacks in his subsequent books, romanticizing them as hard-drinking, hard-working men. Logging camps were slowly phased out between World War II and the early 1960s as crews could by then be transported to remote logging sites in motor vehicles.<ref>Smith (1972)</ref>\n\n=== Division of Labour ===\n\n[[File:Felling axe.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Felling axes]]\nThe division of labour in lumber camps led to several specialized jobs on logging crews, such as whistle punk, chaser, and high climber.<ref>Radford (1987)</ref>  The whistle punk's job was to sound a whistle (usually at the [[Steam donkey]]) as a signal to the [[yarder]] operator controlling the movement of logs. He also had to act as a safety lookout. A good whistle punk had to be alert and think fast as the safety of the others depended on him. The high climber (also known as a tree topper) used iron climbing hooks and rope to ascend a tall tree in the landing area of the logging site, where he would chop off limbs as he climbed, chop off the top of the tree, and finally attach pulleys and rigging to the tree. After that, it could be used as a [[spar (tree)|spar]] so logs could be skidded into the landing. High climbers and whistle punks were both phased out in the 1960s to early 1970s when portable steel towers replaced spar trees and radio equipment replaced steam whistles for communication. The choker setters attached steel cables (or chokers) to downed logs so they could be dragged into the landing by the yarder. The chasers removed the chokers once the logs were at the landing. Choker setters and chasers were often entry-level positions on logging crews, with more experienced loggers seeking to move up to more skill-intensive positions such as yarder operator and high climber, or supervisory positions such as hook tender. Despite the common perception that all loggers cut trees, the actual felling and bucking of trees were also specialized job positions done by fallers and buckers. Faller and bucker were once two separate job titles, but they are now combined.<ref>Sorden and Vallier, 1986</ref>\n\n=== Machinery ===\n\nBefore the era of modern diesel or gasoline powered equipment, the existing machinery was steam powered. Animal or steam-powered [[skidder]]s could be used to haul harvested logs to nearby rail roads for shipment to [[sawmill]]s. Horse driven [[Michigan logging wheels|logging wheels]] were a means used for moving logs out of the woods. Another way for transporting logs to sawmills was to float them down a body of water or a specially-constructed [[log flume]]. [[Log rolling]], the art of staying on top of a floating log while \"rolling\" the log by walking, was another skill much in demand among lumberjacks. Spiked boots known as [[caulk boots|\"caulks\" or \"corks\"]] were used for log rolling and often worn by lumberjacks as their regular footwear.\n\nThe term \"[[skid row]]\", which today means a poor city neighbourhood frequented by [[homeless]] people, originated in a way in which harvested logs were once transported. Logs could be \"skidded\" down hills or along a [[corduroy road]]. One such street in [[Seattle]] was named Skid Road. This street later became frequented by people down on their luck, and both the name and its meaning morphed into the modern term.\n[[File:Logging Scene Near Bellingham, WA.jpg|thumb|Lumberjacks near Bellingham, Washington, c. 1910]]\n\nAmong the [[living history]] museums that preserve and interpret the [[forest industry]] are:\n* [[BC Forest Discovery Centre]], [[Duncan, British Columbia|Duncan]]\n* [[Camp Five Museum]], [[Laona, Wisconsin]]\n** The [[Lumberjack Steam Train]], a passenger excursion train, operates as part of the museum.\n* [[Central New Brunswick Woodsmen's Museum]], [[Boiestown, New Brunswick]]\n* [[Coos County Logging Museum]], [[Myrtle Point, Oregon]]\n* [[Biltmore Forest School|Cradle of Forestry in America]] historic site, near [[Asheville, North Carolina]]\n* [[Forest History Center]], [[Grand Rapids, Minnesota]]\n* [[Hartwick Pines State Park|Hartwick Pines Logging Museum]], near [[Grayling, Michigan]]\n* [[Lumberman's Monument]], near [[Oscoda, Michigan]]\n* [[Maine Forest & Logging Museum]], [[Bradley, Maine]]\n* [[Pennsylvania Lumber Museum]], near [[Galeton, Pennsylvania]]\n* [[Algonquin Provincial Park#Algonquin Logging Museum|Algonquin Logging Museum]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Algonquin Logging Museum |url=http://www.algonquinpark.on.ca/visit/locations/algonquin-logging-museum.php |website=Algonquin Provincial Park |publisher=The Friends of Algonquin Park |accessdate=17 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618053223/http://www.algonquinpark.on.ca/visit/locations/algonquin-logging-museum.php |archive-date=2018-06-18 |url-status=live }}</ref> in [[Algonquin Provincial Park]], [[Ontario]]\n\n== Lumberjack Culture ==\n[[File:Hodler_Holzf\u00e4ller.jpg|thumb|''Lumberjack'', painting by [[Ferdinand Hodler]], 1910.]]\nTomczik (2008) has investigated the lifestyle of lumberjacks from 1840 to 1940, using records from mostly Maine and Minnesota logging camps. In a period of industrial development and modernization in urban areas, logging remained a traditional business in which the workers exhibited pride in their craft, their physical strength and masculinity, and guarded their individualism. Their camps were a bastion of the traditional workplace as they defied modern rationalized management, and built a culture around masculinity. At the peak in 1906 there were 500,000 lumberjacks, who took special pride in their work. Logging camps were located in isolated areas that provided room and board as well as a workplace. With few females present other than the wives of cooks and foremen, lumberjacks lived an independent life style that emphasized manly virtues in doing dangerous tasks. Men earned praise for their skills in doing their work, for being competitive, and for being aggressive. When not at work, they played rough games, told tall tales, and won reputations for consuming large amounts of food. By 1940, the business was undergoing major changes, as access roads and automobiles ended residential logging camps, chain saws replaced crosscut saws, and managers installed modern industrial methods.<ref>Adam Tomczik, \"'He-men Could Talk to He-men in He-man Language'\": Lumberjack Work Culture in Maine and Minnesota, 1840\u20131940,\" ''Historian'' Winter 2008, Vol. 70 Issue 4, pp 697-715</ref>\n\n==Evolution of Lumberjacks==\n===Tie Hacking===\nA specialty form of logging involving the felling of trees for the production of [[railroad tie]]s was known as tie hacking. These lumberjacks, called tie hacks, used saws to fell trees and cut to length, and a [[broad-axe]] to flatten two or all four sides of the log to create railroad ties. Later, portable saw mills were used to cut and shape ties. Tie hacking was an important form of logging in Wyoming and northern Colorado and the remains of tie hacking camps can be found on National Forest land. The remains of flumes can be seen near [[Dubois, Wyoming]],<ref>{{cite book | title=Knights of the Broadax; the Story of the Wyoming Tie Hack | author=Pinkerton, Joan | year=1981 | ISBN=0-87004-283-1}}</ref> and [[Old Roach, Colorado|Old Roach]], Colorado. In addition, a decaying splash dam exists near the Old Roach site as well. There, tie hacks attempted to float logs down to the Laramie River for the annual spring tie drives, and the splash dam was used to collect winter snow-melt to increase the water flow for the tie drive.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1502768496 |title=History of Jelm, Wyoming, Vol. 1 |first=Keith |last=Jones |page=17}}</ref>\n\n===Modern Logger===\n{{Main|Logging}}\nModern technology changed the job of the modern logger considerably. Although the basic task of harvesting trees is still the same, the machinery and tasks are no longer the same. Many of the old job specialties on logging crews are now obsolete.\n\nChainsaws, [[harvester (forestry)|harvesters]], and feller bunchers are now used to cut or fell trees. The tree is turned into logs by removing the limbs (delimbing) and cutting it into logs of optimal length (bucking). The felled tree or logs are moved from the stump to the landing. Ground vehicles such as a [[skidder]] or [[forwarder]] can pull, carry, or shovel the logs. Cable systems \"cars\" can pull logs to the landing. Logs can also be flown to the landing by helicopter. Logs are commonly transported to the sawmill using trucks. Harvesting methods may include [[clear cutting]] or [[selective cutting]]. Concerns over the environmental impact  have led to controversy about modern logging practices. In certain areas of forest loggers re-plant their crop for future generations.\n\nA ''Wall Street Journal'' survey on the best jobs in the United States ended by listing being a logger as the \"worst\" ''[[Dirty, Dangerous and Demeaning|3D's]]'' job,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.careerjournal.com/jobhunting/change/20020507-lee.html |title=Career & Job News, Work, Employment & Salary Trends - Wall Street Journal - WSJ.com |publisher=Careerjournal.com |accessdate=2010-09-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120071623/http://www.careerjournal.com/jobhunting/change/20020507-lee.html |archive-date=2008-01-20 |url-status=live }}</ref> citing \"work instability, poor income and pure [[Occupational safety and health|danger]]\".

Lumberjacks were exclusively men. They usually lived in [[bunkhouse]]s or tents. Common equipment included the [[axe]] and [[cross-cut saw]]. Lumberjacks could be found wherever there were vast forests to be harvested and a demand for wood, most likely in Scandinavia, Canada, and parts of the United States. In the U.S., many lumberjacks were of Scandinavian ancestry, continuing the family tradition. American lumberjacks were first centred in north-eastern states such as Maine. They then followed the general [[American frontier|westward migration]] on the continent to the [[Upper Midwest]], and finally the [[Pacific Northwest]]. [[Stewart Holbrook]] documented the emergence and [[American frontier|westward migration]] of the classic American lumberjack in his first book, ''Holy Old Mackinaw: A Natural History of the American Lumberjack''. He often wrote colourfully about lumberjacks in his subsequent books, romanticizing them as hard-drinking, hard-working men. Logging camps were slowly phased out between World War II and the early 1960s as crews could by then be transported to remote logging sites in motor vehicles.<ref>Smith (1972)</ref>\n\n=== Division of Labour ===\n\n[[File:Felling axe.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Felling axes]]\nThe division of labour in lumber camps led to several specialized jobs on logging crews, such as whistle punk, chaser, and high climber.<ref>Radford (1987)</ref>  The whistle punk's job was to sound a whistle (usually at the [[Steam donkey]]) as a signal to the [[yarder]] operator controlling the movement of logs. He also had to act as a safety lookout. A good whistle punk had to be alert and think fast as the safety of the others depended on him. The high climber (also known as a tree topper) used iron climbing hooks and rope to ascend a tall tree in the landing area of the logging site, where he would chop off limbs as he climbed, chop off the top of the tree, and finally attach pulleys and rigging to the tree. After that, it could be used as a [[spar (tree)|spar]] so logs could be skidded into the landing. High climbers and whistle punks were both phased out in the 1960s to early 1970s when portable steel towers replaced spar trees and radio equipment replaced steam whistles for communication. The choker setters attached steel cables (or chokers) to downed logs so they could be dragged into the landing by the yarder. The chasers removed the chokers once the logs were at the landing. Choker setters and chasers were often entry-level positions on logging crews, with more experienced loggers seeking to move up to more skill-intensive positions such as yarder operator and high climber, or supervisory positions such as hook tender. Despite the common perception that all loggers cut trees, the actual felling and bucking of trees were also specialized job positions done by fallers and buckers. Faller and bucker were once two separate job titles, but they are now combined.<ref>Sorden and Vallier, 1986</ref>\n\n=== Machinery ===\n\nBefore the era of modern diesel or gasoline powered equipment, the existing machinery was steam powered. Animal or steam-powered [[skidder]]s could be used to haul harvested logs to nearby rail roads for shipment to [[sawmill]]s. Horse driven [[Michigan logging wheels|logging wheels]] were a means used for moving logs out of the woods. Another way for transporting logs to sawmills was to float them down a body of water or a specially-constructed [[log flume]]. [[Log rolling]], the art of staying on top of a floating log while \"rolling\" the log by walking, was another skill much in demand among lumberjacks. Spiked boots known as [[caulk boots|\"caulks\" or \"corks\"]] were used for log rolling and often worn by lumberjacks as their regular footwear.\n\nThe term \"[[skid row]]\", which today means a poor city neighbourhood frequented by [[homeless]] people, originated in a way in which harvested logs were once transported. Logs could be \"skidded\" down hills or along a [[corduroy road]]. One such street in [[Seattle]] was named Skid Road. This street later became frequented by people down on their luck, and both the name and its meaning morphed into the modern term.\n[[File:Logging Scene Near Bellingham, WA.jpg|thumb|Lumberjacks near Bellingham, Washington, c. 1910]]\n\nAmong the [[living history]] museums that preserve and interpret the [[forest industry]] are:\n* [[BC Forest Discovery Centre]], [[Duncan, British Columbia|Duncan]]\n* [[Camp Five Museum]], [[Laona, Wisconsin]]\n** The [[Lumberjack Steam Train]], a passenger excursion train, operates as part of the museum.\n* [[Central New Brunswick Woodsmen's Museum]], [[Boiestown, New Brunswick]]\n* [[Coos County Logging Museum]], [[Myrtle Point, Oregon]]\n* [[Biltmore Forest School|Cradle of Forestry in America]] historic site, near [[Asheville, North Carolina]]\n* [[Forest History Center]], [[Grand Rapids, Minnesota]]\n* [[Hartwick Pines State Park|Hartwick Pines Logging Museum]], near [[Grayling, Michigan]]\n* [[Lumberman's Monument]], near [[Oscoda, Michigan]]\n* [[Maine Forest & Logging Museum]], [[Bradley, Maine]]\n* [[Pennsylvania Lumber Museum]], near [[Galeton, Pennsylvania]]\n* [[Algonquin Provincial Park#Algonquin Logging Museum|Algonquin Logging Museum]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Algonquin Logging Museum |url=http://www.algonquinpark.on.ca/visit/locations/algonquin-logging-museum.php |website=Algonquin Provincial Park |publisher=The Friends of Algonquin Park |accessdate=17 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618053223/http://www.algonquinpark.on.ca/visit/locations/algonquin-logging-museum.php |archive-date=2018-06-18 |url-status=live }}</ref> in [[Algonquin Provincial Park]], [[Ontario]]\n\n== Lumberjack Culture ==\n[[File:Hodler_Holzf\u00e4ller.jpg|thumb|''Lumberjack'', painting by [[Ferdinand Hodler]], 1910.]]\nTomczik (2008) has investigated the lifestyle of lumberjacks from 1840 to 1940, using records from mostly Maine and Minnesota logging camps. In a period of industrial development and modernization in urban areas, logging remained a traditional business in which the workers exhibited pride in their craft, their physical strength and masculinity, and guarded their individualism. Their camps were a bastion of the traditional workplace as they defied modern rationalized management, and built a culture around masculinity. At the peak in 1906 there were 500,000 lumberjacks, who took special pride in their work. Logging camps were located in isolated areas that provided room and board as well as a workplace. With few females present other than the wives of cooks and foremen, lumberjacks lived an independent life style that emphasized manly virtues in doing dangerous tasks. Men earned praise for their skills in doing their work, for being competitive, and for being aggressive. When not at work, they played rough games, told tall tales, and won reputations for consuming large amounts of food. By 1940, the business was undergoing major changes, as access roads and automobiles ended residential logging camps, chain saws replaced crosscut saws, and managers installed modern industrial methods.<ref>Adam Tomczik, \"'He-men Could Talk to He-men in He-man Language'\": Lumberjack Work Culture in Maine and Minnesota, 1840\u20131940,\" ''Historian'' Winter 2008, Vol. 70 Issue 4, pp 697-715</ref>\n\n==Evolution of Lumberjacks==\n===Tie Hacking===\nA specialty form of logging involving the felling of trees for the production of [[railroad tie]]s was known as tie hacking. These lumberjacks, called tie hacks, used saws to fell trees and cut to length, and a [[broad-axe]] to flatten two or all four sides of the log to create railroad ties. Later, portable saw mills were used to cut and shape ties. Tie hacking was an important form of logging in Wyoming and northern Colorado and the remains of tie hacking camps can be found on National Forest land. The remains of flumes can be seen near [[Dubois, Wyoming]],<ref>{{cite book | title=Knights of the Broadax; the Story of the Wyoming Tie Hack | author=Pinkerton, Joan | year=1981 | ISBN=0-87004-283-1}}</ref> and [[Old Roach, Colorado|Old Roach]], Colorado. In addition, a decaying splash dam exists near the Old Roach site as well. There, tie hacks attempted to float logs down to the Laramie River for the annual spring tie drives, and the splash dam was used to collect winter snow-melt to increase the water flow for the tie drive.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1502768496 |title=History of Jelm, Wyoming, Vol. 1 |first=Keith |last=Jones |page=17}}</ref>\n\n===Modern Logger===\n{{Main|Logging}}\nModern technology changed the job of the modern logger considerably. Although the basic task of harvesting trees is still the same, the machinery and tasks are no longer the same. Many of the old job specialties on logging crews are now obsolete.\n\nChainsaws, [[harvester (forestry)|harvesters]], and feller bunchers are now used to cut or fell trees. The tree is turned into logs by removing the limbs (delimbing) and cutting it into logs of optimal length (bucking). The felled tree or logs are moved from the stump to the landing. Ground vehicles such as a [[skidder]] or [[forwarder]] can pull, carry, or shovel the logs. Cable systems \"cars\" can pull logs to the landing. Logs can also be flown to the landing by helicopter. Logs are commonly transported to the sawmill using trucks. Harvesting methods may include [[clear cutting]] or [[selective cutting]]. Concerns over the environmental impact  have led to controversy about modern logging practices. In certain areas of forest loggers re-plant their crop for future generations.\n\nA ''Wall Street Journal'' survey on the best jobs in the United States ended by listing being a logger as the \"worst\" ''[[Dirty, Dangerous and Demeaning|3D's]]'' job,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.careerjournal.com/jobhunting/change/20020507-lee.html |title=Career & Job News, Work, Employment & Salary Trends - Wall Street Journal - WSJ.com |publisher=Careerjournal.com |accessdate=2010-09-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120071623/http://www.careerjournal.com/jobhunting/change/20020507-lee.html |archive-date=2008-01-20 |url-status=live }}</ref> citing \"work instability, poor income and pure [[Occupational safety and health|danger]]\".
